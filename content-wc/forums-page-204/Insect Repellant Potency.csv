5337681,Blackmacs,2017-02-16 11:48:00,2121,Good question. I would say an individual can can loose it's potency after a certain time. I haven't heard or experienced where skeeters become immune to DEET though.
5337801,1K1MOA,2017-02-16 12:35:00,90,"I recommend Permethrin on your clothes (not skin) and high percentage of DEET spray on skin. We have also proven Coppertone Sport waterproof sunscreen is the best repellent for black flies. If your buddy doubts you, leave them without and you put it on. Then you will both know if it makes a difference or not. My buddy now swears by it too; he gave me so much grief that it wouldn't work when I put it on, I made him go about 30 minutes, being bit by flies, before sharing it."
5337809,phishfearme,2017-02-16 12:38:00,1242,"found this on the internet and therefore (according to trump) it must be true: ""DEET is very stable and is effective indefinitely as a repellent. For this reason, the federal government doesn't require an expiration date on product labels. But manufacturers of repellents say that the feel, smell and appearance of their products may change after about three years. This does not reduce the DEET's ability to repel mosquitoes and ticks but may make the product less appealing to users. If you're not sure about your particular product, contact the manufacturer. Any other questions about DEET-based products, you can call us at 1-888-NO-BITES (662-4837)."" from my personal experience, I've had bottles for decades and still use it - with no perceptible lose of efficacy. just make sure the bottle remains tightly closed to avoid evaporation and I think you're fine. bob"
