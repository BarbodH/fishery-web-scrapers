Is one particularly better then the other? I've heard good things about prairie but nothing about five mile. Do either of them have a decent beach for swimming? Is one better then the other for keeping out of the wind? Thx acplumber"

The owners were super helpful and friendly. Never been to Prairie Bee but have been to their other lodge(Happy Day) and had a blast.

5328833,dosxx,2017-02-12 12:49:00,60,Our group fished Wenebegon in July about 4 years ago with Five Mile. We had a great time and the walleye fishing was quite good with regards to both size and numbers. The island camp was nice and it may be nicer now because it seems like the owner was working on some upgrades.This is a good sized lake with lots of water to explore. Enjoy the trip!
