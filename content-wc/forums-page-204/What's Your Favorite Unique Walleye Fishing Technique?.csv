5340297,pale ryder,2017-02-17 20:03:00,1937,Don't know yet. It's only been a few days. You taught me ? Doug Stange taught me that.
5293170,gordy28,2017-01-26 08:23:00,437,Not sure if this is unique but when fishing really rough deep water we have had a lot of luck drifting with big bottom bouncers - 3 or 4 ounce with bigger blades (5 colorado)Its been really deadly for getting bigger walleye for us
5293194,MrSimon,2017-01-26 08:33:00,922,"For those types of lures, in Canada, I catch 90% of my fish on either gold/orange or blue/silver. I suppose a new and different technique would be to simply try different color combos than normal. Who knows, maybe that ugly lure still in the package in the bottom of the box is the next hot item. Oh, and I know it's more for pike, but topwater stuff is great fun when the fish are biting good. I wonder if walleye would strike a surface lure???"
5293234,The tank,2017-01-26 08:49:00,340,It does work. We've caught walleyes on small buzz baits. Works really good in weeds when the may fly hatch is real thick and the wind is blowing into the weed bed. I'm sure that this has been said but in the spring if weather has cause a slow bite I like to put on a flat foot wieght and swivel than about 2 foot of line back to a gum drop floater from northland tackle. Throw it out with live bait and let it sit.
5338473,Capt Morgan,2017-02-16 19:26:00,77,Hey Pale Ryder quit stealing my best technique and what should have been my name.
5338577,1K1MOA,2017-02-16 20:25:00,90,LOL - does sound fun and boy would I like to find some 12 - 15' one piece cane poles like my grandpa had.
5338585,1K1MOA,2017-02-16 20:30:00,90,"Something I have done successfully at night is use a big floating jighead, without any weight and a minnow, and throw it near shore in 2 or 3' of water. top water action walleye is somewhat unique. It is also a killer technique during the day when spring fishing northern in shallow bays."
5338881,packpro,2017-02-17 06:11:00,695,"Just a suggestion. It will be hard to try and new technique and go pioneering at the same time. You may find a presentation that is fantastic, but if you are presenting it where their are no fish then you will never know if it is effective. Or, you could find that hidden honey hole and make a presentation that does not catch fish. Could make for a long a frustrating day. I only say this because we have some pioneers in our group and that is their approach. Lots of long sad faces at the end of the day. If you want to try a new technique try to do so on known spots. If successful, you can then export it to other new locations."
5339169,Ver88,2017-02-17 08:45:00,114,It is not really unusual but I have had good luck with jiggging spoons and jigging raps. Trolling jigs and plastic is also very effective sometimes.
5339561,grizzley,2017-02-17 12:14:00,2518,"Not unusual, but not even mentioned anymore! A red and white Junebug spinner with a piece of red pork rind and a night crawler hanging off the hook, then attached to a 3 way swivel with a dropper weight and trolled."
5340169,pale ryder,2017-02-17 18:52:00,1937,"You joined before I did, so you had a chance at my user name. And I was speed trolling baby depth raiders at least 1 day before you."
5291626,prov1800,2017-01-25 12:29:00,5010,Being able to fish walleye here from the opener till freeze up is hard to put a favourite technique to it.but if i have to pick obe i would say i like to lindy rig from late summer into fall.
5291738,WallyWarrior,2017-01-25 13:17:00,2488,"I've caught a lot fish just dragging a jig head and minnow along the bottom. No real jigging at all. When on a contour where you are going up hill, just allow your jig and minnow to drag up the hill as you drift at about 1mph. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
5291994,Lovetofish,2017-01-25 14:54:00,458,"Favorite is to jig, but I've caught bigger size walleye on average by slow trolling a 2/5ths oz. Cleo spoon. The smaller walleye seem to let it go by. We do this when we fish portage lakes. Small boats and my 3hp motor that pokes along. The Cleo spoon will troll down maybe 12'. Just follow a wind blown shoreline or point."
5292274,pale ryder,2017-01-25 16:54:00,1937,Speed trolling baby depth raiders. By speed trolling I mean as fast as the boat goes without planing. Usually 6-7 mph.
5292290,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-25 17:03:00,447,Sounds like a good way to pick up the occasional big pike or musky.
5292602,Aspencreek,2017-01-25 19:34:00,2911,"First off, Hot Runr I want to be like you when I grow up! Nothing better than slip bobbering with a minnow or leach up tight to cover. But my newest trick is a floating jig with a tail hooked minnow or lively leach or crawler and a sinker that will hold the bottom. Just dragging the set up along the bottom and the speed of a glacier. Had a couple big girls just about take the rod out of my hands."
5293018,MrSimon,2017-01-26 06:34:00,922,"I love this post!!!!! Basically you just said you can have a lot of fun and catch big fish by just using a hook, sinker, and live bait. Sometimes keeping it really simple can be sooooo effective."
5293082,Ricky Spanish,2017-01-26 07:18:00,1298,"Before I had a boat, a #6 hook and a whole crawler in the weeds. Didn't even work it, just tossed it out and sat back."
5293130,Mojo-NC,2017-01-26 08:02:00,1929,"Love the responses so far - keep 'em coming! Are there any particular color patterns that are preferred for the depth raiders (expensive lures!) and the cleo? I've never used either of those. In general I seem to have better luck using lures that have gold and orange for the Canadian waters, but have had pretty good luck with the rainbow trout pattern as well."
5293154,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-26 08:17:00,447,"I have some older Rapalas in a color we call ""northern killer"" because they do well cast for pike but we've also done well trolling for walleyes with them. I have quite limited walleye trolling experience on Canadian waters but ""northern killer"" which is a black/gray with a black dot on the side (I believe it's a shad imitation) along with blue/silver and black/silver have done well on clear water. Firetiger and orange/silver on stained water. Crayfish pattern seems to do reasonably well on all waters. Again, my experience is limited to a total of probably 20 hours so take it with a grain of salt."
5290890,Mojo-NC,2017-01-25 07:50:00,1929,"Anyone who fishes for walleye is familiar with the typical jig fishing, or using spinner rigs, and crawler/leech harnesses. What is your favorite successful walleye fishing technique that might be considered outside of the norm that you use when you're fishing in Canada and sets you apart from the rest of the crowd? Whenever I go up to Canada I like to use all of the standard walleye techniques, but I also like to spend some time away from the rest of the boats. I like to try unique techniques that may or may not always catch a lot of fish but gets us away from everyone else and what they're doing. Maybe it's exploring new water that everyone else doesn't fish that much or trying something completely different. One year I was really psyched about fishing for walleye and pike using a Canada-legal version of the Alabama rig. I did catch fish with it but it wasn't the magic bullet that I expected it might be. What do you do when you want to be different from everyone else?"
5290922,Bill Krejca,2017-01-25 07:59:00,6107,I use my hand-tied jigs and spinners which maybe are patterned somewhat differently than the probably countless offerings which have been previously dragged by the fish. Bill
5291114,Baseline,2017-01-25 09:11:00,3207,"Hand jigging. 30 years ago I pulled up next a reef. Another boat was on the other side about 200 feet away. I notice they were hand jigging so I thought I'd give it a try. It was lots of fun using my hand and arm to feel the bite, set the hook and finally land the fish. I don't hand jig the whole trip, but I will usually try it out once or twice when the situation calls for vertical jigging."
5291138,mjayn,2017-01-25 09:22:00,1188,"You mean handlining, similar to the old man and the sea? I like to cast diving cranks and wood and rock walls/falls. Really at all near surface structure. I don't know how unique it is, but most people think Im a little crazy. When the Walleyes are in the wood and they will leave the wood to hit the crankbait(especially in clear water) that is my absolute favorite way to catch wallleye."
5291154,Hot Runr Guy,2017-01-25 09:28:00,16061,"Go find yourself some 12-15' long cane poles, tie some 30# braid on, and hang a 5"" long chub under a 3"" bobber. Tie up next to some floating timber, lower the rig in-between the logs, and wait for the time of your life, when you have to muscle that fish up out of the deep, and swing him toward your trusty net-man,,,,,, HRG Hey, you asked for unique,,,,,"

5291314,Mike Borger,2017-01-25 10:24:00,1554,"Cool thread idea!Not sure whether this classifies as unique or not, but I'll bet not ""too"" many do it.Pulling small perch patterned floating stick baits behind heavy bottom bouncers around deep structure mid summer.On shield lakes where walleyes are gorging on young of the year perch this will produce some giant fish in the heat of the summer."
5291354,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-25 10:36:00,447,"I don't fish walleyes much and this is something I do in the states but it's unusual and may have application, limited though it may be, to Canadian rivers. I live where a major tributary dumps into part of the Great Lakes. Just below the first dam is a bridge that includes a walk/fishing bridge. We cast stickbaits downstream, close the bail and wait. The current gives the bait action and it hangs there until a fish eats it. Or we go down to the breakwater at the river mouth and ""walk troll"" i.e. cast a stickbait out and ever so slowly walk upriver. Bait trolls right along the breakwater. My best day was four fish from 26-28 1/2"" in a half hour. Also lost a fish that was at least 4"" longer than the 28 1/2"". Still think about that one often."
5291442,Daveygravy,2017-01-25 10:50:00,88,I like to fish a drop shot rig and blade baits. Works pretty good when the fish are 3 feet or more from the bottom.
5291506,MrSimon,2017-01-25 11:20:00,922,"Lighted slip bobbers off the dock at night! It's REALLY fun to sit out on the dock after dinner, have a cigar, BS with your buddies, and wait for that little light to disappear."
