5336201,Multispecies Guy,2017-02-15 18:13:00,447,The Yukon River in Alaska is one of the top waters in the world for big northern pike.
5336849,Baseline,2017-02-16 07:23:00,3207,A lot of the lakes around Anchorage and on the Kenia have northerns.
5338617,1K1MOA,2017-02-16 20:41:00,90,"It's great you are taking your son on this trip. Should be some great memories and we need the younger generation to appreciate the outdoors and all that it offers. I have a good friend that has an 18 year old son that loves the outdoors, but who has parents that are clueless. I offered to bring him and a friend up to Canada, for my June trip, to give them a real outdoor experience. Can you believe his mother changed her mind when she found out he had to miss his graduation ceremony? A week in Canada fishing or 5 seconds shaking some dudes hand and having your name said. I told her ""get him a gown and take his picture, no one will know he wasn't there."" The kid is absolutely dying that she won't let him go. I will inspect my boat carefully before I leave to make sure he is not hiding in it."
5338745,Baseline,2017-02-16 22:38:00,3207,"Recommendation: Lake of the Woods - Nestor Falls, Ontario Try Young's Wilderness Camp. Lots of northerns and walleyes in Stevens Bay. Smallmouth bass are plentiful and, in June, you can catch crappies right off their docks. They are very accommodating. If you are a new comer to walleye and pike fishing they are very adept in informing their guests who are unfamiliar with catch techniques and they provided lots of spots for them to try. It may be wise to hire a guide for the first day just to get your started. The walleyes are easy to find and pike are everywhere there is weed line in a bay adjacent to the main channel. I've fished LOW numerous times and it is a lake that produces good numbers of fish all season. Fly into International Falls. 70 miles to Nestor Falls and Lake of the Woods after you cross the border."
5338769,Baseline,2017-02-16 22:58:00,3207,"Graduation is a big deal for some families. I could have cared less about attending to my HS and college graduations, but my mom and dad had other ideas. 40 years later I'm happy to have the photos of my parents and I proudly smiling in front of each school main entrance with me dressed in my cap and gown. It's nice you asked the kid to go. Looks like you might be committed to a second trip to Canada this year."
5339985,kzoofisher,2017-02-17 17:23:00,5144,"A second trip is definitely in order. Ah, graduation. My Dad didn't make it to mine which didn't bother me much at the time, I didn't particularly want to go but we had a practical joke on and my Mom wanted to be there, too. Years later, at least twenty, I was at a store and the cashier saw my name on the check and asked if my Dad went to my graduation?!? I told her he hadn't and she asked if I knew why. I didn't so she told me that he had missed it to talk to her and her husband about their son who had cancer. She apologized for him missing it and then let me know that her son had survived and she was now a grandmother. My Dad never talked about his patients so it made perfect sense that he never would have told me about this. I appreciated that so many years later she took the opportunity let me know in case it had bothered me. Very sweet. Point is, there are more important things then graduation."
5340809,1K1MOA,2017-02-18 07:46:00,90,"Kzoo...what a wonderful story, it shows we should be careful to judge the actions of others because there could be circumstances we are unaware of...thanks for sharing"
5332601,Davebramlett,2017-02-14 08:13:00,32,"Hello, I am looking to take my son on his 1st Canadian fishing trip. We live is Arizona so we will need to fly into ??. Minnesota? Canada? I would like to fish for numbers as opposed to size so he has a lot of fun. Small Mouth, Walleye, Pike. Looking for a 5 day trip. Any good suggestions. Airfare is going to be costly but I have no choice. Probably a boat in would be best? Thanks for any suggestions. I have done 5 fly-in trips and always had a blast Dave"
5332617,Obabikon,2017-02-14 08:18:00,2370,"Dave, I would guess your best bet is to fly into International Falls. From there, you're an hour or two from a bunch of fantastic fishing options. A less expensive, but more time consuming option would be to fly into Minneapolis and rent a car. From there you're 6-7 hours from great Ontario fishing."
5332777,Mike Borger,2017-02-14 09:01:00,1554,"Agreed. International Falls would be your best bet if you're flying commercially. PM me if you'd like some good options for the two of you. But be very specific (length of trip, budget p/p, preferred fish species, etc..)Cheers"
5332937,LOW1,2017-02-14 09:53:00,2828,Maybe flying into Winnipeg and getting a Winnipeg based outfitter would be another option? Probably cheaper flights?
5333649,bthomas3333,2017-02-14 14:13:00,465,I live in Southern NV. We are lucky to have a non-stop direct to Winnipeg on West Jet (Canada's version of Southwest) that averages about $200 USD each way. I checked today for my normal May opener flight and it is 170 USD up and and about 230 USD back. From there you can do a fly in direct or drive to Kenora (Lake in the Woods) in about 3 hours / Vermillion is about 4 hrs or Red Lake in about 6 hours. My experience is that border crossing is better by air and small US airports tend to be a lot more money that Winnipeg.My first thought for a budget fly-in option out of Winnipeg with good pike and good walleyes is Dunlops Lodge but they are out of Thompson which is a 6-7 hr drive from Winnipeg. Im sure Mike B will have a ton of great advice for you.Just my 2 cents from another SW desert dude.Brett
5333689,Davebramlett,2017-02-14 14:36:00,32,"Thank you, I will look into this option."
5335345,MrSimon,2017-02-15 11:10:00,922,"I'm sure you have your own ideas of how to make the trip fun for your son, but there have been some really interesting threads on here about ""what makes a trip fun for kids"". If you have some time, search them up .... maybe you'll pick up a few ideas on how to really give him a fantastic first trip."
5335465,pike50plus,2017-02-15 12:56:00,584,I sent you a pm
5336049,adempsey2.0,2017-02-15 17:23:00,612,Flights to Alaska don't seem too bad
5336081,Davebramlett,2017-02-15 17:33:00,32,looking for Walleye and Pike. Are there these species in Alaska?
