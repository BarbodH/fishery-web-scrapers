5328929,Aspencreek,2017-02-12 13:28:00,2911,"Oh, I don't know, maybe just some of the things you wrote. I can't believe that none of the small lakes and bays on the west side are not spawning lakes, I'm pretty sure I know of at least 1 for sure. It may be worth your time to find out."
5328969,prov1800,2017-02-12 13:43:00,5010,All i can suggest is come on up early and try it.
5329225,Aspencreek,2017-02-12 16:19:00,2911,"I have, learned alot by exploring and not following the herd or the lead dog."
5329425,pjshorthorn,2017-02-12 17:48:00,5654,Sounds like you should go ahead and offer to guide the OP since you are so experienced with the area. PjShorthorn.

5329705,Aspencreek,2017-02-12 19:29:00,2911,"Look Boys, I actually did offer to help him with my maps and some spots, see my first post! He has also PM 'ed me (along with a couple others too) and I am sending one to all of them. He told us that he was already booked at Onaway so I'm going to try and give him whatever help I can. Instead of telling him to try some other small lakes or eagle. You can and will be able to find fish in that area without going all the way to those other spots. I never said it was easy, but it can be done. I am not a fish biologist, nor have I seen the fish tracking data for the lake, or anything like that, BUT common sense tells me that the east side of the lake is NOT the only areas of the lake where there are spawning lakes and spawning areas. All you need to do is find warmer water, and Mac, Sunlight/Broad and the east side does not have an exclusive on that."
5329809,pjshorthorn,2017-02-12 20:42:00,5654,"There is no doubt that you have quite a bit of experience and knowledge of the areas on Lac Seul that you have fished since 2000. Your initial post was duly noted by myself as I offer the same courtesy to anyone who wants help with the SE and NE sections of Lac Seul. I've fished the east end of Lac Seul since 1982 and have made a lot of mistakes which hopefully help folks on what to expect from the opener through the end of the season. I've sent many a map and email to folks who were just trying to figure something out or plan a first time trip. Obviously, that was your intent with the OP. Prov1800 was mentioned in the thread as a guide to contact for fishing tips on the west end of Lac Seul. You yourself mentioned to the OP to hire a guide. Prov1800 provided some insights into what it was like to fish on the western end of Lac Seul. He mentioned that big water can cause long boat rides in bad weather , to the most popular and well known areas, which is very true on both ends of the lake. At the end of the day, Prov1800 mentioned he would rather fish small lakes or bays. I took that to mean that it was his personal preference and not that he wouldn't guide clients in big water areas that weren't as protected in the event of a big blow. Your response to his message read as if you thought he didn't want to guide people in large water and it came across as you calling him out to that extent. There are quite a few folks on this forum that have hired John to guide them on both ends of Lac Seul, Eagle Lake, Cedar Lake, etc.,etc. I' m not one of those clients, but I would probably give him a jingle if I ever needed help figuring out a lake and the fishing patterns on big water, which includes Eagle Lake. I would agree that the east end of Lac Seul may not hold the only spawning areas. What I will offer is that the west end of Lac Seul does not have as many areas. The NE section is a main area for spawning grounds as three main river systems feed the watershed ....the Root, Vermilion and Wapesi Rivers. The English river also comes into the watershed from Pelican Lake at Sioux Lookout in the SE section. Those spawning grounds support a significant portion of Lac Seul ,which I would guess , include the far west end that so many people fish each year. I'm not a biologist either....just an armchair Lac Seul fisherman that has spent a lot of time on the SE and NE sections and talked to a lot of ardent guys and gals that live there and fish there........for whatever that is worth.

5329833,Jwendt15,2017-02-12 20:55:00,72,"Gentlemen, I really appreciate all of the good info. Two years ago when we went to Onaway during the 2nd week of June, we had some of the best fishing ever at LS within 10 minutes of the camp. That being said, it dried up towards the end of the week and we were struggling to find spots that would consistently produce. Not experienced on LS by any means (this is our third trip), so I had thought it would be a good idea to get a guide and show us some safe routes. Who knows, maybe we got lucky on finding that hole close to camp. I don't doubt you could find a honey hole just about anywhere on that lake. However, I would certainly rather stick to a more consistent bite, and we lost that towards the end of the week last year. Such is life on a fishing boat though. Again, thanks for the input."
5329865,Aspencreek,2017-02-12 21:01:00,2911,"PJ you are the voice of reason. I have talked by message with the OP and he is concerned about having to travel to those faraway spots if hiring a guide. I told him that doing the trip a day or 2 would be worth it, if not for the experience. But I have found fish in the area of Onaway that time of year by just looking for warmer water and studying the map at night trying to find those places. If Pro would contact the OP and answer some of those concerns he may just get a booking."
5323969,Jwendt15,2017-02-09 19:18:00,72,"We are heading to Onaway Lodge the first week in June. Went there two years ago and had a great experience, but are looking for a guide this year to show some additional spots when the ones we've used aren't so hot. We check in June 2nd so would be looking for a guide trip on either the 3rd or 4th that weekend. Anyone familiar with any guides they would recommend out of that area?"
5323985,Moosebunk,2017-02-09 19:23:00,211,Ben Beattie would be my man if I was doing anything on Seul. Just not sure if he won't already be busy guiding for another outfitter at that time. Look him up and ask tho!
5324521,bigwalleye1,2017-02-10 05:55:00,2632,"Colin Gosse would be another solid choice. could be tough, though, looking now for June. Dollar is stronger=more people going=more people with the same idea=June is the prime time. June 2018 would give you a better shot."
5324617,stjoeguy,2017-02-10 06:55:00,979,John Jakobs (prov1800) guided for us when we were at Onaway in 2015. We hired him for one day to get us some tracks in and out of Onaway and show us spots to try later in the week. He did an excellent job and was fun to work with. His contact info is: 1-807-220-0860[email protected]
5327217,Aspencreek,2017-02-11 14:13:00,2911,"PM me with your mailing address, I can send you one our maps with travel routes and some spots to try. I have been fishing out of Onaway or Fishermans Cove since 2000. Hire a guide to re-enforce the travel routes and get you on good spots that time of year. I usually don't go up until July. Say Hi to Blair and Kathy for me, good people!"
5327329,prov1800,2017-02-11 15:15:00,5010,"Fishing early june on lac suel will nirmally mean long boat rides to mckenzie bay,brood lake and south inlet.not saying there are no fish near camp but qauntity wise will drop dramatically on that side of the lake.water temps will be 10 F different and that goes for all if theceast side of the lake right to earfalls.plus the east side has the spawning areaslike broadcand sunlight and turkey creek in mckenzie bay.these spots draw a lot of traffic from as far as earfalls.fro onaway it is a 27 mile boat ride.some years ago it was not as busy in these places but lately i would call it nuts and i personally really would not go there for myself.if you need any more info;i see my phne number has been posted (much appreciate)give me call."
5327857,Aspencreek,2017-02-11 21:00:00,2911,"ProV is correct on the main spots that are good early in June, But MacKenzie is not that far from Onaway, (Onaway is located in Scout Bay, about 20 miles south of Ear Falls by water and Mac is maybe 7-8 across the lake). Sunlight and Broad is a different story but alot of guys travel to them all the way from Ear Falls (if the weather goes bad, that is one very long boat ride). BUT, the water in South islet warms up quickly and there are some special spots in South that would be a good start and it is an easy boat ride from Onaway. (It also happens to be my favorite spot on the lake in July too) And you may have the place to yourself, because everybody heads to Mac, or Broad/Sunlight or the Sanctuary area by Ear Falls. I also have a really good spot in the main lake if the water temps are right and the walleyes have migrated out of Broad."
5327889,prov1800,2017-02-11 21:39:00,5010,If you go from onaway to the shanties your looking at 8 miles.thats where mckemzie bay starts in my book.theres no fish there in early june.you will have to travell another good shot to the sandbanks and turkey creek is even farther.not much diff than going to brood.great fishing but if you get bad weather its not a very nicectrip unless you have a big boat.i prefer smaller protected lakes in early spring.even eagle is better in springvtime.
5328641,Aspencreek,2017-02-12 10:28:00,2911,"They are booked at Onaway, if you don't want to take the guide booking just say so. I have fished out of Onaway and Fisherman's cove since 2000, Mac is where 70% of the boats go all year out of those camps. I on the otherhand, do not wish to follow the crowd and join 100's of my closest friends on the trek to Mac or Broad/Sunlight. There are lots of spots that have warmed sufficiently by June that are holding fish besides those areas, maybe not in the comparable numbers, but I'm also not fighting for a spot to park my boat! Scout bay area holds fish and so does Scout Lake in the spring, South Islet is a hidden gem."
5328825,prov1800,2017-02-12 12:29:00,5010,"Aspen.not sure where you are coming up with the conclusion that i dont want a guide day.iam just putting some info out there for spring fishing.as i said in a earlier post there are some fish in the area.these fish are hard to catch.water is much colder on the west side of the lake as compared to the east side.there are no spawning areas on the west side and the fish there wait for warmer water and spawn on shore.totally different fishing.if you have never fished early here than you wont understand.ive fished lac suel since mid 80,s.have a pretty good understanding of fish movements from ice out till freeze up.plus i ice fish there at times."
