I suppose I'd be in the same position saving a bag of cheeks as well, but I'd also think you'd be ok since it's not really considered to be the normal part of the fish you consume. I used to save perch egg sacks and boil them for my dog. I couldn't imagine getting a ticket for that either, but I suppose anything is possible. I'll have to ask a warden next time I see one.Until I see one, here's the argument I'll use....This from the MN 2016 Regis under Transportation ""You must package and transport fish in such a way that they can be readily unwrapped, separated, identified and counted.• A fish may not be cut into more than two fillets.Counting fillets is the prescribed method for counting fish. Arguably, there's no way to prove these 8 fillets and those 8 cheeks all came from the same 4 fish. If cheeks are indicative of fish counts, having a limit of walleyes and 1 pair of cheeks would put you over the limit."
5330321,bigwalleye1,2017-02-13 07:59:00,2632,"While I understand this is the Canada section, and I have sent off an email to MNR, and await a reply, and will post it here when I receive it.. However, being from MN, the state where absolutely nothing is allowed, I did call the Minnesota DNR enforcement division this morning, and the response I got was that pectoral fins would NOT count toward your limit. HOWEVER, the cheeks WOULD count toward your limit. They were unclear how I could prove these four cheeks came from the same 2 fish that was reduced to 4 fillets in the cooler, but were clear that you can be over the limit based on a cheek count. hey, remember I said ""where absolutely nothing is allowed..."""
5330601,bigwalleye1,2017-02-13 09:35:00,2632,"...and here's the update from our neighbors to the north in Ontario. This email a cut and paste from the response I received to my email from this morning: ""Parts of a fish constitute a fish therefore, you must consume all of the edible flesh in order to take it out of your possession limit. An individual would not be able to save up more cheeks or wings than what would correspond with the total possession limit."" ...and there you have it. Looks like it's not legal to save up cheeks or wings in Ontario either. BTW, any reference I made or may have made at any point to saving up cheeks or wings in this or any other thread was purely for a hypothetical discussion, and not meant to insinuate that I was, am, or at any point would consider saving more cheeks or wings than correspond to the limit of fish in possession."
5331065,Ricky Spanish,2017-02-13 12:18:00,1298,"Good save right there. And, thank you for pointing out something I didn't know. I am looking forward to tasting them. Waste not and all that happy"
5326681,bigwalleye1,2017-02-11 08:34:00,2632,"In a thread about fillet size, there were several posts about walleye cheeks. Not wanting to hijack that thread, I started this one. While a lot of folks take the cheeks, how many of you take the wings? The wings are the pair of bottom fins below and behind the gills. There's a nice piece of meat there, maybe a little larger than the cheeks, a little less scallop-like. Leave the fins and skin intact. Rinse them well, bread or batter and fry. To eat them, hold the fins in each hand, fins pointing outward and downward, so the actual skin of he fish is against your top teeth. Bring your lowers up into contact with the meat, and gently pull on the fins and that little bite slides right off the cartilage. I save the cheeks and wings over the course of a season and fry them for a snack during a sporting game of your choice in the fall and winter.How many partake??"
5326721,pjshorthorn,2017-02-11 08:44:00,5654,And here I was thinking that you had a good chicken wing receipe I have never run into anyone that had done this. Pretty interesting and a good way to use the whole fish. Thanks for the tip. PjShorthorn
5326841,Obabikon,2017-02-11 09:54:00,2370,"I've done wings before. I don't make a practice of it, but a few people do on the big walleyes (and pike) Cheeks are a pretty normal thing for people to take."
5327049,adempsey2.0,2017-02-11 11:50:00,612,Tried Walleye wings for the first time last year. I thought they were excellent! Will probably do them every time now. It's even easier than cutting out the cheeks.
5327121,Mike Borger,2017-02-11 12:30:00,1554,"Have done the wings many times, usually only once on a week long trip though."
5327153,Multispecies Guy,2017-02-11 12:39:00,447,Learn something new every day. This is definitely on my list of things to try this summer.
5327529,Richard B,2017-02-11 17:12:00,735,"I found out about the ""wings"" around 20 years ago and have been eating them ever since. They, and the checks, are great as a snack when frying up a bunch of fish. They go in the grease first and everyone snacks on them while the fillets are being cooked. Love them!"
5327593,jimirjr,2017-02-11 18:20:00,1149,"Was Up at Ft Peck in Montana a few years back...(like 25 years ago) first ever visit..We caught a ""few"" Wally's in the 3 days We were there..Bringing Our catch to the cleaning station, One of The bigger name Guides was cleaning His clients catches... FULL LIMITS of course...I watched as He removed what He called the ""wishbones"" and, of course, the cheeks...We keep em nowdays when We are group fishing, just to give everyone more vittles to munch on..."
5327729,WallyWarrior,2017-02-11 20:03:00,2488,"Just a question, technically, are you not over your possession by saving up the ""wings"" all year long? Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
