Has technology improved in the last 3+ years? Anyone have a good garman map, product they prefer for Lac Seul."

5344209,Pooch,2017-02-20 10:09:00,4618,"I'm running a six year or more old Navionics on my Lowrance and it does a decent job around McKenzie Bay area. I have ran across a couple shallower than I thought areas when running down the middle though.If you PM me I could send you a small map of the area's that are not shown on the Navionics chip that deserve some respect. I don't fish that area often, so most of what I have was handed down to me by those who do fish that area.Hire pro1800 for a day and pick his brain about areas that could cause problems for you.Pooch"
