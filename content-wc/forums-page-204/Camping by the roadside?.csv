5324601,Clairebear,2017-02-10 06:31:00,937,"Shellback, I'm an Ontario resident and nearly every summer day I see travellers in campers and motor-homes parked in Wal-Mart parking lots for the night. I've also seen cyclers chain there bikes to trees and pitch a small tent on the grassy areas surrounding these same parking lots. No one ever seems to get harassed by police. Maybe not your style of camping but in a pinch might be an option. Safe trip."
5324801,Shellback,2017-02-10 08:27:00,8083,"Thanks for all the info. I've got a couple Provincial Parks picked out. But the roadside option for me is an alternative. Being retired and towing my boat, I like to drive on clear days. If rain is called for on my scheduled day of travel, I just move the trip forward or backwards. Knowing if need be, I can camp roadside, I won't worry so much about reservations."
5325513,Guest,2017-02-10 13:12:00,0,"I have stayed at Chutes Prov park a few times , it is actually in the town of Massey Ontario , and it is five minutes off the highway 17 (turn right at the only streetlight in Massey) Massey is about one hour west of Sudbury . I guess you could stay on the highway, but transport noise will be running all night ! Chutes is nice quiet spot even bathrooms and showers , I suspect for a no electricity spot might be $30 bucks"
5325609,Shellback,2017-02-10 14:09:00,8083,"Chutes will be my choice for my second nights stay. Bon Echo will be for my first night. Once they open for the season I'll be calling and see if they book up fast. Planning on a Sun and Mon night stay. If anything like the campgrounds in the states, most have Sun through Thurs openings, Fri and Sat book fast."
5325841,Clairebear,2017-02-10 16:09:00,937,"One more bit of info for you and all travellers, Canada celebrates it's 150th this year and ALL Federal Parks and locks are FREE admission. All year."
5325897,Shellback,2017-02-10 17:06:00,8083,"I read that, and hope it's just daily visitor admission. If it includes camping, I'm probably SOL for getting a campsite."
5326169,youngknight,2017-02-10 21:24:00,228,"No issue there. Yes, just day passes and second...only our national parks...not Bon echo or chutes which are Ontario provincial parks. If ou are planning on staying on a summer weekend you may want to make reservations...at least at Bon echo...not a huge campground. Go on Ontario parks website to see maps of operating parks and details on spots and reservations. Was surprised about your plans for Bon echo when I thought you said you would be going by Ottawa..couple hous out of the way from Ottawa to Sudbury."
5326385,Shellback,2017-02-11 06:15:00,8083,"I was just using Ottawa as a reference coming across 17. I come up from PA and cross at the Thousand Islands, I'll then run 401 to Napanee, then 41 north to Bon Echo. I was by Bon Echo last Sept on a trip to Stone Cliff. I spend about 2 weeks each June and another 2 weeks each Sept in Gananoque. I have a cabin booked for July 15th in Chapleau area for a week. That was all that was available. But they do have camping, so I plan to arrive 4 or 5 days early and camp, then finish off in the cabin. Gotta keep the wife happy!Wasn't the Rideau system free last year? Will it be again this year too?"
5320281,Shellback,2017-02-08 07:43:00,8083,"When I traveled from Soo up through Wawa 2 years ago, It looked as though some folks just camped overnite at the roadside pull offs. Is that legal? I'll be traveling across 17 from the Ottawa area to Chapleau this July, and have been looking for an overnite campsite in the Sudbury area. I'm not finding anything that seems close to 17, those that are seasonal places. I could take my chances and hope to find a place while on the road, but if push comes to shove, I'm wondering about the option of just pulling off at a rest area. I'll have a slide in truck camper with boat in tow. I'd like to find a nice campground within 5 miles or so of 17 if anyone is familiar with the area."
5320353,Obabikon,2017-02-08 08:10:00,2370,"I do not know the answer to this. However, this summer on two different occasions I saw people camping on HWY 11 (on the US side). They had their boats parked on the shore. I was kind of wondering if that was legal also."
5320745,Richard B,2017-02-08 10:15:00,735,Shellback - About an 1 1/2 hours west of Sudbury is Chutes Provincal park. It is right of 17 and close to Spanish. Looks nice. http://www.ontarioparks.com/park/chutes/camping
5320825,Shellback,2017-02-08 10:52:00,8083,"Thanks for that info. Would add the 1 1/2 hours to my day driving, but shorten the next day."
5321705,Bill Krejca,2017-02-08 17:56:00,6107,"I don't know the answer. I do have a plethora of experience sleeping in the vehicle on the side of a Canadian or Minnesota road, in a convenience store lot, even in the parking lot of the Fort Frances Travel Bureau. Never have been told to leave. Bill"
5322617,Baseline,2017-02-09 07:33:00,3207,"I've been traveling around NW Ontario for years. I've seen lots of people with campers pulled over at waysides and pull offs grabbing a few ZZZ's. Probably not legal, but the OPP doesn't seem to have enforcement of this as a priority."
5323505,Fisherman1792,2017-02-09 14:40:00,927,Shellback Perfectly legal to pull over in a rest area and catch a few zzzzs. That's what they are there for. You can even use the snow plowing truck turn around areas in the summer with no problems. Mind you they are along the highway so some road noise. You just can't set up camp and stay for an extended period of time. We would much rather have people pull over and rest than try to keep driving while very tired. Nothing worse than having the highway shut down because someone fell asleep at the wheel. It happens quite a bit up here. I've pulled over a few times myself. Drive safe! You wanna get to where your going in one piece. Fisherman 1792
