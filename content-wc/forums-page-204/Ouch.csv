I have no problem with steep fines for violations. Confiscation of boats and fishing gear should be reserved for extreme cases IMO but, if you can't pay the fine, don't do the crime."
5322945,stumcfar,2017-02-09 10:10:00,451,"I am lucky enough to live close to the Minnesota/Manitoba end of LOW, so I get plenty of walleyes to take home, so bringing fish home from our annual Ontario trip is not that important. I understand that for some people this is their only trip and they want to bring some home for the family. I don't care how far you drive or how much you spend, you are only entitled to take what the law says. We do usually bring a limit of fish home for some of the guys to share with family but it is on the last day that we keep them. We do eat some each day for shore lunch, except our last day we have brats etc. and then keep limits to bring back to camp. The trip is about the experience and catching and the keeping of fish I would think is secondary for most."
5323857,HeHooksHimself,2017-02-09 18:35:00,725,"I have no problem with them sticking it to these guys, but one time when we were stopped at a checkpoint, I am glad to MNR agent had some level of compassion. I was in charge of making sure our fish count was accurate and the four of us planned things well so we could bring our limit home. Sure enough, about 20 km out of FF there is a checkpoint. Not unusual, especially since it was the end of opening week. It was my truck, so of course we pull out our licenses and the cooler and wait for the officer to go through his drill. While he was doing his thing we we enjoying our last cigar in Canada and thinking about getting across the border. It seems to be taking longer than usual and the officer comes up to the truck and says, ""Gentlemen, I keep coming up with 17."" I respond ""No way, I counted them 20 times!"" He says, well someone come and count them with me."" At this point, all my buddies get very interested in the dandelions on the side of the road and since it was my truck, I volunteered to count them with him. Sure enough there were 17. He said, ""who wants to take responsibility for this,"" at which point the dandelions captured even more interest. As it turns out, he realized that we were not trying to get away with anything, but since our individual packages has frozen together we had inadvertently taken an extra walleye. I was fined $260.00 and my limit was confiscated. He told me if we were five over, he would have taken everything we had, including the truck. I am not allowed to be the fish counter any more."
5324313,pjshorthorn,2017-02-09 21:35:00,5654,"Back in the late 90s I was fishing with my Dad one afternoon around the Chamberlain Narrows area on Lac Seul. Dad hooks into a nice fish and as it turns out , it is a pretty big walleye that was well over the slot...probably a 26 or 27"" fish. Mind you, this was a time in our fishing progression where any of us rarely thought about that it may not be a good idea keeping a fish over the slot. So as Dad is unhooking this fish, he says ""this will be really good for dinner tonight "". Time stood still for me as I heard him say those words and my mind was racing trying to process what we had on the stringer and back at camp. I said to him that he already kept his one fish over the slot and he had to throw it back. Then the fun began as he said nope, keeping it for dinner. I then proceeded to undress him with a lot of things I probably shouldn't have said,but he finally got the message when I mentioned that he could buy me a new boat, gear and car if we got checked between the time we got back to camp and the time he ate the fish by himself. He reluctantly released the fish and he was sure not to ask about keeping another over the slot fish the rest of the trip. It has been too many years to be sure ,but we may have not kept another over the slot fish on any of our subsequent trips. One thing I am sure of is that I have never wore my Dad out on other trips like I did that day. PjShorthorn"
5324553,bigwalleye1,2017-02-10 06:08:00,2632,"Back about that same time period, the walleye bite was really strong on Mille Lacs, and I've always been a catch and release fisherman for those ""overs"", even when the law allowed us to keep one. Dad was up, hooks into a really good fish, similarly, wants to keep it for dinner. Try as I might, he insisted. Sure, the law allows him one ""over"" so this is it. He insisted also, despite my urgings about the little ones tasting better, that he could eat the whole thing. Okey Dokey. Cleaned it, separated it out from my little 15s and 16s and started frying. Gave the big fillets to Pop. He's going at it like a fat chick on a double cheese pizza, and I slipped a well-chosen 15 in fillet in front of him... needless to say, he had a hard time finishing the big one after that. I think that day convinced him the big ones are for catchin', lookin' at, and lettin' go, and the littler ones are for eating."
5333329,Iowa4ND,2017-02-14 12:15:00,35,With 14 of us going this year and my truck being one of the transport vehicles I am going to lobby to enjoy our one fish at shore lunches during the week and one or two dinners and that's it. We bring enough good food that no-one has to feel they need to catch fish to survive the week. And with 4-5 first timers I don't want to spend a ridiculous amount of time tracking numbers in the freezer. Satisfying your walleye/pike addiction is a good excuse for going back again.
5333817,Aspencreek,2017-02-14 15:20:00,2911,"That is what our group does. Everyone knows we are having fish on that particular night, if you can eat 1 or 2 that's all we keep, all day. We only fish for ""take home"" fish on the last day. And if you don't get your limit on the last day ......well, you go home short, they sell fillets at the border anyway. If you are the group leader, you get to call the shots. BTW, make sure if you are traveling in several vehicles, make sure each vehicle is carrying the fillets for the people in it. You hear about groups in a couple vehicles with only one truck holding the cooler!"

5320681,Juls,2017-02-08 10:00:00,13414,"They have to make it hurt, or everyone would just take over limits and pay small fines if they got caught. Maybe this way, more people will be more willing to stick to the limits."
5320761,Pooch,2017-02-08 10:19:00,4618,I agree with Juls 100%.Pooch
5320793,eyemike,2017-02-08 10:40:00,233,couldn't agree more.
5320929,middle son,2017-02-08 11:29:00,15,I'm not arguing with it in any way; just sayin' ..... ouch. We always play by the rules - then you've got nothing to worry about.
5321521,Low4fish,2017-02-08 16:47:00,37,"Glad to see this happening. As someone that has lived on LOW most of my adult life, the change to catch and release and serious enforcement has made fishing better for everyone. I know it's expensive to travel and you want to keep more fish but we all pay for that mentality. Kudos to the fish management folks for the good work they are doing. I now do not have to trailer to other lakes because LOW fishing is so poor.Sent from my SM-T800 using Tapatalk"
5321569,Aspencreek,2017-02-08 17:08:00,2911,"You travel all the way from Boston to fish Eagle and you either don't know the regs, or decide to run by your own set of rules. They got exactly what they should have. A few years ago a group from Chicago came into camp and decided the rules didn't apply to them too. After 2 days everybody knew they had way over the limit, so on tues night they were met at the dock by the OPP, who tossed their cabin and for the group were way over limit. They were turned in by the camp owner, who helped them pack up, and kicked them out. But not without a very large fine and a court date."
5322641,pjshorthorn,2017-02-09 07:49:00,5654,"I would have supported these guys losing their gear and boat , if they owned one, on top of the fines. Knuckleheads in the news. PjShorthorn"
5322753,LOW1,2017-02-09 08:32:00,2828,I think that the media cooperating with the MNR in publicizing these arrests and fines is also very important and helpful. We can debate what the law should be but everyone should be aware that the penalties are stiff.
