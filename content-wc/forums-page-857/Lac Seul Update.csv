533539,Jigger1,2003-07-16 14:28:00,234,"Dave, Our group fished the SE section of LacSeul for 4.5 days from June 28-July 2, our group of eight caught and released 528 walleyes over 18. The big fish were 28, 28.25, 29.25 and 31, with the exception of a few caught on crankbaits and jigs, we caught the majority using bottom bouncers with a combination of crawlers, power worms, and minnows. I personally only used crawlers and power worms. Fish were found in a wide range from 6' to 30', the 29.25 was caught in 24 feet and the 31 in 14 feet of water. The lake was down about 6'-7', had no effect on the fishing, but gave the lake a whole new look. The only comment is we were fishing some spots that are typically not fished until August, so the lake is significantly ahead of schedule. After my fourth year fishing this wonderful body of water I continue to be blown away by the quality of the fishing. Have a great time and I wish I was heading back this year not next. Jigger1"
