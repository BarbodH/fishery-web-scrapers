533415,Stevie B,2003-07-11 11:36:00,157,"If money is no issue than check out Knee Lake, MB. It is probably the number one pike fishery in MB. Dogskin Lake is also a great pike fishery and it is a beautiful place. Dogskin is alot cheaper than Knee and the walleye fishing is the best that I have ever experienced. Both are fly-in. One thing to keep in mind is that most great walleye fisheries are also great pike places too. They are almost always together. If you find the walleye's the pike usually aren't too far away. Fish ON!!"

533421,ggg,2003-07-11 19:07:00,115,"I am leaving for Flett Lake in th N.W.T. in 16 days with North of Sixty Camps. We are told it is a ""Trophy"" pike lake with many fish in the 20s, 30s and even some 40+. Largest pike caught last year was said to be 47 lbs. This is my first trip up there and I would be happy to give you a report upon my return on 8-5-03."
533435,Guest,2003-07-13 11:11:00,0,ggg If the camp you are going to has told you they catch many 30 pound pike in a season I would seriously look into geting a refund and looking for another camp.A true 30 lb pike is a fish of a life time and most anglers fishing the best pike waters in north america never reach that threshold.As for the 47 lb pike of last season I think they may have meant 47 inches which would be about 25 to 26 lbs. Will be anxious to read the results of your trip. Atlanta Dave
533444,Guest,2003-07-13 20:48:00,0,Thanks for all the help guys. We need a lake that two of us can go to for under $2500 for the week. The places suggested so far are over that....any help would be appreciated.
533449,Guest,2003-07-14 06:34:00,0,"I know a group of guys that go to Knee Lake also, and they do catch some nice fish( trophy pike). But yes they do have a price. Maybe your wife will help save some money. Go 1st class, if you can. P.S. I have seen the photos of these fish also."
533450,Guest,2003-07-14 06:35:00,0,"James, E-mail me and I can give you some info. on what you are looking for. I would rather have you e-mail me than spam the board with free adveritising as I don't like it when lodge operators do it so I won't. I am very confident that the place I work with in Manitoba has what you want. Great trophy pike fishing (between me and my buddy we had 14 fish over 42"" with the largest being 46.5 in June- 03). They are located near knee lake but are much less expensive and I think better trophy pike fishing. My e-mail is [email protected]. Either way good luck and I hope you find the perfect place!!"
533458,Guest,2003-07-14 09:46:00,0,Check out viking lodge in Cranberry portage. Been going there for several years and should be in your price range.
533526,Guest,2003-07-16 07:01:00,0,Dont forget to consider Lac Seul. It not only will give you some nice Pike it also will give up some awesome Walleye fishing.
