533475,Guest,2003-07-14 19:25:00,0,What exactly is a blue walleye? I have seen some discussion on this board in the past and was wanting more details. Is it a rare genetic trait or something else? I just returned from a fly-in around Sioux Lookout and caught one walleye that had a very blue tint along its back and dosal fins. Any info would be appreciated.

People agree they exist, but no one seems to know for sure if they are a seperate species. You can find some interesting things about them if you use a search engine."
