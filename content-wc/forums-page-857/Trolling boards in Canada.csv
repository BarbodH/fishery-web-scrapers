In asking for advice on the ""strictly fishing"" board it was suggested I consider using boards. I want to learn how to do that but in all my 25 years of fishing Ontario I've not seen boards being used. (I've not been on LOTW or LacSuel) Are there regulations against it or are they just not neccessary? (or maybe I've just missed them)"
533446,Guest,2003-07-13 21:39:00,0,"You can only use one rod per person. That might be a consideration on how you fish. I personally think fishing that way is BORING. We just got back from Lac Seul (I had never been there before) and we slow trolled w/the bait on the bottom (spinner rig w/split shot and leech or minnow) ALL DAY. I would get up early and fish by myself for 1-2 hrs so I could cast and retrieve and catch fish the way I enjoy the most. On Lac Seul, you could catch fish with your arms tied behind you and a piece of string w/a paper clip tied to your little toe."

Reseting boards each time you make a pass across a point or along a small island is to much fooling around in most cases. Fishing two to a boat and using long (7 1/2 foot or longer rods) you can get your baits away from the boat without the boards. If you are fishing a basin or other large area, or are fishing with more than two to a boat boards would help to keep the baits separated."
533463,2746,2003-07-14 13:32:00,3206,"Thanks for the help...I expect the limit of one rod does have an affect and, I too, thought a longer rod would work. What are you using for a longer rod? I've been looking at the cabela 8.5' trolling rods."
533471,Guest,2003-07-14 16:39:00,0,Sensitivity is the key for the light biters. The noodle trolling rods wouldn't be my first choice there. We fished on Lac Seul in 3-4' of water at times. My cousin was using his 125 Merc and 6 1/2' rod and they were catching as many fish as us. It is hard for me to figure out but the fish (at least there) weren't spooking w/the motor noise.
533472,Reels,2003-07-14 16:55:00,2876,"We use boards when fishing for suspended fish. Water maybe 120' fish down around 20-30. Boards seem to work better than long lining. Best part about it, you dont catch any dinks that way. Most are quality fish with some trophies. The ten pounder club has Anita Burkholder (IAMWALLEYE1's wife) with a 10 caught on a board~ <{{}}><"
533486,Guest,2003-07-15 00:25:00,0,"Rebelrn: I had the same problem. Buddies wanted to troll and I wanted to spincast. So what I did was I went to the front of the boat and started casting along the weedbeds. I would cast out at about 11 o'clock and use a fast retreave. As the boat caught up to the lure, and it was 10 o'clock I slowed down and at nine I stopped and let the lure drift behind the boat. If no hits then recast same as before. I used this many times and often wondered how often I brought them out of the reeds and their lures came up behind them and got hits. Dave"

The Cabelas E-glass rods in a medium action also sound like an excellant rod for trolling. I prefer these glass rods as they are not as stiff as the graphite rods and give a little when the fish strikes. With graphite and super lines you can get the rip lip effect and loose fish much easier than with the glass. Another problem I have had with the graphite comes in cold weather. We fish in the Atikokan area in late fall, sometimes with heavy frost or snow in the morning, and I have had graphite disintegrate when a nice size northern smacks the lure under these cold conditions. I am using the Eagle Claw 7 1/2' ""casting"" rods at this time."
