The fishing is great, the food is great, and the people are wonderful. The only downside is the gravel road to the camp. It takes about 20 minutes from 71 without a boat, it might take a little longer with a boat. Check out the site. witchbay.com. I highly recommend it. I went there for the first time the second week in July."
533466,bronzeback77,2003-07-14 13:36:00,97,"I would recommend White Pine Lodge on Lake of the Woods. It is located near Sioux Narrows on Snake Bay, just 10 minutes from Whitefish. It is a drive in lodge but is very secluded (located 1 mile off the main road and on it own large peninsula). I have been up six years in a row and have had a wonderful time each year. Many of the guest have been coming 10,20 even 40 years in a row. They have very good American and Housekeeping packages for people who bring up their own boat. All of the cabins have Satellite Television for the girls incase they get sick of fishing, plus a beach and water trampoline. Their website is www.whitepinelodge.ca or if you have any other questions email me at [email protected]. My wife and I caught over 400 Bass this past year when we were up and I am sure we will do just as well next year"
533520,Gary_IA,2003-07-15 18:56:00,144,Witch Bay sure has appeal and its close to Kenora. I like Kenora's lakeside park and Voyageurs Museum-a nice place for a break from fishing.
533373,Guest,2003-07-09 15:25:00,0,any info would be great... every one likes to fish and have fun. house keeping from red lake to the border thanks for your time wayne web sites would be great
533376,Guest,2003-07-09 16:09:00,0,"Weavers Wilderness Camp Gullrock South of Red Lake Normally excellent fishing Great camp, nice cabins, clean E-mail if you would like more info [email protected]"
533383,Guest,2003-07-09 23:59:00,0,I would look up on the web the sioux narrows tourist information or ear falls information. lac saul can be a rough lake and we have caught only walleyes and northerns. the fishing is pretty good there. Lake of the woods around sioux narrows is broken up real good by islands so the water does not get very rough when its windy. generally it seems that the cost will be around 700 US with your own boat at a decent place. A lot of places have good web sites that show the camp and cabins and prices. For the first time i dont know if i would want to haul a boat real far into canada. the fishing is probably pretty good no matter where you go although with the low water all over you might be careful with your boat. red lake is the end of the pavement and even ear falls from the border is probably a 6 hour drive. sioux narrows is about a 3 hour drive. i am sure if i am wrong someone will correct me. good luck. You should go to the all canada show and get brochures from everyone although the show only represents about 20% of the camps in canada maybe. OK good luck
533385,Trailerguy,2003-07-10 05:24:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Ear Falls is not a 6 hour drive from the border. I regularly make Perrualt Falls in 2 3/4 hrs, with Ear Falls being 35 miles up the road. There are many lakes and resorts in that area. Try www.justfishontario.com I'm sure you can find something you like. :)"
533386,Guest,2003-07-10 05:40:00,0,"There are so many great places in Canada. I'll mention a couple of them below. I have no ownership nor other interest of any kind nor do I have any friends or relatives that have any ownership or interest in any Canadian resorts. A number of years ago, my brother and I took two young nieces to Ballantynes Indian Lake Lodge near Vermilion Bay, Ontario. This is part of a chain of lakes. The cabins were the nicest I've stayed at and it was near town (great when we wanted a break from fishing.) There are no northern pike in the system but it has a good reputation for muskies. There are other resorts on the lake system-Clark's Camp is one. You can catch Walleyes but you have to be knowledgeable and pay attention to structure. My brother stayed at Camp Wenasaga just north of Ear Falls. I believe this is a one resort lake-about 8 miles long. It is fed by the Wenasaga River and the lake empties into Lac Seul. I believe your boat is limited to the lake. and there is a boat launce. Try:http://www.wenasaga.com Wenasaga is a good Walleye Lake."
533391,Bob G2,2003-07-10 09:49:00,172,"I had a good time last year at Red Indian Lodge. All the prices were upfront, and they have a boat owners package that includes unlimited gas and bait, and docking for one daily fee. They are located on the clearest part of LOW, have a nice beach w/ paddleboats, canoes, swim platform, minigolf, bikes, tennis and basketball court and a rec room for rainy days. It's American Plan, and that was well appreciated by my wife. Nice place."
533394,2746,2003-07-10 11:20:00,3206,"Five Lakes Lodge on Gullrock just 10 minutes south of Red Lake. Good fishing, clean facilities and an easy drive into Red Lake if you want to eat out, play golf or just visit the town for a diversion. I take my wife there and have seen several other family units there (not just guys)"
533396,Guest,2003-07-10 11:48:00,0,"There are some associations for lodges that could give you many links and web sites. One that I've used over the years is NOTO, Northern Ontario Tourism Organization. It divides Ontario into regions and organizes within the region. The website is: http://www.noto.net/"
533406,Guest,2003-07-11 05:37:00,0,"Check out Eagle Lake Sportsmen's Lodge. IT is on the West arm of the lake. It is 2 hours north of the border, close to town. 807-227-5318."
533419,Guest,2003-07-11 15:23:00,0,"Hey wb, Try www.tuesdaysresort.com, very clean quiet camp, no crowds here, only 6 cabins, 6 miles to Kenora. Good roads all the way up. If you need some lake [email protected]"
