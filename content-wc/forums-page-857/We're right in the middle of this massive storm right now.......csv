533483,Mahumba,2003-07-14 21:37:00,345,I hope everyone in N.W. Ontario is fairing ok right now. I'm just west of Thunder bay and we got some good sized hail and some wicked winds. I was just wondering is anyone saw any tornados touch down? Thundering and lightening and pouring out right now. Roger Mayer.
