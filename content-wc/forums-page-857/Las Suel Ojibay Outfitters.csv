My opinion is that Ken and Brenda run a very good camp. It is clean, they have a store for convenience including bait, licenses, munchies, tackle and of course..beer. The employees are very curtious and helpful. The fishing is very good. As far as price, compare and make your own conclusion. Beside the cabin, you also must pay a fee to use the boat launch ($15) and a fee for vehicle security ($50). Gas is something to consider also if you take your own boat in. All in all a nice place to go to relax and fish and have some fun!! This is my opinion. I do not endorse Ojibway outfitters in any way. I am only talking about my own experience the one time I was there. Whitetip1"

533427,Stillwater,2003-07-12 13:56:00,87,The vehicle security fee is rather new. It means that someone will occasionly check on your car when it is sitting at a public launch for the 4 to 7 days that you are out staying at Chamberlain Narrows. I too leave all my equipment in the boat when it is tied up at the dock right next to me. Scott

At the time Ken's son was at the outpost and experiencing some, ... some, how can I say this nicely, some growing pains along with other staff members as well. There was a teepee being used as a relaxation facility for some of the staff. After ward, with some really road-mapped eye's, there was some interesting boat racing taking place around the docks. Quite facinating really.(NOT!) Brenda was not at all pleased nor was Ken, but that didn't change things during the course of the week. Needless to say it didn't sit well the guys I was with and certainly didn't impress me! Hence we've never returned. Service there was less than helpful, as the camp manager had left for the week. Also, FHS group was there and we became second class citizens. When we requested either bait to be delivered or tried to get gas it was like pulling teeth. I also had a quart of 2stroke oil dumped into my musky box, that I've never really been able to get out. Getting a light bulb to replace the one out in our cabin took two days of nagging. On the brite side however, the fishing is / was fantastic. Lot's of eyes both in the slot and over. Nice pike and great musky too. I'm glad to hear things up there have gotten together. That might make me want to return because the fishing is awesome but I don't need the headache again. As a side note one of the outposts formerly owned by Ojibway - Tom's Landing is now owned by Anderson's and they also have another outpost further up the lake. That is where we intend to visit next season. Good luck."

533459,whitetip1,2003-07-14 11:11:00,53,"The Andersons outpost that burned was to the south by one of the narrows, can't remember the name (started with a K i think). The one north of Chamberlain was closed for a spell but was open while I was there the end on June. That one was close the fire but did not burn."
533469,eyeman_1,2003-07-14 15:46:00,690,I think the one your talking about is called Kekabecka(sp)Narrows. That's a shame as that place looked like a great location to stay as well.
