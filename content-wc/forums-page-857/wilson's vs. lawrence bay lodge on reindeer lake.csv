533468,Guest,2003-07-14 15:17:00,0,RE: Arctic Lodges questions - Arctic Lodges has been sold as of March/03 from Linda Lockhardt; I am one of the partners. The lake does get some commercial fishing pressure mid July but given its size (200 miles long) it does not amount to much. All larger camps are catch and release. Check us out on the web at www.arcticlodges.com.
519016,Guest,2002-04-06 18:43:00,0,any input on these 2 lodges on reindeer lake? thanks
519017,ggg,2002-04-06 19:45:00,115,"Stayed at Lawerence Bay about 10 years ago. Great cabins, good guides and great fishing. The one thing that realy stands out in my mind was great customer service and WOW, GREAT food. Randy and his staff really went out of their way to make sure that everyone was happy every day. That started with coffee delivered to your cabin at wake up, to customizing any type of trip for the day that you wanted.Have a good time ! I can't wait to get back."

519020,Guest,2002-04-25 08:15:00,0,"haven't been to either, but have been to Arctic Lodge a couple of years age. the owner died and I think it was sold. it's located in about the center of the lake.I recommend you go to a lodge as far north as possible, cause that's where the best fishing is. Good Luck"
519023,Guest,2002-05-07 19:10:00,0,"I have used both Lawrence Bay Lodge and Reindeer Lake Trout Camp, don't let them tell you they fish different locations on this lake, because they don't. If you like to follow a schedule, example (get up at 6:00am,Eat at 7:00am, Start fishing at 8:00am, Shore lunch at 12:00pm,Get done fishing at 5:00pm, and Evening meal at 6:00pm. They both offer the same package. However, if you like adventure and a real fishing experience forget this boring lodge life and take an outpost lake. I guarantee you will be back for more. Reindeer Lake is beautiful but it's SHOT. Many of the fish caught have been previous release's and all tore up by the native guides."

519024,Northern Manitoban,2002-05-08 21:26:00,195,Previuos releases in a big body of water like that? hmmm?
519022,whitey,2002-05-09 07:19:00,36,"sonofagunder:fred died about 6 years ago. the lodge didn't open that year, but did open the following year. I haven't heard a thing from them since. Did hear that the wife was asking $1 million for the place. The place was really run down the last year we were there ( 1997) but we had a great time and i caught my biggest pike 22 lbs."
