533438,2746,2003-07-13 17:44:00,3206,"sorry your not getting any responses. I was up for the opener but that is not much help. Lake was 4' low and I don't think, from my conversations with the lodge since, that has changed much. This spring we experienced both good numbers and size of fish...Eagle seems to improve each year for us. Other years when we have gone in late July-early Aug fish have been in 25' of water off points and over sunken Islands as well as in shore line weeds close to deep water. Spinners or cranks on the deep fish and jigs/minnows in the weeds."
533473,Guest,2003-07-14 19:00:00,0,"Thanks for the info. I will take what I get on Eagle. It seems like alot of negative feedback due to the access and number of lodges on the lake and fishing pressure. If anyone can help with the summer patterns, I would appreciate it!"
533479,Reels,2003-07-14 20:19:00,2876,This will clue you in some.http://www.andymyerslodge.com/reports.htm Have fun! <{{}}><
533494,Guest,2003-07-15 08:19:00,0,"Been going up here for a number of years now. I fish out of south shore lodge. Key to the area around here, is crawler harnesses with small orange spinners. I'm going up this coming weekend. Fish will probably be in deeper water relating to the reefs (which are plentiful and hazardous). Dont forget about the bays which have weed edges, last year we found a bay that we ended up getting 20 to 30 fish a day by casting our harnasses like a carolina rig. I have pulled cranks in the past toward evening, the pike are so plentiful that is mainly what you catch. There is no shortage of fish on this lake, my biggest being 27in 7#'s. Plenty of 24/25 inch fish."
533495,Guest,2003-07-15 08:51:00,0,"Shemya- I stay at Pine Beach lodge and probably fish the same area's you do. Heard the water is way down this year, approx 3 feet. I don't think I've ever seen it that low in the 23 yrs I've been going up there. We mainly fish plain hooks on Lindy rigs and usually do better on leeches. And as you said, you can find them in bays or in deeper water. Last year we nailed the smaller eating sized fish (15-17"") in 7-10 ft of water. All the bigger fish (25-29"") seemed to come off deeper structure. I'm heading up 7/26 and staying for 2 weeks. Can't get here soon enough!! Good Luck"
533496,Guest,2003-07-15 09:58:00,0,"Fraz, Sure Eagle gets negative press, but I believe it is one of the best walleye lakes/systems out there. The largest walleye in our group came a couple years ago. I had my cousins wife out and she caught a 33"" 13 3/4 pound hawg! And that's not a fluke. We catch a number of 27-29"" fish every year and it's not uncommon for someone to catch one up to 31 inches. The lake holds some VERY large fish with numerous fish in the 24-26 inch range. The slot limit and night ban has done wonders on that lake. Bring plenty of leeches and crawlers along and start by getting yourself a map (I believe hots spots puts one out). It will give you a general idea of some of the most popular spots. But the lake is loaded with reefs, points and bays that hold fish. My rule of thumb is if your not marking fish move. There are so many spots to try don't pound one to death if it's not producing. But keep coming back to spots, they can be there one minute and gone another. Try fishing reefs from the tops to about 30ft off the edges. Also give the bays and weed edges a try. We usually fish Lindy rigs with about a 3 foot snell with colored hooks or a plan hook with a bead. I usually staly light on the wt... about 3/8 ounce. If the wind is blowing, give the points or islands a try since they tend to hold a good number of fish when the waves are crashing in."

We fished mostly Muskeg, Blind and Bottle bays and the depth off my sonar was never more than 4 feet, even in the main basin of the bays. Caught most of our fish in depths of 3'. Will be interesting to see if the fish have stayed in those bays as the temps rise this summer. Water was down enough that even loading and unloading the boats was a challenge. Rick has poured new cement but does not go far enough to float the boat off the trailer. (maybe they have got some rain and water levels have risen) Watch the rocks...there are certainly some new ones we have never seen before. On the positive side fishing was good and the size seems to improve every year."
533511,Guest,2003-07-15 15:15:00,0,"I will be at South Shore this weekend. We will get in about 6:00 PM. Look for a Lund 1775. Would love to meet ya and possibly play some cards and trade fishing stories. I will have my one buddy along. The rest have small kids and will not be going for a while. I'll buy you some beers for some tips. I do have a fishing hot spots map. It has been 7 years, but we went in June last time. Do you chase smallies at all. They are my favorite gamefish and I think Eagle does have some big ones."
533518,Guest,2003-07-15 17:15:00,0,The last remark was from Fraz to Shemya. Sorry for confusion. I am mentally already fishing!
