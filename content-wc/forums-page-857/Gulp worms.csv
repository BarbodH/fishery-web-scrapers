533480,Trailerguy,2003-07-14 20:20:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]There is a mills fleet farm in Mason City that has some. Although they have sold out of some types.
533402,Mo Fisher,2003-07-10 22:38:00,21,Was wondering if anyone has been having any luck using these worms by Berkley. Will be trying them for the first time next week on Pakwash Lake in NWO. Thanks

533405,fishman,2003-07-11 05:05:00,60,"Tried the Gulp red worms with the grandkids for sun fish and as far as I can tell, it was as good as regular nightcrawlers. I am going to try Gulp Nightcrawlers in Canada in two weeks to see how they do."
533410,McQ,2003-07-11 09:12:00,615,I've got some samples coming my way on Monday - will be trying them out in Northern Quebec next Saturday.
533412,elbowlkmb,2003-07-11 09:15:00,7,"I have used Gulp worms bothhere and in Canada. They work fine. Use them full length on harnesses, or pinch them in 1/2 for use on jigs. Good luck"
533439,2746,2003-07-13 17:49:00,3206,What are gulp worms? I'm heading up north in a couple of weeks and was ordering some stuff from Cabelas and also usually take some nightcrawlers. Would these critters be just as good and easier to use? My wife goes along and wouldn't miss the crawlers at all. Where do I look for them in Cabelas cat. or on line?
533440,Trailerguy,2003-07-13 19:08:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]So far I've only found them a Fleet Farm, but some have seen them at Wal Mart. They are a new product from Berkley, and seem to be in limited quanitys so far."
533447,Mo Fisher,2003-07-13 22:08:00,21,I picked up a few packages at Wal Mart. Will try them next week and let you know how they worked.
533451,Larry S,2003-07-14 07:08:00,666,"You can also order them from basspro,cabela's doesn't sell them in their catalog"
533457,McQ,2003-07-14 09:45:00,615,I was with the Pure Fishing (Berkley) rep this morning - picking up some samples. He told me they are shipping to all retailers now! They should be widely available in the coming weeks. I'll give you my thoughts on them when I return from a trip to Northern Quebec on the 25th.
