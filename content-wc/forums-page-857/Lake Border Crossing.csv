533545,balsl6,2003-07-16 18:18:00,426,When are you going up? You can get a remote area b order pass but it takes about a month? Youmight be able to get them in person @ international Falls?? LOTW has remote phones so you can call in? I do not know if Rainy lake has these? If they do not they should have a checkin somewhere? Call the resort you are staying at they should be able to tell you. Good Luck
