The water lever will likely go up as they were talking when we were up there about the record rainfall for June so far in that whole area, espcially Manitoba but I think NW Ontario was getting a LOT of rain too. It rained the first 3 days were were up there and it had rained just about every day the previous week."
549633,WIPP,2005-06-22 17:39:00,75,I didn't think you could camp on Lac Seul. Only stay at a lodge or make day trips? You might want to check this out - hate to see you make the trip and then find out the restrictions.

549637,WIPP,2005-06-22 18:53:00,75,Now I understand. I have been to Chamberlain Narrows 4 times and never have seen a canoe. Lots of fire damage from 2 years ago in the area you are talking about I believe.
549644,Guest,2005-06-22 20:44:00,0,"How bad was the fire damage, and how extensive? Do you go to Chamberlain from Deception or Bindo, and other than beaches, are there very many suitable camping spots along the way? I'd imagine that Loon Rapids is rather swift right now with the higher water? Any swift water from Bindo to Sen Bay (like in Zig Zag?)? I don't imagine that too many people canoe on Lac Seul; weather's too variable on such a large lake, potentially very rough, a long way to come for a short trip, a long way to go to get anywhere, etc. There IS an old established canoe route from Lake St. Joseph/Root River, all the way to Ear Falls, with a, get this, EXTENSION into the English River system. A lotta big water there, and hard to find a month to do it properly, with the inevitable ""weather day"" delays. Thanks, SC"
549666,WIPP,2005-06-23 09:25:00,75,"We go from deception landing to Chamberlain. The fire damage was extensive between those two points on a map. Not sure about Bindo, but it is between those points. The fire damage is visible along the north side of deception bay. We also saw alot on the southwest side of Scaler. Fire came to within 1/4 mile of Chamberlain Narrows to the south. Numerous water drops and a weather/wind change saved the camp. The boat route we take kind of goes around the damage. I am not familiar with Loon rapids, though we go through Manitou rapids easily. This is the only fast water we see going in. There are lots of areas to land along the way. We have been there in low water and high."
