I have purchased them from a catalog store by the name of Hagen's. But, you need to buy in relatively large quantities. I split the order with a friend. Try this web site: http://www.hagensfish.com/new.htm Frankly, I am not sure that they really perform that much better than round head jigs when you consider the additional cost."
