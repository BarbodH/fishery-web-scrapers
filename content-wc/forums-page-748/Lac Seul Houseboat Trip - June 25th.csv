Just got done loading up the vehicle, tarping down the boat - getting ready to pull out at 6 am in the morning. Lac Suel is a long way from Ohio but well worth the trip. Best of luck to you this fishing season. Willie"
549398,BuckeyeWilly,2005-06-16 21:25:00,41,"Hi guys!! Have been reading all the threads this spring concerning Lac Seul and getting more fired up everyday. Can't wait. We have a houseboat (whitewing resort) trip set up beginning on Saturday, June 25th. I have heard about the great fishing up in Broad and Sunlight Lakes but was wondering if its too late in the season for these lakes? Would we do better in say, McKensie Bay (sand banks)? Also looking for any advice from someone who has done the houseboat trip? I've tried to think of everything we might need but might be overlooking the obvious. My wife just retired after 31 years of schoolteaching and we can think of no better way than to be spending it in Canada. Can't help it - its in the blood!! To everyone, good fishing and be safe."

Any rock point/or humps in McKenzie were very good, some days the calmer side was actually better than the windy spots too. We had everyday we were there & never needed to go to broad/sunlight but they were producing some bigger ones than the usual under-slotters @ sunlight we found out. 6-10 feet should still be holding a lot of fish around the rocks. Best #'s of fish I've seen & Lac Seul in my 9 yrs. of going up there. Good luck on your trip!"
549417,Guest,2005-06-17 13:29:00,0,"The sand banks in Mac or the smaller one just south through Ghost Narrows. The mouth of the Narrows can get tricky, watch for the pool table sized rock in the middle of the mouth, it may be under water if the water is as high as reported, 2 years ago it was on dry rockbed. Manitoba point is always a producer, and Rocky point to get out of the wind. I have my special ""Honey Holes"" in South Inlet. You can always find a spot there if the wind is really bad, but the ride back might be rough. In Mac if you get far enough north into the islands the rocky points and islands are good too. Take a camera it's beautiful up there and the mating pairs of loons will sing you to sleep."
549424,BuckeyeWilly,2005-06-17 19:17:00,41,"Hey guys, thanks for the responses. We fished both McKensie and Ghost Narrows in 2003 when we stayed in one of Whitewing's cabins. Sure is a long haul down to these areas - one of the reasons we decided to try the houseboat. I remember the big rock you are talking about in Ghost Narrows. Will definitely watch out for that big boy. Steve, I would never ask you to reveal your ""honey holes"" :>) but I do have one question about South Inlet. I read on another thread somewhere that South Inlet or South Bay had some pretty good smallie action. I love catching walleyes but smallmouths have always been my favorite. Did you fish for smallies in this area or catch them while walleye fishing? Just wondering and thanks again for your info."

549519,Guest,2005-06-20 21:46:00,0,"Sout Inlet smallies, can't get much better than that. But I have not targeted them, always just caught them doing the walleye thing. We boated 6 in about 15 minutes off a rock shelf in South last year, all were 20 to 26"", to bad we didn't have a scale, but we do this year. It seems they live the same place walleyes do, drop offs, rock points, humps and weed edges. I think I just described South Inlet."
549520,Two Tex,2005-06-20 23:10:00,8,"MAY I OFFER A SPOT FOR THE EXTEACHER? WHERE YOU WILL PROBLEY PARK THE HOUSE BOAT,YOU WILL COME BACK ON THE BIG LAKEWITH A ISLAND IN FRONT OF YOU TURN LEFT TOWARDS WINDGO POINT, THE FIRST POINT HAS TWO ISLANDS IN FRONT THIS IS IN FRONT OF MANATOBA POINT ACROSS THE WATER. THE OLD RIVER CHANNEL WILL BE IN FRONT OF YOU , FIND THE DEEP WATER FISH HOW YOU LIKE BACK TO THE ISLANDS. CANT FIND A BIG ONE THERE GO DOWN TO WINDGO POINT, FISH ALONG THE WALL AROUND THE CORNOR AND OUT TOWARDS THE DEEP WATER,SOME TIMES VERY SHOLLOW AND THEN DEEP. THERE ARE SOME BIG FISH IN THIS AREA. ALSO TRY DOWN ON ROCKS AROUND THE ISLANDS, THER IS A BIG SAND FLAT, WITH A DROP OFF, WATCH YOUR FINDER. NOT ALOT NUMBERS BUT I HOPE SOME BIG FISH FOR YOU ALL. THE WIND IS YOUR KEY.GOOD LUCK"
549567,Guest,2005-06-21 12:56:00,0,"Thanks Steve and Tex for responding. Will definitely give both areas a try. How far of a run is it over to South Inlet from where they park the houseboats? Anytime you are talking smallies over 20"" you have my interest. Tex, would you recommend jig and minnow if the walleye are running deeper? Again, appreciate the info. BuckeyeWilly"
549593,rebelrn2001,2005-06-21 22:07:00,1563,"We to Sunlight and Broad on Monday June 13. We were also stopped by a warden. Our experience there and from what the warden said, the fish pretty well had moved out of those lakes into the main lake already. The warden said the spawn was early this year r/t the early ice-out. At the enterance to Broad, there were a LOT of boats catching quite a few small walleyes. That was my first time fishing that area. 2 years ago the water was too low to got there. This year, my wife and I were staying near Dryden and went up for the day and fished w/my cousins and their group. We (4 boats) only got about 100 walleyes all together."
549622,Two Tex,2005-06-22 12:09:00,8,"There are some of the best info on walleye fishing that i have seen on this form, i thank this is great, I fish LC all summer and this form is loted with the right stuff and with people who will share so i to will share, the spots i told you about are big fish area where i have fish and luckly to get some big fish. I will share how I do it, it may not be for every one but here goes. If a was there right now I would be back and forward trolling along the areas mention with 3/8 bullet weight bead ,ball bearing swivle, 2footleader,10 to 15 beads,3to 5/o hook, white grub tail 3 inches, big minnow, if i were after big fish, if looking for avg fish, smaller blads,2/o hooks 18 inch leader. If i had some one fishing with me i would give them a differnt color , until we found fish. Now i would change to a gold jig with or with out a tail 1/4 to 1/2oz. if i can just a leech on a hook 2/o very sharp,18 to 24 inches,one after another. If the big fish are deep on the flats are the rocks, bottom bouncers. better than a three way like we use touse not as many weights lost. I hunt for the big fish. After reading this I know I need the teacher to help with the spellig and typing. I also use worm rigs with white or glow floats, 3 hooks 1/0 big blade when hunting for big fish. regular size looking for numbers. I like to jig but first must find the fish, I have alo used the lures in a perch color , shad rap type, this to will work shallow and deep 20 feet. The answer to how far to south bay , 45 minutes to where the guys are talking about. But watch the wind if your wife doesnot like rough water. but if you have the lodge boat faster. they have good boats. i have fish where they fish and seen the boats. Smallies , yes more now than befoe, if you work at it. Some guys are fishing for smallies more on this side of the lake . Wher the other end has more. But i have caught some big ones fishing for the walleyes. They do fight, On the walleye thing, the artical on the flats explains better than i. its on the home page i guess. I hope this helps this is my way which i found to work. best of luck to you."
