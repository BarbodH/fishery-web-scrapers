549627,Guest,2005-06-22 14:19:00,0,Does anyone have any tips for fishing Kabinakagami Lake. Going to Pine Portage Lodge July 24. Have been there twice but would like to fish some new water. Any tips or good spots to try would be appreciated. Thanks

There are a some memberst that are very familiar with Kabby that frequently post there. I wish I could help you, but I haven't fished Kabby for several years. Chuck"

Also, there are some deeper holes right outside the mouth of Curly's Cove that are generally productive regardless of time of year. Another can't miss area is the ""Shark's Back"" hump near the Breezeway islands. You won't find it named on the map, but if you're not already familiar with it, ask one of the guides and they'll point you there."
