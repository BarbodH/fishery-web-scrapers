Everything they offer is the best. 18 foot Lunds with 50 Merc, depth finder, and trolling motor. They have spotless accomodations, a beautiful lodge with super views of Sabaskong bay, where they serve great meals. The guides that work out of the resort have all been guiding in that area for years and can put you on fish. Did I mention that the lodge is in an area of LOTW that has some of the best fishing for all four top spiecies, and is just a few minutes away from Turtle Portage so you can fish Whitefish Bay for Lakers it you want. My wife and I really enjoyed our stay there and will be going back again. If you book with them, tell Dave and Sheree that Marv and Becky from Clinton sent you! Seriously, if you go, I hope you enjoy as much as we did. If you need more info, e-mail me. ([email protected]) Ia Walihntr"
