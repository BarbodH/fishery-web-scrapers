By Dan Gauthier Miner and News Thursday June 23, 2005 The Ministry of Natural Resources says it has beefed up its enforcement efforts on Lake of the Woods this summer to provide coverage seven days a week. MNR supervisor for the Lake of the Woods Betty Wires said in response to the increasing number of provocative e-mails and reports of improper commercial fishing practices, they will have additional enforcement duty on the lake this summer. We're responding to every incident we are aware of, said Wires. The MNR is concerned about it. MNR resource liaison Scott Lockhart said last year, numerous reports and e-mails including photos of untended gill nets were somewhat exaggerated. He said although enforcement officers investigated each complaint, it was determined that there were only three separate incidents of nets either drifting or untended in different areas of the lake. Lockhart noted the First Nations communities themselves don't sanction these types of unfortunate incidents. There is no organization, First Nation or not, who will condone spoilage, he said. Wires said with the added enforcement coverage on Lake of the Woods this year, they will once again investigate any complaints about commercial nets. However, she stressed the information should be current  not from last season  and be provided in timely manner to be effective. If you have information about something observed, said Wires. You need to tell the MNR."
