549486,bubbalou,2005-06-20 13:26:00,29,Does anyone know if it is legal or illegal to add habitat to lakes in Canada? By habitat I mean dragging fallen trees from the shore out into the lake. I am not talking about cutting trees down but merely dragging trees that have already fallen down out into the lake and then sink them with rocks and such. I see articles in magazines about how to make PVC type cribs and adding them to the lake to increase habitat. Wondering if that would be legal or not also.

The number and species of fish depend on the natural fertility of the lake, and the aquatic life forms required in the food chain. Putting brush in the lake will not help anything. There is already too much wood in most of them. You'll notice the water in most lakes is stained from Tanic acid, which leaches out of the wood, making the water tea brown."
