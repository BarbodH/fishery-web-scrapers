Best bet is to do what the ""experts"" say(my son and niece)...on cloudy days, fish the weedlines with lindys, bait-walkers or cranks. If you're fishing 3 out of a boat doing this, have bow-mate cast ahead with cranks and plugs in the weed pockets and you'll pick up bigger 'eyes and bonus pike...some quite large. Sunny days, fish the deep rock piles/sunken islands. Vertical presentation the best using jigs or slip bobbers...nothing quite as fun as pulling in 22""-26"" eyes using light line and rigs in 20 feet of water on a bluebird day. In a 3 hour period last year we put back 60+ 'eyes over 20""...what a blast!!! Can't wait to get back in August! Have fun and keep safe, Craig"

The early ice out may have affected it for this year. The fish were bigger this year. We had a 26 1/2 and lots of 20-24 inch fish. No problem catching eaters for dinner. The fish are scatered and on most of the wind blown points. we found them in 14-20 ft of water. We mostly jig with minnows on a 3/8 oz jig. We did catch a few on Berkley Gulp 3 inch worms - watermelon color. The first 3 days it rained and we had the best fishing. The last 3 days were hot and calm. 9am to about 1130am were the best fishing times then about 4pm to 6pm in the evening. We stay at Five Lakes Lodge...absolutly the best fishing camp we have ever stayed at. This was our 5th year in a row their and we plan to go their every year. Bud and Malinda are outstanding hosts and their resort is well kept, clean and they try very hard to make your stay enjoyable. Bud will put you on the fish....you just have to ask him. Have a great time fishing. I wish our week was not over for the year but it gives us something to look forward for next year. Good Luck"

Minnows worked the best."

549721,Guest,2005-06-25 06:06:00,0,Doolittle is the point before you get to ranger bay. I think they also call it fishermen point.
