The group, so far dubbed KeepLakeOfTheWoodsGreat.org, is in its infancy and is being spearheaded by Winnipegger Gord Pusnik, a summer resident on Lake of the Woods, and tourist operator Al Smith, who has operated Smith's Camps on Lake of the Woods for the last 35 years. Smith said the group's goal is to preserve the lake's now healthy and abundant game fishery. We believe the most effective method of achieving our goal is by effective management of commercial fishing, said Smith. MNR supervisor for the Lake of the Woods Betty Wires said she is aware of the concerns of Pusnik's group, and the MNR is in favour of a stewardship group for the lake. However, she said they would like to see all lake users represented including First Nations commercial and subsistence interests. I think there is merit in that, said Wires. The more each of the users understand each other's rights the better. According to the group's new website now under construction  which Pusnik says is near completion  the group is a conservation organization consisting of commercial, competitive and recreational anglers, businesses, and taxpayer advocates. The site will keep members up to date on current events surrounding the Lake of the Woods fishery and promotes writing letters to various government agencies stating their concerns. There's a lot of concerned people out there, said Pusnik, adding that it's not just the methods of commercial fishermen, but the sheer numbers of nets that are now being used on Lake of the Woods. It's pretty bad out there in some areas. Tom Mosindy, biologist and supervisor of the MNR's Lake of the Woods Fisheries Assessment Unit, said sport fishing, not commercial fishing, has been responsible for most of the harvest on the lake for the last 10 years. He added that prior to that, commercial fishing was the first form of organized fishing on the lake in addition to First Nation's subsistence fishing that has taken place for centuries. This lake began as a commercial fishing lake and commercial fishing has always had a significant role on the lake in providing jobs and input into the the economy, said Mosindy. Smith said he's seen how poor the fishing was when they first opened the camp in the 1970s before it bounced back when commercial fishing was reduced and is concerned with the MNR now giving some of these retired quotas to First Nations communities on the lake. Beginning in 1983 the MNR began retiring non-native commercial fishing licenses on a voluntary basis and by 2002 all non-native commercial fishing had ceased. I've seen it come back to one of the greatest fisheries in North America, said Smith. Wires said there is a need for discussion amongst the different user groups  First Nations commercial fishermen and sport anglers  on the lake as there is a need to understand each other's concerns. At the end of the day, it's important for people to realize this is a shared fishery, said Wires. According to MNR data, which has been gathered by the Lake of the Woods Fisheries Assessment Unit for the last 20-plus years, sport anglers, both resident and non-resident, on average harvest more sport fish than First Nations commercial and subsistence fishing on Lake of the Woods. For walleye, sport anglers take from 70-80 per cent of the harvested walleye in the northern and eastern areas of the lake. Smith however, doesn't agree with all the MNR data. He says the MNR needs to be more aware of fish taken by commercial nets that are being sold illegally, without proper receipts, and are not being factored into their commercial fishing quotas. Once this happens, Smith said, then sport angling will be on more even footing with commercial fishing. I believe that commercial fishing and tourist resorts can co-exist as long as it does so honestly, fairly and with everything above board, said Smith. And everybody follows the same rules. back"

By Dan Gauthier Miner and News Thursday June 23, 2005 The Ministry of Natural Resources says it has beefed up its enforcement efforts on Lake of the Woods this summer to provide coverage seven days a week. MNR supervisor for the Lake of the Woods Betty Wires said in response to the increasing number of provocative e-mails and reports of improper commercial fishing practices, they will have additional enforcement duty on the lake this summer. We're responding to every incident we are aware of, said Wires. The MNR is concerned about it. MNR resource liaison Scott Lockhart said last year, numerous reports and e-mails including photos of untended gill nets were somewhat exaggerated. He said although enforcement officers investigated each complaint, it was determined that there were only three separate incidents of nets either drifting or untended in different areas of the lake. Lockhart noted the First Nations communities themselves don't sanction these types of unfortunate incidents. There is no organization, First Nation or not, who will condone spoilage, he said. Wires said with the added enforcement coverage on Lake of the Woods this year, they will once again investigate any complaints about commercial nets. However, she stressed the information should be current  not from last season  and be provided in timely manner to be effective. If you have information about something observed, said Wires. You need to tell the MNR. back"
