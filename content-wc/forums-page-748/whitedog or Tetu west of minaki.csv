Looking for smallies, walleyes. and northern. Any replies would be appreciated. There are a lot of posts about Minaki, but don't see any on upper river below whitedog dam up to and past Tetu."
549364,Guest,2005-06-16 05:16:00,0,"The overflow and staging gates at White Dog dam are just about wide open at this time, and the power plant has been operating at just about max output for the past few years. Water levels below the dam are about 2 ft above normal and are expected to continue to rise another foot or so. Current above the dam is described as heavy, so below the dam will be the same. This condition is expected to last throughout the remainder of Jun and July, due to heavy rains in northern Minnesota, Lake of the Woods, eastern Manitoba, etc. regions over the past few weeks. A couple of resort owners I have spoke with don't expect water levels to return to normal on Lake of the Woods until mid-August, which means the dams at Kenora and the White Dog will still be letting a lot of water out during that time.
