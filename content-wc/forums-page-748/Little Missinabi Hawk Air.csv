I was looking at the log book in the cabin and I seen guys talking about stump bay and lookout bay, can anyone tell me about these area's (where they actually are) and how you would fish them? Thanks Jeff"

549583,chuck c c,2005-06-21 18:45:00,34,Jeff; Stump Bay is the second widening on the left going down the lake past the narrows. Lookout Bay is as far down the lake as you can go before it narrows to a river.It's a bit of a run so pack a lunch if Kelley is still using the 4 strokes.

I understand that those motors also had a over heating problem. Anyway it is a great fishing lake and look forward to it every year. Thanks for the information. Is there a particular way to fish those area's, I do not know the depths? Thanks Jeff"
549675,chuck c c,2005-06-23 16:58:00,34,"Jeff; We fish Stump Bay with crawler harnesses behind bottom bouncers. If we found a concentration of walleyes, we pitch jigs. Lookout Bay is weedier and we pitch jigs into the openings or trolled weed edges with # 7 Shad Raps in the clown color. Casting those Shad Raps worked all well, particularly in the first bay to the right going down the lake from the cabin at dusk. We have never bothered to fly minnows in. We haven't needed them."
