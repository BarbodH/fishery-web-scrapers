549653,Guest,2005-06-23 06:34:00,0,leaving next friday--taking the neph to cabelas saturday any more info. or a bug or fishing report would be a good read thanks
549654,Guest,2005-06-23 06:40:00,0,"Here's a bit of advise. Skip Cabela's, shop at Fleet Farm or something equivilent, and save some money. Cabela's and Gander Mountain are the biggest rip off stores around."
549667,Guest,2005-06-23 09:56:00,0,Go to Four seasons Bait and Tackle in Ear Falls and buy your spinners there. They are cheap and know what works.
549273,Guest,2005-06-14 22:01:00,0,would greatly appreciate any info. on must have tackle and tactics for lac seul---will be there the week of july 4th with my nephew who is a first timer to canada fishing period---we are staying at scout lake resort--once again any help would be greatly appreciated
549284,wooglin,2005-06-15 06:39:00,371,"Crank baits, deep divers for trolling, worm harnesses (lindy rigs) and jigs. Thats about all we use. Top waters if you're looking for a little visual stimulation."
549292,Guest,2005-06-15 07:13:00,0,how deep do you usually have to run the raps---are the fish generally deep at this time of year??? I have fished pakwash in june and generally only jig fish as fish are fairly shallow. thanks for the help
549293,Guest,2005-06-15 07:13:00,0,Troll the north side of the island just past the narrows leaving scout lake. About 20 feet out. Guarantee you'll catch walleye's
549294,wooglin,2005-06-15 07:15:00,371,"I think its a horse a piece. We catch fish in 8 FOW on up to 30 FOW....we have some deep divers that dive pretty well, we usually pull these around large rock piles, islands or near drop-offs on the deep side. The thing is, the fish are everywhere up there, its just an experiment to see what is working best that day."
549312,Guest,2005-06-15 10:29:00,0,Just came back last weekend form a week up at scout lake resort. Stickbaits worked real well for us also....after we got tired of jigging 60-100 fish per day. We like to keep boat in 7-8 ft of water and cast up to the rockshores etc. Also trolling as stated above you could hardly NOT catch one under slot. Caught several northern casting but not trolling as much. Rapala husky-jerks seem to get right down to 6-8 foot without a lot of line out so we favored them. Hope that helps you out a bit. SLR is a great place to go.

549316,Guest,2005-06-15 10:54:00,0,Was there last year over the 4th of july. Never found the need to use cranks? Anyone that gets sick of catching Lac Seul Walleyes on jigs is just plain crazy. Once you get your map take a peak at Manitou Point. If you are having trouble finding fish to pitch jigs at just pull spinners with bottom bouncers for a bit to find schools. Pink and White was our top color. You will not have to go deep to find fish. Just the thought of the couple sets of treble hooks to all those fish is sad. You release 90-120 fish a day. I would even recommend filing off the barb on some jigs.
549331,Gary_IA,2005-06-15 14:15:00,144,"Good luck fishing. If you nephew is a minor be sure you have written notarized permission from parents, his certified birth certificate and a photo identification (many schools have this). If he is an adult still should have certifed birth certificate and a photo id (driver's license)."
549347,Guest,2005-06-15 20:19:00,0,thanks for the responses---glad to hear jigging or lindy rigging will be ok as it might get a tad mundane for him as he is only 13 y/o. once again thanks for your guys advice and good luck to you
