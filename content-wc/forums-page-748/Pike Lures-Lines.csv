549461,Guest,2005-06-19 20:09:00,0,Head up North this week and hope to land some trophy sized pike. Looking for recommendations on lure & line types to consider. Thanks DJP
549470,Guest,2005-06-20 06:52:00,0,"Everybody's definition of a trophy is different, so I'm not sure what you mean. I will assume you are after fish in the 40""+ range. If so, I think one of the modern musky rods is the ticket -- a 7' or 7 1/2' medium heavy rod with plenty of action, with a bait casting reel spooled with 50 lb super line (power pro, etc.). That might be a bit more than you need for 20 lb. to 25 lb. pike, but it doubles as a musky rod, or triples as a catfish rod, depending upon what else you like to fish for. As far as baits go, this time of year, unless you are fishing a very shallow lake which warms up very quickly, I would expect the bigger fish to still be somewhat weed oriented. Therefore, I would get a musky sized yellow spinnerbait with silver blades and a black or perch colored 9"" or 10"" suick, both for working over and through the weeds. You could substitute a mepps musky killer for the spinnerbait if you wanted. I just prefer the spinnerbaits for weeds. If you have expansive weed beds and the weeds have not yet made it to the surface in the 6 to 10 foot range, try trolling spinnerbaits and bucktails over the tops of the weeds. I would also have a 6"" crankbait of the Grandma or Jake variety and/or some suspending jerk-minnow baits, such as the husky jerk, for working along the deep weed edges or rock piles close to weeds or weedy bays, particularly if you have post cold front conditions. Don't be afraid to bang the crankbaits into the rocks and pause them a little. If the bigger fish aren't in the weeds, you will need to go a little deeper and that usually means diving crankbaits with a good wobble, such as the rapala shad rap (SR-9 size or the musky sized Super Shad Rap), or maybe even some type of soft plastic bait. For the evenings, nothing is more fun that a surface strike. If you want to give that a try, check out one of the smaller sized mud puppies (a tail rotating surface bait). The pike seem to have a hard time laying off them at times. I guess no selection of pike baits would be complete without a spoon or two. A large daredevil type spoon in either the traditional red and white or the five of diamonds is pretty standard stuff. If I had to choose just three lures to take with me in the boat for northern fishing, they would be the yellow spinnerbait, a 6"" grandma or a husky jerk in firetiger, perch colored Super Sshad Rap. Good luck. I wish I was going up with you. You might just hit some prime pike fishing. My group isn't going up until mid July, and that typically is past the prime for shallow water pike."
549472,wooglin,2005-06-20 07:11:00,371,"Fishing Lac Seul the past few years, I'd fish walleye with 10lb mono on a 6' rod - with only one broken line in two years. This year, I bought a new 6'6"" rod and put 14lb Fireline on it - I will use this for Pike. I don't think it is necessary to go all out on 80lb line, big expensive rod...etc. Many of my pike that were caught, were caught on walleye rigs...so, don't feel like you need to spend a ton of money."
549476,Guest,2005-06-20 09:20:00,0,...that is until the biggest fish you'll ever hook...the fish of a lifetime...is boatside and the moment of truth arrives...THEN you'll wish you were rigged for the big one.
549477,wooglin,2005-06-20 09:28:00,371,"Weel, maybe I guess. But, you don't need 50lb test and 7ft. heavy action rod to pull in a world record either....but, if you got a lot of extra cash sitting around, I guess I'd probably buy the heavy rig myself... Tie your knots properly, set your drag properly, you can catch a 50+ muskie on 6lb test."
549478,Guest,2005-06-20 09:33:00,0,"Caught a 41"" pike on 6'6"" Med rod with 6 lb test on it last week at Lac Seul. Landed it just fine....but it was lucky to have happened. When I Pike fish there I use 20 lb Power Pro and a 7'Med Heavy Rod with a 5500C on it."
549483,Guest,2005-06-20 11:08:00,0,"Had a guy in my group catch a 53"" muskie last year on 4lb green line and 1/16th oz jig. i would not recommend it though. i lost a 50+ fish this year on lac suel already due to hooking it on my light pike rig. 17lb mono on 6ft rod. did not get the hook set needed with the top water plastic bait i was using."
549515,Guest,2005-06-20 21:24:00,0,"Last week at LOTW we caught all our 35 - 40"" on 3 inch silver minnows, the gold color and 5 of diamonds, on 12lb test mono line with 6 inch leaders."
549521,Guest,2005-06-21 02:54:00,0,"Spinner baits,white,black,green.Buzz baits(my favorites) same colors.Some husky jerks tenn.shad,blue/white,silver,firetiger.Rattle traps same colors.Johnsons silver minnow w/ 4in.curly tail grub.For colors I try to get a light, dark, and neutral. When they put on the feed bag they are a lot of fun to catch. Experiment with different lures and colors.Don't get hung up on just one lure that worked in the past.75% of my lures get wet(I caught a nice pike on a stupid green rubber frog).Have fun and good luck. T-bird"
549647,Guest,2005-06-22 21:12:00,0,"Thanks all for your input. I hit Gander mountain over the weekend and stocked up on a little of everything (Grandma, Mepps Killer, Spoons, Rapalas). I think I've assembled a nice little arsenal. Like someone said, it'll be that obscure, oddball lure that has sat at the bottom of the tackle box for years that will be the hot bait. I head up North tomorrow and fly out Saturday. Hopefully I'll have some nice pictures to post a little over a week from now. Don"
