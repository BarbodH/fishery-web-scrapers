Any insight would be appreciated. Also an exact location would be nice since there is nothing on the Website. We would like to take a look at the outpost from google maps. Thanks in advance RBF"

As you look east, it's past the first narrow north south strip of water and it looks like a few separate lakes that zig zag futher east. The middle part of rock Lake looks like an S. I recall studying a map of Rock on old website. I stayed at Camps Ronoda main camp from about 2004 to 2008 and had great success with the pike and smallmouth in Lac Remigny and to some extent in Des Quinze. When Glenn Oblander was alive, the camp was great. He made huge improvements to rock Lake and died there one fall while closing up camp. How is new owner? I plan to return there next summer, but there is another camp to consider a few miles further on same road past Ronoda. From the lake, I recall there were 3 flags in the water and newer cabins.Williams wablers in 1/2ounce hammered silver outfished every other lure as I recall."

I would suggest the American plan to anyone, the quality is A-1.According to Mark, he has lost about 40% of his fishing business from the sport shows. The effects of that are showing. There is a lot of deferred maintenance that needs to get done. The boats have had no work done to them, the docks need fixing and the fish cleaning shack needs to be torn down and rebuilt. It's pretty evident that he needs some help around the camp. My group has yet to have a bad week fishing at the main camp but we're considering the outpost. Unfortunately the location isn't posted on the website anymore, (if I had gps coordinates or a grid reference point I could locate it on google earth) Mark said we would need a high clearance vehicle to get there and the I don't know if my yukon would make it. Any insight would be appreciated.The camp you are talking about is http://www.pourvoirie-cabinesdulong.com/accueil_en.htmlStrictly a housekeeping plan for the week, and I don't think that their boats are anything to write home about either.Either place is still located on one **** of a fishery."

You definitely need a 4-wheel drive vehicle to get to the camp, the access road is long with many big rocks and mud pits. One guy had a full-size Suburban so if your Yukon has 4WD you should be alright. The camp itself is worn down and in need of some major maintenance. The one cabin looks like it was recently remodeled (although the door didn't latch!) but the other one is really bad, I wouldn't stay in that one if you paid me! Both are pretty small. The refrigerator wasn't working well in the good cabin so Mark unlocked the other one so we could use the fridge in there. The fish cleaning house is very worn down and should probably be rebuilt. The bath house is nice and was very clean; having access to a hot shower was a plus, even though it is heated lake water. Mark's service to his customers leaves much to be desired; he had his father lead us back there and pretty much just left us. We quickly ran out of water as they didn't bring the pump back to refill the water tank. Fortunately we had a satellite phone and were able to call and have them bring it back, otherwise I don't think we would have heard from them. Three of the members in our group paid for semi-guided hunting and received next to no guidance the entire week. There were also questions about how much Mark charged us and we feel like we were overcharged. Get everything in writing if you decide to go, he seems to wing it as far as prices go. The lakes are beautiful but the fishing was not that great, but that could be attributed to the time of year we went. Very few Walleye, some medium pike, but lots of smallmouth bass. Overall the camp is not bad for the price but I wouldn't return due to Mark's lack of attention to us and his questionable business practices."
2142753,ohiojmj,2013-10-02 18:56:00,1262,"Thanks for the report. How did the main camp look? I stayed at the main camp for the first week of july for 5 yrs, 2003-2007, if I recall correctly. Glen had built new cabins and before dying in fall of 2006, had done some upgrade at Rock Lake, maybe one of the cabins and shower. I'm considering a return to Remigny Lake next year. we've had great times fishing Remigny with success catching pike, smallmouth, and a few walleye. My boys want to return, but I really want a decent cabin. We still miss Glenn as he was great guy all around as camp owner that busted butt to make your stay enjoyable."
2147721,bcoyle3,2013-10-04 14:55:00,3,"The lodge and the new cabins looked pretty nice, albeit we were only there briefly. There are a lot of areas that need to be cleaned up, however, there are piles of junk lying around that could be easily cleaned up with minimal effort. I spoke with a group of hunters from Cleveland and they said the meals were excellent and Mark's wife was very hospitable (easy on the eyes, too!). They acknowledged that Mark is not a very good host but are return visitors because they believe that the price is reasonable. I disagree, as I have seen similarly priced camps in the area. I think you are correct about the Rock Lake outpost, one cabin appears to have been updated fairly recently and the bath house was nice. The rest of the camp was pretty shabby, though, it needs work. This was my first (and last as long as Mark is the owner) visit there so I didn't know Glen, I would probably consider returning if he was still around."
