We caught a ton of Walleyes but in the 6 days of fishing we had cool North winds nearly everyday and at least for our group we had a tough time catching fish over 16 inches. Every single place we stopped to fish from 19-36 ft we caught bunches of 12-16 inch walleye with a few towards 18 once in awhile.. Big fish for the trip was a 26-1/8 and a 24-1/4 and 3- 23's. We caught 1 musky and had 4 others hooked. 42 inch Pike was the big pike of the trip but we did not target pike. Being our first trip to LOTW I think we did well considering the cooler than normal temps and wind. We will go back some day but think we will return to Lac Seul in 2014."

2153506,joeman79,2013-10-07 17:00:00,417,Little late in responding but we used Sioux Narrows Floating Lodges and Jim was great to work with. We fished from Yellow Girl to the Skeet Island area and every in between. Weather was cold long sleeves everyday and wind in north. We are going to try LOTW again but not next year. Booked a Houseboat on Lac Seul for 2014 which should be Killer to be right at the fishing instead of an hour boat ride.
