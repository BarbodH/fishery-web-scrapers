2153282,milfish,2013-10-07 15:07:00,249,"I just returned from a terrific trip to lac Seul Outposts. As usual Ken and Brenda were terrific hosts, and , the fishing was fantastic. We always break the fishing into sessions, mornings before shore lunch and afternoons after shore lunch. We were fortunate to be able to fish our favorite spots on 11 of 14 ""Sessions"" in favorable conditions. During the other 3 ""Sessions"", we were blown off our spots by the wind. The water temps were much higher than we like, started at 60.2 degrees on Saturday and went down to 58.7 by Friday and we prefer low 50's and that is why we wait until late September. Our number of fish caught was down from last year by about 17% but the average size was larger. No real trophies but we saw three that didn't make it into the net that were definitely 30+ inches. Depths were from 22' to 28', colors primarily gold, silver and chartreuse. 3/8 or 1/2 oz. jigs depending on current and sucker or red tail minnows 3 to 5 inches in length. All in all another great Lac Seul fishing trip with no issues. I highly recommend this outfitter to all.Milfish"
2153442,BreezyPoint,2013-10-07 16:35:00,1581,"Well, if you recommend the outfitter, maybe you should tell us who it s and give a few more details on the fishing. Maybe I missed it, but didn't see anything like that in the post."
2153458,BreezyPoint,2013-10-07 16:36:00,1581,"Soorry, I see it now. Where are they located on Lac Seul and where did you fish?"
2153482,milfish,2013-10-07 16:44:00,249,"This year we primarily fished North of Chamberlain narrows. The various spots such as: Pithers Point, Birch Narrows, In-again-Out-again, Pine island, Green can, and any marked reefs or points with fast drop-offs.I hop this helps.Milfish"
2153490,milfish,2013-10-07 16:48:00,249,"Sorry, they are located at Chamberlain narrows, NE end of the lake out of Souix Lookout. About a 35 mile boat ride in. They have numerous camp boats that will haul your extra gear in, bait and limited supplies at the camp store. Many options available, using your own boats and motors or theirs, 16' Lunds with 30 HP Yamaha motors. A first class operation."

Brian dropped me at the landing Friday morning before you arrived and he mentioned you were coming in that afternoon so we missed each other by a few hours. Hopefully he passed along the info. on where I had success and that ly the weather had blown through by the time you arrived. I had one slow drive between Dryden and Winnipeg due to heavy rain so I was thinking that wasn't going to be a good start to your trip.The weather for me was great. Water temps were warmer than I would have liked as well, but the air temps were great, sunny with light winds all week. Never got blown off any areas and in some cases was looking for more wind to get the walleye chop going.I fished exclusively in two spots all week. Right around the corner north of camp on the third point in about 20-25 ft of water. I covered that whole point each day and averaged 15-20 fish there. Everything was on the drop. The second area was the north side of Pecker Point as if you would be heading towards Wapesi Bay. I fished the entire south/western shoreline leading up to the point on my 2nd day as there was a good drift heading from the south end of the point going north. Caught quite a few fish on each drift fishing the current line. The fish were no where else except on that current line where the drop occurred. The next three days HB fisherman anchored up right on the point so there was no good way to work that same area. I moved to the northern side of the point and found fish consistently drifting and back trolling for a couple of hundred yards from the point heading east towards Wapesi.Everything was on 1/4 ounce weight with a floating jig head and minnows. I stuck with my ultralight gear all week and never pulled a lure the entire trip. I was glad I did as the 16-17"" class fish and slots were really healthy.....fat and aggressive. The over -slot fish seemed to be their normal self.....sucking in the bait and laying on the bottom..... just lazy. Kinda like a fella watching football on the couch. By the third day my wrist hurt from fighting the smaller fish since they were so aggressive. Didn't catch any trophies......23 1/2"" being the largest. I lost one big fish off Pecker Point and I'm pretty sure that walleye got nailed by a very large northern due to the drag screaming and the way he fought. Ultralight gear didn't stand a chance in that case. There were plenty of fish in the 19-22"" range and were just great for a fight, a quick thanks and return to the lake.I averaged about 35 fish a day with a good lunch break each day to stretch the legs. Probably spent about 10 hours a day on the water but it went by quickly as the weather was just beautiful.Let me know how you did in the other areas you fished as I didn't spend any time exploring that far north of camp.Maybe next year our schedules /paths may work out where we would be in camp at the same time. It would be a pleasure to meet you and your group and share info.PjShorthorn"
