I have fished Williams many years ago and it was unbelievable but the back roads were brutal. Trying to find a resort closer to the ""hot spots"". Thinking of Scout Lake Resort or Fishermans Cove. Any suggestions?"
2162882,JDP,2013-10-13 04:52:00,1457,"Those are about it.You could add Lac Seul Lodge to the list as a candidate for McKenzie Bay.Renting a houseboat from White Wing Lodge is a possibility.I have never rented a houseboat on Lac Seul, therefore I do not know all of the locations where they are allowed to park.Williams Bay will still be quite a haul from these resorts.You could also check out Williams Lake Lodge and Outpost that has access to Lac Seul's Williams Bay area.This, I believe will involve those tough back roads you spoke about...."

If you can find your way there, also Sunlight lake can be very good too! Check out Manitoba point also and the two little islands SW of there . We used chubs and had great success. Hope this helps you."

2165585,JDP,2013-10-14 15:50:00,1457,"Yes, a guy could amke a run from Black Bay down to Williams Bay, Manitoba Point, Stony Point,etc. easily."
