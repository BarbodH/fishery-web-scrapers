1488619,Guest,2012-09-20 21:24:00,0,"# 6 Gama 6 foot snell biggest leach you can get used by 99% of everyone up there You can add a yellow or red or orange or glow bead to the rig if you want Pretty easy but hey it works To change it up if you want to crank Long A Bombers Fire tiger work well there or reef runners If you want, spinners and crawlers will work real well at times also #4 Colorado and #3s But day in day out snell and a leech Have fun its an awesome place"

1490091,Mikeo2,2012-09-25 16:05:00,27,Looking at hitting tobin for the first time in late October so any more advice would be awesome. Who did you order the leeches through? Are there any spots within the river that are good for big pike?
2143785,Fitzy,2013-10-03 09:07:00,121,"Hey Guys:I am fortunate enough to live in Nipawin and fish both the river system and the lake three times a week. The river is packed with guys right now pre-fishing for the Vanity Cup (this year...over $300K in prizes). Come mid October, many turn to pulling cranks and vertical jigging with minnows. In the last two years...there has been an exponential increase in guys targeting Sturgeon by the #2 signs at the mouth and 400 yards south of Eagles Nest. Reef Runners, TD9's, TD11's, Cotton Cordell Wally Divers, Jointed Shad raps all produce Big Walleye. Pulling Blades on bottom bouncers is also effective come the fall bite with Nite Crawlers. Pulling Cranks around the full moon at night is wicked, especially up by the Power Dam south of Twin Marine....Thinking we'll need north of 63 lbs to have a chance at the Vanity Cup over the two days......"
