Will be trolling for muskies but thought we would try for some walleyes this year too. We have no problems finding the walleyes in the summar months, however, the little bit of walleye fishing we've done on our past fall (late October) trips has been tough. Not looking for any honey holes, but any general thoughts would be great.... Depths, points, humps, type of presentation or bait, etc. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.Thank you!!!!!"
2166129,t8km,2013-10-14 20:20:00,5,Think deer hunting....what I mean is look for water bottlenecks...larger bodies of water with narrow passages between them...you find these and you will find current...find where the wind might be moving water in these passages. You are already in the better area of the lake if our around firebag!
2166449,rhornung,2013-10-15 06:59:00,10,Thanks for the info. Typically what depths do you start looking? We have done well on the 12' to 15' foot humps in the summer but can't seem to find them in fall. Are they still on humps around current or should we be looking for deeper break lines? Is the bait of choice a jig and minnow? Thanks again.
2166537,Shorelunch,2013-10-15 07:23:00,554,"We generally find walleyes in areas of current (bottleneck) in deeper water (20+ feet) or that has access to deeper water. We catch them from 12 - 36 or so feet. That being said, healthy weed lines can hold fish, too. I like jigs and minnows this time of year."
2167065,rhornung,2013-10-15 11:48:00,10,Thanks for the update and info. On our past late October trips when we did fish for walleye we were catching fish in the 12 to 14 inch range and no bigger ones. Perhaps we have been fishing to shallow. Will definately try going deeper and perhaps look at a few weedlines. Hopefully we'll find more and bigger fish.Thanks again!
