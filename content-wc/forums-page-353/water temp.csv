2154242,billspence,2013-10-08 03:32:00,3,would like to know if any one knows what the water temp is at traverse bay and any greens in yet
2154330,mrwalleye5,2013-10-08 06:31:00,1922,"Water temp in around 55F. Had a buddy fish it all last week. Caught 100 fish...8 were walleye...none over 19"". Slowest I have seen it I think for forever for this time of the year. I live a 100 miles from Traverse Bay and do not intend going til the middle of October, weather permitting. The Red is starting to heat up with some larger fish being caught, but for the masses that fish it, it's slow also."
