I would appreciate any fishing tips, patterns, general areas etc. that any one could provide for fishing in that area at this time of year. I will be targeting eyes, smallies and muskies."

2149785,lassh,2013-10-05 19:29:00,553,"Thanks for the input guys. The Anglers Pro Shop web ordering is sweet. When I was surfing earlier the site said they were open until end of September, so I was afraid they might be closed. I got bait from them a couple years ago and the guy that runs the place was really helpful. They showed leeches on their web site but I think leeches are sometimes difficult to get this late in the season."
