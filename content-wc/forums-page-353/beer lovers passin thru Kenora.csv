Instead of gutting the firehouse they intermingled the fire station with restaurant, bar and game rooms. The result is a space that could be found in a trendy new York City bar or downtown Chicago.The place is beautiful. For example they kept the original fire station glass doors for the engines. When the weather is nice they open them up and instant patio. Multiple floors and spaces, beautiful bar, fire pole and other apparatus abound. Very cool.The food is excellent. Appetizers quite good along with sandwiches and salads. They had 3-4 micro brews that they make right there on the premises (you can see the tanks through a glass window through the bar). The beer is pretty good. Not incredible, but compared to 1) normal regular beer you can buy in Canada and 2) the current lack of beer options in Kenora in the first place its quite good.

The glass jug resembled those ceramic ""little'ol jug"" from past days in size and shape. Found the brew much to my liking...smooth, easy going down, and no after taste and at 64 ozs its just about right for an afternoon thirst quencher"
