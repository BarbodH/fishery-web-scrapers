The weather was from snow showers on saturday to 85 degrees on Friday at 200 pm.water temp was 52 on sept 21 to 58 degrees on Friday. Fishing was good to great The fish were on the move all week.You could catch them on any method used . We did find a Bull on tuesday eve,that was tired off living in the bush and wanted out so we helped him out. Took 7 hrs to get him on the meat pole at camp!All equipment at camp was in great condition after a long season! Christine and Remi run a good operation.This was our third hunt combo in 5 years we have taken 2 moose , the other years we did not have a tag to harvest the animals we seen.This year was tough the temperature was warm and the moose were not to active."
