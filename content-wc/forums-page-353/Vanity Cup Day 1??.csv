2150729,Guest,2013-10-06 11:59:00,0,"Here's what i got so far Day 1 Weights are low this year...not a lot of big fish coming in. Day 1 big fish was 12.7 lbs last time I saw the board. Haven't heard if that was beat. Day 1 top weight is 28.1 lbs Only ten teams with 20+ lbs The cutoff weight to make top 20 payout on Day 1 is only 14.85 lbs.... Just to show the low weights...if you weighed in 10 lbs, you would have finished 45th out of 160 teams on Day 1. But...tomorrow is a new day..."
