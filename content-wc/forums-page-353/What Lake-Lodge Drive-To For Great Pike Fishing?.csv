2118914,Sportdog,2013-09-21 22:42:00,6735,I want to take my soon to be 15 year old grandson to Canada and the young man is most interested in lots of pike action with a decent chance for a trophy. I'm looking for a drive-to location with flush toilets and showers. I've got a place in mind but I am looking for options. Thanks for any ideas.

2121929,rockape,2013-09-23 11:13:00,215,Lake Minnitaki is great for pike. Lots of them and also lots over 20 pounds. Any of the lodges in the Sioux Lookout area will have accomodations that work well for both of you.

2135161,stillangling,2013-09-29 08:50:00,149,Shoal Lake has to be at the top of the list. Stupid big fish. Very heavy at a given length. Not a pile of options on the lake itself for accommodation (shoal lk lodge) but it is an easy trailer from Kenora to Clytie Bay (paved except last couple hundred yds) and there are lodges on lake of the woods that offer easy boat access into shoal.
