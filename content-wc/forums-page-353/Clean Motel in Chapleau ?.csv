2160010,canufish,2013-10-10 19:19:00,16,I would recommend Aux Trois Moulin or Riverside I was up there on a Fly in 4 weeks ago and we decided to stay at Riverside on the Chapleau River as this is where we were catching the Float plane that is why we decided to stay there Aux Trois Moulin is a fairly new motel in Chapleau and also has a restaurant we had dinner there and the food was good both of these motels are owned by the same company if you choose Riverside you still have to go Aux Trois Moulin to check in hope this helps. Cheers Mitch...

2161058,Mike Borger,2013-10-11 16:30:00,1554,"Agreed. The Aux Trois Moulin is BY FAR the nicest motel in Chapleau.The only negative if it matters, you can't back your car up to your front door."
