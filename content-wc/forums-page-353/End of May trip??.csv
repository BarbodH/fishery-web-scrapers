2141513,pwbmlr,2013-10-02 07:58:00,37,We are planning our first fly in trip next May. The only time all 6 of us can go because of schedule conflicts is in May. I am looking for options from experienced people if we go the week of May 24th-31 should we be able to catch a good number of walleye and northern. Or are we to early in the season? The camps we are looking at are in the Wawa area and both outfitters are recommending their best Walleye/Northern Lakes.

2141737,tooski,2013-10-02 09:33:00,393,Last week of May is easily my favorite. Check out some camps bookings and you'll see that time of year always gets booked early.
2141793,deputy dog,2013-10-02 10:08:00,305,have a back up plan in case of late ice out....we had to go in august because of that.
2141817,vteye,2013-10-02 10:09:00,812,Our first trip in NW Ontario this past last week in May was a challenge. We had ice out conditions first 3 days and caught lots of pike. We finally caught walleyes end of the week but spawn was on and made difficult walleye fishing. First week of June this year would have awesome and suspect in a normal spring last week in May would be very good.
2142025,new hips,2013-10-02 12:20:00,498,"Prepare for everything weather wise............your pushing your luck, ask the outfitter how many times in the last 10 years he has been iced out. That's why the week is open. To risky for me"
2142097,JayM5209,2013-10-02 13:00:00,1050,"If I could only do one week per year in NW Ontario, it would absolutely be the week beginning the 3rd Saturday in May. In 35 years of trips the 1st or 2nd week of the season, we've had to cut a week short one time because of fires, never have had to cancel or reschedule because of late ice out. I'm fortunate, since retiring, to be able to do second and third weeks later in the season. While I enjoy them all, the late May trips are always my favorite."
2146713,Fishoil,2013-10-04 08:49:00,1277,"That will be a great week for numbers of walleyes. I've been up for the opener 15 or more times and only hit ice a couple of times. I mostly go to a camp that is 250+ miles north of Wawa, I wouldn't be worried about hitting ice that far south. We did have one year at Longlac (which is about 100 miles north of Wawa) that we hit ice but it was only on a couple of lakes, most were open and the fishing was fantastic."
2146761,briand,2013-10-04 09:16:00,48,That time of year lakers are still shallow
2146817,Fisherman Ted,2013-10-04 09:48:00,461,"Best time of year by far. Walleye just off the spawn, you can sight fish for giant pike, bass are staging and lakers are in 8 feet of water. Grand slam."
