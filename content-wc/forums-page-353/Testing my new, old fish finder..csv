2144777,115 optimax,2013-10-03 15:03:00,650,"Wabigoon is an awesome lake when it wants to be.Its pretty tough going on the Goon this time of year.Williams Bay is always a no Brainer.I would rather catch one 8 pounder on the Goon because I know I worked for it!I appreciate it a lot more than I do with an 8 pounder on Williams Bay.Anyone can catch big fish all day long up there,that's why it's always packed with people in the summer.Catching two 8 pounders in one summer on Wabigoon is awesome,Catching two 8 pounders on Lac Seul in ONE DAY is pretty much normal along with every other size you want.Eaters are the only tough thing to catch on Lac Seul.I haven't been up there in 3 years.Going to take my family camping there on an island next summer and catch some hogs.Pretty cool when my kids first Walleye will probably be 3lbs+.Call us spoiled,because we are."
2145017,Limeyangler,2013-10-03 17:01:00,563,"Ahh right....i thought you had some secret direct road route to William's. It would take my old 30hp too long to drive there from Scout, well too long when i have 5 hours for the whole outing! I was up at Scouts last month.....and yeah...its highway all the way....way more forgiving than the ski hill or 20 mile creek way. I was even told to take the Silver water wheel road turning just past Blueberry.....NEVER DID THAT AGAIN!"
2145025,Limeyangler,2013-10-03 17:02:00,563,We were thinking of camping on an island too. I could not imagine camping at the landing....like 200 campers there all summer long!
2145041,Limeyangler,2013-10-03 17:07:00,563,This would be good! But thanks J....works awesomely....might even have to try it on the ice this winter....its way more powerful than my previous one.
2145145,115 optimax,2013-10-03 17:42:00,650,"Yah,it gets pretty rowdy from around 11pm-4am.It was fun when we were younger but not so much anymore.I can't handle the 3 day hangovers and I can't wake up and ""just start drinking again"".Lots of nice beaches to set up camp if the dams are open.Stop by the ice shack again this winter for a POP,it will be in the same spot as usual."
2148777,Limeyangler,2013-10-05 07:39:00,563,Will do...might be walking out to ya early on....surgery on my elbow might make riding the sled tricky.
2151049,115 optimax,2013-10-06 15:34:00,650,"If there are lots of sleds at the shack it means we are there,if not its probably just Ralf.If I see you walking I will pick you up.I just bought a Vexilar yesterday to try and get my interest back in mid season ice fishing.I usually don't put any lines in until March,when the Walleye bite really turn on.Most of the time it's a Sunday afternoon Booze Cruise and visit."
2151657,Limeyangler,2013-10-06 20:55:00,563,I'll have to drag you up to Big Sandy for some giant humpback whities to try out your vex.
2151697,115 optimax,2013-10-06 21:30:00,650,"Sounds good,I just bought a brand new 14ft trailer to haul my sleds around and stuff.I always get land locked when the snow starts to melt! NOT THIS YEAR!!!!I would love to try some different lakes this winter.We will talk"
2139193,Limeyangler,2013-10-01 05:28:00,563,"A kind member from this board and my home town donated his old fishfinder to me, cant remember his screen name on here....but you know who you are J! Here is a video with some footage of it in action yesterday when i went up to Williams bay, Lac Seul.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05LdBOYVMVY"
2139265,Whopper,2013-10-01 06:48:00,340,"Good stuff Simon, video game on the water lol Good on the fella that helped you out also"
2139377,Larry Mac,2013-10-01 08:00:00,530,"Hi Simon, very nicely done, thank you for sharing. Have a great yearThanks you,Larry Mac"
2139625,unclepaully,2013-10-01 09:17:00,112,Love the video...jealous of your backyard opportunities.
2140753,JDP,2013-10-01 18:46:00,1457,Great Video Simon!Looks like the road in is a bit treacherous.
2140793,fishinnut 3446,2013-10-01 18:54:00,638,Must mean something if you live on Goon and fishing Lac Seul ?Another great video Simon.
2141217,Skywagon,2013-10-02 05:07:00,1106,"You don't take that road to Lac Seul (shortcut from Dryden) because you got bored of catching fish on Wabigoon. We have broken boat trailers on two different occasions going that way, have finally decided that the longer/smoother route is less painful."
2141249,Limeyangler,2013-10-02 05:31:00,563,The longer smoother route to William's? Please share that info with me...'im all for less damage to my gear if possible....cuz yeah....its rough on gear for sure.
2142489,Skywagon,2013-10-02 16:10:00,1106,"Drive to Scout Bay, then boat back east, gotta have a fast enough boat to make that feasible, but if you do, the trip there is certainly more pleasant. Rumor has it, you don't even need to go that far for good fishing most of the time. Anyway, hope you get to make it up there again this fall, hard to beat Lac Seul."
2142801,pickeralarm,2013-10-02 19:03:00,16,"So glad it is working well for you Simon, now we just need to find the really old Navionics classic canada card for it."
