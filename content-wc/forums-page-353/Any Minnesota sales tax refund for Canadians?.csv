The highlight of the trip for me was going to Cabelas in East Grand Forks, MN. Anyways, to my point, North Dakota offers a sales tax rebate to Canadians, and I just filled out the form, but I realized that I can't submit my Cabelas purchases on there as it's in Minnesota. So does Minnesota offer the same type of sales tax rebate to Canadians? I surfed thru their government website and can't see anything, but thought I'd ask some traveling experts! Thanks a bunch"

Expect it to come in the 12th week. Having said that, MN has no state tax on any clothing. If you were impressed with the store in Grand Forks, wait until you see the one in Rogers MN. Drop the wife off at the Albertville outlet mall and continue to Rogers CABELA'S."

Yes, it was on clothes. They never charged on any purchases before but now they are.Last year we weren't being taxed but now we are, why is this?"
2154274,Skywagon,2013-10-08 04:52:00,1106,"I'll have to agree on the Rogers Cabelas, have driven 3 hours out of my way the last two trips south this year, just to ""visit"" this store. CYAV, have not been to the new Cabelas yet in Winnipeg, must be an improvement over the old store. Went to the new Cabelas in Denver this September, think there is a nicer display of animals then the Roger store"
2154402,CI_Guy,2013-10-08 06:56:00,2118,There is no sales tax on clothes in Minnesota. At Cabelas it would be determined by the computer at the POS so there would be almost no chance that sales tax would be charged on clothing.
