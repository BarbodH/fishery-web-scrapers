Send me a PM and I can give you some detailed info. Charlotte has a new cabin and if you want to be away from everyone you can go there. Fished hebert and did not see a lot boats on the lac from the six camps. You won't find better fishng in quebec. Shoot me a message."
2141041,trapperbob,2013-10-01 21:22:00,45,"We fished lake Hebert this year and caught many walleye and a lot over 20 inches in size. I personally caught a30 inch and a 28 inch walleye. Lac Charlotte is a much smaller body of water than Hebert, but you would be alone on the lake. If all the cabins are full on Hebert you will see other boats and will be fishing with other boats on the hot spots. Having said that you will catch fish and lots of good sized walleye. Air Tamarac is a very well run outfitter, the boats and cabins are outstanding, you can't go wrong using them. :cheers."

Just wanted to see if Charlotte packs a punch as much or near what Hebert offers. And also being a smaller lake, will we be bored. so to speak? We shall be going to one of the two of these places, I think."
