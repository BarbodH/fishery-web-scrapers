December 26th became a holiday as boxes were filled with gifts and money for servants and tradespeople.Also, poor people carried empty boxes from door to door, and the boxes were soon filled with food, Christmas sweets, and money. Parents gave their children small gifts such as, oranges, handkerchiefs, and socks. People also placed old clothing that they didn't need anymore in boxes, and they were given to those in need.Today, Boxing Day is a holiday in the United Kingdom, Canada, and many other Commonwealth nations. It is spent with family and friends at open gatherings with lots of food, fun, and the sharing of friendship and love.While government buildings and small businesses are closed, the malls are filled with people either exchanging gifts or buying reduced priced Christmas gifts, cards, and decorations.Throughout the Christmas season, many organizations follow the original tradition of Boxing Day by donating their time, energy, and money to fill the Food Bank, provide gifts for children who live in poverty, or to help an individual family who is in great need at the time.SOURCE: C.

Maybe I've been too long north of the border but I thought it was also a tradition in the USA.Anyway, boxing day is to most of us Canucks another day off and a time to get some unreal bargains in alot of our stores. The retailershave created alot of hype over the tradition. Most retailers will offer 1 item that is marked down as much as 99% just to get people in the door. Some of these items are as high as 2,000 dollar range and the people will camp on the door step of that establishment to be first in line to to be able to rush in trampling anyone or anything in their way to lay claim to that one item. When I say camp, I mean camp. These hard core consumers will set up ice fishing tents on the street the afternoon before, night before, whatever it takes to be first in line. Last year my wife and I got caught up in the hype when we saw the oak table and chairs we had been pricing at this one store all year was $1500 cheaper on boxing day. We stood outside for about an hour in -20 celcius which was 59 minutes longer then I enjoyed, but in the end got our table and chairs. The ironic thing was the three chaps that braved the weather all night taking shelter in a ice fishing tent right at the door to be first in to get a $1500 dollar table and chairs for $15.00 had their portable heater stolen and their van window broken by vandals at the same time as they were rushing into claim their big prize. Bummer...."

About 5 years ago I worked with some contractors from England and Australia, and I became familiar with it because both of those countries recognize Boxing day as a holiday. Those contractors felt put out because we had to work on it. I'm guessing that England started the tradition after the US independence, and that is why it is not recognized here.Anyway, I think the story of it's origination was very heart warming. Thanks for the complete background info.IaCraig"
