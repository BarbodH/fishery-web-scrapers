What time of the season does it fish the best? Any info is appreciated. Fish won't forget the day the badger came out to play."

I have fished many of the lakes in the Savant Lake area, but not that one. I have heard people compare it to Sturgeon Lake, which is right down the road. Very big mostly clear water, big northern, lake trout, but like Sturgeon, you need to know where to fish for the walleyes in that lake or you will be burning lots of fuel. They are there but it is a monster lake."

The first week was always the best for us. Savant normally opens the last week in May, so the first week in June is usually the second week of operation for the camp.The walleye fishing was fantastic on all 6 of my trips. We averaged 80-100 eyes a boat per day with many days where we managed 80-100 a man per day. On my last trip there 3 years ago we had 7"" of rain during the week and the temp never broke 50. We found and caught walleyes in big numbers everyday except the first/worst day I have ever had there! 40 MPH winds, temps near freezing and driving rain. We still found caught (30 or so) and sorted enough for 4 of us for dinner .In early June the fish are shallow, easy to find, hungry and easy to catch. Take lots of jigs in the 1/16-3/8 range, Jointed J-11 Rapalas in Black and Silver, along with your favorite Pike Baits. You will get bit by more Pike fishing jigs for Walleyes than you will while actually fishing for Notherns!Most of the best Walleye spots are a good long boat ride from camp, but well worth the trip. There are however a few hot spots in the camp bay that cannot be overlooked.Bring an assortment of Trolling weights and some dipseys or other divers for lakers. I use a 6-8 leader and a 3 oz. trolling weight ahead of the J-11's for lake trout. The deep water straight out from camp holds a lot of lakers in early June ( down about 60'). The 3 oz. weight will get the J-11 there! That is a great after dinner spot.Wildewood is a great camp, their boats and motors are the best available and they will put you on the fish. They have a great website too!E_mail if you want more.Tracy"

The walleye fishing is unmatched and the Lake Trout fishing and Northern fishing is exceptional. There are two camps on the lake. Wildewood sits on the southern end of the lake. I've never stayed there so I can't tell you anything else about it. The other camp is more centrally located. It's called Cliff and Roma's. Their cabins are situated more towards the middle of the lake. Cliff and Roma are delightful people who do all they can to take care of their guests. They've owned the camp for more than 20 years so they not only know what they're doing but they know the lake. It's truly a family type environment. If you would like their phone number, drop me a note and I'll get it to you."

I cannot reply to the one you sent since it came through here. I am the one who sent you a copy of my map last summer.You do not happen to need 2 more for Savant do you?!?!Tracy"
