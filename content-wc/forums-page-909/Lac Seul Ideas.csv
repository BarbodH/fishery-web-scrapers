We have traditionally fished the Red and Winnipeg in the fall but feel the bite has dropped off and would like to try something new.When I start searching for information, it quickly becomes overwhelming. Can anyone give me an idea of what time of year and what part of the lake I should look at? Focusing on walleye, I think we would like to bring our boat and like everyone, we would like to time it for the best numbers and size.Can you get me started? Thank you very much."
