One of the solutions evidently is to not replace it. This would devistate the fising on Despair, mile river and Footprint. Can such a valuable fishing resource not be maintained? Fishermen, lodge owners and nature lovers should be up in arms."

I have a cabin on Jackfish that is part of this chain of lakes, and have observed in the last few years the steady improvement in that fishery. Has the MNR considered the economic impact to this area, if they should decide to ""do away"" with the dam. Camp owners in the area and private cabin owners need to voice their concerns before it is too late. A valuable resource in Ontario is about to take a huge""hit"" if we don't fight to keep our chain of lakes the way it is now."
