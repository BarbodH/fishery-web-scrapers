526038,Vitreum,2003-01-11 16:51:00,221,"i'm gonna nominate my son for finding an entirely new way to fish for walleye. last july off goose island on lac seul, we were drifting and rigging for walleye. everytime we passed this log along the shore we caught fish and usually doubled up. he wanted to anchor and fish the spot. problem was that we had no anchor; lodge didn't supply them. went back for lunch and the lodge owner scrounged around and found us a concrete building block to use. got back to our spot after lunch and the wind had really picked up. we anchored and it would not hold; must have let about 40 foot of rope out in 12' of water, still no hold. we were fooling around and threw our spinner rigs out just beyond the anchor. wham, a double. to make a long story short, we continued to motor back upwind and drifted by that log dragging that 16"" concrete block for over and hour. caught fish constantly, laughing all the time. we call it concrete block bouncing. think it'll catch on?"

526026,Guest,2002-12-21 04:54:00,0,"I'd like to nominate RTMG ( semi-reg here on W.C) He is a honest dude and from what I understand a truely hard working guide. He helps all his guests to get the best out of their trips. He goes that extra distance to give his guests the chance to get a wally to brag about OR up their P.B (personal best) HE is the only guide I know he worksfor his ""guys"",I once fished with him over 14 hours.. he ##### near killed us.The best part is he only charged us for only 8 hours of fishing. He works real hard, gives tips, gives us maps/ & even gave us crankbaits to make the rest of our trip a successful.His information made us more succesful & better anglers and for this we are ever grateful. He knows more about the Minaki area than most can ever hope to ever know. I'm sure not all his trips in Minaki have been great but the few bad are FAR have been out numbered by the good ! There must be a reason why RTMG is recommended by Gary Roch ! just my honest viewsWrDude"

526028,Thumper,2002-12-22 15:03:00,133,I nominate all fisher guys and girls who took a kid fishing. They all deserve the award.
526029,Mike KS,2002-12-23 07:37:00,18,"I have to nominate the infamous fisherman ""BARNEY"". We were on one of Ontarios awesome Walleye lakes and good old Barney decided to go out and do some night fishing by himself. Now Barney is one of those fisherman who has a lot of secret spots and he headed for one of his favorites. He fished for several hours and caught and released numerous monstor Walleye. But trajedy was near and it was in the form of a Canadian storm. The storm blew in before Barney could do anything and the wind blew so hard that it sunk Barneys boat and he lost everything he had but himself and his great ability as a outdoorsman. Barney had to sleep in a pile of pine needles and when he woke up in the morning he was stranded. At the break of dawn he arose and useing his pocket knife he built a Birchbark Canoe. He carved a paddle out of a log and made a fishing pole out of a sapling. He pulled nylon thread from the inside of his Carhart jacket for fishing line and made a jig out of his sunglasses. He slid the canoe into the cool canadian water and begin paddeling the 15 miles back to our cabin. Well old Barney being the fisherman that he is stopped and fished several spots on the way back to the cabin. He of course caught many large Walleye on his home made outfit and he stopped on a island and had a nice shore lunch. He finally arrived back at base camp and he had enough Walleye with him for the rest of us to have a nice supper. When we asked Barney how he survived his ordeal he simply told us that ""It wasnt nothing for the greatest Fisherman who ever graced the clear blue waters of Canada"". In fact he went out that evening again but this time he just took his canoe. sadly we havent seen Barney since ....so if you are up in Canada and you see a guy paddeling around in a Birch bark canoe trolling with a sapling and a smile try and get his autograph.....because you have just met the Greatest Fisherman who ever wet a line in Canada."
526030,Walleye Wacker,2002-12-24 11:19:00,6,Come on guys...lets hear those storys.
526031,Guest,2002-12-26 12:28:00,0,"I think we all may be afraid of contributing after the Barney Story.None the less I will toss in a penny's worth. (not worth your normal 2 cents) I was fishing at Lac Suel with a gent called the Polish Master. Earlier in the week one of our crew had brought in a 30 1/2 inch walleye. Since the Polish Master always wins our big fish of the week award, he was painted squarely into a corner. Our final 3 days he hit it hard from daylight to dark, breaking only to light his cancer sticks. No sandwich or beer passed his beard until supper each evening. It was a picture of determination. Finally on our next to last day as the sun started to slide behind the pines He stuck a true Lac Suel Giant. We had no net with us, So the Master played the fish with extreme caution and expertise. The third time the hog came to the boat I reached to grab it. There was no jig visible, slightly too far inside the lunkers mouth. The monster shook his one one final time as my hand approached and vanished.Not so much as a wink from his silver dollar sized eyes or a how-do-you-do. The Frayed line was no match for this dandy. I looked upat the over grown legend expecting a royal chewing out for having missed the hog, or for failing to remember to bring the net. I gotonly a giant smile. ""Did you see that state of the art release""he asked. ""Think how big that girl will be next year when we come back"" he said. A humble reminder for all of us why they call it fishing ........not catching. The kid of stuff for a fisherman of the year."
526032,Guest,2002-12-27 07:40:00,0,Thanks Euker for reminding me of that day of lost Hogs on Lac Seul. The truth of the story is that I released thst fish early because of another incident that happened on Lac Seul about ten years ago. It was a awesome July day and Euker and I were fishing a nice rocky point that had a drop off that was holding a good school of mixed size Walleye. Now Euker is a great guy and just like a son to me but his Walleye catching ability rivals the Cubs efforts to get into the World Series....takes a lot of swings but cant score enough runs. I was of course catching Walleye one after another while he was grumbling in the front of the boat. We wanted to keep some fish for supper at camp that night and Euker had a new pretty green and yellow hi tech stringer that he wanted to use. The third fish I caught was a nice big old fat ten pounder and she had lost a lot of blood so I decided to keep her and get her mounted. Euker slid her on his hi tech stringer and I continued to fish while Euker continued to grumble. The next fish I caught was going to the frying pan so Euker pulled up his hi tech stringer and HOLY COW it was empty. The hi tech stringer had failed and all the fish were gone. So I ask you why put one in the boat when Euker can lose them faster than I can catch them. And thats the rest of the story.
526033,Guest,2002-12-27 12:33:00,0,Well aren't you just a regular old Paul Harvey. That fish still would not weigh 10 pounds if he hadn't stopped eating since he got off the stringer. I wish to withdraw my nomination of the polishmaster....I obviously made a mistake. YOU GOOFBALL
526034,Guest,2002-12-27 13:03:00,0,Euker....Dont be so touchy about your stringer faliure....it shows that my story about you grumbling in the front of the boat is true....chill out man...you cant expect to fish with the best and not get an occasional whipping.....just think of the storys about you I didnt tell....puff up
