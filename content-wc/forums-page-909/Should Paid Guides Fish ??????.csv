526159,rmthompson,2003-01-03 16:23:00,9,"A Blue in the boat.Oh well each to their own.I found out years ago, that guiding and drinking do not mix.I may be wrong. The OPP on Lake of the Woods agree with me that is for sure.As do numerous resorts."
526160,Guest,2003-01-03 16:44:00,0,"RonThanks for the reminder. Better remind what the speed limit is so I don't break that law. As you said ""TO EACH THEIR OWN""Bigfish"
526161,rmthompson,2003-01-03 17:01:00,9,"I care less how fast anyone goes.Heck at times I use a Ranger with a 200 and believe me, I am normally 3/4 throttle, except in Devils Gap. However I know where I am going day or night.I have just seen too many people over the years here on LOTW hurt, killed because of having one too many.I also keep to the rules and reg's. and even have a few of my own.Catch and release, keep enough for lunch, and the rest go back. The days of meat hunting are over.#####, I would like to see Lake of the Woods go barbless. That would really be something.This thread was about guides fishing.I conceed to that person who guides and catches a big one and gives it to a child. I agree their. However, I am not in the boat to out fish my guests. I will only pick up my rod, get lunch in the boat, and it automatically stops their. I can show them what to do without picking up my gear. All they have to do is listen, and they will catch fish.As I said. I guided for over 20 years. I retired due to health problems. Strokes tend to do that to a person. I only fish now with a few friends, and I drive the boat to this spot or that spot and catch lunch.As for guides fishing. I will stay with what I said. No. Prove they are in this spot or that spot, and let the guests loose. Works for me at least.Just to prove how bad or good I am, I have given guests at where I worked you know what for filleting northern pike over 8lbs. Bass over 3, walleye over 5. If they even try to kill a muskie, I am all over them in very few words and not nice ones. This camps Fish House, has not been used in over 7-8 years. If 10 limits leave this lodge over the summer, I will eat my socks. (not a good idea either)More than I can say for a number of resorts on this lake, or any other for that matter.Have a nice day. I have a web site to design."
526162,Hunter,2003-01-03 23:25:00,346,"Having lived near and fished the Detroit river for 30 years. If I were coming to fish this body of water during the spring run, Id definitely want my guide fishing! There is no 2 ways about it, that guide will only be able to give you perfect boat control if he has a line in the water. I dont care if he hits the hole first, I want to be in it and using a productive bait with excellent boat control!!! The guide will put you into fish and he will be constantly changing jigging techniques to find what is working best!"
526163,rmthompson,2003-01-04 00:16:00,9,"How can a guide with his rod in the water or landing HIS fish give you perfect boat control.Plus any guide who knows what he is doing to begin with should already know which lures to use at any given time.I (when I guided for a living) went fishing on my days off, and in many cases after work. That is how I knew which lures to use. For bass, walleye, pike, even muskie there are standard lures/colors that always produce.For bass/walleye nothing beats a jig and a leech/ or minnow."
526165,rmthompson,2003-01-04 00:30:00,9,"Hurray a man after my own heart.As a guide on Lake of the Woods, I do not have the time to fish. 1-I have to keep the boat off points, a reasonable distance from the shore for a good cast for two guests, so they do not hit shore, Net their fish, not mineIf they get snagged, move in or around to get their lures out, once again NOT mine.Lake of the Woods and the Detroit River are two diff. bodies of water.Even if I were trolling, I would not fish either.Yes, I like fishing, but not while I am working trying to get two guest into what they pay $1000 a week or more to come here for.Yes, many guides do fish, and most guides can out fish their guests any day of the week.Mind you, I have fished with some great fisherman. Those that win tourneys for smallmouth bass or walleye. They need me so they can fish and not have to run the boat and pop off rocks."
526164,Guest,2003-01-04 11:05:00,0,"Ron, I understand what you are saying on a situation like reefs on LOW, in other words, spots. But many guides are faced with current or finding a triggering pattern, or difficult boat control scenarios. Like the Detroit River guy said. If that guide does not have his line in the water in that current, he is just guessing, because the situation is changing constantly and quickly. He needs his line in the water to react (constantly) and correct to maintain a vertical presentation. ..And this is just one scenario. There are many scenarios, on different waters, with different methods that require the guide to have his line in as an important tool included in controlling his boat in a manner that would give his clients any chance for success. In another scenario...if you were a lodge owner looking to hire a guide, who would apply if they could not fish? There are times when it is not necessary for a guide to fish and still do well, but there are many more instances when it is pretty well imperative for the guide to have a line in."
526167,Guest,2003-01-13 12:24:00,0,"I am a guide and i admit that i fish when the action is slow...but when a pattern is found that starts putting fish in the boat I usuall stop..on occasion i fish when the action is extremely good. Lots of my guests think it is fun having the guide fishing with them. Besides the biggest problem I have with guests is that they ""think"" they are good fisherman and are not. They usually start complaining that i dont know what im doing. But then thats when I get mad and hook 6 or 7 in a row and say ""well if you would listen instead of just fishing maybe you will understand how im catching them"", i will show guests new presentations if they are willing to learn....So all those people out there that complain that guides shouldnt fish..maybe they should open there eyes and see what he/she is doing to catch the fish....and when a pattern is found the guide will usually stop...and if not...just ask them to nicely and they usually will."
526166,Walleye Wacker,2003-01-14 17:19:00,6,Many years ago we fished wih a Guide on LOW. One of the things that he taught me was that when jigging the Guide or the experienced fisherman should use a lighter weight jig than the guest or inexperienced fisherman. This way the Guide can be reasonably sure that the guest is in touch with the bottom and therefore in the strike zone. I have used this technique when drifting or backtrolling jigs and bottom bouncers with NEW fisherman. It works....they get in the zone and catch the fish...GUIDES TIPS
526148,rmthompson,2003-01-02 15:05:00,9,"As a former guide on Lake of the Woods I have to say no unless his guest asks him to and as that one person mentioned the customers lure hits the hot spot first.I know that I can put myself right on top of the walleye if needed and the guest will never catch one unless I back him/her into it.You must take into consideration who is paying the shot.BUT - let the guide fish to locate them and prove they are their. Once that happens he should stop. Besides if the fishing is really hot, he will or should not have the time to fish.Ron"
526149,Guest,2003-01-02 16:25:00,0,"Now that is amazing boat control and X-Ray vision all rolled into one.I guided walleyes for over 20 years, but was never able to attain such a level of excellence nor confidence. I am in awe.Whatever you got paid wasn't enough, sir. ;-)"

But here on Lake of the Woods, I know and have done that. Kept the boat right on top of the one spot.Seemed to work. I backed the boat up they caught fish.It could have been presentation who knows. Being a guide, I have an idea of what I am doing.;)"

526153,Guest,2003-01-03 05:19:00,0,Stratman...Normally I fish as the time allows because its a job benefit. I really love to fish. I run into clients now and again who prefer I not fish and just do the boat and cooking thing. I don't have a problem with that..........but I keep meticulous records.....I had a look at them and when I'm not fishing we usually have an off day. Happens.....
526154,bbakes,2003-01-03 09:04:00,121,"Ask this question to all the folks in my boat that I have handed over a big fish to. Have you ever set the hook on a bobber bite, felt a huge head shake, and handed your rod off to a 7 year old? How about a guy who has never caught a trophy walleye? How about a women who has never been fishing? I have! I love fishing, and I love to to help people catch more and bigger fish. If you asked me not to fish on a guided trip, I would not take you. I like to have fun and enjoy my time on the water. Isn't that what fishing is all about? Hook a fish and hand it off to a youngster and you might begin enjoying yourself a little more. It's called fun and relaxation. I would suggest trying it."
526155,Guest,2003-01-03 10:13:00,0,B.Bakes your 100% right on. The look on a childs face when they reel in the fish is what it's all about. Life doesn't get any better than that.Bigfish
526156,Guest,2003-01-03 10:52:00,0,"Big Fish,Doesn't get any better than that?? Did you get religous on me and stop drinking? So, to correct your statement, watching the delight in your childs face as he pulls in a a fish while your sipping an Ice Cold Blue and the Mrs. is at home putting the finishing touches on that roof shingling job you left her when you went north....eh?Now top that!Ivy"
526157,Guest,2003-01-03 14:38:00,0,"IvyYou got me. Before my son pulls in the fish - he grabs me a Cold Blue and a piece of Beef Jerky. If we're out of Blue I call to your boat, which is usually very close (otherwise you wouln't catch fish)and you throw me a Blue. We then discuss what we will and will not tell Mom about our trip. Little as possible.Bigfish"
526158,Guest,2003-01-03 15:53:00,0,"Bigfish,Were you aware that drinking in a boat is illegal? Just thought I would pass that along.Thanks for the dig about not catching fish unless your around. Now if you don't mind, I am going to get back to reading my ""Self-confidence by booby trapping your buddies boat"" book.Peace,Ivy"
526139,Vitreum,2002-12-30 17:22:00,221,"wow, didn't realize that this was such a passionate issue. most all of the guides i've hired have worked very hard to put us on fish and to provide a quality fishing experience. i learned from each and every one of them. some more than others. never really had a bad one. certainly never looked at them as cooks or servants. more like teachers."
526140,River Rat,2002-12-31 15:58:00,43,"I've hired a few guides in my time. I feel the best way to have a bad guide is to treat them as a servant. We always went out of the way to treat them as one of the gang. When we got back to the cabin they were welcome for drinks and dinner, if they wished. We always had good luck too-often the second days fishing was better than the first. Could it be that we treated them decent and they responded in kind?"
526141,Reels,2003-01-01 08:26:00,2876,"I guess it depends on the guide. I have had some great guides that taught me alot while they were fishing, so to me, it really dosent matter as long as he is teaching as well as guiding.<{{}}><"
526142,fishmaster,2003-01-01 12:02:00,209,"Well I was going to keep my 2 cents out now guess I will give my word on the topic. I think it all depends on the situation, I myself have had great guides in Canada and have had a couple of guides in Wisconsin and Ark, and My feeling is yea it is your buck and if you don't want the guide to fish you have to tell him but like some of you guy's have said you can learn lot from some guides and when walleye fishing in Canada and you are back trolling yea the guide is getting first crack at the fish but I think if you are doing things the right way you can out fish the guy getting to the fish first.I think that is the reason a lot of take guides for them to show us there spots and for them to show us the best way to fish them, myself we may take a guide 1 day on a Canada trip now just for a day off and try to learn from them after that you can go on your own, I fish Eagle Lake and that is a big body of water yea it takes time to learn the lake but that is why for the first couple of years you might take a guide.Rememeber it is your buck and you need to make the decission yourself."
526124,DLH,2003-01-01 18:31:00,1,"Have only used a guide 3 times, always in Canada. Our Camp operator has a policy that none of his guides fish. This was imposed after our first year with him and """"our"" guide spent more time fishing than talking or explaining anything,seldom spoke or seemed to have any intersest in anything other than being paid. Since this incident things dramatically improved!!!In visiting with the outfitter, if we had not mentioned this behaviour to him he would not have known what was happening. Outfitters often use a number of guides and can't always tell how they are doing unless you the customer tells them. We now will often let the guide use our equipment to show us the ins and outs of catching fish on a given day and they seem to respond well to this approach. Also keep in mind that your attitude and this years tip may make a difference on next years attitude of the guides, they talk to each other and if you have a bad rep it gets around. In short, treat them as you would like to be treated and most times they will help you to enjoy you day with them."
526143,Reels,2003-01-01 20:08:00,2876,"I guess maybe you can say it comes down to what you want out of the guide. If you want to learn or just have fun, no big deal. If your going after a hog or meat, then maybe it matters. There is no wrong answer I guess, just depends on the individual.<{{}}><"
526144,Jigger1,2003-01-02 08:42:00,234,"Stratman I have to respectfully disagree with you, I have been fishing at what I consider to be a premier lodge on Lac Seul for the last three years and I'm anxiously looking forward to returning in late June. This lodge provides guides as part of the package and I don't know that I would ever go without one, meaning bringing my boat with me. The guide's fish all day long right along with the clients and I can tell you it's to your advantage that they do. These guy's are professionals, know what they are doing, and make adjustments based on how the fish are responding on a given day. Their number one concern is about maximizing their clients catch, so they use this information to make presentation and equipment recommendations. They expeditiously move to different locations based on weather or the bite to get more fish in the boat.First and foremost to dispel your concerns regarding catch, my numbers (and those of my counter parts) have exceeded the guides numbers in each of the three years I've fished at this lodge. I personally have averaged one walleye over 8lbs for each day I've fished Lac Seul and I've always fished the middle of the boat. The largest walleye I've seen out of the boat was caught out of the bow and that was a 30.5 monster.It's possible that this is a Lac Seul phenomenon due to the incredible fishery, but who's bait goes through the strike zone first is the least of my concerns. My focus in this relaxed catered to environment is to make sure my lure is doing exactly what it should, that it's the most appealing, and that I've got it in the strike zone. My vote it a big thumbs up. It's the one time a year where I don't have to worry about boat control, studying the finder, checking my kids lines, or all the other wonderful things you do as your own personal guide. My only concern is what's going on with my line, my lure, myself, and reeling in one trophy after another. My hat is off to those guides that I, or the members of my group, have had the opportunity to fish with over the last three years.Jigger1"
526145,Guest,2003-01-02 10:38:00,0,Jigger....You are 100% correct. A good Guide is well worth it especially if his fishing can improve yours....
526146,Guest,2003-01-02 10:49:00,0,"Jigger,Great post!Your reason to have a guide is mine as well. Assuming you get a good guide, what a wonderful feeling it is to put some of the pressure that you normally carry when you fish, onto someone else. You have paid for the service of a professional guide. You don't have to worry about all those things you mentioned. You can fish. And you can worry on that.Ivy"
526147,red_river_fisher,2003-01-02 14:21:00,24,I agree with most of you I hire a guide sao that I can learn from him and so that he can do for me what I have to do my self the rest of the time (net fish drive boat bait wife and kids line and so on) it is a wonderful experience to have a guide and if he wants to fish as well let him.
526131,stratman,2002-12-30 06:40:00,16,"Thumper, I think you might be missing my point. If you are backtrolling for walleyes and the guide is putting his bait through the strike zone first then that is wrong. There are those who would take the fish no matter who catches them. I would rather get skunked then have someone else catch my fish. I think there are better ways for paid guides to conduct their bussiness then to run thier bait ahead of the customer."
526132,Mike KS,2002-12-30 07:39:00,18,I have been lucky enough to fish with some really good Guides. I like it when a Guide fishs with us. After all he knows what works best and can assist you on presentation and technique. Most of the time after they put you on fish they focus on boat alignment and netting and releasing. Last year we were with a Guide and drifting a drop off. The wife and I were in 8 to 12 feet of water and the Guide in 17. He caught two quick fish and turned the boat around so we could be in the deeper water. He quickly caught two more fish in the shallow water. We were all doing the same thing but the fishing Gods are finicky. A Guides attitude towards his customers having a great day is a lot more important than if he fishs or not. Fishing is the fun ...catching is a bonus.
526133,Guest,2002-12-30 12:35:00,0,"I AGREE WITH MOST OF THE THINGS SAID HERE BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CHARTER CAPTAINS KEEPING THERE FISH AND COUNTING THEM TOWARDS YOUR LIMIT.LAKE ERIE IS FAMOUS FOR THIS, WHY????????"
526134,River_eye,2002-12-30 13:44:00,1486,"So you're one of those, eh?I guided at a canadian resort the last 5 seasons. I fish for walleyes, once and a while for bass and very seldom for pike. A lot of my guests encourage me to fish because they want me to feel involved in their group.I don't know what exact presentation is good that day or exactly where the fish are biting unless I try it out, simple as that. If you think the guides can know where all the hotspots are for the day without some experimentation, you don't know much about fishing.A lot of my guests learn by being told as well as a demonstration by me.Finally, the chances of you finding a guide that will stay interested all day long, attend to all your needs, while not dropping a line in all day are very slim. Heck, to be honest, they probably won't like you, and just be nice to you because you're paying them. I can tell you for a fact that I am a better guide when my guests want me to be a partner with benefits rather than a servant. A guide is more likely to show you really good fishing if he likes you. It doesn't matter whether you think it should be that way or not, it just is. The truth is, you are in a different world out there, and the best thing to do is to go with the flow. It's okay to be demanding, but it never hurts if you are able to adapt to a guides particular way of doing his job, and not the way you think it should be done. The control freaks never have a good time with a guide, and that's too bad."

526135,Guest,2002-12-30 14:19:00,0,Fishing with a Guide is just like being married to a good woman...take the good with the bad and ENJOY IT....
526136,TeeDub,2002-12-30 14:32:00,48,"You're no doubt a better fisherman than most guides Stratman. You probably have a much better handle on what colour, presentation, etc is working on that particular day as well.If the guide's fishing and not catching anything, you may have a valid complaint. If he's doing the catching and you're not.... pay attention to what he's doing. You might learn something. Chances are, the fact that he's catching more fish than you, is NOT because he's first through the strike zone. That's a pretty lame excuse!A guide's job is to not only to put his/her client on fish, but to show the client how to catch them as well. Some client's learn faster by demonstration.When I guided I fished! Most times my client caught more fish over the day than I did.I did well on tips!"
526137,steve dover,2002-12-30 15:02:00,42,"for me a lot of it depends on what you hire the guide for; is it to help you catch fish you couldn't otherwise catch, or to get some fish to eat or a trophy size, or to learn fishing techniques, or just to fish when you don't have a boat, or fish a new area, or to have an entertaining fun outting etc etc. for me if i hired a guide it would be to learn a new body of water or techniques I'm not familiar with as i have a good boat and all the equip, so...i would want the guide to fish as that is when i learn the most, but i can't see why a guide wouldn't agree to whatever your preference is upfront. since most guides are people as far as i know they are as different as any other ""group"" of people-no two are alike. i would prefer a guide who could catch more fish then me, as i would pay very close attention and i would like to think i would ""catch on"" by the end of the day and leave the experience a better fisherman."

526138,Guest,2002-12-30 16:58:00,0,Why don't you become a real adventure fisherman and use a quad to ride into the bush after driving your 4x4 truck as far as it will go then take the canoe on the quad and put it into a river lake system and go into a few lakes then put the inflatable in your backpack and get into a lake where any one can catch many and big fish with out others on the water if you need a guide you are on too big of water or don't know anything about fishing--we go into the Canadian wilderness for the quiet solitude and great fishing not having to have someone baby sit us and fry our fish. Some need a guide to hold their hand and take off their toothy pike or net their eye but a lot of those like the poster here would be beter served to watch a fishing video and say thet were fishing. Guides serve a very good purpose for those who need them and it isn't right to be putting them down just because you are some bigshot who wants someone to fan you while you sail down the Nile.len
526118,stratman,2002-12-29 16:19:00,16,"Three or four different times through the years I have hired guides. Once bass fishing in Arkansas, and a few times in Minnesota walleye fishing. They all fished. Their bait was always the first bait through the strike zone. I decided I would never again hire a guide that fished. I have just contacted one of the premier resorts on lac seul about this question. If you use one of their boats you are required to hire a guide. This would be ok except I was informed that the guides fish. So I would once again be paying someone to fish. I never keep any fish so I see no reason for any hired guide to fish. I believe a guide is hired to put you on fish, take care of the equipment, cook a shore lunch, etc. So should a guide be paid to fish ?? ABSOLUTELY NOT !!!!! What do you think ??"
526119,Vitreum,2002-12-29 16:52:00,221,"i've hired guides/captains in arkansas, kansas, the cheaspeake bay, the atlantic ocean off florida , ocean city maryland and the pacific off mexico. they all fished to some extent and as time allowed. they always took care of the guests first and nobody seemed to mind. they are generally good fishermen and have the ability to humiliate their guests if they are not careful."
526120,daveaz,2002-12-29 17:17:00,16,"Not unless the customer asks him/her to, and the customers lure always hits the stike zone first."
526121,Guest,2002-12-29 17:42:00,0,"I think that it's fair to say that you have already provided the answer to your own question, ""should payed guides fish""?You simply stated, ""absolutely not"", if you feel this strongly towardsthis situation, then who can argue the point!I've been a ""full-time"" professional guide for nearly twenty years.There are times when I fish along with my paying guests and there are times when I don't. Usually when I do fish along with the client(s), it is to demonstrate the technique that is required at that time. I have successfully applied this procedure many, many times over the years. Any ""good"" professional guide, will do what ever it takes to put his or her client(s) onto fish! During my long career as a professional guide, I've been asked countless times, aren't you going to fish or why aren't you fishing? My answer's always the same, I tell them that I get as much enjoyment watching them catch fish as I get when I'm doing the catching!In fairness to you, no, a ""so-called"" fishing guide should not be doing the fishing and catching if you, his paying client, is having difficulties! The onus is on the guide, to do everything within his or her power, to put you the client, onto the fish. Nothing else is acceptable here, absolutely nothing! At the end of the day, you the paying client, are entitiled to certain privileges and that my friend is the way it should be.Any reputable professional guide or professional fishing charter service, should be able to explain their policy before you commit to them. Ask some questions and maybe explain to them what you expect of them, before climbing aboard.Please don't pass judgement on all professional guides, there are some of us that are truly genuine.Fish Hard Forever!"

526125,Guest,2002-12-29 18:26:00,0,"No freakin' way!! Guides are gauging the paying customer enough as it is, so why the ##### would I want him catching the fish that are meant for the paying customer. Guiding is a job as far as I'm concerned...the fishing is the fun part. If I'm paying some guide $300 for a day out on the water the guide should stick to the work part and I'll stick to the fun part. I certainly don't need some guide having a blast and catching fish on my $300. If I want to hire a guide I make sure he works for his money, cooks me lunch and I make sure his day is like a day at the office and he has no fun whatsoever. I have no sympathy for those guys. Hey guides, leave your rods at home.No freakin' way!!!"

Also, if the bite slows down, I'll try a different color, size, or presentation, to see if there's something else that would work better for the customers. Other than that, you're right, a guide should be paying so much attention to the customers in the boat that he doesn't have time to fish! I've had people who look at the guide as a fishing partner who happens to be supplying all the equipment, and that's fine too. Then, we just go out and have fun fishing. But, the first goal of any good guide should be to put the paying customers on the fish. Most of my days are spent sitting behind the console running the bow mount on an extension cord and netting fish, baiting hooks, watching the weather, etc. Brian#312"

A spot on the spot, different story...When I've been out with guides I want them to fish. I want someone who's involved, trying to figure things out. A fishing rod can be your guide's way to gather information that will put you on more fish. I don't want him 'blind' to how the fish are biting, reacting...I could see how your bad experience could really turn you off though, and I understand your point. It isn't always that way though."

If I was a payed guide I'd want to make sure I was on fish and the only sure way is to get the feel yourself. Many times I stop fishing so the guests who are out with us get their rigs hooked up, fish put away ect ect.I beg to differ in looking after your paying people...if the're not catching fish you may have a little time in getting everything right for them in way of presentation ect. I also regular humble people I take out when we have light bites. I don't do it on purpose but my equipment and experience takes over. I can see a guide whos being paid who humbles an ""experienced"" fisherman whos paid him being a problem if the fisherman does not have an open mind."
