526362,Eric,2003-01-10 20:05:00,114,Have fished the manitou extensively.Muskie seems to be better early in the season rather than later. We have always had slow fishing in september for lunge.Bass are smallmouth and run 1.5-3 lbs. they can be caught many different ways.pike fishing is fair and there are a lot of weed beds. Also a great lake trout lake but I don't fish for them.no walleye.Clear water deep and beautiful.watch for rocks as you could lose your lower unit. Say hi to ted davis for me. He is quite a guy. This is a big fishery and try to get a map. I will be at beaverhead camp about 10 miles from barker bay sept21-28. If you see a greem lund 1700 angler ss with 2 mercs on the back stop and say hello this lake is practically deserted then. there is no place I would rather be than the manitou although from what i read some other lakes may have overall better fishing. email me if you have any other ?
