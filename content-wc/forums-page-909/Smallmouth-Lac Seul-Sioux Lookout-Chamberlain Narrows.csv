Question from a relative new comer to the canadaian fishing scene..What's the scoop on smallmouth fishing on Lac Seul or in that neighborhood? I made my first trip to Lac Seul and Northwest Ontario last May and had an excellent trip. 29"" walleye, 41"" norhtern (all fish released except for a few suppers) and a lot of fish. The walleye were a looooong boat ride from camp approx 26 miles is what the GPS showed..Each way. Broad lake was the destination and was worth the trip, because it was tough going else where unless you were fishing northerns. Didn't matter where we were on the lake for them, every drainage was packed with them. The ones up in Mckenzie bay were still spawning but the notherns south of Scout lake were spawned out and feeding. I really enjoyed the scenery and the lake. I'd like to go back to that neighborhood with the wife and son. The wife really, really likes to fish. I just have to admit though I got bored with the walleye thing, just dragging a jig around behind the boat. Don't crucify me I know this is predominantly a walleye site, but I really like to fish for bass, particularly the smallmouth. Shoot I was pitching a lizard in the area the smallmouth came from and picked up my big walleye. She bit on a motor oil/chartreuse lizard, caught several more also and a bunch of northerns. Lost a lot of them too! The last day of the trip we made a run down to a spot on the map called the south inlet (beautiful spot by the way and loaded with pike). My brother in law picked up a nice 3 1/2 lb smallmouth pitching a chartreuse spinnerbait around the inlet. If we would have run further south would have we found smallmouth fishing? Good fishing?? any input would help. I'd like to make it back to Lac Seul this summer in June if we can find an opening, but I'd really like to have some bass to work on to boot..ThanksLH"

No walleye, but millions of smallmouth bass and a large musky or northern following most of your catches up to the boat. Best of all, no long boat rides! If you have any experience sm-bass fishing, you can easily have 70+ catches a day - every day. Just no walleye in the lake."
526342,NDJ,2003-01-12 09:38:00,32,"Karl...can you put a boat in or do you need to rent one???? We freelance out of Siuox Lookout & I want to spend a day after smallies, throwing plugs...haven't had much success at Lac Suel doing that."
526344,Mike KS,2003-01-14 17:30:00,18,LH....Been fishing Lac Seul for many years. The Smallie fishing is getting better every year. Last year we caught good numbers and size of Smallies every day while fishing Walleye. We fish the South Central part of the lake Williams Bay/McIntyre Bay area. Most of our Smallies are coming off of rocky points on jigs tipped with minnow/leechs/Twister Tails. We fish in early June.
526345,Guest,2003-01-14 20:35:00,0,"Mike thanks very much for the info. I'll track down my Lac Seul map and look it over. We fished the south inlet area last year and that's where the only smallmouth we caught came from. It was early though the third week of may and the water was only in the high 40's..Cold..I'm thinking about another trip back this year with the family. I'd like to go in June, but the camp I was kind of thinking of is booked until August (evergreen)..I'm going to keep looking and see if I can come up with something for mid june..I'm planning on trailering my boat up (the heck with those 16' lunds and 25's) so we can move around the lake if need be. I really like spring fishing and hopefully by mid june the walleyes are recuperated from the spawn and are active and back in the main lake areas. I enjoyed it up there last year, but really want to catch some sm bass. I'm considering staying south around Vermillion as one poster mentioned and then heading to LS for Walleye/Northern and maybe try and find it's bass to boot. I know there are several public launches around the big lake, but it's a darn big lake..Thanks again for the info..LH"

526346,Karl,2003-01-15 21:05:00,63,I drove into the Deception Bay launch to Lac Seul this past summer. Imagine two (2!) Wal-Mart parking lots filled to capacity with fancy trucks and boat trailers. I'd guess there was a million dollars of truck/trailer combos. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.That's not why I drive a gazillion miles north to see.
