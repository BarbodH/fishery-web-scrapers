Peter is a good pilot in general, I just don't agree with his weather making decisions. I've heard him take off when you could hardly see 50 feet in front of you. I'm not trying to scare anyone away, just be sure of what risks you are willing to take for a few more hours of fishing."

525511,Guest,2003-01-01 12:09:00,0,"We have a third year booked with Peter at Kay Air. His outpost are GREAT,outside the fact they still use outhouses! Inside cabins are clean , hot showers,outside deep fryers, gas refridgerators,and gas stoves and ovens. Now for the fishing ... I would guess we caught over 100 walleye a day ,catch and release,within one and a half miles from the cabin .If this was not a great place to go we would not book a third year .We will be there again last week of June,WINK's Crew ."
525512,Guest,2003-01-02 10:29:00,0,Thanks for the feedback!100 a day would be mighty nice! What were the size of walleye you were catching?How often did they fly-by to check up on you?Ivy
525514,WillieB,2003-01-02 12:55:00,292,"Sounds great!The 100 walleyes a day, was that each or the total for your group?Thanks"
525515,Guest,2003-01-02 13:22:00,0,Is that a 100 Walleyes per man before lunch or after lunch????
525513,Guest,2003-01-02 15:45:00,0,"I 'm trying to remember size..on the average I would say about 17 inches. They checked in on us about midweek or maybe it was twice a week. As for the number of fish it was a rough guess and that was for the day . We mostly fished mornings , napped around 1:30 went fishing again about 4:oopm.My fishing partner and estimate at least that many fish each. We had a blast!Didn't have much time for hitting the beers,unless you set your rod down. Wink had one walleye on and he thought it was a snag , but all of a sudden the line reeled in very hard .Apon closer look as it was near the boat to our surprise , he had a walley on and a northern was trying to eat it.Yes we did land both !"
525516,Guest,2003-01-02 17:35:00,0,can any one give me there web site thanks wayne
525517,2 DOGS,2003-01-02 17:44:00,361,WWW.KAYAIR.COM Peter's one of the best pilots you'll ever fly with.
525518,Guest,2003-01-10 18:44:00,0,Peter may be friendly with his guests and knows how to B.S. with you but I've sat in that bay on more than one morning wondering when we will have to call in search and rescue for his downed planes. Maybe someone should tell him that float planes aren't supposed to fly in I.F.R. conditions! I just hope he doesn't have a plane load of guests when he does go down.
525519,Guest,2003-01-11 08:43:00,0,"I'm wondering if you aren't a competitor trying to scare off some potential customers of Kay's? I, too, have sat in the same bay wondering when the weather would clear, because Peter wouldn't fly us out until it was safe."
