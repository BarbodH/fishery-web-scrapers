No walleye, but millions of smallmouth bass and a large musky or northern following most of your catches up to the boat. Best of all, no long boat rides! If you have any experience sm-bass fishing, you can easily have 70+ catches a day - every day. Just no walleye in the lake."
526262,Guest,2003-01-13 12:26:00,0,"I know the perfect place for you!!!! (And its only a five minute boat ride from fort frances, thats just across the border from international falls.) You need to go to campfire island lodge. It is located on Rainy Lake, the best smallmouth fishery in north america according to Al Linder. You automatically get guides that know the water very well, and get to cruise the lakes in 20ft Lund ProGuide Boats with 75 hp Honda's. Its a great place and you will catch a lot of huge smallmouth. I've been there many of times, Dean and the rest of the guides will do everything to make you happy. Enjoy your trip. Call (807)-274-9500 or go to there email address and www.campfireisland.comTell them CoonCain sent you.The Smallmouth Fishing is unbelievable!!!!"

526253,Stevie B,2003-01-06 10:59:00,157,"I'm fairly new to bass fishing. In fact I caught my first smallie this last summer. We we're fishing on Longbow lake. It is just east of Kenora on hwy 17. There are only 2 resorts on the lake and a couple of cabins. Allthought it is right next to Lake of the Woods most poeple over look it. There is very little traffic on the lake. And it is directly connected to LOTW, so if the fishing is slow you can check that out. There are some really nice cabins at the Longbow Lake Camp and there are some really great poeple that spend alot of there summer there. Like I say I am new to bass fishing but I've always caught fish with one or two hitting the 18""-19"" range.Keep on Fishing!"
526254,River Rat,2003-01-06 12:04:00,43,"From what I understand, Rainy Lake, right there at Fort Francis, is about as good as it gets. I've never fished it though. I have fished Little Vermilion, near Sioux Lookout. It is a good smallie lake, or at least it was. Haven't been there for quite a while. I've never stayed there, but there was a resort-Fireside Lodge, I beleive. It was the only one on the lake. There was also a nice campground run by the government."
526255,Guest,2003-01-06 12:29:00,0,"There are some nice boat in resorts on Rainy Lake. Three years ago we went to Cascade Camp, located at Devil's Cascade (waterfall) at north end of north arm. This is an old basic fishing camp, no frills. There are flush toilets, running water and shower facilities in the cabins. Furniture and appliances are functional but are a mixed collection. Boats with 15 hp motors not new but serviceable. Boat in at that time $90 each way-includes gear, food and up to 5 people. Cabin costs and boat costs real reasonable. The people that run the place are nice and helpful.Although I have stayed in much nicer cabins, I have never had better Smallmouth fishing!!! We caught Smallmouth bass off the cabin dock and other docks too. 15 inch and 17 inch bass were common-some larger.I caught 6 fish on 7 casts (bare jig with piece of nightcrawler) Two of brothers shared a rod and caught 13 bass in a row.Cascade Camp offers a daily rate. Real nice if you are coordinating with an airline schedule."
526256,Guest,2003-01-06 12:33:00,0,"Clarification: Cascade Camp is housekeeping and guests supply there own food. When you boat in, you bring yourself, food and fishing gear, etc."
526257,rainy,2003-01-06 12:53:00,21,rainy lake is one of the best you will find. you can email me at [email protected] will give you any info i can RE:lodging guiedes ect.
526258,Fitch,2003-01-07 21:43:00,75,Rainy Lake is one of the best but if you looking for something a little more off the main trail and not so many fisherman you may want to consider Pipestone. I was up there 2 summers ago and had great small mouth fishing. There are 2 or 3 lodges on the lake. We stayed at Happy Landing Lodge www.happylandingfishing.com . We were well kept care of and the water didn't seem as huge as Rainy.
526259,RCKC,2003-01-08 08:47:00,14,"Pickerel lake near Minaki, no lodges on it except 10 cabins that are summer homes from people who live in Winnipeg. Great small mouth and pike lake. Go figure with the name of the lake. You'll be the only boat unless we are up their at the same time"
526260,Guest,2003-01-08 17:17:00,0,"Hey STEVIE B, Fished Longbow Lake last summer too, e-mail-me I'd like to hear how you did. [email protected]"
