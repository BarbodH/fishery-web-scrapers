I just inherited a cabin on it and have no real idea as to what is in there or how the fishing is? I didn't even know that my grandparent had the place. Any information will be appreciated. Later, Joe"
526188,Guest,2003-01-03 10:09:00,0,"Joe, I don't know anything about this lake but if you find it's good fishing please let me know. We've been going a few hours north of there and are looking for a place that's a little closer(particularly since my dad and his friend are getting older). Are there rental cabins available?Thanks, Trout"
526189,eyewall,2003-01-03 10:23:00,201,"Trout, I have no idea about the lake, this is usually a great resource. I will keep you updated although if you monitor this with any regularity you'll be abreast of what I know. I read a MNR report and there are pike, walleye, smallmouth, rock bass, perch, and a few lakers. There is a channel to lake huron also, although I don't know if it is navigable. The person that I talked to said there was a lamprey barrier so I don't think there are fish going between the lakes. I'm not sure if there is a resort on the lake or not, never actually been there.I don't think I answered any questions there, I guess I'm not too much help.later, joe"

I only fished the Lake once for walleye (and only got one) and that was 6 years ago . We decided not to buy partially because we had heard it was fished heavy and has never fully recovered, but all the structure and requirements are there. The other reason we didn't buy was it is only 30 minutes away from where I live, so not really a get away from city and I wanted less camps on a lake of that size. Those that have camps there love it because it is a fairly calm lake for kids and swimming etc but still close to city(although it gets an algae bloom every year for a short time so swimmers itch. ) I think you can still get all the way thru Echo river back to Lake Huron . The bay that the Echo River exits into Huron is known for good walleye. However it borders a Native Reserve so some talk about over fishing impacts from them too but can't substaniate. I think you will still enjoy but you will be trailering your boat to further explore lakes around you after a couple of years and that can be fun too."
526191,Guest,2003-01-14 18:41:00,0,The PWT fished the St Mary's river a coupla years ago and a lot of the pros targeted this lake early. They had a difficult time getting into it because of a sandbar but some were sucessful. The tournament was won elsewhere as the slot limits in Echo Lake prevented any big bags being weighed from there.
