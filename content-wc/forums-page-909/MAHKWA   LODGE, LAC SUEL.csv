526462,Noel,2003-01-14 18:20:00,115,"WB,I haven't ever been able to find one either. I called them 2 months ago to have them send me some info but never got anything. Here is some phone numbers to try: 807-582-3466 winter --- 807-582-3443 for summer. Good luck"
526463,Vitreum,2003-01-14 18:41:00,221,i had a similar encounter. couldn't find web site. called on phone about 3-4 months ago. they were supposed to email me info. nothing. supposed to be great fishing area. maybe they have so much repeat business that they don't need to bother with new inquiries.

526465,Guest,2003-01-14 21:23:00,0,"Went to Mahkwa for the first time this past August. Great fishing, beautiful scenery, awesome time! Will be back again this year. We stayed on the Housekeeping Plan, so I'm not sure what service we didn't get, but I thought the place was very well kept and the staff was friendly and helpful.Chris"
