526311,Guest,2003-01-07 13:55:00,0,i was wondering if any of you have caught walleye on top water baits? i've never caught one on a topwater and cant imagine ever catching a walleye on a topwater bait.
526312,Stevie B,2003-01-07 14:04:00,157,"A few years ago I was up at Dogskin Lake. One evening I found myself on a small river that flows out of the lake. I hiked to the bottom of a small set of rapids and threw out a Storm Chug-bug, hopping to get a couple of big northerns. On the first cast the water exploded under my hook and I reeled in what I thought was a small hammer handle. But to my surprise it was a walleye. I casted again and got another walleye. By the end of the evening I had caught 30-35 walleyes on that popper. It does work.Keep on fishing!"
526313,Guest,2003-01-07 14:41:00,0,Fishing on Lake LBZ in Manitoba one evening and there was a mayfly hatch going on. Caught bunchs of Walleye on Fly Rod and a Popper. Only time in forty years that I have fished for and caught Walleye on the surface.

526316,GR8WTHUNTER,2003-01-13 08:19:00,618,"I first top water eye was an accident. I took my youngest brother on a mid summer night trip for smallies. We were casting to a rocky shore that tapered quickly to 60 ft of water. I switched to a pop-R as we neared a point. The first cast across the point put a 5 # eye in the boat. Two more eyes took the pop-r that night. I went back the next night I could fish and hit them again on the pop-r's. more trips proved that pulling a jointed rapala just fast enough to get a wobble gets the eyes too. Another over looked plug is the rebel crawfish, though not fished on top, it has taken eyes off rocky points and ledges. Rich"
526317,Guest,2003-01-14 16:31:00,0,a little off topwaters here but i found pulling a J-13 rapala just under the surface at a constant speed is absolutely deadly. you guys should give it a try
