1051670,Like2Fish,2008-08-26 18:42:00,210,I'm looking for information on Dog Lake near Thunder Bay. Has anyone fished this lake recently? Do you know of any lodges on the lake? A friend of mine had an opportunity to fish Dog Lake and claimed the walleye fishing was real good in June and he rented a cabin at a lodge on the lake. I'm also interested in knowing if the lake supports a good smallmouth and northern fishery. Thanks Like2Fish
