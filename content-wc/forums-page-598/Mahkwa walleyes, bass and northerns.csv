1052263,Boots,2008-08-29 14:27:00,19,Thinking about a late July vacation at Mahkwa Lodge. We have been going in the Ear Falls area for the last 7 years. Our group of 8 usually catch 2 or 3 smallmouth bass for the week and about 20 northern and about 500 walleye. About 5 percent northern to 95 percent walleye. Personally I would not care if I did not catch a northern all week but was wondering if this would be about the same ratio in the Mahkwa area. Would be our first time to Mahkwa.

Although, there are really good northern spots as well as smallies just northeast of the lodge. Get a map of the area and I 'll give you some spots. The fishing is good in the whole area with quite a few big fish spots. Last years bad weather gave the eyes lock jaw but I hear this summer has really picked up. skiball"
