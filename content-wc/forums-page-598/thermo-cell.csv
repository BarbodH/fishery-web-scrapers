1047491,Hump,2008-08-05 16:35:00,578,"We have used them in Canada for two years now. Last year and this year we sat( in a 15 ft. radius) and didn't swat a mosquito. My friend works for Scheels and he sells a ton of them to bear hunters. You will not be disappointed. It takes about 3 minutes to make a difference, but then is is hard to beat."
1047507,Guest,2008-08-05 17:56:00,0,just a side note: make sure you advise your fly in pilot of any fuel you will be carrying. Those small prop planes don't fly very well on fire
1048724,hondachris,2008-08-12 08:24:00,7,I just bought one yesterday at fleet farm $20.00 and the spare butane cartridges are about 5 bucks each. Im curios to see how it will work.

1049090,2746,2008-08-13 18:56:00,3206,used one for the first time up at Gullrock last week. They work but it takes awhile for the area to become bug free. I had to put it on the deck 10-15 minutes before we went out to use it. Good to still have a fogger.
1049152,deputy dog,2008-08-14 06:17:00,305,"how long did the cartridge last and how much area did it cover? thanks, tryin to get as much feedback before buying!"
1049175,Jimmy Jig,2008-08-14 07:45:00,1905,I believe the butane cartridge lasts 12 hrs. and the pads last 4 -5 hrs. They are supposed to cover a 15 ft. circle. They are not supposed to be used indoors.
1049202,GNO,2008-08-14 08:52:00,153,"They work great and are very handy in the boat, hunting, or just sitting around the fire. Definately worth every penny."
1051232,hondachris,2008-08-24 16:46:00,7,i am pretty impressed by the thermo-cell's performance. it worked very well for me. I would turn it on and 5 minutes later there wouldn't be a fly or mosquito in sight.
