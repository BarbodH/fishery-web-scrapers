1051067,Skiball,2008-08-23 08:15:00,82,Thanks Dave. What depth were most of your eyes at? Did you do any northern fishing? Last year at the same week we were fighting bad winds and snow. We must have missed 2-2 1/2 days of fishing. We're all chomping at the bit this year. How about spots? Did your usual spots produce or were you having to find new areas? We fish Pine and the Mission. Along with other areas within 10 miles of the lodge. We don't go into Vaughan anymore. Just curious where you fish. Glad you had a good productive trip and the weather held out. Good luck and Good fishing.Skiball

1051142,Skiball,2008-08-23 19:47:00,82,"Wormy:We found the water to be warmer and the fish had less color than on the main lake. Also in Sept, the water back in Vaughan seems to turn faster. Don't get me wrong, we had some great days with eyes and northerns over the last 14 years in Vaughan while we've fished out of Mahkwa. We may venture into Vaughan this year for a couple of trips. Were you fishing in Vaughan this year? If so, how did you do?Skiball"
1051143,Skiball,2008-08-23 19:48:00,82,Wormy:What other spots did you find productive? What time of year did you go up?
1051170,Wormy,2008-08-23 23:22:00,43,"Skiball, I'm not familiar with the area to be honest. I was only there once and that was last June. I was just curious because when I hear most people talk about Makwa they always talk about Vaughn."
