I am planning a surprise fishing trip for my husband's 40th b-day. We are from Pennsylvania and fish for walleye here year round. We have never been to the bay, so what a better way than a surprise trip. Thank you for your consideration...Melissa"

Might I suggest a fall trip in late November. Big fish, and lots of them, just dress warm and you'll have the time of your life. You can either ask here or email me at [email protected] Just make sure you put Bay of Quinte as the subect so I don't delete it by mistake. Ben"
