Skipped the skeg over the rock without any real damage other than a couple of nicks and scratches. But what did happen was the high pressure fuel pump developed a crack in the side of the wall. Without fuel pressure we were dead in the water 5 miles from the lodge. So, I start the electric and start back. About an hour later we finally come across some good folks from Pennsylvania that gave us a hand and towed us in. Thanks to them from us again. The fishing end of things now. Anyone notice the exceptional amount of rain in Quebec this year? All I can say is holy %#$@! Everyday it poured at one point or another. We managed some nice fish in the 2 to 3 pound range but nothing bigger. Everyone at the lodge said it has been tough to get on good fish due to the level of the resevoir. Man it was high. Next year we are going a couple of weeks earlier in July. Hopefully the weather will be more co-operative. My wife did not like the fact that we had a fire going everyday in the camp!"

Fishing slowed noticably when rain stopped. Steve has some of the rocks marked, but not all. We have found a few house-sized rocks the hard way. No damage this year though. Poor pike fishing but many days of limits of walleye made up for it. Can't wait til June."
