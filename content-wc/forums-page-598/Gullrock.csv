In 20 plus years going to Gull Rock I have never seen such low numbers of people. Even on the lake it seemed for a few days we had the place to ourselves. Fishing was great as always, lots of numbers and a lot of overs."

All the popular spots we fished were busy and at times we would simply move to avoid the boats. Seemed prety much business as usual. I had actually expected we would see lower traffic but not so that week."

1052101,2746,2008-08-28 14:50:00,3206,Sorry I thought you were asking me.....I think the other poster said a Gullrock camp and actually did not name the camp.
