LOTS of eyes in the 17 to 20 inch size. Largest pike was 40.5"" with numerous over 33"". Used artificial lures only, no live bait. First trip in late summer. Found fish very scattered and not same as in June. Water level was dropping, with lots of rocks showing. Most eyes caught on jigs with twister tails and deep diving plugs. Pike on jigs and Johnson silver minnows. Cabin and equipment suberb. Our 5th trip to this lake but first in late summer."
