1052054,wiswalleye,2008-08-28 11:23:00,62,"I go to Canada to get away from cell phones, regular phones, tv, radio and newspapers. It is a time to recharge and destress."
1052074,2Labs,2008-08-28 12:32:00,685,"Yup, as do most of us.However, it is very comfortaing to know my cell phone will operate on an emergency basis if I have a breakdown on the water or while traveling to/from my fishing camp. Help ain't easy to come by if and when that happens!"
1052076,2746,2008-08-28 12:44:00,3206,If you have an analog phone or one that is dual (both digital and analog) it will work. If it's just digital it won't. I was just there and my older phone was the only one out of our group of 8 that did work. Boy do I have roaming charges!! Depending on where your staying you may have to walk around a bit to get a good signal. I could get one by the lake but some spots were static.....worked well in Red Lake.
