Not looking for your private honey spot just like to hear of tales from thart remote region that you can drive to. len clare, michigan"
1048708,lenray,2008-08-12 07:13:00,467,Still wondering---takes a lot of gas to get there from central Michgan.
1049043,Guest,2008-08-13 14:08:00,0,"I have been to Lake St. Joseph. Without question it is an outstanding fishery, although tightly regulated. I am in NW Ohio and will be going in 2009. It is worth the trip. We've stayed at the Old Post. Simply excellent. Good Fishing"
1049558,lobo1,2008-08-15 17:07:00,734,"Lenray is looking for strories from those that rough their own way into the bush via machete, trails, quads, and foot - portaging may be involved carrying their boats and/or inflatables tents food etc. St.Joseph wouldn't qualify because Len isn't the type to stay at a lodge - not that he cant afford it - he just prefers the true wilderness experience and finding his own way via old maps etc to lakes that have been long forgotten and/or never exploited.....had camps etc. good luck Len Steve"
1049823,phishfearme,2008-08-17 11:23:00,1242,"lobo is right - lenrays definition of roughing it would make the worst outpost cabin look like the taj mahal. hey len, we flew into a lake (wettlaufer) on the meen river (maybe 30 miles or so due west of pickle) which produced the level of fishing you're used to and there was another hugh unnamed lake downstream which we tried to get to unsuccessfully - you may want to take a look at it. it's the lake where the meen river comes into the otoskwin downstream of littleford lake. i'm certain there's a canoe route down the otoskwin which may be right up your ally. getting back out may be an issue unless you want to continue all the way down river til the otoskwin hits the road north of pickle. i tried to attach a jpeg file of the lake - if you can see it, the otoskwin river is coming in from the left of the photo and the meen is coming in from the lower left out of wettlaufer lake. this lake would just have to be excellent. i asked around pickle lake about it (pete johnson, dwight monck and others) and noboy seems to know anything about it - my kind (and your kind) of lake. phish"
1049897,Guest,2008-08-17 20:18:00,0,Drop me an email at [email protected] and I'll help you out. I've been up that road since 1984. Love to tell you some stories.
1050011,IaDave,2008-08-18 11:09:00,476,Stop by the Mud Lake campsites and ask for Marv. He use to go up in May and camp most of the summer on an island in Horseshoe Lake. He bought an old camper about 5 yrs ago and he parks it at Mud Lake in April and stays till the fall. He is a very unique guy and is the brother-in-law to one of the guys I use to fish with.
1050827,lenray,2008-08-22 06:16:00,467,It was a hoot hearing from you guys. I am just back from the hospital in Loboland--had my gall bladder out. In out the same day. Put in a rough night but they say the heal up is rather quick. Still planing on heading north in Sept. Will have to portage with canoes. I couldn't carry an oar this morning. You guys take some care but be risky as always. len
