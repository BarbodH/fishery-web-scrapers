1050526,@Lunker,2008-08-20 18:01:00,835,I don't tip the pilot on major airlines and I wouldn't do it on a fly-in either.
1050535,Pooch,2008-08-20 18:52:00,4619,We always tip the pilot $20 each way. They load and unload the plane. If it's an outpost the pilot has to check the cabin and boats to make sure it's ready for your group. They earn their money and are not overpaid in the least. Most go out of their way to fly over wildelife when they spot 'em.Pooch

1050764,Golden Eagle,2008-08-21 19:12:00,2642,Nine hours from bottle-to-throttle? Or is it ten hours bottle-to-throttle?
1050808,SinOrSwim,2008-08-21 23:09:00,1528,"Our group does a fly-in every year and before we start we all throw $x.xx into a til and we use that for all our necessary expenditures such as gas etc. This way it's fair. We always take $50 out and tip our pilot. $100.00 seems a bit much but then again we usually tip 50 both ways. Depends on if we get a different pilot on the way back.Oh, and we always ask (jokingly) if he's happy with his home life, finances etc. We don't want him driving that thing into a lake! Two years ago, we had a couple beers on the flight and quietly crumpled up 2 cans and after we landed, we were pulling up to the dock where the previous group was ready to come out. We set them next to his door so when they opened it these guys saw empty beer cans. Good thing our pilot has a sense of humor. He got a kick out of it. lol"
1050907,GNO,2008-08-22 12:13:00,153,"The tip should depend on what you thought of the friendliness, explaining of things and overall experience with them. Most groups tend to tip anywhere from the $20 - $100 per way on the flights. Whatever one gives is always appreciated as most bush pilots don't get paid alot and really appreciate the tips."
1051207,Guest,2008-08-24 11:05:00,0,We have been flying in for 15 yrs pretty far north and none in our group or the others an any plane tip the pilot Our pilots dont show up drunk and are always on time. I assume our lodge pays them a fair rate and they are happy. They help the guides unload and load the plane. We tip guides about 200 per fisherman for the week and the cook gets appox 50 per fisherman for the week.These trips are about 3500 a week for every thing . Atlantadave
