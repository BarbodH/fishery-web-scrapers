1048826,lcwhit,2008-08-12 17:20:00,104,depends on where you are. probably be ok in dryden. reception is really sketchy up there outside metro areas. ask the folks where you buy it and preferably b4 you buy it.

1049205,Guest,2008-08-14 08:59:00,0,How is the reception on northern lake of the woods ? I have Alltel and will be heading up that way soon.
1049234,mlure,2008-08-14 10:18:00,15,We use our tracfone in Canada to call back to the states. Dial manually. Don't use the memory dialing. We are having problems calling to Canada from the states though. Dick
1049349,Guest,2008-08-14 20:00:00,0,"I also had good luck with my verison cell from hudson-souix lookout area. I believe they charge 5 bucks per day hookup, then about 1 buck per minute, plus local tower hookups, fairly reasonable. Kinda sad thou, the worlds shrinking. Normaly for me==no radio,tv, cell, nothing...that's what i'm trying to escape"
1049357,Outfitter17,2008-08-14 20:26:00,127,"I have cell 2000, which is being bought out by verizon and I have a $5 (canada home) add on - on my US cell phone and it works just fine in Fort Frances, Kenora, Dryden. Your phone should work just fine, you just need to remember that they don't have very many towers up here to connect to. You may have tried your phone in the past and think you are getting bad coverage and it's really that they don't have many remote tower, just ones in the bigger towns.If you are looking for something to work for sure, check out renting a satelite phone. A few of my guests have showed up with rental sat. phones that they picked up just for the trip."
1051379,way2goofy,2008-08-25 13:46:00,22,5 of us had cell phones on out trip to Sioux Narrows. I had my Verizon Wireless phone and had 3 bars in camp. I was the only one of the 5 that could call back to the states. Everyone wanted to use my cell to call home. I haven't seen that bill yet.
