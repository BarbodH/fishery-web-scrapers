3790849,adempsey,2015-04-20 22:09:00,963,Sounds like a good system. I don't think you have much choice with a sonar unit like that. Unless of course the outfitter has solar panels or electricity already =)What is the solar panel you're using? Did it come with a charge controller or did you buy one for it [or none at all]?
3894377,forgop,2015-05-21 20:08:00,880,"I have a Humminbird 398ci SI configured with the portable case and it uses a 12v 7.2A battery. Looks like new batteries can be purchased for less than $20 ea. I know from using another Humminbird model, a single battery lasted darn near a week anyway, albeit it was a black and white model rather than color. I'm thinking 2 fully charged batteries should keep me in the clear all week as long as I shut it off when not in use. I'm going to pick this up from Amazon for less than $50 and will keep it with me on the boat or wherever I'm at. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00...=ATVPDKIKX0DER"

4420657,oleJoe,2016-01-03 08:50:00,114,a couple of our guys have sleep disorders and last year they took in a generator and 5 gal gas. Our outfitter said it did not count against the weight because it was medical issue. It was a Honda 1000 I think an it ran for 7 nights about 8 or 9 hrs on 4 gals of straight gas. It sure made sleeping much better for them and everyone else. It ran outside under the picnic table and a board in front of it. Couldn't hear it at all. P.S. it only took 17 yrs of fly ins to figure that out! Have a good trip.
6350780,elway12,2019-08-16 23:59:00,335,Reviving this old thread. Any new ideas on charging or what exact batteries to bring when fishing a camp that has no boat batteries or generator type power for 6 days? I have a Lowrance CHIRP 4x w/ GPS. If have missed other discussion threads about this please link them here. Thanks for any helpful guidance!
6351210,MrSimon,2019-08-19 07:42:00,922,If you have absolutely no way to charge batteries I would not use any of the larger color GPS-enabled units. You would have to take a pretty heavy battery to run the unit all week without charging. I guess that's fine if you can spare the weight. ATV or tractor batteries are a good option. They are lighter than a full deep-cycle and should run your unit all week. Lithium Ion are amazing if you want to spend the money. One of the black & white non-GPS units can run all week on one set of 8 AA batteries. Now that's efficient!
6351226,adempsey2.0,2019-08-19 08:20:00,611,With lithium batteries using solar panels to charge is far more viable because the batteries charge much faster than lead acid.You could get this panel and a couple of 7Ah or 10Ah lithium batteries :https://dakotalithium.com/product/fo...v=3e8d115eb4b3Dakora claims to charge the 10Ah in 4 hours and the 7Ah in 2.5 hours with this 50W panel.https://dakotalithium.com/product/da...v=3e8d115eb4b3https://dakotalithium.com/product/da...v=3e8d115eb4b3Then you have to hope the sun is out for long enough. Another option is renting a small gas generator. They are not that expensive to rent. A bit more of a hassle since you need to bring gas. Definitely get the info from the air service on whats allowed/how to pack it before you go that route.Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk
6351234,Bstar,2019-08-19 09:40:00,564,Last year we took a cheap 2 cycle generator with us to charge our batteries and phones. It worked great and only weighs 40 lbs. https://www.amazon.com/Tailgator-630...92741641&psc=1
6351262,MrSimon,2019-08-19 13:11:00,922,"This year we did a combination of the above posts. I bought a 10ah battery from Dakota Lithium and we're taking a small generator. The battery weights like two pounds. It's awesome, but it cost $100."
3763361,Mauserbowser,2015-04-13 18:35:00,6,"Today, I just ordered an 22ah AGM battery and it weighs in at 14.5 lbs just for powering my Humminbird 899 SI on other people's boats. The 18ah agm battery weighs in at 11.9 pounds. if you take volts X amps = watts you get 12 X 18 = 216 watts A locator is going to consume 750 to 1000 miliwatt per HOUR but what guys don't realize is any locator needs 12 plus volts or its shuts down due to low voltage. If a guy bought 2 Agm 18ah batteries he might make it fishing 7 days, but I would pay the fly-in service the over weight charge to fly-in my trusty honda 400 watt @120 volts generator. the last fly-in I went in with 7 other guys, they charged us 200 bucks to fly in 700 pounds of additional gear. 200 bucks split 8 ways is 25 bucks apeice and then you can take anything you want including my Honda generator which weighs in at 40 pounds plus a gallon of gas@8 pounds."
3763385,adempsey,2015-04-13 18:40:00,963,"Well, the operating voltage for the units most people would take on a fly-in are 10 - 20 Volts. I know mine operates below 10V for a while before dying off.As for the alkallines, I have tested it on my sonar and they do last as long as I've stated. The sonar the OP is bringing is one of the most basic and operates at 100 mA with the backlight off. Some units even have built in battery compartments to run off of AA batteries. Every sonar will be different and other factors will play a role. So, everyone should be prepared and have a back up plan. I always have extra batteries. There's nothing wrong with bringing in a generator, as that would solve a lot of problems. However, I really don't think you need to do that just to charge your battery for a basic sonar."
3766001,polaris-pete,2015-04-14 12:50:00,343,My Humminbird that I have taken in on my fly-in trips for 5 years will run for 4 days before dying.Its the last 3 days out of the 7 that I would need to charge it for. I have gotten a AA battery pack and am wiring it up as a spare power unit just in case.What I am going to do is turn the sonar on on my work bench and let it run out of the water and see EXACTLY how long before it quits completely. Then I will have a good idea of it longevity.
3766178,3M TA3,2015-04-14 14:05:00,2846,"Sorry to inform you, but using your numbers, .75 mW , you could run 1300 hours before you would consume 1 Watt. More than likely the unit the OP is using, let's say the HumminbirdÂ® PiranhaMax 197C DI Sonar consumes about 220 mA per hour, so your 7Ahr battery should run it for 22+ hours before it shuts down. A generator sure seems like overkill to charge such a small item. An extra battery would cost $20 maybe, so charge it while your out and swap them out each day. How much was that 400 watt Honda anyways? I like Hondas."
3785265,polaris-pete,2015-04-19 20:12:00,343,Ok Guys the guessing is done. Heres what the Piranaha 150 will do. I took the big heavy battery out of the units case. I purchased 2 of the 8 compartmented plastic case that holds 8 AA batteries. This box has 2 wire leads out of it and an off/on switch. I crimped and soldered and shrink tubed the spade ( male) connectors out of the box. My sonar uses 2 female connectors and these snapped into each other perfectly.I made 2 of thes boxes exactly the same. Saturday morning at 8:30 AM I connected the 1 box to the sonar unit.I turned the unit on in Simulator mode ( screen moving showing depth and fish and the Backlite off. Tonite at 10:12 the unit shut itself off. All 8 AA batteries completely dead.So this figures out to a total running time of alittle over 38 Hours on the AA batteries. With theses 2 boxesI will be able to use this sonar all week with no problem. Thanks all for the help on this.
3785801,adempsey,2015-04-19 21:44:00,963,"That's good. I assume you didn't have your transducer hooked up? Not sure if that makes much difference or not. Also, I don't know if running it in sim mode uses less power or not as well. I'd recommend bringing some extra batteries, just in case."
3786145,bkw67,2015-04-20 06:20:00,70,"Running in demo definitely effects it. I recently tested my old humminbirds, different model than yours, amp draw. With the transducer on and in a bucket of water the draw was definitely higher than in demo mode. The biggest surprise to me was the amperage jumped every time I pressed a button. So just running in demo unattended will give you an unrealistic run-time.By the way... how do you know the exact time it shut off?"
3786649,polaris-pete,2015-04-20 08:16:00,343,Ok thanks for this info I will try it again this time with the transducer in a bucket of water. I know the exact time it shut off because its at my work bench and I am working while its running.
3789449,Anonymouse,2015-04-20 17:16:00,834,"Ever consider putting your evening down-time in camp to use?A hand-cranked generator can be surprisingly effective at recharging batcheries.K-TOR has some ""armstrong"" (hee hee) models that sell for under $60 - & a lounger-lizard 2-pedal model for just over $200, complete with inverter and storage batteries.With a little effort, you can find hand-cranked generators supplying anywhere from 10W to 50W of emergency power, & you can manage output anywhere from 0-28V DC @ 3A.These things are designed with cellys, LED flashlights, and small device charging in mind.They weight very little, under 650 grams, (20 oz.)Not that I personally would invest in one but there are really cheap plastic hand crank gennys available for under $5 even."
3789809,mcjsarf1,2015-04-20 18:20:00,6,"I take a Humminbird 385ci in on my fly-fishing trips. I take a 15W panel and two 12-volt batteries. One battery is always charging when the other is in use. On cloudy days you will not get a full charge, so I would swap out batteries at noon on the next sunny day. It worked out fairly well. During previous trips I used an Eagle Cuda 300 depth finder with portable GPS. The Eagle worked great too. Fishing Canadian lakes with lots of islands, I have to have a GPS unit and the 385ci provides that feature. It is also good at identifying fish. I bought the ice fishing kit that came with a portable carrying case. I did by another transducer that I mounted on an aluminum transducer bracket that you can get from Cabelas. Everything worked great. I updated all my weigh-points and I am ready to fly back in on May 30th."
3747682,Mohleye,2015-04-09 09:39:00,368,Why don't you just leave the 12V battery behind? You could bring a whole lot of AA batteries for what that weighs. 2-3 sets will last you the whole week if it's a relatively basic unit.
3747730,Carnhzkr,2015-04-09 09:54:00,964,I think SinOrSwim is on the money with this one. That's the way I'd do it - assuming there's solar/battery bank for lights at the cabin. You can pick up a AC adapter with alligator clips for 5 or 6 bucks and plug a cheap 20 dollar inverter into that. I've used this method to power off the cranking battery in lodge boats to keep my phones and sonar charged.
3748154,MrSimon,2015-04-09 11:23:00,922,"We considered those .... they are neat little devises. But they require you to be right next to a flame - not something you can take out in the boat with you or leave plugged in while you sleep. In the end, what worked best was a $20 dollar external battery pack (20k mAh) from Amazon. It weighed less than a pound and kept three or four iPhones fully charged for the entire week. For fish finders, we used 8AA batteries in one of those little plastic holders .... it worked all week."
3748290,adempsey,2015-04-09 12:02:00,963,"Ahh, yes. Those little battery packs are nice.I might have to pick up a 12V version to test on my sonar. There are some battery packs that are over 20A/h in capacity and weigh < 2 pounds."
3748874,polaris-pete,2015-04-09 14:36:00,343,Going to take some AA batteries to just in case. I just ordered an 8 battery holder with wires to adapt to the Oscars wiring. Still will take the 12 volt battery to as if need be the charge of $45 per 100 # overweight is ok with us.
3749642,fosterthedog,2015-04-09 17:34:00,51,"I use a battery from an emergency exit light you can get them at any battery shop (cheaper online) get one at least 18 to 20 amp/hour rating. Most measure in the 5""/ 3""/7"" range and weight 3-5 lbs. Turn down the backlight on your unit as low as possible, and turn the unit off when you know the patch of water your fishing be it hotspots or routes of travel. I take a lowrance mark 4 with down scan and make it all week on a full charge, tape the battery terminals off when packing to avoid any loss of charge in transit, and remove power connection to your fish finder when you leave the boat( in case you forget to shut off the power). PM me if you have trouble finding the right battery, conservation is the key I know their fun to watch but if your catching your not looking at it. Can be recharged with any charger when you get home slower is better 2 amp charge for a long time is better, store the battery in an environment where it can't freeze, charged and it will last many trips. Good Luck!"

3754194,bkw67,2015-04-11 03:11:00,70,"I am thinking about building something like this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kY0FyLhnMQYou could go with a single battery version to conserve weight, or a double version like this one to have more run-time.I don't think I'll put the light in mine, but I may put the switch in it to the 12V plug to be able to turn it off. I would not put the switch where I would charge it."
3763209,Mauserbowser,2015-04-13 18:04:00,6,"Sorry to inform you but any fishfinder will consume about .75 milliwatts@12 volts per hour up to 1 full watt for a GPS locator like my Humminbird 899. Volts X Amps = watts. figure any locator will consume 12 watts per hour. If you take an AGM 7 amp hour battery, you are looking at 5 hours of a working locator before it shuts down due to low voltage......I suggest you buy a small 400-600 watt portable generator and charge your battery at 2amps @12 volts every evening for about 3 hours. You are kidding yourself with a solar panel because you will be fishing during the day when you need to be charging your battery. Been there done that...and my honda 400 watt silent generator does the charge job real well. It burned lust under a gallon of gas all week long charging the 12ah motorcycle AGM battery. I also recommend a battery meter to see how much charge you have left. Most locators will shut down at 11.5 volts"
3763273,Mauserbowser,2015-04-13 18:15:00,6,"You have to take into consieration a locator is going to shut down due to low voltage at somewhere around 11-11.5 volts. any locator powered by a fully charged agm 12 ah battery will shut down due to low voltage after fishing for 1.5 days based on 8 hours per day. Beg, borrow, or steal a small 4 stroke generator and your problems are solved. You are kidding yourself if you think alkaline batteries last that long......I tried it in my company's electronics lab and the duration was pitifully short nowhere near what you think. The problem you have is the locator needs 12 or more volts....."
3745578,polaris-pete,2015-04-08 18:41:00,343,I have always taken my Portable Humminbird Piranaha Max Sonar with me on all my fly-in trips but this time we have no electricity or generator to charge it up.Has anyone had an experience using the small portable Solar Chargers on a trip? Just wondering how many watts would be needed and do they work on cloudy days? Thanks.
3745810,3M TA3,2015-04-08 19:36:00,2846,"You can get a 30 watt panel for somewhere between $100 to $200 from most sporting goods retailers. Keep in mind that whatever panel you would like to purchase, the output rating is based on optimum conditions. This means a blazing sun and pointed in the right direction (azimuth and elevation) at all times. They will continue to generate power on cloudy days but may only work at 5 or 10% efficiency. So......a 30 watt panel could generate about 2.5 Amps @ 12 volts however that is not likely. A 30 watt panel probably will afford you about 1.5 Amps per hour when the sun is shinning. To charge your batteries for Fish Finder should be perfect because they usually don't consume that much power anyway. They will definitely charge your battery and as long as you don't consume more than you use you'll be in great shape. You could always buy a large panel too. Turn it into a bimini top on your boat."
3746370,adempsey,2015-04-08 23:19:00,963,"I don't think it's worth the expense to bother with a solar system. To do it properly you need at least a 15W panel with a controller and two 12V batteries (one in your sonar while the other is charging). At 15W, your typical 12V sonar battery would charge in about 7-8 hours of direct sunlight [probably 2 good days of sun]. Using a 10W panel would take about 12 hours of direct sunlight to charge the battery. I've seen 15W systems for ~$200 and 10W systems for ~$160. That's quite an added expense.A 5W system would be cheapest at ~$60, since you don't need a controller. However, to charge your battery it would take from 18 to 23 hours of direct sunlight. However, I believe you could hook up a 5W solar panel to your battery even as you're running your sonar. At peak sunlight the 5W panel provides more current than your sonar is drawing. It may provide enough to power to keep your battery going for your trip. Assuming you have a Piranha Max 150/160/170 or 180, a fully charged 12V 7Ah battery should last ~70 hours.I think bringing your own solar is probably just not worth the added cost and hassle.So, I suggest these two options:1) Bring two fully charged 12V batteries. I suggest buying new ones and pick up the 9A/h capacity batteries. 2) Using a battery pack with alkaline batteries. It's very easy to do, especially with a portable unit. Pick up a 12V battery holder for either 8 D-cells or 8 AA-cells. Get some Faston tabs and crimp those onto the battery holder wires. Assuming you have one of the units mentioned, a set of 8 AA's will last you ~20 hours, while 8 D's will last ~120 hours. Alternatively, you could start with a fully charged 12V AGM SLA battery and then switch to an alkaline battery pack when you need it."
3746698,polaris-pete,2015-04-09 06:46:00,343,"Thanks for the replies. Yes I think that after reading these posts that I will just take the sonar with a fully charged battery and an extra holder with the AA Batteries in it ready to go if needed.Just wanted to save a little weight but not worth it. At times when you think a simple thing will help you out, turns into a larger problem."
3746858,adempsey,2015-04-09 07:25:00,963,Which PiranhaMax unit do you have? Is your flight chartered or owned by the outpost operator?

3747018,MrSimon,2015-04-09 07:58:00,922,"I tried a high quality 15w solar panel on our last fly-in ..... I wanted it to keep an iphone charged for pics and videos. It wasn't worth it. Like others said, it needs direct sunlight for extended periods of time. Multiple days to fully charge an iphone. Plus, if the phone is sitting back at camp getting charged, that means I don't have it in the boat for pics .... and it's exposed to any rain that comes through."
3747146,SinOrSwim,2015-04-09 08:24:00,1528,"They make flexible solar panels. I have one I use to supplement my battery on my finder/gps. It is just enough to get the whole day from one battery. We drive now but we always had solar lights at the cabin. We took an inverter and charged our batteries off the cabin battery bank. Just do it over night. The battery banks will charge the next day while you are out fishing. Plus, it really doesn't take that much power."
3747402,adempsey,2015-04-09 08:56:00,963,"Ok, just wanted to confirm. That unit only draws 100mA of power, so the numbers I mentioned above are good estimates (~70 hours for the 7 Amp/hour battery and ~20 hours for the 8 AA alkaline batteries).Also, it's not atypical for some flexibility in weight allowance if the air service is operated by the camp owners. So, I wouldn't worry about being a bit over weight too much. Especially with an operator like Hearst Air."
