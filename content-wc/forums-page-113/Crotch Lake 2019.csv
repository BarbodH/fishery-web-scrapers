6350134,v-bay gord,2019-08-14 19:22:00,3168,I wonder where the hot spot is on Crotch Lake?
6350318,MrSimon,2019-08-15 10:54:00,922,I've attached a picture of the Crotch in question here. Sure is a beauty.
6350320,MrSimon,2019-08-15 10:55:00,922,"Seriously though, it's a gorgeous lake, but the fishing is not that great."
6350350,fishron,2019-08-15 12:22:00,317,I would have liked to seen Shellbacks original post. Have fished there and may again. They have a great deal on the total trip. We fished there two years ago when the lake was very high due to a wet winter and spring. There were floating logs everywhere and it was a job picking your way through. It was the walleye opening week and we got our limits but not much more. It was our first time on the lake and the high water made for tougher fishing. The lake is loaded with largemouth and smallmouth bass. Would like to go back....it is a beautiful and easy to get to lake.

I was considering Crotch lake when I made the post. After checking the lodges out, I found they wouldn't be a good choice for my wife who must use a walker. Lots of steps and or steeper slopes won't work for her. Mr Simon recommended a lake that would be a short daily drive for me, plus an excellent panfish population."
6350600,warefisher,2019-08-16 10:14:00,5,"Shellback - You're correct that the lodge sites are hilly with floating docks that would be difficult for someone with mobility issues. Since rediscovering freshwater fishing in the north country, I've had two stays at the lodge with the American Plan. I found the lodge to be well-run with great food and a helpful staff. The lake is beautiful with many islands and lots of structure. There's great scenery in every direction. I had no trouble finding smallmouth, which was my prime target, and also caught walleye (to 22"") and pike. A nice feature for me was to find a lodge that had an American Plan and would allow me to stay as a solo guest.I hope you find a suitable place. Do you have a soft spot for the Phantom or did you fly it?"

6350728,warefisher,2019-08-16 18:04:00,5,"""an ordnanceman in a Navy F-4 squadron in the mid sixties. VF-74 onboard Forrestal."" That was a military service duty to be proud of. Were you aboard in July of 1967? Dangerous work."
