6349516,Guest,2019-08-12 17:26:00,0,I fish there every late summer. I will be there next week. Pike are in 10' weeds. Use big lures. Trout are in 25+ water and are best trolled. Your guide will help you with what to use.

Cast/troll them for pike and troll them for lakers (with weights or down riggers etc).One my favorites for lakers is the Lucky Strike Half Wave spoon in 4.5 and 5.5. Len Thompson, Eppinger, Yellowbird, Williams are all good. Trolling stick baits can work well too, but I prefer spoons.For pike, casting/trolling spoons and casting spinnerbaits. Johnson Silver minnow with grub trailer is always a good choice if there are weeds. Inline bucktail spinners are good too. That's all you will really need at that time of year. Otherwise, you are headed into light musky tackle territory."

I reckon the water temps are cold and the air temps are in the 60 range it seems right now anyway.Footwear is the one thing I'm wondering mostly.Also how do you find the dinners or accommodations? Any tricks to know there?"
6349784,unchained,2019-08-13 12:49:00,208,"pike and lakers largely from the looks of it. I've never caught a double digit walleye so if that's an option, sure but I wasn't certain on the walleye prospects up there. looks like shore lunch will largely consist of pike? That right?"
6349800,hoosiercanadian,2019-08-13 14:25:00,104,"I have fished Reindeer Lake several times , we usually go up close to mid September , stay at Grand Slam Lodge in Kinnasso . You will need a guide to go after any walleye , i think they travel quite a distance to fish for those. But the pike are plentiful and Reindeer is probably one of the few places on the planet where a world record still swims, the same with lake trout. It is an awesome place to fish ! It can also eat you alive if you are not careful. I have seen 6 to 8 foot swells, also, you can be in 140 foot of water and in an instant be on a reef just under the surface. If you do not know the area , then run your boat with caution, of course if you are being guided every day then no worries."
