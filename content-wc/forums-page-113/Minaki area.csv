6349880,Doc Northern,2019-08-13 20:29:00,4,My wife and I are heading up to Barbers resort the last week of August. I have fished the river several times before and I like going up through the throat. Is the watet level high enough to safely go up the throat? Also any fishing reports would be greatly appreciated.

Artificial leeches were working just as good as live. Not too many big fish but plenty of smaller ones to keep everyone happy...I'm not sure what you mean in regards to the throat, is that the area heading to Roughock? If so I'm not sure as we primarily fished Big Sand."
6350086,Doc Northern,2019-08-14 14:58:00,4,Thanks for the reply Gopher. The throat is the rapids south of Gunn maybe 15 miles south of Minaki. What type of artificial leaches were you using? Did you fish for any smallmouth? My wife will be fishing with me some and l wanted to make sure we have some action other then just bottom bouncing.

We picked them up at the bait shop in Nestor Falls, I believe he might make his own? We didn't intentionally fish Smallmouth but caught dozens of them while fishing for Walleyes. A few with decent size but most on the small end."
