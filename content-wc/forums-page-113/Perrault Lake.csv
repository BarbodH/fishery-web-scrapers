6349578,Blue walleye,2019-08-13 00:38:00,29,My brother and I will be heading up to Perrault lake the last week of August. I was just looking for a current fishing report from anyone that has been up there lately. This will be our first time fishing that body of water. Any info would greatly be appreciated.

Week 12 was full of return guests and some new guests, and we had a great time getting to know everyone. We had some wind on Saturday and Sunday so it pushed most of the anglers off the normal summer humps. Fish were being chased around the lake with boats looking for humps more protected. After trial and error the fish were caught. A lot of boats hanging out around burnt island, and the back of Hatfield on the humps, and sunken islands. The weather pattern didn’t really stabilize and we had winds from the south, Southwest, North, and Northwest. It was definitely more challenging getting and staying on the spots out there, but when you could stay on your spot fish were put in the boats. Dale and Taylor Starovich were in competition again this week with Taylor edging out dad. It was something like 70 something to upper 60’s and of course bragging rights, and lots of banter back and forth. Always fun listening to those two compete. It got so bad early in the week that Dale handed Taylor his pole and said “you can reel this one in”. Hilarious you two. Thanks for the laughs.The walleyes were being caught in their normal summer locations. The sandbar was good when the breeze died down in the evening, and Reif told us of a new spot he discovered now known as the Potluck spot since they fish it after the bbq. Leeches and Crawlers are still the bait of choice. With the lake starting to cool it won’t be long for minnows to become king again. In fact yesterday some guys took out minnows and had some success with minnows, but eventually the leech bite took over in their boat again.If you want Smallmouth fishing no worries. The smallies have been practically jumping in boats this week, and the largest caught was a 22-incher. We had no musky anglers this week, and other than some follows after fish were caught none were really seen. Not to worry Week 13 already has Muskies caught so we’ll discuss that in next weeks blog.Not many pictures this week so Please don’t forget to email Steve and I pictures at [email protected]. You can also tag us on your Facebook posts. Thanks."

6349764,bearfvr13,2019-08-13 12:05:00,174,That's our camp also. PLC is a very nice camp. Don't forget to give Lucy some lovin!! Chuck
6349808,bearfvr13,2019-08-13 14:40:00,174,"Mark has put a bunch of ""hot spots"" in all the fish finders. That should put you on the right track! Good luck!! Chuck"
6349872,Blue walleye,2019-08-13 20:08:00,29,"Thanks Chuck. We will be bring our own boat up for the week I like using my own equipment. Hopefully mark will give us some gps cords to get started. By the way, do you know where the thermocline is at on Perrault lake. I’m sure we will see it on our sonar when we get out there"
6349898,bearfvr13,2019-08-13 21:38:00,174,"Not sure where it's at. But I'm sure Mark will let ya know! We actually had prroblems catchin ""eater walleyes"" this year,..........all we could catch were big walleyes, tough problem eh?! We liked the hump by ""burnt island"" and the hump behind ""Hatfield Island"". We used mainly jig and minnows/leaches. The muskies should be looking to fill their tummys if you like catchin them. Hope y'all have a great trip!! Chuck"
6349908,Blue walleye,2019-08-13 23:43:00,29,"Wow. That’s a great problem to have, hope it’s the same for us. I will let you know how we do when we get back. We were also thinking on the last day of fishing going over to Cliff lake to try for lake trout. Again Chuck thanks for the info."
