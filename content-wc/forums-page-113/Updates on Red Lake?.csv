6347678,stevensinks,2019-08-06 13:47:00,330,we fished from July 21-27. We were at Bow Narrows camp on the west end. My wife had a 28 1/2 and a 31. She really kicked my butt this year. Most of what we got were in the 20-27 range. one day we didn't catch a walleye under 18. Like I said in my other post we didn't have the numbers this year that we had last year but who cares if your catching big fish. Fishing for us was different this year than in the past. Places that we got lots of fish last year did not produce a fish this year. This year we never found a spot that was full of fish . We would hit a spot and catch 1 or 2 maybe 3 then that would be it we would have to find another spot.
6350074,SimonHockey04,2019-08-14 13:26:00,25,"My family had a wonderful week at Howey Bay Resort. The weather was colder and rainier than last year. We vertically jigged in 18-24 ft and drifted in 20-30 ft when the winds were blow'in. We were equally successful with jig-minnow and jig-nightcrawler. We caught hundreds of walleyes mostly in the 14-16in range. For the first time we enjoyed a shore lunch at Goldseekers Beach. The family can't wait to go back next year! If you have any questions, I will try to answer them."
6350264,LoDo,2019-08-15 08:38:00,721,Did you fish in Pipestone Bay? I'm headed in to camp Aug 21 to Aug 29. I know loads of spots in/around Bow Narrows and Middle Bay. More curious if you or anyone has experience in Pipestone?
6350474,stevensinks,2019-08-15 19:38:00,330,"We did or do fish Pipestone we spend a lot of time there. There are lots of good places . Three Fingers can be good, The big island in front of Dupont can be good. Dupont can be good. Grassy can be good at times. Scott Bay can be good. The wall to the right of the mouth of Dupont can be good. The ridge in front of the Cole Gold mine can be good. Are you looking for walleye, pike or lake trout ? I have never been up there as late as you are going. I would be interested in how it goes."

I have never been up there as late as you are going. I would be interested in how it goes.We'll be primarily fishing walleye. We'll spend a little time with northern and trout too, but walleye is the main species. I have a map of some good spots throughout Pipestone from a walleyecentral friend. We'll give those spots a look. Spring fishing up there I'm sure is different than late summer, early fall. We'll have to find some deeper structure. I'm sure we'll be fine. The west side of Red Lake is full of fish. We're going up late, but I'd love to go up there even later. Late September would be high on the list for me to get up there. Leaving in less than a week. Should be fun!"
6351048,campchick,2019-08-18 09:33:00,96,"Based on the report of big fish caught in the West End of Red Lake, it looks like a competitive field for the Red Lake Fall Classic at the end of the month. Most of the fishermen fish Pipestone so there will be a mad scramble for the primo spots."
6335196,SimonHockey04,2019-06-27 13:43:00,25,I was wondering what the fishing is like right now. My family is heading up the first week of August and staying at Howey Bay Resort. Where are the fish at? Has anyone caught any trophies? Thanks
6335820,stevensinks,2019-06-29 10:34:00,330,My wife and I are heading up the last week of July and I'm wondering the same thing. We will be staying at the west end at Bow Narrows Camp.
6336296,LoDo,2019-06-30 20:21:00,721,"People don't fish Red lake any more. Fished out! Natives net the lake, fish size and count are way down, its not good. A 10 day walleye count with the largest being just under 16"" is a good day. Guessing this is why you can't get anyone to give a report. Best of luck!"
6336534,frozen fish,2019-07-01 10:10:00,92,Just spoke with a Red Lake lodge owner. He would neither confirm nor deny native netting. We will see first hand as we're booked there July 27.
6336618,LoDo,2019-07-01 13:01:00,721,"I'm certainly joking on my previous post. Amazing no one responds with Red Lake reports. I'd assume the fishing is incredible. Many 100 fish days, loads of walleye and northerns. Occasional trout are being caught and hopefully released. Best of luck! I'd love to hear a fishing report when you guys are back."
6336898,frozen fish,2019-07-02 07:33:00,92,Checked with a Red Lake and a Gullrock lodge owner. While there has been a mayfly hatch their guests are still catching well.
6346378,SimonHockey04,2019-08-01 18:09:00,25,We leave tomorrow morning for Ft. Francis en route to Howey Bay Resort on Saturday. Has anyone fished Red Lake in the last week and is willing to share how they did?
6346466,victorysilver1412,2019-08-02 03:37:00,1,sound great!
6347030,stevensinks,2019-08-04 10:44:00,330,My wife ad I fished Red Lake the last week of July. Over all the fishing was GREAT. Total fish count was down a little but numbers on big fish was up. It seemed we were catching fish a little deeper than we have the past few years
6347238,frozen fish,2019-08-05 08:14:00,92,"We fished Red Lake July 27 to Aug 3 out of Sunset Lodge. Fishing was good early in the week until the weather changed to very hot and windless. We had trouble catching fish in the 16'-18' range. Lots of little fish, some big ones. While at Sunset a young lad from Iowa caught a 29.5"" and 30"" fish."
