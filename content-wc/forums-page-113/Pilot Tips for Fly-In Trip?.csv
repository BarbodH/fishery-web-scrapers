6350562,DaBirdman,2019-08-16 07:03:00,164,"If he gets you there and back alive, $50 each way for a group of 4 sounds fair. Our trip last year, we had a different guy going to and coming back. The first guy was a hoot, gave us a great ride, did a lot of work. I gave him $150 for our group of 5. He was worth it. Guy on the way back didn't say a whole lot and didn't do a whole lot, plus we had to haul up a lot of gear ourselves for the next guys coming in on their own private plane. I gave him $50.... like I say.... he got us back alive."
6350230,Mojo-NC,2019-08-15 07:21:00,1929,"Our group is doing our first fly-in trip in a few weeks. Our regular lodge has a couple outpost lakes that are only accessible by plane so we decided to give it a try. Our lodge contracts with a local air service for the air transportation. My question: Is it customary to tip the pilot both on the way in and on the way out, and how much would be considered the range of ""normal""? There will be 4 of us, so I figure maybe $50 each way (total), depending on how we're treated? Does that sound reasonable? I'm not sure how many planes they operate or if we'll even have the same pilot for both ways. They will be relatively short flights of approximately 50 miles or so each way out of Ear Falls. Thanks in advance!"
6350232,pjshorthorn,2019-08-15 07:28:00,5654,Sounds about right. We did a day fly in in June and that is about what we paid the pilots. We paid them is US funds. It was a pretty short flight around 20-25 minutes. We had two different fellas on the way in and way out. Our group was 4 guys as well. Have a blast! Hopefully you can get a break from this southern heat and humidity.PjShorthorn

6350242,kona77,2019-08-15 07:42:00,236,"Our rule of thumb is $10 per person. Have only had one bad flight/pilot in 20-25 trips and we always felt this was money well spent. We do tip both ways and many times we have had two different pilots. Just one tip, since it sounds like this is the 1st time on the lake you may want to ask the pilot to do a fly over on the whole lake so you get a better feel for the area. I am sure you will have a lake map and markings for rock piles etc, but it is nice to see these features from the air.. Include any portage lakes on the fly-over.. will also give you an idea on the access/portage part if you fish these lakes.."
6350252,Mojo-NC,2019-08-15 07:53:00,1929,"Thanks that sounds like sage advice, we'll definitely ask for a fly over. The lake is mapped on Navionics and two of us have converted our fishfinders to portable. We'll have sonar, downscan, and GPS with the lake contours marked. The lake is fairly small but deep and we have also spoken to two guys from different groups about the fishing and camp accommodations. We're almost down to the wire now so our level of excitement is ramping up. Trying to get all of our ducks in a row."
6350258,adempsey2.0,2019-08-15 08:02:00,611,"I think it is important to point out that they don't just fly the plane. They load and unload all the gear and usually do a check of the camp for fuel etc. To me, that's what the tip is mostly for under normal circumstances. I think $50 is fair.Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk"
6350274,kona77,2019-08-15 09:26:00,236,Mojo- Sounds like you have all your bases covered about the lake. If nothing else it is still neat to see all the features from the air.. We had a new lake this year and really wanted to fish a portage lake.. We knew it had a lot of twists/turns in the creek/river channel but it was hard to tell by looking at Google-Earth. The fly-over was helpful for that part of our trip.Also good point from Adempsey on all the other things a pilot does after the plane lands. We were the first guys on our lake this year and he started the pilot lights on the stove/refrigerator and also went over the motors/camp generator with us..We would have figured all this stuff out on our own but it was still nice to get his help/feedback.. Good luck on your trip.. Being the only group on a remote Canadian lake is really special ( of course the fishing is not too bad either )
6350314,MrSimon,2019-08-15 10:43:00,922,"In my opinion, the pilot has to earn a good tip. If he just flies us in and says goodbye, he'll get maybe $10. If he is nice, helps with gear, checks the cabin, checks the boats/motors, etc, he'll get upwards of $50. Now, if he tells us where the giant pike are ..... he might get every penny we have."

6350382,Mojo-NC,2019-08-15 14:11:00,1929,"We might be in a unique situation. This flight is being chartered by our regular lodge, so I think all the pilot will do is drop us off at the dock. The pilot is not acting as part of an outfitter in the true sense like many other fly-in lodges, at least not for us. I emailed them previously and asked if they would have any extra boxes from previous trips for our groceries since we are flying to Winnipeg and purchasing everything there. I also asked if they had any advice for us prior to our arrival. The response was, ""You'll have to ask Dave about anything you need for your flyout. We are just a flight service."" I have enough feedback to make reasonable call as to how much to tip. Thanks all!"
