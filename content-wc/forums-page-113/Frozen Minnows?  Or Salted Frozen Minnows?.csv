6346252,labsrus,2019-08-01 10:10:00,557,"I did some last night. Bought minnows at a local bait shop. Have a plastic container with half salt and half borax. Take a scoop of minnow and add to container, cover while they flop around to help keep mixture in container. Wait until they stop flopping. Remove them from plastic container and place in small ziplock sandwich baggie, try to put a dozen in each. They go right in the freezer, there is a little bit of the mixture in each bag When ready to go fishing dump the frozen minnows in a small plastic container filled with lake water. I will dump the water out every once in a while to get most of the salt off. this works to keep the salt out of the boat and off the reels. Been doing this for years."
6346418,law57,2019-08-01 20:06:00,1147,What kind of salt do you use - just table salt? I wonder if pickling salt would work?
6346590,labsrus,2019-08-02 09:45:00,557,Just regular table salt. Morton in the blue canister
6346768,valley366,2019-08-02 21:51:00,193,"Having done them for about 12 trips now here is what I recommend.Prep them 2-4 weeks prior to trip.Do NOT Freeze them. They just get mushy mid day.Start from fresh minnows. Mix borax and pickling salt. Or use table salt. Or whatever salt you have. I use about a 50/50 mix.Put mix in zip lock bag, toss the minnows in and shake around. Put in fridge for about a week or so. Rotate the bag and slosh contents a couple times during the week.After a week pull out and lightly rinse and put on paper towel. Pat them dry and lightly salt. Put about a days worth in each bag and toss in fridge.Do NOT vacuum seal. Just pulls the guts out and gets messy.I have tried freezing and vacuum sealing. Neither worked well for me."
6347072,jermck,2019-08-04 15:25:00,12,"I have used frozen minnows since 2007, no salt, no borax, no problems. Buy minnows in May, place two dozen in freezer bag put in freezer. Head to Canada in August and catch tons of fish. Would never waste my time with salt, etc."
6347300,CI_Guy,2019-08-05 10:25:00,2118,I'm not sure if that short exposure to the salt would do much to preserve the minnows. The borax will help maintain their color but I think the freezing is what is preserving your minnows. If they stay in the salt for 3 to 4 days there is an unbelievable amount of water that is drawn out of the minnows. The salt-borax mixture becomes a very watery slurry. The minnows become tough and leathery which helps them last longer on the hook. After 3 to 4 days in the salt I rinse them and pat them dry before bagging and refrigerating them so there is very little salt in the boat.
6348670,martinbns,2019-08-09 20:58:00,1520,"Guys use salted here on Lake Winnipeg in the winter, I don't get it the appeal. They fall off hooks in no time, not as effective as live, in the overall the cost of 24 minnows each day in a trip is nothing. If they aren't available I would simply use plastic. Try a fluke type minnow or even a ned rig on a light jig, just have to work the bait a bit. If you use the Zman stuff it lasts forever."
6348716,law57,2019-08-10 07:46:00,1147,"I wonder if anyone has ever pickled minnows? That is, actually pickle them in salted brine. I may have to do that the next time I make dill pickles. Lose the dill and see what happens after the minnows sit in brine, pickling, for a few months. A person could even incorporate some commercial fish scent. The question is, what would the finish product be like? Mush? Rubbery? You could put a ton of 2.5"" minnows in a quart jar! And once pickled, they'd last a long time. Do fish like garlic?"
6348822,CI_Guy,2019-08-10 14:33:00,2118,"When you pickle northern or herring the vinegar dissolves all the calcium in the bones and cartilage and turns them into a similar texture to the meat. There wouldn't be much holding the minnow together with the bones dissolved. I have had pickled smelt, they were pretty flakey and would have just fallen off a hook."
6349716,labsrus,2019-08-13 10:13:00,557,"Well guys, here is how they worked last week. Frozen salted minnows seemed to last for a few fish bites before being ripped up or taken by a fish. The minnows worked pretty good. I also had some Gulp minnows that worked pretty good as well. As a side note one of our party had purchased some fresh minnows and they worked just as well. The idea of using salted minnow sis not to save any money it is the ability to have bait that will catch fish"
6344562,Guest,2019-07-27 07:50:00,0,"I am headed up to Lac Seul next week and would like to bring some minnows from home. Do you all have a preference to just freezing them, or salting them first then freezing? Either way, I plan on vacuum sealing before putting in the freezer. btw...Ontario allows 10 dozen per person to be brought across the border. It is an Ontario fishing regulation, not a border regulation - so you won't see that on the customs site. We had prepackaged salted & preserved minnows for our last trip up and had to dispose a bunch when asked by the customs official. So be careful! We were not thrilled with the packaged / preserved salted minnows. Just nasty stuff."
6344574,CI_Guy,2019-07-27 08:36:00,2118,"I dislike frozen minnows because they turn to mush when they hit the water and don't stay on the hook very long.Salted then frozen are better but still get mushy and only last about as long as live bait on the hook.I salt my own in a mixture of 2 parts canning salt to one part borax, after 3 days I rinse them pat them dry and store in the fridge in ziplock bags. Make sure you start with live minnows. I've stored them for up to 4 months this way. They don't get mushy in the water and if you use long enough hooks so they can go in the mouth and come out the back behind the joint between head and body they'll last a long time. That joint is the weakest point. I have 1 dozen in each bag for easy counting at the border."
6344642,law57,2019-07-27 11:45:00,1147,"This is an interesting method... I just buy minnows at the camp I go to. I don't even know what a dozen cost this year. I was there for 12 days and used 14 dozen. They usually give me a 'large' dozen. I'm a frequent guest and I time well. Minnows, like gas, are just part of the price of the trip. If my camp charged $7.50/dozen I would have paid a little over $100 for two weeks of fishing. I think that's cheap - and the price of a lot of fun. And, it much less than the gas I use to get there and back. I shouldn't tell this story - but it was a long time ago and I no longer drink at all... Back in the early 80's my brother, his brother in law, and I went fishing in Canada for a week. On Saturday morning we bought 16 cases of LaBatt's Blue and three 1.75L bottles of Windsor. On Wednesday we had to go back to Dryden for more supplies. I was younger, tougher, and dumber back then. But, alcohol is no longer a cost factor in my fishing trips. Still, I can trap minnows 1/4 mile from my house. They are nice, 2.5"" rainbow chubs. I may try the canning salt and borax method to see how it works."
6344704,rutter,2019-07-27 15:58:00,19,"After using frozen in the past, decided to try salted vs. frozen this year. Frozen worked great as usual. With the salted minnows, fish would bite, but not hold on long enough to set the hook, so based on my limited experience with salted, frozen is still my bait of choice. However for the salted, we only had the larger size (4‚Äù) which might be a consideration. Yes frozen do get soggy, but you can minimize this by keeping them on ice until they are ready to use."
6344774,dschiebel,2019-07-27 23:52:00,85,"Have a bunch of salted shiners from our June trip still in the freezer , if any body want them. Live in Stillwater , Minn. Message me"
6344810,The tank,2019-07-28 07:39:00,340,I've tried them different ways and I would never just freeze them. There's a point where they're fine but once they get thawed out they're just mushy. The ones that are processed with borax and salt for us have worked the best. I just put mine in the refrigerator I dont freeze them. We get from best bait out of ohio. Lake erie shinners I like the large ones. Goodluck
6345180,labsrus,2019-07-29 10:04:00,557,"I will save my unused minnows from early trips for panfish I will put them in half borax and half salt. I have a plastic tote that I use with a lid, shake them up a bit to coat them good Freeze them in ziplock sandwich bags, dozen per bag as suggested. I will take them out of freezer in the morning and I have a small plastic pan to thaw them out in in lake water. Helps keep the salt out of the boat. Fish do not seem to notice the difference."
6345342,Guest,2019-07-29 19:06:00,0,"Thanks all for some great info. Labsrus - do you freeze right away, or do you let them sit in the salt mix for a while? Do you rinse off the salt mix before freezing?"
6345536,stumcfar,2019-07-30 10:41:00,451,The problem with salted is the mess of the salt getting into your reel and etc. Not too mention the cuts one ends up with all over from unhooking fish. I purchased a bunch from a place recommended on here for a trip earlier this year and they were a disappointing gob of more salt than shiners.
6345570,The tank,2019-07-30 11:53:00,340,Wash them off in the cabin sink and put them in a ziplock baggie. Works great.
