Fish was beat up pretty bad, and the eagle came back at some point and devoured the whole thing, leaving a musky skull and back bone on my lawn.VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/LQwujxRMocY"

Stop to think about this,......that's a pretty big fish to grab for food. Hope Roloff (spelling?) has eyes in the back of his head!! Chuck"

6347614,Limeyangler,2019-08-06 09:29:00,563,"We are more worried about the cats, unbelievable that we have never lost one, we have had at least 3 cats here, all outside cats, since we moved here 12 years ago, don't want to jinx the poor animals but with all the critters that I have seen on our lawn ( lynx, bears, foxes, coyotes, wolves, eagles, owls) its a matter of time I guess. They have even managed to avoid being sprayed by the numerous skunks that frequent the porch at night. I have not seen a porcupine around here ever, thank goodness!Quote: Originally Posted by ObabikonEagle just found it already dead. Scavenger birds!

6348038,Aspencreek,2019-08-07 20:27:00,2911,"Back in 1985 I was cruising around an island on Lac Seul slowly and saw an Eagle glide down and TRY and get a large walleye out of the water. It hit that fish and couldn't get back into the air with it on it's talons. It sat on the water for about 4-5 min with that fish struggling beneath it, then decided it was not built for sitting on the water and took off. The fish was flopping around at the surface, so we cruised over and netted it. Walleye, 29"" and around 5lbs, nice fish. 6 talon marks in its back and sides, so we took it back to the lodge, the next year it was on the wall in the lobby. And Limey....jealous of your property!!"
