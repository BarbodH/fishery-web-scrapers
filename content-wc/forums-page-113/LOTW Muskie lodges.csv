Whether it's because of location on the lake, etc, what lodges are considered the best? Please feel, to send me a private message. Thanks in advance for your insight."
6351118,Obabikon,2019-08-18 15:57:00,2370,There are certainly lodges who do more musky fishing than others. In the Morson area... Todd at Tamarack has a large focus on muskies. He's in a great spot for big fish.
6351120,BreezyPoint,2019-08-18 16:09:00,1581,Red Wing Lodge. http://www.redwinglodge.net. I will personally guarantee more are caught there than anywhere else on LOTW. Look at their charts on the website. I know a 56 inch fish was caught there a few weeks ago.Frank
