This past summer several great guys on this website helped me map some fishing areas for Long Bay and West so I am wondering if someone here might do the same. PM me you phone number so I can call. I have the maps and really appreciate knowing some places and where species are located before going. Walleye is the target species, but will certainly try for other fish. Thanks in advance. Might even be GPS coordinated from ice fisherman out of the area. I have a 21' walleye boat, but have respect for big water and what it can create. Hoping to stay closer to the resort as a 30 - 45 run west was required last July out of Long Bay."
