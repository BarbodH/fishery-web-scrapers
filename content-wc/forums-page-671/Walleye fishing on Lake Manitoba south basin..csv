562275,mcdee,2006-12-11 19:00:00,276,I've seen commercial fishermen catch 100 Walleye in a 100 foot long gill net first ice late November but not one on rod and reel.Whats going on. Are these fish feeding and on what? :confused:
562360,Guest,2006-12-18 17:09:00,0,"this year is slow, but once the water clears it should pick up"
562371,Guest,2006-12-19 12:50:00,0,That is sad.
562386,mcdee,2006-12-20 12:06:00,276,"I know the Walleye are down there but will not bite.I've tryed minnows salted and unsalted, worms, jigging spoons, tiny jigs but all I catch are Perch which is ok but a nice Walleye would be great.Maybe night fishing? Anyone ever catch walleye through the ice around Twin Beaches St Laurent?:confused:"
562432,Guest,2006-12-25 22:28:00,0,THE BEST SPOT IN MANITOBA RIGHT NOW IS LAKE DAUPHIN AT THE MOUTH OF THE TURTLE OR OCHRE RIVERS THE WALLEYE ARE JUST UNBELIEVABLE I DON'T ICE FISH BUT MY DAD DOES AND IT'S JUST UNBELIEVEABLE STARTED ON THE 21ST AND STILL GOING STRONG.
562457,Guest,2006-12-27 23:47:00,0,The perch bite can be outstanding and I think thats what the walleyes are chowing down on.
562458,manitobawalleye,2006-12-28 07:18:00,885,"there are a few places where you can actually target walleyes at times and be successful but the perch population as glen said keeps the walleyes occupied it is usually next to impossible to keep perch off your hook long enough to entice walleyes to bite manitoba .... a 100,000 lakes how many walleyes ???? i will never have enough time...."
