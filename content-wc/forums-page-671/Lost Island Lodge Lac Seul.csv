Is the location in or near a fishable population of muskie? if so, do any of their guides have muskie knowledge or are they and the camp more geared toward walleye? Thanks, JP Merics"

Cabins are way above average, boats are excellent and the owner works hard at making sure all their customers have a great time. They have a very knowledgable group of Guides and they put our group on plenty of Walleye. I have no first hand knowledge of the Muskie fishing prospects there but I'm sure that if you called them they would be able to share information with you and I believe they would be honest with you about your chances of catching Muskie with them. We have stayed at several Resorts on Lac Seul and Lost Island is as good as it gets. Good Luck,Mike Kansas"

Under Rates it says private boat dockage $15.00 Thanks for the feedback so far guys, Lac Seul is on my list of waters to hit in Ontario, Lost Island looks like a quality camp to experience it.

Lac Seul will provide a dozen lifetimes of fishing. We were there every month from May til close up in Sept. August was our personal favorite, fish are on the reefs, but can be great anytime. Also, there are a lot of quality fish close to camp, caught LOTS within sight of lodge. We did our share of runs to Vaughn Lake, Bear Narrows, Grassy, etc., but staying close will produce also. Cabins, boats (If you rent), docks, all first rate, and most importantly the staff is great. Have a son and daughter in law in Florida now, so haven't been to Canada the last few years, but would go back there in a heartbeat. Good Luck, recommend hiring a guide early during your trip, will help out a lot as far as techniques and locations."
