It looks like Jiffy or Stikemaster are the predominate choices from your responses and what was gleaned from reading other forums. I will probably have to sacrifice a little and go with a 2 horse because of weight concerns. Still open water here in central Illinois and the first chance to get to the cottage in Ontario is late January, so looks like there is plenty of time to start pricing and get something bought. Thank you. Steve"

Something light to throw in the Super Cub or snow machine would be a plus. Jiffy is predominate, but from your experience, is there a better choice? Thanks for any thoughts. Steve"
562413,guidedfishing,2006-12-23 08:37:00,531,I've had a Jiffy model 30 for as long as I can remember and it has always done the job. I believe there is some better technology out there now. good luck GF

562417,Guest,2006-12-23 19:15:00,0,I've run a jiffy for years and it does the job. There is better technology out there now. I borrowed an electric unit last time out and it was light and did a great job. I'll be keeping an eye on this unit over the winter and see how it makes out in thicker ice...that is if we get any.
562456,Guest,2006-12-27 23:40:00,0,I have a Jiffy 30 but if cost is not an issue I would get a Husquavarna.
562459,Crappie Kid,2006-12-28 11:04:00,1581,"I have a Strikemaster Lazer 8"" that I keep up north, and now a Strike Lite. The 1999 Lazer has always cut great and started without a problem. Currently it is leaking fuel. I need to tear into it to find out where (carb cover, fuel line???). The new Strike Lite has not seen any ice yet. That is probably because the nearst safe ice is 4 hours away."
562468,dewyg,2006-12-28 16:20:00,1006,I have the Jiffy 3hp with a 10inch blade. If I did not have a quad/snowmobile to haul it around I would definitly look for something alot less weight. But for durability the Jiffy is amazing it just keeps running non stop.
562469,joro2548,2006-12-28 17:26:00,14,"Used the Srike-Lite four stroke all last year and it is sweet and very light. Several trips to Canada with deep ice. Starts with easy pull and very quiet. After several years of a heavy Lazer that was hard to start,this thing is a dream. Kind of spendy but oh so sweeeet. And had no problem with it. -20 F started great."

562481,PJM,2006-12-29 00:02:00,3516,"Skylane Kind of an interesting question, but as far as power any of them with the 3hp tecumseh. The motor has been around for years and there is not much fo fixing it. When they get older or you have left the gas it it diaphram, needle & seat kit, some fuel line and a spark plug and you are up in running. As far as brand Jiffy or Strike Master either one I don't think you can go wrong. I myself like the Strike Master Lazer with the two cutting blades but it is a personal preference. The Jiffy 30 is ok but the Stealth STX with the same engine cuts better. Strike Master has the four stroke Robin engine and I have cut with them and they do a good job and is quite but I feel the 3hp Tecumseh has more power. The motor life on the four stroke is something I am not sure of but there is ton of those 3hp out there......"
