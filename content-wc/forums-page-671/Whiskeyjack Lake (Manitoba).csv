On the way back they flew us to the lodge and then onto a fixed wing twin engine plane that flew us to Winnipeg. I believe they now fly you from Winnipeg to the lodge and then to the outpost. I'd love to go back and would not hestitate to go but cost becomes an issue with others in the party so we've been taking trips to N. Minnesota instead. The cabin was comfortable and I loved the sounds of the Astutini Rapids right outside the bedroom window. Plus you have the options of fishing Hallen Lake. Fishing was excellent with the biggest Northerns being in the low 40's. We never did find any real big Walleye (over 26"") but were content with the abundance of 16""-22"" walleye. Once you found them it could be like fishing in a barrell. Northern were found in the cabbage and walleye seemed to be everwhere but my favorite spot was on the N.W. corner of Whiskeyjack near the McPhail river. We had no problems during the week and their equipment was excellent. The staff and service were excellent, I hope to back some day. SMS"

I think if you go to this lake in june it would be awesome we wen't in august 2003 it was hot and dry the rapids next to the cabin were dried up, and we had a heck of a time even catching enough eyes for lunch. but that is no barometer fo this place we just did't know what the #### we were doin. they told us later that we should have been vertical jigging in that heat oh well, I would love to go back but I would definetly go early in the summer though. bonuses is they have a regular bathroom,toilet,shower,sink. they have a generator for power, the have a chest freezer in the fish cleaning house to store extra bags of ice which is a huge plus for an outpost..It is less than great drinking warm beer on 90 degree day. been there done that.. anyway go for it you won't be dissapointed. any other questions just ask"
