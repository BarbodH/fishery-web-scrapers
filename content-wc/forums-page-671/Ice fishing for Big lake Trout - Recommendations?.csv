Don't want it to be too remote, however would like to get a chance at some bigger fish. I see Crow come up a lot, but my understanding is that although the #'s are good, the size is fairly small on average. Is Rowan easy to get back into? Is there anyone that can recommend a guide who does this stuff? It's simply too far to travel to figure it all out in a long weekend and be safe in unknown territory's. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated."

The resort is on an island on lower manitou lake, about 1 hr. north of Int'l falls. It is a boat in resort in the summer and I think you snowmobile in 5-7 miles in the winter. There web site is www.campmanitoufishing.net good luck - mark"
562215,v-bay gord,2006-12-05 15:37:00,3168,Check out Browns Clearwater west lodge by Atikokan www.brownsclearwaterlodge.com I believe the Ontario record lake trout (40 +) came out of there. They offer ice fishing and Barry is very knowledgable.

I don't know of any guides and have never used the services so I can't recomend any, but I'm sure there are lots to be found on line. If you really want to get into some lakers and have some time drive. Try The Pas MB , clearwater lake. Lots of big fish and tons of smaller ones. A long drive from the border for a long weekend."

562304,Minnow Man,2006-12-13 13:49:00,85,Talked with Faron from Cat Island lodge on Trout Lake the other day & he said he was going to open the camp for some winter ice fishing in March. You can get in by snowmachine & he'll guide you in from the landing. I plan on being there myself in March.

562332,Guest,2006-12-17 02:14:00,0,"We are heading up to Camp Manitou to do some Laker fishing the last weekend in june. We usually go to crow (last 5 yrs.)in the winter, but we liked the idea of going to a more isolated lake, rather that crow witch in just off the highway. We always take our sleds anyways so we thought we would make a little adventure out of it, the camp is about 7 miles off the cedar narrow road. We plan on fishing trout in the morning then snowmobiling over to a couple of the camps portage walleye lakes. It should be a great time, I think this is their first winter being open. Check them out www.campmanitoufishing.net"
