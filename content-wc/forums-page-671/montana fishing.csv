562449,Guest,2006-12-27 20:01:00,0,Hi. just trying to get a feel for fishing in the west a little. i have read a couple things about fishing for walleye and northern in the lakes behind some of there dams up there and it all sounds very good. like fort peck resovoir and some othere ones. has anyone fished any where up there and how did you do? I was looking for resorts on the net and there dont seem to be any around these lakes like there are around lake of the woods. lotw is packed with resorts. why dont these other lakes have fishing camps like that? ok thanks.

562483,Guest,2006-12-29 11:15:00,0,"pfish, if all you do is troll on erie, you don't know how to fish it. Jig, rig, cast, bottom bounce, troll -- every presentation I can think of produces eyes on erie - totally unlike peck. Guess you need some help? been there done it"

Daughter moved to Helena last fall and the wife and I are planning on a fishing trip in May or June. Been trying to decide on a campground on the north end of Canyon Ferry or the south end. The web site should offer some info about which end might be better during that time of the year."
562523,Guest,2007-01-02 13:05:00,0,"Canyon Ferry is my ""home"" lake. In May and June... you will want to fish the south end. The walleyes get very stacked on the river ""delta"" flats. ""The Silos"" recreation area is located right at the fishing. This lake can get very, very rough, and do so very quickly. You want to avoid long runs if possible. ""The Silos"" is only a 30 minute drive from Helena."
562537,phishfearme,2007-01-03 11:19:00,1242,"according to the FWP biologists, there was never any stocking of walleye done by them. i just confirmed this at:http://www.walleyesforever.com/cgi-b...wmode=threaded also, in the PA section of lake erie, the vast vast majority of eyes are caught trolling. the fish are almost always suspended and following bait schools. jigging just doesn't cover enough water. phish"
562552,Guest,2007-01-04 12:13:00,0,"After reading the whole thread in that link, I have my doubts. Apparently there are two versions as to how the walleyes got in that place. One version appears to be the official position and the other is what they want to forget."
