562333,Guest,2006-12-17 06:41:00,0,Has anyone ever tried fishing for Lake Trout in the deeper waters of Lac Seul? I have been tempted to take my down rigger and give it a shot. NE Piker
562335,180FH,2006-12-17 13:27:00,444,"Try Big Vermilion, right next door across 664. On cloudy days many LS guides will fish this lake. Also very good muskie and smallmouth also (beware> no live bait allowed)"
562339,Guest,2006-12-17 16:36:00,0,"Yes, there are lakers in Seul, but they are few and far between. You need to know where to look. You can try downrigging, but you should also try jigging them up, regular, heavy jigs, or bladebaits. As I said, very few and far between. NWO Fishing Bum"
562353,JDP,2006-12-18 12:06:00,1457,There was a 27lb Lake Trout caught out of Silver Water Wheel Lodge last June. Picture of the fish is on SWW's website @http://www.sww-lodge.com/reports.htm JDP.
562372,Guest,2006-12-19 13:15:00,0,"Keep in mind what the NWO Fishing Bum had to say, few and far between. I have been going to SWWL for about 6 years now and the pictured fish is only the second Laker I have heard being caught. There may have been more caught, but you don't go to LS for the laker fishing because I suspect you could do it for a week and not catch one. If you are at LS and your heart set on catching a laker, I would suspect your odds are a whole lot better at some of the other lakes close by that you could trailer to. Just an opionion...IA Walleye"
562455,guide7,2006-12-27 23:33:00,70,"Three years in a row I have wasted a day downrigging for trout on Bray Lake near SWWL. Nice deep access lake to Lac Seul and a lot of deep water markings from 60-80 feet deep. So far we have pulled up a 6 pound northern from 75 feet of water. Real exciting until we finally saw it. Then we caught a nice fat white fish in 80 feet. Both of these were vertical jigging. We had a load of fish once suspended 40-50 down, prime trout depth, and dragged the downriggers through them for about 5 hours and caught zero. No help from the locals on finding the trout either. It's like a yeddi sighting deal. Guide7 I will try it again!!!"
562460,Guest,2006-12-28 11:55:00,0,Been fishing Lac Seul for over 20 years and have never caught or seen a Lake Trout caught on Lac Seul. I have heard of some caught and I'm sure that some have been caught but if I wanted to catch Lake Trout I would find a different lake. In fairness to Lac Seul I have never targeted Lake Trout on Lac Seul and would not have the slightest idea on how to fish for them.
562479,Guest,2006-12-28 21:31:00,0,heard of any caught on the southern end of LS (by hudson)
562487,Guest,2006-12-29 17:23:00,0,You can catch Lakers on Abrams or Minnitaki
