562311,Guest,2006-12-14 09:58:00,0,"The cover you fish for smallies usually depends on the time of the year, water temp, wind conditions, etc. Specific patterns vary almost daily with weather conditions, but longer-term migration patterns are usually affected by the spawn and then forage movement. Here are some general thoughts: From ice-out to early June, start to look for smallies to move from deeper water into shallower water. Target the points and deeper structure leading to northern bays or coves. Look for drop offs, transition areas between rock and sand or sand and silt, and areas of new weed growth. Isolated deeper rock piles in 8-12' of water are also good locations. You can often identify migration routes they use as they move over a period of time. In mid-June to late June, start to look for smallies to move into shallower water to spawn. Look for small boulder-lined shorelines, shallow rock ledges and gravel covered northern shorelines. Areas where new weed/reed growth has started can also be good. After the spawn, look for smallies in slightly deeper water if they have moved from the previous locations. Depending on the water system, they may stay in nesting areas for a longer time if forage is good. Target isolated rocks, timber or vertical ledges in 6-8'of water. In a severe cold front they may temporarily move to a little deeper water, if forage seems to be affected. In mid-July through late-August, look for smallies to move to even deeper water. Target 12-20' deep reefs, rockpiles and steep ledges. Also, weedline edges or openings in weeds are also good locations to find smallies at this time. Chuck"

They were biting on some large spoons. This year I am gearing up to actually fish for Smallies. What do you experts recommend for top baits? I am gathering smaller spinner baits, shiny smaller spoons, curly tailed jigs, etc., but what are your top choices? Only 5 months to show time. NE Piker"
562264,Guest,2006-12-11 07:30:00,0,"Here's what we take on a trip to NW Ontario for smallies. We fish 95% of the time just for smallies: 1. 3-1/2"" or 4"" green pumpkin tubes with 3/16 or 1/4 oz tube jig heads. Road kill color was especially good this year! 2. 1/4 oz chartruse chatterbait with chartruse or white 3"" twister tail trailer 3. #7 to #9 perch, shad or baby bass colored shad rap 4. 4"" green pumpkin, white or bass colored worms with 1/8 to 1/4 oz jig head rigged shaky-head style 5. #3 copper or gold colored mepps. maybe even attach a 3"" charturse, yellow or white twistertail on one hook for a trailer. 6. 1/8-1/4 oz stanley baby wedge spinnerbait in perch, white or chartruse color 7. 1/4 oz baby bass or frog colored tiny torpedo 8. 1/4 oz baby bass, shad or perch colored Rebel Pop-R or Chug Bug 9. 3"" brown, chartruse, and shad colored twister tails with 1/16 to 1/4 oz jig head 10. 3"" or 4"" senko rigged weedless.

562276,Guest,2006-12-11 20:59:00,0,"schick, I've often wondered if there were any smallmouth on Lac Suel. I have been told by a few that Lac Suel is just a bit to far north to sustain a decent smallmouth population. I guess by your post the smallmouth population appears to be good enough in the area that you fish for you to target them specifically. Do you care to share what part of Lac Suel you fish. When do you fish for them and where do you stay? I've houseboated on both LOTW and Rainy Lake for the past 10 years and the smallie fishing has always come first with walleyes a close second when the smallie fishing was slow or we wanted fish for dinner. I've always wanted to fish Lac Seul but didn't want to give up the smallie fishing on LOTW or Rainy Lake. We will be headed to Camp Narrows in the Northwest Arm of Rainy next summer. We haven't been on Rainy for about 7 years. It will be nice to get back and we will enjoy the change of pace staying at a lodge rather than renting a houseboat. Thanks for your help Like2Fish"
562279,Guest,2006-12-11 21:59:00,0,I forgot to respond to you orginal question. We have fished LOTW for the past 7 years during the third week of June. Some years have been better than others with a few of the years being down right fantastic for smallie fishing. Our bait of choice for this time of year is a tube when fishing the rocks. 1/8 or 1/4 oz depending on the wind. I've been using a 3 1/2 inch white tube with silver and black fleck and a green with black fleck for the past couple of years. 1/2 oz rattle traps in the silver/blue color work well too for a change of pace. When fishing the reeds I use a 1/2 oz spinner baits in white. For the past couple of years I have had a blast when the wind is calm using a 4 or 5 inch pearl fluke with no weight on my bait casting tackle. This combo has become my favorite presentation when the smallies are shallow and the conditions are just right. Like2Fish
562289,Heff,2006-12-12 17:13:00,102,Anyone have any sucess fishing for smallies at Onaway?
562296,Noel,2006-12-13 09:50:00,115,"Heff, good question. I was also wondering if there are some locations I could get to from Onaway for smallies. I only caught 2 of them last year, both enormous, both real shallow, in July. I was casting for pike. I hope to find some more this year and spend more time looking for them after we are done with walleye fishing each day. I would prefer to fish for smallies, even if they are hard to find, then pike. Hope someone can clue us in...."
562308,prov1900,2006-12-13 21:32:00,544,"We went to the Mackenzie Bay area for ours. Side by side with the walleyes, jig and minnow, in the fall. All nice fish. Love to catch smallmouth. Nice thing about Lac Seul, no one will stand in your way if you want to catch smallies. Everyone is there for the walleyes."
562309,Guest,2006-12-14 07:02:00,0,"To: Like2Fish We stay at Mahkwa Lodge. Last year we caught smallies everywhere that we were fishing for pike, but we had our best luck in the river that flows into Lac Seul across the lake from Mahkwa. The deeper water along the rock faced shore seemed to be a great spot. I am no expert though, to my next question for the group is what kind of structure/water conditions should I really focus on to specifically fish for smallies? Thanks for all the great advice on baits. NE Piker"
562310,Hump,2006-12-14 09:12:00,578,"Why are there few smallies in the NW section of Lac Seul. I'm not sure if there are any smallies. We fish out of Evergreen, how far do you need to go to get into them?"
