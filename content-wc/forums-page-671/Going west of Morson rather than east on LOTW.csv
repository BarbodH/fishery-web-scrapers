I am looking to go west a few times on my next trip in July and just was wondering if there are more or less weed cover as you go west through basil, or painted rock channels? I am not looking for anyone's hotspots, but just an overall idea of what I would be looking at. Sabaskong bay is full of structure, but I am looking to get away from people a bit more and am not sure if this direction will get me any better.. Anything will help. Thanks Steve"

562328,rpieske,2006-12-16 16:05:00,1276,"I like the Stevens Bay area also, but it is North and East of Morson. If you want to fish the area west from Morson, perhaps stay in the Northwest Angle area and fish East from there. Lots of good structure for muskies all the way over to Miles, Sabakoshing, Burrow, etc. Fishing the whole summer out of Nestor Falls last year, I never found someone on my spots and usually never saw more than 6-7 muskie fishermen in any one day. I cover a 30-50 mile loop and noticed that the number of muskie fishermen was way down last year. You don't have to leave because of too many fishermen and you might try heading Northeast like Deweyg said. You will probably like it."
562334,VMS,2006-12-17 08:15:00,1103,"Wow!! Last July, it seemed they were everywhere out around round island area. We had boats all over in the area. We still had places to fish, but I didn't expect to see as much as we did. I've never gone into Steven's Bay at all...been up close to the portage and hay island area too but have not spend a great deal of time there. I'm looking to expand to more areas in both directions. thanks!! Steve"
562337,River_eye,2006-12-17 14:22:00,1486,"I got to observe this area of LOTW from a plane quite a few times this past summer, and I would say the weed cover is pretty constant from sabaskong out to stevens and miles."
562343,rpieske,2006-12-17 19:38:00,1276,"Round Island is one of my favorite areas, also. There was one week in July when I noticed lots of boats in the area. I had forgotten about that. Must be my age. In fact I talked with several different people that day. Don't know if you were one of them. I fish out of a black/grey Lund 1900 ProV IFS with Missouri numbers. Steve, give me a shout before you come up this summer and I'll fill you in on patterns, etc. Merry Christmas."

Most of our fishing is for walleyes but we have done well on Pike and a few muskie, my son caught a monster in that area. You definitely will not see many boats in that area. We go through Painted Rock to get to our area. Let me know if you would like anymore info.
