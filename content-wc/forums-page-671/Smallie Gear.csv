562431,Guest,2006-12-25 19:23:00,0,"I received some very helpful tips on baits to use on smallies at Lac Seul. My wife bought me a St. Croix 6'6"" Fast Action Medium Power rod and Shimano Stradic 2500 spinning outfit that will be equipped just for smallies at Lac Seul. What tips can anyone give me for what line type and test I should put on the reel. Knowing that I will get some pike hits on it is there anything special I should do? I want to give the smallies my very best effort. Thanks PS - 5 months to day and counting that we leave for Lac Seul. NE Piker"
562433,guidedfishing,2006-12-25 22:42:00,531,"I have three St Croix's with similiar setups in the rod weight and action. I have several different spools of line depending on what I'm doing, but 10-12 lb fireline keeps ending up on the reel the majority of time. You have a nice rig enjoy. GF"
562434,Guest,2006-12-26 07:46:00,0,"I can't really help you on the spinning gear, since I only use it for walleye. I use biatcasting combos for smallies, pike, etc. and typically use 8# mono or florocarbon. I do use a 4-6"" titanimum leader when up north, just because of the pike and musky. I make them myself out of 20# wire, bell swivels and clips. The titanium leaders hold up very well. I used stranded wire leaders in the same size before making our own. Chuck"
562436,v-bay gord,2006-12-26 14:28:00,3168,Its been my experience that mono will catch more bass than a braided super line.....less visible.
562437,rpieske,2006-12-26 14:35:00,1276,I use PowerPro line in 20 lb. and under. I tie a 6' fluorocarbon leader with a double uni knot to the PowerPro. This rig has worked very well for smallies and walleye. I also use a similar setup for fishing inshore saltwater fishing. I like the sensitivity of the PowerPro coupled with the clarity of the fluorocarbon leader. You can change the diameter of the leader depending on needs. I usually have to go pretty stout in saltwater. I've never had a line break yet and the superlines last for years when rotated.
562438,dewyg,2006-12-26 18:51:00,1006,I also use PowerPro line in 12 lb. and under. I tie a 6' fluorocarbon leader with a double uni knot to the PowerPro.
562440,River_eye,2006-12-26 19:38:00,1486,"I've learned that if you're fishing bass, you need to go either mono, or fluorocarbon. I use powerpro with P-line fluoro carbon leader, but learned the hard way to go with at least 12 lb test, and somtimes even 17 lb test, it will save you some baits and still catch fish."
562442,Guest,2006-12-27 07:02:00,0,"I appreciate all of the advice and I will go with the heavy super pro kind of line with the flourcarbon leader. I just have a dumb question. I have never used leaders and have never really understood the purpose other than of course to have a lighter, more invisible line. Is the main purpose of the heavy line, so that you will not break off a large portion of your line? Do you use the same concept when fishing largemouth bass in heavy cover? It would seem to me that you would snap that leader off pretty quick when trying to crank a fish out of heavy cover. Anyway I would appreciate you dumbing down an answer to where and when I should use a leader. Us Husker fans just want more power on everything. Thanks NE Piker"
562443,Guest,2006-12-27 08:26:00,0,"I will go against the grain a little. We use the same monofilament(stren) and we never use any type of leader for anything. Now if would be lying if I told you we have never been bitten off but to be perfectly honest we get bitten off 2-3 times on a trip. We have caught northerns/muskies up to 49"" and hav enever used any line larger than 12lb and use mostly 10lb line. The primary reason is I am not comfortable using a steel leader as I feel it cost me bites. I have never used any type of flourocarbon line(s) so I am no help there. IMO if we are fishing baits that are moving like spinnerbaits,crankbaits,rattletraps etc I don't think it makes any difference. This past year we caught the majority of our smallmouths on topwaters and there were a lot of times when they would strike the lure 2-3 times on the same cast before getting the bait(talk about exciting and trying to make yourself not set the hook until you feel the fish!!)."
562493,pikemike,2006-12-30 03:11:00,95,"ok, LNVLL - how's this for dumbing down an answer...it doesn't matter what you rig up because you never could catch any fish anyway! kidding. i'd use the smoke fireline with 12# floro 5 feet leader for the smallies and use a completeley different rig for largemouths in heavy weeds, that rod is too nice to yank bass out of the weeds."
