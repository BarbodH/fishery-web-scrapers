562317,Guest,2006-12-14 18:17:00,0,They seemed to like white the best at Res Gouin last year. I am out of those but have plenty of chartruese and yellow.
562318,millerltman0905,2006-12-14 20:21:00,2,You should have told them about the orange color that we spanked them on last year!!!!
562321,Guest,2006-12-15 09:33:00,0,"CAN'T GIVE AWAY ALL OF THE SECRETS MILLERLITEMAN...LOL TO BE HONEST, I WOULD NOT HAVE CAUGHT A FISH WITHOUT THE ""GUIDE"" IN THE BOAT AND HIS ENDLESS SUPPLY OF COLD LIBATIONS! LOL"
562322,Guest,2006-12-15 11:50:00,0,"This past year our group had the best luck with 3"" minnow grub in black. Three years ago we had the best luck with the same thing in brown. We had guys in the group fishing with live leeches and the Gulp was just as effective. Some of the guys were cutting their Gulp in 1/2 and that didn't reduce its effectiveness."
562323,Guest,2006-12-15 12:29:00,0,"We have good success with the black 3"" gulp leeches on the Winnepeg River. Most of the time they are just as effective as regular leeches, and when they aren't you can periodically hop them off the bottom to pickup on a reaction type bite. After a dozen or so walleye, a couple temporary hangups and a few weeds, the end will begin to rip out on the jig head. Just pinch off 1/4"" and thread it back on like a twister tail and you're good to go for another dozen or so. Chuck"
562347,lobo1,2006-12-17 22:49:00,734,"I can't catch a cold on that stuff here on the mighty Saginaw Bay but in Canada....the stuff is AWESOME!! We have had our best luck on the natural looking bait that you mention - black over light grey/white - the pattern we use is called smelt....I took 15 bags of it in the split tail 3-4"" minnow. We used it this year on Lake St Joseph. We generally could use just about anything to catch walleyes but when things slowed down to almost no bites (rare) - we put on a gulp and pulled in some more. We didn't use it all the time for two reasons : 1) cost more than Powerbaits 2) not NEARLY as durable as Powerbait Steve"
562403,Guest,2006-12-21 18:23:00,0,orange huh? I wonder if that looks like yellow in the darker waters. I'll try to have afew of each available as well as the black leeches. I tried them for seatrout the other day and the fish tore those gulp worms apart right away and I was not getting too many bites per bait. I was surprised the worms were not very durable.
562411,tjsker,2006-12-23 07:11:00,301,Does anyone us the minnow instead of the minnow grub?
562414,Guest,2006-12-23 09:23:00,0,"I was trying to weed out the smaller fish, so I had tried the 5"" Gulp Saltwater Swim Shad and they did good. I have the minnow in my bag but forgot to try that. They have something else called the Shaky Shad that I will bring up next year as well."
562453,guide7,2006-12-27 23:09:00,70,"The white 3"" minnow grub on a white/orange flow jig head is the best I have ever used on Lac Seul. 3 in the boat one morning,110 ""eyes"" and I caught 40 of them while my boat mates using live bait had 35 each. They kept digging for another leech while I just unhooked my ""eye"" and tossed the grub back in the water for another catch. About 10 fish per grub is not too bad. Just because they get bit up a little doesn't mean toss'm. 2 - 25 count bags in the tackle box lasted a 4 day trip. Lost more to the rocks, along with everything else on the line, with my ""expert"" jigging technique. Guide7"
562190,thunderatwork,2006-12-04 09:34:00,79,"which gulp bait have been successful on flyins? I tried some last year and was not impressed with the six inch worms,(short bites). I also had a minnow gulp in two tone black/silver that worked well. However i have not been able to find it in any store since. Any one know what color in cabelas i was using? they list the colors,however nothing looks like the color i had."
562192,jigman 2003,2006-12-04 10:36:00,981,"I've had good success with the 3"" twister tail minnows in yellow, pink and white. Also have good luck with the nightcrawlers on spinner rigs and jig heads. I do cut them into at least two pieces when I put them on a jig head, eliminates most short hits. I used the 4"" split tail minnows last year with good results too, but did have more short hits with them. Don't know the specific color/bait you are inquiring about."
562193,dave10,2006-12-04 10:41:00,342,"Don't know about fly-ins, but medium chartruese twister tails worked best for us last year on Lac Seul (far better than the black and white minnows). Dave"
562198,Guest,2006-12-04 17:59:00,0,"I used 3"" Chartreuse and orange Gulp minnowgrub with a 1/4 ounce matching colored jig. Caught 90 percent of my fish with this. Best plastic I have ever used. This was on Lac Seul last year which is stained water so bright colors are good."
562297,nitroman,2006-12-13 10:55:00,368,"Best luck for me was with 3"" lindy munchies in chartruese silk and moonlight pink"
562299,jigman 2003,2006-12-13 11:07:00,981,"I do love that silk chartreuse color. It has produced more fish for me than all others combined the last 6 years in Canada. Doesn't matter what form the plastic is either, plain tails, scented tails, etc."
562303,Guest,2006-12-13 13:23:00,0,"I've read many positive testimonials regarding Gulp baits. Last year on the west arm of Lake Nipissing I tried them a couple times. We were pulling harnesses, and I tried both the chartuesue and the natural worm. The first time I didn't have a walleye hit and switched back after an hour's fishing and one pike and a few perch. The second time we were on a hot bite, but we were low on crawlers. I wanted to give my wife every opportunity to catch fish so I switched to Gulp. I never had a hit. Between my wife and my buddy and his wife in another boat they hooked a fish every 5 minutes for about an hour. The bait looked great in the water, but apparently not to the fish. Next year I'll leave the Gulp at home."
562305,Guest,2006-12-13 18:46:00,0,"Does anyone know what color they may prefer at O Sullivan Lake in Quebec? We are heading up towards the end of July and I have read a few posts here of the fishing there, but specific baits aren't covered too well. Thanks"
562306,WIPP,2006-12-13 19:26:00,75,Caught hundreds on Lac Suel with GULP twisters - 3 and 4 inch in white and chartreuse. Also did well on Mille Lacs this year on a hot bite with spinner harnesses and GULP crawlers when they actually did a bit better than natural crawlers - I think I caught 8 walleyes on the same one. In both situations the walleyes were biting well.
562312,Guest,2006-12-14 10:23:00,0,"I THINK IN TEA-STAINED WATERS...WHITE, YELLOW OR CHAR. IS BEST CLEAR WATER.... I WOULD GO WITH THE BLACK AND SILVER (NATURAL) LOOK.... THE LAKE WE FLY -INTO WE USE GULP 90% OF THE TIME...IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF $ TO BUY LIVE BAIT AGAIN BECAUSE THE GULP WORKS SO WELL AND HOLDS UP REAL WELL TOO."
