562450,Guest,2006-12-27 21:06:00,0,"I was at Temple Bay for a few days in 06. Though I did not ride their bus, I found their operation to be 1st. class in every way. Every other guest that I talked to when there loved the place. The food and service was awesome. If the fishing is slow on Eagle they also offer day trips to Lac Suel. Best Fishes --- ggg"
562452,tly,2006-12-27 22:09:00,1900,I have had employees and more recently friends take the full bus trip. They absolutely love it. Keep in mind these are not fanatic fisherfolks but are savvy enough to know when they are having fun and value. One couple makes it an annual event. Not my kind of fishing but these folks are good testimonials for Temple Bay.
562462,dave10,2006-12-28 12:25:00,342,"My boys and I have been up there five times in the last six years, and took the bus from Milwaukee on four of those trips. We only stopped because we now trailer our own boat. I can't sleep well on the bus personally, but the boys have had no trouble. The bus is very new, very clean, and air conditioned. They feed you sandwiches and beer or soda on the way up, and show two movies (usually newer releases) before lights out at about 11 pm. The bus makes at least three or four smoke/bathroom stops, and it's about a twelve to thirteen hour ride from Milwaukee. The food and accommodations are great at the lodge. Different meals every night - pork chops, spaghetti, steak, etc. The lake is probably not a walleye purists' first choice, but there are plenty of northern, smallies and muskies, and so the variety is nice. They don't go out of their way to put you on fish, in contrast to other lodges I've heard about, but people get the hang of it pretty quickly once they venture out of the bay. We started going because a client of mine had been going there for ten or twelve years straight. He's still going strong. Good luck! Dave"

When it boils down to it , do we go on vacation to catch and slab lots of fish or relax, forget about our worries and enjoy the company. This is what keeps me going to Eagle on opening weekend, just being with my buddies and getting on the lake is the real prize, if I get fish its a bonus."
562476,Rich B,2006-12-28 20:14:00,1081,"Thanks for all the responses.....I normally trailer my 1900 Pro-V up north to mid/eastern Ontario, though I've never fished western Ontario and heard good reports of Eagle Lake fishing (multi-species). Have recently rec'd Temple Bay Lodge info - would be a day's drive to their Chicago bus pick-up location, and then let them do the driving north (for a change). Anyway, am getting my plans together for '07 Canadian fishing trips, and appreciate your information on Temple Bay Lodge/Eagle Lake. Rich B"
