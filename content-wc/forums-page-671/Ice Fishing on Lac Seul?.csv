562486,Guest,2006-12-29 16:49:00,0,Do a lot of people ice fish on Lac Seul and if so how successful are they? Do any resorts rent out houses or guide from snowmaobiles with portables?
562488,eyewall,2006-12-29 18:18:00,201,"As I understand it, it is not ice fished, much, if at all. The water levels are dropped all winter and the ice is not suitable / safe. This is a palce I ahve looked at regarding ice fishing. I spoke with someone years ago and they are the only operation I know of that does ice fishing in the area. I believe he said that they do not fish lac seul however, more on surrounding lakes.http://www.manitoufalls.com/ice_fishing.htm"
