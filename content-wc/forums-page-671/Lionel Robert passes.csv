He was the weighmaster for several tournaments and was always involved with getting the Lund catch and release boat for the tournaments. He taught a lot of us in Red Lake about the importance of proper handling of the fish we caught and how to protect them for the survival during the course of the tournaments and in every day fishing activities. Lionel passed away on Dec 27 from a heart attack in Winnipeg and he will certainly be missed by the tournament anglers of this region. It is truly amazing how he influenced a lot of Red Lake fishermen to practice catch and release."
