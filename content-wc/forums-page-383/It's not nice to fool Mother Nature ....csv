Good grief, walleye season opens in 16 days up north. Will the ice be out (especially on the Indian Lake chain near VB for us) or will Mother Nature post the latest opener in history? I don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised if someone blames it on global warming!! :-)Anyway, see the attached pic. I suspect there will be some people who will be looking like this on the opening day!Best Wishes to All,81Saluki"
