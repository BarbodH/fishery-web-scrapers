Can see open water in most of the Big Narrows area and Angle Inlet area, specifically Near Flag Island and Oak Islands. Open water also at the south end of the lake at the mouth of the Rainy but that has been there quite a few days. Here is a link to a local webcam on the north side of Flag Island. http://www.yahooey.com/ Click on the link, then click on Pan Zoom Tilt Camera. Click on motion and choose a motion interval. Then click on any preset 2 through 7. This just made my day. Thirteen days till the opener!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
