I know it's up in the river and should be pretty sheltered, but looking at the map there looks like there could be some really good water across the big part of the lake. Just curious if it would be worth the trek across the lake, or if there is plenty of good water in the river and the bay they are located in. I'd also be up for some walleye and smallmouth fishing though. Any suggestions would appreciated thanks."

The perimeter of that large open part of the lake has what you are looking for........Coleman's Reef, Windigo Point, Swansons Island... It would also be valuable to consider hiring a guide to take you musky fishing for as many days as you can swing it."
1688729,fishguide1800,2013-04-18 14:17:00,84,Those are great spots gord told you to fish.just got to pick a number to fish.everybody and their dods will be there to.you wojld be better to gind yourself some good looking area and work it.theres lots of muskies in all of eagle.gords just trying to keep you away from us guys up north.lol.right gord.you wont have any problem catching walleyes near there either.it will be real busy.if you like crowds you will be fine.good luck.
1689441,v-bay gord,2013-04-18 17:39:00,3168,Those are just points of reference. There is no need to fish where everyone else is. One other boat is too many for me........
1689465,tackleman,2013-04-18 17:45:00,444,"well vbay gord, I pulled out my eagle lake map and couldn't find any of the spots you mentioned. Soooooo, I guess I won't be trying any of them."
1690209,v-bay gord,2013-04-18 20:41:00,3168,Tackleman.........you need to find a Hot Spot map.....those spots are all listed. Too far from where you are though.......and there are many good spots near you. Pay me a visit this summer and I might have a few tips for you. The only reason I suggested those areas is because the poster is staying on that end of the lake........my old stomping grounds from many years ago.
1692577,Mully,2013-04-19 13:45:00,145,"Its been a while and knew the old owners (Barz's) but the group that would target musky were always beyond Osbourne Bay Nivens Bay rings a bell. It was a hike from the resort. There was one 10 year old that caught and landed a 48"" from the river using a bass spinnerbait. Dad was so proud and that young boy greeted everone at the dock asking how they did. He then proceeded to tell that story for the next 4 days - He is a musky fisherman for life. What was funny was that dad grumbled that in the 6 or so years he was going to canada - he never caught a legal musky. He was one proud papa however."
1724713,troutwater,2013-04-29 11:27:00,299,"Thanks for the info Gord. What color is the water on that part of the lake...tea? I'll probably give the walleye and smallies a shot as well, so looking forward to see what the river has to offer there."
1725377,v-bay gord,2013-04-29 14:26:00,3168,"The further south you travel from the main section of Eagle the darker the water becomes....with Osbourne / Niven Bays being a tea color. Where you will be most likely I would say is on the green spectrum.....pretty clear, but not like the trout end (west) on the lake."
