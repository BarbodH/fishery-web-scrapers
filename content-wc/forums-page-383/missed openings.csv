It is pretty much in that place where the blue touches Lake Superior (slightly north). Good luck growing anything there that isn't frost hardy. Most of the lakes that you will be going to are in that part of NW Ontario where the climate is a whole lot more amicable. I spent the day outside in my t-shirt. The birds are showing up in droves."
1720449,Minnow Man,2013-04-27 19:52:00,85,Hello Golden Eagle Drove over the Balmertown bridge this afternoon & the ice is onlyt 20' feet from Brett's dock. The Chukuni River has enough open water to fly his Beaver off the water right now. You'll have no worries for May 17th.
1725825,Whopper,2013-04-29 18:02:00,340,That's good to hear! I was with Golden Eagle in 2008 and will be in his group again this year
1714105,2746,2013-04-25 11:21:00,3206,Will you lose the week entirely or could you change lakes (further south) and save your trip?
1714769,Burr,2013-04-25 16:15:00,8612,"Complete cancel, even if it warms up, no rebooking.We'll find another place, always do. We have a group of about 25 that do this 5 times a year from April through August. We'll get it done."
1715433,2746,2013-04-25 20:02:00,3206,5 times! I envy you. Sounds like a good time.
1716641,Burr,2013-04-26 10:10:00,8612,"It's a Walleye club organized event, surprising enough the issue is participation. I've always communicated to our club members the reason they are not going to them, is because they have never gone to one. If they go one time, and fishing is a true interest for them, they would go again and again. We will usually have 15-25 attending, but have had as many as 80.Once a month - ""Family, camping, fishing weekend outing"" that runs April through August.Arrive Friday, early season we may stay at motel (too cold to camp!), but most of the season, tents and campground. People make their own reservations, often at State Park Campgrounds - which fill up fast. So planning ahead is a must. Setup Camp, some fish, some even decide to take an extra day off work and arrive Thursday, some don't take any time off work, and arrive Friday Evening.Sat - 0515 coffee goes on. By 0600 breakfast is ready, this is about as late as you can be or you go hungry. 0630 - breakfast and camp cleanup - we keep a clean camp.0700 - getting boats ready, head to ramp0730 - by now we've helped each other launch, park, maybe have some boat hopping (put it this way - I don't have any kids, but I get to fish with other peoples kids often! lol). And, we are fishing.0730-1500 - this is the fun part, we are all fishing, but the other part is, we all communicate with each other - the goal is to have everyone catch fish. We do keep CRR data as a kids and adult competition, but the compete portion is really secondary, it's primarily to find, figure out, and catch fish - share and learn what's working collectively. During this time, often, a Dad might have to return to the campground to pickup his wife and teenage kids that don't think it's fun to get up at 0500, lol...1500-1530 we all take out at the same time, helping each other load up.1530-1700 - if people keep fish, clean them, get back to campground, start making evening meal, sometimes shorelunch is planned, sometime we just plan on steaks instead. 1700-whatever, the kids have formed their own pack and do kids things together, the adults clean up after lunch, maybe wet our whistles, sit around the campfire and wonder/discuss what the poor people are doing, and try to figure out exactly how many satelites there are up there in the night sky.Sunday - repeat, except we've got to work-in packing up camp, and head home. Often the campground will let us leave the tents up to the end of the day so we are packing up dry tents, instead of dew covered tents at 6 AM.Sometimes on Saturday we fish a little later, so we can end Sunday an hour earlier to get home at a reasonable hour. Other than being an FM Walleyes member, which is $25.00 a year, we are a wide open group that would be thrilled to meet new people. Since we are Fargo based - trips are 2-3 trips ""close"" and 2-3 trips ""far"" with far being 120-200 miles, close being within 120 miles of Fargo.Due to snow, we had to cancel April on Missouri River south of Bismarck. May 19 is now challenging too with the ice and campground availability. Headed to Mille Lacs in June, and I'm not sure where the plan is in July and August - Lake Osakis in the Alexandria area is one of them. As you can imagine, we experience about everything a camper can experience over the years. From 3-4 foot snowstorms, to flooded campgrounds, no fish caught, to perfect weather and a great bite. It's a real dose of reality, every trip - and imo one of the best ways a family can spend time together, as well as with friends, make new friends.We're looking for people from the Des Moines area..."
1717681,Minnow Man,2013-04-26 16:15:00,85,"Drove up the hwy 105 to Red Lake today, Cedar Creek is open water, Trout River has open water at the bridge, Chukuni River is open water, Stoney Creek is just starting to show open water. Snow is melting fast... temps in the high 50's to-day. Looks like warm temps will be around for the next few days, plan on being on the water for the opener on Gullrock Lake."
1717721,bigwalleye1,2013-04-26 16:24:00,2632,"Unfortunately, Minnow Man is talking about Florida 105."
1719057,Dogbreath,2013-04-27 07:23:00,494,My son who lives in Sioux Lookout says a couple of camp owners are starting to get a bit nervous about opening week up there. He sent some pics about cutting ice a couple of weeks ago and there was still over a foot of it. Fishing two weeks ago and it took the whole shaft of the auger to find water.I will call him later today and post what I find.
1719161,Golden Eagle,2013-04-27 07:59:00,2642,My plans are for our party of six to fly May 17 from Chukuni River at Red Lake to a rather shallow lake north of Red Lake. Our lake will be among the first to breakup. If we're a few hours late getting away we'll mingle with some nice people in Red Lake. In 2008 we waited four hours for a wind shift to move ice from the area near camp so our float plane could land. Fishing was OUTSTANDING!
1719233,Dogbreath,2013-04-27 08:14:00,494,"Just talked to the kid in SL and while there is still 2 ft of ice and 1 of snow on Big Sandy, apparently the warmer forecast has taken the pressure off opening day. It seems to be going pretty quick, but keeping your fingers crossed couldn't hurt.He also has about 18 inches of snow in the middle of his backyard, but that could be a bit of drifting."
1719777,Basskicker,2013-04-27 13:13:00,9,"This was from 3-4 hours ago in Manitouwadge,ON.....still 40+ inches.... barely made it though with the extension......just crazy for this time of year!! Might need my auger for opener......I hope not."
1710025,gmattbruin,2013-04-24 09:59:00,174,"There is alot of experience on this board, wether it be fishermen or outfitters. So the question is,in all the yrs has an outfitter had to cancel an opening until say June because of still frozen lakes. If the conditions in the Nakina, and north of there for example continue, obviously iceout will be delayed,therefore the spawn is delayed. Im sure once the sun gets high,some decent temps the ice will breakup fast but its crazy late!"
1710081,2746,2013-04-24 10:15:00,3206,"Been fishing the Eagle/Red Lake area for 40 years in the spring but not always opening week. In all that time we have not lost an opening week trip totally but have been delayed a day or two. Each of those were in conjunction with an early opening week (3rd Saturday fell early) but being there as the ice went out was an unique experience. I doubt a delay until June would occur but the potential loss of that first week would be a real economic hit on lodge owners. Hope it doesn't come to that but this year is sure looking ""iffy"". 70 degree days are coming to Iowa this weekend with mid 40's at night......hope those temps can find Canada."
1710297,Skywagon,2013-04-24 11:05:00,1106,"The latest ice-out for Wabigoon (at Dryden) since the 1930's was May 22nd. Our group of friends has a pool going and the latest guess so far is May 23rd. The farther north, the later the ice out."
1710473,tackleman,2013-04-24 11:56:00,444,in 23 years on gullrock the latest for our bay is May 25 in 1999.
1711433,Obabikon,2013-04-24 17:05:00,2370,"Family has been in Morson on LOTW's for 43 years... latest anyone could say we got out to the camp by boat was May 10, in the early/mid 70's."
1712409,bluegussler,2013-04-24 21:19:00,124,Here is a list of ice out dates for wabagoon. Interesting
1712857,gmattbruin,2013-04-25 06:28:00,174,"to have those records is amazing. To see tht in the 40s,it basically is very similar to 90s and 2000. Its in the 60s into 70s when there was a consistancy of later iceout...all in May. Not sure how much the ""global warming debate"" would play into this but it is interesting nonetheless. I also find nature amazing in how we sit here now,lakes frozen solid, but nature has a way of averages. Once tht sun gets high,it will break up so fast and be gone,fish will spawn and all is good in our world. Never a need to panic when it comes to nature...it takes care of itself!!"
1713049,Kevin R,2013-04-25 07:12:00,305,"I remember 1978-79 being very cold winters, April came & it warmed up fast newspapers ran photos on border lakes with ice fishing in swim suits record highs 70-80 mid April day after day. In 78-79 ice went in mid May. Today I checked Kabetogama 7am 26, but last week it was calling for 70 today for high don't think it will get there it needs to start warming up to melt, this could be the record the way it's going. We are having March like weather in Florida now."
1713153,2746,2013-04-25 07:26:00,3206,That was one of the two years we saw the ice go out. We were at 5 lakes. The river of course was out and the bay breaking up.
1713233,Burr,2013-04-25 07:47:00,8612,"Had our reservations cancelled last week by a resort - the reasoning, even if the ice is out, I have all my docks on the campground, there will be no way I have the docks moved by that date.We're tent campers, there does not seem to be any feeling of loss for losing a tent camper reservation. They'd rather rent the cabins."
