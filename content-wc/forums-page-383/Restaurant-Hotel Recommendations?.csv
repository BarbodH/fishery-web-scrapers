We are looking for a good place to eat and a decent hotel to stay at on either side of the border. Our preferences are as follows: 1.) Restaurant that serves alcohol, and 2.) Within walking distance of the hotel. We have read on here about Antlers and Boston Pizza, but are familiar with neither or the area in general. Thanks in advance, John"

Everyone was up there for the Mackinac Bridge walk. Hotel was adequate and there were several restaurants in walking distance."

Right across the parking lot is Studebakers restaurant & lounge, with several other places relatively close by. http://www.daysinn.com/hotels/michig...hotel-overview"
