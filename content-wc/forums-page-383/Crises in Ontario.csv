Even if you go over your duty free exemption, be honest and pay the duty and taxes to the Cunucks. It's still Waaaay cheaper than buying your bottles north of the 49. $40 for 24 cans of Labbat Blue in Ontario, thats crazy talk!"

In the small town that I live in that got sucked into the major city of Ottawa, it is still ran by the folks who run the coffee shop/gas station/hardware store and bait store. You can pay for worms, soda and beer all at the same counter. Most smaller rural area's have kind of the same set up in Ontario and they won't be on strike."
1726793,Guest,2013-04-29 22:18:00,0,Grocery stores will be affected because the trucks will not deliver to them once they are on strike. My son and his dad crossed the border last week to buy alcohol for his 21st birthday party next month. 60s were $10 - $9 if you bought 6 or more. So $72 for the 8 60s they bought (at that price - stocking up for the potential strike plus the big party!). With duty etc they paid around $280 for what would have been over $600 in Canada. I hate out shopping but I also hate strikes. Minimum wage people are NOT happy when overpaid (did I say that?) government employees refuse to work unless they get - what? I work hard for 12 bucks an hour cutting meat and am proud of what I do and love to go to work. Obviously the LCBO people aren't happy. What do they want? Look around guys! We can only support you for so long.
1713889,LOW1,2013-04-25 10:29:00,2828,Somebody needs to get this matter fixed real soon. http://www.kenoradailyminerandnews.c...ia-day-weekendThere are some grocery stores and other agency stores which hopefully won't be affected
1714041,wallydave,2013-04-25 11:02:00,2151,"Right before walleye season opener, yikes!! If they don't get it resolved, just have to bring more and pay the duty!It will be interesting to see if the strike hurts other than LCBO run stores! I stop at Dutchies on my way North for Canadian beer, if they can still sell beer and liquor, they will have to stock up!"
1714249,Bigstorm,2013-04-25 12:03:00,799,"We always go to The Beer Store, looks like they will have an uptick in business"
1714393,Smallmouth Hunter,2013-04-25 12:39:00,84,Weren't they doing the same thing last year? Seems like a strike was a possibility then also.
1715945,Skywagon,2013-04-26 05:24:00,1106,"You gotta love the unions....if Tim Hortons goes on strike, we'll really be in bad shape."
1716041,Bill Krejca,2013-04-26 06:45:00,6107,Hmm.. Again? You have to hand it to the negotiating folks - They know when to put the hurt on. I'd expect a normal proportionate increase in beer prices to offset the additional labor costs after the crisis is settled. Bill
1716233,wallydave,2013-04-26 07:38:00,2151,"Back in the 80's one of the local beer distributors, broke the union, stating they could not be competitve with the other company that was union. So what happened, the non-union guys lost salary and benefits, for some reason the beer did not get any cheaper, in fact when the union beer went up so did the non union beer. The guys on the truck didn't get the raise! Greed gets in the way on both sides! When somebody comes up with the perfect solution ... I'll buy that guy or gal, any beer he or she wants!"
1716305,dogrodder,2013-04-26 07:57:00,400,NO! Not Tim Hortons things would never be the same.
1716385,HeHooksHimself,2013-04-26 08:18:00,725,"Perhaps Canada should agree to severe consequences for accomplishing nothing, that way they could shut down tours of the capitol and furlough air traffic controllers so they could fund a program to teach voice lessons to transgender people.....not like that could actually happen or anything."
1716409,621Dreamer,2013-04-26 08:23:00,40,Remember --- this story is about the Liquor Control Board of Ontario NOT the Beer Store. They are two different businesses. The LCBO predominantly sells hard liquor and wine and a small amount of beer (mostly imported). The Beer Store sells Canadian beer. The LCBO is owned and operated by the Ontario provincial government. The Beer Store is owned and operated by a few major Canadian breweries (major shareholders are Molsons and Labatts). So a strike at the LCBO does not affect the Beer Store and you would still be able to purchase beer at the Beer Store.
