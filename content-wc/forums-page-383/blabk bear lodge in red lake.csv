1740137,fourt2,2013-05-03 11:16:00,45,"Been going to BBL for 4 years now--always catch a lot of fish, most of them close to camp. We've portaged to NoName 3 every year--always plan to get around to the back side of the island, but never make it there: can't stop catching walleye long enough to make it around the corner!If you're looking for a no-frills lodge, I highly recommend Black Bear. Owners are great and the fishing is fantastic.Disclaimer: I haven't fished elsewhere in Canada, so can't compare to other lakes/lodges."
1740161,fourt2,2013-05-03 11:24:00,45,Should also mention that my son & I will be there last week of July/first week of Auguse--hope to see you there!
