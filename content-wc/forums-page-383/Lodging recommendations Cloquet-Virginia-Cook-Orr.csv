1735385,Guest,2013-05-02 08:53:00,0,Your best bet would probably be Cloquet. There are some fairly nice motels on your left as you are heading north. I believe maybe the second/third stop light. You can easily see them from the highway
1735393,jambi,2013-05-02 08:54:00,504,"Thanks for the input - I finally ate at Gordy's last year. The burgers were fair, the shakes were great, and the cheese curds were awesome. Brought back memories of the cheese curds at the Minnesota State Fair when I was a kid. Safe travels to all. Jambi"
1735449,Solo Dog,2013-05-02 09:10:00,7,Stay at the Black Bear Casino/Hotel/Golf just on the south side of Cloquet.
1735753,SNOPRO,2013-05-02 10:22:00,108,"We've stayed at the Vermilion Motel several times. Very clean, right on 53, boat/ trailer parking, inexpensive rates.http://www.rangenet.com/vermotel/"
1736473,Mark R,2013-05-02 14:14:00,1538,The North Counrty Inn in Orr is a nice clean place. Much less than the Americinn but has less ammenities also. Not real big so if your going in peak periods get your reservation. We used to stay there but now we press onto IF and get one less hour of driving out of the way.
1736929,Blue Lk,2013-05-02 16:37:00,269,"+1. Reasonable room rates,great food & a change to win some $$ to finance your trip."
1732809,jambi,2013-05-01 15:03:00,504,Changing up my travel a little this year from Tulsa. Instead of staying in St Paul going further north on first day. Will end on 53 in Cloquet - Virginia - Cook - Orr. Dont need or want to drive all the way to the border. Any preferred lodging (or dumps to avoid)??? Thanks
1733689,HuskerFrank,2013-05-01 19:13:00,24,"Been through there many times. Just not sure about lodging options. But if you stay in Cloquet, you have to hit Gordy's Hi Hat for one of the best burgers and shakes you'll ever have."
1733865,Fishin Fun,2013-05-01 19:53:00,218,We stay at the Pine View Inn in Virginia every year on our way up. The rooms are reasonable and clean. They are pretty busy during the summer with people on their way up north.
1733881,eyemike,2013-05-01 19:59:00,233,"We stayed at the Pine View Inn also. Clean, reasonable, friendly. They told us of a nice place to eat about 5 miles away. I would stay there again."
1734025,KTroller,2013-05-01 20:19:00,237,The Holiday Inn Express in Virginia (Mountain Iron) is new in the last few years and is nice. Plenty of parking for boats if you're pulling one. Free breakfast too.KT
1734513,Hawker,2013-05-02 04:44:00,3967,"Except for the past two years, we've been staying at the Americinn on the north end of Orr, overlooking Pelican Lake. The past two years (as we will be doing this year again) we've driven straight thru from Sapulpa to our destination of Young's Wilderness Camp on LOW. We fuel up there in Orr and it's an hour drive from there to the border in I-Falls.Lodging (can't remember rates) was nice (not fancy), comfortable clean rooms and friendly staff. It's about a 15 hr drive (roughly) counting fuel/potty stops from Sapulpa."
1734793,MN_Moose,2013-05-02 06:59:00,964,The AmericInn is now Oveson's Pelican Lake Resort & Inn. Looks like they still do night / night lodging
1734897,Mohleye,2013-05-02 07:23:00,368,"The Super 8 in Virginia (actually Evelyth) is very clean and nice, with a big parking lot. Not sure you could go too far wrong with any of the places in Virginia, they all look pretty decent. I've also stayed at the place in Orr on Pelican Lake, very nice as well."
1734961,LOW1,2013-05-02 07:37:00,2828,"There are two motels in Cloquet right next to each other, one is a super 8 and the I think is an Americinn. Both are very good.As others have said the Super 8 in Virginia and Ovesons are also very nice.Get your reservations early because all of these places can fill up in a hurry during the summer. And call around because the prices can very a lot depending on the time of year, etc."
1735185,SinOrSwim,2013-05-02 08:00:00,1528,"If you stay in Virginia, stay at the AmericInn. The Sawmill bar and grill or whatever the name is, is right next door. Basically same parking lot. REally good food.If you stay in Cloquet, the two places you need to try are either Sammys Pizza or like someone mentioned Gordy's. Gordy's has been on Diners Drive Ins and Dives. Cheese curds!!!!"
