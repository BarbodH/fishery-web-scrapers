Would you say there is a difference in bite/action with a late spring? Perhaps the bite means nothing when there is a later or early spring? Best,"
1741153,campchick,2013-05-03 16:25:00,96,"I would say that better fishing comes with an early Spring. By the time the fishing season starts the water has already warmed up somewhat and that seems to be a key factor for the walleyes. For the northerns, not so much. Northern fishing will be great when there is a late ice out. Just my experience."
1741393,bobbylfishermon,2013-05-03 17:40:00,241,"I agree with Campchick , late spring you could run into the wallys spawning,which slows down the bite and the post spawn blues. Cold water,everything is ""up"" and eating,that's where the food is."
