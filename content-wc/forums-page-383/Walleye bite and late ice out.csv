For us anyway , it seems we always do best when ice out is just a few days prior to opening Saturday of walleye season. That being said,it means there has been about three weeks of open water . Walleye and pike are definetly in the shallower water . Have had some very productive trips those years . Looks like this will be ,could be one of those trips . Your experiences ?????"
1739745,jambi,2013-05-03 09:56:00,504,Great question. This will be my first spring cold water trip. Planning to start shallow as well.
1740033,Golden Eagle,2013-05-03 10:51:00,2642,"Locate walleyes and pike will be close by as they found walleyes before you did.Check corners of big bays as pike may be lingering as they leave spawning areas. Fish any fresh green you find in the water. Find a shiner spawn. For sure, pike and walleyes found it before you showed up. Fish it hard. Fan cast the area and then move closer and closer to the spawning shiners. Good fishing to you."

That is where the bait fish are. Next movement is to underwater structure/reefs 8-14 feet, and finally deeper water. Really more of guide line. As we have all found out, it is always changing. Have a great trip."
1742313,octanehi5,2013-05-04 04:39:00,1104,Here In Ct. our water temps are 54 the walleye bite is just starting to turn on and they are shallow.
1742737,Bill Krejca,2013-05-04 08:02:00,6107,"One trip I remember in particular. On opening day, the water was very cold for the season, and fishing was slow. We got a warm south wind in the middle of the week, and the walleyes stacked up on the north side of the lake and bit like crazy. It was like an entirely different water system, it just waited for the right conditions to create the bite. Good luck. Bill"
