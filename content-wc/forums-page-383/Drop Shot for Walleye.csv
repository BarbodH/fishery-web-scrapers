1745489,bobbylfishermon,2013-05-05 08:05:00,241,"Hey shick, why not a drop shot, you can bet they don't see it too often, I 'm a mono guy 8 lb. test, #1, or #2 octopus on an 8in. long drop, 1/4 oz. should be plenty for most situations, minnows, salted minnows, crawlers, leeches and my weight is at 18ins.,below, that way it's in their face, if they're hugging bottom, or active, slay em with this rig on Eagle River, On. A little secret, some times I'll use 1/4 oz. jig for my weight. My take NO prisoners approach! Good Fishing!"
1745857,schick,2013-05-05 10:05:00,35,"Bobby Thanks for the info. I have really become ""hooked"" on drop shot for bass fishing, so I am anxious to try it for walleye. What did you mean on an 8 inch long drop and then later you said your weight is 18 inches below the hook? Are those 2 different things?"
1746657,bobbylfishermon,2013-05-05 16:02:00,241,"Shick, at the end of my line I put a 1/4oz. split shot, 18ins above that I tie a little loop knot on my line, then put a 8in snell thru the loop, I guess you could really call it a crappie rig, but, it works for me, hope that helps."
