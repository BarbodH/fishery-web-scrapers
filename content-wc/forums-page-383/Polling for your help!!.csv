1726529,Guest,2013-04-29 20:58:00,0,Hi everyone! I work at an outfitter in Northern Ontario. We have several fly in outpost cabins. Its time for us to start replacing the mattresses at the cabins. They are starting to see their day. I want to poll people here to ask what kind of mattress most folks prefer. We are looking at an 8 to 10 inch foam mattress Or a pillow top spring coil mattress. or a non pillow top if preferred. Please leave your choice below. I appreciate everyone's help. I value everyone's opinion. Have a great 2013 fishing season everyone.

1726897,Pooch,2013-04-30 00:19:00,4619,"Pillow tops tend to be uncomfortably warm when sleeping in the summer months. Especially in a cabin with little ventilation.Just get a decent firm mattress. Most camps we fish are just a 2x4 bed with plywood under a mattress and a soft mattress over plywood isn't much different than just sleeping on the plywood after a few hours.Mice are the only creatures that love the foam mattresses and they are hot in the summer.I don't know what mattresses are used at Wildewood on Savant, but they have been there for a very long time and are on the plywood beds. They are very comfortable and have held up great.Choices, choices, choices!Pooch"

1727185,tooski,2013-04-30 06:49:00,393,"Not only are the old type foam mattresses hot in the summer, they smell. When they finally lose their odor after a few years they start absorbing odors so badly you can tell the nationality of the previous occupant. Don't know what your budget is but the newer memory foam type are nice."
1727937,2746,2013-04-30 10:05:00,3206,I agree
