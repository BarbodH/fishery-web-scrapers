1727817,Mike Kansas,2013-04-30 09:32:00,1463,Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul is giving a fishing trip to four Wounded Warriors at no charge. What a great gesture for a great Lodge in Ontario. Wife and I are donating four rods and reels and lures to the cause. Just a way to say thanks to all those who protect our freedom. Mike Kansas
