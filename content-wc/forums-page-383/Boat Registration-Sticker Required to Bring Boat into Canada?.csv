When you returned you needed to check in and show it being returned to US. I had to do this several times, it was more of a hassle on the return, especially if Customs was busy, what with the traffic flow, etc. Not sure when this was removed, but it was real."
1725809,Whopper,2013-04-29 17:46:00,340,I have taken my boat to Canada many times. A few times I have been asked register it with the Canadian customs office. It's no big deal and only takes a few minutes as long as you have your registration and boat numbers. I've crossed at both the Soo but mostly at Windsor and only ever had to do the registration deal at Windsor. Don't really no what triggers the registration even after I tell them I'm not leaving my boat behind.
1731489,tv4fish,2013-05-01 08:32:00,2694,"Really - How far back? We have going into Ontario since 1985 and have never been asked to ""register"" my boat as we went in?"
1682857,Sportdog,2013-04-17 09:18:00,6735,I just got off the phone with my fishing partner who will be going to Canada with me in June. He stated that he read that I would have to register my boat with the Ontario MNR to bring it into Canada. I had never heard of this. Is this true? I posted a question earlier about the proper safety equipment and was told that I was only required to comply with my state law where the boat was registered here in the US and no one said anything about any type of registration but I didn't ask that question. Anyone? Thanks.
1682929,Golden Eagle,2013-04-17 09:26:00,2642,"I suggest providing boat information to your fishing partner and have him take care of regristration requirements for you. Seems fair since you're providing the boat, probably the towing vehicle, and maybe a lot more. Sometimes boards are the correct length and we don't need to go looking for a board stretcher."

1683689,tv4fish,2013-04-17 12:20:00,2694,Short answer - No - I believe you can have/keep your boat in Canada for up to 45 days with no problems.
1683969,Burr,2013-04-17 13:42:00,8612,"""I was only required to comply with my state law where the boat was registered here in the US""You got the ""correct"" answer right there.When your partner suggests you also need to complete a safe boat operators certificate before you can operate your boat in Ontario - same answer."
1690849,Sparty_hunter,2013-04-19 06:43:00,58,"Sportdog,Your buddy may have been confusing the registration with the ""check-in"" that must be completed if you are entering Canada by water (in your boat)."
1691105,Mondo,2013-04-19 07:31:00,61,"When you cross the border, the Canadian officials will ask you if there is anything that you will be leaving in Canada? If your answer is ""my boat"", whether leaving it permanently or not, they will ask you to step inside to complete a form. This form is to be left with your boat. Upon crossing back into the US with your boat, you will need to stop into the Customs office with this document. Simple process and it doesn't cost anything. Typically, I fish in late July/early August. Leave my boat until my return trip over labor day weekend. Since 2010, I've had to complete this form and follow the above process. Hope this helps, Mondo"
1692425,@Lunker,2013-04-19 12:44:00,835,"Frankly, I just don't tell them I'm leaving my boat. God love a bureaucracy. As a friend said, ""what they don't know won't hurt them."" (But this ONLY applies to leaving my boat up there. I DO NOT misrepresent any other information such as liquor, bait, firearms, etc, etc)"
1725497,Guest,2013-04-29 15:34:00,0,Looking for a board stretcher is almost as bad as trying to find a bucket of ohms.
