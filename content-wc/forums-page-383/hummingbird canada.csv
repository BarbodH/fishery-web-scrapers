1730209,packpro,2013-04-30 19:41:00,695,"rnnonmt.....thank you for checking. I have a base map on my 12 year old Garmin 176. You are right those base maps are ugly, but if I can lay down a track, I can Hansel and Gretel my way back to the dock. Again, thanks for checking your map cards."
1719217,packpro,2013-04-27 08:11:00,695,"Getting ready to pull the trigger on 80# Terrova with Link, Hummingbird 998c HD, and 4 bank charger. I have a one question (for now) question on the 998. It looks like it comes with a base map only for the US. I have looked at the map card options, both Navionics and Lakemaster for Canada. I will be using the unit on mostly uncharted lakes. I don't need anything sophisticated. My old Garmin 176 (12 years old) had a general base map of US and Canada. It wasn't really defined, and even the borders of the lakes were off. In spite of that, It laid down my track, and let me store way points. I will tell you that I am directionally challenged and the track was invaluable. I am just looking for advice on what I will need to do use the H-bird in Northwest Ontario. If you have specific experience with the birds in Northwest Ontario, I look forward to your suggestions/input. Thanks in advance."
1719425,rnnonmt,2013-04-27 09:20:00,992,Just my two cents but you are about to drop a lot of coin for your purchases.... why not another 100 or so for a map chip of NW Canada? Would be happy to send some screenshots of the lake you are planning to fish (if its on my Navionics Canada chip)
1719521,NMG,2013-04-27 09:57:00,1053,I agree with rnnonmt. I'd just check if there is a Navionics chip that covers the lakes or area you fish. I have a chip for mine and it has the marine charts for many of the local waterways in my area and it works very well. My Humminbird also has a much smaller screen than your 998 (I have a 500 series) and even on the small screen it's pretty easy to track. It's a great purchase in my opinion.
1720241,RapShad,2013-04-27 18:16:00,76,We used the NW Ontario navionics chip in our HBird last year and it worked beautifully
1721337,packpro,2013-04-28 08:05:00,695,"Thanks for the information. Just one more question for clarification.When you purchase the Canadian Map does it include all the lakes in the area, but provides more detail and contour information on the lakes listed?Or, does it only include the lakes listed?"
1721817,rather-be-fishin,2013-04-28 11:04:00,429,"I also have A Humminbird unit & absolutely love it! Wouldn't fish Lac Seul without it! The Navionics map just contains the lakes listed with depths & hazards marked, within reason."
1722369,rnnonmt,2013-04-28 16:40:00,992,"Its not an ""all lakes"" inclusive map of the region. Which lake in particular are you looking for?"
1729153,packpro,2013-04-30 15:04:00,695,I'll be fishing Clay lake this year. We have fished the other end of that body of water from another camp and always had good trip. Taking my own boat this year should give us access to more water.Without a map loaded will my new Terrova I link TM record a trolling path? Will spot lock work? Can the head of the TM unit just use Satelitte information without a map? What happens if I am using my SI and hit a way point on an interesting spot? Can I track back to that waypoint?
1730001,rnnonmt,2013-04-30 18:43:00,992,"I would need one of the gurus to confirm but, because the ipilot functions you mentioned are integral to the Ipilot/gps receiver in the head of the Terrova I believe you will have all of the functionality you mentioned just it will be on a really crappy base map or blank map. I will take a look to see if Clay lake is on my map AND is surveyed."
1730041,rnnonmt,2013-04-30 18:51:00,992,"Packpro, Sorry to say that my Navionics map and Trakmaps map does not have Clay lake surveyed. I can see the lake in the Navionics map but it is nothing more than a blob."
