You have restored my faith in mankind's abilty to apply reasoning and extrapolate a concept from a simple four or five sentence statement. For all I know Granny ""guest"" may in fact be a Granny in which case I take back everything I've thought about her. Unless she's one of those Granny's driving 80 and flipping me off, then I meant every one of those thoughts hahahahahahaha"

1727865,Burr,2013-04-30 09:44:00,8612,"First rule of the road, everyone driving slower than you is a grandparent that has no business on the road slowing you down. Just because what they are doing is within the law, is no reason for them to be allowed to drive.Second rule of the road - anyone driving faster than you is a complete imbicile that is going to kill everyone with their lack of safe driving skills, furthur evidenced by their breaking the law by driving over the posted speed limit.Reality - it's time for you to relax and drive defensively so you don't have your emotions cause your loved ones to become concerned because your lack of patience is making you the biggest issue on the road.Stop and realize that every day, there are people that sit down behind their steering wheel, and never make it to their destination. Don't let impatience make you one of that club.Take a deep breath."
1730593,BennieS,2013-04-30 22:03:00,108,I'm on the Inter State most every other weekend here in Wisconsin. Set my cruise at 69mph. I rarely and I mean very rarely pass anyone. I swear the speedlimit has been changed to somewhere around 80mph and they just haven't had the time or money to change the speed limit signs. Even at 69mph I'll occasionally get flipped off. .......Yawn.....
1731457,misanthrope,2013-05-01 08:27:00,43,You need help. Serious help.
1732273,Guest,2013-05-01 12:33:00,0,You're going 69 in a 70 and getting flipped off? Try the right lane and stay out ofd the passing (go fast) lanes.
1732473,chevtow,2013-05-01 13:45:00,691,In Wisconsin it would be 65mph. So he is speeding. Think before you bash.
1733481,bigwalleye1,2013-05-01 18:26:00,2632,I think Bennie's point is he's already over the limit and he's still getting passed. I don't think he implied he was driving in the left lane while doing it.
1733809,Mr. Sauger,2013-05-01 19:36:00,285,65 or 70. Granny is right. Slower traffic should stay to the right.
1734153,BennieS,2013-05-01 20:54:00,108,"Granny ""guest"". Nice name. Truly sorry about your dimentia. The speed limit here in Wisconsin is 65 NOT 70. If I had known you'd take the time to comment I would have made certain to explain that I am in the right hand lane. Not the left lane, the passing lane. There, how's that? Understandable now?"
1724465,Walleye_Wrangler,2013-04-29 10:31:00,138,"I'm starting to get excited about our trip to Canada. It is a 17 hour trip, that to me is part of the fun. I like to drive and do most of it for our group.The problem is there is no driving etiquette anymore. On a recent trip I couldn't believe the number of drivers texting, tailgating, driving with brights on, and the worst, driving in the passing lane. Do you find it is getting worse? What's your pet peeve?"
1724937,2746,2013-04-29 12:05:00,3206,"Driving SLOWLY in the passing lane! We try to avoid I35 North of the cities on Friday afternoon, for example, because of the traffic going to the lakes for the weekend but mostly because the passing lanes fills up with old F___ts in their campers and they won't move over for love nor money. How someone can drive in the passing lane with no one in front of him for a 1/2 mile and a string of cars behind him for a mile and not notice or care is beyond me. I believe that practice creates more accidents than almost anything else. Many states have signs posted saying the left lane is for passing only but it takes some enforcement to make it mean anything to some drivers. (Don't know what the law is in Minn.) There, I vented. Feel better already."
1725009,HeHooksHimself,2013-04-29 12:27:00,725,"My pet peeve is when I am driving along and I have the pedal to the metal in my camper. Heck, There are two lanes to drive in and I am entitled to one of them and I am going almost the speed limit. Then these buttheads tailgate me and flash their lights. When they finally get around me they let me know I am number one! What's their hurry? They act like the lake they are traveling to is going to drain if they are delayed a few minutes!And another thing, no drinking and driving on the road or the water. What the heck is that all about? How are you supposed to get anywhere???"

1726953,goldman,2013-04-30 03:59:00,1036,"I'm on the roads at least 5 days a week anymore, in the big truck. I find its all of what the OP said and more. To my way of thinking, your allowed to drive slow in the right lane, as long as your doing the minum speed. After all, there's another lane out there, they can go around, and it doesn't matter if they drive by showing their IQ. But my pet peeve, is when folks don't drive a consistent speed, they speed up, slow down, etc. Then when I'm wanting to go around, because I usually have the cruse set, they speed up to the point I cant get around. I am not a tailgater. I usually like to drive with an attitude of ever increasing following distance. In other words, if traffic is flowing at 65, I might try to set mine and 64.5, just so they're always going around and I'm not ever following too close. I always have to think, if that vehicle in front of me stops, can I? Minimum 6 seconds following distance, and even better, ever increasing following distance by just backing off a little bit. Day in and day out, I have proved that backing off even 1 or 2 mph doesn't affect my arrival times. A heavy vehicle doesn't average the speed limit its set at anyhow. If I drive 64 or 65, I generaly figure on an average of 60mph, which allows for stop lights, hills, etc. It works out well for me at least. Just let peole go on and be stupid somewhere else its much safer that way. I figure if I back of a little, and someone makes it home to their family, I've done my job."
1727449,tv4fish,2013-04-30 07:56:00,2694,"JMHO here - I think it is true that we have inconsiderate ""car"" drivers AND truck drivers. I've seen truck drivers ""tailgating"" each other on 2-lane highways such that it is impossible to pass them ""one at a time"" and if you're pulling a boat, it takes a while to get around 2 of them. The fact of being ""considerate"" somehow has gotten forgotten about in this ""it's all about me"" society that we currently have."
