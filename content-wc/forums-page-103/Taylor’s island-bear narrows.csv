When they are found at every depth it's because temps are not stable yet and they will go where the food is. We don't usually see the shiners spawn until mid-June. Then you can smack them shallow, especially early and late in the day. After that as the water warms they will slowly transition to deeper shoreline structure and off shore reefs and mudflats."
