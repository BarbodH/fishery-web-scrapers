6387124,Mojo-NC,2020-01-17 13:41:00,1929,"I'm with the gold guys. A gold metallic jig head with a gold sparkly 3"" grub tail or with a 3"" motor oil/red flake tail, whichever the fish like better on a given day. Chartreuse with a same color 3"" grub tail or with a 3"" white grub tail also works very well for me. I've also used pink with good success but I think both pink and orange colors attract too many toothy gators. Sometimes i'll use a double tail too, depending on their mood."
6392732,Rock Hound,2020-02-03 15:10:00,51,"My favorite combo is a Green Sour Apple (two tone) Precision jig with the orange / green core plastics (ringworm, moxie, grub, etc.). It has worked for me on every body of water I have tried it on!"

6393162,gordy28,2020-02-05 07:32:00,437,I am still learning to be a disciple of the jig Overall my favorite combo would be a 3/8 ounce yellow jig head on a 4 inch yellow mr twister To date it accounts for my biggest and 4th biggest walleye
6393222,eyemike,2020-02-05 09:36:00,233,1/8th oz. Roadrunner jig with a white paddletail. I change up tail color as fish desire.
6393228,milfish,2020-02-05 09:54:00,249,"My go to combination is either a silver or gold strobe jig. Tipped with a 4 inch Rainbow Dace minnow. Hands down the best for me, gold/overcast, silver/sunny."
6386884,Guest,2020-01-16 17:45:00,0,"If you only had 1 color combination to use, what's your pick? For me, I'd have to say a 1/8oz pink jig head with a white twister tail."
6386892,lunker99,2020-01-16 18:06:00,236,Mine favorite combo would be a firetiger lead head with a walleye attached to it
6386996,wallydave,2020-01-17 07:07:00,2151,"Check out Capt. Redbeards Walleye Weapons, jigs with a blade added, just about any 1/4 ounce pink jig is my go to jig."
6387000,BornToFish,2020-01-17 07:11:00,1224,"Greetings, My favorite color scheme for jigs is gold glitter. The jig that I use the most throughout the open-water season is a 1/16 ounce live bait jig fitted with a #2/0 Gamakatsu 604BN hook and painted in a gold glitter color scheme. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6387026,adempsey2.0,2020-01-17 08:32:00,611,"Pink jig head 1/4 oz with 3 or 4"" White Grub or half White/ half Pink Grub. Or the opposite, white jig with pink grub. I typically try to select contrasting colors.Been favoring the 3.5"" paddletail minnows more and more though.Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk"
6387032,eyecatcher1,2020-01-17 08:44:00,323,In Canada it's got to be gold.
6387040,emma17,2020-01-17 09:27:00,436,"I'm come to believe every color works, as long as there are fish under the boat. That said, if I'm feeling like the only one in the boat not catching fish, my confidence building go-to jig is the 1/4oz black/green combo. Minnow, worm or paddle tail tipped w a small chunk of meet are all good. Leaches are hit and miss for me."
6387046,KSjim,2020-01-17 09:33:00,88,"Would have to be a 1/4 oz white jig head with a 3"" orange twister tail."
