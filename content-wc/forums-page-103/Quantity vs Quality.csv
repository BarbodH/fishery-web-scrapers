6393634,eyecatcher1,2020-02-06 11:21:00,323,I saw two wolverines running on a beach on Lac Seul a few years ago. Another time I saw a young caribou swimming a few miles from there.

6392186,That Minnesota guy,2020-02-02 08:42:00,8293,"Quality vs quantity? I'll take quality each and every time. I would rather catch one 27"" Walleye a hour than 30 16"" Walleye a hour. Keep in mind i'm not eating them nor taking a bunch of fish home each trip. I'm also more than likely trolling vs jigging and almost never casting for Walleye. Pike.......not even worth thinking about. Pike, it's go big or go home. I can catch all the little Pike a person could want. For me fishing is the experience & camaraderie, I can buy all the fish I want for eating."
6392588,David Anderson,2020-02-03 10:03:00,2073,"Yes, one would be a fool if one didn't fish the same spots as before, especially not knowing yet unlike many of my friends who I fish with, they fish memories. My best day last June with the camp boat was near Bear Narrows where we investigated the scene of where the rock jumped out of 16 feet of water to take out my lower unit 4 weeks earlier. Having expensive equipment never guarantees anything! However we did fish a new spot we had never fished before. A look at how the taper on the shoreline meets the water, the rocks along the shore, we drifted a stretch of that shore with a perfect wind keeping us parallel to the shoreline, 8 - 10 feet of water, we hammered them. The experience is not your foreknowledge of your fishing spots rather what about those spots or potentially new spots makes them good. Is there current, what is the depth change look like, what is the bottom composition, which way is the wind blowing? My host at Lac Seul loves to fish a certain area, so one day is dedicated to his spots. I cannot imagine how many fish we drive by before we get to his favorite reef. The next day is my favorite spots because they have been proven to produce The third day is always open so it's a great time to go exploring and put a few new areas under your hat. I know as one year a particular point gave up 60 walleyes and a 31 incher, this year maybe 10. What's changed, water temperature, water level, time of day, presentation. My electronics really only get's me back to that spot, gives me some basic information, and if there's fish I might start marking them as they swim by."
6392662,retire55,2020-02-03 11:56:00,1029,Lucky you. I've never had the pleasure of fishing a lake where I could average one 27 inch walleye an hour. I'd be tickled pink if I could catch one 27 inch or bigger walleye each day of my trip - and that's never happened.
6392672,stjoeguy,2020-02-03 12:09:00,979,"You're right. A 27"" walleye per hour is a pretty high standard for the definition of quality fishing. I'll take the steady quantity fishing of 17-20"" fish with a 27"" walleye hopefully at least once during the week!"
6392792,yoopertrout,2020-02-03 19:42:00,1172,"I'd go for somewhere in between. I once fished a river in Wisconsin and we caught 50 walleye in an afternoon, all under 15"". It was fun for the afternoon, but we didn't go back the next day. By the same token, I wouldn't want to fish all day for one big fish. The most fun I ever had was a trip to Canada where we caught dozens of walleye every day, 18""-22"", with several 23"" -27"" mixed in each day."
6393284,Rock Hound,2020-02-05 12:56:00,51,"When I go to Canada, I want to catch fish. I fish quite a bit in Minnesota and on the Mississippi River, so I have good fishing year around, but I don't get to fish as often as I like (even though my wife thinks that is all that I do). I literally would fish every day I could (maybe take some days off for turkey, duck, and deer hunting too)! I have been fortunate to usually be successful, and have been on many northern Minnesota and Canadian fishing trips, so I also have been fortunate to catch some true trophies as well. We even catch more pigs locally than ever too. I still like to catch a lot of fish (locally or on a trip) - that never gets old for me, but I do like to also go for large ""picture"" fish too! Our Canada trip is usually a large group 9 - 15 depending on the year, so we usually have some inexperienced fishermen along. I think the trip is unique for everyone on our trip, it is usually a shock to the inexperienced guys how many fish we can catch in a week (even if by our standards we don't consider it one of our better trips for numbers), and everyone likes to catch BIG fish! Most of the inexperienced guys, and a couple of the experienced guys catch a personal best every year! I hope I never get sick of catching fish, and I hope I always have a chance at a personal best, and I hope that NEVER changes. I know that this is a little bit different take on this thread, but more important to me than the numbers or size of fish on a trip, is the PEOPLE on the trip. I was lucky to go on many, many fishing outings with my Dad. He passed away three years ago - I will never get to fish with him again (unless I am lucky enough to make it to Heaven), but I still get to go with my brothers, sons, nephews, and friends (and I still fish with my wife occasionally too . . . she likes evenings, not mornings). My sons are adults now, and consider EVERY TIME with them now a trophy day. I hope they never get tired of fishing with me, and if I am lucky enough to ""hook"" them, then any fish caught would just be a bonus! May your next trip be your best, and may it not be your last!"
6393364,emma17,2020-02-05 16:42:00,436,"Well said Rock Hound. I guess I'm lucky because at my low skill level, as far as I can tell the tap tap of a 15 Walleye feels the same as a tap tap of a 25+ Walleye- and it's in that brief moment that the excitement of the fishing experience is at its peak. For the record, we have left our share of hot fishing spots in search of the trophy."
6393442,Bigtaproot,2020-02-05 19:44:00,900,I like my fishing like my loving quantity over quality any day or night
6393460,pikeandtina,2020-02-05 20:48:00,145,"Again, it is a very personal choice. I have been going to Canada since 1985. Fell in love with pike fishing at that time. I have done drive-to, boat-ins, and fly-ins with varying degrees of success. Disclaimer: Bass are my favorite (especially smallies) walleye are my least favorite. I took a group to a local fishing show about 10-12 years ago, and the guys chose the place based on the price $470 (early season, I believe). My response, ""Okay, probably won't be very good at that price!"" Obviously, we caught tons of fish, much to my ego's chagrin. Saw some beautiful bush country and wildlife (How many of you have seen a wolverine in the wilderness...in Ontario?). You have to hike back into these lakes, but they are amazing (for quantity)! We are going back, this year for quantity/quality. PM me if you have questions!"
6391570,emma17,2020-01-31 11:10:00,436,"Very true. Two years ago we were at the hotel in Virginia, MN when I remembered I forgot all the electronics at home. Every thought raced through my head as I felt completely naked and sure the trip was ruined. I won't say we did great, but we did just fine fishing spots we thought should hold fish. It was a good experience but not one I want to repeat."
6391580,prov1800,2020-01-31 11:40:00,5010,Very true.we fish smaller làkes and i leave my stuff at home.we do nust fine but know where to fish and those places produce.kinda nice not having to look at a unit all day.there like cell phones.cant leave them alone.nice to get off the grid once in awhile.
6391594,MrSimon,2020-01-31 11:57:00,922,"Another hot button topic. I love it! I definitely agree that good fish finders and trolling motors are absolute game changers. They have revolutionized boat control and structure identification. BUT, I don't agree that they take away the challenge. And I definitely don't agree at all that it was more of a challenge in the old days. Now a good angler has to understand how to setup, maintain, calibrate, and read the new graphs. They have to buy, maintain, and charge really expensive batteries. They have to understand how GPS works on the their trolling motor, and how to set-up freaking computer networks on their boats. Motors are computer controlled so if they crap out it's nearly impossible to fix them on the water. Lakes are more pressured, regulations are hard to understand, fish populations in most places are down from say 50 years ago. And last but definitely not least, the internet has destroyed a bunch of honey holes and makes it really hard to keep good spots to yourself. You could make a pretty strong argument that there are MORE challenges in today's fishing world ... they are just different types of challenges. And lastly, I'm a big believer that all the electronics in the world won't help if you don't understand fishing. That challenge will never go away."
6391848,eyecatcher1,2020-02-01 07:57:00,323,"I see boats all of the time both here in Minnesota and in Canada with $10,000 worth of electronics on them and they just go to where the group of boats is and fish with them. I prefer to use the electronics and find my own fish."
6391880,3M TA3,2020-02-01 08:48:00,2846,"Interesting observation. Perhaps they were there first. Curious why you would be there checking out $10,000 electronics. I do feel the same way though."
6391942,eyecatcher1,2020-02-01 11:37:00,323,I'm saying that I see them at the boat ramp and see where they go when they pull out of the harbor. They will drive their boat towards the group and fish with them.
6392084,David Anderson,2020-02-01 21:36:00,2073,"Well maybe that's were they are catching fish. I am one of those guys with $10,000 worth of electronics and what it does for me is help to understand why I am catching fish where I am. Depth, bottom structure, my relationship to structure/shore. Admittedly I often mark fish in 20 feet of water then change strategies however in the end it's about location and presentation as for all you know those marks could be carp or whitefish. Last June we were on Lac Seul and had to use a camp boat, no depth finder, just a boat, motor, and anchor. We still caught as many fish as we wanted, not because we had $10,000 worth of electronics but the past experiences taught us where to fish, how to fish and what to use. It was pleasurable indeed to catch 80 walleye a day in the boat, not knowing much of anything other than experience."
6392108,tv4fish,2020-02-02 05:05:00,2694,"David: That last word is the key. More than likely - It took the ""other equipment"" (that expensive stuff) that you had used previously to actually find the spots that hold fish at a certain time of the year. That ""experience"" is usually a very good reason to fish the same spot(s) -- sure - weather conditions, etc. may effect things also, but the fact that you had caught fish in that spot before (your experience) is always a good reason to try the same spots again. It has worked for us for years."
6392142,eyecatcher1,2020-02-02 06:58:00,323,"I've been fishing Lac Seul for 28 years now David, usually two or three trips a year. When I started I hired guides because GPS wasn't what it is today and there weren't any decent maps of the lakes up there either. Combine that with the reputation of Canadian lakes eating lower units and it was money well spent. Today I'm like you and have $10,000 worth of electronics on my boat and am pretty good at using them which is why I would rather find my own fish and not just head for the group of boats no matter what they are catching."
6392146,eyecatcher1,2020-02-02 07:05:00,323,"I agree with you on that tv4fish. I've found a lot of good spots in 28 years up there, but I think that we all have a few favorites that we like to hit. Last June the fish weren't where we usually find them that time of the year, so we backtracked and found them where we usually do a little earlier in the year. They said it was due to their spring weather up there. Experience on the water is always the best teacher."
6391040,hoppy63,2020-01-30 08:25:00,367,"QUOTE=Mojo-NC;6386414]I don't really get the numbers thing. I get a little bored catching fish when it takes no skill whatsoever to catch them. We usually end up trying a bunch of different techniques to see if we can get them to work when there is a good bite on. Dropping a minnow and jig and catching a hundred fish or more day after day is fun for a little while, but gets old as the week wears on. It's a good problem to have though...[/QUOTE] Seems like the thread for fly in lakes got kind of off message so I started new thread. Myself, I dont understand why a person who only gets to make one trip or even 2-3 trips a year for that matter, wouldn't want a lake with ""go to"" spots where you know you can catch dinner. I agree and do get bored sitting in one spot in 6-8fow catching 14""-16"" fish one after another and do go off and look for interesting areas to try different baits/methods but I'll take the lake where there are good numbers. I can always find areas where fishing is tough on those lakes, but cant count on catching even decent numbers on what you might call ""tough"" lakes, depending on weather, experience, etc..... Only way I would consider that is if I were strictly trophy fishing and that most likely would be for pike as I cant get much better ""trophy"" fishing for walleye than my own back yard (lake erie)...."
6391104,MrSimon,2020-01-30 10:56:00,922,"Obviously this is all personal preference. There is no right or wrong answer. For me, I like to have options. Doing the exact same thing all week long does get boring. Exploring, trying new things, and fishing for multiple species is what I like."
6391114,kona77,2020-01-30 11:17:00,236,"Agreed with Mr. Simon that this is a personal thing.. Some guys in our group are all about the exploration process (especially on a new lake) and they will forego known out spots to just see/fish new parts of the lake.. Personally I can sit on a really great area for hours/hours if we are really catching great numbers with good quality mixed in (18""-22"").. I just never tire of feeling that ""tap-tap-tap"" from a jigging walleye bite.We have fished a couple of lakes where the majority of fish are in the 12""-16"" range with very few over 18"" and we usually move on from those lakes. We also do like to do some gator fishing on our trips (or lake trout if present) and look for lakes where there is a reasonable opportunity to catch some larger fish (34""-40"" etc)"

6391156,stumcfar,2020-01-30 12:54:00,451,"I can hardly remember a trip where all we caught on a hot spot were 14""-16"" fish. If the fish are nailing it, there is usually a nice variety. I go to Canada to catch fish and I will sit on a spot all day if it is producing. No part of catching fish bores me or I wouldn't go on fishing trips. It is especially fun when our two or 3 boats get on a spot and all are catching. If some people want to spend a good sum of money to run around a lake to try find an even better spot and usually end up boating far less fish, more power to them. Luckily there are no rules about those types of things so all are free to enjoy. Sorry though, if you are in my boat and on top of fish, you are stuck there awhile!"
6391168,bthomas3333,2020-01-30 13:03:00,465,"For more than 25 trips I fished a numbers lake. To be honest knowing where to fish and how to fish to hammer 100+ 16-23 inch walleyes a day just stopped doing it for me. I was bored. I still like to fish walleyes from time to time and on a lot of more remote lakes I can go out and get a few in the evening, but now it is a side benefit. I prefer to chase big pike and trout more and more. At some point maybe I will switch back to easy walleyes.To each his own!B-"
6391174,Mojo-NC,2020-01-30 13:36:00,1929,"Since I kind of accidentally started this thread with a previous comment, I guess I should at least elaborate a bit. I like catching a bunch of fish as much as anyone, but sitting in one place catching one fish after another for endless hours gets monotonous. It's fun to do for a while, but the overall experience is why I'm up there. Last year my son and I went to an outpost lake and caught 80 16-22"" walleyes in 4 hours. You might say, you're exaggerating. Nope, I counted them using a golf clicker. We literally got a bite every drop as soon as our jigs hit the bottom. Had I been staying the entire week on that lake, rather than sit on that spot, we would have gone somewhere else trying to find other similar spots and would have tried a bunch of different techniques once we found fish. Instead, that day we fished until we ran out of minnows and then left the lake in time to get back to our other camp before it got too late. One of my buddies and I share the same philosophy - every year we go to Canada we try to catch fish using baits we've never caught fish on previously and/or using a different technique. We've tried all kinds of spinner rigs and styles, Alabama rigs, slow-death rigs, jigs of all different types and colors, with and without grubs, drop-shot rigs, Ned-rigs, non-conventional crankbait types, trolling, casting, etc. It's really fun when you catch one doing something different from everyone else, or find a new spot that everyone doesn't already know about. You can always go back to the tried-and-true method if you're having a bad day. Good spots are also often times very popular places and will be where a bunch of other boats congregate as well. I prefer the solitude of finding a new spot of my own and having it all to myself (at least for a while until I share it with our group). I do want everyone if our group to catch fish and have fun too, especially if they've been struggling. There you have it, the rest of my story. Tight lines!"
6391202,prov1800,2020-01-30 14:21:00,5010,Nowadays there really isnt much of a challenge anywhere with all the electronics and seminars and the boats people use.was much more challenging in the old days.maybe just leave all that stuff at home then it will be a challenge.
6391232,hoppy63,2020-01-30 15:11:00,367,I'll take mine.....I'll leave it at cabin if I get too bored😁. I dont even mind hiding in the bow of boat to bait the hook!!!
