We are seeking an RV park with a long enough ramp to launch the boat. RV is 35 plus a 17 ft boat. Would like to be able to put it in once for the week and be close enough to keep and eye on it or placed at a dock? Yes---we want it all. Yes, I know this is an excellent place for the fall and as I enter my last year of working--I will be back. For now--we are looking for something closer than driving above North Bay. Thanks, David"
