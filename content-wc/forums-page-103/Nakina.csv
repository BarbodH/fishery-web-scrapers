I am wondering if there are (I'm reasonably sure there are it's just a matter of who knows and will give out the info) any places reasonably close that one could shore fish for pike or walleye the evening before we fly out, any rivers, narrows, bridges, whatever......would like to take a separate rod and jigs/baits if that is the case so I would not have to unpack anything. Thanks for any input."

6394030,vteye3,2020-02-07 15:52:00,496,I see boats fishing within casting range on Rte 111 East of Geraldton.

The current there is pretty decent and fish seem to congregate there. Nice set of rapids in the squaw river bridge on the stairs rd. You have to walk down to the end of the rapids on the squaw lake side tho. Just before that bridge is a trail into John bill lake, I've heard it's good but from shore I'm not sure"
