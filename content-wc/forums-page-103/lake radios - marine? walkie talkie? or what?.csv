We taked from Deception light to Manitou light without problems. We ran the little FRS radios before, and you could get ""beyond yelling range"" with them but not much more."
6342052,nightowl,2019-07-18 12:35:00,3,"I purchased these a couple years ago (Midland - GXT1000VP4 radios). We have gotten around 8 miles over water so far. You can send out a call tone that goes to all radios. I tell everybody to stand up when they use them, the higher the antenna the better. Plus in Canada you do not need a license for them. As for maps, I have a handheld garmin gps with topo canada on it. We also all download offline maps from google maps. Just select the area you will be in and that works great. At least you will know where you are at."
6343902,Rondogpike,2019-07-25 05:26:00,24,The Navionics app has North Caribou.
6344236,Guest,2019-07-26 05:28:00,0,"The Navionic's app works good but it's a real battery drainer, don't leave it run continues unless you have a good 12 volt charger on board."
6391910,chunger21,2020-02-01 09:52:00,11,I haven't tried the other apps mentioned but Canada Topo Maps is free and really easy to use. It lets you place markers on the lake and you can download offline maps of any lake in Canada. We used it at North Caribou last year and it made it a lot quicker for us to find spots on the lake and never had to worry about getting lost.
6340354,phishfearme,2019-07-13 07:16:00,1242,"looking around, the 25 watt marine radios are quite expensive - do you mean 5 watt? the BaoFeng-UV-82 mentioned would be about $60 a pair which is reasonable although after reading reviews on these i'm not sure they're much better than walkie talkies. phish"
6340356,phishfearme,2019-07-13 07:17:00,1242,isn't a license required for these?
6340362,phishfearme,2019-07-13 07:35:00,1242,"I loaded boating hd and looked for an available map for the lake of interest (north caribou) but no luck - quite a few surrounding lakes though. would there be a ""generic quadrangle"" that could be used instead or am I stuck? thanks for the post, phish"
6340704,Bob/MN,2019-07-14 12:44:00,178,Our group uses Uniden UM380 radios with 8 ft antennas. They have a good water proof rateing as mine was in a down poor for two days and worked well. We talked 12 -15 miles from boat to boat. My unit cost $110 complete; shop around.
6341214,richg99,2019-07-16 04:31:00,35,Don't forget some way to keep all of those devices charged onboard.

6341290,bernmaster44,2019-07-16 07:48:00,256,"Our group hs been going to Canada for more years than I care to remember. Over the years, we have all gotten Garmin handheld satellite radios. The most recent, a garmen Rhino does much more than a radio. There is a map which shows everyone in the group, their locations on the map. I see my waypoints and can easily name them, such as home or base, I can create trails and speak to anyone in our group even if their radios are much older. It works for me. There are some cheaper models but I paid $600 for mine and I'm extremely satisfied."
6341420,Guest,2019-07-16 13:53:00,0,"Yes, the GPS without cell works fine. On my boat I have a Lowrance and an iPad on a ram mount. I run the Navionics mapping with Sonar Charts and do real time recording and uploading. Works slick. You can also get into a VHF marine radio with 25 watts and antenna for less than $1k. I picked one up for my ice house two weeks ago. Radio for just over $100 and wiring, antenna and mount for around $250. They have weather radio on them too which is a plus."
6341988,phishfearme,2019-07-18 09:45:00,1242,"a million thanks for all the experience and suggestions. we are looking into some marine radio options - they are a bit expensive and require keeping them charged but it addresses our issues. thanks again, phish"
6339922,3M TA3,2019-07-12 08:31:00,2846,And if you all have smart phones you might look into one or two of these..https://www.sportfishingmag.com/10-t...ating-anglers/
6339942,phishfearme,2019-07-12 09:20:00,1242,that Navionics app - for preventing getting lost - in conjunction with the walkie talkies - with lake proximity established - seems to be the best answer. I was unaware that a gps only based nav app would work way up north without cell service. many thanks for the responses - I'll get the nav app and go from there - sounds like a good winter time project. phish
6339956,prov1800,2019-07-12 09:42:00,5010,I Am sure you are bringing gps/sonar units so getting lost not a issue.but you should never relie on electronics best is to use your own memory banks in case your electronics goes down..if you really need to be in communication with your other boats just get it over with and rent some sat phones.there cheap for a week.all good outfitters should have them available.
6340042,phishfearme,2019-07-12 12:38:00,1242,"a good suggestion - I know they have come down in price significantly - something I need to look into - thanks. for our most recent trip, the outfitter provided a ""satellite based - text only"" handheld device. worked quite well and was even able to send texts to any phone number or email address. he said that the satellite phones were much more expensive that these text only devices - I'll look into these also. phish"
6340104,tandm,2019-07-12 15:51:00,679,"I agree with the gps and tracking to stay aware of your location. But, a good marine radio with a high quality antenna covers the situation where engine issues, or an unforeseen rock, prevent getting back to where you started. How many of us spend thousands on locators and other electronics, but balk at a few hundred for communications gear. I made a lifelong friend a number of years ago when his outboard failed and I picked up his distress call. I located him and towed him to safety . Typical Canadian weather, temperature was in the 70's and sunny when I found him, dropped to the 40's and rained that night. I will not go without a marine radio, not just for my safety, but in case someone else needs assistance."
6340144,HodakaD,2019-07-12 17:27:00,106,"We use these Baofeng UV-82 radios. They are not waterproof, but they are cheap and work well. They must be programmed, but that is simple with a free program you get online called ""chirp"". I have mine programmed with Weather Service, Marine Band, FRS, and GMRS frequencies. They will blow the doors of anything you will find at Walmart."
6340146,HodakaD,2019-07-12 17:27:00,106,Forgot the link. https://www.amazon.com/BaoFeng-UV-82-Two-Way-136-174MHz-400-520MHz/dp/B00E4KLY34/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?keywords=baofeng+uv-82&qid=1562973483&s=gateway&sprefix=baofeng+uv&sr= 8-3
6340190,DW,2019-07-12 19:02:00,2437,"A 25 watt marine radio for boat to boat coverage at 10 miles with intervening islands and land will be marginal. They are cheap, so why not? Handhelds will do almost as well in that condition limited by lower antenna height typically compared to a permanent radio. Either will cost $150, plus the antenna for the 25 watt radio. Lots of good handhelds @ $150 with no installation required."
6340274,David Anderson,2019-07-12 21:42:00,2073,Was at Lac Seul this June and had to use a camp boat as mine wasn't fixed yet. We were in Wapesi Bay and noticed a guy driving all over the place. He finally came up to us and I took out my cell phone (No service) Pulled up the Navionics app now called Boating HD and our position and the Lac Seul map came up. I could show him where we were and how to get back to the main lake area back to Chamberlain Narrows. It was surprisingly nice.
6340288,Sportdog,2019-07-12 22:39:00,6735,"Any GPS device will work but if you are in trouble, physical or boat issues, it does you no good without the ability to communicate for help. I vote for devices that address both concerns. Just my two cents."
6339760,phishfearme,2019-07-11 17:58:00,1242,"Our group is heading to a huge lake next summer that is new to us - the possibility of getting lost is real and the cabin is hidden in a bay on an island facing away from everything so there's no ""in sight of cabin"". we've carried walkie talkies for years and they've served their purpose but their range is quite limited especially with intervening islands which is the norm on this portion of the lake. so what would you all suggest as a communications device that can cover maybe 8-10 miles with intervening land? I've looked at handheld marine radios and a post on this board talks about ""25 watt marines with special antenna"" but I think that would be overkill - distance wise and cost wise. we're also considering getting GPS's and mark a ton of waypoints to lead anyone back to camp. thoughts/recommendations are welcome please. phish"
6339766,northernbite,2019-07-11 18:13:00,1186,"have a good map of lake. All of our guys have marine radios in boats, plus we have gps in boat. Go explore and have fun. You'll be fine.Paul"
6339778,phishfearme,2019-07-11 18:59:00,1242,what kind of marine radios?
6339802,h8go4s,2019-07-11 20:46:00,1673,"Download the Navionics app to your phones. It's cheap and as long as you have the area you'll be in downloaded, you don't need phone reception. It runs off the GPS satellites."
6339870,Rondogpike,2019-07-12 07:01:00,24,"I agree with h8go4s. I have the Navionics US & Canada app. We fly in and I set my phone to airplane mode. Works incredibly well. Depending on what lake you are fishing it may show all depths and structure also. First thing to do when you get to your cabin is set it as a marker in the app. You can set routes, mark additional spots you want to return to, it shows you speed, distance, ETA, etc. As I type this response from my office the app shows I am 591.7 miles from the cabin."
6339872,Aspencreek,2019-07-12 07:05:00,2911,Wait.....the app will work without cell phone reception? With this app I now can get GPS on my phone even when I don't have any cell service???? And why don't I know about this already??
6339876,Rondogpike,2019-07-12 07:10:00,24,"Aspencreek, yes, works great. Again, set your phone to airplane mode."
6339906,Mojo-NC,2019-07-12 08:11:00,1929,"Yup, use your phones and if you have a GPS on your fishfinder, make sure to turn on the trails function. You will be able to backtrack your exact route. It won't help you find your friends though if someone gets in trouble. That's where your walkie talkies will be useful or a discussion about where you're going each day in advance so the other boats will know the general area where to look for you in the event of a problem. Good luck and be safe!"
6339910,3M TA3,2019-07-12 08:17:00,2846,Well you're right about the cost of the higher performing radios. I don't believe there is anything out there that will perform as you wish that will cost less than at least a grand. Your GPS idea would be the most affordable to satisfy your need. A fairly good unit can be had for less than $100 bucks each. An added benefit is you can mark and share weigh points of your 'hot spots' with the rest of your party as they can do for you. Bring your old radios in case you find yourselves closer together. Here is a good example https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/produ...a45a40bb237ab0
6339914,CI_Guy,2019-07-12 08:22:00,2118,"A marine radio signal only travels about 8 miles to another boat with a good antenna. The signal range is ""line of sight"" so the height of the antenna is as important as the wattage."
