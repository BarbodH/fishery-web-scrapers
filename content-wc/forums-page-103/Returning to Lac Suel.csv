In the past, we stayed at Onaway Lodge but that place was booked so we picked Fisherman's Cove just south of Ear Falls. A few questions. First, are there any decent maps available for purchase for that section of the Lake? Second, any recommendations as to where we should fish for bass and walleye? Third, in future years we would like to venture to other parts of the Lake. Any recommendations as to where and lodges? Thanks."
6393262,CamoHunter,2020-02-05 12:01:00,363,"There are not any great depth maps for Lac Seul. The only thing the Navionics or Lakemaster map chips are useful for, is knowing where you are at on the lake in proximity to the lodge and overall lake. Do NOT trust any depths on those maps, as they have not surveyed the lake for accurate depths, and they are no better than just guesses to actual depth.However, if you're fishing from Fisherman's Cove, you're in luck. It appears that there's been 50+ tracks shared by other fisherman onto the Humminbird LiveShare site, providing some pretty good depth mapping for that particular area of Lac Seul. Best of all, the LiveShare map is available to download for free onto an SD card, and placed in a Humminbird depthfinder. Visit the website to view the map here: https://chartselect.humminbird.com/liveshareKeep in mind, the data uploaded has not been verified or checked for quality. You will notice some obviously bad data is displayed in that map. Areas with 200+ depth, five feet away from accurate 20ft depth data. And depth tracks going across dry ground. Most of the bad data areas stand out and are pretty obvious to recognize, but just something to keep in mind. It gives you a great starting point.Bass and walleye shouldn't be hard to find. Dropoffs, rocky humps, sand, wind-blown points..."

6393464,David Anderson,2020-02-05 21:10:00,2073,"Fisherman's cove is a great place but admittedly I have only fished in August and most of what we looked for were 20 foot humps in deeper water. I am sure there are plenty of good spots near the Cedar Islands or Ghost Narrows area or almost any point that tapers to 20 feet of water. I believe the best map is the Navionics, https://www.navionics.com/ you can click on the Chart Viewer on this page and look at the area you want to fish. As camohunter said, there is no real good depth maps however the Navionics map is land/water accurate. As well they have small red squares with a black X on the map where there are known hazards. Not all hazards are marked and not all squares are hazards however my experience is give those marks a wide berth. The Navionics map has pretty good houseboat trails that help navigate the main lake parts. I am not familiar with the newer Lakemaster/Humminbird maps as I run Lowrance products. I usually fish the Northwest area of the lake at Lac Seul Outposts in May, June, and September. Fishing is great during those times."
