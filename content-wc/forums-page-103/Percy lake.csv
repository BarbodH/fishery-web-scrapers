6394110,Eckohlt,2020-02-08 05:42:00,3685,"Fished Percy mid sept 2019 and just pounded the big fish there,hundreds over 20inches and some of the hardest fighting fish I've dealt with,went through Nakina north outfitters really nice camp.the moose hunters replaced us we helped them unload there stuff then as were standing there they spotted a moose across the lake one guy put his scope on it and said it was a shooter there were 3 hunters so 2 of them jumped in a boat in there t shirts and went after it,they got the moose and they had one bull tag bam there done within half hour,they didn't even get there gear unpacked so I'm sure they did some fishing for the week,and probably plenty of time to finish the booze they brought in,rod"

6394126,Eckohlt,2020-02-08 07:26:00,3685,"That's what I thought John,I did ask one of them I don't remember if it was the hunter or pilot and who ever replied me said it was go to shoot,I left it at that none my business"
6394128,hoppy63,2020-02-08 07:39:00,367,"Sounds great. I have looked at Percy myself. Can you give some more info as far as accommodations go....camp, boats, motors, etc???"
6394172,lionfan19,2020-02-08 11:34:00,41,"Good story for sure. Sounds like you mainly fished walleye, where did you find the fish to be that late in the season? Did you target or catch any big pike?"
6394180,Eckohlt,2020-02-08 12:48:00,3685,"Caught some big pike walleye fishing n saw some big pike,walleyes were not deep under 20ft not any mainland points coming out into the lake so it was mainly shoreline fishing,it's just a long lake with only one small island,there were some mid lake shallower flats surrounded by deeper water but not much on them,and one small river coming into the lake was full of fish"
6394182,Eckohlt,2020-02-08 12:50:00,3685,Sent you a pm
6394302,kzoofisher,2020-02-09 07:03:00,5144,"Went to that outpost in early August 2018. The good: caught lots of fish (esp. in rivers), biggest 27"", they hit hard and eagerly, boats and motors reliable, anchors good enough, cabin tight, sauna/shower house, appliances worked well, cheap. The bad: beds were not real comfortable but we picked through mattresses and found 5 good ones, main lake was pretty structureless and fish very scattered, well pulls right off lake bottom and water needs pre-filtering before filtering for drinking, inlet rivers on opposite end where Leuebergers is may be better fishing. Enjoyed ourselves all in all, would definitely consider going back with a group of no more than 4."

6394366,kzoofisher,2020-02-09 09:54:00,5144,I can imagine those rocks would be bad if frosty. We had bad winds one afternoon and overnight and beached the boats right below the cabin. I'd go down that way and across to the dock if it was icy.
