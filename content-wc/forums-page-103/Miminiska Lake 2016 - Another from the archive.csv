My father in law invited me to go on a work trip for 4 nights to Miminiska Lake with Wilderness North out of Thunder Bay Mim is just a widening of the famed Albany river - and it was my first experience on a true fish factory Overall it was an amazing trip and being so far North was a dream come true for me My father in law and I were able to see a Timber Wolf run up and down a shoreline watching us (like dinner in my mind lol) Full write up is herehttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/one-lucky-son-in-law Cheers Andrew
