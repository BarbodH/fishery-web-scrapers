Its been really mild here, averaging around -6â„ƒ for the last couple of weeks. Only been getting out the last few days as I got my rear end kicked by a killer bout off flu or what ever, more like the plague if you ask me. Anyways, loving the mild temps at the moment, and the fish are plentiful too, pike, walleye and whitefish. Might try for trout somewhere next week, but I've got 12 days straight at work coming up, so unlikely....lol.VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/x3go0bLXVAc"
