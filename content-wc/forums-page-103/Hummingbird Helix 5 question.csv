6393580,MrSimon,2020-02-06 08:52:00,922,"I took one last year. Loved it!!!!! The live mapping was beyond useful for finding and staying on the spot-on-the-spot. I ran it using a 12V 10ah battery from Dakota Lithium. It's very light weight, only a few pounds. The battery will last two full days of use before needing re-charge. If you keep the brightness down and turn the unit off when you can, it could go three or four days, maybe more. We had a generator so I didn't mind running it on full power all day long."

WAY lighter and charge faster. Pay attention to any potential flight restrictions though, especially if you fly commercially.Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk"
6393614,CamoHunter,2020-02-06 10:30:00,363,"Figure a 6-7 day fishing trip, you'll need a way to recharge batteries, or bring enough charged batteries to get you through the week, or bring one large enough to last all week. With Helix 5's being extremely popular for ice fishermen, most guys can get at least a full day on a 12v 12ah lithium battery from Dakota Lithium or Amped Outdoors. Some can get a day and a half or so if they're conservative with screen brightness.Obviously it all depends on how long the unit is powered on each day, and screen brightness setting. And keep in mind summer days are longer than winter. Do you plan on fishing all day? Breaks at lunch and supper help. The nice thing with fishing a boat vs an ice fishing unit, is you're not as limited to a compact 12ah battery, and could get a bigger lithium battery like a 50-60ah that might very well last you all week without recharging. How big of battery, or number of batteries, will depend on whether you want to mess with a generator or not during the week.I would error on the side of extra juice, but I use my depthfinder and mapping constantly, all day."
6393864,Bstar,2020-02-07 05:25:00,564,I used a Nocqua 10 ah lithium battery last year on a fly-in with my Helix 5 and was impressed how long the lithium lasted compared to the sealed lead acid battery that I used to use. Just remember to disable any screens your not using and turn off tracking if you have a gps unit. Also going to gray scale on your screens will conserve power.
6393942,Jack68133,2020-02-07 09:34:00,14,You have all been a huge help and once again proved what a great tool this site is for fishermen. I will have the ability to recharge every night so it sounds like a 10ah lithium battery is the way to go. Thanks again.
6394018,MrSimon,2020-02-07 14:24:00,922,"Most of those lithium batteries require a special charger. It SHOULD come with your battery, but just double check when you buy, you might have to order it separately. Also, I highly recommend building yourself a little battery box out of a small plastic ammo can. It protects the battery, and you can put in a USB port to also charge phones and stuff. There will be enough room in the box for the battery, the charger, some charging wires, and even a few small tools."
6394036,Jack68133,2020-02-07 17:07:00,14,I am actually planning building a box that contains the fish finder and battery together.
