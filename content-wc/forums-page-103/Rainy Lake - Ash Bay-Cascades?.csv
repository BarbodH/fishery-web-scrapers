The waters in those areas are quite deeper compared to the areas we fish. Are the walleyes found much deeper as well? Any information would be greatly appreciated."
6394452,boisie,2020-02-09 15:28:00,36,Been going to NW Bay for 10-12 years. Up until the last 2-3 years we could always get our fish there but would still take a day or two and make the run to Ash and Paddy. Its about 24 mile run one way so takes some time and fuel. Have caught some real nice fish there. The last 2-3 years we have really struggled to catch walleyes in NW Bay and make the run to Ash almost every day. Spring seems to still be good in NWB but we go later and it has been tough compared to earlier years. Usually 18-25 feet when fishing up there.

A few here, a few there and a couple over there seems to be the norm in recent years.... in the same spots where you could pull 15-20 fish before moving. I'm hoping it's just a cyclical thing. The pike on the other hand have virtually disappeared in that area for at least the past 10yrs or better. We'll be there again in July this year. The past couple of years I've fished from Woodchuck on down to the Rebecca, Cheery and Hostess areas. Those areas have been pretty darn good, especially for eater sized fish. This year I want to venture north like to Ash Bay and areas in between. I still like the old haunts in NW Bay and we still find fish, but for numbers, I've been venturing further out."
