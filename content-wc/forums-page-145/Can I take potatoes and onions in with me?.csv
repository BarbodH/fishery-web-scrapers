6228950,Obabikon,2018-08-02 14:59:00,2370,yes you may.
6229090,btyreprich,2018-08-02 22:14:00,1067,Yes - just make sure these items are commercially packed and not from your own garden. That is what I have read on this subject on Canadian border crossing sites. Guess the concern is bringing soil and pests into the country.
6229644,Fishoil,2018-08-04 12:18:00,1277,It should be no problem. I haven't even been asked about them for several years now.
