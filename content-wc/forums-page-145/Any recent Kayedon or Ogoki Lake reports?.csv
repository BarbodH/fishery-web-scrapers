Him and his group slayed the fish.Didn't fish 5 minutes for pike, just jigged for walleyes.Hot plastic was a 3"" ""Uncle Rico"" color Berkley Ripple Shad.Most of his larger walleyes were caught jigging blade baits in slightly deeper water (25-30')You guys should do well."
6234064,gordy28,2018-08-16 04:27:00,437,Our group is heading to Ogoki Lake next week. Wondering if anyone has been recently? Water levels? Fish patterns? We are pumped to say the least CheersGordy
6234386,hoppy63,2018-08-16 18:27:00,367,Which outfitter are you going in with???
6234458,Guest,2018-08-16 23:37:00,0,"Sorry Gordy28, can't help with a report but maybe I'll see you there. Heading in to Kayedon on the 25th with Brock and a couple of buds. What day do you guys fly out of Ogoki?"
6234500,gordy28,2018-08-17 06:54:00,437,We are going with Ogoki Lake outfitters Chuck - hope to see you there. Chris was a big help to us so will definitely be looking for him Cheers Gordy
6234698,halfmoon007,2018-08-17 20:04:00,121,8-17-18 10pm Just got home from a week mellchett (level down about 2.5 ft.) with Borealforest outfitter. Sue said at their kayedon camp their using a floating dock to unload the plane and shuttling gear back to the main dock with the 14ft alum fishing boats. Bugs were very very light and fishing catch rates were near normal at mellchett. 2 90 degree plus days were a killer on us. Good luck Halfmoon
6234732,gordy28,2018-08-18 05:35:00,437,Thanks so much! Connected with our outfitter last night and they confirmed Ogoki down but had been coming up in recent weeksCheersGordy!
6234814,Bstar,2018-08-18 11:13:00,564,So how was the dock at Melchett? I had seen in a previous report that the dock had been damaged by the ice last winter. We're headed there on the 31st. Thanks for the report.
6234954,halfmoon007,2018-08-18 18:00:00,121,You have mail
6235758,chris.brock,2018-08-20 22:48:00,112,"An ace walleye fisherman Jimmy was at Gordy's same camp last week. I haven't had the chance to call him yet but the texts were positive. They got some walleye over 5 lbs and a day or 2 he estimated he put 150 in the boat himself. I'll get more specifics and forward them to you Gordy. Chuck, hopefully the pattern stays the same because my fishing last week at Percy and talking to Borger from N Caribou, the pike were easy pickings in deeper cabbage. We could be in for a treat, Ogoki has it's share of monster pike."
6235818,gordy28,2018-08-21 07:11:00,437,Thanks Chris! All things permitting we are going on Friday - so pumped! Hopefully we get stable weather and lots of fish Ideally we will see you on the lake Cheers Gordy
