6236238,pinenut,2018-08-22 04:34:00,16,"hey guys, I'm trying to put together a walleye fishing trip in central/western Ontario that I can take my camper, wife, and fat beagle dog to, we are from eastern ohio and I'm trying to stay around 12 to 16 hrs. which puts me above the Algonquin park (heard its not so good for walleye) I've fished wabatogushi two years ago during the mayfly hatch but still did ok, and 8 fly in trips out of nakina and Armstrong excellent fishing and scenery, and twice to quetico park for some marathon paddling and beautiful country. the paddling days are behind me now. I know I can't expect the same fishing we had in those remote areas. I'm just looking for a lake where I can camp(not afraid to drag the camper down a gravel road)and catch a few eyes for supper, some place safe,and semi-remote. I'm just now checking out tamagami lake. any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks. pinenut"
