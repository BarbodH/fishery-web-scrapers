6234242,David Anderson,2018-08-16 12:10:00,2073,"So, great topic. I have been very fortunate as although we don't bring in beer we do bring in Brandy and wine. The amount of liquor per person is 2 - .75L bottles of wine or 1 case of beer or 1.14L (40oz) of hard liquor. I crossed 2 weeks ago and the other car that was with us stated that a person can for instance bring in a case of beer then stop at the Duty free shop (this was International Falls) get whatever you want, say 2 more cases then pick it up at the border. When you declare you state that you are bringing in 1 case and that you have 2 more cases you bought at the duty free store then show them the slip and there is no issue with what you have. I didn't think it worked that way. Is this technically correct?"
6234260,packpro,2018-08-16 12:57:00,695,Not sure of the formula. I was told that you pay tax/duty on the price difference between the cost of a case Canadian and what you paid in the US. Quote a higher price when asked what you paid. In our situation we were over a few case. Duty was about $10.00 more per case. Seems to vary between $10-$12 every year. Still less expensive than buying it up there.
6234556,frdboy,2018-08-17 09:38:00,7,"Good info here, Thanks! Anyone know what a bottle of Crown costs in Canada or what the duty would be if I brought extra? We are heading up for a week on Sat."
6234650,Obabikon,2018-08-17 16:05:00,2370,The big bottle of crown (1.75L) is $62.95 canadian I bought one today.You can always check prices at www.lcbo.com
6234722,frdboy,2018-08-17 21:40:00,7,"Perfect, Thanks for the link!"
6234824,walleyecheek,2018-08-18 11:57:00,2231,The 3 litre bottle of &#x1f451; royal is 140.00 Canadian
6235006,ohiojmj,2018-08-18 20:26:00,1262,"Holy cow, I bought a 4 pack of 1L bottles of CR with soft cooler at duty free before returning to US at Niagara Falls in July for $67US. Last week, I paid $17.50US for each of two L's returning to Montana from British Columbia. Both times over the limit, claimed it, no issue. Sent from my SM-T713 using Tapatalk"
6235786,DougBlack,2018-08-21 05:56:00,29,"Just crossed at Soo, two cases and two bottles, didn't charge duty on extra. Jim Beam and Absolute was $15 and case of beer was $18.50 at duty free. Usually the case unless you are taking large amounts over in."
6233770,Eyesore,2018-08-15 09:33:00,455,It has been years since I last crossed into Canada. Is the tariff still 100% on beer brought into Canada?
6233798,Shellback,2018-08-15 10:08:00,8083,1 case per person is free.

6233838,Obabikon,2018-08-15 11:46:00,2370,$1.70/litre
6233840,Obabikon,2018-08-15 11:48:00,2370,"For the record, that would be just under $15 per case of beer (Canadian)"
6234060,Eyesore,2018-08-16 03:33:00,455,"So they have a formulated rate. Back in the day they asked you what you paid for it in the USA, then charged you that same amount again."
6234076,phishfearme,2018-08-16 05:31:00,1242,the bottom line is that you will not save any significant money by declaring beer/liquor over your allowed limit and paying the duty. the duty makes the stuff about the same total price as you find in Canada. you may however get stuck waiting in line to pay the duty costing travel time. it's just not worth it. phish
6234088,Rondogpike,2018-08-16 05:54:00,24,Crossed at International Falls on 7/26. We had 6 guys and declared 6 liters of vodka and 10 cases of beer. Vodka was duty free and duty on the 10 cases was $77. Blue was $18.50/case at the duty free store so our cost per case was $26.20. Depending on how much beer your group drinks the savings can be significant. When we were much younger we would bring 25 cases.
6234178,milfish,2018-08-16 08:53:00,249,"In Northern Wisconsin you can purchase a 30 pack of Labatts Blue for $17.99 right now. I wonder if its the same beer, flavor, alcohol content ect. as what you purchase in Canada. Quite a big savings even over the Duty Free Store."
6234204,phishfearme,2018-08-16 09:56:00,1242,a case of Blue at the beer stores is $39 Canadian which is about $28US - significant savings? how long did it take to pay the duty? phish
