Speedy worm still wont return my calls or email. It's not the end of the world, but they beat me for $40 and don't even have the decency to apologize. After I get back and post my results from the trip I'm gonna dedicate some time to smashing them on any social media outlet that will listen"
6234578,Boots,2018-08-17 10:33:00,19,All worm bedding products instruct to not wet the bedding in chlorinated water. As the ice melts the milk jug sweats. I just assume the water in the jug way sweat the chlorine out. Maybe im wrong but thats what I do. I get well water or get rain water. Also dont fill the jug to the top as the jug may crack and leak. Fill to about 3 inches to the top of the jug.
6234596,MikeG1,2018-08-17 12:09:00,433,"Good luck on your trip; we'd love to hear about it upon your return. Remember, no dirt crossing into Canada! I've also had great luck with canadiannightcrawlers.com and highly recommend them. Take the carcasses from several filleted fish, put them on a roe and hang it from the dock. With any luck there will be a few leeches hanging on; they are one of the natural baits in the lake and will last for quite some time. Good luck again."
6234298,Thunderpants Johnson,2018-08-16 14:07:00,18,"Need some advice on keeping nightcrawlers alive. I ordered 500 Canadian crawlers from Speedy Worm in MN. I also paid an extra $10 for that cool Frabil worm box, and another $30 to have them shipped in that box. They arrived today in a nylon bag in a cardboard post office box. Its 90 degrees at my house and somehow they are still barely alive. Speedy worm wont answer the phone anymore, and after reading negative reviews this is what they do when they screw up. My question is, what do you guys keep yours in? I'm leaving Saturday morning for Lac Charlotte on my first fly in trip and would hate to have my bait go south. I have more bedding to add. Should I put them in a cooler, leave them in this bag in the box??? Thanks in advance, -Toby Morrilly"
6234306,Boots,2018-08-16 14:40:00,19,Freeze non chlorine water in 1/2 gallon milk jugs. Put 2 frozen frozen jugs in cooler about 2 hours before you intend to leave. When ready to leave put crawlers in cold cooler with bedding. This should last about 24 hours. Take another 2 frozen jugs wrapped in a wet towel in another cooler to replace frozen jugs. Been doing this for years. I usually put my crawlers in the fridge before I leave then place them in the cold cooler.
6234310,Thunderpants Johnson,2018-08-16 14:48:00,18,"Thanks bud, great advice"
6234328,Thunderpants Johnson,2018-08-16 15:16:00,18,"Hey boots, this might be a dumb question, but do they need air holes? They were shipped to my house in a box that was taped shut and survived, but I want to make sure I dont suffocate them"
6234402,hoosiercanadian,2018-08-16 19:39:00,104,"First, no they don't need air holes, but get those crawlers into a fridge and keep cool or they will die quickly. In a fair sized cooler place a frozen jug in the middle of it , add bedding and crawlers, then i like to cover that with damp newspapers just for added insulation. When i get up north i like to add some damp, not soaking wet moss to the crawlers, they always do well, must keep in the shade or cool area."
6234412,Thunderpants Johnson,2018-08-16 20:03:00,18,"Thank you. First thing I did was look for dead ones, then immediately put them in the fridge. My plan was to keep them in the fridge in the Frabil box, but since it never came I like the cooler option. It wont be hot while we are up there, and if I can keep them in the cooler and just switch out the frozen water jug every day that will be great. Thanks for the help!!!!"
6234478,tv4fish,2018-08-17 06:06:00,2694,"Thunder: We also ""have"" been getting our crawlers from Speedy Worm - I have also been disappointed with the quality the last few years. As soon as I get my 500 from them, I transfer them to a large styrofoam cooler and put them in the fridge. When we make the trip up to Lac Seul, I put a couple of the small freezer packs in with them on top of some folded over newspaper pages. We keep that larger container in the fridge when up there. Each day we take out a ""bunch"" of them and put them into a smaller cooler (lunch bucket size) to take while fishing. We put newspaper on top of them and again, a couple of small freezer packs, for the day. This has worked very well for us for many years."
6234518,last chance,2018-08-17 07:51:00,3262,I get my worms from canadiannightcrawlers.com for 58.00. they arrive alive in a Styrofoam cooler with a big chunk of ice sealed in plastic. I cant really tell you the quality crawlers that I get. but they are nice ones. I bought a 12 volt cooler off ebay that has a small coil for cooling that has kept my crawlers alive for as long as 2 weeks without changing anything. but a cooler with ice jugs is the next best option. you can use zip lock bags with ice in a pinch. just make sure and don't let your bedding get to wet.
6234528,Thunderpants Johnson,2018-08-17 08:03:00,18,Thanks everyone
6234560,U D,2018-08-17 09:44:00,249,Boots - just curious why the specification of non-chlorinated water???
