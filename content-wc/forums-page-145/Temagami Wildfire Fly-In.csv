6236604,ARNfishin,2018-08-23 07:02:00,7,"UV, thanks a lot for the response. I bet your grandson is hooked after that! We got word from the pilot late last week that the lake is now accessible. We want to catch walleye but if I end up getting in to a bunch of bass I will be happy with that. Where did you fly in to?"
6231120,ARNfishin,2018-08-08 08:21:00,7,Hey everybody. Me and three other guys have a fly in trip out of Temagami and in to the Lady Evelyn Smooth water area in three weeks. For the last month the area has been decimated by wildfires and currently the lake we are on is off limits as there are still fires 3km east. The owner believes we should be fine by the time our trip hits. What do you think the impact of the wildfire will be on the fishing? I know there has to be a lot of ash dumping in to the lake and the lake is small and 19ft max depth. I just spent 8 days on a drive-in near the Temiscaming area at the end of July and the fishing was really bad. Hoping I'm not looking at a repeat. Any thoughts?
6231138,dhottle,2018-08-08 08:55:00,163,Not to rain on your parade but my experience with ash dumping while fishing for pike was not good. We encountered random forest fires several time while fishing Lake Athabasca a large deep lake in Alberta/Saskatchewan. The falling ash from the nearby fires evidently changed the ph level of the bays on the northern shore and pike fishing deteriorated during that time frame.
6231146,ARNfishin,2018-08-08 09:14:00,7,"Thanks for the reply dhottle. That's kind of what I expected. I'm happy to catch pike, walleye or bass but fear that the ash will put all of them off. I would hope that if the owner has been receiving a lot of negative fishing reports that he would inform us. The other guys have flown with him twice before so we are repeat customers. But if we go and don't catch fish, I won't be a repeat."
6231546,uv2021,2018-08-09 18:02:00,48,Which lake?Who are you flying with?I'm heading into the area this weekend.
6231638,ARNfishin,2018-08-10 05:33:00,7,"UV, we are flying in with Lakeland Airways to Chris Willis Lake. Where are you headed? Would love to hear your report."
6232912,fsz,2018-08-13 18:59:00,144,"Sorry to hear that your trip to temiscaming area was not successful. I was in the area at the beginning of July and we did ok but there weren't any fires at that time I don't think. Were you on Kippawa, Dumoine, or in one of the ZECs?"
6233148,ARNfishin,2018-08-14 09:40:00,7,"We were on Lac des Quinze. My family has had a cabin on the lake for about 30 years. 8 years ago we used to limit out on walleye often. In 60 hours of fishing, I caught maybe 10 walleye over 12"". I dont blame it on the fires as it has been bad for years. Locals give a variety of reasons but I cant really substantiate any of it. The biggest one is that folks are netting the spawners in a small river section that connects the lake to one north of it. But who knows?"
6233438,fsz,2018-08-14 17:38:00,144,"Mike Borger who posts here often has a place up that way but not sure if it's on your lake or another one in the area. He might have some info on the fishery management (or lack there Opf) there. I've heard bass are in your lake, if they are a recent inasive specie that could explain a decline in walleye"
6233602,ARNfishin,2018-08-15 05:44:00,7,"FSZ, there have been bass there since I have been going (25 years). Never seemed to slow the walleye fishing down. Bass fishing has remained about the same over the years as far as I can tell. They recently put in a slot limit on walleye, which doesnt make much of a difference to me because I never catch one over 18"". Ive considered trailering my boat every day to nearby lakes just in hope that things are better."
6236476,uv2021,2018-08-22 17:52:00,48,"You should be fine.The pilot was saying that any fires should not affect the fishing.Your lake is in the park,and the park was still closed when I flew out of the area on the 14th . Lots of the lakes in the area have great bass fishing,some decent pike and walleye.Depends on the lake and the time of the year. I had my gran kids in on their very first fishing trip. So maybe 3-4 hrs a day of ""fishing"" In three days we caught over 100 smallies and 2 pike. If I could have FISHED we could have tripled that. You would see 3 or 4 of them chasing your lure. I was showing my 5 year old grandson the action on a rapala by running it up and down the side of the boat,sort of figure 8 ing for a musky. This smallie comes straight up from the depths,smashes the lure and keeps going for the sky. Right in front of my grand sons face ,splashes back into the water ,soaking him. And that my boy,is how the lure works!"
