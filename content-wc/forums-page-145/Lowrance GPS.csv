6235144,Mojo-NC,2018-08-19 09:31:00,1929,"The Navionics+ card is way more detailed than the preinstalled Lowrance maps. It also allows you to do more with mapping, etc. should you be so inclined. The downside, it's MSRP is around $200 for the initial purchase (US & Canada) and another $99 a year to continue your subscription. You're in luck, I just checked, it's currently a little under $150 on Amazon."
