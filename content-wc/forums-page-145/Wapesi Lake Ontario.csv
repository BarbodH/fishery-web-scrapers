6208958,Ebarnett,2018-06-15 09:46:00,60,"My group fished Wapesi through Pickerel Arm Camps a few years ago. Fantastic lake! It is more of a shallow lake so finding fish is very easy. This is a great numbers lake, easy to catch 50-100 if you fish all day. We got tired of catching in the mornings and took the afternoon and evenings off mostly. Good size fish can be found as well, our biggest Walleye was just under 26 and pike just under 40. Also the camp Lee has there is one of the nicest and most comfortable you may ever find for a fly in."
6231172,danvan18$,2018-08-08 10:14:00,67,"Yes we had a great trip, fishing got better once the weather warmed up. First two days were nasty cold with wind and rain. We stayed in the North cabin and plan to likely return next year. We got 2 wallys nearly 27"" and several nice pike. Where did you find your most luck? Thanks, Dan"
6231174,Ebarnett,2018-08-08 10:26:00,60,Lots of good spots. I remember one of our boats catching a hundred on the backside of an island in the northern end of the lake. Also several excellent bays in the south of the lake. In the middle was a long unseen shelf that jetted out. Caught a lot of walleye and our biggest pike there. Also a lot of sunken islands and humps throughout. We had a great day fishing the river in the north that leads to Ray (??) lake. Though we didnt have much success up at Ray lake.
6231372,danvan18$,2018-08-09 07:20:00,67,"We did not venture down to the south end, but plan to next year. Would like to know if that island was the one very near the North camp to the right of the cabin? I think we missed that long shelf as well. We did well at the mouth of the north river and went all the way up to that other lake as well, but it was too rocky to get through. There also was a nice spot by the weed bed to the left of the cabin. Our best luck was on the western shoreline. We use mostly plastic baits, did you guys try any live bait? Thanks, Dan"
6231460,Ebarnett,2018-08-09 11:27:00,60,"Yes, the large island to the right of the north cabin. We found fish all around it, but in particular they were stacked up one day on the North side of the island. We personally found the fishing to be even better in the south bays. If you look on Google Earth satalite view of the lake, you will see in the middle of the lake a long narrow strip of land, where the land ends, the shelf continues a good ways across. Honestly the fishing for us was very good all around the lake. Our groups consensus was just about anywhere you thought “i bet there is a fish there” and you threw out your line, you caught a fish in that area. Then when we hit a school of them, you could sit on them for an hour and catch a bunch. We did not use any live bait, only plastic."
6231888,danvan18$,2018-08-10 14:51:00,67,Ok thanks. I think I found that strip you mentioned and we were close by but on the shoreline. Sounds like more exploring next year down south! Dan
