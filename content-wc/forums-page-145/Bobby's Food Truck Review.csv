Seems odd that one or two places could not attract enough business to give it a try. Maybe they did, and the demand wasn't there. We've ended up with stuff from the convenience section, tried the bakery, but options were quite limited, although good. Bill"
6204056,v-bay gord,2018-06-04 10:38:00,3168,For those of you passing through Vermilion Bay and needing a bite to eat I would highly recommend the food truck (Bobby's Bites) next to Bobby's. A limited menu but great food. I see they also have fish and chips........local fresh whitefish. Check it out and be sure and check out the tackle shop in Bobby's. Open from 11-7..I should also mention that Buster BBQ has now opened up in the Fort Vermilion.........great reports on the food as well. The bakery right next door for great coffee. etc.....
6204114,pjshorthorn,2018-06-04 12:06:00,5654,And here I was thinking that you moved the food truck to the lodge so that you could cook everyone's catch after cleaning their fish too. Just a big letdown I must say. I guess it just doesn't pay to offer extra services now that the HST tax rebate has gone by the wayside for us Americans...... PjShorthorn
6204556,Duflebag,2018-06-05 07:46:00,218,Thanks a lot for the update Gord. Nice to hear that Vermilion Bay has more eating options again.
6204956,nitroman,2018-06-05 20:06:00,368,How is Quackers for breakfast? Busy? Thinking about stoping there Saturday morning for some eggs and bacon!

6233594,Capt Morgan,2018-08-15 05:17:00,77,"My wife stopped in 12 day's ago, got 2 orders of routine split between 4 people was very good. And filled us up."
6233706,v-bay gord,2018-08-15 07:35:00,3168,"Yes, the fish and chips at the Bobby's food truck is amazing... .well worth the stop."
6233832,Guest,2018-08-15 11:26:00,0,"We visited the food truck at Bobby's a couple of times a few years ago when it was an older truck. They had decent breakfast sandwiches and pancakes. However, the past two years both going in and leaving, they were not open. This was around 11:00 AM on our way in and 7:00 Am on our way out on a Saturday and Friday both years. I would think those would be prime hours to make some good money. Are they not open for breakfast anymore? I see it is a modern trailer now rather than the old van that we ate at a couple of times. Someone asked about Quackers. We tried it this year - never again. We arrived about 10:50 AM. We were handed breakfast menus. When it came time to order, one of us wanted French toast - they were out for the day. Another wanted pancakes, sorry out of those too. Oh yeah, they were also out of oatmeal, sausage and something else. Essentially all we could order was eggs and hashbrowns. They said the hashbrowns were hand cut. They looked suspiciously like the cubed hashbrowns out of a bag, and tasted like it too. Service was very slow. Later, our waitress told us that she had to cook the food herself. It sounded like the cook refused to cook any more breakfast items. A few minutes after we arrived, the next group asked if they were still serving breakfast, and they were told no. The waitress then lied to them and told them that we had arrived earlier than we actually did, which is why we got breakfast. That first group after us had 1 person order a bowl of chili. The next group that came in the door was told that they were out of chili. They could have at least told us lunch was starting in a few minutes and we could wait, or that it would take a few extra minutes to prepare. We would have been fine with that since they were out of most breakfast items. Either way we won't be going back. The food we did receive was not very good."
