6230280,rockape,2018-08-06 08:18:00,215,"I haven't stayed at Country Cabins, but I have fished the area extensively. My friend used to own a cabin on Botham Bay right by Country Cabins. There are some great musky spots within a mile of Country Cabins. Smallies too. Big V doesn't have walleyes in it. Neither does Little V. There may be a few, but you will have a horrible trip if you walleye fish on either one of those lakes. Big V is awesome for smallmouth and lake trout. I have caught a lot of muskies out of Big V, but they all seem to be 38 inches. Did get a 44 once. Pike fishing is decent too. If you are using Country Cabin's boat, make sure you can trailer it to the Abram ramp and the Deception ramp on Lac Seul. Then you will be in walleye heaven. Little V is awesome for pike, smallmouth and musky. It IS NOT connected to Big V so you would have to trailer the boat again. PM me if you want more details."
6230358,Skywagon,2018-08-06 10:52:00,1106,"Ditto on that, better do some research."
6230382,x4flatfish,2018-08-06 12:00:00,319,"Will be staying on Big V. in 2 weeks. We stay at River Edge Outfitters. Do yourself a favor (unless you are camping) and stop and look at this place while you are there. Only about a mile further toward Hudson. All new cabins, and VERY competitive pricing. We love it there, and I have stayed at almost all of the lodges in the area over the last 50 years. What previous posters said is accurate with the exception that you don't need to trailer to Deception or Abram landings. much closer, you can get into Lac Suel from the landing in Lost Lake, just a couple miles past River Edge toward Hudson. We do this every day very easily, catch our Walleye etc. and then come back to our completely renovated cabin on Big V. If we want to catch smallmouth or trout we spend a day on Big v. Some other warnings. NO live bait on Big v. and pretty sure that Little V is catch and release only. (someone correct me if I'm wrong) Bottom line you need to do some more research as I believe that the lakes accessible from Little V require portage as well. You will not catch walleye without going into Lac Suel or Minitaki. Make sure that the camp has boats at these locations or allow you to trailer there...."
6230442,wooglin,2018-08-06 13:57:00,371,"My group stayed there from 03, 04, 05, 06. very nice place considering we paid $50 each for a week of camping on a site with water and electric. I think ownership has changed since then, but the location of it was fine, they had a decent fish cleaning house and a communal freezer. The shower house wasn't too bad. Overall, for the price, not bad. We fished Big V. for a half day, saw the biggest musky in my life off a point there while smallie fishing. Gave lakers a shot, but no takers. Besides that, we trucked to the Lac Seul launch and fished from there every day. As mentioned, no walleye in Big V. Use the Lost Lake launch, you'll get walleye there. Please PM me details on how you got a hold of them, I didn't know they were back up and running. Judy used to run the place, but I think it's someone else. Old trip reports here:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...ad.php?t=72141https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...ad.php?t=73291https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...ad.php?t=75533 Check out my attachment for some spots. The first 2 years I was there, we covered this water in a 14ft boat with a 25HP motor....just to put it into perspective."
6231948,rockape,2018-08-10 17:22:00,215,"I said to use the Deception ramp because a local said it is a shorter boat ride if you are heading up the lake. Yeah, if he is staying at Country Cabins way up 664 then it is a really short drive to Lost vs. a long drive on land to Deception. Makes sense! I haven't been up 664 in years. I'll have to check out these new cabins! And catch that GIANT musky! Bottom line. You can't lose fishing the Sioux Lookout area. Just make sure the lake you are fishing has in it what you are fishing for!"
6231986,PA troutguy,2018-08-10 19:38:00,58,"Each of cabins at country cabin has a shower and full kitchen. I have fished out of there my last four or five trips. If you are fishing big V watch out for the rock reefs that come from the bottom some are marked on a map some not. I have a navionics chip and a hard map and still don't have them all marked. The small mouth fishing is good. If you want to fish little V it is about a 25 minute drive to Ojibway Park entrance. There is a launch in the park and a user fee to enter the park. The lost lake launch is improved the little V one is not. I have not tried River's Edge so the other commenters would be more useful. Country cabin does not have a launch you have to trailer your boat to the public launch about 1/2 mile down the road. I usually launch from there and fish Big V most of the trip because there are docks at country cabin you can use. Big V is artificial only. I have been checked on the lake and at my cabin, the usual license and how many fish. The lodge on little V encourages catch and release not sure what the regulations say. Lake trout is closed on little V. Good luck"
6232824,Country Cabins,2018-08-13 13:41:00,2,Owner of Country Cabins here. We find that using the Lac Seul Boat Launch on Lost Bay is much easier as it's only a 5 minute drive from camp
6232828,Country Cabins,2018-08-13 13:44:00,2,"Not only does Judy still own Country Cabins, she operates and maintains it solo.Brand new 20x20 fish house, new decks, new docks, improved bathroom facilities, etc. etc. Call for a reservation at 1-844-895-FISH (3474)"
