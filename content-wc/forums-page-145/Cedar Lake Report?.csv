6227958,rockape,2018-07-31 10:05:00,215,Has anyone fished Cedar in the last few weeks? I haven't heard anything. Clark's Resorts have a fishing report blog that they had Cedar reports along with all of their fly-in lakes too. Cedar hasn't been on the report for several weeks. I love Cedar! I like to hear good reports on it! Does anyone know what is up?
6228464,Guest,2018-08-01 11:55:00,0,"We were at Cedar Lake the 21st-27th. We stayed at Keystone Lodge on the east side. We only fish the east side. Other than two slow days, we had excellent walleye fishing as far as numbers go. Size was difficult. Our group of 4 only caught one fish over 18"". We were mostly pulling spinners with a minnow. I would have tried jigging some locations for some bigger fish, but the rest of my group doesn't like to jig. Early in the week, fish were a little deeper, with most of ours caught in 19-21 ft. As the week progressed they got shallower, and the best bite by the end was in 15-18 ft. Musky fishing wasn't great for us. We saw a lot of fish, but many were very lazy follows and they would not follow into the figure 8. Good luck while you are up there!"
6228496,youngknight,2018-08-01 13:11:00,228,Wow...only 1 walleye over 18 inches...surprising and most have been very disappointing.
6228736,Guest,2018-08-02 07:32:00,0,"Yes, it was a little disappointing. But, we never catch very many bigger fish there so it wasn't totally unexpected. Usually our group gets 1-3 fish over 23 inches each year, but most of what we catch is under 18"". We are there primarily to musky fish, and are walleye fishing to eat while we are there and to bring some home. If we were going primarily for bigger walleye, I would go to a different lake."
6228856,Northpoint,2018-08-02 11:47:00,38,I am thinking about a trip to this lake as I have read that it is good for musky. We would probably add a couple of days onto a walleye trip to Lac Suel. We would be very happy with even a few smaller musky. Would this be the right lake to try? What experiences have you had there? Thanks
6230270,rockape,2018-08-06 08:10:00,215,"Cedar is an AWESOME musky lake. I'd say it is the easiest lake in the area to catch them. I caught one just tossing a spinner bait over the side of the boat. Little 25 incher, but it is a musky! We have caught a lot of 40-45 inch fish out of Cedar. I did catch a HUGE 54 incher about 3 years ago. I have caught them all over the lake too. Southwest, Times Square, the river by the burnt bridge, and all the way down the east side. The think we have noticed about Cedar is the pike numbers are a lot lower, and there aren't very many big pike either. I have seen some photos of guys with some 40 inch pike, but I have never caught one myself. The muskies rule the roost on Cedar from my opinion. We have caught them on every kind of lure as well. Bucktails, tiny spinners, big rubber, topwaters, you name it. I haven't heard much on reports from this year. Sounds like the walleye fishing is in the toilet though. I hope the musky fishing isn't there too. If you want maps of where I have caught them, PM me."
6233656,Smeds,2018-08-15 06:40:00,103,"A group of us (4) were at Clark's from 08/04 - 08/11. Had to work to find them, but we always got into the walleyes morning and evening. They pretty much shut down during the mid-day, which was weird. Found them on scattered rock reefs and humps, usually never deeper than 30'. Biggest was 24"", lots released ... some in grease! Spent some time chasing those crappies on the East side, got into those for 2 days. Wow. 12"" - 15"" average, unreal. I was so glad I had spot lock that last day (iPilot), as the school was pretty small, but loaded with pigs. Once they moved on, we moved slowly looking for them, spot-locked again, and pounded them. Best crappie fishing since the old days through the ice on Upper Red. Was with 3 guys who didn't really care for Musky fishing, but we did land 3 trolling. Others in camp strictly targeting musky did quite well. Many fish 45"" and up. Seemed to be a mostly rock bite, the weeds just weren't holding many fish per the reports. Clark's Northern Lights Resort on Cedar is a class-act, and the cabins were great. VERY grateful for the A/C those last few days, with temps well into the 80's. It was our first time there ... we'll go back."
6234154,prov1800,2018-08-16 07:32:00,5010,Fished cedar lake Monday and Tuesday.filmed a show with the xtreme angler(Karl Kalonka).only fished 3 hrs each morning.Monday was pretty windy with 40-50 km winds so tough conditions but managed to catch up around 30 walleyes and Tuesday we did a crappie day in a cold front.8 c first thing in the morning.so from 100 f to 50 f over night.didnt seem to change fishing much.walleyes were on fire Monday and had no problems catching them but did need a pretty sensitive rod to detect the light bite.glad to have a legend tournament to help out.Crappies were a bit sluggish first thing in the morning but went back to our first spot which wad slow to start but turned on when we went back.Got some great footage for the show.Cedar is always good fishing.If it seems slow you have to try different tactics that's all.fish move around.cant just find some and use your spot lock they don't just stay under your boat all day.Dont blame the lake.
6234192,Smeds,2018-08-16 09:26:00,103,"Did you even read my post? Not even close to what I said. Spot lock was used for crappies only. Walleye's ""pretty much"" shut down mid-day, but we still caught a bunch ... just not the red-hot fishing AM & PM provided. Every last soul in camp had the same results BTW. Glad you got a good show with your tournament legend though."
6234236,prov1800,2018-08-16 11:45:00,5010,read all posts.whatever you thinki said is not anything against you.just made a comment about the fishing on cedar which is fantastic as usuall.the rod did help a ugly stick just would not have had the same results.
