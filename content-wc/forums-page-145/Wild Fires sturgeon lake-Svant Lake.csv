To sy im excited would be a gross understatement. I am flippin geeked!!! Having said all that i am a little concerned with reports of wildfires in the general area of savant lake. I did a little simple math using the legend on the Ontario interior ministries websites map of active fires. (sorry for the run on sentence) According to the map there is an active fire roughly 36 miles from trppers point. I have no idea how this may or may not impact our trip. If anyone knows how these things shake out normally i would love to here from you. Again, we are counting the seconds. As long as im here might as well ask how the bites been? we will be fishing sturgeon couture harris and squaw. love to get info on those lakes as well. Topo maps are hard to come by in that neck of the woods. Thanks for your time and i hope to hear from some you. Cronk Stay safe and good fishin!!!"

We are on different sides of Ontario but I imagine the fire would have a similar effect. Someone said the pike fishing really turned off due to the increase in pH level of the water. I found a report from last week out of the Temagami area that said fishing was good as soon as the hot weather ended. Im leaving in 6 days so I am (not literally) in the same boat as you are."
