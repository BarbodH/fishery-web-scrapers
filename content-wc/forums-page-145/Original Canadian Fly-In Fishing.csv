One member of group recorded 168 fish for the 6 days. Personal best walleye was 23-1/4"" but others caught up to 26. Pike were very slow but I did catch one 41 inch fish, released. Weather got hotter as week went on so fishing slowed and by the last day we struggled to get bit. It was about 90F with no breeze at all. Had an issue with solar batteries mid-week so had no water in cabin for 2-1/2 days. Luckily the north cabin was empty so we boated over for showers and water. CFF no longer provides drinking water so we had to boil lake water for drinking & ice all week. Comments on water would be appreciated. Do others provide drinkable water? I considered this to be a negative since cost didn't go down."
6232862,phishfearme,2018-08-13 16:13:00,1242,thanks for the honest report. we got the platypus this year for our fly in and regret not having it sooner. see:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...light=platypus phish
6234092,Rondogpike,2018-08-16 06:05:00,24,"Agree with phishfearme, we also use a platypus water filter. We fly-in every year. We hang the bag above the kitchen sink and drain into a 5 gallon collapsible jug. We use filtered water for everything including ice trays and coffee percolators. Probably overkill but this system makes it very easy to have all the filtered water you need."

We back washed and then pre filtered through a cloth the rest of the week. Often had small pieces of weeds, freshwater shrimp, other small creatures and sand on the cloth when we were done which made up appreciate the platypus that much more. Never been to a place that provided potable water."
6234434,camppalos,2018-08-16 21:02:00,1,Thanks for the post. Our group has been going with CFF for the past 10 years. Diana and Stan were the best. We decided to switch this year because last year was very slow fishing except for Century. Figured with new owner time to try something different. Sorry to hear about the water issues. Our new outfitter provide 5 gallons jugs of water.
