We didn't do very well and would be considered one of my worst trips ever, although - admittedly we were all artificial and weren't prepared to fish deep.I think the new owners is Clint and he was involved at that time. I would recommend getting advice on how to fish the lake before going."

Fishing was good, walleye averaged 21"" or so. Numbers good. Some pike in high 30's. Only disappointment was not being able to boat up into Horseshoe lake. The water was too high to motor up the rapids. Fishery is on the small side if unable to get into Horseshoe, On the other hand, if you can get into it, you'll never be able to fish it all. One reason we picked it was the ability to fly into Winnipeg in lieu of driving. Overall, a great fishing trip. Would not go in there with a group larger than 4."
