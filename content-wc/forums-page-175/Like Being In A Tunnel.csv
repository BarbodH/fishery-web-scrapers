We arrived Saturday with rain, and didn't see the sun until Thursday, water temp 60 degrees, 57 when we left. An interesting observation re: weather - I realized we didn't see the camp from the boat until Thursday PM, due to a combination of sometime fog and rain. Being able to enjoy the great autumn display of the turning leaves and aquatic beauty was confined to the last two days. In many ways, the riding around/fishing reminded me of being in a continual tunnel, with limited visibility much of the time. As to the fishing: I considered it to be very good, as has been my experience the last 3 years. Our party of five's largest walleye was 26""(released), next was 19"". Considering that we did not target walleyes, nor use live bait, this was acceptable. My largest crappie was 15-1/2"", largest pike, about 10 pounds, both released. Another interesting observation was that we did not catch any small mouth this trip, somewhat unusual, but more or less immaterial, at least to me. Air temp ranged from being in the 40's overnight, to in the 60's during the day.completely acceptable, especially considering the amount of rain which we had. There was almost no wind, first white caps I saw was on a lake in MN on the way home. I have been up at LOW during this same time, and experienced driving sleet and considerably less temperature. While camping. Cedar Lake was down about a foot, looked to go up about 6"" while we were there. Discovered a new-to-me fish breading which I'll share (don't remember where I first heard of it,maybe on WC?). I made up a batch at home and it was the only breading we used all week. It seemed similar to that used at Culver's, however it was called Long John Silver's Breading. Our guys were making fish sandwiches, and loving it. The neat thing abut it, other than the great taste, was that I used the same oil all week, there was absolutely no residue left in the iron skillet, in fact, I finished off the week with onion rings in the same oil. Long John Silver's FishBreading 3/4 cup flour 2 TB cornstarch 1/4 tea b. soda 1/4 tea b.powder !/4 tea salt 3/4 cup water That's about it. I'll spend the winter months trying to decide how many pounds of unneeded tackle to leave at home for my trips next year. (wink,wink) Bill"

5820969,BornToFish,2017-10-19 09:21:00,1224,"Greetings Bill,Your trip report was outstanding as it brought back many memories of fishing on nearby Perrault Lake during mid to late September. Thanks for sharing it with us!I know exactly what you mean about having the feeling of traveling in a tunnel. There were many mornings of fishing on Perrault Lake during late September when the morning fog did not clear off until mid to late morning. There were some days that the fog stayed most of the day.I always thought of fishing in Sunset Country during September as having the best of the best weather, and the worst of the worse weather, both in the same day.Thanks for sharing the recipe for the fish breading. I will file it away for future reference.I'm glad that you had such a wonderful trip. I too will be reviewing my fishing equipment to see what can stay home next spring (wink, wink)!Good fishing and tight lines!!"
