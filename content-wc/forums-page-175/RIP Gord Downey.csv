5820049,martinbns,2017-10-18 16:25:00,1520,"Gord Downey, singer for the Tragically Hip passed away today. I saw them 5 times including a show here in Winnipeg on the final tour. The show knowing Gord has terminal brain cancer was a bit like a combo wedding, christening and funeral for Canadiana. For those of you who don't know The Hiphttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6QDjDPRF5chttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL6I...=RDvL6IlKP3UOI"

5822065,martinbns,2017-10-19 20:21:00,1520,"I posted this partly so many of you who are American but spend time up here would appreciate how much the Tragically Hip resonated with us over the past 25+ years. There was a time when the Hip really tried to penetrate the US market and they never did, the usual result for a Canadian artist if that happened was to become more mainstream and by association more Amercian, the Hip just stopped trying to penetrate the US and celebrated what being Canadian was all about. They wrote songs about great moments in Canadian history, small towns in Canada and other things that made us feel for brief periods a bit more ""American"" about being Canadian. When they were trying to penetrate the US, they would tour around playing bars and universities in the US for a few hundred people then come back to Canada and play in front of 20,000+ in any major city multiple nights. Gord had an incredible way of talking to Canadian's through his music that mattered more than maybe any Canadian artist of the last 50 years. As American's who love to come to Canada to fish, I would encourage you all to make a playlist of Tragically Hip songs for your drive up. Then as you stop at each stage google what the lyrics are all about, then look around at us when we chat with you on the lake or at the restaurant and you will have at least a tiny window into the soul of many Canadians and understand what is important to us and how we are slightly but significantly different from you as Americans. We are very shy about being patriotic Canadians and Gord Downey along with a few other things like the Winter Olympics bring this out in us, and for that Gord Downey and his band mates are great Canadians."
