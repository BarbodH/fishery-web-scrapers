5807041,Moosebunk,2017-10-11 08:48:00,211,"The short version or the long? To summarize here, I spent a few weeks in Nunavut this August working in an awesome little place named Taloyoak. This tundra town in the Kitikmeot region is Canada's furthest north settlement on our mainland. Rugged and very remote, here Arctic life and culture rule. Lucky to have free time and a fishing pole, on some days off I was able to search and find char, lake trout, caribou and more while out on the beautiful barren lands. A full story with many outdoor and fish pictures is posted at my own website if looking to view.

5811865,Moosebunk,2017-10-13 21:21:00,211,"Thanks for taking some time out to give it a read fellas. I know that some of the people of the arctic, in these small remote towns which receive such limited media of any sort, kinda like it when their beautiful countryside and a bit of their culture is put on display. From a working and traveling anglers perspective, write-ups like these are a dream to create. Enjoying Nunavut has become a favorite part of life. Fish are a bonus for sure, but the outdoors there is always something to behold."
