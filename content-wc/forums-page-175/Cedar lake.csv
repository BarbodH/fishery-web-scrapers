5814065,kuledude,2017-10-15 15:43:00,18,"Disability Legal class dismissed....I hope you ask more questions for the sake of other mobility disabled people who might need the advice? Yes, I do lecture to various mobility disability groups on their rights with special emphasis on the outdoor disabled sportspeople including hunters and fishermen. Most questions they ask I can answer just as good as any attorney but without the $250 an hour charge. You take care and I hope you never get what I got."

5809929,That Minnesota guy,2017-10-12 20:47:00,8293,"Nice report. To take the thread off course.... as a guide do you run foot operated trolling motor up front, cable steer or a Ulterra? Reason I ask is when I had my Ranger I really liked the cable steer for casting off the front. Now I have the Ulterra and of course love the stow & deploy but don't like it when casting. Running it with the remote works but not as easily as the cable. Haven't tried it with the foot pedal. Just wondering what you use. Thanks."
5810305,prov1800,2017-10-13 06:48:00,5010,I use my old power drive with the foot control.its been on the boat for 10 years.its still going strong.i usually operate it from the back of my boat which is a tiller.in some cases for extra control i use my vantage at the back of the boat.it lets me back out of certain spots.one day ill upgrade.i have used the new motors on some of the camp boats i guide out of but still used the foot control.almost need to unless iam not casting then i can sit back with the remote.
5810425,prov1800,2017-10-13 07:52:00,5010,"Might add that both muskies hit the lure out from the boat as did the pike.would say 6 ft of water.no figure 8,s required.lol.walleyes where of a point in around 18-20 ft.found them in 3 spots in basically the same structure.did see a number of fish in he 30+ depth but not taking any chances that deep loosing fish. Going to try and get out a couple of more times but iam running out of time with my deer hunt coming up."
5810553,Bakefish,2017-10-13 08:49:00,1077,I used my Terrova and now my Ulterra strictly with the remote. My last trip to Canada I used the foot control with the remote hanging from my neck. What a dope I was for not using that foot control before. The remote used in combination with foot control is the best of both worlds.
5812529,kuledude,2017-10-14 13:06:00,18,"Here is viewpoint most won't think about about bow mounted trolling motors until it happens to YOU. I have a highly rare neurological condition subdisease/kinda related to MS called Demylinating Polyneuropathy. There is no cure and there is no treatment as it is slowly over 10 years paralyzing/weakening my legs and feet as I have poor balance with extremely SEVERE FOOT DROP IN BOTH FEET. I'm still walking with a cane but I have been told it looks ugly. It was godsend when Minn kola came out with wireless remotes with GPS control ability on their Power drive Bow units as now I can sit safely and don't have to worry about a foot controlled cable unit that was useless with my feet anyway. I now sit on the back floor mounted seat pedestal and slow troll spinners with the front remote controlled electric. I think now I might buy the automatic stowing Ulterra since my neurologist told me he will write me a prescription for any device that helps me function normally with my disability condition since I do have a problem stowing my Powerdrive unit with my balance and leg problems as I cant stand up unless I risk falling out of the boat. This means I can declare it as a medical device on my taxes for my disability mobility problems since an Ulterra is close to $2000 and my Power drive cost me close to $1000. Now, with the power drive unit that I bought WITHOUT a foot control, I can even sit in anyplace in the boat and have complete control of the bow mounted electric with the push of some buttons.....cable foot controlled units for me are useless as I didn't even like them when I had good legs. Clunky foot box with a stiff cable and poor/hard to use speed control was a pain. You would be surprised at the fishermen and outdoor sportspeople who don't know you can use a tax deduction for ANY device including my $15,000 Polaris Ranger with power steering if you have a mobility disability situation that affects normal life activities. I just recently purchased a tax deductible step up ladder device for my boat trailer that allows me to climb aboard my boat safely that has side grab/hand rail. LMAO...Why didn't I think of that? Somebody is bound to ask what i i use...so here is what I use to get my cripple legs in the boat: Quality Mark 28800 Bow Step....it is PORT 3 step left hand rail."
5813169,rzep,2017-10-15 06:39:00,1196,"You can declare anything as ""medical device"" on your tax return. Problem starts when you need to justify ""medical"" need during the audit."
5813505,kuledude,2017-10-15 11:14:00,18,"When you walk like a 80 year old drunk with braces on both your legs with a cane and you have a board certified Neurologist write you a prescription to make your life somewhat enjoyable....The chance of me getting audited is slim to none. Pal. . I don't NEED to justify anything to condescending people like you, as people like you would tell me to get to the back of the bus or you would park in my handicapped parking space! And No...you can't declare anything as medical mobility device, only things a specialist doctor writes a prescription. No, your family doctor or any other doctor can't white prescriptions for mobility devices not in his medical field. It is highly regulated. A dermatologist can't get you a handicapped parking permit but a neurologist or cardiac doctor surely can!"
5813681,That Minnesota guy,2017-10-15 12:31:00,8293,Feel better?
5813761,rzep,2017-10-15 13:00:00,1196,I hope he does
