It has since been operated by another person with whom I have not met. Marvin really built up a nice resort when he owned it. Endy has, if my memory is correct, 3 two bedroom cabins that will sleep six and at least one if not two very large cabins that will sleep ten or more. The lake system that the resort is on is a chain called Bush, Ida, Foxear, and Beatty. Beatty is a very good Pike and lake trout lake. There are lots of good smaller lakes in the area and two river system two miles down the road. A fabulous portage lake called Ohnaman Lake about thirtyfive miles from camp that most of the local outfitters have boats on fabulous fishing. The fishing in the area is really good, but, can test your skills at times. Pm me and I'll give you all the information I can think of. Loved the area. p.s. go to pashalake.com he is a resort owner right across the road from endy's. He is also new since I have been threre, but, has a nice web site the two resorts share a stream to the chain. Mike"

Paint is a river system that runs about 10 miles very good fishing for walleye and pike good lakers in the section closest to the cabin. has water 160 ft deep in areas in front of dock. Come July when the water is down the top half of the river is almost inaccessable we used to pull small boats across the mud flats to access it. Although you are restricted, fishing can still be good on the lower half. If a group is willing to trailer up and hit other lakes the fishing can be outstanding. I have fished June, JUly, and, September up there."

BUT we fished a few times on the hotter days. the pike were on the hooks fast and we only used lures. the cabins are a 10 on a scale of 10. we used to go to Pasha lake before that for years. Bush lake Paint lake cabins put the others to shame. if you go, tell the supervisor RAMBO Says Hi. he has boat rentals to, but I think you have to supply your own small outboard motor. we just fished off the shore right outside our cabin. enjoy and have as much fun as we had."
