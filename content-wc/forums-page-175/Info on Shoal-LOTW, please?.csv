We have never fished either LOTW or Shoal before. Appreciate ANY info about this area...all posts and PMs appreciated. Thanks in advance guys, John"
5801913,martinbns,2017-10-08 16:17:00,1520,That's a bit of a scary part of the lake to navigate. The channels in there are very tight and most of Shoal is uncharted.

5803177,Thompmd,2017-10-09 08:10:00,320,"I have been to LOTW about 15yrs and Shoal this year for the first time(We were at Ash Rapids this year and actually spoke to Don before making our final decision). No reason for not choosing Don BTW. We always stay a week and have been from the 1st week of June to the first week in July. Last year we stayed at Crow Rock on LOTW. IMO, the fishing really wasn't much different. It has always been good to excellent overall.Who knows why but the year we stayed at Crow Rock and this year at Ash Rapids/Shoal we saw and caught fewer muskies than ever, we always caught/saw more over in Sabaskong Bay? But we are far from experts but we did fish both areas the same way.We generally fish for about everything but generally we target smallmouth, then northern/muskie and then Walleye. We always stayed on a housekeeping package,brought our own boat etc.We haven't made a final decision for where we are going in 2018(considering Rainy but likely going back to Ash Rapids).I'm happy to talk baits,patterns or any other questions you have either here or through PM if you prefer.Good Luck and let me/us know how your trip goes."
