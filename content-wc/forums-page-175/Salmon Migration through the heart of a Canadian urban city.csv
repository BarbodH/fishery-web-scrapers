5817337,Fishingframes,2017-10-17 06:33:00,33,Good question - there is the concept of imprinting so the fish know where to return. They normally release the fry in the river and if they're able to survive for 1-2 yrs - they'll return when it's time to spawn. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

I think these fish return to the harbor, and then just find a local river. Imprinting isn't 100%. Some stray. straying is a good evolutionary strategy."
