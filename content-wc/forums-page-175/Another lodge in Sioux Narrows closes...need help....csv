5812385,kuledude,2017-10-14 11:36:00,18,"LMAO.........I was going to say the same thing, but I didn't want to cause trouble. Indeed, in my world 5 days is 2 days short of week. I have hard time staying for just a 7 day fishing week in Canada since rain and bad weather with shorten your 7 day week into a 4 day trip. If you go for a week and have long 8-10+ hour drive home as I do, your week trip to Canada ends up be close to 10 days. What I think is happening here is the group members have only a 7 day employer vacation window and they only want to pay for 5 days because the other 2 days they use to drive to and from....for me, that is not doable. When I was doing only week Canada trips here is how i did it. I got a Camp/Lodge where the fishing week was Saturday to Saturday. Most drive-in places you can't check in until Saturday afternoon. I left on Friday Morning and got a motel for Friday night and positioned myself to be at the camp/Lodge Saturday PM. Those same camps/Lodges want you out by the following Saturday by 8-9 AM so you have the rest of Saturday and Sunday to Drive home. It is very rare to get a full week of good fishing weather in Canada.... A week trip is really a 3-4 day fishing adventure.....Now I only go for 2 weeks as the places I go in NorthWest Ontario, require a 10-12 hour or 1100-1200 mile drive which is way to much to drive in one day. Nope...I refuse to fish in the cold wet rain. After 45 years of walleye fishing all over the United States and Canada , I have yet have any memorable hot walleye bite when it was raining. Even the Fly-Ins will want you there Saturday morning so a person might have to leave on Thursday to get there by Saturday AM. Moral of the story: 3-5 day Canadian fishing trips SUCK.....and that includes the ALGOMA, Ontario fished out places. I dumped the Algoma area 10 years ago in favor of Northwest Ontario and never once have a been disappointed....I will drive the extra 500-600 miles ...no problemo."
5812513,v-bay gord,2017-10-14 12:56:00,3168,"Why is it outrageous? I was only going by what you stated in your original post. I still think a short trip ""OVER"" a weekend would be a non starter in most camps that do a Saturday to Saturday schedule.........but glad you found an option.....especially in June."
5829177,Guest,2017-10-25 08:32:00,0,Why crap on the Algoma region???? Its been 10 yrs maybe its time you went back.
5829361,mjayn,2017-10-25 11:12:00,1188,"I've been fishing walleye less years then you and have had 20+ days of incredible walleye fishing in the rain in Canada, and many more in the states. My second best day ever was in the pouring rain in Canada. I will fish the cold wet rain anytime/everytime I am on a trip. If its pouring and the fish aren't biting I will likely go in early, or take a few hours off midday with plans to retry nearing dusk. But I have to try. I have watched the barometer drop so many times right before a walleye feeding frenzy I wouldn't dare miss it. Admittedly it is usually at the start of a storm or as fronts roll through. I have had straight up bad luck fishing the the heart of rain storms (when the front came through many hours or days earlier). Eitherway fishing in the rain is not usually comfortable. I just thought it odd you have been fishing that long and never had a great day in the rain."
5829545,MrSimon,2017-10-25 12:43:00,922,I don't like fishing in storms. I LOVE fishing in steady rain .... the walleye bite like crazy. So do the pike. And the smallies. I rainy breezy day in the heat of summer is gold!!
5804265,LOW1,2017-10-09 14:51:00,2828,"Perhaps Totem has not yet closed for the season and you could eat there?Indianhead was serving dinner earlier, but reservations were needed.Big John's is closed for the season.So, Gill's may be as good as it gets.On my recent trip to SN heard a few rumours that some new restaurants are planned. Hope they turn out to be accurate.It would be great if White Birch restaurant would open. That was a great place for dinner."
5806265,Lazy Fisherman,2017-10-10 18:22:00,276,We really miss the White Birch Restaurant. One of our favorite places. We usually ate there at least twice a week when we were in Sioux Narrows.
5807097,v-bay gord,2017-10-11 09:28:00,3168,It's sad and troubling to hear of so many long standing iconic operations closing their doors in that area. Not sure what the issues are driving that. Back to the original posters question.......just a comment. It sounds like it is a big group wanting an over the weekend type of trip. Not sure how any operation could survive blocking off so many cabins for so few days....particularly over a weekend which basically has the affect of taking away two weeks of business.
5808025,kuledude,2017-10-11 20:03:00,18,I'm new here but I agree....a big group for a short time is a textbook recipe for unprofitability. Why would they go up there for such a short period of time? whatever money the lodge owner would make would be negated by the cost of housecleaning.
5808665,bigwalleye1,2017-10-12 08:01:00,2632,"I'd suppose it depends on the operation. Some only reserve a week at a time, Sunday to Saturday or something. For the operations that allow short reservations, 3 or 4 days at a crack, seems like having every cabin full would be a nice payday. All in your point of view and reservation schedule, I suppose. That said, finding a camp that has virtually every cabin open on any given weekend during the season is going to be tough to find..."
5808689,Obabikon,2017-10-12 08:09:00,2370,"We do it... however, to accept 30 people on housekeeping, it would need to be one of a handful of weeks. (last couple weeks of August or mid/late September). Shortened housekeeping trips put a lot of stress on the staff, for very little profit. Just doing the laundry (sheets and towels) for 30+ people takes an employee nearly the entire day. Another one would need to clean all day too."
5812265,Redline,2017-10-14 09:30:00,73,"Ummm what? It's a 5 day trip. The resorts we've stayed at haven't done any housekeeping besides bringing TP and towels. We stayed at White Birch for 30 years. Pretty sure we didn't put them out of business..... Your comment is actually outrageous as they could easily turn our group away if they wanted, but regardless of economic times, our group was always there renting cabins for 5 days. Also we found a place. We rented all of Shangri-La."
5812281,Redline,2017-10-14 09:31:00,73,"We go up for 5 days. It's a 7hr drive from Minneapolis, even less for those of our group in Northern MN. In 40 years we had 2 resorts. White Birch, which closed due to legal issues with its new owners and the last 2 at Red Indian. Also, in the last 10 years or so, the week we go in June, the town and resorts were nearly empty outside of our group."
5812297,pjshorthorn,2017-10-14 09:59:00,5654,"Read your original post. You never mentioned any length of time for your stay except ""over our weekend"". Geeezzz.... I guess in your world a weekend is a 5 day stay. In my world 5 days is two short of a week. PjShorthorn"
5812353,Obabikon,2017-10-14 11:10:00,2370,A ghost town in June? Yikes... that's not good. That might be a reason why a couple places have shut down. June is an absolute MUST FILL.
5797521,Redline,2017-10-04 20:04:00,73,"To give you a bit of a background, my family has had a Father-Son fishing trip over fathers day weekend for over 40 years. I started going in 1993 when I was 9 and we stayed for over 20 some years at White Birch Lodge. Unfortunately they closed and are still closed. (wish I knew why and what will happen) We moved over to Red Indian 2 years ago and we were informed this week, they are closing. Here is where I need help. We have a group of 25-40 (depending on the year) that brings our own boats and do all our own cooking. We need a place that can hold a group that size, while allowing us to cook and guide ourselves. Does anyone have any recommendations? We've asked Tomahawk in the past, but they haven't had space during our weekend. Any help would be great!"
5798169,LakeoftheWoods_ShangriLaCamp,2017-10-05 09:02:00,1,"Hi there, my wife and I run Shangri-La Camp in Sioux Narrows and would be glad to help out. Please contact me on 807.407.FISH (3474) as soon as possible to get your dates set up. Thanks, Mike Stokes. www.shangrilacamp.ca"
5798177,LOW1,2017-10-05 09:02:00,2828,If they have the space I think Crawfords Camp in SN would work fine for you. You may have trouble finding any place that could serve that big of a group. I'd start calling around and see what your options are. You may need to be flexible on lakes as well.In between difficulties in getting help and some resort property being more valuable for housing/condos than as a resort this trend may continue.Here's a guide to the LOW area with contact info for some of the resorts. http://lakeofthewoods.com/Good Luck.
5798193,srk-low,2017-10-05 09:06:00,78,As I am sure you realize the size of your group will eliminate some of your options. I could be missing somebody and if so I apologize.

Is there anywhere to eat there now in the fall and winter or am I stuck with sandwiches from Gill's? White Birch closing was sad, great place to grab breaky or dinner."
5801953,Redline,2017-10-08 16:43:00,73,I still would like to know exactly what happened to White Birch.
5802817,Moosebunk,2017-10-08 23:08:00,211,"Look into the original... Lake Of The Woods Lodge. Nestor Falls. Friend of mine with experience in the industry recently purchased this lodge. Plenty new work is being done, business is picking up above it's regular seasonal clientele, and it can certainly meet your needs. Tell Pat that Bunk steered ya that way."
