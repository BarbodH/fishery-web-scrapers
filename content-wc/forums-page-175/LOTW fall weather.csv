I was out of Kenora yesterday from 11:30 to 5:00, until about 3:30 it was too rough to really fish the open part of the lake, 3-4 waves very tight together with about every third one coming over the bow. We stuck to sheltered less than optimal areas and caught predictable quality and numbers of fish. Maybe 15 total of which two were over 15""."
