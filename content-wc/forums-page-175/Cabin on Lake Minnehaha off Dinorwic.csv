Does anyone know what the deal is with it? There was a sign that said ""Camp Minnehaha"" or something like that. We both did a Google search and found nothing about it. Just wondering if it's still open or just abandoned. It didn't look to be in that bad of shape. Thanks."

I have tried to use Google earth to find the road that connects it to the 502, but have never tried driving to it."
