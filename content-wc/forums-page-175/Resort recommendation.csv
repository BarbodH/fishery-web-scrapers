I go to Canada every year with my best friend musky fishing. well, this year I finally got my wife and 2 girls to go on their maiden Canadian voyage. I took them to Eagle Lake Sportman's Lodge and had a wonderful time. My wife never picked up a rod and doesn't fish, but still had a nice enjoyable time. My 2 girls loved it! there is something special about sharing the beauty of Canada with folks who have never been there. A couple of the cabins have a nice lake view at ELSL. But, I think a wonderful place to go would be to take her to www.pipestonelodge.com . Art and Jenny are A1 hosts and the cabins sit right on the water on an island with great views. Not to mention that the walleye fishing can be nothing short of outstanding. Not sure about how you feel about being on an island, but it sounds like your wife would love someplace that is secluded. the price is a little bit more than the $700 range you listed, but since she isn't fishing, I'm betting Art would cut you a break and fit your budget. Give them a call, or better yet, go to the All Canada show in Chicago and talk to them in person. PM me if you have any questions"

5827745,kvman1959,2017-10-24 06:13:00,45,Yes that's what she wants when this is all over. Where she can relax look out on a lake and scrapbook to her hearts content. She doesn't fish.
5823849,kvman1959,2017-10-21 06:32:00,45,"Ok, here's the scoop. I cancelled my elk hunt this fall when my wife was diagnosed with cancer. She has chemo until mid January then 5 weeks of radiation. So she's says to me I'll go to Canada with you next year(score!) But there are stipulations, she doesn't fish but scrapbooks like crazy. So I am looking for a place to go with good walleye fishing where the cabins have a lake view for her. Would like to keep it under say $700 a person. Housekeeping cabin with boat package. Any help is appreciated."

5824033,kvman1959,2017-10-21 08:46:00,45,Thanks very much appreciated. She just wants get away somewhere peaceful after everything is done where she can sit and scrapbook and look out a lake.
5824233,Bstar,2017-10-21 11:13:00,564,"Sorry to hear about your wife. My wife went through the same thing three years ago. Surgery, chemo and radiation. She said the radiation was the worst part. Hope everything works out ok.You might want to check out Vermillion Bay Lodge on Eagle Lake. Looks like what your looking for and the owner is a regular contributor on this board. I haven't been there myself but it hits your price point at around $600 US per person. Cabins and boats look great. www.vermilionbaylodge.com Good Luck."
5824257,Obabikon,2017-10-21 11:58:00,2370,I believe Justin at Mylies Place would be your best choice out of Morson on Lake of the Woods.http://www.myliesplaceresort.com
5824273,That Minnesota guy,2017-10-21 12:02:00,8293,"Ok I get the Walleye fishing thing. We all do it and we all love to get the green light from the boss. But, since this was a major event for HER how about sitting her down and saying..............""I think for my trip I wanna take you to a white sand beach instead of fishing."" Maybe she says I wanna go fishing in Canada, but maybe you earn a lifetime of points."
5824537,kvman1959,2017-10-21 16:27:00,45,"Well after 40 years I know my wife. ""The white sand beaches "" aren't her thing. Plus if I even asked she would tell me I'm off my rocker. #1 she won't fly, #2 she doesn't like to travel. She just wants to go somewhere where she can do what she likes and look out on the lake!"
5824729,bigwalleye1,2017-10-21 19:11:00,2632,"While I can offer no recommendations for lodging, I would like to offer my sincerest get well wishes for Mrs. kv. It's a club that is, unfortunately, gaining members. We are 6 years out on my wife's diagnosis, surgeries and chemo, and she's cancer free!! Better times lie ahead, whether it's in Canada, on a white sand beach, or just sitting in the living room at home together. My best wishes for you both."
