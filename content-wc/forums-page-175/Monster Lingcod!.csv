5820009,Shortline,2017-10-18 16:05:00,234,Are the lings a good eating fish? Looks like a great time! Wish I was there with you!
5820401,Brandonkop,2017-10-18 21:10:00,124,Yeah this is actually the Rapala Halibut Rod... have quite a bit of back bone.
5820417,Brandonkop,2017-10-18 21:12:00,124,"Shortline... lingcod is an excellent eating fish. Fresh it is just fabulous. Some people like it the best above halibut as well. Very nice white meat with large flakes and a mild almost sweet flavor. Great eating. I'm guessing you don't live in the Vancouver area, but if so I'm always looking for people to join me when the family wants to take a break."

5811897,Brandonkop,2017-10-13 21:33:00,124,"Catching some Monster Lingcod With the Family using 16 Oz Jigs and a Gibbs Delta double Glow Tail with a piece of salmon for bait. Depth range from 150 to 250 feet of water. Gear was the Penn Warrior reel with 60 pound braid on a Rapala Halibut rod. Biggest ling was 50 inches long and had one massive head on it. Stick around to the end of the video if you want to see the giant! We are fishing small pieces of structure. Pinacles that will rise from 400 - 500 feet and top out at about 150. You can anchor but I find drifting works well to cover the structure and find active fish. What I'll do is drive to the top of the structure and then drift off. You always want to drift from shallow to deeper otherwise you get snagged really bad going from deep to shallow on these pinnacles. Usually the fish hit as you drop the lure anyways, so as you drift off the structure you jut keep letting out line. Jig a couple and drop to bottom again. Works well. When I get out to 300 feet I crank up and repeat. The first one was probably around 20, Second one around 40 and the last one probably in between 50 and 60 pounds. https://youtu.be/YoCzspU4Gtg"

I really am sorry about that... if it's any constellation I still enjoy fishing for walleye too! The tug is the drug. But these fish are power houses.Quote: Originally Posted by FishoilGreat video, thanks for sharing it. It makes me want to get back up to Alaska and chase some ling! A whole other level up there in Alaska I'm sure! Since moving to salt side I'm not sure I could ever move away. I love it!"
5815193,Baseline,2017-10-15 21:42:00,3207,I like your video. I've fished for ling cod on the Gulf of Alaska out of Seward. We used 1lb jigs with super sized white and yellow Mr. Twisters. The charter boat would drift from deep water up the sides of a reef. The lings were quite willing to bite.
5815377,bigwalleye1,2017-10-16 06:06:00,2632,I'd have thought a one pound jig would have needed a lot stiffer rod.... kidding...great fish!!!!!
