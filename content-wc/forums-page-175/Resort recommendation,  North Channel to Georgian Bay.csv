The travel was not bad when in my 40 and 50s. But my wife and I are both in our mid-60s now and travel getting harder every year. Looking for a resort in North Channel area/Georgian bay area(a lot closer to home). Looking for area that we would be mainly fishing for muskie, but would also have access to walleye, smallmouth bass, etc. I need a resort that has either partial or full American Plan. I would be using my own boat. Would possibly use a guide for a day or two to acclimate to the area. Thanks in advance to all. Bob"

I have not been in a few years but it was a comfortable resort and the fishing was decent. We always took our own boats. I would not recommend using thier basic boat. That is a huge body of water and it takes a while to get anywhere in the small boats.
