Is one resort closer to some of the better ""hot spots"" than the other? Were you satisfied with the service/hospitality of the staff/owners? Are the cabins clean(I don't expect ""white glove"" clean, just in good shape without mice running throughout) Were the boats & motors in good shape? And finally, would you go back to either resort if everything was the same as when you were there? Thanks in advance for sharing your opinions. BadgerRed"

Keith, Dan and Family take care of the details, great family atmosphere, encourage letting the big girls go, clean, cabins don't get old, they get rebuilt, nice resort boats if you need, they are around all the time for bait, advice, etc. Been to 3 others in the area, and they were half as good. Get reservations in early, they book fast."
549761,Guest,2005-06-26 18:13:00,0,"Jimmer, what other resorts did you stay at that ""didn't match"" the experience of Fishermen's Cove? I've found out that FC does fill up fast, I called and found out they are booked full for all 3 weeks I inquired about and they give 1st chance for guests to rebook for the following year(seems appropriate) which means I'm on a waiting list hoping someone doesn't rebook or they cancel for 2006. Thanks for your opinion."

This was our first stay up at Gold Pines and we loved it. The owners are great people that will do anything to make sure your having a good time catching fish. Our particular accomodations were a bit rustic, but there are other cabins that have been redone and are quite nice. It is also one of the most affordable resorts on Lac Seul. We caught as many 14-16 inch walleyes as we wanted within 5 miles of camp with several over 20 inches with the biggest 29.5."
550593,Guest,2005-07-21 19:45:00,0,"Pan Man, were the vast majority of walleyes 14""-16"" long or did you get a fair number of bigger ""eyes""? How was the boat traffic when you were up there? Sounds like you enjoyed your trip, are you planning on going back to Gold Pines?"
550598,Guest,2005-07-21 22:04:00,0,"I agree with Pan Man, Gold Pines is unbeatable as far as price and accomodations. some cabins are rustic. I have their newest one, 4 bdrm, 2 bath, screened porch, 156 channel cable, deep freeze in cabin, opening week, 672 eyes in our boat with approx 4 hrs fishing per day, mouth of the river and sawmill is a no brainer. Lots of fish in the 14-16 range, with 25% in the slot, 5-10% 25-29 inch. I've been there for 5 yrs, some yrs better than other, yet there has never been a bad one! couldn't ask for better accomodations or service. Owners are there to please. Good luck, spuds"
