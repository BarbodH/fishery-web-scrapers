550589,IA  DAN,2005-07-21 16:49:00,53,Looks like were going to have to take some warmer clothes this yr as it looks like the highs are going to be around 70.Good Luck and have a safe trip.
550478,Guest,2005-07-19 07:05:00,0,"I just returned last week from LacSeul. Mainly fish the SW end of the lake but did venture into the Altimeter Creek, Broad Lake for fun. The weather was hot, many bays have water temps in high seventys to low eightys as day heats up. We did quite well on walleye, good enough that we Northern fished for a couple of days and caught that limit too. The ironic part about Northern fishing was that we were catching as many walleye on spoons as we were Northern. Don't be afraid to go shallow, I could not believe the number of walleye that were hanging in 5-6 foot of water in the weeds. I notice Nate and Dan you are both from Iowa. Born there myself and make it back for Iowa football games. You guys have a great time. There's no other fishery like LacSeul."
550489,Guest,2005-07-19 09:02:00,0,"Dan and Nate - I just returned from a week at Lac Seul out of the Scout lake area. The weather was hot but so was the fishing. We caught bigger fish this year than in the past. Our group of 6 had over 40 that were 25"" or better. Quantity was great also. Crawlers and minnows, spinners and jigs. Shallow was the key. We caught most of our fish in under 10ft of water near weeds. Caught several northern over 35"" also. White twister tails with a piece of meat were hot also. Only 355 days till next trip but who's counting. I live in the Marshalltown area. Good luck with your trips."
550494,Guest,2005-07-19 12:44:00,0,"Nate W and IADan, I too am from CR and live off Blairs Ferry on the way to Palo. Our group will be at Onaway starting August 12. This will be my fourth trip to Onaway. What a good camp and wonderful lake to fish. Nate, say hello to Blair and Kathy from the Streff Electric bunch. Good luck to both of you. Please post reports when you return."
550501,Guest,2005-07-19 14:29:00,0,"DREYE, From your post, I think you stumbled upon a pattern many veterans to Lac Seul fishing know of, that being that surprisingly large walleyes can be surprisingly shallow in very hot weather. This actually happens more often than most people realize (in my opinion), because the natural thought is the heat will drive them deep. NWO Fishing Bum"
550536,NateW,2005-07-20 09:23:00,96,Well it doesn't look like heat is going to be an issue by the time we get up there. Temps are going to be in the mid-70s when we arrive but by Tuesday a high of 59!?! Sounds like we'd better be packing some sweatshirts! NWO--any expert opinions on how the change in weather will effect fishing?
550554,Guest,2005-07-20 21:43:00,0,"Nate Was up for the annual 2 week trip 6/26-7/9 and experienced all sorts of weather. Water was 61 degrees first week, plenty of rain/wind and chilly. Some days it didn't get above 60 out on the lake. Second week the weather started to break and got VERY warm towards the end of the second week. Final water temp was 73.5 degrees @ small clay banks on Saturday 7/9. Fishing was the best I've ever had for a 2 week trip, had the best 1 day ever and caught my biggest eye ever on this trip. Wish it didn't end. Fri/Sat were slower days due to the heat and lack of wind. Most fish were caught in McKenzie on either spinner rigs or jig. Used mainly minnows and an occasional twister tails. Your favorite color (pink) did do very well. Tried Road runner jigs this trip and will continue to use them. They really produced for me and caught my hog. 31"" @ 12lb. was released and waiting for you! Was a beauty!! Most fish were caught around sand, but then did sit on a couple of spots that were rock and pounded them there as well. Fish were caught in all depths from 5'to 24'. Mainly around 10'-14' was the most productive for both weeks. Did here of some guys hitting them in the weed beds 6-9' and on the inside weed lines. Can't wait till the fall trip to hit it again. After 11+ years of fishing this lake, still cant get enough and it just keeps improving. Knock em dead and have fun Mp3553"
550584,IA  DAN,2005-07-21 16:03:00,53,"Iv'e been looking at Onaway Lodge for some future trips but I notice they dont have a web site.Could you give me a estimate of there cost per person for aweek with and without a lodge boat,just wondering. Thanks Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."
550586,Guest,2005-07-21 16:30:00,0,I go every year and I think it's $620 per person (2) this year with a 17 foot lund / 50 hp honda and 30 galllons gas and a scoop of minnows every day. Cost is like $560 if you bring your own boat. Nice place with great owners. Hard to get into due to 90% return rate. Web page is www.ontariossunsetcountry.ca/onaway Not alot of info but there is a phone number.
550587,IA  DAN,2005-07-21 16:36:00,53,"Thanks for the fast reply,we will be up the road to Lac Seul Lodge in 8 days. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."
550588,Guest,2005-07-21 16:40:00,0,I'm leaving in 8 day also.
550420,IA  DAN,2005-07-17 17:20:00,53,"Come on,wheres all of the post with how the fishing is compared to past yrs..I know they had alot of bad weather this spring and its been hot up there also and the water level is up.What was the HOT Lures this yr.and the Hot Presentations or are they the same from last yr.,I'm getting my fishing gear ready to go as I will be leaving in 12 DAYS.Come on we all drive 750 plus miles so there shouldnt be any secrets.I'll let you all know how and where we caught fish when I get back. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."
550422,Jimmy Jig,2005-07-17 20:25:00,1905,"Yes, its been hot and the water is high. The fishing a week ago was much better than a year ago. The standard is a jig and some kind of live bait. Leeches, crawler or minnow. It varies from day to day or even hour to hour on which one they prefer. we used Northland floating jig, tipped with meat and a slip sinker. The fish were larger for us than other years. Good Luck JT"
550429,IA  DAN,2005-07-18 04:35:00,53,"Thanks Jimmy Jig for the info, Two Tex called me from Ear Falls yesterday and told me they have been slaughtering them.Live bait,white twister tails,shad raps,ratl traps and just about anything you want to throw at them. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."
550430,Guest,2005-07-18 06:37:00,0,"was up at evergreen lodge on the 6,7,8, of mjuly and did fantastic, jigs and minnows, 7 to 15 feet of water was our best depth, color did not make a differnce for our group, biggest wlleye was 27 in. had a great trip, good luck and have a great trip rick"
550434,sirchad,2005-07-18 09:08:00,8,"Fished out of Goose Bay Camp July 9-13 and had fantastic luck. The first day wasn't as good as the rest, I think we were fishing too deep. After day one, fished in 6'-13' with spinners and crawlers being best, and minnows a close second. Quite a few fish also caught jigging with paddle tail grubs. No real big fish, but for the 4 days, had about 30 fish over the slot with 26"" the biggest. Ate a lot of fish and brought a limit back. All the fish we kept were between 16.5"" and 17.5."" For us, the bite seemed to die off earlier each day, probably due to the heat. If it's hot, get out early and off the lake early."
550446,NateW,2005-07-18 12:15:00,96,"I'm leaving on Friday so I suppose by the time I get back you will have already gone. I have been a little surprised at the lack of any new information so I just have to assume that no news means nothing has changed. What worked before will work again, where there were is where they are.... It doesn't matter, I could get unanimous tips on this year's ""hot"" bait and by the time I get up there it will switch to something completely odd and something I only have 1 of. The fish are in ca-hoots with the tackle manufacturers. Dan, what part of IA are you from. CR-area here. Four days and counting....."
550447,Hump,2005-07-18 12:59:00,578,We were up for the first time the last week of June and fished out of Evergreen. It seemed to me that the walleyes slept in and didn't start biting until 9:30-10:00 in the a.m. Is that normal? Used to being on the water by at least 7:00
550450,IA  DAN,2005-07-18 14:59:00,53,"Nate W, Our group of 6 are from CR.area.I live in CR off Blairsferry RD. We stay at BlackBay Outpost ran by Lac Seul Lodge.We travel 30 miles by water to get to our home for a week.I'm sure you have some Ratl Traps in these colors(crawdad,firetiger or perch and chrome-blue and red on the bottom)1/4oz and 1/2oz.11 more days for me,where do you stay.Good Luck Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."
550454,NateW,2005-07-18 16:10:00,96,"Geez Dan, from the sounds of it I could cast a Ratl Trap through your front window from my office! I work just off Blairsferry about a block N of North Country Steak House. We stay at Onaway Lodge which is on Scout Bay straight across from MacKenzie. We usually go the first week in July but this is the only time we could make it happen this year. So I'm a little concerned about fishing in much different conditoins that what we've had in the past, but we'll adjust and be fine. Have plenty of Ratl Traps, Shad Raps, Wally Diver's, Fuzzy Grubs rigs, jigs and spinners--about everything I can think of. Now I just have to pass the time between now and Friday!"
550455,IA  DAN,2005-07-18 16:51:00,53,Nate this will be my 6th yr going up to walleye world.Iv'e been told that the northerns are also back to there old stomping grounds since the Lake level is back up.Were just up the road from you as far as where we put in(Rat Bay).We all work at Quaker Oats.Small world huh. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH.
