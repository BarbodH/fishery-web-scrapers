Stayed at McKenzie Lake Inn (1-888-991-7499 or 807-583-2800) - nice. Got bait from Eagle Beak Baits (807-583-2344) - highly recommend. There was a small general store, but we always got our food, etc. in Thunder Bay on the way up."

Various outfitters have cabins for their guests, but those get booked very quickly. Mckenzie is a great place. Clean, quiet, and comfortable. Good people running it."
