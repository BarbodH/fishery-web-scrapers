550528,Guest,2005-07-20 05:19:00,0,Is it possible to buy half a Flat at Four Seasons in Ear Falls? My local bait shop will not sell me half of a Flat. How many leeches in a pound? I know it will very I am just looking for a ballpark figure. IA JOE
550529,Guest,2005-07-20 06:34:00,0,"If you are buying a half flat, then you must not be confident that you will be catching hundreds of walleyes on your trip. The walleye will sense this fear and you will therefor not catch many fish. Buy the full flat and fish with confidence. Or you could call Four Seasons at 807-222-2200"
550548,Guest,2005-07-20 17:19:00,0,"I had planned to use alot of soft 3"" plastic twistertails and gulp baits once I found active fish. I was going to use leeches, crawlers, minnows on spinners and crankbaits behind bottom bouncers to locate those active fish. Is this a bad plan? I heard gulp will fish just as good as live bait and it will last longer. IA JOE"
550550,Guest,2005-07-20 18:22:00,0,nothing fishes as good as live bait.
550566,NateW,2005-07-21 07:49:00,96,"It's funny how one group will come to one conclusion while another group will come to the complete opposite. In year''s past we have seen no noticeable difference when we switch from live bait to plastic. The only exceptions being plastics don't seem to get bit off by perch and one twister tail will catch many fish before it has to be replaced--can't say that about a minnow. But that is what works for us. I'm not going to say my way is the only way, I'm just going to present another option/opinion. IA Joe, the bulk of our walleyes on Lac Seul are caught pulling spinner rigs with 3"" or 4"" twister tails. Believe it or not we've had better luck with plain tails than with scented or flavor-impregnated (Gulp, Powerbait, etc.). If the fish are in the weeds, replace the bottom bouncer with a couple bass fishing bullett weights, change the hooks on your spinner so you can sink the barb back into the plastic (Like a Texas rig) and yank them out of the weed beds. Good Luck!"
550590,Guest,2005-07-21 17:56:00,0,"NateW, Thanks for the support. I have some 4"" firetail plastic worms that I plan to rig texas style and try in the weeds. I am going to try shallow running crankbaits just above or in the weed tops most likely with a steel leader! You commented on perch taking bait. what is a good sized perch on the NW end of Lac Seul? Perch would make a good shore lunch. Like most first timers I will take a huge amount of tackle and actualy use only a small portion of it. IA JOE"
550604,bailey,2005-07-22 05:54:00,22,"We just got back from west arm of Eagle Lake. Brought a flat of night crawlers up with us that we purchased in Iowa. We bought leeches at Bobby's corner. The leeches were small and after I bought them, I was not real happy with the quality. They were around $33 a pound, if I remember. No jumbos available, I was told. I had put my name on a list the previous year and had been in email contact with Bobbys Corner to get jumbos when we came up this year but they said there was only one lake where they get their jumbos and for some reason, there werent any available. We had to buy another flat of crawlers while we were up there- there was a big difference in the quality compared to what we brought up with us. The new crawlers we bought were very small and limp and pulled apart easily, like they were old or something. Bottom line, though, is that the eyes were biting on even the limp ones so I guess it didn't matter in the end. I would like a source for Jumbo leeches near Dryden or north if anyone has one."
550461,IA JOE,2005-07-18 19:48:00,35,I just setup a trip for late August near Ear Falls on Lac Seul. My local Baitshop is selling crawlers for $50 a flat(500 crawlers). What is the cost of crawlers at Ear Falls? Is it illegal for me to trap leeches from Lac Seul? I have been reading the posted questions and comments for the last two weeks. Years of chat and endless on the water hours of help. Just 40 more days and I will see Lac Seul for the first time! Thank You all very much. IA JOE
550474,Guest,2005-07-19 05:27:00,0,A non-resident cannot legally trap leeches or minnows in NWO. It'll be in the fishing regulation pamplet you should get with your license.
550480,Gary_IA,2005-07-19 07:33:00,144,Isn't there a requirement be in a bedding that is soil free and that you can proove that you have had them for 14 days? I seem to recall discussions last year about the 14 day requirement. Is that by the wayside or have they stopped enforcing it?
550481,stumcfar,2005-07-19 07:40:00,451,"Crawlers for sure can not be in dirt. I brought a flat up 2 weeks ago that I had purchased that same morning, nobody asked when I had purchased them."
550485,bigfish1965,2005-07-19 08:17:00,3210,I can get flats for around $35 so you may want to see if you can find a bait dealer up there for a flat instead.Obviously you would need to find this out beforehand.
550490,Guest,2005-07-19 10:01:00,0,"Cost of a flat of 500 crawlers in Ear Falls is running $64 US including tax. Cost of a pound of leaches is $25.50 US including tax. Just got off the phone, so these figures are accurate."
550513,Guest,2005-07-19 18:55:00,0,you may want to stop off at Bobbys Corner in Vermilion Bay.......I believe the cost of a flat of worms is around $60 Canadian
550518,Guest,2005-07-19 19:57:00,0,a flat in central illinois is $35
550520,Guest,2005-07-19 20:00:00,0,Is Bobby's Corner that place on the northwest corner of Highway 17 and 105?
550527,Guest,2005-07-20 04:19:00,0,"No, Bobby's is a about a 1/4 mile west on the south side. It's in the gas staion that used to be owned by Clarks. I guess the ""corners"" part of it is because theres an intersection there too, but I don't remember the hwy number."
