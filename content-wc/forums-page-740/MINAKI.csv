550624,Guest,2005-07-22 12:04:00,0,"I needed some walleye for a large fish fry here. I putchased it from a local fisheries located in Kenora. $8 a lb. It's located just eat of the city jail about one mile or so. They were perfect size I might add. Anyway. While their, I talked with the person and he told me all the fish they were getting came from LOTW. Not the river. There were fresh too, just brough in that morning. I must say too, it looked like a considerable amount came in that morning. There was also a great number of northern pike in their frig also, and I personally know of no market for that. I would like to know what they do with it if it cannot be sold. Like I am talking about pike that were nice size, and that I always fished for on LOTW and I used them for shorelunches at the time. If anyone knows anything about pike, once those Y bones are removed ( and that IS very easy) you have a great fish dinner. None of my guests ever complained either as they knew what they were getting. I cannot figure this out actually. Many years ago, they the MNR, bought out all the commercial permits (nor nearly all) stopped commercial right then and their. NOW, they open it again but only for the natives. I hear nets are showing up in various areas of LOT w that they have not been seen before. Way down the lake. But so I hear, they do have quotas. IF anyone can fine out. Find out this.... 1-how many nets are permitted on LOTW. 2-What are the quotes per net? 3-They sell it to this local fisheries, but what happens to the pike not sold. I find that a great waste. 4-Who monitors all of this?? This is NOT by the way sustanance fishing. It is for commercial purposes. None of the walley apparently are off the river, but I know there are sustanance nets on the river, but the various reservations. Just because the numbers went up when the commercial was closed does not mean it should be opened again. It is also in my estimation, descrimination if only the natives have the right to fish commercially. They scream at times about descrimination, but now WE can. The way I see thing is simple. If this commercial remains (and it will) the numbers will drop again, only this time, the numbers of pike (another sportfish) will drop at the same time. These fish they are netting are prime spawners. Ontario468"
550629,Redtail5998,2005-07-22 13:49:00,34,"Does anybody have any info. on the Minaki Classic tourney, from Paradise Cove. Did they get enough teams to fish it and if so did they have much luck compared to the past??"
550631,IaCraig,2005-07-22 14:35:00,434,"Good info, you obviously know much more about commercial fishing and netting than I do so sorry I can't answer any of your LOTW netting questions. I'll be anxious to post our Minaki results (good, or bad) when we get back in a week or so. By my reckoning, mathematically our walleye action should be great. Because.... if Average fishing = (good fishing results + bad fishing results) / the number of fishing results. And So far most the 2005 Minaki walleye results have been poor, the odds are we will have great walleye week so together our reports = average fishing. ;) Just kidding. To be 100% honest I'm simply praying for a safe trip with average or better weather and no major mechanical difficulties. If God grants me those things, I will have a great week. Later IaCraig"
550636,Guest,2005-07-22 16:30:00,0,"My Last Year, I guess to you it's alright to catch fish on Minaki if you spend several hundred dollars per night but not OK if you can get a good price on a room? What a joke!!!"
550639,Guest,2005-07-22 16:59:00,0,"Yeah right, sustenance nets! They use the same colored nets for commercial and sustenance, they aren't marked any differently, there is no enforced quota, I think you can figure the rest out from here..."
550644,Guest,2005-07-22 21:44:00,0,"Quota or no quota, its sustenance, not commercial. There is no commercial netting on that part of the Winnipeg anymore. If you actually think that the sustenance nets take out more than the fisherman, think again. Take PC's 83 cabins and multiply that by the number of guests and then the number of days fished, that's a #### of a lot more fish than any net could take. ####, that's only one resort! 2 groups are at fault for the poor fishing. PC for raping the resource to make a quick buck and the MNR for not limiting the number of cabins he built. #### shame."
550650,Guest,2005-07-23 12:22:00,0,"I have often wondered why since the fishery (on any lake or river) is a finite but renewable stock (if properly managed) that the commercial interests ......I speak mainly of the fishing lodges..have basically no controls placed on them as to size. It seems kind of a ""wild west"" attitude in that many camps seem to grow exponentially with little apparent concern on impacts this may have. On many lakes operators have now taken to staying open in the winter to further add to the harvest. Seems that the MNR only steps in once a problem (ie imminent collapse of a fishery) is identified. An exception may be on Lake St Joseph where only a limited # of fishing licences can be sold by the one or two camps on the lake.........would seem to a possible solution. It would at least give more value to what we now basically give away. Ben"
550651,Guest,2005-07-23 12:40:00,0,Agreed. You can see the same thing coming with deer hunting in NWO. Ontario MNR puts no value on the resources until its too late.
550661,Guest,2005-07-24 10:24:00,0,"I totally object to sustance nets. In this day and age, I see no reason for it. The Treaties (all of them) should be scrapped, and re-done or removed completely to bring things in line with ""todays"" day and age. We can no longer just go out and take whatever we want to because ""treaties"" written in the stone age say so. Hey, look at the fishing for cod. The world screwed that up, and it can happen anywhere as we know. Greed definately, and the all mighty dollar, plus just plain stupidity. I also agree that with 83 cabins that is a pile of limits to try and fill. The MNR should have capped lodges/resorts in size years ago, but that did not happen. I was of the impressesion something was in place ""once"". Cannot remember now. However, I have found from personal exp. that these large resorts do not offer good service anyway. Too impersonal. I would prefer a small operation where at least they can remember my name, not just by a cabin number. LOTW and the River as I see it will be in dire straights in 20 years or less. There is now two new org. starting. One to look into the water quality of LOTW (which will also take in the River) and another to look into nets, and the co-existance with anglers and resorts. If there was NOT already a problem, there would be NO reason to even consider such organizations. One only has to look at the rules put in place for water quality for the commercial business's. New filter systems. Heck, if the quality of the water Was good"" there would be no reason for such action. LOTW in my estimation has way too many cabins being built in various areas. This will errode the shorlines, and with these new all season cabins, they bring with them at least two boats and motors. Septic systems, fishing, snowmowiling etc. etc. Tourists, both American and Canadian do not want to fish around people docks. Anglers do not want to get crowded off a reef either by inconsiderate fisherman/guides/anglers from other resorts. It has all become $$$ and Cents. Build more and bigger. Too bad it is only screwing everything up for LOTW and the River. In the future, the only places to go where one can have good fishing, solitude, and a good time, will be Fly Ins. Which they too will see and end as roads get built into those areas too. An endless circle. Ontario568"

550572,Redtail5998,2005-07-21 10:54:00,34,I am wondering if anybody that has been to Minaki this year has had what they consider to be a good fishing trip. That would be being able to find enough slot fish for a shorelunch plus a reasonable amount of larger fish. We were there in June and about 15 slot fish for 7 guys for 6 days fishing was all we could find. Would like to return this fall if fishing has been any better for others. Would appreciate any info or insight that anybody might be willing to offer.:(
550574,Guest,2005-07-21 11:29:00,0,redtail....wish I had better news but been there twice this year...the legal slot fish aren't easy to come by. Some members of my family are up there almost all summer and have been catching a fair number of eyes over the legal slot size. The smallmouth and Musky fishing has been great this year.
550575,Reels,2005-07-21 12:01:00,2876,"Well, after almost 20 years, we changed our second trip plans. Most likely I will go to Erie or Devils lake for my summer/fall vacation. It will take a little time for Minaki to recover. <{{}}><"
550582,Guest,2005-07-21 15:34:00,0,"The smalmouth fishing was great in late May - early June. We caught enough walleye and sauger (with some perch thrown in) for the entire group shore lunch of 11, plus some guides, We usually only do one per week for the entire group. The individually guided boats caught enough for shorelunch each day when they wanted a shore lunch, I believe. I have had enough shore lunches, that I do not do them much anymore. 3 of us go back each year in Septmeber to Minaki, but this year we will try out the Detroit River, Michigan, and adjoining lakes. This is not because of poor Minaki fishing, but just want to check out another area and the Lodge was full at the time we initally wanted to go back to Minaki. We have reservations at Minaki late May next year. Hopefully the wife will come. Don"
550599,Guest,2005-07-21 22:20:00,0,"Seems pretty bad to me when you see a ""Walleye Fillets For Sale"" sign attached to the Paradise Cove sign. Too bad they exploited a resource just to make a quick buck. You won't catch me again in Minaki.....No longer a real canadian experience."
550607,Guest,2005-07-22 07:25:00,0,"Those ""fish for sale"" were bought commercially to sell to those fisherman who wanted more fish to eat than the limits on the Winnipeg River system allow."
550608,Guest,2005-07-22 07:30:00,0,"Commercial, as in netted by Indians on the Winnipeg River and LOTW, part of the problem IMHO. Maybe if you want good fishing, stop eating so many walleye, it all comes from the same place!"
550610,Guest,2005-07-22 07:57:00,0,"The problem is not commercial. The problem is someone who has not put a value on the resource, just pack as many people in for $35 a night. That's where the real raping of the resource is."
550620,Guest,2005-07-22 11:00:00,0,I agree.
550621,Guest,2005-07-22 11:01:00,0,Do you know that for a fact? I was told that the only commercial fishing liscense on the Winnipeg River system north of LOTW was not renewed for 2005 by the provence.
