550596,Pooch,2005-07-21 21:08:00,4619,"IMO they scatter more than usual. What drew them to be in a particular spot at normal pool has now changed. They will have followed forage to a new location that is probably similer to the one they vacated. Just have to be flexible and hunt for them as they are probably moving a lot looking for a meal too! Two weeks ago, north of Red Lake the water was about 18 inches above normal and fish were not where they usually are or even close by. Spinner rigs were ignored while jigs were a big hit with the walleye. Normally spinners will put more pounds of fish in the boat than jigs. NOT on that trip. Pooch"
550603,Trailerguy,2005-07-22 05:02:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I don't think high water degrades fishing, it just changes the spots they are in. If the baitfish are hanging around on a rocky point in 6' of water normally. In high water they likely have moved to another rocky spot or weeds growing closer to the shoreline. The walleyes follow the baitfish, so you have to fish new spots. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
550605,Guest,2005-07-22 07:04:00,0,"We returned 2 weeks ago from North Eastern LOTW and we thought fishing was great. Walleye fishing was the best ever. Muskies were just getting going good with the warmer water temps. We caught 3 and we only spent about 2 hours a day over the 6 days fishing for them. Smallmouth fishing was a little slower but once we figured some things out we caught a nice amount of them. Pike fishing was good on the cooler overcast days but anytime the sun shined or was hot they tended to slack off. We managed 2 over 36 inches. Changing your presentation, location, is key. Don't spend the whole time doing the same things. We went to areas we had never been to and we have been going to this lake for 10 years! I would say we learned more on this trip then we had over the past 5 combined."
550606,Guest,2005-07-22 07:24:00,0,I've noticed just the opposite....I would much rather fish rising and high water than low or falling water.
550627,Atlanta Dave,2005-07-22 12:48:00,323,Our 2 wk trip to Athabasca was the worst Pike fishing we have had in the 6 years we have been going there. I contribute this to the extremly high water we had this year. Atlanta Dave
550628,Guest,2005-07-22 13:44:00,0,"There are great fishing spots for low water And for high water. Don't fish like a hick and try your good old spot cause it worked 15 years ago. Read the water level, the weather, water temperature, wind and pick your spots accordingly when you observe all these factors. I guided for many years and always preferred high water for pike fishing. Think about what the conditions were like in good years previous and find new bays and water that match those conditions even with the high water. D"

550667,phishfearme,2005-07-24 16:05:00,1242,"thanks for all the replys - i kinda thought it would be a mixed bag. i shoulda given more details. we go to a different lake every year (there's no ""old spots that worked 15 years ago"") and we typically select ""river lakes"" ie, lake that are sometime just widening of rivers or are at least fed by a major river or two. clearly these lakes go up and down MUCH more than a lake like LOTW. and, yes, we tried numerous ""non-typical"" locations but it was tough fishing everywhere. we consider a ""typical"" location as one where there's rocks/boulders with clear flow in 5-12 feet of water. fishing was tough even there but we did get a few just no where near the numbers and size expected. this isn't the first time we have it tough in high water - it could be the lake also - but our experience is just the opposite in lower water. anyways, thanks for the feedback and additional thoughts would be welcome. phish"
