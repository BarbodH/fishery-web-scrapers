Gail, Steve and the staff put on their regular, outstanding service. We ate way too much food, which was great. The muskie fishing was the best we've had, so all in all, it was a great time. We probably crossed paths in camp and didn't realize it. Take care."

I have tried many others and for the most part had nice times, but this place is far and away the best for Service and comfort. The fishing aint bad either!"
