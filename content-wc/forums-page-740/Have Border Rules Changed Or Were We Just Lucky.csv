After all of the usual questions we both declared having 4 cases of beer in each truck. We were expecting to pay duty on the extra cases of beer but were each waved on through. Have the limits on beer changed or did we just get lucky?

550635,IaDave,2005-07-22 16:09:00,476,We have had that happen to us before if we were 1 or 2 cases over. I guess it depends which customs guy you get and they probably appreciate the honesty.
