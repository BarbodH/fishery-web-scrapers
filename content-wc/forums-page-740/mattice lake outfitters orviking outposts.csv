I doubt if I will ever use another outfitter. Best time of year to go is whenever you can get there :-) I go the last week of June now, but in the past I went in mid-July. Good fishing both times. Early June is probably the best time to go for fish that are concentrated in certain areas. If I could pick my favorite times to go it would be the second week of June and the first week of September. Good luck and let us know who you pick."
