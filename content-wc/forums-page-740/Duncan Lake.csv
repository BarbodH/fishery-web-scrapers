It is a decent lake - better than in the past with the size limits. Haven't been there in 3 years - but spent the previous 18 yrs up there for 1-2 weeks. rather remote - not a lot of cabins or drive ins - not a lot of pressure. I got a 9 lber out of it several years ago. Guy that owns the camp I stay at does well, I always catch enough - but never big numbers. They are there - but I'm a bass man not a great walleye fisher - not a lot local so only experience is up north. Last time I was there I had a couple of windy days where I had 15-20 in a row on tubes (was actually trying a spot for bass) in 18' of water - 20mph wind. Bass were just starting to show in the last 4-5 years - Good perch an good size - decent pike - with some big ones. 20 mile long - not real wide - always a place to get away from anone.
