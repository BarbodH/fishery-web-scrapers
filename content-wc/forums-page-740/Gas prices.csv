This is a little like standing outside a roller coaster and saying, ""...wait in line for 30 minutes just to go in one big circle..."" It's what goes between between point ""A"" and point ""B"" that makes it all worth while. If the only vaule you place on your trip is figured via price-per-pound, then I really feel sorry for you."
