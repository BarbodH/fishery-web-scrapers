I've been going to Witch Bay Camp on the NE side of the lake in Ontario for the last 5 years and really like it. The boats and equipment are top notch, the food and accomodations are nice, and the service is outstanding. I have no doubt they would be able to put you on walleye in Sept."
550339,Guest,2005-07-14 08:26:00,0,I was looking at maybe northwest angle area or the rainy river area. any input on those areas in sept.

Howdy, we go up every year (last week in Jul) and stay and the NW Angle Resort. Excellent location on the inlet, good bar & resturant. Fishing should also be excellent at that time of year. Steve"
550355,Guest,2005-07-14 16:20:00,0,For your info walleye fishing is great out of Morson on Lake of the Woods right now. Muskie fishermen keep walking into the office and tell me they keep catching big walleyes in shallow water on their muskie baits - 6 to 8 pounders. Weather's hot and the water surface temp is over 80.

Any information / thoughts / suggestions on depth range (15'-25') and location (long tapering rocky points, mid-lake islands and reefs, the deep water rock to silt /mud transition)? Leeches or crawlers? Spinner rigs or crankbaits? Any recent info on the fishing in the area? thanks."
