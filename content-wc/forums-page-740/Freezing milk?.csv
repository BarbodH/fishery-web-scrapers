550541,phishfearme,2005-07-20 14:06:00,1242,pooch - you can get milk in canada in one liter plastic bags that'll freeze up nice and you can thaw them out as you need them. we've been doing this for some time although a 4 liter jug bought fresh will keep pretty well if you manage your fridge door opening times. - phish

In the winter the cold milk was put on a truck and hauled around the route before going to the creamery. Sometimes the milk would freeze 1/2 the way through the can, they just thawed it out, no problem."
550552,Guest,2005-07-20 20:17:00,0,"We have frozen milk in hopes of keeping it longer. One hint is to make sure you don't freeze ALL of it- you will want to drink some the first couple days. It needs to TOTALLY thaw or you end up with real watery milk first then really rich milk. Have a great time, we leave next Friday!"
550564,Bill Krejca,2005-07-21 07:37:00,6107,"On most of my trips north, I freeze one or two jugs of milk to take up. The milk serves as ""ice"" for the other food items in the cooler. Depending on length of trip and cooler used, the milk is ready to be used the day after arrival, or thereabouts. Before freezing, I usually pour out a half cup or so, so that the freezing expansion doesn't burst the jug - nothing worse than ""Spilt milk"". Before using the milk, I like to shake the jug a little to get it stirred up, otherwise, sometimes it tastes little flat. Good luck,"
550565,515,2005-07-21 07:39:00,254,We freeze our milk and use it in the coolers instead of ice to keep things cool on the trip. It thaws and tastes fine after freezing. Mike
