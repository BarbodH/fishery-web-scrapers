554177,KSauers,2006-01-27 21:14:00,385,Yes I would but the drunkard always gets outfished so he's not going this year.
554181,Guest,2006-01-28 09:09:00,0,"The drunkard wins money fishing off the pier.... If it wasn't for the drunkard,,,,,, the fool wouldn't know where Minaki is.."
554363,Guest,2006-02-05 12:28:00,0,If you are going to stay at a drive in near town make sure when your daughter doesn't want to fish anymore and you insist on runnin and gunnin that she wears a two piece while she sun bathes on the pier..
554364,woods,2006-02-05 13:11:00,646,"I don't know if I like that idea or not. Some of the guys in our group are getting older, and I think we are lucky that gal in the orange bikini at the gas stop near Paradise Cove 2 didn't fill our boats last year. One the the guys almost had a heart attack two years ago!"
554368,KSauers,2006-02-05 17:53:00,385,Ask the drunkard about the blonde at Minaki Marina.

554423,Guest,2006-02-07 14:10:00,0,Barbers would be a great idea I think they have a hot tub.. With your out going personality and people skills you could interface with fellow muskie fisherman.. and share vital information relative to muskie hunting and lure collecting... Maybe you could conduct a SUN DROP tasting contest...
553812,KSauers,2006-01-16 20:36:00,385,I'd like to find a small cabin to rent in Minaki for just me and my daughter in late July. I mostly fish muskies with some walleye thrown in.

553885,Guest,2006-01-18 07:36:00,0,"Here's where we go the last week of June thru the 1st week of July:http://www.sunsetpointminaki.com/index.htm The owner is a big musky fisherman himself, the boathouse is loaded with tons of pictures and stuff from the August Tournement they have in Minaki. The Trapline cabin looks open for part of the month, check out ""Availability"" on the left side of the page. It's about 3 miles by boat from the ramp to the resort. We've been going there for 20+ years now. Chuck"
