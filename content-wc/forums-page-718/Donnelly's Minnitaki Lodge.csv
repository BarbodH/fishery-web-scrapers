554457,Guest,2006-02-08 12:30:00,0,"Try Pickerel Arm Camp. It's about a half mile before you get to Donnelly's. It's a much nicer camp with alot more ammenities. Cabins are twice as nice. (most of them are new)Gas and bait right on the dock. Electrical outlets every 20' or so for battery chargers. Fishing is always fantastic on Minnitaki. Try Redpine Bay for good walleye and Pike action. Any rocky point is good for smallmouth. Southwest Bay is always good fishing and secluded. Redpine can get crowded sometimes. I've always stayed for 2 weeks, hit Redpine on Saturday after the first week. Nobody there. Everyone is either leaving or checking in.It's a great lake, enjoy. Bo"

554516,DanL,2006-02-09 21:39:00,262,I have been to Donnellys the last 6 years in August. We like the resort and the owners. I think the cabins are nice also . Their gas pump is by the lodge office and not on the water. They have gas containers that you bring up empty. Then they fill them and bring them down. They also have leeches and minnows at the lodge. Their docking is also very good and protected from the wind. The fishing the last 2 years has been a little slow for us. However the 4-5 years before that has been excellent. There is good walleye fishing right out front of the lodge. Also their is a big reef as you go through the cutthrough to the big lake that alot of people fish. Red pine is popular as well but a long ways away. I like to fish where others don't. There are plenty of islands that hold walleyes on Minnitaki. As far as pike look for weedy bays and rocky points. Southwest Bay is best for big pike. If you want you can E-Mail me for more info.
