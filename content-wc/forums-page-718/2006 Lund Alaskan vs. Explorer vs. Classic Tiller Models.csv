I will be mounting a F75 Yamaha four-stroke tiller on it. Primary use is 14 days per year in Ontario and 20 days per year on Wisconsin rivers and inland lakes. Thanks, Pfg1"

If you are looking for a big water boat the Explorer is the better boat. If you don't need a boat that has a 91.5 inch beam then the Classic 1775 (85"" Beam) is a awesome boat. The Classic will probably get slightly more speed out of that motor also since its 200lbs lighter. Its nice to have 3 choices like this to make."
