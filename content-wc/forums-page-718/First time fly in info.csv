554370,Guest,2006-02-05 23:06:00,0,I follow a simple formula. Yake half as many clothes and twice as much money.
554403,Guest,2006-02-06 20:41:00,0,"Following is the information I put together for a presentation to my fishing club on packing for a fly-in. Hope it's helpful. Lunk Each person's baggage weight is usually limited on fly-ins  therefore each person has to give up x lbs of weight to the group's quartermaster for food allocation Plan on having steaks for your first or second meal  they will of course be well frozen  anything else that can be should be well frozen - you will be transporting your perishables from home to the take-off point in standard, hard-body Coleman/Igloo/etc coolers  just moments before weighing gear and takeoff, transfer your perishables to styrofoam coolers (much much lighter), using the steaks and other frozen items (bacon and/or sausage for breakfast) as your ice  duct tape the coolers closed  burn the coolers (as opposed to dragging them back home) after you arrive in camp and transfer your goods to the refrigerator  the frozen items will last plenty long for this As part of menu planning, spend some time wandering through a grocery store, looking at items very carefully to see what you can adapt for purposes of lightweight menu planning  also don't be afraid to try some of the dishes at home before making final menu decisions Think in terms of powdered drink mixes (iced tea, sugarless Kool-aid, powdered Crystal Light, etc)  unfortunately I have not yet located a powdered bottle of beer or martini  instant potatoes can be used both for a side dish as well as fish breading  look at self contained dried noodle/rice dishes  take along a bag or two of frozen vegetables (chopped broccoli, corn, etc) and add a cup or two to the noodle/rice dishes to both bulk them out and add some variety Transfer everything possible (even canned goods such as baked beans, etc) to ziploc bags to 1) increase convenience, and 2) eliminate weight  obviously, you'll now have to keep these perishable items in the cooler Pre-measure your menu items out in ziplocs before leaving home and write the directions directly on the ziploc with a magic marker  for example, pre-measure a meal's worth of pancake batter into a ziploc and write the directions on the plastic bag (ex: add one cup water and two eggs)  the time spent at home is worth time saved in camp Same thing for dessert  for example, empty large box (or two) of pudding into ziploc  pre-determine and add the corresponding amount of instant milk so all you have to do is add water  and again, write directions on the bag Also bring along a bag of chocolate chips and perhaps walnuts or raisins and add a handful to each batch of pudding or pancakes to zip it up a bit Consider taking a fish grill if nothing similar is provided in camp  it's very economical in price, lightweight and takes up little room  allows you to bake or grill fish rather than taking the extra weight of oil and breading for fried fish  then just leave it in camp when you're done rather than dragging it home again Don't forget a small but broad supply of spices  salt, lemon pepper instead of plain pepper, crushed red chili peppers or hot sauce if anyone likes a bit of zip, a bit of dill, etc DO consider that small something special if your weight allocation will stand it  perhaps a bottle of wine (and a corkscrew in your pants pocket) for that steak dinner and a small bottle of REAL maple syrup instead of Mrs Butterworth's for your flapjacks those little creative treats can be very special as the wolves are howling in the distance Think very very seriously about fruit  in the past, our guys said they wanted it but then most went unused  and it weighs a LOT in a relative sense  we finally decided if anyone wants fruit, they bring it on their own as part of their own weight allocation, rather than against the group's food allocation  yes, fruit's good for you but a bottle of vitamins weighs a whole lot less if you're not going to eat the fruit. Otherwise think about dried fruit. BIG TIP - If you're not already using them, look very seriously at zip-off pants  they are SUPER for this type of application  zip off the legs and convert them into shorts for warm days  you only need two pair for the entire week Consider the layering concept when packing your clothes  and pack very very judiciously  sacrifice a third shirt for a pair of long underwear bottoms which you might need, etc - you really will be surprised how long you can wear a pair of socks or underwear or a shirt when you need to consider weight limits  and in worst case scenario, you can always rinse out a few things, wearing the long underwear while your pants are drying  after all, who's going to see you, except for the bush pilots flying wayyy overhead? If you think you'll be needing an anchor, just take a length of ¼ rope (30'-40') and a cheapo replacement nylon landing net bag  just fill the bag with rocks and tie closed with one end of the rope Share the weight responsibilities for items everyone will be or might be using  think sharing rather than individual use  first aid kit, bug dope, pliers, etc  how many tubes of toothpaste or bottles of shampoo do you really need?  sounds small, but in the long run, it all adds up, especially in your case when you're trying to figure out how to get three more muskie-sized crankbaits packed into your limited weight allocation For liquor, can you be satisfied with a bottle of booze rather than a case of beer?  the bottle will weigh much less than a case  I pre-mix a bottle of Manhattans and just take the single bottle for the week Eliminate the weight of the tube you might transport rods in  split your rods into two separate groups  place each half of the rods opposite each other, tips to handle and vice versa, making sure the handles stick out slightly further than the length of the tips (in other words, the handles extend a bit further so the tips are protected and won't break off  tightly wrap newspaper around each end of the package and tape tightly with duct tape (lining with newspaper first prevents the duct tape from sticking and stripping off cork from the handles when removed)  this creates a fairly protected and sturdy package of fishing rods that won't need the extra weight of a tube to protect them  then just exercise a bit of care when placing them into the plane Also, JUST IN CASE you end up over your weight allocation and intend to reduce baggage rather than pay for your overage, HAVE IN MIND the order in which you intend to reduce your gear rather than waste time prior to takeoff humming and ho-ing, trying to decide about what am I going to leave behind?"
554414,Guest,2006-02-07 10:47:00,0,Why in the world would you need to burn the styrofoam coolers rather than simply packing gear in them when you fly back out?
554416,jigman 2003,2006-02-07 11:27:00,981,"Instead of burning the styrofoam coolers (thereby letting a lot of CFC's into the atmosphere) why not pack your frozen goods into cardboard boxes. That way when you burn them you aren't polluting (at least not as much). Unless you are flying a long way, the frozen goods will stay frozen without being in a cooler. I have found that one BIG cooler or two smaller ones can be taken in with your cold items without being over on weight. Just don't be flying ice in."
554430,Guest,2006-02-07 17:55:00,0,"my thinking about burning the styrofoam accordingly. I usually AM a tree hugger in those respects. However, I don't know what I would pack OUT in them that didn't already have a container to live in on the way IN. I don't recall much opportunity for shopping while at a fly-in destination. Juuuuust a little humor there.....don't start flinging flames.... :-) I like the idea of the cardboard boxes.....and perhaps wrapping the actual frozen items in a bit of newspaper to further insulate them in transit. Thanks for the gentle nudge. Lunk"
554473,Guest,2006-02-08 16:43:00,0,"If you take any fish out, you'll need something for them. We usually take great care in packaging everything perfectly for the trip in, but an empty cooler or cardboard box or two can come in handy for the trip out."
554234,therock14,2006-01-31 08:33:00,1,My friends and I are planning to go with mattice outfitters and it would be our first time with a fly in. Any information on what we could bring to make the trip a great time would be helpfull. I liked the idea of a britta filter. Thank you The Rock
554238,Stauff,2006-01-31 10:50:00,110,Which outpost are you headed to? How many days? When?
554240,jigman 2003,2006-01-31 11:32:00,981,"You are going with a first class outfitter. I have been using MLO for a number of years now. I have been to Vick, Pringle and Ogoki. I think that Ogoki is probably the best walleye fishing lake. Pringle was very good also, but Ogoki has more and different structure. Vick was a good pike lake, but we didn't do real well on the 'eyes. Probably needed to some more exploring. What do you need for a great trip? That's debatable. Personally, for fishing I take LOTS of jigs, mostly 1/4's and 3/8's but a few heavy ones also. A handful of stick baits and crankbaits, a couple of spoons and spinnerbaits, some spinner rigs, and LOTS of plastic tails in various sizes, configurations, colors, etc. I usually take NO livebait. Don't need it. That's a personal choice, some guys feel its necessary, they should take it. Sleeping bag, SUNGLASSES, sun block, BUGSPRAY, baby wipes (you can thank me for that idea later), groceries, BEER, GOOD QUALITY RAIN GEAR, 2 spinning rods, one trolling rod, one baitcaster, the list goes on and on. Do a search here for canada trip supplies, some good info. there. I am sure other guys will chime in also. When are you going and to which lake? One thing I can assure you of: you don't have to worry about the service, accomodations, or fishing with MLO. You'll have a good trip."
554241,Guest,2006-01-31 12:25:00,0,"I second that baby wipes thing. If you haven't had to do a dookie in the wild, you will. And when you do, don't forget to cover your junk from the mosquitoes. Also, don't overpack clothing. Remember to think of clothing in layers, which can be reworn everyday. (2 pants, 2 long johns, 5-7 tee shirts, 2 long sleeve T's, 2 sweatshirts, good raingear, and a change of underwear and socks everyday). Bring food that is necessary and easy to travel with. Example, don't buy and bring the canadian potatoes for whatever, bring the pasta or rice packets as sides, and bring frozen fries. Keep things fairly straight forward, set a menu and stick with it, leave the excess food behind (except beer)."
554243,jigman 2003,2006-01-31 12:42:00,981,"Good food points. What I have started doing for potatoes is to bring the pre-packaged ones. Hash browns, cottage fries, etc. They make cooking quicker and easier, and they pass at the border. If you want fresh spuds, make sure you buy them in Canada."
554251,Whopper,2006-01-31 15:32:00,340,"Jigman & STehle bring up some good points. Don't forget a camera, digital or reg doesn't matter, on your first trip you will want to take as many pic's as you can. I did my first trip three years ago and was like a little kid in a candy store, I loved it! Not having a digital camera at the time of my first trip I took five disposble cameras and used all of them. I've went on two trips now and still take to many clothes, just make sure you have some warm clothes and a real good rain suit. As far as food we eat fish everyday with the exception of one night and that is steak night. The only other food we take are snack foods like miniture candy bars, fruit bars, granola bars and sunkiss tuna snack lunches too eat during the day on the water unless we plan a shore lunch. Another important item is a weatherproof boat bag to keep jacket,raingear,camera and snacks in while your in the boat. These bags are inexpensive and when empty take up very little room, unless you use it to carry your spleeping bag in. Normally each outfitter has a list of things to bring that they don't supply like sheets, blankets,nets or life vest. Check with Mattice I'm sure they have a list if not ask! Good Luck, once you go there is no turning back you will absolutely love it. I'm like Jigman jigs,jigs,and more jigs with twister tails in assorted colors (I personally like bright colors)will catch all the walleye you want. Take Care Whopper"
554265,Guest,2006-02-01 05:27:00,0,"I suggest you read the Planner from Slate Falls Outpost. (I don't know anything about this outfiter, only that the planner is humorous and highly informative.) http://www.slatefallsoutposts.com/planner/index.html"
554285,Dr. Lee,2006-02-01 17:49:00,15,"I am quite familiar with Slate Falls Outfitters and Verne is absolutely the consumate professional. His lakes are outstanding, not pricey for the service/reliability. St. Joe is my favorite. I would highly recommend them."
554287,Wisconeye,2006-02-01 20:19:00,79,"You couldn't have picked a better first-time place or outfitter. Jigman is right on base with his comments but I would add that if you think minnows are going to be a plus, then spend some money for several packages of Berkely Gulp Minnows-3"". Last year I had outstanding success = to guys fishing real minnows. Plastic tails are good, but $30 for six packages of Gulp will make a difference. I found orange, white and chartreause to be the colors of choice for Ogoki."
554288,Guest,2006-02-01 21:25:00,0,"Dried pasta of any kind we mix ours with garlic and butter and dried spuds work, Mac and cheese. Anything dried to cut down on weight. We eat a lot of fish cooked many ways. Fish tacos, baked fish you name it. Oat meal in the morn and no you don't need milk mix up jelly in the oats, works good. The pre cooked bacon works good also. Duct tape, We had the flies eating us up one day (ankles) fly dope did not seem to work so I wraped my ankles/socks with the tape BINGO the blood sucking SOB's had their last meal on me. Deck of cards and Dice ,old mags. that you want to leave in the cabin for others to read is nice. We take one change of clothes and wash and then put out to dry. We usally go with 4 people food beer and everything less than 400 pounds 375 or so. It can be done good luck!!"
