554464,Hump,2006-02-08 14:21:00,578,I stay at Evergreen. any of those bays that you speak of near by?
554466,Guest,2006-02-08 14:50:00,0,East of Evergreen. The ownwers will have a map for you that shows the spots .
554495,Guest,2006-02-09 12:30:00,0,"You should check out Moosehorn Lodge near Sioux Lookout. It is on Pelican Lake which is connected to Lac Seul. It is an awesome place with a bar! The people that work there are awesome, and will do anything to make your trip the trip of a lifetime. You should see the Walleyes that everyone brings back in, not to mention the big muskies (obviously just photos). Go to www.canadafish.com to check it out."
554497,Guest,2006-02-09 13:59:00,0,"The first and second major streams flowing into Sawmill bay to as you go in from the main lake. I hit it on sunny days in late morning, 3rd week in May 2 years ago. Weather was cold in Morning. Water temp in the low to mid 40's(F) in main lake by the sanctuary but climbing to low to mid 50's in Sawmill. Pikey's ate up my orange and white daredevil. Wally's in the entrance and neck downs on Chartruse curly tails and/or minnows."

554512,Guest,2006-02-09 19:13:00,0,"Greg, Is Rocking Roy your father or your wife?"
554517,AndyF7,2006-02-10 00:00:00,6,I think Roy might be my Mom.
554208,AndyF7,2006-01-30 12:24:00,6,"I'm looking for some advise on what resorts to look at on Lac Seul. Would need to have decent docks with some protection from wind (waves), restaurant/bar, decent cabins. Thanks Greg"
554236,Guest,2006-01-31 08:43:00,0,"If having a restaurant and bar is important, about the nicest one in the area is Whitewing. I have not stayed there but have stopped by. It does look nice."
554250,Guest,2006-01-31 15:03:00,0,"Hey AndyF7, If you want a restaurant/bar go to lake of the woods with the rest of the city slickers!! Roy Winegartner"
554254,Guest,2006-01-31 17:02:00,0,"I've fished there the last two years. Awesome! Just Awesome fishing! Last year stayed with Dan McDonald at Lac Seul Lodge 3rd week of June and going back again same time this year. Caught tons of 20 to 27 inch Walleyes workin' weed lines in neck downs and windy points. Squatty football smallies were on the reefs. Nice cabins, great docks and dock hands. In nice semi-protected bay. No bar though. Year before went the 3rd week of May and stayed at Timberlane up in the river.Cold but the fishing was good, cabins OK. Shallow Pike were huge where water runs in!"

554258,Guest,2006-01-31 18:29:00,0,"JT, Lac Seul Lodge along with Evergreen and Lost Island look good. Thanks for your input. Greg"
554262,Guest,2006-01-31 22:23:00,0,"I and my friend stayed for little over a week at Evergreen first part of september. awesome service, excellent dock service, i highly recommend evergreen, we are heading back around the same time again this year."
554264,Guest,2006-02-01 00:08:00,0,I will second the whitewing response. we cooked our own food but the restourant looked vey good
554270,Hump,2006-02-01 07:48:00,578,"What do you mean""where the water runs in?"""
554272,Guest,2006-02-01 09:20:00,0,"All i am saying is you shouldn't pick your fishing trip location based on whether there is a bar nearby. It should be a vacation from work, cars, and bars. Bring booze and lots of it but drink it in your cabin with a fire going and a poker game going, not in a bar! That is too much like home. Roy"
