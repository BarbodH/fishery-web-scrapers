554433,Rather Be Lucky,2006-02-07 20:34:00,256,A friend of mine is going to Lac Seul this summer and is looking for a detailed lake map for navigation. Any one know where one can purchase such a map? Thanks in advance. Swede

In the US I get mine from Milwaukee Map, in (ironically enough) Milwaukee. They will ship, but you need to know what section. The area I fish covers 4 sections so I need all 4, but a good map is essential, particularly if you are a first timer. That and a good GPS, and knowing how to use it. If you are unsure, hire a guide. LS is a BIG piece of water with very confusing islands, bays, etc. and you can get totally turned around in a hurry. Spending a night on an island is NO fun if you are lost, and there are plenty of underwater land mines that just love taking out a lower unit from a rookie. Have fun! But be careful out there."

554567,Guest,2006-02-12 12:09:00,0,I would recommend two sets of maps: 1) Order the explorer series maps that give overall depth info. and likely fishing areas. 2) Order the topographic maps from the centre for topographic maps at http://maps.nrcan.gc.ca/topo_metadata/52_e.php These wil allow you to plug in the Mercator Grid coordinates of where you want to go right into your GPS and you can plot a very detailed course before going out. It requires a little homework but man does it payoff!
