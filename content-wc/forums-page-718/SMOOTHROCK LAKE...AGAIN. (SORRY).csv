If you are looking for an outpost, I would look at a different lake so you have more seclusion. That is the main reason of an outpost along with the great fishing. We really like the area north of Sioux Lookout for numbers and with better average sizes and we usually get some trophy quality fish every year."

554522,Guest,2006-02-10 09:46:00,0,It's been about 15 years but I fished Smoothrock for three summers in July and August. The camp in the middle of the lake is where we stayed. The East and Northeast end of the lake has several narrows with moving water and a few rivers coming in and one river going out. These areas produced consistent walleye. The bays and weeds in the East end produced Northern. The West end of the lake is very deep and didn't seem to have good Walleye and Northern structure. The guys we meet at the outpost camp on the West end of the lake did not have much luck catching fish. The lake is shaped kind of like a donut with a huge island in the middle. I did not fish the Northern end of the lake.
