Does anyone have any information on this possibility? With this possoble extension are the IDs that the two countries were working on done with?
554426,Guest,2006-02-07 14:35:00,0,"I just checked the US Customs and Border protection web site and on December 30, 2005 they issued a revised deadline for the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. Basically states:  December 31, 2006  Requirement applied to all air and sea travel to or from Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and Bermuda.  December 31, 2007  Requirement extended to land border crossings So to summarize, if traveling by water or air, you will need a passport to return to the US effective December 31, 2006. If crossing the border via land, you will need a passport effective December 31, 2007. If anyone wants to read the web site the link is: http://www.customs.ustreas.gov/linkh...i_timeline.doc All the best, Agate"
