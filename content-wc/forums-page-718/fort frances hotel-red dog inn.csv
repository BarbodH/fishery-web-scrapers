554454,Guest,2006-02-08 11:20:00,0,thanks for the info... does the old red dog still have a bar that we can stop in for a few if we stay at the super 8?
554455,Guest,2006-02-08 11:25:00,0,"I was looking for a place last year, and some one on here recommended the Emo Inn in Emo. If you're going west from Ft Frances, it's only another 30 minutes. Very nice, you get to sleep an extra 1/2 hour in the morning, and they have a nice sports bar, and a liquor store next door."

We fly out of Clearwater lake with L&M Fly In every year and stay at Off Lake Cabins, they are very reasonably priced and nice accommodations on the lake. The phone number is 807-482-1388. The old Red Dogg is called the Adventurer Inn and still has the bar & restraunt."

Just booked yesterday at La Place Rendez-Vous after reading your message and doing a ""Fort Frances motel"" search (lots of good info in the archives). The Rendez-Vous is pricey as some mentioned, but they have special security in the parking lot on Friday nights in the summer, which is nice. She said they had only two or three rooms left for our night - July 14th. 154 days and counting! Dave"
