554256,Trailerguy,2006-01-31 17:51:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3] [b] I got one in the mail today, apparently a small % of anglers who bought licenses last year are being surveyed. Something the MNR does every 5 years. It covers how many days spent, fish caught/released, methods, and of course where caught, before going into $ spent and concerns about quality of the resources. The last thing they ask is for comments. I really don't have any burning issues for the MNR, seems like they do what they can with what they have? Any thoughts here? [font color=green size=3][b] Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

They are pretty vague in terms of where the boundaries between certain areas are. Would also like to see some changes in the bait restrictions and more done to prevent culling. With our new warmer climate it seems seasons need to change as well. By the time trout season opens here, they'll be long gone."

554297,retire55,2006-02-02 12:13:00,1029,"Copied from http://www.thefishingnews.com/cgi-bin/news_wire.pl OTTAWA  Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), in cooperation with provincial and territorial governments, announced today the launch of the 2005 Survey of Recreational Fishing in Canada. The survey is the most comprehensive assessment of recreational fishing conducted in Canada. It has been conducted every five years since 1975. The results are used by fisheries management agencies as a primary source of information about recreational fishing in all provinces and territories. Survey questionnaires will be mailed to 82,000 Canadian residents and anglers from other countries by provincial and territorial agencies and DFO over the coming weeks. The purpose of the survey is to obtain reliable, up-to-date information on the importance and popularity of recreational fishing in Canada. Recipients are being asked questions such as where they fish and how often, what fish they catch and retain, their opinions on specific management issues and the amount of money they spend in pursuit of their fishing activities. The results of the 2000 survey showed that angling in Canada is a popular outdoors activity. In 2000, there were 3.6 million active adult anglers who fished for a total of 48 million days. Of the fish caught, nearly two-thirds were released. The success of catch and release programs is a testament to the importance of conservation to Canada's anglers. Overall, the angling population spent an estimated $6.7 billion in Canada in 2000. A final report on the 2005 survey, with Canada-wide results as well as those for each jurisdiction, will be published next year. More information on the results of the previous Surveys of Recreational Fishing in Canada is available on the Statistics link of DFO's homepage at www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca."
