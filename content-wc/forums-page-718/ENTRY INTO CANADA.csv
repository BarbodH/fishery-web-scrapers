554429,Guest,2006-02-07 16:34:00,0,"I am not 100% sure on this one, but I do not believe it would be a problem. The basis for non-admission is if it's a felony in Canada. Minor consumption is not a felony, DWI is a felony in Canada. He should be ok going through. Have a good trip! Agate"
554431,Guest,2006-02-07 19:17:00,0,"What kind of punk cop charges a 20 year old for minor consumption??? Honestly, unless he was streaking naked and screaming through a quiet neighbourhood at 2 in the morning, or something else bizarre (where the consumption would be classified as far greater than 'minor'), that is just 'bad form' on the part of the cop. I don't know the rule or lack thereof, but I can almost guarantee you won't have a problem. Besides, he was charged for something that is legal up here! The best thing is, once he gets here he can drink as much as he wants. NWO Fishing Bum"

554463,Guest,2006-02-08 13:35:00,0,have better stories about 40 yr olds drinking canadian beer for the 20th time...
554467,Guest,2006-02-08 14:58:00,0,It was just a fun night where a 20 year old american kid had a bit to much of the canadian beer (moonshine) coupled with a little of the green stuff. He wound up finishing sentances and saying weird things 10 minutes after the conversation was over. And in between he would go into a quiet trance with a big grin on his face.
