554348,Andre M,2006-02-03 22:35:00,86,I think he is the best for the Gouin:http://www.airmontlaurier.com/english.html Is on Lac du MÃ¢le (buck lake); the only spot without road around. Very well organise. You better contact him fast because he is quite busy.
554361,Guest,2006-02-05 12:06:00,0,Air melancon did real well for us. They are located with 2 camps pretty close to the good fishing spots. The equipment was good and the cabins were in good shape and quiet too. There is more boats fishing the area than I would have liked but you just need to go find your own spots sometimes.
554377,phishfearme,2006-02-06 11:23:00,1242,"fishin fool - i posted a similar thread a few months ago and also spent many hours looking for what i consider a remote housekeeping cabin on the gouin (us being used to NW ontario where you can find many, many hugh lake with only one cabin) and found very few that would fit our bill. caesar's had a few - like lake super - but there always seems to be another cabin just down the shore. two past regulars on this board, Alsis and McQ, are extreemly familiar with this massive reservoir but they both seem to have dissappeared. i've come to the conclusion that there's really no ""remote"" cabins - at least by my definition. so, instead of a one day drive to the gouin area from our homes in pittsburgh (home of the champions!!) we're doing the two day drive to NW ontario to get what we wanted. good luck, phish"

Have you checked out the ""remoteness of the cabins on fly-in trips with http://www.lac-berthelot.com/historye.htm"
554443,phishfearme,2006-02-07 22:50:00,1242,"55 - a tough question to answer with precision but we're pretty used to have a very large lake (10 miles or so) plus a portage lake or two all to ourselves. a partial list of lakes we've been to include keckeokagami lake with wesley's, springpole lake with lac seul outfitters, obashi lake with northern outposts, bow lake with albany river, telescope lake with viking, AND lac evans with north american bushmen in northern quebec among numerous others. in all of these cases, if we wanted to fish the REAL hotspots (like river inlets or nice rock piles) we had these places to ourselves and didn't have to compete with a flotilla of boats (do you recall the post some time ago about ignorant people running up onto people already fishing an are). let's face it, the old biological maxim that 90% of the fish live in 10% of the lake applies. also, we don't want to worry about the boys in cabin 22 deciding to raise #### all night or listening to a generator across the lake all day. seems as you move further to the east coast, thes criteria become much harder to find. would still like to hear if options exist similar to the above - we're getting tired of 2 full days of driving. thanks, phish"
554444,phishfearme,2006-02-07 22:55:00,1242,"55 - i went to the berthlot web site and was unable to find descriptions of any of the fly-in lakes. do you know anything about them? i seem to recall looking into berthlot years ago and coming to the conclusion that their fly-in lakes were just too small to keep interest for four guys for 7-10 days. would love to hear your opinion. thanks, phish"
