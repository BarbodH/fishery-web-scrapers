If I remember correctly the names might be Catherine Lake and Catastrophie Lake. We go by these lakes all the time and have never seen a boat on them,but there are accesses."

553810,Guest,2006-01-16 20:14:00,0,"I've fished Catastrophe a couple of times. OK walleye, but better smallmouth and northern. Catastrophe has a very narrow reef running down the center half of the southern part of the lake. It's about a foot under the water--so the name Catastrophe. Be careful! The public access at Catastrohe is quiete shallow, but my bass boat launched ok. However we had to wade to our knees to launch my walleye boat.... The lake is about 2 miles long, but only 1/2 mile wide at the widest point. Chuck"
