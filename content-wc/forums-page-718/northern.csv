554566,Trailerguy,2006-02-12 10:01:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b] Pike hit just about anything they can get their jaws around. Suiks are one of my favorite lures for pike, but I've caught many more on a spinner with a minnow, while trolling for Walleyes. Generally pike relate to weedbeds or other sumerged structure depending on the time of the year. Any lure that vibrates, rattles, or swims erradicly is a good choice to catch them. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

554569,Guest,2006-02-12 13:12:00,0,"Just like trailer, I've noticed that pike will just about hit anything, especially in the shallows during late fall and early summer. However, when the water temps in the coves and along the shoreline begin to heat up above 70-75 degrees, I like going after the big ones when they move out in deeper water. That's when I've noticed they become a little more selective in colors and choices of lures. You will often see these pike loosely schooled in packs of 3 to 5 (that typically run 30""+) in a relatively small area on your sonar. Oftentimes, they will be near schools of baitfish, minnows, etc. and chances are they are actively feeding, and they generally look like long cigar shaped images on the sonar when you pass over them. Since they will be fairly deep, you can slow motor over them and drop a bouy while using the main motor or electric trolling motor. If they are suspended 8 to 12 feet down, I prefer to long cast deep diving crank baits in perch, crawfish, or white colors. (#9 shadraps are my first choice.) You can also troll for them with a deep diving crank if they are strung out across a large area or if you see several schools of baitfish on the sonar. However, if they are on near or on the bottom, then I prefer to 'snap jig' them with a 3/8 to 3/4 oz jig head on a natural or perch colored zoom or other type stick bait, or even a 4"" thick-bodied green or brown tube. Get right over them, drop the jig down to the bottom, and snap it up about 3 to 5 feet with the rod tip, and allow it to fall back down on a semi-taut line. The hits will usually occur as it drops back down after a 'snap', but sometimes they'll hit it as you are dropping it for the first time. The strike can be quite jarring, so give a good hook set and stand by for a nice fight. You can oftentimes nail 2 or 3 that way if they are active, before the rest of them get spooked and/or disperse. My fishing partner and I each keep a rod rigged this way, since we frequently stumble across them while working a shoreline for smallies in mid-summer. Sometimes you can work deeper water flats by snap-jigging while you drift the flat, but always look for schools of bait fish so you aren't totally wasting your time. It's a great way to get bigger pike (and even a musky or two) when they have moved to deeper (18 to 30 feet) water. It's suprising just how many you can catch this way--one exceptional day at Minaki we got over 38 that were 24"" to 40"", and one musky that was 42"". (We came back to the cabin that evening almost totally exhausted.) Chuck"
