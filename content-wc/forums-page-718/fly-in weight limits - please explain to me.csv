554483,phishfearme,2006-02-08 21:26:00,1242,"who said anything about NO weight limits? the limits are set by the government/manufacturer. to me the answer is very simple. the plane's weight limit (properly distributed) is ""x"" pounds. your group - people and gear - must be less than ""x"". why all the ficticious limits? phish"
554405,Guest,2006-02-06 21:28:00,0,"Planes don't have plaques, they have what are called weight and balance sheets, which must be on board at all times. An airplanes weight and balance sheet is specific to that exact airplane and takes into account every oz. of weight that is added to the airplane. For instance, every time a new instrument is added to the cockpit, like a gps, the weight of that instrument is added to the balance sheet. The fact is, luggage weight is more critical than people weight because of where it rides. The furthur away from the datum point (usually the engine firewall) the weight rides, the more it matters. in an Otter and Beaver, the luggage rides behind the passengers. Therefore a lb. of luggage means much more than a lb. of people. It is also possible to stay within the total takeoff weight, but if it is loaded incorrectly it may not be legal to fly."

So I guess if you don't put your foot down some place they would bring everything. I guess they were going to live off spuds as they had a 20# bag for 5 days? 2 of us went with a wife and under 400# for 4 of us and yes we had 4 cases of beer. You can do it just take dry food and plan ahead, food adds up real fast. We eat fish each day and sometimes fish as a snack at night."

554442,phishfearme,2006-02-07 22:34:00,1242,i've still heard no rational for the typical 90-150lbs weight limits? does anybody really know?? phish
554471,Guest,2006-02-08 16:34:00,0,"I can't say I know the answer, but a couple thoughts: Can you imagine what people would bring if there weren't weight limits? The weight limits probably allow the operators to make a generous allowance for the body weight of the clients, and at least know which size plane they will need; one trip or two, etc, etc. If they just made an allowance of, say 350lb per person including gear, heavier people would complain. Imagine if your group was trying to figure out whether to bring in freeze dried lasagna or eat fish one extra meal, and the group coming in behind you had 15 cases of beer because they were all jockeys......"

554379,phishfearme,2006-02-06 11:47:00,1242,"there was an interesting post recently about what to do to meet the weight limits imposed by numerous fly-in outfitters with some excellent suggestions. this limit has always bothered me - is it based on safety? is it just an opportunity to make more money? or what. we do 10 day trips and just cannot meet the limits even when the outfitter flys in our one case of beer for each guy - and some outfitters have charged us for each ounce over the limit and others just ignore it. i've come to the conclusion that it can't be based on airplane safety load limits - otherwise, you would have to weight the individual passengers also - we've been doing fly-ins for over 20 years and this has never happened. so a group of 4 ""large"" guys are charged the same as 4, 160 pounders. so what's the basis for the weight limits? please 'splain it to me. thanks, phish"

They say that as long as you can give your beer/soda/water order ahead of time we should be fine as long as you leave the kitchen sinks at home. We try to take a small or medium tackle bag and limit the amount of leadheads. Our group of 10 guys range from 160 pounds up to over 300. 4 of us are over 235. I agree that it should be based on the entire weight and not per person. I think that with our large group they have to decide what planes to take in. They obviously have different weight requirements. I think we flew in an otter and a beaver last time."

We're having about 2 cases each flown in ahead of time, along with cooking oil, potatoes, canned goods, water, and some ice. They go in to prepare the camp beforehand, so we should be good on weight limits."
554385,jigman 2003,2006-02-06 14:00:00,981,"Weight limits are established by the Canadian government based on type of plane. When an outfitter follows the weight restrictions closely they will put people and gear on the scale. Some outfitters hit you with overweight charges even if your gear is under, but you have some ""large boned"" people in your party. On the beer issue, some people go to Canada to fish. I can drink a case of beer a night at home if I want. Up there I try to moderate my drinking to 3 or 4 a day."

The other days is less than 6."
554391,grt1,2006-02-06 16:05:00,259,"Each type of aircraft has it's own weight restrictions. It is illegal for the airline to overload the aircraft for the sake of ""convenience' to the customer. The airline can lose it's licence to operate if it is found in violation of this law. And, quite frankly, it's dangerous. The heavier the plane, the longer it takes to get off the water and on some short take off locations on the smaller lakes, this would mean disaster. As to the weight of the big guy vs the little guy, most airlines use the rule of thumb of 165 pounds per person (at least that was the weight used when I used to have to fly around for a living). They figure it averages out, I guess. However, if the big guy is really big, I'm sure the airline will weigh him too and adjust the other load accordingly."
554396,phishfearme,2006-02-06 18:52:00,1242,"i guess i still need more 'splaining. we have NEVER been weighed as a group with all of our stuff (in more than 20 years of doing fly-ins), which, if there's a real safety issue is the only way it should be done. and using an average like 165 pounds is a fat joke - especially for us overweight americans. as far as i know, the government sets weight limits on each type of plane and that's it. do you imply that the government set the 100 or 125 pounds per person limit - even the canadian government isn't that intrusive. and anyway, the limits differ from outfitter to outfitter - even on the same plane type - and for a given outfitter, he'll set his own limit irrespective of him using an otter, beaver or whatever. i've still heard no basis for the weight limits. in my mind the limit simply should be on a safety basis - which includes the weight of the people flying. phish"
554400,jerry bark,2006-02-06 19:49:00,822,"I wonder if the planes have a plaque similar to the coast guard rating plaque on a boat? perhaps the planes are rated for ""4 passengers and 500 lbs cargo"" if that is the case then i could see the pilot/govenrment enforcing 125/person regardless of the weight of the passengers. that's just a thought. someone above mentioned that it may just be to keep people from going nuts on what they bring, i think that is a good possibility along with the fact that more weight=more fuel. seems like the owners would be glad to fly extras in on the flight that picks up the group leaving for a modest cost since that plane is going there anyway. i'm sure some will do that. cheers jerry"
554404,phishfearme,2006-02-06 21:10:00,1242,jerry - my boat has a weight limit - not a person number plus weight limit. i'm 99% sure that planes has a similar weight rating. what difference does it make weather whe weight is from people or cargo. the laws of physics don't make distinctions. phish
