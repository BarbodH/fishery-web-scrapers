No it is because it would be unreasonable to expect a tourist to go through the class and do the test for teh sake of a weekend or two. They can only operate their OWN boat under this exemption. IF they rent a boat the renter is obligated to provide them with a dockside safety demonstration."
554392,Guest,2006-02-06 16:14:00,0,"Last time I looked, the yahoo's on PWC who buzzed our boat at 40mph about 25 feet away were licensed when I pointed them out to the OPP. So how does that silly license demanded by the feds help any? Didn't help the kids in my boat who were scared sh..tless when this happened. These licenses are as good as the gun licenses, that's why I won't be bothering. Enough big brother, time to stand up."
554407,Eyesore,2006-02-06 22:31:00,455,"I really feel sorry for you Canadians. Man the libs are outta kontrol. What next - A ""Baitcaster users permit""? Geeze, someone could rash their thumb just trying to stop the spool in order to prevent a backlash ya know. Safety... I thought we had it bad here in the states."

554410,Eyesore,2006-02-07 00:00:00,455,"Spiker, I wasnt slamming you canadiens at all. however I was slamming the system which continues to regulate the living shlitt out of everything. I figgered yall would be against more boating regs. If you like the new act, then great. I myself operate with a common sense approach to things - That is I can operate or use a heck of alot of todays devices without need for ""Proper training"" and the limits and restrictions placed on them by the gov. Stupid people do stupid things, regulations not withstanding."

Actually it was us boaters who pushed for the changes. We wanted mandatory training for boaters. Anyone with money can buy a 250 HP boat with no knowledge of laws and go full speed around the lake. You wouldn't dream of letting people drive a car without proper instruction first, why should a boat be any different? The course gives you the knowledge, what you do with it is up to you. What this does do is make people more culpable when they do something stupid. Having the operators card means you knew better and did it anyway. What would really help would be mandatory liability insurance. Since most PWC operators could not afford it (PWC insurance is very expensive), it would cut their numbers way down."
554425,Eyesore,2006-02-07 14:30:00,455,"So you'll need an ""operators card"" to legaly drive a boat... Will people also need a ""Classroom card"" to legaly be permited to enrole in the instructional session? Sorry to sound like a smart arse, but ya get my point - which is the regulations never end. Just too much these days. But hey, it is your country, so good luck, I wish yall the best. Canada is indeed a great country, but all those LAWS, geeze"
554316,wildduck223,2006-02-03 17:56:00,38,I just found out that all operators of motor boat will need to be certified in Canada by 2009. The site to order the class/ materials is www.boaterexam.com. The fee is $45 and the license is good for life. The coures cost $19.95 plus gst tax.

554317,grt1,2006-02-03 18:57:00,259,"It is my understanding that this only applies to Canadian residents, and American residents if they remain in Canada for 45 consecutive days. so if you are a US citizen and leave on day 30 to go home for a day or weekend, you start all over again on your return at day 1. American visitors don't need this licence but are supposed to be instructed on boat use and handling by the operators of the lodge they stay at."

554352,grt1,2006-02-04 09:48:00,259,"I'm not sure, but I think that was also exempt from having a recreational boat operators license card,but I also think that the boat cannot be left in Canada for the entire season. An interesting sidelight to the licence issue is this. the name of the card is RECREATIONAL operators licence, and after checking with the police and the mnr who are supposed to enforce the law, they say there is a grey area. When I guide, I am operating a commercial vehicle for a camp and thus it is not a recreational vehicle so I may not need this licence. Wierd isn't it?"
