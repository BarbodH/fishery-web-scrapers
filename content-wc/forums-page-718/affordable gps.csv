I just checked and don't have a record who I got it from. Type in E-Trex Legend on the Amazon site and see what you find. Bass Pro and Cabelas usually have them for around $180 but I think you do better with a lttle more checking. It has 8 meg of memory for adding maps, can remember 500 waypoints, 10 tracks and 20 routes. These are all downloadable to your computer so you can keep your waypoints, tracks, and routes on the computer. I have last summer's fishing trip saved and will reload it before go again this year. For my purposes it's a great unit. I was looking at the basic ""yellow"" etrex but I somehow talked myself into needing it. Nimstug When I Grow Up, I Want to be a Little Boy"
