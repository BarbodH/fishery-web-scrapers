I was origanally planing on fishingthe week of July 14 but wonder if it would be better to go August 4.The may fly hatch concerns me. I will be fishing for walleye, northern,bass and possibly perch. Is there any negatives for going in August.Thanks"
1396497,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-02-19 18:02:00,235,"Have fished walleyes in July and August on Jeannette, Bertha, Wakeman and Okanse Lakes, which are all straight north of Dryden. Most trips were the first week in August. We always did well. We did have mayflies once during a mid July trip, but once we figured out that the fish were up extremely shallow (sometimes 2ft or less on rock piles), we really got into them. I personally think July and August are the best months to go. Weather is stable, and fish are on the predictable mid lake humps and drop offs. Then again, we fish fly in lakes, so you might have to handicap a drive in lake off that."
