The first few miles of the lake from the camp are island-filled, which means it is easy navigating with a smaller boat, fishing is great. Check out www.osullivansrainbow.com If you have questions, feel free to contact me at [email protected] Bill Krejca"
1398516,Q-tip,2012-02-24 06:46:00,8,I would suggest you contact the MNR in the area that you wish to fish. They are usually quite helpful and will provide suggestions based on current information.
1398645,NARDA 1,2012-02-24 11:30:00,636,"You might want to check out www.birchdalelodge.com they have campsites available and are on Eagle Lake. Plenty of area to fish with walleye, northern, smallmouth, lake trout and musky."
1398675,ohiojmj,2012-02-24 12:16:00,1262,"The daily rate for non-resident camping on crown land in Ontario is per person, so you may be want to consider the cost and aggravation versus a plot of grass at a fish camp with a freezer to store some of your food/fish. It was suggested that a conservation fishing license must be used when camping on crown land. I fail to understand the relationship between camping and fishing license type. I've camped on crown land and fished with a sport license."
1398732,mwal,2012-02-24 13:59:00,151,I think what was meant by the person posting that is camping on Crown land you may only keep fish according to the limit of a conservation limit. This applies even if you purchased a full license. This is meant to steer you into using a lodge/outfitter. If you camp thru a lodge or outfitter your a spending more money in the Provence and supplying jobs and you may keep a full limit. Mwal
1398740,paulisan1,2012-02-24 14:24:00,143,Ive camped in Canada before went in backwoods camping and fishing with my son. Canoe portage camp on islands no problems. I did put my canoe on a little rowboat trailer and was able to fill the canoe with camping gear. Thus I was able to take a smaller vehicle that was better on MPG. The same would work with a small rowboat instead of a top carrier you get to take more gear already loaded in the boat boat in find a great place to camp. Keep it simple and you will have a great time.
1398964,biotroller,2012-02-25 08:37:00,437,I've called & sent an e-mail to the MNR. I'm hoping to hear back from them next week. I think that this may work out. I have also contacted a few outfitters to see about camping near their lodges. I appreciate the insight! Please keep the ideas coming!
1399539,Guest,2012-02-26 17:50:00,0,"We have been camping on Crown Land for over 40 years. Last few years our biggest consern has been keeping bear out of camp. We use an electric fence run off a deep cycle battery. It has worked well so far. We have seen bear in camp at dusk but after chasing them out, have never had them get into anything at night or while out fishing..............."
1398275,biotroller,2012-02-23 14:18:00,437,"I live in Illinois & have been thinking about camping in Canada this summer. I don't want to tow my boat 18 hrs, the cost of gas alone would kill me. I'm not sure if I'm being foolish with my though process but, here goes! Bring a 14' v-hull on a ladder rack, 9.9 or 15 hp four stroke in the bed of the truck, along with assorted camping gear. I'm not sure how many days worth of gear I could get into my truck bed. I know I'd have to bring gas/water etc.Could a guy drive up like that & camp/fish nearby lakes?I am looking at the Nakina area.I'd prefer not to camp at a lodge if possible. I've read a little about camping on crown land but, having not actually done this before, I'm looking for someones insight.I hope to take my son up for a week with my Dad & brother & stay at a resort. It would be great to extend the trip with some camping as well. If I can't get the finances lined up for a resort, my only chance would be to camp.Who has tried/done something like this? Would you do it again? Any other thoughts/advice would be appreciated!If this ""idea"" isn't realistic let me down gently! Thank you for your help!"
1398300,dutchboy,2012-02-23 14:46:00,5717,I don't know the legality of doing it in Canada. Plenty and I mean plenty of people do it in VNP on the Canadian border. Camping in VNP in the United States only. Check in at the ranger station and away you go.I have seen Kayaks and Canoe's so loaded you would think they would sink. Sounds like a good time. Have fun and be safe.
1398308,NathanH,2012-02-23 15:10:00,697,Just a quick note. I would not bring water. Just purchase a water filtration system they hook right in to the water bottles. Bring up a 3 gallan water sack and make your water as you needed. hauling that water around when camping is just a pain.
1398310,Mondo_)H,2012-02-23 15:12:00,91,Do a SEARCH on here. I believe this may have already beed discussed on here. I think in Ontario you may need a permit but not in Quebec if I am correct. good luck amd have fun!
1398322,Guest,2012-02-23 15:37:00,0,I have camped for thirty years in Canada.I can give you a boat load of information. I do not know the location you mentioned but I can give you a few locations to consider. I am also from IL north west corner my e mail is [email protected] feel free to contact me. It is a great way to fish in Canada on a limited budget
1398384,biotroller,2012-02-23 17:47:00,437,"BAGW I sent you an e-mail. Thank you! I didn't mention, I don't need to be in a remote area, I would like to have my son catch a lot of fish!"
1398391,Munshaw,2012-02-23 18:00:00,279,"At the very least I know that non residents camping on crown land (public) are subject to conservation fishing license, which means 2 walleye limit. Some lakes, such as lac seul, have special regs stating no non resident camping on crown land. Make sure you check your specific lake. I don't think there's many though."
1398403,green&orange,2012-02-23 18:53:00,28,"A buddy and I camped on crown land last year for the first time. I've been to resorts as well and they are too ""busy"" for my taste. Just too many people around camp. We like to get away. Not that I dislike people but I go to Canada to get away from them. After camping, I don't think I will ever consider a lodge again. Just my preference. We car-topped a 12' boat (with a 6 HP Johnson) 30 miles down a logging road (off of the main road). Launched on a lake and camped at a remote site. We had that 12' loaded up with gear but we could fit everything we needed. Next year, we will pack a little smarter though (leave some things at home and bring some others).Like I said before, we camped on Crown land. It is $10 bucks a night per guy for Americans. This year - we are renting a tent from a licensed outfitter to avoid paying the $10 per night per guy fee (saves us about $40). We didn't see another person for the 4 days we camped. The fishing was excellent and doing it all on your own makes it just that much sweeter. To us, a lot of the fun is in the preparation - picking out a lake, researching how to get there, talking to the MNR biologist, ect. We have already picked out our 2012 and 2013 destinations - we are planning on getting more and more remote each year. Too many places and not enough time!Some general tips (not mentioned above) - freeze your perishable food and some beverages so they will last longer in the cooler, pack a mesh bag, marker bouy and rope to sink your beer in the deepest part of the lake to keep it cold (special thanks to Solopaddler for that one - we ripped that idea off big time), bring the basics for tackle (one spinning and one baitcasting rod - jigs, crankbaits, and spoons), and thermacells are excellent (bring refills).All in all, I would highly recommend it. Good luck!"
1398422,outdoorsron,2012-02-23 19:28:00,843,Hello: I would suggest to try to go through a licensed outfitter that has remote camp sights or can get you set up with the crown land permits. I camped in Canada several years ago and that is what we did. The outfitter got the camping permits we needed. We were also able to store food at the outfitters and we could run in after a couple of days and fill up with gas and get more supplies. We were able to take fish in to freeze but don't forget that the fish you freeze are part of your limit. We stayed on an Island that was about 7 miles from the resort and didn't see but a few boats the whole time and towards evening they all leave for the resort and we were there by ourselves most of the time. Good Luck O - R
