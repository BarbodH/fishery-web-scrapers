1397119,TexasMike,2012-02-21 04:57:00,7,This is my first post on this forum. I have found lots of good information on here. I am going up to Flin Flon the first week of June and I have a 50 gallon auxiliary diesel tank in my pick-up. Will I have a problem if it is full of diesel at the border? Thanks

So they are probably legal, but may be regulated differently than down here. You probably should call and find out for sure rather than rely on opinions. Just be sure before having problems at the border.I've thought about taking our truck different times just to have extra fuel for the ride up and the boat, but after some thought decided not to and here is my reasoning:It takes motor fuel tax to build and maintain the roads in both countries, so why should I use my home fuel and not support the maintenance of the highways that I (we) need to get around in Canada?It's just kind of a conscience thing for me. I serve on a Township board and know how important motor fuel taxes are to us when trying to maintain local roads.Pooch"

My pick- up has a small fuel tank so I put the aux tank on it. I can also get fuel much cheaper here in TX than every where else we travel so I try to carry as much as possible."

Leave one geographic area and gas might change 20 to 30 cents.My current 2010 Suburban has a smaller tank than my last one. When traveling long trips it shorts me nearly a hundred miles on a tank. Was looking at putting a 3/4 ton tank on, but decided it might not work and wasn't worth the effort in the end.Chevy used to offer an optional fuel tank on their trucks in the eighties. That would be a great option for some of us now, but will never happen anymore.Pooch"
