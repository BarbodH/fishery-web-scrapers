1397454,Brandin Iron,2012-02-21 19:03:00,11,We are planning a fishing trip to Caribou Falls Lodge on Tetu Lake the first of June. Any info on the camp and what to expect about the fishing would be of help. We have fished other camps in Ontario but this is the first time to Caribou Falls. Thanks! Brandin Iron
