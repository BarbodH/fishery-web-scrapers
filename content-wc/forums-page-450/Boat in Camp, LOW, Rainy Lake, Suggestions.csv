1395696,mrwalleye5,2012-02-17 12:54:00,1922,"I'm looking for ideas on a holiday trip to a boat in camp. Want to do our own house keeping, cooking and use our own boat. Just the wife, me and the little dog going. Would prefer LOW but open to anywhere. I was at Camp Narrows on Rainy last year but would like to try something different. Thanks for any suggestions."

1395758,steve.a,2012-02-17 14:46:00,274,There are quite a few options in the Nestor Falls area with lots of good fishing but not sure how many will let pets in the cabins.
1395982,mdsn,2012-02-18 07:57:00,121,"Hansens King Island has always been good for us. Great fishing area in Sabaskong Bay, Nice people, good service, clean cabins."

1396084,Bill Krejca,2012-02-18 13:14:00,6107,"Young's is good, housekeeping is July - Oct. I checked their 2010 brochure, and couldn't find whether dogs are allowed, I believe I read somewhere they are not - better check out their web site. Bill"
1396104,Guest,2012-02-18 14:57:00,0,"Spruce Island Camp on LOW is a boat in and housekeeping. It is pretty much smack dab in the middle of the lake about and hour ride from Morson On. You have many fishing options and low boat traffic. Love the place and the fishing in the area. Cabins are great(not to close together), clean and well maintained. Pets are welcome as we bring our dog. Owners and staff are very helpful. I think it has been owned by the same family for over 30yrs.www.spruceislandcamp.com"

You timing will be good for great reef fishing in the area and you will not have to travel far. Another plus, you are well protected in case of wind and will be able to access a lot of the lake should it blow hard. You can drive your vehicle to Young's Bay and launch and then you have about a 20 min boat ride to camp. It is a fantastic area."
