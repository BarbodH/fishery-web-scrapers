Others may range as far as the west end of Andrews Bay, about 11 miles from camp (approximately 15 minutes in one of the camp's 50 hp powered boats).Much of the fishing in Witch Bay is shore line related, while Andrews and it's surrounding bays (Riches, Pipestone, Bottle, etc) offer both shoreline and mid-lake hump fishing. As one of the guys said, especially for the over 80% return customer base, ranging further from camp is just an opportunity to see new water. There really is no need to. Another thing you might want to do is request one of their brochures. In addition to all the pictures Bill Krejca mentioned, there is also a fish log. This is a list of any and all fish guests are proud enough of to put on the fish board in the dining room, which is then reproduced in the annual brochure. It's guest produced, not a promo gimmick the camp does. You'll see everything from ""caught uncle wally's hat"" to a kid's first walleye to a trophy muskie listed. It gives you an idea of what kind of fish are being caught at different times of the season.Good luck and have fun whatever you decide."
1397355,IaDave,2012-02-21 15:27:00,476,My concern was the gas used but I just noticed they supply unlimited gas for their boats which I have never heard of. I may reconsider taking my Lund.
1397874,ManitowishWaters,2012-02-22 16:38:00,39,"We are already booked for the first week in sept. Trying to get a feel of how far is realistic in a day. We go to a different place in Aug. That on some days we run 30-40 min with 50hp. Thanks for the info, and anymore is helpful."
1393599,IaDave,2012-02-13 07:52:00,476,"I searched all the old posts and every comment was positive about the camp- Great service,food,owners are great,etc but never mentioned is ""how great the fishing is"". Most of the camps I have been to have always had good service etc and good fishing. So let me hear about the fishing as I am interested in going there sometime."
1393680,Bill Krejca,2012-02-13 10:27:00,6107,"Dave, I was out to the sport show at Hawkeye Downs yesterday, and picked up a brochure for Witch from the Sunset rep. The fairly thick publication had a total of 26 pages showing fish, probably an average of 25-30 pictures per page. Pretty impressive bunch of photos. I've never been there, but it sure looks for real! Good luck in your destination decision, and let us know how you did! Bill"
1393708,tyeeguy,2012-02-13 11:33:00,111,"when I was at the resort, they had a program where a guide, in his boat,would lead a pack of boats around the lake to fish at various spots.This was a great way to get to know the lake and some techniques thatput fish in your boat. We were free to fish on our own if we wanted afterwe learned how and where to fish.Best camp I have ever been at - good food, friendly people and they put youon fish."
1393805,brant,2012-02-13 13:50:00,89,"IaDave, I've been to Witchbay 3 times. With their fishing program(guides), it isn't hard to keep up to date on where and how to find fish. As far as the fishing in that area, it is some of the best quality fishing I've had."
1393809,IaDave,2012-02-13 13:59:00,476,You guys are starting to talk me into it. Anyone been there the end of May?
1394022,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2012-02-13 20:25:00,629,"IaDave: Sent you a ""PM"" about my great stay @ ""Witch Bay"" last Sept. John Hecklsmiller"
1396926,ManitowishWaters,2012-02-20 16:17:00,39,Just was wondering how far most people travel from camp on an average day. Picked up a map and wanted to see some peoples range. Thanks a ton.
1396932,Dog,2012-02-20 16:29:00,210,It's not necessary but we run out 15-20 miles from camp.
1397126,IaDave,2012-02-21 05:34:00,476,Why that far?
1397200,Dog,2012-02-21 09:12:00,210,Just for fun and to try some different areas
