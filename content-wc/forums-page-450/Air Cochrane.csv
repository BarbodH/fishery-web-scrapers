1396031,Mike Borger,2012-02-18 10:06:00,1554,Good to see after all these years they FINALLY included descriptions of each camp including pictures.Nice job and long overdue.
1396138,Pikehunters,2012-02-18 17:39:00,100,I will admit it is one of the most descriptive sites i've seen in a while. They lay it all out for ya. Just show up & fish!. I feel bad for everybody else because I'll probably wear out that site between now & august!!!!!!!
1396857,Mikep007,2012-02-20 14:30:00,77,"I agree, it's a nicely done web site. The pictures at each lake/cabin are a very nice touch. I also like the fair descriptions -- one lake described pike and walleye as poor to fair. I'd like to see more detail on the cabins (running water or showers, if any). For fly-in web sites, you can't beat www.wildernessnorth.com for detail and content, IMHO. I'll check out Air Cochrane more though."
