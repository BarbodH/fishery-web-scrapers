1395877,Walleyeski,2012-02-17 20:16:00,40,"Was there in September of last year. Thanks to the local guide, Andrew, he put us on lots of fish and helped us avoid most of the rocks. Lake level was very low. Getting up the rapids was an adventure."
1396054,Babamel2,2012-02-18 11:12:00,414,"Went there last Aug. the owner stated that the cabins had been refirbished in recent years with new cupboards & beds. Walleye fishing slow, but caught a lot of pike just under the slot. We did go to where the Allanwater empties into the lake and got a number of walleye there. Went by train which is notorius for running late (2-3 hrs). Andrew is a great guy, wish I would have used him as a guide and not tried to go out on my own."
1396139,Behle,2012-02-18 17:41:00,51,I appreciate the information. Is Andrew someone hired by John? There weren't any guides or dock hands working 3 years ago.
1396454,Babamel2,2012-02-19 16:09:00,414,Check with John to ask about Andrew. I really think that Andrew will be a good person for you to work with. He grew up on the lake and has lived there most of his life.
1396915,Walleyeski,2012-02-20 15:51:00,40,Andrew works for John but when Andrew guides its his own gig. We also caught alot of northerns just under the slot and did very well with the walleyes. Train was on time going in but 2 hours late coming out.
