I have been at Osullivans & had a ball. I haven't fished Endy's, they are about 4 hrs closer than Osullivans to me. Osullivans doesn't look like they have as nice of accomodations as Endy's. Osullivans will be about $300-400 more. I think the fishing may be better at Osullivans. Any advice from anyone who has been to both?Thank you!"

1397490,biotroller,2012-02-21 20:19:00,437,"My brother already has dates at both, he's going up for two weeks. I can only make it for one of the weeks, I will be staying in his cabin. I am leaning toward O'Sullivans. Any advice on which one before I send a deposit?"
1397510,adempsey,2012-02-21 21:15:00,963,"I haven't been to either place but have read numerous positive reports from O'Sullivan Lake over the years and was thinking about going there myself this year. There are plenty of reports on this forum alone. I can't say that I have heard of Endy's Bush Lake Resort. Based on the website, Endy's reminds me of Pasha Lake Cabins - which is actually not far from Paint Lake. It's probably a good place if you want to move around and drive to a new lake each day. If you want to wake up and walk out to your boat and start fishing, O'Sullivan's is probably a better choice.If it were me, I'd go to O'Sullivan lake. Especially if I were to bring my son."
