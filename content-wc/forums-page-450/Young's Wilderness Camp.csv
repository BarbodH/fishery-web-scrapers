1395608,Busman,2012-02-17 09:12:00,146,I just noticed it's fairly close to the Trans-Canada Highway. Can you notice much noise in camp.
1395618,jambi,2012-02-17 09:37:00,504,"If by noise you mean crickets & loons, eagles & chipmonks, yes you can hear that in camp. YWC is 2 miles (I love google earth) from Hwy 71.Met with Perry & Carol last night here in Tulsa at our little fishing show. Sure are great folks and have an awesome camp."

Certainly no highway noises, but plenty of loon calls (love the evening/sunset calls), rustling of the trees in the breeze, sounds of laughter around the fire ring at night, sounds of thunder from the spring thunderstorms, the quietness of the night, and the clicking of knives & forks on the dinner plates! Yeah,,,,,,,,, it's a noisy place, the perfect kind of noise!!"
