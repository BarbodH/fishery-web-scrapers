You will love the big 16ft boats and 20hp motors. As for the fishing... it takes care of itself. I have been on several trips with them now."

1399050,Brandin Iron,2012-02-25 12:11:00,11,"We fished smoothrock in 09 and had a great time. Debbie runs a very good operation. Equipment and cabins were all good. Some of the best cabins we have been in. We were there the first week of June and the weather was very unsettled. We caught fish all days but 2 days the weather cleared and warmed up and we did really did good. My grandson caught a 42 NP the first day out. We fished the Onion Patch and caught both NP and walleye. The small islands at the east end on Becky's Bay were also good for walleye. Don't miss the waterfall area, it is beautiful and the fishing was great. Great place for a shorelunch. We would all like to go back but is a long ways from central Nebraska so we have concentrated on western Ontario. Tell Debbie hello from the Nebraska Boys. You are going to enjoy this trip.
