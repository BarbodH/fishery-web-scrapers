We have never been there and I am interested in feedback from recent visitors. I tried the search but even when you put ""Cedar Lake"" in quotes it flags every post with ""Lake"" in it. So, your take on this lake and lodge would be appreciated, especially those who have been there recently. Having never caught a muskie, a little advice on when, where and how to fish for them would also be helpful. I see Pete Maina catch them on ""The Next Bite"" but perhaps this lake is unique. You can count on me to send a recap. Thanks in advance. Hooks"

With the average depth of the lake being 20', I hope Ontario doesn't have as dry a summer as last year. For that reason, I'm not sure the boat upgrade would be worth it. Would hate to buy a prop as it could be gettin shallow in areas. Will be very interested in how this trip goes for you, but first things first. Rip em up on Wine Lake."

1398415,Larry Mac,2012-02-23 19:08:00,530,"Hi HeHooksHimself, we have been fortunate to have fished Cedar lake 4 times in the last 3 years. With the help of Glenman12, we had very enjoyable fishing trips. We were able to catch a variety of species and had a great time. The lake is very easy to navigate with lots of water to fish. Glenman12 is extremely knowledgeable and helpful when it comes to Cedar Lake. Have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
