We will pay the duty for the fridge at Canadian customs and give you what you feel is a fair amount of $ for gas and your time and trouble to get the fridge to Winnipeg. If we can bring the fridge to you to help you out I will do so. Please call if you can help us out. Thanks, Rich Monticello, Mn 763-295-4228"

If this helps, I am a retired school teacher/coach, and can prove it to you if you before you take the fridge to Winnipeg. We can take the screws out of the inside/outside moulding and you can check out hte fridge any place you like. I'll even call the local police, and ask them to bring in a drug sniffing dog. I'll tell them I bought a used fridge and want to make sure there are no drugs that were forgotten in any hidden place in the fridge because we are taking it across the Canadian border. Hope this helps, Rich Thurman Monticello, MN. 763-295-4228"
