1398040,Pikehunters,2012-02-23 05:43:00,100,That site is new age hope it takes off. One way to help with it would be to ask your outfitter if he has heard of it or plans on joining!!
1398066,Skywagon,2012-02-23 07:09:00,1106,"I think some outfitters may misrepresent that it is their ""private"" lake. We (locals) don't sneak in to fish a lake, it is our right to fish these lakes. Just because an outfitter may have a boat cache or outpost cabin on the lake does not make it their ""private"" lake. Many lakes up here can be accessed by towing a boat in with a 4-wheeler, snowmobile, or flying in, I do it all the time. When you fly over and realize the patchwork of logging roads, it is easy to see, a lot of lakes can accessed by 4-wheeler. As far as people picking up information on that website, I don't know, but can say there are few enough people up here and the communities are tight enough, that at lot of locals know about most of the lakes that can be reached by vehicle, and the flying community knows about the rest."
1398071,Pikehunters,2012-02-23 07:27:00,100,Hold the phone! Just passing on what was told to me face to face when I flew out of Bromley last year from George. They advertise that you will be secluded with no interuption. Which gives merit to what you're saying. Same here if you buy a license & stamps you have the rite to fish any commonwealth waters. We where just shocked to see other people on the water.
1398078,pikeman14,2012-02-23 07:46:00,144,"That site would be very helpful, most of us come to these sites looking for information. Its funny how we all want to know every detail of a lake, but after the trip....you dont see anyone giving up their spots unless you ask them."
1398090,Mike Borger,2012-02-23 08:09:00,1554,"The difference here is you're located in N/W Ontario where there's almost more water than land.The Folyet, Chapleau, Wawa area is much more sensitive with the lakes prone to being overexploited.The fact is the MNR has implemented access restrictions on most of the lakes in this region with fly in camps. It's not LEGAL to cut a trail into them.In many cases it's quite easy to access these lakes with a variety of means. If access to these fly in lakes was a free for all these lakes would soon be fished out and a valuable part of the local economy and frankly an important part of our heritage in N/E Ontario would be wiped out.In the areas in question lakes with fly in outposts comprise less than 10% of the total number. Also the MNR hasn't granted any new commercial land use permits for outpost camps in eons, and they won't be anytime soon. The existing outposts in these regions have been there for many many years and with the many new logging roads that are encroaching, NEED some kind of protection.I don't think it's too much to ask to protect such a small % of lakes. Not only to help keep the local economy afloat, but for future generations to enjoy.It's always stuck in my craw just a bit when locals b!tch about the access restrictions. What, is 90% of the lakes in your region not enough for you to exploit? People seem to raise their hackles, right or wrong be d@mned whenever they feel their ""precious rights"" are being violated.I make these comments as a native of Ontario and someone who's enjoyed both numerous fly in trips AND bushwhacked countless times into some pretty incredible back lakes.I've never had any issues finding quality lakes to portage into. Frankly I wouldn't dream of portaging into an outpost lake anyway. The objective for me is soltitude. Why would I go to all that trouble and potentially have outpost anglers buzzing all over the lake?Obviously a touchy subject with me."
1398328,Outfitter17,2012-02-23 15:47:00,127,"Hey Ten Horse,You are basically talking about a virtual All Canada Show. www.ultimateonlinesportshow.com Is trying to start what you are talking about. The site is in the first stages and when it gets developed more I am sure they will add in extra features like some of the ones you pointed out.Just like any outdoors site or real sport show, you need to get alot of resorts on board to so there is a nice variety to choose from - to many site only have a few resorts on them, so you don't have much of a choice when searching.Pikehunters,Sorry to tell you, but there are resorts in canada that offer all inclusive fishing packages.Ours is called the Deluxe Plan and it includes:Breakfast and Dinner in our main lodge, Modern Cabin accommodations, towel and maid service daily. Guide-prepared shore lunch every day. 17.5' Lund outfitter with 50hp Honda, with unlimited gas, all your bait (no limit), any/all beverages (includes pop, beer, wine, cocktails, water, again NO LIMIT), Conservation fishing Lic., Transportation to and from our landing, and a guide for each day of your visit. Everything is included for 1 price - there are no add ons and no limit regarding consumption of food, fuel, bait, or drinks - I don't care if you drink a case of beer a day and your guided burns 15 gallons of gas driving you around, while you use 2lbs of leeches catching a ton of fish - it's included in your package."
1398375,Kwags,2012-02-23 17:18:00,48,"I have read many of your posts, Solo, both here and on IFC. I tend to agree with your take on most things and also this. But the ""Locals"" (Canadians) don't. We used to go to Rush Lake with Ivanhoe, and the last ten years, we always had people camping down on the southern end. There was a network of roads from Jerome that led to this spot, and people we talked to said that they had fished, camped, and icefished there for decades. I finally settled it with myself this way: I am driving over 1,300 miles (roundtrip) to get flown in from a paved road. I am going to sleep in a cabin and have a stove and hot water. I won't pull a boat and motor that far.I can't/won't drive the fifty miles over roads that are not kept up and risk flat tires or broken axles. If someone who lives in that area puts in the work, the lake is big enough that we can all fish and have a good time. We never bothered them, they never bothered us. That said, it seems there has been quite a bit of fuss between campers and tourists. 1. The group that was coming out of Rush 3 years ago told us the fellas camping said to them ""We're here until Tuesday, after that you guys are free to use the boats on the other lakes"". Those were Ivanhoe boats! 2. Tourists think its the outfitter's private lake, and I've read where locals get harassed when they are in a lake fishing. Think they are protecting the lake for the outfitter. Its become a real hot button up in that area, and people who grew up together and have known each other all their lives are suddenly at odds."
1398435,Jaskonie,2012-02-23 20:08:00,80,Its called American plan because in the old days the Americans couldnt possibly bring a weeks worth of food gas bait and boats in to camp from across the border. Show up and fish. Now its easy to stop at Walmart in North Bay or wherever on your way into camp and grab your grocerys etc.
1397870,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-02-22 16:31:00,235,"If the following website existed, would you use it as an initial research tool for a Canadian fishing provider?-Searchable database of all (or virtually all) Canadian fishing outfitters-Search by geography, fish species, drivein/boat-in/flyin, American Plan/Housekeeping, guide service on site etc-Search by lake to see which outfit(s) serve(s) them-Within the search results, you can read and post user reviews of specific lodges and lakesWould such a site ever be useful to you? Just curious..."
1397889,Marc63280,2012-02-22 17:15:00,309,YES!! Sounds great. A one stop shop of all your Outfitter needs.
1397905,Pikehunters,2012-02-22 17:44:00,100,"Always curious why do they call it an American Plan??Nothing in America is all inclusive?? There is always a fee above & beyond.The only plans I found all inclusive is in mexico & trust me you will pay for itWould such a site be useful hek ya but they already RRR! (walley central)Air Ivanhoe had a forum going & had to shut it down. I Give credit to the forums up & running it takes more monitoring then we can ever imagine. Knot to knock you off your horse, info is always good but watch out the bulls they can run ya over!!"
1397910,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-02-22 17:59:00,235,"Not talking about a discussion forum, more like Yelp meets Lake-Link.com with a Canadian emphasis."
1397917,Pikehunters,2012-02-22 18:12:00,100,"Ten don't take me wrong I'm a big info type of guy.R you looking to do something like this.http://www.ontariooutfittersnetwork.com/There are some outfitters that have shut down, Ive been on there waters but it's like they vanished along with the water. I would be great to find them again or find out how I could get back there!!"
1397924,Kwags,2012-02-22 18:32:00,48,I used to check Ivanhoe's forum quite often. Why did they get rid of it?
1397934,Rich B,2012-02-22 19:09:00,1081,"I would check out a website you have described. especially if it includes: ""you can read and post user reviews of specific lodges and lakes"" However, Walleye Central with it's Canada, Eh? board does a lot of the same..... Good luck, Rich B"
1398001,Guest,2012-02-22 22:07:00,0,That website has very few outfitters on it (either a new site or requesting money to join I imagine) and their location points are typical google - nowhere near the actual camp. Great idea but I think Sunset Country already does much of what you want. They do not have the review section but isn't that why we are here on walleye Central?
1398025,teddi,2012-02-23 04:42:00,349,check real outdoors web site. they have a virtual sport show on it with some outfitters on it. they are looking to make it bigger amd better in the future.
1398038,Pikehunters,2012-02-23 05:40:00,100,"According to George & Joel local people where hacking into the forum instead of joining. People would be getting info on there lakes & cutting trails to sneak in & fish. One lake that I was on 2 years ago , Lincoln, we had some surprising visitors. Told the pilot on the mid week flight where they came onto the lake at & he followed the trail to a logging road. So much for a private lake! Just goes to show takes 1 or 2 bad apples to ruin the hole bushel."
