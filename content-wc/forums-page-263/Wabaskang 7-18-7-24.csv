This made fishing fantastic in the middle lake that has many islands and points that were windswept. We demolished walleyes everyday using primarily plastics casted to these windswept points. Most of our better walleye (20"" plus) were caught in the 5 to 9 feet range. The key was to cast out and bounce the jig back to the boat, getting it away from the boat because of the shallow, clear water. There was also a good evening bite for us in the thick cabbage beds using musky size baits. 3 fish over 28 came to the boat this way. Unfortunately the wind and rain cut the amount of evening fishing to a minimum or we may have done better. For those who like to vertical jig now is the time. Fish are starting to show up on the off-shore reefs and it will only get better as the minnows start to descend out there as well. The next coming weeks should have a mix of deep reef fishing with jigs and spinner/lindy rigging along weedlines. August should be awesome for walleye as usual. Pike fishing slowed drastically for us as the water temps have pushed the trophies out to deep water. We managed several 38s but that was all we could find for size. Several of these were caught casting big plastics over the deep reefs in the big lake where the walleye guys were catching eyes. This bite will continue to be tough for pike fisherman until the water starts cooling in the middle of August. I wouldn't be afraid to troll deep diving baits over 25 to 35 feet of water if looking for your best pike action for the next few weeks. Good luck to all and I will give another report in a couple weeks. Mike"

4088978,Big Mike,2015-07-30 08:14:00,35,"I stay on the south end at Jim and Julies but I fish the entire lake. Each part of the lake has different types of fishing in my opinion. This trip as I stated earlier was spent primarily in the middle lake which is the part of the lake with all of the islands, I believe some resorts call it first lake? We dealt with 3 days of extremely heavy winds and the islands provided a perfect windswept shoreline area for us to fish. I had 4 teens with me and they wanted to cast/retrieve instead of play yoyo with a vertical jig and this worked great for us. We bounced around a milkrun that I had of about 6 spots in the middle lake, fishing each for 15 to 30 minutes and then moving on to the next. The areas south of middle lake would include Jim's part of the lake, McCloud bay, Aerobus bay, and Keynote Lake. I did not go to Keynote at all this trip as I primarily fish it in June but I did hear several good reports from there last week as well. I also did spend a few days up in Mean Lake which is up by Peffley's. Walleye bite was really good off the edges of the humps in the middle of that lake with a jig/minnow or pitching jig/plastics up onto the weedy humps and ripping them back."
