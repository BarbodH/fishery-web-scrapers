4026026,law57,2015-07-06 16:27:00,1147,"The boarder pressure lessens significantly by early July. And, you may have been earlier than a lot of Twin City traffic. It's about a 5 hour trip from the TC to I-Falls. I grocery shop in Virginia - from late May to late June hwy 53 is packed with boats - going north on Saturday morning. Going south on Friday and Saturday afternoon. I go to Canada the second or third week of June and the boarder is packed on Saturday - I come home on Thursday to miss the 'mob'. I also go in September - no problem at the boarder either way then. For about 4 weeks in late May thru late June it's hard to find a slack time to cross - except very early in the morning or very late in the day."
4026066,pjshorthorn,2015-07-06 16:50:00,5654,"I crossed the Canadian border at the Peace Bridge ( Niagara/Buffalo) on July 3rd and came back on July 5th. Both crossings took about 25 minutes . I took a look at the Canadian Security Border Administration ( CBSA ) website prior to crossing each day and the website indicated 30 minutes. The website indicates that crossing times are updated every hour 24/7/365. I can't claim this to be true, but our crossings were pretty close to being correct as published on the web.This website covers the major crossing locations. It will not publish crossing times for smaller crossing locations for obvious reasons. It also has published ""average"" crossing times for known ""high peak"" travel days like the 4th of July weekend.Check out www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca It may help you predict border crossing times on any given day.PjShorthorn"
4038577,Bitinlight,2015-07-11 19:43:00,95,"I crossed today, July 11, 2015, from Fort Francis to International Falls at 12:45 p.m.. There was no wait. Drove right up and went right through-only one car ahead of me. However, the line going into Canada was way out around the corner heading to Ranier. Looked like a long wait."
4038817,law57,2015-07-11 22:05:00,1147,Oops! I met a group from Louisville at Cotton MN about 9:30 this morning. They were headed to Lac Seul. I told them that the border would probably be good when they got there (around noon). I live pretty close to MN Hwy 53. The number of boats heading north seems to be much lower than a month ago. I thought these guys would breeze across. Guess I was wrong. That's a long drive from Louisville to Ear Falls. But they're young. Hope they have a good time.
4078658,big popi,2015-07-27 06:09:00,635,"We crossed over at I-Falls around 6:30am on Wednesday 7-15, no line & no issues even when I asked about our alcohol & I said one bottle of wine, one case of beer & one case of rum (I had one bottle). The CA Customs guy did a double take but I corrected what I said. We returned to the US on Saturday 7-25 and got to the border around 8:30am. We pulled up to the stop sign just before the bridge and there were two trucks stopped & blocking the intersection while sorting their fish. I rolled the window down & loudly said they could have picked a better place to stop & sort their stuff. On the flip side, the US Customs officers were both friendly & courteous and was a pleasant experience."
4078705,Shellback,2015-07-27 06:32:00,8083,"Usually my actual time with the border agent is 2 minutes or less. I've noticed that some vehicles can be held what seems like 10 minutes or more. It would be nice if the agent felt a more extensive check was needed for a vehicle, they could just send them to the side and process the ones who take the minimum amount of time."
4078745,jimirjr,2015-07-27 06:58:00,1149,Crossed into Ft. Francis on Fri. July 10th about 1:00pm... MAYBE 3 cars in front of us.....told the border gal that We were a Qt. of Bourbon over the limit... She passed Us right on through... Came back Sat. 18th about 8:15am and the line was perhaps 5 mins long... No hassles whatsoever...
4080314,greg2648,2015-07-27 15:29:00,80,We crossed 0n 7/4 at 0530. No wait. No problem. Came back on 7/10 at 0900. No wait. Easy.
4081474,Catman59,2015-07-28 04:28:00,345,"We crossed at Pigeon River at 9am July 4. Only vehicle heading through , took less than 1 minute. No eggs or chicken questions . The usual guns and alcohol and tobacco questions. Maybe because we have passed through there about 25 times now"
4088362,Baseline,2015-07-30 05:36:00,3207,"I'll tell you why........There is a lot more hassle getting back in to the US at Fort Francis. This started about 1 year ago. I live in Northern MN and make weekend trips 5 or 6 times a year plus 3 or 4 week long trips. For 30 years we pulled up answered a couple re-entry questions are were on our way. In the last year I've been inspected 4 times. Had to go into the office and complete a agriculture survey and declaration. Then had to listen to a 20 min lecture on immigration laws because I forgot to tell them I had an orange in my cooler. Nothing has changed with the status of me or my group of fishing buddies. None of us have ever been arrested, we all have passports and drivers licenses, we follow the laws and fishing regulations, we are all 60 plus and driving near new trucks, campers and towing boats. I don't think we fit the profile of smugglers or terrorists. I just think the management has instructed the people working there to be more picky which takes longer."
4013882,Obabikon,2015-07-01 05:25:00,2370,"There's not 20 times more people. Maybe 20% more people... but it's still up. As a ton of people have stated, 1 hour wait on a Saturday morning is pretty darn good. I wouldn't expect any sooner than that next year (assuming you arrive at the same time). If you're in a big hurry... you might want to look into driving to Baudette, MN to cross. Depending on where you're heading... it is always a smaller line."
4014482,bobbylfishermon,2015-07-01 09:15:00,241,"I'm from Omaha, Ne. and have been coming to Canada since 1985. We take I-29 STRAIGHT north and cross into Canada at Pembina ( south of Winnipeg ) In all these years the longest wait we've had is 20 minutes, coming into Canada and maybe a half hr. coming back into the states. Crossing at Pembina is a piece of cake, and it's all 4lane except the last 100 miles from the Ontario border to Vermilion Bay On........."
4017314,1K1MOA,2015-07-02 11:10:00,90,Does anyone know if the Pigeon River crossing (south of Thunder Bay) has a Nexus cardholder lane? -Thanks
4024786,LOW1,2015-07-06 08:35:00,2828,"We came back on the 4th. We use Highway 71, but instead of turning left to go to IFalls we turned right and crossed at Baudette. I had not been that way for probably 40 years. One car in front of us at the crossing. Baudette from my very brief drive through seems to be a vibrant community. But then we went down through The Big Bog - that is a desolate stretch of the universe. If there was not a line at IFalls, the Baudette route is probably 1 hour longer for us. But with a wait at Ifalls it probably evened out."
4025122,Richard B,2015-07-06 10:04:00,735,"I went though International Falls customs on Saturday, July 4th at 8:15 in the morning. In all my years of going through customs I have never ever gone right through like I did. There was less than a 5 minute wait. When we got through we looked back and there was not a single vehicle waiting in line and 2 of the 3 where open! Great timing I guess!"
4025162,Carnhzkr,2015-07-06 10:21:00,964,"I had the same experience on 7/4. Passing through FF at about 9:15 AM, I expected to see a line of vehicles stretching north then turning east, but there were none. I took the opportunity to make a couple quick purchases at the Duty Free and proceeded from there straight to the checkpoint. The border agent was very friendly. I got a little nervous, though, when she asked me to proceed forward then pull over for an agriculture check. The agent at the agriculture check asked about our produce, then helped herself to the back of my truck and opened my coolers. Once satisfied, she sent us on our way. V-Bay's previous post got me nervous, so I hit the road at an unprecedented 5:28 AM, prepared for a long wait."
4025305,Knutson21,2015-07-06 11:27:00,348,"We crossed at International Falls on 7/4 at 9:30 AM and had a one car wait in front of us. The Saturday before going into Canada at 8:45 AM we had a 3 car wait in front of us, but the line out looked to be about an hour. Which I think is pretty standard for a Saturday of fishing season. For the guy the group that spent the extra hour driving to Baudette on Saturday, you definitely spent an extra hour, because you would have breezed right through at IF/FF."
4025473,Bob_Loblaw,2015-07-06 12:45:00,109,"About four years ago I crossed back into 'Murica on the 4th of July, and that was the ONLY time I've ever had a long wait. And what a wait it was...3+ hours. Almost idled the truck out of gas!"
4025570,Aaron-IN,2015-07-06 13:23:00,500,"I hit the border in SF this past Saturday (7/4) at 1:30 PM in the afternoon, not a single car in front of me, not joking. I don't recall in 36 years that ever happening."
4026010,flntknp17,2015-07-06 16:19:00,151,Exact same for us! We crossed at IFalls headed south an hour after you and literally didn't wait one minute. Trip up was the same the Saturday before around 4pm. Matt
4011482,Guest,2015-06-30 10:35:00,0,"RSH8 responds: This is my point. How can there be 20x more people going to Canada this year than any of the last five? BTW the actual time with the Customs agent was SHORTER than in the past! Maybe others got questioned more extensively than we did. Another BTW - we left our camp 45 min earlier than usual and never stopped to get there at 8:30, half an hour or more earlier than in past years and approx the time suggested by the folks running our camp. Leaving a day early, or waiting all day Saturday with thawing fish, is not an option. If this is the new norm, we need at least two more lines at the actual Customs gate. Not much room for expansion there, I know."
4011546,jigman 2003,2015-06-30 10:51:00,981,"The last 5 years have been some of the worst for the US Dollar. Back in the 90's when I started going to ON, an hour wait at Ft. Frances on a Saturday a.m. was a short wait."
4012250,CamoHunter,2015-06-30 14:36:00,363,"Really? A 1 hour wait isn't that bad. ""If this is the new norm"" you ask?? Saturday mornings have always been a busy time. Obviously some years more than others, for no aparent reason. But I've sat through 2-3hrs before. Seriously though, suck it up cupcake! If you can't stand a little wait at the border, maybe Canada isn't the best place for your vacation...Get more ice on your fish in Ft Francis if you're that worried about fish thawing. Either that, or you need a better cooler...Though, some people aren't happy unless they have something to complain about."
4012266,Lazy Fisherman,2015-06-30 14:43:00,276,Longest wait for me was 1 hour and 45 minutes going to Canada and over 3 hours returning to the U.S. I think that was about 2006 or 2007.
4012402,Old Timer,2015-06-30 15:22:00,255,"An hour isn't bad. I 've seen two and three-hour waits thirty years ago on a Saturday. An easy way to avoid the wait is to book a trip where you come back on a weekday. If your camp can't accommodate you, pick another camp. Otherwise, you'll run into the same problem from time to time."
4012610,packpro,2015-06-30 16:18:00,695,"We are a Friday to Friday group. We hit the border at 12-1 PM on our way back to the US. Years ago.....1.5 -2 hour wait. The last three years. We hit the light in Ft. Francis and turned left. Once we were third in line, once eighth, and last year 15 cars back. Usually there are three lanes open, and each lane has two sets of officers, so they are processing six cars at a time. This year being 15 cars back I think we were through in 15-20 minutes. Haven't turned right to go into town for four years."
4012778,BreezyPoint,2015-06-30 17:13:00,1581,If I thought I was going to wait more than an hour I would just drive down the road to Baudette and cross there. I have never waited more than a minute or two there.Frank
4013066,bkw67,2015-06-30 18:37:00,70,What can I expect at 6-7 pm on a Monday night at the International Falls/Ft Francis crossing north. I'm used to crossing at 5:00 am.Sent from my VS980 4G using Tapatalk
4013218,law57,2015-06-30 19:28:00,1147,I drove up on 3/17. I got I-falls about noon. It took 1.5 hours - 1.6 mile backup. I had a book on CD I was listening to - no big deal. I leave for home on Thursday evening - no wait at customs on the way back.
4013690,Aspencreek,2015-06-30 22:25:00,2911,"You can probably expect no line or at least no more than 5-6 cars.I'm a Friday to Friday camp guest too! Drive up on thurs stay in FF on thurs nite and on the water by 2pm fishing. And I usually have the lake to myself on Saturday while everyone else is battling the lines, and traffic up 502. Heaven on earth!"
4009530,Guest,2015-06-29 19:38:00,0,"Waited in line to get back to the US for one hour starting 8:30 AM Sat 27 June. The line went way back into Ft. Frances. There was a similar line the previous Saturday. In past years we could always just turn into the customs area directly if we got to FF before 9 or even 9:30. Anyone know why the line is so much longer this year? My wife sez the economy is better, but is it so much better that the numbers of cars going to Canada has increased by a factor of 20 or more in one year?"
4010034,outdoorsron,2015-06-29 22:21:00,843,"Hello: The reason for long lines is because there are more cars in line. HA HA HA. An hour wait is not long in my opinion, I have been in line for 2 or more hours before going both ways in and out. You must have been there at a prime crossing time. I now try to cross between 2:30 am and 6:30 am if possible. Usually no lines. Good Luck O - R"
4010146,kzoofisher,2015-06-30 03:24:00,5144,"Heightened security from attacks in France, Libya and Tunisia might be adding to it, too. Or other people are trying to beat the two hour wait and have gotten out of bed earlier."
4010170,Iowa Hawkeye,2015-06-30 04:19:00,90,"We were there also Saturday around 9. Longest line we have seen, but also the fastest moving line we have been in. Took just over an hour, the two blonde border agents made the wait worth it, very cheerful."
4010266,Obabikon,2015-06-30 05:40:00,2370,"Strengthening US dollar has helped the fishing tourism industry. Almost resort I've talked to is ""UP"" this year. So, that's going to be the big problem. Try not crossing on Saturdays... or catching it early in the AM or later in the day (6PM). If none of that's possible... an hour wait isn't the worst thing. Just be prepared for it."
4010394,tv4fish,2015-06-30 06:23:00,2694,"We also crossed about that time - took 1 hour and 17 minutes (yeah, one of my guys kept track ) What ticked us off were the guys who would ""cut-in"" on those residential streets that we were supposed to not block. I guess they all thought they were ""special""."
4010554,Bakefish,2015-06-30 07:18:00,1077,I've waited 4 hours in the past on the way back to the States. Back when the Olympics were in Canada we waited 6 hours to cross going up.
4011050,strength22,2015-06-30 08:51:00,49,"Who cares...you were in Canada fishing. I had to miss the trip this year. I would wait 3 hours to go fishing for 10 days up there right now. With a smile on my face,"
4011146,stjoeguy,2015-06-30 09:19:00,979,"Saturday morning is probably just a busy time of day. Last Saturday at 5:15 PM, we drove right up to the US entry booth with nobody in front of us or behind us. About 15 seconds of ""where are you from, where have you been, what were you doing, bringing anything back besides fish, welcome home, have a safe trip"" and we were on our way."
4011330,Guest,2015-06-30 10:00:00,0,the place we go changed to a friday in/out schedule. No more waits!
