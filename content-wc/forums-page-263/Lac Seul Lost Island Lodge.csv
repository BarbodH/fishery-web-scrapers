4078698,Mike Kansas,2015-07-27 06:29:00,1463,"Just got back from Lost Island Lodge and had a great week. Caught more Walleye than we deserved with most of them coming off of deep water reefs in 15' to 22' of water. Fished some new areas for us this time around Pine Island Point and east of it. Lots of nice fish in the above slot range with the biggest being 28"". This is our second trip to Lac Seul this year and during both trips we caught a lot more than in the past in the above slot range. Thanks to Ontario and their slot limit which is surely working to the fish and the fisherman's benefit. Hot colors for the week were Gold Glitter Jigs and Purple Glitter Jigs and multi colored jigs with Char Pink and Char Silver. Lots of what I call hanger bites where you just feel the fish's weight and you better set the hook when you do. Thanks to all the folks at Lost Island Lodge with special thanks to our guide Basil. The wives we had on the trip love Basil because he will bait their hooks, take their fish off and even net their Northerns. Oh yeah my Brother In Law caught the biggest Pike I have seen in years a big fat girl that was pushing 47"". Mike Kansas"

Jim grew up in the bush, raised a bear cub for a pet, who thought he was the family dog, was housed trained, would do tricks and went everywhere Jim did, we loved the bear stories and there were many!! Great people, great camp, and the fishing was spectacular, had a 75 fish day where 20 of those fish were between 6-7lbs,,,,,,,,, JADED the wife and I for life...... Nothing but FOND MEMORIES of Lost Island, THANKS!!!!"

These folks will bend over backwards to make sure you are well taken care of and that you enjoy yourself to the fullest! Yes, they are good friend's of mine which is why I know you were well cared for. For anybody thinking about a trip to Lac Seul, you would definitely want to consider Lost Island Lodge! So MK, since your brother-in-law caught the biggest fish, is he getting a big head? Better take him down a notch or two! 1DIRTBALL"
4079290,Mike Kansas,2015-07-27 09:46:00,1463,He was pretty stoked about his Pike. It is without a doubt the biggest fish he has ever caught. I wouldn't want to bust his bubble so I think I will just listen to him brag all winter. Mike Kansas
4079570,bobbylfishermon,2015-07-27 11:19:00,241,"Glad to hear Shane and his wife have taken over the camp, Jim was always worried about the camp staying in the family. I saw Shane's son guiding Babe Winklemen out of Lost Island Lodge, on the Outdoor Channel, brought back a lot of memories and smiles..."
4079882,Hump,2015-07-27 12:57:00,578,Mike: I agree with you on Ontarios slot. It is working. We had the best fishing ever this year and we said that last year. Hard to get eaters! glad you had a great trip.
4089226,jheimsch,2015-07-30 09:59:00,38,"Mike, Glad to hear you did so well. We are leaving tomorrow and stay near Mahkwa Lodge. We get as far as Pine Point coming from the west. Plan to use your glitter jigs. Did you spend any time around Pine Pt. or west of that. What bait was working best----any artificial?? Thanks, John"
4089330,Mike Kansas,2015-07-30 10:38:00,1463,"John, We did fish a couple of reefs and a large mud flat straight east of the Indian Reservation and it was holding fish but we spent most of our time east of Pine Point and than back south and turning west towards Bear Narrows. Our best luck every day came fishing the reefs in those areas. Lots of fish on almost every reef but a lot of suspended fish. When we found them on the bottom we enjoyed our best fishing. We spent all our time jigging and Gold Glitter was a hottie. When it was overcast Purple worked well. Minnows were all we used with the exception of a few times increasing the baits profile by adding a small twister tail or paddle minnow in Gold, White or Char and still having a minnow with it. Good Luck and be safe. Mike Kansas"
