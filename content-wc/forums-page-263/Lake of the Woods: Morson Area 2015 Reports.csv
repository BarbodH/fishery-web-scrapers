3949265,lemon,2015-06-09 08:23:00,5,Any particular color jig outperforming the rest? What oz jig you using?
3950073,FishinFreaks,2015-06-09 12:02:00,386,Any reports of the bite on the reefs? Or mainly points still? Heading up tomorrow. Forecast looks better than I've ever had up there. Dying to go now.
3950257,Redline,2015-06-09 13:11:00,73,It looks amazing. We always go Fathers Day weekend and this year it seems so late. I wish we had this weeks weather. Seriously enjoy it! Give us a report when you get back.
3953649,J-Man,2015-06-10 10:50:00,191,"Another great week of fishing on Lake of the Woods out of Morson! We had decent weather for daytime fishing hours most of the week depsite rains of 1"" and 0.5"" on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings after most people had come in from fishing and another 0.8"" on Saturday to start the new week. Walleyes were all over the water column. Many boats reports some shallower bites and deeper bites in the same day. Anywhere from 6-10 and then 30-35 feet was working for multiple boat groups. Fish up to 29 inches were landed and released. Shallow flats gave way to points as the week went on. Live bait was the most effective, with minnow sales being very brisk again. There was even a couple reports of good fishing on a reef or two as well. That would be early in most years, but you can't argue with the fish. Good and bad news when they are all over. Pick some structure and get your lines in the water. Don't overthink. Just fish! Move on if you cover the area in 15-20 mins and aren't getting bit and/or aren't showing anything on your sonar. Northerns were snapping pretty good in shallow bays in Obabikon as well as some parts of Sabaskong Bay for our guests. Smallies seemed to be eating good as well. With walleyes mixed in on crank baits being cast into boulder shorelines. Crappies were not super shallow, but were near shallow spawning areas. Our favourite crappie whisperer managed to find some numbers in 24 feet after working his way out from very shallow. Great week on the water. Lake is coming up nicely. Reaching the 40th percentile as of Tuesday's report from the water control board site. Water temps sitting at 64 or so in the afternoons when the sun is out. Good luck on the water. J-Man"
3966234,J-Man,2015-06-14 20:23:00,191,"The week started with a downpour on Saturday afternoon, which led many new arriving guests to sit it out after arriving, but the weather co-operated pretty well the rest of the week. With the stable weather pattern, fishing was steadily fantastic for most of our anglers. Walleyes were biting to the tune of 130 per day AVG for one of our groups. They fish about 10am to 10pm for all six days of their trip. One boat in the group had a particularly stellar week. Their best day being 160 walleyes and the slowest day being 91. They started with shallower humps (12-15 feet of water) and moved to deeper humps as the week went on and water temps came up. Big fish numbers were down for that crew (4 boats total with 18 anglers) this year, but they did land fish up to 29 inches. As well, for those of you that say they are no walleyes east of Morson, they fish nearly the entire time EAST OF MORSON! Bass fishing was excellent over the past week as well. Two boats targeting smallies had one of their best trips ever. Fishing 8 days, 1 of those boats landed 450 smallies. No giants, but several 18 and 18.5 inchers. Mostly all shallow up tight to shorelines with wind blowing in. The boys also picked up walleyes and northern regularly as well. Northerns were active as well, both cast into shallow bays and hitting walleye spinners trolled deeper. No sign of the may fly hatch on the surface yet, but there have been larvae in fish being filleted. Walleyes and bass have been burping up crayfish like crazy so keep that in mind when selecting your technique and presentation. Lake levels are still coming up and nearing seasonal averages. Water temps jumped over 70 and up to 75 in shallow bays with the warming trend and two days of hot, sunny conditions on Friday and Saturday. Water temps at the dock were sitting around 70 as of 7pm on Sunday evening. Muskie opener is a week away and conditions look great for an action packed opening weekend on the 20th. Get your hooks sharpened up! J-Man"
3968642,lemon,2015-06-15 14:41:00,5,"fished thurs afternoon-sun morning. Fishing was very good. Mostly fished reefs. Biggest was fish were 27"", 25.5"", and 25"""
3971386,J-Man,2015-06-16 10:21:00,191,"After viewing the latest information update from LWCB's website, I need to adjust the lake level report slightly. With increasing outflows at the Kenora Dam, levels are actually losing ground to seasonal normal elevation, despite overall increases in lake level. Lake was up a couple inches over the previous week, but is in the 35th percentile now *down from the 40th percentile) so has a ways to go before reaching the seasonal average (50th percentile.) Cheers. J-Man"
4024746,J-Man,2015-07-06 08:24:00,191,"Missed the last few weeks of reports, but action has been good. Here is a summary from the past 3 weeks, which included the mayfly hatch that didn't seem to slow fishing done much at all, if any. Walleyes have been on the reefs for most of the entire 3 weeks since my last report. Walleyes Fishing has been well above average. Excellent to fabulous most days/weeks. Another 30"" and several 29"" class walleyes were caught and released as well as more 25-28 inchers than we can count. There have been some slower days post-weather front or when things get dead calm. Reef fishing can be anywhere from 6-10 or 20-30 depending on the depths around the reef/hump. Mark the shallow spot and work the reef from shallow to deep along any slopes and then off the edges where it flattens out. Do this for the entire area around the reef. Fish will sometimes stack up on certain parts of a reef/hump depending on weather, wind, time of day, etc, etc. Work it hard and then move on if you aren't picking up any fish. With the advances in GPS mapping, you can find structure of this nature much quicker and easier than ever before. Most people will vertical jig reefs, but there are still plenty of anglers that will troll spinners over them and catch fish. You can also troll crank baits and produce action. Bait selection seems less important than matching your technique to the presentation you prefer. Northern fishing has been hot, particularly in Obabikon Lake when it is overcast or the temps cool a bit. Muskie action has been slower to begin with, which is a common trend when the weather is up and down like it has been. Activity has been good the last few days with fish using multiple structures from shallow bays with vegetation to rock points and boulders. Good luck on the water. J-Man"
4028073,Shorelunch,2015-07-07 10:47:00,554,"We had outstanding walleye fishing out of Morson last week. My 11 year old caught a 27"" and 28"" walleye back-to-back up in Miles Bay and we caught perfect size eaters all day long in and near Sunset Channel. Fished reefs and wind blown points primarily using spinners/bottom bouncers/minnows or leeches in 12 - 24 feet. Walleyes favored minnows 3-1 over leeches and plastics for our crew. Northerns were hitting spinner baits in the back bays really well and smallies liked the new shadow rap and shad raps along with plastics on the boulder shores and rock points. Here's a picture of a wall cloud a week ago Saturday in Sunset Channel - was quite a sight. Had a great stretch of weather from 6/28 - 7/4 and great fishing, too."

3885321,J-Man,2015-05-19 09:00:00,191,"2015 Walleye Opener Report Great start to the season on Saturday! Multiple long time opener anglers commented on having their best opening day fishing ever. A nice day with relatively light winds and sunshine produced action for all on the water. Biggest walleye reported from resort guests was 27"". Multiple 25 inchers and a 26 incher were also put on the board to start the year. All big fish were released. Action seemed to be all over the water column with fish biting in 5 feet up to 25 feet. The most common depth mentioned was the 22-23 foot range. Minnows, leeches and crawlers all worked well. One boat lost track of fish over 20"" while jigging with minnows. Trolling spinners was successful for many anglers also. Pike were eating crankbaits and a few nice bass were caught as well. One was a giant while fishing over 20+ feet jigging up from the depths for Lake Trout in Whitefish Bay. No lakers were contact by the brave anglers that ventured from Morson to Sioux Narrows the long way around in the strong NE winds and rain on Sunday. HARDCORE!! Sunday morning produced good action as well. Another 27"" and one just under 26"" were CPR'd by a one group of 6 anglers in 2 boats. Most boats in camp gave up by noon due to hard rain and strong NE wind. A couple boats snuck out Monday in the late afternoon and early evening after 24 hours off the water, but action was slow during the cold front. Water temps on Opening Day were 51 degrees and came up to 54 degrees after a day of sunshine. Surface temp here at the dock in the bay on Tuesday morning was 47.5 after a couple of very chilly nights on Sunday and Monday. We have a warming trend to start the short week after Victoria Day. Action will pick up quickly with that in the mix. We expect a lot of nice fish for the busy Memorial Weekend! Good luck on the water."
3890945,Bill Krejca,2015-05-20 20:58:00,6107,"Wow, Morson to S N the long way in wind and rain - That just stops somewhat short of what I would consider on the fun side of the action. Bill"
3906002,J-Man,2015-05-26 09:45:00,191,"Memorial Weekend 2015 Weather stabilized the Tuesday after opener and a warming trend began that is holding through early this week. The great weather produced exceptional fishing the rest of opening week and through Memorial Weekend. Again, multiple long time Memorial Weekend groups declared the fishing to be the best they have ever had by a wide margin. Combined with the perfect weather, their trips were deemed best Memorial Weekend trips overall going back more than 30 years. Walleyes were grabbing minnows like crazy in a range of depths again. Anglers had action in 9-13 feet as well as 20-25 and as deep as 25-35 at times. Trolling spinners was the most common presentation, but many anglers opted for vertical jigs as well. The biggest fish reported were a pair of 28.5"" personal bests and a 29"" personal best. Multiple 25s and 26 were caught as well. Again, all those big fish were CPR'd (Caught, Photographed, Released.) Northerns were hitting crank baits being trolled along shorelines as well as when casting. Obabikon Lake produced 38"" and 42"" biggies for one angler. Smallmouth bass were hitting every kind of presentation they saw. Multiple 16-18 inch smallies were let go as well as one real nice 19.5"" beauty. Water temps came up to 59.5 degrees at the dock on Monday. There are some warmer temps in the forecast this week so that should continue to climb. Water levels have come up as well, with a 7 inch rise listed on the Water Control Board's website from May 14-21 (Thur-Thur.) The lake is now in the 25th percentile for this time of year, compared to holding at the 15th for most of the spring since ice-out. Lake of the Woods is the place to be for multi-species action. Get on the water and enjoy the hot bite. J-Man"
3908786,Shorelunch,2015-05-27 07:11:00,554,"We fished out of Morson this past Saturday - Tuesday. Justin's reports are spot on. We caught walleyes on about every point we fished - ones with sand and rip rap nearby were the best - in 12 - 16 feet - jigs and minnows and caught them on jigs and plastics when we ran out of minnows. Caught a 26, 24 and a 21 plus plenty of great eaters. We also caught plenty of smallies up in about 4 - 6 feet in boulders and northerns loved the crankbaits. We fished northerns in Obabikon (got through the narrows in a 19' boat - just need to be a little more patient - and caught smallies in the Sunset channel. Great weather and fantastic fishing. Back up in a couple weeks."
3929825,J-Man,2015-06-02 16:29:00,191,"Post Memorial Day fishing was very good to continue the hot bite to start the season. 17-23 feet of water was the most common claim from our anglers. Minnows were jumping out of the tanks and into buckets and live wells like crazy, but we did sell some leeches as well. When the bite is on, your bait selection is less important than matching the proper presentation to your technique of choice. Points and shorelines were the ticket to walleye success. Smallies and pike were active again with a 40"" northern eating a minnow on a spinner to give one angler an exciting morning! The cold front on Thurs/Fri did not seem to effect fishing at all. One boat of 3 anglers landed a 25, 25 and 28 during the day after the overnight frost warning brought temps near freezing. Nice when each person in the boat can landed a beauty. Weather has been stable through the weekend, but we do have some showers and possible storms called for in the next couple days. Water levels are coming up a little more slow now as they crack open the **** to try and bring Winnipeg River levels up a little bit too. Water Control Board website indicated lake level still in the 25th percentile so still low for time of year. Assume a couple feet less than your maps and GPS software default settings. Surface temp at the dock on Tueday afternoon was 59 degrees. Life is better at the lake. Get out on the water wherever and whenever you can. Cheers.J-Man"
3945881,Shorelunch,2015-06-08 08:10:00,554,We fished out of Morson this past weekend. Friday was a beauty of a day. Fished walleyes along points in the Sunset channel area and did well. A few mid-20 inchers and plenty of nice eaters. Jigs and minnows and plastics in 8 - 14 feet. Saturday we shifted gears to smallies/northerns. Did well with plastics and cranks for smallies on boulder/rip rap bays/points and the northerns liked spinner baits and crank baits in weed bays. Saturday afternoon the weather turned windy and rainy. We caught enough walleyes for dinner on local points just out of Hanson Bay with jigs and plastics in 16 feet. Sunday - back to smallies. Pitched plastics and threw pink XRaps - both did very well. Back up in a few weeks.
3946049,Redline,2015-06-08 08:55:00,73,"I'm surprised you found the Walleye's that shallow. I head up a week from Wednesday and was thinking with this weeks warm weather, we'd start to find them on the humps in deeper water."
3946673,Shorelunch,2015-06-08 13:07:00,554,"Yep so were we. They went shallow when the wind came up over the weekend. At least that's where I'd start fishing - and go deeper if not there. There were plenty of boats fishing humps, too, but plenty fishing points."
3946689,Redline,2015-06-08 13:13:00,73,Did you try for any Lakers? I want to go jigging for them our first day. Never done it before.
3946929,Shorelunch,2015-06-08 15:01:00,554,Nope. Not sure if the trolly into Whitefish is working or not. I'd imagine they're deeper than 8-14' though.
