3934609,Shorelunch,2015-06-04 07:24:00,554,"I hope it's a success, is managed and stocked well, and has fair prices. Definitely needed up there with Lowes and Bergland closed and the Morson store many moons ago. We'll check it out Friday."
3948025,Laker10,2015-06-08 21:07:00,100,"I stopped at the new store last week, very nice and gas pumps too."
3949193,1700SS,2015-06-09 08:11:00,104,Do they sell Beer?
3949337,pjshorthorn,2015-06-09 08:41:00,5654,You can only buy beer or other spirits at a store regulated by the Canadian govt. LCBO or Beer Store. It isn't quite like the US where you can walk into a grocery store and caryy out your beer or wine. PjShorthorn
3950969,Bill Krejca,2015-06-09 16:15:00,6107,"If I remember correctly, the store which closed a few years ago sold alcoholic beverages, due to it being removed from the normal traffic flow, or at least that is what I was told was the reason they were able to do so. Bill"
3951041,Obabikon,2015-06-09 16:57:00,2370,"I went in there yesterday... looks very nice. Shelves aren't quite full yet, but it'll be a great store! They have a spot for an LCBO, but the store has to be open 6-12 months before you can apply. Maybe next year... but they are planning on have a store in there!"
4087258,ftfarms,2015-07-29 15:22:00,444,Anybody know there hours of business?
4087466,BUELL CR,2015-07-29 16:38:00,6,They close at 9pm I was their 3 weeks ago and the shelves were empty
4088466,Obabikon,2015-07-30 06:10:00,2370,"I've been there several times, and never seen the shelves ""empty"". Maybe they were getting a delivery soon. It isn't a place to do ALL your shopping, but if you forgot something or need more milk... its perfect. I try to stop in a buy something every time I go to town."
