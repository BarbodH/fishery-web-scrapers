I stopped at the Pembina store just before the border and they didn't have premium cigars. The attendant said that if I went across the street and bought something else they would have cigars. Being confused and in a hurry, I didn't mess around with that. Does anyone know exactly where to get duty free cigars going from US to Canada at the Pembina crossing?"
