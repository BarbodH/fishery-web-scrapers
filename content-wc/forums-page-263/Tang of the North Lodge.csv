4080034,Stu,2015-07-27 13:48:00,472,Has anyone ever been here? It's only $775 for 7 days. That almost seems too cheap.

It was the first lake I ever fished in Canada, and the first time I ever fished for walleye. We ended up figuring out a pretty good pattern and catching quite a few walleyes. We caught pike until we were bored of it. The biggest challenge and the most fun of the week for us was figuring out how to catch lake trout. Ended up catching several, which was thrilling for us since we had no clue what the heck we were doing. There are some easy portage lakes that we visited, and several others which we didn't. I think I've seen it listed somewhere that there are 11 lakes you can fish out of Tang? I was there the 1st week of August and Tang was already closed for the season. I believe they are only open for 8-9 weeks each year. It appeared to be a nice place. Well-maintained. Nice boats for a fly-in lake. I have seen reviews and comments on their Facebook page that make it seem like a good lodge. Disclaimer: I hold Lawrence in very high regard because it was my first Canadian lake."

The walleye fishing the last couple years has been better than in the past. The slot limit is working as a couple mornings this year (Memorial Day weekend) my son and I had trouble keeping fish, they were all over 20""s. Trout fishing is good and although we don't fish them, have seen some 36""+ Northerns caught while fishing eyes. Very reasonable prices and a short flight from Nestor Falls."
4080450,Slab Seeker,2015-07-27 16:17:00,14,Plus flight cost of $210 per person. Still inexpensive for a week trip. Obviously for the price not alot of amenities you find elsewhere but sounds like lots of options to fish different areas.Got a quick reply to email on season length. Walleye opener until July 1
4080514,Guest,2015-07-27 16:31:00,0,I'm guessing it's changed since I stayed there in 1965 with my grandfather on my first fly in. I was 14. Had a great time though. Caught a lot of walleye.
