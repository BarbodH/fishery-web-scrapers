You can preview the mapping on the Navionics website by clicking on the web app, whats on the web app will be on the chip. There are 2 views of detail available Nautical Chart and SonarChart which comes on Platinum and Nav+ here are some screen shots to show the difference. The Blue sonar icon on the lower left indicates SonarChart view, so if you got the web app be sure to click on the sonar icon. What Sonar do you have?"
4073554,dane56,2015-07-24 12:21:00,18,Has anyone fished Gullrock Lake. I am looking at a first time trip to Golden Hook camp. Thanks
4073754,Pezman38,2015-07-24 13:51:00,3196,"Yes, went for 10 years, haven't been back in the last 4 but I do miss it.Golden Hook is a nice camp, I stayed at Wrights."
4074554,outdoorsron,2015-07-24 23:01:00,843,Hello Dane : I also have fished Gullrock but haven't been there for a few years. I have friends that have been going there for over 10 years. They are heading there right now and will be fishing there by Saturday afternoon. They are staying at Wrights. When will you be going ? Need fishing reports ? They always do good on Walleye and Northern. If you need any more information just contact me. Good Luck. O - R
4076090,Fishin Fun,2015-07-25 20:04:00,218,"I've fished that lake for many, many years. Have not been back the past couple of years, but want to go back. It is a lake that you don't have to worry about tearing off your lower unit. The best year I've ever had fishing was at Gullrock about 5 years ago. So many fish. You'll love it. I used to stay at Golden Hook when it was called Honers Gullrock Bay Camp. Nice camp at the time with nice cabins. Let us know how it goes."
4076170,GWC,2015-07-25 21:09:00,1021,My first trip was in 2008. We've had 7 one week trips then skipped the last 3 years. We're headed back in 2016. It's a great lake & I'm sure you will enjoy your trip. We've caught a lot of nice walleye & several Northern's in the 40 inch plus range. Haven't had a bad trip yet. Looking forward to our trip next year.
4076682,Habitual Eyer,2015-07-26 07:44:00,144,"Decided to go closer to home for family Canada trip couple weeks ago (destinations thru the Soo are 12 for us..Gullrock 18-20). Did homework and went to lake with good reputation. Great family get-away but spent week graphing everything I could get my boat over and finding little. Gullrock I graph a lot and find a lot....always. Usually pulling fish all day. So Canada itch still not scratched for this summer and trying to figure out how to get back to Gullrock. Always stay at Wrights as location on lake is best, camp is top notch, and rates as good or better than anyone up that stretch of 105. Shorter drive thru Soo was nice, and pretty country up there.....but sometimes it's better to just put the pedal down and hammer out the miles for a slam dunk. After jumping around to lakes too numerous to count the last 30 years...Gullrock as close to a slam dunk as I have been able to find."
4077042,dane56,2015-07-26 10:28:00,18,Thanks so very much to all of you for your replies. Sounds like we have something to look forward to! Another question. Does anyone know of a place online where one can download a countour map of Gullrock. I have tried to find one but have not been able to yet. Thanks again everyone
4077650,tackleman,2015-07-26 16:58:00,444,"i think you will find that most of the camps on gullrock have a map you can buy or will give you one. however, if you have the Canada navionics chip in your gps they have the depth contours on them. you will enjoy your trip to gullrock, there are a few fish in it and should you have any trouble finding them, your camp owner will show you where to go, don't feel shy in joining the group when you see people fishing in a location, generally speaking I find most people who fish gullrock are friendly and won't be annoyed if you give your luck a try at the same spot they are trying, fish the islands, fish the flats, fish the river entrances. good luck, see you out there."
4077658,dane56,2015-07-26 17:11:00,18,Thanks Tackleman. I do have a Canada chip. I didn't even think about that. Duh!My son and I are really looking forward to the trip.
4078834,Coyoteman,2015-07-27 07:39:00,209,"Headed up there the 14th for trip number 10. We stay at 5 lakes. You will not be disappointed, plenty of fish in plenty of different places. The navionics chip does a good job on gullrock."
