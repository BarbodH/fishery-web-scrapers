4080930,muskyroller,2015-07-27 19:46:00,56,"Hey Ben, Not going to Onaway until next year. I took the year off this year from the family. Actually heading up to Cliff Lake on Friday for 8 days of musky chasing! Can't wait. We'll be back up that third week of June, just like last year. My dad and crew were up last month and did okay. Got chased off the water by lightning half the days. Steve Bates aka the ""muskyroller"" ) haha"
4081946,Hoosier Boilermaker,2015-07-28 07:28:00,15,Ben Pat and I thoroughly enjoyed our time with you at Lac Suel. Our trip was everything that we had dreamed of. We are already looking forward to our time there next year even though we went in this trip expecting this to be a one time thing. Linda has booked us for the same cabin as well as you for our guide again. We do hope to be able to spend some time looking for Muskie next time.
4084378,BenBeattie,2015-07-28 18:01:00,232,"Good luck with the muskies up at Cliff, Steve. Post some pics when you get back.Dave, that's great news. Looking forward to seeing you and Pat again next summer. DOn't forget to send me some pics of those big large mouth this winter. Tell Pat I say hello!"
4072138,Hoosier Boilermaker,2015-07-23 19:49:00,15,"Just returned from Sioux Lookout on Monday the 21st. This was my first time on Lac Suel and stayed at Moosehorn Lodge. The lodge and service is just fantastic. Ben, our guide really put us on the walleye. Did not catch any monsters but got our share of 25 and 26 inch fish. Having shoulder problems so wife and I chose not to go after pike or muskie. Fished 5 days and 4 of them were in the rain. Did not hurt fishing. Was impressed with the condition of 502 as years ago I was in Sioux Lookout for a fly-in and the road was pretty rough. Caught all of our fish in 20 ft of water in minnows."
4072178,stjoeguy,2015-07-23 20:01:00,979,Good report. Thank you. We're heading back to the Lac Seul area in September and looking forward to it.
4072298,rnnonmt,2015-07-23 20:50:00,992,Glad you had a great time. Who was your guide Ben and what area of the mighty Lac were you on?
4072378,Hoosier Boilermaker,2015-07-23 21:28:00,15,Stayed at Moosehorn Lodge at Sioux Lookout on Pelican Lake. Went down through rapids to Lac about 45 minutes. Guide was Ben Beattie at Moosehorn.
4072442,rnnonmt,2015-07-23 22:08:00,992,Ben is a great resource and a well known guide.... you probably couldn't have chosen a better guide.
4074306,Mark Oakley,2015-07-24 20:15:00,21,i can give him a run for his money.
4074338,tlars,2015-07-24 20:41:00,137,I'd fish with Ben any day. He is a great guide.

4076234,Mark Oakley,2015-07-25 21:37:00,21,yes he is a good guide. knows his stuff
4076762,muskyroller,2015-07-26 08:10:00,56,"I can share something really cool about Ben... Last year our group was staying on the west side at Onaway Lodge. We were doing well, fishing wise, but every night Ben and I would email reports back and forth. I was letting him know what was going on the west side and he was giving me the report from the central/east end of Lac Seul. Now, the great thing about Ben is this, we've never met. I've never hired him as a guide. He was wiiling to share info and take the time to email (literally) every night for a week straight. If I ever venture back to that side of Lac Seul and Moosehorn...you can guarantee I'll be in the boat with Ben, at least one day!"
