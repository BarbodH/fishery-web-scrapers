This is my first fall trip to Canada and looking forward to it. Any advice on fishing walleye this time of year in that area? (Depth, presentations, etc.) If lakes are turning, any thoughts on fishing in those conditions? Is it safe to assume the large northern will be found off the normal points, etc.? Am I dreaming that the first frost may have happened and the mosquito's are history? I'll stop there, finding out if there are mermaids that deliver cold beers to our boat may be asking a bit much; kinda like hoping the bugs may be gone. Thanks in advance for the advice!"
4080914,law57,2015-07-27 19:10:00,1147,"I'm thinking of going back to Canada in September too. The camp I go to will have bear hunters then - but they may (or may not) have a cabin available. Sometimes they drain the water lines to all un-rented cabins. Weather can be brutal in September. Even the second or third week. Highs in the 40's, wind, rain - just brutal. That's the bad news... Bring lots of warm cloths and good rain gear. If the lake your are going to fish is a big lake, be prepared for big wind and waves. Bring extra gloves and small towels - keep your hand warm. The good news - it can be beautiful - mid-40's at night 60/70's in the daytime. I've got sunburned and ran for shore during hail storms in September. The point is be prepared for the weather. Today there are good weather internet sites that can give you a pretty good idea of what o expect during your week of fishing. September walleye location is different than June. But I've found rally good fishing in 15-25 feet. I doubt the lake will turn over before the third week of September - unless there' Late August and early September are unseasonably cold. Northern's are always where the perch/walleye are. If you're catching eater walleye - so are the local northern. Have fun - we can compare notes in October!"

4081786,SinOrSwim,2015-07-28 06:59:00,1528,"We have gone in September for many years now. Anywhere from the 10th to the 30th. Usually about the 10th to the 17th. You have to plan for cold weather but in the last 4\5 years I have worn long sleeves about 4/5 times. Most of the time it is shorts and tshirt or at best shorts and a fleece. We had one day last year that I wore all my rain gear because it was cold. First time in 4 years at least. Not saying don't be prepared for cold but don't let it scare you. I don't even take long pants. I wear shorts and then my rain bibs. That way I can shed the rain gear as it warms up. Haven't taken a pair of pants in over 10 years other than rain gear. Fish will be deeper. Find the drop offs and fish in the 20 to 30 ft range in the mornings. Drop offs that are next to deep water. Then, again if I knew the fishing answer I wouldn't be hiring a guide. LOL"
4083290,new hips,2015-07-28 13:08:00,498,"We fished the 3rd week of September one year. Layers works best, it was a pretty cold week. Rubber boots a must.....to keep your feet warm. Fish were always deeper, start at 24' and work out. Wind was factor, especially for boat control......Lac Seul.On the plus side hardly any bugs....there all hiding.I do remember one day I had on everything I had and was still cold. when I come in from fishing it has to be bad !!!!!!!!!"
4086098,mr-fish,2015-07-29 08:27:00,58,Since This Your First Trip This Time Of Year ... Keep In Mind That The Daylight Hours Are Much Shorter ...
4086186,1K1MOA,2015-07-29 08:50:00,90,"Such an obvious point you make, but I was totally forgetting about that! It is much more realistic to think about dusk and early evening fishing options this time of year. Thanks for the reminder. Thanks to everyone else for your suggestions as well, much appreciated!"
4086450,mr-fish,2015-07-29 09:34:00,58,Speaking For Experience ... Son And I Had Always Fished Early In June ... Had A Routine Down For The Long Daylight ... Just Made Me Feel Like We Were Fishing A Half Day From The Spring Trips ... lol
4087314,dog2,2015-07-29 15:46:00,198,our group has been going the last week of September for the last couple of years.Weather is hit or miss .Snow one day 70 degrees the next. One year it rained 4 of 7 days the following year snow on Sat .and Sun.60+ the rest of the week.Fishing was outstanding 7' to 40' depths ;pike from dying reeds to the bottom. They worked up and down the depths with the weather and temperature!The biggest issue was and is the wind!!On some water bodies in the Nakina area a sw wind is not your friend. All the replies have been a good general over view of what you can expect.Just go with the flow adjust as needed and enjoy your trip .
