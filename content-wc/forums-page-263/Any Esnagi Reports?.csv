4078266,halfmoon007,2015-07-26 20:39:00,121,"Were heading in to the big north end cabin with Mar-mac at Esnagi on Aug 23, so we will be anxiously awaiting your guys report. This is our first trip to Esnagi. 4 of us will be jigging plastic 90 % of the time and the other 2 will be bottom bouncing spin & glow's and harnesses with a crawler. so color is a big heads up for us. From talking to Ken Johnson at the Novi Michigan show this winter/spring it sounded like the the three ventures in ( north to adventures, Mar mac, Lodge 88 and White river air are all going on their own ) Ken said his wife and himself have Mar-mac lodge and the Big north end Cabin on Esnagi. Pretty sure he said White river air has the smaller Marmeeke north end cabin. I see as of today Mar-mac has their on stand alone web site, So hey guys. go slay-em at Esnagi then let us in on the technical aspect. Until then my brother and I are making a run to (Mellchett with AWO on Aug 6th to strengthen the arms as we will be Cranking 100 plus eyes each a day, 4th year ) Good luck Guys .............The old camp cook.Halfmoon"

4087770,halfmoon007,2015-07-29 19:33:00,121,"go to marmaclodge.com's website then scroll down to the bottom and click on their face book page and scroll down just a bit on the face book page and watch a video of their guide John Ross catch a 32"" 14lb walleye 8 days ago.Also Ken said they got a 45"" pike the other day. I'm pumped and ready ............................Halfmoon"
4090458,unclepaully,2015-07-30 17:08:00,112,That was a ridiculous fish! Tackle boxes are sorted and ready to fly. Salted minnows just arrived UPS and I plan on buying several dozen leeches and crawlers across the border. For plastics I have a huge of assortment of Trigger X and some Gulp as well.
4066426,unclepaully,2015-07-21 15:58:00,112,Just curious to see how the catching has been this year.
4067386,Mike Borger,2015-07-21 21:27:00,1554,"Guess what? (the irony is rich) As you know I've been slated to fly into Shekak lake with WRA next week for months now and was prepared for it. Just found out today that the venue has been changed and I'm now going to Lodge 88 on Esnagi Lake. In many ways I think this will be a superior trip and I'm excited about it, but I'm flying completely blind here. Typically I research things to death before I go but not this time. Regardless I'm not concerned, I have zero doubt I'll find fish...but still if anyone has any info on Esnagi I'm all ears too."
4069146,unclepaully,2015-07-22 14:31:00,112,"Mike That is crazy because that is exactly what happened to us. We were suppose to fly into Shekak a couple of weeks after you and then there were some scheduling conflicts and it was switched to the Northend Outpost on Esnagi. This is great, I can hit up the #1 resource for info right before we fly-in At first we were dissappointed as a group at losing Shekak and the feel of a single cabin lake. After talking with a few people and watching numerous youtube videos I feel as though this will be a great lake to fish. Looking forward to it. I will email you with the info I have gathered."
4069202,Mike Borger,2015-07-22 15:04:00,1554,"I know it's crazy, that's why I said the irony was rich. I'm back home late on Sunday August 2nd from Esnagi and will have time to fill you in Monday or Tuesday if you want to call.When are you guys leaving?"
4069226,unclepaully,2015-07-22 15:13:00,112,"We will be taking off early Aug 8th. Email sent, hopefully some of it is helpful."
4069402,Mike Borger,2015-07-22 16:36:00,1554,"Got it, thank you sir! I'm sure we'll talk before you go."
4069762,adempsey,2015-07-22 19:51:00,963,"How hard is it to schedule a cabin? Sounds odd to me. I am not sure I'd be too happy about a complete switch, but perhaps it was something unavoidable. Regardless, I am sure it will still be a great trip."
4076834,unclepaully,2015-07-26 08:50:00,112,"I'm not sure what Mike's situation was but the mix up with our date was understandable. It involved the outfitter relocating their office and another group with the same last name as our's booking and our reservation was lost in the process. The main point about White River Air is that they did their best to fix the situation. We were offered our choice of 3 or 4 different lakes. None of those worked for us, either due to the cabin or dates. They went above and beyond and offered the Northend Outpost, which I believe is technically not a WRA outpost. So they must have made special arrangements to accommodate us."
4077090,adempsey,2015-07-26 10:47:00,963,"Ha! Yes, that's a series of unfortunate events all right. As far as I know that's their outpost. They have two on Esnagi, and the Northend outpost looks top notch too. Mikes situation will definitely be different because of what he's doing. Although, I obviously can't speak for him, but I imagine he doesn't always choose exactly where he goes and can change at any given time."
4077194,unclepaully,2015-07-26 11:55:00,112,"I believe the Northend Cabin is actually operated by Ken Johnston from MarMac Lodge. Dan and his wife operate all the other outposts that WRA fly into. Everything is under the banner of North to Adventure but there are actually three different operations. WRA, MarMac Lodge, and Lodge 88."
