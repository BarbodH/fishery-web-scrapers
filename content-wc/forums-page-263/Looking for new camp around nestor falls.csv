We are familiar with alot of the camps around the area, but, haven't stayed at any others. Looking for family friendly camp. It would be nice to find one that has family pricing since there will be my wife and I, 9 & 15yr old boys. Housekeeping with our boat, 7-14 days. We have a few in mind but it's nice to hear from someone who's stayed there. Looking for input. Feel free to contact any manner. Thanks All."

4050442,1700SS,2015-07-15 13:19:00,104,I used to stay in nestor falls area. Then switched to Red Wing Lodge out of Morson a long time ago. That way you are not stuck fishing just Sabaskong Bay.

Nice cabins of different sizes.. Nice docks, sell gas and minnows at the dock, have a gift shop with many things including baits and a small grocery. Family owned.. third generation 75+ years. Give them a call or look them up on line. Good Luck, Swede"
