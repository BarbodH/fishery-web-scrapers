4045889,LoDo,2015-07-14 07:34:00,721,I'll be up there Aug 13 to 21. NW and SW Lac Seul has reports daily on this board. Red Lake doesn't seem to get the love.

4048634,stevensinks,2015-07-14 20:32:00,330,Thanks Dave I keep an eye on both of those sites. I just thought maybe some one on here had been there in the past couple of weeks. We will be at Bow Narrows. This is our 7 or 8 year going. We really enjoy it up there. Ill be sure and post a report when we get back.
4079186,stevensinks,2015-07-27 09:21:00,330,We made it back from Red lake last night. We had another great week but how can you be there and not have a great week. We didn't catch as many fish this year as last year but we caught plenty. Part of why we didn't was because we did a lot of experimenting with stuff and locations. I also think part of it was the weather. We got run off the water twice because of lightning .The walleye were really grouped by size. Some groups in camp had a hard time catching any thing small enough to keep. While other groups had a hard time finding big fish. We are already making plans and have reservations for next year.
4081042,LoDo,2015-07-27 20:23:00,721,Thanks for the report. Did you run into warm temps? I see a good cool down in the near future and hoping that trend continues. I'm praying for temps no higher than 75. Cooler the better for me. I'd like to see a rain shower or two too! 16 days!!
4083122,stevensinks,2015-07-28 12:26:00,330,The first 3 days it was in the low 70's then it warmed up. I think one day it got to 90. The rest of the time it was in the 80's. There has been enough rain that at our dock you can tell that the lake is on the rise.
