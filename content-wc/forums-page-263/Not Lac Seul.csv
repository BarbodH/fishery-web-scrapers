Are there areas of the river within a few miles of the dam that are worth fishing/seeing? Are there any other lakes in the area that might be worth fishing/seeing for a day trip? Thanks, Mike"
4078922,Mike Kansas,2015-07-27 08:03:00,1463,"Mike, We have fished several weeks there in the fall. We always had our best luck directly below the dams barriers. There is a nice hole on the left side close to the rock wall which always held nice fish when they are generating at the dam. Also downstream about a 1/2 mile or so you will see signs on the bank that indicate a pipeline crossing under the river. that area can be real good also but it is not has consistent as the dam area. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"

The people I went with were really big about bringing home a full license of northern pike and walleyes. Personally, I'd rather fish for big walleye than count numbers.There were thousands of floaters on that lake. They cut everything, took the easy pickins' and flooded behind the dam. Anyway, this was a long time ago (1993) - I don't remember where we fished on the river. One of the old guys had a moose camp above the dam - on Umphreville lake. They would put a crane on an island and raft logs there for stacking. In the winter they'd truck them out for processing. Traveling on that water was one spooky experience. When the wind was blowing you wouldn't see the logs. But after a night of calm, the water was littered with big floaters. I never went back after that trip. I think the floaters are a thing of the past now."

4090858,MikeinMN,2015-07-30 20:14:00,190,"Mike Kansas- I think I'll give those spots a try. law57- Umphreville is way further down the English River from Ear Falls than I was thinking. btmbncr- You know my friends, they are not going to show me any spots. Thanks for the replies."
