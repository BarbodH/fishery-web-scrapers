We did well with jigs with plastics and tipped them with a piece of crawler. Typical colors work, white, yellow and chartreuse with the latter being the best for me. Fish the wind blown side of islands and on the north side of the lake there is a long rock ridge that we always caught fish. There has been a change of ownership since I've been there and some of the guys I took still return to fish the same time your looking at and have always been happy with their results. They have told me the new owners are great people. Good Luck"
