3921073,GBAutumn,2015-05-31 07:17:00,5,I will be in Winnipeg next week for the Womens FIFA World Cup and would like to take my 2 daughters and wife walleye fishing for a day. I am looking for a day trip suggestion for this area within a couple of hours drive. I have fished Ontario many times but am unfamiliar with Manitoba. Thanks for any help.
3921561,freespoolin,2015-05-31 09:48:00,472,"Assuming you'll want to fish from a boat, I suggest looking for guide services out of Winnipeg. There are several. Closest lakes are Lake of the Woods (both Kenora and Buffalo Bay) and Lake Winnipeg at Manigotagan. All of these areas should produce fish. Google Winnipeg fishing guide services."
3921673,zeebee,2015-05-31 10:14:00,1144,Agreed..........Kenora is about a 2 hr drive from downtown WPG.
3921905,Manitou,2015-05-31 11:29:00,125,"Kenora is big water for a day trip.I'd suggest a trip on the Red River for greenbacks and catfish.Stu McKay is one of the more well-known guides.http://www.catsonthered.net/If he doesn't want to go pickerel fishing he could at least give you a reference for someone else.And there are lakes closer than LOTW, like Falcon and West Hawk. Both are about an hour and a half from the peg.And then there is Lake Winnipeg."
3922145,bigtimeelectric,2015-05-31 13:29:00,174,http://www.crowducklakecamp.ca Check this place out they have a day trip offer on there webpage Also search you tube for crow duck feeding walleyes. Very cool watching them feed walleye of the dock. Good luck and please post trip report!!
3922257,sept61,2015-05-31 14:26:00,91,For a day trip this is the spot you want to go to. Its a catch and release lake with great numbers.
3923249,freespoolin,2015-05-31 21:26:00,472,"Crowduck Lake. Now why didn't I suggest that? A great lake for a day trip. Two hour drive, good numbers of walleye with some smallmouth. A great idea."
3923305,zeebee,2015-05-31 22:49:00,1144,"Will take you longer to get to Crowduck than Kenora....besides, what does the size of the lake have to do with a day trip? I go there for day trips regularly."
3926257,GBAutumn,2015-06-01 18:51:00,5,Thanks for the information. I am thinking at this point I would be better off going to Crowduck as the number of fish and ease of finding them will be better than on a big body of water with my daughters. I would prefer that I could keep a couple of them though.
3927441,freespoolin,2015-06-02 06:49:00,472,I suggest for the daughters the thrill is in the catching and they will catch lots in Crowduck. Talk to Bill at Crowduck.
