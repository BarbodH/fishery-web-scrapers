We were worried that three in a boat would be too crowded so we had another boat at our disposal, but actually it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. Trolling was impossible, so when we were trout hunting only two fished and one drove (usually me). Being the first week the camp was open we were able to come in Friday for an extra charge and am I glad we did. We immediately started pounding the walleye and also took a 35 1/2 pike on a twister and a lake trout on Nate's ""mimic minnow.' The next day we did well catching walleye and as a matter of fact we ate walleye every single night. Sunday- Tuesday was increasingly hot, temps as high as the mid-80s which slowed down the fishing. Wed. was still warm but better and the walleye bite got back to normal. We fished Mud Lake on Wednesday and sat on a walleye hole until we ran out of minnows. Andy the Rookie also had a 38"" pike on a twister tail that was just laying on the bottom. We placed second in the fishing contest narrowly missing the pot of $50 or so. On Thursday Nate and the Rookie went up to Tipover and slayed the walleye. They cashed in early since the Rookie was ill-prepared for the steady soaking rain. I sat on a walleye hole in Beaver and caught over thirty walleye on two dozen minnows, reusing one minnow for 5 times for 5 walleyes. On Friday the weather got cooler and the wind was steady. As the driver I put the Rookie on three different trout at the Sandy Beach Bay, the largest which was 28 3/4. Through the week we caught a ton of walleyes in the brood stock range (low 20's) but only managed one over 25. Overall we caught 6 trout ranging from 25-28 3/4"". The smallies were frisky, the largest at 17 1/4. Each of us caught a few pike in the slot and we each got one over 35, the largest at 38"" While it wasn't a great year for big fish, we caught over 400 fish and had a great time. It will get me through the summer as I anxiously look forward to getting Doc back on the water on Eagle Lake in the fall. Fish On! Hooks"
