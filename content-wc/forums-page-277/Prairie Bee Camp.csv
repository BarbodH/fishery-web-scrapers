3319889,anglerjake,2014-11-20 06:55:00,57,I am considering Prairie Bee Camp near Chapleau for 2015. Does anyone here have firsthand experience with this camp or the fishing on Prairie Bee Lake? Thanks!

Give them an idea of your fishing experiences and they'll tell you what they have for you. They'll be completely honest with you and they are the best source of information since they know their business and they are there every day of the season."

They did really well on smallies, great on medium sized walleye, and not too bad on small to medium sized pike. I'm certain there are big fish there, but its more of a numbers lake I think. Its a beautiful lake with tons of rocky structure. I'm not completely sure, but I think you can get into Windermere from Prairie Bee as well .... which means endless amounts of water to explore."

I know the portage lakes from Windermere have been good for both SM and 'eyes so I would expect PB to be the same. It's not a huge lake (6000 ac?) so you should be able to cover a lot of it, but there aren't many cabins so it shouldn't be crowded either. Pretty sure there is a dam between Prairie Bee and Windermere. When are you thinking of going?"

We caught all females pretty much a 25 to 1 ratio. Best timing for smallies but a week to early and a week to late for walleyes n northern. As irs been said and also in every report of the 2 lodges, the owners are great bottom line. We stayed in the biggest cabin and it had that million dollar view straight across the 3 miles of lake. 4wd is highly recommended, I wouldn't take a nice car to it."
