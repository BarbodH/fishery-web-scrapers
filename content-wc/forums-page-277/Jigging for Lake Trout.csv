I don't have downrigger gear but would still like to try for a few Lakers. We have an extra day on our LOW trip and I was thinking of either going for Northerns in Knickerbocker, or into Whitefish Bay for Lakers. We stay in Sioux Narrows and I know just a few mins outside of town are some nice Laker areas. Thoughts? What sort of gear would we need? Thanks!"
3922697,bigwillies,2015-05-31 17:25:00,515,jigging for lakers is a great way to catchem.tube jigs and sonars are usually pretty good.electronics help to find where they are in the water colum.a good start is to go to bottom and start jigging away and bring the lure up five feet at a time all the way up(unless the water is warm when u r there).off the edge of structure helps too.
3922713,Redline,2015-05-31 17:26:00,73,Thanks! What are the typical depths to find them in Mid June?
3922737,bthomas3333,2015-05-31 17:36:00,465,Depending on your available electronics....I try to locate suspended fish in our lakes usually somewhere around 40 ft over 60-80 (no guarantee they are trout. In the summer those larger pike tend to move deeper...they have to go somewhere...Then I turn the sensitivity way up and drop the lure down right next to the locator transducer. I can watch the lure / jig fall to my required depth. I usually start about 5 ft below where I am marking fish and slowly jig it back up to 5-10 ft above the fish.Usually one guy starts with a sonar and one with a jig. Then we go from there....Good luck!B-

3922881,downriverbob,2015-05-31 18:47:00,880,"Been going to Sanctuary Resort on LOTW, Whitefish Bay for about 20 years. Have caught my share of lake trout. Whitefish Bay has a lot of areas that hold lake trout. White tube jigs are good, but jigging spoons, white, green/silver, and blue/silver work great. No stretch line is necessary with a fluorocarbon leader. The time you are talking about you should find fish suspended over 45-60' of water. BOB"
3922953,Redline,2015-05-31 19:05:00,73,Thank you! I have been told the area just south of Twin Islands (75') holds a lot of lakers early summer. I figure we'd try that before going into Knickerbocker for Pike. That's close to your resort.
3922961,Redline,2015-05-31 19:05:00,73,Very cool!
