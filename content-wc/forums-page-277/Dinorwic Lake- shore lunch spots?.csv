On Rock Lake half way down the east side is a sandy beach. In turtle pond, as you enter turn left and go about 1/4th mile and keep left, there is a spot around the corner. Also, if you enter into Staniwan, Keep to the right, between the Penensula and a island, OH heck send me an email and I will send you a map."
