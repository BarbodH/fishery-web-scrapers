3921009,pjshorthorn,2015-05-31 06:52:00,5654,That just takes up extra space that could be better used for more lures. PjShorthorn.
3924345,MrSimon,2015-06-01 09:10:00,922,"It's funny because it's true!! Clothes are one thing people always bring too many of. Take spare batteries!!!!!!! Fishing in dirty underwear is no big deal. Fishing without a depth finder is unthinkable. Oh, and pliers. You could take a dozen pairs and still be fumbling around in the bottom of the boat looking for some. On a serious note ... take plenty of medicine and first aid supplies. Having duplicate kits stored in different bags is a good idea. Nothing can ruin a trip faster than leaving the first aid kit back at the air base."
3924561,Stehle1,2015-06-01 10:07:00,22,"We've been bringing an AED (automatic electronic defibulator). I'm not sure about this year cause the thing is pretty heavy. I've been harassing our camp owner to buy one for the camp but to no avail. Reason is that we had one our crew go into afib a couple of years ago. Since then, I've had training through the Red Cross to be certified (not hard) for CPR. We would not have used an AED back then in that circumstance but you never know. Too many stories of guys having the big one on the fishing trip."
3915306,SinOrSwim,2015-05-29 06:33:00,1528,I bring a few spare beers. (just in case)
3915570,adempsey,2015-05-29 07:37:00,963,"Most are already mentioned like hats, sunglasses, sunscreen and insect repellent. I always bring a spare rain suit with me as well, but that's in case someone forgets theirs. I leave it in the car if everything is OK."
3916066,Duflebag,2015-05-29 09:37:00,218,"How funny it is that reading so many posts on Walleye Central sound like exactly what I do. We are all much more alike than anyone would think. Like many folks on here, I am the person always bringing the gear and I always bring multiples of everything. Can't say how many times I have needed more than one of so may items.Sunglasses, rain gear for those who forget or bring plastic ponchos, rods and reels, release gear including hook cutters, fire starting multiple ways, extra line, more jigs than i will ever use all come to mind. Don't forget a backup camera too."
3916074,maddogg,2015-05-29 09:47:00,178,"On fly-ins I take super glue(might be needed to seal up a bad cut), also some wound seal."
3916562,3M TA3,2015-05-29 12:03:00,2846,We always make sure that each boat has a map and small compass in case gps goes south. I suppose you could call that a spare.

3919657,drlee,2015-05-30 12:57:00,409,"I always double check to be certain I have flattened the barbs on all of my hook, even treble hook lures. Works wonders and removes the fear of burying a hook and having to do major surgery. Also, gets the fish off quickly and back into the water with less damage. win/win."
3919785,NY Walleye,2015-05-30 14:47:00,78,I always need to bring my father. Love the opportunity to fish trophy lakes with he and my son. He is not getting any younger and one day he may not be able to go physically. Can't forget to bring the old man.
3920098,LoDo,2015-05-30 18:02:00,721,"Ear plugs! Our cabin is a four bed/two bath, two twins per room. The walls are pretty thin and after a big day of drinking beer and whisky a few of us can get pretty loud in the evening. Ear plugs are essential in our group. Sunglasses, hat, lighters, matches, etc.... are good doubles to have too!"
3920697,forgop,2015-05-30 23:30:00,880,"I've never done this, but seriously considering it for all of my crankbaits. After taking a nasty barb getting lodged what seemed near the bone in my finger last August, I don't think I ever want to go through that again. On anything that can't be picked up from the top, I will get out my fish grips and remove with pliers only. I'm sure this will save myself many cuts to my hands that took 2-3 weeks to heal last year."
3913770,forgop,2015-05-28 14:05:00,880,"Just going through and dotting the 'i's"" and crossing my ""t's"" on my packing list and picked a few items that I will pack multiples of because there won't be anyone else going that has their own gear you would typically use on a trip. I'm talking the things that could go empty, break, or fall over the side of the boat and you'd be SOL if you didn't have a backup. We know the obvious ones as far as rods, reels, lures, etc, but looking at the other stuff that's on everyone's packing list that is used every day. Off the top of my head (as I won't have a generator or solar power source outside of USB solar charaging radio): -Spare fishfinder battery (both charged before leaving obviously) -AA/AAA batteries for any lights/radios/etc -Filet knife with sharpener -Pliers for grabbing hooks (never again am I getting impaled with a hook from a northern flopping like crazy) -Sunscreen/bug spray/defogger What else comes to mind?"
3913778,dstar49,2015-05-28 14:08:00,33,spare glasses or sunglasses
3913834,wallydave,2015-05-28 14:20:00,2151,"I take forceps with me for pike dental work. You work in healthcare, I bet you could come up with a pair! They don't weigh much either. I can get a little crazy when it comes to little things like that."
3913842,forgop,2015-05-28 14:23:00,880,"Yeah, I have a pair (or five) in my locker. Will grab some of those as well."
3913850,Draco1206,2015-05-28 14:23:00,175,Jaw spreaders. Or attach the ones you use to the boat. They always seem to end up overboard with a fish sometime during the trip.
3913874,dstar49,2015-05-28 14:26:00,33,I tie a piece of string to my jaw spreaders and the other end to my pliers so if one goes in the other keeps it from Davey jones locker
3913946,Mike Borger,2015-05-28 14:44:00,1554,I always bring two of everything Duane.
3914002,pjshorthorn,2015-05-28 15:21:00,5654,"Lighter, waterproof matches, flashlight, bandaids para- cord and duct tape. PjShorthorn"
3914154,Carnhzkr,2015-05-28 16:42:00,964,I always bring a spare hat/cap. I've had too many fly off and sink before I can make it back to it in time.
3914586,forgop,2015-05-28 20:00:00,880,"We already know how you roll Mike. On second thought, because it's something I might run out of with just 1, I better bring 2 cases of beer."
