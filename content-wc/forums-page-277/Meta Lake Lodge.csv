2242929,2746,2013-11-27 09:58:00,3206,Had not heard of Meta Lake or Nakina where one flys out of. An old railroad village of 500 people.....sounds like an interesting place to visit.
2243273,tparker,2013-11-27 12:14:00,100,"Juls, I am sure you will have a great trip. I've been twice and had great trips and great fishing both times. Make sure you take the channel over to Ara while you are there. Not too long of a run, and great fishing. Tim"

3925721,onetimedave,2015-06-01 15:49:00,502,Eat before you get to Nakina. No restaurant open in Nakina. Try Long Lac of Geraldton. Not much to see in Nakina.
1171063,tparker,2010-02-22 09:31:00,100,"Can anyone provide feedback on Meta Lake Lodge? It is a fly-in lodge that is a short flight out of Nakina. Looking at booking a trip with a group of guys who met the owner at the all-canada show in St. Charles. They really liked the camp owner, and felt real comfortable booking with him. I've gone to BirchPoint Camp on Nungesser Lake the last two years, and had wonderful trips both years. This group really wants to fly-in to Meta Lake Lodge, so I'm just looking for some feedback about the camp, lake, etc. from anyone who has been there. Thanks. Tim"

1174380,Guest,2010-03-04 09:23:00,0,"Have been there twice. Fbulous fishing for walleye and big northerns.Cabins are very nice, boats and motors outstanding, and I have nothing but great things to say about the camp. I plan on going this year and probably next year too. You are guaranteed great fishing as my partner and I boated 60-80 walleye every day we fished. We alternated by fishing off and on for northerns and they did not disappoint us ever. Hope you have a great time there. Les Harrison, Gaylord, Mich [email protected]"
1174525,Guest,2010-03-04 16:25:00,0,"Hi. I worked at Meta for the old owner Joe Strang. I was there for 5 years late 90's to early 2000's. Great place. I only left because they were selling. I'm now at a new lodge on Lac Seul which I prefer because of the variety of species I get to fish. Meta is great for the numbers of walleye you can catch. The evening bite there can even surpass your total day's catch. It wasn't uncommon to catch 100 between two people during the day, and up to that during your evening. Big walleye were the exception rather than the rule though. You are more likely to catch huge pike than huge walleye, but when you did get a walleye there over 26"", it was a treat. There were 30"" class fish caught there though, and pike up to 48"" while I was there. Meta holds a soft spot for me still, I wish I knew as much about then as I do now. I really would have explored Meta and Ara Lakes alot more. Have a great time there. I'd love to go back too! Rick Young"
1174676,tparker,2010-03-05 06:53:00,100,"lesnjan, How did you fish for pike? I usually concentrate on walleye, but would really like to target pike a bit this time. Spoons, spinners, etc? I really appreciate all the info. Thanks. Tim"
2081193,Guest,2013-09-04 02:42:00,0,"Hi, I'm Tom. I spent quite a bit of time on Meta in '79 and early '80s while the camp was under construction and a few years after that. If you can, you want to go mid June. For pike fishing l used to take camp guests out in early evening to still or drift fish with minnows for perch. All you had to do is pull in huge perch until the pike come in to feed on the perch. At the time there was no limit on perch and the largest perch that I have caught there was 18.5"". Even this wasn't enough to get to get the guests to fish for perch. They would say that they came to fish for walleye and pike. That is why I would tell them we were going for pike. And we were going for pike. Yes, but we caught so many large perch that I soon converted quite a few fishermen. Soon there were not enough coolers to carry all the perch home. We would fish in spots that were fairly deep with lots of grass, seaweed, and big rocks for the fish to hide in. Big fun!"
2081313,onetimedave,2013-09-04 06:25:00,502,"If you want to fish this area also look at Brace Lake. This location will give you access to Meta Lake, Brace Lake and Meta creek. GREAT young couple operating Brace Lake Lodge. Kyle will put you on the fish."
2081337,Juls,2013-09-04 06:42:00,13414,"He specifically asked about Meta Lake Lodge. They happen to be a ""GREAT"" middle aged couple running the camp.. My friend has been going there for years and went again last month. He has nothing but good things to say about it. Please don't hijack the thread and start advertising for other camps....thanks."
2241338,Juls,2013-11-26 17:41:00,13414,"Well, it loos like I'll get to experience this place for myself, next august. I've been invited and couldn't pass up the opportunity to do it. Heard the walleye and northern fishing is awesome that time of year, so I'm excited to say the least.I'm am looking forward to the nature experience....catching fish will just be a bonus."
2241474,v-bay gord,2013-11-26 18:31:00,3168,"Hey Juls, I'm excited for you that you're coming to the great white north. Hope you have a blast."
