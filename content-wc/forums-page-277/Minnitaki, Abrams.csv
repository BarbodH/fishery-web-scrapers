3923761,rnnonmt,2015-06-01 07:01:00,992,Navionics has a SD card. Abrams and Minnitaki is on the Canada and US North chip I believe. Go to the navionics site and play with Navionics web app on your computer. You will find them there. There are a couple other manufacturers as well. Just make sure you look at the gps/FF compatibility chart.

3924089,skap,2015-06-01 08:22:00,58,"I have the both Navionics Canada and North chips. Minnitaki and Abram are on both but as is mentioned above, only show 10 foots depths. They do NOT have every hazard but do a nice job helping with navigation along with showing steep drop offs or reefs. Well worth the expense to have in my opinion. One note, Abram connects with Botsford on the north end. Botsford is not on either chip, or at least the chips I have. Stops at the train bridge on the north end."
3924249,rnnonmt,2015-06-01 08:48:00,992,I have both as well but only premium hot maps. If you jump to platinum you will get sonar charts and freshest data which should give you more than the 10 ft contours.
