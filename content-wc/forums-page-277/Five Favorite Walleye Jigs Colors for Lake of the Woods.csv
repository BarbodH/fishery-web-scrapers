3915794,deadhead1,2015-05-29 08:19:00,193,"I don't find any difference in color. I used to use plain, unpainted, lead jigs and they worked fine. The live bait choice is the important factor. Right now I find live minnows outfish live leeches by 4 to 1. Next week who knows? The odd time I use bottoms bouncers and spinners I do find red works best for me."
3916050,Shorelunch,2015-05-29 09:32:00,554,"Let's see - if I had one choice to catch walleyes it would be a white jig and a minnow. Other jigs would be gold and watermelon. For spinners, gold, gold or gold and maybe a silver, red & white and orange/chartruese to make the tackle box look prettier."
3916234,Redline,2015-05-29 10:16:00,73,Depends on so many variables. I've really liked black with gold/yellow eyes in the past. Have had huge success on every color really.
3917321,ftfarms,2015-05-29 16:09:00,444,When the suns out gold When the clouds are covering the sun I love parrot whistler jigs. Pink and orange whistler jigs work well on cloudy days also. I also like gold spinners and the pink charmer ones from toms tackle.

3922001,jigeyez,2015-05-31 12:07:00,53,"Pink, white, gold. All on 1 jig"
3922097,Ndstallmann,2015-05-31 13:16:00,549,I like the Strobe jig from J B lures it's a hammered gold jig lots of reflecting surface.
