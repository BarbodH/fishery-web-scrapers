3922793,coxhaus,2015-05-31 18:02:00,6,I crossed at 7:00 am and they let me pass with a case of beer and a bottle of whisky.They just wanted to make sure I had not brought a gun from Texas which I had not. The fishing was good on Eagle Lake last week.
3923489,wallydave,2015-06-01 05:06:00,2151,"I know Kokanee is pretty pricey, but my boat buddy loves the stuff. Since he only drinks Canadian beer, I bring 2 cases up from home, 1 for each of us."
3924169,digjig,2015-06-01 08:35:00,146,You have a few options. There is also an LCBO in Vermillion Bay on the way to Perrault and Dutchies on Perrault at the falls. Dutchies beer is not cold so you may reserve that for a mid-week run. -DJ
3878777,ftfarms,2015-05-17 14:21:00,444,Thay usually don't have kokanee. Or never have when we stoped. Duty free that is.
3878785,Carnhzkr,2015-05-17 14:30:00,964,I've gotten Kokanee at the DF several times. I think it's usually a buck or two more than Blue.
3879169,NARDA 1,2015-05-17 17:21:00,636,Call ahead and have them hang on to some for you.
3879697,Bstar,2015-05-17 19:39:00,564,Will somebody please fill me in on the duty free liquor. We have always bought our beer/liquor at home and just paid the duty on the extra cases/bottles at the border. What's the advantage with the duty free?
3879745,Carnhzkr,2015-05-17 19:53:00,964,"If you want to drink Bud or Miller on your trip, then there's no real advantage to stopping at the DF. I can find domestic beer on sale at home cheaper than at the DF. The advantage is if you want Labatt's or Kokanee, it's much cheaper at the DF than across the border. Keeping in mind you're only allowed one case per person without paying duty. I prefer to drink Canadian beer just to enhance the experience, so I always pick up a case when I cross. Also, if you want liquor, it's cheaper at the DF than you'll likely find at home. I don't smoke, but cigs are way cheaper too, I think."
3879785,Bstar,2015-05-17 20:04:00,564,Thanks for filling me in. I thought maybe I was missing something but since you still have to pay duty on the extra beer there is no advantage unless you want a Canadian beer. Our group is content with Miller products and some good bourbon and vodka that I get at pretty good prices especially around the 4th of July. We have always been surprised at how little the duty has been on our overages in the past. Still a lot cheaper than buying in CA.
3880465,team walleye,2015-05-18 06:25:00,336,Dutchies is where we bought last time and we go to dutchies numerous times throughout the week. Very nice people! However I think I paid $40 a case last time for Kokanee.
3882041,coxhaus,2015-05-18 12:49:00,6,Thanks guys for the info. I will check out the duty free store on Friday. I had no idea how to buy beer in Canada. I will try to pick up some kokanee beer. If I buy more than a case is it easy to pay the taxes? I will be fishing starting Saturday for a week in Vermilion Bay and around. This is my first trip to Eagle lake. I am looking forward to it.
3882433,searlesm,2015-05-18 14:13:00,3,"We bring our own beer. Its about the same price at the duty free store. Make sure to save your receipts for the beer you buy in the USA though. Present them at the border and let them know you have beer you are taking across. You will have to pay a small tax but its not much. For duty free stores, if your crossing at Pigeon River there is a convenience store about a mile before the border called Rydens Border Store and they have a duty free shop inside. They also have really good beef jerky"
3882937,v-bay gord,2015-05-18 16:03:00,3168,"Here's a tip I received from an American traveler........can't verify the accuracy, or guarantee the results but it might be worth a try...... [I]Pro tip: When crossing the border with excess liquor that you need to declare, arrive just before shift change (apparently 7 a.m.). It seems the border people are less likely to want to delay heading home by starting your paperwork regarding the minimal duty they may claim from you. You may get a free pass........."
3876745,team walleye,2015-05-16 18:28:00,336,Where is a good place to stop in Dryden (headed to Perrault Falls) for some Kokanee??
3876801,Carnhzkr,2015-05-16 18:43:00,964,Why not stop at the Duty Free when you cross the border? It's nearly half the price you'd pay in Dryden.
3876809,team walleye,2015-05-16 18:47:00,336,Where do I go after th crossing to get to the Duty free?
3876841,NARDA 1,2015-05-16 19:01:00,636,stop here before you cross the border http://dutyfreeamericas.com/Store.as...&LocationID=69 then you pick up your purchase at the little shack on the right just before you cross the bridge into Canada.This is the only place in Dryden to buy beer. http://www.thebeerstore.ca/locations/dryden-0
3876865,Carnhzkr,2015-05-16 19:09:00,964,"Like Narda 1 said - the Duty Free is on the corner, just before you cross the railroad tracks. It's the last gas station you come to. You go in and tell them what you want (you're allowed one case of beer or one bottle of liquor per person) and pay there. They'll ask for your license plate number. You cross the RR tracks and pay the toll, then pull up to the little shack on the right and they'll bring your order out to you. This is all before you cross Rainy River. You can do the same on the way home, stopping at the DF in Fort Frances. Pick out what you want and stop at the last corner before the bridge and they'll have your order waiting. I usually pick up a bottle of Scotch on my way home, since it's quite a bit cheaper than I can get in Iowa."
3877121,team walleye,2015-05-16 20:33:00,336,How much cheaper are we talking?
3877153,wallydave,2015-05-16 20:53:00,2151,"If the duty free store doesn't work for you, there is,always Dutchies off the 105, they carry Kokanee. Nice folks from Iowa."
3877185,Carnhzkr,2015-05-16 21:16:00,964,Last year I think it was $20 USD at the Duty Free vs about $35 across the border. Give or take.
3878145,Guest,2015-05-17 09:39:00,0,Thanks for the tip. I always went to the beer store. I will put the Duty Free on my list of things to do!
3878417,NARDA 1,2015-05-17 11:17:00,636,"Make sure and check the Duty Free's web site, or give them a call for specials. they are currently running a $2.00 off special on Kokanee with a 2 case purchase"
