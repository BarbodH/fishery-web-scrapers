Can we get through the short cut? How has the fishing been? Any reports would help. We are ready to go NOW! Thanks for any help. Sportfisher"

3929329,Sportfisher,2015-06-02 14:48:00,47,Thanks but I wasn't talking about the Rags. The shortcut I meant was the shortcut from the arm down to the main lake. It is just a short ways down the lake from Donnelly's. In high water years it is dicey to get through. Just wondered what it was like this year. Sportfisher

Lake levels on MAPB lakes are above average right now, not record high or even close but high enough. But I guess you could inquire at Donnellys if you want the most up to date info."
3929537,Sportfisher,2015-06-02 15:32:00,47,"RedRyder: Thanks. I sent Donnelly's an email on Saturday, but haven't heard back yet. And yes, that is the one, behind Burnt Island."
