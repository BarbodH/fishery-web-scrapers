I'm really excited, as this will be my first trip over the border for fishing. Has anyone been there? Chimo's website leaves a little to be desired so I'm not 100% sure what to expect. thanks all! tight lines"

Sorry I do not have any experience with My Lake. Ask Peter for contact info for party two weeks ahead of you. Dave"

Off the island on Bella is good for days blown off My which doesn't happen often. We're going to Wagin this year - - How do you post a ""pm"" on this blog? If you can get me your phone # I'll contact you."
3924921,middle son,2015-06-01 11:34:00,15,Mr.Piker-I sent an email to Peter at Chimo with my contact info - another member of our group takes care of the reservations etc so he didn't have my number etc. Give me a call but don't wait too long - leaving for Wagin next week.
