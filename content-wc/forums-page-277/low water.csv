3848305,Jwendt15,2015-05-07 11:52:00,72,"What kind of affect does lower water levels have on fishing, if any? It is more or less just a concern of navigating around on the lake? We are heading to Onaway 2nd week of June so hopefully we see some rain by then!"
3848345,deadhead1,2015-05-07 12:04:00,193,As long as low water does not effect the spawn then it won't change fishing all that much. It might change where they are located at various times of the year.
3893249,bigwalleye1,2015-05-21 12:37:00,2632,"Anything more recent from someone in the Lac Seul/Sioux Lookout area re: water levels on the big lake? From www.lwcb.ca, it looks like it's coming up, at about 1166 now. If memory serves, the map data is based on 1167. What are the boots on the ground folks seeing in terms of actual real world observations, say relative to the landing at Deception, maybe??? Thanks!!!"
3893689,redryder,2015-05-21 15:41:00,33,"MAPB lakes are coming up nicely now. Maybe a little lower than normal for this time of year, but still easy going through the ""chutes"" and into Rice river. Lac Seul at deception is low but at least the ramps are in the water. No problem launching. Parking lot was full into the overflow parking at the beginning of the week but emptying out slowly now. Not sure about the ""rags"" shortcut yet. Hope this helps."
3894505,bigwalleye1,2015-05-21 21:05:00,2632,"It does, RR, thank you kindly. Always appreciate more updates."
3929425,Sportfisher,2015-06-02 15:07:00,47,Any new reports on the water levels? I am especially interested in Minnitaki. Leaving on 6/13. Thanks for any help.
3929457,prov1800,2015-06-02 15:11:00,5010,Water levels have come up everywhere.got nothing to worry.can get through the chutesnk problem.
3929473,tv4fish,2015-06-02 15:16:00,2694,"Click on ""Lac Seul"" (Looks like it IS coming up -- BUT not quite there yet)http://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html"
3823777,pjshorthorn,2015-04-29 07:11:00,5654,Here are a few pics from back in 1997 and 1998 on the NE section of Lac Seul. My guess is the lake was down 4+ ft. I haven't found pics from 2002 yet.......got some just haven't found them. You'll need to click the thumbnail twice to open them completely. - The point to the right of the boat was something we had never found before. -The point with the large stump on it would normally have water up to the visible grass line. -The sleeper reef in the second attachement ( hard to see the beige area in the water ) we had never seen before. We found a houseboat stuck on the same reef a few years later. - The houseboat would normally be parked right about where the campfire ring is in the last picture. Marked a number of hazards in those low water years on Lac Seul. PjShorthorn
3823825,tv4fish,2015-04-29 07:18:00,2694,"HMMMMMMMMMMMM - That ""end of the island"" picture looks awful familiar."
3823913,pjshorthorn,2015-04-29 07:36:00,5654,Which picture....stump or boat ? Give me your best guess and i'll tell you if you are correct. PjShorthorn
3823985,tv4fish,2015-04-29 07:50:00,2694,"The pic with the pine trees and the point to the left. The one with the big stump. Looks pretty similar to one near Grassy Bay. (We name ""our points and islands"" and that one is named after me............"
3825953,pjshorthorn,2015-04-29 19:53:00,5654,"In all the years of fishing the NE section of Lac Seul, I never made the southwesterly turn towards Grassy Bay once we go to Devil's Elbow. I've heard Grassy Bay and surrounding areas are great fishing. The picture of the point with the stump high up on shore is at a small indentation on the left side of the entrance into Forbes Bay. Years ago our HB outfitter gave us a lot of choices on spots to beach the HB. One choice was Lak-A Nookie beach. It was the first one we came to and it looked pretty nice. Tied up there for many years. The HB picture on the beach is from the same spot. The picture of the sleeper reef is from Kekabeka Narrows.......I was on the top of the HB taking pictures when I saw the reef. I'm not sure we would have known it was there unless I had been up top that day. PjShorthorn"

3847337,Obabikon,2015-05-07 07:51:00,2370,"I've been at our resort on LOTW's for a few days now. I can't remember a time where the water level has been lower. Maybe a couple of times it has been THIS low... but we need rain desperately. If I stand on my floating dock... I'm eye level with the high water level mark. It has to be 5.5 to 6 ft difference from July of last year. I won't complain too much, it is allowing us to do some crib work to repair last year's damage. However, we're going to need a very wet spring to get caught up."
3847433,tv4fish,2015-05-07 08:06:00,2694,Darn: I don't like to see/hear that. I sure hope we ALL get some needed rain.
3847545,deadhead1,2015-05-07 08:20:00,193,"I'm in Storm Bay and I can't get my boat on the lift, the water is so low. I would say 5 feet lower than the high point of last summer. If it's not too cold on weekend I hope to get out for pike so it will be interesting to see how many rocks I can find that I didn't know about. Hopefully they are above the water line."
3804737,tuiflies,2015-04-23 21:20:00,158,"I agree the maps are not that accurate but I think the waypoints are. The discrepancy comes from overlaying the map on the calculated location data. My GPS has a high sensitivity receiver and it usually shows an accuracy under 10'. This accuracy gets tested dozens of times over the winter when I'm going back to the same holes day after day often weeks apart. In the summer (when I'm passing marked reefs and rocks in my boat), if I have to pass close enough to a hazard that the accuracy matters, I just slow down. Luckily I'm rarely in that narrow of a corridor where I don't have a visible reference to go by (like a rock pile or island)."
3805129,Skywagon,2015-04-24 04:50:00,1106,"Pooch, I read the natives are in talks with JD about putting up a differential base station on the Lac Seul Reserve. Apparently they hope to use RTK in their rice harvesting operations. If that deal goes through it will make all the other GPS enabled equipment in that area obsolete overnight. You might want to call JD Tech Support if it becomes reality, they will have the answers on how to set up your 2630, there may be an additional unlock fee since you are out of district."
3807593,Bill Krejca,2015-04-24 18:31:00,6107,"I have a friend, new to a LOW area, who GPS-ed his route while following a guy who was familiar with. One day, alone, while following the route, he got the opportunity to have to purchase a new motor, hitting a dandy rock, and demolishing his motor. For some reason, reminds me of the story supposedly told by Mark Twain while he was a steamboat pilot on the Big Miss. A patronizing lady passenger asked him if he knew where all the reefs and deadly snags on the river were. He replied ""No mam, I just know where they aren't"". Bill"
3808657,bobbylfishermon,2015-04-25 07:55:00,241,"Right on Bill, how did people in the past fish or hunt without all the latest and greatest tech ( boats, rods, reels, electronics, lines, lures, the newest terminal tackle that the ""pros"" can shove down peoples throats?? How did the old timers do it?? They did it VERY WELL, thank you!!!! I'm still a firm believer in KISS(keep it simple stupid), But , that's just my opinion"
3809201,Manitou,2015-04-25 10:50:00,125,Checking the webcam in Kenora I noticed that the level has to be down at least 3 feet. Really low.If you like the hard data:http://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html
3810817,Aspencreek,2015-04-25 20:33:00,2911,"NAW, that isn't really low......remember 2002 I think. Lac seul was down almost 6' in early July!!!! There were reefs, humps, stumps, and rock sticking out of the water everywhere. Interesting getting around, but it was a gold mine for fishing treasure hunters. I marked as many as I wanted and marked all the travel routes so when the water levels returned to ""normal"" I had clear sailing. I look back at the pictures now and just marvel. Some of you guys might remember that year!!!"
3812257,Redline,2015-04-26 09:32:00,73,I'd like to see these pics!
3815353,deadhead1,2015-04-27 07:51:00,193,I'm on LOW and I can't get my boat off the lift!! Luckily I took my big boat out of the water last fall and only left my spare boat on the lift. Our bay is about 1/2 covered in ice but going fast. With the low water I hope to be able to see some new rocks that I didn't know where there and maybe file them in my memory so I don't hit them when the water returns to normal.
3822921,Aspencreek,2015-04-28 22:16:00,2911,"I wish I could post them, but they are all taken with a now obsolete Nikon on film....spent big bucks on that camera and lenses."
3822969,gloomiseye31,2015-04-28 22:28:00,387,I don't like this. Doesn't look like I will be able to get to my favorite spot in the world this year.
3802241,Redline,2015-04-23 10:24:00,73,I found a rock last year due to the extremely high water.
3802617,Blackmacs,2015-04-23 11:52:00,2121,Everyone is kind of hurting for water this year. Last year on Rainy we had way more than we needed. A nice normal year would be appreciated.
3802809,Bill Krejca,2015-04-23 12:32:00,6107,"Interesting point. Visible hump islands that we are careful to go around when the lake is ""normal"" level become forgotten underwater reefs when the water is higher than normal. Bill"
3802913,tv4fish,2015-04-23 13:02:00,2694,"Bill: I agree - a ""low water"" year is good from the standpoint that you can then see more of what is in the water just below the ""normal"" water surface. Then a guy just has to remember where those hazards are when they are just slightly submerged in a normal or even high water year."
3803105,tuiflies,2015-04-23 13:50:00,158,Gps!
3803121,Redline,2015-04-23 13:51:00,73,Not accurate. I should say the maps aren't. I hit a rock that usually is above water last year when my GPS showed me 30 yards away.
3803329,tuiflies,2015-04-23 14:47:00,158,I stop and create a waypoint for every hazard. The accuracy of the GPS is around 10'. I also mark the bouys incase they shift with the ice.
3803345,tv4fish,2015-04-23 14:52:00,2694,"I also would be a little hesitant to rely on a boat or handheld GPS unit to keep me from hitting something as small as a submerged rock. For those of you who think that they are ""pretty accurate"" - try this experiment: Take a reading on an object one day and record the Lat/Long., waypoint or coordinate position -- then go out on a different day/time and take another reading and see if they are EXACTLY the same. Chances are that they won't be - it depends on the accuracy of your receiver and which (and the number of) satellites that are available at the time you take your position."

3804425,Pooch,2015-04-23 20:08:00,4619,RTK? We wish!! Think JD would float a correction signal station and satellite over LS for the two of us? I don't think the 2630 displays are waterproof.....Pooch
3792897,prov1800,2015-04-21 11:46:00,5010,This is a report for the sioux lookout area.received a picture and hope it gets attached not sure if i did it right.

3794369,Blue Lk,2015-04-21 17:35:00,269,"Except this year we didn't get a lot of snow & most has melted resulting in very little run off.We really need lots of rain to bring lake levels up.Another concern is the fire season,we've already some forest fires in the area,the cool snow days we are having right now will help the bush from drying out so much"
3794433,Skywagon,2015-04-21 17:47:00,1106,"The first few feet of each of my floating docks were sitting on shore when the snow melted, they were still floating in September (dry fall). With the slow snow melt we had, not much lake filling has occurred. Might be a few more rocks found this summer if we don't get much rain."
3800065,bigwillies,2015-04-22 21:02:00,515,ha! funny how we do that.from i'm sick of this efin cold to f**k its hot! i gotta cut the grass again?
