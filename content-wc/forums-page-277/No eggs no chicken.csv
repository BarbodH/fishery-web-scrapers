3922201,port1042,2015-05-31 13:49:00,509,"There was no problem buying eggs and chicken. In fact, even the price seemed lower than in the past. I stopped at the supermarket (Cloverleaf?) in Emo not far out of International Falls to the west. I got a carton of 18 eggs for $3.99 CAN which I guess was maybe a buck more than I would have paid at home. There was plenty of chicken on the shelf and I picked up a package of breasts which seemed reasonable as well."

Eagle eggs seem like a good solution to me ( as long as they are not eating ducks or any other waterfowl infected with bird flu, ebola, the rage disease or whatever else ). I am thinking with the size of the eagle eggs - my walleye dipped in eagle batter will taste quite well."

It's not such a big deal. What I am a little disappointed in is that my lodge has not notified me of this restriction. I found it here on WC. It seems to me a heads up from my lodge would be useful and might reduce the waste at the border."

3863161,pjshorthorn,2015-05-12 07:13:00,5654,"Port: Not trying to be confrontational regarding your comment, but I think it is unrealistic to expect every lodge to keep their clients informed on every change within the Canadian Border Agency purview. It is great that many lodges have the tips and FAQ questions on their websites so clients are informed and prepared to some degree, but this change is a recent change within the last 4 months or so. It is our job to be educated and informed on what the border requirements are each year. I have found very few websites that inform clients that they must have very specific documentation if bringing a child under the age of 18 into Canada without both parents present. I would rather my outfitter concentrate their time on having their operations up to customer expectations than doing research on my behalf, but that is just me. I read about the Avain Flu issue back in January from a lodge's blog that I was interested in for future consideration and posted it on WC. It didn't gain much traction until a month later when other WC members heard about the change. In my opinion, that is what this website is all about.....sharing knowledge in order to allow others to have a great experience on their trip, problem solve and share in a common passion. The good news is that you are informed and can make good decisions on the restriction at this point. Have a great trip this year. PjShorthorn"
3864249,wallydave,2015-05-12 12:01:00,2151,"The outfitters with facebook followers have been pretty good about informing thier followers about the latest restrictions on eggs and chicken. PJ puts it well concerning our responsibility of staying informed about the changes in road and weather conditions, along with any border crossing restrictions. It takes only a few minutes to keep up to date on what is going on up North, a lot less time than driving to the border only to get caught in line and delayed with any restricted goods.Keep up to date, cross the borders with no hassels and have a great trip without any issues....execpt which walleye hotspot to hit first!"

I have never tried Milton or Berlin but I believe they are decent as well. Best of luck on your trip. September is a ways away yet,but I love going in September. I've made a few trips to Lac Seul in mid September and is was quite enjoyable. PjShorthorn"

My question to all the people bashing everyone on this site about bringing chicken or eggs into Canada is, the bird flue has been confirmed in Ontario!!! They already have it, the ducks are carrying this disease. To stop it, you have to shoot every duck that flies into Canada as it crosses the border. If Canada can do this, they have one **** of a better border patrol than the United States. LOL"
3921313,port1042,2015-05-31 08:13:00,509,"Crossed at Fort Frances on the 22nd. We were asked if we had any eggs or raw poultry, which we did not. When I answered ""no"" the officer asked if I was aware of the ban. Thanks to WC I was. I did not notice any signs or other notices prior to the crossing advising of the ban. Officers on both sides were very professional and pleasant. They always have been. I've never had a bad experience going either direction. This time there was quite a long line of traffic going in at about 4:00pm on Friday afternoon. First time I've run into that. It took almost an hour, but once we got to the crossing it was quick and easy. We actually had to drive east about 3 blocks on Highway 11 and make a u-turn to get in line. Coming home on Saturday about 10:00am was no problem."
3921921,btyreprich,2015-05-31 11:41:00,1067,"Previous posts would have me think that these items coming from states not on the ban list would have been permitted across the border. Based on your post, I'm going to cross eggs off the list and buy in Kenora. Will have another item for dinner in place of chicken. Not worth the bother or risk of being taken away."
3860841,buckeyedan,2015-05-11 14:29:00,44,"Wasn't initially aware that this was about avian flu when I made my post. After further consideration and research, if Ohio joins the list of banned states, then I will not be bringing anything that is banned."
3861017,btyreprich,2015-05-11 15:09:00,1067,"Eggs you buy at the store have it printed where the eggs are from. Pretty sure chicken in the butcher shop is labeled in the same manner. When all is said & done, not so sure a border guard will closely examine if these items are from a state not impacted by the ban. While I prefer to buy all food items in the states for several reasons, it would seem safe to say that the Walmart in Dryden will be our last stop before the drive up to Ear Falls for eggs! Wish more of life's problems were this easy to resolve!"

3862681,fsz,2015-05-12 04:42:00,144,This is hilarious. The naysayers and haters jumped all over the OP. Many have a significant number of posts and as such should have been aware the ban does not apply to Ohio. This was made clear in earlier threads. And The OP profile was clear he was from the buckeye state. This tells me one of two things- some of the folks responding just want to instill unnecessary fear and panic about heavy handed border agents so us Americans spend more money in Canada- or the responded without having all the information. Anyone care to fess up?
3862689,fsz,2015-05-12 04:46:00,144,"Sorry, The naysayer comments were not directed at the OP but rather ""Buckeye Dan"". The response to his post struck a nerve with me I'm from Ohio. Go bucks!"
3862761,pjshorthorn,2015-05-12 05:36:00,5654,"In reading the CFIA website again, the list of US states has now been updated to include Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin and Minnesota. The update was as of yesterday, 5-11-15. Although the website is pretty specific about raw poultry and poultry products being banned from the 14 states noted, how does one that raises poultry demonstrate that the products in possession are from a state not on the list? It seems plausible that an agent could look at a grocery receipt and make a decison based on that information, but how does a private entity demonstrate the origin of the products ? Permit/registration to raise poultry? IDK , just askiing the question as the website does mention commercial importation so there has to be a way that the border agents could identify the orgin if the products that are not purchased in a grocery store. As other recent discussions have indicated regarding entry decisions being somewhat subjective and open to interpretation by an agent , I think this ban will be less interpretive by the border agents. My gut says that regardless of whether a state is on the banned list and regardless of whether documentation demonstrating the origin is in hand, eggs and poultry/ poutry products are going into the dumpster. I do think that commercial operations importing products will be granted latitude as there are import agreements to be considered. I could be wrong. According to my wife I'm wrong on numerous things most any given day. She normally wraps up the conversation with , "" Do you want to be happy or do you want to be right? "" PjShorthorn"
3862809,buckeyedan,2015-05-12 05:53:00,44,"We raise our own poultry, and also operate a small processing facility that is inspected by the Ohio Department of Agriculture. Everything that leaves our facility has their label on it, which should be enough to prove that it came from Ohio. We are all at the mercy of the border guards, and it's entirely possible that I could be breaking no laws and get things confiscated anyway. That's just how border crossings seem to work, unfortunately. I'm rapidly approaching the ""yes, dear"" stage of my marriage, so I totally understand. But I do get to go fishing in Canada with the guys every year without much pushback, so I guess I can't complain..."
3862833,pjshorthorn,2015-05-12 06:05:00,5654,"Well, it sounds like you have the origin aspect well in hand. I would agree that you may lose the food, but it sounds like you have a better than average shot at demonstrating compliance and therefore be allowed to bring it into Canada. Best of luck. It would be interesting to hear the outcome of your experience.Sounds like you have a great gal that understands what is important to you in terms of the trip. My wife hasn't pushed back since I had to stay home for the kid's first birthday. Of course, they decided to enter the world on May 26th and June 5th - prime time in Canada I noticed you are from Akron. What part of the area? I grew up in Munroe Falls essentially at the corner of Hwy 91 and Munroe Falls Ave.PjShorthorn"
3862945,buckeyedan,2015-05-12 06:28:00,44,"She's really good about it. Not sure she's crazy about it, but she does understand how important it is to me. It's something I've done since I was a kid and it's been a family tradition going back to the 1970's when my Grandpa and Dad would go. I've been reasonable about it too...I took a couple summers off the year we got married and when the kids were born. If avian flu is in Indiana, it's probably just a matter of time before it makes it to Ohio. I'm fully expecting Ohio to be on the no go list by the time I go north in Sept. I'm originally from the Wooster area, but currently live in Bath...so not far at all from where you grew up. We just moved here last year and I'm still learning the area, but I have a general idea of where you are talking about. Have any suggestions for walleye fishing in the area (besides Lake Erie)? I have a small boat and would like to check out some of the lakes east of Akron this summer. I've heard that Berlin and Milton are both decent for walleyes, as well as Mosquito lake and Pymatuning a little further east."
3859249,LOW1,2015-05-11 08:33:00,2828,"Unless the ban is lifted before you go, why not just comply with the prohibition and leave the eggs home? And although the lodge owners I am sure appreciate the gesture, their best interests are in having a good relationship with the border officials. Receiving and enjoying the contraband you want to bring them does not help in improving border relations. Why not bring some other type of food, etc as a gift to them?"
3859265,Obabikon,2015-05-11 08:34:00,2370,"yes, they will care. They will probably ask (more than 50/50) about poultry products."
3859281,Redline,2015-05-11 08:36:00,73,I don't think you understand what I was saying. OP said that he has to bring the eggs to the resort family as it's a tradition. I'm saying I don't think they care about some eggs when he'd be breaking the law to bring them in.

3859305,jigman 2003,2015-05-11 08:41:00,981,It wouldn't surprise me if the lodge owners admonish you rather than thanking you. Whether you agree with the laws or not is irrelevant..knowingly breaking them is just kind of a dbag thing to do.
3859313,buckeyedan,2015-05-11 08:42:00,44,"It's something we've done for years. We are proud of what we produce and have always thought it a nice gesture, but it's not the end of the world if we don't do it. I will check the regulations before we go and decide accordingly. I didn't come here to hijack the thread and start a big brouhaha about chickens and eggs going to Canada. A light hearted comment turned into me being a chicken smuggling criminal. Weird.Thanks for the discussion. I'm done here. Would rather get back to talking fishing..."
3859473,Obabikon,2015-05-11 09:23:00,2370,"You're right... misread. I agree, they would not want anyone knowingly breaking the law."
3859481,Obabikon,2015-05-11 09:25:00,2370,LOL That absolutely can happen. People (myself included) often get a little too serious on here. 5 days until walleye opener!!!!
3859521,buckeyedan,2015-05-11 09:29:00,44,"Follow up - Did a little digging, and it looks like the egg and poultry ban only applies to certain states: http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/.../1421341727507 Of course this can change (and probably will) between now and our trip, as of now the ban would not impact us since we are from Ohio."
3859809,CI_Guy,2015-05-11 10:24:00,2118,"It's probably not the way you meant it to sound but it seems like a very cavalier attitude for an egg and poultry producer to have. It sounds like you would have no problem spreading avian flu and endangering the lively hood of your fellow egg and poultry producers just so you can feel good about giving some birds and eggs you raised to the lodge owner. If Ohio stays off the list, bring the stuff with you, if the list expands to include Ohio I hope you respect your fellow farmers enough to leave it at home."
3856337,Walleye_Guru,2015-05-10 09:45:00,62,weve all ready had several guest get their eggs and chicken taken at the border. Please remember. Don't bring them ... your only feeding the Canadian border staff if you do!

3858993,buckeyedan,2015-05-11 07:40:00,44,"Considering that our family raises chickens and we always take a couple fresh ones for our lodge owners, this is good to know. We also always bring our own farm fresh eggs for breakfast. We will probably take the chance and bring them anyway, but it sucks to have to worry about it."
3859025,LOW1,2015-05-11 07:51:00,2828,Perhaps it is attitudes like this which contributes to border agents being cynical/overreactive when applying their discretion and excluding Americans from Canada.
3859057,jigman 2003,2015-05-11 07:55:00,981,You're going to roll the dice knowing that you will have to lie to border agents in order to enter Canada? Foolish IMHO. Leave your chicken and eggs at the farm and buy some across the border.
3859097,Redline,2015-05-11 08:03:00,73,I think you can deal with store bought for a few days.

3859153,buckeyedan,2015-05-11 08:13:00,44,"I will not lie. If they ask if I have chicken and eggs I will say yes. If they take them, so be it. If you follow the letter of the law we have ""illegal"" groceries every time we go. We have had our vehicles tossed and watched the border guards gloss over things that, according to the law, shouldn't be allowed. We will buy more if needed. Not a big deal. Not to me, anyway. The chickens are a gift from our family to the family of the lodge owners. It's a tradition for us to do this, but if it becomes a problem I guess we will stop."
