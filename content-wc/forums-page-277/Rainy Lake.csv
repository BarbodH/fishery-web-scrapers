3924801,camp chef,2015-06-01 11:02:00,915,Four of us spent the last week of May on Rainy Lake. We caught a lot of Smallies.the biggest being about 20 inches. Walleyes were spread out and by the last day we were catching most of them throwing baits at the shorelines and rock tops. The Northerns were hungry and between us we had 7 or 8 over 15 #'s and one 40 in. that had to be 20 # or better.Water level was low but coming up.
