I was wondering if guys use their sonar units to determine the depth of the thermocline. If so, how do you go about establishing the various settings on your sonar unit to see the thermocline? I happen to be using a Humminbird Helix 9 unit at this time.Many sincere thanks...."

I make the quick adjustment and then go back to original setting because I don't like looking at the thermocline and all the other junk all the time.
