5608529,dxgluuq5,2017-06-13 21:58:00,25,Are these river systems a circus with bumper boats? I can and usually do fish mon-thurs.
5608553,frozen fish,2017-06-13 22:27:00,92,"the later in the season, the fewer the boats. Weekdays are much less busy than weekends."
5609329,bowtech840,2017-06-14 08:45:00,111,"We go to Grand Rapids Manitoba and fish cross bay on cedar lake. Big fish are plentiful but it is a catch and release lake. Anything over 21 5/8"" must go back. We just returned from our annual trip and had good fishing. Biggest this year was just over 29"" but numerous fish over 30"" have been caught throughout the years.http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l1...psdamd0uk8.pnghttp://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l1...pswfgh6hos.jpghttp://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l1...pslagexubr.jpghttp://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l1...psd470awk1.jpghttp://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l1...psjqqmhkqy.jpgSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
5612937,dxgluuq5,2017-06-15 19:06:00,25,Thanks for the input. Very helpful. Hawk looks great. Currently they are at 400$ day which includes everything but guides and license. They shut camp down end of August.
5613121,bthomas3333,2017-06-15 20:32:00,465,Hey - I have fished out of Witch Bay in 2016 and HLL 4 times in the last 3 years. Feel free to PM me if you want more info. Brett
5620474,SteveZ,2017-06-20 08:37:00,271,The English River below Lac Suel in Ear Falls. JR's Portage Bay Camp is where we stay. We will be there the last week in September. Great time for trophy walleyes.
5605721,dxgluuq5,2017-06-12 21:40:00,25,"Looking for suggestions on a fall trip to MN or Canada. Looking at mid sept- to mid oct. Interested more in trophy potential than numbers.Fly in ok, prefer to drive. Would like option of outpost camps. Had some interest in Vermillion, Eagle,Lac Suel, and on and on. Figure best place to start is to hear testimonials. Thanks."
5605865,Baseline,2017-06-13 04:29:00,3207,"If you want a good shot at a trophy my suggestion would be mid-Oct on the Rainy River. You could stay at the resorts on Wheelers Point outside of Baudette, MN or at the motels in Baudette. The river is crowded on weekends, but after noon on Sunday and weekdays the the crowd thins out. Dogtooth Lake located near the Souix Narrows area of LOW was managed trophy lake and gets good review for large walleyes."
5606033,pjshorthorn,2017-06-13 06:49:00,5654,"What species of trophy size fish are you wanting to target ? If you are looking at musky, then I would look at Vermilion Bay Lodge. They run a musky madness week during that timeframe where most guests are very successful at boating some pretty large fish. There is always a shot at a 30+"" inch walleye as well. Lots of great fishing information on their website. Click on the Eagle Lake fishing guide. PjShorthorn"
5606289,The tank,2017-06-13 08:35:00,340,I would say eagle also and lake of the woods out of morson for musky. Walleyes middle part of lac suel rainy lake Canada or MN. If money's not a problem look at hawk lake for walleyes also. My uncle used to stay at witchbay on Lake of the woods and catch some big walleyes. We do good west of the morson area on LOW. I also like kabetogama in MN.
5607041,mms3rd,2017-06-13 12:01:00,148,"Having grown up in Minnesota and fishing there many many times, Canada is Minnesota on steroids. Or maybe the fish are getting fish growth hormones."
5607073,Bakefish,2017-06-13 12:09:00,1077,"We used to call 24"" pike, Minnesota keepers. Just sayin'."
5607129,Limeyangler,2017-06-13 12:23:00,563,LOTW or Lac Seul (Sioux Lookout end).
5607977,frozen fish,2017-06-13 17:43:00,92,The Red and Winnipeg rivers in Manitoba in October for big greenback walleye.
5608089,Lotw1,2017-06-13 18:27:00,36,"Agreed. Other than fly in's or exclusive high priced destinations, the Red and Winnipeg rivers are hard to beat for big fall walleyes and lots of them. If your talking trophy muskie's that's a whole other story...and one I'm not posting on the internet."
5608513,dxgluuq5,2017-06-13 21:56:00,25,"Just looking for Eyes. Thank you for the suggestions, much appreciated. Wondering if anyone has experienced Maynard Lake Lodge. Heard great things. Lodge is C and R only except for shore lunch. Rainy river is something I always wanted to do, but heard stories of 2 hour wait at launch sites in spring and fall but I can fish Mon-thurs with less pressure? Kabetogama looks really nice with possible side excursions for big crappie? Thanks again guys for your input. Picton bay, Bay of Quinte looks unreal but mostly trolling???"
