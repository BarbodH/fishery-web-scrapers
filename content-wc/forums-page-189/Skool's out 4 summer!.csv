He actually does not even like fishing that much but will come to Lac Seul with me because of all the other stuff we get into up there, which works for me as it means I get to go, even if it means less fishing than I prefer. I have been working on our Lac Seul trips since he was about 3 and 1/2 years old. I try to make it is fun as possible and don't spend too much time in one go fishing.My tips for making and keeping kids keen on fishing. 1. Make the journey to your fishing hole fun. We always stop at a spring to fill water bottles and chase frogs. We also stop at some sand dunes so he can jump off, blueberry picking/eating from mid July onward is also fun. We also play a bush trail 'naming' game, we have named all the sections of roads up there and see if we can remember them. We also play a game on the way up to see if we can guess how many times the dog will whine before we get there. 2. FOOD!. Make it a special treat day. It is a tradition that we stop at Subway to get his favourite sandwich for lunch, throw in the cookie and chips combo does not hurt either. A few of his favourite drinks and snacks are also never unwelcome. 3. Get them involved and praise them for their help. It takes a bit longer to launch/ get the boat out but my boy beams with pride winching the boat on the trailer and being allowed to push us off. He also likes a turn at the wheel and being the 'netman' and to be the fish 'Bonker' to kill them. 4. Unless your kids are mad keen on fishing, vary things up, I spend a maximum of one hour at a time fishing, after this he can get bored so we find other stuff to do. We will go on shore, build tree houses/rafts, collect crayfish/minnows,snails/frogs and put them in his 'aquarium' (a see-through plastic tote I bring along.) 5. Have other stuff for them in the boat, Jack likes to bring his machete (i know...his mum freaked when I got him that for his birthday, but he thinks its the most awesome thing!), his BB gun, his small critter catching nets and his fold down paddle, I never bring his iPad! 6. GO PREPARED FOR THE WORST! I get a little carried away, but better to have and not need than need and not have, I just imagine the scenario where we get stranded on an island for a couple of nights before being rescued, think of everything we may need and pack accordingly, extra dry clothes in waterproof packing, 200gallons of bug spray and sun screen, small burner to cook on, waterproof firelighters, rain wear, a large tarp, rope, aerosol foghorn, fillet knife, 1st aid kit, Polysporin etc....etc...etc. Feel free to add to that list, we kid end up with the Kid's Fishing Bible. We went for a practice run a week or so ago, here is the video.VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/bt9Hqp2YsO4 Tight lines, Have a great summer! Simon."
5628074,Rock Lobstar1,2017-06-23 17:43:00,134,Good stuff! I have a little guy that just turned 4 and he loves fishing on the boat. We started him off when he was 1 with a little toy rod and a plastic alligator on the line so every time he would drop the line over the edge and reel it back up we'd all cheer and clap and he'd show everyone the alligator that he caught. He still uses the same rod now but with a jig and minnow on it and he sometimes outfishes everyone on the boat. Also we have two life jackets for him. One for cruising that has the head support and all and another one when we are fishing and trolling that is more of a swim vest so that he can be more mobile and move around easier.
