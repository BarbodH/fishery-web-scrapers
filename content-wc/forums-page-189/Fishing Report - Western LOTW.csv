5626298,nicko,2017-06-22 19:32:00,508,Looking for a report from anyone in the Crow Rock area. Headed up in a week and was wondering if the normal move to mid-lake humps is on and the mayfly hatch has started. Thanks...N
5627522,nicko,2017-06-23 12:23:00,508,wow.....not one report....lake must be devoid of anglers....

Most people consider ""western LOTW"" to be either the Angle or Shoal Lake area. That said. On the southern side out of Morson (I would imagine that they are very similar) the Mayfly hatch has been going on for 10-14 days. It is actually getting close to finished."
5628010,Obabikon,2017-06-23 16:38:00,2370,Not as much action on mid lake humps as there have been near big islands and long points. 18-25 feet deep.
5630234,nicko,2017-06-25 08:04:00,508,awesome...Thanks Obabikon. We hit the area from Crow rock south along the western edge all the way down to Ferris island and sometimes royal.....depends on what we are looking for....Thanks for report.....Looking forward to hitting the road soon...
