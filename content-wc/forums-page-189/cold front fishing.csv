In my 9 previous trips we have been lucky with really nice, stable weather for 8 of them, so haven't had to deal much with frontal conditions. I'm curious what your experiences have been dealing with cold front fishing, especially those who have fished Savant. Here in MN it often pushes the fish deeper and makes the bite tougher...wondering if the same is true up further nort?"
5620394,bthomas3333,2017-06-20 08:26:00,465,"My experience North of Red Lake when this happens is pretty much what you reference. A little deeper, more tentative bite, lower overall numbers.This is where electronics really help. If you can identify fish you can determine a little more of whats going on. I will start in my normal spots if I see fish with normal depths and work backwards. Shallow to deep. If I can identify the fish and they just won't bite I change up the presentation a few times really quick (no more than15-20 mins each / Jig live bait / Rig / floating jig and shot live bait / slip bobber) then give up on that location and move on. The key is to find a group of fish a little more active (easier said than done). Sometimes if the rock related eyes aren't bitting I can move to weeds and find more active fish. The key IMO is to try to locate a more active bunch of fish then quickly switch presentations until you find something working I tend to go slower in cold water and unstable weather but also look for warmer water.To be honest I also lower my expectations. If a normal day is 50-100 walleyes I tend to expect something more like half of that in low pressure situations.My two cents...B-"
5620402,Wedge,2017-06-20 08:27:00,270,"For us this year, we had a cold front and what we did was slowed our presentation way down. I used death roll hooks with gold blades & gold jigs. They were biting super light and would just bit once and sit still with the minnow in their mouth, not moving, and often times they did not have the entire minnow in their mouth, so we went to stinger hooks too. Without the stingers, I would let them just sit with it for 30+ seconds before setting the hook. It also really helped having the bright yellow braided line with a 3-4 foot mono leader. I could see the lightest twitch of the line. I was catching 4-5 an hour still & the less experienced guys in the boat were going 2 hours without a fish at a time. With the stingers, it did help the other guys actually catch some fish & you didnt have to wait to set the hook. We also tended to catch them in 10-14 ft of water vs the 3-10 we had caught them in while the weather was nicer."
5620410,Wedge,2017-06-20 08:30:00,270,"For us the temperature of the water was also key. The higher the temp, the better it was. Find fish on the graph in the warmest water and you will find the most success."
5620730,Golden Eagle,2017-06-20 10:10:00,2642,"I usually give moving water a chance. A couple of times we've hit fish on a muddy bottom. If there's wind, fish the wind blown shore line or wind blown edge of a hump.Keep the 1st couple of eaters, bleed them and put on ice. They may not cooperate later in the day.Start a pot of beans the night before."
5621202,BornToFish,2017-06-20 14:54:00,1224,"Greetings,You have already been offered some great advice in the previous posts. Several thoughts came to mind when I pondered your predicament.I have seen many instances during the spring time, where walleyes move deep in response to a cold front. For instance, in the opening week of this season, I was catching my walleyes in 25 fow on off-shore rock humps. I would normally be catching these fish in 4-8 fow along shorelines. I'm fairly certain the walleyes moved this deep and away from shore as they were tired of the constant stream of cold fronts.I have seen many instances during summer and autumn where walleyes stay put in response to a cold front. I am referring to situations where the walleyes are already in 20+ fow before the cold front arrived. On my sonar unit, the walleyes look as though they are glued to the bottom. Their strike zone shrinks to zero. It's as if I have to plunk a jig + minnow right on their nose in order to get a bite.The common feature of cold fronts for me is that I need to slow my presentation by a very considerable margin. Boat control becomes even more important. An earlier post commented about switching patterns and seeing if you can find active fish elsewhere in the lake - weeds, bays, etc. There is some wisdom to this suggestion as it doesn't take much effort and might pay off big time.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5621226,SterlingArcher,2017-06-20 15:00:00,92,"Good thoughts, all - keep them coming! I will report back once the trip is over, too, and let you all know how it went."
