Fish are biting here in north central Minnesota on deep weed edges, though there's a cold front coming on... sounds like being flexible and trying something new until you find the fish is the way to go, though still looking for any thoughts, as I'll be trying a spot I haven't been to for 10 years. Anything helps - thanks!"
