He told me stringers are fine to use with a killed fish on it. Culling is not allowed with a stringer. So I thought I'd ask a second opinion. Called Sioux Lookout, same answer. Just to be sure, I called Kenora too. Same answer. I found this on the MNR website too: -never place fish intended for release on a stringer or in a live-holding baskethttps://www.ontario.ca/page/fishing-...ch-and-release Now I know!"

Since I don't fish Lac Seul, I haven't had to practice knocking a fish in the head in order to keep it. Cleaning a fish which has been dead very long for me is not as much fun as they do get fairly stiff. My intent was to share a method of prolonging the fishes' life until cleaned. Bill"
5629658,eyemike,2017-06-24 19:25:00,233,I use a wet burlap bag to keep my fish. Dip the bag into the water every once in a while and the fish stay fresh without getting slimy. It is amazing how well this works. Rinse the sack at the end of the day and it beats a stringer any day.

5622002,Jig Man,2017-06-20 23:56:00,95,"This is in regards to Fly in Boats 14 or 16' camp boats with if lucky 20hp motor Seats are biggest problem to me. How do I improve the plastic seat mount commonly found on fly in boats? Usually in my experience the Female receptor is worn out and my seat shaft is too big for the hole. Happens every trip for me. Bad luck I guess. Always pick the wrong boat. I am also open for suggestions on creature comforts: lure storage, 'soda' holders, and ways to store nets. Even tools an stringers or forgo that and use a bucket, but then again I like to bleed them"
5622674,Bill Krejca,2017-06-21 09:45:00,6107,"Donno about seats, but before live wells I used to use a stringer and a fairly large tray or plastic tote box. With a little water in the bottom, the fish on the stringer stay wet and keep much better on runs to the next fishin' hole. Weight of the make shift live well is negligible, could even be used as a clothes container, etc., on the flight. Bill"
5622746,Carnhzkr,2017-06-21 10:01:00,964,"I'm not picking up what you're putting down, Bill. Are you saying you put 4"" or so of water in a plastic tote and use that as a live well? That makes sense, but why are the fish on a stringer? I guess I'm missing something."
5623090,mjayn,2017-06-21 12:34:00,1188,"Sounds like fish on the stringer are in the lake when fishing or not moving, then when its time to move, the stringer of fish goes in the tote with some water in the bottom for the run, then back in the lake when the destination is reached."

5623138,Bill Krejca,2017-06-21 13:01:00,6107,"Yeah, sorry I was not clear on that point. It is surprising (or maybe not) how long fish will live on a stringer if they are kept wet during the moving around to new spots. Hooked through the bottom lip only if not in swift current, or if not trolling super fast. Bill"
5623154,Guest,2017-06-21 13:15:00,0,"Careful with the use of Live wells and stringers in Ontario fellas. You could be setting your self up for a big fine with the DNR / MNR if you plan to keep a live fishing. As a friend of mine discovered, a live walleye on a stringer is a big no no. He got fined. BIG! The fish must be killed to be on a stringer. The MNR told him a live fish released from time on a stinger will most certainly die and then the MNR considered wasting the fish, which held a bigger fine that just being over limit. We use a wet gunny sack to keep our kept fish in. Keeps them damp. Live wells are a different story in Ontario. Here is what I found on the line: Culling and livewells Culling means swapping a fish you've already caught for a different one to maximize the size of your catch or to selectively harvest fish of a certain size. In most cases, fish you do not release immediately become part of your daily catch limit. Under certain conditions for certain species, anglers can cull (selectively hold and release) more fish than their daily limit: The fish must be held in a livewell, a tank used to keep fish alive. The livewell must meet these conditions: attached to or part of the boat holds at least 46 litres (10 gallons) of water capacity for water exchange mechanically aerates the water whenever it holds live fish drained before leaving the water body Culling is only allowed with these species: walleye northern pike largemouth and smallmouth bass"
5623162,Lenman,2017-06-21 13:18:00,19,"Maybe I'm out of line because I'm not a resort owner but from a users/consumers perspective I like to see the camp/outpost owners re-investing and keeping up the facilities and equipment. I would think that a camp of any size, like 6 cabins or better should have upgraded boats and motors. With all the money that the resorts are charging I still should not be fishing in the same boat I did 25 yrs ago. Most resorts do have upgraded motors but no boat s/b worn to the point of falling apart or seats not fitting well, etc. As for the fit on the fly, duct tape is a good medium to use to bridge a gap. Wrap the shaft for a tighter fit. If it's not raining it may last a week. Duct tape is so handy!!!!"
5624210,Bill Krejca,2017-06-21 20:28:00,6107,"I believe the live fish on a stringer is OK, except on certain bodies of water. Such as Lac Suel. Bill"
