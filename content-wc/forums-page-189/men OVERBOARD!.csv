5626250,law57,2017-06-22 19:18:00,1147,"So last night I'm sitting on the deck of my cabin - drinking a beer. It's about 7-8PM and a boat comes roaring in with one guy. I saw that boat leave and there were two guys in it. The driver was almost hysterical. I'm running down to see what the **** he's saying and guy number two is laying the bottom of the boat, soaking wet, with a face full of blood. He had been ejected in a boat collision. The weather was windy, cloudy (low), and rainy. The boats hit almost head on - but on the starboard sides. I didn't wait to hear what the boat driver had to say - I ran back to my cabin for some sterile cotton pads I had. I use them to keep mice out with oil of peppermint - works like moth balls but doesn't smell as bad. I ran back and put them on the gash in his head to compress the wound. Another guy showed up that seemed to have some medical experience - so I just backed off. I told the camp manager he should call 911 and get an ambulance on the way. Ask them if we can transport the guy or should wait for the EMTs. They said we could transport and they'd meet us. It's about an hour to Dryden. The word this morning is that they stabilized him in Dryden and flew him to Duluth or Omaha - skull fracture.Finding a driver in camp was difficult. We finally found one guy who only had one beer in him. Lucky there...Boat number two was still missing - but the driver of boat one had said they were on the way back with both men aboard. Their bow man was also ejected. But there were no 'apparent' injuries in boat two. These guys were older - 65-70. They were both banged up and appeared to be traumatized - sore backs and trouble walking. They need to get to a doctor when they get home and they said they would. Get checked out and make a record of the Dr. visit. Boat one - alcohol. Boat two - no alcohol. Both 'swimmers' had PFDs - thank God. Two boats destroyed - a 17.5 ft Lund 'Outfiller' and Lund 1600 Fury. Tillers both. They were moving in that rain and wind. I'm sure the bow men had their backs to the front and hoods up. Tiller men know that the right side is blind to the driver. You have to make an effort to see the right side - wheel men have that view provided to them. Freak accident? Probably, but there was alcohol involved. The cops were out at camp for 4 hours last night - until 2AM. I don't know where this will end up. But I think (no proof and not a professional opinion) that the driver of boat 1 is in big trouble. Canada takes this stuff very seriously. They expect you to obey the rules. Fish all day, drink all night, have fun, and leave money. No drunk boating and no alcohol in the boat."
5626290,That Minnesota guy,2017-06-22 19:29:00,8293,Sounds like everybody should be OK. Hopefully they all got the sh#t scared out of them and learned some lessons. Lesson #1........never drink in a boat. Lesson #2........life jacket worn anytime the motor is running. Lesson #3.......it's all fun and games until somebody gets hurt.
5626490,kzoofisher,2017-06-23 02:35:00,5144,Good cautionary tale. Lucky no one was injured too badly.
5626546,Bill Krejca,2017-06-23 05:04:00,6107,"A similar scenario happened a few years ago locally. Two boats at twilight in the middle of one of our largest lakes, weather clear. Tillers, with front guy sitting backwards, ran into each other, the bows hitting almost squarely. Luckily, the boats went up in the air and came down right side up. No one injured, other than a few bruises, and some pretty large dents in the boats. Stuff can happen! Bill"
5626586,Obabikon,2017-06-23 05:27:00,2370,"Exactly why I do all my drinking in the winter. Guests regularly ask me to have a beer with them, and I pass. Because you NEVER know what's going to happen. I don't even have a night cap... because a guest could have a heart attack at midnight... I'm getting them to the hospital safe and fast!"
5626754,law57,2017-06-23 06:43:00,1147,"Well, three out of the four anyway. A skull fracture is petty serious. The guy was only barely responsive."
5626778,BornToFish,2017-06-23 07:08:00,1224,"Greetings,The comments in the earlier post by Obabikon caused me to reflect for a while. Obabikon has always been well respected by the Walleye Central community. My respect for Obabikon further increased by his comments on this thread. I'm sure there are lodge owners that do not share in Obabikon's practices relative to consumption of alcohol.Kindest regards....."
5626794,v-bay gord,2017-06-23 07:14:00,3168,"I see a ""ton"" of people sitting on the bow butt seat of similar camp boats while motoring full speed across the lake. Not sure if this was the case in the accident you describe but it is an accident waiting to happen. I can't understand why some camps allow this. Obviously it interferes with the drivers ability to see, and it makes for a great ejection seat. Lucky for those involved that the results were not more serious. Take care out there !!!"
5626970,LOW1,2017-06-23 08:36:00,2828,"Thanks for posting. Good reminder for all to be careful and wear pfds. I'm going to guess that the medical evac flight will cost at least $50,000. This might be a good time to see if you have insurance coverage for this."
5627346,mms3rd,2017-06-23 10:51:00,148,"Maybe time to share ""Am I ever a dumb ***"" stories. A few years ago, my son and I fished an area where we had to go up three rapids. The prop had steel plates around it. The last rapids was the fastest and we were told to go full throttle with all. Well we got stuck, my 18 yr old son got out of the front of the boat and stood on a rock to remove some weight and give a push....we got moving and he jumped back in. No life jacket for him....I had mine on. Thinks he is too cool for a life jacket. I then wondered what his mom would have said had all gone to sh*t. We never wear jackets except in big chop, but that move was just plain stupid...and things have changed."
