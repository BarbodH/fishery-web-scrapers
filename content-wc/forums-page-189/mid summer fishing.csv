5626258,BornToFish,2017-06-22 19:22:00,1224,"Greetings,The Bird Man raised an interesting point. I fished a particular lake in NW Ontario that had a fabulous rock walleye bite during July - September. The majority of walleyes were on the rock humps most of the summer. There were walleyes suspended in the lake's open basin, but these walleyes were often hard to target. There were also some walleyes in weeds, but not enough to make it a worthwhile proposition.I'm currently fishing another lake in NW Ontario that has a viable walleye bite in the weeds throughout most of the open water season. I routinely catch eyes in the weeds while targeting either them (e.g. casting crankbaits or jigging) or northern pike. It just seems odd to me that I routinely catch walleyes casting one ounce Daredevles over cabbage weed.It just comes down to figuring out the walleyes in your particular body of water and deciding on effective presentations for that population of walleyes.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5626498,kzoofisher,2017-06-23 02:41:00,5144,"I'm curious, what are the differences in weeds between the two lakes? Type? Quantity? Location? Is it a forage difference? The lake I fish only has substantial weeds in the back of a few bays for the most part and humps have been the way to go but I may be overlooking some foul weather spots. Thanks."
5626554,tv4fish,2017-06-23 05:10:00,2694,"Born: That is very similar to what we have found. We primarily target walleyes on Lac Seul, but we usually take a break around noon time and go cast for northerns for an hour or so. We use spinnerbaits and Daredevils. It is not uncommon for us to have a decent sized walleye get caught while fishing for northerns on the edge of a weedbed."
5626570,BornToFish,2017-06-23 05:17:00,1224,"Greetings,KzooFisher asked an interesting question. I honestly admit that I don't completely know the answer, but will give it my best attempt.The lake that I used to fish has the following attributes: deep and cold main lake basin, clear water, forage base is diverse (ciscoes in the abyss, ""small"" species of minnows and perch). The weeds that are present in this lake tend to be in the back of many bays. The weeds tend to be in narrow bands or small clumps, rather than in classic weed beds. The walleyes use these emerging weeds in the early season, but seem to abandon them when the water warms in favor of rock structure.The lake that I am now fishing has the following attributes: stained water, most of the lake is 30 fow or less, forage base is nearly entirely made up of shiner and spot tail minnows (pretty ""large"" minnows), perch and ciscoesare present but not plentiful from what I can tell. This lake has what I describe as substantial weed beds - something more than narrow bands rimming the back of bays.During the summer, I still continue to focus on walleyes that are using the off-shore rock humps and deep water associated with underwater points off of shore. The walleyes are there to be caught in good size and numbers.But, I am pleasantly surprised by the number of walleyes using weeds andweed edges in this new lake. I clearly sense that targeting these weed walleyes is a viable proposition and one that I will be exploring.Wind direction has always been a key to fishing success in both lakes. But, it is a BIG key in the lake that I am now fishing. I attribute this to the presence of shiner and spot tails minnows. The lake that I use to fish is devoid of these species of minnows. This key seems to be in play alongweed beds, weed edges as well as rocky shorelines. I'm wondering if walleyes are okay in general with being in weeds, but especially so with this new lake having stained water.I hope the above information and perspectives are helpful. As I said, I don't pretend to have this all figured out. Maybe others might be able to shed more light on this topic.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5626602,BornToFish,2017-06-23 05:30:00,1224,"Greetings,Good morning TV! Your post came in while I was typing my previous post.My wife and I often also fill the middle parts of our day on the water targeting pike by casting spoons/bucktails/spinnerbaits over weed edges and weed beds. In the lake that I used to fish, my wife and I may have caught two walleyes while casting the weeds. Honestly, if we added all these weed walleyes together, we wouldn't put together enough fillets for a shore lunch.In the lake that we are now fishing, catching walleyes casting over weeds is a common occurrence.In the lake that we used to fish, the walleye bite was the classic early morning and just-before dark proposition. Targeting walleyes during the middle of the day was like forcing a round peg into a square hole. You could catch walleyes during the day, but it took a lot of work. Thus, we targeted other species of fish during the middle of the day.In the lake that we are now fishing, the walleye bite is all morning, day and evening long. Sure, some days are slower than other days.For my wife and I, changing lakes has been a delightful experience. We used to fish a great lake and are now fishing another great lake. It's been rewarding to note the difference between these two fisheries.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5628730,The tank,2017-06-24 07:30:00,340,I've fished Ontario for 30+ years. Opening week some years all the way till end of September. Mid July to mid August is some of the best for walleye. The weather is more predictable but sometimes a little hot in mid afternoon. So we take a break for swimming or a nap. The mosquitoes can be really bad morning and night. Flies during the day. So keep snot rockets outside the boat and wash the net good after you net one.
5628778,bus33,2017-06-24 08:03:00,289,"We go to Lac Seul a couple times a year, one being the end of July to first week in August and the fishing is great. We typically find the fish in 16-22 fow, sometimes on humps and sometimes on big flats with not a whole lot of structure around. Jigs with leeches and minnows is the ticket for us. Like others have said also, take a break from walleyes mid day or go back out in the evening to cast the weeds for northerns. Good Luck!"
5629794,Bill Krejca,2017-06-24 20:48:00,6107,"Mid summer has shown the best bite for me by fishing where the wind is blowing into. This seems to change from day to day, whenever the wind changes direction. Bill"
5630218,Blue Lk,2017-06-25 07:58:00,269,"I think you meant the ""tobans"" have all gone home. For our American friends tobans are visitors from the province to the west of us & also where zeebee makes his home I believe"
5623442,ssscott1,2017-06-21 15:27:00,4,"Hey guys, would like to take my son to a northwestern ontario lake before he has to go back to school mid august. What are your thoughts on trips end of July or first of August. I""d imagine the bugs may be slowing down, but would the fishing also? Water temps rising and pushing fish deeper? We usually go first part of June. He likes fishing primarily for pike. thoughts? Thanks"
5623706,Limeyangler,2017-06-21 17:40:00,563,"I only wish the bugs slowed down then, they are probably at their hungriest around then...lol. Where are you thinking of going? It would help to have a location or locations you are considering so people could be more specific about fish whereabouts and tactics."
5623738,Guest,2017-06-21 17:46:00,0,"My son and I have been going to Red Lake (Black Bear Lodge) for the past 8 years in the week between summer (travel) baseball and the start of football--generally the 3rd week in July, but sometimes the 4th. This year will be July 22 - 29. Not sure how old you son is, or what creature comforts you're looking for--and I have no experience at any other Canadian destinations--but we love where we go. I could type for hours...but, as far as the bugs: mosquitos can get pretty rough around 9:30pm, but not much problem with the flies, etc. usually. Fishing is, of course, good. We have each landed a 40+ pike, and have literally worn ourselves out--as in hands/wrists sore--with 25-30"" toothy critters. The lake also offers abundant walleye (duh), solid lake trout (catch-and-release only), the occasional small mouth (not very frequent), and plenty of white fish and burbot if you're looking for something different to target. Perch, too. A portage lake offers musky. I'm more than willing to throw more info out, if you're interested in going there, but I'm certain that others will weigh in as well. -42"
5623786,wallydave,2017-06-21 18:05:00,2151,"I have been to BBL in late July, early August great fishing, late season few bugs, as noted a few late night skeeters. Great food plan, usually not to crowded this time of year. A late season plus is a good chance to see the Northern Lights! There is a vibe about BBL that is hard to put into words, hopefully I will be able to put a trip together for next year! Jim and Jillian are great hosts too!"
5624058,yoopertrout,2017-06-21 19:49:00,1172,"My wife and I did a fly in in June a few years ago. The fishing was tremendous. We went back in August last year with a friend. No bugs, great swimming, but the fish were very scattered. On the other hand, that was just one trip. I've heard others say they do real well in August."
5624962,zeebee,2017-06-22 07:58:00,1144,"Love the end of august/sept timeframes....no bugs, stable weather, cool nights and best of all....the Americans have all gone home."
5625242,BornToFish,2017-06-22 10:41:00,1224,"Greetings,My experience with fishing during late July and August is quite favorable. But, I will admit that it can be intimidating to those that normally fish during May and June.I agree with the original post being correct relative to the fish moving deeper, in response to warming water temperature. I typically find walleyes in about 18 fow during the first week of August, and moving to about 25 fow by middle of August. Walleyes are often on off-shore structure (e.g. rock humps) or deeper points associated with shore. Many anglers are not comfortable fishing in this deep of water. Boat control, fishing techniques and equipment need to be optimized.The thing that I like most about fishing in August and September is that I am letting mother nature do the work for me in terms of congregating the walleyes for me. I know where all the walleyes are if I can find one. They were probably in this same spot the day before, and will probably be there tomorrow as well. I'm thinkin ""game on!"" if I can pull up to a rock hump and catch a good walleye.In contrast, I find that spring time walleye fishing is like trying to hit a moving target. They might be here this afternoon, and a half mile away tomorrow afternoon.Mother nature is also doing her work in congregating the northern pike for me. I fish the same rock humps for northern pike that I do for walleyes. These rock humps often hold the biggest pike in the system during July through mid-September.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5625874,mms3rd,2017-06-22 15:45:00,148,"But for those darn Americans, few resorts/camps would be open. Of course if they build a wall between the countries, travel will be tough."
5626106,DaBirdman,2017-06-22 17:28:00,164,"Completely agree with BornToFish. Deeper points, mid-lake humps & islands, deep sand all can be productive. We typically find a larger size fish community on these locations...both pike and eyes. But I wouldn't overlook a good weedline either, especially in low light or choppy conditions. Weeds provide shade, cover and often times hold baitfish. Neck downs between islands and/or points on a breezy day can also create current over a saddle and these can be good too. If you can find a pattern, you can put up some good numbers with good size. The growing season is short that far north & fish gotta eat. Water is at it's warmest & metabolism is at it's highest. So I wouldn't shy away from July, August & early September. Great fishing can be had! Best of luck!"
