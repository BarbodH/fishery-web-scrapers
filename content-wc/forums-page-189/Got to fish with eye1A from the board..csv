Dan has been coming up here for years and it showed, he should guide on the Goon, showed me a couple of hotspots for walleye and crappie and I shared some info and spots in return. It was Early June so the fish were shallow and the crappie were on fire! A real hoot meeting up in the real world, and super nice guys, we had fun the 3 times we met up over the week. Hope to see you next year Dan and John. Here are the videos I took of our encounters.Walleye with Dan and Johnhttps://youtu.be/R4G1S0qzDicCrappie on slip bobbershttps://youtu.be/SohkGXK9pVANON STOP SLAB CRAPPIEhttps://youtu.be/Kz6XV-cxWTk"
