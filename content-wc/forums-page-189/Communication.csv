Not sure make, model. I'm sure they weren't top dollar units. Just figure there are some units out there now that are very reliable. Besides the safety factor just nice to see how partners are doing, what's working, lunch/dinner times, etc... Thanks for any advice"
5622146,515,2017-06-21 06:12:00,254,The only way to get good quality communication would be to buy full 5 watt power two way radios as the public use gmrs and frs radios are pretty much useless unless u csn see each other.
5622202,bthomas3333,2017-06-21 06:54:00,465,Wasted a TON of money on useless 2 way radios. Tried two different ones. If you do it go big or don't bother. I also seem to remember some sort of issue with the expensive 5W ones and crossing the border.B-

5623066,BornToFish,2017-06-21 12:13:00,1224,"Greetings,I just remembered a funny story that happened at least ten years ago. My wife and I were at a lodge with another couple. Jim very much liked getting up at dawn and heading out very early for the morning bite. His wife (Mary) was a night owl and detested getting up early. Mary's idea of early was the crack of 10:00 a.m., maybe.Their standard practice was for Jim to go out fishing at first light, and take with him a two way radio in case he needed help. Mary kept the other radio with her at her cabin. Jim would come in around 9:30 or so to have breakfast and pick up Mary. They would then head out fishing together.One day, Mary awoke earlier than normal and was ready to go out fishing earlier than normal. She called Jim on the two way radio and said that she was ""ready for him"", meaning she would like Jim to come in early for breakfast so they could get an earlier start on their day fishing together.It turns out that nearly everyone in camp had a two way radio that week. It took Jim a little while to figure out why everyone was asking him if he had any luck that morning. Mary and Jim were reminded of this instance for many years.On a more serious note, I understand that the MNR personnel recognize that fisherman love to talk on a two way radio. If you are the type that breaks the laws of Ontario, you might not want to broadcast such information as you don't know who else might be listening.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

Then stopped completely. Since that brief 1-2 year experiment(and long before it), we just got together at lunch time to see who did well where and usually headed off for the evening fishing together."
5624738,Bstar,2017-06-22 06:34:00,564,"We do use the two way radios but mostly to brag or bust balls or whatever. It's definitely not constant chatter on them though. They don't transmit nearly as far as we would like. If you get a mile out of them you're doing good. We did get 3 new Motorola radios for this years trip. We checked them out last week on land and had pretty good reception at about a mile with houses, trees and a couple of small hills between us. Our trip is in mid Aug and I'll try to report back as to how they do on the water."
5625930,mms3rd,2017-06-22 15:54:00,148,This has been an issue for me because I fish and my wife likes to kayak....we can get miles apart and I worry about her....an average kayakers. Maybe she worries about me but I doubt it. Have not found a good solution...not even the whistle she carries. I also got quite lost on a lake at dusk and took a couple hours to find way home...Wife built big camp fire...maybe old school could be the trick.
