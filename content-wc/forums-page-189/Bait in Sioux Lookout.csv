5622498,Lenman,2017-06-21 09:00:00,19,Up there in late August. Where do you by Leeches and Worms in Sioux Lookout?
5622578,bigwalleye1,2017-06-21 09:21:00,2632,"Ojibway baits south of Sioux on the left should have some, or J&D bait, crawlers for sure, not sure on leeches. They're on the left side of the road south of the Hudson turnoff. Once you get through the bridge construction on 72 going north, you're getting close. Watch for the small red sign on your left.Might need a stop somewhere in Dryden for leeches. Can't help there, but others will be along shortly."

5622970,Bstar,2017-06-21 11:24:00,564,You can also check out Queen Street Laundry in Dryden www.qsltackle.ca. He quoted me $86.99 Cdn for a flat of crawlers and $56.99 Cdn per lb of regular leeches. $10 more for jumbos. I opted to go with my outfitter for the convenience. Prices were comparable.
