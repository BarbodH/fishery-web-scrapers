5619498,pjshorthorn,2017-06-19 18:51:00,5654,"Just a thought....your wife could fill the empty Mrs. seat open on Keith's trip and you could call ""the realtors"" to show you some properties in Key West... PjShorthorn"
5619602,Bstar,2017-06-19 19:45:00,564,Haha! I almost bought some gator infested south Florida swampland that night in KW!
5619642,rzep,2017-06-19 19:57:00,1196,Great thing about this pic is that ladies will be in their 20s forever......
5619658,pjshorthorn,2017-06-19 20:00:00,5654,I can go with you to KW to make sure there are no high pressure sales pitches going on. PjShorthorn

5623130,CreteHusker,2017-06-21 12:59:00,20,Leaving for Fisherman's Cove this Friday too. Hope to see you up there.
5624898,Carnhzkr,2017-06-22 07:36:00,964,"Cool. We can talk about Husker football. It's still the 90s, isn't it? Don't forget to put up the""Closed"" sign when you leave Crete."
5617697,Pooch,2017-06-19 05:40:00,4618,"Sooo... tell me Keith, does your lovely bride know of his post? You are living a very dangerous life my friend.Things are well here a LSL. Fishing was slow yesterday. Bent the transom on my boat traveling on the way up so am suspicious the the transom is rotted as Lunds of that era are prone to do. Will pull it apart when I get home. So restricting myself to short runs and not venturing too far into the main lake. Will force me to find fish not too far outside third bay. Picked up some overs and a nice smally the first night here in third bay. Thought that was a good sign then yesterday it was cold with north wind. Left third bay and fished the sand/rock area north of the first point on your right as you head towards Shanty Narrrows. Caught decent eaters there trolling spinners, but not big numbers nor size. Just enough catching to keep me interested.Pooch"
5617777,pjshorthorn,2017-06-19 06:15:00,5654,What movie was that from? PjShorthorn
5617833,Bstar,2017-06-19 06:32:00,564,Here's my fishing partners! And there's a sauna back at the camp!
5617945,Multispecies Guy,2017-06-19 07:15:00,447,Mr Mom
5618001,Carnhzkr,2017-06-19 07:35:00,964,Mr. Mom. Funny movie. Launched Michael Keaton's career. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX3kxAA2L4Q
5618017,LOW1,2017-06-19 07:36:00,2828,I'm thinking this will all come to naught after the current Ms. Husker gets the open seat (and everything else Mr. Husker owns or ever will own) as part of her settlement. Plus alimony.
5618337,HeHooksHimself,2017-06-19 09:30:00,725,"I am a little over 220, but I will wear a skirt if the trip is free to me. However, you have to bait my hook and remove the fish and I am not peeing from the boat! FISH ON! Hooks"
5618834,pjshorthorn,2017-06-19 13:11:00,5654,"Yup, that's it. I remembered the line but couldn't remember the movie. PjShorthorn"
5619386,pjshorthorn,2017-06-19 17:46:00,5654,I'm sure you are a very proud father. Your daughters are just lovely !!!!! PjShorthorn
5619490,Bstar,2017-06-19 18:36:00,564,"Lol! Unfortunately I don't have any children of my own. At least none that I know of. ðŸ˜‰ I met these lovely ladies at the Hogsbreath Saloon in Key West in 2004. They said they were ""realtors "". We had a lot of fun with them that night. Fwiw, my wife took that picture! What happens in Key West stays in Key West!"
5616697,Carnhzkr,2017-06-18 11:26:00,964,"I'm set to leave this Friday for Fisherman's Cove on Lac Seul, on what was supposed to be our family trip with my wife and two adult sons. As fate would have it, my wife had emergency surgery two weeks ago to repair a torn/detached retina. Her Dr. cleared her to go, citing certain precautions to take, however last night she told me she's going to stay home. She can only see out of her one good eye at this point, and she just doesn't feel real confident and stable. That's the bad news. The good news is that now I have an open seat, so if there are any women out there that would like to take her place, send me a PM with your picture and I'll let you know if I swipe right or swipe left. Under 40 years old and the ability to clean fish will be considered definite pluses. Hmm, I wonder if the moderators can increase the size of my inbox?"
5616721,Mike Borger,2017-06-18 11:42:00,1554,"Sorry to hear about your wife, here's hoping for a speedy recovery. Here's hoping someone takes you up on your offer, sounds great!"
5616857,Fisherman Ted,2017-06-18 14:22:00,461,Sorry to hear that. Did you purchase trip insurance? If so they not only will cover your wife's vacation but everyone else in your family as well. -FT
5616889,Carnhzkr,2017-06-18 14:35:00,964,No way. I'm still going. I might actually have a chance to win the prize for biggest this year.
5616897,pjshorthorn,2017-06-18 14:48:00,5654,"Well Keith, that is a bummer about your wife not being able to go. She would have won the largest fish award again this year On the bright side, you may get an offer to fill that extra seat that you just can't refuse. Unfortunately, my yoga pants are already packed to leave on Thursday this week for our next V-Bay Lodge adventure. I would have been willing to get some highlighted hair extensions, push up stuff, etc. to fill your criteria ,but my dance card is filled. Hope you have a great trip and look forward to your trip report from Lac Suel. PjShorthorn"
5617017,Bill Krejca,2017-06-18 16:48:00,6107,"Perhaps if you open up the requisites a bit, you may get more responses. For example maybe 2 20 year olds? Bill"
5617113,Golden Eagle,2017-06-18 17:25:00,2642,Doubt OP is wired for 220
5617137,Carnhzkr,2017-06-18 17:37:00,964,"I'm wired for 220, 221, whatever it takes."
5617233,rzep,2017-06-18 18:51:00,1196,How about 3x20 ?https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl...LerMjwSevbi4BgBe careful what you ask for ...
5617457,muskyman73,2017-06-18 21:30:00,401,I would go but I have rules. I will wear the skirt but I aint gonna shave my legs.
