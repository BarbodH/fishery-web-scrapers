They are back as I am heading up to the same area on Saturday so I asked how was fishing. He said they hammered them in the 2 - 5 feet of water, it was windy and the fish were stacked up on the wind pounded shorelines. Go figure! Just some more info, that's all!! Good luck"
5628738,The tank,2017-06-24 07:41:00,340,The first couple weeks of opening both can be good. As it warms up I probably would say sand (clay) banks. Personally I would look at points and more rocks this time of year. Reefs with dropoffs and flats with weeds on those reef's. Farewell bay has sand flats in it as well as sawmill bays sand (clay)banks. There is some similarities.
