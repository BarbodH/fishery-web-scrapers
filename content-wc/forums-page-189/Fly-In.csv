I'm aware of Rowan being a fly-in musky lake, but I'm not familiar with too many others (I can't afford a Rowan trip). Do any of you seasoned vets have any knowledge you could pass on? Thanks!"

Her son then took it over and about 15 years ago sold it to a big money interest. The son then bought/built a fly-in camp on North Caribou Lake. I think he's the only camp on that 25,000 acre lake. The camp caters to mostly corporate outings. The camp furnishes a cook and caretaker/guide. No small operation. The old friend told me that her son had to charter a plane to haul beer in for one group. $3000. Now that's the fly-in I want to be part of!"

I would definitely look into those as well."

It has muskie, small mouth, and a very few lake trout and very very few walleye. It is a beautiful lake, which I portaged (5 portages) into a number of years ago. This might be something you would like. Bill"
5629866,NP4ME,2017-06-24 21:57:00,378,"Thanks for the info guys. adempsey, that is quite the list! Thanks for putting that together. I will definitely check out those sites. If anyone knows of any others, please let me know or send me a PM. I will have quite a few months to research!"
