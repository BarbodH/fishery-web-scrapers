523120,Guest,2002-07-30 08:04:00,0,"Went to Lake Ogascanan July 20-27 2002 and below is a reply I sent to others that helped us on our first trip to this lake. Hope this info will help others when it comes to deciding on this Lake.Wow hate to be back! Fishing was not very good but good. 8 of us released over 100 walleyes 12-16 inches and kept 35 walleyes 18-26 inches. Most of the small ones came from Taylor Bay. Lots of fun! .... One day in Taylor I made 6 casts in a row and caught one. We had all three boats anchored within 50 yards of each other harassing everyone who whiffed ... lots of fun! Most of the keepers came from the main lake .... Island straight across the big bay out from the Main Lodge, small islands just south and west of the Smith Pass narrow, island across from the Smith Pass cabin, all the marked rocks, and the northern points leading into Ferguson bay. Rocks was a pattern for us in 12-14 foot of water ..... none of us did well off the sand points.Lake Trout is the sleeper at the ""O"". I fished lakers on the Walleye off times and released 15 with the largest boated being 12 lbs. We lost 4 at the boat we saw that were 15 lb plus. 17 pound leaders are not enough .... Taking 25 pound next time. Some came off the rigger but most off wire line with 2 1/2 oz crocodile spoons 250 feet back. We even caught 4 Pike (24-30 inches) off that set up. I probably had about 15-20 hours in trolling for them so the catch ratio was very good. I think if I would fished in the mornings/evenings or prior to a front I would have done great. I think if you put some time into the trout you could catch a 25 - 30 pounder. We had 2 on that we never saw that we had trouble moving. I have caught 15 - 20's in Lake Erie and these fish were bigger. Most of the fish came from the main bay in 50 - 100 feet of water. Had 3 moose sightings (one small bull), and twice saw a Bald Eagle in Ferguson Bay. Wolf tracks on the beach where we were having shore lunches (little scary). No open fires though (fire restriction in Quebec) ... had to cook off coleman stoves and grills.The Mullen's were very nice. Brad, Ginny and the boys were very helpful! The road in was an adventure in it self. I hauled in my 17' and took me 2 1/2 hours. Had to put it in 4wd several times (mostly on the last leg). The other vehicle made better time but still took them 2 hours. Brad has a bull dozier coming in this week to tear a couple of cabins down on the main. Brad told me they are building a two story (maybe offering American plan meals) up where they park the vehicles. They will be staying in that one and have the office there. A new one down near the beach also. He plans on working on the Island outpost next year. The mosquitoes were nasty in the mornings and evenings. We stayed at the Main but next time, and there will be a next time, we will look at one of the outposts. Looks like Smith Pass is half way to everywhere. I have a Lowrance sounder with speed and mileage log and we went over 187 miles (that includes trolling). It's a long run to the North end of the lake from the main lodge about 45 - 60 minutes in the small boats. Don't try to fish 3 guys in the rentals. The main bay does kick up in a hurry and it would be wise to watch the winds. The rental boats are just big enough to handle 2 - 3's. I would hate to see them in any larger waves. You talk about one wet ride!Green and chartreuse jigs 1/8 - 1/4 oz. Also Floating jigs and spinners on 3 foot leaders. Did not try pluging on the rock reefs .... but bet It would have been productive. Probably more info than you need but I wanted to give you the whole deal because of the help you gave us for our first trip. Thanks again for helping us .... We were productive right from the get go because of the help you and others provided us. Thanks again, Ralph.Email me with your questions. [email protected]"
