522766,Guest,2002-07-22 17:39:00,0,"Thanks to all who helped out on earlier posting on summer LOTW fishing in the Morson area. Great to have met you Lee, and see you up there next year. Hope the rest of your stay was a good one.Fishing in the area was very good to excellent depending upon day, wind, etc. We stayed at Red Wing Lodge and primarily fished Miles Bay, western Sabaskong Bay. It was our first trip in July and the fish were in classic summer patterns. We had our best luck fishing large submerged humps topping out from 5-10' with big, deep (25'+) waters around. Almost every hump (rock or mud) fitting this pattern held fish. Found fish primarily in 12-16' of water, and had a couple of days where the action was fast and furious. Bigger fish were more elusive. Most fish were 13-18"" although we did get several over 20"", and the biggest was a 24"" football with a huge head. Did try deeper humps for bigger fish but they seemed instead to hold smaller fish. Would be interested to hear what others have found for the bigger fish pattern. We primarily jigged the reefs with no particular color or bait being better, as long as the jig was bright and visible. Used minnows, leeches and twisters with equal success. All in all a great trip. Very happy with Red Wing and will be back. Good luck to all going up the rest of the summer!P.S. Water level seemed 2-3' above normal with no effect on the fishing. Water seemed darker than usual."
522767,FOOTDOC,2002-07-22 19:20:00,139,"Thanks for the information. My sons and I will travel to the Obabikon Bay lodge on August 8th. This is not far from Miles bay and we frequently fish the thompson creek area. Did you fish the thompson creek area? Did anyone in your party use crawlers? We typically find a ton of fish in the 13-18"" range around the sandy bays and the points out in front of those bays. Did you have a chance to go up into the obabikon? We like to go in that region and throw for northerns with an annual musky thrown in! Did you throw for northerns? If so, what was your best pattern, weed lines or deep open water? Thanks again for the report! I am curious as to where you got your leeches?"
522769,Fuzz,2002-07-23 11:07:00,85,"Steve, glad to hear you had a good trip. I think we communicated prior to our trips. I was at LOTW July 17-20 staying at Alexandria Island just North of Big Island. Fishing was very good for us too. Most in our camp were fishing the rock piles that topped out 6-10' below surface and catching lots of fish up to 18"" on spinners with minnows, leeches, or crawlers. My fishing partner and I pulled plugs on deep reefs primarily the whole trip. Our best reef topped out at 20' in two places and averaged 25' with 30-32' water around it. We caught fewer fish than those using spinners/live bait, but our fish were significantly larger. Our best was (1) 29""-8.5# with (2)@7#, a few 6#, several 5# and down from there. When I say we caught fewer, we were still catching quite a few. We kept track the last day and between the 2 of us caught 41 fish for the day. What a blast. What a fishery. This was my best trip of 11 trips in 8 years. Can't wait to get back on Labor Day! Good fishing all.Fuzz"
522770,Noel,2002-07-24 09:25:00,115,Fuzz- what camp where you at?thanks
522771,Fuzz,2002-07-24 13:35:00,85,"Noel,We were at the Reel 'em Inn Lodge on Alexandria Island run by Vic Beckel. Do you know the place?Fuzz"
522772,Noel,2002-07-25 06:18:00,115,"Fuzz, No I don't know it. I will try to find it on the net. I was asking cause I want to do a trip next summer out of Morson or stay out on one of the islands and I need some recommendations. Would like to go in late June or early July and do a housekeeping trip. We have our own boats. Is it difficult to find good fishing when you dont know the area? thanks for your help."
522768,Guest,2002-07-27 06:39:00,0,"Footdoc (?podiatrist),No, we didn't go up to Thompson Creek, so I'm afraid I can't be of much help. In Miles, we had better luck on the island reefs, but this was our first trip into Miles, so you probably have way more experience than we do in that bay. As far as Obabikon, it has a well-known reputation in our camp for producing northerns and muskies, as you seem well aware of. In our camp, suicks and black/red bucktails were producing the best action on the big fish, and most of them were still quite shallow in the weeds. Guys were getting them in 10' of water or less, and often right up by the shore. A 52"" was caught while we were there. Of course, this was 7/13-20, so the pattern could be different when you go. We got our leeches right in our camp (Red Wing Lodge) which is on the mainland directly south of Rabbit island. We paid 2.75, which seems like a lot but is probably going rate in Canada. Great luck! - send a report when you get back!Steve (psycdoc)"
522774,Guest,2002-07-27 06:50:00,0,"Fuzz,Good to hear from you! Glad you had such a good trip - I agree the fishery is just tremendous and it feels great to be able to practice catch and release. Thanks for the info on the big fish. I can't believe they were on such ""small"" humps. I must confess, we never looked for such small changes in depth contour. Going from 30' to 25' is something we never would have thought to do, but I guarantee you we will be trying it next year! Congratulations on some great walleyes. Steve"
522773,Fuzz,2002-07-30 11:29:00,85,"Noel,Sorry for the late reply, but haven't checked the board in awhile. Reel 'em Inn doesn't have a website, but their phone # is 807-488-5802. Ask for Vic. It is strictly American Plan, no housekeeping plan, but I think it's very reasonable. With your own boat you'll be looking at about $100 per person per day which includes your lodging, all meals, fish cleaning, ice, bait, and 6 gallons of gas per day. Like any new place, it takes awhile to learn the area and the fishing spots. They do have 3-4 people on staff who guide, so you could hire a guide to go with you in your boat one day. If you want more information, email me at [email protected] and I'll be happy to give you more information and some spots to fish. I highly recommend the place.Fuzz"
