523089,Guest,2002-07-29 13:20:00,0,they are only the little hand held cheap ones that we also use for deer hunting.
523090,Guest,2002-07-29 13:44:00,0,Where do you live that will allow you to use them while hunting? Seems to me that most DNR's banned them from use while hunting.....
523092,JS_MS FISH,2002-07-29 18:12:00,11,I have taken a set of 5 mile radius walkies the last few years. They do not ask about them at the border so I will continue to bring them in. They are great for boat to boat communication and boat to shore. We use them and enjoy them. GO FOR IT!!!!!!!!!! Happy fishing!
523091,Guest,2002-07-29 20:07:00,0,"Casey Doyal,You may want to check your hunting regs. before going out this year!Radios can be used to let other hunters a deer is coming, ILLIGAL!If you are using them to party hunt to let others know what tags are filled, that is also ILLIGAL!If you are party hunting you have to be within shouting distance of your party!Please obey all regs."
