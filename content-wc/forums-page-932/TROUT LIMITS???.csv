523151,fishmaster,2002-07-30 13:03:00,209,If the the bag limit is 2 lake trout per angler when using a regular non-resident license what is the bag limit on a conservation license?Here is why i ask.A guy i work with goes to Canada and they camp out and they use a conservation license and the bag limits are half the regular limit and he thought that with a conservation license that you could not keep even 1 trout!!!Anyone with info please advise.Thanks fishmaster
