523155,TomPGrouse,2002-07-31 15:25:00,124,It was tough. When we talked to the group that was leaving whe we got there the report was it was tough. I talked to the guys from the other cabin and they thought they had 200 for thier stay. At the North cabin it was slow as well. They had two boats going and were struggling. The group that was in camp with us really struggled. I felt sorry for them because they were rookies and were not doing very well at all. I traveled to the other outfitters cabin and got the same report. They had been coming for 8 years and were not doing well with four boats. We went out with the caretaker and carpenter one night and were going to be given the honey holes! They caught one and we caught two.We did find a couple of places that were ok. Email me if you need locations. All in all a disapoinment. I have caught many more fish on our other trips. I would go with Ogoki again but not to this lake.
