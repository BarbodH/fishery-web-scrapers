Just a suggestion, the outfitters that offer Moose hunts normally stay open later for fishing! This year we are going out of Slate Falls Outpost in Sioux Lookout! Flying to Lake St. Joe for 7 days! Verne Hollett is the owner ! Nice fish but normally have to go deeper! Weather can be 75 and it can be 25 !!!!!! Good Luck!!!!!"
