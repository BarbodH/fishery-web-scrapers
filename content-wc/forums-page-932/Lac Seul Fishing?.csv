522979,Guest,2002-07-29 21:34:00,0,"When will you be heading up in August? We will be going from August 23-28th. VIP cabin. I have also been going for 8 years (12 trips so far) and it is my favorite place to go, bar none. How was the new set up out there for Ken/Brenda? Must be nice to get bait on demand and tackle if needed, as well as checking out the night before you leave. Faster to get going the next day. I can't wait! Three weeks and counting...."
522981,zugbug,2002-07-29 22:24:00,67,"Ohio,I am a transplanted Minnesota Boy, now living in eastern Cleveland. I returned to Lac Seul again this year in july, It is a long drive, No doubt, and yes I fish Erie and catch many huge walleye.(I was at the PWT event this spring)But Lac Seul Is Special. Because of the distance I now drive I have lengthened my stay's a bit, rested a little more(few early mornings on the water)and don't regret the trip.Email me if you want some details, or stop by Gander Mountain in Mentor, and ask for Spike.

522982,Fred,2002-07-30 13:03:00,32,"Its that good. But if what I see at the cleaning shacks eveynight,not for long.People cleaning 40'' northern to eat,24''-30''walleye getting cleaned everynight.Go Have fun but please take care of the fishery.Been going for 13 years and would like to keep going."
522983,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-30 13:28:00,6,"Fred, Sorry to hear you are seeing that kind of abuse to Lac Seul. I have been fishing there for years and it was not always as good as it is now. Even though LS is a large lake people need to act responsible and respect the lakes ability to regenerate for the future."
522980,Jim,2002-07-30 18:42:00,238,Will be going week of Aug 12. It is great to get minnows at 6-7 am if you want. As to another post below about 22inch and up fish being cleaned I have not seen it and besides the 15-16 inchers taste better. I never eat pike and did not see any pike carcases when I was in camp.Good luck.
522969,Ohio fisherman,2002-07-27 14:30:00,989,"OK, I'll bite . . . This Lac Seul that I have been reading about on this website sounds too good to be true! Is it really that good? Where do you stay? Do any of the lodges offer a meal plan? After all that driving, I want to fish, not cook. It appears to be quite far from where I live in east central Ohio. I would drive up thru Michigan, cross at Sault Ste. Marie, and go on from there. How far is it from Sault Ste. Marie? How are the roads on the drive?I probably would drive 2 days, fish 5 days and drive home for 2 days. To those who have been there, is the fishing good enough to warrant only 5 days of fishing for 4 days of driving?Do you take your own boat, or rent one? I really prefer to take my own boat because it's paid for and I like the way it is rigged. Which of these boats would you recommend as being more suitable for fishing that lake? Both boats are V-hulls. Smokercraft 16.5 footer x 65 inch beam with a Mercury 18 tiller very nicely setup for fishing - easier to launch on primitive ramps. My other boat is actually for duck hunting, but may be better, it is a Crestliner 18 footer x 78 inch beam with a Mercury 50hp tiller not as well equipped for fishing and not easy to launch on primitive ramps, but longer wider deeper and much faster! Thanks, Ohio fisherman"
522970,Larry,2002-07-27 15:00:00,357,"Ohio, it's for real. Go for it. Son and I just returned. We drove from Maryland. Better go the southern route around Chicago. Lots of the Canada road is 2 lane. Check out the driving time on mapquest.com. We left the 17' BassTracker behind. Awful long way to drag a boat. The lodges have decent equipment. Do a search and you will find tons of places to stay from very cheap to very expensive. You decide. We are going back. It is wonderful. You won't be sorry. Larry"
522971,Jigger1,2002-07-27 15:49:00,234,"Ohio, It's an 800 mile poke for me and I'd do it two or three times a year if I could. The walleye fishing on this lake is nothing short of unbelievable. I fish out of Silver Water Wheel Lodge http://www.sww-lodge.com It's a top notch ""all inclusive"" fishing camp and it's worth every cent. Mike and his team of guides will put you on fish like you've never seen. Mike can accomidate you if you would like to bring your boat, but his entire fleet is made up of 18'Lund Pro V's backed with 80hp Yamaha's. No matter which way you slice it, it's all top notch! Best of luck! Jigger1"
522972,csm,2002-07-28 07:08:00,0,"Have been going to Canada since I was 12 and I am now 42, so I have been to quite a few places in northwest Ontario and Lac Seul is by far the best walleye fishery in that part of the country and perhaps short of Lake Erie, the entire mid-west.If you take a boat, go big. Its a huge lake and the waves can get very big when a storm comes up. While the smaller boat is easier to trailer, you will regret it if your a long way to your resort and the wind is blowing.For the last five years I have fished out of Silver Water Wheel Resort and its a first class operation all the way. Its located in the middle of the lake while 90% of the resorts are located on either end. Its such a long lake this makes the middle section less trafficed. Not sure the fishing is any better, but it is nice to have more of a Canadian feeling as there are not 10 boats in sight at your favorite fishing hole. The resort itself is very well run, great accomadations, super staff, wonderful boats to fish out of (18' Lunds with 80 hp 4-stroke Yamahas, and its an American-plan resort, so why even bring your own boat up. Lac Seul is a resevior so there are plenty of hiding rocks and dead heads just waiting to tear up a lower unitThe owner of the resort does a great job of hiring and training guides, in fact, having just returned to a trip to LOTW, his guide staff would run circles around the staff at this ""big-name resort""I am sure there are other great resorts on Lac Seul, but I have yet to have any even minor suggestion on how Silver Water Wheel could be made better (OK, the road coming in is a little rough in places, but that is because of the logging trucks that run about 20 miles from the resort). Hey that is OK too because it makes it a more ""Canadian"" experience for my 10 year old son who has come for the last two years. The resort is a fishing resort, but they go out of their way to make even a 10 year old welcomeIts a long drive from Ohio, but Lac Seul is the best walleye lake in northwest Ontario by far!"
522973,Planocat,2002-07-28 10:26:00,473,Any resorts with RV hookup facilities and docks for boats? Would appreciate any suggestions. Thanks......Planocat

522976,Guest,2002-07-28 15:11:00,0,"I HAVE BEEN GOING TO NW ONTARIO FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND HAVE FOUND GOOD WALLEYE FISHING IN MANY LOCATIONS BUT LAC SEUL IS MY FIRST PICK ALSO. NOT ONLY NUMBERS BUT SIZE IS THE BEST I'VE SEEN.I'TS A BIG BIG LAKE AND FIRST TIMERS CAN BECOME INTIMIDATED VERY EASILY.I WOULD TAKE THE BIGGER OF YOUR BOATS IF YOU DECIDE TO PULL YOUR OWN UP.LOTS OF GOOD PLACES TO STAY. YOU MIGHT TRY GOOSE BAY CAMP NEAR EAR FALLS,NOT FANCY BUT WELL CARED FOR CAMP THAT HAS BEEN IN THE SAME FAMILY FOR OVER 50 YEARS,THEY KNOW THE LAKE AND ARE HELPFUL IN PUTTING PEOPLE ON FISH.ALSO CONSIDER A GUIDE FOR THE FIRST DAY SO YOU GET A FEEL FOR WHAT IS GOING ON.CAN HARDLY WAIT, I LEAVE FOR LS IN FOUR WEEKS.WALLEYES WON'T FORGET THE DAY THE BADGER CAME OUT TO PLAY."
522977,Guest,2002-07-28 20:30:00,0,"Take the bigger of your boats,it's a big lake and you will be glad you did.Don't worry about the launch ramps,most resorts have a decent launch for private boats.You better ask the boss for a couple extra days off.It's a long drive from the Buckeye state to Lac Seul and five days to spend on this lake will go by real real fast."
522975,woman,2002-07-29 00:57:00,2,"lacseulevergreen has RV hook ups, 1 mile out of earfalls.1 888 222 3586 or lacseulwalleye.com we stay all season and love the fishing"
522978,Jim,2002-07-29 19:41:00,238,"I just returned from 7 days at Lac Seul Outposts/Objibway Outfitters.Ojibway is on the NE end of the lake (40 miles by water from the launch). It is remote (3 bears in camp this year so far) but very comfortable. You do your own cooking but have 24 hours of electricity from the generator. All the ice you want, barbeque sets at each cabin along with gas stoves, good size electric refridgerators. We rent VIP cabins that have hot/cold water, showers and flush toilets.Have gone for 7 years straight and will go back. The fishing is unbelievable if it is walleyes you are after. Can you believe it gets tiresome after catching @100 walleyes in a day and then we go for a few hours for muskie.Sometimes you run into schools of 14-18 inch fish, if you want bigger move on and find a school of bigger fish.Our best last week was one morning with @30 fish 18 inches up to 25 inches(also caught a 10lb/34 inch pike while jigging for walleyes).I take my own 19 foot lund pro-v and it can handle most of the weather nicely.I drive from Detroit area and go across the UP , Wisconsin, Minnesota. For me it is 1000 miles and a two day drive.They don't catch a lot of muskies but when they catch one it is normally big (45-56 inches).There were two 51 inch muskie caught last week. Am going back in August."
