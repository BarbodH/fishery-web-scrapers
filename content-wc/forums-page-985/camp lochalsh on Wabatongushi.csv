516579,Guest,2002-01-24 17:37:00,0,Wondering if anybody has fished this lake for Walleye. Thinking about going late july. Any information about lodge or fishing would be appreciated.
516580,Guest,2002-01-25 08:30:00,0,"We went to Camp Lochalsh in 1997...late-May. We had to go all the way up to the sanctuary area to catch walleye, almost 11 miles, but we did catch them. We stayed at the outpost cabin of Camp Lochalsh. Great experience, and great people. Chris and Courtney are fine hosts and will do everything to make sure you are comfortable and are on fish. Full service experience without the full service price. Check out www.camplochalsh.com.I've been up to Canada a lot, and this is one of my sentimental favorite trips of all time. I will go back, once I can stop the itch to try a new lake every couple of years."
516581,Guest,2002-01-25 14:14:00,0,We are trying to decide between in-camp housekeeping or outpostany recommendation which one is nicer or better view of lake.
516582,Ray,2002-01-25 14:23:00,96,Would you go in july 18-20 or Aug.18-20 for walleye fishing in Canada. Also I went to marmac lodge on esnagi lake just wondering how they would compare. thanks
516583,Guest,2002-01-25 14:55:00,0,"Late-July would not be as good as mid-late-August for walleye. As for the cabins, stay at the outpost. Don't get me wrong, they're not plush by any means. But they are more than serviceable, and the seclusion you enjoy is second to none. Go out to www.thecanadatrip.com. It's a new web site I'm creating, but it's not quite done yet. Go to Destinations, then click on Lake Wabintongushi. The cabin shown is the outpost cabin, and that picture is taken from the dock on the water. The view is awesome! There's another picture from the shore lunch spot called Table Rock. I will be adding pictures to this area over the weekend, so check back Monday if you want. Hope this helps."

516585,Guest,2002-01-28 09:08:00,0,"I've heard some things, mostly out on this board. Not many of them were very flattering though. Post a note about Kaby and you'll get answers. If I recall correctly, there was a string of postings not more than 2 months ago about Kaby, so you may want to check back into the archives a little."
