A 3 hour or so drive.What about boat access, does canada print maps with boat accesses? If so where can I find them?Please pardon my ignorance as I am new to this area."

It's a big water lake with nasty springtime weather, but there's excellent trophy muskie populations in there. The best place I can think of in the area for big muskies other than maybe Seul. Lot of walleyes, northerns and smallies too. There are several resorts around the lake to choose from."
516589,BD,2002-01-25 17:39:00,739,Finlayson Resort and Campground just a little north of Atikokan is a nice place. There are several small / medium lakes in the area besides the lake the resort is on and there is the Seine River. Everything from lake trout to walleye to musky is nearby.
