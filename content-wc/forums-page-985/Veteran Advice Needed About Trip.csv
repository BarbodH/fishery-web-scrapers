516652,DaveIN,2002-01-28 18:21:00,191,I can second the suggestion of Separation Lake Lodge.Also the fishing does not slack off in July and August.
516642,Dave,2002-01-27 06:32:00,258,"Hi,We are going to Ontario for the first time this summer-3rd week of July.Went to the All Canada Show and are now more confused than ever!We are willing to drive 15 hours from the Green Bay area, need a drive to, want to catch a fair number of fish, and want to pay 300-400 bucks per guy per week (not including bait, license etc.) We are primarily interested in walleye and northerns. Any suggestions-Please!We have our own boat.Thanks"
516643,Kaz,2002-01-27 07:32:00,643,"Dave: Look up ""Lost Island Resort"" in Hudson. Jim Hayes is the owner and has a newer and great place too. He lives in Emo in the winter, but information has his phone number. We went there several times and were never disappointed. They have a couple of old timer guides who can show you where to find the fish, both northern and eyes, plus the smallmouth bass are plentiful too. Good luck....Kaz"
516644,Guest,2002-01-27 09:04:00,0,"Dave,I go to the Vermilion Bay area. I believe it would be within the 15 hour drive from Green Bay. I live north of Madison and do it in 14 hours.We fish on the Indian Chain of lakes. If you really want northerns, go elsewhere. But we have caught some nice muskies (which I prefer over northerns). I have not been there in July, but in June we do well on numbers of eyes. Every year somebody in camp gets a big one but it has not been us.We stay at Clark's Camp (www.clarkscamp.com) and they are in your price range. I don't think they do the All Canada show because of all the repeat business they get. Wayne and Karla are friendly and very helpful. They will put some x's on the map for a starting point for you. The cottages are nice clean.Fritz"
516645,Guest,2002-01-27 21:25:00,0,DAVE CHECK OUT SEPARATION LAKE LODGE ON THE ENGLISH RIVER.DRIVE TO AND ABOUT 1 HOUR NORTH OF KENORA.
516646,Guest,2002-01-28 05:16:00,0,Dave-The All-Canada show are fun but always make sure you have at least 2-3 goood references. Alot of these can really make it sound too good to be true. I for one have been to Canada for as long as I can remember and it was'nt until 12 years ago that I found Holinshead Lake Outfitters. It is located 2 hrs. north of Thunder Bay which would be around 11 hrs from Green Bay. You can e-mail me at [email protected] for more info if interested. Good luck-Greg
516647,Fishoil,2002-01-28 09:37:00,1277,"I'll second the references thing, try not to go to a camp until you talk to a few people that have been there. Find these people through friends, friends of friends, etc. You can bet that any names the camp supplies you with will say nothing but good about the camp. I live near Green Bay also and have experience with a couple of drive-to camps, if you want more info. e-mail me. Also, please realize that fishing can get a little tough up there in late July. But with a little work and preparation you'll still be able to do well."
516648,Guest,2002-01-28 11:28:00,0,"I'd start by going to a ""real"" sporting goods store and asking the guys behind the counter in the fishing department--like a Gander Mountain or Scheels, or someplace like that. They talk to more local fishermen than probably anybody else around. They'd be able to tell you what they've heard, and might be able to get you in touch with some locals who have fished various resorts. If they are a good help, be sure to buy the bulk of your stuff from them. They can't stay in business by giving out free advice so be sure they get some of your $$ for their help!"
516649,BD,2002-01-28 16:15:00,739,"I like Press Lake Camp and LOTW Houseboats but there are many others. I started a thread last year ""What's your favorite resort"". Search the archives and you should be able to find it."
