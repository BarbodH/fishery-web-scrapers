516617,manitobawalleye,2002-01-26 17:06:00,885,should read www.hagensfish.comgood service and toll free 1-800-541-4586and reasonable shipping fees for us canadians
516618,manitobawalleye,2002-01-26 17:20:00,885,paulshould have read your post a little more closely....hagens are good for some things but want to sell spinners blades in large quantities.... from them i buy beads and hooks...great prices for gamakatsu's... also good supply of jig making gear they will send canadians their catalog for free....for blades i have purchased from www.staminainc.comthey also give good service and smaller bulk packs of blades and you can mix and match your order... i like their walleye pro blades...just upset that they haven't sent me this years catalog as of yet seeing i bought enough last year...can't understand why they want$5.00 for the catalog for canadians... will have to email them and find out!!!!as for canadian tackle there are a few if you do some searching....but seems i no longer have them bookmarkedgood luck and pray for a better canadian dollar

516620,Guest,2002-01-28 20:03:00,0,"Hi, well the place to get lures whould probably be a hook, line and sinker.. where ever you can find one.There used to be one in Dyden, ont. But i don't think it is there anymore. But if u wana some good expert advice, you could go to Red Lake, ont. Where all the good fisherman are at. Fishing#1"
