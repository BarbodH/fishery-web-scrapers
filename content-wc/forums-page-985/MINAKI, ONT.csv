516656,iamwalleye1,2002-01-27 18:18:00,1589,"WEll! There are many places to stay, it is like northern wisconsin in minaki in july! The best place I have found is Barbers! It is right in town with a nice boat launch and great cabins(most of the time all sold out in july) But you can give peter a call 807 224 6411 peter or trout is his wife great people! The walleyes if that is what you were asking about. Will be up on the reefs in big and little sand just a little jog from Minaki! Spinners work good and the jig bite! LOL"
516657,Reels,2002-01-27 18:22:00,2876,"July is a good trolling time. Bring lots of shadraps and some trolling gear. A pair of planer boards will help you out some.But on this system, a jig, a spinner, or a live bait rig will catch fish. Just a matter of how big and how many.As for a place to stay, Peter Barber has the best place in my opinion, but he is usually booked a year in advance. Big North is nice, a bit farther south (Up river ;-) ) I'll post the # tomorrow.<{{}}><"

516660,Riceburner,2002-01-27 21:22:00,436,"If Barbers is full, give Duane a call at Paradise Cove--he will put you on the fish too. Winter number in Seattle 206-439-7341, Summer number is 807-224-1107."
516661,DonC,2002-01-27 23:15:00,93,"Jigman, if you want a little upscale, I recommend Birch Island Resort, which is a mile from Minaki. It costs about $1000 per week (not including taxes)for the American Plan. They have a website: birchislandresort.com.Good luck, Don"
516662,iamwalleye1,2002-01-28 16:48:00,1589,"Birch island! THat is what it means you will have to load all your sh_t in a boat and go to the island! Reels said about Big North a very nice place, Just a bit south of town about 5 miles 807 224 4318 ask for alex or his wife pat! Tell them Bill said HI! From Rockford! www.duenorth.net/bignorthlodge"
516659,iamwalleye1,2002-01-28 16:51:00,1589,Wow !! That was a close call. You have got a walleye in your pants!
