516241,Guest,2002-01-15 13:54:00,0,Me and a couple guys i work with are taking a trip to williams lake lodge just south of lac suel. I was wondering what the hot bait is for walleye and pike in june. Also how big is the channel to get to lac suel because i'm thinking of bringing my boat up.
516242,Guest,2002-01-15 14:31:00,0,"I'm not sure were Williams lake is, can you name any other lakes cloe to your spot... what is the resort that you are staying at?"
516243,Guest,2002-01-15 20:35:00,0,we fished out of williams lake lodge about 4 years ago. fishing for walleyes was good. we were up in july fished with jigs and leeches and spinner rigs [silver hammer]. northerns we disapointing though but we were later in the season. all our fish were caught in lac suel the channel is fairly narrow with several places with rocks so take it easy good luck
516244,todd,2002-01-17 09:50:00,21,thanks.
516245,todd,2002-01-17 10:07:00,21,williams lake is 50 miles north of the town of dryden. it is all gravel roads to the resort once you reach it. also thanks for the input on the channel i think i won't bring my boat up because it cost a lot to repair a motor( last year we went to wild goose lake and we were riding in 25 feet of water and then we were seeing bottom in 3 feet of water) and the fact that its a long drive from green bay to lac suel.

516247,Guest,2002-01-23 00:49:00,0,"todd,i have been fishing out of williams lake lodge for the past 12 years.Spinners (nightcrawler harnesses)with crawlers,leeches are your best bet for eyes in Lac Seul. Flashy,daredevil type spoons work good for pike in both Williams and Lac Seul.My wife and I really enjoy this place.I could go on for hours but why don't you e-mail me for more specifics.Be glad to help.

516248,todd,2002-01-24 12:12:00,21,thanks for the info i have a few more questions for you. is there any lake trout up there and if so what to you use for bait. the other thing is do you cast or troll the worm harness. do you use jigs. what colors?
516249,Guest,2002-01-28 20:02:00,0,"todd, In all the years we have been to williams lake and lacseul we have not heard of or seen a lake trout.hope your not disapointed!trolling is legal and the ONLY way to fish.95% of the time we backtroll spinners with gold,chartreuse,red or orange blades in sizes 3 or 4.I use 3 hook rigs for crawlers and single hook rigs with leeches or minnows.I seldom use jigs because I do so well with the spinners.jigs are too time consuming.the fish should be going into their summer patterns when you are there. so keep moving(backtrolling)and looking for active fish.If you find fish concentrated in a small area you may want to try jigging if thats what you like but i'll take my spinners any day over jigs.I've used the above method for years there and on more than one occasion out-fished the local guides!"
