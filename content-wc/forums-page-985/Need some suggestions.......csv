We are from Syracuse NY, looking to stay relatively close to the US border. Does anyone out there have a sugestion on where we might go??"

It is not too far from you ( about 1 1/2 hours from Toronto) and has lots of lakes. I have fished most of them and would probably be right in saying that Stoney Lake is one of the, if not the best fishing lake. It has musky, walleye and bass.If you need more info on the Kawarthas you can email me at [email protected]"
515400,Guest,2001-11-11 07:21:00,0,"We really would like to target Walleye and Pike. Numbers first, trophies second. Thanks for the replies..."
515401,Trophymuskie,2001-11-11 17:56:00,254,"Then you want to go to Quebec, there was a topic about La reserve beauchene on this board, look it up. It's a great place to go and walleyes are there by the tonne.As for camping, you may want to look into Laverandry park. It's loaded with first class pike and walleye lakes.Catch a big one this fallKeep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com"
