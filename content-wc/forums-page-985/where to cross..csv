516471,PJM,2002-01-17 22:48:00,3516,Jig Master I would read the post on DWI because there might be some helpful information on it. I found it to be very interesting if you were planning a trip Canada.
516472,Guest,2002-01-18 06:43:00,0,"Hey JigmasterYou must be from the Pittsburg affiliate of CDDA , I heard there was a lot of you. I would suggest you cross at the Sault (see post DWI)We are just a rinky dink town with one border guard, and at night the border guard is replaced by a new high tech device called a ""orange pylon"" But just in case you don't get the Pylon shift, I would suggest you bring a bribe of $200 (at least according to phili57 on DWI post its a bribe fee) So 30 times $200 is $6000 , and according to Phili that will pay to pave and maintain the 400 miles of highway that we have. If your coming in June on a Saturday like Phili then you get through easier because our one border guard will be busy frisking Phili and tearing their vehicle down looking for smuggled worms and leeches while they do DWI search on his party.ps: Jigster , I couldn't resist the humour that you started.It will be great when we can get back fishing and forget thinking up posts to pull peoples leg. :-)"

516474,phidelt157,2002-01-18 14:07:00,191,"Sault local,Was that slam intended for me? I wasn't sure because of the mistake in the name. Hey, I'm just trying to lower your taxes along with the others. I don't want to start all of this again. And it's July, not June if you intend on waiting for us or alerting customs. Thanks for sharing your wisdom though."
516476,Guest,2002-01-20 07:02:00,0,Because of staff shortages and holidays for our crew of three in Canada Customs we are mobilising the entire Canadian army and the navy. That will bring our staff at the Sault to 10. (I know because my wife works there at customs) We welcome the invasion of US anglers who are going to spend lots of money and save us from our desperate third world plight. We might even save enough this year to get a new roof on our Parliament buildings. We welcome the CDDA with open arms and open hands.(I'll cut you guys a deal.....only $500 under the table and you're in.....US dollars....we need new pails to carry water from the creek and the logs on the cabin need chinking):-)
516477,Guest,2002-01-28 16:59:00,0,I was just wondering where you were going in Canada? This summer I went to Happy Landing Lodge and it was the best fishing trip of my life. The fishing was the best I have ever seen anywhere and with 13 different lakes you had lost of selection. The part that was the icing on the cake was Matt and his staff they were amazing it was as though they new exactly what you wanted and it was done before you even asked. Check out the web site at www.happylandingfishing.com hope you get accross the boarder!
516475,Guest,2002-01-28 17:13:00,0,Have a good trip there 157.
