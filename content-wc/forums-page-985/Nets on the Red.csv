516601,Guest,2002-01-25 20:30:00,0,"Just recently I have found out from fellow fishing persons that there are two nets out on the Red River. Their location is between Netley Creek and the bridge to nowhere. From what I have gleaned the nets are put out by two brothers, both treaty indians. The fish they catch are cleaned on the ice and the cleanings left there. Not only that the brothers have bored numerous holes around their nets and then covered with snow to ward off those who do not agree with their methods. They are selling their fish for $2 per lb. People are quite upset, especially when it has been learned that they intend to do this every winter. I have talked to Manitoba Conservation and told them of this. They are aware of what is going on, but have no reason to interfere unless the nets are unmarked. They also said that the effect on the fishery shouldn't be a problem but...I have also mentioned that if this practice goes on through the summer, a navigational problem for boats will occur, not to mention flaring tempers. I have no problem with treaty indians doing this but what I do find offensive is that the traps set out to discourage interference. Basically human booby traps, which I believe is illegal. The commercial fishermen should also be of concern since these two gentlemen are under cutting their livelihood. I urge if any has first hand knowledge or has witnessed the setting of such traps to contact the local authorities.Thankyou."

516603,manitobawalleye,2002-01-26 17:25:00,885,edit is true...has been going on for a while...a few local selkirk boys took matters into their own hands last week extracted a pound of flesh...this week 10-12 shacks burnt probably same amount driven into...was on river from lockport to north of the new bridge yesterday afternoon and saw the aftermathbay of quinte here we go?

516605,Bobby,2002-01-26 21:45:00,211,"Just to confirm, this story is true. To first let you know where I'm coming from, I believe in sustinance fishing for treaty indians, including netting. I live on an indian reserve in Manitoba, however I am not a treaty indian myself. About 3 weeks ago, I was in the area visiting. My group was fishing about 50 yards from these nets, and we iced some big walleyes. The fellow (let's just call him ""Jack"", because that's his name!)on the Red River north of the bridge is not fishing for sustinance ONLY, everyone in the area more than just suspects this. A lot of the reason for his nets being where/how they are is due to the fact that he is angry. He is throwing nets up to block the river and to box in the ice fisherman who are out on the river in front of his property. What he's mad about is that there's a huge crowd of fisherman cutting across his riverbank property AND parking in front of his house, sometimes blocking his driveway. Its just that he's such an idiot and a hot-head that he deals with the situation by escalating the tension and anger. He sure is putting sustinance fishing in a bad light (not a good time, considering the situation in western Manitoba at Lake of the Prairies). However, I'm sure no one would have a problem with him putting up a net and feeding himself and his family - that's his right. However, if anyone does have any tips to pass along to Resources about him selling fish, that would probably be good information for them to have. And to those icefisherman who cut his nets about 3 weeks ago - way to throw fuel on the fire, idiots. We as fishermen should be courteous to others and to their property. And, it wouldn't hurt to smile at this guy when he's out there checking his nets (even if he is a moron). Once he cools down, he'll ease up. Face it, if he gets mad he can throw up all the nets he wants, LEGALLY, and really piss everyone off. But, what can we do?... nothing legally, so just let this goofball cool down so that we can get back to fishing."
516606,Guest,2002-01-27 01:20:00,0,"It's good to hear more info on this situation. I certainly understand about trespassing thru his property, I be pissed too. But a sign would suffice you think, to inform people not to trespass. As for the huts in front of his property, well you can't buy solid water unless you plan to pay tax on it. And I think from the water's edge and back 10 feet is government land.As for some huts being burned, I wonder if it is just vandalism, not just certain individuals doing the deed.Hopefully there will be a peaceful solution to this, we don't need another LOTP incident."
516607,Backwater Eddy,2002-01-27 09:36:00,3871,"This guy may find it more profitable and far less work to charge anglers to access the river from his land then it would be to net the river?Do you have a lot of vandalism on a ""Normal"" year on that section of the Red River, or is this a new deal? Cool heads are needed to solve this deal.Backwater Eddy ~ ~ ~><sUMo> ~ ><>"
516608,Guest,2002-01-27 13:02:00,0,"I think you're on the right track with that idea Eddy. It occured to me if the gentleman is concerned with huts in front of his property, why not the huts be his? If he has any ambition he could have a good little business renting ice huts out. There are a lot of anglers out there who would like to take their families out there to fish for the day. He could start out with 4 or 5 shacks with heaters in sight of his property. He could make a lot more doing this than trying to sell fish at $2 a pound.Him and his family could have a class act business catering to families if he gives it some thought. If I lived along the river I would give it some serious thought.Now if only we can sell him on this idea."
