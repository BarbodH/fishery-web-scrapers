516623,Guest,2002-01-26 15:59:00,0,"WW,I've fished alot of the lakes north of Armstrong, and I don't think there is such a thing as a bad walleye lake up there. For outfitters, try Ogoki Frontier, Armstrong Outposts, or Mattice Lake Outposts.Be careful out there,Larry"
516625,Guest,2002-01-26 19:11:00,0,I have fished Smooth Rock Lake out of Armstrong - and had a very enjoyable week. Try SmoothRock.com for more info -
516626,Kaz,2002-01-27 07:26:00,643,"Snag & Gil: Is the old Hudson Bay store just south of the Indian reservation still there? And there was an old lumber camp #86 too? We were up there many years ago and there was a old guy at the lumber camp who told stories that were great. We fished Lake Havac up over the falls in Duck Bay and had a very good Walleye fishing. Just wondered how much things have changed since then. The old Armstrong road was all sand and went thru the paper company property then, long long ago. I would appricate an update. Thanks....Waiting FOR SPRING....Kaz"
516624,Guest,2002-01-28 16:50:00,0,I agree there are no bad walleye lakes north of Armstrong.....only bad roads. A man gets spoiled up there. I had to go to physiotherapy on my shoulders after the last trip. It was worth the pain :)
516627,Guest,2002-01-29 06:06:00,0,WW-You do no;t have to drive north of Armstrong. 100 miles to the south on the Armstrong hwy.(527) is Holinshead Lake Outfitters. I have been back there for the last 13 years. It is exactly 2 1/4 hours north of Thunder Bay. It is very remote and the fishing is out of this world. 100-200 fish days with walleyes in the 18-24 in range. Be happy to help you out further. Can e-mail me at [email protected]. Good luck-Greg
516628,Guest,2002-01-29 15:48:00,0,I fished Holinshead last year.....great trip and great hosts

516630,Guest,2002-01-29 17:40:00,0,A lot of the yanks there were repeat customers. Many had been on the flyins and other than the seclusion and the experience of it the fishing was as good or almost as good on the main lake. Holinshead has a land use permit from the OMNR meaNING THAT THE PUBLIC IS EXCLUDED FROM using the road going to the lake. They have to come in through a portage. Class act
