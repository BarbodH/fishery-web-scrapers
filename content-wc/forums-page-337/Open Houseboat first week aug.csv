2621169,joeman79,2014-03-31 17:33:00,417,Our group for Canada this year has lost 2 or 3 guys for our houseboat trip to Lac Seul for the first week in August. We have 2 Boats reserved and will really only need the 68 footer. So there is a 50 ft Houseboat available that would be great for 4-6 guys!! Has A/C also which is a plus on those Hot summer Afternoons in August. Anyone interested send me a p.m. Or go to Sioux Look Floating Lodges. Just thought I would put it out there. You won't have to worry about an early ice either!! LOL
