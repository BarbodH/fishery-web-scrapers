2614914,Limeyangler,2014-03-30 11:37:00,563,Good advice. A course on customer service might not be a bad idea. Dealing with the public can be a painâ€¦.dealing with the 'paying' public brings a whole new world of pain.

2466705,123chadder,2014-02-19 11:33:00,429,i am very interested in becoming a fishing guide in ontario.....does anyone have any info ob any schools or training that is available?
2466889,dutchboy,2014-02-19 12:54:00,5717,"It's the school of hard knocks & lifes lessons. Just go fishing, read everything you get your hands on, get a job dealing with the public. Working with the public even at a grocery store will let you learn how to deal with all kinds of people. The good the bad & the real jerks. Take your neighbors and friends fishing. Pretend it's a guide trip. Practice explaining why you are doing what you are doing. Tie lines, bait hooks, clean fish. Keep them entertained. Talk to people around your area or the lake you want to work. Old timers will fill your head with idea's and theories. Sort through them. The old saying that there is no substitute for expierence. Tap the expierence of those around you then gain your own by fishing. Fish in the sun, fish in the rain, fish in the wind, fish in the dead calm. Go get 'em and good luck!!"

2467009,dutchboy,2014-02-19 13:26:00,5717,Guiding IS FISHING with public relations & education tossed in.
2467201,2746,2014-02-19 14:20:00,3206,"I think You've got it right! Over the years, as a banker, I saw lots and lots of folks get into a business because they liked the product. Like to fish and hunt...open a store to sell gear. like boats....become a boat dealer (tell us about it T-Mac) Juls can probably also tell us that liking to fish and making a business out of guiding can be two different things. When we encountered folks like that at the bank, wanting to borrow money to get started, we suggested they go work for someone already in the business for at least a year or two and learn the business side of what they wanted to do. Some took our advice and the success ratio for them was pretty good (a number changed their mind also after they saw the other side) Several ignored us, jumped into the business with money borrowed from family or taken from retirement accounts (teachers were the worst at that) and their success ratio was very poor, as in almost 100% failure. So.....my advice would be to get close to as many guides as you can, ask lots of questions about the money side and spend some time with them on the boat guiding if they will let you.....do it for free because you will be getting a real education. Good luck and be patient."

2609818,bodono47,2014-03-29 06:43:00,5,"Neil Michelin puts on guiding courses. I believe he is currently living in Dryden. Sorry don't have a phone number for him. You might want to try checking out facebook to see if you can contact him.Some lodges will train you before sending you out on the water. Depends on what type of operation they run on how much actual time they spend with you before going out. If they want guides to have success, which makes for happy clients and repeat customers, they will make sure you are confident when guiding on a particular body of water."
2613594,F250,2014-03-30 05:29:00,75,"You can begin with some basic training that will look good on any job application that you file with a lodge owner : advanced first aid, CPR, any boating course you can find ( I expect that the Canadian Coast Guard has something similar to the USCG ""six pack"" license), navigation/GPS/map and compass training, and small engine basic mechanics."
2614018,lassh,2014-03-30 08:24:00,553,I've heard that Donny Osmund is working on a guide school. You might ask V-bay Gord about that.
2614274,timetojig,2014-03-30 09:06:00,2,"Are you a U.S. citizen, if you are and want to guide in Ontario you're first going to need a work permit."
