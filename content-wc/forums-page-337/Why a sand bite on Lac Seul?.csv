2635561,Pooch,2014-04-04 03:44:00,4619,"Here I am trying to figure out sand and you scoundrels bring up clay? Ohhh man.......... now I'm really confused!Went into Sawmill last year the end of June and it was devoid of boats. Seemed to be devoid of fish also, but I doubt it. My first time and was pretty much a scouting trip.Pooch"
2636153,ftfarms,2014-04-04 07:55:00,444,By the end of june theyre probly moved out of the mud and sand back there. The water temps are probly getting hotter and they moved out to the islands and narrows of the main basin of the main lake. I'm not a walleye but just what we've found.
2638121,btmbncr,2014-04-04 15:51:00,492,"PoochWhat time of the year are you asking about for a sand bite?My post was for mid July through mid August.Early season I have had great success pitching a 1/8 oz yellow hair jig with a fathead or shiner,sometimes a 1/4 oz yellow hair jig,depending on the wind and depth.Any jig will work as long as it's bright yellow(smile). Also trolling Rapala floating 7S,7G,9S and 9G's at night works great on sand flats.I have caught some sumo eye's on 9S and 9G jointed Rapalas trolled on sand flats at night,in from 4 to 10 feet of water.I'd run 1 or 2 big split shot 2 feet up the line(8 to 10 lb.test mono) from the Rapalas.There are lots of lakes ""they"" say have no ""night bite""on them, don't believe them.I have caught lots of walleyes just before,during and just after a full moon in every month of the spring,summer and fall. Having a good,no great,bug repellent and a little drive to have the whole lake to yourself is essential.I digress.Bill"
2639761,Pooch,2014-04-05 05:51:00,4619,"I've not caught fish to speak of on these ""Sand"" areas, but some of my partners have really done well in early to mid summer. We stop once in a while at the large sand banks near the Mahkwa camp on the Labor Day trip and sometimes in the middle of nowhere catch walleye and some smallmouth. That has always mystified me.I think there have been several really good answers to my original post that make some sense to me.Lac Seul is fairly new to me (only six trips there so far) as we have mostly done flyin's or trail in's with several drive to's. Most of my really memorial fishing has been on a granite and gravel based lakes. LS with so much soft bottom has been a really fun and interesting re-learning experience for me.I like to understand the ""why"" are we catching fish here so I can better understand the ""why"" are we not catching fish, also.The ""ah ha moments"" post has been real interesting to follow and is a great reason this website continues to be first class. Even the tongue in cheek posts are a hoot. (as long as folks take them for what they are intended!)Thanks for all the comments. Please continue to chime in as you think of something to add. The more pieces of the puzzle added, the more it becomes recognizable.Pooch"
2630249,Pooch,2014-04-02 18:22:00,4619,"Sand bottom still mystifies me. Why are there walleye on what seems like a barren sand bottom? Is there a hatch of some kind going on or is there a food source that I'm not seeing there? I don't see structure, gravel, weeds, baitfish or anything. Is there some type of bottom hatching food source that can't be detected with sonar? Not even a slight change in depth. No obvious current.Sand near to or next to structure makes sense and I do well there, but just expanses of sand? Why?Thanks in advance.Pooch"
2630289,115 optimax,2014-04-02 18:31:00,650,I think there is Walleye everywhere on Lac Seul.Probably some living on land too.
2630345,Fishoil,2014-04-02 18:49:00,1277,"I fished a lake in NWO for years in the spring and wondered the same thing. Then I took a fall trip and found that every one of my sand spots had weeds, not big beds just sporadic plants. Might be the same case for you??"
2630609,btmbncr,2014-04-02 19:33:00,492,"PoochI found several of the structures they call ""Mega Sand"" on Lac Seul in the last two years.They are tapering flats that have a fairly sharp drop off edge.Last year schools of smelt were up against the edge of these and walleyes were keyed in on these schools and feeding.Sometimes the walleyes would be on the top edge of the breaks,sometimes,depending on the weather,it seems,the fish pushed down the break into deeper water.Sometimes after a couple of days of stable weather the walleyes would be on top of these ""tapering flats"".These ""flats"" aren't featureless.One of my wife's favorite spots to check/fish is a long point of sand,out at least 100 yards from shore are some ""humps"",spots that are 1 to 1 1/2 feet higher than the surrounding bottom area.These spots do/will hold walleyes.There may be bait schools up on this flat.The walleyes aren't actively pursuing them.Lots of times you'll see the baitfish,in this case it was smelt, just stacked in along the edge of the Mega Sand with big arches or hooks on the depth finder screen that turned out to be walleyes. We have found the baitfish stacked along rock reef edges but more and more I look for the sand"" Mega Sand"" spots as the smelt get stacked up along them alot.We have found them to produce better than rock reefs.I can't say I've ever cleaned a walleye from Lac Seul that had anything in it's stomach other than smelt or leeches.This being late July and the first three weeks of August. That's been my limited experience on Lac Seul.Bill"
2631913,Bill Krejca,2014-04-03 07:34:00,6107,"Just relying on my past experiences re: sand. One of our favorite LOW night pastimes was to quietly walk the darkened beaches with a flashlight. It is a different world at night - the sand is full of various food chain creatures feeding , especially minnows, but also crawfish, perch, small bass, small walleye, crappie, etc, etc. They most times won' t move much in the light, if you move/shine slowly. Accompanying this smorgesboard of food, will be seen larger walleyes, and the occasional pike, depending on the water. (Waves coming in to the beach during the day create accessible plankton, small (and sometimes large) fish flesh pieces, etc, and the small to large eating process begins.) My theory re: why there during the day is that some of these predators remain into the day, perhaps just a bit deeper, to savor the meal, and hoping for another morsel or two. The next question is why do walleyes prefer to hangout where a certain type of weed is growing right next to shore? Bill"
2632113,Hillbiehle,2014-04-03 08:08:00,66,"I always thought the reason was the sand warmed quicker and attracted the baitfish. I always stop and investigate when I see a shoreline where chunk rock meets sand or a weed line meets sand, or current is pushing in on sand."
2632377,octanehi5,2014-04-03 08:48:00,1104,"Weeds always hold baitfish, Sand or rocky bottom, Were you find bait you will find Walter. On a good windy day middle of the afternoon sun you can catch them in a foot of water were the waves are slapping against the rocks,feeding on baitfish or mayfly hatches or nimphs. Dead calm days fish 40+ feet or better"
2633601,bodono47,2014-04-03 14:02:00,5,Burrowing mayflies live in the sand. They are tucker for walleyes and small minnows. Fish come into feed on the sand. There are certain times in June when huge numbers of walleye can be found on sand or mud for that matter. Brown jigs work very well at this time of year.
2635009,ftfarms,2014-04-03 20:23:00,444,That was always my secret spot in late may early june when we fished lac suel. Way in the back part of sawmill bay. You got to go across the shallow mud flat to get to it. Years ago we would be one of the only ones back there. Sand and stumps was all that was there the water was a couple degrees warmer. We've caught several over seven pound walleyes there with the biggest being 12lbs 11ozs.
2635121,Knoxabilly,2014-04-03 20:53:00,225,"FTF- further back then the ""Clay Banks"" right?"
