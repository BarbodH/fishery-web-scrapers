My wife is usually pushing the cart through the aisles, and I'm thumbing through In Fisherman. In my area, I've only found one magazine that caters to walleye fisherman, and that's a special edition published by In Fisherman. It must be a quarterly or semi-annual publishing, since the same mag has been on the shelf for quite some time now. I was going to buy the mag one time until I noticed the cover price was $6, and I figured that's more than I wanted to spend for two articles and 100 ads. Is there a decent magazine out there I can subscribe to?"

More info on the internet for free. Plus I think most people aren't falling for the old ""Field and Stream"" crap of every lake they ever fished was the best. It was entertaining reading when I was 12...."

If I have a question or I'm looking for specific info, I can get it here from real folks like me that don't have a hidden agenda. Everyone on TV or featured in a magazine is being paid by someone."

2634025,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-03 15:57:00,1460,"IMHO, the best magazine out there is Ontario Out of Doors. With Mike Borger being a feature writer, it's a nobrainer to support one of our own."

2634049,Skywagon,2014-04-03 16:05:00,1106,"A magazine I enjoy is Ontario Out Of Doors. There are usually good articles on walleye as well as other species of fish and game animals. Some of the contributors to the magazine frequent this forum and live in N/W Ontario where many of you fish (Dryden, Kenora, Sioux Lookout, Thunder Bay) are some of their homes that come to mind. I do not know if it is available by subscription on line, but is available in magazine form in the US. You can subscribe through their website or phone number is 800-361-0645."
