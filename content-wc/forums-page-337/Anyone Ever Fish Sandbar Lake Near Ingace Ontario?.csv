2466753,Sportdog,2014-02-19 12:11:00,6735,I have a resort rental north of Ignace Ontario and thought about going up a little early and do some camping and fishing. Sandbar Lake Provincial Park is on the way to the cabin and I wondered if anyone has fished this lake and if it's worthy of fishing. Other recommendations for other camping/fishing spots in the Ignace area would also be appreciated. Thank You.

2578553,wtw_fisherman,2014-03-21 11:25:00,13,I have been to the campgrounds years ago. Good ramp in the campgrounds. A lot of weeds in west end of the lake. Northern s on spinner baits in weeds. Walleye in weeds by the point that separates the lake in two.
2581601,stillangling,2014-03-22 08:49:00,149,"I have a few suggestions for you. Sandbar can be pretty good but not at the top of my list. If you fish there after the pondweed (cabbage) gets up to or close to the surface there is a big bed of it about 100 yds out from the beach at the provincial park. Walleye can be thick there. Better bet would be Barrel Lake to the north and it is right off of highway 599. If you are willing to pound your truck and trailer up the 325 Road, there is a public launch into Indian Lake right where Sandbar flows into Indian. Actually Little Indian but they are connected. If you go north from there, Arethusa and Flatrock are awesome. I have had some crazy trips on Flatrock pitching jigs into open patches in pondweed beds. Sometimes you can actually see the fish grab your jig. Kukukus Lake is and adventure to get to but very worthwhile but be prepared to shake the fillings out of your teeth getting there and it is 4x4 country once you are north of Arethusa. Also be prepared for some ""brush rash"" on your truck. John Rousseau has a lodge on Sandbar but also has boats and motors on Kukukus that he rents out. That is a far less adventurous option if you want to fish the lake because his boats are at the south end. The launch is at the north end and takes at least another hour to drive to and is by far the roughest section of the road."

Besides those times however, your better off playing cards and drinking beer, cuz the fish turn off completely. Barrel can be good, but the English River right there can be awesome."
2592489,3M TA3,2014-03-25 08:11:00,2846,"Stayed on Sandbar at John's place last August and fished Sandbar a few times during that stay. Caught lots of Walleyes, some that were very old. Knocked the heck out of the Pike, many over 36 inches. Our best fishing experience was using John's boats at Kukukus. Walleye, Small Mouth, and Pike. Great time and John and his staff are great folks. I'll be going back again."
2593377,northerneyes,2014-03-25 12:03:00,72,Where would be the best spots for walleye on Barrel? I have fished near the rapids going into Press lake. Any other areas to try?
2594009,tjandy,2014-03-25 15:07:00,107,Have you ever got out and thrown in that bay above the rapids? I have caught some big walleyes up there. I would need to see a map to remember the areas we have fished. Its been 14 years since we were there.
2608834,stillangling,2014-03-28 20:02:00,149,It has been a very long time since I fished Barrel but early in the season there is a good bite on the east side of the islands just as you enter the main lake from the English River (coming from 599)
