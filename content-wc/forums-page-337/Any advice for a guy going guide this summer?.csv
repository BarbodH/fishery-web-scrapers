2609178,bodono47,2014-03-28 21:30:00,5,"Guideboy,Lac Seul is gigantic! Need to know which lodge you'll be working at. I guide on Lac Seul also, can't give info if you are guiding in a different area as myself."
2609290,NWwalleye,2014-03-28 21:57:00,223,"I guide out there as well, I have guided from Ear Falls, from Scout Bay and Williams Bay areas for the past 20 years ... I would say that, I have very good knowledge of these areas.. If you are up in the Sioux Lookout / Hudson area, I can not help to you .... Guideboy....I sure hope you know the lake or have someone to show you some safe routes in the area you are going to be working !!!Or another guide will be willing to let you tag along until you feel comfortable ..AND .... Yes, Lac Seul is huge ... Be Careful ...."
2609898,btmbncr,2014-03-29 07:04:00,492,"Learn the Lake,ie when the mayflies hatch where is the hot bite?,what about late ice out?Where are the fish in late September? Where do the lake shiners spawn,what water temps for Lake Shiner spawning?What humps do the leeches show up on in late summer? The Professional Guides I know seem to be able to produce walleye limits on demand all season here,they are the true professionals.Bill"
2628961,JinxCanada,2014-04-02 12:55:00,1306,"well, my advice would be to make sure you have a Canadian Work Permit. It is illegal for an American to guide in Canada without a work permit, even if the lodge is owned by an American company."
2603185,SinOrSwim,2014-03-27 16:13:00,1528,"Try to read people. Some want to talk some don't. You just have to get a feel for who you are fishing with and try to tailor the trip to them.And, whatever you do.........leave YOUR personal life at home. Even if the guest talks politics, religion or his pain in the *** wife. Don't discuss yours. Nobody wants to hear about your divorce or any other negative happenings in your life. That is a lot of time to spend with a person you don't know. Try your best to get a feel for them. That is easier said than done and will come with experience. But, some guys do not take kindly to someone telling them how to fish. Some do. Personally, I want to learn. Ask them questions about how much they fish etc. If they only fish once or twice a year watch them and try to offer some helpful tips. Maybe a different knot that is faster and stronger. You just have to be careful. Some egos will not handle being told what and how to do things. I like to hear interesting things about the lake and the surrounding area.Agree with the others who say have fun and smile."
2603201,Blades-n-Beads,2014-03-27 16:21:00,484,"GuideBoy, congratulation!! You have just landed in a position that many walleye central people would die for. If we could turn that big darn time clock back a few years. You are truly blessed and don't forget that for one min every day you awake. Wonderful people there and breath taking beauty you get to see every day and get paid for to boot!! I wish the very best for ya."
2603601,yoopertrout,2014-03-27 17:32:00,1172,"Sounds I like a great gig! Here's my two cents, based on having been a guide for a while, and based on have used guides:1. Smile.2. Offer advice, but not too much (even if you are with a fisherman who is repeatedly doing the dumbest thing in the world.)3. Compliment, but don't look like you are kissing butt.4. Work hard, as though you were the one paying for the day on the water, but, remember that some people aren't as concerned with numbers and size as many of us are, and just want a good all around experience.5. Know a little history of the area, and tell a few stories.6. Point out wildlife.7. Be thankful even if you don't get a tip - some people honestly don't know that you are supposed to tip guides.8. Don't brag about better days, or really brag at all.9. Never say ""You should have been here last week.""10 Never talk politics, even if they bring it up.11. Display your own enthusiasm for fishing, and it will rub off, even on those in the boat who are along for the ride with a fishing spouse.Have fun!"
2604033,lassh,2014-03-27 19:09:00,553,"Nice job Guideboy! One thing to remember each day- don't take your position for granted. Yes, its exciting right now. But human nature will pressure you to take it for granted after doing it for a while. Cherish the opportunity and understand that with all the hard work, the lack of sleep, the slumps, bratty clients (there will be some); there will be great opportunities to excel. Focus each day to learn and to be positive, in spite of things that may happen that seem negative. I have yet to fish Lac Seul, but perhaps sometime I can come up and let you show me the ropes. Enough preaching, but I hope you get the point. You are going to have a riot! Enjoy yourself and cherish the resource of Canadian fishing."
2604666,roscoe33,2014-03-28 03:11:00,653,"Congrats. Never smoke in the boat. Carry a bag of extras for the customers, just in case they forget something, or lose something overboard.: Hand warmers, dry gloves, tylenol, a spare rod, maybe a few power bars or granola bars."
2604794,NWwalleye,2014-03-28 05:38:00,223,"Something I think about, when I am out guiding for the day.....""Treat everyone the way you want to be treated on a vacation of your own.."""
2604810,NWwalleye,2014-03-28 05:42:00,223,#2This is all great advice ..
2604954,AllenW,2014-03-28 06:46:00,11482,"Keep it fun for them AND you, many times when a hobby becomes a job it becomes work and not fun anymore. Good luck. Al"
2605978,tlars,2014-03-28 10:00:00,137,"Treat every customer like they are your only customer for the summer. Teach yourself to think where a conversation might lead. That will help you avoid embarrassing moments! When you're in the people service business, you can't ever have a tired, or crabby or down day. Every day counts. And, be happy. Have fun. It's contagious. Good luck."
2608082,v-bay gord,2014-03-28 16:52:00,3168,"All these responses makes me think I would be fishing with Donny Osmond. I remember way back in the day (30 years ago) when I started guiding, some of the old, old guides were characters....nothing like what is being recommended here. Hard drinkers, slow talkers, and prone to the odd acts of erratic behavior. Terrible cooks for the most part....many of them preferred to eat the Spam that was always in the shore-box....the clients ate the walleye. Greasy potatoes......and gut rot in the afternoons. Ahhh...the good old days!"
2601449,GuideBoy,2014-03-27 10:12:00,7,"I just landed my dream job as a guide at a top notch lodge on Lac Seul for this summer. I have plenty of guiding and outdoor experience. I want to rake in those tips and make sure you guys have the best time. What makes a good guide, and what can I do to make your trip better? What are some things you like a guide to do/don't do. Any advice would be great!"
2601561,Juls,2014-03-27 10:36:00,13414,You'll find a lot of great advice in this thread...https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ighlight=guide
2601577,bigwalleye1,2014-03-27 10:42:00,2632,"First, congratulations on the new job. What to do? ASK. Ask me if I want to solely be brought to a hungry bunch of fish to catch them, or if I want to learn locations, or techniques, or structure, or biomass, or seasonal movements, or what makes this the place to be rather than over yonder. ask me if I want to hear some of the history of the lake, the area, ask me how I want to spend my day. Offer suggestions about what I can try rather than tell me what to do. Teach me to fish if that's what I want rather than take me fishing. Fish with me rather than making me fish with you. Make a memory for me and my group. Make me want to tip you, tip you well, and go with you again. Cook lunch for us if that's what we want, even if the fish are jumping in the boat, or be willing to fish all day without lunch if that's how we want to spend our day. Finally, smile. A lot. You've got a lot to smile about. After all, you've got a great job in a perfect location, and hopefully working for one of the best employers in the area."
2601593,Mike Kansas,2014-03-27 10:44:00,1463,Well said
2601721,JDP,2014-03-27 11:12:00,1457,"He was the ""OP"" on that thread...probably has that info."
2601929,Juls,2014-03-27 11:32:00,13414,"Ahhh yes....good catch. I didn't see that, because I have my settings to show most recent posts first, so the OP didn't show up when I opened it. And, he never came back to answer the last question. Had he done that, his name would have been at the top of the page and I would have seen it. Glad to hear you got that job GuideBoy."
2602385,GuideBoy,2014-03-27 13:19:00,7,"This is great, thanks for the tips!"
2602665,I Wire Em,2014-03-27 14:07:00,16,Congrats on the New Job . Looking to Fish Lac Seul at a First Class Lodge this season . Care to share some info?? Thanks in Advance
2602761,dutchboy,2014-03-27 14:32:00,5717,Rule #1...............................pump product. Name your resort.
2602793,Fisherman Ted,2014-03-27 14:46:00,461,"That other thread on guide tips was excellent. I am still in the process of hiring my last guide. As I said earlier, I see at least 10 resumes each day, cull one in maybe 40 and then put out offers to maybe 10% after the interviews. Be personable, engaging, friendly, courteous, polite and fun. I can't tell you how much it bothers me to have to turn away great fishermen because they can't put a sentence together, or they are rude on the phone even. You will be part of someone's highlight of the year for many, many guests. They will be so excited (and even anxious) to be fishing on their dream trip. The energy in the boat is sometimes palpable. The more engaging you are the more fun they will have. Yes, you have to put them on fish. But they will talk about you for years if you are all of the above. -Fisherman Ted P.S. Careful what you put out in social media. Those things can come back to haunt you. Just saying........"
