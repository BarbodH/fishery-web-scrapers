1443749,RapShad,2012-06-01 21:50:00,76,Our boat will be using it for the first time this year as well. Should be interesting to see what's down there. In Lac Seul I imagine you will see a lot of stumps and walleyes.
2585593,jmsteele,2014-03-23 12:05:00,19,Im going to be fishing Lac Seul for the first time this year and thinking about picking up a DI. How much did it help you guys?
2590481,jaym,2014-03-24 17:32:00,89,"I don't go to Lac Seul but I started taking my side imaging as a portable unit a couple of years ago on our train-in. It's fantastic, I found structure I didn't know was there because we didn't go directly over it in previous years and it is easier to find structure you already know about and you get a better idea of the layout."

2609970,btmbncr,2014-03-29 07:20:00,492,I was surprised how Down imaging helped to clearly identify structure.Side Imaging help me/lead me to see structure I had never found before.Walleye fishing just got more fun.billius aka btmbncr aka Backtroller Billy!!
