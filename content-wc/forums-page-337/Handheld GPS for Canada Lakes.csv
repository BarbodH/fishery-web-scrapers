2643297,jimmie,2014-04-06 00:07:00,123,"Garmin 12 or later model should work fine. 12 should be around $70 used on eBay and up for the higher tech units. It will track so much for you. Keep mph, distances ect ect"
2643465,rickn,2014-04-06 05:37:00,993,Why can't you just put waypoints down with your existing GPS? You don't need a picture of the lake to do that. Just curious?
2644193,Mojo-NC,2014-04-06 09:21:00,1929,"Thanks everyone! I wish we were able to use our own boats and equipment in Canada, but we can't. We fly to INL-MN from NC, rent a truck and drive up into Canada. We're very limited with how much stuff we can bring along with us, so a handheld GPS seems like just the ticket. I prefer not to use my phone as the GPS - those things are too dang moisture sensitive and we generally get a lot of wet when we're up there. It's good to hear recommendations based on your personal experiences. Tight lines!"
2644857,adempsey,2014-04-06 13:34:00,963,"I have a Garmin eTrex 20 and my buddy uses the Lowrance iFinder H2O C. Both products are discontinued.I like my eTrex, but I did have to purchase two map chips at $100 each to cover the lakes I was fishing. For some reason my default map never showed any lakes, regardless if the depth map was available or not. That may have been my fault and never set it up properly. However, my friends iFinder had all the lakes on his map. They just weren't depth maps. Worked just fine for marking spots where he caught fish.Also, I found the Garmin takes forever to locate satellites. Not a big deal, but it can get annoying. I also had a problem with the case. I always bring my GPS with me and just leave it resting in the boat so I can access it. Well, it's been out in the sun a lot and that basically destroyed the glue holding the rubber parts of the case on. So it's probably not as waterproof as it used to be.So, if I were to purchase again I would start with what maps are included and what I need to purchase. Other than that, I'd say they all function similarly. Regardless of my issues, I'd still consider buying a Garmin again."
2637593,Mojo-NC,2014-04-04 13:18:00,1929,"Do any of you guys bring a handheld GPS unit with you to Canada? If so, which unit would you recommend? The lake we usually fish is not topographically mapped, so I'm looking for a decent waterproof unit that I can use to mark off shore structure with waypoints to indicate where we typically catch fish. Thanks!"
2637737,1-shot,2014-04-04 14:01:00,35,"I have a garmin e trex 20 that I bring with me and my brother has an e trex 10. I like the 20 better because it has some additional features not on the 10. Took me a while to get comfortable with using it because i didn't think it was very user friendly. After using it extensively, I am now much more comfortable with it. It is water proof and I am able to mark out way points where I was catching fish and able to return and pinpoint the exact area. It is compatable for additional chips and i thought about purchasing one which included a bunch of the ontario lakes, but after researching it decided against it. Lots of demo's on how to use it on youtube.Good luck. 1-shot"
2638881,bushead11,2014-04-04 18:46:00,151,"I got a garmin etrex venture on ebay for about 65 bucks for deer hunting. It worked great in Canada as well. I had a North American topo map that just had the outlines of the bodies of water we were fishing, so I wasn't using it for contours/depth. Was a great tool to mark waypoints to make sure we could hit our hot spots and make it back to the lodge every day. the ""tracback"" tool was great way to explore new areas without getting nervous. Just be sure to have an extra set of batteries. and if the unit is not waterproof just put it in a sealable sandwich bag..."

2639153,NARDA 1,2014-04-04 20:12:00,636,"If you have a smartphone, navionics offers an app for about $15 that allows you to mark waypoints along with several other features."
2639193,Nimstug,2014-04-04 20:32:00,2605,"I use a Garmin Venture with Map Source Hot Spots map. Canada Lakes are limited with the software so will want to see what can be loaded onto whatever handheld you decide to get. The maps I have are older but it works for me. Maybe there are more available now. I've used the software to mark humps or whatever on the map on the computer then load them onto the gps. Very close to right on. Since I usually go north just once a year, this simple and inexpensive set up works well for me. I still carry a ""paper"" chart and have my partner watch it while we travel. We just use the gps for marking spots or finding them, not for real navigation. NimstugCommit to the Indian"
