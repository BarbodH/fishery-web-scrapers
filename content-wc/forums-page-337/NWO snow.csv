The sun is high now and we do have some melting going on today, (thus him sinking down to the slush). On the plus side, the walleye were biting, the sun was shining, it was a perfect day to be out."

2624401,v-bay gord,2014-04-01 10:16:00,3168,I will be posting ice out updates for the Vermilion Bay area if anyone is interested... www.electricbeaver.ca
2624737,Blue Lk,2014-04-01 11:29:00,269,"April 1,today is the official start of MNR's Forest Fire Management Season.The Dryden Fire Center is ready to gohttp://i631.photobucket.com/albums/u...pscb5fb970.jpg"
2625825,Pooch,2014-04-01 15:29:00,4619,Planting is probably a lot further off than most of us would like. Ground is pretty much frost free but really soaked. With really great weather it will several weeks off. Most likely the end of April with good luck. Kind of like the ice out situation on NWO.Mostly I was messin' with Skywagon. Need to poke him with a stick once in a while just for entertainment. He's a lot of fun and it's pretty hard to get ahead of him and his crew. Whether fishing or farming!The four forecasters that Pro Farmer interviewed all seem to think cold and wet start to this planting season followed by an El Nino event that is now forming and will most likely dictate the mid to late growing season weather.I'm glad we don't start our Canada trips until the end of June. This is going to be an interesting season for all of us.Pooch
2626529,Skywagon,2014-04-01 18:19:00,1106,"Snow blowing today. https://www.dropbox.com/s/tpp53f3fzz...ing%20snow.jpg If you look closely to the right of the machine is the top of our 7 foot high deer fence for the garden. I don't believe we will be hooking onto the planter to quick to try to get the sweet corn crop in. Today I realized how much I am loved in the neighborhood, I was invited over by 3 neighbors. I ended up blowing snow all day. The upshot to this, was it gave me lots of time to think and scheme about the financial plight I have found myself in. Times have been tough this winter, I have not been a good provider for the family, aquatic cuisine has rarely been on the menu, as I have been fishing too little because of the harsh weather. By the middle of February we were forced to eat the minnows we were keeping in the fridge. Fortunately today I had one of those ah ha moments that were discussed in a previous thread, I have come up with the perfect way to finance my fishing addiction. I wanted to give my friends on Walleye Central first crack at this special offer (hope I don't get kicked off for advertising), but here goes: It has now been determined that ice-out will not occur until after the 3nd week of June, so for all you guys and gals that have already put in for vacation, I have the perfect solution, SKYWAGON'S ICE CONDO'S. These are super deluxe models I purchased from FEMA (only slightly used for a short time in New Orleans), they will be placed on the lake of my choice. Each unit will come equipped with a 5 foot hand auger for your convenience and here is the best part: our fleet of snow machines will make beer deliveries every night after the Conservation Officers are tucked in bed. For more information, feel free to PM my booking agent Pooch."
2626609,Pooch,2014-04-01 18:48:00,4619,"Disregard what Skywagon just said.... Appears he has gottn' the Av Gas mixed up with the Rum bottle again.See what happens when you take a good honest hardworking flatlander and transplant him into Ontario. We are not genetically predisposed to survive the long winter up there like the rest of our great northern neighbors.It's sad when this happens.PoochPS: Next time try a little garlic on the minnows. At least you're not deep frying leeches like Bobo, Tom and Doc just to see how they taste.... I fish with some very strange people."

2634145,WalleyeMatt,2014-04-03 16:42:00,93,"OK, now its our turn, this is the 3rd of April isn't it. At this time I can't see across the lake and they are calling for 10"" to 14"". I know it's not as much as you guys got north of the boarder but any amount is to much. I thought I told you to keep it up there. Winds are out of the north so this belongs to you. Matt"
2634225,Skywagon,2014-04-03 17:03:00,1106,"It's great to share the joy. We don't mind snow unless it interferes with access to the ice, which it has in some cases this year. A smidgen above freezing today, with more of the same forecast for the coming week. Two more weeks left to chase walleyes before season closes here, trout are fair game until the ice gets bad."
2638113,prov1800,2014-04-04 15:49:00,5010,"Went out for some trout today with a couple buddies.you'd never know we had 47 cm of snow a few days ago.some of the best riding conditions so far this year.only had to shovel 6-10"" of snow before we hit frozen slush.seems like about a foot or so of that stuff and then there's still only about 28-30"" of good ice.was a beautifull day with the +2 and sunshine.by the time we left the top of the snow was getting pretty spongy.couple of weeks if the weather cooperates it should start melting pretty good"
2620337,NWwalleye,2014-03-31 15:09:00,223,"Rick, I was wishing that you were going to be right ....But ... you are so wrong ... We are getting a ton of snow today and tomorrow ..."
2620345,Skywagon,2014-03-31 15:16:00,1106,"This picture was taken at about 2:00 pm today showing our Golden Retriever (oblivious to the snow), with a squirrel treed in our backyard. https://www.dropbox.com/s/024l8ny1dfq280e/snowstorm.jpg The white in the background is where you should be seeing lake, but is a whiteout instead. Don't worry, this new foot of snow will burn off in no time, right after it warms up and the sun comes out."
2620377,WalleyeMatt,2014-03-31 15:27:00,93,"Hey guys, check out Accuweather.com. You are listed as currently having a blizzard and go to heavy snow after that. Please keep it up there, I have had enough. Good Luck. Matt"
2620633,prov1800,2014-03-31 16:20:00,5010,"Thx matt? Its a good one.I think the blowing snow is the worst.just finished plowing with my a tv, figured I better get rid of some of it now.and do it again tomorrow."
2621241,Skywagon,2014-03-31 17:42:00,1106,The TransCanada Highway is currently closed between Ignace and Vermillion Bay because of snow and it is almost April. I think that is like a sign from the ground hog (6 more weeks of winter).
2621433,Pooch,2014-03-31 18:04:00,4619,I'm hooked up to the planter. Please keep the white stuff up there.Wife likes your puppy picture.Pooch
2623441,Skywagon,2014-04-01 06:50:00,1106,"Still snowing this morning, supposed to continue through today, 19 inches of new snow so far. When the wife took the dog out this morning, the snow was so deep, she had to flatten down a place with her snowshoes for the dog to poop. My machinery is hooked up here too Pooch. Skid steer to Snowblower."
2623721,prov1800,2014-04-01 07:52:00,5010,"Well instead of digging through a couple of feet of snow to drill a hole, now will have to dig a extra foot after our lovely storm yesterday.it was a good one.still expecting around another 2- 5"".clean up day today.weather is expected to get warmer and stay above 0c.hopefully we are over the hump.7 weeks till the opener not a lot of time but things can happen quickly."

2617330,roscoe33,2014-03-30 20:56:00,653,"Watches/warnings in effect for northern Ontario... Snowfall warning for: Atikokan - Upsala - Quetico Kakabeka Falls - Whitefish Lake - Arrow Lake Red Lake - Woodland Caribou Park Gull Bay - black Sturgeon Lake Beardmore - Jellicoe - Macdiarmid Geraldton - Longlac - Caramat Nakina - Aroland - Pagwa. Current indications suggest that 15 to 25 centimetres of snow are possible for regions in the snowfall warning. Local blowing snow reducing visibility is also likely. Winter Storm Warning for: Kenora - Nestor Falls Dryden - Ignace Fort Frances - Rainy Lake Ear Falls - Perrault Falls - Western Lac Seul Sioux Lookout - Savant Lake Armstrong - Auden - Wabakimi Park. Significant amounts of snow are likely across portions of northwestern Ontario. Such winter storms often bring total snowfall amounts of 20 to 30 cm, and locally higher amounts are possible. Thats 6-12"" Still way to much. I'm thinking we will have ice on the opener, 2 years in a row."

2617921,Skywagon,2014-03-31 06:24:00,1106,"All the weather reports I am reading this morning are talking about up to 30cm (11.8 inches) of snow accumulation. Something important has come of all this snow talk, we now know how prov1800 is coming up with all those 30 inch walleyes, he is converting from metric using a flawed calculator, 60 cm=23.62 inches, not 30 inches (where do you buy those at? I want one). No worries about riding snowmobiles for sometime to come Limey. At this rate I don't think we will be using 4-wheelers on the lake before season closes this year."
