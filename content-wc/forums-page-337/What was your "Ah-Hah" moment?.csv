2636025,doubleheader,2014-04-04 07:29:00,2652,"Cool thread guys. I learned what was possible on the west arm of Lake Nipissing in the 1960's. I was just a young kid. We'd catch a few walleye but one morning I stopped into the fish house and there was a guy cleaning 3 of the biggest walleyes I had ever seen. I must have turned green with envy, we had never caught anything remotely close to that size, let alone 3 in one morning. I couldn't get over the size of the eyes, the scales, or anything about these fish, so the next day when I heard the screen door slam on the fish house I took off running; sure enough, there was the same guy with 2 more monsters. I was pretty young but my curiosity won out over my shyness. I started asking him questions and thankfully he was the kind of guy that enjoyed teaching a kid a thing or two. His technique was back trolling a flatfish tipped with porkrine and using considerable weight to fish deep ledges. While I was just a kid I can tell you our presentation never varied. We used a worm harness and drifted weedbeds or found current in the narrows and anchored for hours on end. So this guy, with his 12' aluminum boat and funny looking fishing lure, well, he blew my young mind. I would have to say this was the first Ahhhaa moment of my fishing life. The lesson was a simple one. ""Don't be afraid to change things up. keep moving keep experimenting until you hit on what works"". Many years later, 2007 to be exact, 4 boats and probably 40 tournaments later, on the same body of water, the Ah haa moment came full circle. There were 4 of us in 2 boats and after about 3 days we hit on a pattern that to this day is the best walleye fishing I've ever experienced; it lasted for 2 weeks. There was a boat docked beside us from Ohio, they were walleye fishermen, but like us, years ago, were stuck in the traditional pattern of weedbed fishing. We were catching these fish in 25 fow, trolling very slow with very specific bait. While we released all our over the slot fish every day we'd take a couple back to the dock for pictures before release. The look on the boys faces in the boat beside us was priceless, and just like years ago, after a day or so their curiosity overcame their shyness."

2636425,orchard frank,2014-04-04 09:02:00,1900,"Spent a lot of time up there, couple things that took me a while to realize: There are always (almost) some very nice walleyes much shallower than I originally thought. Even on hot, calm, sunny days. Casting to weed edges in 2-4' of water seems wrong, but they are there. Agree on trolling cranks, Hot N Tot in gold/pink is a winner. And, found out how productive anchoring on top of a reef or point in the wind can be. Cast or drop a jig right over the side, the fish will come to you, they are on the prowl, and no fighting with boat control."
2636913,wallydave,2014-04-04 10:46:00,2151,Last couple of years I have been fishing with some different guys. I'm learning some new methods and starting to get over the fear of trying something new. If one method isn't working lets try something new. The day we stop learning is the day to call it quits!
2637057,MrSimon,2014-04-04 11:17:00,922,I was about 12 or 13 cleaning small to medium sized walleye and pike when a dad and his son came into the cleaning house. They pulled a monster walleye and a monster pike out of their cooler and flopped them on the table. I about fell over. I didn't even know fish that big existed. Its something when you see a true monster in person for the first time. I asked them what they used and they just said ..... jigs. I had to nod and pretend I even knew what a jig was. All I'd ever done is cast spoons.
2637481,Kansas Bound,2014-04-04 12:53:00,152,Great stories fellas!
2637889,The Donger,2014-04-04 14:31:00,48,Slow trolling a deep down husky jerk around rocky points works nicely as well. Silver and black seems to work the best. Less production on the fire tiger pattern. I got a gold and black to try this year. I do like the trolling for a change of pace and generally do it when I am solo in a boat. Jigging still produces the best numbers though. We fly in so it is always crawlers for us.
2639409,btmbncr,2014-04-04 21:43:00,492,"Never had an ""Ah Ha"" moment.It has been a long learning experience for me starting in earnest since 1962.About half or a little more each year I learn from my own discovery;ie stuff I try myself or what my wife ""teaches"" me through watching her fish walleyes.The other stuff comes from friends or written material.Bill"

2628833,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-02 12:28:00,1460,"When I first started fishing in Ontario, we used nothing but bare caribou jigs, rapalas, sonars blade baits and other assorted cranks. This went on for about 2 or 3 years till we were having a shore lunch on Wapikimanski one day (1972 or 1973) and a local Indian paddled up to where we were at. We offered lunch and this man readily accepted. Never shy about obtaining fishing information, we sat around the fire exchanging information. Now, I was only 10 or 11 at the time but I remember he pulled his pole outta his canoe and showed us what he used. All he had on was this old, banged up, ugly Prescott spinner of which he proudly announced that ""You guys don't need all that fancy crap to catch walleye, you just need a spinner and put some meat on it"". Ah Ha........ Well, we say that we don't got any meat, how do you get yours clear out here? ""I trap my own minnows and leaches"" he proudly exclaimed. ""But if ya don't have any minnows or leaches let me show ya what to do"". We all go over to where the fish guts were and he grabs a northern outta the pile. ""First thing I do when I cut one of these up is to cut out the northern gullet""....... ""This is how ya do it""...... ""The next thing I look for is the hard gut, not the soft gut but the hard gut"", and he shows us exactly what he was talking about. This particular shore lunch is one I'll never forget nor will I ever forget the name of that particular Indian who came to us and helped us. I've heard that he has passed away many years ago but by legacy sake, he will be remembered and I think that matters."
2628969,tooski,2014-04-02 12:58:00,393,"Pikeslayer, Very similar story. His name is easy to remember even though it has been 50 years...Sylvester Bedwash. How could you forget that name?"
2629009,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-02 13:07:00,1460,Very cool! And now his name lives on for infamy by the power of Walleye Central!!!!!!! May haunt my dreams though. The Indian on Wapakimanski's name was very ordinary. Norman Andersen.

2629113,worthsr,2014-04-02 13:23:00,52,"I was a teenager when I first started fishing NW Ontario. I went with a couple close friends and their dads, uncles etc. They like to vertical jig, primarily in 10-15 feet of water. We caught walleye, way more than we ever would in northern Illinois or Wisconsin. Then one year we hired an Indian guide for the day. He looked at our gear and said he will be back in 5 minutes. It turns out he went into the main lodge and grabbed a handful off spinner harnesses and some 3/8 ounce bead chain weights. We left the dock and zoomed past the 10-15 foot deep waters we normally fished and pulled up four feet from shore and back trolled in 3-7 feet or water. The action was so fast and furious we started using 3 or 4 inch twister tails instead of minnows. We rarely lost fish and couldn't believe we were pulling 26"" walleyes out of stumps in water that was 3 feet deep. I still bring a 10 pound box of jigs, a box full or cranks and a box full of spoons. But all I really need is a handful of Klass Spinners (with steel line), a few 3/8 ounce bead chain weights and a couple bags of twister tails. We fish Lac Seul, the third full week of June every year and put 100 walleye in each boat most days. I catch plenty of walleyes in the 25-28 inch range but have never caught a 30 incher. I'm sure I need to try something different to get that trophy fish I've been looking for and I'm looking forward to that ah-ha moment. Scott"

2626377,BornToFish,2014-04-01 17:46:00,1224,"Most of the lakes that I fish near home are fairly shallow, mostly mud basins, have expansive weed beds, have relatively warm water during the summer and have relatively fertile water due in part to run-off. The lake(s) that I fish in NW Ontario have much deeper, less fertile and colder water. These lakes have modest weeds at best, but the few weeds that are present, can be very important to the fishery. Much of the bottom of these lakes are comprised of rock and gravel based as opposed to soft bottoms. Structure is far more important to my fishing in NW Ontario compared to fishing in my home waters."
2626417,BornToFish,2014-04-01 17:51:00,1224,I sense that trolling for walleyes in NW Ontario might very well be my next frontier to explore. I've done most of my work to date with the proverbial jig + minnow combination. Would you please offer suggestions for keys to your trolling success for walleyes during August and September? Many sincere thanks in advance.

2626817,Terwalleye,2014-04-01 19:16:00,166,"Fish in the wind At least that is what i thought for ever. Have always been a live bait guy and have always preferred the slip bobber approach. Heck in WI that's three lines out and I still have a free hand to hold my beer.So year one going to CA was one of those years everything melted early and it was a nice spring. So when we got up there everything was far enough along and the weed lines were very well developed. Found a weed edge, dropped anchor, slip bobber in, caught fish. Fast forward a year or two and the ice didn't melt until the days leading up to the opener. We show up a few weeks later and the weeds just weren't popping yet. Well for years I have seen fishing show guys say to go fish the wind blown points or reefs. So we made a point of trying those spots. Yahtzee, lots of fish. Went to an old honey hole from a couple years ago and it was calm. No fish. Next day the wind shifted and it was blowing onto that same honey hole. Yahtzee, Fish!I can't believe how stubborn I was about fishing the wind blown points. Granted it can be less relaxing but not catching can be kinda boring."
2626937,10lbeye,2014-04-01 19:36:00,61,"My a-ha moment was ignoring the conventional wisdom that Georgian Bay walleye could only be caught at night trolling big stickbaits. For years our group clung to that mindset. As a walleye addict, that didn't sit well with me. I was determined to either confirm or refute that theory, and spent a lot of time searching for daytime eyes by drifting with harnesses and jigs. Eventually it paid off big time and we eventually converted and committed to new tactics. We eventually gave up on late night fishing altogether. That, and understanding and appreciating both the relationship between wind and weedlines. Amazing how I could improve my odds once I paid more attention to these variables. But cracking the code (most of the time anyway) is what makes it fun. And the scenery is still fantastic even when they're not biting...."
2627393,jaximus,2014-04-02 00:28:00,117,"WIND! i grew up on a lake and could fish walleyes any time any day i wanted. i used a simple row boat and slip bobbers in northern wisconsin. if it was windy, i would stay at home on the dock. calm days i would head out in the boat. i always caught fish. in canada on your trip the days are numbered. you gotta fish in the wind. the wind blown points are dynamite! we do our canada trip in canoes, so boat control is tough, but well worth it when you are non stop catching fish."
2627601,LLewellin,2014-04-02 06:03:00,1790,"My ""Ah Ha"" moment years ago was to fish the wind. I grew up fishing with my GrandFather in his 14' Alumacraft with an 18hp Evenrude motor so wind was not our friend. I started fishing the wind often in the mid to late 80's when I had a bigger boat and was fishing Lake Sakakawea in ND. In MN I fish the wind heavily from the opener to mid June. My most recent ""Ah Ha"" moment was a few years back I started pulling spinners across the top of weed beds during July & August. Great time not knowing what I will catch but I will catch fish of some kind. Last year caught walleyes, pike, crappies, bluegills & perch all in the same weed beds."
2627713,v-bay gord,2014-04-02 06:37:00,3168,"BornToFish...trolling for late summer walleyes is probably my least effective method and it's one that I need to work on. I tend to revert back to the bottom bouncer / crawler harness presentation when the fish are deeper and scattered. This is still technically a trolling presentation and well worth trying as well. That said it is possible to troll cranks in the same areas with success. Spring / early summer is more my comfort zone when fish can be found in the 5 to 20 range......edges of mudflats, drop-offs and weed edges are key trolling areas. September can have fish moving back into these shallower areas and trolling these same June / July locations can pay off. I have some background info on trolling cranks and bottom bouncing at this site... http://www.vermilionbaylodge.com/wal...hing-tips.html"
2627793,croixdog,2014-04-02 07:19:00,58,"My Aah-haa moment happened when I made a commitment to a specific technique. I grew up trolling with a long line, rod in hand, and an original rapala or maybe a shad rap if deep enough. I realized walleyes bite on much more than that. I read all the info I could on walleye fishing. I went out a bought a couple of lindy rigs and thats all I used one summer. The next year I learned to pitch cranks to wind swept structure. The next year I committed to jigs and just fished those with both live bait and plastics. Then I started to refine the plastics for size, color, shape, etc. and even the live bait for times of the year and size as well. I have only dabbled in slip bobbering but I think I would enjoy it if I committed to it. the point is now when I go, I have all of those techniques in mind and all that equipment in my boat. So I pick and choose what I think would work first based on conditions and time of the year, and if it doesn't work I am not afraid to switch. But if I hadn't committed to any one technique for a whole season, I would not have learned them well. My next ahh - haa moment was fishing a PWT as an AM. and realizing the pros do not have better equipment and they are not any better detecting a stike, or setting a hook, or landing a fish -- the ROCK at boat control and reading their sonar and that is what sets them apart."

2624585,BornToFish,2014-04-01 10:53:00,1224,"I first fished in NW Ontario is late summer 2001. Quite honestly, I didn't do very well that year as I struggled to catch fish. It was a humbling experience as I routinely fished well back home. I committed myself to improving as an angler on the lake(s) that I fish in Ontario. I now consider myself to be a much improved fisherman. I mentor many anglers that fish from the same lodge that I fish from. As I look back over my journey, I believe my single biggest insight was to accept that the lakes that I fish in the Canadian Shield are markedly different than most lakes in my home state. Once I understood these differences, I was able to learn what to do about the differences. I was then able to fine-tune my equipment and tailor my presentations to the fish that I targeted. In other words, I was able to develop effective strategies and techniques to catch more and better fish.

I added a split shot to it and got the distance, but got hung up in some of the shallower spots. Put a 2 3/4"" rapala on W/the split shot and ""Ah-Hah"", got the casting distance and hardly ever got hung up. I found this to be extremely effective, and have caught many trout out of that river since I stumbled onto that.All I did was inadvertently turn the floating lure into a suspending lure with the added casting distance that I was looking for. OH; BTW when I first tried this, about 40+ yrs. ago, they didn't have the arsenal of lures that they have available today!"
