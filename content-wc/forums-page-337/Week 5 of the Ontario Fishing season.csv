2602529,deadhead1,2014-03-27 13:49:00,193,"Walleye opener is third saturday in may but remember that you can still go for pike, crappie, perch and bass all year long if you want to. Muskie opens 3rd saturday in june"
2605498,tuiflies,2014-03-28 08:33:00,158,"I've never heard of camps booking by the ""week of the season"" or ""weeks since opening"". It seems funny for muskie fishermen to book based on the walleye season. Can you book for the first week of muskie season from now on irregardless of what week number it is or do they want you to pick a week number. What about guys in Sept? Do they book for the 16th or 17th week or just the first week after labour day?"
2610058,jimmie,2014-03-29 07:49:00,123,You should check with Cedar Lake Lodge again beacause it would appear that according to the 2014 calendar the week 5 start date is June 14th and give you one day to musky fish before you leave for home. This is assuming that you have an overnight stay planned on your way home Sat eve and Sunday. Good luck!
2619034,cuamb,2014-03-31 10:18:00,203,Many camps are filled the first 5 or 6 weeks of the season with repeat customers. Our week is always the 4th week. Weeks 1 through 3 are already booked by repeat customers so there is no way to book any other way that is fair.If we want an earlier or later week we need to get on a waiting list.
2622537,Terwalleye,2014-03-31 20:34:00,166,oooh. Good call and good catch. You are spot on.
2430234,Terwalleye,2014-02-07 20:50:00,166,"OK gang I need to get a pulse from y'all on how dumb I should feel.For the past few years we have gone to Cedar Lake on the third Saturday in June. This happens to be the Musky Opener and it's a good msuky lake. So now me and the gang like trying for 'em.Anyhow, I always thought our trip was the 3rd Sat. in June. As it works out for the past 3 years the 5th week of fishing has been the third week in June. Our camp operator has had us down for ""week 5"".Well, this year week 5 is the 2nd Sat. in June. No musky this year So I am wondering if anyone else learned this the hard way or should have it been obvious all along?"
2430354,MN_Moose,2014-02-07 22:40:00,964,Yes we did one year at a resort on the Winnipeg river. We never planned our date by the weeks from opener. we always asked for second week in June.
2580873,Terwalleye,2014-03-22 00:10:00,166,"Ok since he chatter seems to have increased, I thought I would ask again."
2581489,Smallmouth Hunter,2014-03-22 08:22:00,84,Yes it did. We didn't really plan it as 5 weeks from opener but we always went 3rd week of June and the way the dates fell or something got messed up. They had us down for a week earlier than we had planned on. We found this out in like Feb. Guys had vacation they couldn't chance. One guys a school teacher and it makes it iffy with snow days and such. They couldn't change our week. We cancelled and went to another lodge that had an opening. Best thing that ever happened to us. We had been going to the first camp for 27 years.
2586961,Glenman12,2014-03-23 20:02:00,762,while we are pretty much locked in to Cedar Lake Lodge if the week is going to change we let them know..Im too anal not to..
2591017,Terwalleye,2014-03-24 19:17:00,166,"I am with you Glenman. We are far to happy with Cedar Lake to go try another one in hopes of better fishing. Not that there cant be better; I just think there are has to more that aren't as good.The good news is that after this year we will have four years in a row of being there for Musky opener. And 5 years from now we can ask about other openings. lol, If I can remember that far out."
2595241,walleyeduran,2014-03-25 18:56:00,286,WI fishing opener is always the first saturday in May. MN and Ontario's openers are based on the saturday closest to a certain date in the month and about every 5-7 years it is moved up a week. Answer your ?
2596689,Fishoil,2014-03-26 07:55:00,1277,Ontario's opener is always the third Saturday in May.
2599617,Terwalleye,2014-03-26 20:41:00,166,"Right right. The issue we had is for the past three years ""Musky opener"" happened to be 3rd Sat in Jun and Week 5. We are Week 5 from the Opener for the fishing season. And this year that is 1 week before the musky opener; or the 2nd Sat in June. I was just asking if anyone else ran into that same issue."
2600537,revitup,2014-03-27 07:42:00,140,Terwalleye If my counting is correct week 5 puts you out of the musky opener in 2015 as well. fishing opener is May 16. That makes week 5 beginning on June 13 and ending on June 20--the Musky opener. If Musky is important in 2015 you may want to move back to week 6 in 2015.
