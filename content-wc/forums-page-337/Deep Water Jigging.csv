2644457,Yarhcaz,2014-04-06 10:26:00,1389,"I have caught tons of fish using jigs in 50 to 60 FOW. The only thing that I can say is super lines work much better than mono for deep water jigging. It is just as easy, maybe even easier to fish a fish on the graph in the deeper water. I can see my half or 5/8 jig plain as day on my graph in that depth."
2645177,prov1800,2014-04-06 15:34:00,5010,"Use your electronics to find fish.then fish them.good luck on the 30"" fish, just not that many left the 3-4 years."
2646378,tuiflies,2014-04-06 22:52:00,158,Do you find many come up with their swim bladders in their mouths? I've always avoided fishing walleye 35' down or deeper because of the swim bladder issue (which I've seen as shallow as 26' deep).
2646410,Yarhcaz,2014-04-06 23:00:00,1389,"That is the tough part... The best that I can do is if it feels like it is a smaller fish I or a fish big enough that I would let it go is reel as slow as possible. Let the fish come up very very slowly. I usually only fish this deep right above one of dams in December. Yes the bladder will pop out if you reel quickly...the good news is that most of the fish that we catch there at that time of the year fall within our slot limit so we keep them them all. I sometimes also fish that deep on Oahe in August but that is plain rigs or spinners, I only go that deep if I am not able to do well in shallower depths. It most certainly is not a good depth for catch and release."
2632417,muskyroller,2014-04-03 09:02:00,56,"The ""Ah Ha"" moments thread got me thinking about this, because it actually hasn't happened to me yet, but I know when it does...it'll be that ""ah ha"" moment.Our trips to Lac Seul are spent jigging 95% of the time from about 4ft out to 15ft. Anything past that 15ft range and all of us lose our confidence. I think the confidence thing happens because with a jig and live bait you have to fish it generally slow and deep water fishing in my eyes needs to be the opposite of that. I want to cover water, quickly and rule out specific humps to find ""thee"" hump. After watching Lindner's Edge, I loved the idea of ice fishing tactics in open water to find active, BIG walleyes. We do well in the 4-15ft. range catching numbers and 24-28 inchers...were looking for the 30""+ type fish with some big northerns mixed in.How do you attack these deeper water structures and do it quickly? I should also say, I have two jigging rods and that's it for walleyes (I'm a musky guy ) So, my gear is slightly limited. Thanks for the help,Steve"
2632641,Carnhzkr,2014-04-03 09:52:00,964,"The best way to cover deeper water, IMO, is to pull bottom bouncers. A spinner or floating jig tipped with a crawler, minnow, or leech at about 1 - 1.5 mph can't be beat, but you could also pull a shallow running crank if you want to cover water even faster. The walleye tend to run pretty deep on LS during the summer, say, 25 - 30 feet, or even deeper. I also believe that a spinner with a big, fat crawler makes for a much more attractive presentation for the big walleye, over a 1/4 oz. jig/minnow."
2632761,adempsey,2014-04-03 10:12:00,963,"I would troll spinners with meat using bottom bouncers or pencil weights, troll deep diving cranks or drift slip-weight rigs (Lindy rigs) with a floating jig head. Personally, I think targeting big Walleye is more about where/when you fish and not what you use."
2634929,tuiflies,2014-04-03 19:55:00,158,Use your musky gear/tactics down sized a bit. I know a few musky hunters who often hook into huge walleye trolling musky baits around at 4 mph.
2635201,Knoxabilly,2014-04-03 21:09:00,225,I also lose my confidence past 15ft. It's a little tricky trolling in camp boats. Luckily I've had very good luck working these depths. I would like to understand how to fish deep humps and reefs. Any tips?
2635377,btmbncr,2014-04-03 22:28:00,492,"I know of some big walleyes caught on Lac Seul deep jigging.I have had better luck running a bottom bouncer,small spinner and 2 leeches on a #4 Matzuo red sickle hook through the fish."
2635817,REG,2014-04-04 06:44:00,445,"When we fished LS in the fall (long ago), we were finding them in 25-27 ft. of water - but it wasn't out in the middle of the lake. They were still fairly close to shallow structure - but out deeper. We would start shallower around structure such as points and then work out deeper and deeper until we started getting fish. Our electronics weren't picking much up - those fish were hugging the bottom. We used Lindy rigs with minnows so we could get deep but still feel subtle bites. Once we found the key depth, we'd stay at that depth and use the trolling motor to slowly work around the structure. If we got a little too shallow or too deep, we'd be off the bite. This allowed us to cover some ground - but not as fast as trolling. You could do the same thing in a camp boat by backtrolling and watching your depthfinder."
2636361,BornToFish,2014-04-04 08:47:00,1224,"I've found that walleyes are transitioning from shorelines to near-shore rock structure (e.g. humps, reefs, points) by about mid to late June, when the water has warmed up from the springtime. I look for these fish near the top of such structures, often around 12-15 fow. The walleyes have moved to top of off-shore rock structure (e.g. humps) by mid July to early August. As the season progresses, the fish move deeper on these rock humps and are found along the sides of the structure. They move shallower in the evening and deeper in the mornings. I normally find the most active fish near the top of the hump. However, the fish on the sides of the rock hump can be tempted. I've noticed that the band of water depth holding fish during mid-August can be quite tight. For example, I might catch the fish in 26-28 fow. As the water cools in early autumn, that depth band often widens, such that I might catch fish in 26-34 fow. I love to fish walleyes holding on rock structure during July - September. I seriously believe that I have a great opportunity to catch every walleye on that rock hump as soon as I catch one fish, because I know what depth they are all at. Sort of running counter to other posts on this thread, I don't want to cover water, but rather remain essentially motionless to stay on top of fish. I see many anglers struggle with this type of fishing. Many of these folks would likely improve their catching by slowing down. I change depth of water in 1-2 fow increments. Boat control is supremely important to my fishing success. I can fish an entire evening and not move more than one or two boat lengths form where I started back-trolling. I've found that selection of fishing equipment is important to my vertical presentation. I need to be able to feel the bottom at all times, to ensure that my lure is in the strike zone at all times, as well as being able to feel the bite of a finicky walleye. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
2641321,FishFry2012,2014-04-05 12:45:00,27,Have you seen in fisherman fish a swimbait through waters like this casting and bringing it back? Google that and maybe give that a try.
2643953,pjshorthorn,2014-04-06 08:30:00,5654,"Agreed. I have fished quite a bit with slip sinker rigs and a floating jig head over the years. Used to pull a lot of cranks years ago, but got away from that presentation. Hope to get back into it this year. I like to find the transition ( drop off) from 15-30 fow and drift it if the wind is correct or slow troll it with the motor kicked in and out of gear to create the drift. The fall tends to be better for the chance at larger fish.....IMO.PjShorthorn"
