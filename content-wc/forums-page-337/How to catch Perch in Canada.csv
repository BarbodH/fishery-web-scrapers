2641585,packpro,2014-04-05 15:24:00,695,"We target them. Nice for the fish fry when we get home. We ask the camp for the smaller minnows and usually use smaller jig heads. The shallows warm up first and provide both a food source and cover in the form of emerging weeds. We can usually find the predators- walleye and pike just out side of the weed line and we will find the perch in pockets inside of the week line. We are usually in a back bay 4-6 ft. of water.Two years ago fishing side by side with another boat from our group we each had about 30 perch in each boat over a 1-1/2 hour period. Then it just shut off. About ten minutes later the other boat is hootin' and holler'n. All you can hear is laughter, shock, and screaming drag. It appears that a bully as moved into the hole. 15 minutes later they net a 37"" pike, caught on light tackle and a 1/8 oz. pinkie jig"

2642465,Jack77,2014-04-05 18:47:00,168,This is how we do it too. Look for weeds and try to fish the breaks in them

2643345,ftfarms,2014-04-06 02:04:00,444,We've caught a lot of nice Perch that time of year by using a slip bobber and a slab crappie jig tipped with a small leach.
2643617,Paul H,2014-04-06 06:48:00,1232,"We used to target them also. I no longer go, but used to take wax worms just for the ease and ""cheapness"". Not sure if they are allowed cross border now. Small 1/32 florescent orange or chartreuse jig head with some meat was my go to. Either crawler, or wax worm. Minnows would work but were not readily available where I was. I targeted old deeper beaver hutches and timber. One time hit the spawn and 4 guys had 20 lbs filleted in just a few hours. Unreal time. We usually primarily ate perch and just a few walleye. I was lucky as they were not targeted on a couple lakes I fished and were unusually large. We had a 18"" one once on a small mepps from the dock over a weed bed. Also had a few places near shallow old hutches that you could sight fish fo 12""+. Reel fun on a slow day with ultralight."
2644681,JayM5209,2014-04-06 11:44:00,1050,"Fishfry, excellent tips from all the previous posters! My group's annual trips for 35+ years are to lakes just a bit north of where you'll be. We eat 'eyes for dinner every day, but our take home fish, in addition to one laker per person, are jumbo perch - 30 to 50 per man.Just a few more tips . . . 1) some days the perch like just a little flash to the offering. Take a few 1/16 oz. RoadRunner jigs along - yellow or chartreuse with the chenille body. Or, make sure a few of your other small jigs have a few strands of tinsel in their hair. 2) I never use minnows for perch. A 1/2"" piece of crawler on the jig is all that's needed. And usually it is needed! A jig without a tiny piece of meat will sit for a long time in the middle of the perch school w/out getting hit. 3) You can either fish the jig over the side of the boat, cast it out and slowly work it back to the boat, or, my favorite, hang the jig under a small slip bobber set to the depth the perch are holding in or along the weed beds.Good luck. Perching can be a fun way to spend an afternoon and they're good eating. We don't keep anything under 10"". You can get grand fillets from NWO perch! When you get home let us know how you did."
