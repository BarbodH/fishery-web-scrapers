My question is, has anyone actually bumped their trip farther back? We are scheduled for the week of June 7 on Lac Seul at Evergreen Lodge. Not so concerned with the ice, more so worried that we will hit a late spawning week with slow fishing. This is our first time on the lake so we will be getting a guide. I am hopeful that even during a slow time, he can still put us on some fish, but starting to wonder if we should just go later rather than trying to hit a hot post - spawn bite. Any thoughts?"
2633481,wallydave,2014-04-03 13:22:00,2151,"Lac Seul has some flow to it with the dam near Ear Falls, so the ice will come off faster than lakes without moving water. Check the spawn threads, from my following those, the water temps and longer daylight are part of the process. That part of LS can be a great early season spot, it can get crowded, maybe the guide will put you on fish not a traffic jam of boats!"

The walleye were still pre-spawn and we caught more large fish that year than ever before (everyone in our group caught 26 - 30"" fish). The fish weren't spread out like we were used to which made the fishing less exciting, but the bite was really on. The only fish we caught shallow were males that squirted on us every time we would take them off the hooks and the big females were just beginning to move up towards shallow from the deep water. Spinner rigs with leeches were the ticket that year, anchoring up in about 8' of water and casting down current with a slow retrieve up the incline."
2638977,Swamp_Donkey_Slayer,2014-04-04 19:29:00,42,Our group has been discussing it...we have May 22nd fly in to Donald lake in woodland caribou park. There is no one coming in the week after us so we were thinking switching weeks. One of the guys called up to chimo in redlake. They are not concerned at all...we just need to see the warmer temps that are starting to hit there. So instead of moving dates back...we are likely adding days to the trip. Hope we are right...if not hope we have plenty of beer.
