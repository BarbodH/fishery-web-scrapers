1075864,Dan G,2009-01-25 07:06:00,31,Dear Red:Agreed....if posted in USD...one should pay in USD. Vice-versa if posted in CAN Dollars. I also agree it would be frustrating if a resort owner would keep posting different mediums of exchange every year.
1074843,dutchboy,2009-01-20 10:34:00,5717,"I understand the doom and gloom of the American economy. Something we must take into consideration is the lodge / resort owners have to pay their bills also. It doesn't matter what our situations are. They must first calculate what they must take in, then they must calculate what the guests will be able & willing to pay. There is a happy middle of the road where they can make money and we can afford their lodge! Remember, it does nobody any good if the lodge goes broke."
1074848,Obabikon,2009-01-20 11:03:00,2370,"Dutch, that's a good point. Right now, a lot of lodges are walking a fine line. They know how much money they have to make to pay the bills. However, they expect fewer people to come this year (due to the bad economy). It's hard to hold prices the same, and take in fewer guests. Add to that, almost everyone's bills will go up or stay at least remain the same... some places are struggling with what to do. All that said, if anyone can afford to go, I encourage you to make the trip. Everyone at this point has to look out for themselves. Hopefully, lower gas prices will offset the drop in tourism, and then the camps can keep prices the same. That, of course, has to be determined on a camp by camp basis."
1074993,cowboyd,2009-01-20 23:26:00,33,"DutchA very interesting scenario and let me start by saying as a fisherman I hope all the camps make it so as many fishermen as possible have a place to go. With that said tough times like this can have a positive effect along with the negative ones. It is never pleasant to see a camp fold but my experience is that those that do go are usually the ones just barely making it, the ones who don't keep up their facilities for whatever reason, the ones that lose site of how important it is to take care of their customers and think just because they have a facility on a pretty Canadian lake they have a ""right"" to succeed.In the end those failures give more business to the good camps who do care and keep their facilites up as well as giving new owners and operators the chance to buy the failed locations and make them into first class sites with new infusions of capital.I have learned on threads like these it is important to clarify that I am not talking about anyone here nor am I not sympathetic to the plight of the failed businesses, just pointing out some good can come from a bad situation too."
1075025,Jimmy Jig,2009-01-21 08:36:00,1905,"The camp I am going to just sent their rates. No changes, thats also in Canadian money. So, if exchange rate stays where it is at now it will cost me less for the camp. If gas stays less than last year I will save more money. Camps that collect in US money will gain an increase without raising rates."
1075041,Larry Mac,2009-01-21 09:40:00,530,"The camp we are going to in June held their 2008 pricing, The Camp we are going to in August has an increase of $59.00 per week on their Father and Son Package. Both Camps are in US Funds.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1075108,Obabikon,2009-01-21 15:28:00,2370,"That's true, just like last year, camps that charged in US funds lost money on the exchange rate. (even with par, the camps set their prices expecting better). The difference in my eyes, is for the customer. You have almost no idea how much the trip will cost you. The US dollar could swing 25% either way in 4-5 months time. That's a big swing... I'm not saying it's wrong to charge in Canadian. I'm saying that people thinking the camps are getting rich off of the exchange rate aren't correct."
1075673,Dan G,2009-01-24 05:53:00,31,"You do have to remember that these resorts are in Canada. To be posting and charging their rates in the medium of currency that they use is appropriate. To post in American Dollars is a convenience to the American client. We Americans oft times think only in American Dollars and should respect and understand the currencies of the countries we travel to. Rest assured....I know many good camp owners....they are not gettng rich on the exchange rate. In fact....the tourism industry is off in Northwestern Ontario substantially. My roots in travelling to Canada run deep..my father took me as a young boy. I think it is beautiful and unsurpassed in fishing quality. I say, ""Head North young man!"""
1075688,clemento,2009-01-24 06:49:00,48,"My outfitter charged in American money in 2007, Canadian money in 2008 and now is going back to American money in 2009 and price is going up also. I know they have to be profitable to stay in business but I am not real comfortable with the changing currencies every year. Would this bother you?"
1075690,Obabikon,2009-01-24 07:00:00,2370,"That would bother me. Clearly doing that to make more of a profit. Giving his customers all the risk, and taking none himself. That would bug me. Camps that charge in Canadian or US are fine... but they should stay with what they do."
1075830,Red Tail Chub,2009-01-24 21:25:00,17,"I have what may be a silly question, but I'm going to ask it anyway. If a canadian resort posts it's rates in usd, then shouldn't it expect to be paid in usd instead of exchanging to cad? I realize these are canadian resorts, but then why post your rates in usd?"
1068905,english bob,2008-12-17 06:07:00,14,"Considering the economic gloom for 2009, together with a favorable(again) USD to CAD exchange rate and the big drop in fuel costs, will Outfitters increase, decrease or hold prices for 2009? Looks like some have already increased their rates - a good idea?"
1068907,onetimedave,2008-12-17 06:20:00,502,"Our outfitter Arctic Watershed Outposts raised their prices $25.00 to $50.00 depending on which lake you go to. This surprised me, I thought it would be more. With the difference in US to Canadian dollars our '09 trip will cost less than 2008."
1068909,Obabikon,2008-12-17 06:26:00,2370,"We're holding our prices the same, and I've done some research almost all my competitors in the Morson, Lake of the Woods area are also holding their prices."
1068916,english bob,2008-12-17 07:10:00,14,"onetimedave - Arctic Watershed rates are in CAD so yes, you get the benefit of the favorable exchange rate but the majority of outfitters seem to give rates in USD, so they are getting the benefit!"
1068975,JDP,2008-12-17 11:32:00,1457,I know of 3 resorts on Lac Seul that have taken different paths on 2009 rates: Resort #1 2009 is no change from 2008. (2008 was also no increase versus 2007) Resort #2 2009 is an average of 5% increase across the various packages offered. (2008 was a 10% increase versus 2007) Resort #3 2009 is an average of 7% increase across the various packages offered. (I do not have the resort's 2007 rates) The consumer/fisherman/vacationer will decide if raising rates is acceptable. Each resort has unique financial circumstances. Hopefully all will succeed. JDP
1069179,Catman59,2008-12-18 14:24:00,345,It looks like ours stayed the same ........... same price for the last 5 years !
1069372,1shooter,2008-12-19 21:41:00,1493,Godd to hear that. We will probably see you in the fall again.
1071279,IAranger,2009-01-02 20:05:00,352,Raising prices will be a very bad idea as these economic times are probably going to be twice as bad as what most are thinking. It will be hard enough to remain employed let alone get a canadian fishing trip.
1071316,Golden Eagle,2009-01-03 08:37:00,2642,"The outfitter I use the most has probably been under priced for years, but is bumping from $895 to $945 in 2009 for a 7 day fly in with huge pike and tons of small to medium walleyes. He's offering a break for a second consecutive week and I'll be jumping on that by staying 15 days in May, then at least two weeks in August, followed by a good stay in October. We're getting extra weeks in July and August at half price. Told our outfitter that we would schedule flights so an extra plane wouldn't be required. That means maybe going & coming a day or two early or a day or two late. Also told him we'd use only three tanks of fuel per boat for a week of fishing. Shouldn't be a problem using 15 HP, 4 cycle Honda OB. Shore lunches will conserve fuel. If we need more gas we'll pay extra. 2009 is going to be a great year."
1074809,Guest,2009-01-20 08:48:00,0,"www.anglerskingdom.com went to 1025 for the week all your gas great equipment - 18 ft lundoutfitters, 50 hp hondas, sonar, gps, radio etc. very nice cabins. outstanding walleye fishing."
