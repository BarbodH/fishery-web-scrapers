The fishing on Pelican down by Pelican Rapids can be real good and below and above Frog Rapids. The Chutes below Minnitaki and fishing in Minnitaki should not be ignored. They can be excellent. Fishing Lac Suel is an experience in itself. I have fished Loon Rapids, through the Z into Sen Bay and 100 fish days are the rule not the exception. Keep it simple jig/minnow leeches or crawlers"

BUT, I would advise you to follow someone through the Rapids that knows the route well. It pretty easy to lose a lower unit there. If the water is low they run a trailer around the rapids with your boat on it for a fee. I stay at Frog Rapids and trailer the boat to the ramp on Deseption. Sometimes L.S. is much better and sometimes Abrams and Minnitaki is better. Thats mid June, early July fishing......"
