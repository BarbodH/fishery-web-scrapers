1074680,Guest,2009-01-19 16:23:00,0,"Mr. O, That was a quick reply! You don't know this girl. I love here to pieces BUT, I'd need a 747 with floats on it to get everything to camp. Clothes for cold, mild, warm and of course hot weather. Library of books and knitting supplies. Wine of different assortments not to mention her gin and tonics and here various teas and pops and water. Then there is her workout clothes (not fishing clothes:-)) tapes and discs to listen two and with that goes the player to listen to them and that is only the half of it. We are at the point of taking a uhaul trailer along with us to get everything up there. So far I still have room for my fishing gear but not sure for how much longer. Almost seems like we spend the first day and last day unpacking and packing the pick=up. Still would hate to leave her home she does make the trip much, much, much more enjoyable and I like to tease her about it. Can't wait to get back up there:-)!!!!!!!!"
1074693,Mich_Fisherman,2009-01-19 17:20:00,292,15 lbs hmmmm..... I wish... there is part of my problem....will need to trade the 2 ball bowling bag Gander Mountain mega bag for a MUCH smaller tackle box. Thanks for all the replies and suggestions. It will be a challenge for sure.
1074715,Andre (wallyandre),2009-01-19 19:02:00,2274,Habitually when there is a scale they don't weight the stock but the people also goes on the scale. We got tired of those restrictions so we use to get a Cessna 206 for the extra.
1074741,elmo,2009-01-19 21:04:00,43,"Yes do not buy beer in glass bottles, not only will it weigh more but the outfitters I have flown with will not have glass bottles at their camps. I also found a sheet and blanket weight less than a big heavy sleeping bag. I also have a blow up pillow that is light and easy to pack. We also once told the camp owner we were going to buy some xtra beer from him but wanted to wait and see what our weight totaled up to. He told us to go ahead and get what beer we wanted it would not put us over. So we had 2 more cases on top of our other items and he did not count it as weight to us."
1074748,SSA,2009-01-19 21:37:00,19,"I am new to this site recently but have much knowledge in this area to provide. Many of the ideas mentioned ahead of my post are great ideas. I appologize if I mentioned items already mentioned by others. I actually am a pilot for one of the fly ins in NW Ontario. There are many items a person can overpack with or find easy ways to help keep the weight down and these are some I suggest to the guys I fly in. Hope this helps out.1) Food. I suggest having a group meeting and appointing 1 person to do the grocery shopping and stick to a menu agreed by everyone. If the whole group goes in to shop it seems someone will see an item and say hey lets get this, and so on and so on. Adds up fast. Purchase plastic items such for jelly. Glass weighs more than plastic bottles. Freeze every possible item that can be frozen. While at camp it serves as ice for your coolers. Ive also seen the ""monster"" size bottles of ketchup or whatever, if you need it great. But if not needed, buy the smaller size.2) Clothes. Weather can change as many of you can verify. Checking forcasts acouple days before you leave home and pack accordingly. Bring some extra for the just in case weather but Ive loaded winter parkas in the plane for guys when its during a heat wave in July. Weather forcasts dont vary that drastically. Another idea, if you have ""travel"" clothes. Change before the flight and leave your travel clothes at the airbase in your car. Change back into them when you get back out from your trip. If everyone does this, thats a few pounds alone. 3) Fishing gear. Oh yes, monster tackle boxes are common. Bring what you need. Ive seen muskie lures on a trip for groups whos going to a lake with walleye and northern. Sort the tackle and bring what you need. Bait if you wish to use bait, our organization does not weigh the bait towards the weight. But if the place you go does. Live minnows in water add up weight fast. Frozen/salted minnows work very well and weigh alot less. The gulp baits some like and others dont, if you do, weighs not much. Leeches and crawlers are light considering amount of bait for the weight. Depth finders, the batterys add up lots of weight. Some outfits provide portible generators, charge the batterys while at camp or use a solar inverter to charge off the solar batterys at camp if they have that kind of system. This concept goes for cameras and any other devise using batterys. Lastly, fishing rods. The rod case you choose can weigh alot too or not much. Some sewer pipes weigh alot, there are much lighter rod tubes that work just as well. Also try to condense your rods in as less amount of tubes as possible for the entire group. 4) Beverages. Alot of fly ins dont even allow bottled beer for the weight and breakage while at camp. Plus bottles can not be crushed to save room on garbage on the way out of camp. Cans are lighter and your pilot will appriacte cans vers bottles. Water, the purifier or boiling the water saves on taking in any drinking water for your trip. If you find the need to take in drinking water with you, freeze the water and can be used as ice during your trip while it thaws. Most outfits also ""pre order"" and will fly items in ahead of time or during mid week depending on the outfits system they do. If going that route, consider even pre ordering can goods or cooking oil to have flown in ahead of time. Another item is soda. If you can go with out soda, dont take it. Alternate, kool aid mix, crystal light and other items weigh nothing and can be mixed in your boiled water from the lake.5) Check with the group members. Alot of items can be doubled if you do not know who is packing what. I like to use the example of a first aid kit. No reason to have 6 first aid kits in a group of 8, just have 1 person bring an item like this. 6) Inquire to your outfit what size of coolers they prefer and size of bags, depending on the aircraft being used they may have a preferance in sizes to make the most of the plane. Such as I personally would rather see 2, 48 quart coolers than 1 96 quart cooler for the purpose of handling and loading into the planes. Same as for bags, I rather see 2 avg sized bags than 1 body bag. Even if the aircraft has no issue with some of the pilots may be an older gentleman and wants to keep a healthy back. Best to inquire to see how they prefer the actual packing of your gear.Group meetings going over these details makes for the best results and also gives everyone a reason to get together to get excited about your fly in.Remember, tipping the pilot helps him to remember where he left you. Just kidding, hope you enjoy your trip."
1074791,onetimedave,2009-01-20 07:42:00,502,"We fly out of Nakina with a weight limit of 110# per person. (Nakina Air Service) Don't have any trouble meeting this. We alot each person 50/55# and the rest is for food, beer, paper products, etc. Pack all in paper boxes as much as possible and all cold in styrofoam chests. Limit your tackle box to under 15#. If you take heavy boots, wear them in on the flight, carry cameras etc. and this also helps with your limit. Look for groceries in paper boxes and not cans. Ask your outfitter if he will bring in additional liquids on the check flight. Good luck."
1074815,Obabikon,2009-01-20 09:06:00,2370,"Haha... sounds like my wife. We went on a three day cruise this fall. I had one small suitcase. She had three enormous bags... plus a plastic shopping bag full of blowdryer, curler, hair products. I know what you mean though... trips wouldnt' be the same without them!"
1074604,Mich_Fisherman,2009-01-19 11:43:00,292,"Ok Guys.....looking for your tips and ideas. Our group is flying in after years of drive ins. We pack wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much stuff on the drive in trips and need to trim considerably. The outfitter is limiting us to 100lbs/person including food. Since he doesnt run the flight service, he has told us that if we are over..... and unless there is another plane coming in, that the costs are consderable and he has no control over that. What things do you guys do to minimize the weight. We are estimating about 70# per person for gear and 30# per person will be for food. We plan on eating fish every night except the last, and will have one provision meal should we not get out on the lake for whatever reason. Dried foods are an option....but would rather not. Looking for your tips and ideas here to assist us. Perhaps typical breakfast and lunch. Thanks ..................."
1074621,Obabikon,2009-01-19 13:07:00,2370,"An obvious one is tackle... fishermen have a habbit of bringing WAY too much. You need one small tackle box with the lures you know you're going to use. Don't bring anything you didn't use last year... Another easy way to cut back, is the type of suitcase you pack... nothing's lighter than a glad trash bag. That'll save you several pounds right there."
1074647,elmo,2009-01-19 15:01:00,43,"If everyones brings tons of the same lures/tackle that will add up. If everyone brings a little of something diff. that should help. The amount of clothes you bring I usally take a xtra change and do hand wash while at the outpost. We also take a lot of dried items to cook noodles of several kinds dried beans, we have also used those dried hash browns you add water to. We usally eat fish every day so we don't take in pork chops, Tbones Fish tacos are good also. Beer or soda pop is about 20 pounds a case. Maybe someone else can help here."
1074661,Andre (wallyandre),2009-01-19 15:39:00,2274,Good advises on tackle and for soda & beer bring only cans (aluminium weight less then glass)
1074663,Larry Mac,2009-01-19 15:46:00,530,"Hi Mich_Fisherman, Below you will find a website with detailed video information that should help you prepare for your fly-in fishing adventure. The Preparing video should help answer some of your weight questions. Hope you find it useful and have a great time.www.wildernessnorth.comThank you,Larry Mac"
1074666,Guest,2009-01-19 15:48:00,0,I take my wife with me and she packs at least a hundred pounds in just clothes. I guess I'll never ever have to consider a fly in trip as long as she is along!!!
1074667,Obabikon,2009-01-19 15:51:00,2370,"Bingo, Not all fly ins have the same weight restrictions. Some also offer multiple trips or to allow you to pre order food/drinks."
1074675,joeman79,2009-01-19 16:16:00,417,"Take 3 dozen assorted jigs, a hand full of walking sinkers, 2 cards of little joe spinners, a ziploc with a bunch of twister tails. 3 big spinnerbaits, a couple big inline spinners half a dozen spoons a few leaders, 6 crankbaits for pike and walleye, a topwater bait or 2 and litte terminal tackle,and a flat of worms. 2 pair jeans 1 pair shorts, a few shirts, A warm Jacket and sweatshirt, lite wieght rain gear, shoes and a pair of tingly boots, 3 pairs underwear and socks. I always take so much crap and never use hardly any of it. The guy we fly in with allows 150# and I was way over wieght. But they did not charge any extra that Turbo Otter could have carried a bunch more. You don't need that much stuff. Next time I will take Less Crap and More BEER!!!! Watch that video at wilderness north is very good."
1074677,Pooch,2009-01-19 16:21:00,4619,"Beer, pop and big tackle boxes are killers on weight restrictions of 100 pounds. Go weigh your tackle box right now and I'd guess it's over fifteen pounds. Most guys in our group are pushing twenty pounds and still fish mainly with a handful of jigs, several crank baits and some spinner rigs. A dozen 1.5 ounce bottom bouncers is only a pound. A guy with only a ziplock full of jigs will probably out fish the guys with a life savings in tackle! We pre-cook and freeze some of our meals. Also we freeze everything that can be frozen like cheese, lunch meat, butter, etc. then at the fly-out drain off all water or ice and use the frozen food to keep the cooler cold until we get to camp. Carrying in a couple gallons of ice and water in your cooler(s) is about fifteen pounds in itself. One four inch rod tube holds a really big bunch of rods if you load them end for end. That also protects them all since no rod tips are supporting the entire weight of the rods. Soft duffel bags are also the best way to go. Hard suitcases or the huge ""body bags"" that some guys like are also space eaters on a float plain. Pack your depth finder in the middle of your clothes for protection. You will probably wear a pair of jeans and a sweat shirt on the flight in. That change only surely will last a week. Most guys can get a week or even two out of a pair of jeans unless you tear them or worse. Nobody cares if you have droopy drawers all week. It's a fishing camp! If you are concerned about the drinking water not being safe, take along a ""PUR"" water filter for the sink faucet. It is slow, but let it run into a clean container while you are playing cards then stockpile these for consumption. There are many ways to reduce weight. Just give it a little thought and don't let guys duplicate communal items. Make a food/supply list and stick with it. The food and bait will weigh more than you think. Pooch"
1074679,Obabikon,2009-01-19 16:23:00,2370,"Just kind of thinking.... but, couldn't you wear two sets of jeans, and have stuff like sinkers packed into your pockets? lol... I know it sounds cheap, but every pound helps."
