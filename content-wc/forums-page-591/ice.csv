1074272,Bigfishhunter,2009-01-17 08:57:00,803,"Well that depends on where you are looking? It also depends on the amount of snow. The more snow, the more insulation and therefore ice is made less quickly. In addition the ice can also be of very poor quality depending on which came first the deep freeze or the snow. Clear or Black ice is the strongest. White ice has almost half of the load capacity. Slush can mean weak ice. Where I live we have had -30 and below ('c) quite consistently for almost two months now. Today is the first warm spell. -10'c. It is unbelievable, I am going to go fishing and will only have to wear my hoodie and gloves can stay in the truck!! We have just under three feet or thereabout. Some years we have more than this. How is Nevada treating you these days?"
1074300,alanexpup,2009-01-17 13:19:00,278,"Hi. WOW, those temps are off the chart. we moved from chicago 3 years ago and keep an eye on what the weather there and see it was -8 a couple days ago. Out here its pretty nice, now the temps are around 65 and sunny for a high. we did have 9 inches of snow just before christmas and it lasted a whole week before it was gone. When we lived in chicago we used to go to fish lac saul or lake of the woods for the last 30 years and really miss that trip. on lake mead out here the common fish that is caught is striper bass. they are good but not as good as walleye or northern. as for las vegas the industry out here is tourism. last year they say 40 million came out here but this year things have slowed down. the casinos are finally paying attention to the locals, now we get a lot of offers for discount show tickets and 2 for 1 meal deals. eating out has gotten so good it is hard not to gain weight. have you ever been out here? ok stay warm. alan"
