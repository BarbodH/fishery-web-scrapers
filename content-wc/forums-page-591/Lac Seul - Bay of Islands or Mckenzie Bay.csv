1074372,tjsker,2009-01-18 04:20:00,301,I'll be staying at Fishermans Cove the first week of July. My brother and his son will be taking a guide out for the first day and I'm considering renting a boat for that day and going out on my own. Would it be worth it to go all the way to Mckenzie or head south to the Bay of Islands?

Our experience has been that regardless of wind, weather, water level, etc. there are always areas in McKenzie that produce well. We are not real familiar with Bay of Islands, but knowing Lac Seul, would assume the same would apply there. Good luck! WP Sioux Falls"

That would be the thing you need to figure out before you take off in a rental, assuming the rental is the typical 25 to 40 hp motor."

I have been staying at Fisherman's cove for 5 years now and always get a guide the first day there and they always show us new spots to fish and where the fish are biting and we always have boats that follow the guide boat. You have to cross Bay of Islands to get to MacKenzie Bay. Weather and Wind is always a factor on where you decide to fish. The rental boats are nice, but if it is a windy day....beware and don't travel too far out into MacKenzie because it will be a very rough ride back. Remember too, there is nice fishing close to the resort right in Scout Bay if the wind is too rough. My son caught 2 28"" walleyes and friend caught 27 1/2 "" walleyes right in Scout bay, so you don't have to travel far at all for great fishing! Fisherman's cove is a GREAT resort with nice cabins, boats, motors, Wed.night BBQ and Dan and Keith are great hosts! You WILL have a GREAT TIME! I'm going back the last week of July and counting the days to the trip. Have you been there before? If not shoot me a message and I can give you more tips!"

It was my 11th time at this camp, and for the first time, I spent 2 days looking for fish. They were not in the normal patterns due to, rising water levels, colder than normal water temps, weed beds not as high as normal, and an emerging Mayfly hatch, everything was a good 2 weeks behind. When I finally started to think about things, evaluating what we were finding, and considered where I would fish if Iwere there in a normal year 2 weeks earlier......I finally found fish. The next day we had 4 guided boats from camps find us and our spot. Moral of the story is; they know the lake, they know what is happening NOW! and they will put you on the correct pattern and location. LS is a terrific fishery, but just because it is the middle of the summer doesn't mean the fish know it! The circumstances to catching fish change every year, some years are better than others, some spots are better depending on conditions. Personally I don't fish McK very often, I don't want the company. I prefer finding my own spot, and there are plenty."
