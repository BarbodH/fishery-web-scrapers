1073217,tjsker,2009-01-12 09:02:00,301,Is this GPS unit detailed enough for Lac Seul?
1073279,Jimmy Jig,2009-01-12 14:35:00,1905,"NO, mine sure wasn't. I bought a Canadian Freedom Map from Lowrance that is. The chip has the same map as the paper ones. It shows everything, but no depths, no rocks, etc. There are better chips now that show more details....."
1073358,2746,2009-01-12 20:21:00,3206,"It sure is! Used mine with a navionics on Lac Suel the last two years and could not be happier. The map is accurate and, while a bigger screen GPS would be nice, the H2O gets us around great and it's clear enough to be able to see easily. An excellent unit for the $."
1073443,Jimmy Jig,2009-01-13 09:54:00,1905,"The question was: Is the map that is in the H2O any good, the answer is NO. After loading an expensive chip the answer is YES."
1073604,2746,2009-01-13 21:43:00,3206,"Gosh Jimmy, didn't mean to make you shout. Actually the question was: ""Is this GPS unit detailed enough for Lac Seul?"" Guess I just interperted it differently than you. The great thing is tjsker can use the answeres in any way he wants."

1073757,2746,2009-01-14 15:57:00,3206,"bought mine, along with a 2007 canada chip, on e-bay for about $200. Pretty cool to be able to see the lake on the screen and watch yourself move along between the islands etc. That's a big lake and I'd have been lost (literally) without it."
1074634,Steve of Madison,2009-01-19 14:26:00,230,"Took the H2O to LS last year, (borrowed it from a friend) and found it to be very helpful. I think it had the Navionics chip in it, but couldn't say for sure. I know my spots very well, and it didn't miss any of them. In fact i found a couple new humps, that i didn't know about. There were no depth markings but remember, LS is a body of water that fluctuates in water levels....sometimes dramatically. I just watched for the color changes on the screen and presto! there was a hump. I am seriously considering a purchase for this year."
