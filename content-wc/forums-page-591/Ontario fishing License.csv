1073981,prov1900,2009-01-15 13:40:00,544,Can't these be purchased at the license retailer?
1074040,hogridnfool,2009-01-15 18:32:00,349,The Ministry of Natural Resources website does'nt mention anything about non-residents needing the card.
1074055,Glenman12,2009-01-15 19:45:00,762,yes...non residents do need the cards and you have to have one before you can get a license...call 1-800-667-1940
1074064,hogridnfool,2009-01-15 21:01:00,349,"Thanks Glenman 12, I dug deeper into the Ministries website and found that you are correct."
1074255,Guest,2009-01-17 07:19:00,0,Larry......will Gummy be selling the card or do we have to look elsewhere......Have you been deer hunting around Lind Center lately??/
1074344,hogridnfool,2009-01-17 17:58:00,349,"Stan? You can get them at the Ministry in Ignace or by calling the 800 number in one of the above postings. I'm going to try the phone next week. Btw, I don' think the Ministry is open on Sat."
1073282,Hump,2009-01-12 14:52:00,578,I was going to get the information to the Anglers Pro Shop in Nestor Falls for my license. I noticed a place on the registration form that says we need to purchase an Ontario Sport Fishing Card. I think it was an additional $9:00. What is this? I don't recall ever buying one before.
1073283,Nimstug,2009-01-12 14:57:00,2605,"Hump,Yes, it is something new. Scroll down some or do a search here on W.C. There's at least one thread that discusses the card. The card was required for Ontarians (Is that what they're called?) and is now required for us folks south of their border. The card is good for three years.Nimstug"
1073289,Golden Eagle,2009-01-12 15:40:00,2642,I didn't find it. Maybe someone will bump to the top?thanks.
1073291,fishmaster,2009-01-12 15:47:00,209,"Here is the info and if you want to read the thread check on about page 3 maybe 4 it is titled Outdoor Card. The following text is from http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...ge/260308.html The Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) is working on a project to improve the fishing and hunting licensing system. Once these improvements are complete, anglers and hunters will be able to purchase Ontario fishing and hunting licences from home, using the Internet or the automated toll-free phone system. As part of this project, MNR will also be developing an automated licensing system for licence issuers to improve service to anglers and hunters. The automated system will mean that all anglers and hunters will need a unique identification number. That is why MNR will be extending the requirement to have an Outdoors Card to non-resident anglers and hunters, effective January 1, 2009. The Outdoors Card will be required to purchase an Ontario fishing or hunting licence, except for a one-day fishing licence. ______________________ Information about Ontario fishing licence options for non Canadian residents in 2009 is available - seehttp://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_165336.html ______________________ More information about the Outdoors Card is available from the Outdoors Card Centre (toll free) at 1-800-387-7011 from anywhere in North America. The hours of operation of the Outdoors Card Centre are Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time). The Outdoors Card website is http://outdoorscard.mnr.gov.on.ca/"

1073353,Golden Eagle,2009-01-12 20:06:00,2642,Thanks Guys. Sounds good for me. I like it.Having my license in my pocket will allow me to save bucks on purchases I probably won't make at Bobby's Corner where I've been getting a license beginning back in 1972.Actually I'll probably make a visit because it's become a habit.
1073545,Hump,2009-01-13 16:20:00,578,"Thanks for the info. If it will help and improve, I will spend the $9.00"
1073929,Babamel2,2009-01-15 08:55:00,414,"If I read the regulations correctly, one has to purchase the outdoor card in person, is that correct? I sure would like to do it by phone or mail."
1073944,Guest,2009-01-15 10:30:00,0,"i received my card and license by phone.number is 1-800-667-1940.i got mine in about a week.i am now hearing that the wait is longer.later,tim"
