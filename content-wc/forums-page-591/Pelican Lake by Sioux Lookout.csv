1074501,Jimmy Jig,2009-01-18 17:33:00,1905,"Yes, Pelican can be real good for walleye, northern and SM bass. Some months are better than others. The other two lakes are as good or better that Pelican in my opinion, but they are bigger. I stay at Frog Rapids every year."
1074522,bpetersen,2009-01-18 18:50:00,251,Thanks for the information. Where is Frog Rapids? Have you ever tried gettting to Lac Seul from Pelican.
1074538,Jimmy Jig,2009-01-18 19:41:00,1905,"Frog Rapids is on the highway that runs to Sioux Lookout. The water under the bridge between Abrams Lake and Pelican Lake is called ""Frog Rapids"" and the camp that is there is Frog Rapids Camp. No I have not run the rapids into Lost Lake. I trailer my boat to Deception Bay which is about 15 miles up the highway . There is a good ramp there. Many people run Pelican Rapids but I just don't like to change it. I have seen the whole lower unit destroyed on a brand new 200HP motor! There is rocks in it and you have to know the run-way to make a clean run. If someone is fishing in an anchored boat when you come down it that when trouble can happen. It is crooked and you cann't see all the way through it."
