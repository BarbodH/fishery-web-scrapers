1075692,prov1900,2009-01-24 07:13:00,544,"1. Quality of fishery 2. Quality/Price of accomodations 3. Time of year as it relates to: a. Number of people (on lake) b. Spawn/turnover/weather/etc Not in that order, more like 1, 3, 2"
1075704,JAY221,2009-01-24 08:05:00,877,1. Size of body of water 2. chance to catch quanity of fish 3. quality(not fancy) of cabins/camp Number 1. because you couldn't get the wife on a lake of the woods with a platoon of soldiers. Later Jay

1075807,Pooch,2009-01-24 19:45:00,4619,"#1 Remote limited access or No crowds / noise #2 Quality of fishery #3 Owners attitude (you can't fake real friendliness.) #4 Price / value #5 Accommodation's #6 The other camp guests There is an intrinsic mix of all the above in choosing a camp. I'm pretty sure that everyone has a similar list, but only prioritizes them differently. I would also imagine that people choose camps that have clientele with similar social values as themselves. Our groups don't want to be kept awake every night by a bunch of folks drinking and yelling all night. No matter how good of guys they are during the day. Then again that same bunch of night owls surely does not want us banging around the camp at five in the morning either. Interesting question. Pooch"
1075833,Rich B,2009-01-24 21:53:00,1081,#1 Remote limited access or No crowds / noise AND drive-time to camp (too many boats on local waters) #2 Quality of fishery #3 quality of cabins/lodge I'll drive further to get to a camp with limited access and decent to good fishing - normally I drive past Lake Erie heading north (with it's great fishing) as there's no place like Canada.
