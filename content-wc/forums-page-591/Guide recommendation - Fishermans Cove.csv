1074988,tjsker,2009-01-20 22:33:00,301,I'm heading up to Lac Seul for the first week of July and staying at Fishermans Cove. I like to line up a guide for the first day. Does anybody have a name of a guide they would recommend that works out of Fishermans Cove?

They already know who is good and will not send you out with someone they do not trust. You are their customer, Fishermans Cove cannot afford to send you out with a guide not worth his stuff! I would not even try and find one, besides, if you are using the camp boats FC may have something to say about it."
