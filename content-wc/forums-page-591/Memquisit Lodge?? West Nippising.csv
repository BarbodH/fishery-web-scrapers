It somewhat depends on the type of spring we have, and the weed growth, but within a 1/4 mile of Memquisit we've had fabulous walleye fishing the last 2 years. Work the small islands and drop-offs, especially just below Squaw island. If that's not working go to the bigger weedbeds outside Muskrat Bay and down past Jennings Point. I've caught up to 50 fish/day including many over the slot. We stay at Lakair Lodge just a couple miles west. Memquisit is a decent place though, and as a youth I stayed there many times. The truth is most of the serious fishermen on Nipissing are after muskies, but there is fine walleye fishing to be had if your friend knows what he's doing."

Maps are available at Memquisit and Lakair. This year we arrive on the 27th of June. If your friend is still there have him look me up."
