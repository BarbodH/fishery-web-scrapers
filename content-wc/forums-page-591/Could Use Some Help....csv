1075597,drlee,2009-01-23 17:19:00,409,"I have booked at Austin's Wilderness Lodge (Lake Pashkokogan) and Press Lake Camp for one and two weeks, respectively, for next summer. I have made many trips to Austin's, and two years at Press Lake. I would like to book an additional week next summer and have the month of August wide open, after the first week. I have read lots of good reports on Gull Rock Lake near Red Lake on this message board and it looks like the type of water I enjoy fishing. I would appreciate some candid comments on, specifically, August fishing on Gull Rock. Also, any recommendations on lodges would be helpful. As to the fishing, I am a pretty experienced walleye fisherman, own boat, good electronics, have fished a variety of lakes, etc. Would like to know, given that weather can be a big factor, what type of structure, depth, areas in general, baits I should be attentive to; I most enjoy jig fishing, but also I am pretty good with Little Joe spinner rigs. I would be happy to provide my thoughts about Pashkokogan or Press Lake, and I have fished numerous other northern Ontario lakes since 1987. I am also sponsoring two new laws and I am looking for support from avid sports people to lobby the Ontario government: (1) ability to purchase for 25 cents a special permit to be able to drink beer in a fishing boat if you agree to pay a $1 fine for each time you are caught and (2) an allowance to drink beer in your car if your wait (coming or going) at the border is longer than 30 minutes. Obviously, the driver would NOT be permitted to imbibe. Sure wish it was spring."

1075623,v-bay gord,2009-01-23 19:06:00,3168,How about sponsoring a law whereby people refrain from asking redundant questions about walleye fishing? Come on.....just messin' with you Doc!
1075625,drlee,2009-01-23 19:13:00,409,"I sent a private message to the gentleman who possibly misunderstood my attempt at humor. However, I take offense on your suggestion that my question was inappropriate. It was honest and straightforward in intent. I have received many kind and understanding responses on this message board...I will assume that your response was, indeed, a tongue in cheek response. If not, I await your apology. Dr. Lee"
1075632,prov1900,2009-01-23 19:55:00,544,"Can't help you with your fishing question, but I thought your drinking thing was spot on. Of course, maybe I drink too much...nah. Don't get too discouraged, it is that time of year when we are all suffering from a little cabin fever."
1075656,v-bay gord,2009-01-23 22:10:00,3168,"No offense intended, Doc. My humor, similar to yours, could use a little work."
1075668,tackleman,2009-01-24 05:42:00,444,"So you want to know about Gullrock, Let me tell you a few basics about it.It is just over 16,700 acres with an average depth of 26 feet and a maximum depth of 56 feet. with 65.8 miles of shoreline ( I pulled this info off my map)from gullrock you can fish Keg Lake, Two Island Lake, Ranger Lake, Red Lake and the chukuni river system without having to trailer a boat.gullrock has lots of structure be they reef of rock or sand flat bottoms and has a river flowing into and out of it as well as a number of creeks (some big, some small).MOst people use jigs or spinners or lindy rigs and use live bait like minnnows and leeches. however, I have used GULP in the past couple years and though I don't think it is as good as live bait on this lake, you still catch fish with it (I guess if the bite is on, the fish will eat anything)There are times when the may fly hatch is on that the fishing slows down but generally speaking, Gullrock is as good a lake as any in the north.there are walleye, northerns, perch, whitefish, suckers, ling and the odd rock bass in the lake and early in the spring there are always a few lakers that have come down from red lake that are caught.I think Golden Hook Camp has a map on it's web site so google it and take a look at the map.I live on the lake year round and am not associated with any camp but I can tell you the camps on gullrock are quite well maintained and have decent equipment. Google sunset country, they should have a list of camps and web sites on gullrock."
