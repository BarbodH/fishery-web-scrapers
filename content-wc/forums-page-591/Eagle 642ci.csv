Do any of yoy use or have you ever used an eagle 642ci GPS / Fishfinder or any Eagle GPS / Fishfinder for that matter? If so what do yo think of them. Do they have the same problems that Lowrance seem to be having? Thanks"
1075746,tackleman,2009-01-24 11:52:00,444,"I use an Eagle 500c gps, an Eagle 640c depth finder on my big boat and have an Eagle 240 combo on my small boat. I have never had any problems with them and for the money, they are fairly decent units. I don't know what problems you are talking about with the lowrance units, but I used to use a lowrance depth finder and it is now a spare for me. I never had any trouble with itI know some chips won't work in some units but when I tested the new chip I got at cabelas in a similar unit to mine it worked fine. now I just have to wait till spring and I uncrate my boat to install it and put it to work.I saw a 642 at cabelas and it looked similar to my 640 so I thought it was probably just an upgrade to mine"
1075747,Pooch,2009-01-24 12:02:00,4619,"I've always been a flasher guy, until a year ago. Last winter I picked up an Eagle 500c and used it on three trips to Canada. Really liked it and it performed without a flaw. This year I bought a 640c to replace the 500c (boys and toys you know) and while I have not used on the water just running it on the demo mode for twelve hours, I am really happy with the ease of use and the sharp clear imagery. I really look forward to running it through areas of the lakes that I am familiar with. Or at least 'think' I'm familiar with. Over the years this is now my fourth Eagle unit and they have not once faltered in any way. The very first one finally died from ten years of rough handling and old age. As far as the GPS and mapping problems with the Lowrance I can't help you, but no doubt someone will chime in sooner or later. Pooch"
1075908,stevensinks,2009-01-25 10:39:00,330,Thank you for your reply's. I have been using Eagle fish finders for several years now and been very pleased. I am needing a new fishfinder to replace an old one that came on my boat so I decided to get a GPS combo that I could take to Canada this summer. I have read every thing that I can find on here about them and most of the info I have found has been on Lowrance or Humminbird. I didnt want to spend over $500 which prety much took Lowrance out of the picture besides it seemed that alot of owners were having problems with them. I have never owned a Humminbird but decided to get one that I had seen at Cabelas for $499. When I got up there they no longer had it. Looking around I came across this Eagle 642ci. As I said I have always had good luck with Eagle and it was on sale for $450 so I bought it. You now only have 90 days to return a fishfinder to Cabelas and I wont have it on the water before then. So Im trying to find out what I can while I still have time to return it if there are problems.
