558451,Guest,2006-06-14 12:21:00,0,"Fishing was good. We went to Manitu area first and that was some tougher fishing. Our ""Honey Hole"" let us down. We found the fish in 2-4 feet of water in the weeds. It was fun fishing once we found them. You could see them dart out of the weeds and grap the jig. The next two days we went to Sen Bay. It is usually quiet when we are up there but it was busy both days. From the ""main"" shore lunch spot on Sen you could see a boat on every point working. At one time a group of 6 or 7 boats were having shore lunch. Boats were cruising everywhere. The fishing went in streaks. We were pounding them one hour and nothing for the next. Our whole went dry and I figured it did for everyone and then I see my father in law's boat pounding the fish on the clam side of the lake. They pulled 30 in one hour. Their boat whent through 27 dozen minnows while we used 5 dozen. They caught more fish but not by a whole lot. We found that crawlers worked almost as well for us. I tore them in half and put both halves on the lime green stand up jig and did well. I usually live bait rig and on this trip I mostly jigged. It was fun. We got into FR for our trip. We will come up Thursday and leave Monday morning. The last night we do need to stay in a hotel though. I'll stop down to visit. Curious to hear what you have to say about your navionics chip for Lac Suel. See you in a week! Otts"
