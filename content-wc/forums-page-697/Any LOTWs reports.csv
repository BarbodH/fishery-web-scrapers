Have you ever been there before? Jeff and Gina are great people and Bob is probably the best guide I have ever fished with on any lake. I usually go up for two weeks at the end of May but had to push my trip back to September this year. Shoot me an email at [email protected], I would love to hear more about your trip. Your right about the food, I always leave a little fatter than I was when I got there."
558344,bronzeback77,2006-06-12 11:41:00,97,How has the fishing been?
558346,Slayer,2006-06-12 11:50:00,41,"Just returned on June 10. Fished the Sabaskong / Miles bay areas. Fish are in summer pattern with water in the mid to high 70's in the shallows. Main lake areas in the high 60's. Walleyes were biting heavy with lite Northern action. ""Slayer"""
558360,Guest,2006-06-12 15:59:00,0,When you say summer patterns do you mean they were on the humps? What water depths were you finding the walleye? Did you fish Obabikon at all? Thanks for the reply and any other input.
558387,Slayer,2006-06-13 07:19:00,41,"Yes, the fish were on humps. Average depth was 24ft, while on occasion they were right on top at 15ft. When into O.B. and caught mostly smaller Northerns. The weeds and grass are up thick already. Had a difficult time finding the larger Northerns that week. ""Slayer"""
558388,Guest,2006-06-13 07:48:00,0,Thanks for the info. Heading up on Friday.
558401,Guest,2006-06-13 11:58:00,0,"Slayer, how was the getting into Ob with the water level down? I understand it is down somewhat? Thanks, Bill Krejca"
558405,Slayer,2006-06-13 12:35:00,41,"Water levels are down from last year at this time, but are pretty much on with the hydrographic charts for the area. The entrance to OB was passable with trim up. No real current to speak of other than wave action. ""Slayer"""
558418,Guest,2006-06-13 19:30:00,0,"We'll be staying in Miles Bay the week of July 7, so I would appreciate any reports from groups that are in the area the next few weeks. We'll be targeting Walleye, Muskie, Pike and Smallmouth and have never fished the area. Thanks."
558446,Guest,2006-06-14 10:46:00,0,"I returned on June 10 as well from Sabaskong area and we thought the walleyes were a little slow(I am not a walleye fisherman so take this with a grain of salt)but we got our limits. Northerns were plentiful up to 8-9lb bass were spotty but a little nicer than in past years. northerns=weeds,spinnerbaits,rattletraps Walleyes=weeds,jig/minnow,rattletraps bass=round rocks,spinnerbaits,topwater,crankbaits(didn't try plastics) water temps in bays were 70-74 and lake appeared to us to be down 1-2'"
558457,Guest,2006-06-14 17:22:00,0,"fished out of snake bay last week. the bay itself produced plenty of small northern and a few walleye, got some bonus nice crappie off the dock. the clear water in that area was tough, but closer to souix narrows we did ok with northern and bass on the windy shores. once we went through the narrows into long and yellow girl area and hit the stained water, fishing was much improved.if any of you will be fishing that area soon, we caught alot of walleye in the little bays to the left as you get into long bay (bouy e 46) watch out for rocks, but very fishable. we trolled floating rapalas for all of our fish.did get a 9 # 28-1/2 walleye jig and minnow with the guide. if any of you have never fished out of white pine lodge give it a try ..food unbe frickin lievable!! wish i was there now, will be at lac seul evergreen lodge on 8-12 cant wait... bender out"
