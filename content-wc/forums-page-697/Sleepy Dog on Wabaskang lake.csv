Now, Monday after the trip, I'm wondering why we didn't switch after year 2. SLEEPY DOG is incredible, from the view, to the boats and motors (25 hp 4 stroke w/electric start!) to the great and super clean cabins! Also, Tom, the owner/host is the nicest most accomidating guy! The fishing was pretty good too. Sleepy Dog will be our choice for years to come! YAHTZEE!"

His Father/Mother built Wine Lake Camp from the ground up. He was born with an axe in one hand and a fishing pole in the other. Tom grew up in the bush and you will not find a more knowledgable, likeable individual anywhere. This man is truly a McGyver of the north!! His cabins are the nicest you will find on 105 and his largest cabin has two bathrooms!!!!!!!"
