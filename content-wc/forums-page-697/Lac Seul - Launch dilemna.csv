558509,Jimmy Jig,2006-06-16 10:23:00,1905,Yes you will need a permit. On the North end of the bridge about 6 miles South of Sioux L.O. stop at Frog Rapids Camp they have the permits or up the road about 3 more miles is a bait shop.

We typically launch in Hudson and mainly stay within 10 miles of that part of the big lake. However, this year, our boats have taken major upgrades, so now we can cover a lot more water. Smallest boat has 40HP, biggest is 125HP. We want to get on some big fish this year. Our goal is to get a 30+ walleye and a 40+ northern, and any size muskie netted this year (6 days on the water). Question is: do we continue to launch in Hudson and cover water from there, or do we launch at Deception and go from there? (where is the Deception launch from Sioux Lookout?) We're always up for new things, new areas...etc."
555416,JohnAB,2006-03-16 09:25:00,49,The Deception Bay launch is on the highway from Sioux Lookout to Savant Lake about 5 to 10 miles out. There is a big sign posted there saying Deception Bay launch. It costs to launch there as the town/county looks after the launch area. Buy passes in Sioux Lookout for your vehicle.
555418,wooglin,2006-03-16 10:47:00,371,Awesome! Do you know by chance where that would be on this map?http://crownlanduseatlas.mnr.gov.on....fs/_930500.pdf
555424,JohnAB,2006-03-16 16:10:00,49,"From what I can see, the map does not go far enough east. Sioux Lookout is on the eastern edge of the map."
555428,wooglin,2006-03-17 11:00:00,371,"Sorry 'bout that, how about this map?http://crownlanduseatlas.mnr.gov.on....fs/_920500.pdf Thanks!"
555429,JohnAB,2006-03-17 11:21:00,49,"wooglin, I sent you an email. Have a Google Earth map with the launch identified on it as well as the launch point for Sen bay. I can email it to you. As your map is a PDF file I cannot put the points on it. But if you zoom in a bit and follow highway 516 north east of Sioux Lookout you will see where the highway goes between Deception bay and Deception Lake. Launch point is right there. You can access Deception bay on the left or go down the highway a very short distance and on your right you will see the launch point for Deception Lake. The Deception Lake launch site is not a formally developed site but you should see a vehicle or two parked there and the launch down right by the highway."
555433,hawkeye,2006-03-17 21:41:00,112,"Fish Lac Seul 2X year, this will be my 28. I have used Deception and Hudson many times. I vote Hudson for you since you are camping close by. If water levels permit you don't have to go clear up to the month of the English river to head North. There is a small 40' opening across from Italian Bay (Where I've got lots of fish years ago) I can best describe the opening if you look at a map and if you were going home through Crooked Rapids and keep bearing to the right of the open water you will find it. To all those reading this I feel the world class fishing starts North and East of Manatu Rapids.???(can't spell) Or, 50 minutes north of Hudson at 40mph.are where Huge numbers of eyes are. They migrate North to four rivers and spawn, then they work their way down throuth Chamberland Narrows south, sometime in early June you have to travel clear up there to find eyes in great numbers. They then spread out over the Northeren feeding flats around Bear Narrows and Grassy Bay. Many do not get down as far as Crooked Rapids. Old timers 50yr. ago tell of all the four lb. eyes off the Souix Lookout docks, but had to go out North as years went by. Wapsi Bay was the holy grail of walleyes years ago, but its under to much pressure now. If you are near Hudson you would have to travel to Sioux Lookout then 10 miles North to Deception boat lanch."
555436,Guest,2006-03-17 22:49:00,0,"Take 516 NE of Sioux Lookout for 7 or 8 miles. On this map, you can see where the road goes between Deception Bay and Deception Lake - the launch is on the left. Probably still a bit of a boat ride from there."
555438,wooglin,2006-03-18 07:31:00,371,"Thanks guys. We have boated from Hudson to Crooked Rapids already (thats a pretty cool spot) and have had minimal luck. We're just brainstorming to see if there are hotter spots within boating distance from Deception (or the secret Sen Bay launch), more than there are near Hudson. Keep the info. coming!"
558497,wooglin,2006-06-16 08:08:00,371,"Do you need a daily pass to launch at Deception? If so, can you purchase them in Sioux Lookout (where)? >The Deception Bay launch is on the highway from Sioux Lookout >to Savant Lake about 5 to 10 miles out.
