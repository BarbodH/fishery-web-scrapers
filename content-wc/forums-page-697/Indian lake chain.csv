I think it was mainly a timing issue. We did have plenty to eat, but some people in camp did not adjust and did poorly. I am only aware of 2 big fish from the camp during the week, none by our group. If you are staying at Clark's, don't be afraid to ask, because they are always helpful. We did pick up several muskies while jigging for eyes. The biggest one I caught was 30"". Fritz"

558421,Guest,2006-06-13 20:25:00,0,"Dollure, We caught most of our fish relating to shoreline wood with wind. Some were quit shallow, 2 - 3 feet, but most were deeper. We fished the whole chain except Forest Lake. We did not catch anything in Little Boulder, Moose or Little Moose. The water is lower than last year and I took out a prop blade on the trip to Moose.
