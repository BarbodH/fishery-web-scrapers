We recently moved to a new house and when I went to the WI DMV to get my license updated, they said it could not be done because our new address was not in thier computer system yet. Our house is new construction in a new development and apparently they computer system that the WI DMV uses has not been updated with the new roads, addresses, etc. I have to send some assessors info or proof of sale of the house into the DMV so they can manually update the system and I can then go back in and the computer system will accept the address change. My question is, how does this affect my ability to cross? I have a valid WI driver's license, but the address on it is my old house (I moved within WI). I have my birth cert, my kids have thiers, and so does my wife. My wife's license is the same way...old address. Am I going to have a problem?"
558439,Guest,2006-06-14 09:27:00,0,How will they know if your address is incorrect?
558440,Guest,2006-06-14 09:30:00,0,"Do they ask you what your current address is? Or, do they take your license and scan the barcode on the back, and does that pop up your current address? The guy at the DMV had me fill out a change of address card, which I think updates your record. But for some reason, the computer system at the DMV would not allow it to print out a new address if the address software could not verify where I lived."

I didn't have any problems, but I'm going to make it a point to get to the DMV to get that fixed. I doubt you'll have issues, but I guess they can always come up. Maybe a letter from the DMV indicating your new addy isn't on file would help ease the situation if/when it came up. Good luck!"
558442,Guest,2006-06-14 09:51:00,0,"I'd stay away from the letter from the DMV. Even if you could get one, it woudl probably raise some red flag and delay things. Just hand them your license and answer the questions. If they ask you if everything on your license is correct, answer yes, because according to the state it is correct."

When you even mention the state instead of your country they roll their eyes like you're from another planet. Don't worry about your street adress, they could care less. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
