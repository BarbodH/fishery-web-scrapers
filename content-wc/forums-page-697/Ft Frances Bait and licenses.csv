558506,Guest,2006-06-16 09:27:00,0,It is less than 5 min from when you cross over. I believe you follow 11 East on Scott street and you go right by it.
558507,Mohleye,2006-06-16 09:30:00,368,"That might be our best bet. I found a FT Frances chamber of commerce website, and they list Witherspoon's One Stop on Hwy 11 West. Anybody used them?"
