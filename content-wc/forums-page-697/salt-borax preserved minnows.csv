558408,Dr. Lee,2006-06-13 14:11:00,15,"We have purchased salt/borax preserved minnows in Amherst, WI for a number of years and have used them on a variety of lakes in Ontario with good success. Does anyone know where we can purchase this type of bait? The Amherst connection is getting more difficult to make since a change in ownership. We will be going from the Sheboygan County area through Superior and on to International Falls the first week in July. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
