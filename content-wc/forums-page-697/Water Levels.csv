Also, can I expect the walters to be in there normal summer patterns? Have been busy lately and haven't had a chance to pay that close attention to the weather up there. Seems like it has been kind of warm lately though. Thanks, Newby"

But, that all can change within a day or two with a long cold front and the MNR letting water out (or in)... We leave in 11 days, we're planning warmer and mid/late summer patterns."
