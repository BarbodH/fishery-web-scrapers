In July on Whitefish Lake the Walleye are primarily evening and morning bite, either jig fishing on structure like sandbars leading to shallows , or slowdrifting wormharnesses till you find what depth they are at as they move in or out of nightfeeding spots. I have found no difference whether worms or minnows used, and some luck using artificials after dark. As for Pike , the typical big thumping lures tipped with live bait . good luck jake"
