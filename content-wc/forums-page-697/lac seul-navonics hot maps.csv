Is that intended to show the best routes or is it the supposed channel? Maybe the answer is yes to both of those. I would assume, however, that it is possible to still find an unmarked rock the size of a buick, so I am still a little worried about going full tilt."
558374,wi dogfish,2006-06-12 20:42:00,36,"Hi, I'm going to the big lake july 15. Anyone willing to rent me the canada chip for a fee. Would help you defer the purchase price. Or I would be willing to buy the chip from someone that would fit a lowrance 332. Thanks for any help, Jason"
558376,1shooter,2006-06-12 21:05:00,1493,"wi dogfish, which lake your refering to? LOTW or Lac seul? If LOTW I may be able to help you out."
558390,wi dogfish,2006-06-13 08:51:00,36,I guess I was refering to Lac seul. I think the premium canada covers everything up there. thanks for the offer though. Jason

558036,scar,2006-06-04 07:41:00,196,"bought the navonics premium hot map for canada right before my trip (may 25 -29).i have fooled around a little on lac seul before leaving from both the hudson and deception landings so i am a little familar with navigation. i could not believe the definition though that is on these chips-all water contour lines,every reef, even bouys are marked exactly where they are located! day one we went to sen bay and it was a no brainer (getting there that is) as the fishing was poor -locals said that the walleyers have not moved down from chamberlin yet. when we got back to the landing met a guy who had just got back from bear narrows (about 5 miles south of chamberlin) he said their 2 boats must have caught 300 eyes that day! we knew where we were going next got back to our cabin and pulled the maps out and saw how far bear narrows was from the deception landing and i actually felt a little intimidated (about 40 miles) the next morning we took off and headed due east through the deception area. couldn' believe my luck when it was time to start heading north a thin red trail appeared on my map with the routes to various fishing spots all ready laid out. following the trail to chamberlin was as easy as driving your car there. we passed hundreds of reefs on the way but as long as we were on the trail no worries! only anxious moment was in the area called ""the rags"" (big stump field) the people at navonics did an excellent job with lac seul-looks like the beast has been tamed! scar"
558042,iafishdoc,2006-06-04 11:05:00,4,"So you are saying the gps device draws and leaves a trail outlining your trip out, so all you have to do is follow the line in? I did buy the Lowrance ifinder Expedition, got a great deal...$180.00...and bought the Hotmaps Premium canada edition...can't wait to fish."

558050,iafishdoc,2006-06-04 17:57:00,4,How do you set up the trail ahead of time before going out on the water?
558057,scar,2006-06-04 20:47:00,196,>How do you set up the trail ahead of time before going out on >the water? > it is done by the map maker. lac suel is so huge and most of the good fishing spots are accessible by only a few landings it is an added feature that is on the card that i wasn't even aware of when i bought the card. sure did make traveling easy. scar
558087,Guest,2006-06-05 15:16:00,0,"I don't know if that beast can be tamed. The beast changes every year and can change from week to week. Once you feel like you have it tamed she will jump up and claim a part of you. Be careful, your worst enemy on that lake is yourself. The only thing you have in your favor is that the good Lord watches over dummies and idiots. That saves a few. The rest will find rocks sooner or later."
558123,Guest,2006-06-06 18:18:00,0,I purchased the premium Navonics cartridge for Canada and was looking for the 3 underwater hazards that claimed 2 lower units/1 prop/skeg and guess what... They ain't on there! Checked for some other reefs that I fish and they ain't there either. Use caution on LS... She WILL bite you! Just ask my insurance company....
558125,Guest,2006-06-06 18:35:00,0,"I also have purchased the card, but won't get a chance to use it for another few weeks. After looking over the northeast section of the lake, I would say that navionics captured 90% of the hazards, there were even a few marked that I was not aware of. I would not buy this card with the expectation that you will be able to avoid every hazard. This card appears to be an excellent tool to help you navigate to a unfamilar place or if you get a little lost it can definitely get you back to camp. The detail level far exceeds anything else on the market (for lac seul)."
558162,Guest,2006-06-07 16:43:00,0,"Can't say bout Lac Seul, but bought the new Canada card for LOTW with the understanding and assurance that the hazards were well marked! Bunk!!! I know of many marked hazards and some not marked on good paper maps of LOTW and none of them showed up on the Navionics chip! It's one of those woulda/coulda/shoulda had him demo the chip for me before I bought it so I could see if the hazards were shown, which they are not, but I guess it will still serve as a somewhat handy Nav-aid in finding spots I haven't fished or been to yet with the hopes there are no hazards in the way!! Hawker"
558220,Guest,2006-06-09 07:04:00,0,"I got the the laminated version of the Navionics lac Seul map from www.trakmaps.com. Shows exactly the same information as the chip, love the chip but I like to have a paper backup."
