558404,SOUTHARK,2006-06-13 12:10:00,9,I am going to be fishing Miminiska on the 23rd of july and was just wondering what I was in for. I fished makokibatan last year and the fishing was great. Wanting to hear from somebody that has fished it before. any pointers would be appreciated....thanks robbie

We absolutely hammered the walleyes off the rocks casting jigs and slammed the pike out of the inlets. What a trip. Have a great time and keep someone at the front of the boat checking for rocks at all times."

558449,SOUTHARK,2006-06-14 12:16:00,9,We are going with the Liddles...Steve and Heather run a great operation...they are on the Albany river (I think) they have Miminiska and Makokobatan Lodge...we flew out of Nakina last year going to Makok on a floatplane and this year we are flying out of Thunder Bay ...Miminiska has a grass landing strip from what I understand. this will be my second trip to Canada...but I don't see how it could get much better....accomodations wise and food.....we also caught alot of fish.....
