1224954,Babamel2,2010-08-04 05:57:00,414,"Anyone have any road reports for Highway 53? We will be leaving in two weeks and want to have an idea about how 53 conditions. Earlier I heard that there was some construction in Duluth, is that finished?"
1224960,Skyraptor,2010-08-04 06:09:00,291,I will know about 53 when I take m son to Duluth to go to college this coming Sunday. I will post a report then. Then on the 21st I'm off to Canada as well for a week of fishing.
1225032,DanM57,2010-08-04 09:39:00,135,"53 is down to 2 lanes around Spooner and Trego, WI. I don't know how long the construction area is but it goes as far as you can see north of the 63 split going to Hayward and south of the 63 split going to Spooner.I think the WI DOT has a website that details road construction."
1225232,Steve of Madison,2010-08-04 22:16:00,230,"there is construction around the Bloomer and Rice lake areas, but should be finishing up soon. Check the WIDOT for construction updates.The lanes are open just alot of barrels, no real delays!"
1225268,@Lunker,2010-08-05 06:56:00,835,"Here's the DOT's website:http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/travel/road/workzones.htmHaven't been through since July 12th, but I can't imagine the construction in Duluth is completed. You'll probably want to follow Hwy 53 through ""downtown"" Duluth. I normally cut off on I-35 / Hwy 2 through Proctor but 35 is ALL ripped up and I would think it's going to take the rest of the year if not into next to complete.Post back here with what you find because I'll be heading back up on Aug 27th."
1225335,Babamel2,2010-08-05 11:53:00,414,thanks for all the info. I will be returning on the 28th.
1225571,Duckjunkie194,2010-08-06 13:10:00,351,"I drove that route south on the 24th of July and they were getting ready to start the construction around Duluth. It looked like most was the downtown area and near the bridge, so I wouldnt imagine it being a huge setback. Also the Rice Lake and Hayward areas are still one lane but moving around 60 mph....Not much of a set back there either....."
1225976,rather-be-fishin,2010-08-08 11:17:00,429,"Yes there is still construction in Duluth but once your are past that, HWY 53 to Int'l Falls is clear, NO construction! Safe travels and good fishing to you! Border wait times both ways for us on a Sat was VERY LONG 2 hours going into Canada and 3 hours coming out of Canada. We arrived at the borders around 11am"
1226708,rather-be-fishin,2010-08-10 19:06:00,429,"Just today there is now road construction on HWY 53 N in MN just north of Cotton, MN for about 15 miles or so.....goes down to one lane....not sure how long it will last."
