1226635,Xswab,2010-08-10 15:07:00,337,"Nimstug........I have been using grubs on our stained reservoirs in Montana with very good results. I almost always have one on early in the year, with a crawler on a second line. Soon as the plastic gets hit....its off with the fresh meat for the rest of the year.Purple and shades of blue seem to work best for me. I have tried the firetails, but prefer YUM and some others in 3-4"". The tails on cabelas grubs don't seem to hold up as long or as well, IMO.The grubs also work well on slo death hooks w/a football float. Have fun and good fishing."
1226681,adempsey,2010-08-10 17:35:00,963,"IMO Yum brand are the best value plastics around. The 3"" grubs work great for me. Standard colors for those water are chartreuse, white and pink. For Yum I like White, Pink Blush (my favorite), Chartreuse, Chartreuse Silver and Lime Core. They are relatively cheap so you can grab several different colors to try.For smallies you might want to get some white tubes, but the white grubs will work too.One thing to note as well, Yum recently changed (at least in locally where I am) the amount of grubs per package. It used to be 25 and it's now 15. So, take a look on the rack for the older stock.I do own some of those Fire Tail grubs, but unfortunately have not tried them yet.Good luck!"

1227084,DavKin,2010-08-12 04:46:00,104,I have had good success with Bass Pro's Cajun trailer in white. The guy who recommended them to me said that they are made by Yum but private labeled as BP's house brand. White with pink tip do well with a pink lead head jig.
