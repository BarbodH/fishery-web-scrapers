1226516,jjwillie,2010-08-10 08:18:00,5,"Hi all-I must say, there is a wealth of knowledge on this site and it is very much appreciated.I leave for a fly-in in two weeks with Air melancon in Quebec. I will be fishing for walleye and pike, with a greater emphasis on pike in larger sizes.We've been to this lake twice before and I've caught a handful over 40"". I caught them on a 3/4oz red eye wobbler over a sunken idsland about 8' deep with sporadic weed growth. The problem is, I caught all of the large fish at this one spot. I'm trying to find some newer areas to target. What do you pike fisherman look for when goin to a new lake?My question for the guys that are proficient in targeting monster pike is: If there are a number of weedy bays, do you stay along the egdes of the weeds, in 10-15 feet of water and toss inline spinners or something similar. It seems in late August (although its getting cooler) the smaller pike are still back closer to shore in the thick weed growth. They're fun to catch, but I'm looking for 35-40"" plus.This lake has a lot of shoreline, a lot of weedy bays with access to deeper water. If its overcast, I'll be casting all day long. Can anyone offer suggestions as to where to target or lures? I'll be using a medium heavy outfit with 50lb powerpro, titanium leader.thanks"
1226519,tv4fish,2010-08-10 08:32:00,2694,"Have you ever used/tried ""jerk baits"" ? Or even some of the larger sized spinner baits? I've had the best luck for larger pike on the outer edges of the ""cabbage"" type weeds. I have found as you have - lots of smaller ones will inhabit the shallower denser weeds."
1226522,jjwillie,2010-08-10 08:38:00,5,"yeah, i was always a huge fan of the 5-6"" bass assasins rigged weedless. But, theyre more of a surface lure so they don't get down too deep and I don't know if a pike laying on the bottom in 10-15' of water will see it. Ive seen an increasing number of people chucking large spoons with twister trailers."
1226525,octanehi5,2010-08-10 08:45:00,1104,"This yr up north has been very warm early in the yr, this has put the fish down very deep,for example I caught walleye deeper this yr than any other yr I have fished in the north 52' I caught walleyes,in yrs. before the deepest we caught walleye was 28' jiging, this means pike feed on walleyes they will be deep also, the small pike are always hiding in the weeds. look for deep structure for the pike to ambush the walleyes, the lures you are using are fine ,try some big paddletails good luck"
1226527,PIKEMAN330,2010-08-10 08:48:00,101,I can't really help you with catching large Pike in Aug. because I have never had any success catching good fish at that time of year. Spring or fall are a lot better.There seem to be lots of little ones but the big girls are very hard to find when the water is that warm.
1226574,jjwillie,2010-08-10 11:42:00,5,"well, i should specify a little more clearly. we are going the last full week of august. there's a full moon and if history serves me correct, we are usually starting the woodstoves in the evening. I think the bigger fish are starting to move more in a transitional mode, i am just not sure where (on the lake) to target them."
1226576,Golden Eagle,2010-08-10 11:49:00,2642,"August is one of my favorite months for pike fishing, along with May, June, July, September and October. There's no such thing as a bad month for catching pike. .............unless you go where they ain't.You'll have a good trip."
1226605,Lenman,2010-08-10 13:33:00,19,"I'd try trolling deep divers fast enough to get 20' ~ 25' on drop offs and points. There are usually one to two large pike (in a good lake system) hanging on a point. Make a couple of passes and move on if nothings hitting. You can also use smaller divers with some bottom bouncing weights to reduce trolling speed and still get the depth you need. The shallower lakes can have them anywhere, especially the weed lines. Rapid outlets trolling against the flow works well also. Troll right on the edge of the fast moving water. With that said I caught them the last couple days of July like that and I got a 40"" in 7ft on a walleye spinner rig! Go figure. With all the the rain a few weeks before we got up there the lake wasn't usual! Good catching!"
1226636,kgeary,2010-08-10 15:08:00,88,"Don 't go ""where they ain't"" EDGESThe edge of cabbage bedsThe edge of mid lake humps.The edge of mid lake flats,The edge of drop offs into deeper waterThe edge of current breaks.Use anything you want as long as it is a Suick(just kidding)But Suicks are extremely good if fished right.Stick baits.A simple white Jig tipped with a minnow.Large johnson silver minnows 1 1/8 inch tipped with a white pwoer grub.Large musky size spinner baits. Soft baits are also good. Don't fish too deep,Where are the small walleye (key forage), the whitefish, the ciscoes.Colors depend on the lakeI'm assuming dark water if you were catching in 8 foot with scattered weeds.Can't go too far wrong if it has a white bottom side. Could turn into a book if covered it all.I have a bunch of articles on Pike fishing on my website that pertain to just about any lake you will fish."
