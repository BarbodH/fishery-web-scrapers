I can give you a lot of info on Nestor Falls Fly-In. Dave and Michele run a first class operation in every regard; i.e. good planes, great pilots, clean camps and lakes with lots of fish. This may be your first trip with NF Fly-in, but it won't be your last. Their repeat business is the best in the business. I haved lived summers in Nestor Falls for 57 years and their reputation is impeccable. Go and enjoy your upcoming trip. It will be a great experience. If you need any further information, just send me a message."
