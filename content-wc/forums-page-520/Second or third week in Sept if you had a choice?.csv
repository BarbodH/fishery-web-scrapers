My question is this: For those that have gone in the early Fall, do you think the 4th-11th or the 11th-18th would be better? Or would it be a wash? They have a cabin either week and I want to let them and my coworker know soon. BTW I like to fish walleyes/pike about 50/50 if that makse a difference.Matt"
1224359,Golden Eagle,2010-08-02 06:48:00,2642,"4th thru 11th gives you a new moon on September 8. You could have 4 days of a great bite. But, weather can trump favorable moon phases."
1224393,wallydave,2010-08-02 08:20:00,2151,"I it were my choice, I would love a two week fishing trip! I will be not so patiently waiting until June 2011! I have heard from a fishing buddy, and from some post here, that the walleye's are feeding to get ready for winter. Let us know how your trip went!"
1224460,Freytown,2010-08-02 12:46:00,770,I agree with golden eagle on fishing the moon phase. Anything that aids the fishing can't hurt. Temps are not going to change much in 1 week.Good luck.
1226356,eyewitness,2010-08-09 16:58:00,680,Go over the new moon phase period. Lac Suel being the day bite lake that it is will only e better during the day over a new moon (no moon) phase......Am thinking of going there myself in Sept. where do you stay? Fall can be unbelievable fishing there....
1226363,Golden Eagle,2010-08-09 17:23:00,2642,"I wrote of having 4 days of a good bite, but should have said 5 days or more of a good, maybe great bite......................unless the weather decides otherwise.It's a time of change and a lot of good things are about to happen."
1226395,flntknp17,2010-08-09 19:40:00,151,Decided to go to Gold Pines on Sept 4-11.Can't wait! Should be good. I will just hope for no heat and no crazy windy days.ThanksMatt
