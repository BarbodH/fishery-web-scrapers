1121184,phishfearme,2009-07-15 13:54:00,1242,"my group of 4 just returned from a 10 day trip to wettlaufer lake using North of 51 outfitters out of pickle lake. this was our second trip (my previous report is posted) to this fly-in lake which is about 10-11 miles long with a single housekeeping cabin on the meen river about 40 miles west of pickle lake. in summary - bad weather! very cold then rain then a 40 knot wind storm (which spawned the tornado near ear falls that killed 3 guys at the fisherman's cove resort). the high temp for the first 5 days was 52degF with lows in the upper 30's. the only reasonable day reached the mid 60's. the consequence of all this cold weather was cold water in the lake. surface temps were 56 or 57 degF (last year at this time it was in the low to mid 70's) and many of the fish we caught felt like they came out of a fridge. but in spite of all this, we did have some excellent fishing days - especially early in the trip - with 125-150 walleye in the boat per day (2 guys) the first few days. there was a hugh difference between fishing in the main lake and fishing in the four flow areas (inlet, outlet, first narrows and second narrows). the main lake produced scattered small walleye (12-15 inchers) and the flow areas were packed with larger walleyes. clearly we spent alot of time at the flow areas but in an effort to acheive some variety, we fished the main lake areas over and over only to get the same results. for the main lake, the ""sweet spot"" was around 12 ft deep (last year it was about 7 ft deep and we caught all sizes all over the lake). fishing shallower yielded few fish. the fishing results in the flow areas though were pretty incredible - especially in the first narrows. in the first narrows at dusk, i was fortunate enough to land a 29 inch walleye - beating my previous personal best by 2 inches. it's remarkable that this small lake can produce such large fish. the first narrows also produced 4 - 24 inchers, a 23.5 and 2 - 23's not to mention numerous 20-22 inchers and others. what an excellent spot - it may be the best single spot we've ever experienced. for pike, we finally broke into the trophy range with a 39.5 incher - just couldn't get it to 40 - at the second narrows and a 35incher at the outlet. there was also at least two that got away. we also got maybe 8 or so in the 32 inch range but you'd swear they were larger due to their girth and large heads. these were all caught fishing for walleye. all in all, a wonderful trip in spite of the weather. the wettlaufer cabin will be undergoing some major improvements this month (but it was still quite acceptable to us as is) including a new deck and i think a fish cleaning house. the outfitter provided all we could expect from an outfitter - boats and motors were excellent - and i'd highly recommend them. any questions - feel free to ask. phish"

1121204,IaDave,2009-07-15 15:18:00,476,Phish- Did you make it over to Lacky or Lecky Lake? That's the one that has the small cabin.
1121277,phishfearme,2009-07-15 20:02:00,1242,"dave - good to hear from you and i hope all is well with you! yes, we did get to leckey lake for a one day trip. the two guys who went flew in as the portage we hoped to build was either too wet or too long. they had a blast checking out various potential hot spots - and they found three that were ""the way fishing used to be"". the hot spots were all in the dobie river outlet or inlet and were excellent for both size and continuous action. they also trolled for pike an hour or so and got a 32"" double. however, the main body of the lake is flat, shallow (3-5 ft) and featureless with extensive weed beds that restrict fishing significantly. so the river areas are about the only fishable areas - but the river areas are pretty significant and there's a portage upstream potential. the cabin is also very small - even for two people. this is definitly a moose hunting lake/cabin and would be good for maybe a 3 day fishing trip - but not a longer one. but - for a one day fly in, it's a real winner. later, phish"

Anything you could give to help would be great. I hope we do as good as you did this sounds asome."
