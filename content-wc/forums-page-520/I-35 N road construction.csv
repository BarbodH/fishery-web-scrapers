1224809,IaDave,2010-08-03 15:45:00,476,How much road construction is there from Iowa to Intl Falls on I35? I know last year was bad just north of the cities.
1224826,Hump,2010-08-03 16:48:00,578,"If I remember correctly, it is around Owatonna, south of the cities that was the bugger. When we came back last Friday, around 3 o'clock, northbound traffic was at a standstill for probably 8 miles. there maybe a little north also. From Cloquet to IF is is good, watch your speed."
1224886,Fishin Fun,2010-08-03 20:00:00,218,I live in Owatonna and it is bad. Especially on the weekends. But otherwise I think it should be ok all the way to I-Falls. I went to Canada in mid July and it was fine.
1224909,dutchboy,2010-08-03 21:32:00,5717,"Starting Monday, I-35 from Moose Lake to Black Bear Casino exit is reduced to one lane each way."
1224946,flntknp17,2010-08-04 05:04:00,151,There has been quite a bit going on between about Ellsworth and HWY 20 in Iowa (north of Ames) all summer. They have the whole north-bound lane taken out and it is one lane each way for 7-10 miles if I remember right.Matt
1224956,stinkycat,2010-08-04 06:04:00,2018,I 35 in Duluth is still a mess!
1225773,MorganMan,2010-08-07 14:14:00,341,"Dutchboy......isn't that stretch about 20 miles? I was through there last week and there were a couple spots down to one lane and looked like they were preparing for something more, but that is a long way?? The construction south of Owatonna is a bear if you hit it wrong.....cars actually stopped on the interstate."
1226273,dutchboy,2010-08-09 12:55:00,5717,It's about 10 miles total I guess. Last night (Sunday) about 6pm it was backed up 2 MILES before the bottleneck when going South. By my estimate it took me between 45 minutes and an hour more then normal. I'm sure it will get better once school starts and vacations end. Those coming from Canada to the Twin Cities may want to consider Hwy. 169.
1226704,rather-be-fishin,2010-08-10 19:03:00,429,"If your going I35 from Iowa to Int'l Falls you won't go through Duluth so that construction won't affect you. However, just today they started a short stretch of construction on HWY 53 north of Cotton for a few miles maybe 15 or so where it goes down to one lane....."
1226745,joeman79,2010-08-10 20:44:00,417,"We made the mistake of going home on 29 and omg there was so much construction in the dakotas, it will be a couple years before that project is even close to being completed the way it looked to me. 35 was a breeze compared to 29. And 502 was good on the way up and we took I think it was 72 on the way home. NEVER AGAIN. tons of slow cars and winding hilly road. and was 84 miles farther to boot."
