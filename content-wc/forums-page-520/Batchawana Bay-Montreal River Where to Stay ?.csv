We are probably going to stay one night in Batchawana Bay/Montreal River area. I have found a few places to stay but am looking for feedback from those of you that have stayed in the area. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated ! BOB"

Mainly going this way for change of scenery. Usually going throught Upper Peninsula Michigan, Wisconsin, than Minnesota. BOB"
