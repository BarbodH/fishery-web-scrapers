1226268,Stripehunter,2010-08-09 12:28:00,577,"I'm in the final planning stage of a caribou hunt in Northern Quebec in 3 weeks. If things go well, I will have lots of time to fish. Fishing is secondary though, and I have little space and weight to devote to it. Targets will be Lake trout, big brookies, and pike. I'm taking a 6'6"" medium action spinning rod loaded with 15lb braid over a mono backer. Will naturally be using a long fluoro leader. Will probably be fishing from shore all the time. No walleye up there I've heard of. I have all kinds of sizes and shapes of spoons, trolling flutter spoons, krocodiles, little cleos, kastmasters, and countless stick baits. Also have some bucktail jigs I could take as well. Just don't know exactly what to take, i'm not used to this type of fishing. Given the types and varying size of the fish, if you had 10 lures to throw from a bank into a clear canadian trout lake, what would they be? Please include sizes/weights if possible, that's my main dilema."
1226276,Guest,2010-08-09 12:58:00,0,Stripe hunter For pike I would take a 3/4 oz or one ounce five of diamonds daredevil. I would also take a buck tail with a silver or orange blade. For trout take the biggest spoon your rod can handle preferably in pearl or white pattern. Atlanta dave
1226394,5 of Diamonds,2010-08-09 19:37:00,151,"Well, a 1 ounce Eppinger Dardevle 5 of Diamonds w/ brass back would be one. A 3/16 ounce Owner jig w/ a 4"" or a 5"" Kalin or Yamamoto white grub would be a second. I'd include for a third, a Williams Wabler #70 in silver or the biggest Johnson Silver Minnow you can find (I'm thinking 1 1/8 or 1 1/4 ounce). These 3 lures I would never be anywhere in Canada w/ out.I've caught pike, lake trout, walleye and whitefish on the 5 of Diamonds. Amazing lure."
1226443,adempsey,2010-08-09 23:16:00,963,"If it were me, I'd bring exactly what 5 of Diamonds suggested as well as a Rapala silver/black X-Rap or F11. I'd probably go with a Len Thompson instead of the Eppinger though You could always throw in some Mepps Aglia spinners as well, they are really light as well."
