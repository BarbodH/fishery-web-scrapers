If interested, a full report can be found at this link...http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/i...howtopic=46006Tightlines,Bunk."
1225460,Rich B,2010-08-05 21:28:00,1081,Great report on the fishing and trip.....well worth the read. Rich
1225501,Moosebunk,2010-08-06 06:51:00,211,"Pete,Your sentiments have been echo'd before, and this is partly the reason I chose not to fly with him... even when he had the closest outfit to me and cheapest rates for me to reach Kesagami.I believe Ron had to sell simply because he was getting old.Anyways, Maurice has done and is continuing to do much work and renos to the Kesagami camp. In the infancy of his take-over, I can only imagine that he'll need to generate some revenue to continue improvements at other camps as well. The Partridge Lake Camp was simply awesome... and I've seen a few in my travels. His other camps, I'm not sure what improvements have been made to them, but you could always ask him at the shows.Bunk"

1225612,phishfearme,2010-08-06 17:12:00,1242,"i'm glad to hear that the WORST outfitter in ontario (and maybe canada) has been replaced by a real outfitter. you can do a search to find details of our group's experience with gardiner - not pretty. however, for all you NW/NC ontario buds who are used to canadian schield lake (rocks, more rocks, structure and more structure) these ""james bay lowland lakes"" can be a shock! they are shallow, flat and featureless. in kesagami, it's very difficult to find ANY water deeper than 7 ft and ALL structure is marked with bouys placed there by the lodge. these bouys are then visited by canoe after canoe from the lodge. don't get me wrong, there's pike and walleye to be had - but the fishing is TOTALLY different than in schield lakes and for such a huge lake, it can seem very small. by the way, there's spring seep holes back behind the kesagami boat stash that is EXCELLENT for cooling beers. phish"
1225673,Moosebunk,2010-08-06 23:56:00,211,"Phish...Good point. Anyone expecting clear, deep water, structured shield like lake fishing for pike... try elsewhere. Instead with Kesagami expect shallow, weed oriented pike.In my few years I guess I've been blessed. Kesagami gives me huge pike experiences through the ice and then now come summer. May through September expect top-water strikes, surface fights and sometimes aerial pike.The Attawapiskat coughs up large and strong current conditioned fish which tend to take smaller subsurface baits then run for moving water.And finally, there's Nipigon. Giants in the shield lake of all Ontario shield lakes. Watching big pike thrash from 15 feet below the boat in crystal clear rock bottom waters is every bit as equal a rush.All depends on your flavor... but I'm a neopolitan guy when it comes to pike and fishing. And these 3 Ontario fisheries provide for awesome big and plentiful pike, without Arctic Canada price tags.Now Phish... cool thing with True North... you can fly-in with them August, September or October... long after the Lodge canoes have been put away for the year. Heck... this year we had Kesagami to just the four of us... and we put a solid beating on those fun Esox's."

1226081,phishfearme,2010-08-08 19:20:00,1242,"moose - what happened to ""pets's"" response - was it zapped because he told the truth about gardiner> phish"
1226094,polaris-pete,2010-08-08 20:06:00,343,"Yes I see my post was taken off by someone. Don't quite understand their thinking as what I have said this time and before was the truth. Seems some on this forum have their own agendas.I am on a lot of forums and tell others the experiences I have had in my 37 years of fishing in Ontario and Quebec, whether good or bad. I do this thinking that others will not have to experience any unexpected problems or surprises when going on a fishing trip. I have been on this forum awhile and if someone can tell me any mis-truths I have mentioned, let me know as I am 100% sure tthey will not find any!!!!!!!! When some fishermen ask on here for any help on a certain outfitter or lodge that they have no experience with or had been to, I surely hope that we can tell them the truth before having our posts removed.Or would you like to go to a Lodge and get ripped off because someone puts a post on their experiences there, and then the post is removed.As I said before, I tell it like I see it whether good or bad.Thats what I thought the purpose of a public forum was, to help out others!"
1226429,Moosebunk,2010-08-09 21:56:00,211,"I didn't ask anyone to remove it. I believed Pete was telling his truth about Gardiner, and understood that he prefers a different type of lake than that of Kesagami.My post isn't about Gardiner Air though, it's about True North Air. And, for obvious reasons in the linked report... I like Kesagami lake.Thanks for the replies all!"
