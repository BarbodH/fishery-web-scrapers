It seemed if we had cloud cover it was twice as good. Fished mostly on Big and Little Sand. Caught some fish in the evening trollling Pickeral to Burnt. Caught most of our fish on the reefs during the day. Our boat went through four pounds of leeches and a flat of crawlers Lindy rigging with colored hooks. My biggest was a 29 incher, we had lots of fish over 25 and hundreds over 20 inches. We don't experiment much when what we are doing works. Also caught a 52"" Musky on Little Sand. Didn't catch many small mouth andthe ones we did were small, but then we did not target them. Fishing is good, best of luck, Bigiver"
