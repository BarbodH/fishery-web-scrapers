1226201,Andy Buff,2010-08-09 08:25:00,10,"We've been using the 8"" cats the last couple of years."
1226245,Peffley'sCamp,2010-08-09 10:46:00,37,"John,I would agree with Andy, the majority of our guests who fish them will be throwing the 8"" size. Big Mike will probably chime in here as I believe he fishes them regularly with great success."
1226252,Andy Buff,2010-08-09 11:01:00,10,"I've been 3 cabins down from Mike for 5 years. He's where I learned of them. Mike has an interesting theory however. He and I were talking last year and he likes to change up what he's throwing depending on what has been popular in the past. His thinking is that eventually the pike get used to seeing a certain kind of lure and may have a tendency to ignore them. There's been a lot of cats thrown for pike the last 3 years and I've had about the same luck as in years past. Last year we started throwing 4"" spoons and the bite picked up a bit. I noticed Mike was throwing a bulldog...and bringing in numbers of large fish.So, I guess long story short...I'm going see what Big Mike's putting in front of them before I make any decisions.284 hours, 34 minutes till lift off...."

1226414,walleyehawki,2010-08-09 21:05:00,21,"Andy Buff, I have a tackle box full of only Bulldawgs of every size and kind and also a bunch of Jake's. I thought about ordering the sand cats, but thought if we can't hookem with what I have then I guess we will just be on the short end. I caught a 43"" pike on a 12"" magumun bulldawg a couple of years ago at Caribou Falls on the English river and lost another one that hit it and came back above a 24"" leader and cut the line and was GONE!!Sandy & I and our friends Jean & Larry can't wait! We are hoping to be at our cabin before saturday noon."
1226484,Andy Buff,2010-08-10 07:08:00,10,"Verne,We'll be in camp before 9 on Saturday and on the water shortly after. Probably heading to the big lake right away for some eyes and spend the afternoon casting for pike somewhere. We'll hook up next week and get a game plan going.243 hours, 52 minutes"
1226499,Kevin R,2010-08-10 07:35:00,305,"Big Mike should be up north, has he been seen this week ?"
1226502,Andy Buff,2010-08-10 07:44:00,10,"Kevin,I talked to Mike last week. He's there now, back for a few then back on the 21st."
