1226327,Whopper,2010-08-09 15:20:00,340,"Well now I will chime in here, if I'm not mistaken Connie is talking about me, I had reservations on just how many small walleyes one person could possibly catch until the walleye opener of 2009. If someone would have told me in advance what actually happen would in fact happen I wouldn't have believed them. The catching was so crazy that my boat partner and I were almost in tears from laughter. I had it down to a science, fish were holding/moving through a current area in about 5 to 6 foot of water, at first I was casting a jig with twister tail about twenty feet from the boat a fish would be on before it hit the bottom, it got to the point where they were hitting my jig on a fast three count. I've been on numerous flyins and had a few 100 fish days but nothing like the first couple of hours that day, it was down right sick. As Golden Eagle has mention the only time the bite would slow was because the big pike had found what we were picking at and my partner was lucky enough land some massive pike and I caught a few respectable mid 30's. I got lazy about changing a worn out twister tail and happen to throw a bare jig only to find a few suicidal walleye eager to entertain us. All fish caught were small males between 13 and 15 inches, dinner could be caught in two cast and yes they were quite tasty. drlee the weather was miserable cold and the day before we had witnessed half the lake was still ice covered on our flight in. bob oh I have followed your Lake Erie reports and although I fish the same waters you do I don't enjoy your success"
1226350,eyewitness,2010-08-09 16:40:00,680,"We used to get questioned all the time about 100+ fish days on lac Seul......We started carrying a clicker counter and the questions went away. In fact the funny part is that we actually forget to click the darn thing sometimes when they are really going, and you realize that your clicker is actually short of the real count.....Just returned from up there and we boated 160 or so walleyes in 2 hours between 4 of us the first evening while anchored. It is like catching sunfish and actually gets boring catching 14-17'ers..Then occasionally we get the 20+ incher and it is all worth going through the #'s.......... In 15-16 FOW over the side of the boat you can land 2-3 fish a minute when they are really going. it takes a couple secs for your jig to go down and land in a hungry mouth and about 15 seconds to reel em up and toss em back. If you are using plastics or don't need to rebait (we used 1/2 crawlers), it can be absolutely crazy at times, with 2-3 fish coming in the boat continuously for 1/2 hour at a time.Does it happen every time out? No. However when the conditions are right, and you are on the spot on the spot, it can be almost stupid......and that's why we go......lol"

1226529,fishman10,2010-08-10 09:09:00,226,no problem getting those numbers on lac suel. doesnt happen all the time but no big deal on lac.
1226536,kgeary,2010-08-10 09:31:00,88,"I hesitated on this one but then thought Oh Heck I don't want Golden Eagle out there on his own. Hundred walleye days? Absolutely, in fact they are quite common. I've enjoyed hundreds of them on dozens of different lakes. It is just this simple. ""first rule of fishing- go where the fish are"" (my signature hasn't changed) I wonder why a person would doubt they exist rather than go out and enjoy one. In spring? definitely, In Junes windswept bays? absolutley, In July and August on the humps? of course. In September in 4-6 feet of water? Yes yes yes. One hundred fish in an hour? yes definitely. I can recall many days with well over 300 fish. And I'm not smoking anything or going on the walleye trail. It really doesn't matter if anyone believes golden eagle. (but you should because he knows what he is talking about- 30 years averaging 3 trips per year - you do the math) It doesn't matter if anyone believes me. The point is you don't have to be a pro to catch lots of walleye-just ""go where the fish are"" The lake, the spot, the spot on the spot. I'm sure there are dozens of people in the area that can confirm that they have also enjoyed 100 fish days. When I take my family out if we don't catch 3 fish in the first 20 minutes they are asking what's wrong. Believe me they are still having fun, but they came fishing to catch fish. I'll adjust and before the hour is out we will catch 20 or 30. Last week we left at noon for shorelunch Caught enough walleye to feed 18 people, had shorelunch, swam, took a hundred family photos and were back at camp swiming and relaxing by 4pm. When I'm guiding others it is my job for them to catch fish. If it is numbers they want then numbers we will get. I've found that if we catch lots of numbers we will also get a few high 20s walleye and or a few big pike thrown in for our efforts. Now granted there are three of us in the boat. But if I didn't catch my share (33 1/3 - if my math is right) in 8 or 10 hours I'd be pretty disappointed. If my guest don't catch more than 4 or 5 walleye in an hour then I'm ""gently"" coaching them until they are also catching 30 or 40 or more per day. Ask golden Eagle about his best day pike fishing- probably came close to 100 and they weren't hammer handles. Just about 10 days ago I was out with Hayden, Dennis and Belinda Belinda was catching so many walleye she wanted to have a contest. I resisted as long as I could but finally gave in to her demands. In about 90 minutes I had caught 63 walleye most were about 17-19 inches, several were in their 20s. and one was about 28. We were fishing in 12-14 feet of water (it doesn't have to be shallow water) with a 1/8 oz orange jig tipped with a minnow or half a worm ( we ran out of both) Belinda did not have as many but that is not the point - that was not an unusual day at all. Last friday my father in law and both brother in laws went out after supper and caught well over 70 walleye in 90 minutes. Try this one. I guided a couple who kept track of every fish they caught for the past 24 years. Golden Eagle probably knows who I'm talking about. Our first week we caught over 800, later that summer we caught over 1100 The next spring and summer about the same. I don't remember the exact numbers but I'm sure he still has his little black book. Mary had never caught more than 20 fish in a day, when she broke 100 HERSELF in one day she was thrilled. Finally on one trip in mid July we caught over 500 the first day and over 2400 in the week. They fished with me for a few more years and we reached 1800 a few times but he still wanted to beat the 2400 week. 2452 was the exact number if my memory serves me. Do we catch 100 fish everyday? Of course not. But on days we spend walleye fishing I'd say 100 is the rule not the exception. I dont' keep a journal, but I do have a memory and I can count. Throughout the day the action will rise and subside but if it gets too slow for too long we just move ""to where the fish are"". On another note - it is very seldom I catch a fish that's been caught more than once. I automatically check every fish to see if it has any previous hook marks. Also I've done a lot of underwater filming and if you can catch 10% of the fish in an area you are doing very very well and better than 99% of the anglers out there."
1226555,Golden Eagle,2010-08-10 10:32:00,2642,"I didn't break down our catch day by day, but I recall three of us boating well over a ton of pike in the three day period of May 18, 19 & 20, 2004. A new moon on the 19th helped the bite. It seemed that half the big pike in Ontario were holding a Suick eating contest in the back of Spring Bay during those three days."
1226632,kgeary,2010-08-10 14:55:00,88,"Funny stuffBoth the memories and the ""suick eating contest""Made me laugh out loud .If I remember correctly the original intent was to learn about deadbait fishing.that quickly went by the wayside.Even the bobber fisherman nearby couldn't believe it.Heard them talking ""I guess all that stuff on TV wasn't B.S. after all"""
1226743,joeman79,2010-08-10 20:37:00,417,"Just got back from Lac Seul and had 1 true 100 fish day and 2 other really good days and 2 slow days. It was unbelieveable how many cigar walleye we caught, walleye under 10 inches. Hundreds and hundreds in our group of 9. Everytime we would get into them we would move and they would be in about 1 out 3 spots. Little bit of a pain but should be great in a few years. has anyone else had the same expierence this summer with all the little fish?"
1225972,v-bay gord,2010-08-08 11:09:00,3168,"[QUOTE I guess the number of fish per day is really relative to what you are fishing for and the amount of fun you have doing it[/QUOTE] Tackleman is right on, in my opinion."
1225984,orchard frank,2010-08-08 12:04:00,1900,"The longer we went to Lac Seul, our fish count actually went down. We did have longer shore lunch breaks, started a little later, quit a little sooner, drove at a more leisurely pace. Also spent time exploring areas and looking for new spots. It wasn't unusual for my wife to stretch out in the bow with a lifejacket pillow, and take a nap after lunch!! Numbers really went down then, had to carry the load by myself. Great days either way."
1226019,bob oh,2010-08-08 15:48:00,3936,"I have a plague on my dash that I believe applies here: ""All fishermen are lairs except you and me and I'm beginning to wonder about YOU!"""
1226022,MSUICEMAN,2010-08-08 15:56:00,458,50 fish per hour is hmmm.... 60 minutes divided by 50 fish... thats 1.2 minutes per fish.... not .83 (not too sure where you're getting that).
1226033,Crede,2010-08-08 16:11:00,134,50 fish per hour = 1 fish per 1.2 minutes = 0.83 fish per minute.
1226042,2746,2010-08-08 16:39:00,3206,"Guess it all doesn't make much difference but in 40 years of fishing Canada and 60-70 trips with lots of different guys we have NEVER counted fish. Don't recall ever describing a trip or even a day of fishing in those terms. We've certainly had spells of fast action that if sustained for 8 hours might have turned into 100 or 200 fish days but that's certainly not why I go. (we've also had long periods without fish and spend the time shooting the bull) Every trip I've taken has been a good one and it's the scenery, Eagles, Moose, Bear, shore lunches, friends and those unforgettable screw ups or funny mishaps that mark each trip. From a personal standpoint, any lodge describing themselves in terms of fish per day or asking their guests to keep track for marketing purpose would be a bit suspect.....but that's just me."
1226049,MSUICEMAN,2010-08-08 17:06:00,458,"correct, which is not the same as one fish every .83 minutes."
1226055,drlee,2010-08-08 17:28:00,409,"Do I get a pass since I had finished two black russians (one part kahlua, 2 parts vodka...lots of ice) when I did the math? Oops. It would certainly be a fish every 1.2 minutes. I divided 50 by 60 rather than 60 by 50. Sorry. This was, after all, all in good fun. I don't even count fish."
1226178,MSUICEMAN,2010-08-09 07:16:00,458,"yes on a pass, no big deal. i have had 100 fish days, both in ontario and michigan. however, they aren't a regular occurence (except for one lake in ontario) and by no means were they in an hour.... when i fish, its usually for the entire day minus a shore lunch or break for lunch."
1226189,nitrodude,2010-08-09 07:38:00,60,"We go for a great time and catching lots of fish. I know we've had our share of 100+ fish days, but we judge our trip by the fun we've had in the most gorgeous scenery and comradery. The fishing is fantastic so we don't try to relegate it to an accounting task, but truly enjoy the availability through excellent wildlife management. We do take note of the over 30""-er's though!"
1225771,drlee,2010-08-07 13:56:00,409,"I have been reading the messages related to a popular drive in camp near Red Lake. I have also heard many stories about 100 fish days. Just some thoughts... Went fishing. Stayed our for 10 hours. Re-baited, changed lures, lost some jigs and re-tied, ate a couple of sandwiches, moved around a bit on the lake, watched a moose, took awhile to find a reef I always seem to have trouble finding, took the boat ride back to camp. Probably fished 8 hours in total. Caught 100 fish. Divided by 8 hours that is 12.5 fish per hour. That is a fish every 4.8 minutes. For 8 solid hours. Wow. There were 6 people in my group. We fished 6 days and caught 2000 fish. That is 333 fish per day, or 55 fish per day, per person, for 7 fish every hour, or a fish every 8.6 minutes for each person, each of six days, for 48 solid hours over the week. Wow. Weather must have been pretty good. Yeah, I have had a rare 100 fish day over the years. But, I'm just sayin'..."
1225828,Golden Eagle,2010-08-07 19:02:00,2642,"Had two doubters with me in May 2009. Heard them say they'd see how big of a liar I was. Said they'd count fish to see if they could catch 100. Between them they caught over 100 in the first hour, lost count after that and then went quiet. It's no big deal if you go where the fish are."
1225841,drlee,2010-08-07 19:49:00,409,"2 guys, 50 fish each during a one hour span = one fish every .83 minutes per person. Or, two fish every .83 minutes for two guys. OK. But, no big deal? I think I said that 100 fish days are possible (but rare). You should go on the walleye trail and win thousands of dollars!!! Can I go fishing with you?"
1225844,MSUICEMAN,2010-08-07 20:12:00,458,i do think your math is a little bit off.....

1225855,Planocat,2010-08-07 20:35:00,473,Actually his math is better than yours...........would be curious to see what figure you come up with. .83 looks pretty good to me to reach 50 per hour but then I only get 7mpg in the motorhome!
1225860,octanehi5,2010-08-07 21:05:00,1104,"We have had 200 fish in a day with two guys in a boat, but your saying you caught a fish every minuit thats imposible,need to hook the fish reel it in unhook the fish, chech and bait hook,cast out hook another fish and go though it all again. it took me more than that time to just write this?? I want some of what your smokin, In 8hrs you could have 800 fish for two guys, like someone said you need to go on the pro tour"
1225904,Golden Eagle,2010-08-08 06:58:00,2642,"Hey guys, it's no big deal to me, but my two friends are not liars. One of them is a regular on this forum, but I doubt he posts on this thread. Getting into a good bite with post spawn males is a reality. Just go with a grub on your jig and you'll get bit about 2 or 3 feet from the bottom. Lose the grub, no problem, you'll still get fish with a bare jig. Fishing in shallow water increases your catch count. Only problem is that the males are 13"", 14"" & 15"". Later in the week you'll get into bigger fish. Action will continue to be fast when you're in the right location. When the bite slows down, get ready for one of the big pike that have also found the walleyes. Pounding little walleyes for more than an hour or so can become a bit boring. Have you ever tried the shallow, wind blown part of a lake a day or two after a mayfly hatch? Again, your jig won't touch bottom. Walleyes find mayflies. Whitefish find mayflies. Big pike find both walleyes and whitefish."
1225945,guidedfishing,2010-08-08 09:07:00,531,"Agreed 100 fish ""walleye"" DAYS happen, but its not a regular day ever day all summer long. So sure I believe anyone who tells me they had a 100 fish day. I also recognize they are telling me because it does not happen that often for them. Even as fisherman we have to keep our stories somewhat believeable ""do we?"". In 30 years of going to Ontario drive in lakes usually anywhere from from 2 - 5 major trips a year there has been my fair share of 100 fish ""days"". In all that I remember two times, once where I caught 22 quality walleyes in 22 casts, and once where my fishing partner and I caught just over 70 quality walleyes (between the two of us) in 90 mins of fishing When someone tells us they caught 100 ""fish"" in an hour well were still fisherman anyway. P.S. it took me just over 45mins to catch 22 in a row, but then again I was not trying to go fast, and I was using live bait and did have to put a new leech on from time to time. I'm pretty happy with an afternoon of fishing where I pick up 35 fish. Most of us fisherman don't count or keep track of time very well. I think most of us fish to escape time and counting.. Just keep track of the number of cast you make in a day. You may be surprised just how few it really is... A quality walleye for me is 15"" so the bar is not set very high there. good luck GF"
1225970,tackleman,2010-08-08 10:51:00,444,"anytime you get a fish is a great time, somedays I can go out for an hour and get 12 (that's one every 5 minutes) other days I can get 1 an hour. it's all about the ability to get out and unwind and enjoy the lake.last week I was at a camp on gullrock and talked to some guests who were packing up to go home. I asked how they did, they were quite pleased with the trip and said they even got a 40 inch musky and showed me the picture of the lucky guy and his fish. Now I have lived on gullrock for 20 years and have ""possibly"" caught 2 muskies in this time. I say possibly because they were only about 20 inches long and hadn't developed into a full blown musky pattern that is easily recognizable. the guest toldme they don't fish walleye, just northern and spend all day casting in the weedbeds. this guy said one day he caught 8 pike and that was his best day. to me this would appear to be a complete waste of time and effort, but as a walleye fisherman I don't get off on chasing northerns. to him it was a fabulous trip and he is counting the days to come back next year.so I guess the number of fish per day is really relative to what you are fishing for and the amount of fun you have doing it"
