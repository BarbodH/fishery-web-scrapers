1226243,tyeeguy,2010-08-09 10:29:00,111,"I thought I would pass along my experience crossing back into the US this past Saturday. I was entering through International Falls/Fort Francis with the rest of the Saturday cabin change people. I got in line 10:15am and was at the ""1.5 hours to the boarder"" sign. It did take all that to get to the check point. I noticed the truck/boat in front of me pull up to the checkin and I saw one of the agents climb into the boat and look it over. I had not seen that in the 20 some years I have been crossing the border. He then opened the back of the truck and looked in a few boxes. When I pulled in I noticed the guy was doing the same to me. After answering the questions as best I could they told me to pull into he check area. A very nice agent came over and explained that he was checking for produce and other illegal items. He again asked if I had any citrus, fruits and vegetables. At this point I thought long and hard and said I did not buy anything like that in Canada, everything I had I brought up with me. He said it didn't matter and I could not bring them back across the border. I asked if there was a list of prohibited items and he said the list changes too often so they don't publish one. So I gave the man the 1/4 of a lemon I had sliced up for shore lunches (sitting on top of the cooler in the back of of the truck) and the two oranges I had and went on my way. Next time the agent said I should just leave that stuff in Canada and not try to bring it back. The apples and the potatoes were ok since they were still in the bags that said USA on them. Overall, they were very nice and polite. It does remind me of the Ontario fishing regs. When you have a book of regulations that is 100 pages 8X11 in size - it is almost impossible to be 100% compliant, all you can do is to try your best. I hope this helps someone else have a better understanding of what not to take back into the US."
1226262,tv4fish,2010-08-09 11:46:00,2694,"tyeeguy: Maybe you should consider yourself lucky? It seems they could have looked a lot ""harder"" than what they did ! My group has never been ""searched"", but we have seen other vehicles literally ""torn apart"" when they have been searched (we always assumed they were looking primarily for drugs?)."
1226279,tyeeguy,2010-08-09 13:03:00,111,"Oh no doubt I could have had all my stuff laid out on the ground and been held up against the wall. But in 20 some years I have never been pulled over before. I try to be within the law but when I can't find out what the rules are, I find it especially hard to follow them. I could not believe the agent said they had no information to hand me that said what I was not in compliance with. I just wanted to make other travelers aware that citrus, fruits and vegetables (raw) are not allowed across the border eventhough they were bought in the US.It is totally my ignorance that caused me to be in that situation."
1226299,camp chef,2010-08-09 13:55:00,915,Potatoes?.......did someone say potatoes?
1226329,Guest,2010-08-09 15:23:00,0,You tryin to start somethin with that potatoes comment?
1226524,tv4fish,2010-08-10 08:42:00,2694,Just wondering if he wasn't referring to a few years back when potatoes were banned from being brought INTO Canada. I remember that year well -- stack of potatoes on the U.S. side of the border --- and a lot of potatoes sold IN Canada.
1226535,cruiseforever,2010-08-10 09:29:00,177,This has been the law for many years. When ever I come off a cruiseship there is always a pile of fruit on the way off.
1226565,tyeeguy,2010-08-10 11:02:00,111,"I thought at the time the potatoes comment was odd (they are ok since they are in a bag that says USA on it) but I didn't pursue it since I didn't want to make any trouble. I now realize the fruits cannot come across the border but I was under the wrong impression that since I bought them in the US I could bring them back. Again, I am just mentioning my experience crossing the border this year. They seem to have stepped up the inspections which should only make me sleep better at night."
1226679,micropterus,2010-08-10 17:27:00,450,It's potato
