1226997,polaris-pete,2010-08-11 17:55:00,343,"I got some of these Shadski crankbaits and they did better than my partners Rapalas did. Unbeliveable colors! The perch color holding it next to the boat before letting out line, looks exactly like a real perch. They dive to about 15-20 ft and held up really well considering all the walleyes we caught and the bothersome Northerns."

1225950,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2010-08-08 09:27:00,629,"I have been fortunate since retiring in '01 to have a summer facility on the South shore of LOW & in those summers that last from May to Oct. I have found when fishing the Ontario Islands, that pulling Rapala crank baits in 7 to 15 ft. of water around various Islands thatI have been able to catch every species that the lake supports. My fleet of plugs revolve around #7 & #9 ""TailDancers"", ""Shad Raps"" & ""Jointed"" #7 & 9's. I have found the new ""TDD #7 & 9's"" to be very versitle whenfishing around the Islands this year. If you were to choose this style of fishing, I recommend using a 9"" or 12"" leader for 2 reasons. The toothy boys like the plugs & it helps prevent line fray from dragging over the rocksaround the islands. Its not the easiest style, but once you get the hang of it, it is a great way to cover ground & have the opportunity to catch Muskie, N. Pike, Walleye, Smallmouth, Sauger, Perch & an occasional Crappie. When on the US side of the lake I have found the reefs to produce the best ""Big"" fish. On that structure I will use a 1&1/2 to 2 once bottom bouncer with a ""Gold"" hammered or solid bladed worm harness & a crawler. This past 2 weeks on the ""Rocks"" has produced 29&1/2,28's, 0n down to the perfect ""eaters"" of 16 to 19"". You have to consider that LOW is a ""Tea "" stained water. My second choice for a ""Spinner"" rig would be solid or hamered silver harness.Both styles require moving to keep the spinner moving & the plugs swimming. Plugs @ 2.5 to 3.0mph & spinners 0.6 to 1.0. You want the bottom bouncers to be jigged as your moving & as straight up & down as possible. Speed will dictate your success. Also jig your plugs. By that I mean pull the plug forward with your rod as your trolling, this makes the plug dart & slow down until the line tightens. You will be surprised how many strickes this will trigger vs just constantly trolling @ a constant speed. Good Luck/Set the Hook"
1225954,guidedfishing,2010-08-08 09:38:00,531,"walleye: For crank baits I like to fan cast an old reliable perch colored walley diver, or a size 10 firetiger or blue husky jerk. If we troll we'll run husky jerks on long lines or off planer boards. (you can end up dealing with to many pike as well) For jigs an assortment of 1/8 to 1/4 ounce. mostly 1/8 ounce. with my primary colors in this order. Orange, Gold, Chartreuse, White. I mostly tip my jigs with a 4in purple or red ring worm that has a pearl or white tail. You can cut these down to 2 - 3 inches depending on the bit. They work better than gulp for me, are a lot less expensive, and a lot less messy. Slip bobber, I usual tie a 1/16 ounce jig under the slip bobber this can really be hot if you have a little ripple or chop on the water. This is pretty much a live bait affair with minnows or leeches. I'll also put a couple small color beads just above the hook or jig. Assortment of 1.5 to 3 ounce bottom bouncers, I rig up rig up multiple versions of 36in crawler and minnow harnesses with an assortment of orange, gold, red, yellow, green beads and small floats. Some with small gold, silver, orange or yellow blades. (this is go to for summer and early fall walleyes) You can cover a lot of water and if you really hit a hot spot you can always pull off and work it over with jigs and slip bobbers. Pike, Just about any crank bait, husky jerk, spinner or spoon will work. My son has an assortment of 5 of diamonds daredevils that he can not get in the boat without the darn things. Whatever. He loves throw the darn things and he always catches plenty of pike and walleyes on them. when the pike are really thumping well remove the trebles and put a single hook on the spoons and even take the front treble off on the crank bait just to make it easier to get them off."
1226048,REG,2010-08-08 17:05:00,445,"Walleye - Jig. With a minnow. Or if they're biting good, casting with just a twister tail body.Northern - gold silver minnow with spinner bait trailer or a Williams wobbler (or the above jig on the Walleye light action rod)."

1226185,nitrodude,2010-08-09 07:31:00,60,"For the time that I'm up on LS (late June to early July), my favorite lures are a 3"" Berkley Power Grub in various colors on a 3/8oz. jighead and a 7-10' diving crank, like a Tail Dancer, Shad Rap or similar on windy banks."
