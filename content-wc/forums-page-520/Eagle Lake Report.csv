This is the 9th year our group has been there and the fishing seems to get better every year. Walleyes were everywhere,we almost got tired of catching them. The weather was great highs around 80 with partly sunny skies man it was fun. Already planning next years trip."
1226907,dave10,2010-08-11 12:56:00,342,"Good to hear of your success. We stayed at Evergreen Lodge on Eagle a few weeks ago (around the corner from Temple Bay - that's where we usually go, but they were full that week). We had a great week. The consensus from people I talked to at both lodges is that Eagle has been getting better and better over the past five to ten years, and that has been our experience as well. Most attribute it to the slot size limits, but who knows. We did try Lac Seul one year (a/k/a ""the walleye factory"") and it was all that it was cracked up to be. 100 fish in the boat by noon, etc etc. We also stayed at Evergreen Lodge there in Ear Falls and had a great time. However, we missed the variety of Eagle. I do get the sense that among walleye purists, Eagle is still pretty far down the list. Some of that may be due to Eagle Lake congestion, but from the reports I'm reading, Lac Seul is catching up on that score. Dave"

Dave[/quote]We fish Gullrock, Lac Seul and Eagle and I think your right about the reputation but your also right about the improvement Eagle's made in walleye numbers and size over the last 15 years. It's a prettier lake to fish than nearly any I've been on and I like all the Islands and variety of shore line. (turn off your GPS and see how long it takes to get lost ) As far as a lake to visit and experience it's my favorite and.....we always catch lots of walleye and good numbers of large ones. As a real plus, there is always that chance of hooking on to a large Musky! We've done that a couple of times and it leaves you breathless.....like what in the world just happened."

Vgord hook me up!"
1226959,Skyraptor,2010-08-11 15:49:00,291,Does Century Lodge still exist on Eagle Lake?
1227104,v-bay gord,2010-08-12 06:47:00,3168,"Fishinnut........humps would be a good starting point (there are plenty to choose from). Use your locator to zero in on fish and depths. Lately I have found them at the 25 foot range. Using a minnow on a Lindy rig has worked better for me than a jig presentation. That being said, all the other methods and bait you list might work for you as well. We have had some warm weather and surface temps have gone up to about the 75 degree mark......the shallow water bite seems to have declined accordingly, but I would not overlook it should conditions warrant it. Century Lodge is located in Osbourne Bay. Nice to hear some positive comments on Eagle Lake. The variety and quality of fishing is there, and the scenery is fantastic. I would say the trophy potential (walleye over 30 inches) compares to any lake out there.......dare I say even better than most!"
1227188,2746,2010-08-12 10:31:00,3206,"I mentioned earlier the outside chance of hooking a musky. The last time that happened to us we were staying at V Gord's and trolling some cranks not far from his camp. One of the fellows in my boat (a relative newbie) hooked something and it just took off. fight lasted maybe a minute and then broke off. He was left sitting in the boat, hands trembling, his cigar dropping from his mouth (on my carpet!) saying ""what the h*** was that!"" Talked about it for the rest of the week and at least once on every trip he's taken since. Great fun and the experiences fishing trips are made of."
