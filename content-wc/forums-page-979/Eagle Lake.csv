517327,Guest,2002-02-19 07:10:00,0,I'm going to go to Canada in the fall and I'm looking for a place go. I've been looking at a place called Andy Myer's Lodge on Eagle lake in Ontario. It's $489.00 a guy but that includes renting a boat. (my boat is to small for the bigger lakes up there) I'm wondering if anyone has been up there and knows if its a good deal and if its a nice place. The only other place I've been in Canada is Arrowhead Resort. Thanks in advance.Ben

Since they bought a place on the other side of the lake I have lost track of who runs it. It was an ok place. Not bad and you will have a good time. The only drawback is that you have to travel a ways to get to the better spots on Eagle. The water in that section of the lake is shallower,clearer and weedier so you will catch mostly pike and smaller musky. Other lodges such as Evergreen, TempleBay and Fin and Feather are closer to the better fishing spots of the lake. Some good things is that section of the lake is a lot more wind protected, and the elements won't ruin your day like they do on the other side of the lake. It's also less crowded over there, Lake Trout are nearby and Andy Myers will take you to other lakes in the area. If you decide to go with Andy Myers opt for the day trip to Corner Lake. HUGE muskies and pike in that lake and beautiful scenery."
517329,Guest,2002-02-19 18:31:00,0,"Hey Ben. I too am going to Eagle lake this year. I spent a lot of time at all the sport show's and muskie show's talking with many different resorts. I choose to go to Cedar Point Lodge which is very close to Andy Myers. Nothing against Andy Myers. I met and spoke with Herbie the owner and it sounds like he runs a nice camp. But, I'm taking my wife with me and Andy's just seemed a little testosterone loaded to be taking my wife there. If I was going with the boys it would be my choice. It sounds like herbies got them Big muskies all figured out. Cedar Points web page is www.cedarpointlodge.comWe're taking our own boat so we're paying 300 per person housekeeping. The owners Pat and Sharon are very nice people. Some nice things about there camp are as soon as you get there, they jump in the boat with ya and give you a tour and show you all the hots spots right off the bat. If ya still want a guide, their 100 a day. They have a nice lodge with bar, all the usual stuff. There's also many other resorts in that area. If you go to www.heartland.on.cayou can link to tons of resorts. Hope this helps.Ed Brown"
517330,ohdaddy,2002-02-19 20:56:00,21,"I have fished on Eagle Lake (the dead sea?) for 21 years. I have not fished the lake in the last 9( things may have improved but not sure). We moved north to Sioux Lookout and Andersons lodge. It has to be the finest lodge in the area. Although you will be paying more for your trip, the bad part about fishing Sioux lookout waters which include Lac Seul, Minnitaki, Pelican, Big and Little Vermillion lakes(all Accessable by water) is that you have to fish hard find any keeper Walleye's. (in my oppinion 16""-18"" for eating but we always manage) they are all 19""-28"" (2lbs.-8lbs.) The fishing is awesome. I caught a 6 lb.+ walleye every day I have fished up there which equates to about 50+ walleyes over 6 lbs. You will never catch that kind of fish on Eagle. If you decide to fish Eagle lake, make sure to fish the east side.(mukluc bay, spring bay, bear narrows etc). good luck and have fun. One final note, If your going after trophy musky, then Eagle is your lake. (fish for them around Osbourn bay)Don't get me wrong, I'll always love this lake and never forget the wonderful fishing we had there. It just has too much boat traffic and fishing pressure. Which caused a decrease in quality fish. I believe the DNR has instituted a slot size which may have improved the fishing.OhDaddy"

Eagle is not by any means a lake for trophy sized walleyes. More of a numbers lake for them, you will catch lots of 'em on the east side if you fish in the spring locations like you mentioned above. Sounds like we fish the same springtime honeyholes LOL! Ever try around Froghead Bay!?They've put major restrictions on the lake over the walleyes(and smallmouth) the past few seasons to try and increase the numbers of larger fish and to protect the spawners. Last I remember the slot limits for walleyes was between 18 and 24 inches, and only 1 over 24."
517332,Guest,2002-02-20 21:00:00,0,"Ben:If your after trophy musky the Andy Myer's is your lodge, steve runs a first class lodge, alittle higher price but the amount of information you will get is worth the few extra bucks. By no means is Eagle a numbers lake, but I will garauntee you will see plenty of 50""+ fish during your stay. I would definitely book one day on a action lake, last year the wife, a fried, and me got blown off the big lake, head to Indian, 4 hours 10 fish 36-42"" and lost 6 more.Good luck Troyz"
517333,Piscatorian,2002-02-23 23:23:00,12,"Unless your after big muskies, this might be the most overrated lake in the province. The north end is the worst. When I was there we has our best fishing when we pulled out and went over to Cedar."
517334,Guest,2002-02-25 12:49:00,0,Thanks for all the info. I've decided to go back to Arrowhead on Crooked Pine Lake. --Ben
