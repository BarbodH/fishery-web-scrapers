517418,Guest,2002-02-24 13:49:00,0,"With the exchange rate at what it is I would say any whiskey is a good deal,unless you want it for nothing."
517407,Guest,2002-02-19 14:47:00,0,"Being that the best whisky in the world comes from north of the border, I was wondering if there is such a thing as getting a good deal during our visit?"
517408,Reels,2002-02-19 15:33:00,2876,I would think the dutie free store might be your best bet.<{{}}><
517410,Guest,2002-02-19 16:20:00,0,Gibsons Rye is 12 years old and the best there is. At around $35 Can for 1.14 litres it is a bargain. Nector of the Canadian Walleye Gods. There are no bargains with booze in Canada. Duty free can be just as pricy as the Government outlets.
517409,manitobawalleye,2002-02-19 16:32:00,885,yes duty free store at the border would be your cheapest...up here it is all regulated by govt. so we don't get the sales that you seem to....
517411,Guest,2002-02-19 17:48:00,0,Last Aug I crossed at Pidgon River. A 40 of Dewers Scotch whisky was 17.95. Will be crossing at Int. Falls this Aug. Do they have anything like that there? I surely hope so.
517412,Guest,2002-02-20 06:48:00,0,How much is duty on a case of beer?
517413,rollie,2002-02-23 03:09:00,4,"We didn't check on the price of beer. I do know that we paid 36 Canadian for it in camp. I know that it was a lot, but it was there and it was cold and it wasn't Bud."
517414,Tom,2002-02-23 09:12:00,1063,Anyone know the hours of the duty free at Intl Falls?
517415,Bryan,2002-02-23 11:52:00,244,Exchange rate: $1.00US = $1.61CanNow thats a good deal.
517416,Guest,2002-02-23 15:24:00,0,I strongly urge any conissiuers of fine canadian whiskey to try PURE GOLD by KR Estate distillery its smooth like crown royal and less $$ .
