517222,TomPGrouse,2002-02-15 10:22:00,124,After a lot of research (thanks for the opinions) I am taking my 15 year old son on a fly-in (first time fly-in) to White Clay Lake. We are using Ogoki Frontier. We would appreciate any trip reports or advice or opinions concerning Ogoki and White Clay.Thanks
517223,Snagmaster,2002-02-17 10:32:00,10,"You made a good choice with Ogoki Frontier. Paul will give you all the advice you need when you arrive, including marking your lake map with all the hotspots. White Clay is a big piece of water with several other camps and great fishing. We were at Chipchase last Sept., Kathleen next. Have fun, and be careful out there.Larry"
