517625,Guest,2002-02-26 15:43:00,0,Anyone fish Pakaskan Lake Near Grahm Ontario last year? I used to fish a lot about 10 yrs ago. I went back about 3 yrs ago a still did well. Stayed at the lodge there. There is a new guy running it who is a total clown. Stays stoned on dope most of the time. Anyway had a good time catching fish and stayed out on the water most of the day. Anyone fish Muskeg lake near Raith? I used to catch a hunderd northens a day there 10 yrs ago. Last time I was there it was closed to fishing. Just curious. Can't wait to go back!
