517447,Guest,2002-02-20 20:51:00,0,"Richard:I have been going 3 years running, I plan on stay there every year. I am primarily musky fishing, I usualy fly in and walleye/northern fish one day. Each day on the water there I am confident that I have a chance a true world class fish. The cabins are rustic but nice, and Steve will do everything in his power to have you on fish and make your stay one to remeber. I would highly recommend it, and definitely has unlimited option of fishing oportunities.Good luckTroyz"

517449,Guest,2002-02-21 12:02:00,0,You will likely get the same story from most people who have visited the Herbecks at this fishing camp. Great people and hospitality and it is a bit on the rustic side as another poster noted. The perioic seminars/briefings at the lodge are very interesting and he's a very experienced fisherman who will try to put you on the fish. We had him as a guide one day and it was a great experience.

As one guy here said, the portage lakes were better, but the fish were small. Hopefully the slot limits have helped the fishing."
