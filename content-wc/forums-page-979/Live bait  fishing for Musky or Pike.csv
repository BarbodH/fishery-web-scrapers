517596,Guest,2002-02-26 12:41:00,0,"It is legal to fish with live bait for Musky and Pike in Ontario - it is only illegal to use live bait in Quebec.Personally I like to hook them behind the dorsal - not too deep so they can still swim freely, this seems to work really well."
517597,HLLGuide,2002-02-26 13:33:00,10,I believe it is illegal to use perch in Ont. I won't use live bait for muskies or pike. I've seen this kill too many big fish. Plus it is not as sporting!Guide

I, however, have never had the pleasure of catching anything on one of them. We only throw them out (with a huge bobber) once or twice on each trip.lobo"
