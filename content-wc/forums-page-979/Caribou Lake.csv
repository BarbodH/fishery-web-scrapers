517508,Guest,2002-02-24 08:29:00,0,My husband wants to take me to Caribou Lake this summer. I don't know anything about this area. Should I encourage him to find another location or be happy he's taking me here?
517509,Guest,2002-02-24 16:51:00,0,"You might want to look into the fishing species and quality and accompanying accomodation. Also, look at what other activities might be available at this place. It is nice to see a lady enjoying the outdoors.Delighted"

517512,Guest,2002-02-26 02:46:00,0,Ontario
517513,Guest,2002-02-26 06:02:00,0,"There are a number of Caribou Lakes in Ontario, are you referring to the one in the Armstrong area of Ontario up Hwy 527?"
517514,Guest,2002-02-26 15:42:00,0,"Yes, Thumper, I believe it's the one by Armstrong. Do you know if this lake has numbers of fish or big ones? I love to feel something tug on the end of my line."
517515,Guest,2002-02-26 15:57:00,0,"It is a larger lake with Lake trout, Walleye and Pike. I have hunted the lake in the fall and icefished the lake in the spring and we did very well. There are good numbers of fish and you will do well. It is a beautiful area with a lot of wildlife. You are at the outskirts of Wabakimi Provincial Park a wilderness park. It is very popular with wilderness canoe types."
