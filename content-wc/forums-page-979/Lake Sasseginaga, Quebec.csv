517494,Guest,2002-02-23 16:50:00,0,"RETIRE55-- I also have had no luck researching the archives on the lake I was asking about in Quebec-Lake OGASCACANE.If anyone has any info which is current, I surely would appreciate it as we are booked for a week in June. Thanks. Pete"
517495,retire55,2002-02-23 17:47:00,1029,"Hi again Mike and Pete:I did both searches again after I read about the difficulties you both had. In the case of Lake Ogascanane, the search only worked if I did a search on ogascanan - 15 topics matched the search.I searched on sasseginaga and 2 topics were returned.In both cases, I'm searching from the Canada thread. I type in the keyword, check off the search archives box and click on search and in both cases got the data I was seeking. I didn't change any other search criteria. The sasseginaga thread was started 7 Jan 02. Consequently, Mike, if you can not get it through the search function, you can always scroll back through the posts and find it by date. Hope you both have better luck next time."
