517544,duffy,2002-02-24 15:47:00,49,Congrats to our canadian brothers up north. it was a great game and the better team won. I have to say I am so proud of the american team to do what they did considering that hockey is not that popular here in the US. They exemplified the american spirit with tough determination and never gave up. It would have even better if Broduer didn't rob hull to tie it up. If it went to penalty shots Richter is the best in the world at stopping breakaways just ask Pavel Bure. But he made the save and the canadians showed the world that they are the best hockey counrty in the world. All americans will celebrate with you. Trust me all americans are happy that if we could not get it we all wanted you to have it. The gold is in the right place after 50 years and you should be proud. I know what kind of monkey is off your back considering I am a ranger fan here in NJ. Keep the lakes beautiful and i will see you in the spring. Party on!!!!!!!!!Duffy

517550,Walleyefisher,2002-02-24 18:12:00,159,50 years and the NHL All Star team and you guys have finally done it. This is the first time in my life I was rooting for Modano and Hull and not Sakic and Blake. Oh well Silver rocks too. Congrats my friends in Canada and keep producing excellent hockey players. Now go Avs!
517551,manitobawalleye,2002-02-24 18:40:00,885,iamwalleye1money buys alot of things but not olympic gold....i played against brett hull growing up here in winnipeg...he had a long commute from grand forks i guess....has any american city in the nhl won more than 4 stanley cups?it would be interesting to add all the canuck cup winners against all the us cup winners and see what the total reveals...but i do love your NCAA Final 4 (a canadian invention) and your super bowl....it also looks like salt lake city did a great job and the americans did help sale and pelltier....we should be happy north america is on top...with enough walleyes for all of us....:+)
517547,Peanut,2002-02-25 08:09:00,929,"Kind of like winning the Super Bowl, except imagine that the whole country was cheering for the same team, and that team hadn't won for 50 years. In normal sporting finals (NHL, NFL, etc.) somebody's team loses, while many other fans have little emotional investment, as their team is already out. The Olympic gold is the same feeling as if your team won (everyone is saying WE won), except EVERYONE feels this way, and that's what makes it so special - it's the one sport that we define ourselves by, and everyone shares in the win.I dunno if this helps or not, it's the best I can do.derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!""On Sundays some men go to church and daydream about fishing.
