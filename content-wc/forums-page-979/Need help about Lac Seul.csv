East end of lake, 3rd week in Sept and would like some tips where to fish, baits, depths etc.I have been there before but always in the spring where the fish have been shallow and often near rivers etc. (With great results). How about Wapesi Bay that time of year? Tuktegweik?Would late August be better?Thanks for the help in advance"

The best bet at the time seemed to be a 3/4 oz wire sinker on a slide with a 4' snell to a minnow. This way it was easy to ""walk"" up and down the island edges without having to change tackle for depth. At the time, this definitely stomped jigging. The fish were pretty finicky, a long soft rod with mono was the ticket for feeling the fish without them feeling you. Beautiful place. If I went back, I'd concentrate more on the pike in the shallows, WOW!Todd"
