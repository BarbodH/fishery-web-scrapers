Kinda makes you wish that the NHL would go back to 12 or so teams and let 'em play on the big ice, huh?Great hockey game.derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!""On Sundays some men go to church and daydream about fishing. Others go fishing and think about God."""
517487,outdoor fanatic,2002-02-24 19:52:00,90,"That was one heck of a game. Hard to root for one team or another with all the great stars on the ice at any given time. But congrats to the Canadians. They came ready to play and play they did. Actually, the real winner today was the game of hockey. I swear there is no better team game. Just my opinion, but that game today is why I love the sport."
517488,Guest,2002-02-25 11:47:00,0,"Congrats to the men from the North. I thought the pregame renaming of Wayne G. to ""the Great Whiner"" was appropriate."
517489,Guest,2002-02-25 12:20:00,0,I agree. I actually thought he was going to cry. He has been in California too long and even though he represents Canada I think his home address is not here anymore.
517490,Guest,2002-02-25 22:10:00,0,What a game. As a born Canadian living in USA and eye fishing in both I can say it was the best hockey seen in years and the best part was that it was two NORTH AMERICAN teams in the finals. Everyone says that the best hockey players come from Europe but it just goes to show that the best are in North America. The women's final made me laugh though watching Walter Bush president of USA hockey handing out the gold medals to Canada.
517476,outdoor fanatic,2002-02-23 08:30:00,90,"Is there anybody out there who is as pumped up with the Gold Medal game tomorrow of Canada vs USA as I am? Of course I'm a little biased and will be rooting for the Red, White and Blue, but it should be one ##### of a game! Good luck to your team, whoever that might be."
517477,Bryan,2002-02-23 08:51:00,244,Let me be the first to congratulate you on your teams silver medal. They played a heck of a game but the old Canucks were just to much for anybody.LOL Should be a great game and may be the only day of the year that I am glad there is ice on the water.Sure hope I don't have to eat crow tommorow!!!!!!
517478,skr,2002-02-23 11:58:00,40,"Me thinks USA all the way!!! Since I'm a diehard fan of the Red Wings, I just hope the Wings players play well. That USA/Russian turned into a nail bitter of a game. I just hope the show the whole game. Good fishing to all!"
517479,Guest,2002-02-23 15:09:00,0,I am sure my friends south of the border will be very proud of there 2 silver medals in ice hockey
517480,NateW,2002-02-23 17:25:00,96,"Since the Olympics started using NHL pro's I'm just not as interested. Sure it was a drag getting slammed around by everyone else when we used college kids and they used pros, but 1980 was worth it! Today...it's just an NHL game with different jerseys. Whoever wins, congratulations, if it's the USA, I'll be pleased. If it goes to the guys with the Maple Leafs on their chests, I'll be happy for my gracious neighbors to the north."
517481,Guest,2002-02-24 15:06:00,0,Nice try guys and girls. Great games.
517482,Guest,2002-02-24 15:29:00,0,"Hey Canadians, How many NHL teams do you have left? It won't be long until all of them are gone. Go U.S.A. !!!"
517483,duffy,2002-02-24 15:50:00,49,Cut out the childish BS. it was a great game and the better team won this time. I as an american will puke when all of the NHL teams are out of canada. I root hard for the USA but the better team won
517484,Guest,2002-02-24 16:03:00,0,LOL Joe..........We are the greatest Hockey Players in the World!!! The game could have gone either way untill the very end. The USA were good competition and played their hearts out. This was the best game I have seen in many years.
517485,fshnwalli,2002-02-24 16:10:00,138,CONGRATS!!!!! Canada Hockey Heck of a game the best team on this day won. Paul from Montana
