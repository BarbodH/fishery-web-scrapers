515788,Guest,2001-12-24 14:26:00,0,"Something I saw today in the papers has good news for walleye anglers in Quinte in 2002.According to the Kingston Whig Standard of Dec 24,2001, Minister John Snobelen announced late Friday ""that there will be no moratorium on walleye fishing this summer in the Bay of Quinte, but that conservation measures will be implemented to protect the walleye stocks""This is good new for anglers, but it may be too late for the tourist industry.The Whig did not include this article in their on line version such that everyone could view the good news.Merry Christmas to ALLDavid aka Superdad"
515789,retire55,2001-12-25 12:27:00,1029,"David: Calling this ""good news"" is the short sighted view, IMHO.""Following a meeting between my office (Snobelen) and local residents, I am encouraged that a local solution may be found. A moratorium would be a last resort.""Well, well, well! The democratic process at work again!By law, all revenue received under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act is put into a Special Purpose Account (revenue sources include Outdoors Card and licence fees, royalties and fines). In 2002 the SPA will amount to 52 million dollars or 70% of the total Fish and Wildlife management Program. Consequently, solutions to the Bay of Quinte walleye fishery crisis should not focus on local/regional requirements but rather on the requirements of all Ontarians. The Bay of Quinte walleye resource does not belong to the Bay of Quinte region.Consequently, I'm utterly dismayed by this latest press release. Allowing another spring massacre (spear fishery and gill net fishery) of already dangerously low breeding stocks cannot, in good conscience, be considered anything other than criminal. Tom Brooke, President of the Canadian Sportfishing Industry Association, wrote in his letter to Snobelen "" The scientific research data we were shown, and the historic information provided by MNR managers shows clearly that we are on the brink of the complete collapse of a world class freshwater fishery "" and "" Extensive scientific evidence exists concerning the damaging impacts on fish populations which results from gill netting spawning fish "".This latest press release clearly demonstrates the ineptness of MNR management. In his letter to Sbobelen, Tom Brooke also wrote "" by your failure to act in a timely fashion to protect this once great natural resource and related economies from unconscionable human abuse, Ontario now faces it's own freshwater version of the epic collapse of Atlantic Cod stocks"". Regardless the foregoing, I will say ""Hats Off"" to those ""local residents"" (although I suspect the CAWM was at work here) for organizing and getting to the minister. I can not emphasize adequately how very hopeful I am that this latest MNR decision doesn't take the Bay of Quinte walleye fishery closer to oblivion. Jay"
515790,Guest,2002-02-05 06:55:00,0,"She:kon!retire55 stated: ""The Bay of Quinte walleye resource does not belong to the Bay of Quinte region.""I would strongly disagree with this statement.First of all, under treaty the members of the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte have a constitutional right to fish the Bay, that precedes confederation and first contact. According to the Supreme Court of Canada, they also have a right to earn a modest living from it as well. (Do you see many people at Tyendinaga living more than modestly and also living off the fishery? I doubt it). The fishing of the bay has sustained the people long before it became a tourist industry.Secondly, spear fishing and gill netting is performed by a few First Nation people, not all of them, and the amount of fish taken during spawning or pre-spawning season is minimal in comparision to the populations of walleye in the bay.Thirdly, the depletion of the walleye in the bay is primarily due to zebra mussels infestation and extremely clear waters that make it impossible for the walleyes to survive high light levels. The fish are still in the lake only in deeper waters.If we are concerned about fishing pressures then there is a need to reel in the tourist operators and tournament organizers to use responsible fishing practices in a sustainable fashion. Anyone with any common sense knows that to earn a dependant living off a unrenewable resource is economical suicide. At some point in time one would have to realize that, by changes that have been occuring in slot sizes of fish taken from the bay in the last number of years.The idea that the Provincial Government has taken a ""hands off"" approach to fishery management in the bay has a lot to due with the jurisdictional problems that they will encounter if they attempt to regulate the fishery and Kaienke'haka Constitutional right to maintain it unregulated. The lessons learned in Burnt Church suggest that driving wedges between the locals and the Kaienke'haka will only delay the conservation efforts - and in the end no one wins - not even the government.So first let's examine the entire issue. Is there really a crisis or is the entire alert a ruse by some conservative yankees to prevent spear fishing and gill netting by using the govenment to do the dirty work? If there is a crisis then why are the tourist operators and tournament champions not first in line to find local solutions? After all they have as great a stake in it as do the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte. I don't believe that government needs to be involved if we can commonly agree that both the tourist operators and the Kaineke'haka have a right to earn a modest living from the bay walleye.But here lies the problem. Some tourist operators don't have an investment in the Bay of Quinte or the people that live there. To them it is just money. If the fishery does go belly up then they will just move on to another lake with more fish so that they can earn lots of money (so they can retire before 55? -just jibbing). And because it is ""economic development"" the government accepts lobbies by organizations to try to take control of it. If, however, they have investment in the area and the fishery, they will be leading the call for study and change to sustain and rebuild the walleye fishery. Are they?If we want solutions then talk - negotiate - discuss and work together with the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte and surrounding communities to find a solution where we all can sustain a modest living off the land and waters of the Bay of Quinte. If you want to take the hardest path -just let the government regulate it for you and I will tell you to expect the worst. Even if the federal government decided to get involved, the fishery and the hurt feelings and the anger will have degraded beyond control. This is one place where the Ontario Association of Anglers and Hunters will cause more harm than good. They don't realize what's good for you is good for us and good for them. The Band Council of the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte has called for further independant studies of the walleye fishery and will respond to them when the findings are clear. They will go it alone if they need to because they have an 600 year investment in the Bay of Quinte. This resource has been preserved for 7 generations so that we could still find food there for our survival. They will set in motions action to preserve it for another 7 generations for our great grandchildren. Can any one in the surrounding communities be as grateful for our sharing that with you? That is all we have ever offered and asked for - a chance to share it with you.O:nen ki wahiI don't speak for the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte but offer opinions that others may share."
515791,retire55,2002-02-05 15:50:00,1029,"Hello Tsi Nikayen' Enonhne':It is commendable that you are prepared to dialogue on the issues impacting the Quinte walleye fishery. However, I admit that the facts as you understand them as compared to my understanding of them are somewhat different.I reiterate that the Bay of Quinte walleye resource does not belong to the Bay of Quinte region. None of us here on earth, whether before, now or in the future, owns resources like the Bay of Quinte. At best, we (all of us) are stewards of the Bay of Quinte and its bounties.The Sparrow decision (Supreme Court of Canada (SCC)) defined Aboriginal peoples' right to fish for food, social and ceremonial purposes and decreed this right takes priority over all other uses of the fishery, subject to certain overriding considerations such as conservation and resource management. What SCC decision accorded Aboriginal rights to earn a living from fishing in inland waters?You stated that ""the amount of fish taken during spawning or pre-spawning season is minimal in comparison to the populations of walleye in the bay"". Can you provide reference to reports that substantiate that claim? The Ontario MNR reported total walleye harvest in the Bay of Quinte for 2000 at 121,000 walleye. Recreational fishermen harvested 32,000 walleye or 27 %, either through open water fishing or fishing through the ice. Legal commercial fishing netted another 3,500 walleye or 3 % and Aboriginals harvested 85,000 walleye or 70 %, either through spear fishing or through gill netting during the spring spawn. Recreational anglers numbered approximately 80,000 while Aboriginal fishers spearing numbered 200. I don't have a reliable estimate for the number of Aboriginals gill netting during the spawn. For 1998, 1999 and 2000, recreational anglers caught immature walleyes averaging 16 -19 inches during spring/summer and larger walleyes during late fall or thru the ice. The average walleye speared by Aboriginals was 24 inches, weighed over 5 pounds and was probably 6-8 years of age or prime breeding stock (more than 50% were females). Gill netting during the spring spawn probably harvests similar average sized walleyes.Both the Sparrow and Delgamuukw decisions decreed that provincial authorities can legally prohibit Aboriginals from exercising their Aboriginal fishing rights for justifiable conservation and resource management reasons.I agree that tourist operators have little investment in the Bay of Quinte. However, Aboriginals contribute little if any financial support to the maintenance of the Quinte walleye fishery either. For 2002, recreational anglers and hunters will contribute 52 million dollars or 70 % of the MNR budget for fish and wildlife management in Ontario.You stated ""If we want solutions then talk - negotiate - discuss and work together with the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte and surrounding communities to find a solution where we all can sustain a modest living off the land and waters of the Bay of Quinte"". I refer you to an article in the 19 Jan 02 edition of the Belleville Intelligencer by Jack Leblanc where it was reported that the Tyendinaga Mohawk council refused to ""go into any kind of consultation process"". Check it out yourself.Many understand that it's only a few that are abusing the resource by taking advantage of weak enforcement. Even Tyendinaga Territory Mohawks have complained about the lack of enforcement both on and off Mohawk Territory. They also understand that the Mohawk committee formed to review the issues will not be able to prohibit the abusers.It is less than productive to attempt to sell the story that as non-Aboriginals, we should be grateful that Aboriginals decided to share the land and its resources with us. Threatening us with ""lessons learned from Burnt Church"" is even more insincere."
515792,Guest,2002-02-05 21:35:00,0,"She:kon!It is a very misleading thing to take rehashed statistics from the OFAH and represent them as being from the Ministry of Natural Resources. http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/csb/new...quinte2001.pdf sets it straight.Interesting. isn't it, that the non-aboriginal fishers took 90% of the fishery in the early 90's and more recently the aboriginal have increased to 50% of the fishery. While the ""math"" appears to support your theory, the Ministry suggests that the fishery was in decline since the early 1980's and environmental conditions were the leading cause of the decline since the early 1990's. However, if you want to take issue that fishing pressure has contributed to the setbacks you should recheck your statistics. In my estimation 90% of 180,000 (1993) is much more than 50% of 120,000 (2001). This doesn't mean that the non-aboriginal harvest stopped. It still continued at an additional 50% in 2001. Further, if you calculate the losses from 1980's on you will see that any devastation of the bay stocks could be the result of non-aboriginal harvest pressure. As I stated before, propaganda and smear campaigns are not good solutions to restoring a sustainable fishery. If the OFAH wants to do some good in this instance they need to stop blaming, unless they are also willing to accept the blame and starting adding meaningful research that contributes to solutions, instead of perpetuating the problem.O:nen"
515793,retire55,2002-02-06 07:56:00,1029,"Hello again Tsi Nikayen' Enonhne':Unfortunately, your response to my attempt to debate the issues is typical - cast doubt, reject factual information - anything but accept reality. Here are some the words you chose to use in your response:misleading, recheck, propaganda, smear campaignI responded to your original post because I was prepared to debate certain points you had made. You respond with an attack suggesting that my response was misleading, was propaganda and was part of a smear campaign (I presume you think I smeared Aboriginals). You referenced one report. Big deal! I suggest you do more research. The Lake Ontario Management Unit annual reports (about 15 reports) from 1998 to 2000 are available on the net. No rehash of OFAH data necessary. Your repeated reference to OFAH is without logic. I used no OFAH data nor referenced any OFAH reports and I am not affiliated with the OFAH.What happened in the early 90's (10 years ago) is history. All stakeholders need to deal with recent research information, identify the trends and reach consensus on solutions.Your attempts to justify Aboriginal abuse of the Quinte walleye resource is shameful. If you are unable to accept factual information or accept the reality of the situation, I suggest you opt out of any discussions on the way ahead. Why? Because you are part of the problem, not part of the solution."
515794,Guest,2002-02-06 15:25:00,0,"She:kon!Of course you are right. The depletion of the fishing stocks due to non-aboriginal over-fishing is history and has ""nothing"" to do with the actual depletion today. (Give me a break. Are you another politician who can't see more than 5 years into the future or 1 year into the past?) If overfishing was an issue you and others would have to take some responsibility for the crisis. Typical poor white male mentality. ""Its always YOUR fault - never mine."" So be it. And I can accept your inability to understand the real issues. It has been a plague of North America since first contact. (eurocentric world view) How is it that YOUR math just doesn't add up? Are you suggesting that the most recent report, which by government methods is summary of all the other reports, is wrong and inaccurate? The math works if we believe the research. Or do you have a stake at admitting that you may be part of the problem. You see taking 162,000 fish a year out of annual stocks of 300,000 to 500,000 (about 1,000,000 fish over 10 years) is a problem created and perpetuated by non-aboriginals fishers when the other environmental factors are worked in. If the fishery was healthy it might not be a problem at all. The only complaints that anyone hears is when the damage is already done and First Nation people continue to fish. Then it is a big problem and the poor white male blaming syndrome kicks in and says ""Hey look what THEY have done."" As to the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte not responding to a request to meet, my understanding is that they refused to agree to a moratorium on walleye fishing until they completed their own independent study of the fishery. Further, I understand that they have banned gill nets and have directed the local Peacekeepers to seize gill nets when found. Of course, not everyone will follow the rules all of the time. As well, my understanding is that when the study is complete they will apply conservation methods that are consistent with preserving a healthy system. What have the bay communities instigated to protect and conserve? Last I checked they were still promoting tourism using fishing in the bay of Quinte as bait. Obviously they still don't see it as an issue.See here is another problem and I appreciate that you might not be able to comprehend. The Bay of Quite is an ecosystem where one component is dependant on another and the water is connected to the sky and the fish to the soil. The big fish are interconnected with the little fish and the predators are dependant on the prey and the prey on the microganisms. Introduce one change in the populations of the smallest component and all the rest are affected.So you can sit in front of your computer and sing the woes all you want but the fact is that neither the non-aboriginals of the First Nation fishers are to blame for overfishing. But everyone is to blame for not seeing the change from a healthy system to moderate one. If, in spite of the evidence of these changes, we continue to allow the fishery at the same rate then we are negligent and don't deserve the walleye fishery in any capacity. We can't change the environment but we can get out of its way. This doen't mean that we stop fishing all together but we need to get those whose only interest is profit at any cost out of the whole system. They don't belong there and they will ruin it for everyone else. Near where I live, near Lake Scugog, similar changes have occurred in the fishery and aboriginals had no major play in it. The reality is that the lake was being over-fished at a time where the ecosystem couldn't sustain increased fishing pressure and it was too late before anyone noticed. In the last 8-10 years or so ice fishing has been restricted to one month but there still isn't any sign of a healthy recovery.The Supreme Court of Canada doesn't make the law (as some ultra-conservative yankees will protest) it simply enforces the law and compares it to fundemental rights outlined in the Charter of Rights. The issues that come before them are the result of good reserach by present leaders and careful treaty negotiations in the last 500 years by intelligent and First Nation captains. The Canadian government dodges aboriginal treaty and pre-existing rights at every turn, even resorting to breaking their own laws to avoid giving in to defined rights (Section 35) of the Constitution. Sparrow, Delgamuukw, Marshall and others not only define specific rights as they apply hunting, fishing and timber rights but they added references in how treaties and pre-existing practices have a part in defining modern application of Section 35. Without a doubt the Kaienke'haka can prove that they occupied the North Shore and the Bay of Quinte long before and long after settlement. It is very easy to prove that they hunted and fished the area in the past and the practice has continued today. So based on previous challenges, one would have to conclude that the SCC would rule that control of the fishery and exemption from Ontario jurisdiction was a pre-existing right. The Ontario Government wouldn't have the bobbers to challenge these rights because they would also by default lose a thousand other challenges that they bluff non-resident First Nation people about also. Just look at the fear that the Powley (Metis) case has evoked in them. Anyway this is a side bar to the real issue. Is that a two legged stool you are sitting on now? LOLO:nen"

515796,Guest,2002-02-07 22:27:00,0,"She:kon!The ""typical poor white male mentality"" tries to defend an undefendable position. You are bent on blaming aboriginal fishers for the decline in stocks yet ignore that recreational fishers were still taking (as of 2001) 50% of the average harvest and in the last 10 years were responsible for removing up to 90% of the annual harvest - even the trophies. You still ignore the environmental causes and still maintain that spearing and gill netting are the reasons for the reductions. Does spearing contribute to overfishing? No more than reel fishing will and does. Does gill netting hurt the populations of walleye? It could possibly given the environmental changes that are presently occurring. So what could be the reason that you insist beating the same old drum? Could you be one of those who insist that Natives shouldn't be allowed to fish, feed their family because it is ruining possible profits of the recreational fishery? Could it be that a poor white male isn't receiving the same benefits as another visible minority? Could it be that you are just ticked because First Nation people can spear and you can't? Or do you have some ""valid"" and provable reasons beyond your own personal conjectures?You see, some spear fishing and gill netting is indiscriminate, it is true. But so is using big boats loaded with tons of GPS, fish-finding equipment and laser sharpened hooks. And some of you guys call that sport. By the time many of the trophy hunters play the walleye to exhaustion, drag it over the edge of the boat and hold it in the air by the gill and the belly waiting for your buddy to fumble the camera in to position, the fish is so stressed that chances are it will have little reproduction left in it. The stress sends the fish off in to deep low-oxygenated waters where it refuses to eat or move for days on end. If it is a trophy size chances are it will die within weeks. If it is a smaller size its immobility will make it game for some of its predators who like walleye fillets, head and all. Catch and release looks good on paper and on TV but it is little more than a delay of the end.If you take the fish for mounting you have wasted a good species for sick pleasure. Sure you can brag about it but for what good. Surely you won't eat so it will either end up in the freezer in the spot that nobody looks for years or end up in the garbage. If you want a successful underharvested fishery then start by banning all that junk designed to increase the amount of fish that can be harvested. The bleepers and bloopers, honkers and ringers not only take away the skill of fishing but they anoy the HE$$ out of all the rest of us. Like radars detectors they have little value for someone who is obeying the traffic or conservation laws.In contrast let's look at another side. In many aboriginal methods the fish are taken because it is believed that both the fish and the onkwehon:we have original instructions that depend on interaction. The meat is consumed or frozen for the next month's meal even at the risk of high mercury and parisites (flavouring in some circles). The walleye and many other species that the ministry has blamed for stock reductions, are taken equally, as food is food the way that it is given. The fillets are removed or gutted and the remains are thrust into the garden to feed the soil nutrients. The memories are not mounted on anyones' walls but preserved in someones mind. Chances are it wouldn't be a big deal anyway because it is a way of life not a tourist industry. The bay and its resources are an intregal part of many people who live on the Territory in much the same way that you probably depend on your car to carry you to work to earn money to feed your family. How would you like it if all of a sudden the government came in and said that you Torontonions couldn't drive cars because the smog was killing all the Canada Geese and in turn you couldn't find a way to get to a job to support your family? Knowing the ""typical white male symptoms"" I would bet that you would first get all the oil companies together to fight the government saying that Canada Geese didn't deserve to live in the city and the car and your livelyhood was more important than the depletion of another doomed species. Pretty close huh!So there are alternatives. But I would guess that you are probably another MBA or other ""educated executive"" type that won't be able to comprehend something that isn't science and isn't statistical in nature, and can't be proven by empirical methods. On the off chance there is someone out there that is willing to find alternatives to your ""blame them and run happily along as if nothing ever happened"" proposals I will suggest it anyway.If you see something as a problem and can't see where it got broke and don't know how to fix it then ""change the rules"". I'm not talking about altering the ""regulation"". I am suggesting that we join together to change peoples minds about what is happening and change the reality that brought it that way in the first place. It is a very simple process that requires a synergistic approach to the issue. Most of it depends on just making up our minds that there are indicators that suggest changes are required in the way that we fish and promote the Bay of Quinte. The second requires firm commitments that we are using our actions to preserve and protect the resource for longer than five years. The goal isn't to preserve it for the next tourist wave either. It is about making a promise to live according the the principal that the bay and all of the fish there need to be availible for your grandchildren and their grandchildren etc. And this agreement must be one that we are willing to live until we pass from this place to the next. Thirdly we must commit ourselves to understand the relationships between the environment and the people and between the people and the environment. Government and private interest groups like to raise the issues but are narrow minded when it comes to solutions. Statistics do lie and so do the people behind them when they are asked about their interests. And lastly, we simply allow the forces of nature, (or God, if you will) to do what is necessary to restore the habitat and the populations to balance. Some people can be pretty arrogant in believing that they can control and redirect the natural world. All we need do as simple human beings is to be able to recognize a healthy system, be grateful for what it has offered us and to be respectful when it tells us something about itself. The Bay of Quinte is speaking loud and clear.O:nen"
515798,Guest,2002-02-09 08:22:00,0,"She:kon!I can easily change a few words here to express a point I have been trying to make:""You appear to have two frames of mind in your last post. The first, the accusatory one, appears to be very culturally oriented and still bitter about the historical treatment of white males in Canada. The second, appears to be thoughtful and educated, advocating synergistic approaches to resolve problems. I much prefer the latter. Please do not interpret this comment as derogatory in any fashion - it was not meant as derogatory - it is just an observation.""I glad that you have been able to recognize the world-view bias in my responses. I am saddened, however, that you can't discern your own world-view bias that I call the ""poor white male"" syndome. Your responses have been littered with this world view and we would not be able to have any meaningful discussion of the real issues unless you can admit that you carry it. Knowing these world-view bias', I can recognize and cautiously remove mine whenever I need to. Once you recognize yours, I suspect that we will find common ground to move forward on.Now here is a problem. What you have offered isn't fact but statistics (with tremendous world view interpretations) designed to support a particular point of view. If the research was sound then statistics can be a good indication of what is happening in the Bay of Quinte. But as Curtis pointed out, further along in this thread, the MNR has no way of compiling accurate statistics concerning the aboriginal fishery. So their statistical information must be derived from someone's best guess. And if this best guess is made by someone with a world view biased against First Nation pre-existing rights, which is endemic through-out the provincial government, then the First Nation fishery will be over stated.The second problem I see with your reported statistics is that if we believe the research then the math still doens't add up. In the MNR's 2001 report they state that the aborignal fishery has risen to 50% of the annual harvest yet your numbers suggest 70%. In true scientific form if the statistics provide conflicting conclusions then the entire research must be suspected. And given that the MNR has problems collecting all the data I would suggest that we must look to other sources, in parallel to MNR research to try to figure out exactly what is happening. I do support the environemental viewpoint as this has been noticably changing over the last couple years. So, for a minute, let's ignore the MNR's ""the sky is falling"" case. As a regular recreational fishermen I would like to know what you see has been happening to the Bay and the fish sizes over the last number of years.

Steve,Glad to see that you have taken an interest in this thread.Perhaps before you wade deeper into any discussion of aboriginal rights and the law, you should do some reseach into the existing treaties and Section 35 of the Constitution that recognizes pre-existing rights of aboriginal people. This hasn't come from Natives breaking the law but only requires the the Canadian and Provincial governments to abide by theirs. The crux of aboriginal rights is that the practices were recognzed and maintained by First Nations people before first cantact and agreements were made to protect those rights on a nation to nation basis. There has never been any military or political submission by First Nations peoples nor has there ever been any denial of the pre-existing National rights. The real debate, today, stems on a belief that First Nations must submit to the Canadian or American Governments. First Nations are not Canadian or American in the same sense that naturalized or landed immigrants can become. So the big question in the minds of today's politicians is ""Where do they fit in?""However, the pre-existing treaties, we are all finding, were adopted and negotiated by intelligent First Nation captains that had forsight for a time when the documents would be questioned. The language provided in many treaties and being confirmed by your Supreme Court of Canada, tells us that we still have a Nation to Nation relationship where it concerns hunting, fishing and land and water resource. The more that the federal government challenges treaty rights the more we will find the language supporting independance. Further, these agreements ARE ""law"" and aboriginal people have never had any trouble defining and remembering the terms. Our oral traditions have been given weight at the Supreme Court because of the many attempts past British and present Canadians politicians have made to manipulate the wording. So the federal governements on both sides of the border can either ignore international law and invade and supress basic human rights (see Sect 7 of the Charter) or they can try to renegotiate those treaties in modern terms. Out west the government has chosen the latter but are finding that negotiation requires give and take not just taking on their terms. Since the western treaties are non-existent or fairly new historically it is easier to find common ground not yet travelled. Out east it is a different story because there are substantial documentation that produced many treaties and agreements. The web is so interwoven that they can not undo it until the federal governments recognize the legitmacy of First Nations to self-determination. This is like saying that the federal politicians have to give up Canada to save it. It isn't something that they will do willingly but when they do it will define a whole new Canada as we know it.Here are some sites to begin your research:http://puffin.creighton.edu/jesuit/relations/http://www.landclaimsdocs.com/stat/h...ution-1982.htmhttp://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-sc...ge=7&numdoc=84http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-sc...ge=8&numdoc=84http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-sc...e=10&numdoc=84http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-sc...e=19&numdoc=84http://www.landclaimsdocs.com/I'll trust that you are just not spouting some racist rhetoric and that you are really interested in understanding the truth by your involvment and discussion of this research.Thanks for your interest.O:nen"

The debate over native fishing rights and the interpretation of treaties aside, we must all agree on one thing. The Bay is in trouble. The causes must be found not to lay blame, but to find effective remediation. We must all go back to our respective 'cultures' and agree that conservation methods are of the utmost impotance. Only if we then come together to work toward a common goal can we hope to save the fishery. It does the natives no benefit to see the walleye wiped out. In fact it may be argued that the natives have more to lose in the event the walleye disappear. We non-natives too have much invested in our resources and it is our resources which will be our number one asset as a country. The environmental factors are irrefutable, and for the most part, unreversible. Let us focus on agreeing to impose limits that will be based on sound science and agree on all parts to follow those limits. It is in our best interest long term to suffer the loss of fishing to the extent we did previously. It will be difficult to gain each others trust, but it is a leap of faith that all must make. If it is not done soon, this entire argument will be moot, the fish will be gone, the motels and guides unemployed, the natives without stocks and all we will have left, is the fingers we are using to point at each other. Grant me the courage to change the things I can, the serenity to accept the things I can't, and the wisdom to know the difference."

However, I do admit to not being able to easily equate ""the cultural importance of nature to the natives"" to an investment in the maintenance of the resources existing in nature. I have understood from information exchanges with Aboriginals, on message boards such as this, that Aboriginal culture requires resource users to guarantee the resource for another 7 generations. While it is easy to respect such cultural philosophies, sadly, the reality is, that in many cases, such reinvestments in resource maintenance are not being made by resource users (Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal).Between 60,000 and 90,000 recreational anglers fish the Bay of Quinte annually (estimate based on 1995 Survey of Recreational Fishing for Bay of Quinte which estimated 87,735). In 2000, recreational anglers harvested 32,051 walleye, primarily immature walleyes in open water fishing (22,811) and more mature walleyes thru the ice (9240). By comparison, approximately 200 Aboriginal fishers speared 13,500 mature walleye and less than 50 Aboriginals gill netted 72,000 walleye (MNR estimates). The average walleye harvested by Aboriginals was female, was 24 inches long and weighed 5 pounds (generally accepted as primary breeding stock). MNR harvest estimates do not have to be absolutely correct to be able to conclude that the biggest detriment to a recovery of the Quinte walleye population and its breeding stock is Aboriginal fishing as it presently exists. This statement is not an attempt to lay blame but simply an observation based on past harvesting statistics. Consequently, somehow, current Aboriginal walleye harvests must be curtailed whether legally or voluntarily.The only way the MNR can legally prohibit the Aboriginals from exercising theirconstitutionally protected fishing rights is to close the Quinte walleye fishery for ""conservation and resource management reasons"". If the Quinte walleye fishery is not closed, Aboriginals will most likely continue to exercise their Aboriginal fishing rights as they have been. I am unaware of any incentives (financial or other) to encourage Aboriginals to do otherwise. However, as you said, ""it does the natives no benefit to see the walleye wiped out. In fact it may be argued that the natives have more to lose in the event the walleye disappear"". I am certain that your statement ""Let us not forget our obligation as conquerers to the natives"" will be resoundly challenged. None of the Aboriginals consider themselves or their ancestors conquered. Their treaties are viewed as agreements between allies.Rightfully or not, I consider treaties similar to contracts. And contracts change with circumstances - sometimes beneficially and sometimes not. The Royal Proclamation was signed in 1763 and then came, at least for Ontario, the treaties of the 1850s. I do not concur with slavish adherence to those treaties. That was another time and definitely another mindset. Consider that an officer retiring in 1763 was routinely awarded 5000 acres of land along the north shore of Lake Ontario. Can anyone realistically believe that such awards could be made today? Of course not. Consequently, I believe that constitutionally protected Aboriginal rights must be harmonized with 21st century realities. This is a far different world than existed in 1763. Living togther in harmony is a two way street."

(Is ""Until the sun no longer shines"" long enough?) Or, a contract can be renegotiated through mutual agreement. But it cannot be dissolved unilaterally, which is what the Federal and Provincial governments advocate.If it is to be renegotiated then there must be mutual consideration which provides at least an equal or better representation of the original agreement. (To negotiate ourselves into a hole for the sake of envious malcontents is just plain silly.)So The Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte have a pre-existing right (which is different then a treaty right) which allows them to fish anywhere unregulated. You believe that you think that Ontario can evoke closure by claiming conservation reasons but I would disagree, primarily because MBQ also have conservation studies and statistics that will set out disprove the ministries reports. MBQ have also set out their own conservation strategy that when complete will consider the fishery in its entirety. The last thing (and you can close your eyes now, Retire55) The Ministry of Natural Resources Report on the Bay of Quinte is a ~racist~ document that will not hold beans in front of a human rights tribunal or the Supreme Court when it gets there. I do not put this forward lightly and I will explain why.Aboriginal, Native and Indian, in terms of the documents about the fishery identifies a race of people and attempts to single out their uniqueness as a cause or as a partial cause of the failing future fishery. If the document was being neutral and impartial, it would also be identifying, by race, the numerous genetic and ancestral backgrounds of other people using the fishery and compiling statistics based on their race, such as Italian-Canadian, Irish-Canadian, French Canadian etc. But the ministry wouldn't do that because they understand that the law prohits the collection of information based on race, colour or creed or any of the other qualifiers. The most difficult problem facing any defense of their use of these terms comes with the simple fact that they are unable to clearly identify who they consider aboriginal or metis.If the Minsistry wanted to identify groups of fishers based on their membership in the MBQ then that might be a legimate approach. However, singling out the MBQ members and not also providing reported statistics of members of the OFAH and Ducks Unlimited members etc. is also illegal and contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. (I would be interested to find out concurrently who hold OFAH and Ducks Unlimited cards and also fish the bay but this is a side bar to the issues).Making an assumption that the specific singling out of the ""aboriginal fishery"" as a identifiable interest group was ~calculated~ then one would have to conclude that the ministry is deliberatly stirring up hostilities between local fishers and First Nations fishers from the MBQ. If we assume, to the contrary, that the reporting of the aborignal fishery was made in error then one must also conclude that the authors are incompetent and incapable of providing accurate or impartial information. Either way the ministry reports are doomed from the beginning.So that brings us back to contract law and my second point about negotiation. As I understand it (and I am not in the political loop at MBQ) the Band has offered to sit down and discuss the issues with interested parties. However, they will not cowtail to bullying or threatening behavior that has been indicative of some ministry officials and local malcontents. And since there is not, to the public knowledge, a reasonable and fair proposal on the table the status quo remains as is.The most reasonable approach to opening negotiations is to get rid of the race card once and for all and treat the overfishing (by all flavours) as one component threatening the future fishery. Once we come to this agreement we can then examine all of the components and weigh them out as to their indiviual contributive threat. Then once causes are agreed upon the solutions will begin to unfold.As long as there are many out there who insist that there is blame to be assigned you will have rhetoric and propaganda being fed back and forth. We get no where and accomplish nothing but the status quo.O:nen"

515843,Guest,2002-02-19 22:23:00,0,"She:kon! Big FishSomewhere, somehow, someone concluded that First Nation people were conservationists or environmentalists. While Kayenke:haka nations do have some career people who adhere to these beliefs, in general we are no more sensitive-ists than anyone else. Traditionally speaking, Kayenke:haka people moved to an area and farmed, fish and hunted a territory for about a quarter to a half a century. When the lands, or the waters started exibiting signs of fatigue it was a practice to move the village 10-20 miles down the path and inhabit the new area similarly. In this way the land and water ""rested"" until it showed signs of improvement. In 10-20 years the entire village might return to re-occupy their original location.In modern times we have become dependant on specific locations, partly do to government policies and partly do to a more sentient and modern lifestyle. Our dependance has shifted from being simple farmers and fishers to be technologically savy workers, sometimes travelling to the jobs and sometimes depending on local employment. However, the term ""the Next Seven Generations"" refers to a reverence for the resources and a sensitivity to its balance being disturbed that keeps traditional Native people aware and cognizant of changes. When these changes occur some people begin to take note and change their habits to suit the changes. The best way to describe this is to consider the movement of a mobile - once touched the entire sculpture responds. These changes are noticed as a result of living in, with and off the land and water systems. They cannot be measured by occasional scientists who make conclusions based on detail measurements. It requires macro vision in order to understand the complexities.It doesn't necessarily mean that drastic measures - such as closing the entire fishery -is a good solution. If we understand, par example, that the increase in pan fish is causing a ""change"" to the system, then part of an on-going solution would be to increase the pan fish harvest, working to restore the balance. (To those depending on the fishery as a food source pan fish are as good as any other). To preserve the resource for the ""Next Seven Generations"" implies using good judgement, intelligence and care in removing the resource as it is needed so that the same resource will be available in 7 generations. It also means making sure that what is taken is not wasted or spoiled. Sometimes it does mean letting it rest for a while but that is a last decision.O:nen"
515846,Guest,2002-02-21 06:20:00,0,"She:kon!The MNR could easily describe the various fishing methods without calling into account the race issue. But they have gone out of their way to impress upon you that the Native recreational fishing is apart from the non-native recreational fishing. Then of course it is easy, as retire55 did, to combine the statistics of all the Native fishing types and create the issue that it is the Natives against the non-natives.The biggest problem is that the MNR is lousy at math. The have no way, as Curtis pointed out, to determine the amount of fish taken by the MBQ or other non-aboriginals. The government can't even determine who is ""aboriginal"" unless of course someone stood at the docks and counted those of colour out on the water. Then we would have to apologize to all those descended the the middle-east, the Caribean, Mediterranean, and so on from around the world. We would also have to apologize to a lot of red-necks in our own country for thinking that there were indian. So what the MNR appears to have done is to stand at the docks and or in boats and check on people's catch and then determine by the looks of the people if they were possibly non-native and count their fish. Then they estimated the entire fsh population by sample, deducted their ""non-native"" fish count and concluded that the natives ""MUST"" be taking all the rest. They then estimated the possible split between aboriginal recreational, spear and gill-net fishing using best guesses. The only other possibility is that the MNR relied on the OFAH statitics (as retire55 appears to do) that come out of nowhere and say that they are legimate MNR research. It is accurate to call the reports racist. I'm just calling a spade a spade and I'm sorry if it hurts someone's feelings. The MNR clearly states the reasons why they believe there is a decline in the fishery and that they believe the causes are environmental. The aboriginal vs. non-aboriginal is only a red-herring in a hatchery of politics.O:nen"

515847,Guest,2002-02-21 09:57:00,0,All the MNR has to do to get some idea of the native harvest is count the number of gill nets and do an estimate based on the potential catch of each net that has been learned from commercial harvest studies. It's pretty easy math or is math a form of racism to you too. By the way counting the number of fish that a bed of a pickup will hold times the number of trucks is even easier racist math. I am angry at whites for their indiscretions as well. What TERM do you give this? SELF RACISM? It just occured to me. Calling white people white is probably racist as well.

First Nation people never endorsed the type of controls that the MNR puts on the fishery. I doubt if there were no regulations that there would be any less fishery than there is today because for the most part the majority of all people are decent and caring. The introduction of regulation is for power. Decent people have no trouble self-regulating themselves.Again the distinction between Native and non-native was created by the government for control purposes and has nothing to do with whether or not aboriginal people see themselves distinct from others. In fact if you really understood the area and the people you might understand just how connected the Mohawks are to the Loyalists and vice versa. It is appaling that there is still an animousity being perpetuated by the government and some people in the area. So, as far as the fishery goes I think that we can agree that there are some irresponsible people out there. People take fish and destroy habitat without concern for what happens. It is these people that regulations were designed for and unfortunately they still exist and the MNR seems to be able to little about reducing their numbers. O:nen"

The introduction of regulation is for power. Decent people have no trouble self-regulating themselves.Again the distinction between Native and non-native was created by the government for control purposes and has nothing to do with whether or not aboriginal people see themselves distinct from others. In fact if you really understood the area and the people you might understand just how connected the Mohawks are to the Loyalists and vice versa. It is appaling that there is still an animousity being perpetuated by the government and some people in the area. So, as far as the fishery goes I think that we can agree that there are some irresponsible people out there. People take fish and destroy habitat without concern for what happens. It is these people that regulations were designed for and unfortunately they still exist and the MNR seems to be able to little about reducing their numbers. O:nen"
515850,Guest,2002-02-21 16:58:00,0,"She:kon!""I divide up the sources of the problem into FUEL , AIR , AND SPARK.""Sure you look for mechanical failure. But you don't look at the red spark plug wire and rip it out because it is red and the others are blue. And you're not likely to blame the sparkplug because it is a Delco and the others are Champion. If there is a mechanical issue with one or the other you can identify by testing it or replacing it and examining the results.So let's look at it from your mechanical scenerio. I'll assume that you have read the report and are uptodate on the issues in Lake Ontario. If not here is the report and pay careful attention in the opening summary.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/csb/new...quinte2001.pdfThe MNR says that the fishery has declined because of changes of the habitat and structure of local fish community and because of environmental changes that see smaller reproduction success. They further suggest that the current harvest levels are higher than the fishery can support. These statements define your mechanics of analysis. However the MNR goes extra steps to break the fishery down in to categories to define where the fish are going. If they were to break it down into commercial or recreational then that still falls within your mechanics. However, they deliberatly include another division which they call the Aboriginal fishery. If we are talking about the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte, an identifiable entity using status affiliation then then they might have a case if they also break it down into tourist operators, charter operators, local residents or residents more than 30 miles away or international visitors. Then we would be still be using demographic analysis. But otherwise if we are comparing recreational and commercial then the MBQ are not part of the same mechanics because the aboriginal fishery must fall into either recreational or commercial (both of which are supported from the territory). They are not comparing demographics because they have not identified MBQ members but try to generalize using an unidentifiable group of people. I would suggest that their ulterior motive is to identify the aboriginal involvement to mitigate the potential damage away from the non-aboriginal sector (again unidentifiable) and create a division based on race ie aboriginal versus non-aboriginal.(Merium Webster online) Racism: 1 : a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race2 : racial prejudice or discrimination- rac·ist /-sist also -shist/ noun or adjective. So I reiterate that the document is racist unless it can clearly identify a group of people based on any other association other than race, colour or creed, and that the collection of such information has some relevance to the actual causes of the decline - not unbased predicitions of the future of the fishery.O:nen"

515851,Guest,2002-02-21 17:48:00,0,"Based upon your criticism of the way MNR differentiated between the resource users, then it would be acceptable I presume to use categories like spearers, licenced recreational fishermen, commercial fishermen and illegal commercial fishermen. Yes, there are non-Aboriginals spearing but we can legitimately refer to them as poachers. I wouldn't hazard a guess at the percentage of non-Aboriginals making up the contigent of licenced recreational fishermen but they would be a huge majority. There is no legal commercial walleye quota for commercial fishermen in the BOQ, consequently the commercial gill netting in the BOQ is illegal. So, the ""race card"" is now dispensed. Can we use harvest statistics now without offending you?In passing, why do you distinguish between Aboriginals and Metis?

Absolutely! But I would be careful about what you call the ""illegal commercial fishery"" because that would be basing science on guessing which is anything but science.I use a broader term for aboriginal in that it means indigenous to a particular land or region. In essence aboriginal refers to Fresian, Mongolian etc. Native, Metis and Inuit describes specific indigenous people originating from specific regions of this continent. The biggest diffence than my definition and the government's is that self-identification is the determining factor.O:nen"

There is, in my mind, no doubt the MNR dropped the ball. They had the opportunity to make a correct, yet unpopular decision for the betterment of the future. However, each Minister is only capable of seeing far enough ahead to count votes for the next election. The Bay of Quinte will eventually be reduced to a very good bass and musky sight with the occasional walleye and lots of stories about the 'good old days.' For years the blame will be passed around untill the next crisis, then we can type in the exact same posts, just pasting in a different location. I am supportive of my Native friends and their rights, however, I am disappointed by their lack of action."
515856,Guest,2002-02-23 15:47:00,0,"She:kon!Don't jump so fast there bigfish! The MBQ have been working with the Ministry over lots of stuff long before the locals became heightened, but the Ministry keeps trying to force their own agenda. Accordingly, the Tyendinaga community has committed to removing the nets. The statistics, however are another issue. The MBQ can't seem to get the MNR to admit where the actual native counts come from. From all accounts they are nothing more than estimations that conflict with actual reserch undertaken by the band. Local estimates suggest that if the MNR is that far off their mark then there may not be an issue after all. Aparently the two independent reports the MNR keeps quoting were co-authored by the same individual. So where do their numbers come from if not from the same source?As to economics, I agree that they shouldn't be an issue. I sympathize that economically the local taverns, charter operators and motels will have some difficulty. But if you want to look at the cost to the environment in further monitoring and rehabilitation the cost is much higher than can be justified regionally. The food source is invaluable but its delcine for the reasons mentioned may be a reality. I read about a comparative study conducted in the Thousand Islands region where the MNR monitored the walleye for a number of years. The walleye populations varied year to year yet the actual harvest remained relatively the same. The conclusions drawn from this is that fishing pressures had little to do with the populations. Environmental and migrational patterns change on an on-going basis and it was this that affected the overall populations. The MNR dropped the ball in not being upfront about the real reasons for wanting the fishery closed. Otherwise this information would have been included in their last report.Many of the local residents are against total closure as well and a number of town meetings in the area had them upset with the way that the MNR has been handling this whole issue. The have set out, together with encouragement and possible participation by the MBQ to find alternate solutions that they can implement if there is truly a problem. However, alot of locals say that there really isn't a problem as the walleyes have been able to be located in unsual parts of the Bay. Overall they maintain that the fishery is relatively unchanged.So based on 2 related reports, improper science and failure to disclose all of the information one must conclude that the MNR is not acting properly. We must demand that they get back on track, restudy the area from many perspectives and provide all relevent information forthwith. Remember these people work for us- not the other way around.O:nen"

Personally I didn't know it once existed until I took my girls to the Museum of Nature this past weekend. I found out that it had been over harvested (commercially) out of extinction by about 1898. Although it seems that some fishers are catching a few here and there. That it lived in deeper water than the yellow walleye and the average size was approx 14 lbs. One should keep in mind that the Treaty affecting this whole issue was made with the Iroquois or Six Nations Confederacy (Mohawk, Oneida, Ononadaga,Cayuga, Tuscarora and the Seneca's), not just the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte. So therefore any decision affects the whole confederacy not just MBQ and perhaps any decision to be made would be done by the whole Confederacy not just Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte.I guess our forefathers did have foresight.Onen"

I think I remember something and likely have some reference (rest assured it will not be too dry reading....lol). Lake ERie I think was the location?There is an interesting anomally of sorts that has been spotted near a place called Thompsons Point (BOQ) with the colouration of walleye and I believe possible other species taking on a blueish tinge within a small Bay . I have not observed this to comment. Within some waterbodies I have observed, this is or can be caused by a mineral or something locatedin the area. To the best of my knowledge this particular example and location has no history of industry (I was very curious about this). Have you heard about this by chance?Curtis....has there been any work by MNR in your area on the upper reaches of the Salmon R.? In particular.... about dams and temperature, etc. An associate has a small place in the area and had noted annedotal references to Atlantic SAlmon; theese appeared to have dwindled at roughly the same time as logging was used on this R. (has sence regrown from what I have observed from areial pics.); there is more cool water in the area than first meets the eye making me wonder about studies and the possibility of brining back Atlatic Salmon to this River. As far fetched as it might sound, there are some surface reasons saying this might be or should be studied (I am not a study buff, but this area looked interesting for a number of reasons relating to fisheries; trout are apprently now sporadically caught above a few of the dams; dams are now being removed in some areas of NOrth America; this is simply a few thoughts (area defined as that between LOnsdale and Forest MIlls; note on a 1:50,000 scale top the topography and look at the area firsthand; it is largely an intact well vegetatted area that seems to have regained some faint semblenace of its former self; this does not factor in a number of conditions but there is far better quality there than first meets the eye)Being a believer in making things work, I have spoke to a few people and my hunch is the bio's do not actually have any hard data; they have some cursorary observations, but by and large this has been a question and a possible opportunity to repatriate a part of BOQ fisheries history that....if the least bit possible....needs to be explored at some point with an open mind and not by a few bio's with preconceieved notions.RegardsODG"

But I am capable of seeing that the government has again produced something that is trying to lines between an issue and one of the ways is to use race as a distinction. If you read the reports, you will also see that the document has clearly drawn other lines separating gill netting (which is a commercial fishery) from commercial fishing. They have also separated the recreational fishery from the commercial fishery. Some of believe that this may be do in part to satisfy the strong OFAH lobby at the province and partly because the MNR has a habit of trying to define the problem by a sum of its parts. This idealogy of science was proven unreliable years ago by the science community yet it is still embraced by modern MNR researchers. Like my earlier points about dominent world views, if we really want to provide lasting solutions we have to remove these world view bias' in order to see the problems on a clearly solvable level. By letting our particular prejudices remain we can't see that cause and problem and we will tend to come to conclusions long before all the data is in.""Problems cannot be solved at the same level of awareness that created them.""

515820,Guest,2002-02-19 22:23:00,0,"She:kon! Big FishSomewhere, somehow, someone concluded that First Nation people were conservationists or environmentalists. While Kayenke:haka nations do have some career people who adhere to these beliefs, in general we are no more sensitive-ists than anyone else. Traditionally speaking, Kayenke:haka people moved to an area and farmed, fish and hunted a territory for about a quarter to a half a century. When the lands, or the waters started exibiting signs of fatigue it was a practice to move the village 10-20 miles down the path and inhabit the new area similarly. In this way the land and water ""rested"" until it showed signs of improvement. In 10-20 years the entire village might return to re-occupy their original location.In modern times we have become dependant on specific locations, partly do to government policies and partly do to a more sentient and modern lifestyle. Our dependance has shifted from being simple farmers and fishers to be technologically savy workers, sometimes travelling to the jobs and sometimes depending on local employment. However, the term ""the Next Seven Generations"" refers to a reverence for the resources and a sensitivity to its balance being disturbed that keeps traditional Native people aware and cognizant of changes. When these changes occur some people begin to take note and change their habits to suit the changes. The best way to describe this is to consider the movement of a mobile - once touched the entire sculpture responds. These changes are noticed as a result of living in, with and off the land and water systems. They cannot be measured by occasional scientists who make conclusions based on detail measurements. It requires macro vision in order to understand the complexities.It doesn't necessarily mean that drastic measures - such as closing the entire fishery -is a good solution. If we understand, par example, that the increase in pan fish is causing a ""change"" to the system, then part of an on-going solution would be to increase the pan fish harvest, working to restore the balance. (To those depending on the fishery as a food source pan fish are as good as any other). To preserve the resource for the ""Next Seven Generations"" implies using good judgement, intelligence and care in removing the resource as it is needed so that the same resource will be available in 7 generations. It also means making sure that what is taken is not wasted or spoiled. Sometimes it does mean letting it rest for a while but that is a last decision.O:nen"

Then of course it is easy, as retire55 did, to combine the statistics of all the Native fishing types and create the issue that it is the Natives against the non-natives.The biggest problem is that the MNR is lousy at math. The have no way, as Curtis pointed out, to determine the amount of fish taken by the MBQ or other non-aboriginals. The government can't even determine who is ""aboriginal"" unless of course someone stood at the docks and counted those of colour out on the water. Then we would have to apologize to all those descended the the middle-east, the Caribean, Mediterranean, and so on from around the world. We would also have to apologize to a lot of red-necks in our own country for thinking that there were indian. So what the MNR appears to have done is to stand at the docks and or in boats and check on people's catch and then determine by the looks of the people if they were possibly non-native and count their fish. Then they estimated the entire fsh population by sample, deducted their ""non-native"" fish count and concluded that the natives ""MUST"" be taking all the rest. They then estimated the possible split between aboriginal recreational, spear and gill-net fishing using best guesses. The only other possibility is that the MNR relied on the OFAH statitics (as retire55 appears to do) that come out of nowhere and say that they are legimate MNR research. It is accurate to call the reports racist. I'm just calling a spade a spade and I'm sorry if it hurts someone's feelings. The MNR clearly states the reasons why they believe there is a decline in the fishery and that they believe the causes are environmental. The aboriginal vs. non-aboriginal is only a red-herring in a hatchery of politics.O:nen"
515814,retire55,2002-02-19 13:48:00,1029,"bigfish1965:It is easy to agree with your statement ""An investment need not be monetary to be substantive"". However, I do admit to not being able to easily equate ""the cultural importance of nature to the natives"" to an investment in the maintenance of the resources existing in nature. I have understood from information exchanges with Aboriginals, on message boards such as this, that Aboriginal culture requires resource users to guarantee the resource for another 7 generations. While it is easy to respect such cultural philosophies, sadly, the reality is, that in many cases, such reinvestments in resource maintenance are not being made by resource users (Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal).Between 60,000 and 90,000 recreational anglers fish the Bay of Quinte annually (estimate based on 1995 Survey of Recreational Fishing for Bay of Quinte which estimated 87,735). In 2000, recreational anglers harvested 32,051 walleye, primarily immature walleyes in open water fishing (22,811) and more mature walleyes thru the ice (9240). By comparison, approximately 200 Aboriginal fishers speared 13,500 mature walleye and less than 50 Aboriginals gill netted 72,000 walleye (MNR estimates). The average walleye harvested by Aboriginals was female, was 24 inches long and weighed 5 pounds (generally accepted as primary breeding stock). MNR harvest estimates do not have to be absolutely correct to be able to conclude that the biggest detriment to a recovery of the Quinte walleye population and its breeding stock is Aboriginal fishing as it presently exists. This statement is not an attempt to lay blame but simply an observation based on past harvesting statistics. Consequently, somehow, current Aboriginal walleye harvests must be curtailed whether legally or voluntarily.The only way the MNR can legally prohibit the Aboriginals from exercising theirconstitutionally protected fishing rights is to close the Quinte walleye fishery for ""conservation and resource management reasons"". If the Quinte walleye fishery is not closed, Aboriginals will most likely continue to exercise their Aboriginal fishing rights as they have been. I am unaware of any incentives (financial or other) to encourage Aboriginals to do otherwise. However, as you said, ""it does the natives no benefit to see the walleye wiped out. In fact it may be argued that the natives have more to lose in the event the walleye disappear"". I am certain that your statement ""Let us not forget our obligation as conquerers to the natives"" will be resoundly challenged. None of the Aboriginals consider themselves or their ancestors conquered. Their treaties are viewed as agreements between allies.Rightfully or not, I consider treaties similar to contracts. And contracts change with circumstances - sometimes beneficially and sometimes not. The Royal Proclamation was signed in 1763 and then came, at least for Ontario, the treaties of the 1850s. I do not concur with slavish adherence to those treaties. That was another time and definitely another mindset. Consider that an officer retiring in 1763 was routinely awarded 5000 acres of land along the north shore of Lake Ontario. Can anyone realistically believe that such awards could be made today? Of course not. Consequently, I believe that constitutionally protected Aboriginal rights must be harmonized with 21st century realities. This is a far different world than existed in 1763. Living togther in harmony is a two way street."
515831,Guest,2002-02-09 09:01:00,0,"She:kon! Steve,Glad to see that you have taken an interest in this thread.Perhaps before you wade deeper into any discussion of aboriginal rights and the law, you should do some reseach into the existing treaties and Section 35 of the Constitution that recognizes pre-existing rights of aboriginal people. This hasn't come from Natives breaking the law but only requires the the Canadian and Provincial governments to abide by theirs. The crux of aboriginal rights is that the practices were recognzed and maintained by First Nations people before first cantact and agreements were made to protect those rights on a nation to nation basis. There has never been any military or political submission by First Nations peoples nor has there ever been any denial of the pre-existing National rights. The real debate, today, stems on a belief that First Nations must submit to the Canadian or American Governments. First Nations are not Canadian or American in the same sense that naturalized or landed immigrants can become. So the big question in the minds of today's politicians is ""Where do they fit in?""However, the pre-existing treaties, we are all finding, were adopted and negotiated by intelligent First Nation captains that had forsight for a time when the documents would be questioned. The language provided in many treaties and being confirmed by your Supreme Court of Canada, tells us that we still have a Nation to Nation relationship where it concerns hunting, fishing and land and water resource. The more that the federal government challenges treaty rights the more we will find the language supporting independance. Further, these agreements ARE ""law"" and aboriginal people have never had any trouble defining and remembering the terms. Our oral traditions have been given weight at the Supreme Court because of the many attempts past British and present Canadians politicians have made to manipulate the wording. So the federal governements on both sides of the border can either ignore international law and invade and supress basic human rights (see Sect 7 of the Charter) or they can try to renegotiate those treaties in modern terms. Out west the government has chosen the latter but are finding that negotiation requires give and take not just taking on their terms. Since the western treaties are non-existent or fairly new historically it is easier to find common ground not yet travelled. Out east it is a different story because there are substantial documentation that produced many treaties and agreements. The web is so interwoven that they can not undo it until the federal governments recognize the legitmacy of First Nations to self-determination. This is like saying that the federal politicians have to give up Canada to save it. It isn't something that they will do willingly but when they do it will define a whole new Canada as we know it.Here are some sites to begin your research:http://puffin.creighton.edu/jesuit/relations/http://www.landclaimsdocs.com/stat/h...ution-1982.htmhttp://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-sc...ge=7&numdoc=84http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-sc...ge=8&numdoc=84http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-sc...e=10&numdoc=84http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-sc...e=19&numdoc=84http://www.landclaimsdocs.com/I'll trust that you are just not spouting some racist rhetoric and that you are really interested in understanding the truth by your involvment and discussion of this research.Thanks for your interest.O:nen"

515797,retire55,2002-02-08 09:54:00,1029,"Tsi Nikayen' Enonhne':You appear to have two frames of mind in your last post. The first, the accusatory one, appears to be very culturally oriented and still bitter about the historical treatment of Aboriginals in Canada. The second, appears to be thoughtful and educated, advocating synergistic approaches to resolve problems. I much prefer the latter. Please do not interpret this comment as derogatory in any fashion - it was not meant as derogatory - it is just an observation.I contend there can be no meaningful debate of the issues based on gut feelings or knee-jerk reactions. Knowledge and acceptance of facts is prerequisite. To curtail further misinformation, the facts as I understand them are:Indeed, BOQ ecological conditions have changed since the early 1990s due to zebra mussels, pollution control programs, etc. This has added to the decline of the walleye population (I am not aware of any research that attempts to estimate by how much). Walleye recruitment (walleye reproduction and survival to adulthood (0 - 5 years of age)) has also been poor. Reasons for poor recruitment levels are numerous and can include water levels, water clarity, food supply (phytoplankton and zooplankton), weather patterns, etc.In the early 90s, recreational anglers were responsible for 90% of annual harvests.The harvest ratio between recreational and Aboriginal fishers started to change about 1994 due in large measure to the Marshall decision (Aboriginals legally commenced spear fishing in tributaries other than the Salmon river (which is on Mohawk territory)). The ratio changed even more abruptly when less than 30 Aboriginals commenced gill netting walleyes in the late 1990s during the spring spawn (truck loads are routinely taken to Toronto, Buffalo and Montreal to sell). Most Mohawks don't like this practice.I don't know what the estimated BOQ walleye population is. MNR biologists estimate that it might be as low as 160,000 (which would be a critically low level). Whatever the accurate population, it is more important to debate and reach consensus on what to do to alleviate the present crisis than to argue about how the walleye population got this dangerously low. That's not an attempt to deny fault, it's just not productive towards reaching potential solutions.Total walleye harvest in 2000 by all stakeholders was 121,000 walleyes (MNR data)(2000 numbers used because 2001 numbers not yet out).In 2000, 80,000 recreational anglers (open water and ice) took 27% of the walleye harvest or 32,051 walleyes. In 2000, legal commercial fishermen took 3% of the walleye harvest or 3,500 walleyes. Legally, commercial fishermen can not harvest and sell walleyes over 23 inches due to consumption guidelines (Health Canada).In 2000, Aboriginals took 70% of the harvest or 85,000 walleye during the spring spawn. Approximately 200 Aboriginals speared 13,500 walleyes and less than 30 Aboriginals gill netted 72,000 walleyes.In 2000, recreational fishermen typically harvested immature walleyes less than 4 years old and averaging less than 18 inches in length during spring and summer in the BOQ. During late fall and thru the ice, recreational anglers harvested bigger walleyes and many were primary walleye breeding stock (9,240 walleyes were harvested thru the ice in 2000).Aboriginals have speared roughly 13,000 walleyes annually since 1998. The average walleye speared has been 24 inches long, 6-8 yrs old and 60% have been females. Size, age and gender characteristics of gill netted walleye (72,000 in 2000) were probably similar. Consequently, in 2000, Aboriginal fishing during the spring spawn removed 90% (or 85,000 out of a total of 94,240) of the big walleye. Since 60 % of these walleyes have been females (average % female since 1994), Aboriginals harvested the bulk of walleye breeding stock. The above facts were gleaned from Lake Ontario Management Unit annual reports (1998, 1999 and 2000) which are available on their web site.I agree with your concerns about catch and release. Studies published in the American Journal of Fisheries Management indicate that mortality rates for caught and released walleye can vary between 10 and 30%. Such mortality rates were contingent upon utilization of proper catch and release techniques. Consequently, recreational catch and release programs would, initially at least, suffer higher mortality rates. Many recreational fishermen need education on proper catch and release techniques. At least MNR fishing regulations now address this important topic.If you dispute any of these facts, please provide references to published data that support your claims so that anyone interested can study and evaluate the information you have.I reiterate I am a recreational fisherman with no financial or business ties to the BOQ walleye fishery and I have never had any affiliation with the Ontario MNR. I presented at the MNR sponsored public meeting in Belleville and I recommended complete closure as the best overall vehicle to protect the declining walleye population and its breeding stock."
515807,Guest,2002-02-09 04:36:00,0,Actually the government(s) here in Canada are very pro-native and the numbers on native harvesting are probably worse then what retire reported.

Examples of your baggage in your last post are represented by comments like: ""typical poor white male mentality""""I can accept your inability to understand the real issues. It has been a plague of North America since first contact""""poor white male blaming syndrome kicks in""Get over it! Move on! Life is a bit** but it beats the **ll out of the alternative. One more attempt to provide you some factual information - which you probably will not accept - why I don't know - but that's your right and apparently your perrogative.Last night in Belleville, at a public meeting sponsored by MNR, MNR stated that harvest levels for 2002 would need to be reduced 75% from harvest levels in 2000 (MNR claims they do not have harvest numbers for 2001 yet). If we use total 2000 harvest as 120,000 walleyes, then 2002 harvest would be capped at approximately 30,000 walleyes. MNR did not specify how such a reduction would be managed or accomplished. Various approaches were discussed from reducing creel limits (maybe to 2 from 4 in the Bay of Quinte) to imposing size restrictions (no harvest of walleyes over 19 inches). Some attendees argued that there should an exception for one trophy walleye (minimum length 26 inches). This could possibly address your question ""what have the bay communities instigated to protect and conserve"". These harvest restrictions may be combined.The majority of meeting attendees (approximately 200) agreed that prime breeding females required protection. Prime breeding females are harvested by recreational fishermen, during late fall and through the ice, and by Aboriginals during the spring spawn (spearing and gill netting). The average female walleye speared over the last 3 years measured 24 inches and was 6-8 years of age. By the way, on average since 1994, about 60% of the walleyes speared have been female. Although there are no data on the walleyes that are gill netted during the spring spawn, I believe it safe to say that the size, age and gender percentages would at least be similar. Consequently, many contend that spring spawn spearing and gill netting represent the major detriment to the sustainability of the Quinte walleye fishery. And it really doesn't matter how we got here (2002) from when (say 1990). The facts are (according to MNR) that we have a severely declined walleye population. What IS important is what are the stakeholders going to do to protect what's left and maybe improve the stocks for the future. Spearing and gill netting prime walleye breeding stock must end now. Of course, you'll no doubt counter that this consensus is just more ""typical poor white male mentality"".The ""no harvest over 19 inches"" for recreational fishermen essentially limits their catch to walleyes up to 5 years old and is intended to protect the prime breeding females. I reiterate that MNR has set no rules yet. I have only reported suggestions made."
