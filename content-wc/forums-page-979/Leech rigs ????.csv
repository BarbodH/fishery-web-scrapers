517314,Guest,2002-02-18 18:38:00,0,How do you rig leeches. I have used a jig head (3/8) and simple hooked the leech in the head once to allow it to swim. Is this correct or are there other methods. Do you use bottom bouncers or under a float?
517315,Bryan,2002-02-18 20:59:00,244,"TLR:Try this.- cut about 7 feet of line- tie your jig head to it (try something little smaller than 3/8)- slide 3 or 4 colored beads onto the line (3mm, 4mm, 5mm)- slide a blade clevis onto the line and attach a small spinner blade- slide a couple more beads on- take the other end of the line and fold over about 6 inches of it and tie an overhand knot so it leaves a small tied loop at the top end- put a stinger hook on your jig head- Hook the leech through the head with your jig and through the back with your stinger- attach the tied end to your bottom bouncerHope this helps."
517316,retire55,2002-02-18 23:23:00,1029,"TLR:One more suggestion. I tend to use leeches while drifting and/or still fishing the bottom. I use coloured (red, fluorescent yellow) light wire hooks at the end of fluorcarbon leaders. Light wire hooks ensure the leech can swim freely. I hook the leech through the sucker and I place split shot (size and number depend on the situation (e.g. current, wave strength or speed of drift)) along the leader to ensure I get to bottom. This set up works for me."

517318,Guest,2002-02-23 08:37:00,0,Jig fishing- 1/16-1/4 oz. lead head jig; Slip Floats 1/32 oz. lead head jig; Bottom Bouncers- floating jig head or light wire hook with spit shot 3 ft. up from hook.
517319,Reels,2002-02-24 17:22:00,2876,I like to let mine swim on a long leader lindy rig with a thin wire hook. Works pretty good if the bite slows down.<{{}}><
