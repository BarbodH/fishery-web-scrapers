517468,Guest,2002-02-22 11:20:00,0,I was just wondering if anybody had any good ideas for a new lake to try around the kenora area? It doesn't matter if i have to drive down old logging roads at all actually it would be better if it was off the beaten path. Any time of the summer it doesn't matter. I usuall head up there 2-3 times a year with a little 12 lund and a 15 horse. thankyou for your time

Several people on this board have been there and most seem to like it. We were there several years ago and had a very pleasant trip. Very pretty lake. Drive in then boat about two miles to the camp. Some folks had thier own boats with them when we were there.There are bunches of drive in lakes in that area. This is the closest to Dryden we have fished. Good luck.Pooch in central Illinois"
