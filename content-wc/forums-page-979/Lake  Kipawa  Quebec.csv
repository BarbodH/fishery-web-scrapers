516174,Dinky,2002-02-02 18:50:00,307,"Kippewa is a very hard lake to fish,so huge and so many out of the way places. It also is a very dangerous lake,kicks up fast and all kind of hidden rocks.The size of eyes are in the 1 1/2# range and rarely much bigger. Lake trout fishing is not too good,only time to fish them is in the spring.Beautiful Lake but gave up on it in the late 70s. (see my other posts)"

It would seem obvious that your group fished la belle province de Quebec too and were happy with the accommodations, the fishing, the hosts and the scenery. By all means, I'd like to hear about the lake and your group's experience there.As to your question - why Kipawa? Our group has targetted speckled trout and lake trout for over 25 years. However, a couple of years back, we decided to give walleye fishing a try. We don't have a lot of experience fishing walleyes and we have only visited a small number of lakes and outfitters for walleyes.Kipawa is a huge lake, over 50 miles long with four main arms and lots of channels. Normally, one has no difficulty locating spots to fish protected from the wind. A weeks fishing goes by pretty quickly and we don't want to be land bound. There is the possibility of catching large walleye (8 pounds plus) although I would say the average is more like 2 or 3 pounds. During the non-prime times for walleyes, we enjoy ourselves fishing for lake trout. We have found good accommodations, good equipment and good hosts. That's why we're returning to Kipawa this summer.However, I'd still love to hear about the spot you guys enjoy. Jay"

516175,Guest,2002-01-31 07:19:00,0,"Why Kipawa? Hmmmm....let's see. This will be our third year to Lake Kipawa and every year we've enjoyed pretty decent success with walleye and pike. This year, we're going to target lake trout as well as I caught one last year while fishing for walleye and it was my thrill of the week. First reason we chose Kipawa was location. It's relatively easy to get to and offers beautful scenery and favorable fishing opportunities. There's a lot of walleye in the lake with the opportunity for some big walleye. You can go out on a good morning and catch 12-15 'eyes per guy. They're not all trophies, but they're respectable fish with a few nice ones thrown in. It's never boring. We've caught some nice pike too, and I understand the lake trout fishing is above average. Second reason we go to Lake Kipawa is accommodation. We've found a lodge that has a great location on the lake, comfortable accommodations and very friendly people. With regard to accommodations, our lodge has always put us on fish and told us the best way to catch them. If it was a slow day, they'd put us on another location. I've never had a problem catching fish, and I'm no Don Lamont or Al Lindner by any means. Third reason...we've tried other lakes all over Ontario with minimal success. Wabitongushi, Nosbonsing, Pigeon, Crotch...all lakes we've tried and have concluded they're nowhere near the package that Kipawa offers in terms of fishing, accommodations, and beauty. I've checked into other lakes around Kipawa including Ogascanane, Dumoine, Watson, and Kikwissi, but ""getting there"" is a battle. And if the fishing is poor, you're stuck for a week. So, that's my reasoning. Our group loves Lake Kipawa, and we've been going up to our annual Canada trip together for over 25 years. As far as I can tell, we'll be going back there for many years to come. But, as you can tell, we're always open to other suggestions."

There is 31M/3, 31L/14 and 31L/15.However, if you are looking for Bathymetric (depth) maps, they are available through the the Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources. I have the one for the north end of Kipawa and its reference number is C-8129-5. I beieve the others are C-8129 (-1 thru -4). I do not have a scanner and therefore can not provide you a copy. Good luck. Jay"
