1422497,spikeidji,2012-04-17 19:28:00,10,"It wasn't to Canada, but when I was in 7th Grade, During class I was called to the schools main office. When I got there my father was standing there and all he said was get your coat and books. I was sure that someone in the family was sick or had died, or I was in for one big time butt whuppin. As I walked out to the truck that March day, I was trebling with dread. Upon entering the truck my dad told me that he had heard that the crappies were biting on a nearby lake and figured we should get in on the action. Later that night, I know he caught **** from my mom for doing it and it did not happen again. Now he is gone, and I'm 50 now, but that memory will last till the day I die. Take your son, you and your boy will never regret it. By the way we caught our limit, we cleaned fish until nearly 2am and yes I was definatly back in school in the morning!!! Spike"
1420480,RCDuck,2012-04-13 08:06:00,18,"I agree, take him if there is anyway possible. My Dad and Grandpa took me on my first fly-in trip out of Nestor Falls when I was about 12... still one of my best memories to this day. Dad has taken me on about a dozen similar trips since. This year in June, I'll be taking my 9 and 11 year old daughters, and my Dad on the same Fly-in trip I went on almost 30 years ago. I can't wait. I've taken them to LOTW for a couple of years, but this will be our first fly-in together."
1420553,Jatar,2012-04-13 10:29:00,169,"The poor kid will be heartbroken, talk to the teachers, have him bring his assignments as its a long ride to and from, and there is plenty of non fishing time as well. Make him a deal-no assignments done then sit in the cabin all day. It's a great opportunity to spend quality time together and he will probably learn more about life on the trip than he would in those few days of school. Just my opinion."
1420671,catran3,2012-04-13 15:26:00,29,"Well you all have convinced me to at least speak with his teachers and see what they think about taking him- if they don't see a problem with it I would feel a lot better about it. It would be a great time for the both of us. Canada, walleyes, friends and family- it doesn't get any better than that!!"
1420749,rnnonmt,2012-04-13 18:23:00,992,AMEN! I have a 6 year old as well.... in a few more years I hope I can still afford to go and bring him along too! I'll have both boys up there with me.
1420781,cuamb,2012-04-13 19:53:00,203,My son was 11 or 12 when we were short one for our houseboat trip. I was trying to decide if I could afford to take him to fill the last spot.He would be the only non adult. About that time our friends lost their daughter. It was an easy decision after that. He absolutely loved it. Told his mother it was just like deer camp!They will remember more about that week than anything they would have learned in a week of school.
1420784,LOW1,2012-04-13 20:04:00,2828,"Take the child, the memories that you make will be talked about for the rest of your life and at your wake. And there is such a thing as a healthy disrespect for school and other governmental authority."
1420789,jiggster,2012-04-13 20:23:00,183,"Catran 3, take your son with you. If the teacher objects due missing work, that is not the real reason. You are talking about the end of the year. What your son learns from the trip, bonding with you is more valuable than what he will receive in the last week or two of school. I do have some experience with dealing with situations like this and being able to compare the last week or two of school to the learning of the trip. There are some teachers that will say he should be in school and not on a fishing trip. In my opinion they are completely wrong. I have taught 2nd -5th grade for 40 years. I would bring 160 students and parents on a 4-5 day trip to the environmental school on the North Shore. The learning there and the bonding between the children and their parent are invaluable. TAKE HIM!!"
1420817,rnnonmt,2012-04-13 21:41:00,992,"Catran3, you may be able to bring back one of these memories with you as well. This is my son Caleb with the biggest walleye. It is a Lac Seul 30"" monster. I couldnt have been more proud. And yes... he has a caught a bigger walleye than any of us veterans that have been going for many many years."
1420860,Tonyo,2012-04-14 06:40:00,212,"Catran3 you will have the best time. Take him along. I have a 12 year old son that has been going with us for the past 3 years and this will make his 4th. Not only do we enjoy a great week together but he talks about this trip year round. The memories that are made on trips like these are priceless. This picture is from 2 years ago, fishing off the docks at 5 Lakes Lodge on Gullrock. TonyO"
1421026,keek,2012-04-14 17:51:00,1003,Take you son! I started taking my daughter out of school for a day of hooky fishing last year. She was in kindergarden. It's a tradition that I will offer every year. I hope to build up to a full week of hooky when she is in high school. Memories my good friend.... Memories.
1420294,rnnonmt,2012-04-12 19:00:00,992,Was just looking through some pics and videos from last years trip to Lac Seul and found a funny video of my 11 year old son netting a small pike off the back of the boat while it was beached. Really thought he was going to go swimming.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbKaU...ZAQFE_tCCwhik=
1420304,rnnonmt,2012-04-12 19:15:00,992,There is just something about being with your kids doing things you love. Caleb with an over the slot Lac Seul walleye from the June 2011 trip.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9RhRND7XlU
1420310,catran3,2012-04-12 19:23:00,29,I have been invited to go fishing in Canada the last week of May- haven't been there in years so I can't turn it down but my 12 y.o. will still be in school so I can't bring him:-(
1420327,rnnonmt,2012-04-12 19:41:00,992,"Catran3, If you can get your 12 year old out of school for the week you won't be disappointed with the father/son bonding that happens. My Dad took me for the first time to Lac Seul when I was 10. He had to pull me out of school the first week of June. I still have the old polaroid pic of me hugging him in the boat and I'm approaching 40 now."
1420331,rnnonmt,2012-04-12 19:45:00,992,Found this video of a black bear drinking the oil out of a deep fryer on a houseboat parked in Kekabeka Narrows during the week of June 10th - June 17th 2011. Was this your houseboat??? Would be funny to find out who's houseboat this was and if you were scratching your head trying to figure out where all the oil went when you got back to the boat. LOLhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em9K9...9ZAQFE_tCCwhik=

1420413,micropterus,2012-04-13 06:05:00,450,Take him!!
1420417,Bill Krejca,2012-04-13 06:26:00,6107,You'll be making memories if you take him. Tell the school authorities you want to do this. It is amazing how flexible they can be! Class rooms are not just in a building! Bill Krejca
1420462,GOBIG,2012-04-13 07:38:00,126,"I did not start fishing with my dad until late 20's, however have not missed since. Take your son, he will thank you later in life. I wish i could go back and spend more time with him."
1420469,wallydave,2012-04-13 07:51:00,2151,"I'll start the spooling in mid May. Thats the time I go over the tackle box...again just to make sure I have twice as much stuff that I need!Its going to be rainy this weekend, maybe a trip to Bass Pro will be a good way to avoid cabin fever!!??"
