1421481,wallydave,2012-04-16 04:36:00,2151,"Late May early June can be a pretty good time of year for that area. Our group used to hit the first week of June every year. Now we wait until our school teacher and his sons are out of school. The weather can be unpredictable, but that is of the year anyway, no matter where you go. Better hurry, most placed will be filling pretty quickly!"

Typically the fish at in 4-12 foot water, which for me makes the fishing much easier. I do most my fishing in Sawmill Bay during this time"
