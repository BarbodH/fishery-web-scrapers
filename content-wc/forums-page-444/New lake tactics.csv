You get a depth map, maybe a satellite picture, maybe ask for some advice from the local bait shop...but then what? What do you concentrate on? Time frame is the last week of May. Location is near Ignace. Tons of lakes around there and we are going to try a few new ones this year."

Wind blown shorelines, follow the wind you'll find the walleyes. Northern will be in back bays were there is warmer water, if they move check the points on both sides and the drop before main lake. Also Northern will be at the incoming rapids if the suckers are running. That's why spring fishing is so good, there generally in the same areas, but a bad cold front can really knock them down for a day or two. One year on a fly in we had 75 degrees go to upper 30's and just barely scrapped out dinner with 4 guys fishing."
