With this year's early ice out I am looking to hear from those of you that fish in July/August to see where you have you best luck catching Walleyes. I know you Iowa fishermen name your spots but if you can help out where they are from say like the boot, I will know what you are talking about. This year my 11 year old and I will be arriving on June 8th. Hoping that the regular spots are still hot but thinking we are headed for deeper water. Thanks for any help."

Normal years we are running bottom bouncers with spinner rigs with crawlers or minows.I am heading up End of June and sometime in September over 2 months away but time is going quick LOL"
