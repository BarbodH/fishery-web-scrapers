1421328,ranger22,2012-04-15 17:41:00,124,How is this place to stay at nice. We are looking to go on a adventure with our young kids and this place seems to be nice as the fishing is good right off the dock. The pictures look nice from the web sight. Has anybody stayed there.
1421343,Fishin Fun,2012-04-15 18:09:00,218,I've been going to Southbay for years. I love it. It's run by Mary Spencely. Fishing is great off the dock. On the more windy/rainy days we just fish off the dock and catch walleyes. The cabins are nice and clean. She only has minnows for bait so if you want leeches or crawlers you'll need to pick them up somewhere else. PM me if you want any other information. I'd be glad to help.
1421393,Moondog,2012-04-15 19:31:00,362,We also have been staying there for years but in a camper. Cabins are a little hard to come by but I believe she has some available. Very nice camp.
1421396,ranger22,2012-04-15 19:39:00,124,do the cabins book up quickly?
1421404,Fishin Fun,2012-04-15 19:46:00,218,There are only 3 cabins so I would assume that they generally do. I get their newsletter ever winter around Christmas and Mary lists their cabin openings and they did have some openings available back then. She also have pics of 2 monter muskies that were caught off the dock opening weekend last year.
1421406,Fishin Fun,2012-04-15 19:49:00,218,When are you going up there this year?
1421424,ranger22,2012-04-15 20:11:00,124,Not sure yet.
1421572,Moondog,2012-04-16 08:37:00,362,Those were northern and we caught them!!! Muskies are rare in Gull Rock. Very rare. Also Mary's cabins are generally booked year after year by the same people but she does have openings and cancellations so you should check with her.
