Several years ago my son and I were up the same week, the warmer days the minnows died very quickly, I have been gearing up wth crawler harnesses for the late spring weather we might be dealing with. Has anyone tried to freeze a water bottle to help keep the minnows alive? We will be using leeches too this trip, but we have always had great results with minnows, I'm wonering if the minnows on ice might just work!?"
1416303,Steve Ediger,2012-04-04 11:00:00,97,I believe it's Frabill that makes a small minnow bucket that has an aireator built in. It runs on two D size batteries. I have seen these systems keep up to five dozen minnows very alive and fresh for an entire day. The bucket is rectangular in shape and has a net that you can raise out of the water to access the bait. I would think that you could put minnows and leeches in together and keep them all day. It work very well but is a battery muncher. A fresh set of batteries may only last a day or two but compared to the price of four or five dozen minnows a day it may be a good deal.
1416309,wallydave,2012-04-04 11:06:00,2151,"Minnows are part of the daily rate at Goose Bay, so its not really a matter of cost, I have seen different systems for keeping minnows alive, maybe I should check around at the local Bass Pros! Have a great trip!"
1416333,cuamb,2012-04-04 11:40:00,203,"Wallydave, to answer your question ice in the minnow bucket works well, I do it at home all the time. I do recommend a styrofoam bucket though."
1416335,cspierings,2012-04-04 11:45:00,230,I freeze bottles of water and then keep a couple in the cooler with the food and one goes in the minnow bucket. I have taken to using the Frabill bucket with the aerator on it and then just running it off the battery in the boat by using the cigarette lighter to power it. With all the rules about what you have to do with bait if it touches the lake water its just the way I have gone to keep bait alive and me from having to dump the unused bait in the trash at the landing.
1418640,bigwalleye1,2012-04-09 17:26:00,2632,"Not to hijack the post, but man, coming back to the landing as long as you've still got minnows is JUST PLAIN WRONG...."
1418662,wallydave,2012-04-09 18:13:00,2151,"Big, I agree, but one year we were later than usual, late June, the warm weather killed off the minnows pretty quickly, I;m just checking for some ideas for keeping minnows alive, so we return to the docks with empty buckets!"
1418718,Bigstorm,2012-04-09 19:39:00,799,you could always try salted minnows that you can bring with from home. We catch just as many fish on salted minnows as we do live minnows

Works very well even in hot weather. When hot I do throw in a few ice cubes during the day, but not enough to shock the minnows with a sudden temperature change.Will run most of a week on Duracell ""D"" cells. Keep in in the shade and throw a wet towel over it in the sun.The plastic minnow buckets that you throw over the side of the boat fail to keep minnows alive if it is hot and the water temperature is too warm for them.As expensive as bait is anymore it is time and money well spent to keep them alive and frisky. Same goes for leeches and worms.Most guys really don't take decent care of their bait in hot weather and end up with crap for not so alive bait.More than my nickles worth! Good luck.Pooch"

As far as the minnows, I change the water as much as possible during the warm days and make sure the aerator is working. Haven't tried the water bottle trick, but sounds promising."
