My question is, will all of the regular spots that we fish be productive? or will we have to find new deeper locations to fish? Thanks"

Our week is still a few months to go, so it may be too soon to tell, check with your camp operator when you arrive, they will have the latest feedback and put you on the fish. The weather and water levels will also determine where the bite is."

However if the May and June water temps become extremeyl warm it could speed up migration. Our first week is June 9th and the water temps than are usally between 57/65. It will be interesting. The saving grace may well be that Lac Seul is a Walleye factory and even a bad day there is better than a lot of good days on other lakes. Mike Kansas
