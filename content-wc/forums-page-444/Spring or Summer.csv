My question for the group is, given the odd weather this year in NW Ontario (near Ignace), is May 27th going to be considered Spring or Summer when looking at migration/spawning patterns?"

Even though ice is gone or nearly gone on most drive to lakes, walleye patterns for the opener and for a while after will still depend on what temperatures are registered on a day by day basis. If temps were to be in the 50s and low 60s during the day and night temps are in the 30s and 40s till the end of May, you would probably see normal water temps for the period around the opener. (fish in spring locations) If the air temps continue to be as unseasonal as they were in March, the time frame around the ""Opener"" could lend to fishing summer fish locations. Obviously, the spawn will be earlier that normal but fish probably still will not move to summer locations until the water temp dictates it. Won't really know till it all plays out. Marv"
