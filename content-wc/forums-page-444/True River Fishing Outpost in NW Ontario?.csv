I'm not saying that's not a river system, but it's a bit different than how I think of river fishing here in the lower 48. Are there any rivers that are large enough and deep enough to run your boat and which offer miles and miles of current (with good fishing?). I would guess if it's a true river it might be hard to get a float plane in there unless it's extremely wide."
1421202,wallydave,2012-04-15 10:40:00,2151,"Check out Ghost River or Hidden Bay, they are both on River systems, Hidden Bay is like what you mention, lakes with rivers running through them, Woman River and English River might be what your looking for?Good luck!"
