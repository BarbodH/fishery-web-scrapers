It seems they work almost as good as live minnows without the hassle of bringing them across the border and keeping them alive. And also maybe be cheaper to buy ahead of time and do it yourself. The article explains how to do this. They are suppose to keep forever in a freezer or a cooler which sounds very convenient. It seems like it makes sense to me but has anyone else tried this and if so what kind of results did you have? Heading up the last week of May so I still have time to try this......Thanks, Randy"

1420529,RistoRap,2012-04-13 09:47:00,434,"We used them on a fly-in trip - the owner gave them to us to use. Worked OK, but I think we could have caught fish on anything.The only problem I noticed was that they are not as ""tough"" as leaches or live minnows, meaning they would fall off the hook rather easy. They are however nice and easy to pack and take care of."
1420531,Golden Eagle,2012-04-13 09:55:00,2642,"Start with fresh, not rotten, minnows. 3 or 4 parts salt and 1 part Borax. Borax is a preservative. Add a little garlic powder for extra stink. In 2012 I'll be using leftovers from 2011."

Seemed they really nailed the bigger ones better then the smaller 2-3 inchers. Probably taking some with me this year, the ones they left looked like they were just frozen, no salt."
1420598,Bigstorm,2012-04-13 12:00:00,799,I usually take 60doz salted minnows with me to Canada every year. I have yet to have anyone in our group say they prefer live bait. The other nice thing about salted minnows is that they tend to last longer.
