1421412,Guest,2012-04-15 19:56:00,0,With high north winds today the remaining ice in Goose Bay is nowhere to be seen. My record book will show April 15th as the ice out day for 2012. This is the earliest date since I have been keeping records. Best wishes to all for a safe and productive fishing season....

The one good thing about low water is that there is less water for the fish to hide in and when you find them they tend to be more concentrated"
