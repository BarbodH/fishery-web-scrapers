1422536,Swifty,2012-04-17 20:46:00,9,We went to Gawley's last summer with a group of friends that have gone for several years. Had a wonderful time. We stayed in the cabins but half of our group stays in the campgrounds. Nice campgrounds and very accommodating hosts. Many campers we met spend their summer there. Will be back in July....counting the days.
1420941,Moondog,2012-04-14 11:15:00,362,Never too soon to plan so need some input. We are planning to spend the summer of 2013 in Canada using South Bay at Gull Rock as our base. We are hoping to do a little lake hopping and are looking for other places that offer a decent campground for our motor home. We are specifically targeting lakes within a days drive of Red Lake. Any suggestions??? Need at least a 30 amp hook up (preferably 50 amp) with good sized camping spots and we have a dog. Thanks!
1420949,TIGHTLINER,2012-04-14 11:43:00,223,I am sure you are going to get a lot of good posts from WC. When we camped I went to the AAA and got a book from them and it listed US and Canada RV parks. With you having a dog I am sure you will be limited but there should be lots of them listed in this book. Also I think Woodall's and Good Sam put out a book with the information you are looking for. We planned a trip to Yellowstone and several other places out west and we found everything listed we needed to know including phone numbers.
1420977,wallydave,2012-04-14 14:10:00,2151,"Just down the 105 from Red Lake is Goose Bay Camp, Ear Falls. They have space for RV parking, good boats and a shower house available."
1421017,Moondog,2012-04-14 17:07:00,362,"Didn't know Goose Bay had RV accommodations. Thanks for the info. As far as Woodalls, Camp Club USA, Good Sam etc. We have them all. Just looking for some personal observations and recommendations. Hey, we need all the help we can get!"
1421092,tackleman,2012-04-14 21:53:00,444,are you taking your boat with you or going to rent for your stay at these camps?
1421096,Moondog,2012-04-14 22:16:00,362,Taking our boat. We are thinking of maybe 3 or 4 one week adventures next year beginning and ending at Mary's. Tackleman... we have fished very few lakes but have been to Rough Rock and Minnitaki. Think we need to expand our horizons and see some new landscape.
1421141,HighTech,2012-04-15 07:26:00,75,"There are a number of RV sites on or near Wabigoon Lake. But the only one I know of with full 50 amp at every site and pull through sites able to handle the largest unit even with a boat is Wabigoon Lake RV Park. They have a dock with power to charge batteries. They have a web site, check it out."

1421239,Moondog,2012-04-15 13:12:00,362,Already heard back from Andrea at Goose Bay and it is what we are looking for. Thanks for the info. Keep those suggestions coming!
