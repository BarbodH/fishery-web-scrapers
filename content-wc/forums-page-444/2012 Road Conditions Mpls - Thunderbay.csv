1422242,The Canuck,2012-04-17 09:50:00,67,"Hi JJJMN, I dont think there would be any major road construction from TB to Savant. You might have some around TB as there seems to always be some there but minor. May 18 still might be a little early for road const but you never know with the warm temps we have been experiencing this year."
1422412,bigwalleye1,2012-04-17 16:20:00,2632,"There will be construction on 35E, single lane for most of the summer from approx 694 to Centerville, both directions. They worked on the other lane last year in the same area. You could look at State Hwy 61 (east of there) as an alternate to Forest Lake, or 35W (west of there) as a freeway alternate. Working the area on ""off peak"" hours would also be a good alternative."
1422532,catran3,2012-04-17 20:36:00,29,There will be road construction going on in and around Duluth again this year but shouldn't be near as bad as last year. Not sure when their going to get started in earnest but so far not much going on. It'll also depend on what time of the day you come through.
1422535,catran3,2012-04-17 20:42:00,29,Oh and I almost forgot- I'll be heading up to Sturgeon Lake also but the last week of May and first few days of June- It'll be my first time to Sturgeon and I can't wait to go!!
1422549,rather-be-fishin,2012-04-17 21:07:00,429,Also road constructions on I35 from Sandstone to South of Duluth. Will be worse on Friday's and Sundays so plan accordingly and expect long delays on those days.
