I purchased gas one time using a credit card and they tacked on an extra 2 percent for using the card. Then once you get back and don't pay off the card you get nailed with intrest. Just becareful and have a good time in our neighbors country."
512893,czy42strokes,2001-06-03 09:32:00,419,Several places we frequent now tack on a 3 percent fee for the using a credit card. I bring canadian and what I don't spend I put away for the trip next year..usually a pocket full of coins.:)
512894,Guest,2001-06-04 11:55:00,0,In the Soo exchange money at the casino right by the bridge they give a great rate all the time.
512895,Guest,2001-06-05 04:24:00,0,"A lot of smaller places will do that because they have to pay 2-3% to the credit card companies per transaction(they don't just make money on interest you know).So it's the business's way of covering expenses. Just look at it differently ""Paying by cash subject to a 2% discount."""
512896,Tim,2001-06-05 05:19:00,179,Why bother? Main expense is lodge & rates are usually quoted in US & they are glad is accept US $'s All the places we stoped at take US-sure the rate's not so great but for the convience who cares? just be sure to take lots of 5's & 1's 'cause your change will be in Canadan $'s
512882,Guest,2001-05-30 19:07:00,0,"I'm sure this has been posted before but I have not come up with it. Where is the best place to exchange money ? I have always exchanged at the local bank but it never seems to fail that one guy doesn't and we have to make an extra stop at the border. It also always seems to me that this guy gets a better deal on the cash. Is this true ? should a guy exchange at the border ? If memory serves, it seems like they were giving a little better than the actual exchange rate.any experiences or preferrerd places to exchange ?we will go north through the Soo and come south near Duluth.thanks for any comments,lobo"
512883,Tom,2001-05-30 20:28:00,1063,"Thats usually the best place to exchange because you usually get the best rate at the border at the duty free store. Also best to fill the gas tanks before you cross and get your Canadian beer and smokes at the duty free store. FYI, I was told that the Soo store closes at midnight, but I dont know that as a fact, does anyone know what time they close or if they close? I know in Detroit thay are open 24/7."
512884,Guest,2001-05-31 09:18:00,0,thanks
512885,Guest,2001-05-31 10:19:00,0,"Yes, the duty free store in the Soo closes at midnight"
512886,docIN,2001-05-31 11:50:00,120,Something new I have been doing the last two years... I go to my local AAA and get Canadian travelers checks. I get the current exchange rate and no extra fees. Then you are also protected from loss or theft. Just food for thought. I have never run into a place where they were not excepted either. Good Luck.
512887,Guest,2001-05-31 12:26:00,0,You Americans got it made when you come to Canada and just the opposite for us Canadians.
512889,Guest,2001-05-31 12:29:00,0,"Also, if you use your credit card, they calculate the exchange rate at a very fair percentage and send you the bill for the comparable US Dollars."
512888,the viking,2001-05-31 19:09:00,30,"I wouldn't go so far as to say we got it made... when you come visit us your money is worth less but gas is two bucks cheaper per gallon, the sales tax is only 6.5% and a limit of walleyes is triple of what it is in ontario.....any way, it all works out in the wash ..........what is the limit anyway? the viking!"
512890,RANGER,2001-06-01 04:56:00,4341,"This is what we do:1) We exchange our money at a Bank in Canada subsequent to crossing the border. We have found that the exchange at the Duty Free may be 2 or 3 days off and about the same in percentage. This has happened a number of times so we go to a real Bank.2) As in another post; we try to use a credit card wherever possible. Mastercard, Visa, etc., negotiate ""best rates of exchange"" all day, EVERY day and YOU benefit from it.RANGER""KEEP YOUR LINES WET, YOUR POWDER DRY and THE BEER COLD!"""
512891,Guest,2001-06-01 06:08:00,0,I do alot of travling around the world ( including Canada ) my suggestion is to minimize the amount of cash you exchange and use a credit card whenever you can. They give you the best conversion and you don't have to rechange back money left over. Every time you convert currency a fee is charged. With credit cards they keep all kinds of currency in banks around the world so they can give you the best conversions and don't charge you a fee.
