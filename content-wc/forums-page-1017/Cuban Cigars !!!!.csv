I know they are not cheap, but can I bring back a box legally?. Are they real cubans? Best Place to Buy Between International Falls/Fort Francis and Nestor Falls? Thanx in advance"
512782,chrism,2001-05-25 13:31:00,429,"Yep, they are real Cubans, you can get them at most smoke shops, they are good, and the USA govt won't allow them to cross the border!"
512783,Guest,2001-05-25 14:11:00,0,Cuba is a common Canadian winter holiday spot. I have been a number of times and bring a 100 cigars at a time back. I supply my friends and I smoke about 30 a year. I find the Cohibas overrated and expensive. I prefer Bolivars and Montecrist #4s. There is no better experience if this is your thing than a good brandy and a cuban. Throw in a few friends and some walleye and it does not get any better.
512784,Guest,2001-05-26 00:46:00,0,"Another great reason to fish Canada. Cohiba is a greta smoke. It may be overpriced because of it's reputation, but it's still a wonderful cigar. I rarely smoke cubans but I ""have this friend"" who buys them thru the internet from the bahamas. They comes with no rings and in box labeled Dominican Republic. The actual box and rings come in a separate package a few days later.How close does Canadian customs check at airports? I've got a buch of empty cigar boxes!"
512785,Guest,2001-05-26 04:15:00,0,"Beware! there are fake cubans up there too. Buy from a store that looks like it belongs there, not some shack on the side of the road. The mall in Kenora has a good store."
512786,Guest,2001-05-26 06:54:00,0,"There's cigar store that stocks Cubans just outside of Fort Frances on the highway going west. Cohibas are good and get the most publicity, might also try Montecristos, ther pretty good too and little less expensive! Not legal to bring back into the States, so enjoy while you are in Canada!"
512787,duffy,2001-06-04 12:01:00,49,We are getting into winnepeg thursday at 11:30 p.m. and then flying to red lake the next day at 6:30 a.m. My questions is:Is the airport tobacco store open at these times so we can get some cubans?Does anyone know if there is a place to get cubans in red lake?Thanks in advance.
512788,Winnie,2001-06-04 17:36:00,375,"Doggone, I didn't even think of looking for Cubans while up there! I've gotten some in Mexico before and really love them. I also very highly recommend Romeo y Julietta churchills w/ the thin gold band. I bought a box in Cancun for about $300 a couple years ago. Just make sure you are buying from a reputable dealer."
