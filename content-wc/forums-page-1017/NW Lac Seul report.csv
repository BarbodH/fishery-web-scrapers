512979,Winnie,2001-06-04 06:26:00,375,"Just returned home late last week from four days at Goose Bay camp. The weather and fishing were tremendous. Spent the first morning at the mouth of the Wenesaga. Most of the several boats there were anchored and throwing jigs/minnows and letting the current take them to the fish. We caught all we wanted. After lunch we went back to a spot we found last year near the opening of Sawmill bay and really caught some nice fish w/ Jigs and minnow again. Second day we decided to run down to Broad Lake south of McKenzie Bay. Our 30s got us down there in a little over an hour, but it was well worth the trip. Not one minute into to lake and one of our party caught a 29.5"" eye. We spent the whole day slowly moving up and down the first one hundred yards on either side of the mouth of Altimeter Creek casting up ot the bank and slowly jigging back to the boat. We caught all we wanted and more. That area became quite popular by the middle of the day as there were roughly 20-25 boats in the immediate area. Third day was considerably slower as a front had moved in over night. We stayed at our spot near Sawmill and did ok. Caught some decent sized fish (20-22"")but quantity was way down.On the fourth day a couple of us made another run to Broad. The fishing wasn't quite as hot as the second day, but it was still great. Some people were starting to fish Altimeter Creek, so the 'eyes may have been starting to move up it and out into the main lake. I know the river opened on Friday and the fishing was expected to be hot, but I had already gone home, so I don't know how things went. Thanks to all who gave tips and advise. We ad a great time."
