The water level was up substantially, water temps still cold, and very little weed growth. We did not find fish in our usual ""hot spots"" so had to do a lot of hunting. We found most of our walleyes in 12 - 15 feet of water hanging off of windy points. Artificials did not produce anything - everything was caught with jigs tipped with 1/2 of a crawler or minnows, or live bait rigs. Cold, rainy, windy weather (normally good for 'eyes) did not help. We did catch 300 - 400 walleyes, largest at 7.5 pounds, but most were in the 12 - 16"" category.P.S. -- Went through at International Falls at about 6:00am and the line was already starting to form, had about a half hour wait."
