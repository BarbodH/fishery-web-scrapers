Some northerns while chasing 'eyes. Read alot of the earlier posts and the info will be very helpful. Anyone know of any spots for big northerns or know of any other walleye hotspots. One of they guys that is going up this year loves to fish pike. One week to go! Can't wait. Any info would be appreciated."
512954,Guest,2001-06-01 17:22:00,0,"For the BIGGER northerns, your best bet is down the lake.Some decent sized one's can be had west of Shanty Narrows. To consistantly catch the bigger one's head towards:Manatoba Point> both sides expecially the west bank.Stoney Point>Windigo Point> south sideMcKenzie Bay> reefs close to cabbage bedsPoplar Narrows> north bank (big island side)Hungry Narrows> east bankFind Cabbage beds that are adjacent to deeper water (20-60'). Big northerns like that situation cause they can move up into the cabbage or close to it and feed. If not much happening in or around the cabbage move out deeper to locate the bigger fish.June can be good but have caught my biggest fish in Sept. June/July usually produce fish up to 40"". Personally, the northern fishing isn't what it used to be on LS. Seems like the last 3-4 years the population of bigger northerns have declined. My guess that is why they imposed a slot size 2 years ago. Hopefully that will help the northern fishing like it did for the walleye fishing. The Big one is still in there GOOD FISHING! Post a fishing report when ya get back!"
512955,Guest,2001-06-01 18:55:00,0,When you locate the walleyes. Try pulling some cranks over the same area. This tactic produces better size fish. TGG
512956,Guest,2001-06-02 13:09:00,0,Thanks for the advice. I'll give a report when we get back on the 16th.RB
