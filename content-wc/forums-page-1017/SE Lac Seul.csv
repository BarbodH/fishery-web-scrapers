512959,Guest,2001-06-02 04:22:00,0,WE WERE UP FOR THE OPENER. RAIN-RAIN-RAIN. THEY WERE IN POST SPAWN MODE . LEECHES DID FINE BUT MOSTLY ON MINNOWS. THE BEST AREAS WERE UP AT CHAMBERLAIN NARROWS AND BIRCH NARROWS AREA (AS USUAL)DIDN'T CATCH HARDLY ANY NORTHERNS.I WOULD THINK THEY WOULD HAVE THE FEED BAG ON BY NOW. CHECK SHALLOW WEEDY BAYS FOR WHERE THE MINNOWS SHOULD BE. GOOD LUCK!
