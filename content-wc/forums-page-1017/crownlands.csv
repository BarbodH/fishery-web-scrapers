I've talked with folks at the offices in Red Lake and Chapleau and they were both very helpful.Although, I am still waiting for Shelley at the MNR in Chapleau to send me my maps - IT'S BEEN TWO MONTHS - put em in the mail !!lobo"
512974,lenray,2001-06-03 10:36:00,467,Your thinking about fishing and mine are similiar-you want to be the only one on the water.I live in Mi. and go up 6-8 times per year. I am up in Ontario or back putting together the next trip.Where I go the 16 foot would be to big. We go 80 miles on a dirt rd. then put a canoe on top of a quad and go another 6-12 miles depending on the lake then portage with the canoe thru the river lake system then pack in with an inflatible to lakes where you will never see anyone else.Take a couple of younger guys-mules- and it isn't so much hard work.The fishing is awesome. We try to find baits that the fish won't attack but have not found any still looking for that bait that will turn them off.len
