They said the fishing was good, walleyes up to 4lbs, northerns up to 16lbs. They didn't mention the bugs. Another group of friends left for Pakwash today. I checked the Red Lake/Winnepeg weather forecast for them yesterday and it looks like the weather seems to be breaking up, mostly next week for a mix of sun/clouds in the 15-20C (60's F)."
