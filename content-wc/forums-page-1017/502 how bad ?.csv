As far as the road, he said it still had potholes, etc.Since I am going to Vermilion Bay and pulling my boat, I am planning on the other route. It is further, but the road was better last year. My trip planner says it is close on time.Good luck,Fritz"

Most pot holes have been repaired and there is a few rough sections. ""BUT"" My trip to the Fort Frances and back to Dryden was excellent. On the way to Fort I saw a moose feeding on the side of the hiway.Then on the way back I saw three moose, a black bear and a Bald eagle . This was in the evening so the animals were coming to the side of the hiway to feed. Take your time and enjoy the scenery.Buznick"

They came back by 502 and apparently the construction there had not been in full operation - road is rough, but was OK. Two groups of friends left today for Ear Falls and planned to take it easy going up 502."
