5687058,johnboat,2017-07-27 10:07:00,2014,I don't mind 5 at all and have done it quite often. But I have a 21 footer. And jig 99% of the time. We all either grew up together or are family. Everybody knows better than to bring a suitcase full of tackle and I have plenty of room for rains suits etc...Having a smaller boat or not knowing how everybody is going to get along...............well that's another story.
5687394,Guest,2017-07-27 12:25:00,0,"How would I handle it? Delicately. After all, he is a friend and you guys haves established a pattern that you now want to change. I'm not saying you have to take on 2 more passengers, I'm saying let's try to change this and not hurt a friend. He brings his 16 footer, but would rather be in your boat. Hmmm, wonder why.  Maybe he also wants to fish with you, but can't when each of you are piloting their own boat. Options: Dads in your boat, sons in his boat (or the other way around). You can switch at the start of the day or after the long destination ride is over. Note - at some time you will need to transfer some rods & tackle. Are the sons also friends?  Maybe he is not comfortable with the responsibility of being captain (navigation, finding fish, effort involved). It might be easier and more fun to leave the driving to others.  Is his boat trustworthy? If possible, can you find out the underlying reasons why he wants the cozy cruise before making him walk the plank? That way you may be able to bundle the eviction notice with a new solution that might be welcome."
5687714,pjshorthorn,2017-07-27 15:09:00,5654,"Interesting perspective, but if I was concerned about running on an unknown lake I would just set up a game plan to follow my buddy in his boat and then fish together in the same general area. Eventually, everyone learns safe routes and can be more confident especially if the same lake is fished year on year. I remember running my boat on Lac Seul well before a thing called GPS existed. We took our time, noted hazards we saw on a paper map, talked to folks we met along the way and never left our other boats out on their own for too many hours at a time. We always checked in with one another,every so often, just to see how fishing was and if anyone had any issues. This year was the first time I ever used GPS in a boat on my own. Pretty neat tool to run back over spots where you caught fish,but dead reckoning ain't too bad either. If my buddy hadn't rigged up an old depth finder and dumped the lake chip on it, I would have squinted into the sun and lined up with a known landmark to start another drift or trolling pass. Call me old school ........I guess I probably am......LOL. A person bringing their boat on a trip, but leaving it on the trailer or at the dock every day doesn't cover their fears....it only magnifies them....JMO. PjShorthorn"

5691042,Baseline,2017-07-29 11:49:00,3207,"My answer would be very simple......NO. It's your trip too. If you would prefer not to have 5 in a boat, say so. The guy will get over it."
5691186,That Minnesota guy,2017-07-29 14:44:00,8293,My guess is the boys would also prefer not to be with dad every minute. Dads go in one boat with one kid. Two kids take the smaller boat. At noon switch somebody between boats. Do this daily. I'd drive 500 miles and sit in the cabin with a book before fishing 5 in a boat every day on MY vacation.

5696346,emma17,2017-08-01 14:59:00,436,"We returned home from our trip last night. Despite 4 days of pure sunshine and little wind, we did pretty well. I enjoyed reading the responses to my post and appreciate all of the good suggestions and humor. To his credit, my friend R brings the boat up because he completely understands we may want to do our own thing. We know his preference always is to ride together and he knows we may want space. As one poster suggested, this trip we tried something new. We brought both boats out in the morning to a Walleye spot, anchored his boat at shore (I hope that's legal) and all fished together. For late morning, early afternoon, we separated and got some casting in. A couple posters suggested finding out his motivation. R and his son love to jig Walleye, and will do so willingly from sun up to sun down. They equally love the friends/social aspect. R loves to relax to the stereo and banter with the boys. Neither he nor his son like to cast, so they have the best of both worlds when we are all together. His motivation is purely hanging out with all the guys, enjoying the incredible Canadian outdoors and fishing. Regarding rotating our sons in the boats, as my sons are both in college, I want to spend every minute with them (whether they like it or not). I may be delusional, but I think they feel the same. For the record, I didn't post with the hope R would read it- he barely uses text and uses email even less. Message boards aren't a part of his world. We had a great trip. It will be an ongoing effort to balance my and my middle son's desires to occasionally cast for Musky and Smallmouth with the social benefits of all being together on one boat. Thanks again for sharing your thoughts and experiences."
5696402,Multispecies Guy,2017-08-01 15:44:00,447,Congrats on a good trip and a continuing friendship.
5697994,pjshorthorn,2017-08-02 11:26:00,5654,Glad you and your crew had a good trip and fun together. That is all that really matters. PjShorthorn
5685546,Golden Eagle,2017-07-26 14:08:00,2642,Disney World would be a better option for a party of 5.
5685602,3M TA3,2017-07-26 14:35:00,2846,"Hey, it's your boat, you're the captain. My opinion, two is just right, 3's a crowd, 4 is pushing it, and 5 just ain't gonna happen. Suggest he put 5 in his boat for the day and see what happens. Swapping boat mates during the trip makes a whole lot of sense. It's not just you being affected by crowding but you don't have to blame anyone else. Just tell the guy how you feel. Friends appreciate the truth."
5685746,andersaki,2017-07-26 16:00:00,1426,"Fishing in a boat is like dating, twos company and three's a crowd, at least in my boat. andersaki"
5685778,The tank,2017-07-26 16:29:00,340,Can't you just tell him you don't want to fish 5 in your boat. I told the guys I go with I won't fish 3 no more in my boat. I'll drive my pick up and boat up by myself and fish by my self if I have too. I like my space.
5686082,Live to jig,2017-07-26 19:39:00,159,We would never fish more than 2 in a boat...ever

5686938,southernEyes,2017-07-27 09:30:00,232,"We fish 5 in my 175 Competitor quite often. It's limited to trolling with planer boards, jigs, dropshot,and lindy rigging. We don't have any issues and typically everyone catches fish. And there's usually a dog on board too. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
5685114,emma17,2017-07-26 10:51:00,436,"I just can't seem to say no. My two adult sons and I have the 18' Crossover. My friend and his adult son have a 16' Sylvan. Although he brings the boat up, he much prefers for all of us to fish from the same boat. This will be our third year. Walleye fishing- 5 lines in the water. If we want to cast, he graciously offers to drive the boat so the 4 of us can cast. How would you handle it?"
5685138,mlg,2017-07-26 10:55:00,9,I would open a thread on walleye central and hope he reads it.

5685178,v-bay gord,2017-07-26 11:10:00,3168,I would just say I would like to use my own boat.........let's fish in the same areas. Swap sons once in awhile....
5685194,Multispecies Guy,2017-07-26 11:14:00,447,If he's indeed a friend it should be easy enough. Tell him two boats would be safer and more comfortable. Set up a rotation where you all take turns fishing with different partners in the 2 boats. Maybe a friendly competition between boats. Maybe a walleye boat and a bass/pike boat. Lots of ways to split up and relieve the tedium.

5685282,Stringbean,2017-07-26 11:46:00,279,"We had the same dilemma at the end of June up on Gullrock. We had 7 guys in camp and 2 boats. It was just a matter of swapping out people in the 2 boats every day. Most days I wound up with 4 guys and it worked well. As mentioned, there was very little casting. Surprisingly, there was always someone who pulled in a fish. I heard a lot of ""Get the Frabil"" all week. Getting an 18 foot boat up on plane with 4 people is another story."
5685314,LOW1,2017-07-26 12:14:00,2828,I would talk with the kids (they are really adults) and confirm that they too have concerns. I would then tell the other dad that the group has these concerns and that if it doesn't work out there would need to be a switch to two boats.Humor the guy for the first half day and use just the one boat. He may just want to be creating some memories or re-doing what he did as a kid.A half day of chaos won't hurt too much.Then switch to two boats. Finding a solution may depend on finding out what his motivation is.
5685330,pjshorthorn,2017-07-26 12:19:00,5654,I couldn't imagine 5 in a boat regardless of the size or layout. Either explain that you would like to spend your time fishing with your sons in your boat for the week or rotate fishing partners throughout the week.....but definitely using both boats every day. I'm not sure why your friend would want to pull their boat all the way to the lake destination and then not use it . PjShorthorn
