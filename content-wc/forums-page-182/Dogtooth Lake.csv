5650225,team walleye,2017-07-06 18:30:00,336,I'm thinking about Dogtooth for my next trip. Anyone go there? What are your thoughts for big walleye here?
5650393,wiwalleyefreak,2017-07-06 20:13:00,25,"It is a great lake for large walleye. We have been there four times and each time the experience is different and the techniques that worked last time didn't work this time. It can be tough to get numbers but put in your time and 28 plus is very poseible. Our biggest in the 4 trips 32.5""."
5650865,brown1317,2017-07-07 07:11:00,74,"We fish there every year. It's a good lake for 32+ walleye but it can be the dead sea too. Really dependent on timing (i.e. when the fish are biting). We've had years where each person in our group has caught several over 28, but it can also be like this year where we didn't catch a walleye until the very last day of the trip. Watch out for the rocks too."
5651034,Buckwolf,2017-07-07 08:15:00,1,"I fished Dogtooth in the late 50's through mid 60's and caught good numbers each time. There wasn't a trip go buy when somebody in camp caught a 30+ walleye. My best 32.25. Since then in talking with guys who have gone there the walleye fishing is poor, but they still catch a 30"" every now and then. I believe it's a good place to get your 30 incher, but certainly not numbers"
