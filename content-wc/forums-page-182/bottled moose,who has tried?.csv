My kids cant even look at it LOL my wife hates it when I open up a bottle in the house... If ever in my area I would be happy to share a jar with them. Rod"
5709346,123chadder,2017-08-09 10:21:00,429,"i have 2 moose roasts,im going to make bottled moose,but im going to make a beef/red wine/rosemary stock with parsley and minced garlic,ill put slices of onion and green pepper in with the chunked moose as well...i cannot wait to make i wonder if you seared the chunks well would the meat be a nicer color,the ONLY thing i dont like about bottled moose is the grey color of the meat,searing might give a nicer brown color"
5709386,martinbns,2017-08-09 10:58:00,1520,"You are basically making moose stew, searing the meat will help the appearance but won't change the texture. My wife and I have this debate over beef stew which she generally makes in our house(actually the only thing she ever cooks), my son is a professional chef and both of us cringe when she just throws the raw unseared meat in the slow cooker and leaves it. But we both chow the it down 6 hours later with no trouble."

5703426,123chadder,2017-08-05 18:11:00,429,has anyone ever done bottled moose?i had it last year and it was incredible right out of the jar!
5703762,Mojo-NC,2017-08-06 06:09:00,1929,"Bottled moose? What is it? I've had bottled Moosehead and once you get past the skunky smell immediately upon opening it, it's not bad."
5704506,123chadder,2017-08-06 12:12:00,429,"its moose chunks with onion,broth,pork fat and onion,and cooked in a canning cooker and preserved...,,its so amazing...... warm it up and put over rice......its extremely tasty!"
5705154,zeebee,2017-08-06 20:34:00,1144,"Its better known as ""canning""."
5705682,martinbns,2017-08-07 09:28:00,1520,"If you can get past the look of it in the mason jar, it's not bad. It's a Newfoundland thing."
5705698,Ricky Spanish,2017-08-07 09:34:00,1298,"A lot of folks around here do this with deer. I'm told it is just about the quickest way to have dinner ready. Warm it up, or not, and serve on bread, rice, potatoes, noodles...you get the picture. I have not tried it yet, so maybe it is so good that nobody shares."
5706466,123chadder,2017-08-07 18:33:00,429,its fantastic cold out of the jar!i loved it!
5708698,FishinRod,2017-08-09 06:48:00,10,"I grew up eating this, it was delicious! Dad and I would go goose hunting and we would bring a loaf of bread a cast iron fry pan, warm it up over an open fire and eat with buttered bread.. I sure miss those days."
5708922,Mojo-NC,2017-08-09 08:16:00,1929,"Is this something that is available commercially, or is it just another way to process your moose after harvest? If it is a commercial product, I would like to stop at the grocery store next trip to Canada and give it a try. I'm sure the rest of my group would like to give it a try as well."
5708970,martinbns,2017-08-09 08:36:00,1520,"It is not a commercial product, basically they slow cook moose chunks in gravy with onions and potatoes then put in Mason jars. Then over the winter they crack open a jar and heat it up in a frying pan and spread it over rice or smashed potatoes. Sent from my Pixel XL using Tapatalk"
