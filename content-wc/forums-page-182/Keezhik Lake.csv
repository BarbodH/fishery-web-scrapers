I was also doing some research and there is a huge 33 000 acre fire that looks to be on the northern shores of the lake. Do you think this might hurt the fishing?"

It's pretty awesome, not just for pike and walleye, but big brook trout too. PM me your info and I'll pass it along to my friend. Guaranteed 100% he'll be happy to chat with you.Cheers"
