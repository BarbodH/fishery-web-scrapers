5679042,daveyp,2017-07-22 12:25:00,5,"Anyone fishing this lake this year? last season when leaving from the boat launch they were making the road wider to get the barge down it by the launch. I assume now more people are camping at this launch area due to road improvement. Any fishing reports, water levels this year. Mauro you heading up in August this year.Hope to see you there. Dave"
5690994,northernbite,2017-07-29 10:17:00,1186,"Water level good to plus. i'd say normal. Fishing is good, a lot of smalls but like any lake if you fish around you'll find them. Jig bite and troll with 3 ways good also. If not where you normally fish there close by. Paul"
5698698,daveyp,2017-08-02 19:54:00,5,"Thanks Paul for the fishing update and water levels, definitely cant go wrong jigging, i only use plastic baits and still catch a ton of Walleye. Ramsey has a lot of structure, don't think i will ever get tired fishing this lake always finding new spots holding schools of fish. Thanks again for your reply."
1151223,IRISHATTACK,2009-12-01 09:20:00,44,"Send me a PM. I will give you the number for a guy whom has been to www.rayscamps.com for over 20 years. Very nice camp, fishing is good. Pike are small, but walleye are everywhere."
1151344,rapp,2009-12-01 20:35:00,48,You can drive up to the lake. Many camping spots on the lake & some at the landing.
1260444,Guest,2011-01-09 06:05:00,0,"fishing ramsey is horrible..... , people forget the sport of catching and release , which screws with fish population, o well not my city just goin to school here, and catching your limit LMFAO whats up with that why do u need so many fish ??? again people forget the sport of fishing they just worry about how much fish they can bring home to sit in the freezer. ... so have fun ruining your own lakes...."
1260872,TIGHTLINER,2011-01-11 09:30:00,223,BEEN GOING TO RAMSEY FOR 22 YEARS HAVE FOUND THE FISHING TO GET BETTER EVERY YEAR YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND THEM AND ONCE THAT HAPPENS IT IS LIKE ANYOTHER LAKE. OVER THE YEARS THE SLOT LIMIT HAS HELPED THE WALLEYE POPULATION AND WE ARE NOTICING BIGGER NORTHERN PIKE. I BEEN THROUGH THREE OWNERS OF THE CAMP AND THE PRESENT OWNERS ARE GREAT PEOPLE TO WORK WITH. THEY ARE RUNNING THE CAMP LIKE THE PREVIOUS OWNERS AND I NEVER HEARD A GUEST BAD MOUTH THEM OR THE PRESENT OWNERS. THE PRESENT OWNERS ARE YOUNG AND ARE VERY WILLING TO WORK WITH ANYONE THIS IS THEIR INCOME SO IF THEY MAKE WAVES WITH THE CLIENTS THE WORD WILL GET OUT AND THE CAMP WILL GO DOWN HILL. IF ANYONE NEEDS INFO ON THE LAKE JUSTIN THE OWNER WILL HELP AND I CAN ALSO.
1330792,michigan fish magnet,2011-07-17 14:59:00,14,Finally made it out to Ramsey Lake. Lots of rocks and shoals. It's going to take a lifetime to master this lake.
1997281,daveyp,2013-07-31 20:57:00,5,"Going up to Ramsey soon in August, just checking in on water levels and road conditions, not to mention how the fishing is so far this year. I was up 2 years ago and water levels were very low but the logging road was in pretty good shape. Its always a great trip in just hard to leave it every year. Any info would be great, Thanks."
2047137,daveyp,2013-08-21 17:13:00,5,"Regardless of the weather and rain we had some tough conditions throughout the week it started out great this year fishing the points in the bottom end of Cats bay. This 29 inch Walleye made the trip, biggest i have ever pulled out of Ramsey. It was released to live another day but have some great memories and photos. This lake has never let us down as you always catch lots and the odd 23 incher but this topped off the trip. Its still out there hope someone else gets the joy to real it in again.This year we saw higher water levels and fish were adjacent to deeper water not in the shallow bays. Can't wait for next year."
4102177,daveyp,2015-08-04 14:15:00,5,"Heading up August 8th for the week, any reports on water levels, Sultan rd conditions and of course how the fishing has been this year. Look forward to getting back on Ramsey."
4105249,TIGHTLINER,2015-08-05 14:02:00,223,Dave sent you a pm let me know if you got it.
4109553,Mauro,2015-08-07 09:35:00,10,Hey Dave Are you the guy with the Springbok I think I remember you. I will be heading there the same week. Look for the black Lund. Will be fishing in Cat bay.
1146961,rapp,2009-11-07 23:07:00,48,"I owned a camp 1 mile from the Bisco general store for 12 years. I spend most of the summer and some fall in the area. I know most of the local some whom have live in Bisco all their lives like the Sedlesky Family original settlers. In fact two of the brothers worked for the MNR. I can only tell you stories they have related to me long before my time. In my opinion having fished every corner of the 200 plus miles of shore line of Bisco, Ramsey still as much better walleye fishing. Bisco as too many locals fishing (60 + permanent camp or home) & outfitter camps & tourist & remote camps & INCO camps to maintain the ****s & rented house boat from the lodges fishing the lake. Lot of fishing pressure. Ramey as only two private camps, one lodge and only one boat launch. During the week days on Ramsey you may find yourself being the only boat in Cats Bay. Also if you are ever up in Bisco on a long weekend I recommend you attend the Bisco Disco dance at the rec center.Again everyone as their own story"
1147078,phishfearme,2009-11-08 18:42:00,1242,"according to the MNR (R G Elliot), ramsey was stocked with walleye from bisco lake in ""1955-1960"". my first trip there was in 1970 when ray cripps promised 100 pounds of pike a day or your stay that day was free. to my knowledge he never had to pay - we never challenged him either - pike in the 8-10 pound range were easy to get and a 20 pounder or two were expected every trip. you're right, everybody kept the trophies they caught - i plead guilty, for many years. different times then. (looks like there one less trophy walleye in opic lake also!) by the time we stopped going there (after ray's ashes were spread over ramsey lake) getting a pike over 30 inches was extremely difficult, walleye were a real challenge and water skiers were in cat bay. ownership went from ray to hersch hite/bill kern, then to bill alone, then to jerry kucescheski, then to pete and thea and i think it was sold again recently. phish"
1147100,rapp,2009-11-08 23:39:00,48,Your correct I am not in the habit of releasing any fish other then what I am required by law or too small. I did not recognize this walleye as a trophy since it did not exceed the largest I have landed.............My loss.
1147318,IRISHATTACK,2009-11-10 05:14:00,44,"I have fished Ramsey Lake for 5 years. I stayed at Rays Camps. The fishing is ok, I believe a slot limit for 5 years would help the Trophy fish. I caught eyes on everything. The pike are everywhere, but small. I have only seen 1 38in pike. I will not be going back, there are a lot of others lakes that have big pike and better walleye fishing for about the same money.."
1148269,michigan fish magnet,2009-11-16 06:34:00,14,[quote=rapp;1146860]This is my largest walleye this year landed not far from Ramsey Lake. 29 inch caught in tall 10 foot grass in Lake Opic. Never heard of lake Opic. Is that Oh what a Picture lake?
1148444,rapp,2009-11-16 21:33:00,48,It's located on the east side of hwy 144 just north of meteor lake. Opic is not it's proper name.
1148740,Guest,2009-11-18 10:33:00,0,yes i been going to ramsey for 24 years
1149012,michigan fish magnet,2009-11-19 11:26:00,14,Thanks found it.
1149044,Mike Kansas,2009-11-19 13:46:00,1463,Nice Fish Mike Kansas
1151206,Babamel2,2009-12-01 07:56:00,414,Is Ramsey a flyin only or can one drive there? What camps are available on Ramsey? I have been looking for a camp in that part of Ontario and would appreciate any info.
510808,Guest,2001-01-29 17:50:00,0,I am planning a week up at Ramsey Lake the last week of June. Has anybody fished this lake the last couple of years? And what baits worked best?
1146277,michigan fish magnet,2009-11-04 08:18:00,14,How did you do on Ramsey Lake? I just joined Walleye Central today. I've driven past Ramsey lake turn off several times but have not fished it yet.
1146304,saulteyes,2009-11-04 10:13:00,32,It depends on which part of the lake you are fishing. Are you fishing cat bay or are you staying in the campground on the north end of the lake? Chartruse jigs are hard to beat in that lake.
1146400,michigan fish magnet,2009-11-04 17:02:00,14,Heard good things about swallow a little bay off of Ramsey
1146401,michigan fish magnet,2009-11-04 17:03:00,14,I always say if it's not Chartruse it ain't no use.
1146856,rapp,2009-11-06 20:48:00,48,I have been fishing Ramsey for the past 20 years and it just gets better. You normally catch your limit within two hours. A couple of years ago a friend landed an 18 lbs pike. Originally this was only a trophy pike lake until the MNR planned walleye. You can never go wrong in fishing Ramsey except in May or early June if we had a cold spring.
1146857,rapp,2009-11-06 20:56:00,48,Colors white or white/red combo very dirty water if you dive you cannot see 3 feet in front of you. My neighbour lost is table umbrella in 10 feet of water and we could not see it This Lake was originally a river system that was dammed lot of silt in the water. Also the fishing improves when they lower the ****s.
1146859,rapp,2009-11-06 21:05:00,48,Swallow is a small lake leading into Ramsey not as active as Cats bay I always fish cats bay. Also I once caught a walleye casting with a re/white devil unbelievable. Also you often catch the blue walleye
1146860,rapp,2009-11-06 21:18:00,48,This is my largest walleye this year landed not far from Ramsey Lake. 29 inch caught in tall 10 foot grass in Lake Opic. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...1&d=1257567174
1146901,saulteyes,2009-11-07 12:02:00,32,"The MNR did not plant walleye in Ramsey, the locals did. They took them from biscoe lake which is just down stream. Biscoe is better fishing for walleye. My father worked up there for years and his chum was a logger from there for over 50 years. You could not believe the pike fishing that lake had. It would have rivaled Knee lake. The only proplem is that all the locals kept the pike. There are still some Lake trout lakes that have some huge pike in them that no one fishes. My father has caught some huge ones jigging for lake trout in 70-90 ft of water in the winter"
