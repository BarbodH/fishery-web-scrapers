Very clean and everything functioned as it should have. We had wifi in the cabin and satellite TV available. Granted we never turned the TV on it was available.For boats we had a 17 footer with a 50hp. Great handling and no issues with the gear. We fished all 4 in the same boat and had plenty of room and no concerns.The fishing was good. Not having any river fishing experience it was a little curve ball for us but between the guidance JR and the other guests provided we were able to figure things out and catch our share of walleyes.The other guests in camp were probably the most open and felt more like a community than any fishing camp have ever been to. There were people from Iowa, Kansas and Indiana in camp the week we were there and they all shared pointers on where they were fishing and what they were doing. Undoubtedly the most communicative fishing resort I have been to. Several nights we furnished appetizers for other cabins and they did the same.If you go there I would also recommend going to the spillway below the power plant one evening. We had one night when I did not want to go out after dinner and fight the wind with the kids in the boat and we dropped down and did some shore fishing. Kids flipped jigs with plastics into the current while I had a cold one sitting on a rock. Very enjoyable for all.I would recommend JR's to anyone looking for a place to stay. We enjoyed our week in camp."
