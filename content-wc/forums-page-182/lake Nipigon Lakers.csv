5676498,1K1MOA,2017-07-20 17:44:00,90,"I spent a few days fishing upper and lower twin during the 1st week of September two years ago. It was worth getting up early, we had a great bite up to about 7:00 - 7:30AM. After that, we had to work harder, covering a much larger area. Did pretty good early evening, but couldn't figure out a night bite to save our lives. On Lower Twin, the northern lake, the southwest shoreline, above the river to Upper, was the most productive fishing along the weed edges between 10 - 15. The windward side of the islands also produce some really nice fish. On upper, which is the southern lake, again the islands produced nicely with wind that are close to deeper water, and the east bay, which has really deep water, was good during the day working some of the deep drops between 15 - 40 feet. We also hit fish that were suspending between 25 - 40' in 50 - 70' of water. Most success came with jigs, with a few of the suspending fish on deep diving firetiger body bait. Banged a very nice northern suspending as well. Oh, if you like whitefish, that is what you are marking in the 60 - 90' water most likely. They were delicious! They like the presentation super slow."

Take 801 from Bush Lake to Onaman River Resort on the Onanman River and boat out from there to Humboldt Bay. Just be sure you park in the designated parking area as the Owners at Onaman River Resort can be a little testy at times. As far as what to use, I would search up Moosebunk and send him a PM. He has posted many trips to the Lake and seems like he's happy to help. Good luck. We will be at Bush Lake Sept 8th for the week."
