A fly-in fishing trip is a must-do, bucketlist, amazing experience for 99% of those who do 'em! Make it happen man. If you ever need a hand sorting out a place feel free to shoot me a PM.Quote: Originally Posted by ShortlineBunk - thank you for sharing that, What a stellar read!

I was there, living it, it was real, write it how it happened with lots of pics and the reader should find themselves along for the trip. Been the same recipe for... 12 to 13 years or so. Always happy to hear readers say just what you said, that it was like you were there too.Quote: Originally Posted by kona77Bunk- Great report..

Had a good laugh when you described the reaction from your wife when you suggested a day of pike fishing. It is great to see a couple who both enjoy the outdoors!! Kona! If and when Brenda or I take a trip that is just for, or is planned to include pike, we generally enjoy pike fishing immensely. At the website there are a tonne of pike stories in the Travel and in the WarCanoe section. There will be many more oldies not yet re-edited to add to the WarCanoe in the future as well. Pike are a great sport... however... she and I if given the choice would rather fish big lakers on big laker lakes. The pike at Bear are generally smaller and skinnier than other places I (we) might regularly fish. But it was funny, she actually made very valid points out there and outright won. We were just onto the plane leaving Bear when she asked about next years plans... and two weeks later, she's wanting to take on some extra work this fall to ensure anything is afforded. She's getting more hooked, and I love it! Quote: Originally Posted by martinbnsShowed the blog to my wife, she was impressed by your's.See Martin, she's wants a fly-in too. You two can do this!"
5698290,Moosebunk,2017-08-02 14:29:00,211,"We traveled north to an old, cozy and comfortable fishing lodge just a few miles south of the Arctic Circle. Some of Canada's final frontier, at a secluded area on immense Great Bear Lake, my wife Brenda and I were left for a week to fish and explore each day on our own. The land and sea, the wild life and the incredible numbers of lake trout, it is a trip any angler and outdoors man or woman will find interesting. Truly an amazing time for the two of us. Plenty of pictures to view, each big fish, beast and moment has been captured here...http://bunksoutdoorangle.com/exploring-legends-lake-trout-at-the-arctic-circle/Thanks for reading,Bunk"
5698506,hoppy63,2017-08-02 16:59:00,367,Great stuff. Jealous!
5699658,DeBo,2017-08-03 12:15:00,211,As always an amazing report! From a place on my radar to boot. Keep 'em coming!
5700546,That Minnesota guy,2017-08-03 19:39:00,8293,I'm scared to look at your report. The report on Nipigon still haunts me.
5700650,BrianE,2017-08-03 21:00:00,98,"Another fabulous write up Bunk keep up the great work, i never tire reading these. Thanks again. You are fortunate to have a lady that loves what you love. Can't believe how big those spoons are that you throw there, unreal and super cool. How heavy are they?"
5702234,Moosebunk,2017-08-04 18:24:00,211,"Ha! That place is haunting... has haunted me for years since first going. A good few giant beasts still left untouched in there. But go ahead, open this one report up and forget all about Nipigon for awhile. Quote: Originally Posted by BrianEAnother fabulous write up Bunk keep up the great work, i never tire reading these. Thanks again. You are fortunate to have a lady that loves what you love. Can't believe how big those spoons are that you throw there, unreal and super cool. How heavy are they?Past weekend, two days in a row, my wife wanted to tag along and muskie fish. She really enjoys BIG fish fishing, like muskie, lakers, sturgeon and fish like that. Was just telling her at dinner how much I appreciate her wanting to come along. As for the spoons... Eppinger's Husky Sr's are 3 ounces... I'm pretty sure. Their Jr's are 1.5. Up on Bear there's just no point in downsizing spoons when trolling. For casting, the 1.5 Jr's are better suited. Tightlines fellas, thanks for reading."
