5710546,DaBirdman,2017-08-09 19:27:00,164,I didn't want to hijack the other posters thread so I'm starting this one. Is there any regulation on how much bait you can bring across the border.... for crawlers and salted minnows? I've been googling and trying to find info but am not having much success. Anything that says you can cross with so many dozen per person or anything? Thanks!
5710746,Pooch,2017-08-09 20:35:00,4618,The last I heard was a limit of 120 salted minnows per person. Last year my buddies were asked that at the border. They had them bagged in a dozen per zip lock for easy counting and use. Border guys didn't check them after the question.Crawlers in bedding. No soil of any kind. I've never heard of any limit on crawlers.Border folks are looking for people who might be bringing in large amounts of bait then selling it is my guess.Pooch
5710906,DaBirdman,2017-08-09 21:21:00,164,Oh! Ok. So that's what those numbers were in the bait regs then. I kind of thought so but wasn't certain. Thanks for the response! Much appreciated.

As far as crawlers, keep the number reasonable in view of the number of people that you are traveling with and the length of your stay.Assuming that your group might be buying in Canada live minnows, live leeches or crawlers in soil, be certain to keep your receipt so that you can prove to a MNR officer that you purchased this bait in Canada.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

This year they didn't ask about any bait. They really didn't ask much at all. Crossed at International Falls. And, first time ever, there was no waiting line."

Next year we're doing a fly in and will bring at least a flat in, maybe more for 6 guys and one full week. Not sure yet if we'll do salted minnows or just order the live one's through the outfitter. Crawlers are a definite though."
