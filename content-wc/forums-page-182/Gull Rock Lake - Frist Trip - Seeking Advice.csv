1100110,Moondog,2009-04-25 19:23:00,362,"Thanks, we have fished there but thought you were talking about something different! You are right, no one goes in there much because it is relatively out of the way."
1100504,Classic Hack,2009-04-27 12:53:00,7,Thanks for the tips hips. We will give that a try!-CH
5701498,Guest,2017-08-04 09:29:00,0,Loved reading all the advice and was wondering if the same spots and techniques will work in September. I will be going there for the first time this September. Thanks for any advise given.
1097352,Blue Fin,2009-04-15 14:12:00,47,"I know that every year I go up to Canada I bring about 30 lbs of tackle and use a handfull of jigs, some tails, and a few other baits. Can someone help me slim down the tackle box. I need to get rid of a few trays in the ole softsider. Does anyone troll any raps?Also, one of the previous replies said there was still about 40 inches of ice on the lake. Is that normal or more than usual. And should I be concerned about our trip the week of May 30th? When is the opener up there?Thanks."
1097358,tackleman,2009-04-15 14:41:00,444,"I have talked to several people who pull hard baits and they have luck with them but with the rocks and reefs in some areas of the lake they tell me they snag quite a few and it could get expensive if you lose a few. spots like the flats and the gull rock are relatively rock free and you should be able to pull them in that area, but if you try around the boot you run a goood chance of losing tackle.today it is +15 celsius and the lake has turned from white to a grey colour, I guess that's from the slush underneath it. there is still a lot of ice and when I was in dryden yesterday the talk down there was it will be nip and tuck for opening day, that is May 17th this year. If you are coming on may 30 you should be alright. and hopefully the bite will be on."
1097378,Blue Fin,2009-04-15 15:32:00,47,So it sounds like most guys do the usual up there in puliing lindy's and jigging. Thanks for the info. I can't wait to get up there. It sounds like the quality of fish is quite a bit better than some of the other lakes that haven't had as tight of a slot as Gull Rock.
1097522,Guest,2009-04-15 22:55:00,0,"Hey Blue Fin, We go up to Gull Rock every other year and I love to try something different as well. You can certainly pull a rig all day like Tackleman or get vertical like Bud used to (still does on Red Lake) but if you have a good depth finder and come across active schools, nothing beats the action of taking a 1oz bottom bouncer, tying a 4-6 foot leader of spider wire and dragging a hard body behind. Not only will you cover more ground, if a newbie, but Gull Rock is know for large pike, not numerous, but large and the time of year you will be there, they should be post-spawn and looking for a easy meal going by. Use the bottom bouncers with 6-8 inches of wire to keep you from hanging the rocks. Good Luck...my off year...Craig"
1097624,Blue Fin,2009-04-16 09:49:00,47,Nice. Thanks for the info. 43 days until we head up. Can't wait.
1099046,Guest,2009-04-21 16:20:00,0,"Fished Gull, Two Island,Ranger and Keg. Lot's of places. My favorites are the gap going into Keg,the boot, across from three sisters and my super favorite is on Two Island to the right (as your going in) of north bay. There is an old logging road coming into the lake (has or had an small sign on it).Fished out from the reeds. Great catch and most of the time you have the area all to your self"
1099592,Blue Fin,2009-04-23 14:48:00,47,"Which bay is North Bay? If it is the one I think it is, are you fishing off of the point there, or more in the bay?"
1099603,Moondog,2009-04-23 15:32:00,362,You stole my question! Is it the bay on the left/north side just as you come in before the long canal?
1099997,Guest,2009-04-25 09:42:00,0,Blue Fin and Moondog: Two Island north bay is at the north end of the lake. As you come into 2island u'll pass a red bouy in the channel. Pass to the right of the 2 islands and continue to the north end of lake. The bay goes back into some reeds and is a northern pike factory. If u like to fish northern.The camp back in the sixties was Stewart's. The owner favorite place was north bay. He said cast with large yellow jigs until you're tired and then cast some more. It worked.
1100079,new hips,2009-04-25 17:06:00,498,"That time of year, go to any incoming stream or to the mouth before it hits main lake. If any weeds, run a shad rap over the tops. Also look for any area were the wind is funneling through a narrows. If you can find any incoming water just cast any minnow lure up into current areas, sit just off to the side of the hole. Or just a jig and plastic tail should work."
1092905,tackleman,2009-03-31 16:43:00,444,"you're right it is a sanctuary until June 14th , I forgot the sanctuary had been extended for 2 weeks. thank goodness other posters were on the ball to correct my error."
1093284,Guest,2009-04-01 18:09:00,0,"So billy you were the guy in the alumacraft I seen up in ranger bay june 10th last year ha ha. Heading home in 2 weeks got to stop by Sault Ste. Marie to see Ryan he got stationed there on a ice breaker. Can't wait to get back to Red Lake it's getting to hot down here. To the guy thats fishing Gullrock for the first time. The bay that golden hooks is in is good also the channel where gullrock goes into keg is good. Gullrock is a great walleye lake you will not have any trouble catching fish, I like to troll Gullrock tackle spinners (hammered brass) in 6-12ft. of water to find them and then sit on them and jig(orange) with a minnow."
1093293,tackleman,2009-04-01 18:53:00,444,"thanks for the plug on the spinners Bud, getting snow today and we had 4 Inches yesterday, calling for more tomorrow.the registrations opened today at 8am for the fall classic, i was there at 8:15 and had to stand in line for 45 minutes. I got Roy Lemay registered and he was #40, I took the second flight and was 53 that's right behind Ian and his partner. They sent out an email tonight telling thecommittee members that boat 64 was the last one registered today,got your registration in yet?"
1093379,Tonyo,2009-04-02 05:34:00,212,"Classic Hack, You will enjoy this lake. I have fished it for 10 or so years in late may and early june and have always had a great trip. I believe the fishing has continued to improve over the years. Our numbers have consistantly gone up and the sizes have increased too. Our group will be on Gullrock May 30 to June 6. If you run into an older Crestliner white/tan from Missouri stop by and say hi. Enjoy your trip. Tonyo"
1093438,Classic Hack,2009-04-02 09:25:00,7,"Thanks budm! We will make sure to try the channel and gullrock bay. I appreciate the advice.Tonyo, we will keep an eye out for the ol' Crestliner. Thanks much...and good luck to ya!- Hack"
1093539,Guest,2009-04-02 16:22:00,0,"Billy, #70 for me I just got signed up. This is freakin crazy in another week the Classic won't have any opening. See you in a couple weeks hope I can get into my place on Mneely bay. Whens the corperate magnet from Minniesota coming up?"
1093562,tackleman,2009-04-02 17:23:00,444,"I am hoping to get out and try my luck ice fishing this weekend to see where those elusive walleye are hiding , if I can turn the auger through the 4 feet of ice.Hey bud , the corporate magnate is coming for May 29th and staying 2 weeks. we should do a bar b q. tto start the season."
1094093,Guest,2009-04-04 18:03:00,0,"Sounds good Bill, I hope the ice is off by June I just got off the phone with a Red Laker and he sald 4 foot of ice also."
1094175,Tonyo,2009-04-05 07:20:00,212,Tackleman will you give us a quick update if you make it out on the ice this weekend? I am curious on the amount of snow and ice you guys have. We make our trip to Gullrock every year the last couple of days of May and the first full week of June. Last year was a fairly late ice out and it looks as though you are headed there again this year. Just curious as I sit in Missouri and count the days until we get to fish Gullrock and enjoy a week in Canada. Tonyo
1094997,tackleman,2009-04-07 15:28:00,444,I didn't make it out on the weekend but I talked to a guy today who said there is about 6 inches of snow on the ice and about 40 + inches of good ice. It is startingto warm up so hopefully it will be gone before opening day.
1092774,Classic Hack,2009-03-31 11:43:00,7,"Greetings!I'm a first time poster...so let me preface this by saying I apologize if I ask questions that are against the secrect code of chat rooms. With that said, I've ejoyed reading a few threads related to Gull Rock Lake, as I will be heading up there in 2 months for the first time.Just looking for any helpful tips in finding some big walleyes in late May early June. I was thinking at this time our best bet might be trying to work weed beds in shallow water...but as a novice, I'm looking for any help.I've heard about First/Round Island, 3 Sisters, Fisherman's point, and Boot Island, but I wasn't sure if those places are good spots in early June.We will be staying at the south end of the lake. So again if anyone has suggestions on bait/tackle/colors or places to try...I'm all ears. Here is a map if anyone would like to refert to a certain reference point:http://www.goldenhookcamp.com/lakemap.htmlThanks much and good luck to everyone.Classic Hack."
1092782,Blue Fin,2009-03-31 11:51:00,47,"Good questions. I am actually going to be up there around the same time and am seeking some pointers. Time of day that fish like to bite, bad rocks to avoid, what method is best to fish, bait/tackle tips, and so on."
1092829,tackleman,2009-03-31 13:41:00,444,"I have been going over my records for the first week of June and it looks like I have caught walleye all over the lake in depths from 15 to 25 feet.I usually use a minnow and a spinner (hammered brass, hammered silver, pink, pink&white, black&white, purple chartreuse) almost any colour works. Lots of camp guests use jigs tipped with minnows or leeches and worms.as for your map, keep it for reference but you will see that most areas that have fish are being fished by several boats. It appears to me that when you see a flotilla of fishing boats in one spot most people go and join them and share results and pick up pointers. I'm sure there will be some who don't appreciate you coming into the group, but I can guarantee you that is the minority, not the majority.I always enjoy meeting new people on the lake and sharing secrets and even tackle.Gullrock is a fantastic lake to fish, if you don't get anything here, you cant get anything anywhere.I fish almost every day when I'm not working and very seldom go home skunked. (almost never) but there are times when the may fly hatch is on the fishing is really tough and you have to adapt and change your approach and baits to entice those darn fish.If you are staying at golden hook, Bill should be able to mark up a map for you to start out with. He runs a good camp with good equipment.If you see a blue and gold alumacraft with a top on it come by and say hi, I''ll be happy to see you"
1092839,Classic Hack,2009-03-31 14:05:00,7,"Much appreciated tackleman. We will be staying at Golden Hook, so like you menitioned...hopefully Bill will help us out with some starting spots. I've fished Pakwash for 10 years, but I've heard a lot of good things about Gull Rock so I'm really excited about giving it a try.Are there any dangerous rocks that are unmarked?Also, I keep reading about Burnt Isand...can you explain where that is on the map?Thanks again for the help. Fishing a new lake is always tough for an average to below average fisherman (gulp), so I appreciate the feedback!-Classic Hack"
1092855,Moondog,2009-03-31 14:48:00,362,Nothing tuff about fishing Gull Rock in June and the lake is easily navigable with few hidden unmarked rocks. Bill will be able to tell you anything you need to know. What worked at Pakwash will were there......I promise.
1092867,Classic Hack,2009-03-31 15:14:00,7,I appreciate the note Moondog.
1092875,tackleman,2009-03-31 15:27:00,444,"Look at your map and find the boot (actuallly looks like a boot) along the top shoreline. the island off the toe is burnt island.If you follow the river out of two island lake then hug the right shoreline you will see a point that says beach , keep right and the island infront of you on the right is round island.past round island where there is a fish in the water on themap is ""the gullrock"" that is a large flat area that has the gullrock rock pile on the top of it. this drops off in several areas to 40+ feet and this is usually good fishing.Past that area is the 3 sisters and almost directly across from that is fisherman's point. the area toward ranger lake from just past 3 sisters is a fish sancturary and fishing is not allowed past that point until june 1 so it should be open for you . A lot of people go into ranger lake but i haven't for about 15 years since there never is a need to. it might be a nice trip to go up and learn the lake. ranger lake is 9 feet deep at its deepest and in the summer it is a large bed of weeds but it is the nursery for the walleye in the spring.On the map you will notice the claybanks and a northern in the water. this is a large flat area that goes from 9 to 29 feet at the dropoffs, you will see boats in this area all the time and I have got some dandy fish there.there is a ton of fish to be caught and enjoyed eating but remember, the camps of the Gullrock area have a policy of no fish over 18"" brought into camp unless you plan on mounting it. (but with measurements you don't even need to kill one these days) . The largest walleye I got on gullrock was a 29 1/2 inch off my dock 3 years ago 2 days before the lake froze for the winter, but there are lots of reports of fish over 30 inches each year . There are good sized northerns in the 40+ inch range too. I've also caught whitefish, perch and rock bass and in the spring you may get the odd lake trout that has made it's way down under the ice. 3 years ago I got a 37 1/2 inch laker in 18 feet of water on the heel side of the boot. so you never know what you got until you see itCripes, I'm getting excited just writing this!Anyway it will be a while for the open water as it is just above zero celsius and the weather guy is calling for 5 inches of snow. (and there is still the 4 feet of ice to lose)"
1092884,Classic Hack,2009-03-31 16:00:00,7,Great information...much appreciated!I can't wait to try multiple spots and slowly get famililar with the lake.Thanks again for the help.
1092885,Moondog,2009-03-31 16:02:00,362,"FYI......according to http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR_E001324.pdf......Ranger Lake, Ranger Bay and the North Bay on Gull Rock is closed to fishing this year from April 1-June 14, 2009. It would be VERY wise to know exactly where the line is drawn on North Bay because we see MNR and POLICE on the lake all the time (boats and planes) and have been boarding a few times as well. It would not be good to be ""accidentally"" caught in the fish sanctuary. If you think your personal wealth has tanked now.....just wait until the DNR guys get you!"
1092890,Classic Hack,2009-03-31 16:11:00,7,I'll make a note to have Bill (at Golden Hook) update our group on where the sanctuary starts/ends. Thanks...we certainly do not need any more hidden expenses.
