5711074,MrSimon,2017-08-10 05:37:00,922,"Not true. I've crossed plenty of times when they didn't ""run"" anything through the system ... they just look at the passports, ask a few questions, and waive you through .... less than a minute at the booth. Also, I've crossed with a friend who has a few ugly things on his record. He was terrified they wouldn't let him in. We breezed through without a word about his record. I've also spent over an hour inside while they ran complete checks on everyone in the group and asked us a million incredibly detailed questions."
5711386,Obabikon,2017-08-10 07:29:00,2370,"Again... we ALL have criminal records. Some are cleaner than others. Most of us have had speeding or parking tickets (that is on your record). They will not deny you entry for something you were not found guilty of. You might have to answer a few questions, but the fact that the charge happened... and then it was dropped within 2 days... shouldn't be a problem. Just make sure you bring anything you have that shows the matter was dropped, and he was innocent. I can accuse you of robbery, state I have proof, you be charged... and be totally innocent. That will not prevent you from traveling internationally."
5711602,spotter,2017-08-10 08:41:00,178,if u have a criminal record like a dwi you wont get across i kn that for a fact.... i have a friend from the south that was denied they ran his passport and found it and denied him entry
5712642,Obabikon,2017-08-10 17:29:00,2370,"I get it. DWI's are an issue... technically you can still get across with one, but that is NOT AT ALL what this guy is saying. Hypothetical... if you were charged with a DWI, but found innocent when you contested it.... you would not have a DWI CONVICTION on your record. Therefore, Canada would not view you as a felon. That's the key here. The original poster stated that all charges were dropped within a couple days of them being filed. That means he was never convicted, and is not a felon. He was just accused of something."
5712890,biggamefisher,2017-08-10 19:28:00,540,Since when are speeding or parking tickets criminal offences? I don't have a criminal record so there goes your theory!
5712898,Bayou,2017-08-10 19:31:00,52,"Since I know a little bit about this in Ohio I will add. When your CCH is ran (criminal history) it will show what you have been charged with. It will state held or conviction, doesn't help you much but concerning Canada though. When criminal charges are placed upon someone in Ohio. prior charges does impact the level of an offense as in whether held or convicted. OVI (formerly DWI, DUI)in Ohio is considered criminal and traffic violations are not (speeding etc.). And then there is expungement. Good luck to your friend."
5713002,muskyman73,2017-08-10 20:11:00,401,"Be truthful, honest and forthright and he will get in. Have your paperwork too. Trust me , we have people in our group, that uh.........well lets just say questionable at a moments glance........ and we make it across with no issues."
5713066,Shortline,2017-08-10 20:38:00,234,"Partially true under certain situations. But....... Not always. I have a DWI conviction from 1991. I have averaged probably 15-20 crossings per year since then, and have maintained an RABC permit as well for nearly all of those years. I have never been questioned about it, never been turned away, and never paid any fees to be allowed in. Granted, they were not nearly as stringent prior to 9-11-01, but to make a blanket statement that a DWI will prevent you from getting across as pure fact is simply not accurate. It is worth noting that I have only two convictions since then. One was a speeding ticket and the other a seat belt violation. I guess Canada does not view me as a threat(and for that I am thankful)"
5709402,Jarbear,2017-08-09 11:01:00,24,"I have seen comments on crossing the border with a DUI. But I have a situation involving a person that wants to go to Canada with us this year. He has been there before, but it has been about 5 years. Since then, he was charged with two felony's. The matter was dropped two days after the filing and he never even had to go to court. The problem is that he now has a criminal record. In reading the various information from official Canada agencies, it looks like the fact that he has the entries, and no convictions, he could be not deemed admissible to enter. Just wondering what your thoughts or experience has been. Will he be turned away at the border?. I would hate to waste everyone time and ruin a trip. Thanks for any input."
5709410,martinbns,2017-08-09 11:02:00,1520,"If there were no proceedings he should be ok, but I would call the Canadian Customs servicehttp://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/contact/bis-sif-eng.html"
5709426,Jarbear,2017-08-09 11:05:00,24,Thanks. I tried them. They will not comment and referred me to IRCC.
5709762,MrSimon,2017-08-09 13:05:00,922,"They have the right and power to decline any visitor entrance to their country for any reason. It's that simple. However, there are numerous examples of folks with records getting in with no problem. The chances of getting in depend HEAVILY on the officer on duty when you pull up to the booth. The only way to know for sure is to try. Be polite, calm, answer all the questions honestly, and follow all the rules. You will most likely be fine."
5709770,ziggyzag,2017-08-09 13:14:00,125,Well I can tell you for years I crossed the boarder without any issues then I was questioned about an incident I had in my past (10 years earlier) while crossing to go to a meeting at a Ford Plant even though I was never charged for this incident the local courts never put any disposition or should I say the outcome in the paper work so it showed up when they did a better check when the send you inside. I needed to have my local court system fax paper work to the boarder stating that I was never charged and the case was dismissed. Since then I get pulled inside almost every time I cross and I show them the paper work and I am on my way. My suggestion would be for your guy to get the paper work from his local court system before crossing just to be safe.
5709794,That Minnesota guy,2017-08-09 13:23:00,8293,Make him drive separately and leave his vehicle in I Falls. If he gets turned away he can go home and you continue with your trip.
5710090,spotter,2017-08-09 15:23:00,178,he wont get across trust me its the law if u have a criminal record u will b declined.. it will show up as soon as they check his passport..
5710242,Obabikon,2017-08-09 16:50:00,2370,"The above comment is 100% false. If charges were DROPPED... he will get in. If he has ANY paperwork on the matter, he should bring it with him. He is NOT a felon. He may face some questioning, and just like ANYONE... it will be the officer's choice to accept or deny entry. Honesty and patience will get you in. Plan to spend a little extra time at the border... if you get straight in, great. Just don't expect something to be simple. You guys have NOTHING to hide, so don't act like it."
