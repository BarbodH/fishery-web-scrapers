Not too long of a line but was somewhat surprised to see the fee to cross the bridge was increased to $7.00 While waiting in line, we talked about how many tims we have crossed the border at IF since we started going to Canada in the late 1970s. We both agreed that it's tim to try new things on our trips and not always eat at the same restaurants on our drive up or stay at the same hotel in IF. We were thinking of perhaps trying the Baudette crossing next year. A quick look at the road map tells me this crossing site might add a good hour or more to our travel time - we live in the Chicago area. Having not ever been to Baudette, I have no idea about hotels to stay at or local restaurants. Any suggestions about our possibly crossing at Baudette versus IF?"
5703578,Remi,2017-08-05 21:00:00,41,"We crossed at Baudette for the first time ever (about 20 trips to Canada). We stayed at the AmericInn (very nice compared to what we used to stay). International Falls - all hotels were booked up. Crossed at 7:30am, no line, no bridge fee, and then went down a few miles and traveled north, our destination was near Vermillion Bay, but thought to see a new part of Canada. Hwy 71 north, see parts of Lake of the Woods and Nester Falls, very nice road conditions and found it pleasant to look at new places."
5703666,fishpoop,2017-08-06 00:20:00,630,"Coming from Chicago crossing at Baudette is most likely going out of your way unless you're headed to the Lake of The Woods area or north of Kenora. If you're headed to Lac Seul, Wabigoon, etc, you're better off crossing at The Falls and dealing with the wait in line and fee. If you're headed to the west side of Eagle Lake I would consider crossing in Baudette but if going to the east side I'd cross at The Falls. Last time I came back from Eagle Lake I had a 3 hour wait in Fort Francis to cross and Hwy 502 was in bad shape that year. Had I known that I'd have come down Hwy 71 and crossed in Baudette as that would have been faster for me despite the extra miles. But that is kind of a gamble. I've never had a wait more than 5 minutes or so at Baudette as there is very little traffic. Reports say that they're planning on building a new bridge in Baudette but I don't know when that's going to happen. Sorry, can't help with hotels or restaurants as I never stayed there. They do have a nice grocery store near the crossing and a gas station 2 blocks from the bridge to top off your tanks before crossing, if that helps any."
5703714,btyreprich,2017-08-06 04:33:00,1067,"In looking at the map, I can see that crossing at Baudette to head up to Ear Falls is out of the way. Looks like the road to Baudette from say Duluth is not a straight shot either."
5703794,LOWrider,2017-08-06 06:33:00,40,"We cross at both crossings regularly up to Morson. Agree Baudette really out of your way. We go Baudette route if we suspect a long wait in IF. CBP posts wait times for all border crossings on their website, not sure how accurate they are.Crossed at IF yesterday at 10AM. about a 20 minute wait. Nothing to add an hour or more to your trip over."
5703802,jimirjr,2017-08-06 06:33:00,1149,$7.... WTF? If You have 4 Guys in the vehicle... It's ONLY $1.75 each.... Small fee to pay considering the cost of the rest of the trip..
5703810,That Minnesota guy,2017-08-06 06:43:00,8293,Probably paying the Illinois Tollway more then the 7 bucks at the bridge.
5703826,port1042,2017-08-06 06:50:00,509,"I'm not suggesting this is faster but it is an interesting option. A couple of years ago for a change of pace we crossed at Pigeon River and spent the night in Thunder Bay. This adds about an hour and a half or so to a trip to Vermilion Bay from Duluth. Good roads, no tolls, and lot of hotels to choose from in Thunder Bay. There are also places to stay in MN along the lake. Hwy. 61 runs along Lake Superior from Duluth to Grand Portage and affords some remarkable views of the lake along with some nice roadside parks and light houses. I'd recommend this route for a change of pace but not to save a $7 toll!"
5703842,The tank,2017-08-06 07:04:00,340,We cross at Baudette every year. The roads from Duluth to Baudette are all nice. We take 35s-2-46-71-1-72. It's a nice scenic drive. Don't have all the stop lights in Duluth this way. We always stay at the Walla Walla inn in Rainy River. We eat in Baudette than cross. Get our booze at the lcbo and license at the gas station so we're ready to go in the morning.
