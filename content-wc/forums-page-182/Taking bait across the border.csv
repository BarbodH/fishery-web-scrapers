Last year, the Border Services Officers were strictly enforcing the limit of 120 minnows per person. I am pretty sure that you are NOT allowed to legally take wax worms into Canada. I was once refused and had to walk my waxies back across the bridge to International Falls. The lady at the US Customs office just smiled. I suspect she had a son or husband that fished. This was many years ago and I haven't taken wax worms with me since.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
