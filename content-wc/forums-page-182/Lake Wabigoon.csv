5703466,fishmanric,2017-08-05 19:32:00,219,Dinorwic Lake is producing huge numbers of fish. Lots of 14-16 all over the lake. The new slot is going to make this a trophy lake in a few years. Lots of pike in the 32-41 inch range. We were catching 60 by noon everyday and many more in the evening. Even with four hot days in a row we smoked them. One morning we caught 27 in the first hour alone and one other boat did better. Everyone in camp had pretty much the same success.
5706282,Skywagon,2017-08-07 17:16:00,1106,"Too bad the natives have a gill net setup under the ice all winter on Dinorwic, then have gill nets set in the narrows of the spawning sanctuary in the spring. They are allowed to catch (kill) all the fish they want, any time, anywhere, any size (the net does not discriminate), no restrictions because they are natives. The new slot limit will not help that, very sad for the lake system."
5085825,fire305,2016-08-27 10:39:00,4,Looking for a fishing report from Wabigoon in Dryden. Also looking for advice on what depth and type of tackle is working up there. This is only my second year up there and I know there's bigger fish there and I'd like to find them. Last year we did okay but nothing of size to speak of. Anybody been to the adjoining lakes? I would like to try them but not sure how good of a waterway there is to get there. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks in advance.
5086297,Skywagon,2016-08-27 17:01:00,1106,"I live on the system but rarely fish it, the exception has been the last two weeks, as I had company and ended up fishing Dinorwic a few times in between trips to other lakes to keep the company occupied. We had a tough time finding any walleye of eater size or larger on Dinorwic, the ones we did catch were in 15'-20' of water, what were biting was crappie, caught a lot, all nice, if you are into that, it would be a good place to go. Hopefully someone else will have had better luck with walleye lately and can chime in with some recommendations. If you find fishing is slow on Wabigoon, try a day trip to another lake. We caught lots of nice fish (as always) on two recent trips to Lac Seul, one out of Deception Bay and the other out of Scout Bay, each are on opposite ends of the lake. Another option is Eagle lake, it is a good walleye lake, not too far from Dryden and I have heard the fishing has been really good lately. Have fun on your trip."
5086353,fire305,2016-08-27 17:56:00,4,"Love the crappies. Never fished for crappies last year but we are going to try this year. Any information would be appreciated. Depth, weeds, rocks?"

I've participated in the Walleye Masters tournament the last 2 years and have been worse than 100th place both times haha but there's some days it's easy. I mostly fish underwater humps with minnows, worms or leeches. I'm pretty amateur though. Hoping to break the 100th place mark at this years walleye masters"

5603601,fishmanric,2017-06-12 05:52:00,219,Report from Bonny Bay this past week included 5 walleyes caught over 30 inches with the biggest at 34. This system has been producing big fish this year.
5603833,Rock Lobstar1,2017-06-12 07:26:00,134,I saw in their Facebook page a picture of a 14 pounder caught through the ice over the winter.
5605017,thundereyes,2017-06-12 15:50:00,12,"Just got back from the Goon and our group of 4 had 2 of the +30"" walleyes. Caught lots of fish over the 22"" and lots of 14"" to 16"" fish but had a hard time locating the 17"" to 18"" . Fishing 6 to 10 ft of water around islands jigging and throwing crankbaits. Len and Nancy at Bonny Bay great hosts as usual. Good luck"
