Also water quality as far as drinking was thinking boiling and perhaps a filter pitcher.all in all non of it matters just excited to finally get the opportunity to fish Canadian water and spend a week with the wife on our own private lake .thanks in advance for any info"
5679050,NY Walleye1,2017-07-22 12:35:00,13,Fished Charlotte one day only. Some of the fishing questions I can't answer. There are big pile on that lake and big walleye. I would recommend having them fly in five gallons of water ahead of time. I wouldn't drink the water even with a boil. Weather may play a favor in late September. That far north it may get really cold. Been there in July and it went down to 35 degrees one night.
5679378,a3dad,2017-07-22 17:19:00,115,Bring your water or have AT fly it in ahead of time. You're not used of the water and not worth having the runs all week. September should be a blast. Enjoy!

I agree with getting the 5 gal jug from AT its like $30 cdn, and they don't count it has part of your weight. I live in Rochester and took us about 14 hrs with several stops. From Ottawa to Clova is about 5.5 hrs. The gravel road from Mont-St-Michel is in good shape and you should be able to manage 45-50 mph. Washboards cab=n be bone rattling. Although its a wide road, the edges are soft sand and can easily pull you off the road. If its a dry day, take care when you meet lumber trucks the dust can be like a white out. On hills stay to the side and not middle they fly. The restaurant and hotel take credit cards, put all your gas on your credit card as that will give you your best exchange rate. Mont-Laurier is the last big town you will go thru. Hope you have a great trip and safe travels.. Doug"

We'll be happy to mark up your map with our productive spots and discuss what lures, presentations, and colors worked for us. We are bass fishermen, so pike will be our primary target. We have been visiting this site for walleye tips because of the wealth of knowledge the experienced fishermen on this site volunteer. You may also want to do a search for trip preparation since this will be your first fly in, ours too! There's a lot of information from fishermen who have done fly ins for decades. One last point, we are going to spend some time chasing walleyes, so maybe we'll be have some decent intel for you and your wife. Safe travels. Greg"
5682218,potsie225,2017-07-24 16:41:00,41,"If the walleyes are anything like Hebert they will hit jigs 3/8 to 1/2 if windy, using a full nightcrawler. Worm harness all so will work, orange and green. doug"
5683090,octanehi5,2017-07-25 06:59:00,1104,"Good luck on Charlotte,Bringing water is a must,500 night crawlers,1/4 to 1/2 oz jigs, Braided line.Pike as well as the walleyes are good size,It has been a C & R lake for a long time. Paddletails ,Crank baits work as well.the worse the weather gets the better the bite. You may not even see 60 degrees during the day,and will be below freezing some nights.make sure camp is stocked with fire wood,Dress in layers,good water proof rain gear full suit. Bring a few water bouy makers once you find fish you can always locate. Easy lake to navigate,you see the whole lake all the time.Have a great time,report when you get back octanehi5"
