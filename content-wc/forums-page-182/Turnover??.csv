The bigger pike and muskies typically moved back to the shallow, green weeds about 10-14 days before turnover""Ok,....being a newbie,...what does ""TURNOVER"" mean? I feel goofy askin this,....but maybe it will give y'all a good laugh at my expense!! Chuckbearfvr13"
5708210,MN_Moose,2017-08-08 19:09:00,964,Big deep lakes develop a thermocline where the water stratifies. The water on the bottom is colder and stays there until the water on top gets colder and then flips over and the bottom water is warmer than the surface water thus turns over. Occurs in fall.

5708402,BornToFish,2017-08-08 21:05:00,1224,"Greetings,The MN Moose gave a good description of the process called turnover. I've encountered turnover on Perrault Lake as early as the middle of September. There have been some years when turnover took place well after I returned home in very early October. I believe a number of factors play into turnover: reduced daytime solar heating due to shorter days, cold nights, wind and overall cooler daytime temperatures.The thermocline is a range in depth along the water column where there is a dramatic change in water temperature. For example, I recorded the following water temperatures on Perrault Lake in mid-August several years ago: 65 degrees F. at a depth of 24 fow and 57 degrees F. at a depth of 28 fow. Thus, the thermocline was at 26 fow on that particular day.The only way to know for sure when turnover is taking place is to measure the water temperature as a function of depth in the water column. Turnover is characterized by the absence of a temperature gradient. The water often becomes very dirty looking and is accompanied by a sulfur smell when the lake turns over.Water below the thermocline is quite low in dissolved oxygen. Water above the thermocline is normally well-oxygenated since there is considerable mixing of this water due to waves. Some species of fish require a relatively high level of dissolved oxygen to be comfortable. Thus, species such as muskies and walleyes are generally found above the thermocline. Other species of fish (e.g. ciscoes and whitefish) can tolerate water with lower levels of dissolved oxygen, and are often found below the thermocline. Thus, the thermocline can be used to ""box in"" the fish's location during the summer months.MN_Moose pointed out that during the autumn, the water above the thermocline cools below the temperature of the water below the thermocline. When this happens, the water above the thermocline sinks since it's density is greater than the warmer water below the thermocline.It doesn't take long after turnover for all the water in the lake to become essentially the same in terms of temperature and dissolved oxygen. The fish are typically no longer ""boxed in"" as they can be anywhere. The fish will view the water to be the same everywhere.I have noticed in Perrault Lake that the weeds begin dying off in earnest during early September, often just before the lake turns over in autumn. Finding three stalks of green weeds in close proximity to one another can be like finding a gold mine. Baitfish get funneled into ever smaller patches of green weeds as the weeds die off. The large predators normally have this phenomenon figured out and take advantage of it! Thus, I regularly casted the shoreline weed beds during the middle of the afternoon in September, in search of the three strands of green weeds. My personal best pike and muskies were caught this way.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
