512240,Walley Guide,2001-05-04 04:46:00,67,"I need some more information for my trip to Canada this spring. I heard there is a restriction on the amount of fuel that can be taken accross the border for this season....I have taken 20 to 30 gallons extra for my boat in the past years with no problem. Is this going to be a problem this year? I know the price will be high, but I don't want to fill up and haul all the weight if I don't really need to....With the exchange rate it cost may be close to the same.Second question...What is the price of a case (24 pack) of beer in Canada? I know we are allowed (1) case duty free, but what about the cost in Canada? I read the earlier post and folks were saying in the 30 dollar (can) range. Using the exchange rate, wouldn't it be about the same to buy in Canada? Maybe I'm missing something.....I'm trying to make sure I exchange enough cash to cover the costs on the trip...I'm going on a fishing trip not a drinking trip, but just wondered what would be the best solution. Thanks in advance for the help, everyone on this board has always been very helpful... I am trying to lighten the load for the trip as much as possible to save fuel as well as wear and tear on my fishing rig...Thanks again, Walley"

512243,Guest,2001-05-04 07:24:00,0,"Walley:With regards to restrictions on bringing in gas, I called Canadian Customs and nothing has changed for this year. However, how much gas you can bring is not specified in any regulation and is left to the discretion of the customs agent. Essentially, you can safely bring in what you can justify for your own personal needs. You can call (204)-983-3500 or (506)-636-5064 to verify this information. These are not toll free numbers.With regards to the cost of buying gas at home or here in Canada, I provide the following data:Current Cdn $/US $ exchange rate 4 May 01 1.53 Gas is sold in Canada in litres not gallons 1 US gallon equals 3.78541 litres1 Canadian or Imperial gallon equals 4.54609 litresTherefore, 1 US gallon is 0.8326 of a Cdn gallonCost per litre (Cdn $) for regular unleaded is $0.80 Therefore, cost of 1 Cdn gallon (4.54 litres) is $3.64 Cost of 1 US gallon in Cdn dollars is $3.03 Equivalent cost of 1 US gal in US $ is $1.98 Middle octane goes for about 85 cents/litre while high octane costs 90 cents per litre. Hope this data helps you decide whether to bring gas or buy it here.With regards to beer prices, most non-premium Cdn beers cost about $32 Cdn/case of 24. Premium beers run between $32 and $40 per case.Enjoy your stay in Canada and ""Good Fishing"". Jay"

If the extra cans are in the boat, you are telling the truth!! I have brought in an extre 50 gallons as the gas I have previously bought from the one resort always seemed to have moisture in it. It comes from the condensation in their tanks. It happens and I don't blame them for it, but I would rather not have it in my motor!!! Take what you want and if you are reguired to pay some duty, it's not that bad. Good luck FISHING....Kaz"
