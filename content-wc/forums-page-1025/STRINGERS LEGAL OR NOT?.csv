512238,Kaz,2001-05-04 14:01:00,643,"Keith: I would be very careful about using a stringer. As I see it, you are NOT allowed to have a live fish in the boat.. If they consider a fish ""In tow"" alive and in the boat, well, you would be in violation. They, the canadian wardens, want you to kill the fish you keep and I don't think they allow culling. Good luck FISHING...Kaz"
512239,Frank from TBay,2001-05-04 15:08:00,312,There are a few lakes where stringers are illegal that I know of. Lake Nipigon is one. There is not as far as I know a rule limiting the use of stringers in your fishing area. Check with OMNR COs to be 100% correct. I always get the COs name when I ask any questions and write down the day and time when I talked to him. Saves a lot of grief if there is a misunderstanding.Good luck..........Frank
