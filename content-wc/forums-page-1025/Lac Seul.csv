I am making my second trip to Goose Bay Camp in the NW section of the lake at the end of May and am wondering in what part of the lake the Chamberlain Narrows are located. If not readily accessible from GBC, what spots that early in the season would one recommend? Presentation tips would be appreciated too."

I've fished there several times and it is great fishing. One of the nice things about Chamerlin Narrows is there is no big water to cross once you are out there. We never go more than 12 miles from camp. June fishing is excellent, but the weather usually sucks. I especially like to fish there in August. We usually get stable warm weather and the W's are glued to the major points and reefs. Northern fishing is also good. I also like the Ear Falls area. I've fished there 7 or 8 times. Stayed at Goose Bay about 8 years ago. Always had good fishing in June, but, again I started going up in August. Fishing is good and the weather is much better. However, we have to go to Steamboat or McKenzie Bays for the better fishing. Give Chamberlin a try. I think you will be happy you did. TGG"
