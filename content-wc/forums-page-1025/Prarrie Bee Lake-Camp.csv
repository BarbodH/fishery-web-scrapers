Where do you fish in the lake, what types of bait/ lures do you use. Any info would be helpfull ....positive and negitive, but please give your reasoning with it. Thanks"
512168,Guest,2001-04-28 14:44:00,0,"MK; The camp was sold to a local couple (Tom & Georgia Lee O'Shaunassey) in 1999. I've been going there with a group the last 4 years and again this year in July. The camp is much as you remember it, I suppose, and it's been well maintained. Rates are about $375 Canadian including boat and motor-you pay the gas. We fish mostly with crawlers on jigs or crawler harnesses/bottom bouncers for the walleye. Chatreuse, 1/8-1/4 oz jigs with or without plastic, fished vertically in the deeper water and pitched in the shallows work well. We haven't used minnows or leeches much because we've been catching 'eyes with crawlers. The pike will hit almost anything although large minnow on harnesses work well. I still haven't figured out the whitefish, but I catch them accidently now and then. The walleyes are on the flats (6-10 feet)early and late or all day if it's overcast. We get them in the deeper water during the day. The outpost cabin is nearer to the deep water and the main camp is near most of the flats and some deep water. Let me know if there is anything else I can help you with. Chuck C."

The new owners are very hospitable (as were the previous owners), cabins are decent and being upgraded regularly.I agree with Chuck on the preferred lures and baits- jigs/crawlers with chartreuse or orange tails. The most consistently productive times are evening hours, and there are lots of rock piles and reefs within a couple of miles of the camp where the walleye hold during the evening. You might want to check out their web site if you haven't already done so: http://www.duenorth.net/prairiebeecamps/.Good luck. SEnd another post if you need any more info."
