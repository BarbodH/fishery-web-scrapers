512199,MNBS,2001-05-01 08:07:00,13,Here is a web site to check out. http://www.siouxlookout.com/business...ml#Hotel/Motel Bed & BreakfastThe site lists phone numbers. I have stayed at the Lamplight and at the Sunset Inn. The Sunset Inn is right next to a bar/rest that has good food. You can just walk there.Enjoy your tripBob
512200,Kaz,2001-05-01 13:08:00,643,"Bob has it right....We stayed at the Lamplighter. Sunsets is good too. But a word of caution to those who have a boat parked outside in their lots..We had a kid trying to remove a kicker motor off one of our boats. The alarm went off and they vanished, we still have the motor. Park so you can see your rig through your room window..Good luck FISHING....Kaz"
512201,Guest,2001-05-01 15:33:00,0,"Kaz,Just out of curosity, which motel did this incident take place at? Have stayed at both many times without any problems, knock on wood. Thanks.Remember to keep your eyes (and ears) open and your feet dry.S.v.m"
512205,DaveIN,2001-05-01 19:04:00,191,Who is your outfitter in Sioux Lookout. We have flown with Slate Falls Outfitters and they have a great bunkhouse for 20.00 per night.
512206,Guest,2001-05-02 05:24:00,0,Our outfitter is Knobby Clark.
512202,KnottyBuoy,2001-05-02 08:53:00,110,The Sunset is used by the government as sort of a housing unit for Indians that are being flown out for medical treatment.....We had friends stay there one night and they had a rain dance going on outside the room for the whole night.....LampLighter is farther out of town......maybe a bit more out of harms way.......
512203,Kaz,2001-05-02 10:08:00,643,"Stezo: We were at the Lamplighter when that happened. We reported it to the hotel and they seemed not to alarmed about it. It may of been an isolated case, but you can't be to careful. Good luck FISHING...Kaz"
512204,Guest,2001-05-02 15:04:00,0,"KnottyBuoy and Kaz,Thanks guys. I will always sleep with one eye open and a ear to the door, just like a gunslinger of old. Too bad there's not a secure place to park your valuables, but such is life. Good luck to both of you and the best of fishing.S.v.m"
