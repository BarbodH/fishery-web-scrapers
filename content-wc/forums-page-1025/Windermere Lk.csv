512136,Guest,2001-04-24 15:27:00,0,"WE wentthere about 8 years ago in early August. We did pretty well fishing - mostly walleye, a few pike, and some smallies. The camp is a little congested and noisy- about 15 cottages,some campers, a generator that runs 24 hrs, and a railroad track right beside the camp. The lake itself is pretty good. I'd start fishing around the narrows and then work areas within a quarter mile east and west of the narrows. That's where we picked up the most of them. Most of the ""veterans"" who were there that week were using jigs/nightcrawlers. Some spoons on the weedbeds (about halfway between the camp and the narrows) worked for pike.Good luck!"

512138,Guest,2001-04-29 16:39:00,0,"Melonbob,I did get your email. I would like to try out Dog Lk either this summer or next. There is a camp on Prarie Bee, adjacent to Windermere, that looks like a nice family place that I booked for August for the kids first trip. I may portage to Windermere and was curious about the fishing there.will email later.lobo"

Both years I have been there during the 3rd week in July and the walleye fishing has been very good. You won't find large eyes but lots of good eaters up to 4#s. The smallies have started to show up when casting towards the shorelines. We go in by way of Wawa and stop at Young's General store for leeches. We take in a pound for four guys plus a flat of crawlers. I use leeches 100% on jigs especially Northland Whistler jigs in 1/16,1/8 and 1/4 oz. Pink/white(MaryKay) was a killer last year along with orange/chart. I use these on a 71/2foot spinning rod with quality 4# line. I take my Lund so don't need to worry about traveling across the lake in a rental boat getting beat to death by the waves. Because of this I can run 6 miles up the lake to a great reef off one of the islands. Last year in 45 minutes two of us caught/culled 6 eyes that averaged 3#s all on Whistlers/leeches. There is a large rock pile one mile out from the camp that is loaded with eyes. Again, my buddy and I drifted around it one evening and caught 32 eyes in 11/2 hours all on Whistlers/leeches. I can't go back this year but hope to take my son next year. If you want more info let me know. Dan"
