You will want to go to the the usual spot. if you stay at paradise duane will set you up with a map. otherwise you can purchase a map from the canadan government. It shows you all the islands it would be very tough getting lost with that map. I have same gps number if that would help you.bill
512134,Kurt,2001-05-02 17:11:00,47,"I have the navigational chart but don`t have gps.I`m staying at Bayview.Maybe we could gettogether somehow and you could give me a few walleye spots out of the generousity of your heart. I know how protective most fisherman are of their spots.Any help would be appreciated.Thanx,Kurt"
512123,Guest,2001-04-24 04:36:00,0,Any reports of Ice Out occuring on lakes around Minaki?
512124,Brent,2001-04-24 07:18:00,45,May 14
512125,Frank from TBay,2001-04-24 07:22:00,312,I had guessed around May 7th before....but with the last blast of winter we had I agree. Buddies were out fishing on the weekend and there is still 20 to 24in of good solid ice. Ice has not even lifted fully in some lakes.
512126,Guest,2001-04-24 11:02:00,0,"My guess would be May 4th.....supposed to really be warming upby Friday, won't take long with temps in the 70's."
512127,Guest,2001-04-24 11:08:00,0,"HA Ha, thats a good one......buddy was up @ cabin on Big Sand. NO melting as of yet....rock hard,even @ shoreline. Lake appeared to be a long way from melting. I just flew over the area last thursday & all the lakes looked white & solid.HOPEFULLY, this warm weather & some rain will help speed up the process. Until then all we can do is dream.....Good FishenRob"
512128,Guest,2001-04-25 04:08:00,0,Wishfull thinking I guess.......
512129,Guest,2001-04-26 14:14:00,0,"Just called Paradise Cove, & the general feeling is that the ice will be out on or around May 10. The bay in front of Paradise 1 still has ice. To quote ""It has ice, but she don't look to good""The little channel that goes from Paradise 1 to the Minaki Lodge just opened. Usually it takes a week after that for the bay to open (with Duane helping it of course...)TRADITIONALLY, it is then a week later that Big Sand opens. All I will say, HOLD ON NEWT....the opening is gonna be HOT, HOT, HOT ! ! As in years past when we have had these late ice outs the river has produced many (to steal a term) ""Sumo Piggies"" In years past , we couldn't get a fish under 30inches.......Good FishenRob"
512130,Guest,2001-04-28 13:43:00,0,"Rtmg,I have a few Questions for you regarding walleye in Minaki.Where are they in the beginning of August and what tactics work best then?Do you guide and would you possibly be availible then?I`m going to spend most of my time musky fishing but definately want some walleyes.I`ll be bringing my 10 yo daughter up with me on my her first trip.Thanx,Kurt"
512131,Guest,2001-04-28 16:47:00,0,"That time of year the walleyes are deep. The best thing is trolling in big sand in the late evenings, or running spinners in 40 feet up in the big and little sand! Is this your first trip to minaki?"
512132,Kurt,2001-05-01 14:19:00,47,"No,I`ve been there twice.Last week of August and last week of September.This will be my first time alone. Went with someone who knows it fairly well for muskies.Musky fished the entire time.Since I`m taking my 10 yo daughter I thought I`d also try some walleye fishing.Sort of know my way around.Don`t think I`ll stay out after dark.I hope trolling isn`t the only way to catch them then."
