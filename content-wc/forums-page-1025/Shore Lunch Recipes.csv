Looking for alternative walleye, perch, northern, bass shore lunch type recipe to go with less or no grease, boiling or foil methods, etc. A week of fishing is no fun without the traditional shore lunches on the rocky beaches. Any recipe would be appreciated. I will compile all recipes and forward them back to those that e-mail me a recipe, so you can enjoy them too!! Thanks, Mikel"

The next day for shore lunch I brown them ,after slicing on , a T-Fal skillet yhat has been coated with Pam. For fish I very sparingly use olive oil in a skillet. I coat the fish with a mixture of 3/4 flour and 1/4 yellow corn meal. Another way to do fish is to burn dry sticks between rocks and let the fire die down so that you have hot coals. While the fire is burning I place onions, bell peppers and yellow bannana pepper rings on aluminum foil,then place the fillets on top and place more peppers and onions on the fillets. Wrap up and place in one of the flat wire racks with a long wire handle. Place this a couple inches over the fire and cook on both sides. Real Good."

512061,Guest,2001-04-20 19:18:00,0,Walleye in foil w/ lemon pepper and a LITTLE butter is excellent!
512063,Guest,2001-04-21 08:30:00,0,Tin foil cooking is the answer. Put a layer of onion slices against the tin foil on either side of the fish. It will add flavour and moisture and also protect the fish from burning and sticking.

512062,BD,2001-04-26 18:40:00,739,"Dip the filets in an egg and roll in ""Bookbinders Fish and Seafood Bread Crumbs"". Use a non-stick pan to fry them in a small amount of olive oil and place on paper towels to absorb most of the oil.Boil some spuds with the skins on ahead of time. Slice the spuds and onions into a pan that has been sprayed with ""Olive Oil Pam"" for frying.Open a large can of good baked beans and heat it slowly.When you've finished cooking and your buddies are already chowing down, fill your plate and enjoy.While you are enjoying your leisurely meal and your buddies are done. Pop open a ""Blue"" and watch them clean up the mess you made!"
512065,Dano,2001-04-26 21:17:00,83,One of my favorite ways is to cook them on the grill. Sprinkle with some lemon peper and put them on a medium grill. The trick is to leave the skin on to cook them so the meat stays together. Cook skin down then flip over for a couple minutes. When it is done the skin will come off real easy. Works best with trout and walleye. Northern seem to be too greasy. Hope this helps.
512066,GregK,2001-05-03 07:45:00,113,"You can fry your shoes and they'll taste great after fishing all morning on one of those north woods jewels!Alternatively, we have taken to frying walleye filets with nothing more than an iron pan and a liberal spray of something like Pam on both the fish and the pan. This has turned out to be a preferred method since you can taste the wonderful flavor of the fish rather than a coating or grease. Just make sure you have a spatula large enough to flip the filets or cut the filet to the size of the spatula.Feel the tick!"
