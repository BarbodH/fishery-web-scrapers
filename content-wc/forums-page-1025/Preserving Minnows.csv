512183,Guest,2001-04-29 18:26:00,0,Earlier this winter I read a post on how to preserve minnows to take accross the border. The 'recipe' used borax and salt. If anybody has this 'recipe' and would share it I would appreciate it. I am tired of paying $4.00 a doz and am willing to try anything to save a little $$ on this years trip...Thanks

One person told me to use this mixture with one layer on the bottom of a 5 gal. bucket, then a layer of minnows then another layer of the salt/borax mixture until you filled up the bucket if you wanted. They said to let it stand for three weeks in a cool place. I plan on trying this on a small scale just make sure it works before I do several dozen. Hope to take plenty of these on a couple of fly-in trips this summer. Good Luck!!"

512186,TomPGrouse,2001-05-01 10:06:00,124,I know that our local bait shop(Bob's Bait)here in Green Bay does a great job. We have been using preserved minnow for five years. They work well. He sells a pound of minnows for about 11 bucks. It beats the mess of doing it yourself.
512187,Guest,2001-05-02 18:00:00,0,It works good to put one dozen of the preserved minnows in a zip lock sandwich bag. Just take out of the freezer how many bags you need for the day...
