511920,Guest,2001-04-09 04:03:00,0,Can anyone offer some advice here? Friends and I will be spending 4 days fishing the Iron Bridge area. We'll be there for a lake trout fishing contest. Just about everybody fished Chiblow last year. I won with a 12+ lb.er. We would like to get into some walleye this time (after putting up a leader in the lake trout category of course!)We hit a few on Bright Lake and Tunnel. But couldn't find anything with some size. Ideas anybody? Thanks.P.S. Would also appreciate learning about any other lakes to try for a big Laker.Gut Hook from Indiana
