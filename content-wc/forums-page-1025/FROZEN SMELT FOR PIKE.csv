512225,Guest,2001-05-02 17:22:00,0,Is frozen smelt a legal bait in NW ON? Fishing for pike at Eagle Lake this summer and don't wish to break any laws. Thanks.
512226,Frank from TBay,2001-05-02 17:42:00,312,"It is illegal to use smelt in divisions 22,22a,30,31 and 32.If it is the Eagle Lake in the Dryden area that is division 22a. You would be illegal."
512229,Guest,2001-05-03 05:14:00,0,"Mark:I was also concerned with the use of frozen smelt in Ontario and consequently emailed the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. My question to them and their response are copied below for your information.MNR:Last Saturday, a fishing buddy and I were debating whether we could legally use dead smelt (purchased frozen) as bait fish in Ontario waters.Although I reviewed the Ontario fishing regulations from your web site, I'm still not clear as to the correct answer. Would you please tell us whether or not we can legally use dead smelt as bait fish in Ontario waters other than in Divisions 22, 22A, 30, 31 and 32.Their response""Smelt may not be used for bait, alive or dead. Smelt is an exotic species and have a reputation for spreading into waters quite easily. Though dead fish do not pose the same risk it is hard to monitor that no live fish are present and that there is no risk of fertilized eggs being released into the environment."" Hope that helps. Jay"

512228,Frank from TBay,2001-05-03 10:16:00,312,I've heard some reports on some of the lakes. Lac Des Mille Lacs is pretty much free and a lot of the other lakes are very close to being out or out. I cannot be more specific untill Saturday when I am heading out to camp. I do not think you will have a problem. Buddies are going into Quetico for Lake Trout saturday and their reports are no problem. Good luck: Frank
