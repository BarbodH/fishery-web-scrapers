533081,jzstiff,2003-06-30 20:01:00,188,How are they for trolling? Are they pretty deep divers or is it hard to get them down?
533082,Guest,2003-06-30 20:14:00,0,Was up on LOTW a couple of weeks ago and a couple of the guys in my group was trolling a suspending jointed Rapala and was flat killing the walleye. We were doing most of our fishng in 10 or less feet of water so I really don't know how deep they get but they were sure getting the job done.
