532965,Guest,2003-06-27 12:33:00,0,"Why even report on that part of Lac Suel. Frankly, fishing is always good and a 2 year old could catch 100+ Walleye per day. This is the easiest fishing in the world, not only for Walleyes but big Northern."
532973,Guest,2003-06-27 16:48:00,0,"Man I like reverting back to my 2 year old childhood days. Nothing like a full day of lip ripping on ""eyes"". Easy fishing makes for a lotsa fun camp stories. We age way too fast to not enjoy this stuff. 7 out"
533008,Newby,2003-06-29 11:05:00,148,"Just returned from Sioux Lookout area. Fire is huge, almost had our trip cancled because they were going to close the road in to our camp. Luckly it stayed open. The smoke from the fire filled the air and irritated out eyes and lungs, not pleasant. On wed. a cold front moved through and rained all day and thurs., but not enough to put out the fire. I guess it has burned more than 60,000 acres, wow. Other fires are in the area also. I would call your outfitter, but I think they have it under control now. Fishing was first rate until the cold front, but that only slowed it down. Have fun and remember saftey first. Also, lake levels are still down 3-5ft, so be carefull."
532782,whitetip1,2003-06-24 12:28:00,53,My nephew just talked to Brenda at Ojibway. She stated that it was day-to-day on when Ojibway will being operational. Wooglin: Make sure you call up there before you do the drive. Sounds like lake access may be limited around that area. Dave
532783,Guest,2003-06-24 12:34:00,0,"I will definetly do so. Thanks again for all the tips....if I get any current info on the fires up there, I will be sure to post it here. Good luck with your trips everyone....see you on the water (hopefully)!"
532789,Guest,2003-06-24 13:16:00,0,"Naughty Pines Fish Camp was leveled but not from the Sioux Look-out Fire. The fire they had started by a cabin or around a cabin and spread took the whole resort, everyone is ok. Naughty Pines is West of Ear Falls. I just talked to the owner and they are not sure what started it. pikelady"

532845,Guest,2003-06-25 11:29:00,0,Hi Dave: Thank you for your concern and Lac Seul Outposts is up and running as of 8:00 this morning. Go to our web site at www.lacseuloutposts.com and click on recent photos. You will see a number of fire photos.
532846,whitetip1,2003-06-25 11:37:00,53,All right Brenda!! I look forward to meeting you. I will be with the Swenson group coming in on Sunday morning. Glad to hear you are doing OK. Dave
532848,Guest,2003-06-25 11:43:00,0,"Thanks for posting the pics, it is nice to get a picture in my head of what is actually happening up there. My group of four will be in the Sioux Lookout area on the 28th through the 3rd. Hope to see you guys on the water. Don't forget, please don't run us over in our 14's and 25's... ha ha"
532896,Guest,2003-06-26 07:06:00,0,"I just spoke to our site this morning, and she said that they have been getting some heavy rains recently which is helping the fire problem. The Sioux Lookout side of Lac Seul appears to be in pretty good shape, considering the conditions....she said there are like 48 fires around that area, but things are looking up. Anyway, the forcast predicts rain the next few days, so lets hope it gets better. Fish on, Fish on!"
532947,Guest,2003-06-26 23:11:00,0,"Whitetip1, Just got back from Mahkwa this evening. The fire viewing to the east of the lodge was pretty incredible. Sunday,Monday and Tuesday you could see the fire building in size and strength. With the prevailing West wind we were not affected, but about 4am Wednesday the wind switched to the East and the smoke was brought with it. Thankfully the 35 mph winds also brought a much needed all day rain that bordered on heavy at times and looks as though it knocked the fire down a great deal, was raining today when we left the lodge. This will definately help the fire crews. The fishing was once again spectacular with our group once again putting the fish through a nasty workout. Had a blast catching eyes on Vibe Minnows this week, (Blade Bait) Water is lower than I ever saw it before, but all 5 of the boats in our group came through with skegs and props intact. One guy in our group had his tackle boxes lifted out of his tarped boat at the hotel parking lot in Dryden, police said it is getting to be a common deal so be careful. Hope you have a great time, let me know how you did. The clown and SFC shad raps hammered hundreds of eye's Size 8 in 9' to 14' of water. Crawler rigs in a bit deeper water caught many fish also. But why get the boat dirty with crawler juice when dragging cranks is so darn productive. Geez, Back to work tomorrow. I may try to get back to the lake soon though!!! Tight Lines, Spike"
532955,Guest,2003-06-27 07:52:00,0,Will be in the Sioux Lookout area around 8:00 am on the 28th. See you all on the water.
532706,whitetip1,2003-06-23 11:27:00,53,Anybody here anything on a fire around Siox Lookout? I guy from work just had his trip cancelled (Andersons) because of a fire developing in the area. Supposedly took out 2 cabins at Andersons.
532731,Guest,2003-06-23 18:39:00,0,"Just got back from Abram Lake Park. The fire is located about 2 miles north of Sioux Lookout. The radio said the fire tripled in size from Sunday to Monday. The radio also said that two or three outpost camps had been destroyed. No campfires period. Our camp owner said if the wind shifted there could evacuations. Fishing from Minitaki and Abrams, the fire looked huge sort of like an atom bomb mushroom cloud. Joe"
532738,Guest,2003-06-23 21:02:00,0,"Do you know where this is from Hudson, or HWY 664? We are on our way up there this Friday and would like to know if we'll be smoked out as well. Thanks for the update!"
532739,Guest,2003-06-23 21:09:00,0,I just got a call from Ojibway Outfitters at Chamberlain Narrows and they had to cancel our stay there for later this week. Brenda said the camp is currently evacuated. She said the staff was still there.
532760,Guest,2003-06-24 07:47:00,0,Wooglin: Not sure about the area you are talking about. Joe
532761,Guest,2003-06-24 07:55:00,0,"Maybe this will help. To get to where we are going, we take from Dryden HWY 17 East/South East to HWY 72, then take HWY 72 North/Northeast towards Sioux Lookout. Just before getting to Sioux Lookout, HWY 664 heads West to Hudson. This is where we turn off, about 8 miles before getting to the city of Sioux Lookout. Maybe that will help."
532772,Trailerguy,2003-06-24 10:16:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b] I just heard from a freind that the fire is out of control, and that Naughty Pines was leveled, the 50 or so people who were in camp are OK."
532777,IaDave,2003-06-24 11:27:00,476,Check out the Sioux Lookout paper on-line.Some great pictures. Go to www.siouxbulletin.com
532779,whitetip1,2003-06-24 11:43:00,53,"Wow, Fire looks awefully bad. Hopefully everybody in the area is OK. Haven't heard from Ojibway yet but it appears that they are right in the middle of it. I am going to try to contact them if possible. We were scheduled to go in on Sunday. Sure is diappointing but my thoughts and prayers are with the residence and firefighters in the area. Dave"
532780,Guest,2003-06-24 11:50:00,0,"I am with ya on that one Dave. I placed a call this morning to my place and have yet to hear back. Hopefully everything is alright with the people in those affected areas. After some research, I notice that these fires are soemwhat typical in Canada. April through the summer can be very dry and as a result, there are a lot of fires. Either way, its still a bummer. My trip plans won't change...the walleye won't boil in the lakes."
