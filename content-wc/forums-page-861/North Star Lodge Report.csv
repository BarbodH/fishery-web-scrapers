Went up from May 23rd thru May 30th. Trolled for fish in 3-8 feet water using Rapala's and Reef Runners. We caught 1200 fish between 5 guys. 3 dozen Pike between 35""-40"". 1 at 41 inches and 23lbs. Walleye's were avaraging 19"". Border crossing was a breeze. We crossed friday at 4:30 and there were only 2 cars in front of us. We were randomly checked. I do have a dui on my record and we did take my vehicle. That was absolutely not an issue. Simply tell the truth, claim what you are transporting over and it is a breeze. Inspectors only took 2-3 minutes to look through my vehicle and we were on our way. They did not even take anything out of the vehicle. Weather was fabulous. Good Luck to all going to Ontario this year. By the way, the lake level was down quite a bit on clay (approx 2 ft.) So be careful out there! Watch your speed limits on all Highway's as the Cops are out there! No problems in our group, but saw more pull-overs than years past. HWY 502 is still a mess for any of you pulling trailers up. It's terrible in the middle portion. the beginning and end are fine. GOOD LUCK AND BE SAFE!"
531881,Guest,2003-06-02 16:23:00,0,"Thanks for the post. Leaving Wed morning for Lac Seul, and its post like yours that help keep me awake at night with anticipation. Thanks for the tip on 502. Never saw the OP patroling it before, so this year we will take it slow Did you use leaches yet or is it still a minnow bite? Tried leaches last year for the first time, but minnow outfished them 4 - 1 and the word we heard is leaches and crawlers work better in the summer. Was planning on just going with minnows, but with the low water and the warm water temps I am hearing its got me wondering. cheers...IA Walleye"
531882,Guest,2003-06-03 08:15:00,0,"Actually did not see 1 cop on 502 but everywhere else they were out and about. We did not use 1 minnow or Leech, but rather we used Floating Rapalas #11 and #13 of assorted colors. As stated earlier we stayed at North Star Lodge on Clay Lake. Nailed the fish between 3-8 feet of water forward trolling,staying close to shores and any type of structure your depth finder will locate. Over 1200 fish between 5 guys in 6 days. As it has been said many,many times on this board, be careful as water levels are extremely low and the areas you once fished present themselves in a totally different view.Again, I have been up to NW Ontario for 15 years straight and never had a better year. I guess I was in right place at right time. The weather was absolutely gorgeous and left a day early (friday a.m.) as the wind really kicked up quite a bit, to the point where you questioned whether you wanted to get thrown around all day after having such a great week. Needless to say, we left a day early(1st time that ever happened). I wish you a very safe and successful trip. Where you staying up on Lac Seul? I was up there about 5 years ago and stayed at Evergreen Lodge(Gary Beardsley).He runs a great camp and always gets people onto the fish.Anyways good luck to all making the yearly migration to Canada, Be safe and catch alot. Practice catch and release to preserve tomorrow."
531883,Guest,2003-06-03 11:03:00,0,"I was at Lac Seul for ten days for opener. Opening day there were 3 people in my boat, I fished leaches the other 2 used minnows. By the time we left all were using leaches. I like leaches others prefer minnows, I have never had much luck on nighcrawlers but I know others do well with them. It is probably all in the way you fish. I prefer leaches year round, either jigging, or a floater or on a lindy rig. Another group in camp was back a couple of times for more minnows so they were really working well for them. Watch the rocks, the lake is down 6 to 8 ft and rocks that you didn't worry about before are now just below the surface. It scares the ##### out of you to think you went through some of these areas wide open last year.Weather was much better than last year and fishing was great. Good Luck"
