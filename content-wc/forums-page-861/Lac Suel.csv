532971,Guest,2003-06-27 16:24:00,0,"Was up on the north central part of the lake last week and did my best with a white 1/4 oz jig and white 3-4"" scented twister tail setup. Most of our fishing was in 8-14 feet of water. Caught a load of 18-26"" eyes like this. Didn't venture into the deep holes for bigger pigs this trip. The evenings were again good for the shallow water rapala speed trolling fun. #7 shad raps or tail dancers worked great. I preferred the perch and blue tones and then my old favorite clown color for this. Good Luck and watch your lower unit. The water is down about 7 feet from last June. 7 out"
533013,Guest,2003-06-29 13:39:00,0,Just got back today. The fishing was great. Our best luck was ping silver n gold spinners. I had a lot of luck on a orange one with a chartuse strip in the middle. For pike we had great luck on lil sliver doctor spoons. Caught eyes on those too. Not much for weeds so fish the rocks by deep drop offs.
