533112,Guest,2003-07-01 13:35:00,0,"Bronzeback has a good point, since parts of the lake have different water clarity(ie whitefish bay being very clear) we fish the southern part of the lake and the water is stained. We are strictly bait fishermen, and do a lot of jigging. I think color does make a difference with the brighter chartruese and multi color jigs outperforming other colors when the bite is mediocre or slow. If you're trolling a worm harness or bottom bouncer I would go with a hammered gold or nickel spinner. In summer, the walleyes will be on deep reefs and would go with 1/4 oz. jigs. You can't feel the bottom with a 1/8 oz unless its dead calm, and the 3/8 seem to scare them off. Good luck."
