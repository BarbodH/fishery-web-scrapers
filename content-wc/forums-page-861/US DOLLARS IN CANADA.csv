The best bet is to charge wherever possible (and convenient) and pay where necessary. I've never changed any money going in and usually only spend $50.00 US that is not on a credit card. Usually two dinners, coffee, pop..."

532724,eyedoktr,2003-06-23 16:26:00,2426,I suggest converting some US dollars. There are quite a few places in Canada that don't give you the exchange rate. The best way is to charge everything and the credit card company will do all the calculating and usually give you the best exchange rate.
532726,Vitreum,2003-06-23 16:27:00,221,"the greenback is accepted everywhere i've ever been. problem is that you get a less than favorable exchange rate from the small retailers. no big deal, but you do not get the actual exchange rate. not sure why. credit cards give you the best exchange rate. i use them everywhere i can in canada."
532747,BD,2003-06-23 22:13:00,739,"Use a credit card whenever possable. Visa is the best to take. Master Card and Discover are not accepted everywhere. You will get the best exchange rate, the rate only major banks and credit card companies get, and end up paying only a very small ""service fee"" over the best rate possable. Most businesses hedge the exchange rate they give you to protect themselves from changes in the rate that their bank gives them."
532756,retire55,2003-06-24 07:02:00,1029,"While I agree that credit card companies usually provide the most cost effective exchange rate, many outfitters only accept cash or travellers cheques. As well, many outfitters have two price schedules, one in US dollars and the other in Cdn dollars. The exchange rate has changed somewhat over the last few months (Cdn dollar going from 63 cents US to 73 cents US). Consequently, checking out the quoted costs in both currencies might save a few dollars."

532813,Guest,2003-06-24 17:50:00,0,A lot of the resorts only deal in US cash. I bought minnows at a resort a few years back and the price was posted in US dollars. They converted the price into Canadian dollars and I paid about $12 dollars for two dozen minnows. My buddy who is an electrical contractor would love to charge hi charge out rate and convert it to US funds for this resort.
532816,Guest,2003-06-24 18:10:00,0,I hear you Canadian Guy. Its tough to believe that any place in Canada can get away with fronting the price in U.S. Dollars even if your a Canadian Resident. As if we should be forced to pay a converted rate for goods in our own country using our own LEGAL TENDER. I HATE BEING BENT OVER AND TAKING IT DRY!!
