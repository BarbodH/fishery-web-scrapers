533059,tui0rls,2003-06-30 14:11:00,1,I am making my first trip to Big Eagle Lake July 19th. Staying at the Eagle Lake Lodge which appears to be on the northeast side of the lake. Looking for info on where to walleye fish close to the camp. Do not have a real big boat and understand that Eagle is a big lake that can get very rough. Any info would be greatly appreciated.

Also you might want to try www.lake-link.com there is lot of info be posted on the Wisconsin thread the last few days for fishing on the north end of Eagle. Check it out. Be careful of the rocks water level is low this year and yes Eagle can get very rough.
