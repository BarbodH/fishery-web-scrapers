532940,SoDakMac,2003-06-26 20:12:00,218,"Thanks for this information! I went to the website and printed the page and took it with me. We just returned from a camp in Ontario. They did charge us the full PST tax. However, when I showed them the sales tax holiday article they refigured our bill and reduced it by approximately $65.00 U.S. They indicated that they did not know the new policy."
532948,Guest,2003-06-26 23:47:00,0,yea and i got a bridge to sell you too!
532972,Guest,2003-06-27 16:37:00,0,"I recently read on WC that if you put a downpayment of over 20% over 60 days ahead, the lodge owner may only charge 3% for the GST and then we don't have to pay the difference (which we would get back anyway at the border). Is this true? We were just up at Lac Seul and that is apparently the way they did it (I wasn't in charge of paying etc.) We go to Wabigoon and I could pay a greater amount down if that would save the stop at the border. Thanks."
532978,Guest,2003-06-28 00:09:00,0,OK I must report that today I got a check back from the resort for $20.92 . there was a note with it but it pertained to accomodations and not the other things we got like gas and bait. I think he kept some of the pst tax. i will have to check further.
532979,ackermannsacre,2003-06-28 00:32:00,196,"After all this you obviously have still not read the link that pertains to the Sales Tax Holiday. It is not for the entire year and only applies to food and accomodations. Does not apply to gas, boats, bait etc."
532992,SoDakMac,2003-06-28 20:58:00,218,Correct. They told us that with package deals they figure that half of the cost is accomodations.
532280,Guest,2003-06-13 00:21:00,0,im confused now. someone said it was the pst tax that was stopped for the year. I thought it was gst. which is it or which was it supposed to be. did any one else have to pay the one that was supposed to cancelled? thanks
532308,Guest,2003-06-13 14:12:00,0,"I'm no expert this this is the way I got it when we were up there last week. The PST has been placed on hold due to the SARS (another person told me it was due to the Iraq war---but the SARS makes more sense. The GST remains and we in the US get a rebate of a percentage of that. The receipts must be over 50 Canadian in order to qualify. Hope this helps. According to the lodge owner we stay at, the 'no PST' saved us 5% on or bill with him."
532329,Guest,2003-06-14 11:54:00,0,"Ok thanks alot. when I mentioned a tax abatement the owner said the gst tax abatement was never finalized. I guess he was confused too when it should have been the PST tax. I emailed him a request for a refund of the mistake in charging me the pst tax. I guess I should pay closer attention to the bill but how many ""mistakes"" are allowed?OK thanks a lot. alan"

532343,Guest,2003-06-15 00:16:00,0,that link was great. it explained everything in a nut s####. I hope everyone going to canada- ontario sees this and makes sure it is not on the bill when they get ready to check out. I am just curious to know how many people were still charged the pst tax on their stay? thanks I was.
532349,Guest,2003-06-15 08:38:00,0,"Does this ""sales tax holiday"" also hold true for the Province of Quebec?"
532351,McQ,2003-06-15 09:47:00,615,If I understand this deal the following is true: No is the answer to your question - the provincial sales tax abatement is an Ontario initiative to help overcome the drop in tourist travel as a result of the SARS media blitz. You just get the break on your bill in Ontario. GST still has to be claimed as a refund after your return to the States. Quebec PST and Federal GST are refundable - you make a claim when you return to the States. Your outfitter should have the claim forms
532537,Guest,2003-06-18 20:32:00,0,has anyone been charged the pst tax ? I was and last week I emailed the resort about the mistake and have not gotten an email or check back yet. I will ask the resort owned again about it and see what the results are. If I get no answer or check soon I dont know what i will do but I certainly wont forget it. probably the ontario government would not be happy not getting their tax money
532538,McQ,2003-06-18 20:45:00,615,"ex pup, I suggest you cut & paste the address contained in Dan2's post. Send it to your lodge owner and tell him your next communication will be with the Ontario government. By the way there never was any thought given to a GST abatement. That's Federal territory."
532544,Reels,2003-06-18 22:36:00,2876,"We just got back, and no, we didn't pay PST. It was a nice surprise. We did pay GST, but got it back at the boarder. <{{}}><"
