Is there anything missing from the cabins which a guy should bring? What lures, live bait, etc. would be the best to help put some kids on walleyes? How is the northern pike fishing? Any advice based on your experience would be greatly appreciated. Thanks much. js-ms"
532993,Guest,2003-06-28 21:19:00,0,We were there 3 years in a row same week you are going. Fishing was fair for walleye and northerns. Last year a fellow told me of a small lake north of Pakashkan and we had extremely wonderfull fishing on this small lake. If you want more information I have maps of how to get there. Our group will be going to a different place last week in July. Email me [email protected]

We/I have had some great memories and fishing experiences at this lake, i have loved it and will never forget it. The cabins include alot, but many supplies are missing. The fishing did go from excellent to worse as the years progressed thats why this will be the first year that we are not going back. It is a beutiful lake i hope you really enjoy it, i know i have. If you have any more questions or want some personal pictures, let me know!"

Expect to catch alot of pike here when fishing shallow areas or when you fish towards shore. I have had very very good luck on lures suck as spinners when i reel them fast casting off shore, or bucktails. Topwater is extremly effective here also. Many areas with weeds or shallow water will hold many northerns. They usually range from 20-33"""
