We got our share of walleyes (not too many pike) and the size was just about right. Lots of 15 inchers (only got a few in the slot) and brother got a monster. Also tied into some wall hanger speckled trout at a smaller lake nearby. Although ""Brutus"" got away from us -- twice! Wanna go back in the fall now to get him. Trout"
