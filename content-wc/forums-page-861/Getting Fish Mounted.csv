I'm not much for mounting fish, but I won't deny them there right to do so. If we do catch a worthy fish, how should I go about getting it across the border, and how should I store it. We will be on a houseboat for 7 days. I talked to them about getting a replica made, but they didn't seem interested."

They do not hold up as well and the cost is about the same either way. Take measurements (length, girth at various spots) and several photos. Don't have to worry about getting across the border either. Scott"
532790,Stevie B,2003-06-24 13:16:00,157,I would recommend the replica aswell. Real ones can go to the pits in a few years. Replicas will last you a lifetime. Also fish of that size belong in the lake not on the wall. IMHO Fish ON!!
532798,retire55,2003-06-24 14:35:00,1029,I support replica's as well.
532801,Guest,2003-06-24 15:02:00,0,Good advice regarding the quality over time. I will pass that on. I also agree that the big ones should stay in the water. I'll steer them into a replica.
532828,Guest,2003-06-25 03:55:00,0,"The mount by a good taxidermist will last a long time so my advice is, go ahead and get the real thing mounted. A once-in-a-lifetime trophy will mean so much more when it's the real thing. The one and only trophy I've got would not mean as much to me as some hunk of fiberglass that anyone with a checkbook could buy. The fishery will not collapse because you happen to hang one on the wall. (I know this will prompt a few responses.) As far as prepping your fish...get plenty of pictures. Before putting it in the freezer, rub it down with boric acid, then wrap and freeze. Oh, I forgot, the hardest step is the first one: You've got to catch one. Good luck."
532975,Guest,2003-06-27 18:10:00,0,"Three years ago we landed a 22 lb 44 inch pike and decided to go the real thing way. We took it to a bait shop in Ignace. The bait shop acts as the agent for the big taxidermy shop (Hawkins) in Winnipeg. They freeze it and ship it for you. You then get a quote from the taxidermy shop and you then authorize and send them a deposit. It may take 8 months to a year before you get it back, but this way you don't have to hold it very long or transport vary far. The taxidermy shop also acts as the customs agent to get it in to the United States. The cost was comparable to US shops but the hassle and handling was a whole lot less and the quality of the mount was excellent. Hang it in a cool dry area out of direct sun and you will have very good luck!"
532977,Guest,2003-06-27 20:33:00,0,What is an average price for a replica around 40 - 45 inch fish?
532989,Guest,2003-06-28 15:59:00,0,"The cost of a replica at Hawkins, for pike and walleye, I think is around $10-$12/inch, but double check to be certain. I completely agree with the majority of other posts in this discussion-get a replica! Price is comparable, they generally last longer, and look nicer. One post above states to go the ""real"" route because anyone with a cheque book could buy a piece of fibreglass. First, you know you caught the fish and that is what matters. You do not need to prove it to people by getting a skin mount. Second, 99% of people can't distinguish between a skin mount and a replica anyway!!! You do not have to deal with transporting the fish, and you are better conserving the fishery. And, of course, if everyone took the ""fishery will not collapse because you hang one on the wall"" approach, that is precisely what could happen. Lac Seul Guide"
