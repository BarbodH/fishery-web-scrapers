If so would like info on what landing they used and if you took your own boats. Have a couple of guys that want to take their own rigs. You can e:mail me at [email protected] or respond here. Thanks"

533023,Guest,2003-06-29 22:01:00,0,We stayed at white wing. The cabins were great. We have a lot better service else where. We were fishing out by steam boat n 3 boats ran out of gas from evergreen and the 4th one was trying to get back on low gas. The guys said they only fill the boats tuesday n saturday I found that stupid. But gary puts you on the fish n is very helpful i found that wierd of him to do.
533028,Guest,2003-06-30 05:13:00,0,"Good Morning, this is Pat at Evergreen and Three boats did run out of gas there wasn't a fourth boat and we gas every day of the week. It so happens these fellows came in mid week and ran allot futher than usual and have been comeing up for 11 years. Fishing was so good they booked for next year too. We take care of them here at Evergreen. Thanks, Pat"

533091,Guest,2003-07-01 05:34:00,0,"All I can say is that you need to find Doug Gawley at redwomanriver.com and your dreams will come true. We did a day fly in with his outfit which is out of Lac Seul. He was hummble to say the least about what we were about to experience. Hot sunny and calm were the weather conditions. We had a total of 10 guys that were at wits end with out destination... MANOTAK lodge sucks! But at least the owner told us about Doug. Anywho, we caught over 100 walleye per person in five hours. He taught us that you cannot do a drive in trip if you are looking to catch fish in a barrell. We just got back from our first remote Fly-In, and it was awesome. Spend the time and energy to find the outfitters that do not show fancy film of some guy with a ten pounder caught in 1972. We sought out over 20 outfitters before we decided on out new secret. The one question that I asked each outfitter was, ""will we each catch over 50 fish per day?"" If the answere was not a dead YES, then we did not have any more to talk about. Our trip with the flight was $695 per person, private lake, great food, excellent boats and motors, and we ended up catching over 1000 walley, small mouth, and pike. This is not an exageration and the Outfitter is 100% booked. We plan to return in 2005 for another round. We flew out of Ft. Frances. You do not have to drive 20 hours north to find excellent fishing. I hope you take these words of wisdom to heart. This was going to be out best or last trip to Canada. Look him up on the web. redwomanriver.com is the site and Doug is your man. Good Luck!!!!!!!!! The Preppier."
532907,Guest,2003-06-26 09:09:00,0,"I'm beginning the search for a new place to wet my line. I've been going to Ontario in the early spring for the last 20 years and every once in awhile I get the itch to change. I've been to seven different places over the years and lately I've been reading with great interest about Lac Seul. My hope, like all fishermen, is to find the perfect place. I usually tow my own boat so I'd prefer a drive-in. I also bring my wife and daughters so we need someplace comfortable and clean. Our hope is to enjoy a quiet spot away from the crowds but have the comfort of a nice cabin to return to during the day and evening. Any suggestions and advice would be greatly appreciated."
532915,Guest,2003-06-26 11:38:00,0,"I've been to williams lake lodge on williams lake which is connected to lac seul for the past 13 years . My family including my wife love it.This is a boat-in camp so it is very peacefull.You can bring your own boat but I would suggest using theirs, it comes with the cabin.The people are first-rate and have good guides(brian).This is not a fancy resort with tennis courts and ####tail bar.It is more of a family type atmosphere.They book fast ,maybe full already for 2004! But that only shows it's liked by others not only myself.They do have a web site- not sure what it is.Maybe do a search of the Dryden Ont. area.More questions? e-mail me and I'll let my wife do the typing, I'm terrible! We leave 7-18-03,can't wait. [email protected]"
532917,Guest,2003-06-26 12:08:00,0,"I have been going to Lac Suel for 12 years. Our group uses Dan McDonald at Lac Suel Lodge. He has 8 or so cabins, but we stay at Black bay outpost. One of the guys in our group did stay at the home site in a cabin a couple times on a seperate trip and was very pleased there as well. I recommend the lake, and Dan very highly. We have been treated well on every trip. my email is [email protected] if you need any info. Lac Suel Lodge is 807-222-2255. Good Luck, it is a great lake."
532919,Guest,2003-06-26 13:13:00,0,You can believe Euker...he spends his time on Lac Seul netting my fish and taking my picture with the Hog Walleye I catch. He also cooks my breakfast and when he is really good I let him hold my fish so he can get a picture taken to show his two adorable sons.
532921,Guest,2003-06-26 14:31:00,0,"A good family location is Gold Pines Camp in Ear Falls. Great for family, kids, etc... Unlike many of the ""fishing"" focused lodges on Lac Seul, they have a nice beach area, playground for the kids, and are relatively close to town. Bill, Helen, Peter and Christa will take care of you."
532926,Guest,2003-06-26 15:49:00,0,T-Mac Not working again? Thought you'd be at Le Place Rendevous by now? See you Friday night. FISH ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
532927,Big Tim,2003-06-26 15:55:00,63,"I second Euker's endorsements of Lac Seul Lodge, & Dan McDonald also. I can't vouch for all his cabins, but his 2 newest, #1 & #8 are VERY nice. Stayed there the last 3 years & would not change anything. ( Well , maybe the water level this year!) A first rate camp!"
532935,IA  DAN,2003-06-26 18:43:00,53,I'd have to say Lac Seul Lodge also Dan's a first rate host.Black Bay here we come. I just hope Mikes group didnt scare all the big ones away haha.If you left any money in the cabin I'll make sure I buy a beer with it. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH.
532944,BuckeyeWilly,2003-06-26 22:32:00,41,We just got back from our first Lac Seul trip. Stayed at Whitewing Resort near Ear Falls. Was really impressed with them - first class all the way. Definitely someplace you would want to take the wife and kids. You've got to try a couple of the dinners at the Lodge. Bobbie is one tremendous cook. Cabins were excellent!! I plan on taking my wife back next year.
532970,Guest,2003-06-27 16:23:00,0,"Walleye Al Check out Gary and Pat at Lacseul Evergreen Lodge. Like all good camp owners you will find them very helpful and they will take care of all your needs. All of their cabins are either new or newly remodeled, I am sure your wife and children will find them clean and comfortable. Their camp sits back in a cove and the docks are protected from the wind which is nice when you bring your own boat. The only problem you will have there is finding an opening as they fill up early and are usually full for the summer. And yes, we do go there twice a year every year."
