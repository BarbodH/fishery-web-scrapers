532949,Guest,2003-06-26 23:52:00,0,At first i thought I was getting a great deal. i was just getting a couple bottles of gin. I happened to compare the prices with sams club a couple of years later. they were just about the same. I think those tax free joints are a ripoff. yea tax free but thats more profit in their pocket. I dont know how the other things they pawn off as tax free compare but i drive past them now.
532950,ackermannsacre,2003-06-27 01:16:00,196,"If the price was about the same as Sam's why do you think you got ripped off? How does not having to collect taxes equate to more profit for the shop? I have a business and collect half as much tax for food items. The key there is collect, I don't charge any tax, I just collect it for the state, no more or less profit for me either way."
532983,Guest,2003-06-28 10:38:00,0,"This is the thing. At Sams we not only pay for the gin but also pay the taxes on the gin. lets say 25 dollors gin and tax. At the ""tax free shop"" we pay 25 dollors for the gin and no tax. At sams the tax might be 4 dollors of the 25. That should mean then that the ""tax free shop"" should only be charging 21 dollors. So for me that means that the ""tax free shop"" is making 4 dollors more than it should. The ""tax free shop"" is holding itself out to be giving the consumer a break on the governments behalf of being tax free and a better deal when in fact it is NOT. The government should cancel this idea because the government is loosing those dollors to the ""tax free shop"".;-)"

532991,ackermannsacre,2003-06-28 19:33:00,196,"Alan, why do you get to decide what they ""should"" charge? As long as they have people like you around buying bottles of gin, they are going to sell them at whatever the market will bear, it's called free enterprise."
533005,Guest,2003-06-29 09:47:00,0,"Your right bill they can charge whatever they want. The gin i was getting was Tanqueray and the prices when i compared them were within pennies. So I bought the gin in chicago and did not have to worry about having to drink up the bottle before coming back to the states or paying taxes on what i did not consume in canada. You do know, that that tax free liquor is not legally allowed back in the states, unless you stop at the border and pay the taxes on whatever you are bringing back with you dont you."
533006,Guest,2003-06-29 10:06:00,0,"since everyone choose to ignore your question, and just complained about what they bought, i thought i would answere your question. they are not opened 24 hrs. i believe they open at 7:00 am. i really dont know what time they close because we are up fishing at lac seul by then. but while we are at it,we,(6 of us) stop at the duty free store and buy 10 cases of ""BLUE"" for $100.00 and then have to pay the duty on only 4 cases. we think thats quite a good deal. pepe."
