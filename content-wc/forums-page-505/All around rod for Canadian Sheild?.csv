1270976,BenBeattie,2011-02-13 16:35:00,232,Go medium power!! You'll be thankful for the backbone when you hook a 10lb pike or when you're trying to set the hook in 30+ feet of water on a big walleye.
1271023,jsmyers,2011-02-13 20:19:00,198,"I'm not getting a medium rod.I'm not worried about setting the hook in any depth of the lakes I fish with no stretch line and a 7' rod....especially in the spring fishing.I'm not really worried about losing a random pike on the lighter rod either.I'd probably fish for pike with a ML all the time if I wasn't worried about killing fish through exhaustion. (That and a 1 oz daredevil is scary to cast with a light rod.) When I was a kid I got so I would often switch down from a mepps 4-5 to a 2-3 and catch 18-23"" snakes on a really cheap 5'6"" UL rod. Pike under 3 or 4 pounds are really pretty nicely matched to UL tackle. My original question was light or medium-light, I'll have 2 MH rods that I'm using for pike and for large lures. I don't want another rod that is barely different. I've settled on a 7' ML, I just have to decide which one is right for my budget and pull the trigger."
1271074,NathanH,2011-02-14 06:37:00,697,I would go with the Cabales Tourney rod I know they are on sale for like 40 bucks this week online and I have seen them as cheep as 30 dollars thats when I purchased mine. I purchased both 6'6'' in the Med and ML. I will say that the Med is in my opinion stiff. So think about the ML. It would be a great jigging rods or for throwing light crankbaits like under a 1/4oz. Also is a MediumFast action so with super lines it will allow you some extra give if the fish makes a run.
1271183,jsmyers,2011-02-14 12:58:00,198,"I made my order this morning. That is exactly what I ordered...a 7' tourney.I almost went $10 less for the next cabelas model down, but the better grip was the deciding factor.I also got a Fish Eagle II MH with a reel.Can anybody explain to me why the Fish Eagle are more expensive than the Tourney Trail rods, even though on paper the tourney look like better rods? (In case anybody asks, they don't have a MH TT, so that wasn't an option.)"
1271239,scotttheguide,2011-02-14 16:48:00,73,"St.Croix Triumph, Mojo or new Eyecon series rods.Good quality rods, good warranties just incase, lots of varietys and won't break the bank. If i had to grab 1 rod it would be a St.Croix MBS68MXF - Mojo 6'8"" Medium Xtra Fast. Wacky Style. Come to think of it I have caught Bass, Walleye, Pike, Muskie, Lakers and Jumbo Perch on that rod.Just my opinion. Happy Fishing this season everyone. Set the Hook!"
1270135,Bigfishhunter,2011-02-10 20:17:00,803,"I would go with a Medium fast action in the 6'6"" length or 6'9"" or even a 7' would be good too."
1270161,adempsey,2011-02-10 22:55:00,963,"There is a 2 piece MH 6'6"" Premier, but no 7'. The new St.Croix Eyecon rods are nice too. I might pick one up at the sports show.IIRC the St.Croix rods are a little stiffer compared to the equivalent Shimano. Easy enough to compare them in the store though."
1270242,jswinter40,2011-02-11 08:34:00,127,"I would agree with Demsey that the SCII is a little ""stiffer"" than the IM7. I would phrase it as having a faster action in the tip though because the backbone is probably the same. The other brands mentioned, fenwick, all-star, etc are all quality rods, just depends on the user I think. I will say that the light rods will not have the backbone to get a good enough hook set on that big fish you've always wanted. I have used them before and especially in deeper water you will be sorry. fun though for most fish when hook stays in. Medium light in this gentleman's case is a no brainer in my opinion."
1270245,jswinter40,2011-02-11 08:36:00,127,Cabelas tourney trail series and Gander's guide sereis in IM7/8 would be fine choices as well. My father-in-law uses the tourney trail and loves it. thinks I'm nuts for paying any more than that. what reel you plan on useing?
1270261,jsmyers,2011-02-11 08:59:00,198,"I've got a 5 year old Shimano Sahara 750 that I'm going to put on it. It is a little undersized, but I'll save money by not buying another reel, and I use pretty low diameter line. I have two UL rigs, and I'll shift my new 500 Sienna from the cheap rod to the better rod if I use the UL up there.I've used Shimano spinning reels ever since my first spinning reel when I was a kid. It was pretty much the same thing they sell now as the IX.I thought about the Tourney Trail, but it is a more moderate action and slightly heavier power than the shimano or the st. croix. I think that is my budget fall back though."
1270272,jswinter40,2011-02-11 09:20:00,127,sahara is a great reel. I agree with you about the tourney trail. A nice rod but I like my Triumph better. That said I also have a cabelas prodigy rod (step up from Triumph) for $99 but may be onsale in the bargain cave at cabelas.com for your price range. Bargain cave is a good place to surf for deals. their Prodigy line and XML line of rods go on sale there quite often.
1270783,jsmyers,2011-02-12 21:39:00,198,Thanks for all the advice. Looks like I'm stepping down to the Tourney or another similarly priced rod. Got to save the money so I have bait to use!
1270882,Tweak,2011-02-13 09:56:00,685,"Because of the big accidental pike, hooksetting in deeper water, and the bigger fish in general I would go Medium. I think a Croix 68mxf would be very hard to beat for what you describe. It will handle 1/4 oz and up jig with ease. A Loomis 782 would be hard to beat as well. Stretch your dollar by looking for a used rod. Walleye central and Craigs list is a great place to look."
1270905,AllenW,2011-02-13 10:46:00,11482,"X2, also if money is a object stay away from the $300 rods, you don't need them.A medium action/fast tip should let you feel those light jig bits and still have enough rod to cast lures with.4# test seems a bit light to me, maybe 6-8# or even better yet a 10-12# main line with 6-8# leaders should keep those heavier hardbaits from disappearing and still give your lighter jigs and such the action you want.Al"
1270909,Mike Borger,2011-02-13 10:56:00,1554,"Yep. Not that I need anymore rods, but I bought a brand new med action Avid on Kijiji yesterday for 50 bucks. Couldn't resist."
1269946,jsmyers,2011-02-10 12:35:00,198,"I probably should post this in a different subforum, but I'm hoping it can stick here because my application is specific to the sort of fishing you do in NW Ontario.I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the best all around rod to use primarily for bass and walleye. I don't have the luxury of getting multiple walleye rods between finances and transportation. I need one rod that can do it all (but I recognize the tradeoffs).I have a couple of Medium Heavy rods I'll use for pike, and I also have a 5'6"" ultralight.I'm thinking about getting a medium light or perhaps light power rod. It will be graphite, with a relatively fast tip. I'll use this rod for jigs, possibly live bait rigs, small spinnerbaits, slip floats, and casting small cranks, inline spinners, or spoons. I'll probably usually use a 3-4# diameter superline. When casting larger lures or expecting to tackle bigger fish, I'll use my medium heavy rod.I think it will be a 7 foot, 2 piece, but what do you all think about it being either light or medium light?My UL is a Clarus, and I'm happy with it, so I'm thinking about the ML (CSS-70ML2A):http://www.cabelas.com/catalog/produ...oductId=703848It is rated for 1/8-1/2 oz. That seems about right to me. There are a number of other similar rods I'm also considering. There are very few light power rods. Should I seek one out? Is ML too heavy?"
1269951,Mike Kansas,2011-02-10 12:48:00,1463,"The 7' rod will work great for both Jigging Walleye and casting for Smallies. I would go with medium and soft tip. Medium will give you plenty of backbone and the soft tip will enhance bite sensitivity. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1269966,jswinter40,2011-02-10 13:34:00,127,"Not sure on your budget but a great rod for what you speak of is a St. Croix Avid 6'9"" medium light extra fast (AVS69MLXF). For a cheaper alternative is the new St. Croix Eyecon 7' medium light fast (ECS70MLF2). If you really want to spend you could step up to the Legend Extreme rods but I would guess if you were willing to spend that kind of money you could buy 2 rods for each of your applications."
1269967,ohiojmj,2011-02-10 13:39:00,1262,"I like my two St. Croix premier 7' Med, fast action tip for Canada's variety of species. Not sure I'd like to attempt a 20# plus pike with a ML. For back-up, I have 6-6 and 7' M Berkley Bionix ($50 at wallyw) that I ordinarily use for lake erie jigging or perching. Can't live without a fast tip."
1269968,jswinter40,2011-02-10 13:40:00,127,"Oops sorry, I did pay atttention to your Clarus choice. I don't have experience with the Shimano rods (only the reels) i would think what you have picked would work great. I would for surely get a ML vs something lighter. The St. Croix in that price range would be the Triumph series and they are a very good rod for the money if you are interested."
1269972,jsmyers,2011-02-10 13:48:00,198,"Thanks for the input. Sounds like there is no light camp.Since I already have an UL that I'll use if I'm catching a lot of bananas or targeting perch, ML seems like a better bet anyway.I'm not going to get a straight medium, it is too similar to the pike rods I already have. I won't target pike of any size with a ML, but I think I could handle one if need be. I've landed pike around 30"" on short UL rods before. The 7' length is a big help. Being patient and keeping cool are probably the most important things. It is funny how so many people kinda freak out when they hook a bigger fish. Then again, I've never had a 50"" musky thrashing around on the end of my line...I might freak out them.I wasn't really looking for specific model recommendations. (But I will consider them if you want to spend the time.) I don't even know what my budget is yet ($70 is probably the highest it could be)."
1269973,jswinter40,2011-02-10 13:48:00,127,"Here are the model numbers of the Triumphs that would be worth a look are: TRS66MLF2 and TRS70MLF2. These rods are made from the same exact blanks as the Premiers but made out of country. ($70) I have a 6' ML Triumph I use for vertical jigging lighter jigs, works great for the money."
1269999,Lovetofish,2011-02-10 15:04:00,458,"I take a couple Fenwicks to Canada and I target walleye. For $100 it's hard to beat an HMG M-MF, pick your length. They will handle any northern you hook too. If your lucky enough to pass through Spirit Lake, Iowa I spotted them in the outlet store across from the Berkley plant for $60."
1270014,REG,2011-02-10 15:44:00,445,"I like the light actions. They just make every fish fun. I've got an All-Star 6' light and (I think) 6.5' St Croix light action and I like them both equally. After fishing with those, even a medium light seems too stiff to me. I would probably use ultra light but too many UL's seem a little too whippy for me. We almost always snag some big northerns while jigging for walleyes and you will get them in. I just back reel and take my time."
1270134,jsmyers,2011-02-10 20:17:00,198,"It is good to see that somebody spoke up for the light rod.My dad has a 6' light HMX that he will be using right along side of me.I think that the TRS70MLF2 might be the rod for me. I hadn't been looking that carefully, I was thinking that St. Croix didn't make a 2 piece of what I was looking for. (They don't make a Triumph MH rod, which I'd be interested in as well.)Can anybody tell me how St. Croix SCII compares to the IM7 used in the Clarus I'm also looking at. They are the same price if I want to mess with a rebate on the Shimano. Is it fair to say that these rods are pretty equal?(Of course, I might look more carefully at the budget and decide that $40 or $50 is a more appropriate number...)"
