1269689,fishforbrains,2011-02-09 17:14:00,12,"I love my prop as much as the next guy and would never be caught out on the woods without a good map, But which one should I spend my hard earned money on? My spots maps have served me well over the years and at 12 bucks a piece they seem like a pretty good value.Yeah I know the marked fishing spots are a mile wide when the hot spot is the size of a car. And with a body of water the size of the Woods the map is quite busy and small and a little hard to read. But with more than a few hours of map studying you can get a little comfortable navagating around an area like the sabaskong mine fields. That being said A few folks have shown a preferance for the Offishal dept of ministries maps. I have never seen one myself. Are they more site spicific? do they have nicer colors? Do they tell you where the fish really are. What do they cost? where do you get one?Please a little help here for the fish."
1269695,J-Man,2011-02-09 17:28:00,191,"Do a quick search and you will find a good thread on this exact subject.canadian hydrographic maps are the ONLY map you should use when you are navigating LOTW and any other lake the has one available.I wont rant like I may have in the old thread, but let me just say...anytime I'm asked to mark a map and someone busts out a map like that...... I drag them up to the lodge from the gas dock to show them the difference between a crap crap map and a hydrographic map. I dont EVER recall a time that the person didn't pick up a real map, whether it be right that instant or a day or two later. Give Thorne Brothers Custom Rod & Tackle in Blaine, MN a call. That is the easiest way to get one in the US...any resort on LOTW should have them as well. The one you want for Sabaskong Bay is 6214. The next section west is the Basil Channel and is #6215. We retail them for $20 plus tax and they should be close to that at Thorne as well. You can't rely on a map to point out ""hot spots."" That is what resort operators, friends with experience in the area, and guides are for."

1269835,tyeeguy,2011-02-10 07:18:00,111,I have both for the area of LOW that I fish. I haven't looked at the Hot Maps map for a couple of years.I never leave the dock without the Hydrographic map on my lap (even with a gps map).
1269843,muskyman73,2011-02-10 07:38:00,402,"ah the mine fields back in stony portage ; our group has a few camel humps named after each of us. Last but not least are the deadheads. I hit one coming out of caribou in miles bay a few years back. One thing is for sure, keep your eyes open !"
