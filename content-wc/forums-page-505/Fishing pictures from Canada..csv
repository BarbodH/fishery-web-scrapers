1270510,mbay1455,2011-02-11 21:13:00,25,Great vids ER620. You do a fantastic job of capturing it all so others can see. I've been to O'Sullivan many times and going back this year at the end of July. It was fun looking at all your pics and figuring out where you were fishing. Bob and Shelly have made great improvements in recent years. Looking forward to getting back there this year. Great looking fishing machine you've got there too.

1269131,tv4fish,2011-02-08 07:19:00,2694,"Saluki - Couple of great videos Especially the moose cow/calf. We have had moose swim across in front of us on a couple of trips.gibby: When you see the ""night danger"" signs - it's for real - if you're going to drive at night, you definitely need to be watching for them."
1269136,81Saluki,2011-02-08 07:32:00,97,"tv4fish: Couldn't agree with you more about driving danger at night! Went bumper to knees with a young moose once and it scared the ""BeJesus"" out of everyone in the vehicle. Was on 502 heading north and, after topping a hill, saw a young moose in the middle of the road. Hit the brakes hard and barely got stopped in time. Didn't bother it though ... it casually walked off to the side of the road."
