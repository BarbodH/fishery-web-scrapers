I have a camp down at the south end and was visited by the game wardens last weekend of May 2009 - just to ensure that we realized this fishing ban was in effect.Just wanted to give you a heads upToddhttp://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/english/p...es/zone-14.asp"

1266328,UnclePeter,2011-01-30 12:41:00,2,After years of fishing out of Caesars camps we are trying Air Tamarac this year. We will be fishing out of Matawa bay cabin#46 from June 5-9. Any advice would be appreciated including feedback on the outfitter. The above pics are excellent thanks. I'm thinking from past experience that the walleye will just be coming off the spawn the week before we arrive and hopefully the week that we are there.
1266712,a3dad,2011-01-31 12:35:00,115,"Uncle,I think you'll love Air Tamarac. Been using them for 12 years. Great outfitter. I believe cabin 46 is the bigger cabin on that bay. Stayed there once and once in the smaller cabin #45. Jean puts a lot of money back into their operation. I know that he rebuild #45 about 2 years ago. Not sure if he updated 46 but it was a great cabin when we were there. He also is putting new boats on all bays this year. If you look at the picture named Mattawa1, all the way to the most southern end of the bay, there is an area that is closed until June 1st (for spawning). In early June you (more than likely) will be fishing just post spawn. There is flowing water at that spot and you should give this a shot. Probably the best spot in the bay. good luck!Kevin"
1266757,UnclePeter,2011-01-31 15:27:00,2,Kevin thanks for the tips and the pics. I'll take all the help I can get. After fishing with Caesars since 1996 it was time for a change. We tried to book Herbert but that was a 2 year wait for a week that worked for all of our party. Thanx again.-Pete
1269790,kegisfly,2011-02-10 01:10:00,22,"duffitdad and unclepeter...The Gouin should offer you a great fishing experience. Air Tamarac is a quality outfitter that should put you on the fish. I haven't fished matawa bay, but if you want specifics on pike fishing techniques/lures and/or some of the travel details (facilities offered, getting to Clova, etc.) I can offer some help. Just send me a PM for those specifics.Kirk"
