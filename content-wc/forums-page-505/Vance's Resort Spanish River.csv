Very populated area with a lot of fishing pressure, not to mention the jet skis and speed boats pulling tubers. Can't help you with the resort but I can tell you that if you are looking for a true Canadian experience, you will have to go much further north."

When I was up there in July two years ago I did not see a single jet ski or tube. We typically would only see few boats all day. Richard B, the cabin we stayed in was nothing fancy but very adequate for what we needed. I believe the cabins vary in size and age. The hosts were very nice. I thought the fishing was good but bare in mind I am used to fishing small ponds for bass and bluegill down in Indiana. If I had my own boat I would be back there in a heartbeat."

Their web site is www.waterfalls lodge.com E-mail is [email protected] Never been there but did speak to a man that goes there each year and he brags on the place ,the owners and the fishing.Good luck"
1271062,moose1878,2011-02-14 06:00:00,9,A fishin buddy of mine has been to Vance's and has nothing but good things to say about the camp and the fishing. I have also heard alot of good things about Brennan Harbour Resort which is in the same area. I have never been to either place but would be willing to give it a try sometime.
