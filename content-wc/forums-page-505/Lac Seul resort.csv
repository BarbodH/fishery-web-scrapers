1267762,jswinter40,2011-02-03 10:38:00,127,Thanks for correcting me Ben. Like i said I ahve nothing against moosehorn. I have spoken with them on occasion on the Lake and I don't have a any bad things to say. You would know more intimate details than I. I would think if guides are leaving Andersons and going to moosehorn than that must say something. either way both will put you on fish. personally if the money situation wasn't a big deal then the Anderson's Outposts on the NE side of LS is what I would choose. moosehorn has a good restaurant too.
1270416,whiteyswhaler,2011-02-11 15:48:00,7,Any of you guys know anything about Lac Seul Outposts located in Chamberlain narrows? Any info would be helpful.
1270591,JDP,2011-02-12 08:34:00,1457,Do an adavanced search of Walleye Central's Canada forum and you will find a ton of information and feedback.
1265173,sammy2964,2011-01-26 18:24:00,17,http://www.fishlacseul.com/outpost.htmlAny info on this resort (specifically the outpost in mckenzie bay) would be greatly apprecited. Looking to book in 2012.ThxDave
1265325,JDP,2011-01-27 08:07:00,1457,"I recommend doing an advanced search on this website (Canada Forum) for ""Scout Lake Resort"" there is a ton of feed back (over 2 pages of postings).I stayed there in 1999, so my experience/feedback is quite dated.So I will refrain from commenting.If you stay at the Outpost you will find great walleye fishing in the area.What time of year are you planning to go?Have you fished the west portion of Lac Seul previously?"
1267008,Thumpr50,2011-02-01 10:05:00,139,"We have stayed at Scout Lake Resort for several years and have been very happy. Centrally located, bit of a boat ride to McKenzie Bay but plenty of good fishing between. My wife & I do a couples trip with her sister and her husband every year in August. We keep going back for a reason."
1267017,Guest,2011-02-01 10:27:00,0,"I know that this is not in the McKenzie Bay area, but can anyone give me a preference between Anderson's lodge and Moosehorn Lodge? I have heard good things about both and need some input. I know that you cannot reach Lac Seul directly from Anderson's, but what about Moosehorn? Likes/dislikes would be appreciated. Looking for a trip in June 2012."
1267549,lacseul810,2011-02-02 18:04:00,22,"I go to the Andersons outpost every year, it is a bit pricey but I love the solitude of it and not having any of the pressures of the lodge. You CAN reach Lac Seul directly from Andersons main lodge but as far as Moosehorn I have not been there so I dont have anything to say about them. I would highly recommend Andersons though speaking from my experience, they run a top notch operation up there."
1267626,jswinter40,2011-02-02 21:28:00,127,andersons has outpost cabins on Lac Seul. I don't know if you have looked into that. they are in the far northeast section of the lake near chamberlain narrows. I have seen and talked with guides from both places and I would personally chose Andersons. i feel their guides have been aorund longer and have a wealth of knowledge about lac seul. that being said i really have nothing bad to say about moosehorn either. I believe moosehorn accesses lac suel from the pelican falls area if the water is high enough but it is a hike to the northeast sections where I run into their guides.
1267627,BenBeattie,2011-02-02 21:29:00,232,From Anderson's main camp it's a loooong run to Lac Seul by boat but it can be done. Guests at Anderson's fishing lac seul drive cars (20 min drive approx) to their boat cache each morning then drive back to the camp after fishing. Moosehorn is 10-15 mins to Lac Seul by boat. I would say talk to the operators of each camp and see who impresses you more. PM me if you want more info.
1267629,BenBeattie,2011-02-02 21:35:00,232,3 of Moosehorn's top guides are ex-anderson's guys with close to 50 years experience between them. The run to the NE is a lot shorter from Moosehorn if you include the car ride from anderson's. That and moosehorn boats have 150's and andersons has 115's.
1267702,tv4fish,2011-02-03 07:48:00,2694,"Ben: If you were to boat from Anderson's to Lac Seul - don't you have to also go through Pelican Rapids? I know there used to be a guy that would portage your boat to bypass the Rapids, but I don't think that that's available anymore?"
1267703,BenBeattie,2011-02-03 07:54:00,232,Both Andersons and Moosehorn have to run pelican falls to get to lac seul from their main camps. WHen the water is high this is no problem. The portage does still operate when the water is too low. Anderson's does keep boats on the Lac Seul side and most of their guests drive to the boat cache and go from there.
