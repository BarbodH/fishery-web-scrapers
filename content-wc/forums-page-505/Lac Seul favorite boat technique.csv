Anchoring2. Drifting3. Backtrolling4. Forward trolling5. Electric motor positioning on structureScott"
1258953,Pooch,2011-01-01 18:32:00,4619,"Which ever method is catching decent fish is my favorite. Lac Seul is not really much different than other Canadian lakes. Maybe alot more sand and flats and less rock structure than other lakes our group fishes, but it fishes about the same.My generalized thinking is this:Parking over a spot and jigging will many times catch more fish.Trolling will catch fewer fish, but more quality fish.If the wind is cooperating then drifting can cover more ground and contact more fish than being parked on a spot and waiting for a pod of fish to wander by.It is going to be long winter for those of us who don't poke holes in the water.Pooch"
1258990,tv4fish,2011-01-02 05:29:00,2694,In our experience - the depth and structure type is important - we typically work the wind swept points by sliding in and out until we find the right depth where the fish are. Once we find'em - we will use a controlled drift and try to stay at that depth. Been workin' for more than a few years.
1259231,Mike Kansas,2011-01-03 09:08:00,1463,"Been fishing Walleye on Lac Seul for 25 years and if I could only use one method it would be back trolling. However the most effective use of back trolling is really simply forward and reverse changes in order to keep the jig vertical to the bottom while also paying special attention to the depth finder and working depth changes hard. Pay special attention to windy structure and use just a heavy enough jig to get to the bottom. keep your line tight and stay in touch with the jig at all times. Dragging cranks and spoons can be very effective. Usally produces less fish than jigging but overall trolling will produce larger fish. Bottom bouncing on flats can also be productive but if I had only one bait or could only employ one method it would be vertical jigging. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1259539,skindzier,2011-01-04 12:13:00,137,Electric trolling motor just enough to stay on & work structure
1259597,wallydave,2011-01-04 14:56:00,2151,"For the late May early June Ear falls end of LS, anchoring at the rapids, mouth of the river and windy points usually works very well. For July on LS, check with your camp owner, but, when we have been late in June and depending on high or low water levels you will be fishing deeper sections and by then weedbeds will be growing. The camp or lodge owner will want to put you on the fish! That is why they are in busines! Good luck! I have 150 days to go for my next Lac Seul trip! It is going to be a long winter!"
1259844,BenBeattie,2011-01-05 14:12:00,232,I'm a die-hard backtroller. I prefer the open layout of tiller boats and backtrolling can't be beat for precise boat control in all conditions. I can move along a contour looking for fish or hold the boat over a small area when we're on fish.
1270402,jswinter40,2011-02-11 14:57:00,127,back trolling as BEN said there last. and new to this year's trip I-PILOT! Its gonna be an awesome tool up there!
1270482,fishman10,2011-02-11 19:57:00,226,i also love to backtroll spinners and bootom bouncers over structure.
1270548,orchard frank,2011-02-12 04:28:00,1900,"Agree that backtrolling worked best for me under most conditions, (but I'd think that a nice Terrova would work great too), but we also caught a ton of fish while anchored when it was windy. Find a good reef or point, anchor up and fish vertical over the side, or cast cranks or spinners. Fish are on the move in the wind. We would get a flurry of bites, then a pause, then another flurry. Can move around by letting out line or switching cleats on the bow, or even cranking your engine over to one side or the other. Lot less work than fighting the wind."
