1270329,jsmyers,2011-02-11 11:56:00,198,"If you search the archives of the board, you can read a tiny bit about catching lake trout, which are present in most northern Ontario walleye lakes.You can read a lot about catching lake trout in deep water in the summer or on the ice in the winter.But what about in spring season? Lake trout are unique in that they spawn in the fall, so they're not at all influenced by the same things that push pike, perch, bass, and walleyes into their locations before and after the spawn in the spring.Does anybody have any experiences with lake trout in the first week or two of walleye season? What constitutes good lake trout structure during this time of the year?Points? Current? Rocks? Wind? Humps?I suppose that finding young whitefish or ciscos is key, but where are they? One thing that occurs to me is that where wind stacks up surface water, plankton might be more plentiful, attracting the pelagic baitfish.I've also heard about catching lakers near rapids. Do we think they're feeding on spawning suckers? Young male walleyes? Walleye eggs?Of course once the water warms, they are pushed deeper, but where are they when they pretty much have the run of the lake, before it warms up?"
1270359,plumberjoe,2011-02-11 12:46:00,54,We have fished Sturgeon Lake either the first or second week of the season for the past 6 years and always find the Trout shallow. We fish main lake points. The better ones seem to be in areas where the main lake necks down creating current. They seem to be better when the wind is blowing on them. We either troll these points with rapalas and thundersticks or we will sit on the point and soak cut bait with slip sinkers. We might sit for an hour without a bite then catch 5-6 in the next 30 minutes. Fish seem to move up on these points and feed then move back out. Most of the fish we catch are in less than 20ft of water. Lots of fun when they move in.
1270376,Bill Krejca,2011-02-11 13:28:00,6107,"I'm not an expert, but I try to find an island or land mass point near deep water that is exposed to a strong potential wind, from more than one direction, e.g., a wind that could blow across it from either west or north. The wind would not necessarily have to be blowing very strong, just be exposed enough so that it could. Drop-offs are a bonus. 20-40 ft of water works for me. I like to drop 2 anchors, one in front, one in back, if possible, and just still fish on the bottom, out of the boat, using a slip sinker, treble hook, and cut bait. Bill"
1270582,v-bay gord,2011-02-12 07:48:00,3168,"Here's a few observations that have worked for me. Long line trolling with Husky Jerks or other shallow running baits before surface water temps reach 52 degrees. During this cold water period the trout can be virtually anywhere.....right against shore, out in the middle, in old weed beds, rock piles etc. They are feeding on whatever is available. They are also interested in insect larvae which they can route out of muck and sand areas. After the temps get above 52 you will need to run deeper baits such as Rapala Tail Dancers. You can often use your locator to spot these fish.....they will be suspended in deeper locations and are often on the move to their summer haunts.....check out channels and routes leading to the deeper sections of the lake."
1270815,ILScott,2011-02-13 05:30:00,139,In early June with the water stll around 50 degrees we fish shallow around 10-20 feet on a big sand bar. We long line spinner rigs like we are fishing for walleye tipped with a minnow. Or we will use a five of diamonds. Last year we went in the middle of june and fished for them in 40 feet of water but same technique. My partner and I sometimes have over 100 feet of line out in 10-20 feet of water. Other people think we are nuts when we do this but they have witnessed us catching the fish so now they use this technique.
1270977,BenBeattie,2011-02-13 16:48:00,232,"Depends on water temps, if it's earl ice out and warm spring the trout may be deeper by the time walleye opener rolls around. If they are, dipsey divers are a great way to get baits deeper. Spoons and jointed rapalas are deadly behind dipseys. This way you don't have to have a lot of line out either and you can make more precise trolling passes over structure and tighter turns. That being said, long line trolling also catches a lot of spring trout up here. Everything from spinners to spoons to shallow and deep cranks catches them. Run a planar board to get shallow diving baits in tight to shore. Man, this is making me look forward to ice out lake trout!!You're on the right track with structure... rocky points, and shorelines near basins. Play the wind. Bottleneck areas are key. They usually have an associated point and saddle. Covering water is the name of the game... troll, troll, troll until you catch."
1271682,jsmyers,2011-02-16 09:55:00,198,Do you run into many pike when long-line trolling?Do you find that trout are leader shy? I'd be worried about sticking a $5-10 bait on 100' of line in a lake full of pike.What about walleye? It sounds like a decent way to find some big walleyes too.
1271740,v-bay gord,2011-02-16 12:32:00,3168,"You can run into pike and even muskie if you are hugging shorelines or structure while trolling. Most often, in my experience, when the water is cold I have had more walleye hitting my lure than the toothier critters. I use light mono with no leader and rarely lose a lure. I think trout are sensitive to leaders so I would either go without, or perhaps use a flourocarbon leader if you are concerned about bite-offs."
1271780,briand,2011-02-16 14:18:00,48,"lakers in early spring can be anywhereVast sandy bays is always a good start.with a small silver spinner and a live minnow or a silver spoon. As well in stained waters don't be afraid to troll in 10 feet of water.In early spring I've seen trout with ants beetles & frogs in there stomaches.But as the water warms in late may or early june I look for deeper water, but still fish shallow. I look for shores that drop off real fast and deep, and even better if it runs off a reef.That's a perfect place for lunch. There's been days when guys on shore doing better the guys in boats.A live minnow or sucker belly.AS for lure day in and day out for us has been the gibbs teaspoon. Take off the trebble hook and place a good sharp single hook with a live minnow. We prefer the live minnow over a spoon for those days that the trout are turned off. They will follow for long distances and nibble.On those off days try something different. In spring time in cold water they can be anywhere."
1271813,camp chef,2011-02-16 15:30:00,915,We have never had a problem with leaders on Trout. A 12 inch titanium leader insures that a big pike or muskie will get to play too.
