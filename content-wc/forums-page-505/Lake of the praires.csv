1270612,Thunderbucket,2011-02-12 09:37:00,323,are you talking paper map or digital map for a sonar?
1270677,ranger22,2011-02-12 13:25:00,124,paper or digital.
1270708,Thunderbucket,2011-02-12 16:12:00,323,As far as digital good luck the provincial gov. is soo uptight about royalties for a mapped lake that we will never likely see a navionics chip in my lifetime. For paper you could try.http://www.fishingmapsplus.com/manit...hazonesj-s.htm
