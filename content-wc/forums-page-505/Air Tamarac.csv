1269789,kegisfly,2011-02-10 00:45:00,22,"I have also used Air Tamarac to fish the Gouin. I agree with Wall1, a3dad and mr-fish. The Gouin is a vast body of water. Every outfitter and private camp could be full and you would still have plenty of water to fish. The Gouin is a fish factory as far as numbers of both walleye and pike. Although you will catch some nice specimens of both, I believe the average size at Gouin may be less than some other bodies of water. Anyone of average fishing skill who does some research and listens to the owners of Air Tamarac will not be disappointed with the fishing there. It is my belief that Lake Hebert will produce better size walleyes. We had one hiccup with Air Tamarac's service last year, but their service in other areas and in past years was excellent. Travel to the base in Clova is the worst part of this trip. You should expect to be on a passable, but, bone rattling, potentially hazardous, and remote gravel road for about 4 hours. The plane rides have all been a great experience."

1263505,mr-fish,2011-01-21 08:45:00,58,"Can't help with the Lake Hebert part of your question but have flown into the Gouin Reservoir with Air Tamarac the last 3 years.Nice family run business,husband,wife,children, not some agent.They only concentrate on fishing no hunting packages. Every year we have gone they have been upgrading something, cabins,motors, showers. Nice to see them putting money in and not just taking it out.They have there own planes and we have always departed on time.Hope you can make it to the Syracuse Sports Show this weekend and talk to them.If you have any questions let me know"
1263665,a3dad,2011-01-21 19:30:00,115,"been using them for 10 years to their outposts on the Gouin. Excellent run outfitter. No BS, they mean what they say and say what the mean. Can highly recommend them. I have never experienced Hebert but I hear good things."
1264409,NY Walleye,2011-01-24 16:36:00,78,Thanks for the info guys. Still looking for anymore on Herbert
1264415,a3dad,2011-01-24 16:51:00,115,did you do a search on this forum? plenty of information avail.
1265150,Wall1,2011-01-26 17:29:00,17,NY Walleye- i sent you a PM to contact me about Herbert-did you get it been there many times and would be able to tell you about herbertlet me knowWall1
1265527,ed08walleye,2011-01-27 18:34:00,27,"What is the solitude of their camps (on Gouin)? They have cabins in several areas, but what about other outfitter camps? I would be concerned if Air Tamarac's camp is full and then another outfitter has fishermen."
1265566,Wall1,2011-01-27 20:53:00,17,"Ed- If you never been to the Gouin it is had to understand just how vast a body of water it is. Over 65 miles end to end and i dont know how wide. Many of the Bays are miles long. The first 3 years we were there we never left the bay and did real well. Tamarac Camps are well spread miles apart - mainly at the back of the larger Bays of Sarana- Mattatwa and Plumenton. Many a days goes by with out seeing another boat and it is a very easy place to get lost if you dont know the place. Sometimes nice to see other fisherman. While there are other outfitters on the Gouin, the total amount of camps are so small in relation to the amount of water- all the camps could be full and you would not even know it. It is truly the last place to concern yourself with crowded water. There are really 1000's of idlands- bays and weed beds. Hard to understand until you see it - hope this helps all.Yoiu can do no better than Jon and Eliane at Tamarc- been there past 15 + years"
