1268789,Jig Man,2011-02-07 10:26:00,95,I would try a major Hotel. We park our car at a waterpark in the Wisconsin Dells every summer. Never had a problem.
1268831,dutchboy,2011-02-07 12:05:00,5717,I am a half hour West of I-35 on your way to Duluth. If you don't find anything closer you are free to park here. Send a pm if interested.

1268900,Mr Ranger,2011-02-07 14:23:00,272,We have left a truck at the public parking garage in downtown Duluth. It has worked very well and never had a problem. Like it as you can park under a roof from any bad storms or stuff. If your interested let me know and can give you the directions and phone number to call. They do charge and think it was $30.00 for the week which I thought was reasonable.

1269440,phishfearme,2011-02-08 20:29:00,1242,many thanks for the help guys - i think we have at least two great options now. as for the steelers - i fully believe that they were outplayed in the big game. i simply have to point to the dropped passes by that packers receivers. if just half of them were caught it wouldn't have been that close. although - receivers do tend to drop many passes when they know palamalu is nearby. so those of you from cleveland who have to wear a steeler's jersy on you canada trip this year - TFB. i can't wait to see the required photo. and i hope i'm still alive when the brownies are 6-2 in super bowls!! phish
