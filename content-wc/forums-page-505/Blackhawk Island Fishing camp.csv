Cabins very nice....only reason we switched to another camp was because it is on the mainland. Sandy's is on an island; weather can delay you from getting into or out of camp. We also take a lot of stuff which is a little more difficult when you have to load in a boat and take it across the water. If its muskies you're after, Bill is top notch, he will put you on fish!"

1269229,Fish_on,2011-02-08 11:48:00,1856,I have never stayed at the camp but I have dropped by there for a visit with Bill. Here is a little background. Bill Sandy grew up muskie fishing the angle... his parents were the owners of Monument Bay Camp for many years. Bill divided his time between muskie fishing and working at the camp. He started guideing at a young age. He is one of the most knowledgeable people on fishing that part of LOW. He has probably caught more muskies on a black and silver Mepps Muskie Killer than just about any man alive. His camp has a very good reputation. I am going to the angle a couple times this summer and I may stay there for a change. Sorry this doesn't opffer muchinfo about the camp itself but this type of info might help you make your decision.
