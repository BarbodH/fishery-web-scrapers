In particular, try to pick a small island away from the main land mass. Middle of the lake would be ideal, but probably not much possible. Also, don't camp along a narrowing of the land mass, such that animals will be passing through your camp just to get to another large land mass on the other side. Camping on ""funnels"" is just not a good idea! Besides the visitor thing, try to find safe harbor for your boats. There is nothing worse than having to get up in the middle of the night to try to reposition your boats to prevent them from busting up due to wave action. On second thought, there is something worse, and that is not waking up, and finding your boat extensively modified by the waves. Have fun, it doesn't get any better! Bill Krejca"
1268081,Fishoil,2011-02-04 11:17:00,1277,I'm planning a fishing trip to a remote Ontario lake where we will be sleeping in tents and cooking over a campfire. What precautions do I need to take to keep any bears from raiding our tents or food supply while we are out fishing or sleeping at night?
1268094,wallydave,2011-02-04 12:14:00,2151,"I guy I used to work with, would tent camp at Sep. Lake, sometimes twice a year. They would have a sleep tent and a cook tent. Bears would come in and go through the cook tent on an average of once a year. Check with the operator about bear safety tips, usually things like taking the left overs from cleaning Fish and supper and take them to a remote spot, away from the camp. Use heavy duty garbage bags to reduce the scent. My old work buddy would take a pistol in with him, not in a way I would recommend, but he did it any way, just in case he would say. Check with DNR, for tips about bears, or the camp operator! You may have heard this joke, two guys were camping when a bear came into camp, one guy started to put on his runing shoes, his buddy told him,"" You can't out run that bear!"" His buddy replied, "" I just have to out run you!"""
1268095,mbay1455,2011-02-04 12:15:00,25,Here's a link to some good general info. http://www.mountainnature.com/Wildli...ampingTips.htmThe site doesn't say it but do not bury your food waste anywhere near your campsite. Years ago we came back from fishing all day on our first day of camping and found a lot of digging and 3' around hole near the campfire. Apparently the people who were there before us had buried waste right near the camp fire. We cleaned out whatever was left and moved it a safe distance away.
1268102,Nimstug,2011-02-04 12:28:00,2605,"From what I remember from the instructions we received for our Boundary Waters trip....- Keep nothing scented in the tent, including items such as deodorant and soap. Keep those in the 'bear bag' with food.- Hang the bear bag in a tree with the bottom of the bag at least 15' above the ground and 10' away from the trunk.-When 'they' say no food in the tent, it includes any munchies. No chips, cookies, trail mix, etc. Hope you have a safe and enjoyable trip!NimstugThe physician can bury his mistakes, but the architect can only advise his clients to plant vines. -F.L. Wright"

1268122,Mike Borger,2011-02-04 14:02:00,1554,IMO you have a greater chance of getting hit by a bus than encountering a problem bear in remote areas. It's only the populated areas where bears have become conditioned to humans and are problematic. In my (slightly) younger years I spent many months travelling solo by canoe all over N/W Ontario and never once had a problem. That includes storing my food pack underneath my tents vestibule as well. I did however have issues with polar bears.
1268244,lenray,2011-02-05 08:25:00,467,"I have fished some remote areas--nothing like Solo- and I have tried everything I know to bring a bear into camp. Two years ago a bear bit into my 2 gallon gas tank that was left overnight on a portage lake we were going back to in the morning. He drained every drop with four holes in two corners. I clean fish at the tent site, cook there, have bacon and a lot of goodies--never have brought one in."
1268252,3M TA3,2011-02-05 08:42:00,2846,"I camp from two to three weeks in the Chapleau Game Preserve. There are more black bear there than any where else in the world. In 17 years, I've had only 1 bear lay claim to my campsite and needless to say he destroyed just about everything while rummaging around. The supply tent was shredded. I will say this. The bear in this area are probably used to humans because they too are all over the place. My guess is that if you're really remote you most likely won't have issues however if you do, it could totally screw up your plans. Bring a CD player and put on some Justin Beiber. That should keep them away."
1268261,guidedfishing,2011-02-05 09:07:00,531,"we spend 1 to 2 weeks annually in remote camp sites. Have been for many years, between the 3 - 4 trips we take yearly between remote camping and staying at an established camp it far more common to see bears at the established camp. In over 20 years of remote camping I can only remember two bear in counters in remote pack in camps. Once a bear came in and tore up a cooler (drank a few beers) and raided our food box, minor damage and cleaned up and did not come back. The other was years ago one of the boats had left some snacks in the boat in the morning they came down and the bear was in the boat. I did not see it but no damage was done. Just keep things picked up, and when we clean fish we always haul the guts away and dump them from a 5 gallon pail. I would be far more concerned about the weather and staying dry and how you will get or keep a fire going if you are dependent upon that. Tarping the tents and make sure sleeping gear is off the ground. You can do a lot of thing but if you allow your gear and sleeping bags to get damp or wet your last concern will be about bears. I might add no food in the tents. meals are prepared and eaten in a tarped area away from the sleeping tents. Any thing left over (not likely) is dumped with the fish guts and other items are burned. And if you have tin cans or other no burnable items. bag it and bring it out.. good luck GF"
1268377,outdoorsron,2011-02-05 16:47:00,843,Hello: I camp in Western Ontario for up to 2 weeks at a time. We camp on an Island and haven't had any problems. Yes I know bears can swim. We try to keep the camp as clean as possible. Just make sure you have the correct permits to camp. Good Luck O - R
