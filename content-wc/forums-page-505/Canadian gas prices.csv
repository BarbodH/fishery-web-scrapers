1272130,fishinnut 3446,2011-02-17 12:22:00,638,What the price of the diesel fuel going for?
1272164,hogridnfool,2011-02-17 14:06:00,349,Eastern Ontario = $121.9 to $126.9 / liter.
1271586,Further North,2011-02-15 21:29:00,2008,"What the heck does this mean?http://www.ontariogasprices.com/100.5? Per liter?Is 100.5 like a Canadian dollar + a nickle? So that's $1.05 Canadian dollars per liter...or about 3.97 Canadian dollars per US gallon?...or at today's exchange rate (1 CAD = 1.01249 USD), $4.02 a US gallon?Trying to plan expenses for this summer's fishing trip."
1271590,Outfitter17,2011-02-15 22:04:00,127,Around Fort Frances its around 1.299 per liter or $4.91 per US gallon in Canadian dollars or at this time approx. $5.00 US per us gallon.
1271604,fishman10,2011-02-16 04:09:00,226,in thunder bay it is 1.20 per litre. there are 4.5 litres in a canadian gallon. so 1.20 times 4.5= 5.40 canadian per gallon.
1271623,ohiojmj,2011-02-16 06:15:00,1262,"3.785 L = 1 galThose online prices are at gas stations, not boat docks or fishing camps. Multiply the highway gas station price by 1.25 to 1.50 for price in more remote settings, especially boat access only camps. I fill up my SUV, 27 gallons in boat and several 5 gallon cans before entering Canada. I'm also glad my Optimax gets good gas mileage.Between fule cost and rising camp prices, the Canada ventures are getting pricey, compared to my other option (cottage on nearby Lake Erie)."
1271664,tv4fish,2011-02-16 09:04:00,2694,"Hey Guys -------- It's says the trend is for ""falling"" gas prices"
1271666,ohiojmj,2011-02-16 09:10:00,1262,The trend will change. Summer is coming.
1271674,Outfitter17,2011-02-16 09:35:00,127,"fishman10,The question was what is the price in canadian liters converted to US gallons. ohiojmj has it right 3.785 liters = 1 us gallon.1 imperial gallon = 4.546 liters, but that's not what he was asking for."
1271725,adempsey,2011-02-16 12:03:00,963,"I'd say plan for at least $1.20/L or $4.54/gallon. If you're going up through Thunder Bay, that region has some of the highest gas prices in Ontario.This site posts prices regularly."
1271747,3M TA3,2011-02-16 12:49:00,2846,"And what school did you go to? Probably 5 quarters in a Canadian Dollar too, eh?"
1271767,Kruger,2011-02-16 13:53:00,259,There are 5 quarters in the Imperial dollar though.
