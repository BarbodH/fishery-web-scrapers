See the attached story, very interesting. It looks like the town was abandoned and everything was left right where it sat including personal belongings. Very eerie. I have been thinking of fishing up there and came across this.http://www.advrider.com/forums/showt...=394825&page=2"
1270486,trapperbob,2011-02-11 20:10:00,45,WTF happened???
1270490,Rich B,2011-02-11 20:16:00,1081,"I appreciate you sharing that link to the ""bike trip"" and the read on that abandoned site. Quite the adventure....thanks for sharing another ""up north"" story.....this winter is getting too long (ha) ! Rich B"
1271706,phishfearme,2011-02-16 11:05:00,1242,"ok - here's what i heard happened but someone would need to verify. back in the 80's a couple religious nuts from the US decided to open ""schools"" for the native kids - there was one for girls and one for boys. one of them had to close and all of a sudden there were boys and girls together. i think you know what happens when boys and girls are together. the religious guys found out about the ""bumping uglies"" and began to punish the kids - so severely that the kids revolted and took hostages! the OPP had to respond and closed the places down - deporting the religious types back to the US (thanks!). so the buildings stand to this day - pretty much stripped of anything of value but the buildings are still there. phish"
1271716,NP4ME,2011-02-16 11:35:00,378,"Hey Phish,Should all we ""religious types"" be bussed out and sent back to the good ol' US of A??? Or should we just dig a hole and bury them? Is there only room for athiests and nonbelievers? You know, our nation once believed in the good old man upstairs. The pledge even mentions His name...for now at least.NP"
1271878,phishfearme,2011-02-16 18:58:00,1242,"but the pledge didn't mention ""the man upstairs"" (or is it a woman) until it was added in 1954 due to the fear of godless commies."
