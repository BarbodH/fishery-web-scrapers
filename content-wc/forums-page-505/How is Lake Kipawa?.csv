523986,retire55,2002-09-16 07:46:00,1029,"Dave:Although our group tends to fish Lake Kipawa in early July, I've been considering an additional trip for myself in September. Consequently, I'm very interested in your comments/experience.Would you mind sharing what part of Lake Kipawa you fished (it's a big lake) and which outfitter you used? Was weather the problem or had the bite gone off? What methods were used and what depths were fished? Thanks in advance. Jay"
523987,Guest,2002-09-18 18:42:00,0,20 MILES FROM LANEIL AROUND CLEMENS BAY AREA FISHED IN 18 TO 30 FT TRIED EVERYTHING WE COULD THINK OF MAYBE IT JUST WASNT OUR WEEK HOW WELL DO YOU DO IN JULY THANKS GENE
523988,Guest,2002-09-18 18:56:00,0,"Had a great week up at Kipawa. Weather was unseasonably warm and only one night of rain. Walleyes were 15-25' for the most part and were hitting on jig/minnows(dead) and trolling Rapalas and other crank baits. Caught 80 walleyes myself most 15-17"" with best of 29"" which was normal for the group. Lake Trout were also good and many females had eggs. Stayed in sw end at Miwapanee lodge."
523989,retire55,2002-09-19 06:44:00,1029,"Gene:Six of us landed about 100 walleye, 70 of which were bigger than the minimum size during out trip (6-13 July). Weather cooperated with rain only once. Bugs were not an issue. Biggest walleye caught was 9.5 lbs. We also caught 4 lakers (averaged 5 lbs). We had three fish meals during the week. It doesn't get any better than that !!!! Trolling worm harnesses with leeches off bottom bouncers in 20 feet of water near structure was our best producing method. Marked a lot of suspended fish at 12 feet but couldn't entice them to bite regardless any method used. Looks like Clement Bay is near Corbeau Lodge - did you stay there? Jay"
