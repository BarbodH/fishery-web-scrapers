1269467,Nimstug,2011-02-08 22:49:00,2605,"That's about the right amount of money. With the timing of our trip, arriving on Fridays about 5:00 to 6:00 pm we cross to avoid any Saturday line issue. There is a bait shop / Can Am gas right next to the motel and a good restaurant next to the bait shop. When we leave we go west and have learned that taking 3rd Avenue will take you west without having to go back through the main part of Fort Frances. NimstugAlways thinking, always forgetting..."
1269547,wallydave,2011-02-09 09:14:00,2151,"I have a room at the Rainbow Inn Friday night in FF, I googled FF hotels. The room rate looked pretty good, I just need a place to sleep, shower and get on the road to Goose Bay on Lac Seul! 115 days before a great fresh walleye shore lunch!"
1269610,camp chef,2011-02-09 13:49:00,915,We stay at the Thunderbird out on Rainy lake...about 10 or 12 miles from IF.We have negotiated a $50 a night rate for two beds and stay there for cocktails and dinner. Great view.Wonderful Food and drinks and fishermen around to chat with. We do spend Thursday night there so I am not sure how much of a break they would give you on a Weekend night. We buzz right thru the border on Friday morning. We generally run our trips Friday to friday and travel up on Thursday when we can to take advantage of the lower traffic volumes and the discounted motel room on Thursday night
1223352,Glenman12,2010-07-29 07:45:00,762,We will be staying at the Days Inn next year..the other one next door was a Super 8 which we stayed at the two previous years..they have recently changed their name to Americas Best Value Inn & Suites or something close to that..
1223645,MorganMan,2010-07-30 06:08:00,341,"Steve of Madison- we are crossing the border when we get there and staying at La Place Rendevous (?). We have never stayed there, but looks to be a nice place online. We have always crossed on a weekday, but this year it will be the weekend so we will stay on the Canadian side to make any wait a non issue as we get to our camp Sunday. I stay in I Falls for work occasionally so have stayed in a few places there"
1223737,2746,2010-07-30 09:40:00,3206,You will enjoy La Place and it's resturante. Sits on the lake and a walk out on the docks and/or a cool one sitting on the patio is a great way to relax after a long day behind the wheel.
1223759,digjig,2010-07-30 10:29:00,146,"If going to Fort Frances, La Place Rendevous is a good Hotel. On Rainy, decent parking, good restuarant."
1223765,IaDave,2010-07-30 10:43:00,476,What do the rooms cost there?
1223970,MorganMan,2010-07-31 06:41:00,341,"We got two rooms for $105 per room since its a weekend.....plus whatever taxes and duty and fees and whatever they add on of course! Only heard good reviews here, so we are looking forward to it!"
1224471,wallydave,2010-08-02 13:25:00,2151,"Couple of years ago on my most recent trip to Ontario, my boat/cabin and trip partner reserved a room in a hotel in downtown FF. They had a diner, breakfast was pretty good, no time at all crossing on Friday night. The rooms were ok, all we needed was a place to sleep, shower and eat before heading to Lac Seul! Not much room for boat parking, but I'm sure we saved at least a couple of hours crossing early. I must be getting old I can't remeber the name of the hotel."
1224491,Mark R,2010-08-02 14:15:00,1538,we're goona go with the Falls Motel $59.00 plus tax for 2 double bed room. Super 8 in FF was about $110.00 as was the AmericInn. Thanks for the suggestions
1225877,Terwalleye,2010-08-07 22:05:00,166,"Steve.....shhhhh...don't tell anyone. Just kiddin. Our group did the same. Crossed border in 5 minutes. Stayed at the Adventure Inn. Has a bar and a great restraunt for breakfast in the AM. I called in Sept. 0f 2009 for our 2010 June trip and booked last three rooms. Already reserved for next June. Call now, if you're gonna; but the no line border crossing is well worth it and it costs the same."
1269398,raineymaster,2011-02-08 19:02:00,3,"Next time anyone heads up, give me a shout. I spend 4-5 days a month, third thursday through sunday of June-Nov up at our Grindstone Island cabin. [email protected]"
1223078,Mark R,2010-07-28 09:32:00,1538,"Help, I need a motel room in the International Falls area. I have stayed at the Holiday Inn there before but apparently it is no longer a HI or is out of business, What happened? any recommendations? I would need enough room in the parking lot to park a boat."
1223079,davenathe,2010-07-28 09:38:00,113,check out IF visitor website. Lots of lodging many with good size lots for boats.
1223105,downtown,2010-07-28 11:09:00,3,They just changed the name. Can't remember what it is now but stayed there in June
1223118,Mark R,2010-07-28 11:59:00,1538,I liked it cause it had a good restruant & bar. If anyone knows the new name Please post it Thanks
1223119,Jig Man,2010-07-28 12:07:00,95,It may now be called AmericInnhttp://www.hiifalls.com/http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserR...ECK_RATES_CONT
1223157,dutchboy,2010-07-28 14:54:00,5717,1-800-fallsmn is the phone number for the chamber of commerce.Days Inn out on Hwy 53 is one I use. Chamber can send a full list of them.
1223185,Blue Lk,2010-07-28 16:19:00,269,"Is that beside the ""Chocolate Moose""?good resterant!"
1223197,MorganMan,2010-07-28 16:46:00,341,"It is indeed call the Americinn now.....happened about 2 months ago. The restaurant and bar did serve good food, I can only assume it's still open?? There is a hotel (or 2) by the Chocolate Moose, but its not the Americinn or old Holiday Inn. I think it's a Days Inn. I have stayed both places when in town and preferred the Holiday Inn (now Americinn) on the west side of town."
1223258,P. Norts,2010-07-28 20:00:00,396,"Hey Mark, I have never stayed here myself but check out http://www.fallsmotel.org/. The locals at http://www.hotspotoutdoors.com/forum...2/1/Rainy_Lake, say nice things about the place and the owners. It does not look like anything fancy and I don't think they have a restaurant. As someone already mentioned there is always the Chocolate Moose and the Hardees. The Moose has excellent food and the Hardees has won awards for being the #1 Hardees in the country. The owner of the Hardees is the moderator on the hotspots forum. I am all about supporting the locals when we visit Rainy, those people are good people and it's their livelyhoold. Oh yeah, we usually hit, Giovanni's for pizza on our way out of town on our final night. Nice place if you have kids with you and the deep fried cheese curds are awesome. Mama Norts"
1223346,Steve of Madison,2010-07-29 07:19:00,230,"Here's a question for all you guys that stay in IF or the US for that matter? WHY? Cross the border that evening, stay in FF. The lines to cross in the evening are nothing, and there are several really nice motels on the FF side. Make your reservations well in advance to assure your room and enjoy the stay.I stay at the Super 8 in FF. Great rooms, pool, hot tub, breakfast and a new Bostons Pizza and bar in the parking lot. Well lit parking lot, never a problem and no lines at the border in the morning. We get a relaxing breakfast, visit Rainey lake sports for licenses and bait, last minute shopping for groceries at the really nice grocery store and we are on the road to camp by 9am. With the exchange rate at par, that's not the issue, and a few years ago when it favored the $$ it was like they were paying me to stay there. My 2 Cents!"
