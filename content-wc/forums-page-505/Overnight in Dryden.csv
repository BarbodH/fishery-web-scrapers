I did some research on this site, and they had good reviews. We wanted to stay near ear falls and near a boat launch. I spoke to them on the phone, and they were very helpful. I guess that is it!Scott"

1269517,GWC,2011-02-09 07:44:00,1021,"We usually stay at the Comfort Inn in Dryden. It's been clean & the price is reasonable. As for a fishing camp, we go to Poplar Point Resort on Gullrock Lake. We've always had good luck catching walleye & pike. We've really enjoyed the folks at Poplar Point Resort. Eddie & Lisa have really help make our trip special. Good clean facilities & reliable equipment."

We'll take our time, but it looks like the night before we arrive in Ear Falls, we might stay the night in Dryden to rest and get the last of the provisions.Any recommendations on a decent, safe hotel in Dryden near the main drag?Scott"

Don't stay at the motel (can't remember the name) which has a bar connected to it. The place was a dump, and my buddy got charged twice for the room. Not sure if he ever got it cleared up, but that is my recommendation. I wish I can remember the motel's name. It is on the main strip when you get in though.Fisherman 1792"
1267398,Ralfeee,2011-02-02 11:45:00,33,We have stayed at the Holiday Inn Express on our last several trips.
1267400,REG,2011-02-02 11:46:00,445,Holiday Inn Express - really small indoor pool for the kids and they have good boat parking. They provide some minimal breakfast in the morning as well. Or the Comfort Inn (I think) which isn't boat parking friendly but they're right next to the McDonalds.
1267401,skindzier,2011-02-02 11:47:00,137,"The Best Western is nice. It has a pool and a nice restaurant, but was around $100 a night. Haven't stayed in any of the others."
1267419,tv4fish,2011-02-02 12:13:00,2694,I believe you're talking about the Patrica Inn. Yup - smart idea to stay away from.
1267421,Skywagon,2011-02-02 12:20:00,1106,"I live near Dryden. There are several motels, probably most are fine. There is a Holiday Inn Express we had stayed at that is nice. The Best Western has recently been given a face-lift, I have not stayed there, but eat at their restaurant frequently and the place appears to be nice. The Trans Canada is a small motel, has very good food at their restaurant and would assume they have descent rooms, but have no personal experience. I cannot vouch for several of the other motels in town. As you probably know, during fishing season, from Duluth on will be hard to find a room. I would suggest booking now, or you may chance sleeping in the car.Possibly the place referred too with the bar, may have been the Kowality Inn, which is down town. Considering some of their motel clientele, I can imagine that may be on (the do not go to) list.Holiday Inn-807-223-3000Best WesternÂ–807-223-3201Trans Canada-807-223-2251"

1268088,scgibby11,2011-02-04 11:51:00,109,"Thank you all! I made a reservation for the Holiday Inn Express Dryden. Man, it can't come soon enough. I do get to chase some local great lakes salmon and walleye well before July. But.....Lac Seul. Can't wait.Scott"
1268123,northsky99,2011-02-04 14:21:00,41,which camp are you staying at and why? Our group is also from mi and looking for a new place to go
