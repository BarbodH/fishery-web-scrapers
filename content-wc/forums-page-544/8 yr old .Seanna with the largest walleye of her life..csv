1176356,kgeary,2010-03-09 23:49:00,88,I figure it is a good time to start wetting the appetite for some big walleye. This should help. Seanna has caught 28 and 29 inchers but this 32 was big and fat and thick even the fins were thick and not a mark or blemish on her. just a beautiful fish. Seanna and Hayden have been using slip bobbers and having great success last year by mid august they both wanted to use jigs. It didn't take long and just a bit of instruction and they were feeling big walleye bite in 20 plus feet of water. not bad. Of course dad is just a little proud. take care. kg
1176359,npauls,2010-03-10 00:22:00,220,That is an awsome fish. Congrats to you for having a little fishing machine and congrats to her on the monster.Can't wait for my little guy to be big enough to starting hauling in the eyes.nate

1176531,Knot Tellin,2010-03-10 11:29:00,386,"That is what it is all about. Congrats to a father who understands that the family that plays together stays together. I have 2 kids. A daughter who is 14 months. and a son whowill turn 7 in June. My daughter can quite reel one in YET, but she has been on the boat more than a few times. My wife likes to fish also and we love it. My son on the other hand has fish on the brain. We launched the boat 70 times last year and he missed 4 trips and most of them were late night trips when he had school the next day. His biggest eye is 27"" but he has gotten a bunch from 25"" to 27"". My goal is to get him one over 10lbs this year. One thing about him is he is not selfish about catching them either. We take turns catching the fish and keep it going from trip to trip. If we take some new they always get the first fish. I attached a couple of shots with us fishing there are more in my album if anyone like them. I think we should start a thread with pictures of kids and their fish.Hats off to Seanna. Thats one for the wall."
