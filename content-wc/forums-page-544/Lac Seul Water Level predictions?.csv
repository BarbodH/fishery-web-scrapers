1190602,rnnonmt,2010-04-17 15:09:00,992,Anyone have any good data/predictions for water levels on Lac Seul this year? Seems as though every 5-8 years there is an exceptionally low year. Comments/Thoughts??? Thanks

The good news, for those of us wanting higher water levels, is that the outflow was reduced even more than planned this past week due to dry conditions. Thus the lake is slowly starting to rise as a result. However, there is virtually no more snow to melt based upon what I have read and heard.As far as cycles for low water, the level in 2007 was very very low until a huge rainfall in late May/early June. My $.02....Maybe someone from the Lac Seul area could help us."
