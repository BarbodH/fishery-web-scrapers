1188867,Guest,2010-04-12 18:55:00,0,"I've found the best way to eat the 35"" walleye is to cut the cheek meat out and use that for perch bait and throw the rest of the walleye for the gulls, the perch you catch using the cheek meat are the best eating around.... just what I've heard"
1187097,nitroman,2010-04-07 21:18:00,368,How about that otter that always steals our bait and dines on our stringers any good recipies for them?
1187122,cowboyd,2010-04-07 22:47:00,33,IMHO after many trips up to Canada if you are talking shore lunch or meals right after catching then they both are great. Yes you do have the Y bones to deal with but in all honesty it is hard to taste the difference although I find smaller eyes to be better tasting.cowboyd
1187265,johnboat,2010-04-08 09:22:00,2014,The walleye for sure. Especially the ones caught in the sanctuary. I think it's the lack of motor oil from the suckers that don't fish there that make the water so clean and the fillets so white. They are picky tho so make sure you bring in your own minnows over the border and have an open container in the boat.
1187314,alanb,2010-04-08 12:01:00,56,"Lots of good recipe ideas - but nothing beats cedar plank smoked loon. Remove the feathers and clean the loon, pin it down to the cedar plank, smoke for 30 minutes, remove the loon from the cedar plank, throw the loon away and eat the cedar plank. Yummy! Alan"
1187317,Bill Krejca,2010-04-08 12:06:00,6107,"Yeah, even if they don't bite in the sanctuary, a huge treble hook with a little weight on the line worked along the bottom will really work to snag those puppies! Just cut around the snag hook marks in the side when filleting that white meat. Umm um, good eatin'! Bill Krejca"

1187589,Golden Eagle,2010-04-09 06:30:00,2642,D.M. has his enablers and together they've done more than their share to discourage visitors from coming to the Red Lake area. He's not a plus.
1173961,Guest,2010-03-03 08:01:00,0,When you're dressing the eagle make sure you save the tail feathers. There's a real market for them. I would suggest putting them on craigslist or ebay. Make sure you leave your phone number. You'll have lots of good folks coming by really quickly. Make sure you stick to your price.
1173980,deputy dog,2010-03-03 08:26:00,305,"if walleye are as easily caught as pike, and in canada they are, why would anyone eat pike over walleye? i have been goin north for about 23 years and have never eaten pike, doesn't seem worth the hassle with the y bones and such. plus we like to believe that by throwin all the pike back they will grow and grow"

1173999,Knot Tellin,2010-03-03 09:05:00,386,I like pike it has a very good flavor. It is my mothers in laws favorite. I have had muskie before and it is good. I saw a thing in Field and stream that showed how to clean them. You end up with 3 pcs of meat. 2 from the belly area and one that raps from the y bone over the back to the other set of y bones. Plus the more pike you take out of the system the more eyes there will be.
1174014,Mike Kansas,2010-03-03 09:49:00,1463,None of them compare to a Bald Eagle grilled with some BBQ Sauce on it.

1174279,kgeary,2010-03-03 22:15:00,88,the one about burying them under the rose bush reminds me of when I was a kid. a guy in red lake used to use pike to fertilise his garden. no joke. hey at one time the MNR had a bounty on pike they paid 10 cents a head at the time they were trying to eliminate pike on lake nipigon. can't verify that one but my father told the story.
1174314,5richards,2010-03-04 06:07:00,131,Sorry gents -- you have it all wrong --- don't eat either -- my recipe is to take a 35 inch plus walleye fat with eggs and a similar northern laden with roe --@47 inches combine both and grind them all up --- makes the best carp chum you ever had -- Carp now there's a food fish worth talkin' about!
1186938,Guest,2010-04-07 15:32:00,0,"Muskie tastes the best. especially those 35-40"" range"

1173185,Knot Tellin,2010-03-01 07:18:00,386,"I have a great recipe for all of them and the carp listed by someone else. You take the fish and gut it like you would a brook trout. You stuff it salt, garlic, pepper, onions, and fresh horse manure. But it has to be fresh manure. You put it in the oven at 425F for 45 minutes. When it is done you take it out of the oven and throw the fish away and eat the manure."
1173311,adempsey,2010-03-01 13:27:00,963,"You ever hear of Turducken? Well, it's got NOTHING on Norwalbass. Give'r a go and you won't be disappointed."

1173337,JETSTER,2010-03-01 14:41:00,448,"Usually 1 walleye per person is plenty when we cook them.We flour/egg and cracker-crumb them,it really adds some calorie's/size to the fillet!!!I dont really like the taste of plain fish.That is with side dishes,fish alone ya better make it 2 per person!!!!"
1173342,JETSTER,2010-03-01 14:48:00,448,"By the way,I found around 23 inches that I had some bad tasting ones!!!But also had some bad tasting small ones as well,not sure why."
1173349,Juls,2010-03-01 15:04:00,13414,"Gotta zipper them and get the ""red gunk"" off the fillets to make them taste ""perfect"". That gunk is full of toxins.I don't leave any red on mine. I'm VERY picky, so I do all the cleaning of that icky stuff before cooking.Doesn't matter how big the fish is....gotta get rid of that.One bad bite and I'm done eating, so I make sure to make it all good.Juls"
1173403,Guest,2010-03-01 17:18:00,0,Definitely the Pike or the Northern. The Northern is a bit small though. 48in makes for a real good chowder. I save the blank gunk cut off for the mooches who come out to the cottage. I cook that up for them. They normally don't come back. Bass aren't fish. They're a parasite on Walleyes and trout. We get lots over 5 lbs each year. We don't keep them. I heard they're poisonous and will make you arrogant if you fish for them or eat them.
1173836,walleyeduran,2010-03-02 19:41:00,286,"I would take the belly meat out of the northern, perferable 43 inches plus and put it on a #5ot hook. Cast this towards a rock point and wait for a seagull to take the bait. Be patient when the seagull swoops down on the bait because it will take a few minutes for it to get the hook into a setting position. After you have the seagull landed, put it in a cooler with ice until you can filet the breast out. Once the breast are filet out, cut them into thirds and soak them in butter milk for 5 days. Removing the soaked seagull breast out of the butter milk, rap thick bacon around the breasts and pin with a tooth pick. Place the breast on a BBQ grill at medium heat, turning once after approx. 5 min. Remove the breast, unrap the bacaon, through the seagull breast away and eat the bacon with a beer. Duran"

1172713,Jahloaf,2010-02-27 19:17:00,74,"What tastes better, a 33 inch walleye or a 45 inch northern. Do 5 lb small mouth taste anygood?"
1172716,Juls,2010-02-27 19:22:00,13414,"Definitely the Walleye. Gotta double fillet those big girls though, and remove all the nasty red gunk on the fillets too. Juls"

1172745,kgeary,2010-02-27 21:11:00,88,They are both good especially in combo with Bald Eagle for a nice surf and turf.
1172756,Nimstug,2010-02-27 21:45:00,2605,"Well, if you really want the best, try a shore lunch of Asian Carp on the scenic Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. NimstugNot that I'm being argumentative......"

1173132,Steve of Madison,2010-02-28 20:49:00,230,The original poster was trying to be funny. You can eat pike if you can either fillet them up well enough to avoid the y bones or want to deal with them. I have a recipe where I bake the chunked up filets that is excellent. At our camp 2-3 fillets of walleyes per guy with all the fixins.
