1190594,Hot N Tot,2010-04-17 14:41:00,5,Our group is heading to Demi-Lune the third week of June. We have gone to East Bay(Gouin Reservoir) the last seversl years but decided to try something different this year. We usually troll Hot N Tots...Ripshads...and the like with great success. Just wondering if anyone out there has ever fished Demi-Lune before? If so how was the fishing and wondering if you were able to catch them trolling. If you did what lures worked best for you. Thank you for reading and any help would be appreciated.
