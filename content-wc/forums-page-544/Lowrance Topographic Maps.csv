1190859,PRD1,2010-04-18 11:43:00,458,Lowrance no longer offers the Freeedom Maps for Canada nor MapCreate for Canada. The area we fish (Umfreville Lake on the English River at Caribou Falls) has no detail lake maps on Navionics or other Canada chips. A question for those who use Navionics Canada chips is do they contain topographic information on them for Canada or just the lakes they advertise? I can get the Navionics PRM 08 CA but it is of no use unless it contains at least topographic info for the unlisted lakes. Thanks for any help. Paul
