It looks like it might be close to the size of Winnibigosh.The other question I have is how big do the waves get on Winnipeg? I've heard monstrous.My dad has a 16' Lund Predator and father in-law a 1850 explorer. Would they work on either lake.Thanks,Ed"
1189296,Slim,2010-04-13 17:48:00,102,"Yours boats would work at Tobin, the main lake is fairly large but watch the weather and you will be fine. As far as maps go I have never found one with much detail, if you do let me know. Tobin is by far my favorite lake to fish."
1189303,sheshult,2010-04-13 18:06:00,22,Thanks for the info
1189309,mrwalleye5,2010-04-13 18:29:00,1922,I take it that you are referring to Lake Winnipeg. It can get mean fast. It's a pretty big lake. I have run a 1775 Pro V on it when it was rough enough but you have to be careful. I moved up to a 20 foot boat because I fish the lake alot in the fall. W5
1189319,sheshult,2010-04-13 18:56:00,22,I was talking to a guy on the flw and he said not many locals fish it because it can turn so fast. I figured being so long that northwest wind would be bad...So a Baron would be a better boat. Thanks for the insight.
1189391,Guest,2010-04-13 23:10:00,0,the map u are lookin for is the rural municipality map from early 70's it will show thw land and give u a **** of a good idea were the old roads and such are. p.s. i got one and no u cant have it lol as far as boat sizr i run a 18 ft mr pike 150 yammy and been scared ****less once so take it from there have a good one and let them go to grow
1189605,sheshult,2010-04-14 14:36:00,22,Thanks walleye slut. I'll go looking for one. Pictures are as good as a mount.
1189634,Slim,2010-04-14 16:29:00,102,"Walleye slut, where could I get one of those maps?"
1189642,Bandit,2010-04-14 16:54:00,140,Some Local will fish a beach bite in June / early July right after the wind has calm down from blown towards the beach shoreline? Its easy if you live close by or have a summer camp. Planning to fished in a couple of days would be tuff. We do fish the mouth of the Winnipeg River in fall time if that helps ( Maybe 1 out 7 days not fishable in the Big Lake ) The winnipeg River part would be fishable if need be. I hope this helps you.
