I know it's a walleye/pike lake, which is our primary target, but I'd still like to hit some whitefish if possible; and my brother always likes to panfish midday.Cheers."

But if you want to go for a ride some time, try the weed edges in the back of davys bay and around the small island at the mouth of no fish bay. I have never stopped at those 2 places and not caught fish. For pike we like to fish around 20lb Island and in all the bays south west of there. Another place would be Pine Portage bay. But the would be a long ride. I have only caught 1 whitefish and that was while jigging for walleye. We haven't spent a lot of time perch fishing. But when we do we always fish the inside weed edges where there is a sand bottom between the edges and shore."
1187705,adempsey,2010-04-09 10:58:00,963,"Thanks for the tips Kruger!I had noticed that most of the information I was able to collect were from people staying at Pine Portage, which is one of the reasons I made the post. So far, there are many great spots on the north side of the lake which concerns me a bit since it's a rather large body of water. I typically research my maps and identify potential spots for myself, but I figure it never hurts to ask those who were successful in the past for some suggestions =)I am hoping the weather is cooperative at least one day so I can head up to Alligator Alley/Point, if I do I will hit those spots you mentioned on my way back.Cheers."
1189119,Kruger,2010-04-13 09:52:00,259,"It's a big lake but it's not bad getting around. We fish our way out each morning and then just drive back in the evening. We go from Pine Portage to Alligator Ally at least 3 or 4 times in the week. If you go that far, make sure you go past into Moose Camp bay. We had 4 guys in there one day and in about 2 hours we caught maybe 25 pike between 30 and 35 inches. Not huge or anything but it was fun. They were all so close in size that we were joking that it was the same fish over and over."
1189394,adempsey,2010-04-13 23:49:00,963,Thanks for the tip! I am guessing Moose Camp Bay is the smaller bay with a weedbed in Schist Bay just north of Alligator Point? Didn't see that name on any of my maps.
1189507,Kruger,2010-04-14 09:00:00,259,That's it. Let me know how you liked the lake. We are going a little later this year. The third week in July.
