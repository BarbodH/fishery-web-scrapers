I tried but didn't really like gulp, dries out too quick or gets to mushy after 30 minutes and gets ripped off. I liked the powerbaits and regular rubber baits. The fish couldn't tell the difference. I stated casting rubber swim baits (paddle tails) and had good success. Start in back bay to get your sea legs, than try east bay, lount, heart shaped bay, Jim's Bay. It's not to far of a ride from the lodge. Talk to Lionel."
1177808,PIKE PRO,2010-03-14 08:07:00,28,"Krok, Thanks for the info it will be very helpful. Just wondering what spoons did you use for the pike? Were the pike in the reeds or cabbage? Anyone with more info I'm interested in hearing from you. Thanks again PIKE PRO"
1179026,tilldawg,2010-03-17 11:55:00,55,"I was up there in early June last year and there was very little new weed growth started. The fish were holding on the winblown sides of the bays in 8-10 feet along the old reeds (prior years growth).The pike were in the same areas and bit mepps, typical spoons (5 of diamonds, daredevil etc...), rattle traps and flukes. We even had one hit on an Amazon Ripper topwater. Not many of the guys that were there when we were, were fishing for pike at all. We had it to ourselves for the most part.Like Krok said, talk to Lional and Jim and they can point you in the right direction."
1179028,tilldawg,2010-03-17 11:57:00,55,What and where is Cabin 14? Did not hear that while I was there.
1179206,Guest,2010-03-17 21:16:00,0,"We caught pike where ever the bait fish were. Back bay was packed with baitfish in the weeds. Pike, walleye, and bass were everywhere in this bay. This was the most consistant spot, and we went all over the lake from the lodge to Lount. Keep in mind, it was extremely hot this week. Everyone said on this board to fish the current, but for whatever reason, the more sheltered bays seemed to be the best. The fish probably liked the first warm snap of the year. The guides looked like they were doing the same. My favorite spoon was a weedless firetiger daredevil."
1179738,PIKE PRO,2010-03-19 14:23:00,28,"Tilldawg, Thanks for the reply, was there any size to the pike you caught? Did you get in to any smallmouths? Just wondering how the fishing is in early june? As for cabin 14 we catch some BIG FISH in front of that cabin."
1179897,tilldawg,2010-03-20 06:06:00,55,"Pike Pro - I caught 12 very good pike (36-42"") and we did not fish hard for them. We spent most of our time going after bass and walleye. Like Krok has said - we also caught most fish in the bays. I plan to explore more areas this year for the pike. They have tons of big fish in that lake."
1179901,PIKE PRO,2010-03-20 06:38:00,28,"Tilldawg, When are you going up this year? Just wondering were the bass in the spawn yet? And how was the walleye fishing? Its been a few years since the last time I've fished here. What were your big fish for the week?"
1180232,tilldawg,2010-03-21 07:50:00,55,"Last year (first week of June), the bass had not spawned yet. We caught all of ouyrs on wind blown rocky points and bolders. Caught some real good ones (most were 3-4 lbs).Walleye were in the bays. We caught tons but no real big ones. Our biggest was probably 26"" or so. Most were 18-22"". Some guys in camp caught some monsters (one was 14 lbs), but they would not tell us where or how - imagine that.... We did not fish the rapids area or any of the deep structure.My biggest pike was 42"". Could have caught more big ones but our group wanted to catch a variety of fish. I am going to fish harder for them this trip (June 19-26).From what I hear, last year was not normal there due to the cold weather. The fishing was very good for all three species though. We even caught a muskie by accident..."
1188470,Takman74,2010-04-11 18:40:00,1,Hey There I grew up fishing Separation Lake. You pike/bass fishermen need to visit Fjord Bay. I caught a 37 pound pike in that bay when I was 12 years old. It weighted that on an old Rapala spring scale and was caught before anyone even cared about measuring fish. I hope that it still swims those waters today.... It has been years since I fished there now but we used to get hundreds of fish each and every time we went! good luck this summer. Oh BTW I caught that on a good ol Chart spinner bait! Takman
1166944,PIKE PRO,2010-02-07 14:10:00,28,Been four years since I've fished S.L. Just would like to hear how you guys have done the past four years? I'll be up this june 5th to the 12th. Thanks PIKE PRO
1175360,the bob,2010-03-07 08:11:00,2,"we fished it the last 3 years opening week. Its been the best ontario fishing for northern pike I have had. We catch many 36"" to 40"" fish. The walleye have been good and we catch all sizes. Every year the the weather and water levels have been a challenge but we find fish and new spots and rocks.the Bob"
1175763,PIKE PRO,2010-03-08 15:04:00,28,"Thanks for the reply Bob, Where did you find the pike at that time of year ? I've done well fishing rocks and rock points in early june as weeds are not present. Any help would be great thanks PIKE PRO"
1175858,Guest,2010-03-08 18:55:00,0,"Was up there last year in june. We had the most consistant luck right next to the lodge in back bay. I had the best hour and a half of big pike fishing I've ever had right before we were leaving and right before a storm. They were around 2 feet from shore along with loads of baitfish, walleye, and smallies. The largest was a fat 42 incher. We had hot weather, but we still found fish. Fish closer to shore than you would think for all types of fish."
1176957,PIKE PRO,2010-03-11 13:50:00,28,"Krok, Sounds like a great hour and a half of fishing.I know Back Bay well one of my favorite spots on the lake never had a bad day in there. Just wondering what baits were working for you on the pike,walleyes&smallies. Been a few years since I've fished S.L. just looking for some info to help me out. Thanks PIKE PRO"
1176967,Guest,2010-03-11 14:15:00,0,"A jig and a twistertail work really well, as well as, smaller swimbaits worked well for walleye and Bass. Spoons for Northern. it was HOT when we were there, so live bait was tough to keep alive."
1177046,PIKE PRO,2010-03-11 17:34:00,28,"Krok, Did you use any crankbaits? I've had great luck with rattle style baits. When in june were you there last year? Did you fish EastBay at all? Thats another great spot for the S.L. SLAM! Thanks PIKE PRO"
1177117,FISH-IT,2010-03-11 19:37:00,7,"PIKE PRO talk to LIONEL he is the man that wears the shoes in camp.Try brown bear,barnies,the rapids by the camp ground,400 hole,lount lake,jims bay and dont forget about cabin 14. Good luck and remember no BEERS in the boat."
1177153,Guest,2010-03-11 21:49:00,0,"Cranks did work as well, but we found better success with sented rubber baits. Cheaper to replace. FISH-IT is right. Lionel was probably the best dockhand I have had. Great guy! We went the third week in June and I think we got the only warm week all summer. 80-90 just degrees about each day with little wind. Tough fishing, but we still did pretty well considering. It's a really cool lake. I loved being able to catch smallies. The weeds were the key when we were there. I learned not to fish deep there, 12 feet and under even in the hot, sunny weather. Listen to Lionel, and try different things. I don't thing there was a special presentation that was much better than another. You just need to keep moving until you find find the fish. Give a spot 10 minutes than move on. You'll have a great time."
1177543,PIKE PRO,2010-03-13 09:11:00,28,"Krok, What softbaits did you use gulp or powerbait? Did you fish them on jigs if so what size? I've had luck with mimic minnows & gulp alive minnows on 1\4 jigs. If you have any more info you would like to share that would be great. Thanks PIKE PRO"
