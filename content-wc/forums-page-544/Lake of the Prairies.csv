528921,Soolkyut,2003-03-25 11:33:00,60,I was wondering how good the fishing is on the lake of the prairies Manitoba. my friend wants to go but it is a long drive and I'll have to get time off work.
528922,Stevie B,2003-03-25 12:33:00,157,"Let it go man the Jets are dead;)I haven't been to Lake of the Praries for some time but it was always good fishing every time I was there. The provincial park at the south end is one of the best parks I have tented at. Free firewood, great hiking trails and a nice beach. Maybe someone else here has been there in the not so distant past. I would like to take a drive there this summer.Fish ON!!"
528923,Guest,2003-03-25 21:05:00,0,"The fishing is still good on this lake especially in early spring. Hopefully the natives have not netted all the big ones.Where did you get that logo? Brought a tear to my eye to see it again.Avco Cup, that's when playoff hockey was short and intense and ended shortly after fish opening date.Did you say luxury line?Le pic"

Some day (soon) when the NHL crashes and burns because of the money problems it has, the Jets will return to be part of a new better NHL. You better believe it!I just might try Lake of the Prairies this year if time permits. Haven't fished it before, though."
528924,Soolkyut,2003-03-26 07:42:00,60,"How early, like as soon as the ice melts off or between then and about when? I'm trying to say when does spawning usually end"
528926,Peanut,2003-03-26 10:34:00,929,"I've gone basically every year for the past 4 years - the fishing is generally good to sometimes great. Sometimes you have to find them, and you may not always kill 'em, but we've always caught fish.The reason for the quality is in large part due to the big slot - nothing can be kept between 18"" and 28"" - so you always have a chance at a big fish. As for timing - don't go before May long. I have gone that weekend, and it was maybe a hair early - still caught fish, but....June is a great month, but I have caught fish in every month from May to September. After mid July (give or take) it can green up, but fishing does not seem affected.Be sure to check the Derby schedule - a big one every June - makes things a little hectic on the water and at the launch, and the fish can act a little spooked in the days immediately following.Good luck,derrek.""It's the weaseling out of things that sets us apart from the animals....

528927,Guest,2003-03-26 18:27:00,0,"I agree with Peanut. June is the best month in my experience, when in June depends on ice out, late ice - late June, early ice - early June you get the picture.Sometimes tuff to catch fish outside the slot...Hull moves into the slot, there's the pass from Hedberg, Hull shoots he scores!!! Sorry, must be dreaming again.Le pic"
528928,manitobawalleye,2003-03-26 18:34:00,885,tourney is may 31-june 1have caught lots in august
528929,Stevie B,2003-03-31 09:06:00,157,I have only stayed at the prov. park at the south end. Are there any other good places to stay farther north? I like to tent but a cabin might be a nice change for a weekend.Fish ON!!
528930,Peanut,2003-03-31 12:06:00,929,"You must mean the Prov. Park at Asessippe - it is a nice campground. But, there are a number of other options:For camping there is Pyott's Point (sp?), and at/near the Roblin Bridge, and for cabins, there are the Kilman cabins (which are very nice), and probably a few others.Good luck.derrek.""It's the weaseling out of things that sets us apart from the animals....
