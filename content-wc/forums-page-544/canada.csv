1187576,able,2010-04-09 05:41:00,1,Going to lac soul in august. I was wondering what the best rod and reel would be.
1187603,BenBeattie,2010-04-09 06:51:00,232,Assuming you're targeting walleye... a 6-7 foot spinning rod with medium power and fast action will do the job. Any decent spinning reel loaded with 8lb test mono. This combo will catch all the walleye you want. My personal favourite brands are St. Croix Rods and Shimano reels.
1187865,LIKEWALLEYE,2010-04-09 18:37:00,70,"Second on the st croix rods, with a pflueger straped to it"
1187902,nitroman,2010-04-09 19:56:00,368,Casting 6-7ft St Croix with a ABU Revo SX spooled with 20lb Power Pro Spinning 6-7ft St Croix or Fenwick HMX with a Plueger President spooled with 8lb Trilene XT I use my casting rigs for trolling cranks and pulling spinners also. Get the best you can afford I tried a cheapo bait caster right out of the box and hated it almost gave it up then I bought a revo with a gift certificate I got for xmas and I can't put it down.
1187912,adempsey,2010-04-09 20:04:00,963,"I am assuming you're not a regular angler, so I would just pick up some combo from Cabelas/BPS/Gander Mountain/Sheels whatever big box is near you that has a 6'6"" to 7' medium light or medium action rod with a Shimano Sedona/Sahara, Pflueger President or Daiwa Regal/Exceler spinning reel. Get two if you can afford it (need a backup and always nice to have two options to offer the fish in the boat).However, without providing a price range it's incredibly difficult to make recommendations."
1188029,PIKEMAN330,2010-04-10 08:10:00,101,"Be aware that Gander Mt. does not sell parts for or service their reels.I think cabelas and Basspro are the same.I am speaking of their store brands of course. Good fishing,Pikeman"
1188036,1shooter,2010-04-10 08:48:00,1493,"My favortie for walleye jigging is a 6'3"" St. Croix avid spinning rod with a Shimano reel. I would go with a Sedona, Sahara or if you have a little extra money a Symetre."
1188082,brwhite,2010-04-10 11:32:00,41,"I recently switched out the past few years from the cheapest combo I could find from bass pro shops to a set of St Croix legend tournament walleye paired with shimano symetre or sustain reels. (ie ~30$ to ~500$).If you have the money to spend it will improve your feel for jigging and casting distance/accuracy. Most of the others on my trip do the cheapo combos and the past year I was killing everyone on distant and accuracy casting. However it's not like I'm catching gobs more fish. It's like driving a nice car, a 3000$ car will still get you from point a to point b, but it might break down. A 30,000$ car is going to be a much more enjoyable ride and more reliable.If you use spinning rods and can afford it I would reccomend trying out the symetreI always have 4 rods in the boat:1 trolling combo: medium heavy 1.5-3 oz trolling specific rod and 50 lb power pro moss green with a cabelas lefthand retreive built in line counter. (I use left hand from troll because we use outboard motors and if you're driving you have the correct hand on the rod so you don't have to switch.) I hand make trolling rigs with pline 30lb florocarbon leader1 light casting combo: medium rod 1/8-3/8 oz with shimano sustain with 20 lb power pro moss green (i use super rooster tails for this and other assorted light lures)1 medium casting combo: medium heavy rod 1/4-3/4 oz with shimano sustain with 30 lb power pro moss green (typically use storm swim baits or a lucky craft deep diver or lucky craft rattle trap)1 jig combo: medium xtra fast action 1/8-1/2 oz with shimano symetre and 8lb p-line florocarbon. I like the slip weights and a floating jig or just an 1/8oz jig with a propeller."
