1185230,Enid Elizabeth,2010-04-03 06:43:00,59,"I wonder how this affects walleye spawning? Would like to see one of those widely successful spawns where you see that age class over many years into the future. I have watched this happen as a result of a spawn sometime in the 1980's. Those are the fish, now about 26 inches."
1185301,SoulFulCry,2010-04-03 10:43:00,158,well enid i to have seen the effects of early spawners it is n now has been fantastic for them withthe season closed well in april n closed till late may so that gives them all the time in thw world to spawn n leave there spawning grounds n to move on the best part is that early ice outs means early sp[awners n they are protected like they should be
1185766,Kevin R,2010-04-04 19:35:00,305,Was snow in June 2009 the latest in your records ?
1186135,phishfearme,2010-04-05 17:53:00,1242,it can and has snowed in northern ontario all 12 month a year - i don't live there but in 30 years of doing trips i've seen incredible weather swings - even all four seasons in one day! phish
1186357,Enid Elizabeth,2010-04-06 08:32:00,59,"Yes I have seen snow in July and hail, but not often. I have a wonderful memory of camping outside Longlac beside the Ferno River when I was a kid. It was the July long weekend. I woke up and opened the tent flap to see the world covered in several inches of heavy snow. My dad was standing in the middle of it shaving with steam rising from his tin wash basin. I forget all the sunny days and remember the weather surprisies."
1187925,Guest,2010-04-09 20:28:00,0,Was watching the far shore in front of Golden Hook Camp on Gullrock Lake .Now have open water about 1/4 mile long and a hundred feet wide. Ice is going out early.
1188260,kgeary,2010-04-10 22:29:00,88,I was hauling fuel on Nungesser on the 7th and there was a foot of good ice. But put away the sleigh for this year. All that rain last weekend cut countless fissures It is not candlesticked but something similar. It was below zero on the 7th so no problem with the warm weather since I'm sure it's going fast A few weeks ago I said we'd be going in by boat April 25 I'll stick with that estimate. Anybody want to come up and chase pike?? You'll have the lake to yourselves.
1188295,Guest,2010-04-11 06:56:00,0,"Bay in front of Golden Hook Camp is now 80 % ice free. A new record for the log book. Stoney Bay is wide open, not sure about the rest of Gullrock Lake but plan on putting a boat into the water in the next few days."
1189613,tackleman,2010-04-14 15:15:00,444,"there are large sections of water between the ice flows on South Bay of gullrock today, with this wind and the rain tomorrow that is being called for it won't be long now until the entire bay is ice free"
1191083,Guest,2010-04-19 06:52:00,0,"We flew west down Red Lake yesterday. No ice past Fisher Islands. Still shore to shore in front of Forestry Point, but won't last long. All the lakes west were open. Stopped at a spawning ground and saw no walleye spawning. Imagine they aren't there yet. They haven't caught up with the weather. Landed on Howey Bay at the end of the day and parked at our dock!!! Oh yes, this is a record: landed on floats on Howey Bay, April 18, 2010"
1181526,Enid Elizabeth,2010-03-24 15:12:00,59,Pictures from a trip up Red Lake on March 17th. Snowing today though.
1183563,Enid Elizabeth,2010-03-29 16:22:00,59,attached is the view from my front yard. Time to get the hut off the ice. You don't need a hut unless you are worried about sun burn!
1184347,tackleman,2010-03-31 12:58:00,444,The ice on Gullrock beside my house was 30 inches yesterday
1185040,tackleman,2010-04-02 12:36:00,444,I just went back in my records that we started keeping in 1991 when we moved to Gullrock. the earliest ice out we had was April 21st. This year looks like it will beat that by quite a bit
1185099,Golden Eagle,2010-04-02 15:20:00,2642,"Tackleman, what year did ice break up on April 21?"
1185125,tackleman,2010-04-02 17:25:00,444,the year was 2004
1185136,Moondog,2010-04-02 18:20:00,362,"Tackleman, Was that the year that it was so **** hot in June and the fishing went to ****? I know that it was in 2004 or 5. I remember packing up and leaving. Just can't remember which year. And is Ranger & Ranger Bay closed until June 15th this year or did the date change? Thanks!!!"
1185139,Golden Eagle,2010-04-02 18:26:00,2642,"2004 was a great fishing year. I made it to Little Vermilion for the May 14 week and had outstanding pike fishing May 18, 19 & 20. We boated many, many pike over 40"" and well over 40"". The other days were also good. I made it back to the same lake for the June 10 week and fishing continued to be outstanding as we caught them on the corners of large bays and in shiner spawns. Moving water produced as usual.Made it to the same water for August 7 week and a week that in October that included Thanksgiving dinner with friends. Again we had great fishing. Maybe early ice out means good fishing. I'm getting excited."
1185150,tackleman,2010-04-02 19:13:00,444,"The sanctuaries, including Ranger Bay, creek and lake are all closed until June 15th."
1185229,Enid Elizabeth,2010-04-03 06:39:00,59,"In my mother-in-law's records, a plane landed on Howey Bay on floats on April 20, 1987. In 1959, on April 29, she went by boat to the west end of Red Lake. In 2002, on May 21, we were finally able to park planes at our dock on Howey Bay. Yesterday it poured rain all afternoon and evening. Still raining today. This year could be the earliest break up that we know of."
