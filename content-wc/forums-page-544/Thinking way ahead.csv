1189361,celticbass1,2010-04-13 20:35:00,67,"It's amazing how much many of us think alike, although I have been to Alaska once before fishing for salmon and halibut so I don't really need to spend the entire time there. This trip is going to be all about the adventure, the getting there so I am definately bringing my boat. Even if it is solar and wind powered. I like the suggestions of going up through Canada and back through northern US but fly-fishing is where the thinking alike stops. I have fly-fished a couple of times and I have to tell you I think that is the dumbest way ever invented to catch a fish. I would rather poke my eye out with the fly-rod."
1188796,celticbass1,2010-04-12 15:46:00,67,"I know this one is a stretch but I thought it might provoke some discussion and thought. I will be retiring in 13 years. 2023 here I come. I have decided that I am going to take my truck and boat from Michigan to Alaska, hoping to spend 2-3 months going and returning and I will be fishing all the way there and back. I haven't set the actual route yet but my thought is to go through Michigan in to Ontario, Canada, and proceed to Alaska. I may return by going down to Seattle and coming across the northern US but not near as many lakes so maybe I'll stick to Canada. With all of that in mind, are there any can't miss lakes along the way. I would prefer not to go more than 3 or 4 hours one way off my main travel route. So if any of you are interested in a convoy, May or June of 2023 I'll be headed out."

1188877,Tonyo,2010-04-12 19:18:00,212,"It does sound fun but why not just spend the summer months bouncing from lake to lake in Ontario. I think I could spend 3 months in Ontario and never see the same lake twice. I think I would get a lot more time fishing instead of all of the driving. Not that a trip to Alaska wouldn't be fun, just my thoughts. Tonyo"
1188888,montanacurt,2010-04-12 19:40:00,61,"Fort Peck is in the North Eastern corner of Montana. It is an amazing place-- very remote for the lower 48. 130 miles long, 1500 miles of shoreline and roads are only paved at one location on the lake. You can catch a wide variety of fish-- many of trophy size: walleye, pike, smallmouth, salmon, catfish, lake trout, perch, crappie, paddlefish, etc. I drive 4 1/2 hours to get there from my hometown in Bozeman-- it would be my recommendation."
1188945,celticbass1,2010-04-12 21:31:00,67,"For those watching this post, Alaska is really the goal, not that I wouldn't enjoy 2-3 months in Ontario but I really want to see Alaska, Mount Mckinley, and all of the other sights and the fishing is a huge bonus along the way and while I'm there. P.S. I'm not leaving early in the morning on any day. The whole idea of this trip is going to be relaxing, sightseeing, fishing, and catching a King Salmon the size of a halibut. I'm really not a salmon fisherman but it just seems like a neat thing to try. Only 12 years 364 days to go."
1189022,jigman2003,2010-04-13 06:42:00,15,"celtic - the problem is once you see Alaska you are not going to want to leave. Personally, I'd leave the boat at home. Drive the Transcan (or whatever it's called) to Alaska. Spend a few weeks halibut fishing and salmon fishing. See McKinley (pray for a clear day). Go to Talkeetna and have a few pints in at the West Rib."

Might have to plan 6 months to a year. Then you have should go up to wolleston and the geikie river for grayling."
1189264,JayM5209,2010-04-13 16:23:00,1050,"Celticbass1,Go west across Canada as others have suggested, and fish your heart out. After doing Alaska, come home via the northern U.S. Spend two weeks exploring (and fishing) the islands north of Seattle to Vancouver, then thru Idaho, Montana, drop down to western Wyoming, and then the Dakotas (to get back into the walleye mode). In Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, take your time for some really glorious scenery and fly fishing the rivers and streams for trout. If you haven't done much fly fishing, get a guide for a day or two for an introduction to western waters, flies, and techniques. It will be well worth the outlay! You'll love it, and it will be a pleasant relief from all those weeks and months of sitting in a boat.P.S. During your travels, avoid any chain restaurant whenever humanly possible. Seek out the diners, cafes, mom-and-pop local eateries and micro-brew pubs. It will enrich the experience."
