1186637,LoDo,2010-04-06 19:48:00,721,"I've stayed at several Ear Falls resorts, but found myself with long 45min+ boat rides to find large Walleye. I like to fish McKenzie Bay so I stay in resorts near Rat Bay. Onaway, Lac Seul Lodge and Fishermans Cove are excellent resorts. The boat ride from Rat Bay to McKenzie, assuming same boat and motor, is roughly 20-30mins.I haven't tried the Eastern section of Lac Seul, but would like too. I've heard good stories about the large muskie. I haven't heard of muskie being caught near Rat Bay, McKenzie or Ear Falls."
1189721,davenathe,2010-04-14 20:08:00,113,Has anyone stayed on Lac Seul Resort by Hudson? Would really like to get some detailed information. We have stayed at Mahkwa which is in same area but looking for a change. [email protected]
1186138,CI_Guy,2010-04-05 18:00:00,2118,My son and I are planning a trip to Lac Suel in late June or early July. Would appreciate any recommendations for resorts. Just looking for a clean comfortable place to cook and sleep with decent boats for rent. They all sound good on their web sites so we would like to hear some personal experiences to help decide.
1186150,Noel,2010-04-05 18:28:00,115,"Hey CI-Guy, check out Onaway Lodge. Can't go wrong there. The best camp boats I have ever seen. http://www.onawaylodge.com/ Friendly owners and easy to get to. Might be full but send them an e-mail."
1186162,JDP,2010-04-05 18:56:00,1457,As Noel said Onaway has great equipment and a gorgeous view of the lake.Fisherman's Cove and Evergreen Lodge also would be an excellent choices for you.You could also check out White Wing and Lac Seul Lodge.I stayed at Fisherman's Cove at least 30 weeks over a 15 year period.Below are the links:http://fishermanscoveontario.com/http://www.lacseulwalleye.com/http://www.onawaylodge.com/http://www.whitewingresort.com/index2.htmlhttp://www.duenorth.net/lacseullodge/Let us know what you find!

1186306,BenBeattie,2010-04-06 06:49:00,232,Check out the east end of the lake around Sioux Lookout. www.canadafish.com Lots of walleye and the added bonus of monster muskie!!
1186309,Thumpr50,2010-04-06 07:02:00,139,"My wife & I have stayed at Scout Lake Resort for the last several years, good accommodations, centrally located....I have heard very good things about Onaway, Fisherman's Cove, Evergreen and Lac Seul Lodge as well, don't think you could go wrong with any of these....I know a friend of mine had been talking with Onaway about a month ago regarding openings the first week in August and they had some....good luck & enjoy the beauty of Lac Seul!"
1186343,2746,2010-04-06 08:14:00,3206,JDP has provided an excellent list and any of those would be good. We have stayed at LacSeul Lodge and Onaway and both are very good. Onaway is a Friday to Friday stay vs. Sat. to Sat. if that makes a difference and Lac Seul is a bit less expensive. We have visited Fishermans Cove but did not stay there although it looked very nice as well. Evergreen is close to Ear Falls if going into town is important to you while the other three are probably 20-25 miles away.Could not make a mistake with any of them and Lac Seul is a great body of water to fish. Be sure to bring a GPS......it's a big lake with lots of places to explore!
1186388,stumcfar,2010-04-06 09:50:00,451,"Another one to check out is Golden Eagle Resort near Ear Falls. Good boats, good accomodations and a great price. I am sure you can't go wrong with many of the resorts, but this is one of 3 we have stayed in near Ear Falls and I would rate it the highest of the 3. Good luck."
1186392,skindzier,2010-04-06 09:59:00,137,I'll second Timberlane - this year will be our 4th year there. Wendy & Vance are great!
