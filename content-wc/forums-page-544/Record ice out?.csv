1189355,Obabikon,2010-04-13 20:24:00,2370,Well... I heard the ice was pretty much out on Lake of the Woods. True?
1189359,tackleman,2010-04-13 20:34:00,444,"If you fish the west arm of Eagle Lake you should be familiar with trout hole #1, go past this and keep right, you will go past a formation of big boulders on the left, this is what I've been told is the 3 bears, keep going down the lake toward Buzzard falls and the entrance to Iowa bay is on the right. If you go past the point and into a long bay on the right hand side, you have gone past it. you have to keep rightof the point and go into it 1/4 mile then though a narrows and this is Iowa Bay.Most camp owners will have a map and should be able to point it out to you."
1189522,alanb,2010-04-14 09:36:00,56,"Jared- The MODIS shots for Sunday 4/11 clearly showed the ice was off around Morson, Sabaskong Bay, north through your bay, and north through Miles Bay. The only ice was left on Traverse Bay and north of Big Island. Justin from Mylie's posted on another board that the only ice was west of Morson at the gap. That's the only eyewitness report I've seen thus far. Thunderstorms were predicted over the last few days which should take care of what ice remains. Time to load up and head north, huh? Is anyone up there than can post some pics of open water on Lake of the Woods? Alan"
1189708,Glenman12,2010-04-14 19:53:00,762,"Just got an email from our lodge owner..in the Perrault Falls area the ice went out on Cedar Lake yesterday and today on Perrault Lake..so, and Im assuming here, it should be out on Cliff Lake and maybe even Wabaskang...maybe Peffley can chime in here.."
1189731,djarz929,2010-04-14 20:24:00,40,Glenn - is this a good omen for 2010?
1189733,nitroman,2010-04-14 20:27:00,368,Wow thanks Glenman! Not sure if I should be happy about it or not. Guess i'll find out in about 36 days! I'm still bringing my long johns in case it snows!
1189739,Peffley'sCamp,2010-04-14 20:41:00,37,"Glenman,I haven't spoke to anyone on the watershed since Monday, but as of Monday the ice was away from shore on the south end of Wabaskang. If the ice is out on Perrault then I would guess that the ice is out on Wabaskang now or tomorrow with the exception of the big part of the lake out by us which usually holds on for 1-3 days longer pending temps, winds, rain etc."
1189782,Glenman12,2010-04-15 06:07:00,762,Read post #5 in this thread from VBay Gord cause I asked him the same question..
1189796,v-bay gord,2010-04-15 06:52:00,3168,"After ice rafts drifting around for the past several days, yesterday (April 14th) was officially (from my observation) ice out on Vermilion Bay. This would correspond to reports on ice conditions to lakes further north. This is the closing day for the walleye season up here. Probably a good thing since all reports I've heard is that the fishing has been fantastic.......it's time to give them a break and let them do their thing. The low creek flows are probably going to force the creek spawners to change tactics and become lake spawners."
1190300,rpieske,2010-04-16 14:59:00,1276,"Here is a link to Minnesota's official ""Ice Out"" Status Report:http://www.climate.umn.edu./doc/ice_..._status_10.htm"
1188136,v-bay gord,2010-04-10 15:59:00,3168,"The wind today (April 10) is doing a pretty good job of busting up the ice here in Vermilion Bay, on Eagle Lake. Most likely it will be ice free tomorrow. From records the railroad kept in Vermilion Bay from the 1930's to the 70's, the earliest ice out was on April 18th in 1948. Since then, and more recently, the ice has been out on April 17th. This year? April 11th or 12th are likely. Almost a week earlier than the previous record."
1188188,Glenman12,2010-04-10 18:35:00,762,"Its my understanding they are expecting the same thing on Red Lake...in your opinion, if temps hold to normal and the area actually has a summer unlike last year, what do you think that means for the fishing from the opener and beyond"
1188281,Pooch,2010-04-11 06:06:00,4619,What are water levels like? Was snow amounts normal? Would this have any implications for a dry summer? Just thinking out loud.Pooch
1188290,Outfitter17,2010-04-11 06:48:00,127,"On Manitou Lake, which is South of Eagle - the water is a bit low for spring. We had approx. 75"" less snow than we had last year, so we need some heavy spring rains to bring things back to normal. We will have to just wait and see what mother nature brings."
1188291,v-bay gord,2010-04-11 06:51:00,3168,"Pooch.........I think the snow was probably less than normal, and there is none available now for any run-off. Eagle Lake is pretty low (not sure on other lakes ) so we will have to rely on some rain to bring things up. Glenman.........I am not an expert when it comes to figuring out how a walleye is going to react to changing conditions. I tend to go with the basic patterns that I have observed over the years. For example, on really cold openers we often catch bigger fish but not the usual numbers. While I usually head to the traditional ""spring spots"" I have found that on cold years the fish will often hold in slightly deeper water and are not overly aggressive. At these times you need to slow the presentation down.....such as switching from the usual jig and minnow to using a lindy rig and minnow. On cold springs I have also noticed the periods of activity seem to be more specific and shorter. So, getting back to the spring of 2010, I would expect a pretty active shallow water bite come opening day. I'm planning on using some crank baits to troll shorelines, as well as the usual jig and minnow presentation. I would also say that the weed growth on mud flats should be early, assuming no torential downpours and rising lake levels, which tends to be a hot bite during the latter part of June. Perhaps this will be earlier this year? I found that last year, which was cool and wet, the weed bite was poor and it seemed the walleye moved into deeper water, by-passing the mud flat bite. I think that 2010 will be a more normal year in that regard. The deep water walleye pattern that I have observed over the past few years seems to be consistent in that they seem to be in deeper water, earlier, each year. So far I have not seen any correlation with this trend and any weather patterns.........warm summer vs cool summer. It's a mystery to me, but perhaps it is tied to their food source........ciscos........and their behaviour. Anyways, these are some of my thoughts, hopefully not all cr@p!"
1188303,tackleman,2010-04-11 07:26:00,444,"So Gord, are you saying I'll do well in Iowa Bay on the last weekend of May? Or should I be looking elsewhere for walleye?"
1188318,v-bay gord,2010-04-11 08:07:00,3168,tackleman.......seems like it would be a good choice if you are down in that area. It would be one of the first to warm up.......I know the walleyes traditionally use Iowa Bay in the spring. Let me know how you do!
1189323,sheshult,2010-04-13 18:59:00,22,"I don't know if rainy counts being a border water, but April 10th this year was the earliest on record."
1189335,Glenman12,2010-04-13 19:48:00,762,I went to Rainy on the Canadian side for about 4 years running in the 80's for the opener...the resort was a boat to operation..the year after we stopped going the guys that went up had to stay in a motel for 2 days because the ice wasnt out yet
1189344,old fisherman,2010-04-13 20:04:00,545,I live in Iowa and will spend about 5 weeks in Canada this year. I've never heard of Iowa Bay. Any info you'd care to pass on? Thanks
