As a add include green pepper and just before finished top with schredded cheese, wrap in tortilla for a Walleye Burrito! Keep the recipes coming, really like the wine idea. Any good shore lunch suggestions other than frying?"
1189511,LoDo,2010-04-14 09:08:00,721,"Wrap bacon around of 1 x 1 or 2 x 2 cube/piece of walleye and stick a toothpick through the bacon and walleye to hold. Baking in the over works, but I find it better to use the grill. Use PAM and spray the top of a sheet of tin foil, place bacon wrapped walleye on foil and grill. * Be sure to have an edge on the sides of the tin foil when grilling. Some people like to apply lemon or lime over the bacon wrapped walleye. Absolutely delicious!"
1189673,515,2010-04-14 18:31:00,254,For me it's plain old pan fried walleye in fish crsip with some homefries and beans. Nothing fancy but a taste I crave.

Adjust amounts of ingredients for more fish. Also, the thickness of the sauce can be adjusted by putting in more or less cream and/or simmering longer."

The flour,butter and wine makes a luxurious sauce. Serve with fresh homemade bread to sop up the sauce."
1186912,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2010-04-07 14:04:00,629,"Fresh Walleye fillets from 17"" to 19"" fish.#1. Fillet fish & leave skin & meat intact. Remove belly bones.#2. Lightly rub olive oil into the exposed meat. (other cooking oils are also acceptable) The oils purpose is to help keep the fillet meat from drying out.#3. Lightly rub-in soy sauce into the meat. Just enought to lightly discolor the meat to a light brown.#4. Lightly rub-in lemon juice#5. Lightly sprinkle with your favorite seasoning salt. (Lauwrys, Johnny Docks etc.)#6. Sprinkle ""Lemon Pepper"" over the fillet meat.#7. Bury the fillet with Parmesan Cheese. (Be generous with the cheese)#8. Lay the fillet down directly on the grillls grate, skin side down.(Suggest coating grill grate with Pam or similar to help keep the skin from sticking to the grate.)#9. Need to have a medium hot fire and a grill with a lid. Lay filletsalong the length of the grate, as it will help when removing filletwith a spatula. Cover grill with lid.#10. Cook until cheese turns light brown & back meat starts to split.Normally 10+ minutes on grill.#11. Remove & peal cooked meat from the skin with a fork while on the serving plate."

Last time I made it I just nuked the walleye fillets wrapped in wet paper towels for a minute and a half or less. As soon as the walleye flaked it was perfect. Moondog"
