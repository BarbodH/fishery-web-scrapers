There are lots of above average fish in Onaman. Average fish will tend to run around 20 inches. There are lots of pike in Onaman with some pretty big ones. Onaman is a limited access lake there is a couple of cabins on picnic island. and a outpost cabin. Most of the local resorts have a few boats each in Onaman and you make about a half hour walk in to the boats from the parking area. In June fish the reefs and cabbage beds. Jig and minnow work very good, Shad Raps in perch color #7 also work very good trolled along with gold Husky Jerks. On the east side of the lake is an old trappers shack remnents, about 100 yards off shore along there is a big cabbage bed about 10ft deep you have to search for it by trolling. deep troll along that with jigs and cranks works good. It is a very shallow lake and not many hazards are marked so you have to be careful. I love this lake! Mike."

We drifted shallow spinner rigs (bullet sinker, spinner rig, aberdeen hook and a twister tail or BerkleyGulp! Minnow. We focused on rocky points and the first breakline. I know people that fish the rockpiles on the west side with slip bobbers but that seems too much work for a lake where they will bit plastics and cranks.DC"
