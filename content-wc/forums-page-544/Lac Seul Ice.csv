1190328,brwhite,2010-04-16 16:18:00,41,Looking at the MODIS satellite shot today it looks like the ice is pretty much out of all of lac seul
1190647,Guest,2010-04-17 17:33:00,0,"High winds yesterday blew all the ice to the south side of the bay. The whitecaps worked at it most of the day with slow progress. This morning the ice line was past my dock about even with Whitewings dock. Peter Kay from Kayair worked at it most of the day with a boat and motor. There is very little left as of 6pm. I can still see a large chunk out in the main part of the lake but I expect it to be gone by the end of the weekend. April 17, 2010 will go down as ice out in Goose Bay in my record book. I wish you all the best for the season....Rob at Cherob"
1188426,Guest,2010-04-11 15:59:00,0,"Hi there, The ice is still tight to the shore in our bay. I was on the trapline in a bay just north of the big sand banks on the east side of Mckenzie Bay on Friday and the ice was solid and white as far as I could see. The ice is begining to look black at times and a little wet around the shoreline. We have pictures taken on April 3rd and again today of the area around our dock posted on Facebook at Cherob Resort. Cheers Rob at Cherob"

1188463,Guest,2010-04-11 18:24:00,0,"I don,t know if there are records of Lac Seul ice out. Even though Cheryl and myself have operated a business out of this bay since 1977 I only started keeping my own records in 1995. Since that time the ice has gone four times in the month of April. 1998 April 23 2000 April 26 2005 April 22 2006 April 23 The latest date in that same time period was 1996 May 18th. We have been having stiff frosts at night for a few days,this has slowed it down. We are scheduled to have rain on Wednesday this will help. Once the shoreline opens up, the wind is able to move it around and smash it up against the shore. If the ice is candled when that takes place it will disappear infront of your eyes. My guess would be sometime between the 20th and 24th Rob at Cherob"

1188543,Knoxabilly,2010-04-12 01:00:00,225,Thanks for this info...keep us posted. I'll be up @ Evergreen May 21 and cannot wait!!!
1188845,brwhite,2010-04-12 17:37:00,41,You wouldn't happen to be willing to post the rest of the dates? I've trying to correlate various conditions (including iceout) to where to start fishing on the first day
1189113,Guest,2010-04-13 09:32:00,0,These are the dates that I have collected from Goose bay on the west end of Lac Seul. The actual dates of ice out will be slightly different on different parts of the lake. I remember as a younger man in about 1967 going all the way from Ear Falls and not being able to get into Mckenzie bay because of ice atShantynarrows. 1995 May 7 1996 May 18 1997 May 15 1998 April 23 1999 May 3 2000 April 26 2001 May 2 2002 May 15 2003 May 6 2004 May 7 2005 April 22 2006 April 23 2007 May 1 2008 May 16 2009 May 10 Hope this helps..Cheers..Rob at Cherob
1189163,JDP,2010-04-13 12:01:00,1457,Thanks for the info Rob!
1189862,Guest,2010-04-15 10:34:00,0,This morning the ice in the bay is all broken up and floating around. Depending on the rain that we get today and the wind it will be gone in the next day or two. Rob at Cherob
