1187871,FISH HUNTER,2010-04-09 19:00:00,161,Fishing is a bit slower in july and august but still decent. Trolling spinners with worms along weed edges and also casting cranks will put a few in the boat for ya. If you want any more info feel free to ask and I'll help you out as much as I can. Good luck and enjoy your trip up here. FISH HUNTER

1188813,Tony Shirley,2010-04-12 16:08:00,211,What type of bait do u use mostly with the floating jig heads and particular color work better?
1189893,dubber,2010-04-15 11:46:00,4,i use the phelps floaters with a walking sinker 18 to 24 inches up from the jig. I use a # 8 swivel to keep the walking sinker up that high. Light blue is my favorite color.
1189895,dubber,2010-04-15 11:47:00,4,"sorry, I also use leeches or nightcrawlers on the jig."
