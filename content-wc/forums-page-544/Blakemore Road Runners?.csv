1183915,Steve Ediger,2010-03-30 12:39:00,97,"I have used Road Runners for years to catch walleye. They also work well on crappie, white bass, and smallmouth. Sometimes it seems the flash from the blade really makes a difference on the walleye. Be prepared to tie on jigs because the pike like the flash as well, and at times, you barely feel the ""tick"" and a pike gets your Road Runner.One thing I have noticed over the past several years is a decline in the quality of Road Runners. I nearly always by the bulk heads from BPS or Cabelas. What used to be a package of (25) is now (16). The head size is inconsistent. When I order 1/4 oz heads, one package will be a true 1/4 oz. and the next may be pushing 1/8 oz. The paint color is never the same, one time you order yellow and get green, the next time you order red and get orange. One time the paint will stay on the head, the next time half of it is flaked off in the bag. I also have a problem with the hooks just breaking off right behind the bend. It is also not unusual to pull out a Road Runner and the hook has no point on it. With all this said, I still buy the Road Runners, (probably 100 - 200 / year)but I really wish they would work on improving the quality to the point it meets my expectations.Steve"

1185968,polaris-pete,2010-04-05 10:32:00,343,Well I got my order from Cabelas and found that 95% of the RR's were very good quality.I did get 1 package that had some paint chipping in the box. I emailed Blakemore last week and today got a personal phone call from the Quality Assurrance Dept. He was a great guy to talk to. He explained that these lures have been around for 51 years and at times have a few problems. He said the spinner balde and swivel problem has long been addressed and corrected.He also told me that htese are made in Haiti for the last 25 years and that their plant there sustained damages in the earthquake. He also said that the hooks are very good quality and sharp with no breaking .Got to remember these are 1/4 oz lures and a monster fisf could at anytime bend a hook or two. I have to commend this Company for getting back to me on an email that was sent about the quality problem I got.He was going to check on this paint chipping as soon as we got off the phone. In ending I mentioned I was going to send back the defective ones but he told me that he was going to replace them as this was NOT Cabelas fault. Thank you Blakemore Lures for the personal help on this. Good to know some Companies still listen to their Customers.
1186215,eyemike,2010-04-05 20:35:00,233,Good to hear the positive response that Blakemore gave you Pete. I hope the R.R.s serve you well. Mike
1187304,Steve Ediger,2010-04-08 11:31:00,97,"Polaris-PeteI should probably have complained to Blakemore myself instead of unloading on them in this forum. I must be the only guy that has had a problem with hooks breaking or having no point. I can understand a hook bending or straightening under load but I have problems with them snapping off cleanly under very little load. It is not a high percentage, maybe 1 or 2 per package. I have noticed this problem only with the bronze hooks not the red."
1187524,eyemike,2010-04-08 20:31:00,233,"I personally can not comment on the quality of the Blakemore product itself. I have poured my own since about 1984. I use quality Eagleclaw gold hooks one size larger than the mold asks for. Quality crane swivels.I change up size of the spinner, I am really happy with the results. I end up with a good quality jig, hand painted that catch lots of fish."
1188386,back357,2010-04-11 13:11:00,106,"I have used Road Runners, but was not satisfied with the quality of the last few batches I received from Bass Pro. Went to the Northland Whistler Jig instead. My own personal experience is that the chartreuse whistler in 1/4 oz outfishes pretty much any other jig head in my box. Twist the blade a bit to get a full on propeller action. Tip with minnow, leach, part of a worm, or plastic (depending on what they are eating that day). Not the cheapest jig head out there, but these things really crush them."
1188388,Beagle_Nut,2010-04-11 13:24:00,52,"Has anybody used any of the bigger versions of the roadrunner-type jig? They've got them at Bass Pro up to like an ounce and a half in size with nylon skirts (not sure what they call them), but I was thinking they might be good northern lures."
1182441,polaris-pete,2010-03-26 13:32:00,343,"Just wondering how many of you fishermen have used these Blakemore Road Runners up in Canada? I was talking to a great guy who is a Member here and said they work real good. Any favorite colors, dressed hooks or worms or minnows on them? Never used them before so just thought I would ask anyones opinion before buying them. Thanks in advance. Thanks also to you Eyemike."
1182453,JayM5209,2010-03-26 14:04:00,1050,"I use all kinds of lures for walleyes in NW Ontario - cranks tossed and trolled (lots of Rapalas), Lindy rigs, spinners behind bottom bouncers, slip bobbering, jigs of all sizes, shapes, and colors, etc., etc., etc. However, over more than thirty years I've caught more 'eyes on Road Runners than any other single lure. Yellow or chartreuse with half a crawler. Can have a plastic twister tail or not, plain hook or with the fuzzy add-on. I always have an assortment of sizes. Use light ones on an ultralight rod, 8th or quarter oz. to cast with a longer light action rod, even some 3/8th oz. to back troll or when forward trolling with the bow mount. The small ones with a 1"" piece of crawler are excellent jumbo perch catchers, too.I have not found any significant difference in effectiveness between the Blakemore brand and some other cheaper brand, like Bass Pro's own brand. Someone, maybe it's BPS, calls theirs the Stump Jumper. Never leave home without them!!P.S. Years ago on one of my son's early trips to Canada, we arrived in camp early and were waiting for our cabin to be ready. He took his ultralight with 6 lb. test line and a small RoadRunner down to the dock and proceeded to catch the largest northern he has ever landed."
1182460,Northern Exposure,2010-03-26 14:23:00,29,About 7 years ago I was in the ignace area and someone told me about these type of jigs. I have never seen another jig out fish these. that little bit of flash sets it apart from a regular jig head.
1182572,cspierings,2010-03-26 19:17:00,230,Last time I was on Lac Seul my uncle caught 4 to 5 fish to every two my Dad and I were catching. Finally we noticed he was using the road runner jigs. The creep wouldn't share until we threatened to dump him in the lake. That particular day they worked great for him.
1182600,polaris-pete,2010-03-26 20:27:00,343,Thank you to all that replied. Will be ordering some of these later on tonite either from Cabelas or Bass Pro. Looks like they are the only ones that carry them. The Gander Mountain store here in Buffalo does not carry them either. Seems like everyone has had good luck with them.
1182905,NickIL,2010-03-27 21:34:00,6,"Agree with all the above. I will go to them if the fishing is slow, but your run of the mill jig head is a fraction of the cost and under most conditions (great fly in fishing) the edge isn't all that necessary. Roadrunners are a great crappie lure as well and where bass are used to seeing the typical plastic and spinnerbaits, they can be deadly."
1182962,rebs,2010-03-28 07:42:00,7587,"Pete I have noticed that gander here in buffalo has gone down hill on a lot of their stufff compared to what they had when they first opened. When they first opened I went there a couple times a week, but rarely go now. Dick's sporting goods has become more of a yuppy exercise equipment store and fashion clothes. Galyans was a great store but they were bought out by Dick's sporting goods. I cannot wait til Basspro opens here and wish there was a Cabelas in the works as well"
1182967,Esoxchaser,2010-03-28 08:03:00,1576,"Smallmouth can't help themselves, all roadrunners must be eaten."
1182969,Esoxchaser,2010-03-28 08:08:00,1576,"In the Detroit area we had a Sportsmans Warehouse for under a year. The store was obviously stocked by people who use what they sell, not marketing gurus. I loved the place. Anything I wanted from fly tying supplies to muskie baits was in stock. Unfortunately the people who decided to put the store in it's lousy location are probably the same people who decided to not even give it a year before closing it.I wish we had one of those back around here, I liked it a lot better than BPS or Cabelas, much less Dicks or Gander."
1182970,polaris-pete,2010-03-28 08:13:00,343,Rebs- agree with you 100% on GM and the others. The only time I go there is for something to do! Not much in the store that I don't already have except these RoadRunners.My friend is their Master Gunsmith up there and he has told me some real stories that show the quality and quanities are going down. Tell you more when we meet.
