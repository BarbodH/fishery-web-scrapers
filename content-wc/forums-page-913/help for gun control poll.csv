525810,Guest,2002-12-08 19:35:00,0,They'd market those fish as naturally sun dried organic Canadian Walleye. Charge an extra $2.00 a lb. I don't blame the guy going for a few cold ones. Its hard work pulling those fish in and resetting those nets. He also has to deal with all the Red Necks who don't view him as a human being of equal stature because he happens to be exercising his right to feed his familly. That would get me real thirsty too. Come to think of it I might do the same thing he did....leave a box of fish to rot in plain view just so you could get under the skin of a Red Neck.
525809,Trailerguy,2002-12-09 18:44:00,1407,"Wawajake, I simply replyed to the previous post, by the way this is a walleye site not a gun sight(pun intended), lighten up. You lost the theme several posts back. Funny how you want suport from your USA ""freinds"" until a issue come up you don't like.Tasty, I have no issuse with native gill netters, any more than any other group who wastes the resource. As a matter of fact I purchase whitefish fillets every fall from a RESPONSIBLE netter in Eagle River."
525811,Guest,2002-12-09 19:19:00,0,Well said Tasty........ its NO good for Walleye but just fine for the US to clean house on all the Salmon out west?Typical American double standard........ Do As I Say...Not As I do!!
525812,Guest,2002-12-10 05:16:00,0,I never realized how much hatred there is by Canadians against Americans
525813,bigfish1965,2002-12-10 16:44:00,3210,"Canadians don't hate Americans. I think we like Americans very much. There are some Americans we can do without, for sure. But there are also some Canadians we'd like to disappear to. Posts like the gill net one was stupid. There are tons of Erie walleye..in fact as recently as four years ago it was being tossed about that they may raise limits because there were too many walleye. The present numbers are quite sustainable.I'll bet the poster of that remark never misses taking home his limit either."
525816,Guest,2002-12-10 18:57:00,0,Canadians love Americans. Our paper in Nipigon carried a story that Americans and Canadians are going to share troops in case of Emergencies. Canadian troops could be going to the USA to help in Emergencies commanded by American Officers and the same with American troops in Canada. Its great to get along.
525814,Erie Guy,2002-12-11 14:00:00,6,"Bigfish, don`t know where you got your info from ,but 4 years ago the Ohio DNR lowered the limits to 4 during the spawn and 6 after. I used to come into Canada to fish for eyes. Now there are so many nets right on the boarder it is very hard to get over there. As far as the number of fish in the lake,there are no where near the numbers that there were in the 80`s.I personaly would love to see the netting for walleye stopped all together.Erie Guy"
525815,bigfish1965,2002-12-11 20:41:00,3210,"They lowered it to 6 post spawn? What was it before? The quotas for the netters are set out by an international panel. The numbers of walleye in the 80's were damaging other fisheries. Although we love walleye best, the numbers should not put other species at risk."
525798,Guest,2002-12-07 17:36:00,0,here is a chance for our USA friends to help us Canadians that don't want our gun registry to continue.

These polls are one day only then new topic but what the he!! lets swamp it with NO'sGo to globeandmail.com on front page of site on right hand side is yes no poll. (so far this registry has cost us Canadians over 1 billion dollars.This poll only good Dec 7 and maybe still there on 8th.thanksjake
525799,Guest,2002-12-07 18:09:00,0,Im in...
525800,Mr Twister 1,2002-12-07 18:52:00,5,"Added my NO vote to aid the 61% of 10,000 voters who don't like registration"

525803,Guest,2002-12-08 13:02:00,0,"Thanks you 4 above , the poll is there still today (sunday) if others are interested out of 14,000 votes 60% are against, I know it don't mean much but it makes globe and mail writers think.I am suprised more didn't vote from here considering one of the longest threads ever was gun control topic.jake"
525804,River_eye,2002-12-08 13:18:00,1486,"I don't think it's hit a billion yet, somwhere around 800 and some million right now. But it's projected to hit a billion.Apparently, gun related crimes have not gone down either. They mostly involve handguns which have been controlled for a long time now. I think they should abandon it right now. I don't even own a gun."
525805,Guest,2002-12-08 13:50:00,0,Why should your USA friends help you with gun control? You guys won`t help stop your GIll Netters from killing Lake Erie WALLEYEErie Fisherman
525806,Guest,2002-12-08 16:44:00,0,Almost all the Walleye goes to the States where there is a huge demand. The quota is set by a joint US and Canadian board. Talk to your US representative on the board and tell your neighbours to stop eating those tasty Canadian fish will go a long ways.
525807,Trailerguy,2002-12-08 17:52:00,1407,"It would go a long ways,if some of the consumers ever saw a pickup box full of those gill netted walleyes setting in the sun. Like I have,while the native gillnetter sat in the tavern unwinding from a nights work. They wouldn't be so tasty!"
