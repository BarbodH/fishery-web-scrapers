Regardless our individual opinions on the validity of the laws, we all ought to know exactly what the law says. In that regard only, I provide some pertinent references.In Ontario, it is the ""Liquor Licence Act"" that sets out the laws regarding alcohol. For those interested, actual wording is available at:http://192.75.156.68/DBLaws/Statutes...sh/90l19_e.htmSection 31 deals with unlawful possession or consumption. Section 31 sub para 2 introduces the term ""private place"". This term is defined at para 3 of: http://192.75.156.68/DBLaws/Regs/English/900718_e.htmCompliance with the act is addressed at section 43 of the Liquor Licence Act. The Board designates those persons responsible for enforcing compliance. It is noteworthy that, in Ontario, Conservation Officers have not yet been so designated in areas outside Provincial Parks. On the otherhand, every police officer has powers as if they had been designated (see section 44 para 13).I'm reminded of the saying often espoused by golfers - ""if you're going to play this game, you need to know the rules""."
