If the fishing wasnt so darn good in Minaki, we would look for something more remote.Myself, being on the road alot, the last thing I want to do is spend my vacation in a Hotel type resort. Then you have the problem with the boat traffic and current there. I would hesitate to keep my boat at the docks.Just one mans opinion.<{{}}><"
