By far the toughest I have experienced. While there were a few good weeks, the majority of the season, you really had to work for the fish.So, maybe next spring, I will take a day or two and check it out.I'll be up in early June if anyone wants to go exploring!Tight Lines.<{{}}><"

Nice profit for the current owners if the get what they are asking for the place. It was originally (the last time) listed for 2 million & change US funds of course. This time I think it's safe to assume that it's listed in CDN funds. Still, 2 mill US doesn't equal anywhere near 8 mill CDN. (YET !)Nice aerial picture of the lodge & area on this web siteHowever it is sad to see the Ole Joint for sale ! Good FishenRob http://www.cabinstocastles.net/listings/935.html"

525240,Guest,2002-10-30 12:47:00,0,Maybe they saw all the netting going on this fall!

525242,iamwalleye1,2002-11-05 20:05:00,1589,Wow I am a guest user now!
525243,Guest,2002-11-12 09:19:00,0,"I just got back from Minaki and talked to the Lund dealer in Kenora He told me that a guy from Calgery had bought the Lodge. I don't know how resent, but he told me they had bought all of Totem lodges used boats. I was looking at the boats but he said they were all sold."
525244,roddyw9,2002-12-04 18:30:00,16,"I e-mailed the new owner recently and Minaki Lodge is definately NOT for sale. He said he has put ""a few million"" into getting it in shape for his opening in May and plans on running it, including the golf course. I am looking at giving it a go next summer. Has anyone been there in the last few months - how's it looking?"
