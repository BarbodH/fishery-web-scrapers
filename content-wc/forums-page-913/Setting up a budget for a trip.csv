525709,retire55,2002-12-11 15:17:00,1029,"Mike:Our group of 12 fishing enthusiasts have been fishing together for 30 years plus. Everyone is retired. Until recently, all fishing trips were for trout, particularly speckled trout, but lake trout and rainbow trout as well. Three years ago, I convinced some of them to give walleye fishing a try (something I had done for a few years as a kid in the western basin of Lake Erie). 2004 will bring our 4th walleye trip. Regardless the prey, our number one goal is always to have fun. Glad you enjoyed the 2002 menu - I can tell you that the guys did! Jay"
525696,Guest,2002-12-10 12:42:00,0,"Mike,I'm always looking for new menu items.Are you willing to share that recipe(sp)Do you cook it in advance?"
525701,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-12-10 23:02:00,618,The best thing to do is to get all 6 of you togeather and decide on a basic menu. My last outpost trip came in way over $100 per person for food. The bulk of our costs were in the thick cut delmonicos. Decide on what you want to eat and get a rough idea what it is going to cost. Rich
525702,Guest,2002-12-11 06:09:00,0,"My comment is more to do about the mechanics rather than cost. I have a bank zippered bag about 4x8 inches, flat. Each persons contributes a certain amount and it goes into the bag. Many of the purchases are paid from the bank bag. If one of the guys buys something on his own for the group, he signs the receipt and throws it in the bag-especially if a cash purchase, a credit card slip should have the card holder's name on it. It's just a matter of totaling the individual contributions at the end of the trip and making the appropriate adjustments before making payments at the lodge and when you return home. I found its important to sign and put the receipts in the bag promptly. It's easy to forget that you bought some bait or groceries and you lose the receipt.Just thinking about a Canadian fishing trip lightens the day!"
525697,Guest,2002-12-11 07:37:00,0,"AVS, I assume you want the Jambalya recipe...here goesIngredietsTwo baseball size yellow onionsTwo 14 oz can diced tomatoes1 lb Kelbasa sausage4lbs peeled shrimp6 cups minute rice3 tbsp cayenne pepper1 small bottle Louisana hot sauceDice onions and place them with tomatoes, cayenne pepper and hot sauce in large pot with enough water to cover mixture. Bring to a boil and let simmer until onions are cooked. Slice kelbasa into 1/4 inch slices and place in pot with shrimp. Let cook on simmer for 5 minutes. Bring to boil and add six cups rice...boil for three minutes ,cover and let stand for 5 minutes off of heat....hand out toilet paper and start eating.....You may have to add more water when you put in rice...make sure all rice is covered with water."
525703,Guest,2002-12-11 08:48:00,0,"I setup an excel spread sheet that allows me to enter the amount everyone paid and contributed in either US or Canadian Funds. The Canadian funds section allows me to enter a conversion factor so in the end regardless if people contributed in US or Canadian, bought in US or Canadian the balance is calculated. For some reason we have never come out exactly on the penny but the difference has been minimal and not caused any hassles."
525704,Guest,2002-12-11 09:32:00,0,I keep track of all the expenses on a old Budweiser beer carton and tell the guys how much they owe at the end of the trip. We always come out right on the penny...and I can always make a extra $50 or so off of each of them this way. They dont care because we catch so many fish they are just happy to be with me and my exceptional Guide skills....PS We have a opening next year if anybody has an extra $50.
525705,Guest,2002-12-11 09:38:00,0,"I like your spread sheet idea. I know what its like to not quite be able to reconcile. It's usually a small amount and doesn't cause any problem. Since we don't have a computer on the trip. We do the spreadsheet by hand and we basically stick with US currency and we evenly divide up anything that is left over. If we have left over change in Canadian money, we stop at the Information Center and covert it to US dollars except the bridge toll to the US-that we pay with Canadian money."
525706,Guest,2002-12-11 10:50:00,0,"I've been headed to Ontario for 25 years since my father took us back as kids. We haven't gone for a week in a while, usually only 4-5 days. Our food cost have been between $35-$45 per guy american every year. Thats steak, ham, etc. Breakfast-lunch-dinner.I run the trips...everyone pays $50 to secure a spot by 1/15, so I know what cabins to order, and another $50 by 2/15. I charge the cabins, so the credit card figures the exchange amount, and that's what I charge the guys. It's covered the cabin costs lately 'cus ofthe exchange rates. Usually by the time we roll in May, I have already gotten enough $ to cover the cabins, and part of the food. Guys square up with me on the last day in camp, and than I cover with the lodge any other costs like ice, bait, etc. System works well.I agree, plan out you meals...talk to the guys. We have a meeting in early January to agree on destination, and another 2 weeks before we go to finalize the food they want. If they don't speak up, they get what I think to buy.Never had a problem with quantity or quality."
525707,retire55,2002-12-11 13:46:00,1029,"FYI:Just thought I'd pass along the food menu for our 2002 walleye trip (arrival time 9:30 AM Sat, departure time 8:00 AM the following Sat). I posted earlier that our food costs generally run $100 Cdn per person for a 1 week trip. Like Babamel, I use excel spreadsheets to keep track of costs as well as planning menus and grocery shopping lists with check off columns. One could do this in any number of ways, but I just find excel convenient.SUPPER MEALS SATURDAY Baked Ham Scalloped Pototoes Corn Niblets Green saladSUNDAY BBQ Steaks Baked Potatoes Mixed beans Green saladMONDAY Walleye French Fries Fresh green Beans Green SaladTUESDAY BBQ Pork Chops Boiled Potatoes Corn Niblets ApplesauceWEDNESDAY BBQ Lemon Chicken Boiled potatoes Mixed beans Green SaladTHURSDAY Hamburgers French Fries Vadalja Onions Strubs PicklesFRIDAY Spagetti and meatballs Pasta Parmesan cheese OlivesSix of the seven breakfast meals consist of juice, eggs and bacon or sausage, homefries, toast and coffee. The other breakfast is usually juice, french toast (made with croissants), bacon or sausage, maple syrop and coffee.The fixin's for lunches, soups and sandwichs, are there for anyone who wants a lunch.Daily routine on walleye tripsOut of the sack at 4:30 AM for toast and coffee and into the boats by 5:30 (we're 10 minutes from our walleye fishing areas). Meet back at the cabin for 9:30 breakfast. The rest of the day (until 5:15 PM) is open (cabin cleanup, sleep, sit on the screened porch with your favourite beverage and shoot the breeze, play cards, trout fish, etc). Supper is at 5:15 PM (if you're not there, you miss it). Fish for walleye until 9:30 or 10:00 PM. Clean walleyes, shower up, pour nightcaps and savour the day. Jay"
525708,Guest,2002-12-11 14:12:00,0,"Retire 55, looks like you guys have a great trip and fine food. Do you have any openings???"
525689,Guest,2002-12-03 16:40:00,0,I have 6 guys going on a trip next year.How much would I need to spend per guy for food for 1 week?
525690,Guest,2002-12-03 17:44:00,0,"We go for week with six and eat good for $100 per man. Outpost camp with full breakfast ,sandwich lunchs and supper with veg,potatoes,meat dish + Walleye and dessert. I do most of the cooking and nobody complains ....or they can cook....HA HA"
525691,retire55,2002-12-03 18:20:00,1029,"Mike:Our experience confirms that about $100 Cdn per person (food only) for 6 guys for 1 week is about right. That includes full breakfast (juices, eggs, sausage, homefries, toast and coffee) every morning and complete dinners (e.g. BBQ'd steak, baked potato, vegetables and dessert) every evening. Light lunch optional. If you're going to be in paradise, you might as well eat well too!"
525692,Guest,2002-12-04 08:20:00,0,retire 55.....We agrree...eat like Kings....fish like crazy....Our first night I make a pot of Jambalya with about $50 worth of Shrimp in it...the guys now demand that we do it every year.....six months from 12/7/02 we will be back at Lac Seul knee deep in Heaven.
525693,Guest,2002-12-04 08:52:00,0,"What Mike is not telling you is every time he fixes his Jumbalayawe have races to the outhouse the rest of the night. But it is soooooooooo good it's worth it. If you are each responsible for your own alcohol the 100 bucks a head is easily enough. Mike has a great recipe for cobbler that anyone can make, and you will be the camp hero when you fix it. Have a great trip."
525694,Arkie eye jerker,2002-12-04 09:01:00,228,"Alright, I'll bite. Give me the cobbler recipe.Thanks,"
525695,Guest,2002-12-04 10:19:00,0,"Arkie Eye Jerker, I see that one of the guys that I have the privilege of fishing with every year (Euker) is trying to pass on the recipe for ""Guides Cobbler"". Cant say that I blame him the fellas in our camp eat it every night for dessert and when they get done they praise the cook. The first rule we have in camp is while the Chef is cooking it is the entire camps responsibility to make sure the Chef always has a full drink. I have only had to rattle my ice a couple of times and when I do they respond quickly.....GUIDES COBBLER....Mix five cups of Bisquick mix ,one cup sugar,two eggs and milk until it is a mixture the texture of pancake batter. In a 9x12 deep baking pan put one large can of cherry pie mix and one large can of pineapple chunks (drained) mixed with one cup of sugar. Mix it thourghly and pour it in the pan . Pour the batter mix evenly on top of the cherry/pineapple mix ,sprinkle with sugar and bake for around 40 minutes. Check crust periodically and when crust is at right texture (toothpick comes out clean) let it cool for thirty minutes and serve to fisherman who have just had a supper fit for a King and several adult beverages.COOKING TIME IS DELICATE BECAUSE OUTPOST OVENS ARE NOT REAL ACCURATE___MONITOR CRUST SO IT DOESENT OVERCOOK. Also make sure they do dishs......Filling can of course be adjusted...we do peach cobbler every other night....GOOD LUCK"
525698,Guest,2002-12-04 10:40:00,0,"We have been at it for 5 years now, 6 guys, full breakfast, full supper, and a few lunches, 1 week, $100 PP."
