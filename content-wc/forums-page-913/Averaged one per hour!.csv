Total catch was six 'eyes, that's an average of one per hour.The smallest weighed around one and a half pounds, there were a couple of three pounders and a couple of five pounders aswell. The last one caught was a thirtyincher and would have weighed an honest ten pounds. We missed serveralfish during this sesson, but then this is always the case, isn't it!We were fishing jigs and salties in twenty feet. A white 1/4 oz. bucktail caught three of the six walleye. The other three were caught of a Northland's ""NEW"" glo model ice jigging spoon, tipped with two minnows."
