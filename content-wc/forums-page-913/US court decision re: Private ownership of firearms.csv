The suit originated about assualt weapons and the court decided against assualt weapons and any other firearms.http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmp...a_weapons_dc_1Maybe this will help explain to our neighbors to the north why so many Americans are sensitive about the topic. The decision will surely end up in the US Supreme court, but for now, in the nine states in the 9th Circuit, the law has been interpreted that gun ownership is not a right under the constitution as has been assumed for about 200 years now."
