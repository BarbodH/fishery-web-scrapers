525732,Larry,2002-12-06 07:48:00,357,Fish It We usually stay at the campground but we thought about staying at the lodge this year till we got the new rate sheet from them. It looks like they have raised their rates greatly!
525733,Guest,2002-12-06 16:00:00,0,"the guides aren't worth the tip, you can catch more fish by yourself if you know what your doing. buildings are old, ants running around all over, only thing good about it is the boats and that was a couple years ago."
525734,Guest,2002-12-07 07:07:00,0,"We stayed at the campground and they were very well kept, and we really caught alot of fish, alot of 31 inch walleyes very close to camp. Barb is the manager of the campground, she was very helpful as to where the fish are,. there is alot of current so the fish are big and strong fighters. We met a guide named John who is very inexpensive and will really help you catch fish. We are planning another trip to the campground, can't say enough about the fishing."
525735,DaveIN,2002-12-07 19:54:00,191,PikeladyBarb got married and moved to China with her new husband.Looks like John probably will be the campground manager this next year. Fishing is still great.Food at the lodge is great. We stay at the campground but go to the lodge for supper sometime during the week.
