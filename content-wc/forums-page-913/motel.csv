Two years later our rooms the eve of our trip is still a topic of conversation. One suggestion, there is a hotel in Nakina that also has the only place to eat breakfast."

Or if you are driving hwy 17 as far as WhiteRiver and going North on that Secondary Highway 631 and then west on 11 to nakina turnoff.Either way halfway is probably town of White River, but motel choices there are bad from my experience. I would suggest you drive the extra hour and half instead and get to Marathon or even further towards Nipigon to Terrace bay or Schreiber , these towns have a fair selection of Motels.If you chose Marathon , there is some right on Highway (Best Western for example, and if you drive the 2 miles into town instead you will have some fast food places and a two more locally owned motels and a small mall. Marathon is roughly 4 hrs from Sault, Schreiber and Terrace bay is another 30 or 40 minutes , but Marathon is bigger town.Nipigon has lots of motels but is close to 7 hrs from Sault. I am sure google search on net entering in the three words Nipigon motels Ontario , will give you a few contact numbers there too. jake"

Have tried the following :1. Hornepayne - Hallmark Centre Inn 800-240-4179. Nice, but 210 miles (3 1/2 hrs) from Nakina.2. Geraldton (Highway 11) - Park Bay Motel 807-854-1716. Decent.3. Geraldton (in town) - Silver Nugget Motel. Decent. Note - Geraldton to Nakina 35-40 minutes4. Nakina - Pennock's Shores Motel 807-329-5265. Spartan, but minutes from where float-planes take off.5. Nakina - I'm uncertain if The Bunkhouse is still open. They are still listed on the Nakina webpage. Never stayed there. Hope this helps."
