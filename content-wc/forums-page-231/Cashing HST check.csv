Crossing at IF in a week or so then Pigeon River next month.I've heard that some camps will take them for a deposit on next years trip, but not seen that offered where I stay.Also, crossing usually on a Friday night or Saturday is a problem as I guess most banks would be closed.Pooch"

4889977,martinbns,2016-06-01 15:31:00,1520,Any Bank in Canada is required to cash a federal government cheque up to a certain amount. I think the amount is $1500.

Canadian banks will indeed cash them without a fee but their hours sometimes makes it impossible. have been sending the check (endorsed with ""pay to the order of..."") to outfitters as a partial deposit. just ask your outfitter - I have not had any issues other than they get Canadian dollars from the check and then credit your account with whatever they think is a fair exchange rate (assuming you are paying in US$) which may not be all that fair - but i'd rather see the outfitter get the few extra bucks rather than my US bank which charges both a fee on top of an exchange rate fee. you can always go to outfitters that give you the rebate at the time you pay the bill - MUCH nicer for clients. Pete Johnson out of Pickle Lake did this for us a few years ago as did a number of others. I frankly don't understand why all outfitters don't do this - unless they feel that their ""package"" does not qualifies (or is maybe debatable) for the rebate. phish"

The owner told me he'd love to do that, but his concern was it would be a stale check since it will be just over six months old at that time. I don't know if that's a valid concern or not, but I opted to take it to my local bank as I've done many times before. I've never had any issue depositing the checks into my account, with a fee of course. Lesson learned is I could have mailed it to my outfitter and had him apply it to my bill if I'd acted a little quicker. I thought it was odd that the owner of FC told me no one had ever asked him to do that before. I guessed it would be a fairly common practice."
