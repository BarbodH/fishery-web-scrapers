I assume you pack a cooler full of ice for the flight with your meats to put in fridge on arrival. But surely the ice won't last seven days i assume to pack a few fillets home? Or do most people not take any back home? No issues with the fish during the middle of the trip bc hopefully they will go straight to the skillet!

Which isn't a bad thing. The fishing was AMAZING. We always froze all meat etc and then took it in coolers. That way it thawed as the week went along in the frig.

I would suggest if you want to take some home with you catch them the day before and keep them refrigerated till you get out of camp then on ice the rest of the way home in a good cooler.

Everything was frozen going in and still frozen 6 days later. We actually pulled out most of the dry ice to get what was left to thaw. Just FYI in case you really need a long-term ""frozen"" state."
4892561,jfaisten,2016-06-02 10:44:00,1060,The trips I've been on we froze our fish in the camp freezer and put them in a cooler for the trip home -- filled the cooler with ice and paper to fill any gaps. Only a day and a half drive for us so it worked fine.
