4889057,Redline,2016-06-01 11:31:00,73,Heading up 2 weeks from today and just curious to see where people are catching them. Someone said 2 weeks ago they were 40' deep which seems very odd. I see lake temps are in the low 60s. Thanks!
4894921,Redline,2016-06-03 06:43:00,73,Someone must be fishing the lake?
4895065,deadhead1,2016-06-03 07:15:00,193,Mostly catching in the mouth.
4895089,Redline,2016-06-03 07:17:00,73,Thanks. So. Much.
4895193,deadhead1,2016-06-03 07:37:00,193,"Sorry Redline, I couldn't resist. I don't fish that part of the lake so can't really give you an answer but there has been a lot of rain and wind over past week so bite has been slow, at least in my part of the lake."
4895233,Redline,2016-06-03 07:48:00,73,Its ok. I got a laugh out of it lol. I'm just looking for depths. I have my spots on the lake that I fish. We usually fish around the Deadbroke area.
4895257,deadhead1,2016-06-03 07:53:00,193,a few weeks ago I was catching as deep as 40 ft but had to stop as killing too many. Last evening caught from 24 to 35 but it was slow. Seems to me things are a bit late this year and I don't know why because ice was out normal time. By the tine you get here it should be back to normal.
4895273,Redline,2016-06-03 07:55:00,73,"Every year seems to change, but we always come Father's Day weekend. I usually start around 18' and work deeper to see where they are. Hopefully it's a good year. The last two have been the slowest ever for us, and just happen to be the first two years my nephews came on our trip. They don't believe us that it's a world class lake at this point lol!"
