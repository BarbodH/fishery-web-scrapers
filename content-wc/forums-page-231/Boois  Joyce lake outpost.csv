1967337,zeebee,2013-07-20 14:51:00,1144,"I have not fished it but discussed the option with Jim Booi. Its said to be a good pike lake up to 44"" but an average fly-in walleye lake. The lake gets minimal pressure as I don't think thecamp is utilized much."
1967705,eyemike,2013-07-20 18:36:00,233,"Jim said last week that Joyce Lake has hardly been used this year at all. There was a gentleman at Trout Lake camp named Jeff that was a regular at Boois who was telling me about Joyce Lake and he said fishing is good, cabin rustic. A fisherman's camp."
