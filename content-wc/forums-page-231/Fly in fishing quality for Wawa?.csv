4880457,Mike Borger,2016-05-30 05:57:00,1554,That's cool! Here in Canada we socialize a lot with our beavers.
4880721,wallydave,2016-05-30 07:03:00,2151,"Plenty of outfitters out west! Plenty of reports to search for too. I've got a second trip with Hidden Bay, trying Gage lake this year, it hasn't been fished for a couple of years, hoping for some big pike and plenty of walleyes! A Northern Lights display would be icing on the cake!"
4880793,pjshorthorn,2016-05-30 07:31:00,5654,"Now things are starting to make some sense. When I ran into those Sons of Beavers, they tried to get me to start smoking again...... This year if I see them, I'll just ask them if they want to go out for a rip, Eh? PjShorthorn."
4881593,falconman,2016-05-30 12:24:00,12,"First off, thanks for all the information everyone as shared, its appreciated! As luck would have it, the Nakina area (NW) is within our 15 hour range. With that being said, are there any fly in outfitters that are recommended?"
4881713,acplumber,2016-05-30 12:54:00,80,We went with Leuenbergers the first time. Great outfitter. Went to Percy lake. Now we are going to melchett lake with Arctic watershed outfitters. Have only heard they are top notch aswell.
4882873,stillangling,2016-05-30 20:00:00,149,"A significant factor in the quality of the walleye fishing in the NW as compared to northeastern Ontario is the climate. A quick look at the maps will show you that the climate in Wawa is equivalent to portions of the Hudson Bay coast. It is just too cold over there. Low productivty rates as a result of the climate mean the the fisheries can sustain less pressure. Sure the climate looks pretty good in the area around Lake Nippising but that area is within easy striking distance of the hordes of people who call southern Ontario home. In the NW we are blessed with a good climate, far more water than any other part of the province and relatively small numbers of people."
4883841,falconman,2016-05-31 07:25:00,12,That makes sense to me. You cant argue facts.
4884881,phishfearme,2016-05-31 10:48:00,1242,"these points are right on the money - the point made about the weather I think is a secondary effect - it's **** cold for long periods of time in both areas. get yourself a color road map of northern Ontario - it's on the back of the official Ontario road map - free from 1800 ONTARIO. then draw a outline of where the most blue is - that will be north western Ontario. you have found walleye/pike heaven - large lakes, large rivers and limited access except by air. coming from western PA we used to try to avoid the long drives and as a result headed to north of Sudbury or wawa/white river - we always go to the northwest now - the long drives are soon forgotten and the fishing/wilderness experiences will stay with you forever. phish"
4878689,falconman,2016-05-29 07:59:00,12,"Ok, so first a little history. My family and I went on a drive to then boat in remote lake in the Wawa region back in 2011 and the fishing was not the greatest. Upon returning and sharing my experiences, everyone told me, ""you have to do a fly in"" to really get on the fish, with the thought being that if you can drive to it so can everyone else and the fishing wont be that good. Made sense to me. So now my son and I are ready to head back up North again and do a fly in, with the expectation of catching some fish! (Walleye and Pike) Here's the point of contention. As Im researching and trying to find the ""right place"" Ive been getting feedback from some very nice folks that are telling me, if you ""really"" want to catch fish, you have to go to North West Ontario, advising that North East Ontario as in Wawa and similar areas still aren't that great, even on a fly in. The issue is that Im trying to stay within a 12 hour to 15 hour max drive from the Akron Ohio area. So hearing that NE Ontario fly in fishing is ""still"" not going to be great is a little disappointing, so Im hoping Im wrong and someone can tell me there is some great fly in fishing in the NE Ontario area and can recommend the right place! There is a lot of respected experience on this site, any input is appreciated."
4878913,acplumber,2016-05-29 09:52:00,80,"I've been on 2 flyinsThe first was out of nakinaCaught fish nonstop, seen lotsa wildlife, the cabin was ok, boats worked top notch, outfitter was great. Second was out of wawaFishing was ok, could of been that the ice just came off 2 days before we got there but it was just okDidn't see any wildlife, cabin was probably the nicest any of us had been in, boat motors were awful, had one boat that went through 4 bad ones until we had a good one, outfitter was a joke, he didn't book us a plane and we sat the whole first day in a hotel and didn't get into camp until 4pm the next dayThis year we are going back to nakina"
4879193,10lbeye,2016-05-29 13:01:00,61,I think this site will answer your questions re the quality of fly in lakes in the Wawa/Chapleau region: http://www.canadafishingguide.net/. It was on the basis of Mike Borger's reports that we booked with Air Dale and an upcoming fly in to John's Lake. Air dale has quite a few lakes to choose from. Here is their website: http://outpostcamps.tumblr.com/ Hope this helps and I'm sure Mike can chime in w/ more information.
4879257,Mike Borger,2016-05-29 13:16:00,1554,"Thanks for the plug. Yes I have fished many fly in lakes in the Wawa,, White River, Chapleau region.Here's my take on that region compared to NW Ontario. The lakes in NE Ontario, especially the single cabin outposts, are universally smaller compared to NW Ontario lakes. For someone who has never done a fly in trip before a trip ANY outpost in NE Ontario will likely be the best fishing trip of your life.However in general the fishing does not compare to NW Ontario fly in lakes. That's a fact.On the other hand the price is also on average several hundred dollars cheaper so it kind of balances things out.I like flying in that region for one reason - it's a reasonable drive from my home in southern Ontario and I can shoot up for a short 4 night trip and catch a ton of fish. That's enough for me on those smaller lakes. Any longer and I'm getting bored.Can't do a similar short trip to points further north...If anyone want any direct feedback or recommendations, call me! If it's a lake I've already fished myself I'd be glad to shorten your learning curve with some spots.Also might be able to procure a discount for you as I have a pretty good relationship with all of the outfitters. No guarantee, but it's definitely possible."
4879521,BuckeyeBill,2016-05-29 16:49:00,76,"As a fellow Buckeye, I make the trip every year to North West Ontario. We tow our own boat and fish a drive to lake. There really is no comparison to fishing Eastern Ontario. We fished at a lodge just east of Saulte Ste Marie for years, consider the owner's as good friends, but the fishing just doesn't come close to what we experience now. Long, long trip but well worth it!!"
4880025,forgop,2016-05-29 21:36:00,880,I've gone on 3 trips out of Wawa/Chapleau and had 1 good day of walleye fishing combined. I'm going west this year. Sent from my SM-G935T using Tapatalk
4880057,Mike Borger,2016-05-29 21:48:00,1554,No excuses this year Duane. I'd really like to fish Dave Lake myself to see what its like.
4880105,forgop,2016-05-29 22:09:00,880,"The group after me didn't exactly set it on fire either. They had better numbers, but then again, 2 boats and more experienced fisherman than I. I wouldn't have had that one good day if I didn't channel the walleye whisperer to get me on the hump on the portage lake. Sent from my SM-G935T using Tapatalk"
4880289,Mike Borger,2016-05-30 03:56:00,1554,"For the love of God, please don't message me this year from Maskara looking for help."
4880297,pjshorthorn,2016-05-30 04:18:00,5654,"Would you mind if I message you from Vermilion Bay Lodge for a little help ? Gord can be a little "" crusty"" at times on giving accurate information... I mean heck, I ended up in a parking lot full of beavers trying to catch perch last year.PjShorthorn"
