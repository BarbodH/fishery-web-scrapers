4883881,MikeG1,2016-05-31 07:38:00,434,I'm reading about the controversy with having more than 120 minnows per person when crossing into Canada. Is there a limit on worms?? I'm aware of needing paper bedding for the worms. Anything else I need to know.
4883937,tv4fish,2016-05-31 07:44:00,2694,"By ""worms"" are you talking about nightcrawlers??? Regardless - I don't believe there is a limit on either nightcrawlers OR worms. Just make sure they are NOT in dirt."
