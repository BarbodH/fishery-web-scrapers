We cross border at Pembina/Emerson on MB 75. We take Perimeter Hwy east and north around Winnipeg, then MB 59 to 304 to Powerview-Pinefalls. Its time to start prepping for this years trip in earnest. Thanks for any information and safe travels and good fishing to all."

They were both gas stations that also sell bait and tackle. I did a quick search and I'd bet that one of the two is called Clark's Corner (204-367-2238). It's right on the main intersection where you either turn west to go into town or go north toward Manigotagan. I'd call them and ask if they have leaches or if not, who does."
