I didn't want to hijack the thread, so thought that I would start this thread. I tied a bunch of spinner harnesses this winter, having had promising success with them in Canada last summer. Not knowing what length to make the snell on the harness, I made them all about 6-7 feet in length, figuring that I could shorten them as needed. They worked well last week, but I learned that their length made it quite difficult to net fish. I plan to shorten the spinner harnesses before my next trip. In general, what length do you like your spinner harnesses to be when running bottom bouncers? Is there a specific targeted length for slow death rigs that gives optimal performance? Many thanks. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

4891121,3M TA3,2016-06-01 20:35:00,2846,Sounds about right for me too.
4891393,Mike Borger,2016-06-02 03:30:00,1554,Typically my harnesses are between 3 to 4 feet long. Slow death rig probably 4'.
4891897,adempsey,2016-06-02 07:28:00,963,"My harnesses are 18"" to 48"" for inland lakes. The majority are 24""-34"". Slow death, 2' to 3' with a good bearing swivel."
4895633,Lmbkiller,2016-06-03 09:48:00,639,Good barrel swivel and 6-7ft length. I leave nothing to chance when it comes to stealth fishing
