Second day, my Mercury 150 started doing the dreadful beeping. Of course the local mechanic was too busy to look at my motor for several days so there was no way to know if I had a real issue or bad sensor. I did determine it was the oil sensor and I checked to see that both my big reservoir and the small reservoir inside the motor were full of oil, not leaking and had tight connections. Needless to say I was not willing to run around on the outside chance I had a real issue and the beeping just annoys you to no end so I ran the kicker and trolling motor and got to know a small area of the lake very well!!!! It did not ""end"" my trip but, it sure did limit my fishing water and experience. My question is what checklist do you follow to get your boat ready to go to Canada and when you have had mechanical issues what went wrong with your boat? Was it something you could have anticipated thru regular maintenance and review ????? Did the issue ruin your trip or did resolve while still in canada????? P.S. - WHEN I GOT HOME AND THEY HOOKED UP THE DIAGNOSTICS WE CONFIRMED IT WAS JUST A BAD SENSOR, MOTOR WAS FINE."

4882777,pwbmlr,2016-05-30 19:31:00,37,I would assume the OP asked this in the Canada section because most of us drive very long distance to fish in Canada. If you have motor issues on day 1 or 2 of your 7 day trip what would you do.

I always give my rig a good ""run through"" prior to our Canada trip. Take it out and run it for a good solid hour. And, Yes, I have had engine problems in Canada and was ""at the mercy"" of a repair shop. What are ya' gonna do? Stator went out - luckily - I have a kicker motor that got us back (SLOWLY, of course). Didn't ruin the trip but sure put a damper on it. 30 plus years of going to Canada -- just another one of ""life's experiences"". My group will continue to go and just hope for ""good luck""."

I don't recall all of the details, but I think that he started the motor in the driveway and was running the steering wheel to check things out. He found that his steering had locked up. This was the day before the trip. He called his local dealer and they were able to get him in to replace the steering cable. While he was there, the mechanic happened to notice two big bulges on different tires on the inside of the tires. As a result of that notice, he replaced all 5 tires on his trailer, including the spare before getting home at 10 pm after the service work was done. He was on the road the next morning at 6 am, where he hooked up with us and we carried on. He had a perfect week with 0 troubles on either the road or on the water with the boat. It ""Just happened"" to get the problems noticed and resolved before leaving. It took a big bite out of his wallet, but it took nothing out of the trip or its enjoyment. Be safe"
