The lake just shows up as a blue blob on your Navionics screen and most islands are not shown even crudely. Depending where you fish you can get some old paper maps (and laminate them) which show contours, although out of date. But at least you will know where the shoals/reefs are and general depths as you are motoring in those areas."
