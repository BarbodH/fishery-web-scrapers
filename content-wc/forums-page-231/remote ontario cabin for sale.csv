4882481,Guest,2016-05-30 18:13:00,0,"I have a friend that has a father in law(US citizen) with a cabin that was given to him back in the 50's , the cabin is in Ontario. He is at the age and has health issues so that he can no longer take care of the place and is considering selling it this summer. What are the tax implications of selling the cabin to another US citizen ? Are there creative ways around this ? Could the cabin be willed or given to someone ? The place is in bad shape and is not worth much but his father in law needs the money to support him and his wife due to health issues."

In Canada you only pay tax on 50% of the gain so he would have to file income tax in Canada and pay tax on his $10,000. We have a tax reciprocity agreement with the US, so it wouldn't be too bad. Only way around it would be to put it into a Family Trust which would cost him several thousand dollars to set up and maintain annually. Huge issue for cottage owners in popular areas, like Lake of the Woods, Muskokas or the Kawarthas. Many families can't afford the tax so the cottages have to be sold. Gifting it creates what is termed a deemed sale with the same consequences above."
4884473,ftfarms,2016-05-31 09:15:00,444,Can you tell us what lake it is on.
4884689,strength22,2016-05-31 09:57:00,49,Location of the cabin? I am sure there would be interest in the cabin to buy from people on here depending on the price.
4884745,tv4fish,2016-05-31 10:22:00,2694,"Martin: By ""the tax"" -- do you mean the Real Estate tax? If so - how are cottages valued up there? Estimated market value?? Comparable sales? front footage on a body of water?? Just curious....."
4884929,ftfarms,2016-05-31 10:56:00,444,I'm sure he's talking a gift tax or inherentanc tax or capital gains tax. I have friends that own a house in ontario and the real estate tax is fairly cheap.
4884969,REW,2016-05-31 11:04:00,40083,"Just be aware. Owning a remote cabin on a remote lake in another country can mean some pretty big $$$$$ and expenses and effort to keep up and own over the years. If it is in your ""wheel house"" so to speak, go for it. But, just be aware of the potential costs and efforts to keep up such a place in its location. Make sure that you are handy with construction, plumbing, electrical, etc. etc. No one else out in the remote areas to help. Be safe"
4885049,tv4fish,2016-05-31 11:18:00,2694,"Roger: I have to chuckle a little at your response. For years we lived in the Metro area and had a cabin ""up north"" in MN. I can assure you that what you said applies to a cabin in MN. as well as one in Canada. The work, expenses, time involvement is pretty similar - just the distance to travel to a cabin in Canada is just a little longer. I'm sure that there are ""others"" on this Board that understand..........."

Capital Gains are simply how much the property which could be a cottage, a rental property or shares of XYZ company went up in value from the time purchased. In Canada, all property is subject to capital gains except someone's principal residence and some small business equity. Valuations are pretty easy, most know what they paid, if they didn't make dramatic improvements, that's the base for valuation purposes. An opinion from a qualified realtor or appraiser will suffice to establish current value. Whatever the difference from acquisition cost and sale or deemed disposition value is a gain and 50% of it is taxable in a person's top marginal tax rate. Deemed disposition happens of the person dies or gifts the property, a valuation must still be done and the seller must declare the gain and pay the tax whether it's the seller or estate of."
