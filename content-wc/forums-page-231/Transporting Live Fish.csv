4889193,TrumanBurbank,2016-06-01 12:07:00,27,"The 2 CO's we talked to, said different things. One said any water in the livewell was bad. The other said it would have been fine, had there not been any fish in it. The lake we were fishing on was about 15 miles from our camp.We had the livewell full with water and live fish we were going to eat."
4889777,prov1800,2016-06-01 14:36:00,5010,Called co supervisor in dryden.he said to pull plug from livewells.they dont want to take chances with invasive species coming from one lake to the next.i can see there point with all all the crap thats ending up in our lakes.
4890633,uv2021,2016-06-01 18:32:00,48,"I read an article once by an outdoor writer/chef who said that when fish are stressed,stringer,live well ect they build lactic acid in the flesh which can affect the taste. The best way to deal with eaters is to catch them and snap their necks back so you kill them quick. Then put them on ice,in a bag that separates the flesh from coming into direct contact with the ice. This is what i always do."
4891137,Rock Lobstar1,2016-06-01 20:45:00,134,"If they really want to enforce draining livewells then they need to change ""SHOULD be drained"" to ""MUST be drained"". Otherwise it's just a suggestion. It's all about the wording. I agree that they should be drained though for the invasive species reasons already mentioned."
4891465,gaspumper,2016-06-02 05:12:00,73,"Another thing you can do is take a knife and slit the throat of the fish then snap the head back,makes the meat whiter when cleaned you dont get the blood all through the meat."

4888321,TrumanBurbank,2016-06-01 07:58:00,27,Just got back from a short trip to Ignace area. CO's were fining people for transporting live fish in the livewell back to camp. Multiple camps were reporting the same. Just a heads up.
4888401,Fishoil,2016-06-01 08:11:00,1277,"What do you mean by transporting, in a livewell with the boat on the trailer going down the road or in a livewell on the water?"
4888553,retire55,2016-06-01 08:54:00,1029,"After reading the original post, I perused the Ontario Fishing Regulations in an attempt to ascertain why the Conservation Officers were fining fishermen for transporting live fish in a live well back to camp. I was unable to find anything concrete. Consequently, I telephoned the Ontario MNR and asked. Response: Live fish may not be transported overland without a permit. What do you mean overland I responded. According to the MNR representative I spoke with, any transportation of live fish over land (e.g. from the livewell in the boat at the dock to the cabin) contravenes the regulations and warrants a fine."
4888561,TrumanBurbank,2016-06-01 08:55:00,27,On the trailer going down the road. We talked to 2 CO's about this and got different answers on what was acceptable. One said if you just drain the livewell you are fine. The other said that he doesn't want to see the fish moving at all.
4888681,tv4fish,2016-06-01 09:45:00,2694,"To me - THAT is getting a little ""picky"" -- Now if you're fishing a lake like Lac Seul - where you can't have any live fish in the boat - I understand. But, on other lakes where you CAN use your live well - if you catch a nice one early in the a.m. and you want to keep it relatively ""fresh"" in your live well until late in the day ????????? So, I suppose the solution is to whack every one in the head before you even set foot on a dock???? Are these CO ""stationed"" at the docks and checking people as they walk up to their cabins/fish cleaning house????"
4888809,prov1800,2016-06-01 10:38:00,5010,Seems i have been breaking the law for a lot of years then.i always (except for LS) bring my fish home alive and clean them there.have never been pulled over in many years of doing this.wish i hadnt read this post.going to be worried now.lol.mind you when the water surface temp rises i prefer to kill them and put them on ice.definatly is better for the meat as they stay firmer rather than getting mushy.but then i always have to make sure i freeze milk jugs as i dont buy ice.
4888825,TrumanBurbank,2016-06-01 10:43:00,27,It was standard practice for our group to keep the fish in the livewell driving back to camp. The CO's were going from camp to camp handing out $240 fines.Just hoping I can save someone else the expense.
4888873,CI_Guy,2016-06-01 10:59:00,2118,Is it legal to have water in your livewell when driving on the road in Ontario. I know it is illegal in MN and WI to have any water in your livewell during transport and in MN it is also illegal to transport live fish.
4888985,big popi,2016-06-01 11:20:00,635,"Truman, When the CO issued the ticket, was the livewell drained? I just looked up in the Ontario 2016 fishing regs and this is what it states: Livewell Â– A livewell is a compartment designed to keep fish alive. For a livewell to be used to selectively release Bass, Walleye and Northern Pike, it must be attached to or form part of a boat, hold a total volume of not less than 46 litres (10 gallons) of water, have the capacity for water exchange and be mechanically aerated at all times when live fish are being held in it (see Ontario's Catch and Retain Rules, page 9). Remember, live fish may not be transported overland without a permit. Livewells should be drained before leaving a waterbody. I want to make sure I am not doing anything I could get fined for. I will pull the plug on the livewell & drain before we go back the resort. Brian"
4889137,Skywagon,2016-06-01 11:54:00,1106,"I can see the concerns the MNR has about transporting live fish for any real measureable distance from the lake and support it being illegal. Inconvenient for some? maybe, but the potential of moving live fish from one body of water to another is too great, a dead fish poses less risk. As an example: somehow crappie have gotten into several lakes around the area, the guess is they were brought in from other lakes to the south by some individual/individuals playing God, the local fish biologist said the MNR did not plant them. There are other lakes smallmouth bass were planted by other than the MNR, in my opinion not a good thing either, certainly not legal. Another possibility is if even the same species was moved to another lake it could potentially be bringing with it some disease or parasite the native fish population might not be tolerant of. Most people would never do this, but as life goes, there are always a few rotten apples to spoil it for everyone else and we all pay the price."
