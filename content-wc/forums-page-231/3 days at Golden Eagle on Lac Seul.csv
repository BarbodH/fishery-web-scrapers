Our average size was up this year, with not many of the 12""-15"" variety, but we did poorly on large fish. Mouth of the Wenesaga was okay but did most of our fishing around the entrance and into Saw Mill. Caught a few smallmouth, way too many northerns and one blue walleye and one burbot at the mouth of the river. Clint and Marie are making a lot of improvements at Golden Eagle, including 3 new '18 foot boats and 40 HP 4 stroke Yamahas, which we were lucky enough to use this year. These trips go by way to fast, so enjoy your time up on the lake!"
