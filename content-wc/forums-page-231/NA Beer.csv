If not, there is a whole gaggle of guys who are willing to fill that quota. Thanks for the knowledge."
4866633,Pikeslayer8,2016-05-24 09:10:00,1460,No duty.
4866729,Fishoil,2016-05-24 09:27:00,1277,"One of our group had some along one year and they counted it, so I suspect it's somewhat discretionary to the border guards. We've also had several other times when we were over on alcohol and weren't charged duty. I'd take what you want, declare it all, pay whatever duty they want, and go fishing."
4867633,bigdaddyguns,2016-05-24 14:48:00,608,Most if not all NA beer is actually low alcohol beer with alcohol by volume (ABV) between 0.3%-0.7%. The Canadian government sets the alcohol threshold above 0.5% ABV for imported beverages according to:http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel-vo...rpcrc-eng.html By the letter of the law beverages with ABV 0.5% or less are not considered alcohol so no duty or restrictions should apply. However as fishoil pointed out some border guards may have a different interpretation...
4890825,walleyeduran,2016-06-01 19:12:00,286,Bigdaddyguns in correct. 0.5% or less has no duty on it. Bring as much as your bladder can handle. lol
4891065,martinbns,2016-06-01 20:29:00,1520,Plenty of NA beer for sale in stores in Canada. Hard to imagine you couldn't purchase it here if you were worried about the border and charges.
