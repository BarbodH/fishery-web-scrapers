We have found the smallmouth fishing to be excellent so about half the trip will be that. I have several high end bait casting rods so smallie, pike and bottom bouncing will be covered with those. I would like some feedback on my walleye setups please.6' St croix triumph ML F pared with 25 series president limited edition spooled w #15 seagur smackdown braid. Vertical jigging rod?7' BPS walleye series M F paired w 30 series president reel spooled w #8 xl mono. Lindy and slip bobber?6'6"" BPS carbonlite ML F paired w 30 series president reel spooled w #20 seagur SmackDown braid. Jig pitching rod?Leader question. I can tie a good double uni in good light w no wind!! Not so much at night in a boat . The #15 low via green SmackDown has a smaller diameter than #4 mono so I'm thinking no leader. Thoughts?"

Also, might consider the presence of a medium action spinning rod as well as the medium light for the times when using heavier jigs or baits. I used to carry light and medium light rods on my Canadian trips but after a couple of trips, I went down to a single medium light and added a couple of medium action rods. Be safe"
4886449,BornToFish,2016-05-31 17:51:00,1224,"I had a couple of thoughts come to mind when I read your post. First, I noticed that your walleye setups are based on ML and Medium power rods. If you were to change anything, you might consider bringing a Light power rod. All of my walleye fishing is with a Light power St. Croix spinning rod, a 1000 series Shimano reel and six pound test line. The second thought is with regard to your leader. I'm assuming that your question is in the context of walleyes. A leader is not necessary, but sort of is, at least for me. I always have a small SPRO swivel (35 pound rating) at the end of my main fishing line. From this, I run an 18 inch dropper made with six pound fluorocarbon to the jig. The swivel goes a LONG ways in reducing line twist. Jigs go upwards as a corkscrew, but fall straight down. I encounter massive line twist when I don't use an inline swivel. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
