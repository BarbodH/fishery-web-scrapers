4892809,tv4fish,2016-06-02 12:15:00,2694,"Maybe not. We live on Lake Mille Lacs and we DO get ""fish flies"" here. They are like a large mosquito - they don't bite - they are just a nuisance. There is a distinct difference between our fish flies and a mayfly - the mayfly has much larger wings and they have a ""forked"" and much longer tail.NOW - I do believe that the Canadians refer to the mayfly as a ""fish fly""."
4893249,adempsey,2016-06-02 14:20:00,963,"Yes, we used to call them Fish Flies when I was a kid."
4893345,kzoofisher,2016-06-02 15:00:00,5144,"Quite a variety of mayflies but in Michigan the big one that changes the behavior of all the fish is the Hexagenia Limbata, a.ka. Hex, Fish Fly, Giant Mayfly, Michigan Caddis. The last mayfly hatch I experienced in Canada was lake wide and the shucks covered the shoreline but the bugs were much smaller than Hex, maybe half an inch instead of an inch or more plus tails. Some of our prime trout water will be starting the hatch in the next week or so and the trout equivalent of 10# walleye will get caught by many people. I'll be out there trying."
4893385,tv4fish,2016-06-02 15:14:00,2694,"Through the years, we have also hit some HEAVY mayfly hatches on Lac Seul. If the water is calm - it's like you're driving through a layer of scum (shucks) on the lake. And, yeah - our experience is the bite is ""on"" when they first start - after a day or 2, the fishing (OK - the catching) does slow......"
4893441,trapsht,2016-06-02 15:36:00,28,"I've had many fishing trips when the hatch was going on, and the best bite for me has always been to drag a jig with a 1/3 of a crawler."
4894153,Terwalleye,2016-06-02 19:34:00,166,Find the bays with soft muddy bottom and fish where their hatching. We use leeches a lot and they seem to work just fine compared to a wriggling mayfly larvae
4894209,ftfarms,2016-06-02 20:14:00,444,"We used to find the bay the wind is blowing in and find the sparse weeds and cast a 1/16 or 1/8 oz jig with a 2"" white tail and reel it in like a buzz bait. It can be awsome."
4890537,jkaup,2016-06-01 18:17:00,56,"So, last time we were in the great white north the mayflies hatched on the second day and the fishing slowed to a crawl. We were catching them on jig and minnow but as soon as we started to see the flies surfacing the bite nearly stopped. We tried some crankbaits to no avail. I wonder with the early ice out and lower water levels if we might see an early hatch this year? What advice do you have when the hatch is on? Favorite bait or style of presentation???"
4890961,alberta bum,2016-06-01 20:00:00,312,"I've never fished northern Ontario when the ""mayfly"" hatch was going on.. I've fished Erie a lot when the ""fish fly"" hatch is in full swing... I'm pretty sure we're talking the same bug.. I've always used all gold worm harness,, either on a bottom bouncer, inline weights or casting them with an egg sinker and reeling them back in from just under surface all the way down to the bottom.. Also have had good luck using old style hot n tots in craw dad colour, if you can find them."
4891033,Bluebomber,2016-06-01 20:18:00,29,"It's been my experience that the fish actually go on a feeding binge during a mayfly hatch. The thing is where you were catching them one day as they were feeding on minnows or whatever will be void of fish. They have all schooled up where the hatch is happening. When you find them they are usually aggressive unless it's dead calm typical ""tough"" walleye days. Then I go with brown/orange jig with half a crawler seems to out produce all others when the bite is tough."
4891081,h8go4s,2016-06-01 20:30:00,1673,+1 Make that a brown/orange maribou jig for me.
4891609,octanehi5,2016-06-02 05:56:00,1104,"In the fare north the water temps are to cold for a mayfly hatch,being a late ice out the hatch will most likely happen the last week in june or first week in july. I also find the walleyes go into a feeding frenzy during the hatch,Cleaning Walleyes that have both Larve and mayflies in them.Walleyes being opportunistic feeders, in an area were bait is near, will hit a lot of differant types of baits"
4891857,strength22,2016-06-02 07:20:00,49,I fly fish as well so I always bring my fly rod to canada along with my spinning gear of course. Love the may fly hatch. what more can ya ask for....the walleyes are feeding like crazy. Tie on a #14-18 tied up may fly nymph and catch a boat full all day long.
4891873,adempsey,2016-06-02 07:24:00,963,"I often go on a trip at the end of June/start of July and will confirm that the hatch is often within this time frame. Sometimes a week before, sometimes after. It has never totally killed fishing for us though. The bonus is that it brings up the Whitefish!A piece of worm on a slip bobber setup has worked for me, as has a smaller ""Go Getter"" worm harness with some worm. Basically, a size 1 or 2 Colorado blade with small 4mm neutral colored beads. When I experience a Mayfly hatch next, I will probably use something like a small ""Walleye Killer"" rig, which is basically a harness with an egg or bullet sinker slipped onto the loop of the harness so you can cast/retrieve it. Should work great. One of those heavy long-cast in-line spinners could work to."
4892129,jkaup,2016-06-02 08:26:00,56,"Thanks gents! We could see big ol walleyes flopping around on top scooping up flies. We just didn't know what technique to use to score. This year I have a pretty wide range of tackle and with these tips, if it does occur, we should boat some of them. Thanks!!"
4892361,1K1MOA,2016-06-02 09:45:00,90,"Thanks for the thread. I will be up next week, probably a bit early, but I threw my fly rod into the arsenal after reading this."
4892417,Bluebomber,2016-06-02 09:56:00,29,We always come home from lac seul the last weekend in June. Over the last 20 years going up there I'd say we have experienced the hatch probably 40-50% of the time. The one bad thing about the hatch is the eyes are so fat when you grab them to take the hook out they poop all over the boat. Which seems to attract the flies!
