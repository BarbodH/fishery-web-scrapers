6704759,prov1800,2023-01-05 08:02:00,5010,No water being let out for a while now.Only water coming out is through turbine..Most lakes are pretty low already.Definatly not as much snow as last year.

6704673,Eckohlt,2023-01-04 16:38:00,3685,"That's a great pic,wish I was standing by the water when you snapped it."
6704677,prov1800,2023-01-04 17:32:00,5010,Lot of pike and walleye make there way up there.
6704679,Eckohlt,2023-01-04 17:47:00,3685,Wouldn't mind at all giving them alittle snack on there way up there.
6704683,Spurgery,2023-01-04 17:57:00,79,Very pretty. I don’t envy your winter temps and snow up there but I do the scenery that’s for sure.
6704687,prov1800,2023-01-04 18:24:00,5010,So this river goes 3+ miles from this spot and then joins into the Wabigoon River from there to hwy 105.Ive had a boat in there and would say the fishing is very good.Lots of current and 2 sets of rapids with awesome fishing.Not much fishing goes on there.10 miles of river.like a flyout.

6704691,prov1800,2023-01-04 18:38:00,5010,[QUOTE=Eckohlt;6704689]By dam in spring walleyes spawn right there I know guy on hwy 105 who has land on east side of hwy and I would put my deep/wide 14 ft misty river in off his prop.Deep many years moose hunt until the secret was out But did have great fishing.
6704707,RichA$1970,2023-01-04 19:53:00,1159,How nice it would be to have a cabin there and a warm fire burning
6704747,rosh1,2023-01-05 07:50:00,275,Pro nice picture but I cant tell how much water they are letting out. A few weeks ago when we were there it wasn't a lot. Hope that still the case. Please keep the pictures coming.
