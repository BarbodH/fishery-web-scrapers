6704955,mjames,2023-01-06 07:06:00,18,Regina bay and Lobstick bay both have a walleye population but it's nowhere near the population size when you get to the more stained water west of Sioux Narrows. Fishing can be very slow but the size usually makes up for it and is usually a mid summer on bite. If you're after numbers then don't waste your time but if you just want a meal then that can be had once you learn the area. I assume that's similar to Long Bay as well? As for the Navionics mapping the thing I don't like about it is that I find it a bit of a hazard because you can be cruising along and the map says the reef is 50 yards to the left then all of a sudden you could be on top of it because the gps coordinates are off in relation to the map. That is not true for everywhere but it is in enough spots around the lake that it just can't be trusted for navigation. I know these maps aren't supposed to be trusted for navigation but Lakemaster was actually surveyed by boat so the mapping is much more accurate and has been very reliable for me. I have found some spots where the depth isn't quite right but never has a reef not been in the right spot or has my boat shown on land on the graph. Also the 1 foot contours on Lakemaster are really helpful when it comes to fishing. Until Navionics actually comes out and does a real survey which will probably never happen I will be using Lakemaster but that's just my opinion.
6704983,fishin779,2023-01-06 08:56:00,63,"Like I originally posted,I had a Lakemaster chip but it didn't have the east end of Regina Bay on it nor the area out west by Rope or Little Rope. Has this been updated ?? Thanks for your input !"
6704985,mjames,2023-01-06 09:10:00,18,"Yes, the Lakemaster crew came out a few years ago and finished Lobstick and all the way to Kenora. The entire Lake of the Woods is complete now and is included on the Lakemaster Ontario V2 chip and the Lakemaster Manitoba chip. Well worth it considering all the good navigation and fishing info on there."
6705045,martinbns,2023-01-06 13:07:00,1520,"Thanks John, I was hoping someone from the Camp was a member here. My first boat had a small Lowrance unit, 2 lower units later on unmarked shoals I upgraded. I fished the north part of the lake where I could go most places from memory but the first few times out in and around Snake Bay reminded me of how I felt originally. I'll see what I find."
6705427,fishin779,2023-01-09 06:04:00,63,"I just wanted to say thanks to all for the good and intelligent conversation concerning boats and electronics under this Sioux Narrows thread! It is truly appreciated. No one felt the need to make "" off color"" comments,etc. , just a group of guys trying to help each other!! Hope you guys enjoy staying at Paradise Point, like I said earlier, I've known Richard for approx. 40 years and he is a stand up guy, possibly a mechanical genius also !!!"
6703167,martinbns,2022-12-24 22:57:00,1520,"My wife and I bought a Park Model trailer in Paradise Point in SN, I am looking to upgrade my dash graph and am wondering about the quality of available map chips for Lowrance and/or Garmin. I am used to fishing the Northern part of LOTW where the Humminbird Lakemaster chip has 1' contours, how are the various Navionics offerings for the Sioux Narrows area? I currently have an Onix 8si looking at something 12"""
6703177,fishin779,2022-12-25 05:46:00,63,"I have a cabin on Long Bay, across from the Totem Resort. About 10 years ago, I bought a new Hummingbird Helix 7 with a LakeMaster chip. I went out fishing and headed about 20 miles west, and to my surprise I ran off the map! The very next day, I went about 5 miles east, into Regina Bay, and once again ran off the map !! Since then , I have been using the Navionics chip and am incredibly happy with it.I DO NOT fish tourneys, used to do that, so I get having good mapping. Hope this helps and glad to hear that you are now a part of the wonderful community of S/N and Richard at Paradice Point is a great guy!!"
6703295,martinbns,2022-12-26 08:23:00,1520,"Yes, Lakemaster only had certain portions of the lake mapped in those days. Two years ago they did the whole thing. Some of the south end of the lake near the US portion had been previously done, like the Big Narrows area. I was bombing across that area 5-6 years ago and all of a sudden hit the detailed 1' contour mapping and had to stop and figure out how to read it."
6703389,fishin779,2022-12-27 04:44:00,63,"So.. a bit off the subject..but do you feel your boat is big enough? I've been kicking around a ""new to me"" boat and just think something in the 20' range for living on LOTW is the route to go.Most of the time , I fish with just two in a boat but there are times the kids are there and need to be able to tube. Also have days when I'm out most of the day fishing walleyes and smallies. I also realize that everyone has two footitis!! thanks for your input !"
6703433,martinbns,2022-12-27 09:55:00,1520,"For us I would say yes, since we bought it new we moored it in Kenora and lived in Winnipeg. The ProV has tons of storage but it it cluttered, the past couple of seasons our adult daughter has come with us more and it does get crowded. If I had an unlimited budget I would probably have a 2075, but I don't and can't see spending an additional $65-70k to upgrade at this point which is close to retirement. I think with the Trailer in Sioux Narrows it will be fine, I expect we will be out more often for shorter periods of time. It wasn't unusual for us on a nice productive day to be on the water by 9:30 and not off until well after 6:00. I suspect we will go out for a few hours at a time and won't need to store as much stuff on the boat."
6703435,Lmbkiller,2022-12-27 10:01:00,639,What did u to your current boat that makes it so invaluable that to upgrade to a 2075 u would need to spend $70000? If u sold your 1875 and bought a 2075 3-4yrs old no way it would cost u an extra $70000
6703929,martinbns,2022-12-31 08:14:00,1520,"I was talking new to new. I paid $70k cdn in 2017 before electronics, TM and Kicker for my 1875 and a new one is now over $100k cdn. A new 2075 is about $140k cdn"
6704763,mjames,2023-01-05 08:05:00,18,Humminbird with lakemaster is and has been by far the best mapping for the Sioux Narrows area and the rest of lake of the woods now. Navionics and garmin mapping have lots of information but very inaccurate. If I were you I wouldn't switch from Humminbird to go to a lowrance or garmin. I have a cabin in Regina bay and personally have a 10 Onix that I use mainly for the mapping with Lakemaster Ontario V2 chip and have a garmin unit with airmar transducer which is incredible chirp 2d sonar.
6704773,JohnWF,2023-01-05 08:29:00,129,"Martin: I'm one of your neighbors at Paradise. Since I'm in the Lowrance camp, I can't offer anything on the Humminbird or the Garmin. This winter I purchased one of the 12"" Lowrance LIVE units that are being closed out. The built-in C-MAP chart covers the whole lake with excellent detail. This chart is definitely better than the built-in charts that the early LIVE units had. Now, mind you, I have not been on the water with this new charting, but I sampled a few areas with which I am familiar, and the contours looked accurate. I also use a Navionics Platinum chart because I like the ""big picture"" aspect for navigating. I think much of Navionics 1' contours are the result of extrapolating, so I don't use that feature. A Navionics Premium chart would be fine, no need for the Platinum. With a 12"" screen I can display two charts, so I get the best of both worlds. On a side-note/rant, it burns me to pay a couple hundred dollars for a digital chart with features that allow me to customize the chart only to have some of those features go away if you don't send the company some more money in a year!

6704921,fishin779,2023-01-06 03:20:00,63,"I have a couple of comments. I spoke to a couple of gentlemen at the Men's Club meeting this summer and they commented that there isn't much walleye fishing in the Regina Bay and Lobstick Bay area. I am trying to find places closer to home to fish. Just asking your opinion. The second comment is about the Hummingbird unit that I am running. It is apprx. 10 years old with a Navionics chip. I have never updated the unit. I ""assume"" that the lake has not been mapped in the last 10 years and if I look at paper maps and my unit, I can get just about anywhere and I can also see most ""underwater"" humps that I run over while on the move. I do know all these new electronics are a game changer, but sometimes it's still fun to just go ""fishing"". Don't forget ""sometimes, catching fish gets in the way of fishing"", LOL !!"
