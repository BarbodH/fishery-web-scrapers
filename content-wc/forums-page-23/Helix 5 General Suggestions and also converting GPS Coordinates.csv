A small issue I have encounterd is entering exact GPS coordinates for my waypoints. My old Eagle Cuda used this format: 50 38 659, 90 58 270 The Helix 5 uses a different format. When I use an online converter I get 50.644317 90.971167 for my Helix 5 The Helix 5 does not allow for that last digit. Should I round 50.644317 to 50.64432 and 90.971167 to 90.97117? I ask because I did not round up and my exact location seems slightly off when plotted on a map."
6700886,DeBo,2022-12-12 14:07:00,211,You can create a google map and put pins all over the lake you intend to fish. Very helpful for new lakes. Sometimes Ontario Fish-Online has way better imaging that can help you find shallow spots. Can show coordinates as well. You can export the google map pins and get them on your helix.For the issues mentioned you may want to try out GPS Babel. It’s very helpful for converting waypoints to different formats. Can’t help with your issue personally but I can vouch for GPS Babel being super helpful.

Check the following on You tube= Humminbird Helix Position Format, Waypoint Sharing With Lowrance, Garmin, and the Navionics App. My buddy is in the same boat so I'm hoping this will work but he hasn't checked yet. Good Luck and let us know if it works"
6700988,55walleyes,2022-12-13 04:14:00,131,Thank you. I was able to change the format.
6701126,Stormbringer,2022-12-13 15:59:00,112,Nice choice! I use the same unit for fly-ins and ice fishing. Using a lithium 10 amp hour battery will SIGNIFICANTLY lengthen usage time between charges. Having 2 lithium batteries will last a week's worth of usage.
6702943,brian1785,2022-12-23 13:28:00,1534,How were you able to do that? Thanks!
6702985,55walleyes,2022-12-23 16:06:00,131,When I turn the unit on I selected simulator mode. Then under setup tab go down to user mode and select custom. Original setup is on angler. After changing user mode continue down the setup tab to position format. Let me know if this works for you. I am still a novice but I am pretty sure that is what I did.
