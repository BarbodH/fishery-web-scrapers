6690548,DavKin,2022-10-08 07:13:00,104,This is the first year we did not bring in leeches or salted minnows because of the new rules. In place of leeches we brought beef heart which produced and we plan to bring more next year. For the week at a fly-in outpost five guys caught 1800+ mostly vertical jigging in 15-35 FOW 8/29 to 9/5. I'm curious what other did and did the new bait rules affect fishing success?
6690696,MN_Moose,2022-10-09 07:17:00,964,"Interesting. Did you freeze the beef heart? To answer your question, we simply bought our crawlers and leaches in Nestor Falls."
6690704,DavKin,2022-10-09 07:23:00,104,"Yes, I froze the beef heart, partially thawed for slicing with electric knife and refroze after slicing. We too used crawlers."
6691654,proguidedream,2022-10-13 08:16:00,345,did you try a z-man minnow or powerbait in between those 1800 fish ? meat is not always the answer
6692184,DavKin,2022-10-16 05:36:00,104,"Yes, I had some success with Gulp max scent minnows on. 3/8 long shank jig."
6704819,SJC305,2023-01-05 11:57:00,154,"I was just reading over the 2023 fishing regulations. Going through the BMZ section, nothing was mentioned about crawlers for this year. Baitfish, leeches, frogs etc were covered, including the legal types/species of fish that can be used. I don't mind buying bait on my trips as I like to support the local business, but buying a dozen crawlers at a time half can be a pain. Ordering a half flat in paper bedding and having them ready to go was a nice option. Also, we drive up through the night/morning when none of the bait shops are open so that's not an option for us either."
6704923,kettyspanky,2023-01-06 04:23:00,271,That's what i wondered about. What is the website where I could lookup bait rules for 2023. We use alot of crawlers and it's alot easier to bring a flat from home then to get them up where we go. We made it work the last few years but it's always easier bringing them from home. Thanks in advance for the help.
6704925,walleyecheek,2023-01-06 04:32:00,2231,"No crawlers allowed to cross the border anymore ! They said it was just temporary, but that was a crock ! CANADA wants your money ! And also if you want to hear it from the Horses mouth just call the Border !"
6704929,h8go4s,2023-01-06 05:18:00,1673,"Canada's kind of a big country, you know. But here's the link for the province of Ontario. It'll keep you busy for a while."
