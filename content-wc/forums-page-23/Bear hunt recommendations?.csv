The hunting area seems very slow.I am looking for recommendations for a good outfitter for a spring 2023 black bear hunt in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, or Alberta. Due to the distance I will be flying so airport access is necessary. My goals are a high quality wilderness experience, seeing plenty of bears, and bagging a mature boar with a good unrubbed pelt. Decent people, an experienced guide, a clean cabin, and wholesome food are also important. This will be a solo trip - not all outfitters will accept a solo hunter. Please feel free to post info here or by PM where I will supply my email address.Likewise, if you know of outfitters to avoid, that too would be helpful.Thank you for any suggestions!"
6703675,proguidedream,2022-12-29 11:13:00,345,"www. eaglenest.ca/hunting/ pretty cool river and definitely wilderness, about 1.5 hour drive from winnipeg, looks like the also offer a fly-in experience from LDB that is 1 hour from winnipeg. www. dogskin.com/spring-bear-hunting spring bear should be pretty much a gauranteed hunt in MB if you are willing to shoot a decent size bear.. if you are holding out for a monster and decide to pass then maybe not. i would ask about success rates when booking. there are plenty of guide services close to WPG that offer guided hunts.. however would not be a lodge experience with food etc."
6703723,Ohio fisherman,2022-12-29 17:23:00,988,"Thanks for the suggestions. I will add them to the list to research. Initially I should have included Ontario, but that was an oversight. So suggestions about outfitters in Ontario are welcome. Thanks again!"
6703821,proguidedream,2022-12-30 11:39:00,345,"there is probably 100 options for what you want, so will depend on your budget. i would narrow down a specific area based on your travel needs. or lodging wants. this looks like a good trip also, https://www.candlelakeoutfitters.com...nagement%20use."
6703851,prov1800,2022-12-30 14:12:00,5010,Since Ontario is now on the list check this one out.They don't take many hunters and have a huge area.Great fishing to in between hunting.www.clarksresorts.com
6703911,fishin779,2022-12-31 05:30:00,63,You might try Crawfords Camp in Sioux Narrows. Matt and his wife run a great place and I know they do bear hunting trips.
6704109,Ohio fisherman,2023-01-01 10:32:00,988,"Thanks for the additional names. I will add them to my list to research and evaluate. I have sent out about a dozen emails finding only a couple that are booked full so options seem open. However, I don't want to miss out on what is available. Happy New Year!"
