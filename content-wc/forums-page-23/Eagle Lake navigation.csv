6703659,NM_Trout,2022-12-29 09:42:00,1094,OK... looks like I need to give Eagle Lake a try. I think I've seen that one of the issues with Eagle lake is that hazards are not well marked. Are there any electronic charts available that have hazards marked on the charts? Ripping a hole in my hull or tearing up a lower unit has me spooked from bringing my 17' Mirrocraft up there.
6703667,7 Mag,2022-12-29 10:07:00,1887,What part of Eagle Lake are you going too?
6703677,Yellowfin123,2022-12-29 11:15:00,2182,"^^^^ true where are you going? i've ran all over like the whole western half off eagle with just basic maps with no problem, i've seen where way over in shallower osborne bay can have alot hidden land mines... there are some places like west of bible camp but they are marked with a peice of rebar with a milkjug on top but other than that I don't think eagle's a problem"
6703679,NM_Trout,2022-12-29 11:15:00,1094,"i have no idea yet :-) I am in early stages of planning! I like the idea of doing a multi-species trip. Hit the deeper part for lake trout, but I also like fly casting in the shallows for pike and hopefully musky. It's the shallower part of the lake for pike / smallmouth that I'm a bit spooked by. Even here in NM, our reservoirs are so low... I carefully follow nav buoys when running, and pretty much idle or am on my TM when near shallows and known hazards."
6703683,NM_Trout,2022-12-29 11:23:00,1094,"Century lodge looks like fun, and the housekeeping package at $145 a night is pretty tempting. But I know nothing about the lake... so who knows yet."
6703695,7 Mag,2022-12-29 12:10:00,1887,"I've not been that far south to the Century Lodge, i've fished portage bay and to the north and west into vermillion bay. I didn't have any navigational issues using lakemaster with my bird, on the water the hazards where identified with buoys. Shallow water i just used my TM and i didn't have any issues either."
6703709,Ricky Spanish,2022-12-29 14:41:00,1298,"I personally wouldn't trust Navionics, but it's better than nothing. Depending on the locator you have, the lodge might offer to upload hazards and waypoints. I was lucky enough to have a guide at Temple Bay share his tracks since we both had Helix 9's. On my earlier days to Temple Bay Lodge, we'd run with our guide once or twice down to Nivens to musky fish passing by Century Lodge on the way. If all their guide boats were gone, we'd stop and catch our shore lunch fish right off the northwest side of their island. June/July trips. After several years of 1-2wks guided I started bringing my own boat in about 2007. I never go that far anymore. Don't need to. We did stay once at Island Lodge. Not bad, but we prefer TBL. I'm happy to answer questions or mark up a Hotspots map if you'll be in the central part of the lake."
6703745,Medy,2022-12-29 21:50:00,40,I would not trust any of the current map chips if you plan on exploring anywhere south or east of the windigo island/kushel rock area. Your best bet would be to have the camp you stay at mark a map up for you or share hazard waypoints if they will.
6703771,prov1800,2022-12-30 07:44:00,5010,"I normally fish most of Eagle in all sections.From mid lake to the west arm its pretty safe but heading east is another story and need to be very carefull. Not many markers.Reserve bay,rice bay,Boulder bay can get you into trouble.Just take it slow and find a good route and then expand off that."
