6705017,spoonchucker,2023-01-06 11:36:00,82,Fished it year before Jackson's bought it. Weather was cold and rain throughout but plenty of walleye and some good sized pike. Had portage lakes but weather prohibited us from getting to them. I would like to fish it again some time but taking bigger trips now.
