Any issues going in or coming back, Any thing special we need to bring ? Also is Arrive Canada still in effect and the best way to go ? Thanks"

Make a copy of all docs. If asked, show or give the copies. Never give up your original docs. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PROOF OF INSURANCE INCLUDING DOCUMENTATION THAT YOUR INSURANCE IS VALID IN CANADA. I take a set of copies of all docs relevant to the journey. Originals stay with me. IMPORTANT - If they don't ask, don't give them the paperwork. It can cause them to become suspicious. If they ask, tell them that you brought everything that they might want to review to see that you are the legal and lawful owner. Don't wear black and white striped pajamas."

6704849,Jesse-WI,2023-01-05 14:00:00,534,Yes but it has been many years and they never asked. You just need your temporary registration and proof of insurance like you do in the US. .

We had all our purchase papers, proof of insurance & temporary license in the truck. No questions asked & no problems crossing & did not have to show any paperwork. RBF"
