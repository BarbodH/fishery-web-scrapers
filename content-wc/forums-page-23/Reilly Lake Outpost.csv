6377212,pike50plus,2019-12-11 19:29:00,584,Pm me your contact info I still have Reilly maps from a tripo there when ganglers had it
6592330,Guest,2021-08-24 10:20:00,0,"Hey Pike50, i know this thread is from a few years ago, but we just booked with Reilly lake outpost for first week of July next year...would you be willing to share the maps and any other info... thanks"
6705329,esoxlucius69,2023-01-08 16:37:00,2,"Our group has tentatively booked July 6 - 13th at Reilly lake outpost for this year (2023). Would appreciate connecting with anyone and talk about the outpost. Looks like a great place for Pike and Walleye (and maybe even Lake Trout?), but a couple in my group are a little concerned about the boats (unfortunately, on the web site, one of the photos of a gentleman holding a trophy shows a fairly beat up old boat). Any comments? The second concern is for the cabins, as they seem a little ""basic""....most of us are OK with the cabins, but I had the owner (Dave, a really nice guy) send me a photo of the inside of the cabin, and the concern is that the table would barely hold 4 people for breakfast or dinner, let alone 6 or 8 guys (our group size is currently 6, but could be 8)....again, any comments here? Anyways, as mentioned, if someone could email me any info, I would also love to talk to anyone about the outpost, and I can be reached at 647-999-8080....and my name is Ed Thanks!"
6705333,spoonchucker,2023-01-08 17:26:00,82,"Here is article on our trip. Great area to fish. As for acomadations, I remember shower house- bathroom as very clean and good hot water and pressure. Cabins were functional and clean. We were large group, I think 12 and spread out but got together for dinners, can't remebertable sittings but the camp owner and the manager were great. The boats were fine, as long as they don't leak I would not care how old they are. Do not recall any motor problems, seems motors were all well taken care of. https://www.onthewater.com/uncharted-territory..."
6705453,Bill Krejca,2023-01-09 07:21:00,6107,"Nice report. Re: barbless, single hooks, only - I would like to see this applied to those waters which are designated as special muskie waters. I have fished no barb Manitoba waters and loss due to no barb is not noticeable. Continued catch and release of large fish which have been taken by multi-hook barbed baits, in my humble opinion, takes a toll on the fish. Just my opinion. Bill"
6705479,esoxlucius69,2023-01-09 09:00:00,2,"Spoonchucker, thanks for the reply and web link....I had located that link previously, and looks like there is some great fishing. Appreciate the comments about the boats, motors and dining......part of our group is more into the social aspect than the fishing itself......if you get a chance, my number is 647-999-8080....would appreciate any discussion and of course any suggestions for the fishing, such as maps, locations, spoons used, etc.... Cheers!"
6705519,prov1800,2023-01-09 10:49:00,5010,Grew up in Manitoba and never used a barbed hook till I moved to Ontario.Loosing a few fish isn't the end of the world.
6705561,Eckohlt,2023-01-09 12:29:00,3685,"It's the end of the world if you only have one fish on for the day,and it's supper n gets away.lol"
6705619,LittleBait,2023-01-09 18:54:00,37,"I also fished there 20+ yrs ago, great fishing, hooked my only 50+ but failed to land he rammed the boat two times and when he finally wnet under the middle line was cut on bottom of boat! GRRRRR!! Still have a nice marked map of the lake.https://reindeerlakelodge.ca/reilly_outpost.html"

6267492,spoonchucker,2018-12-09 15:23:00,82,"Making annual trek this year to Reilly lake Outpost in Saskatchewan. Love to hear from anyone who ever fished this area, Did Misekumaw last year and loved it. My group had great rate from previous owner and new owner honored it and he made several upgrades. Would love to go back but he had to raise his prices and my group has monetary limits. Told Reilly owner our limit and he was willing to meet it. As to Misekumaw, my son caught over a hundred pike on the fly between 34-41 inches, and this was end of July. I am not a fly guy but I caught seven pike between 34-37 inches on eight consecutive casts at one spot. We caught countless pike in mid 30's, no trolling, all casting plastics and spoons, all single hook barbless. Got to believe survival rate of fish and fisherman is greater with single barbless, and I do not believe I lose many fish not employing set of trebles."
6267494,spoonchucker,2018-12-09 15:30:00,82,"May have confused you- This is first time ever to Reilly. We do make an annual trek up north each year though. Further on Misekumaw- they had new electronics in every boat of high quality. As a group of eleven, we caught about 1500 pike in 5 days (did not do a full week). All size was great, almost hard to ever ind one under 30, but our biggest was 42 and 1/2, and only six at 41 or better."
6373300,Guest,2019-11-23 04:14:00,0,We're thinking about Reilly Lake next summer. Curious to see how your trip went.
6373470,adempsey2.0,2019-11-24 00:25:00,611,That looks like an insanely awesome camp. Would also love to hear about your trip.
6374324,Larry S,2019-11-28 07:00:00,665,"Spoonchucker I went to Reilly Lake Camp when it was owned by Gangler's in 1989 Caught Hundreds of Walleye, Northern & Lake Trout Who owns it Now?? Since its connected to Reindeer Lake You should have No Problem catching hundreds of fish Larry S"
6375062,spoonchucker,2019-12-01 18:49:00,82,"We loved Reilly. I had a group of ten and it was one of our best rips- ranks in the top 3 of 35 years of trips. Here is why: Cabins were cleanest we ever walked into- Owner delivered exactly- we were all flown in in one plane at break of dawn and flown out at 6;30 am so we could catch plane in Saskatoon with out overnight on way back. Bathrooms and showers were excellent. fishing action was constant. Trip was tailored to our schedule -5 days at a fair rate end of July. We are mostly pike hunters and had plenty of action and I got my pb 44 incher- several were caught by group at 40 and a few 42. Pike were of all size though, not like Misekumaw where pike ranged almost all at 34- 40. The walleye were incredible and we don't target them but had to do it when they were so plentiful- they hit before the jig hit bottom. To get an idea, my son caught 55- almost all 18-22 inch in one spot at mouth of river in less than 2 hours of walleye fishing. Pike readily attacked walleye when we brought them in and he got some great underwater video of the attacks. Walleyes as well as pike hit the spoons too. We fish no treble hook lures- only single barbless. There is so much water to fish It would take many trips to ever feel that you have a good feel for the place. We never ventured more than a one hour boat ride from camp so never got down to south end of Reilly or much in to Reindeer. I think we started to figure out where big pike were toward end of the trip. We are casters not trollers. Owner actually came from lodge to meet us on arrival and flew in to say goodbye but we were taking off just as his plane arrived. Could use bigger motors though for as much water as there is to fish, but I think they fear hitting rocks. Incredibly, ( and unusually) my group never hit one the entire trip. Camp attendant Norm and wife were great people but not intrusive. We spent evenings around the camp fire with ten Cabela chairs they set up ( the good ones with the cup holders) never fishing past 8 pm so we relaxed more than usual and maybe that is why we enjoyed it even more. Used Mrs Groceries in Saskatoon again for a terrific job of getting fresh food and packing it well in the cooler bags she bought. I have had camps get our food ahead of time before and it is hit or miss- like once getting six day old coldcuts on the day we arrived. We flew from Buffalo NY to Saskatoon ( used a great group rate from Delta) used the Amex Delta Card which allows 8 bags free ( got it just for this trip) because we really hate the Toronto airport chaos and drive back to Buffalo after coming home. Just need to check rates and times- although we have used Toronto many times when rates are just too good- always use Air Canada Group rates too. We did not fish for Lakers not our idea of fun trying to find them in deep holes in mid summer when the pike and walleye were aggressive. Just a really enjoyable trip."
6375854,Larry S,2019-12-05 08:07:00,665,Again Spoonchucker Who Owns Reilly Now??
6375908,spoonchucker,2019-12-05 10:45:00,82,Dave and Wanda Woycenko-- They own pipestone but I think the ALberta fires may have caused that to be rebuilt since they were at Reindeer when we were there.
6376118,Larry S,2019-12-06 08:54:00,665,"Thanks, But what is the name of the Resort to look and maybe book!"
6376142,spoonchucker,2019-12-06 11:02:00,82,"Sorry- did not realize what you wanted- Reilly Lake Outpost is the outpost run by Reindeer Lake Lodge. Depending on size of group and when you want to go, you should be able to make a reasonable deal on pricing as opposed to posted rates-"
