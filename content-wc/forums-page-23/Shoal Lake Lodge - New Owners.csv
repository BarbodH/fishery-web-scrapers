I don't know if Tim sold the business and got out of running a camp altogether. If so, their timing was close to perfect with the pandemic. If you've been at camp with the new ownership, how was it? Definitely a unique fishery with some really good fishing. Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences."
6685414,Jquinn_7,2022-09-10 15:12:00,4,Wondering the same about Shoal. Was an awesome fishery in the 2005 to 2015 range. Crazy fishing. Remember the days when the wiley point and totem resort folks would offer a $500 a day - remote trip to Shoal and there guests would troll for pike lol. I have not made it back since the change in ownership / pandemic. Also wondering the same thing about Tim and his family. Tim was a great guySent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

6703843,Spurgery,2022-12-30 12:53:00,79,Realize that shoal is a walleye sanctuary and you cannot fish for them. Period. Hoping someone will be able to respond in regard to the lodge itself and potential new owners.
