6704805,FinmanPoozie,2023-01-05 10:42:00,696,"I've read a number of pike posts outside of here suggesting 20-40# fluorocarbon won't get bit off, but it's a single fish leader. At least I'm not destroying a presentation by adding steel (regardless of the length or weight) Contrary to some posts, IMHO 6"" leaders are also probably not long enough if the goal is not being bit off when not targeting pike. Hopefully, I'll know in May on a pike trip if I get bit off or not. 40# felt really stiff so I opted for 25# Gamma Edge fluorocarbon (read multiple stellar reviews) & still getting me the abrasion resistance of fluorocarbon. Plenty of info on a ton of other sites with fluorocarbon's abrasion resistance compared to both braid & mono to back me up.40""+ pike? Not a clue, but other guys say this works. Biggest on the lake I'm going to is around 36"" so far (doubt there are any 40+ inchers around there)I have 25# Gamma Edge fluo leaders tied for that trip. I'll try to remember to update this post after May with whatever I find, plusses & minuses, whatever. I'm typically fishing live bait + lures, 4 lines in the water all day long.I hate steel leaders, so if this # test works that'll be my go-to going forward in toothy waters. I'd seriously reconsider looking at steel leaders for walleye in pike waters. Happy fishing!!"
6704857,DeBo,2023-01-05 14:31:00,211,"I’ve had reasonable success with Seaguar Leader material in 20 and 25#. Compared to no leader it’s a massive improvement. But the thick flouro will impact the sink rate of your jig. May or may not matter. I’ve caught a pile of shallow water Eyes, Crappies, and pike on those leaders with 1/8-1/2oz jigs. Small ripple Shads to 5-6” swimbaits. You will donate a few baits if the pike are super thick.The AFW Surflon Micro Supreme in 13# pairs up very nicely with small cranks and 1/8-1/4 type jigs. For Canada tannin stained low pressure fish you’ll catch plenty. For my pike trip I run braid or flour main uni-uni to a 20/25# flouro leader and then that wire to that flouro leader with a 3 turn uni-uni. Learned that from Doug Stange in an InFish article. Works great and you can catch a ton of pike on purpose and some walleyes by accident without retying. I use it with normal paddle tails and bass jigs with 26# wire. The flouro leader is nice for landing fish as it’s easy to grab.For jigging Canada walleyes I’d experiment with the 13# wire and 10-15# flouro if needed or straight to mainline. If you are using heavier equipment the flouro between the main braid and the wire acts as a shock absorber. When I first tried the AFW wire with big swimbaits I had break offs on hook sets. But the shock leader solves that. Obviously not a great rig with tons of snags but no leaders are good in that situation."
6704223,Bill Krejca,2023-01-02 07:13:00,6107,"There are a number of small dia wire leaders out there. I make my own out of light single strand wire, swivel, snap. When I used to fish Saskatchewan, I used them on a regular basis, due to the enormous number of pike in the area I fished, for example, 26 pike on 26 casts. Generally, tho, I get by just tying directly to the jig; water being fished, obviously, can make the decision whether to use leader, or not. Bill"
6704391,NM_Trout,2023-01-02 20:38:00,1094,"I use 12"" of 40lb flouro with a Rapala loop knot to the lure. Works well, and the loop knot helps to preserve some of the action."
6704453,BCNeal,2023-01-03 07:34:00,19,"I use an 8""-10"" length of AFW Surfstrand Steel Leader. It's the 7x7 strand in 13 lb test. It can be tied using a simple clinch knot using 3-4 turns. I was worried this would reduce the number of walleye bites but after watching my boat partner using the leader catch as many or more walleyes than I was I became a believer. It doesn't deter walleyes from hitting and it sure helps land those monster pike that hit a walleye jig and plastic."
6704479,guidedfishing,2023-01-03 10:16:00,531,Well if I an fishing walleye's and pike are biting me off my first thought is not to go to a steel leader. Especially if it is more finesse type fishing. I usually just take the good with the bad and retie to my 8lb fluorocarbon leader. If it was really an issue I would just put on a heavier Fluorocarbon leader say 15-20lbs. The only time I would consider putting steel leaders on if I am pitching cranks when there is a high probability that a snot rocket will separate my plug from me. Other wise I save the steel leaders for when I am specifically targeting pike. I have seen guys tie directly to their braided line as well. Just depends on how finicky or how hot the bit may be. When the bite is on a steel leader and a corn dog will work. If you are using a steel leader and hammering the walleye who am I to judge. You do what works. Good luck.
6704499,prov1800,2023-01-03 12:03:00,5010,"If I loose a few jigs it's not that big of a deal.But we fish smallies a lot in the spring with cranks and there's muskie cruising all over the areas and they are very aggressive then and we will put on a small 6"" steel leader which really doesn't matter to the bass but saves the 12 dollar cranks."
6704553,krazyk711,2023-01-03 18:04:00,26,Just get a 30 # titanium leader and put split rings on instead of the snap because snaps fail.. Finntastic made the best ones but Jackson lures is out of stock on most of them..VMC makes a good one. I use them even when I'm jigging for eye's.. fish don't care cause their already eating something fake to begin with !!!! I only use flouro when panfishing or jigging for big lakers as its easier on them when they roll up !!!! Big teeth cut flouro why take the chance ??
6704649,DocRollo,2023-01-04 15:01:00,8,Just go to a craft store and pick up some beadalon. It is a multistrand wire that is very thin. We either tie it directly to the jig or use crimps. All of our group uses it for jigging in Canada and heavily fished water in Wisconsin. We have done so for many years. It does not reduce the number of fish caught and eliminates bite offs and reduces breakoffs due to rocks.
6704653,Spurgery,2023-01-04 15:27:00,79,Is there a certain size of beadalon to look for? Does it actually tie well? Thanks for the info.
6704675,DocRollo,2023-01-04 16:39:00,8,"seven strand. We also use 20 lb berkely wire leader. The beadalon ties easier. We have been doing this for 20 years. We have done countless side by side comparisons using mono, braid, fluoro and have found no reduction catching walleye with the wire. The loss rate is dramatically less. One of our guys only uses 3-4 inches. I use about 8 inch leader for lead jigs and other lures. The leaders eventually get kinked after a few dozen walleyes so you just cut them off with a scissor or nipper and retie. You can tie bare handed but a couple of pliers makes for a tighter knot. At home we tie up a bunch before a trip using a vise and needle nose. Crimps make the job very easy and fast but the crimps are harder on your hands if you grab the leaders. About four per jig size is all you need for a week long canada trip. You can order online (amazon and others) or go to a local craft store. They will know what beadalon is."
6704681,Spurgery,2023-01-04 17:55:00,79,Thanks for the info. Think I’ll give the beadalon a try. I’m lazy and don’t like to re-tie after bite offs and always wonder maybe that was my elusive 40 inch pike that bit me off. &#x1f917;
6704133,lionfan19,2023-01-01 12:01:00,41,Does anyone make a smaller diameter wire leader that I could use on my walleye rod when I keep getting bit off by pike?
6704137,Spurgery,2023-01-01 13:33:00,79,Eagle Claw makes a micro leader that I use when pulling cranks for walleye. Not really a great option for jigging though.
6704141,lionfan19,2023-01-01 13:50:00,41,sounds like flourocarbon is the way to go but how heavy to offer any real protection against pike bite offs?
6704143,prov1800,2023-01-01 13:53:00,5010,Are you jigging or trolling.
6704145,lionfan19,2023-01-01 14:08:00,41,"Jigging, looking around on internet and sounds like flourocarbon is a little more bite resistant."
6704147,prov1800,2023-01-01 14:24:00,5010,That it is.I run 12 lb braid and 12 lb gamma flour on all my reels and don't get bit off to often and if I do it's usually smaller pike with sharper teeth.But have caught walleye on steel leaders to but usually in more stained waters.Good luck.
6704149,adempsey2.0,2023-01-01 15:19:00,611,"Purchase, or make, some 6"" titanium wire leaders. You can just tie the lower lb test wire as well, which is all you really need.https://www.afwfishing.com/afw_produ...childskumatch=https://aquateko.com/products/knot-2...14092139528259 The 7x7 strand stainless steel is good too.https://www.afwfishing.com/afw_produ...childskumatch="
6704151,RichA$1970,2023-01-01 15:51:00,1159,I run a double uni-knot with 17# Fluoro which works most of the time for jigging. Titaniun leaders work well for trolling and if the water is stained then the Eagle Claw micros are cheap and work well also.
6704153,fishron,2023-01-01 15:56:00,317,"For trolling, 5 inch, twelve pound test, invisa-leaders made by South Bend have always served well for pike. For jigging I take my chances with flourocarbon."
6704175,Lmbkiller,2023-01-01 19:37:00,639,"If u are trolling no reason for wire. I run 4-15 power pro with 15lb pline flouro coated mono leader and a snap, I'm about 98% bite off free. The speed of the lure prevents most game fish of any size from biting lure off. My speed 1.6-2.8"
