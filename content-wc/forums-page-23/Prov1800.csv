I packed the hiking/snowshoe trails with the snowmobile, then headed out to the ice shack for a couple of hours of fishing. I know what is on the Boxing Day lunch menu. Merry Christmas to all."

6703169,RichA$1970,2022-12-25 02:28:00,1159,Well at least there should not be any thin ice for those brave ice fisherman. Hope everyone enjoys their Christmas and it would be funny to hear on any fishing gifts that loved ones gave that “meant well” but probably never get packed on a trip
6703181,sheepman,2022-12-25 06:25:00,98,Merry Christmas John!
