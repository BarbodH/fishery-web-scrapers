6703153,kona77,2022-12-24 16:56:00,236,"We also sometimes have an odd number of guys on our trip so we may have someone fish solo vs. having 3 guys in a boat. Usually the solo boat is in the same area. On occasion someone from our group will go out solo. Did that last year a couple of nights by a real ""Hot"" spot that was 5 minutes from the cabin. One of those fish on every cast type spots, especially just before dark."
6703319,1100 Remington Man,2022-12-26 12:10:00,73,I fly as a Corporate Pilot and have Flown to Kenora for about 15 years in a row and I use to rent a boat and go out by myself solo on LOW with out a GPS just took a compass and lake map. Went as far as I could with a 25hp boat and 6 gallons of Gas. All Solo Largest Walleye 28 inches Northers mid 40's and I never keep any fish as I was staying at in a Hotel. Just all catch and release. I just looked at Map the night before for places for Walleye to try in the am and where for Pike in the afternoon. I did take a portable Laurence flasher depth finder. Never had a problem ! Never used live bait.
6702661,jabecker,2022-12-21 18:02:00,118,"I fish by myself in the Madison Wi area. When we go to Canada I go out about 6 am and fish until 10 I usually scout out new areas when I am alone. I am primarily looking for bigger fish to put my family on when we go out later on. If I dont find bigger fish, but find a numbers spot that morning we will fish there to have a change of scenery. I have fished this lake for 40 years and i still havnt covered most of it. Part of my solo fishing is the enjoyment of seeing the smiles on the faces of my family when they reel in a large Walleye"
6702673,7 Mag,2022-12-21 18:56:00,1887,"I'm pretty much the same way, most of my fishing is solo including NWO but my wife does go to Minnesota with me every spring and she enjoys it, but she's not to keen on multiple trips per year so I go by myself."
6702695,Hook_settr,2022-12-22 06:19:00,127,"My wife has come along and enjoyed the trips I’ve made to Leech Lake the last two years. She will get out on the water with me for a few hours each day if the weather is good. Otherwise she just likes to hang out at the cabin and decompress. She has no interest in extending the truck ride to get to Canada. Honestly, if she doesn’t want to be there then I don’t want her there. I don’t want to be thinking about if she’s having a good time or not while I’m on the water."
6702747,7 Mag,2022-12-22 10:50:00,1887,Sent you a PM
6702779,jambi,2022-12-22 13:50:00,504,Love fishing solo. Always nearby another boat never go to far alone. Best days are solo sometimes.
6702853,rebelrn2001,2022-12-23 07:52:00,1563,I don’t mind fishing alone at all. We have lots to talk about.
6702863,prov1800,2022-12-23 08:27:00,5010,"Usually when I do go out solo it's for muskie with maybe 10 minutes of walleye fishing for a supper.Its always nice to have someone along to net the muskies but nothing better than having to do it alone.I do tend to talk to myself and ask myself questions.Always get great advice.lol.My highlight last season was catching my 54"" muskie on a solo outing.Trying to get her in the net was a real challenge.It took me 5 attempts to finally land her.Even the mid 40"" fish are challenging and I highly recommend giving that a go."
6702869,Eckohlt,2022-12-23 08:38:00,3685,Gonna be awhile before we put on sawed off pants!
6702877,prov1800,2022-12-23 08:51:00,5010,"Unfortunately your right.Have traded my shorts in for bibs.lol.Thats OK to.Looking forward to the few months of ice fishing and as it goes weather gets better and fishing on the last ice in April is just awesome, but will look forward to ice out coming to,that's still my favorite season."
6702997,Larry S,2022-12-23 17:08:00,665,"On several outpost trips when someone has had to bow out due to health or other problems One person could have fished 3 to a boat, but decided to fish by themselves. We will then go out in a group and have radio's in each boat. Usually keep in close proximity of each other so we have had no problems Larry S"
6702557,bthomas3333,2022-12-21 08:19:00,465,"Same here. I started fishing alone in the states at 8 in row boats. When I was able to take boater safety classes I was able to switch to motorized boats ~12. On the flyin outposts I was usually the only one getting up at sunrise ~5a. Solo isnt an issue if you tell folks you are going out and approximately where. Then be smart about the weather, but like several have said the sunrise, quiet, and good fishing for oversized walleyes early is def worth the wake up call.B-"
6702567,guidedfishing,2022-12-21 09:00:00,531,"Most mornings I am the early riser and I will go out and fish for Lake Trout for a few hours by myself. A little pleasant solitude. Although I have to admit most fishing is best when shared, but a little time to fish and reflect by yourself is always good for the soul.Fishing around home is often solo, though the wife is tagging along more and more the last couple years."
6702573,valley366,2022-12-21 09:22:00,193,"Most trips these days is just my son and I and no solo for us these days. When I did trips with larger groups we always had 2 to a boat and very rarely fished one guy to a boat and when we did was normally in the vicinity of other boats. Even with 2 per boat we stayed in the vicinity of other boats at least through lunch. Afternoons we went in various directions but always had a planned time to be back at camp.Couple years ago the camp we were at had a guy in a group go out solo one afternoon. No inclement weather and was a moderate wind as I recall. He didn't show up for dinner that night. A group started search the lake just before dusk. They found the boat within a couple miles of camp. Next day OPD was there with boats, planes and choppers. They did locate the body a few days later.Of note it was decent weather and evidently something happened. I don't believe he was wearing a life jacket either. So if you do it be safe and wear your life jacket. I really don't understand with the amount of money people spend on trips why they don't purchase a comfortable jacket. We personally use inflatables and if you watch sales you can get a comfortable one for under $100. We don't even realize it is on most times. Life jackets are on at all times on our Canada trips. Also on in the states most of the time too, especially when water is cold."
6702579,Hook_settr,2022-12-21 10:00:00,127,"I fish by myself here in Iowa all the time. Absolutely love it. There is a handful of guys that I don’t mind fishing with but as a general rule I don’t like to fish with people I don’t know. I tend to catch more fish when I’m by myself because I can do what I want, when I want, where I want to and not have to worry if my fishing partner agrees. Sometimes I get a little schizoid and try multiple techniques over a short period of time. Nobody complains when I’m by myself. I dream of making a trip to NWO by myself for a week but I can’t get the wife to sign off on that. She’s afraid something will happen to me. Same thing could happen when her and I go on a trip and she stays in the cabin but she doesn’t see it that way. Maybe some day I will wear her down. &#x1f602;"
6702583,N_of_Quibell,2022-12-21 10:29:00,151,"Every spring immediately after iceout I take a week-long solo trip to the VB area for lake trout. Most of the time, I'm the only boat on the water. I know it's dangerous, but I love it. You do what you can, and hope nothing too bad happens. I wear a CG type III life jacket, which looks bulky but isn't bad, and doesn't impede my row tolling of my Grumman sportboat. I also wear a semidry suit, and take my Garmin Inreach. So far, so good. I have some fabulous memories...."
6702597,prov1800,2022-12-21 11:27:00,5010,Well your defiantly not on the lake I fish cause I don't see anyone either.
6702619,N_of_Quibell,2022-12-21 13:28:00,151,"As I'm sure you know, the VB area is blessed with numerous lake trout lakes. Part of the fun for me is trying new spots, so I often fish a new lake every day. Using a sportboat prevents me from hitting the bigger lakes, but on the other hand car-topping it allows me to get back into little lakes that might not appeal to everyone."
6702627,prov1800,2022-12-21 13:41:00,5010,Sounds like fun and yes there are many lakes to try.have you ever fished the stocked lakes on hwy 17 west of VB.
6702645,N_of_Quibell,2022-12-21 17:04:00,151,"Yep - I recall a post of yours from late last winter about ice fishing George Lk for spake so I gave it a try this spring. I busted my gut to catch what must have been the world's skinniest spake. Boat access to George is very poor, plus it was a really windy day. Anneater Lk nearby used to be good for me for brook trout, but not so much recently. Word I heard is it gets a lot of ice fishing pressure? Never tried Dixie, but heard it too has a lot of ice fishing pressure."
6702653,prov1800,2022-12-21 17:15:00,5010,Have only fished George on the ice and can be very good.some lakes along 17 get fished but not that much.But there are many along the Gordon Lake
6702439,NM_Trout,2022-12-20 12:47:00,1094,"Last trip with my daughter, she got a little motion sickness on a rough day, so I dropped her off at camp, and I went back out. I promised to wear my PFD the entire time, make sure I wore the kill switch lanyard, and I checked in with her by radio at the top of the hour. In all honesty, it was kinda nice for both of us to have a short break from the previous 100+ hours we had been together nonstop. I think for future trips, I may plan to do a little of this throughout the trip. Our favorite lake is small enough that a FRS radio covers most of it. I suspect that we would never split up for late evening fishing, but during the day, especially during good weather, it might give us a little bit of a break. Plus, with two or more boats on the water, we can scout for the day a lot faster. I frequently fish by myself in my boats solo, but I recognize that there is a bit more of a risk for serious issues at an outpost. Does your group ever split up, or do you always keep 2+ folks in a boat?"
6702445,JAY221,2022-12-20 13:11:00,877,"When its only the wife and I up there I go out by myself before 6 in the morning and come back in at 10.Then she will go back out with me after I get something quick to eat. I tell her if I'm not back by 10:30 you can come looking for me. I spend a lot of time looking for new to us spots. Later, Jay"
6702453,prov1800,2022-12-20 14:04:00,5010,"I normally don't get to fish alone.Either I have guests,my wife or a buddy along.But the 2 covid years and my wife was still working I had the time of my life on my solo trips.Not only being solo but not a boat on any lakes I fished either.Fall of 21 with some fisherman coming back in Aug and then this summer of 22 I realized how lucky I was to have been able to do that with 22 being so busy."
6702457,Eckohlt,2022-12-20 14:16:00,3685,"Solo on countless trips in Ontario,hard water n soft,not a care in the world,just fish n enjoy."
6702463,stumcfar,2022-12-20 14:36:00,451,"Usually 2 to a boat. I went out alone last year when my boating partner for the day became ill. I definitely wear a lifejacket, but certainly don't mind fishing by myself."
6702465,Mojo-NC,2022-12-20 14:38:00,1929,"We have always gone out with at least 2 people per boat on all of our Canada fishing trips, not just fly-in or outpost trips. Our lodge owner was hesitant to even allow my son and I to fish an outpost lake one year when we were the only boat fishing that day. She always prefers two boats going out in case something happens to one boat. Granted we had to drive 50 kilometers, park in a remote off-road area, and then hike about 1/4 mile through a bear and mosquito infested jungle just to get to the boat. She made us promise to leave the lake by 4:00 PM that day so that we would be back to camp before dark. On our last fly-in trip two of us got stranded out on the lake. We were lucky that day because I was wearing a bright yellow sweatshirt under my raincoat. I took it off and waved it on the boat paddle until our other guys finally saw us. Otherwise, who knows how long we might have been stranded out there on the water. Mike Borger posted a good story about getting stranded out on a remote lake and having to paddle for hours to get back to camp using a makeshift paddle. You can't be too careful out there. On the other hand, going out alone for a few hours would not be a problem as long as you told the others where you were going and when you expected to be back. Then they would know to come after you in the event that you don't come back. At home I do not hesitate at all to go fishing alone, but I have cell phone reception, a trolling motor in case the outboard fails, and usually enough beers to keep me company for a few hours. There are also usually homes on the lake in the event of a true emergency where additional help is necessary."
6702507,RichA$1970,2022-12-20 21:35:00,1159,"I usually fish the early mornings from 6-9 by myself as the rest have gotten older and more interested in breakfast and taking it easy. I love it as it lets me Chuck spoons into weed beds for pike, try different things & areas and be in my own agenda. If the weathers bad then I’ll stay back but having a lake to yourself is priceless"
6702529,kswalleyer,2022-12-21 05:32:00,1651,"I was soloing at 14 on some very big outpost waters....i like the solitude and ability to really focus...by then I had a lot of experience. My dad liked to go in early and late, I liked to be out all day. that was also at a time when kids left in the morning and came back at night. I did let everyone know where I was going."
6702549,prov1800,2022-12-21 07:26:00,5010,Nothing like a calm morning and heading east seeing the sun come up.
6702555,Eckohlt,2022-12-21 08:01:00,3685,"Some of the best sunsets n sunrises occur on Ontario lakes,at least for me anyways."
