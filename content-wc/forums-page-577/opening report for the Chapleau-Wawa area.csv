Even though our cabins are full only a few people braved the cold windy tempeatures. Most of the guys stayed at bay and watched Nascar and hockey games. personaly i like to watch Nascar. My parents went out fishing last night for about 45 minutes and boated 8 fish. They had a blast. As for the guys that did go out many of the walleye were in the 20 inch range but we havent broke the 30 inch range yet, minnows with a white 1/8 oz. jig have been working well.(typical opening week) The pike fishing has been good. 8 pike over 30 inches and the biggest being over 37 inches 5 of diamonds have been hot. Smallmouth have been large this year with only a few being under 17 inches. Most of the smallmouth have been caught on large minnows on a plain hook and a bobber about 2 - 4 feet deep As I write this report the winds are calming the temperatures are rising and their isn't a boat at our docks. The fish will be frying by noon. Normal guys odd guya good groupSchool is important but fishing feeds the soul - youngcanadianguideIf anybody wants any information about the Chapleau/Wawa area I can help them out."

We would like some heavy action, not so much size, pike smallies, walleye, pearch, do not care, as long as there is some steady action.I will be looking for your reports leading up to our trip!Burt"

1108273,youngcanadianguide,2009-05-26 17:38:00,60,"Hey Bert,Sorry about not getting back to you. I've been really busy guiding guests. I checked with a few people about Wabatongushi. Personally, I have never fished this lake because my family and I own and operate a hunting and fishing camp. What I have figured out is that Wabatongushi Lake is very similar to our lake. Five of diamonds and orange hammered copper are very good spoons. For floating rapalas, the best size is size 9 and the best colors are gold Fi red, It is orange, gold and white. Another is the famous fire tiger. Jigs with double tails, any color with glitter with 3/8 oz. jig head. For walleye, fishing with a rockrunner made by Northland (they look like a bottom bouncer), pulling a Little Joe red devil spinner supreme (like a crawler harness),will work great. You can use leeches, minnows, or crawlers. Have your sons cast anything we mentioned above (excluding the crawler harness) while you pull a spoon or the crawler harness we talked about. Be sure to hit all down trees, beaver huts and any rock structure off the shore line. This works very well for us on our lakes. Some of our younger guests like your sons have gotten tired of catching fish after fish. We fish for pike and bass during the day and go for the walleye during the evening. I hope this will help you and your sons catch fish and have fun. Remember to let me how you did. Remember to take your kids fishing when their young becuase they will take you fishing when you are old.-Youngcanadianguide"
