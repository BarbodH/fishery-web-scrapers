The cabins, hospitality and over all experience was delightful. The fishing was very good too.We found our best luck on the east side of the Big Island. The Ghost Narrows and around the Mantiou Creek river entrance too.Have you been south of Manitou Pt? What about Deer Island and further North into McKenzie Bay?Let me know how your stay was at Fishermans Cove?Thanks,"
