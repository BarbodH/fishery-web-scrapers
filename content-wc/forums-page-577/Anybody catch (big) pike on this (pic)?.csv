You don't have to turn it into a key-chain or throw it in the garbage. It's still very useful. Nothing gets a big monster pike PO'ed more than watching another fish trying to eat. Northern Pike are extremely competitive and like to assert their dominance in the food chain. When a pike sees a fish chasing another fish, it's time for lunch. With this in mind, take the hooks off your broken Rapala. Then attached a black steel leader. Then attach another leader to the back of the Rapala with a spring-slip-ring. Then attach your DareDevil or what ever you want to use. This rig is another way of triggering that animal feeding instinct. It's an old Muskie fishing trick."
1105713,Bigfishhunter,2009-05-17 16:33:00,803,"Yep, this is an old trick that definitely works. I have caught some decent size fish doing this. High 30"" fish. I am sure that it is only a right time right place thing for the bigger girls. I know they would hit on this."
1105715,pegasis0066,2009-05-17 16:45:00,64,I would be tempted to leave a hook in the rapala - would that be wrong?
1105716,Hawker,2009-05-17 17:15:00,3967,"Oooooooooooooh that looks interesting! Had thoughts about maybe leaving a hook on the rapala too but I can see tangle city written all over that on a cast. Now,,,,,,,,,, maybe if you were trolling though??????????? Hmmmmmmmmmmm"
1105733,reconssd,2009-05-17 18:45:00,147,"Great idea. No doubt this would put fish in the boat. I wouldn't use a hook on the bait purely for the reason of tangles or potential nicks in the leader. However, trolling this combo could be deadly. I am going to use this and will post any success with pictures. Thanks for sharing."
1105840,pegasis0066,2009-05-18 07:48:00,64,"I hadn't thought about casting tangles with a hook on the rapala, but that would likely be a problem."
1106267,pegasis0066,2009-05-19 14:17:00,64,"I tried to rig this set-up, but my tired old eyes and fat fingers are preventing me from getting the leader on the back of the rapala - that split ring is so small. I am still a novice angler. What kind of tackle would make this job easier? Do they make double cross lock snaps?"
1107459,stevensinks,2009-05-23 10:34:00,330,"For the past several years I have been using the same kind of rig when fishing here at home for white bass when they are on top after shad, only I use a popper in front. Ill have to try it with a swim bait when Im fishing Red Lake in July."
1107464,Juls,2009-05-23 11:11:00,13414,"Get yourself a ""split ring pliers"". It's made specifically for that job. It won't matter how fat your fingers are. These pliers have a ""tooth"" on one side that goes between the coils to open them up for you.Juls"
1107499,pegasis0066,2009-05-23 16:16:00,64,"Thanks - I started the job of rigging a few of these, but I had to put on larger split rigs that the eyes and fat fingers could work with. I will look for some split ring pliers."
