1108301,Obabikon,2009-05-26 19:06:00,2370,It's gotta be at least a foot and a half above the maps.
1108303,BB3,2009-05-26 19:09:00,48,So motoring into obabikon is no problem?
1108328,Bill Krejca,2009-05-26 20:30:00,6107,It looks to be something over a foot higher than what it was last Sep. See http://www.lwcb.ca/pdf/lakeofthewood...2009.05.26.pdf Bill Krejca
1108351,Fireman13,2009-05-26 21:22:00,9,just back from Morson area. Water a foot higher than last fall when it was no problem getting through. Lots of current but shouldn't be a problem. Fishing was incredible!
1108357,Obabikon,2009-05-26 21:35:00,2370,no problem at all getting into Obabikon.
