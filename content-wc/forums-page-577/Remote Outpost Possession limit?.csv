1107511,JinxCanada,2009-05-23 17:46:00,1306,"no. if they have reasonable grounds to believe that an offence has been committed they do not require a warrant... each agency has it's own special circumstances where they can do things you might be be aware of or are different than your local coppers....just be aware if they say they can enter your home, they WILL enter, and if you try to stop them you WILL go to jail for obstruction or hinderance. but...do as you will.i swear i hear this stuff all the time. Americans think we can't frisk search you without cause, we can (at the border) but the police can not. We can strip search you, have you taken to the hospital for a body cavity or xray etc, or keep you until you pass your stool which we can inspect if we believe you have secreted goods on or about your person WITHOUT A WARRANT. the CBSA (Customs) is the only agency who can do this. but trust me when i tell you we are well within our rights. and btw...we can do this all without ever arresting you or laying any charges. just be aware laws are not all the same as they are in teh USA."
1107513,teddi,2009-05-23 17:55:00,349,Right on
1107517,JinxCanada,2009-05-23 18:18:00,1306,"you are right about the local police search powers...however, i strongly suggest you read R. vs Simmons (regarding section 8 of the Charter) to learn what the laws are and how you have a diminshed expectation of privacy at the border (meaning we can search you, your car, your bags, your purse, your person, your pockets, frisk search you, strip search you, have you internally searched etc) without warrant. you also might want to read the Customs Act."
1107522,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-05-23 18:45:00,138,"Jinx I don't want to get in a pi**ing contest over this but, Boo was talking about searching private residence not a alien requesting entrants into your country. I find it hard to believe that a provincial government can write a law giving their law enforcement officers (MNR) the right to violate the federal Constitution of Canada. Quote: Originally Posted by JinxCanadajust be aware if they say they can enter your home, they WILL enter, and if you try to stop them you WILL go to jail for obstruction or hinderance. but...do as you willI agree with you that if they want to enter your residence let them. But, I believe that all evidence gained will be inadmissible.Quote: Originally Posted by JinxCanadano. if they have reasonable grounds to believe that an offence has been committed they do not require a warrant...Once again I agree with you. The key here is ""reasonable grounds""Quote: Originally Posted by JinxCanada just be aware laws are not all the same as they are in teh USA.This is the only reason I stepped into this. I'm not trying to ""get away"" with something. I just want to know my rights. I don't think it serves anybody to have people think that Canada doesn't have basic protection for citizens and guests. I have nothing but respect for you and the job you do. Every time I have crossed the boarder I have been treated fairly and politely. Thank you for your work keeping both sides of the border safe. Lets talk about fishing BTW: My tag line is a joke, I've never been to prison."
1107541,JinxCanada,2009-05-23 20:04:00,1306,"thanks for the praise. we'll just let it go. i know the laws (most anyway) in Canada, and they do differ greatly from the USA...and from province to province...and again the key is ""reasonable grounds to suspect an offence...etc"" to bypass the need for a warrant. In the case of MNR, it is just enough for them to suspect you have illegally caught fish. That's it. anyways, back to our regularily scheduled program. FISHING!"
1107544,Guest,2009-05-23 20:51:00,0,What if the person is on soverign native land? IE: Mahkwa. I don't think the MNR can enter upon those lands and conduct a search of a residence can they? I hate to beat a dead horse but was just wondering.
1107664,KS TrophyHunter,2009-05-24 11:15:00,10,"Jinx,Don't think you boys are the only ones who have far reaching wildlife or border laws. I can't speak for any other States, but here in Kansas (and Oklahoma), Game Rangers do not need a warrant to search vehicles or homes. And, quite frankly, I would a lot rather face a Canadian border guard than a US. You want to talk about tough game laws, try crossing a Kansas Game Ranger in deer season. Non-residents caught illegal are arrested, sent to jail and then to court. NOT THAT I HAVE EVER FACED ANY AUTHORITIES HERE IN KANSAS OR CANADA AS I AM ALWAYS LEGAL. Personally if you are not playing by the rules it cheapens the whole experience."
1107361,JinxCanada,2009-05-22 19:22:00,1306,"guys you are confused i think. it is not ""2 per day"" it is 2 in your possession, period and 5/6 depending if you have a full licence. there is no such thing as a ""PER DAY"" limit.and btw...just cause/if you don't get checked at the lake you are on, dont' think you won't get checked on your way out of Canada...we do joint forces projects all the time, at almost every port of entry/exit with the MNR and Evironment Canada Wildlife Enforcement checking all vehicles, coolers, boats, etc. just don't break the law here and you'll be welcome anytime...break the law and they can and will throw the book at you."
1107375,KS TrophyHunter,2009-05-22 20:01:00,10,"Not that I would, cause quite frankly walleye is only slightly better than tilapia, but if I was to eat 2 for lunch and 2 for dinner, how the heck are they going to know??? Is there a poo check for specific fish DNA?"
1107406,JAY221,2009-05-23 06:11:00,877,"They can & do come into camps & check all the refigerator/freezers. Then when you pull up to the dock all they have to do is match you to a cabin with what you have in your ""possession"" in the boat. Just be legal & you won't have any problem. Oh, and if they watched you doing shore lunch those will be in the total. Later, Jay"
1107469,evy TN,2009-05-23 11:46:00,15,"Thanks for all the info. We'll have to stay closer at together lunch time. The fish don't usually make it back to the cabin except once due to rain. We dont need more than 2 for lunch anyway, we're usually a little under the limit, just have to keep one boat from having too many. Thanks again"
1107476,Guest,2009-05-23 12:24:00,0,This probably wouldn't work if you stay at a resort or camp but we have a private cabin. MNR needs your permission to enter a private residence and search. They will phrase their request as a demand but you have the right to refuse.
1107495,JinxCanada,2009-05-23 15:18:00,1306,BAHAHAHAH you are dead wrong. they can search with or without a warrant. they need NO ONES permission dude. get your head screwed no straight.
1107497,JinxCanada,2009-05-23 15:22:00,1306,"no, they will tell you, and if you refuse you will be arrested for obstruction of justice. do not give out bad legal advice please....at least until you know what you are talking about."
1107504,Guest,2009-05-23 16:48:00,0,"These are your laws that you have little knowledge of not American laws. You can not enter someones property without 1. their permission 2. Reasonable cause 3. or a warrant. Do you want me to sight specific cases? Section Eight of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides everyone in Canada with protection against unreasonable search and seizure. This Charter right provides Canadians with their primary source of constitutionally enforced privacy rights against unreasonable intrusion from the state. Typically, this protects personal information that can be obtained through searching someone in pat-down, entering someone's property or surveillance. Examples where police do not require a search warrant: -The police are looking for a missing woman and knock on your door as part of a neighborhood canvass. Visible over your shoulder, lying on the floor, is a woman. -During a traffic stop, a strong odor of marijuana is wafting from your car -A fleeing suspect runs into a home -There is an immediate danger to life or property if they are not permitted to conduct the search (such as a house on fire). Notes: -Unrelated evidence turned up while conducting a legal search is admissible. For example, if the police enter that home on fire looking for victims and find your grow-op, that evidence is admissible. -A mere refusal to consent to a search cannot be used to help establish probable cause. For example, if a police officer asks you to if he may look in your trunk, saying ""no"" does not, as a matter of law, give him probable cause to suspect you're hiding something. Without other grounds, he cannot search the trunk."
1107507,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-05-23 17:16:00,138,So Jinx you can storm into someone residence without reasonable cause or a warrant? I guess my opinion of Canadian law was a little high. Sounds like something you would find in a third world dictatorship.
1107509,JinxCanada,2009-05-23 17:42:00,1306,"first off MNR are NOT the police. they have special authority to search if they believe an offence has been/is about to be, or will be committed ie/ poaching as you will...the police are restricted in much different ways. so...if the MNR believe you have an illegal catch/amount of fish in your home they MAY enter without a warrant."
1105193,evy TN,2009-05-15 08:18:00,15,"I've been to a remote outpost the last couple years in NW Ontario. On one of our days we eat a shore lunch and a shore supper. I was just wondering, with all the talk about conservation officers landing on outpost lakes, I'm guessing this is a violation beeing that a conservation license is good for 2 fish a day. Also when lunch time rolls around someone usually just says lets start keeping them for lunch. We usually just start keeping fish til we get to about 2 fish each we keep in touch with radios but we may have a boat or 2 out fishing for pike so we may have all the fish for shore lunch in 2 boats. I dont believe conservation officers would take to kindly to this. I guess we're not as remote as we thought. I dont see it as breaking the law we are fishing as a party and when we get to shore lunch it all works out."
1105209,cast_and_blast,2009-05-15 09:19:00,1098,"If you are keeping (consumed or not) more than 2 fish per day per person you would be in violation. Not sure on the ""party fishing"" - consult the regs for that one. Good luck! Scott"
1105219,JAY221,2009-05-15 09:41:00,877,"Anything over two a day will become very expensive if caught! Later, Jay"
1105229,jigman 2003,2009-05-15 10:07:00,981,"If one boat has enough fish for 3 guys and only 2 guys in the boat, you'll be screwed. If you eat two fish each for lunch and two fish each for supper, you'll be screwed. When the OPP and MNR spend the money on fuel to fly those turbo Otters and Beavers, they aren't screwing around. Any ticketable offense is pretty much a guaranteed ticket."
1105235,Guest,2009-05-15 10:16:00,0,"To add to cast & blast......The possession limit is per person, not per party. Having those ""extras"" in the boat could get you a ticket. (In all the times I have been checked my guess is you ""would"" get a ticket. Have always been treated professionally, but they have a job to do and they do it.) Just an idea....not a good one but an idea...right before they start counting your fish you could always try to win them over by saying ....""hey we knew you'd be comin by so we caught a couple of extras to cook for you,......you don't mind a little bacon beans do ya? You want water, can of soda or a bottle of beer ( i know see the drinkin in the boat post) with your shorelunch?"" If you try that let us know how that worked. I asked a couple of them once if they ever got a day off, one said sure do! I said what day this week...he answered ""GUESS"" lol.... he actually cracked a smile on that one. Enjoy everday fishin like it's you last, you never know what tomorrow will bring. Wallace"
1105236,Flip Silverlake,2009-05-15 10:20:00,645,If all you get is a ticket consider youself very lucky. I have seen where they took everything that was related to the trip away to be auctioned off and then would not permit the violator back into the country for something like 5 years. They let them keep the clothes they were wearing and enough money to get a bus ticket to the border. In this case the folks that got caught were like 4 times the limit on Walleye and were keeping Bass in June. The MNR is serious on preserving that fishery up there.
1105336,Glenman12,2009-05-15 18:52:00,762,"and enough money to get a bus ticket to the border"" They took their cars?"
1105357,Flip Silverlake,2009-05-15 20:36:00,645,Eeeeeeeeeyup
1105361,Flip Silverlake,2009-05-15 20:56:00,645,"Conservation Officers  Conservation Officers enforce fisheries regulations in the Province of Ontario. They have powers of inspection, arrest, search and seizure under the various statutes they enforce, including the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act and the Fisheries Act. When carrying out their duties, Conservation Officers may do the following:  Stop and inspect a vehicle, boat or aircraft  Ask questions relevant to the inspection  Inspect buildings or other places  Require assistance to complete inspections  Enter onto private property to perform their duties  Search with a warrant  Search without a warrant in circumstances requiring immediate action  Seize items related to an offence  Arrest anyone the Conservation Officer believes has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offence."
1107359,Slick Willy,2009-05-22 19:11:00,36,You may not party fish. Each individual much catch their own limit. Any fish you consume counts as part of your daily possession limit.
