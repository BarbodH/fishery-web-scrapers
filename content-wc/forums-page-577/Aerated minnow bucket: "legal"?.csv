1108316,brwhite,2009-05-26 19:52:00,41,Will DNR have an issue with one of those small frabil minnow buckets with an aerator? I know live wells are a big no-no. I'd hate to have that confused as some method of storing live fish (though youd be challenged to squeeze a fillet-able fish in it.)

1108391,Guest,2009-05-27 06:03:00,0,Fished Lac Seul for past 12 years. Always keep minnows in live well. We are usually checked every year. They always ask about the live well but say OK when I tell them it's only minnows. Is this really illegal?
1108398,rebs,2009-05-27 06:49:00,7587,I buy minnows by the pound and keep them in a 100 gal bait tank in my garage. I take what I need when I go to the lake in my bait well in my boat. If I have minnows left I bring them back home and put them back in the 100 gal tank. I am not sure if this is legal or not because you are not supposed to transport minnows from the lake because of the VHS disease. I keep certificates on my bait that they are vhs free from the place I buy them.
