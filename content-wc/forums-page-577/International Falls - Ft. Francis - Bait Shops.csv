1108325,Steve of Madison,2009-05-26 20:24:00,230,"I order mine from Cabela's about 2 weeks before we leave. They come in bedding OK for Canada, in a container good for the trip and a cooler pack. They arrived in great shape in 2 days, just keep them cool and you should be good to go.I think you can also order a flat from Gander in Duluth MN and have it ready when you drive thru, at least that's what I was told. There is a bait shop on Rainy Lake far east end of Ear Falls, I think it's Rainy Lake Sports???? that's where I get licence and leeches on my way up, they had crawlers ready for pickup as well, a bit more $$$$."
1108327,Steve of Madison,2009-05-26 20:26:00,230,Rainy Lake Sports is in Ft Francis (sorry) not Ear falls.

1108432,alanb,2009-05-27 08:43:00,56,"Larry Mac is correct. Outdoorsman's does sell crawlers. We were just in the store two weeks ago. They are a bit hard to find as the store is tucked behind a gas station and liquor store on the west side of 3rd Ave. (Route 53), right before the traffic light at 3rd Ave. and 11th Street. I don't know if the the other fishing store a little closer to the border crossing next to the Chrysler dealer has crawlers (on your left, I think its at 3rd Ave. and 5th Street). Alanb"
