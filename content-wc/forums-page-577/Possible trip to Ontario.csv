A friend has just invited me to spend a week at his cabin on the St Lawrence. I have to apply for one of those Passport cards, and I'm hoping it will arrive before my trip in late June. I have a regular auto insurance card for my truck, will I need to bring my insurance policy for my boat along? I don't believe I'm allowed to bring any live bait to Canada, am I? Anything else to worry about, and no I don't have any criminal record or DUI's! Is there any reciprocal fishing license agreement with NY, or do you have to be dang shore of where you are on the river? Thanks, Ron"
