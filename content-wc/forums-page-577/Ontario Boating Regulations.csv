1102395,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-05-04 18:52:00,138,Are you saying they would try to extort money?
1102403,JAY221,2009-05-04 19:14:00,877,"Extort is pretty harsh. I believe they would just request it before you got to go home. I believe the fine for operating a boat under the influence is $600, that would realy hurt my feelings! Later, Jay"
1102422,fisherman 1,2009-05-04 20:32:00,39,"If you were to have liquor in your boat and are not traveling to or from a place of residence ie: campsite, lodge or home. You will be charged with liquor other than residence. It is illegal to do so. If you are having shore lunch, likely this is not your residence so it is illegal. Although if you have a cottage on the lake there is nothing to stop you from going back to your cottage and having lunch and a drink provided that when you go back out you are not impared.Fish on"
1103771,Guest,2009-05-10 06:54:00,0,"Jay221 you are wrong. There is nothing stopping you from having beer in the boat - it just can't be open. The law states that you can not have any open alcohol in a car, boat, on a snowmachine, ATV or any other motorized vehicle. They can not fine you for having 3 or 4 cans of beer in the boat or in a car - you are not doing any wrong when they are not open!"
1103811,JAY221,2009-05-10 10:59:00,877,"I don't see where I said you couldn't but in fact legally I don't think you can unless the vessel has sleeping quarters & a sink & it(the beer) is stowed away. At least thats the way I read it. Later, Jay"
1103822,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-05-10 11:52:00,138,The regulation you are referring to allows you to consume alcohol on houseboats and large boats while anchored. The statute that regulates the transport of alcohol is for all motor vehicles. The same rules apply for a boat or a car (no open containers) except for vessels with permanent sleep quarters and galley.
1108507,Guest,2009-05-27 13:42:00,0,Toom any rules for boating. Go to www.canadacrossbow.com for a better sport.
1108508,Guest,2009-05-27 13:43:00,0,Too many.
1108517,Guest,2009-05-27 14:13:00,0,"The person who owns up to the beer will be charged with liquor other than residence, the operator of the boat will be charged with care and control of a vehicle(boat) with alcohol on board or in reach of the operator. Two charges for one beer if someone other than the operator claims ownership of the beer. Best bet ...keep the beer at camp."
1097739,elway12,2009-04-16 16:57:00,335,Does anyone know where I could find the boat regulations/laws for boating in Ontario?
1097753,JayM5209,2009-04-16 18:26:00,1050,Start here - http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/faq/other.shtml.Then you can check this site - http://www.tc.gc.ca/marinesafety/deb...ck_visitor.htm.
1097868,Jimmy Jig,2009-04-17 08:51:00,1905,The laws for you are the same as your state..... They are different for locals.
1097884,teddi,2009-04-17 10:00:00,349,the laws are the same in ontario for every one as far as boating regulations go. you must have all the safety equipment and follow all the canadian rules.
1097889,elway12,2009-04-17 10:21:00,335,Thanks JayM5209. That's what I was looking for.
1098051,Jimmy Jig,2009-04-18 08:39:00,1905,"Sorry, but you are wrong on the regs.......What ever is legal in your US State is ok in Ontario."
1102327,elway12,2009-05-04 14:29:00,335,I looked up the above sites and could not find any type of answers to the following question. Can you have sealed containers of beer on your boat in Ontario? Where could I find the boating regulations listed such as the alcohol laws and other safety equipment regs.?
1102361,Jimmy Jig,2009-05-04 16:53:00,1905,"You can not have beer in the boat, period! Unless, you have a home on the lake and then you can transport it to the cabin. So I know people will go to all extremes to drink on the water but I would forget it.........."
1102367,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-05-04 17:04:00,138,"Sorry, but you are wrong on the regs.......You can have alcohol in the boat as long as it is unopened. For example taking a beer for your shore lunch. No DRINKING in the boat.""It is illegal to transport beverage alcohol in a motor vehicle, a motorized snow vehicle or a boat unless the beverage alcohol is in a container that is unopened and the seal unbroken, or unless the beverage alcohol is packaged in baggage that is fastened closed or is not otherwise readily available to anyone in the vehicle. In a boat, the beverage alcohol must be stored in a closed compartment. """
1102390,JAY221,2009-05-04 18:27:00,877,"Just make sure you have lots of cash on hand incase the officer doesn't agree with your understanding of the rules. Later, Jay"
