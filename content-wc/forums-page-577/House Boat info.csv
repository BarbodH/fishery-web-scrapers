1106579,rnnonmt,2009-05-20 14:03:00,992,"Hi KS,Your welcome on the previous info posted...In all the years I have been going I havent fished the SE section although I can say that as we are traveling through the SE section there are always fisherman in the shortcut north of Pelican Narrows, crooked rapids, Manitou rapids, and The Rags shortcut. I have some friends that launch their fishing boats near Deception Bay and travel NE to fish the ZIG Zag and Sen Bay areas that do fairly well. Ive never driven the houseboat through the zig zag before. As far as the houseboat being looted, we haven't had it happen to us before. We typically dont see anyone else the entire time we are up there. Do you have a map of Lac Seul? The areas I mentioned are fairly close to Hudson."
1107261,jfsh,2009-05-22 13:23:00,13,"Rented houseboats down south on Dale Hollow Lake. At one of the sites we beached at there were a couple of bold raccoons rummaging around the front deck of the boat even before it was completely dark. Not sure what if any issues exist up north but secure your stuff just in case. Otherwise, a great family vacation!"

563562,Guest,2007-02-23 14:48:00,0,"Yes you can have beer on the houseboat. Even when you are in transit. We had a warden stop by our houseboat one day to check our fish limits and we asked. It's ok unless you are doing something really stupid. Stupid may be a broad term, but keep to your senses and you'll be fine. I would suggest that the person at the helm don't drink. It's no different than driving a car. Tom"

563621,Guest,2007-02-23 20:42:00,0,My friends and I used Ontario Wilderness Houseboats for the past 8 years. The owner is a good man and will try and accommodate your needs. We used their largest boat the past few years to accommodate 6 men. Our group averaged between 6 and 8 men depending on everyones summer commitments. Their boats are clean and in good operating order. One generator comes with the boat. We brought an extra generator every year to make sure we were able to charge all the batteries in our fishing boats. If you have specific questions I would be more than happy to help you out.

1104853,rnnonmt,2009-05-13 20:41:00,992,"I know this post is pretty old but....We (my family and friends) have been going annualy to Lac Seul for 28 years. There were two times that we had not taken a houseboat and tried a base camp. The two times weren't bad times but definately not as good as the houseboat trips. One benefit of the houseboat is the privacy/remoteness of being away from other anglers. Typically we dont see another fishing boat for the entire time we are out there. Except for maybe the canadian authorities. (beware of the anonymous cb radio calls looking for houseboat # ---)LSFL has some very nice houseboats that Dave and Irene take very good care of. In the 28 years we have had one housboat die during the return trip back to Hudson. I cant remember if it was LSFL or SLFL. The owner at the time was Gary Hyslop.... I think he was endited for tax evasion. Thats a whole other story. Nonetheless the equipment from LSFL is very dependable.Driving the houseboat is not difficult but would recommend a driver/guide to take you to and from your location the first time you go. Driving the boat under full speed (7-9mph) is easy... its just a bit sloppy/slow to respond. Kinda like an early 70's lincoln continental on the highway (lots of steering correction to go straight). Beaching it is fairly easy if you have a straight run with alittle speed/power going (once you cut the power to idle you might as well throw out the steering wheel) but, I highly recommend prior to beaching the boat to have a guy hop in a little fishing boat and scout the area you want to park for rocks and stumps. You do not want to get the houseboat hung up. One time is all it takes and you will then forever send out a scout to check out the beach first. Amazingly enough four 16' alumicrafts will typically pull the houseboat off of whatever you are on. ( I saw it happen to someone else once!) When backing out of the beach move your little boats to either side of the houseboat first. If you forget to.... you probably wont be able to do 7-9mph anymore. When parking the boat find a nice cove, preferable sand with some beach area to walk. Tie off the rear ropes of the houseboat as wide apart as possible. This will keep the rear from swinging in the winds kick up. The front ropes go straight out. Keep in mind you may have to re-tie every couple days as the water level rises.As far as the bugs go.... they will get in the houseboat. Bring some mosquito coils and sleep with 9000 deet bug spray on. You will be fine. If you use the front screened in porch entrance as much as possible you will find you wont have as many skeeters inside. The first 25 years or so we always used the paper map navigation method while driving the houseboat. Just a couple years ago I purchased a Garmin GPS18 USB for $125. I also bought the digital map of Lac Seul for $50 from Trak. Worth every penny. The GPS antenna plugs into the usb port on my laptop. I do however still reference current paper maps for markers bouys etc.Drinking and boating? Not a good thing. I would have to research this one to be absolutely sure but I think that the houseboat is considered a motor vehicle while in transit which would mean no consuming. Once it is docked it is no longer considered a motor vehicle and consumption would be ok. In all the years I have never been stopped or pulled over (so to speak) but given the remoteness of the area and in the event an accident occured you could be hours away from medical help. ""CB radio back to civilization you say and get airlifted?"" The CB back to hudson base doesnt reach a little passed Tuk Bay so someone may have to relay your messageback to Hudson. Stay safe.... dont drink and drive.... and enjoy the cold ones when your done fishing for the day.Last years cost for the basic trip was about $900. 65 ft houseboat, 8 guys, 4 boats, gas etc. I have a excel spreadsheet that will calculate the basic for you. PM me if you want a copy.25 days to go to this years trip. this is also the first time for my 9 year old son. I'm not sure who is more excited! Take care and happy fishing"
1105932,KS TrophyHunter,2009-05-18 13:02:00,10,"Hey rnnonmt,Thanks for the good info. We are heading up in 30 days for our first houseboat trip. We would like to stay close to Hudson, we fish primarily for smallies and can see trailering over to Big V for a couple of days. Any thoughts on staying close and any suggested spots to beach? Ever here of any of the houseboats being ""pirated"" while you were out fishing. Would hate to come back and discover my post-fishing beer has been looted."
562791,RB,2007-01-15 12:18:00,32,I'm going to do something different this year on my trip to Lac Seul. We have been staying at a resort but this year I'm going to take a House Boat (Sioux Lookout Floating Lodges) and pull my boat behind. I was wondering if anyone had any good experiences or negatives with a House Boat trip. Any good advice for specific things that I need to pack? Anything positve or negative would be greatly appreciated. RB
563160,Guest,2007-02-02 15:00:00,0,"I'd use Lac Suel Floating Lodges, right next door to the outfit you're talking about, MUCH nicer House boats priced the same. You won't be disappointed once you're loading up on one of LSFL boats looking over at what you could've been on for the week. Screened in porches, ""cat"" walks that go completely around the houseboat are a few of the things you can see from the outside."
563165,Guest,2007-02-02 16:57:00,0,"Park the houseboat in a nice calm location. Might have a few more bugs, but it beats having the wind and waves pound your boat all day and night. Bring boat bumpers for securing your boat to the houseboat. Bring flushable baby wipes. There gentle on the backside and they don't plut the toilet. We bring and outdoor double burner cooker so we can cook outside the houseboat. They'll most likely have a grill outside as well. Other than that, just bring the basics. The less stuff piled in the houseboat the better. It's a great time. I go on LOTW every year and wouldn't stay at a resort ever again. It's nice being out on the lake all alone everynight having your fishing boat 20 feet away from you. Tom"
563167,gsmitty,2007-02-03 08:19:00,10,Parking the boat in a calm location is very important as previously mentioned. Make sure your boat bumpers are adequate size. Storms come up fast and if your boat is not secure with the right size bumpers it will get pounded against the house boat. This happened to our group several years ago. The wind shifted directly out of the East and kept us of the water for a day because it was so rough. We had to put several of the smaller fishing boats on the beach but mine was a bit bigger and we had a tough time tieing it up and securing it. We had gone on the houseboats for ten years and never had a problem and parked in a calm place but never had the wind shift like that. You will enjoy it!
563215,Guest,2007-02-05 22:23:00,0,"I have been using Sioux Lookout Floating Lodges for the last 9 years and we are very pleased with their boats. We had a brand new 68 footer last year. We have had screen porches in the past but did not use them. The cat walk around would be nice when bringing our fish to the back to clean. You do loose a little room with the cat walk but it might be worth it. We park our boat on a sand beach and beach all of our small boats. This way we don't have to worry about them banging around (might be easeir to tie up with a catwalk). The only issue with this is you do get sand in the boat. We just sweep up a lot. Another plus of this is you have plenty of area to walk around. Sometimes we even have a camp fire and down a couple cold ones. However you go, you will enjoy the houseboat experience. If you use a pilot, ask them to recommend some fishing spots near where you park. They are usually willing to share this information (especially if you feed them a good meal). Say hi to Steve and Rob!"

563526,Guest,2007-02-22 13:55:00,0,What is the final cost for a houseboat for a week. Have a group of 6 or 7 that want to go up. I know there are hidden costs in using a houseboat. I have sent both companies out of the east side of Lac Seul e-mails asking for approximate costs and neither have responded.
