1097707,Jimmy Jig,2009-04-16 14:22:00,1905,"I cross at IF every year. I have never been asked for a passport. Last year for the first time we carried birth certificates and they never ask to see them, just drivers liences. I have never been hassled at either crossing. If you are getting trouble it must be something you are doing. We used to cross at Burdette, before 502 was built and that Canadian guard did look in the car trunk and had me loosen the boat cover so he could look in the boat. That only happened one time, US has never looked at anything. Did get a passport card today, took 20 days from mailing in to arrival. Good Luck fishing........."
1097709,Obabikon,2009-04-16 14:27:00,2370,"Jimmy, You've been lucky to say the least. While 95% of the time, if you're polite, and have all your info ready when you pull up to the window... everything's fine. There is that 5%..."
1097756,danceswithwaves,2009-04-16 18:40:00,17,Definitely use Baudette. The Canadiens are always polite and friendly while the U.S. guards are a$$holes.
1097791,Tonyo,2009-04-16 21:14:00,212,We have used IF every year until our trip home last year when we tried the Baudette crossing. Baudette was very easy and fast but a little out of our way. I think we made up the difference in distance by not having to wait in a long line in IF on Saturday afternoon. The change was great from Vermillion Bay to Baudette. The roads are a little better than running 502 and there is a little more to look at too. Pick one and enjoy your week in Canada. Tonyo
1097812,JinxCanada,2009-04-16 23:10:00,1306,man i just love reading this stuff...you guys kill me.
1097815,alanb,2009-04-16 23:27:00,56,"Never had an issue crossing at IF on opening weekend. Always quick and simple going into Canada. Same coming back - US asks a few more questions, I had a little back and forth with the guard over the cigars left over in my humiditor last year (they weren't cubans - only had Cuba in the brand name e.g. La Gloria Cubana) but nothing that held us up. Heck, we got all our documents soaked is a little mishap and they let us come home. Be honest, respectful and know the rules on what you are allowed to bring back into the US and you won't have any problems. Remember, the border guards on both sides are just doing their job - your boss would expect you to do the same! Alan"
1097899,Mr.Hayoka,2009-04-17 10:50:00,4,"I have made many a trip thru the ""Gustopo"" check points...NEVER EVER will you know the whys or where fors for being picked out to checked.From being stripped searched one time and 'spread your cheeks', to having my plane x-rayed another time, completely!, to them down on creepers under my van !....having spent hours one time... to 'Have a nice trip"" the next time. There is only one way to go thru any of them and that is be polite and legal ,as they are doing their job just as we try to do ours no matter what it is at home..And the best part ! I dont blame them one bit.I like it when I see them doing their job..it gives me a good feeling..( on both sides of the bridge)..Do I like being held up..no but I have grown used to it.In June I shall go run the gaultlet again..."
1107727,cavey28,2009-05-24 17:53:00,1,"Crossed on friday at IF, no problem going in to Canada, ""small"" problem crossing back into the US... one of the guys was flaged as having a federal warrant for his arrest... they must have had license plate recognition software, the line was backed up a little, when we got to the front of the line they waved us into the far right side as if opening a new line... the custom's guy just dilly dallied around with us till they got everyone in position for the ""ambush"". It was interesting to say the least..... I never want to hear ""Sir, put the veh. in park, turn off the ignition, put your hands in the air and ""dont move""!"" .... I kind of suspected something was up when one guy popped up in front of us with his hand on his gun - gun half pulled out... they did not play around, --- I got a good look at the mill through the chain link fence as they had me spread eagle against it, while handcuffing my fishing partner....Just a case of mistaken ID, they ran a facial recognition on him and released him, and we were on our way with a good story! Just part of the job, no hard feelings - no one got shot and the hand cuff marks were gone by the next day...."
1097532,walleyestalker,2009-04-15 23:40:00,9,I have heard International Falls is like the iron Curtain and they check every passport. Anyone know a more relaxed Border crossing
1097547,Guest,2009-04-16 05:47:00,0,the one between syria and israel.this border crossing is fine...later
1097548,Guest,2009-04-16 05:55:00,0,Good one
1097587,Guest,2009-04-16 08:08:00,0,"You can't dodge it. If you have a problem get it fixed. I went thru the IF border crossing in Dec. and they drilled me. The Guard told me the last time I had crossed the border, and I said yes but it was over in North Dakota. He said True. Point is-- they are all connected. One crossing is not any easier than another. Good Luck B"
1097589,Obabikon,2009-04-16 08:22:00,2370,"Baudette is much easier... it does make a difference. The more traffic, the tougher the guards are... Now, if you have something on your record, that needs to be taken care of. However, if you're asking about the average time crossing, courtesy of guards, and overall ease... International Falls is a bad one. If you have the option to cross at Baudette, I would."
1097598,Bill Krejca,2009-04-16 08:52:00,6107,I second the Baudette crossing advice. Bill Krejca
1097625,srj,2009-04-16 09:50:00,971,"We had something new at the Baudette crossing on Tuesday--U.S. customs was stopping vehicles on the way into Canada. We were asked about guns, tobacco, alcohol and if we had more than $10,000 cash. Also peeked in a small cooler in the back seat. No big deal, took about a minute and we were on our way. I had never been stopped heading north by our customs before."
1097643,v-bay gord,2009-04-16 10:33:00,3168,"I had the same thing happen a couple winters ago in I. Falls. We were coming back from Mexico after flying out of Mpls. They were standing by the road by the US customs side and grilled us. They even asked us ""Why do you have passports?"". I had to bite my tongue.......I was thinking a smart-arsed reply might be ""So I can get into Iran easier"". I think they ask really stupid questions to either trip you up or to irritate you into frenzy so they can use their pepper spray on you."
1097662,Glenman12,2009-04-16 11:25:00,762,"a few years back while waiting in the line to cross into Canada the US guys, for whatever reason, brought a drug sniffing dog over...made us get out while he did his thing..that was weird.."
1097676,walleyestalker,2009-04-16 12:22:00,9,"Of course there all connected. But some are more polite, dont check every **** passport, and are much faster getting you across."
