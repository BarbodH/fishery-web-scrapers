1106413,crazydog,2009-05-19 22:40:00,12,"How do you fish durring the mayfly hatch,looking for suggestions on where to fish, bait types and time of day or any other advice on how to fish during the hatch?"
1106511,IaDave,2009-05-20 10:39:00,476,I have fished only once during a hatch and we caught it at the beginning. We didn't do anything different and the fishing was great for the first few days but it did seem like it slowed down at the end of the week. I'm no expert but I think if you catch it early the fish go on a feeding frenzy. Where are you going this year?
1106516,jigman 2003,2009-05-20 11:00:00,981,"I've fished it a few times. Some years it hasn't seemed to make a difference, some years it gets tough. One year on Ogoki Reservoir we hit a mayfly and some other type of aquatic nymph hatch. Fishing was tough. It was hot and calm. About the third day we started looking deeper (20'+) and began to mark ""bugs"" near the bottom. Started fishing deeper, always looked for bugs on the graph, went to small profile jigs and plastics in neutral tones and the fishing improved dramatically."

1106729,crazydog,2009-05-20 21:19:00,12,"Lac Seul 1st week of June, we hit the hatch afew years back and thefishing was real slow, so headed for deeper water and around islandsbut on a windy day on Lac Seul that is not always the friendliest fishing. Was looking for some baiting options , top water, divers, or something to attract them the same as the Mayfly larva or hatch."
1106786,LeeMB,2009-05-21 07:35:00,83,"Fish the mud where the bugs are emerging from. This may seem weird because you might be fishing 4' of water, in bright sun and heat. The walleye are very active, and will travel to where the bugs are. In my experiance they prefer to eat mayflies before they emerge in the nympth stage. I have seen them slurp them off the surface though."
1106811,jigman 2003,2009-05-21 08:46:00,981,"Yep, I've seen that a number of times. Sometimes the 'eyes will chase the larvae up from 25' or more. Kind of weird seeing them surfacing and taking bugs on top of deep water. I've tried throwing small Rapalas a number of times but haven't had much luck picking them off."
1106841,Guest,2009-05-21 09:43:00,0,"This does sound strange, but try fishing the mud where the hatch is happening or happened and switch to a pink jig with a minnow or crawler. Slow presentation is the key. There is a long reason why, but for now it works. Pink is the key. Enjoy."
1107193,Guest,2009-05-22 10:25:00,0,"I agree that pink is a good color in the hatch. Sometimes the hatch hasn't had an impact on our fishing, but it usually does. I have had luck going deeper or to another part of the lake that has colder water, warmer water, etc. - where the hatch isn't happening, but my best success catching fish in the hatch has been to switch to night crawlers. I like to use leeches, but when the hatch is on, I would suggest crawlers."
1107247,jigman 2003,2009-05-22 12:37:00,981,"One year the hatch was going on when we were at Pringle Lake. Upon dissecting some stomachs the larvae appeared to be a greenish/grayish color. Switched to using 2""-3"" pieces of plastic crawlers on a jig head. Worked like a charm. They didn't want any action to them, just a subtle up/down motion"
