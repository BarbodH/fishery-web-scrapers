548261,Guest,2005-05-23 21:00:00,0,Looking for some help. I am heading on a trip this weekend to Wabatongushi Lake in Northern Ontario for a little Walleye fishing. If anyone has fished this lake I would love some tips. Does anyone know water color up there? Certain Areas to fish? Colors? Baits? Presentations? Thanks so much!!

You will catch many good size walleye (17-22) - probably don't need anything other than jigs/minnows or twister tail this time of year. Pike fishing has to be great this time of year also. If you have an e-mail address I'll send you a map with some of my favorite walleye and pike spots on the lake....I'd love to hear how you do this wknd."
548289,Guest,2005-05-24 14:24:00,0,Forgot to add....water is typically clear. Red/Orange/Chartreuse/Yellow jigheads w/ a minnow...or twister tails with the same color.. When their hittin' it really doesn't seem to matter.
