Our group had a similar opener ~ 12 years ago right on the Birch Narrows sandbar- you look to be just south of Chamberlain in some of these photos. We had 7 over 30"" with the biggest spawned out female right at 34- very lethargic and resting on a 8' edge bordering the channel drop off. Other than the opener , our largest has been a 31 caught trolling a depth raider for musky! Well done- we're heading up there June 23-- my 29th straight year. best regards, JBP"

1108173,BenBeattie,2009-05-26 11:41:00,232,Nice guiding Colin!! It's been a good year for big fish so far.
1108252,IowaDave,2009-05-26 15:41:00,69,Any idea what that fish weighed?Great catch btw!!
1108260,Guest,2009-05-26 16:29:00,0,Thanks for the hard work - our group had a great time. You make the trip fun each and every time.
1107398,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-05-23 05:13:00,100,"I just thought I'd let everyone know that one of my guests caught and released a 33"" walleye yesterday on Lac Seul SE. I will posts the pics as soon as I find the time. This is the longest I've seen in over fifteen years of guiding, so YES they do still exist!So far opener has been great....many big girls caught and released, fish are just now coming off spawn!Have a great trip everyone, and keep the faith...they're out there!http://photobucket.com/thirtythreewalleye"
1107438,schick,2009-05-23 08:22:00,35,We are heading to Lac Seul tomorrow and fishing next week. Do you think the walleye will have moved to the mouths of the rivers into the main lake or will they still be in the upper waters? Last year we seemed to have been too early and the fish were not at the mouths of the rivers as they have been in the past.
1107510,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-05-23 17:44:00,138,"Colin, Great job to you and your guest. What do you think it weighed? Can't wait for the pictures."
1107529,joeman79,2009-05-23 19:11:00,417,Colin has a cool Muskie Video on youtube. Way to go Colin and thanks for the PM on where to fish on the southwest end of Lac Seul. Can't wait to see the pics. 70 days till Lac Seul for me.

1107577,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-05-24 05:35:00,100,"I tried to upload the pictures, but it keeps failing....gotta go to work, I'll try again tonight. Is there any easier way, or do I have to shrink File sizes first?"
1107578,Hot Runr Guy,2009-05-24 05:43:00,16062,"I find that uploading a .jpg file usually works better than a .bmp (bitmap), and the upload system seems to automatically re-size the file to fit. If you want to email it to me, I'll upload it for you. HRG[email protected]"
1107763,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-05-24 21:06:00,100,"Here's a link to the pics;http://photobucket.com/thirtythreewalleyeAnother good day today, many over the slot to 26"", and another 28"".Fishing may be a bit spotty for the next few days, they are now in post spawn transition. Found walleyes on regular shorelines and shallow bays today. Constant moving will prove great success!"
1107798,Catman59,2009-05-25 05:30:00,345,That is a beauty !!
1107800,Glenman12,2009-05-25 05:45:00,762,Just curious as to what the beauty was caught on
