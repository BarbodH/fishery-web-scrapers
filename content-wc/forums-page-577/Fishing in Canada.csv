Planning to go north of ranger lake and I am just wondering have the walleyes finished up spawning? I am told that this lake is a very deep cold lake. should I be fishing more of the shallow water/reefs? First time on this lake so I don't really know where to start, throwing jigs/minnows, trolling rapalas, tossing small spinners? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"
