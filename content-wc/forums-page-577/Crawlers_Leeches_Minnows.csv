We have to make a decision on what kind of live bait we will be taking up. From your experiences what would you say is the best bait for that time? Crawlers Leeches or Minnows? Out of the 3 i assume crawlers are the easiest to maintain. We will also be taking some gulp minnow/leech rubbers up with us just in case. Tks Gary"
1107739,lassh,2009-05-24 19:29:00,553,Crawlers are easiest to take and maintain. Both leeches and minnows work well but minnows are hard to keep alive and expensive. Leeches are at least $40 a pound. We go in June and just bring crawlers and gulp. By the way- how do you get the rubbers on the leeches?

We buy 120 dozen of minnows off of Mark. We take a nice air rator, and 2 floating minnow buckets.. When we get into our outpost, first thing we do is break up the minnows into all 3 containers.. WE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM, and we use ALL the minnows in a weeks trip..We also buy a flat of crawlers. There is a bait store rith before Temagami. We buy a flat , and a styrofoam minnow bucket. We just dump the crawlers in the bucket.. Works great!!!We also buy a pound of leeches at the same store..All 3 baits work great in those lakes.. We do not have much, if any lef over after a weeeks of fishing.. If we do, we give it to the next party, or just dump it out.. Our group figures it this way, WE ARE THERE TO FISH!!What out fitter are you going with in cochrane??"

1108053,Bakie,2009-05-26 05:59:00,22,"It is illegal to bring live minnows & leaches into Canada worms are also illegal if they are in dirt. it is also illegal to transport minnows, leaches & crawfish from one body of water to another because of the VHS virus man our MNR loves to screw it up for everybody here in Canada. It is also illegal to have more than 120 minnows per person, crays only 3 dozen not sure about the number of leaches but they haven't started regulating the number of Crawlers yet. Have a good one EH!!!"
