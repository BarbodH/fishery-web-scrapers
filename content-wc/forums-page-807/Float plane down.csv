539937,2 DOGS,2004-05-25 17:03:00,361,Would someone please post the cause of the accident when it's known. My sympathy to the families.
539939,Guest,2004-05-25 17:55:00,0,I knew the pilot from my previous years trip. Charles was a good guy and a good pilot. We were on our trip last week when we heard the news. I found a newspaper at the Thunder Bay airport with an initial report and they more than likely will have the follow up story. You can view it at www.chroniclejournal.com. As of this afteernoon there hasn't been a follow up story.
540303,Guest,2004-06-04 12:59:00,0,"Here is a follow-up article on the crash. Basically they don't know anything yet.http://www.chroniclejournal.com/story.shtml?id=22250 Crash puzzel coming together By Bryan Meadows - The Chronicle-Journal June 01, 2004 It may be some time before investigators determine the cause of a float plane crash that killed four people May 18 northwest of Sioux Lookout. We haven't ruled out anything yet, Transportation Safety Board spokesman Peter Hildebrand said yesterday. In these cases sometimes we don't (find a definite cause). There are no witnesses, no flight data recorders which can help investigators. What we do have is a badly damaged airplane, he said, adding that fittings from the wings and floats have been sent to TSB's Ottawa laboratory to be tested for metal failure. Investigators also took pictures of the plane on-site and the aircraft engine is back in the shop in Winnipeg for inspection, Hildebrand said. He said it may be a couple of months before all results are back and a preliminary report compiled. It's really a matter of looking at everything as a whole. Hildebrand said the TSB normally releases a final report about a year following a crash. Pilot Frederick Charles Illsley, 29, of Winnipeg, and passengers Kenneth Melvin Schremp, 49, of Edgerton, Wis.; Eric Dixon, 39, of Delaware, Ohio; and Aaron Thomas Rogahn, 26, of Kaukauna, Wis., died in the Dehavilland Beaver DHC-2 crash on Fawcett Lake, about 130 kilometres northwest of Sioux Lookout. The aircraft, owned by Pickerel Arm Camps, was found overturned and floating in the lake, away from an outpost cabin it had been flying to. Pickerel Arm's base camp is near Highway 72, south of Sioux Lookout on Minnitaki Lake."

540879,2 DOGS,2004-06-16 15:42:00,361,Has there been any more news on the cause of the crash?
540881,IaDave,2004-06-16 15:56:00,476,I talked with the guys who flew us out of Pickle Lake and they thought the lake was glassy which makes it hard to judge how close you are to the lake. They described it as like looking into a mirror.If you come in hard the front of the pontoons dig in and the boat will flip over. If that happened and with the water being so cold the guys probably did not have a chance-God rest their souls. Obviously this is all speculation. Believe me it was on my mind when we flew in.
540888,Guest,2004-06-16 18:55:00,0,"I have flown on these Beaver planes several times. Does anyone know the most common danger associated with these planes? I've often wondered if they can glide in if a motor stalled. Seemed like they are too heavy for that, but what do I know."
540911,Guest,2004-06-17 10:09:00,0,"Any thing with wings will glide in, thats what the shuttle does. Its all in the airspeed."

539880,Guest,2004-05-24 13:46:00,0,"Scares me a bit, since we will be flying out of Kenora to Lount Lake next week. Someone make me feel better about this...."
539881,Guest,2004-05-24 14:03:00,0,"I don't know if this will make you feel better or not but you have a significantly better chance of getting hurt/ killed in a car crash on the way up then on the flight. Sometimes things just happen and while unfortunate, you can live your life afraid of the unknown or you can enjoy chasing it. My condolences to the families/ friends of the fisherman."
539883,Guest,2004-05-24 14:22:00,0,"Very true. I have done several fly-in trips before, but none as a father. I'm sure you are correct when saying that the flights are much safer than the drive up from Iowa. My thoughts and prayers to those affected by this tragedy."
539886,Ivy,2004-05-24 14:40:00,556,Can't imagine the shock that the familes are going through. Fathers and husbands went on a fishing trip. No one thought they would not be coming back No good bye's. So many things left undone. To sad to think about. Ivy

539712,Le pickerel,2004-05-19 16:36:00,18,"I just heard on the radio that a Beaver float plane out of Sioux Lookout just went down 100 miles north of there on Fawcet Lake. No word on survivors but the OPP dive team was dispatched this afternoon to search for four people, the Canadian pilot and three American fishermen. Doesn't look good, like to believe there is still hope for those who were on board. I will keep you posted if I hear more Le pic"
539717,Guest,2004-05-19 19:46:00,0,"Here is the news release from the Toronto Star : KENORA - Four people, including three Americans, are believed dead following the crash of a float plane at Fawcett Lake about 110 kilometres north of Sioux Lookout, investigators said today. The names and hometowns of the victims haven't been released, but an official with the Transportation Safety Board in Winnipeg said three are from the United States. Peter Hildebrand said police divers hoped to recover the bodies this afternoon. A pilot and three passengers were on board. The crash late yesterday afternoon occurred about an hour after the Beaver float plane took off from Pickerel Arm Camp at Sioux Lookout, heading for Fawcett Lake, Sgt. Dean Barclay of Kenora OPP said. The victims were reportedly travelling to a lodge on the lake. An hour later, a second plane took off from the same camp. When the second plane arrived at the lake, the pilot didn't see the first plane, police said. He dropped off his passengers and returned to Sioux Lookout, where he contacted emergency personnel. A Canadian Forces search-and-rescue team travelled to Fawcett Lake from Winnipeg in a Hercules aircraft, a spokesman said. Rescuers searched the lake and shoreline from the air, the Kenora Miner and News reported. Around the same time, the passengers from the second plane took a boat out on the lake and located the downed Beaver."

Two of the fisherman killed in this crash work with the same company that my buddy does. Sometimes the world gets too small. May all of you who have read this post have a safe fishing trip.
539766,Le pickerel,2004-05-20 19:35:00,18,Further reports say that the plane was found overturned in the water. It is not clear whether it clipped some trees and crashed or overturned while taxiing. At the time of the accident there were scattered clouds and the wind was from the wouthwest at 18 kmh (about 11 mph). Two investigators from Transport Safety Board were on their way to the site. Nothing more to report so far. Le pic
