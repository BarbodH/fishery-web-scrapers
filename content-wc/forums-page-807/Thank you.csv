We seen two moose swimming across the lake my son was able to get off a few pic. The look on his face in just that one moment made the trip. The look on his face when he brought in his first Canada Walleye was a close second. The fishing was very good found most the fish in 8-12' of water, it looks like the fish are starting to move out to the reefs. The folks at the resort were very helpful and polite we felt like we were at home on our lake in MN. My fishing partner has been going to this resort for over 20 years and knows the lake very well. He had us on fish 5 min. after the first line hit the water, nothing like fresh Walley for shore lunch. I feel lucky to live in MN with all the lakes but the trip and time spent with my son in Canada was one I will remember for a long time. Thank you for your hospitality and the privilege to share your natural resources. Mike"
