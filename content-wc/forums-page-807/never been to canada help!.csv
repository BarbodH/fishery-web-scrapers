540517,MoWalleyeguy,2004-06-10 08:32:00,409,"I second Lake of the Woods and I also would recommend Witch Bay camp. Its a awesome drive in experience. This place is FIRST CLASS all the way. There web site is www.witchbay.com They will spoil you rotten and feed you better food then you will get anyplace else plus provide you with the best ""camp"" boats on the lake. 17'+ boat with 50hp motors, 2 fish finders, trolling motors, etc. Fishing is awesome up on the north eastern part of the lake where they are located and like Dave said, Musky fishing is incredible along with the Walleye fishing. Last year we saw Walleyes caught as big as 31"" (not me...darn it) but I caught several over 27"", along with BIG Pike and really nice Smallmouth Bass. Check them out!"
540518,Guest,2004-06-10 08:50:00,0,There are lots of great lakes Lac Seul is one If you are looking at it check out Evergreen Lodge. Pat and Gary are really nice and the cabins and boats are top notch. I know they allow RV camping as well. THey post on this site on occasion. Tell them you got the info from the guys in Cedar Rapids.
540520,Guest,2004-06-10 09:47:00,0,"Lac Seul is great. We stay at fisherman's Cove with no problems at all. However you best start looking soon because they book up real fast. Last year we were there in Sept. and they only had 2 cabins left for all weeks in June and July for this year. Bringing your own boat is not a problem, pretty safe harbor. We haul 20' fiberglass up there with no problems."
540537,Guest,2004-06-10 18:34:00,0,"We've been going up to Wabaskang lake in Perrault Falls the last few years and like it alot. I believe there's only about 6 camps on the lake so there's not alot of boat traffic and the fishing is great! Lake trout, smallies, walleye, jumbo perch, and pike. Highly recommended! At least 2 of the camps have camping facilities, Jim and Julie's, and Gawley's. So far we've stayed at Kingfisher and Tall Pines and have never had a problem."

540538,Mark R,2004-06-10 18:53:00,1538,Evergreen Lodge has a bring your own boat package and Fisherman's Cove doe not. I think Evergreen is less expensive if you bring your own boat

540567,Guest,2004-06-11 15:25:00,0,"Strange, we took our boats to Fishermans Cove last year and my cousins are on their way right now up their with their boats in tow. Many others there did also. I did get a funny feeling from Dan at Fishermans Cove...like he didn't like me at first but I guess he just has a strange sense of humor. Also, when you have a lodge on a lake EVERYONE wants to book, you can be a jerk and people will still be lining up for the most part. By the middle of the week, Dan and I got along ok (I was warned by my camp mates to be nice to him as he can make booking the next year difficult...so I did because they go every year)."

540614,Mark R,2004-06-11 18:52:00,1538,"When you brought your own boat did you pay more, less or the same as those that didn't? I called them once because friends of mine stay there every year. I could've brought my own boat but would pay the same as if I used theirs. I don't expect to have my arse kissed but I expect civil conversation."
539858,drh1175,2004-05-23 19:43:00,108,"I want to plan a trip to canada next year. I have a year to investigate. I have heard many good things about Lac Seul. Are there any other big lakes to try Where I can go and actually catch fish, fish alone,and travel is not an issue. I will not go to eagle. Also any resorts to recommend. Is there any rv camping available. Or should a cabin be rented. Also want to bring my own boat so fly ins are out. Thanks for any help you are willing to share."
539863,Guest,2004-05-24 06:51:00,0,"I have been going to Gull Rock, south of Red Lake for 16 years. Have gone to the same camp, Weavers Wilderness Camp. He just sold so it is now called Wrights. Going again in August. he does have a couple of RV sites."
539868,Guest,2004-05-24 08:08:00,0,"Lake of the Prairies - Russell Manitoba http://www.gov.mb.ca/conservation/pa...ppi/index.html Plan to be here anytime in the month of June. Loads of eaters under 17"", and lots of fish in the 18""-28"" slot limit, with the occassional big one 29""-30"". If you want to go to a good place with a nice campground, clean showers, and lots of actions for the kids, here is the place."
539872,Guest,2004-05-24 10:16:00,0,"If you want to catch huge walleye, your best bet for a drive to lake is Lac Seul. If you do not have a boat then rent the big 18 Ft Lund with the 40 hp or 50 hp. Big water needs big boat and more comfort. In August last year we had over 100 walleye in the boat on four days, and 70 to 80 the other days. Everyone in the camp caught one 27"" ot better. Try these camps, and you will have a good time;www.fishermanscoveontario.com/ (Best camp)http://www.duenorth.net/lacseullodge/index.html (Sunlight lake outpost looks awesome and is close to great fishing) P.S. I have some of the cheapest friends in the world, who will wait all year to go fishing and then cheap it out and not want to get a guide. Guides cost around $100 US per day and will put you on the fish. Rent one for a couple days or the whole week, it will be well worth the $100 per day."
540479,Guest,2004-06-09 12:05:00,0,"I've been staying at T&D Cabins on Lake Amisk SW of Flin Flon Manitoba for about 14 years now. I go once every other year but some of my friends go annually. The Lake is in Saskatchewan. I've not found a better place to fish. Consistently catch Pike & Walleye in July and because its a long drive there isn't a lot of fishing pressure on the lake. Occassionally we'll hit our creel limits and travel to Manitoba for some fishing as well during the week. The entire Flin Flon area is dotted with numerous Lakes you can access with your boat. Lake Amisk & Athaskapow are two that I'm most familiar with. I tried Lake Erie at Toledo OH for walleyes, Lake Chetek WI for panfish, Potato Lake WI for muskies and have come home dissappointed many times. I've never been dissappointed by Amisk. Bruce & Janet Joa are excellent host and run a very good camp. Good Luck."

540494,Guest,2004-06-09 19:40:00,0,I tried Fishermens Cove and have never been treated so rudley by a camp owner.
540508,Guest,2004-06-10 06:48:00,0,"Take a look at Lake of the Woods. Very big lake, lots and lots of great structure, relatively easy to get to compared to some others (depending upon where you are coming from). It does receive a fair amount of pressure, but because it is so large, you can always find lots of water not being pressured. I've found the fishing on LOTW the last 5 years to be outstanding. Lots of walleye in all size ranges, the northerns are getting bigger and bigger with the not slot limits, the smallmouth fishing is good if not better, the muskie fishing is world class, and while I don't spend much time fishing for them, the lake trout, perch, and crappie fishing are reported to be quite good. For a drive to camp, take a look at Witch Bay Camp. It's on the East side of the lake between Sioux Narrows and Kenora. It has nice accomodations, very good food, outstanding service, excellent equipment (if you need to rent a boat) and docks, and the area of the lake were the camp is does not receive nearly as much fishing pressure as some of the other areas."
540512,Go_Fish,2004-06-10 07:52:00,28,"Sorry to hear that. We have been going to Fisherman's Cove for years, with out a problem. LS is a great lake to fish, just BE CAREFUL!!!! Many fisherman and locals have left lower units (and some their lives) out there. I know one guy in particular who has lost his lower unit twice, and still hasn't learned to stick to the safe routes. Good luck, Go_Fish"
