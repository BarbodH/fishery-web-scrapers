540944,zzlaw,2004-06-18 17:51:00,34,Have fished sturgeon in other areas and just love them as a game fish - haven't fished the Rainy River though - want to go there in the next while - can I get some info on techniques and baits? - also how many sturgeon a day do people get and of those how many are large fish? - understand there are lots of smaller fish as this fishery rebounds - I have to travel a long way so would be really helpful to have a few hot locations too - I can be emailed at [email protected] regarding the locations - also where is a good place(s) to stay? - would rather rent a boat than trailer down - and want to fish off the Canadian side - thanks in advance - Larry
