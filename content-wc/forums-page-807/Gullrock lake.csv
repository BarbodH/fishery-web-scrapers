540694,Guest,2004-06-14 08:34:00,0,Anyone have a water temp for Gullrock?
540728,Guest,2004-06-14 15:32:00,0,I was there all last week 5-12 June. The water temps ran from 55-59 depending on where you were on the lake. Ihawk22
540761,Guest,2004-06-15 10:18:00,0,"Anyone know of a campgrounds on this lake? I've not been thee before but would like to take my boys. Don't mean to sound dumb, but can someone tell me the limit of fish allowed to be kept per day? I have not been to Canada in years but if I remember right the management improved a lot as far as catch and release, limits, slot limits, etc. I am big into catch/release but love walleye would like to fry a few small ones for the boys each day. Also how much are the NR licenses these days? Would be a 4-5 day trip. Thx."
540882,Renn,2004-06-16 16:01:00,87,"I am not real familiar with camping opportunities on the Lake. I know Poplar Point Resort has camping and trailer areas available. Grant and Bev are great people! I have been staying with them for a long time. As far as the limits for walleyes, I can tell you what they were last year and I don't think they have changed. On a regular license you can keep 4 under 18 inches and the provincial law states you can keep 1 over 19 1/2 I think. The Gullrock Resort Association has made a rule that if you do keep one over the 19 1/2 inch length it needs to go home to put on the wall. In my book it needs to be 30 inches to be able to do that. But that's my limit. :-) If you need any other information let me know. If any of this is incorrect I am sure I will be corrected! :-) Renn"
540885,Guest,2004-06-16 18:44:00,0,"Hey those limits sound great. I would not care to keep any myself other than a couple smaller ones to fry up each day, but my buddy was squawking about wanting to keep one for the wall if he got one. So that makes him happy and we are both OK on this lake. I e-mailed Poplar Point for pricing/reservations but have not heard back yet. My oldest son has marching band camps all summer but has the first week of August off so that is what I'm trying to schedule this for."
540928,Renn,2004-06-17 17:20:00,87,Bev usually replies to emails in the mornings but they are pretty busy this time of the year. I will be at Poplar Point the first week of August as well. August is a great time to fish Gullrock. If the wind isn't ripping Gullrock can be a lot of fun to fish!!! Last summer we caught a lot of fish in the 22-25 inch range. Renn
540934,Guest,2004-06-17 23:30:00,0,"Hi Renn, Can you recall if the campsites are usually all taken when you are there, or if there is normally a spot available? It's tough for me to commit to reservatons with my job. Prefer to just wing it. I know they only have 6 or 8 spots with electric. It's odd my buddy wants to be able to keep one for the wall. I am a trophy big game hunter and have many deer/elk mounts, but for some reason never wanted to keep big fish. In fact I am more likely to release them the bigger they are. Maybe it's because I know they are most likely females. Would just like some nice photos. Maybe one of those fiberglass repros. I am 45 and have now officially gotten to the point where I prefer to do the navigating and watch my boys catch fish. My dad was like that. Never thought I'd get there."
540935,Renn,2004-06-18 03:01:00,87,"I know the spots with electric hookups are in the area where they put campers and trailers. I think Grant has put some tent campers next to, or in the camper area in order for them to have electrical hookups in the past. Grant is very easy to get along with. If he can't find a spot to meet your needs I think they would put you in thier front yard if needed. They are great people!! Most of the time they have at least a couple of the areas open the week we have been there. The best thing is to email or call Bev. She will be able to tell you what thier schedule is for trailers and campers that week. I am sure they can find room for you. They have a central shower/toilet facility that is extremely nice and cleaned daily. They have electrical outlets on the dock for charging boat batteries etc. in the boat. I am with you, last year my 7 year old son caught a 26 1/2"" walleye. My wife caught a 26"" walleye. I caught a 27 1/2"" walleye and my 5 year old daughter caught a 22"" walleye while fishing on Gullrock. All released after photos first. My kids just drag around a slip bobber all week and some times catch more walleyes than I do!!! They have a ball! By the way, if you are interested in Northern at all, Gullrock has some tremendous Northern fishing as well. Two years ago I caught and realeased a 43"". Last year I had one on that was bigger. Also, last year an 8 year old kid, jigging for walleyes, brought in a 47 3/8 incher to camp to have Grant freeze it for him. His family owns a cabin on the lake. It was a monster!!! Grant tells me he has seen 50+ inch fish in there!!! Gullrock is a great place to spend a week (or more). That's why my family and I have been going for 27 years. Renn"
540936,Guest,2004-06-18 06:42:00,0,"Well Renn, I hope it works out and we can meet up there that week. Just hoping I can persuade all 3 of my boys to go. 2/3 would not be bad either. Just look for the Rockwood pop-up with the Indiana plate. I am going to do everything I can to get up there that week."
540127,Guest,2004-05-30 18:39:00,0,"cheezhedinTX We are leaving for Gullrock on Friday June 4th. We stay at 5 Lakes Lodge. Nice neat camp and we get treated great by Bud and Malinda. This will be our 4th year in a row there. We fish mostly for walleye but pick a few pike up along the way. Thanks for the tip on the bend into 2 Island lake for pike......we wil try that this year and maybe catch a few more pike. We have never fished in 2 Island, any other hot spots in that lake? Where did you do your best walleye fishing on Gullrock? Did you fish Ranger bay and Ranger Lake? I agree with you about the association enforcing the 18 inch slot. Their goal was to make the fish bigger and to protect the fishing on Gullrock for the future. Sounds like it is working! We can't wait for another great fishing experience. 5 more days! Bud"
540171,Guest,2004-06-01 12:14:00,0,"sorry it took so long but was out of town with work....we haven't fished Ranger, rumor has it that is the best place to target pike, but with a 20-25 HP, thats a long ride from Goldenhook. 2 years ago when we were up there the resort owners asked us not to fish Ranger cuz the walleyes were still spawning in it. This year with a larger/faster rig we'll definately be checking it out. As for walleye, we really dont fish for them, off the docks after dinner is about the only time we throw out live bait and we have done well with larger fish. Any pointers from someone else(pike and or walleye)?????"
540183,Renn,2004-06-01 16:35:00,87,"I've been fishing Gullrock for the last 27 years. I would say it's as close to ""classic"" Walleye and Northern water as you can get. Walleyes - fish rock reefs and points. We never have been to Ranger but if you want to burn a lot of $2.00 gas fish there!! :-) I know a lot of people fish spinner rigs. The water is very stained so bright colors might be best. Last year in August my wife and two kids, who were 6 and 4, caught and released 36 walleyes over 22 inches during our stay in August. I have been there in June, July, and August and would have to say August is by far the best month to catch walleyes. I know a lot of you will say I am crazy with this next comment, but we have found the more sun and less wind, the better the walleye fishing. Northern - fish weeds adjacent to deep water. We fish a lot of dark color baits. Suick's and black Harasser's and Muskie Thrillers. Hope this helps. Have fun and let us know how you do when you get back. Our camp owners told me last week the fishing has been great but bring your coveralls!!! :-)"

540349,Guest,2004-06-05 09:31:00,0,"Hey Renn,How was LOW? Glad to see you didn't freeze to death or get blown away!"
540351,Guest,2004-06-05 09:42:00,0,"FYI: Started fishing Gullrock in 1962. Stayed at a camp known then as Stewart's Two Island,then Cook's,then McEwen's and now has a new owner. Have found walleyes between the two islands along the north shore and on the east side of north bay. Drifting in front of an old loging path. Northern taken at north bay as well as the channel into Gullrock. Have found great walleye at Three Sisters and directly west of Three Sisters along shore line. Also found great walleye and northern in bay leading into Ranger. This bay,however now,in a sanctuary as is closed to fishing during spawning season. (sign on west shore has dates of closure) Walleyes in Ranger were taken next to island on the east side. You can travel the river into Ranger at a fast rate of you keep the boat on plane. Be careful as you start to enter Ranger as the river has sandbars at entry point. This year we,re going to GoldenHook and we'll see what we can find on the south end. Good fishing to all."
540409,Renn,2004-06-07 16:21:00,87,"orngruffee, Yeah, it ended up cold, rainy and windy. We caught walleyes but most were from 12 - 14 inches long. Tough conditions to catch a bunch of shorts!!! We had to fish vertically in 30 feet of water to catch numbers. I wish I could go back in a week or two. Oh well, that's fishing and it was a lot better than working!!! :-) Renn"
540428,Guest,2004-06-08 12:33:00,0,Well tomorrow I start day 1 of 15 days of vacation so Ill be checking this site and the Red Lake forecast every 5 minutes or so.... Anyone been up to Gullrock last week? We are heading up this FRI (11th). I spoke to the resort owner and he says the fishing has been good. I think he said the largest walleye in camp so far was 12 lbs. the pike fishing also sounds like it has been good for large fish.

539885,Guest,2004-05-24 14:32:00,0,any fishing reports from this beautiful ontario lake. We are heading up in a few weeks and as all of us---I have that fever. Can not stop thinking about the trip and being with the fellas and enjoying and respecting the beautiful land that is canada!!!! we are staying at ole weavers which i now believe is wrights wilderness camp. thanks and hope all enjoy the time in canada.
539888,Guest,2004-05-24 14:53:00,0,"I would like to hear a report also. I have been at Weavers for 16 years. Lee Wright seems like a nice hard working guy. Where are your hot spots?Good luck. e-mail [email protected], we can share"
539896,Guest,2004-05-24 20:20:00,0,"My group of 6 will be up the week of June 19 at Goldenhook. It is our first time so I would appreciate any information on the Pike and Walleye fishing. We love walleye fishing but would also like to target big pike. Whats the water color, suggested areas to try, presentations and lure colors. I have heard great things and am looking forward to the trip. Good luck to all this year! I'll post when we return."

540102,zinger_79,2004-05-29 22:52:00,76,"A family group of three adults and three kids went to Gullrock last year and was a little disappointed. Heard what a great walleye lake this was but found the fishing to be tough. In fairness, two comments. First, there was some unstable weather in the second week of June our first two days there. Second, we spoke to two groups who have been coming back for several years (which tells me fishing has been good enough for them to return) that said this was the toughest bite they've seen on Gullrock. The biggest disappointment was that when we got there, the owner said that Gullrock wasn't really a pike lake and the way they caught pike was by jigging for them like walleyes. So when the walleyes were slow, I couldn't get the kids into any pike action, including hammers. Learned my lesson there by not asking the right question up front. I had assumed pike could be caught with relative ease on most Ontario lakes. Good luck on your trip there."
540112,Guest,2004-05-30 08:11:00,0,"Whoever told ya that the Gullrock chain is tough for pike was full of crap. We are heading back in 2 weeks. Our group fishes mainly for them and the last time we were there I caught several fish in the 30 inch plus range, including one just over 44 inches, and they are all still there! 2 years earlier another in our group caught a 45 incher. Look for the Cabbage weed and you'll find pike all day long. On the final bend of the channel flowing INTO 2 Island lake, just where the lake opens up, we could catch them all day, everyday."
540114,Guest,2004-05-30 08:19:00,0,"Link- Dont know much about the walleye, live bait seems to be the best for them, but for pike we do well with BIG Johnson Silver minnows, tipped with a rubber grub, or Copper and Orange colored spoons, Blue Fox used to make them but discontinued them, but you can find a look alike from Cabelas for $2-3. And any type of large spinners(blue fox, mepps #5's) reeled fast so they cause the water to ""hump"" on the surface seems to work well too."
540115,Guest,2004-05-30 09:15:00,0,"Wow thanks for reassuring us on the Pike cheezhedinTX. I know a group who has been fishing Gullrock for many years and recommended we give it a try. Every guy in the group has caught a 45"" pike. Last year they caught a 33"" Walleye too. Good luck!"
540116,2746,2004-05-30 09:21:00,3206,"Just returned from Gullrock and had the best fishing in years, at least for size. Difficulty in catching ""keepers"" but all kinds of walleyes in the 20"" - 28"" range. Will be back up the week of June 12th and again in August. A truly great walleye lake that has benefited from the association rules to release all walleyes over 18"".....the fish seem to get bigger every year."
