539774,Guest,2004-05-20 23:54:00,0,We went there for about 6 years after about 15 at timberlane. Now we dont drive quite as far and go to LOTW. Barb is very nice and the cabins are too. if its just the husband and wife get the honeymoon cabin. Its off on the other side of the main lodge. small but nice. we always found the fishing very good around the bridge just down the way.
