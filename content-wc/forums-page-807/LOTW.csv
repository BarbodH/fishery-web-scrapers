We are taking a boat, but will have a lot of people, so we won't be able to go at once. Any help with some good hot spots would also be appreciated. Thanks!!"

Occasionally I see kids fishing from the docks, but very limited success. They have boats w/motors available for rent at the dock. They seem reasonable and there is decent fishing close to the resort. I wouldn't want to stay the close to good fishing and never get out on the water."

I WILL be out on the water quite a bit, but just wondered about shorefishing...Just checked the forecast, and it doesn't look too bad...Hopefully the fishing will be great..."
