No problem, no guilt, no feeling the rules are being broken. The MNR during most of these tournaments is an active participant, and are either allowing us to bend the rules (stated explicitly), or just turn a blind eye. Now, when I go on an occasional (read rare) outing where I keep a few eaters, I do not cull...ever. I recall back in the bad old days when it was legal that my Dad upgraded our catches. I look back at the old regs and shudder. With this culling problem, the MNR has a sticky issue. Tournament anglers and tournaments are huge for tourism and injecting money into some rather soft local economies. Take away the cull, and you risk alienating a massive section of the fishing public....a section that spends a lot of money on the sport. The Ontario Gov't is definately afraid to go all the way on this one. -J"

What I have a problem with, is pulling fish from coolers or stringers, puffing them through the water for five minutes, and sending them down belly-up.....thats not cool. Livewells were put in boats for that purpose - keep the fish fresh."
