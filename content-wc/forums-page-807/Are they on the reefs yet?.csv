540808,MTJ,2004-06-16 10:08:00,106,"Just got back from LOTW on Sunday. We found fish in 8-10ft along weedlines. We did graph a rockpile that is usually on of the first to hold fish as they are moving to mid-lake structure and didn't see a fish. Not saying they aren't on the reefs yet but the water temp is still a little low, 60 degrees, and most of the bait fish seem to be in the shallows yet."

Warm weather has been kinda hard to come by this yr. Water temps are still cold, best fishing so-far seems to have been mid day with sun straight up.......good luck"
