Not sure how people keep track of how many they catch though. All I know is we ran out of minnows each day, did damage to pounds of leeches, and were worn out from catching fish each day."

540874,Guest,2004-06-16 14:18:00,0,"Our group just returned from our 14th year on Lac Suel using the SLFL houseboat operation and camping/fishing mostly in the NE region (Wapesi, Birch Narrows, etc). Fishing was somewhat slower than some of the other years but, we still had many fish in the 24-28"" range and ""slotters"" were everywhere. Weather was good and water levels were high for this time of year. I think given the opening weather that better things are probably right around the corner."
540883,Guest,2004-06-16 16:29:00,0,I've wondered about the counting myself. Maybe the have A DESIGNATED COUNTER.
540716,Guest,2004-06-14 12:59:00,0,Just got back from Lac Seul. Have been going for 6 years and this year was the worst fishing since we started. The other groups in camp felt the same way. Has anybody else had the same problem?
540721,Guest,2004-06-14 13:56:00,0,"OK you got me scared now! I'm leaving Friday for Ear Falls I have noticed that people are not giving reports, does bad news travel slow? What area were you fishing?"
540726,Guest,2004-06-14 15:29:00,0,"you bet it's been slow. rain, wind, cold and snow led to a slow start. this guy will give you the straight scoop. few operators will. mostly happy talk. check him out. that's always the chance you take going up early. http://www.justfishontario.com/disc18_toc.htm"
540731,Walleye_Slayer,2004-06-14 16:21:00,134,i'm leaving for ear falls on thursday. don't worry there is plenty of good fishing every year i adapt a little and as i do more adapting more fish we catch. I've been going for 20 years and have had a bad day or 2 but never a whole week. Just remember that is why they call it fishing instead of catching. Believe me i was it was catching but if you adapt a little you will be ok A Bad Day Fishing is Better than the Best Day at Work Best Reguards Walleye_Slayer
540733,Guest,2004-06-14 17:03:00,0,just looked at the weather forcast. you guys might be hitting it just right. fishing should be great. good luck.
540737,Guest,2004-06-14 20:29:00,0,"We fished Lac Seul the first week of June. We did catch 300 less Walleye this year than we did last year but we still caught 900 Walleye in 6 days this year. Size was down a little but we had plenty of action and we will be back for years to come. One of the new guys on the trip left me a phone message last week and one of the things he said was ""Thanks for the greatest week of my life""....... Guess fishing wasnt too bad."
540744,stumcfar,2004-06-15 07:06:00,451,"Returned from Ear Falls on Sunday. Fishing maybe wasn't as good as the last couple of years, but it was still steady action. The wind was horrible Friday and Saturday. Thank goodness for the English River. We fished part of 2 days below the dam and actually caught our bigger fish there. It is nice to have that option on the real windy days."
540745,Guest,2004-06-15 07:39:00,0,"Slayer, Where are you staying, our group will be at Golden Fawn, never been there hoping for a great trip. Never fished Lac Suel B4, We fishe Minnetaki 2 years ago but never ventured into Lac Suel AVS"
540746,Walleye_Slayer,2004-06-15 07:43:00,134,we stay at goldpines last camp on the point right as you head out to the main lake by the eye marker. lots of fish but lots of big water and lots of weather. winds can be tough but usually let up later at nite on bad days. great fishing will have a good time. email me if you have any specifics [email protected] A Bad Day Fishing is Better than the Best Day at Work Best Reguards Walleye_Slayer
540750,Guest,2004-06-15 08:48:00,0,It's all about weather and seasonal progression of the fish. Next weeks weather looks very favorable and this week is nice and consistent with warming occuring next week. Hoping it's a great week.
