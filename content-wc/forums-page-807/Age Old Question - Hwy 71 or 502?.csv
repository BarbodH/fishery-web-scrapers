But with recent improvements to 502 and construction on 17 between Vermilion Bay and Dryden, thinking about taking 502, then 594 to Eagle River. Granted 502 is shorter, but not necessarily the best (or smoothest) way. Any first hand experience from last fall or this year would be great. Thanks!"
540451,Trailerguy,2004-06-08 19:12:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I went that way 10 days ago, 502 has one older strech with patches, 22 miles long(on my odometer). Also the last 1/4 mile before the stop sign was under repair with flagmen, and about a 1/4 mile of 594 going west. I go west and turn north on ""Grifth's road"" which is immediatly after the 1st bridge. Hwy 17 is torn up with flagmen as well,for several miles going west, I was told there is a longer strech going east to Dryden. If I was going to Eagle River, I think I'd try turning off 502 onto ""Ojibway drive"" a blacktopped road that goes through the resevation but comes out at Eagle River."
540464,walleye1230,2004-06-09 07:14:00,41,"Thats the exact way we used to go, Ojibway to 594 then into Eagle River. That way is by far shorter then going all the way up 71, through Vermilion Bay, etc. I'll talk it over with the rest of the guys, but with those recent improvements, if we just take it slow through the rough section, we should be fine. I would prefer to take 502, much shorter which equates to more time on the water! Thanks"
540753,Go_Fish,2004-06-15 09:14:00,28,"Fellas, How is Ojibway Drive on a boat trailer? Is 594 all blacktop? I guess I remember part of it being gravel. We have always tried to avoid gravel when hauling the boat. Let me know what you think. Traditionally we have headed east on 594 to Gordon Road, and then N to 17, and then west. I'm always open to a new way. Thanks for any advice, and I puff on a cigar for all of ya on the way up. Regards, Go_Fish"
540759,Trailerguy,2004-06-15 10:02:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Yes, 594 is partly gravel, but was well packed and didn't throw a lot of stones, slowing down on it still is faster than going through Dryden. Hwy 17 was rougher and more had loose stuff in the constuction zones."
