I'm lucky the place I go will get the rate from the bank and give me that rate for my money. I was looking at this last week 4 years ago I got $1.50 Canadian for each US dollar, last year it was about what it is now about $1.26."
540767,Sam,2004-06-15 11:51:00,16,The Beer Store gives the official rate. I doubt they will trade money with you though.
540769,Gary_IA,2004-06-15 12:18:00,144,Its been a few years since I was in Ontario. My practice was to use credit cards and US currency for items you couldn't use your credit card. On the way out I stopped at the Information Centre in Fort Fort Frances and exchange my Canadian change and bills for US currency (except the cost the toll bridge which I kept Canadian currency for)
540792,Guest,2004-06-15 23:01:00,0,"FYI: Boise charges the toll now in Fort Frances and they get you for $9 US Funds when you come across towards Fort Frances. There is no toll on the way back to MN. You can avoid this by taking HWY 11 west to Baudette. If you're coming to the Morson area, it only adds 15 mins to your trip and is a nicer drive to a less busy border crossing."

540794,Guest,2004-06-16 00:14:00,0,evidently you were not there last year. the bridge owners changed how they scam the people crossing the bridge. Now they collect on the american side in only US money for the round trip. you get to come back to the USA for free because they collect all their money before you cross going north.

540817,Guest,2004-06-16 12:16:00,0,"I bought Canadian currency at my home bank in Wisconsin before we left 2 weeks ago. I don't remember how much $C I got back, but I spent $496A. We crossed ""The Bridge"" at Fort Francis, paid I think $16C (you guys are correct, they don't nab you in and out now, only twice as much on the way in) but when we got turned back, we went right into Border Bob's to change our $C back to $A, and they only gave me $404A. It's been my experience that the closer to the border you are, the poorer the exchange. Use a credit card if you can."
