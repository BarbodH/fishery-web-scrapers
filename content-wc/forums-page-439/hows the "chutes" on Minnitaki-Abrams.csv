1434879,scar,2012-05-13 19:06:00,196,Going up for the opener and heard the water was very low a few weeks ago but has come up nicely since ice out. Can anyone verify water levels on Minnitaki?

1434915,TroyMansfield,2012-05-13 20:06:00,92,"the lakes have come up quite a bit since ice out and are at a good level for the spawn, the chutes and season opener, but I beleive they have already peaked for now, and will probably maintain this level for a few weeks either way, unless we get a substantial amout of rain, the water temps are good and its going to be good fishing, cant wait for opener!"
