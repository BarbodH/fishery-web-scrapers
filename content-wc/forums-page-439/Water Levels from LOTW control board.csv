Nothing beats reports from the field but thought this link may be of some help. It has current water level, inflow/outflow, projected levels/averages and some neat historical data. Over the course of the years fishing on Lac Seul and taking a houseboat through The RAGS we have passed through there with the reported water level as low as 1168-1169ft without hitting any stumps. GPS elevation was showing 1170 ft (minus the height for the antenna above water). This was with 65 ft LSFL houseboats with no engine trim controls.http://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.htmlBrian"
