Was told by a friend that Cozy Camp is the only camp on 18 or so miles of river. Supposed to be terrific walleye and pike fishing there. I have a chance to take a trip there for almost free. Brother-in-law of a friend had to cancel. I can go on the trip with most of it paid. However, that would be my week in Canada that I usually take to Indian Point Camp on Wabigoon Lake. I have gone to the ""Goon"" for 5 years and love it."
