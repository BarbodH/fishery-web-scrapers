1432372,LLewellin,2012-05-08 07:28:00,1790,"100% agree! Just make sure you use the appropriate length of rope...ie not to short. I also use the elastic strap, can't think of the name, that buffers the shock from big waves."
1432601,Bigstorm,2012-05-08 14:10:00,799,"This made me laugh, we had a guy join our yearly trip, he brought his own boat. We had warned him that we usually donate an achor, he went out and spent $80 on this. Its still in Canada saving our fishing spot. We actually snagged the rope tied to it the following year and re-anchored in that spot."
1432684,LLewellin,2012-05-08 16:53:00,1790,How deep?
1432695,Fish_Heads,2012-05-08 17:01:00,154,I need an anchor & a few choice keeper fish wouldn't hurt either.........What are the GPS coordinates ???LOL Fish
1432915,Bigstorm,2012-05-09 07:11:00,799,"anchor is in about 15ft of water but in a lot of current, just accross the really fast current in the picture. Anyone that wants to use it, just swin something about 10ft down with treble hooks, you'll find the rope."
1432998,LLewellin,2012-05-09 08:38:00,1790,"I was just thinking that out in ND we had a couple of anchors that were hung up and we swam, in the middle of summer so water was not too cold, down to the anchor about 12-15' and got it free. Just a thought...."
1433040,nitrodude,2012-05-09 09:39:00,60,"A Chene anchor has worked well for me in extreme current, tide, swells, etc. and won't break the bank at a $30 avg. retail. Hooks up fast and if it doesn't pop free by hand a slow motor past it has always popped the flukes free for me."
1433072,geareng,2012-05-09 10:23:00,335,"I also agree that the I-Pilot has replaced the need for a lot of anchoring situations. I purchased my I-Pilot going on three years ago and have not used my anchors in the boat since. But if one was to still feel the need to buy an anchor, i would also recommend a Richter Anchor, pretty hard to beat."
1433793,Kevin R,2012-05-10 17:37:00,305,"I use a sea claw they work well in a variety of bottoms. Best part is the rope/chain hooks to the bottom of the sea claw, the top loop of the sea claw Gets a plastic tie that breaks away when the anchor is stuck in rocks the anchor then pulls free from the bottom backwards never lost a sea claw since I changed from other anchors 10 years ago. This same hook up can be done with other anchors but only if it has a secure attachment to the bottom of the anchor."
1430955,gramps73,2012-05-05 07:19:00,21,Looking for a new anchor for the new Raptor.. Any suggestions would be great.. Thanks
1431009,Guk,2012-05-05 09:49:00,39,"It's called an I-Pilot......I have been going to Lake of the Woods since 1998, have left an anchor behind on many occations because it becomes wedged in the rocks while bobber fishing. Not anymore with the new I-Pilot!"
1431421,fishinnut 3446,2012-05-06 10:10:00,638,"Guk,It's funny you say that,now I did not leave my anchor behind but I could not hold the boat even with 2 anchor's out,1-28lb & 1-18lb.but that was in 30-35 mph wind's it was like we had a drift sock out,I now have the I-Pilot so time will tell I have'nt use it yet."
1431464,Limeyangler,2012-05-06 12:56:00,563,"x2 about the I-pilot. Witness the birth of a game changer in terms of trolling motors.I have not really used any features apart from the spot lock (anchor) feature so far, in my opinion that alone is worth the 500 bones i paid!"
1431676,kliph,2012-05-06 21:20:00,2337,The best I found is a Danforth.http://danforthanchors.com/dimages/alldan.jpghttp://danforthanchors.com/
1431738,greenie,2012-05-07 06:37:00,87,RICHTER ANCHOR. Can't go wrong. Been caught in rocks and was able to back up and pull it out. Look at the design. It's one awesome anchor!http://richteranchors.com/
1431748,blewslb,2012-05-07 07:06:00,53,"I lost three anchors in two years, Richter is the answer @$100.00 you don't need anything else."
1431809,1860Angler,2012-05-07 08:47:00,2642,iPilot is a must for one anchor and as far as a backup/regular anchor the best I have found is the Richter.
1431818,gregk9,2012-05-07 09:01:00,625,Doesn't that use up battery power fast in rough water?
1432050,briand,2012-05-07 15:06:00,48,Somebody gifted or regifted a bread maker for the cottageI thinking of tieing a rope with a shoe knot and using the bread maker as an anchor
