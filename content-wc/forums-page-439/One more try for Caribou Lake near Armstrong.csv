1433271,drew59,2012-05-09 17:20:00,87,Am I the only person here going to Caribou this year? Hard to believe. This is a large drive-to lake with little fishing pressure. I'd love to chat with others who fish it.
1433498,Jarbear,2012-05-10 07:58:00,24,Heading to Caribou again this September. This is our 6th year at the Bear Paw. Big lake with lots of places to explore for fish.
1433837,drew59,2012-05-10 19:36:00,87,I knew you were one that had been there. Last year there were a few more as well. My wife and I go to Forrest Lodge in the spring and fall. If anyone is going this spring I'd be glad to share info. Same for the fall when it gets closer. We love the camp and the lake. I bought a portable downrigger for this year and am hopeful it helps with middle of the day lakers. We'll see.
