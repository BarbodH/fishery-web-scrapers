1434542,Rivratz,2012-05-12 18:24:00,105,"Bring a total stranger on such an important trip. Waited all year to go. Why spoil it? Just asking for trouble, or some type of problem, especially if it was a fly in trip. Monies would have to be paid for their portion, at least 3 weeks in advance for all expenses including food and fuel. Going to Canada is a trip that I consider everyone in the group should be comfortable with, and know each other really well. It' s a pretty intimate setting, especially a fly in trip. At least if you were at a drive to camp, you could send them packing with bus fare if it got really bad. A stranger could, and probably will, rain on your parade."
1434681,phishfearme,2012-05-13 08:05:00,1242,"after a certain amount of input/postings on this site over a few years, i feel i've gotten to know some of the guys here even though a face-to-face hasn't occured. in many respects i would consider these longer term communications more valuable than one dinner meeting or even a day fishing together. so, guess i would rely on these communications and welcome certain guys into our group. even tooski from cleveland - aka hillary clinton (he compared us fishing together as a marriage between tom cruise and hillary - and CLEARLY i must be cruise) - i've never met him face to face but after lots of communincations over a number of years, i would welcome going on a fishing trip with him - especially so we could discuss the steelers 8 super bowl appearances and compare that to all those cleve brownies appearances. phish"
1435043,DougBlack,2012-05-14 07:51:00,29,"I see the pros and cons to both. I figure I can put up with most anyone for the most part, especially if I am up in Canada. You can always get away from them for a great deal of time if need be. I really look at it as if most people that go up to Canada on fly ins and such are similar types for most part if they have been doing it in past. First timer could be a pain though. Biggest problem I could see is two veterans with totally different styles of fishing and schedules. Anyway, I would certainly try to meet them, and talk a few times before hand, but would not be too terribly worried about anyone that has been going up there for many years. ****, you might find your new best buddy."
1435320,mcsteve,2012-05-14 17:54:00,13,"I've been on both ends of this discussion and I'll be happy to say the best trips I have had have been with groups I have met at the lodge or online. The so called ""buddies"" who semi commit always find an excuse not to come up with the deposit and then you end up paying double for your own. Or the guy you thought was a decent person reveals his sickest, most discusting self while stuck in a cabin for 6 days. I met a great group at a Quebec lodge and spent several years fishing with them. Three years ago I had health issues and could not go. As a result my boat partner decided to plan a trip west the following year. I posted a wanted in another forum and ended up wth another great group the following year. We spoke a few times on the phone and emailed and everyone knew what to expect. The best thing to do is lay it all out', fishing style, fish targeted, habits and reason for going. Some guys just want to sit in the boat and want nothing to do with driving. I was in a cabin beside a group who had a member who hated fishing. He just lived to be out of touch, sitting on the dock enjoying a beer. He spend every afternoon cooking great meals and the guys would split their fish with him so his wife didn't know he only went for the peace and quite. It takes all kinds. Steve"
1435322,mcsteve,2012-05-14 17:57:00,13,"BTW, I'm looking for a new group that enjoys walleye fishing in northern Quebec (Lake Kipawa) next year. It may be just me or my old boat buddy and his dad as well. Depends how that make out with the jobs this year. Anyway, I am definitely looking for fishing partners."
1435342,Larry S,2012-05-14 18:23:00,665,"Being the youngest by 13 yrs ,when all my former fishing partners from Chicago, deceided that they were to old to continue going to Canada fishing, I used Walleye Central to find new partners. It worked out fine the first time from 2003 to 2008 with my first set of partners. When I clashed with certain personalities, I deceided to find more suitable partners and have been going with phishfearme and his group from Pittsburgh since 2009 I have found that its important to talk a number of times and find out all the particulars before going with new people.If phishfearme a Pittsburgh Steelers fan could put up with Cleveland Browns fan tooski.It was far easier for me a Chicago Bears fan to fish with a Steelers fan As long as I can fish 8 hrs or so each day I'm happy and can put up with a few unpleasant things for 1 week. If its so unpleasant then I just won't go with these people the next time. Larry S"
1433967,wallydave,2012-05-11 07:26:00,2151,"I agree, I would not go on a trip without some serious conversations with a person. My background in sales and now in Pastoral Care provides me with the ability to work with people of all ""shapes and sizes""! I have been looking for a new boat/cabin partner ever since my ""old"" partner has been able to bring his whole family along now. My ""new"" cabin partner is working out just fine, thank you! A big part of the Canadian experiance for me, is the group coming together to ""make"" the trip a succes! Some of my favorite memories of past trips is not the fishing, but over coming some difficulties as a group!"
1433969,Freytown,2012-05-11 07:30:00,770,"I'm short a man this year...3 going hoping for 4...and I find that the passport issue & DUI records have eliminated some hopefull's. Things were much easier years ago, prior to 9/11...oh well, it is what it is.As far as a total stranger going, if it means I don't go or do go, to me it's better to go. Prior to the trip with a few phone calls a lot of things can be discussed like expectations, prior fishing history etc.But in the end, it is a double edge sword, a risk I would gladly take. BTW, I have an open seat at the Gouin for 6/9-6/16."
1433979,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-05-11 07:44:00,138,You can leave them on a reed bed in the middle of the lake when you need a break . Lucky for Rockape he now has a really great fishing partner who has taught him how to catch fish and women.
1433996,Ogoki,2012-05-11 08:13:00,291,"Have to add a couple things here . We had a fellow who was my uncle's hunting and fishing buddy for over 40 years . This guy would sleep the whole way to and from a trip . That would be 14 or 21 hour trip depending on where we flew out from . That was ok but left two of us to drive the whole trip . 2 pickups trucks and 6 guys . We got by with that but an extra driver at times would have been nice . My uncle usually got the groceries for the trips . He liked doing that as he preferred to do much of the cooking . That was his thing . On a couple trips he had me do the buying as he was tied up with farming . When we ""paid up"" for the groceries it came to 40 bucks per man . Can't eat that cheap at home I thought . He said it was too expensive as my uncle only charged 15 buck per man . As we all knew my uncle paid for most everything out of his pocket . The guy at question grumbled about that for years . He owned over 400 acres of some prime Ohio farmland too . Not like he could not afford the 40 bucks . My uncle and him went each year with a group of 6 to 10 farmers on a second trip . Finally the other group ""divorced him"" from their group . On a trip with them , my uncle bought 2 lbs of cheese and this guy said he should not pay the same as everybody els as he did not eat any cheese . This same guy had a metal tackle box that had to weigh over 50 lbs . When we got hit up for overweight (each time I might add ) he always grumbled about that . At camp, all my group pitched in and help with the chores . Someone mentioned to him that we needed a bucket of water and he stated he did not go on vacation to work . LOL I could go on and on , but you get the picture . He was the guy who cried the loudest when he did not catch the most or biggest fish . My group ""divorced "" him also . On another trip we had a new guy who wanted to go . I did not set this trip up but was asked to go . We had a couple get to gatheres prior to going and he ""seemed"" fine . We were driving 2 hours at a time . When it was his turn he would not stop , but drove over 5 hours . My turn was next so I stayed awake thinking he would pull over anytime . NOT until 3 a.m. and as you know that driving from 3 a.m. until daylight can be tough . At camp he was a total jerk to anyone he was not fishing with that day . Had lots of VERY GOOD experiences with other people too I might add . It can only take one to mess up a good time ."
1434020,dutchboy,2012-05-11 08:50:00,5717,Nobody would want me in their group. I don't fish for Walleye.I don't drink much.I swear like a sailor at times.I like to cast for Pike and Smallmouth.Other then that I might be OK.
1434051,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-05-11 09:34:00,138,"One year I got hooked up with one our core guys college buddy as a fishing partner. The day we left was the first time I met Kevin, Picture Barney Rubble as a hippie. Seamed like a nice enough fella. We got everything packed and were just about to leave when he hand me a bag with a long thin hose. ""What's this"" I say innocently. ""Oh it's a catheter. Put it on and we can drink all the way up and we won't have to stop and pee."" Ever get a little voice in your head? Mine was screaming LEAVE HIM!!! Well I'm stupid and didn't listen. Two hours into the 20 hour trip he's sh!t faced and asks if he can play one of his CD's. I say go ahead, it has got to be better than the conversation. He pops in the CD and it is Tibetan chanting? My apology to you Tibetans, but what kinda of freak has 8 CD""s full of monk chants?Fast forward to the cabin, it's early morning. I stumble out to the kitchen for some coffee. Right away the smell hits me! ""Who crapped their pants?"" We start looking around and there is crap everywhere. Kevin had gone out to take a leak and had stepped in Bear crap. It's all up his leg where he scratched his leg with his foot.Coupe of days later we head into Sioux Lookout to pick up some things and to take a shower at knobby's. We all are setting there enjoying a fine breakfast and waiting our turn to use the shower. Pretty soon into the restaurant walks Kevin in a towel. He forgot to bring clean underwear and and had thrown away his old ones figuring they were unsalvageable. For you guys who have been to Knobby's. Just picture Barney Rubble walking in in a towel. Now picture Barney going to the grocery store and the hardware store in a towel.Rockape will need to tell you the story about what happened in the strippers motel room in Dryden. I was smart enough not to attend that fiasco. Don't forget to ask about the drug dealer also.The moral of this story is never take a blind date fishing."
1434081,rockape,2012-05-11 10:44:00,215,True story here!!! Saw it myself! The wrangler really got me on the women up nort ever since I told him he was cute and I wanted to cuddle with him on day 6 of a prior trip.
1434250,Mondo_)H,2012-05-11 17:57:00,91,"Doug, why dont you give the Who, What, Where and Whens of the trip to see if anyone is interested? Alittle more info may help your situation."
1434254,pan-man,2012-05-11 18:04:00,299,"I posted last year on this site for fishing partner(s) up to Canada as I wanted to do more than 1 trip with the group I went with.I had everything (boat,camper,truck, etc.), all they had to bring was fishing and personal gear.I had two responses and they could not commit.So this year, I have decide to 2-3 trips by myself. A little extra work and cost but I love catching 50-100 walleye a day!!!"
1434300,green&orange,2012-05-11 20:05:00,28,Now THAT is a funny story!
1433535,DougBlack,2012-05-10 08:50:00,29,"Anyone from time to time have trouble getting your group together, economy, divorces, wife unhappy, blah blah?? There needs to be a web site or something to post a trip looking for an extra or two, so that you can get your booking in in a timely fashion. Been going up for twenty years, and the last 3 have been a struggle to say the least to get 4 minimum to go. Any ideas, thoughts, or is it just me"
1433536,Juls,2012-05-10 08:52:00,13414,Why don't you just post it here that you are looking for a partner or two to go up with you? This is the largest walleye fishing website on the internet after all. Juls
1433552,octanehi5,2012-05-10 09:25:00,1104,"i THINK THAT WOULD FALL UNDER SHARE A SEAT, I have had the same problem sometimes and have found guys to go with,as Juls Stated its a national Posting You may have a hard time finding someone close to your location. We have a group of 10 guys going north this july in two camps as a result of seeking more fishermen. As an example I'm from Ct.My wifes son lives 50 mins from me and his buddie lives in Ma.5 guys are from up state Ny but live 5hrs away from each other, and 2 guys from virginia guys that I met on the lake up north. I have found that if you only keep a small group of guys that someone in your group will not be able to go.We are always open to taking new guys fishing with us. There are no strangers in the world just friends we have not met yet"
1433556,Ogoki,2012-05-10 09:29:00,291,"I feel your pain as far as getting trips together . In the early 80's I would get 6 guys together for a fly-in trip once and sometimes twice a summer . 6 guys meant two pickup trucks and worked out nicely . Most of us were around 30 then . Since then , guys with kids in college , job losses , some of the older guys passing away , some retired with less income so no fly-in trips for them . From my area ,at that time I could name over 30 people who flew in every year from Armstrong . From my church alone were at least three trips of eight guys . Anyway you get the point and I am sure you are well aware of all this . I am semi-retired and make sure I take on enough work to cover the bills and my trips . Lucky for me I married a great gal who had never done much outdoor ""stuff"" until I introduced her to it . Now she does fly-in trips with me , canoe trips , bear hunts , yes bear hunts. So I am blessed . Only problem is , that it cost so much we have to limit it to two big trips a summer . I am going on three trips myself this summer . Last year my extra trip was was with some guys I go to church with and this year basically the same . I have to chuckle to myself when guys speak here of the price of gas etc for the trip . It is not just the gas cost for the trip but the cost of gas and everything else thru out the year that cuts into the trip money . Last summer alone, I spent over $4000 in my service truck to make the extra money for the trips . If the gas was $2 a gallon instead of $4 a gallon I would of had $2000 for me . Sounds like the above poster mentioned , you might be able to pick up people from this forum . My only concern is that I would end up with someone who did not pull his share or might be a little hard to get along with . I have heard that one before . Even had a couple like that along on our trips . Most guys are good though . Good Luck in your quest !!!!!"
1433570,phishfearme,2012-05-10 09:49:00,1242,"all groups eventually run into this problem - and this is the best site there is to address it. i met LarryS on this site and now he's a regular with us and last year we filled a last minute loss with another guy from this site. biggest challenge is to find someone who wants to do the TYPE of trip that you do. there's so many types - we do 10day flyin housekeeping trips and that is either too isolated for some, too long for others (like tooski) or too expensive, or whatever. you gotta try though and this site is the best for that. phish"
1433602,DougBlack,2012-05-10 10:51:00,29,"Thanks for replys guys, good stuff, and I am not alone in this it might seem. If I am struggling with people to fill out the camp next year, I will post away on here and see what happens. Anybody from the thumb area in Michigan or that general vicinity??"
1433701,wallydave,2012-05-10 15:09:00,2151,"When I made my first trip to Ontario, we had any where from 8-12 guys at camp. Like many of us, a very few still make the trip North. We have not had a man die, but age, the long drive and busy lives have reduced the trip down to 6, thats including my old boat/cabin buddy's family. I have ""met"" some great people on this site, and if a time and place could be agreed upon, I would be glad to share a boat and a few stories around the fire with just about anyone of them. Lucky we have a plce like this to keep connected!"
1433748,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-10 16:26:00,235,"Aren't people a little leary of going on such an isloated with people you just met on the Internet? Not like you'll get a psychopath, but just that personalities might clash and then you're stuck for several days. I could see trying a single outing on a lake you live by, and if the vibes are good you maybe proposition a Canada trip, but I personally would need to have at least met someone before going on a long trip like that."
1433765,tooski,2012-05-10 17:01:00,393,I'm with TenHorse 100% on this one. I can't imagine spending 7 days with someone that I hadn't spent 7 minutes talking to. I almost committed to a ten day trip with Phish but thank God at the last minute I found out he was a Pittspuke Squealer fan....would have been like Tom Cruise on a blind date with Hillary Clinton.
1433952,rockape,2012-05-11 06:34:00,215,I'm also with tenhorse. I can't go more than a day with some of my relatives let alone a total stranger! That is A LOT of time in a place you can't get away from someone if you even wanted to!
