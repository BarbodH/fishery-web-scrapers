1434328,Ranger319,2012-05-11 21:24:00,166,"Gord,Just wanted to give you a for conducting this ""survey"". You are doing an excellent job keeping everyone focused. I for one, find everyone's thoughts very enlightening. Now if we can just get you to come to your senses on thinking you can outfish us Jig fishermen with your crankbaits! pm headed your way Gord!OH!!! my take on everything....This will be my 15 year on Lac Suel. Each year I have brought back my 3 under, 1 over. Actually, most in my group do it. I can honestly say that I don't know why we keep the over and not another 17-18"" fish. I guess I have to say its because we can. I have spent a lot more time on this forum, and have grown a lot as a person in the last year. I know that in 8 weeks when I am traveling down 502, that I will only have 4 under 18"" walleyes assigned to my license. I do agree with one of the other posts that was something to the effect of "" how much damage is taking 1 fish doing?"" That being said, each ""1 over fish"" that is released is 1 more fish that will get the chance to turn into that mysterious 30"" that everyone seems to go after. Cheers all!!"
1434401,v-bay gord,2012-05-12 07:47:00,3168,"Ranger, if everyone used crankbaits then for sure we would have to limit the number of big fish that could be kept.! Thanks for getting me off topic......."

1434437,dog2,2012-05-12 09:35:00,198,"Several years back hooked into a native gill net in july several hundred pounds of mainly walleye .This was north of Nakina It was not a nice sight rotting fish floating in the net they lost. The camp owner was not happy .The gill net knows no slot limit or spieces. Basicly I feel the slots as they are now are good as other post ers have said basicly we are changing our own ways to not take anything over 20' for our one biggie its a matter of taste. To the person asked what lakes do you fish where you have to sort thru fish to get fish under 18"" do alittle diving in the files on this site and you will find a wealth of information,its why i joined to learn and to share."
1433854,Gunner_Fletch,2012-05-10 20:09:00,74,"As most fisherman/woman on here, and the one's I know don't keep anything over 18 anyway, why change the regs? If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Point by one messenger though is that every lake is different, with separate challenges. Yes....specific regulations for specific lakes we already have. Blanket policy for all On lakes- disagree! The current regulations are working. We just need all ""groups"" not to abuse their rights. You can read into that what you want. Careful what you wish for when you wish for new laws or stricter regulations. We will slowly turn into more of a communist country than the former soviet block countries. What's the next great idea.....can't shoot a buck greater than 6 points?? Give me a break!"
1433872,v-bay gord,2012-05-10 21:00:00,3168,"As Gunner points out perhaps things are not broke, so why fix it? If I was to base things on the responses so far I would say all is well....the majority of people are conservation minded. Yes, a few big fish are occasionally harvested......some intentionally, some in cases where fish just don't make it.....some through stupidity. I only brought up the topic based on some conversations that are going on right now on this topic. Thought a poll of viewers on this website might be instructional. Thank you for your thoughts on this. I have nothing to do with making any of these changes.......just happen to be interested in the fishery, just like the rest of you! .......how about no bucks harvested under 6 points???"
1434031,UKBDM,2012-05-11 09:13:00,178,... unless you are < 18 years old. Grown men should harvest does when they can't take a mature buck. I went 15 years between bucks because I wouldn't take a little one. Big deal.I better back off on this subject ... I'm just getting going.
1434086,Wawajake,2012-05-11 10:48:00,413,Leave it as is ...it ain't broke...many people are doing catch and release voluntarily anyway (including myself at times) but the odd one over is not going to break the bank . Our regulations are complicated enough don't try tweaking them further. We have cut back on MNR staff so far that they will not be able to enforce the rules we have. I would prefer if they would make native netting abuses a focus instead of the odd 21 inch fish.
1434109,briand,2012-05-11 12:03:00,48,"We're on the Winnipeg river system, and personally I like what they have in placeWalleye must be between 13.8 & 17.7 and or 1 over 27.6Now on our system I believe it's holding it's own just fine, perhaps better then many years.But this may have to do more with high price of gas and a strong cdn $"
1434127,Lovetofish,2012-05-11 12:33:00,458,"I have seen improvement in the quality and average size of walleye since the rules changed to four fish with one over 18.1"". I can't recall how many years ago it was changed, but my vote is to keep it the same."
1434266,Skywagon,2012-05-11 18:53:00,1106,"My thought would be to leave the limits as they are, but not allow any walleye to be taken across the border. This in itself would stop many of the ""over"" fish from being kept. I have friends with a camp rule, that doesn't allow guests to keep walleye over 18 inches, all walleye kept are to be consumed and not taken home. They are on a quality lake and don't have a shortage of guests. I think it is a good rule, but then I am greedy and would like to see better fishing."
1434291,FrankLeigh,2012-05-11 19:41:00,80,"As regards native netting, it is not just netting but no regard for seasons and limits, use of night lines, and spearing spawing fish. The MNR can't or won't intervene. Natives can do whatever they want.Rules are only for people who choose to obey them. That is how society works. It is also why we call people, who fish and hunt responsibily, sportsmen. Others choose not to follow rules and usually get away with it, unfortunately."
1434302,v-bay gord,2012-05-11 20:09:00,3168,"Before this turns into a netting issue thread, let's just say that what others choose to disobey, ignore, or waste, should not be a factor in the majority of sportsmen doing what is right for the resource. If you want to debate the merits of poaching, violating game laws, or even netting, then why not start a different thread. None of those issues should determine how we as sportsmen behave, and how we regulate the sportfishery."
1434305,bricken,2012-05-11 20:14:00,14,"I have mixed views on this. My group is a c.p.r group. Everyone except me, But I have NEVER kept anything over 18 cause I think the best eaters are under that. For me to keep a fish over 18 it will have to be that fish of a lifetime. Which I have not caught yet Don't get me wrong I have caught some big fish but non worthy of being next to my big deer on the wall. My group tries to talk me out of taking a big lunker home if I ever catch it. I know I will want to take it but a part of me thinks I may throw it back. But then again I would a feel cheated by getting a replica. Like I said I have mixed views. To mount a fish of a lifetime would be the only way I would want to see a fish over 18 kept. There are plenty of smaller fish out there to eat."
1433547,Obabikon,2012-05-10 09:16:00,2370,"Most of our guests wouldn't mind at all. The issue really is the 2 per day 4 total possession rule (on lake of the woods anyways). That makes it impossible to take all your walleye home, and enjoy a shore lunch on your last day. This can be fixed by making it 4/4 or adding a sauger limit... for eating purposes. 99% of fishermen are onboard with the new conservation efforts."

1433618,SinOrSwim,2012-05-10 11:27:00,1528,"We have had days on North Gull or South Gull NW of Sioux Lookout, we have had a tough time catching fish small enough to eat. Granted, we can catch some that are very small but there are just certain days everything seems to be 21"" or more. And, A LOT of 22 and 23"" with the sporadic 26 to 28"".But, usually when people say that they are still catching some 10 and 12"" fish as well."
1433627,Bigstorm,2012-05-10 11:45:00,799,"I would be against not being able to keep anything over 18"" for a walleye. Considering we are allowed 4 total in our posession with 1 being over 18"". I would be more in favor of a slot such as nothing can be kept between 18"" and 27"". Each person should have the right to mount the trouphy that they caught as long as it within the law. In our group, each person does bring their 1 back that is over 18"" but unless it is a trophy, it is always 20"" or underNortherns are a different story, where we fish now, they have a slot, nothing between 27.5"" and 35"" can be kept (numbers are from memory but I think they are close) with a posession limit of 2. Out of our group of 6 to 8 guys, there are only a couple of us that bring any northern home but most of the northern we catch are in that 30"" range with an occassional fish over 35"". Granted we dont target northern."
1433661,elway12,2012-05-10 13:21:00,335,"All good points. I would like to add that I think it is very relative to the lake/water you are fishing. Some lakes have many people/resorts fishing them hard during the open water/""summer"" seasons & some also during the winter. Other lakes are only fished in the ""summer"" and might have only one small resort on them. These are big factors to consider since the amount of fishing pressure can really dictate the overall health & sustainability of the fish population. I remember fishing Cedar Lake years ago and if you caught more than 2 15in.+ in a day you were a master angler! I believe its because that lake and the lakes connected to it have numerous resorts/fishing pressure applied to them. Though sometimes difficult, I think it would be smart to look at the area/body of water and have specific limits vs. ""one size fits"" all regulations. Just for the record I don't care if I caught a 30in walleye I would not keep it. But to catch and eat a 19-20 incher if it is still only 1 of 4 allowed is acceptable. I also know there are many resorts making/encouraging there own regulations to better serve their bodies of water for the future. I think that this is an excellent way of ensuring the lakes have enough for all of us and future generations."
1433674,Guest,2012-05-10 13:52:00,0,"I would be TOTALLY against that restriction because of two possible scenarios..... 1) I want a huge walleye on the wall....not a replica....a genuine huge skin mount. If and when I finally smack that 13# plus fish, I want to keep it. Period. 2) I like eating a bigger fish on occassion. For a grilled fish, I prefer something in the 4-5lb range. The one or two times a year I do that is pretty insignificant (I am fishing LOTW almost exclusivley up there). IN a normal trip, I will kill my 3 fish in the 16-17 range and (hopefully) take a 4-5 lb as my 'over' fish. People that say the big ones are bad eating are either jealous or bad cooks., IMO. I like eating fish - not breading....lol."
1433692,osuangler,2012-05-10 14:19:00,10,"I don't want to argue, but here is my angle. Due to work & family activities, I fish around home (Ohio) only about 4-5 times per yer (saugeye, catfish mainly). I've been to Lac Seul once (2001) and am going to Dog Lake this year with 2 of my 4 sons for the first time. Hopefully, I can begin making annual trips to Lac Seul beginning in 2013 but we'll see. I do not get many opportunities to eat a lot of wild fish but I love it when I do. So, when I catch any saugeye over 18 inches or so and it has girth, I will keep it. When I go to Canada, I want to bring back as much fish possible (and legally) so I plan to keep the 1 over. However, I have a rule and that is to throw back all wall mounts. I have caught a 9 lb largemouth bass and a 1.5 lb bream and both went back alive (well, I never keep bass anyway) and I made replicas. If I were to catch a wall mount size walleye, I would have to throw it back and order a replica. But if I were to catch a 20 incher, I am keeping it. I don't keep any pike either so that is a mute point. In all, I like the current regs as they protect the fishery, yet allow me to have a few fish sandwiches after my trip with friends & family who did not go with me.I know a lot of you guys fish much more than I do so perhaps my opinion would change with more fishing, but from a very casual fisherman, I am OK with the regs.I do reserve the right to change my opinion so I don't want this post to haunt me next year when I trade in my Rebel for a Pro V!!!!Stay safe & legal on the waters guys."
1433841,drew59,2012-05-10 19:42:00,87,My only problem with a nothing over 18 rule is that I've been on trips when I wouldn't have eaten fish a day or two if I couldn't eat a 19 or 20. Otherwise it doesn't bother me at all. The bigger fish aren't well suited for the frying pan anyhow.
1433845,Danbear,2012-05-10 19:51:00,72,"I am not for it and here is why. We always keep only under 18"" walleyes but 2 years ago fishing on Eagle lake I pulled in a 27"" eye from 35 ft of water and even though I brought it up slowly took 2 pictures and released it the fish was distressed, I held it for 10 minutes till it swam off thinking it was OK we continued fishing 10 minutes later my fishing partner says hey isn't that your fish floating over there, it was, tried reviving it again but no dice she had given up the ghost so we kept it as part of my limit, I could have left it but that didn't seem like the right thing to do with such a magnifecent fish. So thats my reason for being against a only under 18"", I believe if we all practice letting the big ones go it's better for all of us, but their are cases where it's better to keep one instead of wasting a nice fish. So I believe that option should be left open when the need arises.99 days till I hit my home away from home at Birch Dale Lodge on Eagle Lake."
1433378,orchard frank,2012-05-09 21:55:00,1900,"After 13+ years on LS, often 2-3 weeks/yr., I thing that moving the over to 27-28 would be better. Those are the rare fish. Most times, I didn't bring anything back across the border. But for those who want to, under 18 seems fair, 1 over 28 for a trophy."
1433380,btmbncr,2012-05-09 21:58:00,492,I don't care.I'm not going to keep one over 18 inches.If I want a wall mount I'll get a fiberglass replica.Bill
1433475,HighTech,2012-05-10 07:23:00,75,"I think we all can basically agree that we mostly release the over 18 fish to support the fishery and maintain it for years to come. BUT what if that theory is not correct? Some on site observations. About five years ago virtually every fish over 18 in the Red lake area was a VERY fat health solid fish. Then in the last five years aprox, virtually all of the larger walleye looked like ""tubes"" very skinny and not healthy looking. A complete loss of food? Something else? Then in the last year the over 18's seem to be gaining a bit of weight. Sioux Lookout last year larger Walleye seemed to be getting ""skinny"" just like Red Lake was. Is it possible that a ""bubble"" of 18 to 21 inch fish are dominating the fishery (like young teenagers) and taking the food. Nature will look after the ""bubble"" group in time, but is it possible that the regs are causing this type of bubble? Thats why I have no problem with one over 18. (Unless I'm wrong and this has nothing to do with it !!!)"
1433479,Bill Krejca,2012-05-10 07:30:00,6107,"The culture of keeping only big fish is slowly evolving, maybe a factor of the younger generation's willingness to let the big ones go. Many of us older fishermen, too, are changing our way of looking at what constitutes a nice stringer for pictures. That said, a lake we used to fish in Manitoba had a 22"" max limit. The lake is well known for producing more than its share of Master Angler awards. Sometimes, however, it becomes really difficult to just get enough small ones for lunch. I don't know what the answer is there. As the present law applies in much of Ontario, the one over only pertains to possession, such that 3 fishermen could keep 3 large fish every day for eating, and repeat this during the week. This just drives many resort owners crazy. My suggestion, easy to enforce, I think, would be to issue a tag for one large fish. When that tag is used, no more over 18"", or whatever, could be kept. A somewhat similar rule has been used in places, for trout, I believe. I think this would be a reasonable compromise. Those who choose to keep only smaller fish would not be affected, other than hopefully being able to catch and release more larger fish. Bill Krejca"
1433492,JayM5209,2012-05-10 07:51:00,1050,"The nonresident license with saltwater endorsement that I buy in Texas each year comes with one tag for an over-sized redfish. The keeper slot for reds is 20""-28"" and the tag allows the license holder to keep one over 28"". Seems to work fine, although I have no idea why someone would want to keep one that large. Reds in the slot, however, are excellent table fare.Re: the question of fish for eating or to bring home for a few good meals . . . . jumbo perch are plentiful in NW Ontario, and the possession limit is 50. Often the fillets from a Canadian jumbo provide as much meat as the typical keeper walleye in my home neighborhood. Enjoy finding the walleyes and figuring out how to get them to bite, maybe even catching a really big one occasionally, and enjoy the jumbo perch as table fare. In recent years my bring home fish have been one lake trout and 25-30 jumbo perch."
1433515,Mohleye,2012-05-10 08:19:00,368,"I also think some kind of tag system is the way to go for those who want to keep one fish over the slot or have one they can't revive. It gives a little flexibility without allowing a group to eat one big fish per man per day as is perfectly legal now. It's great that the younger fishermen seem to embrace conservation practices. Those of us who are a little older and grew up hunting and fishing have had to evolve, because the goal was always to bring home a limit of the biggest and best the law allowed. Growing up in the midwest from a farm background, it was pretty much expected that if you spent a day hunting or fishing (messing around) you'd better have something to show for it when you came home. My parents and grandparents lived through the depression, and they didn't waste anything or throw any fish back that had any eating potential."
1433516,v-bay gord,2012-05-10 08:20:00,3168,"Some of the discussion that I've heard from up here concerning the present system seems to deal with the anglers who keep and eat their one fish over, day after day. Not sure how widespread this is, and if it is even really an issue. One suggestion was a slot size, such as on Eagle and Lac Suel, which might curb much of that. Slots can be more complicated to get started and enforce......hence the no over 18 discussion. The idea of a ""tag"" for one fish over 18 is interesting and might work too. Perhaps the present system is working well and needs no tweeking. I do know on Eagle lake that some owners will not allow a walleye over the slot to be filleted.......some will. My personal take on the ""one over"" rule is that if you keep one over the slot that is your trophy....whether you eat it or take it home whole or filleted. I don't care for the practise, but it does not happen that often, and once it does I do ""suggest"" that walleye was the only one they get over the slot. I suppose if the regs changed it would eliminate this lodge by lodge interpretation of the rules."
1433520,HeHooksHimself,2012-05-10 08:32:00,725,"I think we should be able to keep whatever our license permits, whatever the size! You can't make me believe that four walleyes in your possession is going to negatively affect the population. Crap, the natives netted hundreds of fish each day and there are still fish for me to catch. When you get a 30"" walleye, that girl does not have much life left anyway. Use the license fee of 60 something bucks you stick us with to create a restocking program instead of fueling planes for Barney Fife to catch us with a beer in the boat. Bigger fish equals more food- I long for the days when fishermen could bring back enough fish to feed their family for a year! At least it was worth the crummy accommodations, broken down motors, mosquito bites and cracked hands that you come back with."
1433528,HeHooksHimself,2012-05-10 08:42:00,725,"Those of you who have seen my posts know I am just messing with you. We really do believe in the limits and the slots, although I really think 20"" would make my life easier. We totally respect the restrictions and it is kind of a game to get walleyes right at 18 for packing out. However, most people that I tell about our Canadian fishing that don't get it and don't even understand why we don't keep big fish and why there are limits. They think the purpose of doing this is to provide the bounty. They don't realize that the important thing about fishing is not the fish but the fishing. They don't realize that even when the fish don't bite you have the wildlife, the rocks, the trees and the water. I know that our fisheries are great because of conservation and the thrill I get when catching a big mama can be shared by others from the same fish. Seven days from now, we depart. This will be the slowest week ever!"
1433529,back357,2012-05-10 08:43:00,106,...Where are all these lakes where people can't find fish under 18 inches?????
1433205,wallydave,2012-05-09 14:11:00,2151,"Phish, all of the regs call for us to release fish that will survive, but like your post, sometimes they are not going to make it. Been there done that, don't like it at all!! If you get caught with an ""extra"" fish would the MNR give you a pass or a fine?! Any other thoughts?? Sounds like a good thread starter."
1433213,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-05-09 14:20:00,84,We have two different schools of thought in our group. We have three older guys that have been going for 35 years. They want to keep the big ones. I see them bringing in five or six pounders every year to take home. Then we have three younger guys. We only keep 18 and under. They taste better. They want some fish to bring home. Not going to change their ways unless the law changes. I would be fine with it.
1433247,Obabikon,2012-05-09 15:45:00,2370,"Instead of one over 18"", I would prefer it being one 18""-20"" walleye. What that would do, is if you caught something 18.5"" or very close to the max limit, you could keep ONE and still be save from penalty. I'm always worried about keeping fish that are right at 18"" that the officer's ruler could differ from mine. Being allowed ONE over 18 keeps me from worrying about getting two different measurements. Also, the 2 per day, 4 total needs eliminated on LOTW's if this happens."
1433258,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-09 16:29:00,1460,"When looking back at some of my old fishing pictures, I am embarrassed at the fish we killed. In my early years, it was very common for us to keep all the big fish and release the little ones. We ate and brought home a lot of big fish. We were ignorant of any fish conservation practices. I think it was the advent of the slot limits when we began questioning ourselves. My brother (Fish Nazi) shamed us into learning how to protect our fishery. It does make sense when you think of it that way and we truly have come a long way. Anymore, we don't keep any walleyes over 18"" and pretty much release every pike we catch unless the fish in question would die anyway. As far as V-bay Gord's question pertaining trophy fish goes, I'm all for eliminating a trophy harvest fish. We all have our camera's with us. When I'm in the boat with one of my boys and latch onto a biggun, the rule is to have the camera out of the case turned on and ready so the fish can be measured immediately and a few quick pictures taken and careful release. The process should take less than 30 seconds."
1433263,Guest,2012-05-09 16:50:00,0,"I would be in favour of only under 18 inch walleye and as far as pike go, the only time i fish for them is just after ice out to see if i can get a big one, for a picture, then released. On Gullrock, i have noticed most of the tourists are using cameras and releasing the big fish, and i'm sure they will tell you, the fishing is pretty darn good because of it."
1433265,Pooch,2012-05-09 16:52:00,4619,"I like the idea, but feel it needs tweaked a little.What Elway said is true. On some lakes it's hard to find a fish less than eighteen inches many days.Then again the others are also right that there needs to be a way of accounting for a larger fish that just isn't going to survive. It happens and is only occasionally the fisherman's fault.Not an easy answer here V-Bay Gord. If people were not allowed to take home one over X inches that would save thousands of older fish each season and still allow for the non-salvagable fish from being wasted.Curious to see where this thread goes as our group has always been good about not taking larger fish home if any fish at all. I suspect that there are other groups like ours who also harvest only a few to eat while in Canada.Usually the MNR gets it right. The lower limits put in place years ago have helped. Some guys crabbed about that, but it was a good long term fix that has worked. The slot on LS has helped from what I have been told.Pooch"
1433283,2746,2012-05-09 17:52:00,3206,"I like the idea and, like many others, our group never, never keeps a fish over 18"". Although there are days finding fish under 18 is dufficult we have never gone without fish to eat because we couldn't catch some small enough. We joke about it occassioanly but really.....going hungry because you can't butcher a 22 incher? Don't think so."
1433301,Moondog,2012-05-09 18:53:00,362,"I agree with Mohleye.......we know many people that take one big girl home just because they can.

It's just this arrogance that really makes me mad."

1433354,v-bay gord,2012-05-09 21:07:00,3168,"Good discussion so far. If I was to summarize the opinions so far I would say that the majority do not keep any bigger fish (over the slot or 18 inch) and would not be opposed to these ""theoretical"" proposals. This is a very big change in attitudes over the fishing careers of most ""seasoned"" anglers on this forum. I may step out on a limb and say the goal of many anglers is to have a quality fishing experience that doesn't necessarily equate to poundage of fillets in the freezer. Would still like to hear the opinions of those with other views... How would a change such as this negatively affect you? Camp operators.......would this be a negative to some of your clients?"
1432952,elway12,2012-05-09 07:50:00,335,I like the current regs. with taking one over(walleye). At the lake that we go to it is very difficult many times to catch anything under the 18. I am not saying I like seeing guys slice up a 21+ inch walleye - I ABSOLUTELY hate it. It is just many times hard to catch ALL your limit of under 18 fish. It seems at the lake we fish that there are plenty of the 18-21 inchers. Of course this is specific to this lake with only 2 small resorts fishing it. Also I know many on here fish not to eat but to catch and release which is great but for our group we only get to catch and eat walleyes once a year. I would be fine with the northern max. size limit. Just my 2 cents.
1432957,JayM5209,2012-05-09 07:58:00,1050,"Having never kept a walleye over 18"", nor a northern pike, nor a bass, I'd certainly vote for it. I don't preach to anyone about it but the two things that really wrench my gut are someone keeping a large walleye (and several guys in my regular group do) and the folks who bring a whole stringer full of 20"" pike into camp at the end of the day.. . . . . just me musing into my coffee mug. . . . . P.S. Other than a show and tell bragging session, why would ya keep an over-18"" walleye?"
1432964,GWC,2012-05-09 08:08:00,1021,We stay under the slot limit anyway but..... Pike seem to feed on walleye. I've seen some big pike hit good size walleye while we're bringing them into the boat. I would like to see the slot limit change on pike to allow larger fish to be kept. I think this would increase the walleye population. I'm ok with releasing walleye over 18 inches & we do it anyway. Take pictures and have a replica built for the trophy wall.
1432999,back357,2012-05-09 08:44:00,106,"Guys in my group have very rarely kept anything over 18 in my 12 years of fishing up north. When I say very rarely, I am thinking about 4 instances in 12 years, so I think we are doing our part. I am interested in some feedback from a biologist on the impact of such a decision. For example, what does that do to the overall walleye population if there is gradually an increase in the amount of 18+ fish vs. the amount of eaters (15-17)? Does this swing somehow negatively impact the numbers of eaters? This theory is the same with the Pike slot. I'd like to know the impact of not taking those larger pike out of the system. Bottom line on either is that as it relates to mounts, a picture and some measurements will result in a great reproduction. No need to take that fish."
1433009,3M TA3,2012-05-09 08:54:00,2846,It wouldn't bother me if I couldn't keep any however I would miss eating them once in a while. I also think the 10 to 13 inchers taste the best anyway.
1433022,tv4fish,2012-05-09 09:03:00,2694,"Back when the slot limit was introduced on Lac Seul, we were told by a conservation officer that the reason they chose the 18-21 inch slot was due to the fact that they had determined (supposedly through studies) that the females in that size (age) range produced the best ""eggs"" for survival. Kinda like we humans -- the best ""odds"" for producing healthy babies comes from younger females, not the older ones."
1433038,nitrodude,2012-05-09 09:33:00,60,"I've been going to LS and associated waters with the same group since '95 and believe the current regs have been extremely beneficial to the walleye stocks and are fine the way they are. I feel that should it need to be changed or adjusted, the MNR biologists would make that recommendation to the legislature and implement a change based on the biosphere, not anyone's personal belief or opinion on trophy status. Whatever the regs are, that's what I'll abide by. I fly in and out of Sioux Lookout, so I never keep any walleye for the trip home, but I eat my legal share of 16-18 inchers on my conservation license while on my trips."
1433065,stjoeguy,2012-05-09 10:14:00,979,"If releasing the larger fish helps keep the fish population healthy and abundant, I'm for it. I enjoy everything about the Canada fishing experience, but don't need a trophy."
1433073,erieangler,2012-05-09 10:24:00,57,"IMO the regulations in place have made an improvement to the size and numbers of walleye where I fish. The pike are another story, size and numbers have been way down in recent years. There are plenty of dock pics w/ 40+ pike up on our camps website. Have to admit, I'm guilty of harvesting a few trophies in my earlier years but have long ago found respect for the big ones. Wouldn't take one now unless it got me an igfa record. I would support gord's hypithetical if they would increase the possesion limits to say 6 under 18/27. Not everyone has good walleye fishin waiting for them at home and this would allow them to have some good eating to remember the trip"
1433200,phishfearme,2012-05-09 14:05:00,1242,"so what if you can't revive a caught/photoed trophy. should it be left to the eagles and other scavengers? i had always thought that the ""one over the slot"" was for this very purpose. phish"
1432895,v-bay gord,2012-05-09 06:51:00,3168,"For those who fish NW Ontario, what would you think of a change to current regulations that would allow no walleyes to be kept over 18 inches, and no pike to be kept over 27.5 inches? Not saying this is going to happen, but I have heard it discussed is some circles. Basically it removes the ""one over"" regulation that currently allows for a trophy harvest. Are you for it, against it, or indifferent. Opinions? Thanks...."
1432909,wallydave,2012-05-09 07:04:00,2151,"The over slot fish get the CPR (catch, photo, release) treatment with our group. Catching the bigs ones is exciting, releasing the big ones reminds us we want to catch the big ones again next trip, or give someone else the chance for the catch of their life. It takes a long time for those big ones to get big, so keep em living and growing."
1432910,HighTech,2012-05-09 07:06:00,75,Dead against it. I could offer opinions but that was not asked for..
1432912,HighTech,2012-05-09 07:07:00,75,Or was it ????
1432917,v-bay gord,2012-05-09 07:15:00,3168,For sure.......your opinion is important....
1432924,camp chef,2012-05-09 07:21:00,915,X2...We NEVER keep a fish over the slot.....Never have....never will
1432933,LOW1,2012-05-09 07:29:00,2828,"I have mixed feelings on this one. I support the two-tiered license fee approach used by Ontario. What about adding a third tier where if you want to keep a trophy fish you pay an extra $xx.xx per day or $xxx.xx per year? Or you could make it a per boat fee, where in exchange for $xx.xx per boat per day you receive a permit to keep one trophy per day for anyone on the boat."
1432936,dkrusin,2012-05-09 07:29:00,97,"Absolutely for it!! The two lakes that I fish both have the 1 over rule. However, if you get caught bringing in a walleye over 18 you will not be coming back next year. Camp owner rules and they are very serious about it."
1432947,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-05-09 07:44:00,138,I'm for it.
1432951,Mohleye,2012-05-09 07:47:00,368,"I'd be in favor.....not so much because I have a problem with someone keeping that once in a lifetime fish to mount, but because it's possible and legal currently to keep and eat one fish over the slot every day, and/or have everyone in your group keep one over the slot for take-home fish. Maybe not many keep and eat one per day, but there are still plenty of people who take one home, just because they can. Plain and simple, if we want to continue to be able to enjoy the unbelievable quality of walleye fishing that Ontario has to offer, we can't kill the brood stock. And the efforts of all of those of us who don't keep any fish over the slot can pretty easily be undone by those who want to work the current system. On one hand, I guess I wouldn't be opposed to offering a ""trophy tag"" for someone who wants to keep a fish to mount, but on the other hand, why not just get a replica made?"
