We are all getting older and need to take in what we can, while we are able. I know you will enjoy your time here when you come up next week, take care of that casting arm."

1433563,Golden Eagle,2012-05-10 09:37:00,2642,"Four that I've had fishing with me in NW Ontario have died since May 17, 2011. Two of them have been up north with me for 12 or more trips each. I'm a pallbearer for one the four this afternoon at 3 p.m. His mom was in her mid eighties and unable to walk when he took her to Little Vermilion Lake for her last trip. They stayed at an outpost with no electricity or indoor plumbing. They carried her everywhere she went and tied her to the boat seat. She was the one who hurried the rest to get out on the water every morning.Pancreatic cancer took my friend earlier this week. He was principal of the only high school in his county.Several years ago when some of the local kids were unable to afford admission to the city swimming pool, he built a rather large pool on his farm and opened it to everyone."

1433581,jambi,2012-05-10 09:58:00,504,Sorry to hear of this. Glad you had many great memories together.
1433592,Golden Eagle,2012-05-10 10:17:00,2642,"None of the four was cheated. They led good and long lives. I'll be passing on a lot of interesting stories to his sons this afternoon. They've both asked me to put them on the Ontario fishing trip list.The deceased was a graduate of Tennessee Tech University where I was coaching basketball and he never missed a conference game, even when we were on the road. I'd see him at Eastern Kentucky, Morhead State, Western Kentucky, Middle Tennessee State U., Austin Peay and Murray State, every time we played them on the road. Even when his school was shut down for a snow day, he'd make it to our game, wherever it was played."
1433599,Rich B,2012-05-10 10:35:00,1081,"Connie, When I was in college and visiting home over a weekend, my Dad and I were talking about life, and his time serving in the US Army in WWII (he was an operating room med assistant in England). My Dad said that if a man in his lifetime had (5) truly good friends, he was a blessed man. I have lost (3) good friends over the past decade, and there's not a few days that go by that I don't think of them.....and their families. You have my condolences.....I am sure your friend's family will be comforted by your presence today and sharing memories of their Dad. Faith, Family, Friends..... Rich"
1433676,Whopper,2012-05-10 13:55:00,340,Connie my condolences to you and his family. Rest assured you should take pride on the amount of people that you have coached on and off the court in your life. I'm sure and it will be welcome to hear some more of your stories of trips gone by that we will once share in the coming days while we visit your favorite fishing hole.
1433812,Pooch,2012-05-10 18:21:00,4619,"Connie,I think all of us our age have buried a lot of our friends by now. I've no doubt that those left will someday bury us. I hope I'm not last like my dad was.My dad outlived everyone of his friends and also my mom, so when it came his time he was more than ready and it made it so much easier for us boys to let him go. He was the dad and our protector even at the end.On the wall in my basement right next to my ""fishin' bench"" are pictures of past trips with my friends no longer with us. Kind of my private memorial in their honor. When I'm getting ready for the next trip I always look a them and remember. I think that every time one of my friends dies that a little bit of my heart dies with them.Stay safe and never forget them.Pooch"
1433853,lassh,2012-05-10 20:07:00,553,"Its really tough when our fishing buddies pass. Such a special bond is built from sharing the wonderful fishing experience, especially in the Canadian bush. I lost a tremendous fishing buddy a few years ago and not a day goes by during the annual Canada trip without a special thought or a toast directed to our friend. Best wishes."
1433863,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-10 20:34:00,235,Sorry for your loss. May I never take any friend's company for granted.
