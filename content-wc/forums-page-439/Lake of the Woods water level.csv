1434723,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-05-13 09:43:00,84,How.'s the water level looking on LOTW? I check the Control Board all the time and I see that the water is rising slowly. Can someone who is up that way tell me about how low the water is compared to say last June? I talked to the Lodge owners after ice out and they said it was very low. On my way in 24 days. Can't wait. Thanks
