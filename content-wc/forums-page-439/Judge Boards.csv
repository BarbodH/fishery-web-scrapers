1434064,camp chef,2012-05-11 10:09:00,915,I have no idea what a judge board is.
1434313,gramps73,2012-05-11 20:26:00,21,It is the measuring board that us tournament guys from up north use...

1434432,REG,2012-05-12 09:17:00,445,"I bought a Golden Rule Tournament board - 22"" - a long time ago. One will last you forever. I just wanted one that was long enough for the 18"" walleyes.. I think it's better and more convenient than tapes. Just set his jaw on the bent end, stretch the tail, and you're done.

My option: went to the local friendly True Value hardware store several years ago and got an aluminum 36"" yardstick. Took a piece of 1"" aluminum strap from a garage shelf and cut a 6"" piece, bent a 90 degree angle in the middle, and used a small stainless bolt to attach it to the hole already drilled in one end of the measuring stick. Total cost: less than $4. Works fine, doesn't rust, won't stretch in the rain nor shrink when it dries out!"
