1434450,Jabs,2012-05-12 11:05:00,24,I know it maybe too early but has anyone from Ojibway or others been able to go through the rags yet. Is the water level high enough?
1434567,scar,2012-05-12 19:50:00,196,good Question..........Anybody?
1434784,Guest,2012-05-13 13:36:00,0,I heard that the water is low and Anderson's boats have been going through the Rags to the outposts idling with the engine up. I suspect that some will be going through on pin by next weekend's opener. I saw a couple of boat engines hit bottom doing this on last year's opener.
1434788,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-05-13 13:57:00,84,I have no personal info on this but I believe I saw in a post earlier this week or so that there was 1.5 feet of water and there was stumps showing?
1434792,nd89sc88,2012-05-13 14:10:00,92,"From last week on my lake temps thread . . . Posted by Dragonfish: Last week I was out on Lac Seul and the water temps that I found were as follows. 46.9 degrees in the river below Pelican Falls; average of 50 degrees throughout the lake except in Japan Bay, 52 degrees; and The Rags, 55 degrees. The depth through the rags was only 1.5 feet as well. Even so, I still had to maneuver a 16' with a 20hp around the stumps below the under the water as they came up a foot or so. So I don't imagine the big boats/house boats will be going through the Rags on opener. Hope this helps. Bill"
