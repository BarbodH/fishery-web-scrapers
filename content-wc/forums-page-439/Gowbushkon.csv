1425110,heritage2008,2012-04-23 10:34:00,92,Looking for information on fishing this lake. I'm from Ohio and would like to leave the boat at home this year and find a camp away from the masses--decided not to go to Nippising for that very reason--too many camps-boats etc. This is as far (13.5hrs) as I'd like to travel and the prices seem reasonable for a housekeeping cabin/boat. Looking to locate groceries on the road and gas near this lake. Thanks in advance-please share any other lakes like this with potential good walleye numbers and no slot.

They were caught June 24 2010.We had to do a little looking as they were not in the usual spots due to higher water .But once we found them no problem getting some nice ones every day .In the week we seen at least 10 come out over 5 lb."
