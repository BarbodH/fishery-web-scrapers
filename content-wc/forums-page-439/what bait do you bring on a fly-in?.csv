1432309,Pooch,2012-05-08 05:48:00,4619,If you have AC power and access to non-clorinated water and non-clorinated ice this is what we do. Use one of the coolers that you brought your cold food in. Just get an aquarium pump from a local pet store. Get one with suction cups on it. Don't shock the minnows with a sudden temperature change and take some of the water out everyday and replace it with the same amount of clean water of about the same temperature. Keeps minnows for a long time. Close the lid as they will jump out.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...pictureid=2820A flat of crawlers should be enough. Keeping them cool is really important. Don't let guys put sick or dieing worms or minnows back in with the good ones. If they do it will surely kill off the rest of your bait supply in short order. Usually half a worm works as well as a whole one. Keep track of the half that is saved. For some reason they tend to end up under a boat seat out of reach. Shouldn't put the unused half back into the bait container either.Leeches are easier to keep as long as they are kept very cold. (Ice on the leech container in the fridge is a bit too cold) We figure a half pound per person per week. Half of that if you are also taking crawlers. Minnows on a remote trip are fragile and require constant attention. Put one guy in charge of tending the bait.Keep your bait cool in the boat and out of the sun. keeping a wet towel over a bait container helps quite a bit when in the boat. Lunch cooler with ice is better.Pooch

1432536,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-08 11:50:00,235,"We bring salted minnows. We typically bring a pound per person for our four day trip and have found that to be just about right. Bring twister tails, gulp or bungee leeches. Be prepared to bust off an average of six to seven jigs each day if you plan to vertical jig a rocky lake."

1432808,Terwalleye,2012-05-08 20:41:00,166,"Have not done a week long fly in for some time. Our group did do one day fly in's the last two years. Two years ago our boat of three guys caught 257 walleyes in 8 hours. All on 2 packs of gulp. No fish story here, we actually used a clicker to make sure we knew how many, exactly. Last year a differnt lake, not as many but the average size was much nicer (22' to 24"") Our boat with 3 guys caught 50 in one day. The camp we stay at offers free bait so we use only live bait on our lake; but for a fly in you can't beat the convinience of Gulp or prolly any piece of rubber for that matter."

1433656,new hips,2012-05-10 13:15:00,498,"acplumber, if there are otters around there gone. I bought one of those Frabil aerated minnow boxes, they work quite well, just keep them cold with some ice chunks."
