1434148,Iowa Farm Boy,2012-05-11 13:33:00,44,Our group was planning on purchasing minnows in bulk on our way to camp. Someone mentioned that there was a restriction to the number of minnows that each license holder could have in their possesion. I think the number was 120 minnows each. Has anyone been pinched for having too many minnows in their possesion?Can someone clarify this for me?
1434167,v-bay gord,2012-05-11 14:11:00,3168,"I believe that only applies to residents who are trapping their own minnows. If you are buying from a bait dealer, and have the receipt, I see no issues with having as many minnows as you want...."
1434364,north560,2012-05-12 05:10:00,53,The correct ruling is 120 minnows purchased or trapped.This is for both resident and non-resident fishermen. This is in the regs. page 10. Note if traveling north of North Bay you cannot purchase your minnows south of North Bay.
