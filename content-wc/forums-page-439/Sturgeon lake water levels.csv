1435260,JJJMN,2012-05-14 15:31:00,153,Trappers Point area camp owner say it's about 1ft higher than last fall? He did say we could launch boat in camp (which means it's about normal water level). If it was any lower we would have to put boats in at public ramp. Spawn was over 3 weeks ago so water temp must be getting up there. He didn't say what current water temp was. I'm heading up with brothers on Saturday. Always a good trip. Can't wait to hit the road.
