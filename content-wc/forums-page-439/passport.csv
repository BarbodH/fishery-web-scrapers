1433792,Rivratz,2012-05-10 17:32:00,105,"Sorry, Called you Fly, instead of fishing. Actually, DragonFly sounds like a cool name also! The Rat"
1433798,zman8701,2012-05-10 17:47:00,100,"If you use a camp boat, you are required to also carry your boating saftey check list."
1432658,jimirjr,2012-05-08 16:06:00,1149,"Make sure You declare ALL of your Beer when You cross.... even the 12 pack of ""old Style"" under the seat..."
1432662,elway12,2012-05-08 16:15:00,335,Do not use your cell while in the car or use hands free. Watch the speed limits! No using a live well/culling is a good one. Make sure to check the fishing regs. for your lake/area. No alcohol in your boat. Possession and catch limits are not seperate. Have/use only one pole/line in the water at one time per person.
1433087,Larry S,2012-05-09 11:01:00,665,"fishincrazy, You are correct on having to have the outdoors card with you. On my e-license purchased over the internet it says""The products on this e-license are not valid unless accompanied by a valid Outdoors Card,and/or license tag,and/or validation where required"" So if you buy the license over the internet you should have your Outdoors Card with you and the e-copy of your license Larry S"
1433373,Happy Camper,2012-05-09 21:44:00,22,I don't think you need a passport for Canada do you? It's mostly to get back in to the USA. Or did thay change that?HC
1433456,Rivratz,2012-05-10 06:29:00,105,"No passport, No entry in to Canada! Period! First timers, it can't be stressed enough, no alcohol in the boat. Not even one beer. It has been mentioned already. But officer, it's not open. I just was going to have it with my shore lunch. Busted and fined! You can only transport alcohol, unopened, in a boat, to a camp not accessible by roads."
1433494,Aaron-IN,2012-05-10 07:52:00,500,I crossed the border into Canada about a month ago and they never asked for my passport.
1433500,Larry S,2012-05-10 08:00:00,665,"The Canadians may not ask for a passport to enter Canada,but you will definetly need a paaport to re-enter the US. If you don't have a passport ,be prepared to to go through a lot of s##t to re-enter US"
1433514,10point,2012-05-10 08:18:00,102,"My wife is from Ontario so I have lots of experience traveling to Canada. I don't have a true passport but I have a passport card. which is only good for land travel and sea travel between the US, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Bermuda. It's about half the price."
1433555,dragonfishing,2012-05-10 09:28:00,1,"My wife and I like to travel to Minneapolis once or twice a year, usually to catch a Vikings, Timberwolves or Twins game. The weekend before last we were at Target Field and ordered a couple of drinks and they required our passports before they would serve us, our driver licenses were not accepted even with hard plastic cards, with pictures, with a hologram. Fortunately we were prepared because the year before we got stiffed on drinks at the Target Center, no passport no alcohol. Even though I am 35 lol. We just don't like having to take our passports out with us to enjoy our traditional dog and a beer at the ol' ball game. Fortunately, you will not have to provide your passport here to get served!"
1433788,Rivratz,2012-05-10 17:27:00,105,"Aaron-IN, I'm sure you had your passport with you. You alway's go to Minaki don't you? I always hand Customs my DL & Passport before they start with the questions. Saves time from fumbling around. Dragonfly, can't believe they do that to you at the sports arenas."
1432241,BennieS,2012-05-07 21:05:00,108,"Just saw this within a great list for things to bring to Canada. ""small dry bag for boat to keep passport, camera etc dry on boat""I'm going for the first time. Does a guy need to carry his passport with him when he's traveling around and even in the boat?Thanks in advance for advice."
1432251,Larry S,2012-05-07 21:27:00,665,"Keep your passport in your cabin,in the boat all you need is your fishing license."
1432254,BennieS,2012-05-07 21:36:00,108,"Thanks Larry. That tip stunned me for a moment but hey, I don't know how things work in Ontario. Anyone have any tips on things that'll get you in trouble there unknowingly. Not crime type things because I don't roll that way but little nuances of Ontario law that could trip a guy up."
1432257,fishincrazy,2012-05-07 21:46:00,1282,UM Outdoors card too right?????FC
1432378,erieangler,2012-05-08 07:35:00,57,"Radar detectors and hand guns illegal up there. Also don't forget to leave some skin on any fillets you are bringing back. Keep them easily accessable for inspection. We've been checked several times on the way home..oh and seat belts, everyone must wear them, not just front seat passangers like here in ohio"
1432391,10point,2012-05-08 07:56:00,102,I thought this was the case. We did this last year.
1432512,Shotgun,2012-05-08 11:08:00,759,Something that caught me by surprise first time fishing in Canada is - some lakes you cannot keep fish live in your livewell. The fish you keep must be dead and most fisherman put them on ice.
1432556,wallydave,2012-05-08 12:22:00,2151,"Lac Seul is one of those lakes, no live fish, not counting minnows, in the boat. If you are stopped, be prepared for a fine. We started to follow some advise posted last year. Take your keeper fish, hold them down, pull back on the top of the jaw until you feel the spine break. Yea its kind of gross the first time or two, but its quicker than beating them over the head with a club. The camp boats don't have power to the livewell, if you bring your boat some folks use the livewell for bait, others to keep their non-alcoholic drinks cold. No beer in the boat!"
1432644,NARDA 1,2012-05-08 15:43:00,636,Make sure you check the fishing regulations for your specific lake. Some have slot limits and some don't allow night fishing.
1432657,Shotgun,2012-05-08 16:02:00,759,"Wallydave, Been fishing Minnitaki for several year but am tying Lac Seul this year. I'll have to try the spine break vs. hitting them. My fishing partner will be happy as one time when he was holding a fish and I went to hit it the fish moved, I missed and hit his hand. We got some good laughs out of that after he cursed for about five minutes!!"
