1451187,10point,2012-06-19 10:00:00,102,I just stayed at shining tree camp next door to bay wolf. I was looking for something cheap and I found it and had a good time also. Shining tree camp is only $150 per person if you have 3 or more and kids 16 and under I think it is are free. I took my son and a couple of friends so my cost was only $150. Boats and motors are extra but I took my own boat and fished a couple of other lakes also. We didn't really care what we caught and fished for smallies mostly as they were biting. Got some really nice ones. If you are renting a boat Bay Wolf might be a good deal since they will get you on some of the back lakes I believe.
