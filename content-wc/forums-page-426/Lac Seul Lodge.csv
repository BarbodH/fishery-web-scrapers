1449240,Guest,2012-06-14 09:39:00,0,Just talked to Dan McDonald at Lac Seul Lodge. Dan sold the lodge in April. What a great loss he was by far one of the best places to stay year after year. He will be missed. Hope the new owners are close to as good.
1449271,DaBullz,2012-06-14 10:50:00,12,"We just got back from Lac Seul Lodge. The new owner is a fantastic guy who gave every indication he had no intention to change anything of substance.Dan was still doing some work around the camp while we were up. It appeared he is doing everything he can to get the new owner up to speed. The new owner was a frequent guest at LSL over the years so he knows how well Dan ran the place, how great the experience is at LSL, and most importantly, it's getting guests on the best walleye fishery around that's the main purpose of the camp."

1449546,JDP,2012-06-14 21:47:00,1457,Sorrry to hear Dan is getting out of the business apparently.He truly was an excellent owner/operator!
1449547,DaBullz,2012-06-14 21:53:00,12,"I've fished Lac Seul a several times. I am a novice fisherman, so take what I say with a grain of salt. There are many folks on this forum who have fished LS dozens of times and are far more experienced than I in general.This much I can tell you: when you are on fish, and the bite is on, there are few fishing experiences like Lac Seul.First things first. At Lac Seul Lodge, you will find a sparkling clean cabin, a fabulous boat, and an amazing staff of folks who will immediately do everything they can to make your stay amazing. You will have no worries as far as the facilities or boat.Here's a warning - Lac Seul is humbling. Many rocks and obstacles. I'd suggest you invest in Navionics map. I use my iPhone for a GPS - works great. The Navionics map of Lac Seul has the primary danger points marked. It's VERY helpful. Be careful - especially immediately around islands and exposed larger rocks. I've bought a couple of props and a skag.The fishing can be great in the first couple of bays. Many folks don't even venture out on the big lake. However, not sure fishing Lac Seul is quite the same if you don't explore a bit. I haven't fished the lake during late June so I can't tell you where you'll find fish however there will many folks who can tell you on this forum and also at the lodge. I used a guide the first couple of days the first couple of trips - a great investment. We generally solely vertical jig. We use minnows, but also have leeches, we've experienced several instances when a switch to leeches turned the bite on.Good luck - Lac Seul is amazing, I fell in love the first time up and have gone 5 times in the last 3 years."
1449671,worthsr,2012-06-15 09:42:00,52,"I'll be at Lac Seul lodge the last week of June too, saying farewell to Dan at the end of the week. He's a great owner/operator that's always treated us well. Advice for Sammy - This might be our 14th year at LSL, and almost always we've stayed the last week of June. I second DaBullz advice, get a GPS and buy the map chip. Because it is your first time I also agree with hiring a guide the first couple days. Set it up now, it's worth the money. We spent a lot of time jigging vertically back in the day, but now we troll spinners more then anything. We cover a lot more water and catch a lot more fish. We only fish one week a year and aren't the greatest fishermen either. Dan sells some Klass Walleye catchers in the office, we like the ones with the steel line. Buy a few and some 3/8 ounce bead chain weights too. Typically we find the Walleyes shallow on the weed edges, in the timber or on the wind blown side of a rocky point or island. The mud line can be an outstanding producer too. We stay at the outpost, but have fished the main lodge area too. There's good fishing close by and you'll have a great time. If you don't mind a little boat ride and are seeking adventure ask Dan about The Bay of the Islands, the big and little sand banks and a trip up to Sunlight. Lac Seul is an amazing fishery and one of the most beautiful places you will ever see. Best of luck, Scott"
