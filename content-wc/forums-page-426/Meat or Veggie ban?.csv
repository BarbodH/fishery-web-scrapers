We were late in the day to cross back and we were warned that MNR have set up some sort of checkpoint somewhere between the causeway and the border in Ft Francis. Being that it was so late in the day and we had planned to still get our fished iced down and stay the night in Eveleth, we did not want a border shakedown. When I pulled up to the border officer gal, I was expecting to answer the same ole questions as where we from, where we been, how long etc. Instead, she asked me if I'm taking any fruit across. Wow, I packed the cooler with the left over fruit salad from camp. I tell her, yup, I got fruit, mostly bought in Canada. We go back and forth about this fruit salad and now I'm fully expecting to get the pull over and bend over while we inspect your vehicle's contents. Instead, she just waves me through."
