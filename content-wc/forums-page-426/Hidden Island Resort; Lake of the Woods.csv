However I don't know anything about Hidden Island Resort.Did a search of this message board, however, did not come across any information since March of 2008. So, hopefully someone has stayed there since it apparently has come under new ownership.ThanksBob"

The ""new"" owners run/ran a hotel/resort in Baudette called the Royal Dutchmen. I suggest you run the search. Bill Krejca"
1082970,Obabikon,2009-02-23 06:25:00,2370,"The new owners purchased it from Don Larson after it was closed for a couple years. Last year was their first season doing it. It's a very nice location. I can't say much about the acomodations, as I haven't been on the island in several years. However, when Don had it, many people considered it ""rough"". Hidden island is just a few miles from me, if he has any serious questions, feel free to PM."
1082972,Obabikon,2009-02-23 06:27:00,2370,"Here's there website...http://www.hiddenislandresort.com/ (as Bill said, they have the Royal Dutchman also)"
1211158,Guest,2010-06-17 21:39:00,0,"I have been to Hidden Island twice since Doug and Marilyn purchased it. It was great last year and better this year. I used to drive to Flin Flon in Manitoba every year, but since going here, I will never go back to Flin Flon. Last year I caught a 54 inch Muskie, 29 inch walleye, 18 inch Small Mouth and my buddy caught a 42 inch Northern. Tons of fish, all within sight of the island. This year we went back and I caught a 38 inch Norther, and my buddy caught a 41 inch Muskie. The cabins were good last year, but better this year. They work their tails off, and Doug came out and showed us some good spots when he got a slow down with his work. I can't say enought good about Doug and Marilyn. You wont be dissapointed."
