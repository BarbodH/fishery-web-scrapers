And do you put a ""Mr Twister"" style plastic grub on the jighead with a worm/leech or just a worm/leech. We've mainly been trolling with bottom bouncer floating jigheads recently and haven't vertical jigged in quite awhile. Last time we did we used your standard round jighead with a Twister tail and worm. Planning on doing a lot more jigging this year since we're going to a different lake for the first time in 10 years...so just wondering if that's the preferred method here? thanks"
1450829,tv4fish,2012-06-18 15:31:00,2694,"Villain: I think most guys will agree that you should use the lightest jig possible when you vertical jig. Personally, I do not add any plastic to my live bait on a jig. I think the action of a minnow or leech or crawler is sufficient w/o adding any plastic when you're jigging."
1450841,Bitinlight,2012-06-18 15:44:00,95,"I prefer a round jig head in 1/8, 1/4, or 3/8 depending on depth. I like the Cabela's round live bait jig head which has no collar or barb on the collar to hold the plastic on. I prefer to tip it with a minnow, but 1/3 crawler, or leech, or Gulp or Trigger X works well too. The live bait jig gives whatever you put on there more action, especially live bait. You can put a twister on and tip that with live bait, but I don't think you need all of that on there."
1450943,hommer23,2012-06-18 19:12:00,523,"I like the lindy jigs or a round ball. If I fish with plastics I use a twister tail or 3.5"" shimmy shad. If I use live bait minnow, leech or crawler I cut a twister tail body in 3/4"" to 1"" pieces and thread up the shank of the hook then put the live bait on the hook. Doing so provides a soft spot for the fish to bite on so they hold bait longer or deeper in thier mouth. Wieght depends on depth and current."
1451118,Mohleye,2012-06-19 08:02:00,368,"I use twister tail with bait, and I'm not sure I'd call what we spend most of our time doing ""vertical"" jigging. We are usually backtrolling, or drifting if the wind is right, which requires a jig heavy enough to stay in contact with the bottom, usually 1/4oz. The presentation is not vertical, but more like a 45 degree angle."
1451123,villain189,2012-06-19 08:09:00,33,Awesome. Thanks for the great replies. I know it's a basic question but helps to get specific advice from guys who are experienced catching fish vertical jigging. I'll definitely use the tips and advice and post a trip report when we get back!
1451169,new hips,2012-06-19 09:26:00,498,"The more times I go to Canada, the more basic I get..........Usually I use a lindy rig with maybe 1 oz walking sinker and 4lb Fireline(that will get me down easy 20-30 feet), with either a frozen minnow or half crawler. Same rig with a floating jighead, start with a 6ft snell and keep shortening it until your in the zone. Once we find fish, you can work them over with vertical jigging. I use 4lb Fireline with a small swivel and about 18in of Florocarbon and usually a round 1/4 oz jig with the same bait. Boat control is a must, always backward.......keeping your jig almost vertical. Line diameter is probably the most important factor........hard to beat the strength and diameter of Fireline."
1451217,villain189,2012-06-19 11:02:00,33,Sounds like almost exactly what we plan to do. Backtroll with bottom bouncers and floating jigheads and then drift/anchor and jig them. Usually use 4lb or 6lb fireline as well. Is it necessary to use a fluorocarbon leader or can we tie the jighead directly to the fireline? Actually would be more convenient to use a small snap swivel that way we could quickly change between presentations using the same pole. We always have a ton of floating jigheads rigged up to toss on there so we could rig up regular jigheads as well in the same way. Tie on a two way barrel swivel and snap them on/off quickly.
