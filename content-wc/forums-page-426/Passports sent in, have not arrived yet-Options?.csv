1447678,Slugchucker,2012-06-11 10:07:00,5,"Two passport situations for any of you that have frequently crossed the border. 1: My wife and I have valid passports, we have three sons ages 16, 14, and 12. The two youngest can get through on birth certificates. The oldest child just turned sixteen in May and does not have a passport. We thought he needed one at 18, found out it is 16 years old. Will we be able to get him through with just his birth certificate? He was in Canada a couple years ago with us when he didn't need the passport.#2: Passports were applied for end of May, leaving the States June 30th. Have application numbers from the passport status website but am worrying about receiving them before we leave. Do custom officials check or call in to check status of passports if they are somewhere in the postal system when we need to depart? Obviously don't want to hold up a trip waiting for passports!thanks!"
1447683,Golden Eagle,2012-06-11 10:16:00,2642,"If you head into Canada without the passport, I suggest checking with U.S. officials before crossing into Canada to determine if you'll be allowed to enter the U.S. upon return."
1447710,NARDA 1,2012-06-11 10:51:00,636,Contact both sides of the border where you plan to cross and ask what your options are. Make sure you make note of who you talk to.
1448521,tiz,2012-06-12 19:02:00,18,"What I have heard from both the Mexican border and the Canadian border in regards to our Immigration folks is they will remind you of the importance of getting the proper paperwork (passport) in this case and there will not be a problem. Make sure his little brothers don't tell the officer they have no idea who this dude is and he should be detained forever.... Forgot to add, 22 years as a cop and do you think I ever want to end a day with some 16 year old that isn't mine and I have to find something to do with him."
1448524,bellbuoy,2012-06-12 19:18:00,490,Did you expedite the passport request by paying extra?
1448594,Slugchucker,2012-06-12 22:29:00,5,My sons was expedited. The other two are family friends going along and were not expedited.
1448791,erieangler,2012-06-13 10:43:00,57,Some states offer enhanced drivers lic that are acceptable for crossing both ways. Maybe something worth checking into
1450432,Slugchucker,2012-06-17 19:00:00,5,"All passports have arrived. It took about three weeks from application time to have them in hand. Interestingly, the expedited one arrived four days prior to the two that were not expedited."
1450487,NARDA 1,2012-06-17 21:59:00,636,Glad you got them in time! Have a great trip.
