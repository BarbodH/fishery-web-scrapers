If it gets twisty, I'll sometimes use a swivel to connect the braid to the fluorocarbon, but I'd rather not. I love the no-stretch aspect of the braid. Unbelievably sensitive and no worry about getting a good hook set in deeper water. Bill"
1451687,Pezman38,2012-06-20 10:23:00,3196,I still use mono and just retie when it begins to twist. I normally only retie due to line twist 5-10 times while fishing daily in canada for a week. I like to retie anyway to check for abrasions so this doesn't bother me. I think many use 6lb-8lb fireline and tie on a mono or flouro leader of slightly smaller test.
1451713,NathanH,2012-06-20 11:05:00,697,I started using sufix 832 tied right to the jig. No problems. I dont think you need a leader with this stuff maybe I'm wrong but unless were dealing with super clear water I think the return is hard to see. I used be be a mono guy but I cannot go back the feel the hooksets are so much better.
1451474,nd89sc88,2012-06-19 20:01:00,92,"Actually my question is about vertical jigging vs pitching jigs. I have done a fair amount of back trolling with jigs, and pure vertical jigging, but very little pitching jigs . . . So the question is, what's the depth where vertical jigging or trolling is no longer effective? 10 feet? If they are under 10, then pitch jigs at them?BTW: I'm going to be fishing Lac Seul so it's stained water . . .Thanks,Bill"
1451485,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-19 20:26:00,235,"We have caught many walleyes in five feet of water vertical jigging while backtrolling, motor on. This was on a stained water lake. I would say less than five feet then pitch."
1451517,stillangling,2012-06-19 21:58:00,149,"This is one that makes me scratch my head. Sometimes it seems that they really want a jig that is pitched even when you are in 20' of water. I think that a pitch results in a much different presentation. Sometimes they really react to a jig that is just dragged along the bottom, combined with a subtle twitch as opposed to a vertical jigging action. Not sure if they just want a less agressive presentation or they are keying in on something that is acting like whatever prey they are eating at the time. I am not an expert on Lac Seul but it is a lake that I have done very well on by pitching right up on the rocks or into open patches of water in cabbage beds. My guess is that you are going to find the fish deeper than that though. We are ahead of normal conditions in NW Ontario and fish are moving into a summer pattern. The magic depth for me this weekend was 28' but that was on LOW and they tend to be deeper there."
1451538,Bill Krejca,2012-06-20 05:30:00,6107,"I'll take a maybe different approach to vertical vs pitched. I particularly like to fish vertically over extreme snag filled rocks. I find I can keep the jig in the bite zone longer without having to take as much time to retie due to getting snags. In some places where I vertically fish I have found it almost impossible to try pitching for any reasonable length of time. I also feel I get more fish fishing vertically when the fish are in a less aggressive mode - just a case of being able to hold the jig's position longer than when doing a pitch retrieve. I really haven't much considered depth as a determining factor as to method used. Clarity of water perhaps may be a consideration, as well as how much the fish in that water are worked over in the course of a normal day of fishing. I sort of consider vertical fishing as just real slow trolling, only maybe with a bit more finesse, as I normally more constantly adjust the amount of line out, watching the depth finder all the time, and try to maintain the jig's position just off the bottom, rather than bouncing it along the bottom. At least, that's the way I see it. Bill Krejca"
1451554,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-20 06:20:00,235,"I too find that pitching jigs in the rock-filled lakes of Canada results in too many snags. There's a bit more control you have vertically to be able to ""lift"" the bait out as soon as you feel a rock."
1451556,nd89sc88,2012-06-20 06:20:00,92,"All interesting comments. Thanks guys. You are definitely giving me more to think about. I had always assumed pitching jigs was a function of water depth, but it certainly is a very different way to present the bait to the fish. Never even thought about it in 20 feet of water . . . my only real experience pitching jigs is onto shallow, rocky banks for smallmouth in my home lake in NW WI (where walleyes are so scarce they isn't worth fishing for). Looking forward to getting to LS (11 days and counting) and trying some new techniques. Bill"
1451557,octanehi5,2012-06-20 06:24:00,1104,"We usually set out the drift sock, drift and jig, we have caught fish like this in 42' of water to 3'. If we anckor we pitch and retreave. Weight of the jig means alot in what ever depth your in. A good rule of thumb is not to let your line get more than 45* from the boat, being straight up and down is 90*. gives you better hookups, we have spent yrs doing this not hrs."
1451570,tv4fish,2012-06-20 06:47:00,2694,"Our most effective presentation for catching walleyes on Lac Seul is vertical jigging. Through the many years we have fished there, we have tried many different methods (I live on Mille Lacs and I assure you vertical jigging is NOT the best way to fish Mille Lacs). We have found that once you locate the depth that the walleyes are in where you are fishing - that's the depth to ""work"". I use my kicker motor to ""slide in and out"" as we drift over the area, while trying to stay at the depth where the fish are. As said above - the rock crevices are what you need to be careful with, as they will ""suck"" your jig right into them. Our presentation is to drop the jig until you hit bottom, then lift it slowly to stay off the bottom and then continue that pattern. Works for us."
1451582,Bitinlight,2012-06-20 07:06:00,95,"So much has to do with boat control which is really related to what the wind is doing. Whether shallow or deep, you have to keep the boat on the fish or near the fish. With that said, I use either vertical jigging or pitching to stay on the fish the best. Both work depending on the conditions. Sometimes, back trolling into the wind on a school of fish you hardly are moving at all, thus, you are really vertical jigging. This works in just about any depth except under the 5 or 6 foot depth. The shallower it is seems to make pitching work better. If the fish are in 2-5 feet, it seems to work better to have the boat deeper and pitch to the fish in shallow water. I prefer vertical jigging but sometimes pitching is better. Jig weight also factors in."
1451676,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-20 10:06:00,235,"On a side note, what type of line do people recommend for vertical jigging? I use mono and don't like the line twists/memory. Looking for something that doesn't get all twisted up."
