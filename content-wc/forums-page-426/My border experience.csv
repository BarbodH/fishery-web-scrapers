1450753,10point,2012-06-18 13:52:00,102,I have crossed the border many times as my wife is a canuck. Going up fishing last week I was told by the border lady I needed a letter from my wife allowing me to bring my son. I was told I wasn't suppossed to have over 2 cans of gas and I had 5. I was expecting to pay a tax on it but I didn't have to like last year. I was also told I wasn't allowed to bring my bear spray. After all this they let us go through and didn't make us get rid of anything. My friend left his passport at the camp. On the way back he gave the border person his drivers license and explained. They asked some questions and let us through.
