The host was mostly targeting pike and bass for the most part. We had a blast catching plenty of fish.However in the evening he said let's go fly-fishing for walleye. We have some of the finest trophy walleye fishing anywhere, but everyone uses spinning rods. So the host, Colin McKeown grabbed a 9-weight with sinking like and a leech pattern and within minutes was into 25-26 inch fish. It ended with a 30 inch 12-pound monster.All of this of course (and luckily) was being filmed and will make it to the TV show in the fall. But I have to say it was pretty cool seeing a 12 pound walleye being caught on a fly-rod.Here is a picture of his 30-incher.Enjoy.Fisherman Ted"

Hope the show brings you some fly fishing guests! By the way Ted.......I spent a day at your location years ago (other owners) and was impressed with the location, the resort and the fishing opportunities. It was unique."
