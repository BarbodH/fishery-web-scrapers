1449729,tilldawg,2012-06-15 12:07:00,55,We call them saber-toothed sand nats in the south. They are so bad at times down on Florida Gulf coast that you do not venture out at dusk or dawn. Good thing is they do not bother you during the day or after dark.
1449865,3M TA3,2012-06-15 19:44:00,2846,"Sorry, but these gnats don't bite Canadians."
1450531,Perch Slayer,2012-06-18 07:12:00,7,"Thanks everybody for all of your advice with these little ba*tard*, with all of this new information, next year it's going to be ""game on"" with these no-see-ums before I ever get out of the truck to launch the boat on day one. Appreciate everybody's input on this again."
1451226,octanehi5,2012-06-19 11:20:00,1104,"How do you know there Canadian, wearing hockey helmits?? Set of wings with teeth"
1448837,briand,2012-06-13 12:09:00,48,They are like a flying tooth
1448842,wallydave,2012-06-13 12:21:00,2151,"Their bite is oversized compared to the size. Tiny things with a big bite! One year in late June they were out in force, I had some warm weather hunting pants with mesh panels behind the knees, those little suckers were feasting on those spots!! The forecast next week looks cool and rainy, hopefully no noseeums! !!"
1448916,chevtow,2012-06-13 15:12:00,691,"They love me so much , I don't wear shorts or short sleeve shirts while on shore. I spray 3 sets of clothes with Permethrin a few days before we leave, and wear those whenever I'm not on the boat. They are fishing shirts and pants , so they are not really hot, thank god."
1449014,Campcountry,2012-06-13 20:02:00,164,You need 95% to 100% Deet for noseeums. Can't buy that in Canada so bring it up with you. In Canada we only have 30% Poofter Deet...Band Aid anti itch gel works as does Afterbite. Do they still sell Absorbine Jr.? That worked well but stinks like h*ll!The noseeums are usually gone by mid July in the Kenora / Minaki area. They may be gone already this year. I got bit like crazy 10 days ago when I was out and not at all the last couple of days.
1449146,Bob_Loblaw,2012-06-14 06:40:00,109,"From what I've read, Deet concentrations above 50% do not provide any additional protection, but may have some health risks. Just throwing that out there."
1449153,Campcountry,2012-06-14 06:56:00,164,"Deet over 50% doesn't provide any extra protection against mosquitoes but it sure does against noseeums. 100% deet also will heal all of your cuts and gashes from handling pike. It can cause you to grow a third arm however which can be annoying In my experience, you don't feel noseeums bite initially but you will itch like crazy for 10 days after - way more than a mosquito bite. If you think you will wait until after you are being ""attacked"" before putting on repellent you will be too late."
1449238,JayM5209,2012-06-14 09:33:00,1050,Here's the information from the Centers for Disease Control re: insect repellants and DEET greater than 50%.http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbo...arthropods.htmP.S. I use Deep Woods OFF with 98.25% anyway!
1449444,Walleyeski,2012-06-14 17:13:00,40,"Those creatures love me! The best spray I've found is Ultrathon, it's made by 3M. Band-Aid Anti-Itch Gel is the best relief. Afterbite works but not as good as the Band-Aid stuff. Was lucky this year, no-seeums weren't out yet or I was to far north."
1449453,MorganMan,2012-06-14 17:54:00,341,"Don't know about the Deet levels, but if you do get bitten, use what works for you. Many anti itch products (topical) have either diphehydramine or better yet, hydrocortisone. If something works for you, use it. I recommend hydrocortisone over diphenhydramine as a topical because a corticosteroid is better in my opinion. You can get 1% hydrocortisone over the counter in the states (or 0.5%, but what's the point) or you can get a 2.5% by prescription.....ask your Dr if you have that relationship, it may be worth it. You can also use ORAL Benadryl (diphenhydramine) or Zyrtec (cetirizine) over the counter to help systemically with the urge to itch. These are both antihistamines. Zyrtec you take once daily and Benadryl you take every 4 to 6 hours. Zyrtec is LESS likely to cause drowsiness (but still can) and Benadryl will more than likely cause drowsiness (it's the PM part of Tylenol PM). If you get bitten so bad you have trouble sleeping, take an antihistamine along with your topical choice. Different people react differently to oral meds so they may make you drowsy or not?? There are also stronger steroid creams that are prescription available from your Dr.....might be an option too! Spray the screens with bug spray and I guess that is why the burning coils are usually found in the window sills?? Beer help you forget!"
1449541,Campcountry,2012-06-14 21:29:00,164,"The article states ""Studies suggest that concentrations of DEET above approximately 50% do not offer a marked increase in protection time against mosquitoes."" which is what I was saying earlier. They are just referring to mosquitoes and noseeums are very different than mosquitoes. You need the high-test stuff to stop them."
1448716,Perch Slayer,2012-06-13 08:53:00,7,"For the last two years we've been plagued by these little, I mean tiny, gnats that bite and leave little red welts (much smaller than mosquito bites) on the skin that itch like a mother. Just wondering what these little *******s are, what can be done to keep them off a person, and what kind of treatment can a person use after the fact. Took over two weeks last year after we got back to really heal up and the ones on the legs drove us the most crazy... NW Ontario is where we've encountered these critters."
1448728,v-bay gord,2012-06-13 09:05:00,3168,no see-ums. They love me too. A little bug spray will keep them away.
1448730,RapShad,2012-06-13 09:13:00,76,Make sure you hit up your ankles and wrists with the bug spray. No see ums can be a b****
1448734,stjoeguy,2012-06-13 09:14:00,979,"Yeah, no-see-ums are the worst. I haven't tried it, but people say Skin So Soft keeps them away. Hydrocortisone anti-itch ointment is part of my Canada kit for bites."
1448743,deputy dog,2012-06-13 09:29:00,305,Are these same as black flies?
1448748,tv4fish,2012-06-13 09:34:00,2694,Definitely NOT the same as those black biting flies - they take a chunk out of your skin.
1448754,Blue Lk,2012-06-13 09:46:00,269,"These little SOBs are small & can come through window screen,if they are in season I spray my screens with Raid before going to bed,by the time you feel the first itch,several have allready had their way with you."
1448772,Jigger1,2012-06-13 10:06:00,234,"One of the huge benefits of wearing head to toe sun protection is the fact that bugs have almost become a non-factor. When I used to wear shorts or short sleeves, I'd get bit up bad, now I wear convertible pants with sun protection and long sleeves so no more bugs. This layer is so thin that even on hot days I'm more than comfortable. I still spray my hat on occasion and that seems to help out with the flies. My buddy get's bit up something fierce from no-see-ums. They are buggers!"
1448778,a3dad,2012-06-13 10:24:00,115,Try AfterBite to help ease the itch. Hate those buggers!
1448807,octanehi5,2012-06-13 11:06:00,1104,pump spray 98% deet there is nothing betterto keep them off of you
