This is only our 2nd time going, so we learned a lot last year in areas to fish this time around. We never made it that far from the lodge last year and I believe our best area was Lunker Pt. Would it be in our best interest to make the trip to MacKenzie Bay this year to try it out? Any fishing reports would help fuel the excitement.Thanks"

We struggled with clam bright sunny days while other groups in the camp did exceptionally well with differnt tactics. They cast shap rap type baits shallow and we tried jigging. With a chop things might have been different for us. By July everything could change. Pat & Gary wil have the updated info when you get to camp. Have fun and be careful.
