There were a few a small things(coffee pot, door handle) that were repaired on the spot. The camp owner/part time comedian threw an unannounced pig roast for the campers in mid week quite a treat. Our group of 12 looked like a MASH unit this year. The knee and hip surgery (4 total) guys had their gear picked up and delivered to the boat everyday, The camp is far enough away from Dryden and down a very long dirt road so it has a remote feel. Our dock hand Jordan had everything else dialed in. Boats were wide with fishing decks and 40HP motors. Just a great camp, and the price was hard to beat.As for the fishing, conditions made it tough, not the lake. Four days of rain/sleet and wind. Boat control was almost impossible. Winds between 12-20 mph with gusts to 30mph. You could find protected areas, but getting to them was tough. The bilges in the boats got a work out. The mayfly hatch was going pretty good when we arrived. Still the first day we all caught enough fish for a 12 person fish fry. Caught all of them off points and rock shoals coming off of islands. When the weather hit we went to the smaller lakes off the main lake. Did not have very good luck there. Lots of small pike, but we did find some great, perch spots. The perch are plus size here. Lots of 11""-13"" and two at 14"". However, we are here for the walleye. We talked to everyone in camp and I reached out to the WC community. Fished hard for two more days, but the weather again had everything stirred up. Finally on our last day, we changed tactics. No more rock points. With the mayfly hatch in full bloom we moved to the weed edges. Wish we would have changed tactics a few days earlier. Instead of running the bilge we ran the live well. Our boat caught over 40 keepers on one spot. They were shared with the other boats and everyone had a limit going home. Thanks to WC members for the suggestions on where to fish this week. Great input, from everyone helped save the trip. We have other lakes we like better, but at this point I am not sure if we gave this lake a fair chance. We caught fish the first and last day in reasonable weather, and once we figured out the mayfly (our first) stategy we did great. All options are open for next years trip. Going to be a fun winter of research."

I am not the best boater so anytime the wind kicks up some white caps I typically stay ashore. So far I haven't lost too many fishing days, but my trips are in July when the weather is somewhat more stable. It's great to find those jumbo perch too! I haven't found them in too many places so far, but they are great to eat. I probably would have stayed at that spot for a limit of those myself. What tactic did you use at the weed edge? Just jigging meat/grubs or bucktails?? I always try to be prepared for an unexpected mayfly hatch"
1450331,packpro,2012-06-17 12:43:00,695,"We looked for green weeds bent over at the surface. Just outside or those we found more traditional weed habitat. Typically in 5-7 FOW. The best areas were in narrow inlets to bays off the lake. The spot was very defined in a small area, maybe 15' x 15'. Made several slow drifts, controlling the boat with the outboard in and out of gear. 1/4 oz jigs with minnows, orange was the hot color this day. Subtle jigging, without losing contact with the bottom. Good luck on your trip."
