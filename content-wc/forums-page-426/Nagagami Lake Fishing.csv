I've read a couple of articles that talked about a weed bed in the east basin that's far offshore in 8-12 FOW. Now, I have looked at several maps and satellite images and for the life of me have no clue what they are talking about.Anyone that's fished the lake know what I am referring to? Is it that shoal that's in the center of the lake where the east and west sections of the lake divide (south of Chuck's Point)? Is it one of these two spots on the linked map?http://i481.photobucket.com/albums/r...-1-weedbed.jpgThanks."

Not a lot of success so far, but know that many have had luck there in the past. Each year we were there the fish had come off of that area. We caught most of our fish last year in the bay where the Foch river is located. From Debbie Island to the mouth. We had an East wind all week. (3rd week of June). The year before we found fish off of Chucks and NE of Twin island. That area has shallow reef that we fished around with good success that year, same week."

1451146,buckeyedan,2012-06-19 08:54:00,44,"Hi guys, I've been out of the loop for a while. Sent you a PM, adempsey. Looked at your map. The weedbed and ledge that we typically fish is more to the right on the map (NE on the lake). The contor line that runs between the ""d"" in weed and ""b"" in bed in the text that you added is roughly where we fish. Weeds are at the top of the ledge in 8-10 feet of water, and there is a sharp drop down to 20-25 (some places even 30) feet. The ledge is steeper in some places and more gradual in others, but it does run roughly from Chuck's point all the way down into Nagagami bay. The shallow area that your top arrow is pointing to is more like 10 feet deep, and we have caught some fish out there as well. It's kind of a ""sunken island"", with some structure and pretty steep ledges all around. It's always been a bit of a ""hot or cold"" place for us. You will either catch a bunch, or nothing, in our experience. Hope this helps. I'm back in the loop now, and would be glad to give any additional insight. If we don't talk before you leave, good luck to you!"

Nice to get some fresh info! I'll probably reconsider going to that sunken island now, unless it's on the way to somewhere else I am headed to."
