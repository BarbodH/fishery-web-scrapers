Talked to Jody, she gave us a tour of the cabins and boats. She was very nice and the boats were great. How's the smallie fishing in the area? Thanks"

Cabins are decent, but may have the occasional mouse. We don't really target smallmouth but catch plenty while walleye fishing. The Snake Bay area is also very good for Largemouth."

Lots of largemouth to target though. Go in the back bay from white pines and target lay downs and weeds. Frogs really good early and late. Walleye are a challenge in snake bay. It's got some area yu can target. Look for points and rocky shores. Fish early and late. You can catch pike all day there. For more SM action, target Russell island just out of snake bay. Look for boulders. They rove in packs. Hope this helps. Nick"
