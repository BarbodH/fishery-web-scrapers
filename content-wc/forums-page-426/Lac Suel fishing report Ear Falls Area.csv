1448864,IMSPIKE,2012-06-13 13:07:00,12,"Slayed them last week with husky jerks fishing out of the bays sawmill and balantine. Also caught fish at the mouth of the sanctuary, back door, and lunker pt. 3 went 27.5. Biggest pike 37.5 lots of pics and videos added daily at walleyewisdom.com"
1450932,Bird hunter,2012-06-18 18:38:00,7,We were fishing out of fishermans cove from 6-9 till6-15 and the fishing was tough for us not a lot of fish caught but did catch about 6 that went 25 inches and some 18 inch small mouths most of are fishing was up by big island and caught a few in ghost narrows most of the fish came in 14 to 16 foot of water crank baits and worm harnesses.And the weather stunk rain rain and more rain and first night their we had a micro burst come through r camp and do a little damange.
1444333,Guest,2012-06-03 18:18:00,0,"Fished LS 5/27 - 6/1 Sun -Tues cold and rain showers. 35 -50 degrees Wed - Fri clear light breeze 45- 75 degrees Water temps Sun 52 degrees> Friday 60 degrees. Main lake temps Shallow bay found 65 degree temps Fishing was SLOW compared to the last 18 years of fishing LS You could pick up some fish and then nothing 2-10. Time to move. Moved around a lot to put fish into the boat. Wed found a spot in McKenzie bay that worked for 3 hours. Went back on Thurs and 1 fish and no more. Wed was the best for fish being stacked up. Seems others really weren't catching many all week. Did best east side of Cox island and north of deer island towards Turkey Creek area Used Jigs and Spinner rigs to catch all the fish this week with minnows. Pink or chartruse jigs and hammered brass spinners worked the best. Didn't use worms or leaches due to the reports from the previous week. Biggest fish Walleye 24"" Northern 35"" Smallmouth 16"" Not a lot of slot or over fish this trip. Scale of 1-10 would rate this trip a 3 Water levels are down approx 3.5 ft from last year. Really nice to see all those rock piles! Many of the navigation markers are missing>>>be careful Hope this helps you all... KEEP MOVING!!! I'll be back in 4 weeks to give it another shot!"
1444423,wallydave,2012-06-03 20:56:00,2151,"Our trip last year sounds like your week. We had just a couple of times when it was fish after fish!! We will at Goose Bay in less than two weeks!! Thanks for the report, hopefully your next ttrip will be better!!"
1444435,stumcfar,2012-06-03 21:34:00,451,"Stayed at Goose Bay for 3 days of fishing, starting Saturday, May 26th. Unfortunately, the weather was tough Sunday the 27th and didn't even get out on the lake, so only 2 days of fishing. Our numbers were down, but the size was up. Three of us in our boat, including my 11 year old son had around 50 fish over 20"", with the biggest at 28"". We caught few fish under the slot, which kept our numbers down. Fished most of the time from Herb's Point and the first little bay next to it in Sawmill. I wish the weather could have been better, but still a fun trip and Andrea was a great host."
1444598,Guest,2012-06-04 10:40:00,0,"What were you using for bait? We are headed up this Saturday and will be fishing the Ear Falls area and staying at Gold Pines. Hopefully, the bite gets better as the weather stabilizes. I'll provide a report upon my return. Good luck to all!"
1444626,Waterwolf3,2012-06-04 11:52:00,3,"Was up on Lac Suel out of Ear Falls last week.As was mentioned. Sunday-Tuesday cold, rain/snow flurries and windy.Rest of the week was perfect.We start out trying to figure the current pattern and for the first time really struggled pin pointing that pattern.Fish were scattered and bite would be on for an hour and shut off for three hours.Jig/minnow and bobber fishing were our two weapons of choice.Find fish with the jig and switch to bobber the first three days. The numbers were down, but size was up. Tuesday afternoon we caught 17 fish over 22"", with only a couple under the slot.Wed. weather broke and the numbers were back. Still scattered, but just jump from spot to spot.Entrance into sawmill was good, along with Cox's island, and inside sawmill, radar island produced. Lunker pt. and the timber into sawmill were fair.Good luck"
1444846,lunker99,2012-06-04 19:55:00,236,Will also be fishing out of Gold Pines next week. Where is Herb's point? Never heard of that one before. Thanks.
1444854,stumcfar,2012-06-04 20:05:00,451,"We fished jigs and minnows. We didn't seem to have a color that worked better than others, but our two biggest fish were caught on kind of an ugly dark blue. We also fished slip bobbers. We either verticle jigged or would cast with a very slow retreive that basically drug on the bottom. It did seem like when they bit, they were grabbing it. Good luck, wish I was going back!"
1444894,Knoxabilly,2012-06-04 21:30:00,225,"Lunker, It's the first point on your left handside when going into sawmill, has a sign on it that says herbs point."
1445356,lunker99,2012-06-05 19:48:00,236,Thanks Knoxabilly!
1445835,walleye ninja,2012-06-06 16:47:00,3,Saturday evening slow Sunday lunker point was very good jig minnow 5 to 10 feet Monday Slow day was saved by fishing northerns off the dock! Tuesday Tried Iron Creek was a good day Today slow tried Iron creek again one or two went to another spot on the way to steam boat that had dirty water and clear water zones picked up a couple there then once at steam boat picked up a few more but boat control was tuff.
