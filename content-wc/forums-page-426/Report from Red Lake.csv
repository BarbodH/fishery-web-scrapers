Our trip started on 6-10 had rain and allot of it all week till Friday. The fishing was fantastic, together we averaged 60 to 70 walleyes a day, fish related to wind drivin structure, where there was a small mayfly hatch happening the fish were stacked up in 3 to 10 feet of water with new weed growth and if the wind was blowing in all the better.Fish averaged 16 -17 inches with the largest at 26 inches we caught 16 fish over 25 inches. all fish were caught on 1/8 oz jigs in black and orange working the best but we also used green, blue and pink, My son used leaches and I used !/2 a crawler both worked equally well. When the walleyes would get spookey I would pitch a #4 gold mepps with a 4"" white twister and always seem to pull 1 or 2 nice pike out of that area 31- 36 inches.Thanks to all of you that offered help and info on past posts, we had a great time the camp was wonderful and yes I think we are HOOKED!Todd"
