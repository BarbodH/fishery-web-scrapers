1437608,kegisfly,2012-05-19 09:43:00,22,"Thanks for everyone's input. I am very interested in this as well. 2009 Water levels were really high (way up in the blueberry bushes). 2010 levels were really low... maybe 6-12ft below the previous year and 6-9 feet below whatever ""average"" is (almost no weed beds). Last year, 2011, it was ""up"" again, creeping into the blueberry bushes. Hope it is at least ""average"" levels for 2012. I love fishing the weed beds for pike. Seems like some conflicting reports and what I believe was a dry winter/spring. Keep us posted!!"
1441147,a3dad,2012-05-27 07:14:00,115,Just back from 5 days on Plamondon bay. The air temps were in the 80's (F) all day and only in the 60's (F) at night. The water temps were around 60 (F). Fishing was very slow because of the quick warm up and we were fishing almost a summer pattern. The water levels were as tshea stated earlier 1.5-2 ft from full and were holding.
1441443,Freytown,2012-05-28 06:08:00,770,"I'll be on Baie du Sud June 9th & will provide a water depth report plus fishing results too. Yea, I know it will be work, but someone has to do it."
1446192,NYBowHunter,2012-06-07 12:46:00,35,Bump - any new reports? My group's going up in 2 weeks. Thanx
1446480,Freytown,2012-06-08 06:18:00,770,"As a3dad reported, the water levels on the Gouin are near full capacity. That's what the outfitter told me two day's ago...I leave tonite at 7PM.Can't get here soon enough."
1446560,octanehi5,2012-06-08 08:33:00,1104,"with the hydro plants not running it should stay higher than normal, it will affect fishing in the areas that the water moves though when the plant is in operation"
1450058,Guest,2012-06-16 14:42:00,0,Got back yesterday water levels close to full pool fishing was great caught walleyes in 3to 6 ft. in the flooded grass water temps 65 gaining everyday.
1450669,Freytown,2012-06-18 11:21:00,770,"I also just returned from Baie du Sud, like Kyle said, the water is about 1 foot from capacity...based on water marks on shore rocks. May flies were hatching all week & fishing was good not super good but good enough. LOL"
1451565,Guest,2012-06-20 06:40:00,0,"Those chub looking fall fish were up in the grass eating may flies and the toothy ones were right in there with them. The only thing for sure about walleyes is that nothing is for sure, gotta keep an open mind or you may be eating hotdogs."
1319266,tweedrules,2011-06-17 04:49:00,107,How are the water levels at the gouin this year? Last year they were VERY down. All of our favorite weed beds were gone.
1319944,ArTie,2011-06-19 06:27:00,1,just come back and the water is high .The barrage guin is not dumping any water .(There will be project for next 4 years to fix the plant)Fishing was so-so
1432861,a3dad,2012-05-09 05:40:00,115,Anyone have any early info on the reservoir levels this year?
1432883,tshea,2012-05-09 06:36:00,36,Heading up tomorrow - will post what I find.
1432901,Hot N Tot,2012-05-09 06:57:00,5,I spoke with my outfitter late last week and he said that the water level is fairly high. Its not up in the weeds but theres only a little beach showing. He thinks that it will remain at this level. I thought that it would be low due to lack of snow and the mild spring but I guess not. Thats the Gouin....you never know about the water level!! Its always great fishing regardless!!
1432992,a3dad,2012-05-09 08:27:00,115,Excellent. I too was worried that the level would be down. I like it high for springtime pike. Fishing the opener. 11 days and counting. Can't wait. Thanks for the update. [QUOTE=Hot N Tot;1432901]I spoke with my outfitter late last week and he said that the water level is fairly high.

1433430,a3dad,2012-05-10 05:34:00,115,Spoke to my outfitter yesterday and they said the Gouin is about normal levels or maybe a bit low. Cited lack of rains... Guess we'll have to wait and see. I'll report back after my trip.
1434641,Freytown,2012-05-13 05:47:00,770,"My outfitter is at camp on South Bay preparing for the season opener. Spoke to him yesterday,he said water level is up like last year and was slowly rising. I got one more month before I will be re-united with the Quebec wilderness...can't wait."
1436460,tshea,2012-05-16 18:04:00,36,Was up to Mattawa bay on the weekend. Water is about 1.5 to 2' below maximum high. Definitely higher than the last couple years.
1437115,a3dad,2012-05-18 05:19:00,115,Thanks for the update tshea. Will be at Plamondon Bay on Monday. Will also post my findings when I return.
