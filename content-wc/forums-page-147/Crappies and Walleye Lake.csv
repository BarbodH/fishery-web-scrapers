6230194,dschiebel,2018-08-06 02:57:00,85,"Bill Carefully take the worms out of the rock bass fillet, throw away the filet, fry the worms in peach flavored schnapps. mmmmmmm good"

6229704,Walleyeski,2018-08-04 14:53:00,40,"Looking for a lake and resort in southwestern Ontario, north of I.F, west of 502 and south of Dryden for crappies and walleyes. Planning on sometime in September. Have our own boats."
6229720,Obabikon,2018-08-04 15:30:00,2370,Lake of the Woods out of Morson is certainly going to be your best bet for the crappies in the fall.
6229778,1700SS,2018-08-04 18:19:00,104,Give Jared a call at Obabikon. Or I stay at Red Wing lodge. Alot of other people stay at Mylies also. Third week in September is when I will be there.
6229780,stjoeguy,2018-08-04 18:44:00,979,"My first thought was Lake of the Woods, also. Thought you were going to the NW Angle or is that another trip? I've only been to the Mylies/Buena Vista area one time a year ago August. It was fun, but not the gold standard to which we compare every lake. We did get one very nice crappie (by accident, but it was nice)."
6229784,Obabikon,2018-08-04 19:19:00,2370,"Should have hired a guide to take you to the sunken trees. We absolutely crushed them the entire month of August last year. Every year is different, but it felt like I cleaned crappies non stop the entire month."
6229794,The tank,2018-08-04 20:02:00,340,I would say LOW out of morson or rainy lake the north west part for walleyes and crappie.
6229886,stjoeguy,2018-08-05 06:30:00,979,"We should have hired the guide with the ""secret"" brush pile just off the resort with the yellow cabins.... I hear that's the spot."
6229926,Obabikon,2018-08-05 08:28:00,2370,hahaha... love it! That's actually a secret rock bass spot. They just load up on it... I have never caught anything else on it!
6230064,The tank,2018-08-05 16:42:00,340,Nice Jared. Ill be at milesbay next saturday and was looking for a good rock bass spot. Now i know. Thanks.
6230104,Obabikon,2018-08-05 18:31:00,2370,They actually fry up pretty good... just make sure to spray the pan with some WD40 before you cook!
