McMurty Lake in S end too shallow to access, river in north shallow also and too many fishermen. Does anyone know any walk in lakes off Dog? Google maps helps but close on GM and access are differnet things. Any tips? Also anyone fished Dog east of Missinabi?"
6224744,lenray,2018-07-22 15:49:00,467,Stephenson-Stevenson sp. is a few miles out from Dog. I have quaded out from Dog with a canoe--sq. back. eyes in there and we have caught 40 plus inch pike. The road OUT TOWARDS THE MINE AND ON THE LEFT AND BACK IN THE WOODS A MILE OR SO. Many pike in MCEWAN----sp. used a quad and pulled a boat down to the lake.

6224790,lenray,2018-07-22 18:58:00,467,I left that area many many years ago. NWOntario is the place to go. Drive up one of those roads a hundred miles or so and put into a river system and go up or down say 15 miles--portage off that system and you will be on water that maybe only a few have ever dropped a line.
