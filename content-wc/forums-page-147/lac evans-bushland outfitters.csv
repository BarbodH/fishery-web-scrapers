6228210,Bstar,2018-07-31 18:27:00,564,Check out Mike Borgerâ€™s website at canadafishingguide.net. He was there a year or two ago and has a very good report on the lake with some videos. Go to fly in trips and look for Giant Pike of the Lowlands. You can also find it here https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aoJLDPEC4io

6228580,Esoxmike,2018-08-01 16:43:00,114,whats your favorite camp/time of year
6228650,phishfearme,2018-08-01 19:32:00,1242,"we did a trip to the crow bay camp and had very mixed results with fishing and the facilities. it was a very hot and dry year so the lake level was down and the water quite warm so our results may not be all that meaningful. we did indeed each catch trophy sized pike but it was not easy and many of the hot spots were just not that good - probably due to the low and warm water. walleye were few and far between and the average size was quite small - very disappointing. a few observations: - this is not a Canadian shield lake with lots of rock structure - it's a James bay lowlands lake so shallow flat areas predominate. - we traveled up to the northeast bay and we sounded 3ft of water for miles and miles - I though my sounder was frozen but a boat paddle confirmed this low water level - it went on for miles till we got to the teodat river inlet where there was some good fishing. - the lake is huge with lots of open, unsheltered water - bad winds can seriously restrict your fishing and also stir up the shallow bottom so much that you think you are fishing in a mud bog - we hauled a boat and motor up the rapids to fish the broadback river - results: one 21 inch walleye all day - we did have a great deal of fun catching 19-20 inch mooneyes that hit almost anything It is not my intention to downgrade this lake and facilities - others think this is a terrific lake and have no doubt had much better experience than we did. just know what you are getting for your money and ask the right questions of the operator before you go. phish"

6230164,5 of Diamonds,2018-08-05 20:57:00,151,"Hey Esoxmike: I've fished on most of Jim Saari's lakes before, during and after the evolution of his current company, Bushland Adventures. I've fished all of Jim's camps on Lac Evans; twice at Crow Bay, twice at Kirk Isle and and once at West Bay (and once at the original and now defunct Southwest Bay). The critique I'm reading from pike50plus and phishfearme is very articulate and representative of my experiences on Lac Evans too. Great having Walleye Central members like this who lay it all out to you. The only thing I would note slightly differently is that the groups I've been with on Lac Evans over the years have experienced exceptional pike fishing during the course of different weeks with many 40""+ fish caught per person (our groups measure IGFA - measuring to the center of the tail and not to the very tip of the tail). I've also fished at some of Jim's other outposts over the years: Camiscanne, Clarkie, Kamwakuskach (too many times to remember!), Pukuch & Weakwaten. What keeps me coming back is the quality of the very remote fishing, top notch equipment (Lund boats, Yamaha 20hp 4-stroke motors and Honda generators, etc., and Jim's raw and brutal honesty which has always been appreciated. Don't go to Lac Evans without the following: 1 oz. Eppinger Dardevle's in Five of Diamonds, 1-1/8 oz. Johnson Silver Minnows, 1 oz. Williams Wablers and if you can still find them, 3/4 oz. Barney spoons. Single barbless hooks are a necessity as the big Northern's take them deep. I hope your group has a great trip!"
6230380,pike50plus,2018-08-06 11:48:00,584,"I personally know other guys from Cleveland that go there every year and do great, but yes weather is a concern. I like Clarkie because of the variety and availability of cover. Even did a bush trip with Jim one year to camasichiwan? it was a walleye dream trip!"
