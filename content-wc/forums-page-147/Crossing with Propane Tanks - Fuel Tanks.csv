Make sure they are secured well and if you were to be asked about them just let them know they are just part of your camping gear. If you were carrying 10 250 lb cylinders in the back of your pick up, that may raise a few eyebrows as you would be transporting over a 1,000 lbs of hazmat ( cylinder and product weight combined) which then triggers a whole bunch of DOT/TC ( Transport Canada ) requirements. Have fun on your trip!!!! PjShorthorn"
6229194,DPKing814,2018-08-03 07:53:00,38,Thank you! Thats what I was looking for. Really appreciate the advice!
6229206,pjshorthorn,2018-08-03 08:07:00,5654,"You are very welcome. Having read some of the other responses regarding your trip time, my interest has been peaked. Where are you fellas going fishing? Whether the trip time is mapped vs. actual drive time, your trip is a true ""road trip"". In my younger years I would be all over that kind of adventure, but now I'm pretty sure my back would be really pizzzed off by the time we got there....LOL. Travel safe. PjShorthorn"
6229238,DPKing814,2018-08-03 08:43:00,38,Haha I hear that. We definitely love the road trip aspect of it but it's grueling for sure! We are going up towards Lynn Lake. This will be the first time we are doing any sort of fishing trip of this caliber and the first time we will be crossing the border with a ton of gear. Definitely looking forward to it and we appreciate the well wishes!
6229642,Fishoil,2018-08-04 12:16:00,1277,"It makes a lot more sense now. Lynn Lake is in Manitoba, I'm sure most of us were thinking Ontario."
6229680,hoosiercanadian,2018-08-04 14:07:00,104,"I have been making that trip to the Lynn Lake area at least twice a season for the last 18 years, 1,850 miles one way for us from southern Indiana, about 32 hours."
6228940,DPKing814,2018-08-02 14:27:00,38,"Has anyone tried to cross with anything bigger than the small camp size propane tanks? Looking to take a couple larger ones to run grill, shower, etc. We are also considering taking a decent sized fuel tank. Most likely we will fill it once we cross the border but just looking for experience crossing with either of these. Thanks"
6228946,CI_Guy,2018-08-02 14:53:00,2118,"I'm assuming by small camp size you mean the 1lb tanks? I've crossed at I Falls with 20lb and 30lb tanks not attached to a camper without any problems. Once I was asked if they were ""secured"", but they never looked at them."
6228960,Overwatchmike,2018-08-02 15:18:00,201,"I've crossed at the Soo with a 250 lb. Propane tank half filled before.... I bought it from a mobile home park and had no issues. That was the longest 13 hour nerve wracking trip of my life. Yes, I know I was illegal as all get out.I cross with a 100 lb tank almost every trip with no problems. I haven't even claimed it and never been questioned.Gas? Always cross with about 50 gallons in cans / tanks ranging from 3 to 25 gallons. I always tell them how many gallons of gas I have. Only a handful of times have I been made to pay duty on it.I've found that as long as you make a written out declaration list with cost / value you won't have a problem. Just make sure you have EVERYTHING listed! My neighbor tossed in a set of blinds last minute and didn't have them on his list. They did an inspection and found the blinds. He was red flagged and throughly checked every time after that.I've owned my camp for 19 years now.....Sent from my SM-G955U using Tapatalk"
6229102,DPKing814,2018-08-03 03:46:00,38,Thanks for the responses guys. Appreciate the info! We will be crossing the border 20 some hours into a 35-40 hour drive.. Trying to make everything go as smooth as possible.
6229114,Pooch,2018-08-03 04:46:00,4618,"I carry a twenty pound LP cylinder for our fish cooker. It sets in a milk crate with the second milk crate over the top and a tie down strap holding them together. That way the tank and valve are fairly protected.In the back of the truck I load it to the front and have other ""stuff"" packed around it so the if we have an accident it it protected from intrusion by another vehicle.Don't like carrying it, but it appears as safe way as anything I can come up with. Since it's under my topper the most concern I have is that the valve should leak, but we check for propane smell in the topper at every stop.Pooch"
6229168,MN_Moose,2018-08-03 07:24:00,964,"You guys get to the border and you're only half way there??? My, goodness where are you heading to?"
6229176,pjshorthorn,2018-08-03 07:37:00,5654,I'll bring my copy of the 49 CFR regs so we can show the border agents that we know what we are doing with hauling hazmat up to your place in September......LOL... PjShorthorn
6229180,DPKing814,2018-08-03 07:39:00,38,"Pretty far north haha.. That's including stops for grocery and everything else but driveway to Lake is mapped out around 32 hours. Guys that have taken the trip before say 20+ hours to border and can count on another 15 after crossing.All rough estimates, but based off of having never found a good time to hit Chicago on our way to North Dakota for waterfowl.. We are calling a 32 hour mapped drive, at least 40 hours straight through."
6229184,The tank,2018-08-03 07:45:00,340,Not to be a wise guy but how is this possible?
6229186,DPKing814,2018-08-03 07:49:00,38,20 some hours to border.. guessing 22-25 and then another 12-15 above border.. driving straight through.. including time for stops. Make the drive every year to north dakota for waterfowl.. Stopping every 4-5 hours for fuel.. Assuming it will be similar hauling a boat... We are guessing 32 hour mapped drive will take approx 40 hours total.
