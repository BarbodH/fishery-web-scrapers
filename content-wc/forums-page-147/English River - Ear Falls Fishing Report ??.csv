6227726,UpNorthGuy,2018-07-30 19:52:00,53,"I guess I would call it scattered, I found the best action on mid lake humps coming up from 30’ into 9’. Nothing shallow."
6228230,ia bhtr,2018-07-31 19:07:00,212,"Paul , with water where it is , did you stay on Wegg the whole time or did you run some of the skinny water to the other lakes ?? When we were up early June the trip to Unexpected was already a shallow one , can a camp boat get into Clear if you walk it in"
6228248,UpNorthGuy,2018-07-31 19:51:00,53,"You can run to all the main lakes, Goose, Wilcox. Clear will be a challenge even for walking the boat in but I bet it could be done. Bottom is mostly mud in that river so it could be messy slow going. The water is down a few feet from when you where there in June. Like I said Unexpected will be tough but not impossible to navigate. First timers should avoid it or follow somebody."
6228332,DanM57,2018-08-01 06:12:00,135,I got a text this morning from a friend that is at Manitou Falls Camp as I type this for his second trip of the year. He said the water is down several feet since we were there over Memorial Day . Clear and Unexpected are a not accessible and Johnson is very tough. DanM
6228352,UpNorthGuy,2018-08-01 07:03:00,53,I’ll be back up around 20th of September for my third trip of the year. I’m hoping for more water in the system. Any less and that trip will be very limited as to what can be fished.
6209840,Guest,2018-06-18 02:40:00,0,"I'm heading up to knotty pines on 22nd of June. Never been there wondering if anyone has any info on fishing reports, water levels, or just good spots. Sounds like there isn't much bad spots."
6210042,ia bhtr,2018-06-18 11:16:00,212,"CG …….. water is low , you are staying on Wegg , ask Norm about the hump out in front of the lodge , he will put you on it , tops out at 6.5 feet right now , Moose Bay work the right shoreline as you go in , lots of fish but seem to run a little smaller , Johnson lake 2/3rds of the way in on the left side work the 5 ft out to 7 or 8 right now , weed line in there , be careful going in you will need to trim up , best way in is draw a line straight south out of the mouth and follow that in from deeper water , crawlers or leaches is what we used , others were using minnows and doing well , bottom bouncers or slip sinker lindys worked for our group …… smallies head to Wilcox and go to the back bay, fish seemed to be in tight to shore , we were hitting the shoreline with our baits out to 3ft or so for us 1/8th oz chartreuse jig with a similar twister tail worked the best for me , swim bait caught walleyes while going after smallies , snot rockets will be an issue , Unexpected is probably where you want to go for your best walleye fishing , we had excellent luck half way down the north shoreline in 9 to 10 ft of water , there are some starters for you ….. now for the caution areas >>====>Like I said , pay attention going into Johnson , no problem getting in as long as you pick the right line , at the mouth hang close to the exposed rocks on your rightGoing to Wilcox about a quarter mile before you get to Wilcox you will see a pretty good sized rock exposed on your left , what you wont see is one just under the water on your right , there is probably 100 yards inbetween them , so not an issue , but 1st time thru look for them so you know where they are Unexpected , when you are leaving Wilcox heading to Unexpected you are going to run into a long stretch of 2 foot water , once you get to it , it will be that way all the way to Unexpected , I am pretty bad at distances but that maybe a mile or more , when you start to deepen up after a right hand turn , an outpost cabin will be right in front of you when you turn right , you will go thru a narrow section with large smooth rock out cropping on both sides , your depth finder will go to 7 to 10 foot ( at current water levels ) be very careful in that narrow neck , big *** rock slightly right of middle that you cant see and wont expect will bite your prop ( don't ask me how I know )So there are a few thoughts for areas to fish and areas to be careful , you are going to Love the fishing , it is phenomenal , but this is a strange year with water levels and not being there before you will want to pay attention , if someone from camp is going to Unexpected , see if the will let you tag along to learn the way , pretty close to a 20 mile boat run , if not ask Norm , he may lead you down there the 1st timeGOOD LUCK & have fun"
6210314,Cgraeve,2018-06-18 20:22:00,2,Thanks for the reply! Awesome info thank you! I can’t wait been up to Canada 4 of last 5 years. This looks to be best fishing from what I can tell. Can’t wait!
6211094,Trucky1008,2018-06-20 10:43:00,39,"In the low-water years on the English River where some lakes can be tough to get into we've had great luck fishing the channel. The back side of the island at the rapids produces great walleye, as well as below the dam, Windy Point, the hump outside the cabin on Goose. We were up there the first week of June and the water level inched up about a foot during the week but we still couldn't get into Clear. As mentioned before be careful when heading into Johnson and try to use your electronics to follow the narrow channel in, it will shallow up real quick! Good luck!"
6218008,Guest,2018-07-06 10:15:00,0,Hi. Just curious if anyone has been up here lately and can share what the water level is and how the fishing has been. Thanks!
6218060,Farmerj,2018-07-06 12:43:00,375,This was the week before father's day by grassy narrows. Same area.
6218454,Cgraeve,2018-07-08 00:02:00,2,"I was there the last full week of June. We had an amazing week of fishing took a day to figure some things out cause it was low my best guess would be for sure 4' low maybe 5'. We still caught a lot of walleye, we had good luck in heavy current areas just floating and vertical jigging. the bigger ones seem little deeper we had one at 30'' on wegg just west of rapids in 45' of water. Rocks that would normally be issues weren't bad because they were sticking out so much. Caught a nice fat 34'' northern on Johnson and a nice fat 35'' musky on goose. good luck let me know if you have any other questions. it was a great week with norm at knotty pines."
6227570,Guest,2018-07-30 13:03:00,0,"Hello, I am getting ready to head up to Manitou Falls for fishing on this 7 lake stretch of the river in a couple of weeks. Has anyone returned lately and have any reports?"
6227682,UpNorthGuy,2018-07-30 18:08:00,53,"Just got back from Knotty Pines today. Water is super low, getting into Clear is almost impossible, Johnson you have to walk it in, Unexpected will be a slow challenge to navigate into. Fishing is good early morning, the bite turns off hard about 11am. You can still catch fish but it’s slow going."
6227720,Guest,2018-07-30 19:40:00,0,"Thanks for the report. Hopefully the water level comes up soon, but not holding my breathe. Are the eyes holding to structure in deeper water, or have they scattered? Any tips would be appreciated."
6203110,ia bhtr,2018-06-01 19:24:00,212,"Hi Folks >>===> heading up there next Friday for a week - will be staying with Norm at Knotty Pines, just wondering water levels and whats happening with the fishing right now , Thanks for any and all thoughts !! Dan"
6203268,UpNorthGuy,2018-06-02 08:37:00,53,"Hello, I'm going in on Monday to visit Norm at Knotty Pines, if I can get a good internet signal I'll post a fishing report on Wednesday or Thursday. I'm staying through June 13 so I'll see you there. I have heard from Norm that the water level is pretty low so far, but the system can rise quickly if they get some rain. Low water or high water the fishing has always been fantastic. UpNorthGuy . Paul"
6203352,ia bhtr,2018-06-02 12:28:00,212,"Thanks Paul , have heard same things on water level , we will b there noonish on the 9th leaving on the 16th , hoping we can get back into Clear , may not be able to , and some "" thin "" spots on the way to Unexpected"
6203364,UpNorthGuy,2018-06-02 13:41:00,53,"I was there last September and we couldn’t get into Clear at all, was almost dry at the bend in the creek. Never had to much trouble into Unexpecte, entrance to creek on the Wilcox end can be weedy and slow going. See you Friday."
6203378,ia bhtr,2018-06-02 14:43:00,212,"yep , that's the area I was thinking going to unexpected , really hoping to get into Clear"
6203574,DanM57,2018-06-03 07:39:00,135,"We just got back from Manitou Falls yesterday. The water is really low. We couldn't get into Clear as there is a beaver dam blocking the channel. We heard that some guys got out their boat and pushed it over the obstruction to get in. All other areas we accessible, just a little more tricky than usual. Lots of stuff to hit if you are not careful. Fishing was great as would be expected. Largest walleye for our group was 26.5. Good luck."
6203790,Nowaksark,2018-06-03 17:22:00,4,"Just returned June 1. Fishing was incredible!. Stayed at Timberland Lodge, just up from the bridge. Water is low, 5ft. Low. The Wenesaga was done by the end of the week. No current. Fished to the east of the river in 4-6' water and hammered the walleyes. 3 days of 100 + fish in the boat. Needed to catch 8 eaters, 14-16"" for shore lunch and usually had them by 7:30. Lots of pike and a few smallies for some fun. Water temp midweek hit 70. Thurs. Cooled off and temp was 60. Best week of fishing ever, have a great time!"
6204388,ia bhtr,2018-06-04 20:55:00,212,"Thanks for the info guys , pretty much what I expected to hear , really wanted to get back into Clear , welp , guess that gives me a reason ( as if I needed one ) to go back again next year or possibly this fall"
6208378,UpNorthGuy,2018-06-13 11:32:00,53,Good Meeting you last weekend. I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.I hope your week of fishing and staying at Knotty Pines was as enjoyable as mine was. Maybe I'll see you next year... (or August or September)
6209634,ia bhtr,2018-06-17 09:45:00,212,"Yep , got home last night , was glad we had a chance to visit as well , fishing was really good , we did get into Clear , but had to get out of the Pro V to get it over whats left of the beaver dam , river is going down and pulling water out of the feeder lakes , actually a pretty strong current , not sure anything but a small boat will get into Clear this week and that will probably have to be walked in , the stretch between Wilcox and Unexpected was getting shallower every day , had my big motor almost out of the water and still managed to get sand into it , along with finding rocks with the scag n the prop that u couldn't see in the areas where u could drop the motor a little , o well , wanted to change props anyways , now I have a reason all in all a great trip , just had to be careful in some areas , water is low enough there are a lot more rock issues where u mite not expect them , got them all ( least ways the ones I "" located "" ) marked for future avoidance , biggest eye was 27 , smallie was 19 1/2 , northern 37 1/2 , so not huge but darn nice , quite a few waldos over 25 , average fish was probably just under 20 , Norm did a great job while we were there , could tell his back was really bothering him , but he didn't let that slow him down , good bunch of people in camp , everyone got along , the dude in the Warrior picked up a 37.5 northern with his Fly Rod , that was kind of cool , probably see you next June , later , Dan"
