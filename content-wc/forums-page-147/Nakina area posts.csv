6226630,coldwaterbob,2018-07-27 13:23:00,4,"Our group of 4 fished Melchet 5 days July 15-20 . First time on a fly in for us. We caught few fish first 2 days as coldfront moved through, but ones we caught were good size (24 1/2"" walleye). fishing really picked up when weather stabilized. We caught fish in outlet, along wall, near island south end and the humps by the cabin. Almost nothing in inlet from Map!The solar system works awesome and there is an inverter installed , u just have to unplug the cabin cord to plug in fish finder charger cord..we did this overnight.Boats were good but mite want to ask or bring better anchor. we could only find 3 and some windy days needed 2 per boat.We caught most walleyes on jigs with white paddletails or gulp leech. caught few pike"
6226664,Bstar,2018-07-27 15:14:00,564,"Thanks for the report! So you can plug a 120 volt battery charger into the inverter? That's great. When I talked to Jason at BFO he said they only had USB ports for charging phones,etc. How was the cabin otherwise. Fridge, stove and oven work ok? Shower?"
6226678,coldwaterbob,2018-07-27 15:38:00,4,"Jason and Sue are great.. there are 2 fridges, both work well but I would bring ice . Yes I plugged the little battery charger that came with portable Garmin fish finder into inverter. Cabin is roomy, clean and the screened porch is nice. Shower worked awesome. Bugs not bad during day but morning and evening were bad but that's normal. Dock was slanted bad due to ice damage but I think they were going to work on it last week."

6227144,flipdip,2018-07-29 12:27:00,27,We are heading out to Melchett on Aug 17th. This will be out 7th trip there. Coming up fast. Looking forward to any updates between now and then.
6230140,kzoofisher,2018-08-05 19:56:00,5144,"Just got back from Percy Lake, first trip there. Fishing was good, bugs not bad. Biggest walleye of the trip was 27 1/2"" and pike was 38. We didn't target pike and that was real touch and go on walleye gear in the weeds. Percy is a shallow lake with very little obvious structure and we took no electronics* but weed beds were easy to find and the upwind sides produced well, edges pretty well, holes in heavy beds very well when you could sit on them for a couple minutes. Thinner beds we could let the wind carry us through and found fish that way. They were not the least bit boat or motor shy. Water was low according to reports and the two busted motors the outfitter was in the process of repairing** so we didn't explore the river much, but any spot with enough rocks to make a riffle had plenty of fish in it. All fish came on jig and plastic with bright colors being best. White, chartreuse, chartreuse orange core and yellow. Found a couple points where there was a break from <2' to the main basin, 6'-8', and they produced as well. I'm sure there's something out in the main lake where the water does get into the teens and twenties but without even a depth finder we didn't look for anything. Did get one good size perch in the weeds and that made us feel better about the nibblers we'd been missing. Overall the walleye hit harder than the pike the whole week; even with slow retrieves in still water they were thumping jigs. Average size was good, most fish in the slot or above and fat. Ten fish with sides was enough to feed three old guys and two youngsters. One youngster is 6' 11"" and his dad is 6' 8"" but the fillets were big. Weather was as good as we could ask for. One storm blew in on Tuesday afternoon, dropped the temp 20 degrees, cooled the water enough to notice and made us sit until late Wednesday morning but it brought the lake up 4"" and the rivers really turned on after that. Otherwise we had mostly light winds and warm temps. Wildlife wise we saw a fox and a bear (on the drive to Nakina), assorted loons and eagles and had a mink hang out with us at the dock. Sadly, no moose. The mink caught a crayfish while we watched, came within 2' of me to check me out, seemed generally unconcerned with anything and went about his business. Got some good video of him. Or her. The two trappers in the group argued about whether it was a male or female. This was my first fly in and it was fun. Would like to do another someplace that included smallmouth bass so I could get in some top water fly fishing. *We talked about taking some sort of depth finder and decided to go old school. Happy to report I can still find fish that way. **There were three boats with good motors and only five of us so that worked out fine. Tough on the outfitter to have those added costs but I'm sure it's the nature of the business."

6225132,ONEMORE,2018-07-23 14:25:00,4,"Fished aba with my wife and son and his girlfriend, wind was the worst i have ever had on a canada trip. stayed in cabin 2 with tlo, cabin was tight no mice, flights went perfect, bugs were nice and friendly. Tuesday night had a big mayfly hatch, wednesday morning our 1 calm day as we were heading to our fishing spot mayfly shells all over the water, thought it was going to be a poor day of fishing ended up being our best day my wife and i caught 130. all four of us for the week ended up with 670. Had a good time made the most of it would go back on a spring trip."

6226254,shaunyp6,2018-07-26 12:06:00,1,Our group of 6 people will be into Mellchett Lake the week of Aug 24-31. First time to this location. I am interested to hear about the lake conditions and areas worth trying. Question for the forum - What is the best way to charge our 12volt fish finder batteries? Will the cabin have an inverter connected to the solar panels? Will it be wired up similar to a standard 120 v receptacle or is it a USB setup? I am told they don't have a generator on site.
6226264,Bstar,2018-07-26 12:32:00,564,Our group will be there the week after you so make sure you leave us a clean cabin and any leftover beer! Lol All kidding aside my understanding is they only have USB charging ports off of the solar system. We are bringing in one of those cheap 2 cycle 850 watt Wen generators to charge our batteries. It weighs about 40 lbs or 2 cases of beer. This will be our first time there also.
