6227342,rather-be-fishin,2018-07-29 23:18:00,429,"We were at Lac Seul Onaway Lodge 7/20 to 7/27. We have been fishing this area of Lac Seul for 14 years at same time of the year. When we arrived at the lodge & asked the owner Kathy how's fishing, she said you are going to have to work for them. She was right!!! The fishing was tough & we did work for them. Not a typical Lac Seul bite at all. It was a tough week of weather too. Windy with 2 days out of the East, then 2 days out of the West, 1 day Southwest & 2 days Out of the North. Temps ranging from 60-70's & 2 days if low 50's - 60's with rain & wind. Felt like Fall! NOT typical July weather at all!!! So that explains the fishing challenge. We did fish everyday from 8:00-6:00. I would rate it the 2nd slowest bite of our 14 years of going to Lac Seul. But do realize it was still BETTER than ANY Walleye fishing we have EVER done in MN!!! So this is what we found: 1. There was a minnow shortage at the resort on 2nd day, so they supplied us with 2 dozen frozen salted shinners to use. I haven't used them before & they worked OK. Not as good as live minnows. We did use crawlers too & they worked off & on. Did not have leeches. Live minnows worked the best. The rest of the week They had enough of a supply of minnows, which worked best. 2. Fish were in 22 - 27 feet. 3. The lake is down 2+ feet from what it was when we were there last year. Many rocks & reefs were out of the water. Only fished one reef. Mostly trolled islands & stilled fished with jigs. Fished Scout Bay, Bay of Islands, South of Manitoba Point & McKenzie Bay. Used 1/4 to 3/8 jigs or spinners rigs. Best jig colors that produced were: Pink, Purple, Gold, Orange, Chartreuse & Parrot. Had to move around a lot to find the fish. 4. First night caught a 27 1/2 Walleye within 20 minutes of fishing & 2-3 25 Walleyes right in Scout Bay. All week we had to work to catch freezer fish 16 - 17 1/2, but all limited out. Throughout the week did catch several 22-24 Walleyes. Didn't catch many Northerns, but don't target them. Caught a 30, 28, 3 27 1/2 So not keepers. Caught MANY small Walleyes 6-14. Some Saugers & a Saugeye. Also a few Perch. 5. On our last day we finally found a honey hole in 25-27 feet & had a typical Lac Seul fantastic day jigging & catching MANY nice big FAT Walleyes, one after the other, averaging 21 - 25 & also 2 27 1/2 Walleyes so ended the trip with an AWESOME day of fishing!!! We can't wait to return again next year!!! Also, check out Silver Water Wheel's website for their weekly fishing report, they had a similar week like ours. I hope you have better week of weather & that the bite will be on! RBF"

6227782,Cheyenne,2018-07-30 22:23:00,2,"Thanks for the great report, I do appreciate it!"
6227820,mswope13,2018-07-31 05:39:00,73,"Our group just returned from Evergreen Lodge (Ear Falls) and I can basically cut and paste RBF's report. We fished Steamboat Bay which typically holds our multiple ""go to"" spots. Tuesday was the only day where we parked on top of the eyes. They were deeper than normal (20-24'). Our group will normally boat 60-80 walleye per boat/day between 2 guys. This year we averaged half that with the exception of Tuesday. We did boat some nice over's (a few 25's and a couple 26's) New owners at Evergreen Brent and Kathie are really great. Seems to be upgrading the camp and certainly go out of their way to accommodate any requests. Their dock hand (Cole), is about as good as it gets. We all know how important they can be, and Cole set the new standard. Good luck to those going up in August"
6227850,dakota eye,2018-07-31 06:28:00,69,What was your main method of catching them thx.
6228088,mswope13,2018-07-31 13:36:00,73,We were traditional jig and minnow. Used both 1/4 oz. and 3/8 oz jigs depending on the wind.
