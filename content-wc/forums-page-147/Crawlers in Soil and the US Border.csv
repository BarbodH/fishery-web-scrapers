6226320,Guest,2018-07-26 17:10:00,0,"I got asked by Canadian Customs four years ago if I was importing any live bait. Ever since, I purchase my worms in Canada and any I have left over I give to someone else. One year, I forgot to get bait until I was too far north. Google maps had a bait store outside of Chapleau but when we got there, it had been out of business for some time. When we go to the lake, someone leaving gave us their worms and saved our trip. Last year, a group did the same thing and I was able to help them out by giving them our leftover worms. Pay it forward, I said..."
6226770,Aspencreek,2018-07-27 21:16:00,2911,"I also leave any leftover worms for the next group. Last trip to camp a family was new to LS and was really struggling. Dad was bound and determined to catch his walleye by casting his bounty of rapalas and thunderstick's. The 12 yr old boy was not having any luck, so I offered to take him out after dinner. We backtrolled and slip-bobbered with some crawlers and lit them up until dark. The kid had a blast and you couldn't wipe the smile off my face while he caught fish after fish. When we got back to camp, with Dad and mom at the dock waiting for us, the kid stood up and told dad he needed to get some crawlers. I gave them enough for the rest of the week and showed him what we were doing. I agree Pay it forward.The next night he asked if mom could go with us, dad didn't think that was a good idea, I agreed."
6227414,38bill,2018-07-30 08:12:00,331,"Just got back from Canada last weekend. Before I went I purchased crawlers at my local Fleet Farm. They were in a breathable plastic bag and imported from Canada and labeled as such. The Canadian border officer asked me about live bait and I replied that we had Canadian crawlers. He then asked me how I knew they were Canadian and was surprised when I showed him the package with "" A product of Canada"" printed right on the side. PS: Those Canadian walleyes really liked them too!"
6227454,camp chef,2018-07-30 09:13:00,915,Why would you add dirt to crawlers that are already in worm bedding?
6228528,Fishoil,2018-08-01 14:26:00,1277,"My local bait wholesaler gets his crawlers from Canada, many flats per load, and they are always packed in dirt. How can this be legal? Yet if I buy a flat of those Canadian crawlers to take to Canada I have to repack them in bedding."
6228548,Lovetofish,2018-08-01 15:36:00,458,"I stopped at Harris and Fish Lake Baits on my trip north earlier this month to buy my fatheads and I salt them right in the bait shop. One gal was working on packaging crawlers by the dozen. I asked her where they bought their crawlers? She said ""Canada"". She had to wash them off and re-pack in paper because they came in dirt. I took a look and sure enough it was dirt."
6228560,Obabikon,2018-08-01 16:18:00,2370,No clue how that works. I'm simply stating that it is illegal for you or I to transport dirt across the border. (either direction) I'm sure there's all sorts of exceptions... like if you can prove you have clean dirt or have a specific importers permit. None of that is applicable for individuals.
6229684,hoosiercanadian,2018-08-04 14:20:00,104,"I usually take up a flat , i buy buss bedding , which looks like blown in insulation, i freeze a gallon jug solid, i place that in the middle of the commercial bedding, don't get it too wet,then cover with some damp newspaper as a blanket, when i get up north i take a 5 gallon bucket , go back into the bush and pull up some moss and place a blanket of that moss over the bedding, the moss is 2 feet deep behind my cabin, anyway the worms will stay cool and healthy for many days that way."
6225048,Eyes_R_Us,2018-07-23 11:37:00,66,This year I am going to buy my crawlers in Canada rather than bring them from home. I guess that means they will be in soil rather than bedding so I have two questions: 1. Will they survive as well in soil assuming I keep them cool like I always do? 2. Will I have any trouble bringing the extra ones with be when I come back into the US? I always bring a few dozen home with me but can't remember if they ask about bedding at the US border.
6225082,The tank,2018-07-23 13:00:00,340,All worms that i have bought in canada have been in bedding. I will never bring them back to the US ever again not worth it to me. We got pulled over by US customs in IF mn. Was there for 45-55mins. Just to look at our worms. Not sure why they needed to see them. Worms are cheap so we just give them to the camp were staying at.
6225090,Huntindave,2018-07-23 13:13:00,2194,"If you have worms that are packed in soil, you better keep a receipt showing you purchased them in Canada and did NOT bring them across the border. The MDNR that checks you while out on the water, would be a greater worry than bringing any extras back home."
6225098,vteye3,2018-07-23 13:31:00,496,"Geez, could be hiding illegals in that bedding.."
6225224,Obabikon,2018-07-23 19:12:00,2370,"1. yes, they will survive just as well (if not better) in soil vs. bedding. Keep them cool 2. it is against the law to transport soil EITHER direction. Do not do that if they are in dirt."
6225232,Obabikon,2018-07-23 19:23:00,2370,"Or some type of insect or parasite... If they had been even slightly strict 30 years ago... maybe we wouldn't has as many invasive species. Sorry, but I don't trust the average person to behave in a proper manner. Most people are wonderful, however, there are plenty out there that are not... it only takes one to ruin it for everyone though."
6225252,Bstar,2018-07-23 20:53:00,564,We always give our leftover crawlers to the next guys coming to the camp if they want them . We never bother bringing them back with us.
6225266,GBS,2018-07-23 21:06:00,2271,"So true - earthworms/night crawlers are also an invasive species....brought from Europe, and have totally changed the eco-systems of the forests....."
6225288,Boots,2018-07-24 03:55:00,19,If I bring my crawlers into Canada with permitted worm bedding I see no problem if I add Canadian dirt.
6225296,Shellback,2018-07-24 05:00:00,8083,"Make sure you have each nightcrawlers passport ready when you pull up to the booth! LOL! I've never been asked about bait when returning to the US. but as others do, I just leave mine with my Canadian friends."
