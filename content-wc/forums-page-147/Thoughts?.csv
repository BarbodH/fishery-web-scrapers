On top of that, an enormous 35-40' yacht (with a boat and 3 wave runners) just moored 100 yards off the island last night. Hoping they are going to move on down the lake. I'm not sure why anyone would want to park/sleep right next to a resort. I'm starting to feel like a grumpy old man shaking his fist and strangers.

Now if it was one of your guests moving in on the guided boat, well, that deserves an extra cold one after dinner. Gotta admire a guy protecting the lodge owner. Here is what I would do, everytime the guide boat shows up take a picture making sure the date and time stamp is on. Let's see how many pics you could get, then when it finally stops, send the lodge owner all of the pictures with a short note asking if he was aware that it was his guide bringing his customers to within spitting distance to your dock to catch fish, not a good business move. The camp I go to on LS has a reputation for having some really nice walleye and northern that live under the fish house and docks (I will not name names here) and the Camp owner has instituted the rule that there is no fishing from the dock, to protect those fish from dumb a$$ that seem to think they should try and catch those ""pets"". Well, early one morning, here was a camp boat from another camp inside the docking structure jigging for said ""pets"".

What kind of second rate guide has to take his clients in front of a competitor's lodge just to find fish? That's not very good advertising for anyone on that lake.
6226092,That Minnesota guy,2018-07-26 06:31:00,8293,"I would contact the other lodge owner first. Most likely he isn't aware of whats happening. If it continues take the gloves off and go to war I guess. I'm surprised to read this. I've always thought LOTW was a pretty good size lake. Funny that the guide only has one spot to bring clients. Or maybe, the guide isn't that good. BTW, we have guides that portage clients out of Kabatogama / Namakin into Rainy looking for Walleyes. I wonder if the resort & guide ever wonders why they lose booking to the lodges on Rainy? If I owned one of those lodges I would be short a guide. Also had a guide poaching clients they picked up at one resort and tried to get them to book the following trip at another resort. Is there no honor among some of these guys?"

6226162,bthomas3333,2018-07-26 08:45:00,465,I have fished LOTW and enjoyed my time there. I guess I wonder how this happens? My understanding is pretty limited but I thought the Govt (national or local) issued use permits to the lodges which outlines what water each lodge can use. Did this not happen on LOTW. Massive body of water do they really allow the lodges to fish on top of each other? When I have done fly-ins my understanding was the outpost had exclusive use (aside from locals or canoe-ist) Was I wrong?Maybe I dont understand the process or limit use is a new concept and LOTW usage was never divided up?Brett
6226176,Lake Wisconsin,2018-07-26 09:04:00,1960,"I am with others, a friendly talk with the other owner of the lodge should take care of this. Use the approach it isn't good business for either one of us. Mention, you often have kids fish from shore when mom and dad are prepping the meal or having a drink, fish that spot. That paints a nice picture with keeping it very civil. I am willing to bet he and his guides will back way off. Now, I will tell you of a story in the very passive aggressive sense. I have good early season walleye fishing right off my dock due to a warm creek that runs on my property. In my best year, I caught 189 in about a 40 day period (throw most of them back for those who work for the internet police). It is not an unknown area that fish hold there in the spring, but seldom are there boat there - maybe one night a week. A guy pulled up when I was fishing off the dock with my daughter one night. He was within 20 yards of my dock, and to draw the picture, I use up to 15' cane poles. Essentially, our lines could easily cross. At this point in time, I still don't have an issue, but feel its rude. Fast forward after he pounds around a dozen beers. Still on the dock with my 6 year old daughter at the time. He needs to take a pee - does it right at us. Completely unacceptable. I pull lines and go in. He came to fish right off my dock the next two nights. Both nights I made the conscience effort to forgo fishing to make a point his behavior was not acceptable. I have a dog that lives to dock jump after his bumper. I cracked a beer and for the next 30-45 minutes, until he left both nights, I had a dock jumping dog just short of his lines. He never said a word, nor did I and he has not been back!"
6226224,martinbns,2018-07-26 10:49:00,1520,"A couple of weeks ago we were going about 20 miles down the lake to a couple of spots we had found that were very productive. When we got to the first one, there was a lodge boat there, it's a big hump so I stopped to fish the north side of it while they were on the south side maybe 100 yards away. As we stopped they packed up and took off. This spot was nowhere near the Lodge in question, I didn't feel bad about it. I wouldn't fish a spot like that daily but occasionally seems ok. I would talk to the other lodge owner."

6226258,ILScott,2018-07-26 12:12:00,139,"I go to a remote boat in lake with a portage. Camp boats on a 15,000 acre lake always portage down to this lake. This summer one day two boats came in but then the next day 5 and then on Friday about 7 or 8 came down. We have never understood this especially since the owner of the camp takes care of the portage ramp and docks. The positive thing is some of the people that portage over like the camp and end up changing camps. It can be frustrating but not one person owns the lake."

I'm probably more like forgop... good ole passive aggressiveness. It wouldn't be a big deal if it wasn't nearly every day. I would say that I have seen the same guide at least 12 times in the past 3 weeks, and the dock hand has told me he's seen him several other times. I'm certain that if it bugged me enough, a simple call to the other owner would resolve the issue. However, many times at sportshows I get asked ""what's the difference between your resort and ______ resort?"". Would it be wrong to say... ""you will never see one of my guides fishing next to _____"" and then show the picture? Is that shoddy? I probably wouldn't ever do something like that, but it is the truth. You don't see Obabikon boats fishing next to other places, and they're 10 miles away. The only reason this ""guide"" knows of the spot, is he sees our boats fishing it regularly."

6225890,dhottle,2018-07-25 15:42:00,163,I think your proposed photo would do you more harm than good. It kinda shows that fishing pressure is intense & that your location has too much pressure from other camps. When I book a week at a camp I don't like seeing other camps boats around. I think you should approach the other camp owner & discuss how it not good business for either of you.

There's a brush pile out there that I direct our guests to on a regular basis. I do not harass the other resorts' boats, and I know it is a free lake that I do not own. However, I am considering using a photo for advertising purposes. Maybe something like ""a resort with fishing SO good, other resorts hire guides to fish right next to it"". When I'm selling at a sportshow, I could use the photo as a prop or something like that. Also, I tell my guides every single year... ""do not fish right next to other resorts"". It's bad business. Our staff is hired to promote our resort. I guess my question would be... is using something like that for advertising purposes going too far? What's everyone's thoughts?"

6225808,BornToFish,2018-07-25 11:43:00,1224,"Greetings,I fished a lake several years ago from a particular lodge. A competitor's lodge was located a short distance from the lodge that I fished from. It turned out that the owner of the competitor's lodge lives a short distance from me in the United States. We got to know each other over the years.The competitor's lodge has a deep hole, a very short distance from his dock that holds nice pike and walleye in the early season. He invited me to fish this deep hole.I thought about it and chose to never fish it, as I would have fished it from a boat with a decal of the lodge that I stayed at. I had a suspicion that a photograph would have been taken and possibly shown about that showed me fishing from the boat with the lodge's name prominently displayed on its side.I concur with Pooch: take the high road. Otherwise, you might invite a tit-for-tat affair with the guide or competitor's lodge owner. However, I would share the photograph with a select group of friends when enjoying a refreshing beverage!I know several guides fairly well. I would say that most of them seldom fish a particular spot more than once during any given week. They seem to have a collection of spots that they rotate through during the course of a week. I'm a little surprised that the guide from the competitor's lodge is fishing the same spot every day.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
