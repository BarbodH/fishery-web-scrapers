Further research led to a bunch of websites claiming to offer an online test. I would like some guidance here on if this is true, and if so is there a recommended site to take the test. I haven't fished or boated Canada in over a decade."
6228536,BRP,2018-08-01 14:56:00,77,Boats rented as part of a lodge stay should be exempt if you fill out the proper rental checklist. And this from the gov't website:Proof of competency is not required in the following situations: the boat is being operated in the waters of Nunavut or the Northwest Territories the boat is being used for daily living or subsistence activities (such as hunting and fishing practised by many Indigenous peoples) a visitor to Canada is operating the boat he or she brought into Canada for less than 45 consecutive days

Ive never been checked nor do i know anybody who has, its just a money grab. But yet a bunch of googans cant rent a boat whos never been on a boat or even on the water and go cruising on the lake. Its all BS. Looks like you dont need one so its all good, if you did you just get a second computer and google all the questions to get the answer and then mark them on the other computer."

I remember hearing that they do not even have an official database or anything that has a record of the license associated with any law enforcement. Not really sure though."
