Steamwhistle makes a pilsner as does Creemore and a number of other small brewers. Which specific pilsner are you referring to in your post?"

I find a lot of the micro brewed IPAs are WAY too hoppy. You get a really massive orange pith bitterness after each drink. I guess some like that, but I am not a fan. Steam Whistle is what you drink on a really hot day."

This was the first year trying Kokanee and we all really liked it. I probably will not get any Labatts next year.

It's an IPA, but not supposed to be your strong IPA. Might do a 12 of Mill St. Tankhouse, 12 of 360 Pale, and then my go-to which is Sleeman Railside.We always stop at the Beer Store in FF.

Even though the market is saturated they say, new ones are still opening. I've only had a few I really liked, many that were OK, and many more that were just too hoppy. However, prior to this explosion of micro breweries, a small company started several years ago in Ontario - larger than most microbreweries today, but still small. Named after the town it is located in Creemore Springs to me bridges the gap between the the mega Molsos/labatts and the endless bunch of microbreweries out there.Suggest you give it a try.As for Steamwhistle.... like making love in a canoe (effin close to water!)LOLBut if you can find Labatts 50 - none of your buddies will touch it so you don't have to worry about that."

I like to have a little IPA or something 'hoppy' on hand. But I'm not as young as I used to be and can get by with just about anything - and not much of it. 30 years ago my brother, his brother in law and I waited for the Beer Store in Dryden to open - we were there too early on a Saturday morning.

Monsoon cdn, labatta blue and Kokanee (since many have mentioned it...although outside western Canada it never caught on except for a brief time 25 years ago or so.

I find that there are differences in the taste of the beer between the provinces of Quebec and Ontario.Cans are the way to buy beer. All of the experts agree on this.Here in Quebec, there are no Beer Stores like in Ontario. You can buy beer in any grocery store or convenience store. This way, a person can buy a dozen different beer brands and put them in a case and buy the beer by the dozen which is a lot cheaper than buying 12 individual beer cans.I steer clear of any light beer with lower alcohol percentage because it's actually beer with additional water. Nothing under 6% for me.Bud Lite, Coors lite and Blue Lite are always on special here in Quebec. They are of inferior quality.Moosehead is made in New Brunswick....or was the last time I tried it. I don't like it.I tried Sleeman's once and it was ok but at the time, I was playing in a blues band, it was hot and we were playing hard to an appreciative crowd.

2041561,edwilson,2013-08-19 20:54:00,2,"Most Canadian beer comes in cans as well as bottles. I believe the reason for this is that we love camping and cans are way better when you are camping than bottles for several reasons. In any case, you will find that if you buy the big brand names like Molson, Labbatt's or the U.S. based big names like Coors or Coors Light (why anyone would even bother drinking something as tasteless as Coors Light is beyond me) you will be paying over $40 for a 24. There are many smaller breweries that produce a good tasting Canadian beer and are not so pricey. Try James Ready 5.5 beer. It is under $30 for a 24 including deposit, is great tasting and has just a bit more kick. Laker is another brand that is inexpensive and has a pilsner, a lager as well as a stronger beer. Go into a beer store anywhere you are and as long as the place is not hopping on a Friday afternoon on a long weekend, the staff will take the time to discuss your choices. It is all good Canadian beer eh... Oh, by the way, most Canadian beer stores will accept maple syrup as legal tender"

Not too fond of their ales though. Brick and Lakeport are discount brands. Although, I think Brick has changed to be more upscale.
