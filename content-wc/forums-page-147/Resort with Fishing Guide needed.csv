6228682,eyeonforever,2018-08-01 23:11:00,1,"I'm coming to the east side of Canada looking to catch a trophy walleye. I've caught several 29"" ones but would like to have one a few inches longer for pictures and maybe get a replica for the wall. I have $1,500 - $2,000 for a party of one and would like to be to have at least 3 full days of guided fishing and lodging for this price. I've previously been able to get 5 days for this price.I do not want a fancy resort that wants to feed me and changes guides every year and they don't know where to fish. I want a guide who knows a lake where I can catch a large walleye. I also love small mouth bass and Northern for a good fight.Ive had to take 2 days to drive in from Iowa through International Falls to fish in Ontario. Although I could come up further east near Thunder Bay. I just need an excellent guide and a lake full of trophy fish. Do you have any suggestions?"

6228776,mjayn,2018-08-02 08:24:00,1188,What fun is a mount if you didn't find the fish yourself?* edit. Sorry I don't know your situation. I do hope you get a big one. Good luck.

6228862,bthomas3333,2018-08-02 12:03:00,465,"I had the same desire a few years back. I had landed a 29 at 12 years old and had quested after a 30+ for dozens of fly in trips to different lakes. I finally decided I needed a lake with a catchable numbers of trophy walleyes. I believe ALMOST all lakes have a few but do they have catchable numbers? In the end I decided to fish Hawk Lake. It was drive in and offered both Trophy Walleyes and tons of Smallies.Of course I had a plan to only fish prime time no matter how crappy the weather was. I was also willing to do 4 day trips as many times as it took to get into the big one. If it took 5 years sobeit. I would never put all my eggs in one 3 day trip and assume I could catch a trophy 30+ walleye ANYWHERE. I have posted trip reports over the years if you want to see how I have done.Someone mentioned Budd's, check their leaderboard on Facebook. They post it every 3-4 days. You will see a lot of over 28 and a few 30s every few days. Hawk posts their end of season numbers on their website under weekly reports. As someone else mentioned you might want to look at Green Bay, Erie, Detroit River. In both cases the fishing will be very different, but big water = big numbers of trophies. I was never a huge fan of plainer boards or down riggers, but a few weeks of the year they def get into some big walleyes. You might also want to look at Tobin Lake in Saskatchewan. It is also all trolling but they also have catchable numbers of trophy walleyes.Good luck!B-"
6228880,MrSimon,2018-08-02 12:50:00,922,"Check out the St. Lawrence River. The NY state record was caught this Spring and weighed over 18 pounds. The average size walleye in that river is bigger than any Ontario lake I've ever been on. The numbers certainly don't compare, but the potential for a 30+ is absolutely there. There are plenty of guides, but I don't know if they are the type who can legitimately up your chances at a trophy. Nighttime trolling produces the biggest ones I've seen, and I don't know any guides who do that. I hired a guide on that river once in search of walleye .... we just drifted bottom bouncers in deep water all day and didn't get anything of note. I went out the next day on my own and drifted swimbaits and jigs over rocky shoals in 12-22 fow and caught my personal best eye at 28"" and FAT. And no lie I had a legit 30"" shake off at the boat at midnight in August a few years back ... that was in 6 feet of water. Deep cold water and unlimited gobies to eat are making them grow gigantic. Maybe you could connect with some locals who would help you out."

6230258,Obabikon,2018-08-06 07:36:00,2370,"If all that matters is it being 30""+.... Lake Erie. Other lakes aren't going to be anywhere close. The nice thing is you can fish the East side without traveling terribly far."
