6220854,Hook_settr,2018-07-13 03:51:00,127,"A buddy and I are heading up to LOTW and fishing out of Morson the last week of September. Would anyone be willing to share any information on what we should expect in regards to Fall fishing patterns/techniques and weather conditions? We typically fish for walleyes, smallmouth, northerns, musky and crappie in that order.I have been to this area three times in the last 4 years but always in early June, never at the end of September. Thanks in advance for any knowledge passed along!"
6220938,fishingMN4eyes,2018-07-13 08:20:00,108,"Been up the last two years in September and we fished them the same way we do in the summer. Jig/minnow, bottom bouncers, and jiggin rap all produced walleye. Lots of keeper fish but not a ton of size. Not sure if our presentation was wrong or if the bigger walleye migrate from that area in the fall or....? Would love to get into the crappie up there but I don't know the secret spots that are discussed around here."
6220966,Obabikon,2018-07-13 09:28:00,2370,"Small mouth are the only ones that will be difficult. They will be deep. You can jig them with tubes on 10' reefs if you want, but it isn't as much fun as summer fishing them on the bank. Walleye will be relating towards mud or deep humps (depending on weather patterns at the time) Crappie will be in their fall pattern... deep. Northern miles bay/elbow will both have fish. Northern will be in the backs of broken down mud flats. Try Obabikon Lake if you want numbers. Musky and big pike will be on rock piles and sand beaches."
6221078,Bill Krejca,2018-07-13 12:33:00,6107,"What Jared said. If you reverse the order of species wanted and fish for crappies, you'll get all the rest at the same time. My life time largest small mouth - 6-1/2 pounds was caught deep, fishing crappie in Obabikon. Bill"
6221180,Hook_settr,2018-07-13 17:19:00,127,"Thanks for the good information guys. I have ventured out to Miles Bay and into Obabikon in the past so I am somewhat familiar with the area.I have tried scouring the internet for info on LOTW for this time of year and the little bit that I have found talks about current areas and neck downs. Any thoughts on that? I know the lake flows to the NW so are they just talking about narrow areas in the main lake that funnel the water down?Also, can a guy even get a camp boat back into Obabikon? I thought the lake was low this year.Thanks gentlemen!"
6221204,Obabikon,2018-07-13 18:08:00,2370,Neckdowns/channels are certainly solid spots for walleye. The north side of Rabbit Island... just past Burrows is a great fall walleye spot. 20 feet deep channel that they load into. Getting into Obabikon is not a problem at all now. We're back to normal water levels.
6221756,Ia Walihntr,2018-07-15 11:15:00,320,Where are you staying this fall. My group will be on the lake (same area) the same week you will be.
6221860,Hook_settr,2018-07-15 16:51:00,127,We will be enjoying Justin's hospitality at Mylie's Place that week.
6228676,Ia Walihntr,2018-08-01 22:25:00,320,"I,ll see you at Mylies. same week. (One of the guys in our group is from Ankeny) What cabin are you in? We will be in 4B."
