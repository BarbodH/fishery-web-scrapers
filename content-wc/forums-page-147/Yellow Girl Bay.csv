Considering LOTW because of distance, would like to bring my own boat and sounds like the lake is mapped with the LOTW Lakemaster chip. From the research I have done itâ€™s sounds like Yellow Girl Bay is a good place for Walleyes. Are there resorts in somewhat close proximity? We are looking for clean cabins with good fishing and a few resort activities as a bonus. Swimming especially. Thanks for the advise in advance."

6229734,oldlund,2018-08-04 16:08:00,209,"Crawford's is a nice place. Yellowgirl I think might be a good early season spot, but when I fished it last week if June we were better off in the big water past yellowgirl rock by a few miles. That's a long run from Sioux Narrows. Just something to consider. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"
