My wife walked in to our cabin and was so happy to see sheets and towels!From the minute we got there we were treated like family. Gord and his wife make sure that you have everything that you need for your stay there.Fishing was great after Gord gave us his ""go to spot"". We caught plenty of Walleye each trip out and didn't have to go very far to find them. It was a family vacation, so we didn't really fish too hard all week. The entire camp is spotless and have plenty for the younger kids to do. We will be back for sure!William"
6227178,BreezyPoint,2018-07-29 14:55:00,1581,I have been to Gord's place multiple times. I concur with your post. I have been a lot of places in Ontario and place him in the top two!I am sure I will be back there again (if Gord wants us rabble rousers)!Frank
6227516,v-bay gord,2018-07-30 10:56:00,3168,I accept rabble rousers and even Trump supporters / cult members. Thanks for the positive feedback!

6227800,zeebee,2018-07-31 05:06:00,1144,Do Trump supporters make for good bait or do they smell funny? Bet they lie about what they catch.The diff between Trump supporters and a cult is the latter has some semblance of logic.

6227888,v-bay gord,2018-07-31 08:04:00,3168,"Politics should be something that you can agree to disagree on and have a lively debate. There is a reason why one of my buildings has a sign that says ""A##holes Garage"". Apparently I can still make people feel at home even though I tell them their political choices suck."
