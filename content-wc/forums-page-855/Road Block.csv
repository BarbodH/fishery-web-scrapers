533497,Arkie eye jerker,2003-07-15 10:03:00,228,"Just returned from Lac Seul a couple of weeks ago, and wanted to relay that when we were going there on Hwy. 17 at Upsala the OPP had a road block set up. They were stopping all vehicles going either direction. (Sunday afternoon, apprx. 2 p.m.). When the officer walked up to our vehicle he said ""We are checking for open alcohol containers and also if you have any alcohol possesion in the driver/rider area of your vehicle. We didn't so he just made a cursory check and sent us on our way. Just thought I would pass this on as a warning any case any of you were thinking on having a cold one on the road. Is it illegal to have alcohol in the driver/rider area of your vehicle even if it is unopened or was the officer just curious? I know an opened container would have been illegal. The officer was very professional and courteous."
533510,Mahumba,2003-07-15 12:18:00,345,They don't want it accessible at all. Must be in the trunk or box of a pick up. Roger mayer.
533512,Guest,2003-07-15 16:01:00,0,"I was in Canada the week of June 21st. I have never seen so many OPP. Especially between Ear Falls and Red Lake. I would take your time, enjoy the scenery and remain within the speed limits."
533514,Guest,2003-07-15 16:10:00,0,"One time, in Sask., an RCMP followed us right into my buddy's yard at my buddy's farm and checked us over. We had a cooler in the back of our pickup and the cooler was inside the topper that was on the truck. In the cooler was a bottle of Lamb's Rum. The bottle had been opened, but we had not had anything to drink that day. Heck, it was 9 am and we were returning from the morning's goose hunting. But we got hassled pretty good about it. Finally, when I got out a pad of paper and a pen , wrote down his name and number and asked who his C.O. was, he backed off and left. I didn't think we were doing anything wrong. I still don't. I never did know what the RCMP's problem was? He kept saying we had liquor in a location that was not a legal location to consume it???? It made no sense, we were not consuming it. And...., we were in my buddy's yard. I never could figure out what was going on? Anybody have a clue?"
533517,Arkie eye jerker,2003-07-15 16:40:00,228,"That is the same week we were there. On our trip home going from Dryden to Fort Francis on 502, we must have seen at least 25 OPP on motorcycles in groups of 4 to 6, all were going north."
533525,Jig A Lowe,2003-07-16 05:38:00,87,"If you drive an SUV, like many of us do, where are you supposed to stash your alcohol so that it is not accessible to riders especially? Just another silly law or an inaccurate interpretation?"
533543,Minnow Man,2003-07-16 17:03:00,85,"The wife and I walk along hwy 105 daily, & pick up beer cans all summer long. Some people just don't get it."
533570,Guest,2003-07-17 10:30:00,0,The police are just doing their job. Every year these boys scrape up and float retrieve people who have drowned because of being drunk or hitting a drunk. I am Canadian and am pleased with the way they are dilligent. Keep the booze out of reach and you'll be OK.
533580,Bobby,2003-07-18 03:12:00,211,"Here in Manitoba the Liquor Control Act states that you are legally in the right if you place your opened container/box of alcohol/beer behind the second row seat in your hatchback or SUV, regardless of whether or not that second seat is in the upright or folded position. If its a closed (as purchased) container/box you can place it where you want. A little research will answer these questions. All Federal laws and Provincial Statutes are online. Anyhow, I like what Limiterr and Minnowman have to say. Booze and vehicles don't mix and the laws are law for a reason. ""Hold on to the boat, boys, she's gonna ram us!"""
533585,Guest,2003-07-18 10:02:00,0,"In sask you are only allowed to take booze from place of purchase to place of consumption. Apparantly it had been opened somewhere else. I would have written you the ticket and given you a buisness card, that way you wouldnt have to write down my name. :-)"
