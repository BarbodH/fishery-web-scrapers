Tried everything, but no pattern or bite was consistent. Fish were on their summer locations but just not biting. You could see them hanging suspended off the reefs in 20+ water. The occasional biters would be around 17. Would pick up a few here and there, but that was it. Not at all like it should be at this time of year. Weather was goofy as well. Rain, wind from all different directions, hot one day, down into the 50's at night the next. It was wierd all the way around. Group next to us has 30+ years experience in same camp, same week, and it was the worst they could remember. Rick and his group had the best luck,and thanks Rick for the tips. They worked hard so they deserved it. Got so frustrated by the end of the week, just went out and fished muskies. We did catch a few and that salvaged the trip. Of course, the beer was cold and the company super, so although the fishing was poor the trip was still great. Will be back next year to try again. The good news for those coming later is that once the weather pattern stabilizes those walleyes are going to be awfully hungry! Good luck to all."

Mostly on cranks, although we did well on spinners/crawlers and bouncers. Key for that was to keep it up off the bottom. Sorry you guys had such a tough trip...."
533664,Guest,2003-07-21 12:41:00,0,Fishing has been near excellent on the U.S waters of Big Traverse bay the past couple three weeks. Both the mainlake reefs with bait or deepwater trolling hardbaits are putting out numbers and good sized fish. Eaters are a tough commodity some days though.
533665,Guest,2003-07-21 13:55:00,0,"Eye, Did not try pulling cranks for the suspended fish, but did try trolling the reefs at different depths with crawlers/leeches as well as tried trolling points, deep bays, etc. Bottom bouncers didn't outproduce Lindy's during trolling. I suppose we could have tried crankbaits and if I get into a similar situation in the future, I'll give it a try. Have always figured that the suspended fish weren't biters no matter what, but I'm still learning the walleye game. Thanks."
533708,Cooker,2003-07-22 15:52:00,164,"Steve, I think your first mistake was listening to Rick:) He had an off week and ended up last in the fish count eventhough he was using the same techniques as the rest of us. We ran a lot of miles (180 according to my GPS) and hit a few fish on various reefs. It seemed like they would hit for a very short time a couple of times a day or we would only pick up one fish from each reef. There was a lot of dead time in between fish. Our total was good by our standards but probably not by others. We ended up with 83 fish over 14"" and 16 of those were over 20"". We released nearly all over 20"" including 2 - 28"", 1 - 27"", 1 - 26"" and a couple of 24s. Like you, we saw the suppended fish but did not fish for them."
533771,Guest,2003-07-24 08:00:00,0,Concurr with Cooker.....Rick doesn't always post good advice (you know how brothers are). :) Definintely need to think cranks and Nate will probably tell he told us so since he wants to pull cranks. Folks came back last night and said it was a bit slow but they still boated fish. They lost two props out through the channel to a toothy rock. There's a bit of paranoia about driving the boat in the main channel away from shore. Rumor has it the 'eyes are hot at Saylorville but the source will not cough up any info. Zoomie
