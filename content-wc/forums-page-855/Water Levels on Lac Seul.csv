533667,jbktzpresley,2003-07-21 14:13:00,4,I JUST RETURNED ON THE 19TH. LAKE LEVELS ARE ALMOST 5 FEET BELOW NORMAL. WEED GROWTH IS BEHIND DUE TO THE LOW LEVELS. THE CURRENT CONDITION HAS EXPOSED ALOT OF ROCK REEFS THAT ARE NORMALLY AT A SAFE DEPTH BY THIS TIME OF THE YEAR. WATCH YOUR PROP. HAVE A GREAT TRIP.

Kinda cool going to the old hot spots and seeing with my eyes what only my mind could imagine last year. Hmmm, shoulda picked up a few snagged rigs. Weedlines are generally undeveloped. I believe the fish are still trying to get into a pattern. Some shallow, some deep. Caught large and small fish together."
