One nite it storm really bad n my uncles boat bottomed out n put a big dent in the bottom. He just payed 2000 for a new paint job. I wouldn't reccomnd this resort. We had no help docking at all. We had to hunt down ppl each morning to get our minnows. If it was our fist time to lac seul it would of been awful they never told us a spot to fish n the maps they gave us were horrible they didn't even show mcken. bay

This was our first trip to Lac Seul. I thought Whitewing was a first class resort all the way. The week we stayed there we did have problems getting minnows at the end of the week but that was because their float plane had crashed and they couldn't get to any of their traps. They supply minnows to many of the camps in the Ear Falls area. You can't really fault them for the low water conditions either. I'm sure many of the camps are having a tough time with their docks under these conditions. The cabins were outstanding, the grounds well kept, and the food outstanding and we caught loads of walleyes - even some nice smallies. No complaints from me."

Did you pay for the custom war####e? Doing so would get you the service you seem to need while on vacation. It only cost a weee bit more.

Last year we went to Lac Seul Floating Lodges out of Hudson cause we wanted to see if the service was better there and it definately was 100% better than the Service at Whitewing, but the fishing is absolutely better at Whitewings end of the lake with less pressure on the fish. If you take the Houseboat out then you only have to deal with the people at Whitewing when you check in and check out. But you are on your own for the week and it is great. We went back to whitewing this year."
