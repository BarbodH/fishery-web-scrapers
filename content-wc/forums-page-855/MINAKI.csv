533523,Guest,2003-07-15 21:35:00,0,We will be heading up on the 19th and staying thru the 26th. Was wondering if anyone had any recent reports. Thanks in advance.
533569,IaCraig,2003-07-17 10:27:00,434,I am just bumping this to the top. I am going up the week after CLM so I'm curious on what's happening too? IaCraig
533573,Guest,2003-07-17 13:36:00,0,"Just left the minaki area on 7-16-03. The water level is very low, little or no current. Water temps were around 68-69. I personally did not fish around minaki, which I normally do, because of the current. Most of the fish (walleye) we caught were 20 feet or deeper. The usual spots were not producing as they had in the past because of a lack of current. The crankbait bite is just starting to happen and the fish weren't real agressive in hitting the bait. Jig and minnow or leech produce the numbers of fish crankbaits the bigger size. All in all not a bad trip but have had better. Fished mostly around the Dalles area(anywhere current was present) Hope this helps."
533578,IaCraig,2003-07-17 22:15:00,434,"Thanks for the info Fisheyes5. I usually fish Big Sand, did you try it up there at all? Maybe with the slower current I won't get any new dock rash when I get gas at North Star Resort by the RR bridge. ;) Every year I bump the side at least once when I try to get into those stalls, the dock gals are too nice to laugh at me but I am sure they chuckle under their breath. 8 days, 8 days, 8 days,,,,,,,, IaCraig"
533588,Guest,2003-07-18 10:58:00,0,"Craig.......I'm going to be there the same time you are, I was also up there about six weeks ago. Everyone is talking about how low the water is but up on big sand it's only about 1 foot below normal.....it just seems like it's low because it's been high for about the last five or six years."
533597,Reels,2003-07-18 15:13:00,2876,"I agree Aron, it isn't that bad. One thing we found is still fish the traditional spots, but cast cranks and spoons towards the shore. Fish were shallow, a friend who just got back said that pattern was still on. <{{}}><"
533607,Guest,2003-07-19 00:14:00,0,"The water as Arron stated is about 1 foot below normal. I'd think less than that, but given the way things have been it appears much below that. The crank bite is hot & all the usual summer spots have been doing great ! This year so far has been fantastic & those stupid (as we thought) rules they brought in are starting to pay huge dividends ! Good Fishen Rob"
533635,IaCraig,2003-07-20 11:00:00,434,"Thanks guys for all the info, I figured our normal bottom bouncing and trolling techniques would work again this year, but it is always nice to get a report as I anticipate the trip. Everyone had been so tight lipped the last 3 weeks I was wondering if fishing was just so good RTMG didn't have time to report, or if it was so bad that there wasn't anything to report. This year my buddy and I are both bringing our oldest boys(ages 8 & 9), and the grand-dads along to make it a 3 generation outting. The boys might be a little young for serious fishing, but the grand-dads are getting pretty old so we figured we better do the family bonding thing while everyone is able. I hope the weather cooperates because I'm really anxious to see my boy's reaction when he gets a 24+ incher on while bottom bouncing. Thanks again IaCraig"
533669,Guest,2003-07-21 15:37:00,0,"Craig....don't worry about the kids, I'm bringing my two boys as well (ages 2 & 5).....should be interesting....the wifes coming to. If I can keep them from falling out of the boat I'll be happy."
