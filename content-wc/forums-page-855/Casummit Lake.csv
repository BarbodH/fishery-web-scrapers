533741,Guest,2003-07-23 09:24:00,0,Heading up to Casummit Lake north east of Ear Falls in a couple of weeks. Anyone been there this year or last. Any tips would be appreciated. Thanks Bigfish
533747,Ivy,2003-07-23 14:35:00,556,"Bigfish, I am heading up to Cassumit in August as well when are you heading up?? Want to go with our group? Granted it's a guy trip i.e. a lot of beer, cards , tall tales etc. And you have to take your own fish off your own hook. Ivy"
533748,Guest,2003-07-23 14:47:00,0,"Ivy, Were going up in August also. If your the person I'm thinking of - your in our group. What do you look like? Bigfish"
533750,Ivy,2003-07-23 15:38:00,556,"Well, some people have said that I look like Harrison Ford / linbacker for the Bears. Look at the photo's in your office, am I in any of them holding up them huge Walleye? Can't wait to head North. Ivy"
