533684,Guest,2003-07-22 10:00:00,0,How were the water levels up there. Our gang fish just south of you on Pashkakogan and Medcaf. We will be there August 2nd.
533687,Guest,2003-07-22 10:02:00,0,Any fire restrictions?
533695,phishfearme,2003-07-22 12:05:00,1242,"ts - the day before we started our long drive to pickle, the outfitter called us and said to call him back before we leave because he was required to evacuate many of his camps due to the numerous forest fires. the next day, though, it started raining and it rained everyday for the next two weeks - so we were ok. i feel sorry for some of the groups who had to be yanked out. the water level was exceptionally low - as i believe it was in most all of northern ontario - and it restricted how far down river we could motor. but, it seems to have had a ""positive"" effect on the walleye. good luck on your next trip. - phish"
533696,phishfearme,2003-07-22 12:11:00,1242,"dave - yah, we boated (and dragged the boat) all the way up to those rocks you refer to. and, as great as the walleye were at the inlet at froats, we found two other ""narrows"" where it was much better - especially for size. looks like between the two of us, we can very positivly vouch for the entire area from otoskin lake to froats to bow lake. this just seems like ultra-prime walleye territory - phish"
533700,Guest,2003-07-22 13:02:00,0,Thanks. When were you there and how do get there from Pittsburgh? Have you been going up there for a few years?
533701,Guest,2003-07-22 13:41:00,0,Phish: THANKS! I'll run this by my group and see what they have to say.....sounds GREAT!
533729,phishfearme,2003-07-23 05:12:00,1242,"ts - we were there from 6/28 to 7/8 - we actually flew in at 4AM!!! 'cause if we didn't take that time slot, all the planes would be busy til late evening fighting fires. we drive thru OH, IN, IL (chicago area is always a pain), WI, then MN thru international fall, then 502 to dryden, to sioux lookout then on 599 north to pickle. about 1500 miles. we go to different fly-in lakes every year and this was our first time with albany river. we're flying outta armstrong next year. - phish"
533524,phishfearme,2003-07-16 05:23:00,1242,"my 4-man group did our annual 10 day ""week"" with albany river outfitters outta pickle lake to their bow lake outpost - a mear 5 minute flight north of pickle. to summarize: WOW! this was about the best ""pure"" walleye lake/river system we've been to - lots and lots of fish with excellent average size and we were fortunate enough to get two 27"", a 26"", a 25"", three 24"" and too many to keep track of in the 21-23"" range. combine this with a brand new hugh cabin (hot/cold water, solar lights, very well equipped) all for $725 each for 10 days and this was one of the best bargains in high quality walleye fishing we've ever seen. would highly recommend this outfitter and especially bow lake - only draw back was that the pike were small and the oven didn't work. contact me for more details. - phish"
533527,IaDave,2003-07-16 07:18:00,476,"Glad you had a great time. I remember talking to you last winter about your trip. The last time we were up there they were just starting to build that cabin, we were staying at Wettlaufer and when they picked us up Jerrel's wife & kid were flying into Bow Lake so we got to see the cabin then. Does Bow Lake have a portage lake you can go to? Also, will it sleep 6 with no problem? We have been to Wettlaufer & Otaskwin. We were at Otoskwin in Sept. and in about 4 hrs of pike fishing we caught 2-36"" & 2-34"". I liked Otoskwin,it has 2 rivers coming in and 1 going out and it is a small lake. Cabin is small but has a outside shower. I know Jerrel is slowly updating his cabins but I haven't seen a fly-in that is under $600.00 and still have that great of fishing. Only problem it is a 2 day trip to Pickle Lake for us."
533538,Larry S,2003-07-16 14:01:00,666,"Hi Bob, Glad to hear again of your excellent trip to Bow Lake. What week are you planning on going to Northern Outpost's next year? Larry S"
533547,phishfearme,2003-07-16 18:49:00,1242,"dave - it's a FULL two day drive for us from pittsburgh but this was worth it - that's also why we go for 10 days. about the portage lake - there officially isn't one BUT my buddy and i hauled an 8hp motor up a one mile portage to get to froats lake and more of the otoskwin river. jerrel has a 12ft leaky boat above the rapids up from bow - i think it's for moose hunters. we boated all the way up to the top of froats where the otoskwin river empties outta otoskwin lake into froats lake. we musta been the only people there (outside of canoers) for years. walleye fishing was incredible - we did 3 - 2man days up there and easilly caught 350 walleye up to 24"" - all from 4-5 spots. we saw 4 moose - cow + 2 calfs and motored slowly into the wind to within 50-60 yards of a hugh bull grazing in the middle of the dobie river inlet. this is the fun of going to a TRUE wilderness lake. it was worth hauling that motor - up and back. thanks for the post. - phish"
533548,phishfearme,2003-07-16 18:52:00,1242,oh yah - the bed setup is four sets of bunks in two bedrooms - this is what i consider perfect for 4 people - it allows you to spread out all of your stuff on the top bunk. six would be ok though - especially since the cabin outside of the bedrooms is so large. - phish
533549,phishfearme,2003-07-16 18:55:00,1242,"larry - we have obashi reserved from july 9 to the 19th but if they get any new lakes, we'll probably xfer over to one of the new ones and at a little earlier time frame. did you rebook at deardon? - phish"
533558,Larry S,2003-07-17 07:03:00,666,"Bob, We are going the early part of June,not sure of the exact dates. If new lakes are available will go to them,if not then back to Dearden Larry S"
533662,Guest,2003-07-21 12:25:00,0,"Phish: Always looking for a new place to try out....sounds like you had a great trip. Is there a website for Albany River Outfitters? Tried a couple of searches and couldn't come up with anything. If no website, can you share an adress? Thanks!"
533678,phishfearme,2003-07-22 06:08:00,1242,"bax - yah, their website is www.albanyriver.ca and i don't think they have email capability in pickle lake yet so the phone numbers are 807 928-2424 (the office at the airport) or 807 928-2112 (base camp - where they provide the first night lodging for free!!). good luck - phish"
533680,IaDave,2003-07-22 08:30:00,476,"Phish- When we stayed at Otaskwin Lake we walked the mile long moose trail down to Froats Lake. We fished off the rocks below the falls and caught a walleye about every cast also some nice nothern. Like I said in an earlier post I have fished Otaskwin & Wettlaufer with Albany River. I would not go back to Wettlaufer again but I really like Otaskwin. When we went none of the cabins had running water or showers. I think the only outposts that have a shower & running water now is Otaskwin,Bow, & Littleford,but I know Jerrell is upgrading every year."
