533574,Le pickerel,2003-07-17 18:18:00,18,I am going up with 15 other people from my place of business to Harrop Lake which is one of Thunderbird's outposts late this August. On paper this outfit looked good to us and the people I spoke to in making reservations were very kind and helpful. I will let you know when we have returned if the place lived up to our expectations. Le pic

The walleye are fast and furious with some Master Angler size (here in Manitoba that's over 28 inches) to be caught. However, the pike fishing is like nothing I've ever experienced before. My first trip in there I caught NOTHING under 36 inches. I'm not kidding. Biggest was 43 1/2 inches. When you catch a walleye you have to real it in QUICK or the pike will hit it, almost every time. I've never seen pike this ferocious. And, they were so hungry they were not scared of the boat at all. Ripping fish off the stringers, one guy got his hand bit by a pike, pike hitting pike, I've never seen anything like it. That was early June after a late ice-out. Flew back in a few weeks later and the action had died down a bit, this time we had to look for the fish. Still, caught nearly 70 walleye one evening. Didn't fish for pike at all that 2nd trip. As for the lodge/outpost camp, can't help you there, didn't stay there. I think it was an outpost for a main lodge thus making for cheaper rates. The company is Border Outpost though, if I can recall. I used to live on Family Lake, which is about 30-40 miles southeast of Eardley Lake. I believe Border Outpost has a lodge there as well (Shining Falls). Fishing on Family Lake can be slower with smaller size fish. Try Eardley, you won't be disappointed. ""Hold on to the boat, boys, she's gonna ram us!"""

We would fly from Fargo, stop at Winnepeg for customs and continue to Berrens River. Then they started flying from N of Winnepeg. Just tent camp then. I know exactly what you're talking about. We indeed did have Pike take W.E. on the stringer. Lot's of 20# fish. Still have one on my wall. And you're right, early in the year, we used to go over Mem day. Pike gathered at the river inlet feeding on Suckers. I was the last place ""Ol Pop"" fished before he died. Great Memories!!! Fishnut"
