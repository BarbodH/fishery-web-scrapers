This year was relatively slower than the previous three. 100 fish per boat was common in years past. I averaged at least 10 fish over 25 inches. No piggies for me this year. Fishin was slower on sunny calm afternoons (that never hurt Lac Seul before). However, we still caught lots of fish and did find a hot bite most mornings. Can't wait for next year's rematch."

That time we kept changing lakes and finally found a good bite in Botsford. A couple other times the numbers weren't as good as usual but the bite was still terrific by most standards. We seem to catch fewer really big fish than years past but the fishery remains awesome. Heading up Friday!!!"

Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."

The fish are usually pretty easy to find--especially as the summer wears on and they move deeper in tighter schools. The available maps aren't very good. They lack detail to say the least. Few rocks/reefs are marked on the lake and only a few show on the map. There is also lots of standing timber as Lac Suel was impounded and the water level raised quite a bit. On high water years there can be lots of floaters too. In this years burn area I was told there are a lot of burned off trees tipped into the water. When the levels return to normal it could be dicey for a bit. However, Lac Suel is real close to walleye heaven and certainly worth a trip. Many people hire a guide for the first day out just to get a feel for the lake. Hope this helps."
