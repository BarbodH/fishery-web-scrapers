533792,Guest,2003-07-24 19:44:00,0,You can expect the same treatment pretty much. The bottom line is don't have beer in the boat and don't break any fishing laws. Take time to read regs. Many people are charged because they did not know they were breaking the law.
533794,Guest,2003-07-24 20:14:00,0,"The fine is about $125 Candaian. A guy in my group got it with it about 3 years ago. There were 2 guys in the boat and they had a totol of about 4 beers. The O.P.P gave the guy driving the boat the ticket and made them pour out. They were pulled over by the police not a conservation officer and the police didn't even ask about fish, which they we legal on. No one in our group takes any beer at all in the boat anymore. I have had the C.O's. pull mo over in the past, maybe 10 years ago and checked fish. One time they didn't say a word about beer and the next time they made us pour out what we had with no fines."
533589,bubbalou,2003-07-18 11:14:00,29,Just had an interesting conversation last night on the fines for getting caught with beer in your boat in Canada. The man said it was a $1000 fine. Anybody know if that is true? He also said if you were over your limit it was a $1000 fine for each fish. Is he correct? Thanks
533591,Guest,2003-07-18 11:55:00,0,Sounds good to me!
533682,balsl6,2003-07-22 09:38:00,426,I believe they can also take all your equipment for either offense. I know they can for the fish and pretty sure for the alcohol?
533714,IA  DAN,2003-07-22 18:51:00,53,"I dont drive 750 miles to catch a couple a fish a day then get drunk.The limits are there to protect the fishery they have or we wouldnt be going back up.Leave the beer back at camp and you wont have a problem. Theres plenty of time to drink and tell your fishin stories when you get the fish cleaned and play alittle cards with the guys back at the cabin.One simple rule I go by when on the lake FISH Dont DRINK,when back at the cabin DRINK AND THEN DRINK SOME MORE. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."
533721,haybaylarry,2003-07-22 20:50:00,55,Here in Ontatio the fine is $75/ea. unopened in your posession in the boat. Not sure if it is higher for opened bottles. ALSO if you are caught over the legal limit .08 on the water the penalty is the same as on the street. You will get a stiff penalty and loss of your drivers license for a first time conviction....Larry
533730,Guest,2003-07-23 06:27:00,0,"That is one rule that I was unaware of. My friend and I had about a 6 pack a day (total - not per person) when we were out on the water. Most of the time the ice melted and it got warm, so if we were lucky, we'd get one or two each.....its not like we were getting hammered. I was there to fish, it was just nice to have that celebratory beer with my best pal after we landed the first fish on. Afterall, it was vacation. BUT, now that I know that rule, there'll be no alcohol in my boat next year. Geez, you'd think this rule would stand out, but I never read it or heard about it anyway."
533733,Guest,2003-07-23 07:27:00,0,"If I can't have any beer in the boat period (even unopened), how in the heck do I get my annual eight cases to my cabin out on an island? Geez, that's 192 beers @ $75 per beer = a $14,400.00 fine.....wow, sounds like another stupid law enacted without actually thinking it through."
533738,phishfearme,2003-07-23 08:59:00,1242,"aaron - the law permits beer in boat ""while in transit"" to residence or camp. - phish"
533743,Guest,2003-07-23 11:58:00,0,"my understanding of the 2 fish limit is that it is to discourage lodges on the us side from running over to canadian waters to fish and then returning to the us. this info was straight from a co at lotw last year. if canada wanted to 'protect the fishery' they'd do something drastic about the netting situation. when they do that i'll believe they care about protecting the fisheries. in 15 years at lotw i've never seen the 'no beer' rule enforced. in fact, it is basically ignored in my experience."
533787,Guest,2003-07-24 15:31:00,0,"The fines about $150Can and confiscation of your beer. Only one person gets charged unless the cop sees you and buddy drinking and then you all get charged. If the cop figures you got a good load on he'll check you for impaired and if you're over you'll go to jail untill a judge is available.The fine for too many fish or other infractions is not written in stone. There was a Canadaian here just fines $1500 for four fish over and loss of licence for two years. The average I see in the paper (and theres lots of them) is about $500 per occurrence. Thats one or two fish over or other ""minor"" offences. If you're really bad I've seen them to $5000 and loss of all equipment including your truck."
