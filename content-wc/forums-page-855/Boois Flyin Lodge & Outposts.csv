This lodge is much more than what you see on their website, which in itself is awesome. It is mainly housekeeping or you can purchase any meals that you would like at the lodge. The cabins are actually almost new log or log siding houses. Most are two story townhouse affairs. For the wife and I we had two bedrooms, one with a king bed, two bathrooms, living room with leather sofa and loveseat. Two decks over the water, kitchen with microwave, dishwasher, full size frig and a chest freezer. This is all on a 5 acre island on Trout Lake, which is 86,000 acres with 365 islands and only a 20 minute flight from Red Lake. The boats were 18' alumarine with 25hp Honda 4 strokes. The guides go out to a predetermined shore lunch spot each day and if you want to participate you just drop off a fish or two and they do the rest. It was a nice gathering in the middle of the day to exchange tips, strategy and lies. We caught lots of walleye in the 23-27"" range bottom bouncing with crawlers in 15-20' of water. We caught lots of lake trout in 90' of water both trolling with Little Cleos and jigging with a white 2oz jig tipped with a twister tail. The large northerns excaped us, but we caught many in the 25-30"" range using a black & orange Mepps Giant Killer and perch color 7"" Rapalas. The boys in the cabin next to us got a 30# lake trout on our last day there. There is also a complimentary T-bone steak night every Monday where you grill your own the way you want it. The owners, Jim and Tracy Booi and their staff go out of their way from 6am until 9pm to make sure your stay is anything and everything that you want. I am just another hillbilly from Missouri who realizes I am not in Canada anymore, but wish I was, as I type this from work in Springfield, MO!"
