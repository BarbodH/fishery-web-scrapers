My question is with the water levels being 5' - 8' below normal will we be able to get up the Altimeter River this year so we can Fish Broad Lake and Sunlight Lake? Also how has the fishing been at Manitoba Point and Stoney Point with the water levels this low? We have fished this area the last 8 years, but the water has always been high. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks, Team Kingfisher"
533718,Guest,2003-07-22 20:14:00,0,Take a canoe if you want to fish Broad/Sunlight lakes. The fishing has been good even with the water levels down 7-8' from last year. Fish the same areas you fished in past areas>We found them in the same area just moved out from shore in deeper water. Enjoy your trip

Stoney is excellant for fish up to 25"" --- when the wind blows into the point. Manitoba very good as well this year. Watch out for the nearly exposed reef off the point though. You may have to walk your boat into Broad the last 100 feet or so."

533760,Guest,2003-07-23 20:23:00,0,"Last year was up there and the water @ Broad lake was about 4' deep. With the water levels down so far, didn't even venture that far. The 2 weeks I was up, never heard of anybody going. Can't imagine that there is enought water to get a boat over? Could be wrong...."
533783,Guest,2003-07-24 12:25:00,0,"Fished just south of there last week, Sand Point and Kleiner Point area. Sand was hot all week, had good winds though to support it holding fish. Wouldn't be much more of a boat ride if you were going into Broad. Largest out of this area was 28"", a few of them and lots over 25"". Lots of eaters as well below slot. Have fun, wish I was going back. I will be in 330 or so days."
533805,Guest,2003-07-25 10:52:00,0,"I wouldn't bother going to Broad and Sunlight at this time of year. In the spring, when the water temps are so low on Lac Seul, it is worthwhile venturing up Altimeter to fetch the post-spawn eyes. At this time of year, there is just as many if not more fish to be had on Lac Seul, with far greater volume for larger fish and better opportunities for giants. Any reef or point with breaks to deep water and wind blowing on it will hold fish, guaranteed. As well, the best fishing in the Lac Seul basin in late-summer and early-fall is the mega sand structure. Monstrous underwater sand bars which are generally flat on top and slope away to deeper water on the edges are scattered throughout Lac seul. Fish are scattered on top but most feed at the edge of the break (due to geology and local geomorphology the top edge of these breaks are generally 12-18'). As the season progresses, the active fish slide deeper down these breaks, though quick weather changes can send them shallow again. Local knowledge generally prevails in knowing these breaks, but with some scouting you can find them. Some are several kilometers in size!! If things are slow around Manitoba Point, venture south and east."
533807,Guest,2003-07-25 11:38:00,0,Anybody know of any of these sand structures in the South Bay/South Inlet area of Lac Seul???
