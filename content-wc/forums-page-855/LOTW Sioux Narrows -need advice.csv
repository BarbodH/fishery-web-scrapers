Are leeches working best? Or minnows? Also, when we cross the border into Canada from US, does anybody know what the restrictions are on bringing alchohol into Canada? What are the limits?"

I would also use minnows, that is usually the forage of walleyes in that area of the lake, along with crayfish. If you plan on fishing this area plan on fishing open water reefs or some of the shallow areas of Snake Bay/Knickerbocker Inlet."

Walleyes were tough. Had to work for them which is the case sometimes. Caught several large fish, which is always a bonus. Used firetiger most of the time and fished deep edges around shallow reefs. Most fish were caught in 15-20ft of water. Only certain reefs held fish. Don't waste to much time on one spot waiting for something to happen. Jump around until you find them. Hopefully the fishing will pick up by the time you get there. Have fun."

We had to go to 40 feet of water to catch any walleyes. the northerns were still in shallow weed beds though. Jigs and minnows is what we used. It almost seemed like the deeper you went the bigger the walleyes were. We went as far as the sunset channel, that was just past the smiley face painted on the rock. I know somepeople know where that is. I am hoping to go back up in september sometime again."

Oh well, the fishing was still good, just a little slow compared to the previous years. Has anyone ever experience such low water levels on LOTW?"
