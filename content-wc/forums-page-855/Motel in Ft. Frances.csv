Red Dog, Super 8, Rainy Lake Hotel, Kettlers Garden Resturant, Mid-Town, Makabi Inn, Rainbow and Baview. Any suggestions. Or places to stay away from? Ivy"
533778,Guest,2003-07-24 10:42:00,0,The super 8 is nice and right on the road out of town.
533784,Trailerguy,2003-07-24 13:01:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I'd second the Super 8, it's easy to find."
533790,fishmaster,2003-07-24 18:17:00,209,Try the Rendevoux(sorry if spelled wrong) real nice place to stay and the price is not bad. Nice bar good food.Nice scenery while sit back and have a couple of cold ones.
533795,Guest,2003-07-24 20:47:00,0,"Red Dog is nice if you want a beer and food,,, super 8 is right next door so just as good... The dog is a little run down compared to super 8."
533797,Guest,2003-07-24 23:52:00,0,"We have stayed here the last 10 years after staying at the red dog in once. Its called La Place Rendez-Voux, and the spelling is right off their business card. Toll free number is 1-800-544-9435. As was said its very nice, probably the nicest with a good view of the lake if you get a room on that side and good restaurant. Its on the edge of town going east. Its a good idea to get accross the border that night instead of trying the next morning."
533799,Ivy,2003-07-25 06:23:00,556,"Gentlemen, Thanks for the information. Making it across the border Friday night rather than Saturday morning makes a lot of sense. Should get to the border between 6 and 7 in the evening. Hopefully there won't be much of a wait at that time. Ivy"
