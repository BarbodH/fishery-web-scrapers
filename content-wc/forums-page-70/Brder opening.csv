6580334,Mojo-NC,2021-07-19 13:10:00,1929,"Yes, it appears that the outfitters were given some unofficial advance notice, but not a specific date. My lodge called me on Friday to say they were told the border would re-open ""mid-August"". Of course our trip was scheduled for July 31 - August 7th. We rescheduled for the second week of September. Woohoo, we're going to Canada. Airfare also went up $150 per ticket since yesterday, but we had to wait for confirmation from the Canadian government. It's worth it."

6580342,Eckohlt,2021-07-19 13:21:00,3685,Ya the mods are probably sucking down a few cold ones now.
6580344,djk50164,2021-07-19 13:27:00,370,So good for me that I have a place in Canada and I can name my cabin as my quarantine spot but what are travelers going to use if the only have a place to stay for a week. All travelers are required to have a quarantine plan to be able to enter. Not sure how this is going to work.
6580346,Eckohlt,2021-07-19 13:30:00,3685,"I'm sure the border wants to keep it fairly simple to cross and not rocket science,they want it to go smoothly just like the person crossing does."
6580352,Hookhunter75,2021-07-19 13:40:00,60,I have a feeling if they don’t feel you meet the requirements you might as well turn around. I am in BC for a month but I am driving across the country in my truck. I will be staying alone in AirBnbs. If they need anymore quarantine plan than that I was not meant to be in Canada
6580356,troutwater,2021-07-19 13:51:00,299,"This makes me very happy to hear. I have a trip booked for August 7th-14th, so it could get kind of tricky"
6580364,Larry S,2021-07-19 14:16:00,665,This Vermont Post is wrong. You must take a Covid Test within 72 Hours of entering Canada even if you are Fully Vaccinated. This is the Criteria for entering Canada as per the Canada Government Website!
6580368,Hookhunter75,2021-07-19 14:20:00,60,What will the quarantine plan look like we are responsible for? I wonder if you will still need to present a plan if you are exempt.
6580372,djk50164,2021-07-19 14:27:00,370,They better get those fires under control or there might not be any place to go. This is sioux narrows area.
6580272,Andre (wallyandre),2021-07-19 11:53:00,2274,August the 9th. is the opening date . The US residents need to prove that they have receive both shots 14 days +

6580310,stjoeguy,2021-07-19 12:50:00,979,"1. Don't take my word for it. Watch for official announcements. 2. Last I saw the requirement was for a molecular test, not an antigen test. 3. Here's a website with testing sites in Minnesota. I'm looking for the nasal swab molecular (or maybe pcr, we'll see what they say). https://mn.gov/covid19/get-tested/te...ions/index.jsp 4. Good idea to test 48 hours in advance in case there's a false positive and you need retesting the next day."
6580314,stjoeguy,2021-07-19 12:52:00,979,"By the way, I just got a call from my outfitter and he's floating on air and his phone is ringing off the hook."
