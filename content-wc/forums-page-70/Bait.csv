6580826,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2021-07-20 13:26:00,240,"Exactly--I have no problem spending money for bait in Canada, especially when so many of the outfitters and bait shops are cash strapped. Yes, it is going to cost more, but the bait shops I have always frequented over the years have provided a good count on the minnows and other baits. A group of 5 or 6 is going to spend an extra $100/person for a week's worth of minnows/leeches. Just part of the cost."
6580832,prov1800,2021-07-20 13:38:00,5010,Exactly.Most important part of a fishing trip is lively life bait.I never leave the dock without them and plenty of them.

6580838,jambi,2021-07-20 13:59:00,504,"Crawlers carry ""the 'vid"" ?!?"
6580846,Eckohlt,2021-07-20 14:07:00,3685,It's a new strain.
6580858,MN_Moose,2021-07-20 14:12:00,964,"There is no mention of changes to the Ontario Fishing regulations for 2021 pertaining to night crawlers or salted minnows. ""It is illegal to bring any crayfish, salamanders, live fish or leeches into Ontario for use as bait."""
6580870,Wallychowder,2021-07-20 14:18:00,1567,"How about ""frozen"" minnows ? What do they carry ?"
6580872,adempsey2.0,2021-07-20 14:18:00,611,"I do not think the new regulations include worms. At least, I could not find anything the mentions worms.The purpose of this strategic policy is to provide direction for the sustainable use and harvest of bait (i.e., baitfish and leeches) in Ontario. In this policy, ‘bait’ refers to both baitfish and leeches (live or dead). It does not include crayfish, frogs or worms.https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/019-0518Basically, they have established Baitfish Management Zones where you cannot transport live or dead bait between the four zones.The movement of bait, including commercial bait, angler purchased bait and personally harvested bait, whether dead or alive, is limited to the four Bait Management Zones (BMZs) shown in figure 1. BMZs are defined regions within which anglers and commercial operators may move their bait. Anglers and commercial operators are only allowed to move their bait within the zone where the bait was harvested, with a few exceptions identified in section 3.2. edit: I also do not know if this has been enacted. I did not find any amendments to the Ontario Fishery Regulations under the federal Fisheries Act or Ontario Regulation 664/98 (Fish Licensing) under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act.edit2: I called the MNRF and they said it does not look like this policy has been enacted yet. I am trying to get ahold of the policy makers to confirm. However, I am pretty sure it's business as usual and you can bring in dead bait and worms as was done previously.I also just noticed this statement on the Ontario fishing website: ""We will continue to work with industry on the new rules, and we expect it will take a few years for all new rules to be fully implemented.""https://www.ontario.ca/page/fishing-live-bait"

6580926,Obabikon,2021-07-20 15:47:00,2370,"My worry is bait shortages. There are times every year where our local bait dealers just can not keep up. All this will do is make demand even higher, and it will be harder to provide bait."
6580646,Eckohlt,2021-07-20 03:58:00,3685,"I just opened a private message from born to fish,he said he will no longer fish Ontario due to the fact that you can longer bring salted minnows or crawlers to Canada,anyone else know if that's true or not?"
6580666,Huntindave,2021-07-20 05:38:00,2194,Any question about legal issues are best answered by the governing body in charge of said regulations. Contact the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry office in the appropriate providence in Canada where you wish to fish.

6580724,BornToFish,2021-07-20 07:16:00,1224,"Greetings, I recently spoke with a good friend in NW Ontario. He told me that he had heard about a new law in Canada prohibiting people from bringing dead or live bait into Canada. I called the border crossing in Fort Frances, Ontario last night and spoke with a woman in customs. She said that I would NOT be allowed to bring crawlers in bedding or salted minnows across the border, as I have routinely done in the past. As before, I would NOT be allowed to bring live minnows or leeches across the border. There was precisely ZERO uncertainty in what she said to me. Of course, verify this information to satisfy your curiosity. Anglers may want to have back-up plans in place if this information stands correct. My wife and I will be fishing in NW Ontario in mid-August. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6580730,prov1800,2021-07-20 07:26:00,5010,Plenty of bait available in Canada.
6580744,Wallychowder,2021-07-20 08:12:00,1567,Just talked to bait shop in CANADA. Its true ! No crawlers in bedding ! In fact he had to go across to US to get crawlers (Canadian crawlers mind you) and he had a heck of a time at border. Says canada having hard time getting crawlers.
6580770,Obabikon,2021-07-20 10:11:00,2370,"This is all such a crock of BS... I hate that they feel the need to make things harder ALL THE TIME. Never easier... always harder. We are very concerned about bait shortages, and they do this during a horrible time. So we are clear... everything above is indeed true."
6580778,Lovetofish,2021-07-20 10:49:00,458,It's just another form of tax.
6580792,MikeF,2021-07-20 11:22:00,895,"If this is something new for 2021, was there an official statement issued that explains the rationale for the change in regs? Just curious"
6580798,fishman10,2021-07-20 11:32:00,226,He will no longer fish because he can’t bring worms or salted minnows?&#x1f926;&#x1f926;&#x1f3fb;And to think I had issues!Thanks for making me feel better &#x1f44d;&#x1f44c;
