However, I can still afford about 700.00 for a trip. Could only do about 4-5 days though. Would like to do it the next few weeks as well. I love the red lake area. Need to rent a boat. I am a solo usually. I cook for myself. I fish for walleyes and that is what I target. Any thoughts???? Thank you."
