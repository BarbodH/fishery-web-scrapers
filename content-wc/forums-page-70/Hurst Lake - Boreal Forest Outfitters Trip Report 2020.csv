6583872,Walleye Wanderer,2021-07-27 20:01:00,101,"Hurst Lake 2020 Last years trip to Hurst Lake located on the Attwood river system began like most other Walleye Wanderers annual trips at our 4am meeting place in Woodbridge, Ontario on July 3rd. The trip up to Nakina was similar to the many years past with the exception of not being able to stop at a restaurant and dine in, but rather everything along the way was a take out event. The other new twist was that masks were required at all of our stops along the way and it was quite apparent that the COVID-19 virus ruled the day in 2020. Extremely hot weather and lots of bugs may have contributed to the 2 moose that were seen on our drive and Ron and Frank had a particularly close encounter with 1 of them, testing the braking system of their Ford Escape and narrowing missing a collision with a big behemoth. We arrived safely in Nakina around dinner time and after a short tour of town we located the Boreal Forest Outfitters base camp house in the south end of town. Shortly after arriving our hosts Jason & Sue arrived and greeted us with hats, maps and good advice regarding their Hurst Lake outpost. The base camp is a beautiful full house with several bedrooms, two washrooms, equipped kitchen and big deck a very nice place to spend the night and only a few minutes from the floatplane base. After some dinner and an adult beverage or two, the Wanderers hit the hay in anticipation of an early flight to Hurst the next day. Upon arriving at the Nakina Air floatplane base Saturday morning it was very obvious what the impact of the COVID virus means to our friends in Nakina. The usually packed parking lot was virtually empty and where pickup trucks would normally be parked sat a De Havilland Turbo Otter and a Cessna Caravan! Backing into the unloading area we were greeted by Greg and Tracey from Nakina Air, both donning masks and asking us to wear them when we enter the dock area and on the plane. We were soon loaded up on the sole Turbo Otter, Jason & Sue gave us some last minute tips and we were in the air with Alex (our pilot) at the controls. After a great, smooth flight into Hurst we were treated to a quick air tour of the lake by Alex before making the smoothest landing I have ever experienced. We were soon lugging our gear up to the spotlessly clean 2 bedroom cottage and after unpacking the essentials, the Wanderers were all quietly prepping rods and reels, wanting to get out on the lake asap. Saturday was very hot with nearly no wind and the bugs were certainly in attendance. Our group of 4 toured around Saturday, wetting a line, trolling mostly and hauling in a few decent Pike in the mid 30 range and a bunch of nice Walleye. After several hours on the lake we headed back to camp to finish unpacking, getting some dinner and enjoying a beautiful relaxing evening with the sun not setting until nearly 11pm. Sunday was another hot day and sunscreen was the ticket to keep from getting crispy during a long day in the boat. Although not ideal fishing weather, it certainly was a beautiful day to spend on the lake exploring Pike and Walleye holes with lots of good-sized fish caught and released. The rest of our week was pretty much the same as far as weather was concerned, sunny, warm and mostly calm every day. The weather although nice was not necessarily our friend in helping to locate and entice a big Pike into the boat. We did locate some very nice Pike in several areas of the lake and were pleasantly surprised to find a nice mid-lake weedbed east of the camp toward the Attwood River flowing out of Hurst where several nice Pike were boated and released over the week. Walleye were plentiful in many spots and typically found on rocky points, drop-offs and pretty much anywhere there was structure but for ridiculous non-stop Walleye action, a trip to the far west end of the lake where the Attwood river flows into Hurst Lake was the ticket. In fact it warranted a visit almost everyday and never failed to produce non-stop, good sized (19) Walleye action! Slipping up the Attwood river into the faster water and dropping anchor proved to be the sweetest spot and one nice day produced 10 fish in 10 casts for both my partner and myself yep, 20 Walleye in literally minutes with double headers a common occurrence. Boreal Forest's camp on Hurst Lake is honestly one of the nicest camps I have stayed at in over 30 years of trips north of Nakina. The building has vinyl siding on it and resembles a cottage you would find in southern Ontario, including a nice screened porch. Inside you have 2 good sized bedrooms with two sets of bunk beds in each room including a twin sized bottom bed in each room and plenty of space. The kitchen was very well equipped with full sized propane fridge and stove and a deep freezer on the porch. Solar lights throughout the cabin, a charging station for our electronics, a SPOT satellite text device and a great shower which had good pressure and a full sized hot water tank that worked flawlessly. Pine siding lined the cabin interior, solid, sturdy wood furniture and a great BBQ and fish fryer made the week very comfortable. The dock was wide and sturdy and made it a pleasure to land the newer boats on, beautiful sandy beach, heck even the fish cleaning shack near the shore was clad in vinyl siding, lit with LED lights and has running water! We even had a visit from Jason and Sue mid-week when they flew in on a check flight with additional bags of cubed ice and fuel, again demonstrating their dedication to ensuring their customers have an enjoyable stay with them. Boreal Forest Outfitters operates 8 camps north of Nakina and if you are looking for a trip where you will have great fishing, great accommodations and hosts whom work hard to ensure your trip is unforgettable, I recommended you contact Jason & Sue to get a trip booked. Until next year, fish on! Rob & the Walleye Wanderers"
