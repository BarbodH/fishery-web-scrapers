I had alot of hope that our August trip would happen but can certainly understand their decision and pray that they, and all the other outfitters, can weather this additional setback."

6580764,skimottaret,2021-07-20 09:46:00,40,looks to me that the fires have hit Roderick Lake and the Pine Island outpost cabin is in the fire zone... Also the portage lake boats will be toast
6584980,hoppy63,2021-07-31 05:19:00,367,I got a call from Chimo yesterday and she said they were opening there northern camps Aug 9th and wanted to know if I was interested for this year only.....but I am already booked elsewhere. There might be an option for anyone looking...

6585046,Hillbiehle,2021-07-31 08:34:00,66,I received the same call as well for our originally scheduled August 16th to 23rd. Unfortunately we booked through another outfitter and will move our Hornby reservation to 2022. I'm happy for Chimo that they are able to get at least some of their season back.
