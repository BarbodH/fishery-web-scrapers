So far in the time of it's use, I have had to re-boot it once, might be difficult to do from Denver, unfortunately if the internet goes out you will have no way of cycling the power remotely. I have seen two camera\security setups that US camp owners are operating off of Sat internet, but have no idea as to which systems they are using. A friend keeps an eye on one of the cabins with the system, he had to fly out to check on the cabin twice last winter after the owner called him that an alarm had went off, they seem to have the usual glitches as most security systems with the occasional false alarm. The other system I have seen is owned by a fellow from Texas (a tech guy) he even has a generator setup that he fires up remotely when the solar panels get covered with snow and are not producing. There are lots of fun options you can do remotely with the internet, but they are not fail-safe."

We have one on the front of our house and it works great. They are pretty cheap if you get it on sale ($79ish) and no monthly fee. The camera is wireless and links to the small hub that is plugged in via wifi. I can look live at the house anytime via the app on my phone and you can set it up to take video when motion is sensed. I assume it would probably work well at the cabin."
