They say some lures will dive 25' or more, but I haven't had luck getting them down that far without weight of some sort and the lures that dive the deepest, don't plan on holding the rod and trolling as you will either get pulled out of the boat or your arms will fall of by mid-morning. At least with lead core you can use smaller plugs and at least hold the rod and actually feel the fish hit."
6583586,CiscoKid,2021-07-27 08:03:00,28,"I was actually doing some leadcore research recently. I agree with you in that I like to hold the rod to actually feel the hit. I'm probably over complicating things and should just do what I know how to do, I just have never fished 20 -25' deep before so making sure I have a few techniques to try."
6583594,guidedfishing,2021-07-27 08:13:00,531,"20-25 feet is not really that deep, and we fish this time of year all the time in Canada. Don't get caught up in the I have to fish deep until the fish tell you they are there. Find the mid-lake humps and reefs anything in a group that is coming up 25 - 10 feet of water and put on a 2-3 ounce bottom bouncer and drag some crawler or minnow harnesses across those area's. Once you find them anchor or spot lock on that point and work them over with 1/4ounce jigs. Anything deeper and 35 feet and you will start killing walleye's anyway. you can put on some deep diving crankbaits like reef runners or walleye divers and with enough line out still get down in that 18ft range just long lining if you feel the need to troll. I guess my advice since I fish this time of year all the time in Canada is don't over think it. Start shallow work deep. I am sure you will find as I have that the fishing is as good or better than in the spring, and typically I don't fish anything deeper than 18feet and find plenty of walleye. Once you find them they will be bunched up. Good luck,"
6583658,adempsey2.0,2021-07-27 09:57:00,611,"I would troll Rapala Deep Tail Dancers TDD-09 or TDD-11, use blade baits/rip baits like the Rapala Rippin' Rap/RapV or Johnson ThinFisher etc, or just jig with a 1/2-1oz jig. As mentioned, you could also just add 2oz of weight and use whatever shallow cranks you have or go with slo-death/harness etc. You could also drift Lindy rigs if you are targeting the bottom and not suspended fish. I think it gets more challenging in 35-40+ FOW, but for me that's more of a Lake Trout depth."
6583672,Misdirection,2021-07-27 10:16:00,418,Rapala DHJ-12's will troll to about 19' and pull lots of walleye for us on Lake Erie and its tributaries. Sent from my SM-A505U using Tapatalk
6583726,CiscoKid,2021-07-27 12:21:00,28,"Thanks for all of the replies. I think I am probably overthinking things, but have certainly picked up a few new ideas to try. I'll report back on results."
6584060,gordy28,2021-07-28 12:25:00,437,"We typically fish the 3rd week of August and find walleyes anywhere from 25 feet to 5 feet For trolling crank baits we tend to focus on water between 18 and 5 feet. Go to lures are hot n tots, flicker shade and rapala tail dancers We also catch a lot of fish trolling bottom bouncers and crawler harnesses That would be our go to bait for 15 to 25 feet to locate fish and then we will try to sit on them and jig if we find a concentration of fish. I prefer a 1 to 2 ounce bouncer with a 4 or 5 Colorado double hook harness w a 6 Foot leader. Key is to keep your line on the bottom as much as possible so play w speed and long angle Have a blast! Andrew"
6584092,St Peter The Guide,2021-07-28 13:16:00,8,Jets now have a 10 & 20 ft model with a release like a dipsey does. Use in larger area of deep water. The bouncers are easy to adjust depth by feel and retrieving ot letting out line with even just a regular floating type bait that does not dive mush
6582408,CiscoKid,2021-07-23 14:21:00,28,"I'm headed into Canada 8/14. This is later than I normally fish and have been told most walleyes and smallmouth hold in about 25' of water mid-August where we are going. My Dad likes to troll. Any advice on trolling 20-25'? Snap weights? Drag 3/4oz jigs? I'm used to trolling cranks, but usually max of 15'. Open to be told not to even try to troll that deep and just locate and jig for them. Thanks all."
6582546,Clairebear,2021-07-23 19:09:00,937,What body of water are you fishing?
6582548,x4flatfish,2021-07-23 19:15:00,319,I go this time of year. I wouldn't fish any deeper than that. Fish caught and released have less chance of survival. We use bottom bouncers and crawler harnesses. We also use Rapala Ripin raps. For smallmouth I never fish that deep. Should be able to find them in 3 to 15 ft...
6582590,fishingfever,2021-07-24 04:08:00,85,That sounds like the appropriate depth for that time of the year. We regularly troll 20-25' deep. Plenty of manufacturers make lures that troll that deep. We usually use some from Rapala. Good luck to you.
6582592,last chance,2021-07-24 04:28:00,3262,"my goodness, you have tons of great crankbaits that will troll that depth and deeper. a bandit walleye deep runner will dive 27' when trolled an 800 reef runner will troll down to 28'. ant so many more will dive to 20' or better. a skinny stick and a deep little ripper are right at 21'. but I've always been told walleye like to feed up. so for fish at 20' you might only want your crank around 16' to 18' deep. shoot I would be very tempted to run standard hot n tots and wiggle warts 150' +/_ 50'. that use to be our go-to cranks on Erie's western basin when we started trolling for them. we trolled them somewhere from 100' to 200' as we used the spinning reels we had used for drifting so line out was a guess."
6582614,CiscoKid,2021-07-24 06:04:00,28,"Thanks all appreciate it, I might just need to add a few deeper running cranks to the tackle box. Going to Seine River chain near Antikokan (calm, banning, chub, and perch lakes) Can't wait to post a report when we get back!"
6582616,Eckohlt,2021-07-24 06:11:00,3685,Teach your dad to pound them on the jigs he would love it.
6582618,prov1800,2021-07-24 06:11:00,5010,Many ways to fish when the deeper bite is on.I personally hate trolling but will do it if that's what it takes.Had to do it the other day as the walleyes would not take a vertical jig.Was in 18 ft.1/4 oz jig slowly dragged along bottom had them jumping on it.Also made up a lindy rig with a half oz weight and dragged that along the bottom and that worked fine to.Rather just spot lock over top if them and dont have to go back and forth.Our shield lakes have structure and I find the schools get on them and only give you a short distance to troll before you need to turn back.Nornally much faster fishing if you can stay over top of them .
6582632,Eckohlt,2021-07-24 06:36:00,3685,"A really good rod is a must in jig fishing as far as I'm concerned,with good feel means more fish."
6582644,Ltrain,2021-07-24 06:54:00,4145,"Along with the advice to troll the deep cranks, you can also get harnesses down with either tadpoles or inline weights. Inline with a 7ft leader to a slow death rig can be very productive."
