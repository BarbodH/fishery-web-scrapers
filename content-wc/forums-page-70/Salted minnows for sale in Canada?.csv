6584100,Wallychowder,2021-07-28 13:22:00,1567,I have read that some lakes in CANADA a walleye would hit a bare hook ? Would that be considered a good lake !
6584118,Eckohlt,2021-07-28 14:25:00,3685,More like considered dumb fish.

6583930,DavKin,2021-07-28 07:32:00,104,"I'm looking for a bait shop near Thunder Bay that sells salted or live minnows in bulk/by the pound. We are scheduled to cross the border Aug. 27. 5-6 lbs. would be ideal. Thanks,"
6583934,Eckohlt,2021-07-28 07:41:00,3685,"I probably wouldn't bet on finding them in Ontario,take the stuff along and salt them up there.If you know how to do it?"
6583936,DavKin,2021-07-28 07:45:00,104,I will be happy to salt if I can get minnows by the pound in Canada.
6583940,fishnfood,2021-07-28 08:02:00,94,If you guys are wondering about taking salted minnows we were told by two different folks at the MNR that rule is under advisement and is not not in place for this year. After talking to them we are taking salted minnows as we normally do. You can take this as you wish but two different folks called and had the same response both times. Since one person was male and one female it was not the same individual.
6583942,Wallychowder,2021-07-28 08:08:00,1567,"It's not up to the MNR. It's a CBSA rule, But since there going on strike they probably dont care !"
6583944,Eckohlt,2021-07-28 08:15:00,3685,"Remember if you have to turn around and go dump them on American side,probably back in the end of the long arse line again,don't know for sure what they would make you do with the salties."
6583968,JAY221,2021-07-28 08:39:00,877,"I have not been able to find them from ft Frances throughDryden to Ear Falls. I have an email into the Canadian Border Service as to what is is or isn’t allowed with salted minnows. Later, Jay"
6584032,Hwy101,2021-07-28 11:31:00,18,Are frozen minnows available any where? I have been calling bait shops in Ft Frances and Dryden without finding any yet.
6584038,Wallychowder,2021-07-28 11:45:00,1567,Did you call clarks
6584046,Eckohlt,2021-07-28 11:53:00,3685,"Chowder is right,Clarks are the minnow guru's"
