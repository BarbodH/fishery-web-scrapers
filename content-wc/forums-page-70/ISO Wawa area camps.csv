6584044,Pink Unicorn,2021-07-28 11:50:00,83,"I have been fishing the same region of NW Ontario for nearly 30 years but will be looking to move our groups to the Wawa area. Any help would be much appreciated! We need two camps; Camp 1- Fly in cabins able to accommodate up to 30 people with a diverse age range (men and women). Housekeeping plan. Flush toilets, wifi, beaches, sauna or fire pit would be nice. Medium sized lake with both numbers and size for walleye and pike. Perch, lake trout or whitefish would be a bonus. Camp 2- Fly in Outpost able to accommodate up to 8 guys. Outhouse is acceptable but still clean accommodations. We want to be the only people on the lake. Medium sized lake with both numbers and size for walleye (30"") and pike (40""). Thanks in advance!"
6584070,adempsey2.0,2021-07-28 12:52:00,611,"As far as I know, the only groups operating out of Wawa are Watson's Skyways, Air-Dale and Hawk Air (nearby in Hawk Junction). Watson's Skyways charter's for two lodges on Kaby Lake:Pine PortageWatson's Windy Point Lodge They may charter for other lodges in the area, but the ones I know of use Forde Lake Air in Hornepayne or White River Air in White River. For the outposts: Air-Dale has several camps that can accommodate 8+:Fred LakeJohn's LakeLittle Missinaibi LakeMedhurst LakeNameigos LakeMoose Lake I would probably go for Little Miss or Nameigos. Little Miss does have 2 camps on the lake though. Hawk Air also has several camps that can accommodate 8+:Easey Point LakeDuffy LakeMosambik LakeWejin LakeLittle Missinabie LakePichogan LakeGoat Lake I would probably go for Easey, Little Miss, Mosambik or Wejin. If you want more options, you will need to travel to White River or Hornepayne."
6584076,St Peter The Guide,2021-07-28 13:01:00,8,"Little Miss best walleye lake by far, would not recommend Namegos(small eyes and almost no pike) also 2 camps, no where near the fishery LM is plus you can portage to trump lake for Lakers with AirDale's camp."
6584110,phishfearme,2021-07-28 13:54:00,1242,"yet another valuable piece of input from the master. however, do you find it a bit surprising that someone would want to go from NW ontario (fishing mecca - just look at all the blue on an Ontario map for this area) to Wawa/White River which has so much more pressure (many lakes close to help them ""recover""), fewer and smaller lakes and roads to many (and certainly to all bigger lakes)? we fished this area and the area east of this (Chapleau/Bisco/Foleyet) for years since it's so much closer to where we live - but for the past 25 years it's only NW ontario - longer drive but worth every minute of it. seems to me that one or two trips to the Wawa area and he'll be heading back to NW Ontario - especially after fishing there for 30 years. phish"
6584116,RichA$1970,2021-07-28 14:24:00,1159,Look into Agichâ€™s Kanu cabins on lake Kab. Big lake and they have a fair price.
6584122,adempsey2.0,2021-07-28 14:38:00,611,"Yes, you are right! I forgot about the White River Air camp on Nameigos.I haven't fished either, so was just going off the ""Armchair Warrior"" info I have.The portage lakes from Little Miss are a huge draw IMO. However, that depends on the person. The lake is also big enough that 2 camps might be ok. Again, depends on the individuals.Quote: Originally Posted by phishfearmeyet another valuable piece of input from the master.however, do you find it a bit surprising that someone would want to go from NW ontario (fishing mecca - just look at all the blue on an Ontario map for this area) to Wawa/White River which has so much more pressure (many lakes close to help them ""recover""), fewer and smaller lakes and roads to many (and certainly to all bigger lakes)?we fished this area and the area east of this (Chapleau/Bisco/Foleyet) for years since it's so much closer to where we live - but for the past 25 years it's only NW ontario - longer drive but worth every minute of it.seems to me that one or two trips to the Wawa area and he'll be heading back to NW Ontario - especially after fishing there for 30 years.phishI just assumed they have their reasons, be it cost and/or driving distance/vacation time. There are benefits to both. For me personally, if I want to fish NW Ontario it's a least a full day drive+ or I have to fly commercially (and then drive 4+ hours and buy all the food locally etc). I have more problems finding a group that can go than to worry about where we go!!"
6584132,Eckohlt,2021-07-28 14:58:00,3685,"I go alone if I can't find anyone,such as oct 1 I'm off alone north of Ignace."

6584464,Pink Unicorn,2021-07-29 15:27:00,83,My sister moved from Red Lake to Sault Ste Marie Ont. so we're hoping to find a similar fishing situation closer to where she lives. Hope we don't have the same experiences you did!
6584466,Pink Unicorn,2021-07-29 15:28:00,83,"Will do, thank you!"
