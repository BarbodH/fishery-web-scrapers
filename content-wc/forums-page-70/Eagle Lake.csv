6583412,Guest,2021-07-26 17:48:00,0,What part of the lake were you on East or West basins? Water level? How many public launches would you say are on the lake I know of one towards Vermillion Bay and one not far from Eagle River? Thinking of renting a cottage and meeting a guide at a local launch site if one is near a rental property. Thanks

We also stayed at that mouse infested Buzzard Falls cabin one year. Had good luck on musky and walleye down on that far end of the lake."
