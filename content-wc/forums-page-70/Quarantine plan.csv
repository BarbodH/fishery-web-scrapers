6584224,hoppy63,2021-07-29 04:38:00,367,"70% accuracy rate means 30 out of every 100 are potentially turned away. Definitely not acceptable. I don't see under any circumstances they would allow anyone across that has just tested positive. Was kind of a comparison to baseball meant to be humorous, not to be taken seriously...."
6584382,MikeAnkeny,2021-07-29 13:08:00,67,We are debating taking two vehicles in case one or some of our party gets deported. How much is gas? Looks like $1.41/liter Canadian. About $4.30/gallon US Extra vehicle mileage about 35 mpg or $0.12/mile YIKES!
6584390,Eckohlt,2021-07-29 13:26:00,3685,"If you want to get to great fishing grounds gas should be the least thing to wry about,try to hit the lottery getting through the border,that's what I wry about,but if you have all the right info shouldn't be a prob."
6584394,Eckohlt,2021-07-29 13:27:00,3685,You got to spend a sht load of money before you even get to wet a line!
6584396,MikeAnkeny,2021-07-29 13:35:00,67,Yeah I did some more figuring starting with twin cities as start and ear falls as target and it works out to about $90 gas alone assuming I can round trip the Canada miles without refueling in Canada.
6584398,MikeAnkeny,2021-07-29 13:36:00,67,Also there are no rental cars available for International falls with drop off in Twin Cities.
6584460,Ricky Spanish,2021-07-29 15:24:00,1298,"I used to grab 6-10 gallons before leaving Temple Bay at $6 something a gallon just to comfortably get back to the border. One year I brought a 6gal can of gas with me, but I didn't like having a gas can under my tonneau cover. It think it's about 250 miles round trip but towing my boat up and down 502 burns through a tank. My 2015 Tundra only had a 20gal tank. My 2021 has a 27 or 30. Mileage still sucks tho."
6583998,Hookhunter75,2021-07-28 09:25:00,60,I just hope the end of August means the end of Aug. I just need to cross on Aug 26
6584016,djk50164,2021-07-28 10:25:00,370,Sounds like you will have to stay within phone or internet service until you get your results. Only then you can continue your stay.
6584048,turkeyriver,2021-07-28 11:56:00,80,"I'm not worried about getting back into the states. My concern is in the case of a positive test for one in our party, will we be able to leave for home. By the evening of the day we cross, I'll be in Red Lake. Will we be legal to be on the road home without the quarantine stay first? If we got pulled over or had car trouble and it was found out we had a positive test aboard would we be fined and all quarantined at our own cost for 14 days before we could get back on our way home? FnF, I don't see how this is a non-issue for you just because you're going to a remote place where you see few people. I would be in the only cabin on the lake for the fly-in and obviously won't see anyone else either. I see the issue at a camp with lots of other cabins close by, and maybe a large dining hall which is probably the majority of people going fishing. Hopefully these questions are worked out before my Sept. trip which I think is getting less likely every day with more mask mandates and the delta spread. No politics involved here, Just looking for answers which may not exist."
6584072,St Peter The Guide,2021-07-28 12:54:00,8,"I called ArriveCan the other day and they were very helpful nd informative. They would no whether any fines could be imposed if you violate the laws willfully or not. They also helped with the quarantine section of the app, has to be a canadian address if you choose going back home, I put the address of the hotel staying at in Windsor night before flight and she said to explain at the border that if a random negative test I really would just go back across border to us, but you can't answer that online. Also if you ste up Arrive ccan with a date that is not the real date to get it to work you will probably be starting all over when you don't submit and check ""start over"". At least it ley me see what I needed and how to get thru the pages."
6584074,Hookhunter75,2021-07-28 12:55:00,60,As part of the quarantine plan does anyone know if when you cross the border if you have to arrive at your final destination the same day?
6584078,St Peter The Guide,2021-07-28 13:05:00,8,"No I told the lady my whole trip and that was not an issue. Driving across into Windsor, 1 overnight, fly thru YYZ to Ywg next day and 2 nights in ywg, then charter up to northern manitoba, then fly-in to outpost. Return: fly back to lodge from outpost, fly back yo ywg on their charter, fly to calgary for 1 night and then fly back to Windsor and drive back into US."
6584080,Eckohlt,2021-07-28 13:06:00,3685,Somebody should write a book on what we have to go through to catch a fish.

6583386,djk50164,2021-07-26 16:35:00,370,After talking with our Canadian neighbor sound like if we get a positive test at the border we will be heading home. Sounds like we would not be able to fish and they would be doing checkups on us.
6583398,Larry S,2021-07-26 17:16:00,665,"My Outfitter, Mattice just sent me this email. It said ""A Quarantine plan is required by all those entering Canada including Canadian citizens. Your Quarantine location would be your vacation location. If a person selected for a test and tests positive, they can choose to stay at their quarantine location in Canada OR leave to go home I DONOT Anticipate, if tested coming up positive, if my sister and I do we will quarantine at our fly-in location and then return home Larry S"
6583516,Skywagon,2021-07-27 04:31:00,1106,"I went through the quarantine process in December. You must check in with them every day and they do check in on you (they checked in on me twice). You are not allowed to leave the premises, which means you cannot go out in a boat."
6583948,fishnfood,2021-07-28 08:22:00,94,"We camp on crown land and two of us have made several calls trying to find out about the quarantine plan and verify it will be OK to camp. The MNR verified we will be allowed to camp and sent us to the ministry of health for questions on the arrivecan and quarantine plan. One of use talked to a covid person and one to an arrivecan person. The both said the same thing. As of 7/27 this is what we were told. 1. By the time Aug 9 gets here they will probably be testing everyone at the border.2. They will not hold you but you have to be able to check your results online. In our case we must be able to check our test results before we get out of touch but if negative we won't have to check in again as some have reported. 3. At the end of Aug they will reevaluate the variant situation but there are no plans at this time to modify entry for Americans before then. 4. They will not tolerate fake paperwork and your name will go on a ""do not cross"" list for the next ten years. As we all know it depends on who is doing the border checks but hopefully this will help someone planning a trip.I would like to say that everyone we talked to (it was many) were very patient and helpful."
6583966,turkeyriver,2021-07-28 08:39:00,80,"So if you must be able to check your results, how will that work on a remote fly-in with no cell service. If we fly back out in 5 days and see there was a positive test result, will be able to just drive back home?"
6583972,Da' Walleye Assassun,2021-07-28 08:45:00,358,The pilots are instructed to leave you there for 14 days.

6583980,Da' Walleye Assassun,2021-07-28 08:57:00,358,On the way to the border discuss who would be the first to be eaten when the food runs out.
6583984,fishnfood,2021-07-28 09:00:00,94,It't not a mess. You abide by the rules or stay home. In our case it's a non-issue since we have seen other people three time in over 50 trips. We are modifying our plans to fit the situation because we love to go and appreciate the ability to use their resources. If they say you have to be able to check then I assume where you are going will have that ability. Satellite internet is a thing.......
6583986,fishnfood,2021-07-28 09:03:00,94,You will be allowed back into the states with a positive test. The guy I talked to said not to overthink it. I see this as sound advice. We have never used an outfitter but I would think they will have this covered.
6581260,MikeF,2021-07-21 09:57:00,895,"Thanks adempsey2.0 Agreed. Always follow the money trail on their decisions, at least in the USA. Like I said before, Easy Peasy..LOL"
6581264,1/4 oz Jig,2021-07-21 10:09:00,90,Not at all. Just something I was thinking about. It makes sense that at the border for the random they use the rapid. You test positive you just turn around and go home. Whatever the requirements I’ll follow and do what’s asked. Just excited to go!!
6581352,Obabikon,2021-07-21 12:32:00,2370,"The problem with the rapid test, it only has accuracy of 70%. False positives are not unusual. That's not acceptable."
6581552,hoppy63,2021-07-21 18:44:00,367,70% in almost anything in life and you're a millionaire!!!! Pretty acceptable in my books
6581636,Eckohlt,2021-07-22 04:48:00,3685,"??? For anyone,do the people who travel across the border everyday for work have to take a COVID test everyday or is it a one time deal,and the arrivecan app is that a one time deal also???"
6581728,Obabikon,2021-07-22 09:23:00,2370,"""essential"" workers are not subject to providing negative covid tests when they cross. So, they do not have to."
6581764,Eckohlt,2021-07-22 10:36:00,3685,Thanks
6583290,Habitual Eyer,2021-07-26 11:38:00,144,70% accuracy rate means 30 out of every 100 are potentially turned away. Definitely not acceptable. I don't see under any circumstances they would allow anyone across that has just tested positive.
6583352,Twodogs,2021-07-26 14:55:00,115,My two cents..I'm leaving September 10..setting up two test at different places (of course) just in case on does read false positive... crossing the border that evening.Hopefully everything goes smoothly.
6583356,bbheli,2021-07-26 15:26:00,1387,What one person on the phone says and what the officer in the box does are two different things. They have a lot of discretion. None of us will know till some others go and confirm the experience. we are back to the days of the early explorers to a degree. Now if I have to call my wife and tell her I'm quarantined to the fishing lodge oh well.......
6581164,hoppy63,2021-07-21 07:52:00,367,"For what it's worth.....it sounds too good to be true but I just spoke with that Canada Border Services Agency and the man I spoke with said the quarantine plan is the address of where you will be staying on your fishing trip. I specifically asked if you get the random at the border and test positive that they are going to let you drive to where you are going, fly in and quarantine and he said yes, so again I said so all I need is the name and address of the outfitter and where we are going and he confirmed this."
6581180,MikeAnkeny,2021-07-21 08:06:00,67,I hope you are right otherwise it would be unworkable. Thanks for checking.
6581184,Riding high,2021-07-21 08:09:00,69,That's sounds kinda weird! I would figure they would turn you around and tell you to leave.
6581192,1/4 oz Jig,2021-07-21 08:30:00,90,Is it the pcr test that you randomly could get at the border? If so they won’t even have results till the next day or longer it will have to get sent to a lab. If doing a fly in how are they going to even get a hold of you??? Are they going to come fly out there and tell you? Tell your outfitter to go get you? My guess is these random border tests are going to be few and far between.
6581212,adempsey2.0,2021-07-21 08:47:00,611,It's a rapid test. Not PCR.edit: I am wrong. It is indeed a molecular test and NOT a rapid test.
6581220,MikeF,2021-07-21 08:58:00,895,"Maybe attach a satellite gps tracker to you or your vehicle and send the IRTF or CBRN if deemed necessary. They probably could use the practice hours just like the flyboys need. Quote: It's a rapid test. Not PCR. Is the rapid test valid for your border crossing application? If not, why is it okay to use at the border? My understanding is no, but I have been wrong many times before"
6581228,adempsey2.0,2021-07-21 09:08:00,611,"No, you need a molecular test for your pre-entry Covid test. I think I was wrong about the rapid test. It looks like the random testing is still the same ""Day 1"" molecular test and it is not a rapid test.This is the test: https://switchhealth.ca/en/individua...ts/covid-test/"
6581238,MikeF,2021-07-21 09:24:00,895,"Watched the video and looks easy peasy. LOL The point that 1/4oz Jig brought up about being long gone from the border station after being chosen for a random test, would seem valid."
6581252,adempsey2.0,2021-07-21 09:41:00,611,"Yes, it will be interesting. Just scheduling the consultation online could be a nightmare. As far as I understand, the sample collection must be monitored so you need internet access. This is why I figured they would be using a rapid test. The Government bought millions of rapid tests and they are sitting in storage. Maybe they will have another testing plan in place given the likely increase in volume or just really limit how many random tests they do in a day. For example, your quarantine plan is for 14-days. Well, what if your trip is only 7 days? Are you now a prisoner? You test positive but can go on a plane with strangers within Canada? You test positive and are expected to just sit in your cabin all week? Who would do that? None of this makes much sense to me. I just don't see the random testing program being implemented well and should just be scrapped. The private company doing it has connections to the current Government, so makes me wonder if that has played a role in this. The information is just all over the place and it is hard to get a grasp on what exactly is required."
6581258,hoppy63,2021-07-21 09:54:00,367,"If you are questioning me you are barking up the wrong tree. I have no answers, just passing along what I was told. It sounds odd to me to....hence the ""sounds too good to be true"""
