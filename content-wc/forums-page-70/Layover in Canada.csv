Does anyone know if this is the case? We have a long ride and like to spend one night in a hotel along the way. Thanks

6583584,Hookhunter75,2021-07-27 08:01:00,60,I am curious on this one as well. I am entering in Manitoba and driving to YT. About 6 months ago as a precaution I AirBnb private cabins for myself for the way up. I will be isolated along the way and am providing my own food. I will only need to stop at gas stations for fuel and pay with a card. Will that be sufficient?
