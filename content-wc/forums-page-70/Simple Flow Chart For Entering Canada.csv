6584858,MikeF,2021-07-30 15:33:00,895,Kudos to Canada If only the US was so diligent in enforcing border crossings rules.
6584336,Carnhzkr,2021-07-29 11:21:00,964,"I assume that when we fill out our information on the ArriveCan app or website, that our info will get loaded into a central DB. When we get to the border, we'll hand over our passports, as usual, and the agent will have access to the vaccination and test info that we've entered via ArriveCan, so there will be no handing phones back and forth with the border agent. That sound like a valid assumption?"

6584684,fishnfood,2021-07-30 08:27:00,94,"I think the best advice is what I received from the arrivecan health person I talked to. His advice was to follow the instructions and don't overthink it. The unknown is the agent you are dealing with. We had to unpack an enclosed trailer one time at 2am. We even had to take the boats off the top rack even though they were upside down and you could easily see into them. I think she was either bored or angry we woke her. :-)I'm waiting for the first news story where some fisherman gets caught trying to fake a vaccine card. I can hear his attorney on faux news saying they have violated his rights by making him be vaccinated to cross the border. His client was just ""showing he was free"" and they have no right to hold him....... It's going to happen."

6581004,Baseline,2021-07-20 17:44:00,3207,"What vaccines are acceptable in Canada?Those who have received the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccines will be allowed to enter Canada.Documentation: Vaccine card AND app or online registrationTo be eligible to enter Canada for discretionary travel on the basis of vaccination status, travelers must use the ArriveCAN app or submit information online on the ArriveCAN web portal. Travelers must ensure that mandatory requirements are met prior to leaving home. Travelers must also have a paper or digital copy of their vaccination documentation. The app is free. Or apply online at travel-healthdeclaration.com/canada.You also need a new, negative COVID-19 test resultAll travelers, regardless of vaccination status, will still require a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular negative test result obtained within 72 hours of crossing the border. There is no longer mandatory testing once in Canada, but some travelers may be randomly tested upon entry.Where to get a molecular COVID-19 testNote: The test must be a molecular or PCR test, NOT an antigen test.In the Northland, Essentia Health offers molecular, or PCR testing, at 42 of its sites. The traditional test offers results back to the patient usually within 24 to 72 hours, depending on the location of the test (all results are done in labs in Duluth and Fargo). In cases where faster results are needed, most Essentia clinics also offer an instant or rapid test option. In both cases insurance companies are billed but, if not covered, there is no charge to the patient. You can sign up for a COVID-19 test through Essentia’s My Chart system or by calling your local provider.St. Luke’s offers saliva kits that are sent to Vault. If the tests are collected and sent Monday-Thursday, patients will get results back within 48 hours. Patients purchase those kits from St. Luke’s and do not need an order from a doctor. Patients get the result emailed to them directly from Vault. With a doctor's order, St. Luke's also will do a routine PCR tests which will offer results within 48 hours. Testing is offered Monday-Saturday.Walgreens is offering free, contactless COVID-19 testing for patients age 3 and up at select locations. Walgreens also offers a rapid diagnostic test with faster results. Go to walgreens.com/findcare/covid19/testing to pick a site and type of test you want.For other COVID-19 testing options in Minnesota go to mn.gov/covid19/get-tested/testing-locations/.No mandatory quarantine in CanadaFully vaccinated travelers who meet the requirements will be exempt from the 14-day quarantine. However, all travelers must still provide a quarantine plan and be prepared to quarantine in case it is determined at the border that they do not meet the necessary requirements.Can children cross the US-Canada border if they are not vaccinated?Everyone age 13 and older is required to be fully vaccinated to enter Canada. However, unvaccinated children 12 and under are allowed to cross the border if they are accompanied by a parent or guardian who is vaccinated.Don’t forget your passportRequirements for all people entering Canada (and to re-enter the U.S.) to have a valid passport or an enhanced driver's license are still in place.Don’t fake your vaccination cardAccording to the Public Health Agency of Canada, a person who submits false information on vaccination status could be liable to a fine of up to $750,000 or six months imprisonment or both, under the Quarantine Act, or prosecution under the Criminal Code for forgery. Violating any quarantine or isolation instructions provided to travelers by a screening officer or quarantine officer when entering Canada is also an offence under the Quarantine Act and could lead to a $5,000 fine for each day of non-compliance or for each offense committed, or more serious penalties, including six months in prison and/or $750,000 in fines. Non-compliant air travelers may also be subject to fines of up to $5,000 for each offence committed under the Aeronautics Act."
6581272,lawson2343,2021-07-21 10:18:00,459,Nicely done Baseline! Thank you.
6584168,Planocat,2021-07-28 18:57:00,473,"Baseline:Thank you for the thorough explanation. The 72 hour requirement, when traveling from Texas, will mean planning an in route test and waiting for the results. Right now I guess that means planning for a test in Minneapolis or Duluth. We'll just have to make it work.I wonder if a quarantine plan of hunkering down in our motorhome in the campground will be acceptable. Other than that, we are looking forward to our 37th year in Canada and getting the dust off the boat. I just hope they don't reconsider the border opening with the variance spike fueled by the non-vaccinated. Again, Thank YouPlanocat"

If our neighbors to the north reevaluate their border policy, I'm sure it will have nothing to do with the current trends. Fact: Hospital Covid admissions in the DFW area have quadrupled in the last 2 weeks and 95% of the admissions are from non-vaccinated patients. Have a great day. Planocat"

Here is a link below to read.Canada will let fully vaccinated American travellers into country on Aug. 9, others on Sept. 7 | CTV NewsAs of right now we now here are the following things to know when you are going to cross the border;• be fully vaccinated with a Health Canada approved vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD, and/or Johnson & Johnson (one-dose));• provide COVID-19- related information electronically through ArriveCan (App or web portal) including proof of vaccination prior to departing for Canada;• meet the pre-entry testing requirements;• be asymptomatic upon arrival; and• have a paper or digital copy of their vaccination documentation in English or French (or certified translation, along with the original) ready to show a government official on request; and• participate in random self-testingAll travelers must also present a suitable quarantine plan, and be prepared to quarantine, should they not meet all of the conditions to be exempt from quarantine.( we are waiting on more information on this and what you need to have planned if asked (EI....."" i am turning around"" ""or stay at SFO or a hotel?"")Not sure anyone can answer all the questions we have today for Completely planning a trip fly or drive!That is the problem!I called a travel agent referred to me by Bolton lodges in Winnipeg and they are not even solid on what is totally needed.Last hurdle is what do we need to go back into the us beside passport and proof of vaccination, the us customs site is still saying we need a negative test? So if your in the bush when and where do you get the test to come back? makes flying into and back from Canada a logistical nightmare! Best we can do is have an outline of a plan A, B ..Z?Suggest a Thread for Government current info only with no comments?"
6580808,Hookhunter75,2021-07-20 12:18:00,60,I think my big question is if I am driving from PA to BC I am curious as to what is an acceptable quarantine plan. I will be isolated at my outpost camp on arrival. But in transit I have rented AirBnb cabins that I will be isolated in alone. Would they accept that or are you required to get to your destination the same day you cross the border.
6580810,Hookhunter75,2021-07-20 12:20:00,60,I can’t imagine you are going to be questioned about a quarantine plan if you meet the requirements. Asymptomatic negative pre arrival and fully vaccinated.

6580840,guidedfishing,2021-07-20 14:00:00,531,"If you have proper vaccination and clean PCR / Molecular test within in 72hrs of entry, with no symptom's then the only wild cards right now are. 1. You draw the lucky number for a random test. 2. By some quirk of fate that test comes back positive. (pretty remote granted) but then what. Do they turn you around or do you get to blow several thousand on a state hotel stay. I find it hard to believe they are going to let you drive across Canada to quarantine in the bush.. (yes remote and probably not worth discussing) It will happen to some unlucky soul. Oh course it makes sense they just turn you around but sometimes it doesn't have to make sense. Obviously if your Molecular test came back positive you are not going to show up at the border with that as your hold card. So it really comes down to the low probability of you getting a random test and it turns up hot... then the only other question is, what is the US response to all this which still remains to be clarified. All good not crossing for a couple weeks after this starts so hopefully it remains open and the bugs get worked out. And I am sure there will be a fair number arriving without the ArriveCan app not already completed. Should be interesting to see how it plays out. At least its moving in the right direction.. Its all fun and games until someone gets a treble hook in the back of the head, or a positive Covid test... ; )"
6580864,hairyminnow,2021-07-20 14:14:00,40,"FYI, After a few phone calls, I discovered that the Essentia clinic in Baxter has the PCR tests are they are free. The lady stated that these are part of the stimulus package and are supposed to be free not $159.00 as shown on the website you posted. The results are back in in less than 72 hrs as well."
6580878,BreezyPoint,2021-07-20 14:36:00,1581,"Yes and they told me they wouldn't guarantee getting them back in time and that the tests were sent to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. While you would probably get it back, there are many things that could go wrong in that chain. They also told me they cannot order the test without a doctor's visit due to liability concerns. I actually had an appointment scheduled and they called me back to tell me I had to make the doctor's appointment first.Not all PCR tests are free. A travel test is not a diagnostic test. That is what my insurance company relayed to me.The site I posted provides the documentation to submit a claim. Your insurance company will determine if it is free. Frank"

I am confused as to the role of entering ""travel plan"" in the procedure, and am curious as to getting a negative virus statement -in the past it has normally taken about a week to receive the report - will this be somehow expedited? By whom? Where? Perhaps it is too early in the process, as hopefully these items will get clarified and resolved as can only be accomplished by additional reality checks. If someone has a sharp finger on the process, I think there are thousands of folks who would appreciate this visibility.

6580694,cuamb,2021-07-20 06:43:00,203,"Hi Bill, I had a Covid test last week before a Dr's appointment. I had the test around 1:30 pm and had the results that evening. I am most concerned about have a quarantine plan. Sounds like you need to have one in case you fail the test after crossing the border. Sure glad we are going in September so they have some tine to figure this out."
6580698,Obabikon,2021-07-20 06:44:00,2370,"From what I understand... you will need to either download the app or go online and fill out information about your travel plans. Who you are Where you are going What day you will be crossing into canada What your plans are during your stay What day you will be returning I believe you will also be required to state if you are vaccinated or not. This is not an APP that tracks your every move. The idea is more to expediate the border process, and have documentation IF there is an ""outbreak"" in a general area. I'm sorry that I don't have more information on it yet, it is being discussed A LOT in some of the tourism groups I am in. NOTO has a list of questions that they are going to be asking... once things start getting ironed out, I will share any info I have."
6580700,Obabikon,2021-07-20 06:46:00,2370,"As a resort, I plan on designating an isolated building as our ""quarantine"" plan. I would guess that most resorts end up doing this."
6580718,cuamb,2021-07-20 07:09:00,203,Great Idea! I will have to check with ours to see if they have an option for us.
6580728,Larry S,2021-07-20 07:20:00,665,"Bill. The ArriveCAN app on computer & phone takes all your information( Vaccination CDC Card showing when & what type of vaccination you were given) then you put in 72 hrs before you leave all the other information asked by Canada as a Quick way to enter Canada. You Must get a Covid test before you enter Canada .The results of this test must not be longer than 72 hrs before you enter Canada Also the type of test must NOT be an Antigen test. You must get a PCR,NAAT or many other tests Approved by Canada You can get a list of these tests, or if you want I will message you a copy of the approved tests. You can also bring All the Documentation with you to present to the border as you drive into Canada. It might take a bit longer by the border guards to verify, but is an approved way to enter."
6580732,@Lunker,2021-07-20 07:33:00,835,"From what I'm reading, one of the requirements if quarantined (for example, in your isolated building), is to be prepared to check in with the government on a daily basis to assure compliance. And how do we see that happening if staying at a remote location?"
6580740,Obabikon,2021-07-20 08:02:00,2370,"Check in by phone. That's what I had to do for two weeks in June. Depending on just how remote the location, I am not sure alternative options to ""check in""."
6580786,turkeyriver,2021-07-20 11:06:00,80,Our trip was for July 23 -28. To be honest I was relieved that we didn't have to be in the first wave going across. Now we're Sept. 8-13 and I sure hope all the kinks are out of the system by then. Thanks in advance to the first guys going and returning for sharing their experiences and things they had trouble with crossing the border. I sure hope there aren't some buttholes out there who refuse to vaccinate and are right now figuring out how to game the system and get across. I respect their right to not get the shot. I hope they can respect the rest of who took that slight chance of an adverse reaction and now get to go fishing. If they get caught and ruin it for the rest of us I hope they leave them naked at the border with fines to pay before they can leave. Too harsh??
