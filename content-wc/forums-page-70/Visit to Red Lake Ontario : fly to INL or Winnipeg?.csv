INL to Red Lake is shorter drive, by about 45 minutes. But you don't know how much hassle you face of crossing the bridge and waiting in line in the car. Our experience with customs and immigration in Winnipeg was smooth. Our impression of Winnipeg was not a great one. I was travelling with my daughter and I wasn't a fan of the parts of the town that we saw. We stopped in Kenora for groceries. The drive from Winnipeg to Kenora was not as pretty as the drive up from INL (IMHO). In reference to another recent post, thinking that flying into Winnipeg with salted minnows will be allowed, not sure about driving them across the border. What are your thoughts on these options?"
6584042,Mojo-NC,2021-07-28 11:46:00,1929,"If they are as consistent as TSA, it would depend on the agent you end up with. I agree with all of your assessments about flying to Winnipeg vs. INL. Customs was easy peasy. They even helped us through the process at the airport. It can be a bit confusing for an airport customs newbie. There is no easy way out of Winnipeg and the drive to Ontario is boring. The only good part about flying to Winnipeg is easy trip through customs and they have a Costco for supplies. The downside is that Costco sells many of the necessary items in such large quantities we couldn't possibly go through that much in a week. That said, I still prefer flying to INL and driving through customs.This trip we chose to fly to MSP instead of INL because of a $200+ difference (per person) in the price of airfare. Yes, it adds about an additional 4 hours to our drive, but split up between 4 guys it is still doable. We can also get a direct flight to MSP. I expect the availability of car rentals might be a bit better in Minneapolis as well. Keep in mind, with the lockdowns we've had for the last year-and-a-half, rental availability is at a premium and INL is a pretty small airport."
6584062,LoDo,2021-07-28 12:27:00,721,"Where are you flying from to get to Winnipeg or Int Falls? I live in Denver and 100% will take flying to Winnipeg over Int falls simply due to Denver to Winnipeg is direct. I have to fly through MSP to get to Int Falls. Winnipeg airport is on the west side of town and we take the by pass to the north around the city. IMO, its much faster. Now, our flight arrives in Winnipeg around rush hour traffic too. Driving through the city takes too long. You're correct Winnipeg to Kenora doesn't have much for scenery, however we're moving pretty fast as the road is four lanes. Rolling into Kenora and seeing the north side of LOTW, marina, etc... is beautiful. Have you looked into an outfitter out of Winnipeg to fly you to your camp? Our camp is on the far west end of Red Lake and we use Amik Air. Amik is first class IMO. They pick us up at the Winnipeg airport, 20 min drive to their hanger, 30mins to load up the plane, take off, 60min flight to the dock. Door to door from Denver to the dock is ~6hrs. We uber to Denver airport, no parking, no hotels to / from the cabin when using Amik. Tough to beat."
6584064,KSjim,2021-07-28 12:28:00,88,Our group has settled on flying into Winnipeg. Airline schedule is better and customs has never been a problem. Coming home one year we had to wait in line for almost 3 hours in Fort Frances. We have tried a few routes out of Winnipeg but now always take 90 Hwy north out of the airport up to the loop Hwy 101 and then around to Hwy 1 to Kenora. Looks like a long way around on the map but you are travelling highway speeds the whole distance.
6584098,That Minnesota guy,2021-07-28 13:20:00,8293,I don't know that it matters but I believe they are adding another runway right now. Lots of dirt being hauled out there.
6584106,NM_Trout,2021-07-28 13:36:00,1094,"That's what I fear. One trip up, we got fogged in with rain and low clouds and ended up getting caught in camp. My daughter and I had been there for a whole week in cold / freezing weather and were ready to get home. We were packed up and ready to go at 0500 Sunday morning, and our float plane could not retrieve us until almost 4pm. We had a flight out the next day early. We didn't get back to INL until almost 12:30pm. If we needed to spend another night in camp, we would not have made our flight home. I get somewhat spooked with trying to get home."
6584108,NM_Trout,2021-07-28 13:42:00,1094,"I fly out of Albuquerque. My daughter is in KC MO. I've thought about flying to KC, spending the night and then flying with her, as the flights from KC are pretty short in duration. I've never used an outfitter to get into camp from Winnipeg. I might have to see if that is doable. Our outfitter lives in Red Lake. Since it would only be the two of us, it might not be affordable. Of course, we are also renting a car that just sits in Red Lake for a week too. I'll have to check it out. Does Amik fly folks directly into a camp if the camp is not run by Amik? I might check to see if my outfitter would give me a flight credit if I fly with another service. Hmmmm."
6584130,jsmyers,2021-07-28 14:55:00,198,I go to Wine Lake and Wabaskang (depending on the year) and I live in NC. My folks are in SC. I generally fly to MSP. I have a cousin there who is usually on the trips too.Never considered flying to Winnipeg. I might try that in the future.
6584154,Maverick31,2021-07-28 17:40:00,9,"We have done it both ways. Winnipeg has a Costco close to the airport if you don't want to pack/carry groceries on the airplane. It's very close to the airport. Also there is a Cabela's not to far south of the airport. Lots of motels and restaurants if you need to spend the night either coming or going. We had to connect through MSP also, with no direct flights to Winnipeg. Not as many options to stock up, but I still like the drive up from International Falls. You can't go wrong either way."
6584194,LoDo,2021-07-28 20:37:00,721,"Agree with all that is said above!! Call Terence at Amik. He, his father and brother own the Amik operation. Again, first class!! Check our their website. They have 4-5 planes. Amphibian float planes. If you have to stay the night in Winnipeg, be sure and stay close to the airport and have Amik pick you up in the AM, take you to their hanger. If driving, north to 101 is the move. To repeat, the map looks long, but its far better than driving through town. Easy customs and rentals in Winnipeg. Best of luck!!"
