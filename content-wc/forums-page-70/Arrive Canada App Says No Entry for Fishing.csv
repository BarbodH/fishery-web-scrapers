6584992,pjshorthorn,2021-07-31 05:56:00,5654,"Not likely. BTW, your arse gets chapped pretty easy doesn't it Spanky ? I find it amazing how you were able to look into your electronic device and determine that I'm old. That must be your super power. Drink up there Spanky, drink up. PjShorthorn"
6584276,v-bay gord,2021-07-29 07:31:00,3168,"Yes, and don't forget about the fires pushing the Sasquatch south...."
6584286,rockape,2021-07-29 07:55:00,215,Will he make it all the way down to central Indiana? I can't wait to meet him!!!
6584312,pjshorthorn,2021-07-29 09:45:00,5654,I carry the flag proudly. PjShorthorn
6584342,Guest,2021-07-29 11:32:00,0,zzzzzzzzzz that pink bird has gotten old time to put it to bed and leave it there no longer amusing
6584356,v-bay gord,2021-07-29 11:45:00,3168,"On a more serious note, and this may be because the last year and a half has made me somewhat crabby, the last thing I think most residents in NW Ontario want to see right now is out of country license plates heading into the bush to go camping."
6584378,northernbite,2021-07-29 12:49:00,1186,Thanks for the come back.. At this time of year I'm looking at the Gogama area above Sudury.Been going there for July 30 years..I respect you about the forest fires.. I go to Pickle Lake area in spring. Also not a camp fire guy.Always take small stove Thanks again Paul

6584504,ackvil,2021-07-29 17:17:00,177,I wonder if this will be required next year.
6584514,MikeF,2021-07-29 17:51:00,895,The precedent has been set.
6584516,Eckohlt,2021-07-29 17:51:00,3685,Hope I'm alive to find out!
6583464,Baseline,2021-07-26 20:32:00,3207,I just downloaded the Arrive Canada App. There is a test that specifically states that traveling to Canada for fishing is excluded even if you have a Vax and Negative test.Check it out:https://www.canada.ca/en/public-heal...arrivecan.html
6583470,That Minnesota guy,2021-07-26 20:39:00,8293,Didn't somebody say you had to use the app within 3 days of entry? If so maybe the app will be amended on August 6th?
6583474,Baseline,2021-07-26 20:42:00,3207,"Maybe, but I just downloaded the app where the link was included in a news story today. We shall see."
6583476,clawman,2021-07-26 20:48:00,2078,Thats the LAST thing Canada needs... a bunch of walleye swimming around with Covid!
6583492,elway12,2021-07-26 22:03:00,335,At the bottom of the web page that it states no entry for fishing it is dated 5/17/21. I am sure they will change the app settings and wording on or before the entry date.
6583520,pjshorthorn,2021-07-27 04:47:00,5654,You have to wait to submit your information so that it falls within the 72 hours of your arrival. At least that is my understanding. PjShorthorn
6583530,phishfearme,2021-07-27 05:58:00,1242,"if you click on the ""Find out if you can enter Canada link"" it clears all this up. discretionary travel ok for US citizens after August 9. phish"
6583532,Obabikon,2021-07-27 06:14:00,2370,Don't expect to be able to do this for a couple weeks still. 3 days before the trip
6584266,northernbite,2021-07-29 06:51:00,1186,Are we going to be able to tent camp in the bush? Paul
6584274,Skywagon,2021-07-29 07:29:00,1106,"Depending on what area you go to no fires in the bush. N/W Ontario is burning up, not a good time to be camping up this way."
