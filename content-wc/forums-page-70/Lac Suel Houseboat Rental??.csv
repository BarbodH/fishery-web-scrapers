3063921,cuamb,2014-08-05 21:41:00,203,I have used SLFL over 20 times. We hire a pilot on long runs and I pilot on short ones (Taylor Island area). I have had good luck with SLFL and I wouldn't hesitate to rent from them. I would like to try a cabin in that area but renting a cabin for the same amount of time is a lot more expensive. Send me a PM if you have any questions about them or areas to fish.
3066905,jimirjr,2014-08-07 05:26:00,1149,"Not sure If I'm sold on the idea of needing to bring all the extra's (I.E. sheets, pillows, dish towels, soap, landing nets, minnow buckets, etc.) As we need to fly from Denver to Minn. and then drive up to Hudson... THIS becomes a packing nitemare. Any ideas how much gas the HB will use getting to Chamberlain.. or Taylor Island? Still not exactly sure where Taylor is located.... Wouldn't there be a LOT of HB's moored nearby Taylor, if thats where all the outfitters park their clients?"
3069209,Red legs,2014-08-07 16:58:00,27,"Been with them for over 25 years. Can't say to many negatives about them. Steven and his wife are attentive to your needs and criticism. Houseboating is a relaxing economical way to get onto prime water and cut down on travel time. We go to the Chamberlin narrows area. This is a six hour houseboat trip in reef infested water. I've got 25 years experience and still find new dangerous rocks every year. You have to pay attention to your electronics and go slow when exploring new water. This lake EATS the careless and impatient boaters. Would highly recommend a pilot up and back. You can fish up and down the lake by hopping ahead of the houseboat while traveling up and down the lake. Navionics Premium chip has good general navigation routes marked. Most reefs in travel lanes are noted. You could fish a lifetime on this lake and not cover the same water twice. Taylor island is halfway up the east side. Chamberlin narrows a third farther and Wapesi is the upper end. Figure gas costs for HB as such. Five of us just did our most expensive trip ever at just over $1050 per each- food,HB gas, pilot and bait included. Usually with a group of 8 we get this down to $700 per each. The key is a stable compatible base group to offset any quirky negatives brought by newbies. The fishing is second to none. The group bonding PRICELESS!!!!!"
3078961,cuamb,2014-08-11 11:38:00,203,Our gas bill usually runs a little over $900 when we go to Chamberlain. That includes the generator gas and additional gas for our boats.
3081889,tsquared,2014-08-12 10:26:00,57,Sent you a PM. We did it 2 years in a row recently. Thanks.
3081945,Red legs,2014-08-12 10:56:00,27,You can save considerably by doing two things. First secure your HB gas supply. A pad lock on the pumper keeps the occasional passerby from helping themselves. This happened to us once. Second take some of your own gas in cans. I usually get 30 gallons for a week on the water. My 1875 Lund impact with 115 merc usually uses about 50 gallons. Any cans left over can be put into your vehicle for trip home. This helps offset the 30-50% markup the outfitter will charge per liter. Most recent trip gas was in $1.85 liter range on water and $1.25 range at filling station. Empty cans can easily be carried in boat for transport. We fill generator from HB pump to ensure cost equalization for the group. This has to be a group decision to work. If group does not abide by this make sure individual pumping episodes are tracked by pumping into a can then to boat tank so as to track usage.
3082249,jimirjr,2014-08-12 12:02:00,1149,"Well, since We are Flying into Minneapolis and renting a Van and driving from there, GAS cans won't cut it..One poster mentioned $900 for gas? I assume that is for the HB (to Chamberlain) AND fishing boats?Anyone have an approximation of gas usage to Taylor Island? AND how far is it (milage wise) from Taylor to Chamberlain area? Thanks ahead... JIMI"
3082465,Bakefish,2014-08-12 13:25:00,1077,Does the pilot spend his nights on the boat or does he leave when you reach your destination?
3082865,Red legs,2014-08-12 15:47:00,27,"The supply of gas on the HB is ample to meet demands for a week on the water. Bringing your own is strictly a cost savings measure. Taylor island is roughly 20 miles up the east side from Hudson. It is another 25 miles up to Chamberlin narrows. Pilots usually bring a boat in tow and as long as the weather and light conditions allow they head back to Hudson as soon as you are tied off and boats situated. Some may choose to stay overnite rather than make the trip back in the dark. Although I've had a couple thàt knew the lake so well they ran houseboat through some of the rougher points of navigation ( ie ""the rags"") at mid nite on a no moon pitch black nite. From taylor island to Hudson is only a 35-40 minute boat ride in an outboard. You have to keep in mind the HB top speed is about 6 mph. This lake is not one for the average bôater to attempt in the dark. I once had to make a trip at midnite from Brechin bay to Chamberlin narrows camp to make at sat phone call on behalf of our pilot whose outboard broke down at dewy narrows on way back to Hudson. It was a cłear calm moonless night and I had gps, knew all the reef locations and thought I could make it up and back easily. Wrong!!! The lake and shoreline blend together once you get 100 yards off the dock!! And GPS just blinds you steering you in circles. I finally had one boat from our party shine a spot lite in our direction to get a bearing. A five mile one way trip took three hours."
3088785,GGustaf,2014-08-14 09:22:00,8,"I am sitting here looking at the last 2 years invoice from SLFL which our group has used for 24 years and the gas bill bill was $900-1100 inclusive with 3 boats (and the HB of course). We run all the way to Merritt Island which is an hour above Chamberlain narrows. We used to bring a lot of our own gas but, it became such a hassle."
3046217,jimirjr,2014-07-30 17:07:00,1149,"Has anyone used this Outfitter: ""Sioux Lookout Floating Lodges""? Pro's ..... Con's Any info is greatly appreciated..."
3046321,btyreprich,2014-07-30 17:46:00,1067,"As much as my buddy and I tried, we could never get enough people to consider renting a houseboat. Too expensive for two guys and two kids. With that said, we have been staying at Whitewing Resort on Lac Seul - near Ear Falls. They have two houseboats that are clean, well powered, and spacious enough for a larger group. Dave and Bobbie run a great camp and I'll bet their houseboat program or rental would be something you'd enjoy. Check them out on the web."
3046473,MorganMan,2014-07-30 19:17:00,341,"Have never pulled the trigger and gone out on a houseboat trip either, but we have talked about it many times. We have watched a group of guys who post on youtube their summer trips using LSFL boats. They are a hoot to watch and gets us considering a trip like that too. It would be nice to be beached closer to fishing spots, but we just can seem to get more pros than cons considering the digs we stay in now."
3046561,pjshorthorn,2014-07-30 19:49:00,5654,Jimirjr: 10 years self guided up to the Chamberlain Narrows area using SLFL. I think we talked last fall about options you were considering for this year. Send me a PM with any questions and I'll be happy to help out. PjShorthorn
3053361,rich1775,2014-08-01 21:05:00,4,took a trip using them 2 years ago. in a nutshell awesome! there werent really any negatives for us. just a couple of things to know and consider. one we underestimated the total cost of gas for the week. we wanted to stay near chamberlin narrows but only went as far as bear narrows. we were towing 3 boats. i cant remember the exact cost of the gas for the round trip but it was alot. we each brought 2 five gallon gas cans for our own boats which helped out. lac seul is vast. you will make some big runs. the houseboat was as nice as if not nicer than most of the cabins i've stayed in. the other thing is we used a driver both ways and he put us on not the most desirable shore. when we tied up the lake was like glass and no one thought better. however when any wind picked up it was a little rough. the owners were very pleasant to deal with and i felt they were appreciative of our business. fishing was very good for walleyes and smallmouths. muskies were not cooperating. you got to go to wapesi for muskies. all in all great trip just as someone said it can be pricier than some others but you are right in the middle of the fishing areas.
3053377,rich1775,2014-08-01 21:09:00,4,hey morganman the guys on you tube are they the falkowski's? if so i agree! we actually went on our trip after watching them. they seemed to have more fun than us however
3053913,MorganMan,2014-08-02 06:55:00,341,"Yep, it's the Falkowskis! Some of their video crack me up. Some funny stuff. They seem to do well just fishing off the back of the boat in the evenings??"
3054193,jimirjr,2014-08-02 08:12:00,1149,"Yes Sir, HB'ing can and WILL be an (learning) adventure... lol!We know better now, But the first trip We took (around 15 years ago) found Us facing West in a very tiny bay.... well, the wind came up directly into the back of the HB, banging the propane tanks ALL nite long and pushing Us on to shore so tight... We were stuck GOOD...Thankfully, We got Ourselves ""unstuck"" after a bit of brainstorming and leveraging... NOW, we always 'scout out"" potential landing areas with the small boats BEFORE we beach the HB....AND... We always make sure those docking ropes are tied securely and TIGHTLY to the trees...The Falkowski's go up very early in the year... I believe that is why They do so well off the back of the HB's... as a lot of fish are still cruising the shallow bay areas... PLUS... They know what They are doing.... !!"
3057697,GGustaf,2014-08-03 15:40:00,8,"My group has used this group (SLFL) for 24 years now and I really can't complain. You need a group of guys (or folks) to make it work $$ wise but, it lets you go where ever you want to go on this awesome fishery. Owners are easy to deal with and equipment is kept in good working order."
