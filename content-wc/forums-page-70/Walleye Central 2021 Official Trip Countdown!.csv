6585598,bus33,2021-08-02 06:54:00,289,We are leaving Iowa Sunday afternoon .gonna hit the border shortly after midnight on the 9th. If there is a wrinkle at the border we will see it! Gonna be a cleanup/repair/pest control for at least a day since the shack hasn't been lived in for almost 2 years .can't wait!
6569528,Da' Walleye Assassun,2021-06-13 17:08:00,358,The border guards are going on strike. Crossing then will be easy.
6569530,Slim03,2021-06-13 17:12:00,159,Looks like even the owners of the bridge at international falls are getting tired of it. I never would have guessed that it was not owned by the US and Canadahttps://www.ckdr.net/2021/06/12/brid...-fort-frances/
6569538,Eckohlt,2021-06-13 17:34:00,3685,"Maybe bill Kerr will buy it,I guess he has a lot of money"
6580402,1shooter,2021-07-19 15:31:00,1493,if no issues arise....40 days and counting
6580406,RichA$1970,2021-07-19 15:42:00,1159,52 days unless I try to make a 2nd earlier run
6585526,stjoeguy,2021-08-01 20:20:00,979,"12 days!! No Canada in a year and a half and suddenly I have 3 trips lined up. August 14-21 at Root Bay on Lake St. Joseph, then September 4-11 at the Eagle Island camp on St. Joe, followed by September 18-25 at the Winoga cabin on St. Joe. The week before us, September 11-18, just opened up at the Winoga cabin, but 3 weeks straight is more than I (and my understanding wife) could handle. I'll have to pass on that trip. So today's count is 12, 33 & 47!!"
6585538,Carnhzkr,2021-08-01 20:35:00,964,"What a strange coincidence, I am also going to be at St Joe from August 14-21. Actually, I invited myself along and SJG reluctantly obliged. I think he may already be regretting that decision but it's too late to back out now. I'm already packed. Trip #2 is 52 days away. PJShorthorn and I will be at VbayGord's place on Eagle on September 22nd! Two awesome trips for me!"
6585540,LoDo,2021-08-01 21:07:00,721,"Sept 30 to Oct 10 is booked, however I've got a bad feeling about this border."
6585550,Eckohlt,2021-08-02 03:54:00,3685,"LoDo have all the right paper work ready,you'll zip right through when you get to an agent,reverse that bad feeling to good."

6569312,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2021-06-12 22:29:00,240,"Can we get Fisherman Ted to chime in on this? Last week, he sounded so optimistic, and he sounds like he had a bit of inside info."

6569412,1/4 oz Jig,2021-06-13 10:31:00,90,Hopefully this week a plan on the border is released. Whether it opens in July or October at least everyone will know where they stand. Lodge owners and hopeful fisherman can plan accordingly.
6569494,NARDA 1,2021-06-13 16:08:00,636,"Thanks, I think it's still pretty iffy, but I hope it's a go."
6569498,NARDA 1,2021-06-13 16:11:00,636,"With their track record of only doing 30 days in advance, I'm not very optimistic. Hopefully they will change their ways."
6569508,Eckohlt,2021-06-13 16:30:00,3685,"If they don't change there ways I'll have a talk with them and tell them narda has a trip in 88 days,and he must go on it,so get a opening date for the border and stick by it"
6569184,Eckohlt,2021-06-12 11:36:00,3685,Keep the faith port

6569218,emma17,2021-06-12 13:43:00,436,"I haven't fished the second week of September before. I know the weather will do what it wants to do, but will the Walleye typically be out deeper that time of year?"

Once he secured a safe entry process for our citizens, I would assign him to perform a study of the size of native fish across Canada."
6515546,Eckohlt,2021-01-09 18:40:00,3685,"That study would require me to wet a line in every province to do the study,absolute brilliant idea,Rich you are already up for a big pay raise"
6515554,prov1800,2021-01-09 19:15:00,5010,Think you will need a canadian ambassador in that deal wouldn't you think.

6514998,dschiebel,2021-01-07 23:30:00,85,Were going to the Florida Keys 5/1/21 for walleye fishing in the Ocean. Were thinking a lindy rig and a crawler. Its also the crowning of Miss Tropicana at our hotel.
6515008,Eckohlt,2021-01-08 05:01:00,3685,"Looking forward to the pics in Florida,not of the walleyes but of miss Tropicana"

6514110,Bghunter,2021-01-05 11:20:00,17,"I have two planned. May 24th thru 30th and June 5th thru 12th. Bad news below,,,, maybe this fish camp is just not going to open but this email to me came today.Maybe they have enough Canadian business they cant save reservations for unknown US customers? I am not disclosing the fishing camp name as I just cut and pasted the email with nothing showing them. They are in NW Ontario and I do not have a reservation with them. I was told by both my fish camp owners April 1st would be a deciding date by the Department of Ministry. ATTENTION US GUESTS (ONLY US GUESTS) I was going to wait a day or two to write this email, but I can't. We just learned, if you're a US citizen with a 2021 reservation with ________  please be aware, the US/CAN border will remained closed for the foreseeable future. To be clear  US citizens will not be allowed entry into Canada for the 2021 season. As we did in 2020, we will credit all deposits to a future stay. The option to refund deposits does not exist; simply, it's not in our control and a very difficult decision. We will open up reservations to US citizens once we get confirmation the border will open and under what circumstances. Until then, it is pointless to keep taking reservations and cancelling them."
6514112,Scratcher,2021-01-05 11:26:00,170,I just got the same email.
6514120,eyecatcher1,2021-01-05 11:38:00,323,"I just got that email too. I inquired about the resort, but never made a reservation."

6514156,eyecatcher1,2021-01-05 12:59:00,323,This is the same letter that I got. I've never stayed there either nor do I have a reservation for this year.
