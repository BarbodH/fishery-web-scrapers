1383647,Babamel2,2012-01-19 13:15:00,414,How many of you bother to get lake maps prior to going. I know the first year I went I got a big map of the lake. I wonder if there is still someone out there who supplies them

1383661,jambi,2012-01-19 14:05:00,504,I requested a map of a new flyout lake from the outfitter before heading up. Made for a little familiarity before I showed up.
1383675,Babamel2,2012-01-19 14:23:00,414,"Even though I know the lake well, but would live to have a nice one to put up in my home office. Thanks for the info"
1383717,new hips,2012-01-19 16:33:00,498,I get mine from this link http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/topo Keep zooming in until you get the size you want. Take it to Office Max and get it laminated for a couple of bucks
1383807,FrankLeigh,2012-01-19 21:21:00,80,"You can also check out www.adventurefishingmaps.on.ca Jack supplies maps with contour lines that are already laminated for about $10 plus shipping. If it is a big lake that you are looking for, it may be 2 or 3 sections, so it would cost more."

Shows pretty much everything you will see on the big paper maps. Has all the north america lakes on it, less the really small lakes."
1384927,adempsey,2012-01-23 08:02:00,963,"Absolutely. I love going over maps. I usually mark all the spots that look appealing to me. As mentioned, the Navionics maps are available for the iPhone and Android phones and are great maps. Well worth the purchase as it's relatively inexpensive (I bought it for $10).So, before any trip, I try my best to get a bathymetric/depth map if I don't already have it, but also look at the Google satellite image as well. The satellite images often can show you shoals and other interesting features. My current sources are the Garmin Bluecharts maps for my GPS, the Trak Maps Marine map set for my GPS, the Navionics maps for my Android phone and my printed Backroad Mapbooks fishing books. If the map is not included with my GPS or other books, I check Angler's Atlas for a free one. It's a great resource. The Ministry of Natural Resources also set up an online resource called Fish ON-line that sometimes has depth maps and other information.If all that fails, then I check for a commercially available one from a variety of sources:Trak MapsAdventure Fishing MapsFishing Maps PlusCanada Map SalesFishing Hot SpotsOlofs MapsBlue Water WebWorst case, I use Google Maps and/or the NRCan Topo Maps to make my own. Unfortunately this happens more often than I would like."
