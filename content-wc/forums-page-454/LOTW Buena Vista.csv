1381645,Rgate,2012-01-11 15:51:00,14,Thanks for the endorsements guys - If you plan to come the end of June with a little luck and some know-how you should be able to catch up to 100 walleyes a day. I Like July fishing even better. Here is a more accurate link to the fishing entries of my blog - http://buenavista.livejournal.com/tag/fishing and some more input can be found on face book at - https://www.facebook.com/groups/40801574355/

1382040,Guest,2012-01-12 14:37:00,0,I just wanted to pipe up on this one. I have known the Gate Family for years. Good people and a Good resort. I have even stayed in their motel units when family cabin was full. I also frequent the restaurant almost every morning. Good Food and a Great view. The fishing today is better than ever. I go after walleye every day but catch many pike and bass and the occasional muskie. I also have a couple of spots for Jumbo Perch 10-13 inch range is what we keep. Can't forget about the fall crappie fishing. But the best part of this area is the lack of cabins and boats. If seclusion is what you are after you can find it here. Islands. Islands. Islands. I would suggest a gps with mapping capabilties and a Canadian paper map for back up. Give this area a try you just might like it. JT

1385013,Matches,2012-01-23 11:07:00,236,"Tillhammer, I just caught this thread. I've fished out of Morson for 30 years and I totally agree with J-Man that the LOTW has been increasing every year for many years. Only about 45 minutes past the border and you have that true Canadian Experience. Plenty of huge Walleyes and Muskie to catch. I've stayed at Buena Vista for the 10 years and have only good things to say. The Gates family runs a real nice operation. You can catch plenty of fish within 6-10 miles, but why not experience more of the lake? It always seems a little odd to me that people will drive 300-500 miles to go fish in Canada but don't want to travel much on the Lake. Another good reason to fish Morson. Only 45 minutes pass the border, so you don't have to travel as far in Canada to get to the resort. 14000 islands and 65000 miles of Shoreline. Hire Rick or Kevin to guide you for a day and see for yourself. It's beautiful!!"
1385088,Obabikon,2012-01-23 14:00:00,2370,"Fish morson... That's all I can say. Great fishing, very little traffic... you'll have a great time. Gates = great people Gaudry's = great people"
1380091,Guest,2012-01-07 09:56:00,0,"http://www.buenavistaresort.com/ Looking to book a fishing trip to LOTW and am overwhelmed with info on the web. Came across this place and the rates look reasonable, but am wondering if anybody here has fished around this area of the the lake? Is this lodge located near good fishing in mid to late June? Our group is able to travel 6 - 10 miles by boat to get to good fishing, but really don't want to go any further than that. Mainly target eyes, but may want to try for lakers and muskie as well. Also, on google maps it appears to be very close to big water. If the wind blows, is there safe access to more seculded areas of the lake."
1380133,mlure,2012-01-07 12:16:00,15,I have a trailer at Mylies Place (just around the corner from Buena Vista). We have very good walleye fishing close by and you don't have to go far for great muskie fishing. For Lakers you will have to portage into Whitefish. Never know from year to year what shape the portage will be in. Check out: myliesplaceresort.comDick Moore
1380241,Guest,2012-01-07 20:03:00,0,"Personally I would avoid Buena Vista. No personal expience with the lodge or owners but LOW varies greatly in terms of fishing quality depending upon where you are. That portion of the lake is getting gill netted hard and the fishing quality has suffered accordingly. It is also a tough part of the lake to be in if the wind blows and it always seems to when you are on holidays. Not a realistic option getting into Whitefish Bay for trout if your stay at Buena Vista. Just too far and a pain to go across turtle portage. Check out Ash Rapids Lodge. A little spendy but nothing else comes close in terms of location on Lake of the Woods if you want variety and great fishing quality. Close to Shoal Lake for huge bass and pike, easy access to musky and walleye and awesome lake trout fishing in Clearwater Bay. Lake trout in Clearwater are catch and release but a great chance to land a 20lb trout."
1380291,J-Man,2012-01-07 22:49:00,191,"The quality of the walleye fishery in the Morson area of LOTW has been increasing every year for many years. Size and numbers are getting better and better despite thinking it's not possible to get any better than it has each of the past 3-4 seasons. Photos and happy customers don't lie. Big muskie, pike and smallies are clearly evident if you take a few mins to browse most any resort with a good website. Wind can be an issue anywhere on LOTW with it's size. A resort's location with respect to prevailing winds and open water can make all the difference when you get hit hard by wind during your trip. The above posters claim that the quality of the fishery going down is complete and total BULL$H!T. Yes, whitefish is a bit of a long haul for trout, but certainly doable if you want to spend the day and don't mind putting in the effort to cross the clumsy portage at turtle lake."
1380967,birddogger,2012-01-09 20:57:00,43,"I've stayed at Buena Vista many times over the last 15 years. Wonderful hospitality and great fishing for walleyes and muskies. Crappies can be found in the fall but can be spotty. I don't fish for smallies but have been told the best area of the lake for smallies, the tourny fisherman even come down from Kenora to fish that area of the lake for the day of a tourny. Overall 5 stars."
1381035,johnboat,2012-01-10 07:06:00,2014,"Tillertamer, Any time someone gives you advise and is not willing to use their name, (such as ""wish I was there"") I would think hard about taking it. I have a pretty good run of years going to the Morson area and will agree totally with J-Man calling BS. Never been dissapointed with size or numbers and there are plenty of places to get out of the wind if it decides to blow. I have been to both camps and if it came down to B Vista or Mylies Place, its a no brainer. If you were to see and visit them both you'd book at Mylies Place today. We are at a private cabin when we are up there and use Mylies Place for everything we need. Great people and clean as a whistle. Keep'er On The Bottom! John B.O.A.T."
1381286,PJM,2012-01-10 16:48:00,3516,Tillertamer The resort is a family owned business with great hospitality. The resort has camp sites along with cabins and a hotel units and you can book in any time you want if available. They have a full guide service available with shore lunch and you can use their boats or your own. The restaurant there serves breakfast and dinnner and Im not sure about lunch. They alway have bait because they trap it and have a very nice boat launch. I Agree with J-Man about the poster above and I still think this site need to have people registar for just that reason. Here is a link to a journal from the owners son at the resort that has some great pictures www.buenavista.livejournal.com/ Also the resort guides for hunting in the fall.................
1381435,bob888,2012-01-11 06:31:00,244,"I've no experience with Buena Vista.Over the years I've about 20 weeks of stay at Mylie's Place. Have always been satisfied from the location, quality of the cabins, grounds, docks, personnel and the fishing."
1381469,Guest,2012-01-11 07:51:00,0,"I was introduced to BVR 20 years ago. We arrived late at night and I still remember the spectacular view that awaited us in the morning. I vowed to bring my family back which has happened for the last 15+ years. All the favorable comments about BVR are true. The Gate family, and supporting staff, make the stays very enjoyable and memorable. The cabins/motel rooms are comfortable and reasonable. The restaurant is 5 star and serve Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner. The docking facilities are very adequate and constantly improve. We view BVR as our lake home without the hassle. Good fishing is a given. Kevin ""Wade"" Yerxa, the #2 Guide, won the Morson Walleye Tournament last fall with highest weight and biggest fish (10.88 #'s). BVR is located in a perfect part of LOW. There is access to the North, East and West. Of course the wind is going to blow, but there are spots to escape and some of the best fishing is on windy days. Dock fishing at BVR is awesome, especially if the wind is blowing from the West or North. Our grand kids have caught many fish off the dock with the biggest being a 26"" walleye and 12# Northern. Close by the resort our son caught a Muskie first cast 2 years ago and last summer the 2 Newbies (Jess & Angela) caught a 38"" and 42"" Muskie. Even with these accomplishments I am referred to as the Junior Guide. LOW is very captivating, especially in this area. Every island has a post card view and the natural setting is pristine. It reminds me of being on a Boundry Waters lake with a motor. Mylie's resort is nice but there is no food. You can't go wrong with Buena Vista Resort. M. Howard Hudson, WI"
1381481,Shorelunch,2012-01-11 08:12:00,554,"We have a cabin close to Mylies and BV. Needless to say, it is a great area to fish out of. A 10-15 minute boat ride will get you to fantastic fishing. Wind-wise, unless it's gail force winds, you can get out and fish from either location, as there's lots of islands to hide behind. Both resorts treat their guests well and want them to have success. Book it and have fun!!!"
