1384721,IaDave,2012-01-22 15:34:00,476,I have gone solo a few times and they have always been short trips 3-4 days. I like the fact that I can fish the way that I want- have been on many trips with folks who think they are experts and know what presentations to use because that's always worked and are so hardheaded(mainly Bohemies as I call them) that no sense in trying something else. I don't go to the remotest lakes so there are usually boats around but I do tell the folks that run the place a general idea where I will be and when I should be back.
1383681,Guest,2012-01-19 14:33:00,0,"I would do it in a heartbeat, it certainly takes a certain kind of person to do it but it sound like you are one of them. You sound like you know the drill, as others have said, paddle, jacket, matches etc...., have a great time! Maybe catch a few episodes of survivor man before you go just to brush up and get you in the mood! LOL"
1383712,southernEyes,2012-01-19 16:23:00,232,"Any recommendations on walkies or vhfs? Where I live, they are nearly useless beyond 1/4 mile due to the terrain. Up in Quebec it is much flatter bust still semi rolling. Typically I will be fishing some 20 air miles out of the main lodge. I would like to have the ability to communicate out in the case of a dire emergency because frankly,nobody is coming to look for me until weeks end no matter how many float plans I leave them. I guess a locator beacon would be ideal? I know one thing, I am ready to be in Gods country! Only 167.5 days"
1383760,trapperbob,2012-01-19 18:51:00,45,The best allaround communication device is a satellite phone. All you need to do is rent one for a week. I rent one everytime I go to an outpost and I know that they don`t have an emergency radio. One year I was able to call my 14 year old daughter who was in Costa Rica on a trip. Called her cell one night so cool. Had a near emergency on one trip with a broken engine miles away from camp and almost dark and no way to call. From then on I bring a phone. Plus it keeps wife happy knowing she can reach me in an emergency.
1383814,guidedfishing,2012-01-19 21:43:00,531,"Your not crazy, just need to have a good back up plan if things go south. When my son was younger 11-13 we made multiple trips for a week at a time boating in 12 miles, setting up camp and having a great time just the two of us. Although not solo I did everything I could to make sure I mitigated any additional risk. My boat has a kicker motor and I made sure my son could operate both, I made him practice with the kill switches so he knew what he had to do to get the motor running in the event it was pulled. I also made a practice of wearing the kill switch along with our life vests no exceptions. I kept spare rations in the boat, a small tarp and fire starting supplies in case we could not make it back to camp we could get some shelter up. Have a good first add kit, and spare prop. No sense rushing or taking risks. At the very least make sure some one know exactly where your at when your coming out. The satellite phone is a good idea, if your solo. one slip on a slippery rock and your back goes out, have done that before, that is a real bear when your by yourself. good luck GF"
1383818,Nimstug,2012-01-19 22:07:00,2605,"I had the chance to do a solo for my first trip (moronic former brother in law backed out less than a week to go) and I did not go. I don't regret not going solo that first trip. Now that I have 8 or so trips to Ontario, I wouldn't hesitate.You got about all the safety advice in the previous posts. Check with your lodge about their radio capabilites if any. If you were to fish where I go on Rainy, UHF's probably won't be useful. You might want to think about one of those small flexible tripods for your camera so you can get pictures of you and the fish.Nimstug...the voices in my head keep me company."
1383846,NathanH,2012-01-20 05:03:00,697,"Southerneyes, If you are 20 air miles back I would suggest A SPOT you can get them at Cabelas or other retail locations and online. Below is a discription, I am in no way affiliated with the company nor do I own one. But it could be just the ticket to give you and others peace of mind on your trip.<LI jQuery1327060764517=""1358"">Message success rate of nearly 100% <LI jQuery1327060764517=""1359"">Relay your movements to emergency contacts <LI jQuery1327060764517=""1360"">Waterproof and shockproof If your outdoor adventures take you to remote areas, the Satellite Personal Outdoor Tracker (SPOT) could be a lifesaver. It's the world's first satellite messenger capable of sending alerts to family, friends or a 911 center. The 911 button sends your coordinates to North American authorities every five minutes until the alert is canceled. The unit's HELP button sends a personalized note, current location coordinates and a link to a Google Map to up to five cell phone numbers and e-mail addresses if you need assistance, but don't require emergency services or immediate rescue. The TEST/OK button verifies that the unit works or sends an ""all is well"" message. Built to handle extreme conditions, SPOT is water-resistant to 3-1/2 ft., buoyant, rated to handle salt, fog, and humidity; it operates in temperatures from -40°F to 185°F and at altitudes ranging from -300 ft. to 21,300 ft. An On/Off power button prevents accidental activation and transmission. SPOT works in North and South America, Europe, Russia, Australia and hundreds of miles offshore independently of cell phone systems. Included AA lithium batteries last up to 14 days in tracking mode, seven days in 911 mode and supply power to send upwards of 1,900 messages. Wt: 7.4 oz. Requires annual subscription with manufacturer"
1383860,mroyle,2012-01-20 06:17:00,74,"No doubt you need a satelite phone...you can rent one for about $75 for the week. You're gonna need some help with the portage, eh? Good luck."
1384031,Lovetofish,2012-01-20 12:49:00,458,I wouldn't be affraid to go to our camp alone. I know the water well enough but I would have a dependable spare motor along.
1384347,Mondo_)H,2012-01-21 15:03:00,91,Southern....where do you go to in Quebec?
1384592,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-01-22 08:51:00,235,"I would prefer to go with a group, not just for safety but moreso for the comeradery of the fine people I know. There's something about experiencing the remarkable with people that you can talk about it with and reminisce. I've had some great times fishing by myself, though, so I'm sure I could enjoy it, but I'm still not sure I would ever pursue this. But by all means, if you have the drive to do it and you take precautions, DO IT!"
1383595,southernEyes,2012-01-19 10:52:00,232,"I am planning to head back to my usual camp in Quebec this year. Normally, 2-5 additional guys join up, and we have a good size group going. However, the economy, children and lack of inspiration has taken its toll and left me as the only one wanting or able to return this July. I have already sent the deposit, and have no personal worries about going it alone. Everyone I know though, says I am out of my mind for wanting to go solo. I have talked to other guys that have gone solo to the same place with no issues, and even know of an older guy that went alone after some of his buddies passed on. I know the risks and dangers, and think that I am fairly well prepared and experienced in dealing with such things. So, am I crazy and just asking for trouble? Would you go solo?"
1383612,Cash,2012-01-19 11:48:00,73,I went for 3 days the first week of Sept. '11 by myself. It was wonderful. Pure solitude. Go for it.
1383618,fishincrazy,2012-01-19 11:59:00,1282,Question is this an outpost camp?Or a Lodge camp?FC
1383626,ohiojmj,2012-01-19 12:15:00,1262,"I've thought about it since kids got busy with college and signifcant others. While i would certainly enjoy a week with my boys, friends, or relatives on a fishing trip to Canada, I would definitely enjoy a solo. You are not crazy.I would be more cautious in a solo, wearing life jacket full time, have a means to climb back in your boat, and think about using the motor kill switch attachment to yourself since there is no one to help if you are in the drink and the boat idles off. Let someone know your daily travel plan on the lake. I've always brought a backpack with flashlight, lighter, bug spray, tarp, rainsuit, Spam, water purification tablets, metal cup, etc. for the shore emergency, plus spare prop, tools, etc. Bring light weight net that can be managed with one hand.Enjoy!"
1383634,mrwalleye5,2012-01-19 12:30:00,1922,I have gone solo for no more then three days and love it. It always amazes me how fast a day goes even when there is no one to talk to. I have to agree with previous post.... the solitdue is golden.
1383635,Golden Eagle,2012-01-19 12:31:00,2642,"Yes, you are crazy. Yes, I have gone solo a bunch of times. It's great. One time in late August our party was being picked up at an outpost on Cobham River. I asked our pilot about dropping me off on Little Vermilion Lake on the flight back to Red Lake. It was okay with him, but he mentioned the camp was shut down that week. I was dropped off. Told the pilot to let the camp owner know that I was there and would leave - later. Had one of my Cobham party call my wife to let her know I'd be home - later. 8 days later I was picking up a walleye dinner around sunset and was buzzed by the camp owner. I took in a couple extra walleyes and he had a couple of extra beers in my refrigerator. P.S. Cobham River Outpost was my second trip to NW Ontario that year. Got home around September 10. About 2 weeks later I was sitting at my desk Wednesday noon, feeling sorry for myself because the fishing season was getting away from me. Hit the speed dial on my phone and was in touch with my outfitter. He had a plane going to camp late Friday and it was empty going in. I left my driveway at 4 a.m. the next morning (no alarm clock needed) and covered 1475 miles in time to board the floatplane Friday afternoon. Left when moose hunters arrived 9 days later. Did the same thing 2 years later. Told my wife I really didn't need another trip. She, ""Well, why are you going?"" Me, Because some people think I shouldn't do it."" She, That's what I thought.? I've done several solo October trips. I make it in any way I can catch a ride and leave when moose hunters fly in. Sometimes there will be another fisherman or a camp worker around, but not always. Be crazy. It has rewards.Don't allow anybody to talk you out of going."
1383639,southernEyes,2012-01-19 12:39:00,232,"This is a drive to lodge, and then portage to another lake where I will be staying. Only 1 -2 hours out from the main lodge by boat depending on weather. Usually when the group went, every boat had a survival bag with all the essentials to last a few days. So that is not a concern. Actually, I have no real concerns other than motor failure while I am miles from the cabin. I think I would love the solitude as well, I am just that kind of person. Im still open for suggestions! Thanks"
1383644,Larry Mac,2012-01-19 12:53:00,530,"Hi southernEyes, The above is good advice. EnjoyThank you,Larry Mac"
1383657,NathanH,2012-01-19 13:46:00,697,"Crazy No way. I fish a lot alone and in some remote locations in the US as well as hunt. Just remember to be safe, where your jacket when in the boat. Have a phone or walkie to contact the lodge with you at all times in a waterproof container. If something crazy happens chances are you would be screwed even with another person with you."
1383659,HeHooksHimself,2012-01-19 13:50:00,725,"My BIL and i go, just the two of us, each fall. We have similar likes and get along great, so its like going with a good friend. I like going that way so we can share the fun, stories and experiences. I am a guy that likes my alone time, but for me, something like a trip to Canada is better shared. However, if the alternative is not going, I would go alone."
