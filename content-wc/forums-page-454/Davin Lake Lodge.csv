Planning a trip to Saskatchewan in July and was looking for someone who's fished these lakes. Walleye, pike, and lake trout fishing all look to be outstanding. Any help would be appreciated."

1385223,jWN,2012-01-23 18:25:00,62,Looks like real good prices for a lake that far north. I am kinda suprised they aren't catching more of the trophy size pike then what they said on the web site and the trout sound a bit on the small size for that area. But with that thought leads me to think that you will get what they are advertizing.

1385967,wallydave,2012-01-25 16:02:00,2151,"There are a lot of lakes in Canada, and not every walleye wrangler is on WC. Did you try the search function at the top of the page? The website looked pretty good, and we worry about our choices of lakes, and outfitters. Trips are hard to put together, and not cheap either. Give this lake a try, fishing is only part of a great trip, the fun in the trip North and back home, the cabin, in the boat, and around a campfire, all important factors. True fantastic fishing, always helps!! Most of the time we can make a trip great, just by facing the good days and bad days as a group! One of my favorite trips was on a new lake with lousy fishing and no support from the camp staff, despite all of that we made sure we had a trip we still laugh about!! Its your trip make the best of it, and tells how it went!!"
