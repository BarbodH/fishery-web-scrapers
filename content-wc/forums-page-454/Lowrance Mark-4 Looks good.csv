1386284,Seanik,2012-01-26 10:42:00,218,"I have been looking for a fishfinder/gps combo for remote lakes in Ontario and think the new Lowrance Mark-4 may be what I'll buy. I talked to a Lowrance tech on the phone this AM. and got the following info from him; the current draw is 320 ma, The color version (elite-4 is double 320 ma), Lowrance is coming out with a portable version, a portable kit is now available ppp-18 but a bit pricey. The Mark-4 comes loaded with a USA base map and slot for Navronics chips. I asked the tech, if I buy this unit in Canada will Lowrance have a Canada base map loaded in this unit, he said NO, only comes with the USA base map and I replied this doesn't seem right. The Lowrance Mark-4 is being sold by Bass Pro for 199.99, I found a dealer in Florida at 189.99. This unit seems like a great value and a lot of features including a duel beam transducer but I'm waiting for the portable to be on the market. Comments welcomed Seanik"

Will the outfitters at these remote lakes you mentioned have battery recharging capabilities? IMHO, colour units are the way to go even when you consider the bigger power draw. I run my Lowrance HDS7 with a 51 amp hour deep cycle battery for my week long walleye fishing trips into remote lake fishing locations (no battery recharging facilities). A fishing buddy built me a stainless steel carrying case that holds everything. A little weighty but almost indestructible. Admittedly, my configuration is only OK for drive in or boat in trips."
1386342,Seanik,2012-01-26 13:51:00,218,"Retire 55, The portable Mark-4 is not yet available, the portable units Lowrance has presently available usually come with a waterproof cover and carrying handle, a battery pack that usually holds 8 d-cell batteries and a plastic bottom attaching plate. Many of the Humminbird portables come with a 7 amp gel battery and charger. The fly in lakes I sometimes frequent do not have hydro or limited times at night. I plan on rigging up a portable solar recharging unit to take on these trips. I agree color is the way to go. Seanik"

Loved that unit....I've been looking for a new portable, and was eyeballing the Lowrance Mark 5x-DSI portable. http://www.lowrance.com/Products/Mar...-DSI-Portable/ Stopped by the local Cabela's and the salesman told me to wait 'til March, apparently when the new models will be out. I prefer d-cells over the gel cells, most of the outposts I like have no way to recharge the gel cells.Is color really that important?"
1386569,Mohleye,2012-01-27 07:46:00,368,"Misanthrope, there was a thread on here a few months ago discussing portable depth finders, try a search, it had some good comments. Some of the newer portable units available today use 8 AA batteries. I don't think there are any made that take D cells anymore. The units that take AA's are smaller and lighter, which I like as we do a lot of portaging. However the batteries will not last all week so you need to take a spare set. Color is not important to me, all I'm really interested in is the depth"
