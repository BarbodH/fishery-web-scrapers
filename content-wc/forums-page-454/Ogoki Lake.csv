550113,WillieB,2005-07-06 03:18:00,292,Do a search using Ogoki or Whitewater...there has been a decent amount of information posted on them that should help you quite a bit. Good luck and enjoy!

550176,ONE TIME DAVE,2005-07-07 12:36:00,110,"Just talked to a person who spent a week at Kayedon Lake, ajoins Ogoki Lake, by water. The river flows into Ogoki and then through Kayedon. Said walleye fishing was awesome, anywhere there was current. He stayed with Arctic Watershed Outposts on Kayedon. www.awo.com. Said cabin, boats, motors all were great."

All released except for the 9 we ate that week. The walleye were typically 18-22 inches. We never targeted pike but caught dozens fishing for walleye (which is typical). 46 incher caught on a worm harness with bottom bouncer!http://www.escapenorth.com/ogoki/ogokilist.html Here is the place we stayed at. Good boats, sheltered bay allowing fishing even during wind (unlike main lake)"

My brother, dad and I among others fished both lakes back in the 70's. One of our buddies has a 25# 8 ouncew pike hanging on his wall in Sebewaing, mi. biggest walleye as above was 8#. Had a friend make 100 casts and landed 100 eyes at the outlet of Ogoki. We went in with leuenbergers outr of Nakina. Went to the lake several times. Great fishing and from what I have rewad on here it hasn't changed much over the last35yrs. Leuenberger is one of the best outfitters up there. HAVE FUN"

1384723,Guest,2012-01-22 15:55:00,0,this year we reached our goal of catching 100 fish in a day.
1385503,dog2,2012-01-24 12:34:00,198,"we were on kayedon july 8-15/11 ,water levels where down and it was the tail end of the mayfly hatch,but the fishing was great.Walleye size was above average alot of fish over 21in. In fact we had a hard time catching fish under 18 in. hot spots @ Ogogi was any where we hit a point that had wind blowing on it ,the outlet was good ,but you had to find the pockets where the fish where,current ledges ,ect .The river between Ogoki and kayedon was search and find .The fish were moving up to the lake and cooler water after the mayfly hatch, but it was good fishing.The key on kayedon were rocks , deeper channels and any place you found current was also good. Our fishing was a mixture of trolling rapalas with in-line weights,and jigging .We went thru alot of jig heads.We jigged about 60% of the time,1/4oz. jig w/ MR>TWISTER Tails . Pike fishing was fair to good ,fair on size, good on numbers lots of 20 to 26 in fish several larger but no monsters,but i would say early year late fall or higher water would be better for pike. The water was so low that at places we would have to pole around the rocks to get out of kayedon to go up to ogogki. we went with Artic Watershed Outposts,Christine and Remi great people to deal with. Oh ,as I checked our log we had to catch over 75 walleye to get 4 fish under 18in. Our group of 3 probably caught 75 plus walleye a day out of one boat.On the days we would spend fishing for pike we averaged 35 or so apiece,we would only fish for pike during mid day."
