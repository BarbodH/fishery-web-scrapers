1385095,v-bay gord,2012-01-23 14:10:00,3168,"Just to add to what Bill said... I suppose those of us who have grown kids, in retrospect and with hindsight, would love to have had (or taken) the opportunity that is being discussed here. I suppose there are many variables that need to be considered, but for me the idea of the fly in would be the ultimate. No distractions other than the two of you doing what it takes to make the trip work. Who knows, the highlight of the trip might turn out to be your son cooking breakfast for the old man......the fishing would be a bonus."
1385110,Larry Mac,2012-01-23 14:50:00,530,"Well stated V Bay Gord, I have been blessed to been given that opportunity with my sons and jumped all over it. We have not looked back since and have had many, many wonderful days in the Canadian Wilderness. My youngest son Ben is 16 and had been to Canada at least a dozen times. I have attached a picture of his first Canadian Walleye he caught when he was 4 or 5. His smile says it all. We were on a very remote wilderness adventure together. Have a great tripThank you,Larry Mac"
1385162,new hips,2012-01-23 16:55:00,498,"When I take my Grandson, it will be to:http://eaglefallslodge.com It's a drive to Red Lake then boat in to a no access lake called Parker, which is loaded with fish, easy to catch 14-20in walleye also very good Northern fishing. It's small 5-6 miles total and all dead ended, but plenty of bays and no open water, perfect for young kids. Food is excellent also. Travis & Carrie are a great young couple. You also have access to Red Lake when you get those calm days for bigger walleye and Northern."
1385170,jiggster,2012-01-23 17:10:00,183,"If you are looking for fantastic walleye fishing with northern and bass and not American plan, i would look at Andersons Manitou Falls Camp. Catch walleyes off the dock . Located on the English River by Ear Falls. Need more information send a P.M. My sons all time favorite that is not american plan."
1385204,Guest,2012-01-23 17:58:00,0,"Obabikon Isn't your post above just a little bit overboard in the advertising part of/for your camp! I have seen other posters get nuked for this in the past. It just doesn't seem fair or look good to all the viewers if we forget the rules of this site. But on a positive note, I do appreciate your support of Walleye Central in their flash banners advertising site. Thanks again for your support and keep up the advertising where it belongs and lets keep the integrity for ALL that view and read this site. Because without financial support of advertisers like you, this site wouldn't be possible for ALL of us to enjoy. Thanks and hope no offense is taken because none was meant. Just an observation, also welcome back. P.S. I know somebody is thinking or saying that other outfitters do it, it still isn't right or it doesn't change the rules originally set by the Owners/founders. Just my opinion. donnie"
1385216,jiggster,2012-01-23 18:14:00,183,"Donnie, I do not take offense. I am not affiliated with the camp. I am just state how my son and I feel . Trying to help another father son enjoy fishing as much as we do. I have also post other lodges we have enjoyed together with American plans. The important thing is to spend time with your children and build that important bond and memories. I have spent 44 years working with children in school, coaching, taking them on trips to the boundary waters and environmental camps. If it is over the top to be truthful about our experience than I am over the top."
1385262,Obabikon,2012-01-23 19:43:00,2370,"Sorry if my post offended or was interpreted as ""over the top"". I've been informed that it isn't against the rules, as I pay for the rights. Feel free to sign in and send me a PM if you'd like to further discuss it, and I can do my best to avoid stepping on too many toes. I will also point out (I'm not accusing anyone of anything) that there is nothing to creating a name. Anyone can do that and recommend their own camp. Several of us owners are on here as a service to those interested in making a trip. I'm not hiding who I am, and will be honest about it. I try to be helpful and subjective in my posts. However, when someone's asking for a Drive in American Plan resort... I will ALWAYS suggest our camp, because that's what we are."
1385328,teddi,2012-01-24 05:42:00,349,i thought you were boat in.
1385332,Ia Walihntr,2012-01-24 06:21:00,320,"Obabikon, I, and probably most of the WC contributors appreciate the wealth of info that you relay on this websitye that doesn't relate to your resort. I think the service you and most resort owners bring to this message board is invaluable to a lot of people. I, myself, look forward to posts from Richard at Buena Vista, Justin at Mylies', Gordon at Vermillion bay, Rose at Cliff Lake, (when she was still an owner) etc. and the posts of several fishing guides who all provide a wealth of info. Keep all the posts coming guys. In the long run, we are all wiser for for it. Marv"
1385354,Obabikon,2012-01-24 07:17:00,2370,"Yep, we definately are a ""boat in"". However, those are still considered drive in's. Typically, anything people don't fly into is considered a drive in."
1384794,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-22 18:37:00,1460,You might not want to limit your border crossing to Ft. Francis. You could also cross at Pidgeon River and drive to http://www.forrestlodge.com/Another option.
1384802,Larry Mac,2012-01-22 18:51:00,530,"Hi misanthrope, I too must agree 100% with V-bay gord and Narda 1, do the fly in if you can. I have 3 boys and my youngest had been going since he was 5 (he is 16 now). Many of the camps that you mentioned would accommodate the two of you. If you cannot pull off the flyin I also agree 100% with Wallydave and try Ghost River. I have been there many times and it is a great camp. Have a great trip with your son. Feel Free to PM me if you want. Thank you,Larry Mac"
1384808,Hawker,2012-01-22 19:09:00,3967,"Young's Wilderness Camp, 1 hr drive north out of Fr Francis, just north of Nestor Falls! Great American Plan, wonderful owners, great staff, excellent accommodations, super food, superb fishing, niece boats & motors and they offer a 3 + 3 plan where you spend three days at the main camp American Plan and three days at their fly-in on Kishnatina (wrong spelling I know)! The 3 + 3 would give you the best of both worlds!!(http://youngswildernesscamp.com/)"
1384830,wallydave,2012-01-22 20:21:00,2151,"www.lacseul.comWith a drive-in camp, you are not limited by weight, you could take some prepared meals that would reduce your cooking stress. One year I my group switched weeks on me, so my son and I went to Goose Bay and tent camped. Ear Falls is just a few mile away, so we had a few meals in town, cooked up walleye and taters over a fire. Andrea has some smaller cabins perfect for a dad and son, so you could microwave a few meals. Spending time with your son up North is a very special experiance, one of my favorite memories as a dad!"
1384884,bellbuoy,2012-01-23 05:54:00,490,"Witch Bay, remote of a fly in as it is six to seven miles back off of the road. I took my son there when he was seven and we started going annually this past year and he just turned 15."
1384912,micropterus,2012-01-23 07:03:00,450,V-bay gord and Narda 1 are right.
1384946,Bill Krejca,2012-01-23 08:37:00,6107,"Re: Dad doing all the work - This really is an opportunity to treat your son as an adult. Kids love to do stuff that back home only adults do, and maybe he wouldn't want to do at home. By way of preparation, before the trip, explain to him how he will be treated as an adult by him doing some of the activities that you'll both need done, and that you'll rely on him for his help. Kids are sponges for quick learning, and it can be a very fun experience for him. As a way of recognizing his entrance to adulthood, let him do other fun safe adult activities, like sometimes running the motor, asking him how he would fish an area, and then doing it, starting a fire, maybe, etc, along with other activities, with you standing by, in a supervisory role. Giving him some of the tasks breeds familiarity, as well as moving him from kid's status toward adult. Point out, also, the beauty of the sunset, scenery artistry, and wildlife running the shore. He will carry these memories all his life, and on those days when the fish aren't biting, he will learn to rely on noticing those sights and sounds of the north woods, and maybe not even care if the fish are not always biting. And someday, he'll be taking you with him. I know. Bill Krejca"
1384987,SoulFulCry,2012-01-23 10:08:00,158,u do know that there are american plan camp up here in red lake n the lake is huge so u can show ur son the expeiences that i enjoyed when i was his age even if u have to cook which aint abig deal lettin him experience the trip of his life with his best freind n father is a fine gift but what ever u choose he will remeber it forever
1384988,Ia Walihntr,2012-01-23 10:10:00,320,"Well said, Bill"
1385091,Obabikon,2012-01-23 14:04:00,2370,"www.obabikon.com boat in resort... and kids are half price. I can definatley see the enjoyment of all the different types of trips you can plan. But, if you're looking for seclusion, and want to spend as much time on the water as possible... we'd be a pretty good choice!"
1384730,Guest,2012-01-22 16:22:00,0,"Well it looks like the regular group has fallen apart this year. I've been fishing outposts out of Red Lake for years.. Viking, Chimo, Greens, Canadian Fly-in. This year, the group couldn't get their ****e together in time for the All Canada Show.. Now, here's the rub, my boy was really looking forward to going for the first time this year. At 10 years old, I'm a little concerned about the two of us doing a fly out, with me handling all the cooking, cleaning, camp chores etc. So I'm thinking about maybe a quick 3-4 day trip, American Plan, closer to Fort Frances than Red Lake. Any suggestions?"
1384737,jiggster,2012-01-22 16:38:00,183,"You might want to try Eagle Lake Island Lodge. This is one of my sons favorite American plan lodge. Another one would be Bear Trail Lodge also on Eagle Lake. I f you want a little farther north there many nice place between Vermillion Bay and Ear Falls. Lac Suel is another great fisheries if you prefer large water. I have not stayed at Evergreen Lodge, heard it is very nice, looks fine when I have been by it. Might check that one also."
1384740,v-bay gord,2012-01-22 16:45:00,3168,"Suggestion.....do a fly in and show your son how to cook, clean and do camp chores with his dad."
1384751,wallydave,2012-01-22 17:05:00,2151,http://www.ghostriverlodges.com/Check out this spot. I have a fishen buddy that has gone to Ghost River for four years straight. Loves the fishing and the service. It is a boat-in with American plan and 15 lakes to fish.
1384754,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-22 17:09:00,1460,"If I were in your shoes, without knowing your budget, time flexibilty, or where your from , may I suggest Moose Point Lodge on Shikag.http://www.moosepointlodge.com/You could take a short flight out of Ft. Francis with Northern Wilderness Outfitters that your 10 yr. old would love. When I was there 21 yrs. ago, food was spectacular, fishing was amazing, and the service spectacular. As a dad, you would only need to concentrate on keeping the boar over fish. They also have guide service.Yep, thats what I would do."
1384757,fishincrazy,2012-01-22 17:14:00,1282,"Check out Garden Island Lodgehttp://www.garden-island.com/We've been going for years the fishing is great,the location is secluded the service is first rate!!!FC"
1384772,NARDA 1,2012-01-22 17:41:00,636,"I have to agree with V-Bay Gord, Take him on the fly-in. It's an opportunity you can't pass up. My son is now 27 and while I have taken him to Canada several times when he was younger, it has been very difficult to get him up there as he has gotten older (girls, school, work, girls, etc.) so take the chance while you can get it. If you still want a nice drive to, check out www.birchdalelodge.com they have a great American Plan where you chose your meals off of a menu instead of everyone eating the same thing. Great for kids that are picky eaters. Most of all have a great trip with your son, it doesn't get any better than that!"
