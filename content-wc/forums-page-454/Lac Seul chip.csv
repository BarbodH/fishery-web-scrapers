1384828,KTroller,2012-01-22 20:19:00,237,Yes. I have the Dec 2006 Canada Premium Hotmaps chip by Navionics and it does have Lac Suel.KT
1385452,cuamb,2012-01-24 11:06:00,203,Just an FYI as posted on here before. The Navionics North also has Lac Suel on it. I have both chips and the Lac Suel information is identical on both.
