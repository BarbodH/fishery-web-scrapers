My boys think Karly is growing up fine. Babe tell the girls that he has a Banjo rod rigged and they are to drop their poles and throw the banjo professionally enough to distract the big pike from the walleye halfway down the gullet. Where's the banjo? Where's the banjo? Babe shouts. Girls don't budge. Hilarious! Babe also loses one in the trolling motor. Nice shore lunch, and Kris's Kitchen was Walleye Linguine. Absolute must see."

During those times, he and his crew were very gracious and friendly. He would have a drink in the evening and played the guitar on a few occasions down at the ""BS Dock"" Also put long hours on the water. Gave away a lot of stuff, had fun posing for pictures with folks, etc. It was fun to see just how complicated the filming of a half-hour show can be, with a diver taking underwater shots, cameraman in another boat, etc."
1385789,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-25 09:41:00,1460,Must be gratifying to know how Babe feels where you fish. His excitement and passion must have been great to be around in fish camp.
