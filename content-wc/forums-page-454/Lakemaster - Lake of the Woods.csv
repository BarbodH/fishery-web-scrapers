This version only covered the southern half of the lake (coverage ends south of Crescent Island) but I was given assurances that I could purchase the updated version for an additional $50 once they had finished mapping the lake. Phoned late last week to see what kind of progress they had made in the mapping and if I should be getting an update. I was informed that they were not going to provide updates for Lowrance customers because they had been bought out by Johnson Outdoors (Hummingbird, Minnkota). Call me old fashioned but I think that buying out a company should also involve honouring any previous commitments to customers. I would not have purchased the chip if I knew I would not be getting coverage for the north end of the lake. Guess this is the new reality but it seems a little vindictive to put the boots to Lowrance users. Not the best way to convince me to buy a bird!"
