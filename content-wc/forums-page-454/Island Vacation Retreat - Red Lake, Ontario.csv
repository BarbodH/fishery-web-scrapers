1385124,bergsh,2012-01-23 15:28:00,183,Trying to find out about what a week at Island Vacation Retreat on Mckenzie Island costs? Trying to find a place for the inlaws to go.No boat needed. Wondering if anyone stayed there last year and knows what the going rate is for a week? PM me if you want. Thanks
1385231,Ia Walihntr,2012-01-23 18:36:00,320,"2011 rates for Lodging only to include modern cottage with bedding, utensils, appliances, battery charging, and use of fish house was $265 per person per week. Dockage was $50 per week.www.islandvacationretreat.com"
1385240,bergsh,2012-01-23 18:52:00,183,Ia Walihntr thanks for the information. I will let them know. Seems pretty reasonable. Do they put you on the fish?
1385339,Ia Walihntr,2012-01-24 06:31:00,320,"Would guess that they do, but can't guarantee it. Most resort owners will help their guest with fishing locations. Happy customers will probably come back! Hiring a guide for even just one day can give you enough info (locations, presentations etc.) to make the rest of your fishing time much more productive when you are again on you own."
