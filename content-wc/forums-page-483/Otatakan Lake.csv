I am assuming you feel the same way, but I am already losing sleep because I am so excited. I will be waiting for you to get back and fill me in on all of the secrets of otatakan! Have you heard from anybody else yet on tips or techniques? Let me know. Thanks."

Cast cranks for walleye and pike where the river enters the lake on the west end below the rapids. We portaged up that river to a small lake and took some pike in the 20lb range casting/trolling spoons and bigger crank baits. The north shore of the western lobe of the lake and any windward islands or rock shoreline (12-18ft) produced walleyes. Backtrolling pink, green, white and orange 3/8 jigs with a beetle spin and a white, yellow, orange & green tail worked well. I'm sure a jig/minnow combo would be killer if you want to go that route. Also where the river leaves the lake on the east end there is a few sets or rapids. fish below each set for walleyes. We did get some nice pike casting the weedy narrow section between the two lobes. Hope this helps. You should have fun. DaveO"

This year we are going in June so I'm not sure how that will change things, but in the past the fishing has been great. No trophies, but non-stop action. We always fished the river entry into the lake and the river leaving the lake on the other end. Fantastic time every time we go, its been a few years now since we've gone and I'm really looking forward to getting up there again."

First I'd like to thank the staff at L&M, I now understand why you have so many repeat customers.....Now to the fishing:Too many walley to count. They were still in the rivers and at the various points that Larry circled on our map. We used Leeches and minnows on any color 1/4 to 3/8 ounce Jig. We caught them casting and trolling any shad or firetiger colored plug. We caught several Northerns this way as well (Although we did not specifically target them). Biggest Northern was 36"" with another 35 and 33 caught as well. Biggest Walleye was 6lbs. The rest of the walleye averaged 16"" to 19"" but were very fat.Thanks again to L&M for wonderful accomodations and great service. We all give them 5 stars.Keithps. I do recommend live bait, either leeches or minnows. I do consider myself a pretty good walleye fisherman and I was outfished 3 to 1 when not using live bait. (Just a thought, since you're spending alot of money to go on the trip anyways)."
