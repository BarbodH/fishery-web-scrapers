They get a ton of use, Stan and his crew do their best to keep them in good condition ..The main lake is fairly big and can get rough, but there are a ton of spots that can be fished, that will get you out of the wind .Now!! The fishing !!! 1 word, AWESOME .. I guide there on occasion and the walleye & pike fishing is outstanding ..It wont hurt you to give http://www.northstarlodge.com/ a try ."

A little bit different if you are used to fishing the clear or tea colored waters of Canada. Threw me off for a little while until we adjusted to it then everything was fine.Look closer at the water in pictures on North Star's website and you will see what I mean. Have fun.Pooch"
