It is very nice to go to sleep to but if you wake up in the middle of the night or first thing in the morning, you would swear it is pouring down rain outside. Seeing the Chutes for the first time as you come around the bend after 1 1/2 hour trip up the river is one of the best parts of the trip. Can't wait. Less than a month."
1318711,unclepaully,2011-06-15 16:24:00,112,NemogosendaRiver-How would you rate the fishing at the chutes??? I would much rather listen to that waterfall than say the hum of a generator all night.
1318765,NemegosendaRiver,2011-06-15 19:19:00,66,"Probably 9 out of 10. The fishing gets better every year. When i was growing up a ""dink"" walleye was 10 inches. Now the new dink is 16. I would say average fish is probably 19 inches. Several in the 22 to 25 inch range. Big fish of the week is typically between 26 and 29 inches. Average Pike is probably 27. Your group will catch a number of 35 class fish and a handful each year over 40.That camp is a LOT of work the first day and the last day getting everything up the hill and back down at the end, on and off the plane. It is a great camp but you need to have the proper....""want to"" and expectations going in. The cabin isn't perfect, but there are two so it can sleep up to 14. If you want more info shoot me an email. rsmcouts(at)gmail. com I'd be happy to provide some contact info. If you do book a trip I will provide you some fishing info, spots, lures, etc."

1319288,NemegosendaRiver,2011-06-17 06:06:00,66,"You should see how close our boats are launched to the beginning of that mess. Leading up to the trip I frequently have dreams about a motor cutting out after launch or something. Not a rapids i would want to shoot in an aluminum boat. I can hear the chutes already, I can smell a crisp morning at sunrise, I can hear the lap of the water on the side of the aluminum, I can feel that first bump, I can feel the first ""no-movement"" hookset....these next 4 weeks can't go by soon enough."
1319818,unclepaully,2011-06-18 18:32:00,112,NemogosendaRiver-How much fishable water is there?
1320277,NemegosendaRiver,2011-06-20 05:28:00,66,"I would guess 7 miles above the chutes and 25 miles below the chutes of fishable river system. Along with 4 lakes that are actually part of the river system. Frog Lake, Pike Lake, Pine Lake and Kapuskasing Lake (which also attaches to the Chapleau River)"
1320280,Juls,2011-06-20 05:34:00,13414,Have a great trip! May your motor work perfectly the entire time too. Looks like a great place to visit.Juls
1316884,unclepaully,2011-06-10 14:30:00,112,"Hey guys I wanted to get some thoughts on what you guys think is the outpost with the best fishing, combined with the best scenery. I'm talking things like waterfalls, soaring cliffs overlooking the lake, dramatic rock outcroppings... This past year I ice-fished Bolkow lake in the Chapleau game preserve and that was a lake that had the amazing backdrop but the fishing was just okay, not to mention it doesn't have an outpost camp. I have also fished beteau lake on the attawapiskat and while scenic it didn't have that wow factor. Just curious to see what you think. So far in my search Showalters seems to have some lakes with some nice looking waterfalls... just not sure about the fishing. http://www.flyincanada.com/canada-fl...ke-ontario.htmlooking forward to your thoughts on this. Feel free to toss in a pic for an example. Thanks guys"
1316892,adempsey,2011-06-10 14:56:00,963,"Never been, but thought the ""Chutes"" outpost on the Nemogosenda River looked pretty neat:http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/...ictures258.jpghttp://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b1...da_2007041.jpgTaken from this thread: http://ohiogamefishing.com/community...ad.php?t=75208"
1316897,joeman79,2011-06-10 14:59:00,417,Check Out Roger Lake Outpost serviced by Big North Lodge. Have not been there but am going first week of August. Awesome 40 ft Waterfall. I will post some pics when we get back. Bow Narrows on Red Lake has some cool spots up in Pipestone Bay that are spectacular in some sunsets pics I have somewhere.
1316932,phishfearme,2011-06-10 17:21:00,1242,i would put in a vote for the telescope lake outpost cabin of viking outposts out of red lake. the large 4br cabin sits on top of a rock peninsula with a huge deck sitting overlooking the lake. the dining table also sits next to a window wall making dinner scenery excellent. and. it's surrounded by blueberry and red raspberry fields in late july. phish
1317410,Hawkfan,2011-06-12 12:46:00,237,Is that code for watch out for bears?
1317578,michigan walleye guy,2011-06-12 21:16:00,95,"The outposts at Nestor Falls Fly-In Outposts are great, scenery-wise. Have been to Larus Lake the past 11 years and am flying in to Clear Lake next week. I can't wait!Anybody else been to Larus Lake or the other Nestor Falls outposts?"
1317632,Golden Eagle,2011-06-13 06:32:00,2642,Hit NW Ontario during early October and drive from Duluth to Thunder Bay on your trip up. I've done it three times and was rewarded.
1317639,Mike Borger,2011-06-13 06:48:00,1554,In October you'd likely be rewarded with some nasty n'or easters rolling in off Superior. Beautiful drive for sure Connie. Nicest stretch of highway in Ontario.
1318124,NemegosendaRiver,2011-06-14 07:41:00,66,"I have been 22 times and if there is a better place in the world, I am not sure where it is. I may be a little biased. Been going since I was 8. 31 days until this years trip."
1318484,phishfearme,2011-06-15 05:55:00,1242,"that ""chutes"" cabin looks cool - but i'll bet it's noisy as helll phish"
