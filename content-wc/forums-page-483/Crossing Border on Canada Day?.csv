Falls and crossed border Sat. morning. That was a little bit of a wait...seems it's a little worse now.Anyway, everybody says Friday evening > Saturday morning...BUT...didn't realize July 1 Friday is Canada Day and another site said border crossings will be delayed. Anyone know or have experience with crossing on Canada Day?"
1319149,teddi,2011-06-16 17:19:00,349,"really bad, stay home. not worth the wait."
1319169,Sutsgold,2011-06-16 18:17:00,219,"It should be the same as any other Friday. My experiences on Fridays have been good. Remember, that Friday is a holiday in Canada, not the US. You most likely will be crossing with US citizens, and their schedules should pretty much be the same as any other weekly fishing trip. Good idea to avoid Saturday morning. Enjoy your trip."

1319320,zhawk,2011-06-17 07:34:00,2,Jiggster...Anderson's Lodge just south of Sioux Lookout.
1319364,teddi,2011-06-17 08:51:00,349,as our canada day is the same weekend as your july 4 the border should be fairly busy.
1319626,JinxCanada,2011-06-18 06:18:00,1306,"Yes it will be busy, however, the wait is never that long (especially compared to entering the USA) and you can check wait times online."
