1313595,campchick,2011-06-01 17:59:00,96,Get your pleasure craft operator card through your own state (Minnesota). Here is a link to the info. you'll need. http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/recreat...an_boating.pdfIt will cost you half the price of the Canadian card and is legal here. It used to be free but now it will cost you $20.00 to take the course online.
1313788,lund115,2011-06-02 07:23:00,698,I'm only in Canada for a week at a time. So I don't need any certification then?
1313800,jswinter40,2011-06-02 07:34:00,127,no you do NOT need any certification is only going a week at a time.
1314315,JinxCanada,2011-06-03 14:23:00,1306,NOPE... That law is only applied to us Canadians...nice $50.00 money grab that's it. It's not even a licence actually.

1315631,jkwildhunting,2011-06-07 16:31:00,361,We are thinking of just getting one to say we have it. We use our own boat in canada and we are only up there for 8 days but thinking it may be wise to have it just for when they possibly may make it a law a law for everyone.Will this one work for Canada also?http://www.boat-ed.com/Iowa/index.ht...FRFoKgodxRksxg
1315939,greenie,2011-06-08 10:09:00,87,"""Boating license: You may take the test on line in your home State and it will be recognized in Canada, go to licensingand take the exam. If you haven't had a chance to get the boater's license, you can do a rental boat safety checklist at the Outpost Camp. The fine for not having either is $250, only the boat operator needs to have a license or rental boat safety checklist with them at all times.""This was taken from this website below.http://www.thousandlakesoutposts.com...Trip_Planning/"

Most people cheat by having 2 computers open or even have someone else take the test for them. It's a pure money grab, and in all the years I've been fishing/boating I've never once been asked to see my operators card....not once."
