Has anyone used the Trigger X leeches, minnows or twist tails? If so how did they work and what colors produced? Thanks."

For last 5 years to Canada I have yet to touch live bait.I fish the minnows,crawlers, leeches all behind spinner/bottom bouncers.For Jigs I use the Minnow Grubs that Gulp carries use that for a twister tail. I have about every color combo of crawlers,leech, minnows and all produce well. I like the 6"" crawlers in all colors, 4"" minnows, 5"" jumbo leeches for pulling spinners. Good Luck We are 2.5 weeks till we are up north!"
