We started trying to fish rock reefs with mixed results. We then played the wind blown shore lines in 5-10' FOW and started getting into them. Red/white and firetiger stick baits and Storm Wild Eye swim shad in pearl, chart, and pink/white were the most effective baits that we found while trolling. We also jigged Yum 3"" pink blush walleye grubs in places and got into them. We found the walleye on Brace and Ara to be bigger on average than the ones that we caught in Meta, I have no idea why but that was the pattern the entire week. Our largest pike was 36"" with numerous plus 30"" pike caught all week. The pike were biting on anything that moved.The fishing was incredible and Kyle and Terry Polesky do an outstanding job with Brace Lake Outfitters. We arrived in camp to find our beer neatly stacked in our cabin with three 15 packs cooling in the fridge. Kyle had also placed two nice cubans on the kitchen table for us. The service and personal attention that we received at Brace Lake was the best that we have ever had on a Canadian fishing trip. I can not see myself going anywhere else."

1320440,mroyle,2011-06-20 10:47:00,74,How long did it take you to get from Brace to Ara? How many Walleye did you catch at Brace? Avearge size? Thanks
1320449,Jack77,2011-06-20 10:55:00,168,"About an hour to get from Brace to Ara with the 15Hp mercs that Brace Lake uses.The average sized walleye in Brace and Ara were 16-19 but we caught alot of over 20"" walleye in both lakes. The averaged sized walleye in meta was 14""-16"" I am not sure why it was like that but we repeated that same pattern all week.P.S. sorry I missed the other question- we caught a lot of walleye in Brace as a matter of fact we did our best in Brace but we like to move around and explore so we fished Meta a couple times Ara for one whole day and Brace the other times. The night before we left I was literally dropping a jig straight off the float plane dock and catching 20"" walleye."
