Weather was great, it did sprinkle for about 10 minutes one day, lots of sun and a couple of days windy. 70's during the day and 50's at night."

1316648,wallydave,2011-06-09 23:02:00,2151,"I just returned home from my trip to Lac Seul, the Ear Falls area. As others have reported, the weather was changing often, some days the winds came from three different directions! One of the Staff at Four Seasons, shared that everyone was finding the fishing difficult.Some of the folks at Goose Bay had been fishing this week at LS for 25 years and had never seen the fishing this poor. We, a family of four, a newbie, and myself, were able to catch enough for one meal a day, plus my boat/cabin buddy for this trip brought home our limit on walleye!We fished Bear Creek, Saw Mill and the mouth of the river, with the mouth to be the most productive. 14 ft of water seemed to be the best, pink jigs, and CaptainRed Breads walleye weapon, gold, char, and orange seemed to work best for me. The newbie caught a 23 in walleye and a 29in pike plus many other size eyes. My biggest were a 24in walleye, and a 33in pike, on a ultralight!We had a good trip, taking a first-timer to Canada has its own rewards!, We saw bear and moose along the road to camp, eagles, loons, otters beavers,plus a glimpse of the Northern lights on the last night sealed a good week! Next year, well we will see!"
1316724,jswinter40,2011-06-10 07:09:00,127,"dave,good to hear you made it back OK. sorry about the slow bite, but it happens. stable weather seems hard to come by this year."
1316787,chock,2011-06-10 09:35:00,19,"leaving tonight for ear falls cant wait. A little down about that report, though. The online weather report looks to be pretty good for our week. I know that can change every day, however. Hopefully a few days of decent weather will get turn them on. What water temps were you finding?"
1316896,lunker99,2011-06-10 14:58:00,236,"Dave, was the group of LS vetrans you mentioned from southern Iowa?"
1317646,wallydave,2011-06-13 07:07:00,2151,"The water temps we found were in the 54-59 range. We had one sunny calm day, the restwere cool and wet."
1317647,wallydave,2011-06-13 07:08:00,2151,"Lunker, the group was from Wisconsin, they had a tough week of fishing too! At least we weren't the only ones!"
1317986,lunker99,2011-06-13 20:01:00,236,"Thanks Dave, the reason I asked was the group I used to go with would have normally been up there last week as well. A few have been up there 25+ years so thought you might have been talking about them. Found out shortly after I asked they had changed and are up there this week this year."
1318104,wallydave,2011-06-14 07:01:00,2151,"Lunker, it looks like the Iowa group will be able to field test thier rain gear this week! Some of our best days this year were rainy days. My moto is, the fish are already wet, the rain won't hurt them! I hope they have a good week!"
1318338,DaBullz,2011-06-14 16:12:00,12,"We returned on the 12th. While the fishing was a struggle for us, many in the camp claimed to be doing well. A few others also claimed the fishing to be tough. Once the front cleared on Tuesday, the fishing seemed to pick up."
1318414,lunker99,2011-06-14 19:38:00,236,"Haven't been watching the weather up there, but yeah that will keep things interesting. Knowing them, I'm guessing they'll take advantage for some extended social hours."
