1297545,Guest,2011-04-21 06:41:00,0,We are from central Indiana and have fished Decelles only really and we didn't know the lake that well. We would lsike to go back would you suggest Norhtern Outfitters? We had heard about it after we had been there. bob
1297788,Guest,2011-04-21 17:26:00,0,"Ive fished there many years I stay at camp denise but have freinds that stay at n. outfitters. neither one one is fancy (warm, dry, and clean) if you have any questions let know."
1297824,keek,2011-04-21 19:53:00,1003,"N. Outfitters is a good place and I like it. The potential exists to fish a lot of water with a bunch of different structure. Seemed to me that 95% of the people were trolling the week we were there (second week of June). We didn't catch big numbers of walleye but we did catch them. Our group of 8 did boat 4 pike over 44"" and a bunch of 30+"" ones too. The cabins were clean and the water was hot. Wouldn't call them fancy but it covered all the bases for me. The staff are friendly as are the other guests who fished our week. The pro shop is stocked well. The dirt road to get to it from Val D'or isn't that bad. Some days we ran 20+ miles to fish by boat, some days we ran 3 miles to fish. Lots of options. Heading back this year ( 50 days!)"
1298552,Guest,2011-04-23 19:48:00,0,keek glad to hear you liked it sounds like will be there the same week of the 13th. do you know how many miles it is from rapid 13 to n.outfitters ive only been up there once and its been a long time? thanks jeff
1298834,keek,2011-04-24 18:28:00,1003,Not sure about Rapid 13 but it took us 45+ minutes if I recall to get to Rapid 16 doing about 20mph. That's pretty cool that we will be there the same time. It looks like we have cabin 1 again this year with a Silverado sporting NY tags so you got to stop on by. We'll be in a 16' starcraft with a 40 merc. on the water. Do you have any Thin-Fins? They use them up there like they are going outta' style.
1298856,Guest,2011-04-24 18:53:00,0,Ill be at camp denise rapid 7 but make my way over to rapid 13 in morning and work my way back thoughout the day. I have 17ft. blue and white sylvan 75 merc. I troll around 13 alot. no thin fins I use canadian wigllers or hotntots. if you see me there stop and say hi and we can share some tips. ive fished there a long time almost every year 16yrs. old to 44yrs.
1319348,smudjaros,2011-06-17 08:26:00,1,"Hi, Can anybody tell me the telephone number (for reversation) of the Camp Denise and the one of the N. Outfitters please. How many km of gravel is there, and is it a good road?What is the depth of the region of Camp Denise and N. Outfitters?Thank you"
1320041,keek,2011-06-19 10:33:00,1003,http://www.northern-outfitters.com/english/index.php Most waters that we fish are 4-15 fow near the shores or islands although the deepest water in the N Outfitters area is 100+ fow in the narrows in the main channel.
1320101,jdoaks,2011-06-19 15:32:00,89,camp denis is on face book the number is there.30 miles of gravel not bad at all 35mph.
1212845,Guest,2010-06-23 08:55:00,0,"well the fishin was bigest walleys ever weather was great. there was 4 of use and got several pike over 40"". that road was nice compared to before saw a bunch of guys from oh. in tumisc when leavin one with a bass boat wandered if it was u guys? be there same time next year let us know how you did when you get back"
1212851,keek,2010-06-23 09:20:00,1003,"Jdoaks-Great to hear you had good fish. When were you there and where were you? I was there from June 11-18 and heard the walleye turned on the day we left. We struggled to find the eyes most days. We did well with pike with numerous 30"" and a 40"", 42"", 45"" and one at 47"". Cool place."
1213126,Guest,2010-06-24 06:24:00,0,was there 12/19 of june camp denis. those are some nice pike you caught the bigger ones we caught wieghd more than in the past walleys and pike were bigger. were did you stay?
1213215,keek,2010-06-24 12:36:00,1003,"We stayed at Northern Outfitters. Most of our fish came on Thin-Fins trolled in water 6' or less. The big pike came from casting the weeds with stickbaits, surface lures and crankbaits."
1213339,Mondo_)H,2010-06-24 20:46:00,91,so how was your experience with Northern Outfitters and where did you fish on the lake system?
1213382,Guest,2010-06-25 06:12:00,0,did you guys notice more boats on the lake than normal seemed like some guys were following me around ?what do you guys use for trolling I use canadian wigglers and hot n tots? most of the walleys were deeper than normal and in different areas than before maybe waterlevel had something to do with it? found a few new stumps not the hard way thankfully.
1213417,keek,2010-06-25 08:21:00,1003,"Northern Outfitters was fine for me. If you are looking for a lodge that comes with a host that is intently focused on your needs than this won't be the one in my opinion. The owner as well as the head guide which were both very nice pointed us in the right direction (which was all I really asked for) and then let us be for the week. I've heard of some people really liking the interaction/friendship they have with a camp/outfitter's owner as it added to their experience. This place it seems is more for those who want to fish rather than be catered to. That being said- I liked my time there. The 24 hour generator is a bit noisy and centered in the camp though. As for trolling we used 14 & 20lb fireline about 45'-65' behind the boat and trolled Thin-Fins and Hot n Tots in 10fow or less. Speeds ranged from 1.3-2.8 mph. Gold was the color for me with blue being a close second.We caught/snagged a lot of 3"" blueish minnows while trolling too. Most fish came for us in 6 fow or less. We had a lot of close calls with the stumps. One of our guys needs a new prop from a rock hump that came up out of no where. That place is spooky- 40 fow to 3 fow in a single boat length. SCARY. We fished, Baie Nord, baie Carriaire, Rapid 16, Misery Bay, Newman Bay, plus a bunch of back bays and coves."
1213757,tpr39,2010-06-26 19:17:00,13,When you say blueish minnows what do you mean? Whitefish or something else? Do you have pictures?
1214176,Guest,2010-06-28 10:48:00,0,"Jdoaks - 10 of us, we got a couple pike at 33"", and 1 at 43"". 1 10lb walleye, 33"". We brought back our limit, but I'd have to say it was slow for us. It's been worse, but it's also been better. Threw back alot of small pike and walleye. Prob threw more back this year than last 5 trips combined. We usually get a few more big pike. Weather was tough, brought the rain suits out at least 3 days."
1214181,Guest,2010-06-28 10:59:00,0,"jd - each year we seem to see more boats out there, in the past we'd fish the whole week and not see a single boat that wasn't in our group. We generally troll thin fins and rapala's - 6 feet fow. A couple times we got a little deeper and threw on canadian wigglers We rent our boats up there, water level was definatley different, snagged up alot on our usually spots, we hit 1 stump running out at full speed, still don't know how it stayed on the boat. Thankfully no damage and no one got hurt."
1206726,Guest,2010-06-03 17:39:00,0,camp denise for the last 20 years. the price is right the fishing is good alot of places to get out of the the main channel. I know the lake well will be there on june 12th

1152606,keek,2009-12-07 07:45:00,1003,"Anybody heard about this place? It's in Quebec, south of Val'd 'or. The internet doesn't have much on it. Rumors, hearsay, theories, lies, etc. are all welcome!Thanks"
1152672,Mondo_)H,2009-12-07 12:03:00,91,"what outfitter are you thinking of using? As far as I know, there are 4 outfitters on the system."
1152681,keek,2009-12-07 12:36:00,1003,Northern Outfitters is the one who I've been in contact with. The website seems to be on the lean side of providing information.http://www.northern-outfitters.com/english/index.html
1152754,retire55,2009-12-07 17:58:00,1029,"Judging by your recent posts, you've got a passion for walleye fishing. I've been fishing for walleye the last 10 years in Quebec. Here's a few places I've been to that you might consider having a look at. With the exception of the Gouin Reservoir, these locations would be a little closer than the Decelles Reservoirhttp://www.3seasoncamp.com/ on Lake Kipawahttp://www.taggartbaylodge.com/ on Lake Kipawahttp://www.bushcountrycamp.com/ on Lake Sasseginagahttp://www.ogascanan.com/ on Lake Ogascananehttp://www.clubtroutlake.com/ on Trout Lakehttp://www.nemio.com/ on the Gouin Reservoir"

1179073,Mondo_)H,2010-03-17 14:45:00,91,"Jacqueline's Camp, Camp Denise and Sportsmans ""Lodge"" are on the NW end of the system. Of the 3, Denise would be the only 1 that I would consider. I have never been past Northern Outfitters......yet! There are a few ""private"" cabins available for rent out in the river system thru Northern Outfitters."
1179812,Mondo_)H,2010-03-19 18:34:00,91,ALL are drive-ins that are down pretty descent gravel roads
