1319390,Guest,2011-06-17 10:17:00,0,I didn't post the number because I looked it up on goggle it took about 1 minute. If the Hammerhead really wanted the number he could have looked it up. He was smart enought to get on this website and ask the question? I'm surprized he didn't ask for hours of operation and prices. I don't mind passing along info but if it's readily available I try and figure it out myself.

1318247,Hammerhead Herb,2011-06-14 11:54:00,259,"Is D&S still selling bait to individual fishermen? I used them a couple of years ago, satisfied with the count and they were quite reasonable in their prices."
1318261,teddi,2011-06-14 12:24:00,349,try pine tree bait at evergreen lodge.
1318332,lrpetp,2011-06-14 15:50:00,37,We have been using Four Seasons in Ear Falls for years and are very satisfied.
1318352,teddi,2011-06-14 17:12:00,349,"depends if you want to buy in bulk or not. 4 seasons sells by the dozen,pine tree will sell both ways."
1318429,Mark R,2011-06-14 19:58:00,1538,does pine tree have leeches also?
1318471,teddi,2011-06-15 04:25:00,349,yes they have leeches at a very good price. they have all kinds of bait at some of the best prices in the area.
1318674,lrpetp,2011-06-15 14:55:00,37,Four Seasons sells bulk as well as by the doz..
1318680,MikeMcC,2011-06-15 15:10:00,72,I like getting minnows from Whitewing. The count was far more generous than most I have run accross in the area. They also can pack them in HUGE oxygen packed bags for longer transport.
1319002,Hammerhead Herb,2011-06-16 11:08:00,259,I take it then that D&S is not around anymore. Is there a contact number for Whitewing?
1319336,Guest,2011-06-17 08:08:00,0,"Yes, there is a number."
