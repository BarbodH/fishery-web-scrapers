Have been doing fly-in trips out of Nakina for the past 15 years but not enuf time this year. A little concerned about drive-in but have heard some good things about CTL, Winiwiash, etc. Any info would be greatly appreciated. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...c/progress.gif"

Drove back out last Saturday (Jun 11) Starting late June and on the fishing should pick up a bit as the lake water gets a little warmer. While I was there the biggest walleye catch was 6 lbs by the waterfall next to the portage between Trout Lake and Win. Biggest pike caught was 12 lbs. I believe we hit the lakes a little too early in June as most of the fish were hard to find and running deep in most places. Most fish caught were smaller (between 4 and 5 lbs.) and were the only ones running in shallow water it seems. Our group of 4 stayed in cabin 1 on the island on Win. lake near the portage. We caught roughly 35 fish total. If you find nice, secluded coves with underwater logs you may get some good hits on pike. Both pike and walleye were hitting the flashy tiger lures (bright yellow, green, orange) like they were going out of style. Trolling and jigging didn't yield much but this may improve as the water warms. Black flies are in rare form this year and you will get eaten alive if you don't take a head net, wear long sleeves, and use good bug lotion. Buy a map as the coastlines of the lakes are very ""vanilla"" and all look the same. You can get lost easily. Be prepared as thunderstorms come up quick there and are ferocious. Hope this helps."

Club trout lake looks awesome, we are thinking about O sullivans too for next year. Never rule out Saseginaga the fishery is phenominal. We are going to Horwood lake in Timmins Ontario the week of June 26, I will post a report when I get back."
