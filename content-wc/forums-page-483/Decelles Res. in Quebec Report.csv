1320094,keek,2011-06-19 15:15:00,1003,Just returned from a week of fishing in Quebec. Had a great time but the fishing was challenging. Arrived on June 11 with chilly temps and rain over the next few days. Water temp was 62. Then the sun came out and the days got HOT. Water temp went into the 70's during the course of a day. Our last day was our most productive with most fish caught on worm rigs in 12 FOW. Here is a short video of our trip. To all of you still awaiting your 2011 trip... I'm jealous. My countdown started all over. Good luck to all and safe trips! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5onTSAPzi1w

Even the guides in camp were finding the days slow on our side of the res. I have a group of friends heading back up in a week and they should do better. I was marking TONS of fish but couldn't do the trick to get them in the boat. I went with the plan to troll crank-baits in less than 10 fow and switched mid-week to slow trolling worm harnesses on a bottom bouncer in 8-14 fow. They saved the trip for us.
1320140,jdoaks,2011-06-19 17:16:00,89,i pick fish up first thing in morning and then late in day 8/11 fow.I will have bottom bouncers with me next year.good thing you didnt meet us we had no fish to fry.still enjoyed our selfs. we had a nice new cabin to stay in very comfy.
