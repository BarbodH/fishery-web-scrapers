1320049,tooski,2011-06-19 11:06:00,393,"Just now returned from Richter after an 18 hour overnite drive home so bear with any mistakes. Taking the family back to Richter in three weeks and will post a more complete report - hopefully with some pix... My apologies to Phishfearme as the Pittsburgh Steeler jersey I promised to fish in (lost bet) was used to quell a potential raging forest fire and was accidentally destroyed. Originally we scheduled for Beteau but Eddie asked if we would mind fishing Richter as he had two more guys for Beteau that wanted to join the original six. With a bit of hesitation we agreed, although fishing a smaller lake twice in a month was not overly appealing.. Anyhow- The reports and PM's from 1812 and SneakyPete were pretty accurate. This lake is loaded with fish. We never brought back a fish after the first day- much simpler to just catch dinner in ten minutes off the dock. The largest pike of the week (38 inches) was caught off the dock on a jig while waiting for the plane to come in. It broke off the jig and Woody went through his gear to find and re-tie a silver minnow and on the first cast caught it again. Not a trophy but we seldom bothered fishing for the northerns. The water is clear to about 5 feet. The lake was 17 feet at the deepest spot we found. Water temps were between 65 and 67 for the most part. All fish were caught between 2 and 9 feet but we never bothered fishing the deeper water. The times when we did fish specifically for northerns the Johnson silver minnow was hands down the favorite. Top waters were more fun but Johnsons were more effective. Oddly (for me anyway) the best method for walleye was trolling jigs. They seemed to prefer the constant speed trolling provides. We caught walleye trolling Raps, Fickers and other shallow runners but the jigs were more effective and had the added advantage of just shaking them off boatside since I fish barbless. The prevailing wind shifted twice; from northwest to east and after two days back again. Made no difference except we tried to fish the windblown shores. Almost no area for shore lunches but you can reach the cabin in 15 minutes from most places. One of the best parts of this constant action is the chance to try diff methods and hardware. Not trying to start a debate since there are plenty of threads about these subjects already posted but this is what I found:Suffix 832 was better than power pro. The walleye fight like smallies and the constant line stress caused some issues with my power pro. None with suffix.Kalins salt and pepper lunker grub 4"" was better than similar sized Trigger X ( which was my fave last year on Abamasagi)Used a leader on my braided half the time due to the constant northern hits while walleye fishing. I had more success with tying lures directly to the braid than when a leader was used, although not a huge diff.I lost a LOT of fish fishing barbless compared to Brad who did not. I never found this to be an issue in previous years but the walleye in this lake are great fighters so that may be the difference.Fishing was better at high noon on a mirror lake in 5 feet of water than it was in the early morning or late evening. Long time walleye fishermen are going to think they entered the Twilight Zone when they fish this lake. Non-fishing notes... we flew a new 2000 Watt Honda generator in for Eddie. Smooth and sweet and quiet. Nakina Air is top notch. Courteous, professional and friendly. Cabin has some issues that I will address with eddie before July 9th. If you are headed to Richter feel free to PM me with any questions.. Joe T"

1320160,deputy dog,2011-06-19 18:40:00,305,"solo and tooski, did you fly in a otter or a beaver?"
1320163,tooski,2011-06-19 18:42:00,393,"Caravan on the flight in, Otter on the way out. Caravan is a sweet plane for sure.Yes, it was a great trip Mike. Forgot to mention that the Cribbs road shortcut to Nakina saved at least 1/2 hour driving time. It is a well maintained gravel road of about 19 miles. We drove around 45 mph on it without issues."
1320169,oleJoe,2011-06-19 18:48:00,114,They flew in with an Otter. Nakina air has no beavers any more.
1320204,Mike Borger,2011-06-19 20:00:00,1554,Guess I owe Eddie a case of beer. Next time up I'll have to try it.

1320232,tooski,2011-06-19 21:15:00,393,"All right, I invented that fire story. What really happened is that I was wearing the Squealer jersey when I encountered a bear ransacking the cabin. During the ensuing tussle he ruined the jersey so I will have to buy another for the photo shoot in July. We really don't make much of an effort to keep count but if forced to make a guess I would say the four of us caught over 1500 walleye for the week and we certainly didn't fish hard. From that entire total we had MAYBE 10 fish under 18"". So I can't say we caught ""nothing"" under 18.5 but I can say we caught **** few. And that is not a story. Have a great time at Kearns Phish. One of these years I will have to lower my standards and fish with you Quakers....,"
