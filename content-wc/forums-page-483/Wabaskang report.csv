1227749,Big Mike,2010-08-14 17:39:00,35,"Just got back today from Jim/Julie's after a week of hot, humid, rainy conditions. It was a strange week weather wise with temps in the upper eighties and several heavy downpours totaling over three inches for the week. Needless to say this didn't help the shallow northern bite. After getting very few fish the first few days primarily casting the weeds it was time to get back to my July pattern of trolling/casting rock points/reefs. It didn't take long for this bite to take off!!! The big northern along with tons of ""eaters"" are using deep rocks following huge pods of bait and walleyes alike. Sometimes it takes several passes with crankbaits through the pods of bait but eventually the fish will cooperate. I spoke to one of my good fishing buddies Keith that stays at Peffleys and he was having the same lack of success in the weeds, but having a great week of walleye fishing the reefs. They are just making their way out to the reefs in full force so I can't wait to get back up there next week....temps this week are supposed to be below normal...could bring the pike back to the weeds!"
1227758,pikeandtina,2010-08-14 18:19:00,145,Glad to hear you had a good trip despite the weather Big Mike. What were you catching them on? John
1227789,Big Mike,2010-08-14 21:10:00,35,"When I am targeting deep water pike I am usually pulling #9 shad raps, #11 taildancers, or deep reef runners. These smaller baits allow you to catch walleye as well as pike....however I also troll sand cats, bulldawgs, suicks, magnum shad raps, and believers. All worked well this week...we had 4 people in the boat so we mixed it up quite a bit trolling different lures all day long..."
1227794,Big Mike,2010-08-14 21:44:00,35,"Dave...was that you driving the ""chauffer"" boat on Friday as I was fishing the narrows by the reservation? If so you got a good look at how I have been doing things up there lately. The biggest problem we have is which kid gets to reel em in first!!! Take care of Keith...hope the pike come back shallow soon for him...remind him I will be back soon !!!"
1227840,Peffley'sCamp,2010-08-15 07:26:00,37,"Mike,Yea that was me. Saw those yellowbirds in the water and thought I was back on Lake Michigan salmon fishing for a moment! Wasn't sure how long a line you were fishing so tried to give you plenty of room.Wondering if you found last week that widening your spread with the birds helped the bite?Made me laugh when I read ""biggest problem is which kid gets to reel em in first"", as I can hear my girls saying ""it's my turn"", ""NO, it's MY turn"" etc.!I'll tell Keith you will see him again soon. Next week his son Andy and grandson Jake will be with them too."
1227910,Big Mike,2010-08-15 12:11:00,35,"Dave,Those boards are basically helping me get the lines away from the boat so I can get 4 lines out when my wife/kids are along. It doesn't seem to matter how far out away from the boat the baits are...I see things are finally cooling off...can't wait to get back up...later, Mike"
1229064,jka333,2010-08-19 13:47:00,14,"hey Mike..................j from Madison. Was going to head up in August....but job situation interfered. glad to see your reports. I'm the guy who landed a big N next to you.....through the second narrows and to the right.....and your kids had one on at the same time. if the job situation improves I'd like to ""tip"" one with you sometime. john"
1229248,Big Mike,2010-08-20 07:52:00,35,Sounds good to me...how big was that one? We wanted to stay and fish that area a little longer but the lightning was getting closer so we bailed out. We made it to the middle lake and pulled onto an island for about an hour and waited it out. See ya again sometime...Mike
1235077,Kevin R,2010-09-12 10:01:00,305,Mike I had internet & computer trouble did you make it back in August ?
1235197,Big Mike,2010-09-12 19:33:00,35,"Yes I was up there a couple times in Aug. My best overall fishing was Aug 21st through the 28th. Walleyes were easy pickins in the traditional deep water structure areas and also very good at night trolling crankbaits because of the full moon. Most of the daytime bite was in 25 up to 34 feet of water...using jig/minnow or lindy rig/minnow. At night we pulled shallow running shad raps, rogues, and husky jerks along rocky shorelines and did really well all the way until 3 or 4 am. Northern fishing continued to be a little tougher for big fish but we managed to catch 2 over 41"" and a couple at 39"" for the week...all of them were in the weeds on bulldawgs or various jerkbaits. I am finished with Wabaskang for this year...couple trips to Mille Lacs are coming up though...full moon walleye bite and musky hunting are close on the horizon!"
