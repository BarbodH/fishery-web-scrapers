1318452,Muffy,2011-06-14 21:33:00,23,"Hi Paxton,I have spent my entire life fishing the upper part of the seine river. My parents used to own a fishing resort on Calm lake. What part of the seine will you be visiting? for the most part we use jigs or spinners for walleyes. I like pink, orange or chartreuse. Once the weeds start getting a little thicker, it can be alot of fun casting cranks and jerks into the weed bed edges very early in the day. Bass right now are on their beds and should be for a bit longer yet. Water temp right now is approx 65f. So almost anything will work for them if you pull it through the beds. Pike are generally caught using jerk baits or larde spinner baits. the bigger guys will generally start moving out to main lake areas however bright coloured baits can pull the smaller scrappy ones out of weed beds. Trolling bigger jerk baits along deeper rocky edges or river and creek mouths can sometimes pay off as well. Good luck."
1318505,Wallii1,2011-06-15 07:23:00,37,Did they have Indianota. Use to go there years ago. Great fishing
1318535,Paxton,2011-06-15 08:53:00,10,Thanks for the information! We will probably be fishing mostly on Banning Lake.
1318844,Muffy,2011-06-15 22:01:00,23,"Wallii1,Yes, Indiaonta is the place. They sold in 87, did you stay there before then?Paxton,Banning is just upstream from Calm and down stream from Chub and Perch. It is a fairly small lake but can produce. I would recommend venturing down to calm but there are a couple of boulder piles in the river channels that you should ask Quinton about. But for the most part you can travel up and downstream for many miles. Lots of water to fish.I have very close friends from Iowa that stay at banning for the month of July. What time of the summer do you plan on coming up?"
1319457,Wallii1,2011-06-17 13:09:00,37,Yes stayed there prior to 1987. Fished the rapids up river alot along with the bays just outside the river. Good times.
1319577,Muffy,2011-06-17 20:57:00,23,Nice to hear. Glad you enjoyed it. Indiaonta has been given a real face lift in the past couple of years. New owners are really fixing it up nice. Brand new cabins and the whole nine yards.
