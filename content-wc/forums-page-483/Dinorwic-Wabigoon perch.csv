We're going to Canada in mid June, and whle I wouldn't be opposed to a day trip south to Dinorwic, i'm looking for some info re: the viability of the perch bite there in general, and thoughts re: trying to find them in mid June. Am I too early? Any preferred areas? Baits? Depths I should target? Weed oriented? Rock humps? Thanks for any info you've got and are willing to share."
1310618,Babamel2,2011-05-24 06:52:00,414,"I have fished Dinorwic for years and have had verly limited luck with Perch. However, we usually target Walleye & Pike. It is likely that a person who targets Perch and knows where to go could have a different experience."
1310624,Walley Guide,2011-05-24 07:11:00,67,"Dinorwic has some nice perch. Have found them in the very back of the bays on the weed edges. Never have caught limits of perch, but then again we always fished for walleye. Happy Fishin' Walley"
1310822,Babamel2,2011-05-24 14:40:00,414,"when you are near the weed beds, how are you fishing for the perch?"
1310844,Walley Guide,2011-05-24 15:46:00,67,We pick most of them up on 1/16 oz jigs. I have found we tend to catch more when we are tipping the jig with a chunk of crawler compared to minnows. We will slip an anchor in and toss tipped jigs back in the weeds. Not against using a small cork to work the jigs back in the standing cabbage. Walley
1310978,Robert Cardenas,2011-05-24 23:10:00,138,"Perch fishing is great, last year we caught numerous perch over 13"", our group actually has a perch fry one day. We stay at Bonny Bay Resort during the first week of June. My suggestion to you is to try some of the shallow bays with weeds or even try some of the lakes that are connected to wabigoon, search for the warmest water and I bet you will catch perch, walleye, and gators, and maybe some crappies. We started catching crappies last year. JUST FIND WEEDS and mud, they are feeding on small crayfish and bugs. I have had a lot of luck on minnows. Check out www.bonnybay.com for more pics they have an awesome website and resort and I have to mention the camp dinner is a feast. These pics are from 2008, 2009, 2010."
1311314,bigwalleye1,2011-05-25 19:39:00,2632,"Thank you all for the information! We're trying to do a little exploring this year, but I' m trying to not suffer a lot by not being on Lac Seul for a day. While the backs of warm shallow bays likely will be the target location, and then based on wind direction blowing the surface water, do any of you have any preference of Wabigoon vs Dinorwic? Thanks again."

Fishing just keeps getting better and better on Lake Wabigoon, and Bonny Bay Resort runs a class act operation. Check out there awesome website for more pictures www.bonnybay.com"
1315423,Tony Shirley,2011-06-07 08:53:00,211,"Did u catch any good size walleyes,im goin there never been before"
1319784,Robert Cardenas,2011-06-18 16:09:00,138,"We caught many walleyes in the 20's, we release those, but did take a nice pic of a double we had in the boat with a 24"" and a 22"". There was also a 31"" walleye caught, with multilple large Pike, perch, and crappies. Good luck, the bite is good on Wabigoon!"
