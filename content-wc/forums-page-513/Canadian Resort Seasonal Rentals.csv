I had coffee with him this morning and he mentioned that he might be interested in renting several of his one bedroom cabins by the season, rather than by the week. He wondered if there would be much interest from fishermen in doing seasonal rentals. I mentioned also the possibility of time sharing. I think he might be on to something here. I know that I have had a number of people ask me if I could find them a seasonal rental here in Nestor Falls. There have not been many available. He has three furnished cabins he is thinking of doing this with. I think they might just go pretty fast. He and his wife are great people and they run a quality camp. They just want to ease their time requirements somewhat since they still have a young family. This is a mainland camp, not an island camp. I have been doing this for 10 years here and it's very nice to be able to leave your stuff in the cottage and not have to haul it back and forth from year to year. If you believe this concept might have some merit, let me know what you think. He's serious about this and might do it yet this year, rather than waiting till next year. If you want to share any private thoughts just send me a personal message."

We have a ""time share"" cabin... it seems to work. It's more of a rent in advance deal, as you can't really do time shares. (unless you're actually wanting to sell your resort off)"
1111220,rpieske,2009-06-05 12:48:00,1276,"Well, I know this guy has no intention of selling the property. He's just a young guy with a business back home that is doing well, and needs to ease up on the time requirements of running a weekly rental camp. I can understand that. I'll pass on to him about Pine Island. That might be encouraging to him. I know know I love the arrangement I have here. (But wouldn't mind a little competition for my rental dollars. LOL)"
1240153,mshane,2010-10-04 06:31:00,1,Seasonal rentals is a good idea for owners and renters. It's good that it is now available through the internet. Now it won't be hard to find renters and seasonal rentals by owner at the best rates and appropriate location.seasonal rentals
1240983,alanexpup,2010-10-07 12:31:00,278,HI. MY wife and I are getting ready to retire and have been looking for a month to month summer rental around lake of the woods or lac saul. i have gotten a number of responses to my request. there are a number of places that do that now. whatkind of money are you talking about?
1240985,Moondog,2010-10-07 12:37:00,362,"We have talked to Mary at South Bay on Gull Rock about renting us ""our spot"" on a seasonal basis. So far she has been reluctant. For now we only stay 7 weeks and would consider staying longer if we got a ""deal."" We require no babysitting, boat sitting or hand holding and if she would rent some of her RV spots for the entire season it certainly would reduce the work she has to do with others less independent, if you know what I mean. Anyone else know of seasonal RV spots that have worked out well? IN CANADA, not the states."
1241223,rpieske,2010-10-08 14:20:00,1276,Alanexpup: Send me an email and I'll give the places around LOTW in my area that might work for you. One is on Crow Lake (Kakagi) near Nestor Falls. Another is in Nestor Falls near my cottage. My email address is on the profile.
1241244,Moondog,2010-10-08 17:03:00,362,"Bob, No, we are hooked on Gull Rock. My question was just basically looking to see if there were other places that DO rent to RV'ers seasonally.........so that maybe she could see that others are doing it. For right now we are happy. Just an FYI thing but THANKS!!!!"
1241365,alanexpup,2010-10-09 12:21:00,278,Bob I looked and did not see and email address on your profile. alan
