The first year we did the houseboat adventure fishing the Northwest Bay areas of the lake. We did pretty good catching a large number of Pike and very nice Smallmouth Bass in late June. Last year we fished the far northwest arm of the lake, back by Labelle's fishing not quite as good mostly due to the weather (we think) :-)This year we are trying to decide between two different outfitters, ""Coppen's Resort"" or ""The Fisheries"". Has anyone used either of these two outfitters? Any experiences you have had good or bad would be greatly appreciated.Thanks."
510801,Guest,2001-01-29 19:55:00,0,"""Pathfinder"" just asked this same question a couple of days ago. Go back on the board one page and look at the responses, including mine, to the question, Red Gut, Swell and Seine Bays?If you want any more info about Coppens, just e-mail me and I would be happy to fill you in. We've been going there on and off for 13-14 years. We've really liked it and the people who run the resort are wonderful.Bill"

510803,Guest,2001-01-31 05:59:00,0,Do you have contact information for Coppens Resort?
510804,Guest,2001-01-31 06:10:00,0,Here's their web site: http://www.coppensresort.com/Good luck. Feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions about Coppen's or that part of Rainy.Bill
510805,Guest,2001-02-01 00:06:00,0,"I live at Bear's Pass and either Resort will treat you right. If you are looking for guide fishing Coppen's will be better, more luxury see The Fiheries. Not sure if you know but they are only a five minute boat ride apart. In the channel you have access to Swell or Red Gut bays, great fishing in both. email or call me for more info [email protected] or 1-800-361-2628 in MN."
510806,Guest,2001-02-01 16:26:00,0,Coppens looks like an interesting place. Is it a good place for families? The beach area looks nice. What is fishing like the end of July/early August? Would mainly be looking for smallies/walleyes.Does anyone know if The Fisheries has a website. I searched around and didn't find one. Thanks.
510807,rschaeff,2001-02-02 05:28:00,5,The Fisheries has a web site with pricing information and some pictures. Here's the URL: http://www.thefisheries.comGood Luck. I'll post how we fair later this year. We are planning on being on Rainy Lake 07/07 - 07/14.
