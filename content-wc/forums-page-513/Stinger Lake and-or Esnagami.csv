1241919,Curryale,2010-10-12 09:14:00,50,Thinking of doing a trip on Stinger Lake in the Nakina area next year (August). Just wondering if anyone has fished it and can give me some insight or let me know where I can find a map of the lake.We will likely spend a few days over on Esnagami as well. Any infor would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I've canoed across Stinger Lake to get to Esnagami (where we camped) twice. But because our canoes were so loaded down with gear, food and whatnot, we didn't even cast a line on Stinger. I haven't been on Stinger Lake in 10 or 11 years, so my memory of the lake is fuzzy. But I've fished the area around where the portage trail comes out onto Esnagami, plus numerous other spots on that lake. If you have any specific questions about where to try on Esnagami or what the situation is for camping or portaging or whatever, I'd be happy to answer them as best I can.I would note, however, that I've only been there in June, so what is a great spot in June may not be worth your time in August. Hope I can be of help,- Steve"
