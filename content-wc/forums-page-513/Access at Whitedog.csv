1231277,Slabomania,2010-08-28 15:49:00,51,"I am staying at KCR camp in a couple of weeks fishing for walleye, smallmouth, and maybe crappie. I would appreciate any help you could give me with the area."
1232120,Guest,2010-08-31 16:06:00,0,"When you're travelling down the whitedog highway, when you see the roughrock lodge sign, turn right. Launch alongside the railway tie, that way you wont bottom out. Good luck on Rough Rock, fishing has been pretty crap there the last few times I've been there."
1232187,Slabomania,2010-08-31 20:57:00,51,"If you don't mind paying about $20 you might try going to KCR Landing, which is a few miles North of the White Dog Dam. Although, depending on the water level, it may be one of your toughest boat launches you will experience."
1240435,Guest,2010-10-05 10:33:00,0,Went to KCR for about 20 years. Decided it was time to move on. Just wondering how the fishing is these days? When I quit going the fishing seemed to be on the decline.
561279,kickback,2006-09-21 00:13:00,64,Is there a boat launch for the river at Whitedog?Thanks
561283,dewyg,2006-09-21 07:45:00,1006,"Do not attempt that, there is but it is questionable whether you will be threatened for money or not from the local people to use it. The fee always varies depending on how many people are there with that particular group."
561284,Guest,2006-09-21 08:27:00,0,"I launched there once, those jokers told me I had to pay, I told them to come get it."
561287,River_eye,2006-09-21 09:43:00,1486,"Interesting. There's two launches, one above the dam and one below. I've launched at the one below quite a few times, and the only people I've ever seen were campers. Which launch are you guys talking about?"
561290,Guest,2006-09-21 13:25:00,0,I put in below the dam when I was confronted for money.
561300,dewyg,2006-09-21 16:32:00,1006,Both
561304,River_eye,2006-09-21 17:12:00,1486,"I still see that as being strange. It's really not a launch, just a sand beach, and there are no houses for miles."
561329,Guest,2006-09-22 09:57:00,0,"You can access the river below Whitedog Dam (Winnipeg River) at KCR Landing. It is north about a couple miles. For a small launch fee you can put in there, but you wouldn't be dealing with the Indians who hit you up for tolls a little further north, just Rodger(Drac). I've fished this area many, many times. DON'T waste your time near Whitedog Dam spillway. The major fish populations have the following migration pattern: Cold seasons near Swan Lake and Lower Tetu, Hot seasons near the Caribou Falls Dam up the English River and the Manitoba Boundry Falls area. At least 15 miles down river. I've stayed at KCR Camp which is owned by the brother of the Landings owner. The accomidations and food are excellent and the fishing is great. However, I stopped going because of the b*llsh*t my group delt with for 30+ years from Richard the owner. Gas, boat cleaning and the safety of getting to the dock. If anyone fishes this area I could give you a lot of info on places and things to try."
561330,River_eye,2006-09-22 11:04:00,1486,Why not go below the spillway?
561338,Guest,2006-09-22 15:08:00,0,Diddo on Richard's B.S. he is a royal pain. Gloria his wife is a sweetheart and a darn good cook. The fishing is great the cabins are nice but Richard is a problem.
