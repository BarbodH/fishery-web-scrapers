Did you try both the Canada and Wisconsin phone number? I believe he stays up there in the fall but he has young ones that go back to wisconsin with his wife for school earlier. I would guess you should be able to get a hold of someone at either the summer or winter location. They have always answered or called back immediately when I have had questions. I am assuming you are trying the phone numbers off their website?"

You are close to Moonlight Falls which can produce quality Walleye and Pike but there are many other locations which will require significant travel. If you have a camp boat with a 25hp or 40hp, you will be spending a great deal of time just traveling to a location. Check out Donnellys' camp. Allen and Darrell are great hosts. I have been there approximately 7 times."

I am at the camp now. 1-807-737-2499 www.pickerelarm.com I will be at this phone number for a couple more weeks.
