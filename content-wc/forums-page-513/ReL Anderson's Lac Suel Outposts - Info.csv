My friend wanted to fish Walleye and the Guide focused on Pike. He said the boat didn't have a depth finder which he said should have been a sign that Walleye would not be the target. He is going back but is going to talk to camp managment prior to arrival about getting a Walleye Guide. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1243320,eyeman_1,2010-10-18 18:42:00,690,"Mike, Thanks for the reply. We are looking at the outpost camps on Lac Suel so was wondering if anyone had anything specific about those camps. We stayed at Lac Suel Outposts back in the mid 90s and I wouldn't go back - the owners and the way the camp was operated just was not for us. At the time theh Fishing Hotspots guys were in camp with a group and we were not part of that group, so we got treated like second class citizens. We also had some interesting events happen with staff and the owners. I've been told that the Keckabecka, and other outposts are pretty nice. We just wanted to hear some recommendations from folks that have been there. We've been going to Wiley Point the last several years and the increases in costs have forced us to look elsewhere for tirps to Canada."
1243356,joeman79,2010-10-18 20:01:00,417,I think Mike from Kansas has had some wonderful trips to Black Bay outposts on Lac Seul thru Lac Seul Lodge. Might check it out. Kinda hard to get into sometimes though.
1243370,JDP,2010-10-18 20:54:00,1457,Lac Seul Lodge also has an outpost on Sunlight Lake (part of Lac Seul).http://www.duenorth.net/lacseullodge/outpost.htmlScout Lake Lodge has an outpost on McKenzie Bay (part of Lac Seul).http://www.fishlacseul.com/outpost.htmlSilver Water Wheel on Lac Seul has an outpost as well.http://www.sww-lodge.com/theoutpost.php
1243456,Mike Kansas,2010-10-19 09:31:00,1463,"Eyeman, Been to Lac Seul Outposts and just like you we won't go back. Been fishing outpost camps out of Lac Seul Lodge. The Owner (Dan McDonald) has two outposts and they both have excellent accommadations and fishing. May be tough to book because of heavy repeat business. We have been going to his outpost Black Bear for 25 years and will not miss a year until my legs can't make it. Well worth your time to check with Dan. He bends over backwards for his customers. Probably why he has been a succesful Resort owner for years. Also the best fishing I have ever found in Canada since I started in 1955. Mike Kansas"

Excellent fishing, great cabin and quite remote. On the other hand, Kekabeka is becoming a city. We first camped there when we could camp on crown land and the abandoned cabin was there. They then built a new cabin & used the old one as a cleaning house. Then they built yet another one. We stayed there for the last time when that was done. Now there is apparently a caretaker's cabin as well. We loved that site as it was midway between Skidoo & Scaler & Chamberlain."
