1238733,Rich B,2010-09-27 15:47:00,1081,"Here's the story....I was all set to go on our Fall Canada Fishing trip back up to Cedar Lake (Parrault Falls area) when I ruptured my left quad a week out, and had surgery last Friday here in Ohio - needless to say, I didn't make the trip.....this was our 1st fall trip to Cedar. My twin brother and (5) other good fishermen drove up to Cedar Lake for the week - it's a good walleye, pike, bass and Musky lake that we've fished in the Spring. While the lousy weather they had last week didn't help (windy/rainy with low temps) the fishing was off big time....they caught a few walleye's up to 24"" and a 42"" Musky, though the rest of the eyes were 14 -16"" for the most part, and taken from 40' deep or better. One guy fished for Musky for 40 hours, and caught 1 pike (and had a follow). Was anyone else fishing in this area of Ontario last week, and if so, how did you do ? What were the patterns that took the fish ? The boys fished deep to shallow, early to dark and all day long.....by the end of the week my two Ohio buddies drove back a day early (22 hours straight through)....they did have 3 big fish fry's and a fun week (all in all). Thinking about next year and I'm hearing that everyone is thinking Lake Erie....it ain't got the scenery and remote wild life, etc but it has the eyes. As I reminded my friends, a bad day of not catching fish up in northern country beats a painful day with a torn up leg back home in the states anytime (ha). Rich"
1238766,v-bay gord,2010-09-27 18:21:00,3168,"Rich......from my perspective fishing was poor too. The wind this month has been brutal. My only high point last week was some good lake trout and whitefish opportunities. I'm sure there will be those who had ""fantastic"" fishing......but I think your's might have been the norm."
1238799,tackleman,2010-09-27 21:40:00,444,"I agree with vbay gord, the weather up here has been brutal for fishing for the last 3 weeks with the high winds and the water temp has dropped from 62 degrees on labour day to 52 degrees today. this makes the fishing change and it was tough going, everyone I talked to on the lake in the past 3 days said it was very slow, the fish I caught were in 25 to 30 feet and were really biting light, just sucking on the minnow and working their way up to the hook. takes a lot of patience to wait and wait for them to take the bait."
1238868,Rich B,2010-09-28 08:09:00,1081,"Thanks for the information on other Western Ontario waters for last week....tough, tough fishing conditions and my buds did pull plenty of ""eaters"" for 3 fish fry's, so not all bad (sad to say I've been on worse trips - ha). Rich"
1239454,Kevin R,2010-09-30 06:22:00,305,I tried Cedar in August for a couple days it was ok for Walleye & Bass but no Pike. I spoke with 3 guys fishing for Pike & Musky that also said no pike all week they said one Musky was caught that week in camp. I also spoke with other locals that said Cedar was a waste of time for most of August.The Middle of August started a slow fishing pattern for most lakes in the area. Thought it would have picked up more in the fall. By the end of August I was catching walleye in 35ft.
1240251,Downrigger,2010-10-04 14:50:00,60,"Rich, spent 2 weeks on Lac Suel, 9/4 - 9/17, Ear Falls area. Wind wicked at times, such that we went to Kenora for a couple days. However, when we were able to get out, caught fish, both walleye and northern, many in and over slot on the walleye. Given general directions by resort owners on where to fish. Took a couple days but paid off. Returned to states with our limit of both. Would go back. Phil"
1240323,Rich B,2010-10-04 19:29:00,1081,"I appreciate your note....trying to get the boys not to give up on the northern fishing (nothing wrong with Lake Erie, but it just isn't the same if you know what I mean)....you were just down the road on Lac Suel. Was a tough time to fish....though one of my Ohio buddies told me earlier today that as he looks back on the trip, he did have a good time (even though they left a day early to drive straight back to Ohio). Now just have to figure out where to go north for 2011.....Spring trip....summer trip.....and a fall trip if I can pull it off. Rich"
1240410,wallydave,2010-10-05 08:04:00,2151,"Downrigger, where did you stay when you were fishing near Ear Falls? What parts of the Lac were producing? I have fished the Ear Falls section for several years, the afyernoon winds can make for a rough boat ride, and hard to stay on your spot! Glad you were able to bring home your limit! Less than 8 months until I head back to the Lac!"
1240454,Guest,2010-10-05 11:47:00,0,"Just came back from a week on Lac Seul, 9-25-10 thru 10-01-10, North East Section, and we knocked the socks off the Walleyes. 4 guys, 1510 eyes in 7 days fishing. Water temp was 50 to 52 degrees, most fish were from 21 to 27 feet down. Jig and a minnow. Average size was in the slot or bigger with about a dozen over 25"". Biggest 27.5"". Same week, same resort, same group best week in 15 years. Milfish"
1240632,Larry Mac,2010-10-06 06:28:00,530,"Hi Milfish, WOW what a great trip!!! We were up that way mid September it was cold, very windy and very tough fishing. Our report was similar to many others who were up that way at the same time. I am glad to hear the fall bite has seemed to kick in. Thank you for the report.Thank you,Larry Mac"
