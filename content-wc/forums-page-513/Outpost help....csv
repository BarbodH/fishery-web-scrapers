Was hoping to get some recommendations on outposts (drive in/boat in) that are decently priced. Up until a few years ago we would travel up towards the Ignace area. We will be coming from Milwaukee and are open to anything. Just want to be in a more remote area rather than around other people. Looking mostly to fish for Wallagators and pike. We are looking to keep costs to a minimum due to some of the guys going not having a lot to spend right now so flying is out. There are obviously a lot of choices out there, but want to pick a good one. Since this will be the first of hopefully many years of coming up...."

1244037,wallydave,2010-10-22 07:27:00,2151,"My boat/cabin buddy have always stayed at Goose Bay Camp in the Ear Falls region of Lac Seul. It's a drive-in camp, decent cabins, a great boat upgrade is available. Around $115 to $120 per day covers your cabin, boat, gas and minnows. I'm just a happy camper, who likes to fish out of the Goose! To be fair, another fishen buddy really likes Ghost River Lodge, it's a boat-in with plenty of different lakes available. One day I will give the Ghost a try, most people who have been to the Ghost seem have great reports! Lots of water and camps available, this site and Google will help you find the right spot! Good luck!"

Seemed well care for and located in a good area for fishing. Why did we go there?? Wabby was a waste of $$ and time. Gas dock opened when owner sobered up etc etc Understand there is new & aggressive management now.... Won't mention which place. Old timers can figger it out."
1244247,Downrigger,2010-10-23 12:17:00,60,"If you have 6 to 8 people sharing the expenses, you may want to consider renting a house boat from White Wing Resort, Ear Falls, Ontario, on Lac Suel. The cost is $3600 per week, but with the 8 people that makes it $450 per for the week. The houseboat is 3 bedroom, sleeping up to 8. Has full living room and kitchen. A local guide takes the party out to a remote spot, and comes for a pickup at the end of the week. While we stayed at White Wing in Sept., we stayed in a cabin, but the houseboats were busy. More info. can be had by going to White Wing web site."
