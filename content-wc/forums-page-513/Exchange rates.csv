I also understand that American Express only charges 2 %. A while back I got a flyer from Charles Schwab that stated they will not charge any fees for foriegn transactions."
1242082,Obabikon,2010-10-13 06:13:00,2370,Many places will end up charging you a service fee... (or like me refuse to take credit cards). Due to the fee added onto the owner's end. It's like 3.5%-5% or something in that range.

1238045,81Saluki,2010-09-24 15:04:00,97,"About 10 years ago, I opened an account at the credit union in Vermilion Bay so I could use the debit card to pay for gas, groceries, beer and incidentals and not have to worry about ending the trip with Canadian money in my pocket (which I sometimes forgot to bring back up with me the next trip). The exchange rate was roughly 1.50 at the time. Closed the account a couple of years ago and -- due to interest and the weaker USD -- got almost all my original deposit back!FYI (on 10/9/2010) ... just went through some of my Canada/fishing stuff and found $23.79 in Canadian money which I had forgotten about. Grrrr. Maybe I should have kept that account open longer!"
1238218,TIGHTLINER,2010-09-25 10:31:00,223,I ALSO CAN REMEMBER GETTING 58% RATE .. OH HOW THINGS CHANGE.TRY USING WWW.XE.COM CHANGES ABOUT 6 TIMES DURING THE DAY SO IT IS PRETTY MUCH RIGHT ON.

Try to find anything made here in the usa now. big corparations and our goverment have sold this country down the river for yrs.It will never be the same,the good ol days are gone.As I get very close to retirement I am seriously considering moving to the great north."
1238255,2746,2010-09-25 16:19:00,3206,Wish I had been smart enough to buy some Canadian Dollars just a couple of years ago. The gains would have been paying for my Canada habit today!
1238666,tv4fish,2010-09-27 09:34:00,2694,"Larry I (my group) has had the same thought -- BUT, probably what would happen (if we did do that) -- the Canadian government would then change all of their currency and the bills we bought 10 years ago would not be accepted as legal currency any more and would be completely worthless."
1240257,Downrigger,2010-10-04 15:05:00,60,"On way back from our trip ot Lac Suel, stopped at Border Bobs to convert 175 canadian dollars back to US. I knew the then exchange rate was 1 US to 1.03 Canadian, however my wife didn't and she went in to make the exchange while I gased the car and walked the dog. Border Bobs gave her 84 cents US for each canadian dollar and on top of that charged her an exchange fee. When we got home, I phoned Border Bobs, asking who set their rates - was told Bob did. Be aware!!Always better to go into Canada with Canadian money. Our previous experience has been that each store sets their own exchange rate, and of course in their favor."
1240521,Guest,2010-10-05 16:21:00,0,What most don't take into consideration is the cut the banks take when you as a retailer turn in USD. Usually they take anywhere from 2-4% on top of the rate you see displayed on say MSN.com. I use royalbank.com and research what they give for USD cash exchanged into CDN dollars when I set my exchange rate at my store. Go to rates on the left hand side of their site and select cash rates. This will let you know what they will give for cash. We normally make sure we won't lose money on USD when we go to the bank which is normally once a week....like most resort or store owners in NW Ontario. Hope this helps. (lately one USD is worth .99 CDN when exchanged at a bank in Ontario.)
1237292,deputy dog,2010-09-22 06:41:00,305,"is there a reason you all, coming from the states, dont just get your money exchanged at the border/duty free stores? haven't seen this mentioned yet and wondered why...."
1237313,Freytown,2010-09-22 07:59:00,770,My group has been getting our money exchanged at the border/duty free stores for years. It's fairly easy to estimate the $CDN needed for the trip.I can't blame an outfitter for charging a certain percentage to cover any bank fees he is going to be charged when depositing the $USD. Bring the $CDN with you or be prepared to pay a reasonable exchange fee.
1237347,nitrodude,2010-09-22 10:15:00,60,My thoughts exactly.
1237394,TIGHTLINER,2010-09-22 11:55:00,223,Just to add my couple cents.. The duty free also charges a extra fee the only way to avoid that is go right to a bank itself none are open when we go early. We have found that when we cross at the soo we stop at the casino and get better rate than the duty free. You talk six to eight grand for six or eight guys for a trip and 2 OR 3 cents adds up look at it this way will buy some of your booze or a tank of petro. Just food for thought..
1237416,Guest,2010-09-22 12:32:00,0,What Americans need is a way to earn or get paid in CDN$. Moving to Canada would be one way. Given the number of resorts for sale that are now on the market do you think now would be a good time to buy one? Can a person make one work?
1237422,Kruger,2010-09-22 12:52:00,259,"Back when the exchange rate was a buck and a half, I gave the girl at the beer store a twenty for a six pack and she gave me twenty two back. I seriously considered moving then."
1237456,tv4fish,2010-09-22 14:26:00,2694,AHHH - the good old days -- Although you must have been going up there longer than we have - the best exchange rate I can remember is about 30% (circa 1985).

1237575,Hawgeye,2010-09-22 21:45:00,1355,"As of today, you get .97 for a Canadian dollar when exchanging for a US dollar. I remember back in the 90's (early) it was in the 65% range. times have changed...as a US resident, I am more than happy to give up the 3% worth on my dollar while in Canada to just use my US currency...in Manitoba, I typically have not had any problems not having Canadian currency..."

1236975,walleye88ia,2010-09-20 22:42:00,35,use a visa card. debit or credit. you will not get ripped off this way.
1236993,micropterus,2010-09-21 05:25:00,450,"Most charge 2-4%, check your statement. I have a local bank than gives the current exchange rate. Check around."
1237004,Freytown,2010-09-21 06:26:00,770,For what it's worth. $1 USD = $1.03 CADhttp://www.bank-banque-canada.ca/en/...converter.htmlThe USD has been a tad higher all summer...
1237040,Obabikon,2010-09-21 07:51:00,2370,"Well... no matter what, you won't get the 3%... it probably did cost you between 5-6% though."
1237050,Obabikon,2010-09-21 08:09:00,2370,"oct, I'm sorry you had some problems with that this year, but there's several things in your post that are misleading. You are right in saying that some people take gross advantage of the exchange. That's the reason many places charge in US funds... so that their guests aren't suprised by additional fees. Anyhow, First thing is this... credit card companies charge between 3-5% to the business owner for their usage and exchange rate. So, many camps charge for their use or just do not offer it. Second thing is this... four years ago you weren't getting the right exchange rates at those places. Many still charged a 5% exchanging fee ontop of what they could exchange money for. So... if the exchange was ""75%"", the bank would give you 77-78% (depending on cash or check), the average store was giving you 83%. That's not true for everywhere, but it is a common practice. And, right or wrong... it's been going on for a long time."
1237052,J-Man,2010-09-21 08:11:00,191,"The exchange rates are one of the most misunderstood things we see no matter what the rates are. You just can't look in the USA today and say that is what you should get for you money. It doesn't work that way. Jared is quite right with his example of what rates might be at differing levels. http://www.rbcroyalbank.com/RBC:S5AS...cashrates.htmlThis is the site we use to monitor exchange rates from our bank. It is updated several times a day based on trading. Scroll down to find the US current rates and you will see two different rates. if we take US to the bank and if we want to buy USD from the bank. There is 5-6 percent swing depending on which way you want to go.As of this posting, we would get 1.0022 for every US dollar we give to the bank. That is pretty much par. We are charging 1-2 cents more if people pay in US to hedge against the rate going the wrong way on us before we can get to the bank once a week. If we could make nightly deposits, we'd be happy to give the exact rate we can get. If we wanted to buy US funds to go south for a vacation, it would cost as 1.0559 or nearly 1.06 canadian for a US dollar. Stated exchange rates are only for institutional investors that deal in the millions of dollars worth of transactions. Our rate of 1.02 US = 1.00 is better than 99% of the rates you will get on credit/debit cards because of the 2.5-3% ""foregin exchange fee"" you pay just to do the conversion on top of the bank rate used.Banks make money on exchanging cash. It's a business transaction for them. If you went to the bank with $100 and exchanged it from US to Canadian to US back and forth like that, you would end up with $0 before too long. That being said, anything more than 5 points either way is taking advantage IMHO. There is a place in rainy river charging over 10 points on fishing/hunting licenses. Stay away from those places. One of the best places in the area to exchange money is the grocery store in Emo. They give better rates than most banks. They must have figured out they come out ahead with the average of what someone might spend in the store when they come to do the exchange. A lot of businesses that charge in CDN also keep a float of US paper like we do so you get US paper back when you settle up for your trips. That kind of convenience is worth the 1, 2, 3 points you pay over the bank rate IMHO as well."
1237059,Guest,2010-09-21 08:23:00,0,"We opened an account at a Canadian credit union and receive a decent exchange rate. IMHO the US$ for at least the near term is more susceptible to inflation than is the CDN$, making the US$ less desirable, so little relief on the exchange rate is likely."
1237214,octanehi5,2010-09-21 17:26:00,1104,"I appreciate everyones input, very good things to know, I have opened an account in T D bank,a canadian based bank, so far they have been very good, they pay interest on a reg. checking account,no maintanance fees. when i want to convert US to CAD. It only costs me $7.50 per transaction. If I convert $2000 US to CAN. its $2060 -$7.50 for the transaction. thats the best that I can find anywere. I need to send my outfitter my deposit in nov. and the bank will make out a chech payable to the outfitter in canadian funds for me.I understand that the outfitters get charged to convert our dollars over. This yr we were four guys fishing and we spent enough money in the conversion to buy two full tanks of gas for the two vehicles we drove up and then some."

1236873,2746,2010-09-20 17:33:00,3206,"""our favor"" meaning Canada. It looks like 1.00 Canadian buys 0.97 US which would mean they only took an extra 2 cents.....enough to cover bank charges. (unless I'm reading it backwards )"
1236877,Wall-i-Lama,2010-09-20 18:02:00,1524,"I wonder if the exchange rate is turns around (in favor of US) will they do you the favor and convert so your US dollar would buy 1.03 of Canadian gas? Or would the just call it ""close enough""? What is your experience? How does it work for the rest of you when the US dollar is worth more?"
1236888,Obabikon,2010-09-20 18:26:00,2370,"Nobody ever gives the real exchange rate (including the banks). If the US dollar gets real strong, that means you will be able to buy more things in Canada with your US dollar. Example... Exchange rate is ""Par""... you'll end up getting about 95 cents canadian for $1 US Exchange rate is ""1.05"" (in favor of the US)... you'll end up getting about par Exchange rate is ""1.40"" (in favor of the US)... you'll end up getting about 1.35 canadian for $1 US"

Some of the poeple in canada are taking advantage of the exchange. It just goes to show you that the US dollar is not very strong any more,4 yrs ago we would get the right exchange rates"
