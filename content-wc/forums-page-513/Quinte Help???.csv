1241951,Mark Komo,2010-10-12 12:22:00,867,I think you need an outdoor card for all of ontario. You use the card every year to get your ontario license.
1241964,Uncle Paul,2010-10-12 13:15:00,292,When I bought a license this year they sold me one at the same time and said the card will arrive in the mail.Paul
1241966,keek,2010-10-12 13:53:00,1003,Thanks guys - What was the cost for a 3 day license (if they even have that)? What's the cost of the outdoor card. I went to the site that was mentioned but couldn't find the $$ amount.Thanks
1241967,GMC Jon,2010-10-12 14:04:00,842,"Not sure what a 3 day cost, but we paid roughly $30-35 for a 7 day license last year."
1242001,keek,2010-10-12 16:25:00,1003,Thanks GMC!
1242083,Uncle Paul,2010-10-13 06:20:00,292,I have a non-resident conservation for the year at $46 and the card looks like it was 9.68 do not remember if that was Can. or US. And when I got home it was in the mail bought them Sept. 1st I'll be in Quinte starting the 6th it's a full two weeks earlier than our normal time. Paul

1233224,Kino,2010-09-04 20:57:00,101,Guys I am going to finally get to go to the famed bay of quinte the end of the first week of november. I am looking for a place to stay and some ramps if they are not by the motel. We need nothing fancy as we are just fishing. I am bringing my boat so boat parking is a must. Fish cleaning is not needed but a freezer is as I plan on bringing home one for the wall! Thanks guys!
1233239,FISH HUNTER,2010-09-05 05:18:00,161,"Hey Kino, you'll be up here during a great time of year. Here are a list of a few places to stay that are quite close to very good ramps and great fishing. 1) West Lake Willows Resort- www.westlakewillows.com This place is only about a 10-15 minute drive from the Picton boat launch. Scott is a great guy who runs a top notch operation and is one heck of a fisherman and guide. 2)The Picton Harbour Inn- http://pec.on.ca/pictonharbourinn/ This place is right on the water at Picton Bay and you may be able to keep your boat in the water. This place I would think would fill up quickly so definately check sooner rather than later. 3) Sportsman Motel-613-476-2424 This place is only about 5 minutes from the Picton launch but I'm not sure if it is open year round or not. When it is open it usually fills up quite fast. 4)Millhaven Inn- http://www.realontario.ca/index.php/...isting?pid=875 This place is fairly close to great fishing grounds but far enough away that room availability should be better than some of the others. If all else fails the are lots of motels/hotels in either Napanee or Belleville. You could be to the best fall fishing spots in about a half hour to 45 minutes from either of theses places. Hope this helps and if you need any more info feel free to ask. Also check out www.quintefishing.com for lots of local updates and fishing reports. FISH HUNTER"
1233297,rebs,2010-09-05 13:22:00,7587,I just read some reviews for The Tip of The Bay Hotel and it looks like it is no longer a good choice to stay at.I am going to look into it more and will post laterhttp://www.travelpod.ca/hotel/Tip_of...na-Picton.html
1233320,FISH HUNTER,2010-09-05 15:54:00,161,I'm not 100% positive but I think the Tip of The Bay is slated for demolition to make way for some condo type units. I could be wrong though. I certainly is located in a great spot being steps away from the Picton launch. FISH HUNTER
1233814,Tim Ellis,2010-09-07 15:22:00,745,"If the reviews are correct, and I have no reason to doubt them, I would rather sleep in the back of my Tahoe on an air mattress."
1240069,haybay larry,2010-10-03 15:32:00,136,"As Fishhunter mentioned check out the Quinte Fishing .com web site you can find accomodations for the whole area of the bay of quinte. Also check what lures are working best, and what areas are producing. It should be a good fall season. Right now the fish we are seeing in long reach/adolphus reach would scare you! There are so many but they are mostly lock jawwed....Larry"
1240102,Mark Komo,2010-10-03 18:40:00,867,"Well, if outside appearances are anything, then I would say no. It is really convenient though. Didnt see may trailers or boats out in back. There are a TON of small cottages on the way (rt 32) so, you have plenty of choices. Belleville has some chains that are nice. I have not stayed there. Keep in mind, I stayed at the Tiki off 80 in Illinois many a time and didnt mind it."
1241711,Mark Komo,2010-10-11 11:13:00,867,Just checked the west lake willows website and found it to be very sharp looking place.
1241925,keek,2010-10-12 09:40:00,1003,I've never fished Quinte or Ontario for that matter before but would like to this fall. In searching for info I read about an Outdoor Card that I might need. Is this true for a non-resident? What exactly will I need and what's the total cost?Thanks-
