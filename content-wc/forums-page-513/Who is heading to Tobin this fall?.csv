I will tell you, as high as the water is down here, it crossed my mind to skip the Championship and come up to Tobin. There is no better place for a good time, on the water......off the water is not to bad either.LOL! Good luck this year, maybe we will see you next year. I can't go to many with out hooking one of those 12 pounders!Dave"
