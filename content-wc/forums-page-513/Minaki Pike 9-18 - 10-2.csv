This is the fourth lodge we've stayed at in Canada and as far as service and accommodations go it's definitely the nicest place we've stayed. The only complaint was that their boat ramp needed a little work, we had to put the truck into low 4-wheel to get the boat out of the water because of the soft rock, but other than that the place had really nice cabins and great service. The only other problem with the lodge can be blamed on the fish, because we found our only decent pike fishing a 12 ½ mile boat ride from the lodge. We hired a guide the first day and he showed us lots of spots to fish closer to home, but the only places we had luck finding bigger fish were in the far north parts of Little Sand and Big Sand lakes. And I can't blame it on our lack of experience with the place either, because there were a couple other guys in camp who'd been there many times before. They only fished in and south of Gun Lake and they ended up saying it was their worst trip to the area ever.We were there for 2 weeks and other than a ½ day trip into Kenora we fished hard for 14 days straight. Of those 14 days we did well 3 days, the rest ranged from bad to really bad. On the third day of the trip, in a three hour period I caught my biggest pike ever (43 inches), and my wife caught a 40 and a 36. Then the last 2 days we boated 4 fish between 35 and 37 inches. The 9 days in between were about the worst fishing we'd ever had in 8 trips to Canada, with our daily catch totals ranging between 1 and 5 fish for the 2 of us combined, and at least half of those fish were really small. We never saw a muskie, and probably boated 4 or 5 little smallmouth. We've been fishing at Shoal Lake for the past 5 years at this same time of year, and what really struck me as the difference between our results there vs. Minaki this year was the complete lack of pike we saw between 30 and 33 inches, which we generally caught lots of at Shoal Lake. The number of 35+ fish we caught this year was probably comparable to our average Shoal Lake trip, but the medium sized pike were just not there. Shoal has more restrictions on fishing (no walleye fishing, no live bait) but the slot limit on pike is exactly the same so I don't understand that. The other thing that struck us (that we'd never really thought of before) was that at Shoal Lake the only gas station on the lake is at the Indian reservation and you actually pay the same price for gas for your boat as the Indians pay for their cars which is pretty much the standard gas rate at all the stations around the Kenora area. At Minaki we were treated to something like a 40% marina surcharge which made our long trips to find the fish even more painful!"
1240670,camp chef,2010-10-06 09:21:00,915,Sorry to hear that fishing sucked. We've had some very good fishing there in the past.We've never been on the Winnipeg in the fall though. As much as I enjoy Bignorth Lodge we are are pulling out for 2011 and heading to Pipestone for a change of scenery
1240837,SF-340,2010-10-06 21:07:00,1,"I'm sorry to hear you had a sub par trip. I'd have to say that if you are looking for pike numbers, you would have been far better off fishing south towards Kenora. Areas like the McFarland river and Locke bay will give you the hammer handle action it sounds like you were looking for. North of Minaki you are better off Musky fishing, you will not get pike numbers but the chance for a big musky is there.The owner and his son should have clued you in on that, especially if you were there for two weeks."
1240974,Beagle_Nut,2010-10-07 12:13:00,52,If you call 30-33 inch pike hammer handles then I'd love to fish where you do. What I call hammer handles are the pike around 1 foot to 18 inches long that we did catch this trip and no we had no interest in catching any of more those than we did (few that they were). Thanks for the info.
