Most reports have been that the fishing is slow but what you catch is big. Haven't talked to any of the night time crankers yet so maybe they are doing better.Good luck!"

I was there last week for 3 days before the vanity. a few fish, but thats all. morning bite then nada and the weather was fantastic. lots of zeros on the board at the vanity and thats a first. talked to some trollers, same thing. they only kept trolling because they didn't have any leeches. maybe its a late bite this year, but I'd be surprised. water temp was already down to 52 early last week and there was lots of current. 1.8mph drift."
