1239526,Golden Eagle,2010-09-30 11:29:00,2642,"Reading Bill's book is different each time you run through it because each chapter sidetracks you onto one of your own fishing trips. It's a long read when you do it right.It's especially good if you started out camping on free sites, renting boats for $2 a day and carried/dragged boats from lake to lake. We made trips for under $50 each."
1239862,Bill Krejca,2010-10-02 08:12:00,6107,It's not just the fishing I go there for. See LOW sunrise below. Bill
1239926,jimirjr,2010-10-02 16:51:00,1149,"We were up near Sioux narrows from 15th-24th and only saw about 8 hours of Sun. Fishing was tough in the wind (and rain) and the Eyes were VERY subtle in thier take. AND they were between 26 and 32 feet deep, which made it tough to detect bites. Usually, we get around 400-500 fish over 9 days between 4 of us, this year, maybe 150-175. But we got a few bonus Pike over 36"" and saw two BEAUTIFUL Sunsets. SO, all was not lost.... its wonderful country up there! And I'm from the mountains around Denver... JIMI"
1240768,old fisherman,2010-10-06 17:08:00,545,"We're leaving in the morning for Nestor Falls. Could you give up a little more info regarding crappies by Hay Island? like which side, etc. Thanks from Atkins, Ia."
1240773,J-Man,2010-10-06 17:17:00,191,"south side in the deep holes. you'll likely see more than a few boats there with the nice weather. If there is nobody fishing there on the weekend, probably not worth stopping there and would be better to hit Miles and/or OB. Much longer trip from Nestor Falls though so hopefully Hay works for you."
1240787,Bill Krejca,2010-10-06 17:50:00,6107,"Try the 2 small islands just SE of the southern tip of Hay. I'd start in between the 2, going from 25 -40 feet. There are lots of snags, so be prepared to do some re-rigging. We had best luck with 2"" tubes, red/white, and chartreuse with either red, black, or blue front color, no. 1 or larger hook size. Let us know how you did, good luck! Bill"
1241983,Bill Krejca,2010-10-12 15:00:00,6107,Looks like you made it back from Nestor Falls. How did you do and how was the weather? Bill
1242088,Ia Walihntr,2010-10-13 06:36:00,320,"Bill Maybe this sunrise is the same one you posted. I took the picture Sept 21st from our cabin at Mylie's. turned out that day was the last one of the week that didn't have a ton of wind. Even with the weather as it was, It was still a good trip. The leaves were changing quickly toward the end of the week. Was looking forward to meeting you but our paths didn't cross. Maybe next year. Marv"
1242121,Bill Krejca,2010-10-13 08:51:00,6107,"Marv, That be it! Just maybe 10 minutes sooner for me, as I was east of you! It was a beaut, as were the leaves. Hard to beat the yellow birches when they reflect off the water on a calm morn/evening. We fished the Hay area quite a bit, looked for you, but no luck. Like you say, maybe next year. Have a good one, Bill"
1238861,Bill Krejca,2010-09-28 07:58:00,6107,"7 of us, 2 boats, spent last week at Young's Wilderness Camp, LOW, in Stevens Bay. Weather was a mix of either warm/cool and sunny, or real cool/cold, rainy and very windy from different directions. Sunday was sunny, fished Hay Island and 3 Sisters, did well on crappies and walleyes. Our best luck all week on walleyes was while fishing for crappies. Used no live bait, mostly 2"" tube jigs, color chartreuse and something worked best. Water temp at start of week was around 57*. Most fish there (Hay) taken in 35-40'. Next 2 days was cold, rainy, and very windy. Very difficult to fish area where fish had been. Lots of boat bouncing while fishing, 60"" trolling motor on 20' boat out of the water innumerable times, not real fun. Wed beautiful day, got to Obabikon Lake at 8:00 AM, could only keep 74 crappies, as had some in freezer. Got limit and a few walleyes. The bite almost stopped as we reached our limit, so that worked out well. Got back to camp, ended up with (3) 5 gallon buckets of crappies. Ate well that night. Next 2 days were repeat of Mon, Tues - high wind, cold, rain. Ended up with limit of crappies, 16 walleyes to take home. Water temp last day was around 54*. All in all, a great trip, as they all are, in God's Country. See the electronics section for a report of my new I-Pilot. Bill"
1238878,1700SS,2010-09-28 08:32:00,104,Good to hear you had a good trip Bill. Them tubes do the trick. Maybe see you up there next year. Take care.Brett
1238883,rg,2010-09-28 08:46:00,9,"Bill, Do you guys use slipbobbers when fishing crappies? We are going up there in a couple weeks and hopefully there will still be some crappies biting! Thanks, rg"
1238890,Bill Krejca,2010-09-28 09:12:00,6107,"Nope, although I know some folks who do fish that way, and do OK. Bill"
1239033,Larry Mac,2010-09-28 16:19:00,530,"Hi Bill, Thank you for the wonderful report. The great Panfish fishing Canada has to offer i.e. Crappie and Perch is sometimes overlooked. They are fun to catch, offering a lot of action especially on light tackle and taste heavenly. I have wonderful Jumbo Lake Perch in my freezer from Canada this year ready to cook on Sunday's for the football games. Have a great year.P.S. When you talk about LOW, Obabikon Lake and Stevens Bay I cannot help but to recall the stories in your book ""A North Woods Fisherman's Story"". I have read your book several times and it truly brings a smile to my face. Thank you again for writing it.Sincerely,Larry Mac"
1239037,eyemike,2010-09-28 16:39:00,233,Great report Bill. One more year to add to the memory banks. Mike...
1239067,jazzman,2010-09-28 18:24:00,13,"Hi Bill, I was with a party of three last Mon thru Wed.(Sept 20-22) Fishing for us was pretty much as you described. We fished both Obabicon and HayIsland with the most success at Hay. We limited on crappies, walleyes and enjoyed two great fish dinners. I too have enjoyed reading your book and can relate being I have been coming up here for 35 years. We stay at Allen's Crow Lake Lodge and trailer our boat down to Stevens Bay. We used a basic hook and minnow lindy style presentation. We also found some success with a plain 1/16 oz chartruse fuzzy grub(no minnow). The elbow at Obabicon seemed to be the most popular spot counting 18 boats in there one day. I am hoping to come up again in October."
1239160,Bill Krejca,2010-09-29 07:17:00,6107,"Thanks for the kind words, guys. Yeah, we counted 31 boats at the Elbow on Wed. As soon as the sun went behind the clouds, the bite slowed considerably. The wind is also a contributing factor - as soon as the wind changes, the crappies seem to reposition - a slight breeze seems to be all that it takes. Bill"
1239442,Hawker,2010-09-30 04:15:00,3967,"Excellent report Bill, thank you! Other than time of year, conditions (weather, wind & water) sounded a lot like our week there at Young's Wilderness Camp this past Spring! Crappie were much shallower then though of course! Perry, Carol & Staff all doing well I presume?Haven't seen your book though, guess I'll have to find a copy!! Tight Lines!"
1239466,hawks_rule,2010-09-30 07:25:00,115,"Hawker, I was up at Young's recently, Perry and Carol are doing fine, as are the rest of the hardworking crew. You can find information and how to order Bill's book at his website.http://www.billkrejca.com"
