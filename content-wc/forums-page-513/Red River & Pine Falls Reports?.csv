Two of us sorted through many for a nice limit of 16.5""-21.5"" fish. Lost one 26"" inch fish at the boat. Lots of perch and a few sauger, no drum. They've spread a little gravel on the road down to the launch which should make it better when wet. Talked with a fellow from Iowa who had just arrived and was hoping to fish the Red River but he said the current is so strong at the Miracle Mile, the buoys are almost horizontal. Just keep it on freespool."
1240538,Hawgeye,2010-10-05 17:50:00,1355,"We fished Thursday afternoon, Friday, Saturday and Sunday until noon. Wind was rocking out of the NW prior to our day on Thursday. It was nearly calm on Thursday, pretty windy out of the North on Friday, switched to the South on Saturday and was blowing fairly hard on Sunday morning. We had 4 boats with 3 fisherman per boat. Fishing was slow for Traverse Bay's standards but we still caught some fish. Each day, our largest was between 25"" and 26"" through Saturday and on Sunday we had a 27 1/2"". We caught a fair number of the 18""-22"" fish and a couple ""BIG"" fish were lost between all of us. Jigging seemed to produce larger quantities but pulling ""cranks"" landed all of our bigger fish. Again, a little slow to expected standards but fair. Sunday was overall the most productive day for our group and unfortunately we had to head for home. They were letting out some decent amount water from the dam with some pretty good strong current. Water is between 1' - 2' higher than usual with Treaty Rock under water completely every day, even with South winds. Wish we could make another trip up there as I think it will get only better as the water cools down...water temps were around 59 degrees on Thursday down to around 56 on Sunday....still a little too warm for this time of year. I wish the best of luck to all of you venturing out. Now I'll have to wait for my ice-fishing trip in February...I hope to hear from others about good fishing!! Hawgeye"

1237887,LeeMB,2010-09-24 04:40:00,83,"Pine falls is very good right now. Lots of fish with good size showing up. the Red is slow, very muddy and lots of current"
1238990,Hawgeye,2010-09-28 14:01:00,1355,Any updates? Heading up with 4 boats on Thursday early. Hope to fish the afternoon if the wind cooperates. Anyone been out for Greenbacks recently?
1239091,mrwalleye5,2010-09-28 20:02:00,1922,"I've been out a couple of times and it has been good both times. So far largest has been a 27' but in a week between each outing the fish seemed to be more plentlyful and consistently larger the last time. Wind has been brutal the last few days so getting on the bay was tough. The last time out, did not catch a single drum so that is a good sign. Usually when you quit catching them means the greenbacks have moved in in full strength. W5"
1239107,Hawgeye,2010-09-28 21:20:00,1355,"Weather reports show the winds to be down this weekend. Excited to find some good fishing. I have 12 fisherman total in our group with 4 boats. Ranger Reata, Crestliner and 2 Lunds. We have 6 newcomers this year so I hope they get to enjoy some good fishing. This will be my 21st year coming up in October to Traverse. 97' was by far the most amazing fishing I have ever experienced anywhere in my life. The last couple years have been improving and could be approaching the peak of quality fish again. I don't expect to have another year like 97' but ya never know!! I'll be running an 1800 Pro V IFS white with a Yamaha F150 and T8 Kicker, ND fishing registration... If you are out this weekend, give us a wave!! ""Pun not intended!"""
