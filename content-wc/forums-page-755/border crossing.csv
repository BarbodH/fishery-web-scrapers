548855,Gary_IA,2005-06-06 05:33:00,144,"I assume if your retired navy driver's license is OK in the states, it should be good in Canada. You could check with customs. Search previous threads on this board on many of your questions. Many of the regulars on this board are a great source of information. Trailerguy seems to quite knowledgeable and travels quite often between Ontario and the states. A driver's license alone may not be enough. A certified copy of your birth certificate should be in your possession when you cross. A passport will ""substitute"" for a birth certificate and it will be a photo id as well. Of course you are going to need a valid driver's license to drive. For kids, certified birth certificate and driver's license or permit if they have them (driving and photo id). If too young to drive, have them bring a school photo id if available. Non drivers youth photo ids can often be obtained through state drivers license bureau. Parental written consent, two forms of primary id, etc., to get these. Either next year or 2007 passports will be required. Cost for them or $97 plus cost of photos (can get photos at Walmart and elsewhere). If you expect to go to Canada in the future or do other traveling, you might want to get one. I think it takes 6 or 8 weeks to go through the process. If traveling with your children and wife stays at home, have his or her written notarized permission to travel to and from for a stated period of time. (Also have certified copy of birth certificate and photo id) If traveling with children not your own: Written notarized permission from both parents or guardians for travel to and from place in Canada for the period of time. Also include permission for you to seek emergency health care for the children."
548856,Trailerguy,2005-06-06 05:38:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b] 1) Prescriptions need to be in there original bottle, and in possesion of the person they are perscibed to. 2) I don't know, but it won't be much, if it's for personal use they probably won't bother. 3)There is less trafic at night, it is a good time to cross. 4)Follow 53 to 11 go east to 502, 502 has one rough strech about 22k long. 5)Propane tanks are ok, they've never asked about them, I've taken 2 20lbs at a time. 6)Shouldn't be a problem, they seldom even look at food stuffs.They ask you questions about what you have, like potatoes,ect. 7)Exchange rate varies daily, has been around $1.25, a bank is always the best place to get current rate. 8)Limits vary with the division you are fishing in, most in that area are crappies 15 a day, perch 50 a day. You can pick up a copy of the regulations where you buy a license. 9) Drivers license and certified copy of birth certificate or passport. 10)There's a Safeway store downtown and a Extra Foods store on hwy 17. Safeway issues a discount card but I like the choices at Extra Foods better."
548857,Pooch,2005-06-06 05:54:00,4619,"Only time you have a concern is if you are selected to be inspected. Don't BS the crossing agents. They have a job to do. They are friendly but cut you no slack. 1. As long as it is yours and a normal amount. 2. Don't know. 3. Friday and Saturday can see a substantial backup. Late night shouldn't be as bad. There is a toll crossing the bridge at the mill. Can't miss it. 4. When leaving the border crossing building look for East 11 signs and follow them through downtown Fort Francis then out of town for about twenty minutes to the 502/Dryden signs. 502 can be dangerous especially at night. Monotanous drive if you are tired. Many curves and hills, sometimes rough areas and the constant danger of moose at night. Especially at night! This rode is patrolled. If you have an accident or breakdown, help is a long ways away. No cell coverage except close proximity to Fort Francis and Dryden. 5. Don't know. 6. Only if it looks, smells and smokes like contraband. 7. http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/exchform.htm Liquer stores usually have the best rates as they are government owned. They don't exchange money but you can use big US bills to pay for your order. Just don't get carried away. Credit card everything you can. 8. Get a fishing guidebook at the baits shops and be sure you are in the correct disrtict as each area has some different rules. 9. We have never had to show anything more than a photo ID or drivers license. Kids need notorized permission from BOTH parents, even if they are your kids or grandkids. 10. There is a nice store (Safeway) about ten blocks after the border on your way out of town on 11. Another in Dryden. (Keep going straight at the first stop light about three or five blocks. This will also run into Rt. 17.) Most of the answers to your questions can be found by searching through this forum or contacting the Canadian border crossing by phone or web site. One more thing. UNDERSTAND the fish limits and how to freeze them for identification by conservation officers. Getting caught over your limit can be very costly and ruin a great trip. After all, it is the fishing and not the bringing a cooler full of fish home that makes Canada so great. Have a good trip and watch 502 at night. Pooch"
548861,Guest,2005-06-06 07:55:00,0,Where is the Extra Foods how do you find it?
548863,Trailerguy,2005-06-06 08:00:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Extra Foods is across the road from Wal Mart, and beside Tim Horton's, on the East side of Dryden, on Hwy 17. It is very visable if you drive by."
