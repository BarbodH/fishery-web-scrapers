548827,Guest,2005-06-04 21:31:00,0,"I just got back from Minaki, fishing out of Birch Island Resort with a group of 11. The fishing was good. I caught around 160-180 smallmouth, with one 19.5 inches, two 18 inchers, and four 17 inchers. The largest walleye in the group was 30 inches. Plenty of smaller walleye caught, most not in the 13.8-17.7 inch slot size. The largest pike was 36 inches, which is down from the usual 38-39 inchers we usually catch. The smaller pike were everywhere, and we couldn't keep them off the hook. We prefer not to catch them unless everything else is shut down. I caught crappie up to 13 inches in size on sliders in brush, mostly near beaver dams in 3-4 feet of water. A few 11-12 inch perch were caught. The weather was great. The water temp declined from upper 50's-lower 60's Monday and Tuesday to 53 yesterday. The air temperatures was 70-72 degrees the last 3 days, so perhaps the high winds of Wednesday and Thursday mixed the water up. The group caught around 2500-3000 fish (all species) for the week. All in all a great week. Good fishing to all, Don"

548832,Guest,2005-06-05 06:08:00,0,Don....how deep were the smallmouth and were they spawned out? Thanks
548833,Guest,2005-06-05 06:40:00,0,"Aaron, Most of the smallmouth were 3-5 feet of water. 90% of the fish in the 14-19 inch range had eggs still. Some in the 14-17 inch range did not, but were they males? A few smallmouth were 1-2 feet. There were about 10% that were 6-8 feet of water. The highest water temp in some bays of Big Sand was 66 degrees, but after 2 days of wind, that had come down. On Gunn Lake when I arrived, the water temp was 54.4 degrees on the main lake and 57 in bays. This came down to 53 degrees 2 days ago. There were some times of the day when mostly what we caught were 11-13 inch males, then the bigger females would start hitting. My best afternoon, I caught three 17 inchers, two 18 inchers and one 19.5 incher. That 19.5 incher was loaded with eggs, and looked to be pushing 4.5 - 5 pounds. Good luck, Don"
548839,Guest,2005-06-05 10:47:00,0,"From Sweept on fishing reports forum. Don, would you mind sharing what you where using to catch the perch and walleyes on. My son and I will be fishing Minaki starting the 18th. It will be our first time. Can hardly wait!!!! Sweept, I used sauger jigs with treble trailers for deep walleye and sauger. These are 1.25 ounces, and sold locally here in TN and KY. Put a minnow (use 1/8 inch piece of plastic grub to keep minnow on hook) or 3-4 inch soft plastic curly tail grub on the main hook, and bounce the bottom. Let the treble trailer trail out beside the bait. You can drag 3 ounce bottom bouncers, or 2 ounce sinker with 3 way swivels with a minnow or worm harness. I use 7 inch Power Worms by Berkley on night crawler harnesses, back trolling in 20-45 feet of water. Read this: http://www.justfishontario.com/botto...ing_a_to_z.htm Perch will be caught on minnows or 2-3 inch curly tail grubs on 1/16-1/8 ounche jigs or on harness presentations. You can also cast Brewer 1/8 ounce crappie slider heads (Bass Pro or Cabelas) with the slider soft plastic bodies or use 2 inch Berkley walleye Power Grubs in white and perhaps chartreuse, shallow. I caught crappie, pike (up to 32 inches), smallmouth, jumbo perch, and walleye fishing 1-6 feet of water with this light weight presentation on 6 pound stren hi-vis gold with a barrel swivel and 12-14 inch leader of 14 LB stren fluorocarbon to decrease pike bite offs. Try Lost Lake near the bridge, and any bays or weedy areas. Hope you and your son have a great time, Don I have the same Minaki report post on Canada forum on this board that if you have further questions, you can post on."
548841,Guest,2005-06-05 11:25:00,0,"Hey Don, what was the water level like this year? We're going to Minaki in 2 1/2 weeks and I was curious. It seems that the weed growth has been poor over the past couple of years, due to higher water levels on the river. We like to work the banks for smallies, northern and musky, and outside weedlines for walleye; so we're always looking for some decent weed growth. Chuck"
548842,Guest,2005-06-05 12:07:00,0,"Don we are heading up the 18th of June. We heard the limits on walleye is 2. Can you tell what the limits are on Northern? Thanks, Caleb"
548843,Guest,2005-06-05 12:11:00,0,Caleb.........2 on conservation and 4 on regular. You can't keep pike between 27.5 and 35.4 inches...allowed one over 90cm.
548846,Guest,2005-06-05 13:43:00,0,"Chuck, The water was about 6 inches over normal a week ago, but rose another 8 or so inches Thursday to Friday. Weed growth was normal. Check here for water levels: http://www.lwcb.ca/noticeboard.html Good luck, Don"
548851,Guest,2005-06-05 20:52:00,0,Don thanks for the info. this board has been a great help. Can hardly wait for the 18th.
