The weather was warm with highs in the 80's for three days and acouple of cloudy days ,no rain. We mostly target walleyes but also cast for northerns. The walleye fishing was great with lots of fish in or above the slot. ( 18 to 24 in.). Although our largest fish was ""only 27 in."",we caught about twenty 24 to 27 in. fish. There were also more incidential pike while walleye fishing, there was a dozen times when a ""gator"" would nail a hooked walleye. Our largest boated northern was around 34"" with bigger ones seen or on but not in. We fished with mostly jigs and minnows , having the best luck in 12 to 15 ft. of water. Crankbaits cast toward sand bars or rocks also produced some fish of both species. The water was just a little high but expected to come up a little more This was my sixth trip here and have never been disappointed, don't get me wrong its not all fish all the time. But if you can get on them the fishing is unbelievable.During a 2 and a half hour session of counting all fish put in the boat we ended up with 77 walleye and 5 northern and had to get more minnows. Remember practice catch and release."
