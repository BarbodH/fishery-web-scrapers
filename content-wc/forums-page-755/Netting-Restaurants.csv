I explained the native netting problem in Canada and how the lakes are getting depleted. The chef was interested. I have a meeting next week with the chef to explain why his restaurant should stop buying netted walleye from Canada. This could be a start in educating commercial consumers about why they should not buy netted walleye from Canada. Please forward comments, evidence, etc., I can use in my meeting. I already have the pics of the abandoned nets on LOTW. Thanks for your help."
