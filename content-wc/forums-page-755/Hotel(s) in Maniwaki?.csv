548675,Guest,2005-06-01 11:16:00,0,there are numerous hotels. we typically stay at the alonguin since we know the owner. if your planning on staying over on a a friday night you best call well in advance. half of them are booked for the spring season already. if you need numbers let me know and i'll try and find some.
548721,Guest,2005-06-02 08:54:00,0,Thanks Bruce. I definitely could use a couple of numbers. How much per night at the Algonquin?
548749,Guest,2005-06-02 14:38:00,0,"1) 1-819-449-7022 2) 1-819-449-6868 3) 1-819-449-4848 i think algonquin is $104 canadian, but honestly i'm not sure. these numbers are not for algonquin however, just other motels that were referred to by the algonquin."
