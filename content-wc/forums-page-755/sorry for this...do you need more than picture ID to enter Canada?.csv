548754,Guest,2005-06-02 18:23:00,0,"I've followed the many posts and discussions over the years on entering Canada with issues like old DUIs or potatos or worms or being a serial killer or being a serial killer WITH potatos and worms... Has anybody found US folk need more than picture ID to enter Canada (like a passport and/or birth certificate)??? Sorry for a non-fishing post. Next one will be about fire line or soft bait grubs, etc. Thank you and tell me some depressing horror stories..."

548760,Guest,2005-06-02 20:24:00,0,Thanks TG. I'm good on all the documents but some in my group (7 others) need to upgrade more than their tackle. Thanks
548797,Guest,2005-06-03 22:07:00,0,what will it take to get my 10 yo son across the border??? Thanks in advance.
548798,Guest,2005-06-03 22:36:00,0,A car and some fuel.
548804,Trailerguy,2005-06-04 06:10:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Your son should have a certified birth certificate and a noterized letter of consent from any parent that is not present. Customs is very vigilant in preventing child abduction, so he likely will be taken aside and questioned by them."
548806,Gary_IA,2005-06-04 06:34:00,144,"Trailerguy is right about passport or certified birth certificate and notarized letter from parent that is not on trip. If the child does not have a driver's license or driver's permit with photo id, a school photo id is helpful. If there is no school id, you could could problably get one from the state driver's license bureau. For such an id in Iowa the parents need to give written consent for children under a certain age (16 or 18?) and a couple of primary forms of id: social security number and certified birth certificate. There are other requirements for such an id, check the Iowa Department of Motor Vehicle website and follow the links. You might ask, why bother? If you have the school id, why not. An id from the state is more of a hassle but can be done. A photo id for a child too makes the job of the border officials easier and gives the travelers an extra degree of certainity in crossing without undue hassle. I recall an earlier post on this board or the General Discussion Board, a fisherman had his stepson with him and had the certified birth certificate and notarized letter from his wife but no photo id. The fisherman and stepson were finally able to cross but only after the boy was extensively questioned out of his presence. The fisherman indicated the abscence of a photo id was a contributing factor to the questioning. It is my belief to be as well prepared as possable that includes: birth certificate or passport; a photo id (passport will include photo; notarized letter from parent(s) or guardian(s) granting permission to travel to and from so and so lodge for the period of __________ to __________. I suggest that the parents include language in the letter authorizing the adult(s)travelling with the child to seek emergency medical care for the child."
