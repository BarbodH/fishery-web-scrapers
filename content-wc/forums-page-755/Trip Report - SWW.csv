Weather was generally good - combination of overcast and sunny with air temps in the 60's and 70's most days. Water temp was high 50's to low 60's depending on time of day. Overall walleye fishing was strong. Our group of 6 boated a lot of slot size and above with the biggest eye going 27.75"" - no masters this trip! Most fish were caught shallow on jig and minnow combinations. Probably would have stood a better chance for a master if we'd spent more time in the deep but we like the fast pace action. Exceptionally strong was the smallie fishing. A couple guys spent an afternoon or two chasing these guys and had great success with several in the 15 - 18"" category and a handful going 19"" and 20"" Best of luck to all going north this year as we look forward and anticipate our trip in 2006."
