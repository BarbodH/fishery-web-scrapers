548725,tjsker,2005-06-02 09:45:00,301,Anybody bring a child (12 yrs old) that is not a member of your family across the border? Would you need anything other than a birth certificate and letter of permission from his parents?
548731,Frankm,2005-06-02 10:25:00,154,A letter from the parents to authorize you to make decisions reguarding any medical treatment needed. It's not required but something you should bring in case of emergency.
548735,Fred_G,2005-06-02 11:18:00,908,And don't forget to have the parents signatures notarized. otherwise you're carrying worthless paper (This was explained to me by a US border agent).
548740,Gary_IA,2005-06-02 12:17:00,144,"Yes to signed notarized permission from parents or guardians and certified copy of birth certificate. A photo identification for the child would be nice. Some schools have such a card or your state's drivers' license bureau has a procedure for non driver photo identification. Do a google search. I recall that in Iowa the parents have to consent in writing to the photo id, that you need a couple sources of primary id, social security # being one. Sorry, I cann't recall all that is needed. A passport costs about $97 plus the cost of passport photos (you can get them at a Walmart) covers both the photo id and birth certificate. You would still need signed notarized letter from parents though. I think a passport will be required in 2006 or 2007."
