548742,Guest,2005-06-02 13:38:00,0,"We'll be at Onaway Lodge, cabin #3. Right up from the dock. This is our thirteenth straight year there. Never had a bad year. More rain than usual the last four years. Hoping for better weather this year, but it doesn't look good so far. Ron"

548751,Guest,2005-06-02 14:57:00,0,I'd rather fish rising water levels than decreasing water levels any day. Does anyone know if the water levels up there are higher or lower than they were this time last year?
548774,Guest,2005-06-03 10:50:00,0,"The are very close to what they were at this time last year,"
548786,Guest,2005-06-03 15:04:00,0,There are two Lac Seul reports going at the same time. Please pay attention and lets have only one at a time!!!!!!!
