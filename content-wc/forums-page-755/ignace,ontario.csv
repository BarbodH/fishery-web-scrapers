546113,dangrande,2005-03-07 12:30:00,1,hey guys anyone out there that has any info on fishing a lake called arathusa;;;air-a thoosa..might also be called smooth rock or something.want to go there and fish this summer and try for trout and walleye.....thank you
546114,Fish_on,2005-03-07 12:48:00,1856,Yes I have fished it for walleye. It is a good lake with good numbers typical of wilderness lakes that do not get a lot of pressure. The road in to it is ROUGH.
546116,Guest,2005-03-07 14:46:00,0,"Arathoosa, ""Flat Rock"" to some, gets quite a bit of fishing pressure. A lot of people know about it and it also gets local pressure. There is a cabin on it which is rented by the week for the summer and there are lots of campsites from drive-in people as well. But, even after all that, it can be decent fishing."
546124,Guest,2005-03-07 20:28:00,0,"Fished Arathusa (not sure of the spelling) for quite few years and my brother inlaw still fishes there each June and has decent luck with Walleyes. They troll flats with slip rigs and floaters with leeches. When you leave the landing and go to the SW end of the lake you will go through a narrow with a rock wall on the west side is a good place for Walleye, after the narrows you go into a shallow bay that is good late May early June for eyes. If you go west out of that last bay there is a creek that you can get a boat through that takes you into Flat Rock Lake that has Lake Trout and Walleyes. When you go into Flat Rock go left or south and fish the creek inlets along the east shore for eyes is good. I wouldn't call either of these lakes good trophy size Walleye lakes like they were 25 years ago but they are good eater size fisheries. The road there is not to bad anymore but will get old if you travel back to Ignace everyday after fishing, about 1/2 to 45 minute drive unless you go fast and beat up your equipment, its' gravel road and your boat will be filled with dust if you don't put your cover on. I would recommend camping at the lake there are some places to camp just off the road next to a nice sand beach to park your boat. Aruthusa is a nice lake to fish with not too much open water so wind doesn't bother you much and not may rocks to hit. For lake trout I would go to Victoria which is south back towards Ignace. Good #s of lake trout there although watch for rocks here along the north shore near the island I hit one. Also Kakukas is supposed to be the best lake in the area but is hard to get into. Fished Indian which is anther rock hazard lake but has a nice resort on it. Anyway have a good trip and post again if you have more questions. Bruce"

546163,Guest,2005-03-09 08:04:00,0,hey guys ! thanks for the info !have fished arathusa 2 x and really enjoyed it .did lots of trolling on the big flat everyone seems to pound the crap out of. happened to get a few stray lake trout and was wondering if theres any way to get them .how deep ? down riggers? im just trying to get to know it better.......... did most of my trooling with big rapalas and did real well with super shad raps. kakukus sounds very interesting too .where is the landing ?is that it right down the road towards town on the other side of the road?
546185,Guest,2005-03-10 05:42:00,0,"I'm not sure exactly where it is,they call it the north landing.we use Flayer's boats, and we never have to go that far.Even when we fish we seldom have to go far to find walleye's.We stay on the south end of the lake unless someone wants to go sightseeing. let me know if you need more info. T-bird"

I have been up to Ignace for the past 5 years. Members of my group have been going for 20+ years. We usually hit Arethusa, Flat Rock, Kukukus (2 days - Both North and South ends), Barrel, and Heathwall. Most of the fish on Arethusa are great eaters (under 18""). As for Lake Trout, hit Indian and Victoria. By the way, if anyone has any tips for Indian, I would appreciate it. We haven't made it to Indian much. Tried Little Indian last year, but the wind and sleet blew us off early."
