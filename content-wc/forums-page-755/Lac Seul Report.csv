548819,FIB,2005-06-04 14:23:00,23,"Just got back this AM myself. Waters is up. Water temp was up. Ran into a warm front mid week with almost no wind, made things a bit tougher than normal. The big Walleye were scattered. One here one there but not schooled up. Two things I considered abnormal for the week I go: The weeds were already growing in the bays and the bugs were brutal. I really believe that weather means more than anything."
548820,wooglin,2005-06-04 16:01:00,371,"FIB, where abouts were you? The past two years, we have had no issues with bugs.... Guys - (both of you above) Good to hear you guys got your fish on!"

548835,Guest,2005-06-05 08:41:00,0,"Where were you? If you post a report, please also post where you fished out of? Spanks."
548859,FIB,2005-06-06 07:02:00,23,"NE Quad of LS - spend aboout half in Wapesi and half north of Birch Narrows. Off a houseboat. Trust me on the bugs, I am carrying a stick of afterbite in my pocket as I type. Very early mosquito hatch this year. If you are going soon, best of luck!"
548771,wooglin,2005-06-03 10:01:00,371,"Post your e-mail addy and I will send you a makeshift map I have created with some spots circled. Which campsite you staying at, Country Camping? We arrive the day you leave.....make sure you post how you do!"
548773,Guest,2005-06-03 10:47:00,0,"We were there for the opener and caught a ton of fish the biggest this year was a 29.9"" walleye and a much of 20 - 26"" wallaye with contless under 18"". They wasnt hard to find at all. Fish the wind blown rocky points and troll the sandy flats. In the last six years this was almost the best year"
548776,Hump,2005-06-03 11:56:00,578,I will be in the nw section in 22 days. Any advise is appreciated.
548777,wooglin,2005-06-03 12:01:00,371,What part of the lake were you fishing?
548800,Guest,2005-06-03 22:46:00,0,"Woogling, can you email anything you have that would get us in the right direction from either hidden lake or decpetion bay? stop in for a beer if you are in town the week of the 15th. my place is right up the road(664) from the old Big V lodge on the way to lost lake. thanks in advance[email protected]"
548810,Guest,2005-06-04 07:34:00,0,"Wooglin: We also stay at Country Camping. Coming up with a group from Minocqua, WI. We will definetly post how we do the week of June 17-24. My email address is [email protected]. Please send a ""makeshift map"" with some spots at your convenience. Thanks for the help."
548812,wooglin,2005-06-04 08:16:00,371,"I sent the map to both of you guys! Nothing special, but it'll give you an idea of where I am talking about. Good luck and be sure to post your results!"
548814,Guest,2005-06-04 09:15:00,0,"Wooglin: Thanks for the info. I'm at my office computer now but will look at map when I get home. Also, on page 10 of this forum I posted a respnse to your directions for the deception landing. Take a look. Best fishing is about 30 minutes north in Sen Bay. Have been going to Lac Seul for four years now and I'm not sure if it is any better up there than the Lost Lake area we ""ang out""on. Seems you can catch fish almost anywhere if you have some basic smarts. Good luck!"
548815,Guest,2005-06-04 09:57:00,0,"Will do, real time from the couch in front of my woodburner up there. give me a call at the cabin late in the evening that week to keep touch on how things are going or lets hook up for a beer at knobbys one night. 807 582 3856"
548816,gus,2005-06-04 10:48:00,17,"just got back this morning. The water was up, the weather was great fishing wasn't too bad, but we've had better years. The fish patterns were alot different than the last 8 years. fish were in 16' to 20' of water and suspended from 6' to 12' it was slow bite and we give them every thing from cranks to jigs to bottom bouncers w/crawlers. They must have had a good hatch last year we caught more ""dinks"" than past years. Although 9 of us managed to catch 483 ""eyes"" we had to fish fairly hard this year. Over all it was a great trip. For the spawn being early this year the fish were still skinny the water temp was about 60 to 65 deg. all week normaly about 50 to 55 that week."
548370,Guest,2005-05-25 16:09:00,0,"I keep checking the SWWL website for a report, but nothing yet this year. I wonder if they will be doing one this year? Does anyone have any reports yet from Lac Seul? Leaving in 8 days and was kinda wondering how the year is shaping up."
548457,Guest,2005-05-27 05:49:00,0,I myself will be up there that week. The report is that the water is still cold and it's raining now & the next few days however it looks to be nicer the week were going. The water levels also up a couple of feet form last year(exceptionally low the last 2 yrs.) Maybe our paths will cross up there? This will be my 7th trip there the last 10yrs. where is youre camp located?
548458,wooglin,2005-05-27 06:01:00,371,Water up again? I was there two years ago and last year. The difference was up about 6 feet from two years ago to last year. Can we expect it to be even higher this year?
548459,Guest,2005-05-27 06:16:00,0,"Just came back and the one word I can say is YUK! worst year we ever had in 20 years. We couldn't figure out any pattern. They weren't in the current or in any shallow bay's. we graphed them off of points or drop off's in as much as 28' but couldn't get them to bite. The only thing we could figure is they are either still recooperating or the fact we had so much rain that they were turned off. By the way, the lake is rising fast so look out for floating logs! bring an extra prop alway's!"
548461,wooglin,2005-05-27 06:36:00,371,jabs - whereabout's were you? How about temps and weather? I am assuming it was cold/rainy?
548465,Guest,2005-05-27 07:08:00,0,"Wooglin, what week are you going up there? Last year was a phenominal crankbait bite for us...had to work to catch them under slot- lots of big fish. Caught hardly any norherns on cranks mostly real nice walleyes but every year seems a bit different."
548468,wooglin,2005-05-27 07:33:00,371,"We will be five days on the water (June 25-29) and we camp near Hudson, west of Sioux Lookout. We normally fish the Lost Lake area and over east to Deception Bay - but, with more launch sites pending, we may try to get further into Deception Bay and maybe Sen Bay too. Heck, we may try a day on Minittaki too??! Two years ago, we nailed them on worm harnesses. Last year, that did not work, and jigging worked the best. Both years, we did 'alright' with trolling crank baits. Most of the walleye we caught on crankbaits were generally over the slotters though. When we wanted to target northern, we trolled crankbaits."
548473,Winnie,2005-05-27 12:22:00,375,How did you present the cranks? Cast them or troll them?
548475,wooglin,2005-05-27 12:25:00,371,Mainly trolling. I did cast them from shore into weeds when the crew was getting ready for a shore lunch - nailed a few small pike - fun though!
548770,Guest,2005-06-03 09:46:00,0,"Wooglin: Will be in Lost Lake and Deception Bay area June 17-24. We also stay near Hudson at small campground. Any info. on water depths, bays, or other spots where we can catch walleyes would be greatly appreciated. Anybody have latest water temps. in this southeast section?"
