Large flats, rocky points, jagged shorelines are good targets on windy afternoons. Weedless spoons in the windswept weeds can produce some big surprises. Ditto on Clatouche. Don't let the rocks scare you off. Travel with care and you'll be fine. Really big ones prowl almost anywhere but underwater rocky shoals and around the small islands have produced some awfully big fish. This year (we're going up the first week in July)we'll be dead sticking with circle hooks (and a big landing net.) Good luck. We await your report."
548769,Guest,2005-06-03 09:46:00,0,"jbdogfish, by ""the road"" do you mean the last 12 miles of his ""driveway"" or the entire clova road and ""driveway""? i hope he/you mean the whole stretch........or were in for a long haul towing boats. yikes!!!!!!!"
548780,JBfishdog,2005-06-03 13:53:00,9,"The Whole ride in took him 1:45, Russell said that it would take us about 2:20 or 8 Blues and 10 ""REST"" stops. I hope you guys can give a quick lesson on how to Catch the lake trout, I saw the pictures when Ted owned the place but I never caught one ,although We saw a guy and his teenage daughter get towed around in front of the cabin for a while and assumed it must have been a Trout. They never got it in but it was interesting to watch. John"
548794,Guest,2005-06-03 20:41:00,0,Were up 18-25 cant wait incredible hunting and fishing for a week no wife/kids!

548557,Guest,2005-05-31 05:32:00,0,I am curious as to the early season state of the Clova Road and any fishing reports from O'Sully.
548571,Guest,2005-05-31 09:18:00,0,"i'll second the inquiry!!!!! any info, road or fishing is appreciated!"

548632,Guest,2005-05-31 19:48:00,0,"Syracuse: I asked the same question last year and some comic said there is a ""new Walmart"" half way to the Lodge...I suspect the condition is as it always is---exciting on the way in and a little depressing coming out with some ruts and beaver dam damage both ways. I say pray for rain (less dust) but not too much (washouts) When are you heading up? We're up June 8th to the 18th. Hope to see you. Andy"
548644,Guest,2005-06-01 05:13:00,0,"Yeah, I suspect that it is how you described, but I am always hopeful for some change in the road condition for the better. I have a 4x4 Toyota Tacoma. Each year I get very excited abou the trip up there, but I always reflect on what type of damage the Clova does on the truck. We are heading up June 25."
548685,Guest,2005-06-01 13:02:00,0,Never been there looking forward to trip 18-25. Heard alot about fishing hows the bear hunting? If its half as good Id be fine with that
548692,JBfishdog,2005-06-01 18:25:00,9,"To all: I called Russell last night to tell him I lost one in my group. It just so happened that he had just driven in. He said ""The Road"" was in bad shape do the frequent rains they have been having. It took him 1:45 to get down ""The Road"". On another note he said then fish has been excellent, I hope it lasts I have 10 days till I go in. I dread ""The Road"" my spine compresses 2 inches and my Kidney feel like I went 10 rounds. The only thing that gets me through it is a cooler of BLUE . : ) See ya there. ""Don't Keep the Breeders"" John"
548694,Guest,2005-06-01 20:00:00,0,"Ed: the bear hunting is great based on '03 when we were in second week of June all 6 hunters got bear. Last year there were no bear hunters there during our week That #### road--but we have time for them to grade it and make it better, so much can change in two weeks. Nice to hear about the fishing too. We head in on 6/9--with our Buds--the Blue works well too and it helps the kidneys keep strong. Have a good time everyone--I know we will! Andy"
548758,Guest,2005-06-02 19:35:00,0,"Any tips for fishing Osullivan? Drifting ,jigging, Bait?"
548761,Guest,2005-06-02 20:32:00,0,"All of the above. White and pink or pink or white jigs, chartreuse some days work well. follow the wind and work the islands and points. We always go in mid June and the walleye are in 8 to 12 feet usually. Lindy Rigs do well as do Rapala type stick baits (not jointed) Pike are pike and they kill all the usual stuff. Go up to Armentier (it is guided and costs 80 per person but for Pike it is worth it) and that lake is great pike. O'Sullivan (the big lake) works fine for Pike too but even Clatouche is great for Pike (watch your propellor--many hazards) We dead stick with smelt or if lucky, whitefish we can catch for trout on points where we use two anchors and cast out deep with, this year, circle hooks. We have trolled for trout too using clip weights but if you have a downrigger then go for it. We troll a lot with stick baits, lindy's, even jigs (slow) for eye. Hope this helps. e are up June 8 to 18, when are you there?"
