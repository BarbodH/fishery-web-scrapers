First, the company either went under or was absorbed, 2nd, it was a product bases on citronella/camphor and was not offensive to the body or perhaps fish. We used to buy it at the Wabagoon store Is this product available under another name or what works?? Leaving soon, help! TLY"

For me, the stuff just works. I've heard that taking a daily dose of vitamin B1 is a more ""healthy"" approach, and I'm going to give it a try this season. However, I have no idea if it works, and frankly am skeptical (already have the 100% DEET packed). My only other experiment with ""natural"" mosquito repellents was a disaster. I'm not familiar with the product you mentioned."
548807,Guest,2005-06-04 06:59:00,0,3m makes a product for the military and it's sold in the US under the name of Ultrathon...comes in a spray and cream. Works good on everything.....the cream is better for black flies. You can buy it at Meijer and Wallmart as well as other places. Comes in a yellow can.

548811,north_alabama,2005-06-04 07:47:00,172,Thanks. Good thing I got the DEET!
548826,rebelrn2001,2005-06-04 21:21:00,1563,"I remember reading somewhere that anything over (I'm kind of guessing here on the numbers but I should be pretty close) 10% DEET is overkill, no more effective to go more. Another thing I remember reading and I just kind of verified this today at work, is DEET is VERY SAFE. You can put that one a 7 month old kid w/o concern (but it is only recommended once per day)."
