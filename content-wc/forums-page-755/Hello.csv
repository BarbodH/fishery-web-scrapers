548765,Guest,2005-06-03 06:31:00,0,Where exactly is that bay if you don't mind me asking? I know of a launch onto Big Vermillion going towards Hudson on the south side of the HWY. Is it anywhere near there? Thx
548744,Guest,2005-06-02 13:44:00,0,Can I post here without a registered username?
548745,Guest,2005-06-02 13:45:00,0,I guess so. Can any of you tell me if there are perch in the Sioux Lookout area? We will be there in late June and want to target perch on top of walleye! Thx
548746,Guest,2005-06-02 13:48:00,0,Yes there are.
548747,Guest,2005-06-02 13:52:00,0,"Great - thanks! What kind of tactics do you recommend? Just try to locate them with a fish finder, jig minnows/crawlers?"
548748,Catman59,2005-06-02 14:02:00,345,My experience is that the Perch is the bottom of the food chain around there ....so a 12 incher is a trophy !!!!!! Always caught ours during Walleye fishing with normal Walleye tchniques.
548750,Guest,2005-06-02 14:55:00,0,Jake....a simple worm/slip bobber setup works good. If you find walleye go shallower in the same area and you should hook into the perch.....good eating no doubt.
548753,Guest,2005-06-02 15:56:00,0,"Good thinking, I guess walleye eat perch, so if walleye are around, the perch can't be far. And, I agree 100% with perch, they are some tastey fish!"
548757,Guest,2005-06-02 19:23:00,0,"back of shallow bays, less than 30ft deep sloping up gradually. i have done better on them when there are thicker weeds present. I have done well on big v and minataki. slip bobber, worms, small jigs, bee moths. 7 to 15 feet on the bottom usually."
548759,Guest,2005-06-02 19:51:00,0,"Big V, eh? I didn't think Perch would be in that clear water lake??!!"
548764,Guest,2005-06-02 22:37:00,0,"deep too. at the back of the bay that my cabin is on is an island where the water comes up from 30ft to around 8 or 9 and from late june until fall kicks in, they guys kill the perch on it especially if the cabbage is up. i have also caught them out on the main lake in shallow bays while fishing for smallies. same on minataki and abram/pelican for that manner. just not in same quantitiy. good luck"
