548389,Guest,2005-05-25 23:38:00,0,I have been fishing out of the Sioux Lookout area for about 15 years and only hit Lac Seul twice. Once we went out of Hidden or Lost lake in hudson and did ok. the other was out of deception bay and ran about 40 minutes up the lake. we hit more walleyes in the 5 to 10lb range than we had minnows to use. also hit a rock with the prop. any advice on what the best places to fish for June eyes out of either of those areas and stay metal safe?

We fish the same places, out of Lost Lake (Hudson) and are always looking for new launches to fish from. Thanks!"
548394,Guest,2005-05-26 06:47:00,0,"Deception Bay is east of Sioux Lookout, 10 to 15 minutes."
548395,wooglin,2005-05-26 06:55:00,371,"Right, is the launch site marked on the HWY out of Sioux Lookout? We usually boat up that way, but if there is a launch up there, we'll just start there."
548409,Jimmy Jig,2005-05-26 09:02:00,1905,It about 8 to 10 miles North of Sioux Lookout and there is a sign on the highway.
548410,wooglin,2005-05-26 09:05:00,371,"Would that be off of HWY 516, which appears to run right by Deception Bay? http://crownlanduseatlas.mnr.gov.on....fs/_920500.pdf"
548428,srj,2005-05-26 13:16:00,971,"Just as you get to town with Pelican Lake on the west side of the road, take a right----there is a bar and hotel on the east side. Stay on that road. It will take you around Sioux Lookout saving some time. The Deception landing is marked along the highway."
548813,Guest,2005-06-04 09:07:00,0,"Wooglin: Highway 615 northeast out of Sioux Lookout will get you to the Deception landing. About 8 miles or so on your left. Sign marks the landing. Excellent landing. You put in and then head due west down ""river"" into deception bay, which isn't very wide at all. Best bet is to head north through loon rapids, the zig-zag, and up into Sen Bay. About 30 minute boat ride. Interesting... when you get to the launch, you'll think ""holy cow, this is going to be good"" with all the number of rigs, etc... Problem is when you get in the water and start going west, there are no boats. Everyone heads north to Sen Bay from this launch."
