I saw numerous boats full throttle with the trim all the way down. They were pushing tons of water and giving the passengers a terrible ride. I'm guessing they just don't understand how the trim works. Another thing is on Pakwash where I fish there is a common spot which is the river mouth that connects to the main lake. There are alot of boats on any given time. So I generally cut it to no wake if I'm passing through. One day there was just a few boats. You have plenty of room to go full throttle around. Instead these yahoos cut it to half throttle with the trim up and come right in close to us. This makes a huge wake and you get your brains beat in till it passes. Also some seem to have no idea what ""No Wake"" means. I see this alot in the Chain as well. I was just curious if anyone else has experienced any of these. I guess its a pet peeve of mine cause they are all simple fixes not to mention common courtesy."

They know full well that every boat going up the lake has to get past them, but act put out because it interupts their fishing. Did somebody mention a wake?"

548703,Catman59,2005-06-02 05:13:00,345,And you sure don't have to go all of the way to Canada to find them !!!!!!!!!!!
548708,Frankm,2005-06-02 07:22:00,154,Your right it happens everywhere. I live near the Chain O Lakes and its a zoo. I just seemed to notice it more this year in Canada.
