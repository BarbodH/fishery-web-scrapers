I would like some info on where we would find the walleye and lake trout in the warmer water. Is spring and fall that much better? Also how bad are the bugs?"

Outside of that magic sweet spot during June, August if my favorite month up there, more stable weather, more stable fish patterns and a lot less bugs."

Stable weather and the Walleye were not as scattered as in the spring and very cooperative. An excellent time to be up north in my opinion. Lake Trout, as was said, will be in the deepest hole they can find and fishing for them that deep is not my favorite sport.....others however enjoy it."
