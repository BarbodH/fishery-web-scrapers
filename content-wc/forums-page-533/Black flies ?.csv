1209111,Glenman12,2010-06-10 20:47:00,762,a little bug spray around the ankles cures the black flies..its the noseeums that tore me up last year..first time in 25 years..
1209172,dcraven,2010-06-11 05:32:00,47,"They'll be out. I'd be surprised if they aren't, anyway, Polaris... We fished that area last year, as I've told you, and had great fishing but battled the bugs. We bore scares for a month afterwords, even with bug dope. As soon as you have to turn the lights on in the evening, you'll have to close the windows until you turn the lights off, as the no-see-ums will come right through the screens - drawn to the light. It seemed as if the primary areas to hit with spray are mid-drift, neck/hat, sleeves and ankles. Still, black flies got to our hairline and mid-drift and bit under the clothing.Up on Nagalini, in Manitoba, one of my buddies was so frustrated with the black flies on his neck, he actually put duct tape on his neck every day while filming for In-Fisherman TV. Prior to that, even with DEET, he had blood dripping/running down on his shirts as the black fly has an anti-coagulant as it bites to keep the blood flowing... Nasty buggars."

Was in the bush most of the day yesterday working on a project and only had trouble with the mosquitoes. If you are calling the ankle biters ""black flies"", then I have not noticed them yet."
1209429,eyemike,2010-06-11 22:42:00,233,Pete all the years that I have gone to this area in June we have battled black flies and on a lot of occasions no-see-ums. Take plenty of bug dope and we found that if you spray your screens with yard guard it helps with the no-see-ums. We even resorted to lighting mosquito coils in the cabin while we were out ( put it in the kitchen sink to avoid fire). I have never seen a year that the black flies were not thick in June in this area. Once you are on the water in most cases you are not bothered It is on land that they will get you. Mike

1209536,Bluff,2010-06-12 16:01:00,152,"Was up in NW Ontario last week. Bugs not bad - a few no seeums but nothing like the past. Last day we were hit by chiggers - first time ever. Man, those things are the worst. None of us knew what hit us until we were on the road hours later. You really don't even know you were bit. Tore us up. Like I said, same camp we've been going to for years and never encountered them before."
