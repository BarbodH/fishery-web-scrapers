Normally we go at the end of July and do pretty well. I'm guessing we should do pretty well next week too. Last I heard, the water level on the English River was close to normal but they have been gettign a lot of rain over the past couple weeks."

They also said the walleye fishing has been very good. We go every year around Father's Day and have always done well, even with the high water last year, our biggest 'eye ' was 28-1/2. Looking forward to another good trip.....have a great trip and maybe we can compare notes when we get back!!"

The walleye are moving out of the bays and onto the points and current areas, most of my walleyes came out of 9-13ft of water...I went to 17 ft in the after shore-lunch. Water levels are almost at the norm....we caught lots of big fish, with the biggest only measuring at 28.25 inches. Minnows worked really well but they were just starting to go on leeches. I only jigged for them with blue or plain leadhead jigs, chartreuse worked well also. I will be back up there sometime in July."
