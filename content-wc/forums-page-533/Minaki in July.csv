This will be my 11 year old sons first trip to Canada and I'm going to try to put a few fish in the boat. Will the eyes be on the reefs? Spinners and minnows, troll cranks? Any advise will be greatly appreciated. We will be staying just on the south side of the RR tussle. Maybe a few lures that you wouldn't go to Minaki without. We will be casting for skis and pike also. Thanks in advance. Congo"
