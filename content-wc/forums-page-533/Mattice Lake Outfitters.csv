1210171,TIGHTLINER,2010-06-14 20:30:00,223,I have fished kag lake 5 times. It is a great lake lots of walleyes and the np are large. Have only caught 2 lake trout of med size. Always been up to kag a week or two after ice out. I have been told the best fishing for np is on south end of the lake where the three rivers come in. Walleyes are just about everywhere. We stayed with timberridge outfitters. There are several outfitters on kag now i can remember when there were only 2. It is a great lake to fish you will not be disappointed. Don't forget to post when you get back. Have a safe trip.
