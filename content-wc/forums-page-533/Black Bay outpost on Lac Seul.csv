I have been twice, and still love that trip. I think we usually get in early and fish the extra half day if your group leaves early. Any tips that you would have would be appreciated. My dad just got back and said the lake was low, and the ice was off early. I am not sure what they are hitting on, but knowing that lake you could just use a shoe string.I live in Arizona, but our group leaves from Quincy Il. If you have any Questions or are also looking for information I would be happy to set you up with Mr. Walleye himself my dad. Make sure to lime the ****ter and are indoors by dark."
