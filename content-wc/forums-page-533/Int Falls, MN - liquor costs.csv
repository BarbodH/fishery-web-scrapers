We plan to bring more then what is allowed duty free. What is the cost of a case of beer (domestic) non duty free? What is the cost of a liter whiskey (crown royal) non duty free? Thanks, LoDo"

Said she couldn't tell me prices for anything, because she ""wasn't on the sales floor."" I asked to be transferred to the sales floor. Was told ""sorry they're busy."" It was 8 PM on a weekday. Ah well....they must be busy. Didn't seem interested in my money. I get if I called on a Friday night or Saturday in spring or summer; but in the middle of winter?So I called Baudette instead. I guess they need the money; because she was very nice and answered all my questions.Case of 24 Labatts Blue / bottles / $191 litre bottle of Grey Goose Vodka $31Carton of Marlboro Cigarettes $30I'm skipping the duty free place in International Falls. They are ""too busy""http://www.dutyfreeamericas.com/reta...fm?stateAbr=MN"

Beer prices are not bad at all thus we have elected to buy US and declare at the border. Duty is app. $9-10 per case. She said the Canadian customs people have the process down pat and it takes only a short time to pay and head on. By the way, if you find a good buy near home, etc you can bring it with you; doesn't have to come from Duty Free Shop.Also, it appears you are suppose to have the receipts for what you paid for the beer, but reading other postings indicates customs rarely asks for them. Hope this helps."
1210414,mb386,2010-06-15 17:20:00,14,"Our group crossed the border to Canada on June 8. We purchased our Beer, Miller Lite, for $ 15.00 per case and some other liquors. We had a total of 7 cases of beer and 9 liters of liquor. At customs, the ""duty officer"" asked what the 1.75 liter of Vodka cost. It was $ 18.34 at Walmart in Colquett (sp?). A liter of the same item cost $ 49.00 Canadian.We were 6. Duty and GST, etc. was $ 99.84. The ""Duty Free"" is not necessarily less than what you can buy at home or in transit. It is about the same and can be more, especially the liquor. Still much cheaper than you can buy in Canada. Yes, we did a lot a fishing, but we didn't want to run out of our beverages. We didn't."
