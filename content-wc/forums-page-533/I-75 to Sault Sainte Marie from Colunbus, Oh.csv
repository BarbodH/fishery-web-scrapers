1209466,Seanik,2010-06-12 08:27:00,218,"We will be traveling I-75 to Hornepayne, Ontario the first week of July to Lake Nagagami, joining up with the rest of our guys in Columbus, Ohio, starting out in Erie, Pa. This is the first time we have traveled this route and would appreciate any insight on the trip. Recommended places to stop and eat, sights to see, construction, speed traps and what speeds are acceptable on this highway would be very helpful. We have been going to Quebec the last few years so this is a new adventure. Thanks, Seanik"
1209474,Richard B,2010-06-12 09:48:00,735,"I75 North bound through Toledo, OH and Monroe, MI is under construction. 1 lane close both North and South bound. Not any real issues most of the time just during rush hours. My family has driven to the Sault many times. I highly recommend coming up 75 to 475/23 North. Take 475/23 North through Toledo into Michigan. 23 North will connect back up with 75 North without you having to drive through downtown Toledo or Detroit. Nicer drive, less traffic, can stop at Cabela's on the way, (Dundee MI), and the roads are a lot smoother!!! By the way Bass Pro is in Rossford, OH just about 4 or 5 miles north of the 475/23 exit."
1209476,Ogoki,2010-06-12 09:50:00,291,"I have made the trip up thru the Soo over 40 times from Springfield,Ohio. If you are a bunch of BIG EATERS stop at Tony's at Birch Run . Largest portions I have ever seen at a meal . Only stopped once but I know guys who can't drive by without stopping. There is a Jay's Sporting Goods at Gaylord if you need to pick up some last minute lures etc. It is on the right as you come off the Gaylord exit. As you leave the Soo there is the Trading Post on the north side of town . At Wawa stop at Young's General Store . Old time looking building , license ,lures , good ice cream cones etc. There are also several Tim Horton's at the Soo and one at Wawa if you have big coffee drinkers. MSKE SURE you allow time to stop along Lake Superior between the Soo and Wawa as to me that is the BEST PART OF THE TRIP . I could sit for hours just relaxing and taking in the sights there ..................... The customs either entering and exiting the USA are no problem if you stay legal . Never had a problem or hold up either .............. Just got back from bear hunting in Manitoba and went thru a very small town to exit and enter the USA . The customs agents on both sides were professional but they just don't have much to do since it s a small port of entry . They really checked us out going and coming . Was just my wife and I and we are in our early fifties , clean cut , nice vehicle and we were up front with both going and coming , kinda made us feal like criminals coming back into our own country. NEVER had anything like that at the Soo or Grand Portage below Thunder Bay . I had our drivers license and passports in my hand before driving up to the window ,looked them directly in the eye and answered every question politely . Did not get a good fealing from them . Will always cross at larger town in the future . We think they were bored LOL LOL. .....Enjoy your trip . We go up thru the Soo in August again to bear hunt ."
1209479,TIGHTLINER,2010-06-12 09:54:00,223,You have bass pro in rossford ohio right off the ohio tp. Get on 23 about 20 minutes north you have cabela's in dundee. Stay on us 23 you have birch run outlet mall. Once you get around standish and pinconning you will find lots of cheese places. Mackinaw island at the bridge between the upper and lower state of michigan. In the upper part you will have the soo locks. As far as speed traps michigan sp can sit anywhere along 75 for a trap. I was up at way 3 weeks ago and there was some construction work on the road but traffic was maintained. Where are you fishing out of hornpayne??
1209544,Seanik,2010-06-12 16:36:00,218,"Thank you for all the good information, it sounds like an ok drive. Tightliner we will be at Expeditions North Lodge, July 9-16. Seanik"
1209550,EyeBanger,2010-06-12 17:39:00,23,"We usually top off our gas tanks at the Michigan Soo. Take the last exit before the international bridge (it's marked as such), and go west about a block. There is a Holiday gas and another one. Although they are a little pricier than you will find in most of Michigan, they are much cheaper than Ontario gas. I completely agree with Ogoki's comments about the Lake Superior shoreline. The sights start about 30 miles north of the Soo with a little rest area by the Chippewa river with a nice waterfall (unless the dry weather has diminished the water flow). Enjoy your trip."
1209711,MrTwister1,2010-06-13 13:31:00,3,"75 on I-75 won't even warrant a glance from our boys in blue but if you hit 80 or more they may decide to give you a not so friendly welcome and souvenoir (sp) of Michigan. Others have noted nice spots to see but as you are from Erie, you may notice we also have a Grosse Isle. DON""T bother with checking it out, yours is 10 X nicer!!"
1209931,onetimedave,2010-06-14 08:04:00,502,Be sure to stop at the above. Approx 40 miles North of the SOO right on your route. Unbelievable carvings along with normal tourist stuff. GOOD ice cream in the general store. Also the water falls in WAWA. Don't gas up in Hornepayne. Station is a ripoff. White river hase a few restaurants and gas stations.
