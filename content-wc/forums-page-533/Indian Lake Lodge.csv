1209151,JEREDOG,2010-06-11 00:01:00,21,I am staying at Indian Lake Lodge. This is closing in on our second week. We love it here. The fishing is fantastic and Derek and Cassy are the nicest people you will meet. We have caught numerouse fish over the 20 inch mark. Someone in our group brought in a 29 and 25 incher yesterday and showed off a bit before he set it back in the lake. We had our shore lunch today. After that we went out and caught our 8 take home fish that we still had to get in only 10 minutes. they were all nice fish. I would recomend coming to this camp. Dock service is FANTASTIC. Derek and Dan clean your fish for you and warm up your boat for you everyday. This camp is one of the best in the north. Derek and Cassy are the real deal.
