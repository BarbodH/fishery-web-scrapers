Beaver, Wally, June and I (Ward) get pulled to the side nearly every year, both ways, to be completely searched or for additional questions. Go figure! I can say the folks on the Canadian side of the border crossing are friendly, but very thorough.I was once asked why we were taking in so much Hostess bakery products. I responded ""for you and I it's a snack or dessert, for my 2 teen boys, it's their meal""..... I've never seen anything posted on a twinkie limit."
1209522,dman617,2010-06-12 14:41:00,117,"Just got back from up there. Int'l Falls. On the way up a week ago, we got stopped and asked to pull over to be searched. We waited 45 minutes and no border agent came over to us. We went inside and asked what was going on, not trying to make them angry. They said we were supposed to come in. Nobody told us that. They said they were doing passport checks for immigration blah blah. 20 minutes inside we were clear to go back to the vehicle.That turned out OK of course, then the guard came out to search. He was a rookie, we could tell. He asked why we didn't declare a paint brush, oil filter, 1 quart of oil, bar oil, gallon of deck stain, etc. Never had this happen before with all the questions. We were staying at a private cabin so that's why we had some stuff. He asked, ""What are you doing with the chainsaw?"". Response- ""Cutting trees"". ""What are you doing with all the tools? Fixing things that are broke."" Moron. I was waiting for him to ask, "" What ya doing with them there fishing poles?""Overall, it took about 2 hours. What a pain."
1209529,Ogoki,2010-06-12 15:31:00,291,"I crossed at Warroad ,Mn. last week going into Manitoba bear hunting . When I pulled up to the window I had our passports and drivers license along with the gun form in my hand. They were polite and professional but really checked us out . My wife and I are in our early fifties , clean cut and newer truck . Made me open gun case which I had locked and told them up front the ammo was in the back of the truck away from the gun and told them which container it was in . (I have done this before and want to be legal) . They made me open the bow cases and many other things. Not a problem as I did not have anything to hide . When we returned thru the American customs they made us feal like criminals with all the questions . I did not realize until I got home and unpacked that they had broken a hinge on a cooler lid. Instead of taking the stuff off the top of it before opening it they pulled it sideways to open .I could not see out the back window when I went to pull out and was told that was my problem and to move out of the way before reoranizing the bed of my truck . I kept my mouth shut as I just wanted to get away without any problems . As usual the people trying to work and have a nice life are hasseled . WHAT ABOUT THE SOUTHERN BORDERS ,EH ? I know of a some older guys who have got tired of that sort of treatment and high prices that have quit traveling north . I don't plan to quit but found to just keep my mouth shut when going thru customs."
1209531,Nimstug,2010-06-12 15:43:00,2605,"We have something of a system for going across the border each way. -the driver is the appointed spokesperson, unless the question is directed to someone else. -sunglasses off, hats tilted back so they can see the faces.-front and rear driver side windows down, even if there is no one in the back seat.-be ready with your identification. -have an idea what questions they will ask you and answer the questions politely. You are guest in a foreign country. -thank the people for doing their job. (It may make it easier for the next guy.)-when coming back, have your fish cooler where it can be easily accessed, but know they will look through your stuff for hidden fish.-allow some time in your travel plans for a thorough search.NimstugCommit to the Indian."
1209562,Pines,2010-06-12 19:13:00,10,"Yeah, what Nimstug said. I just say yes/no to questions. I used to try to explain myself, wow! they don't want to hear about it period. I just act as stupid as I can anymore."
1209570,tly,2010-06-12 19:26:00,1900,"I also have been across many many times since 197x and have had nothing but a long wait, and courteous agents. We had 2 of our guys pulled into an 'interrogation' area once. Both were clean and cost us maybe 10 minutes. Conversely, a vehichle next to us on that occasion was really stripped down, tackle boxes examined and were still there when we left. On either side, they have a job to do and guidelines to follow."
1210263,gholtz,2010-06-15 08:12:00,14,"yeah but there is something wrong with i kept my mouth shut so i wouldnt be hassled. there is no reason why stuff should get broken or tossed on the ground, other than ignorance."
1208334,LoDo,2010-06-08 20:33:00,721,"I drove N through the Int Falls, MN border on Sat morning of last week on my way to Las Seul and the border was searching several vehicles, mine included. All was good, but I can't remember a time in the past 20yrs where they had so many officers checking vehicles. Anyone know what the deal was or experienced this in the past? LoDo"
1208386,IRISHATTACK,2010-06-09 04:58:00,44,"Did they say what they were looking for. I was check like that in the Sault Ste.Marie. They actually walked on our tackle boxes and threw our cloths right on the ground. I hope it goes quick, I will be going through Fort Fran. on Friday night."
1208442,camp chef,2010-06-09 07:18:00,915,We were checked too a couple of weeks ago.The female border guard was not only very pleasant but extremely good looking. She said the computer randomly selects vehicles to search. It only took a few minutes and on we went.
1208500,Mark R,2010-06-09 08:54:00,1538,No question there are a couple of foxes working the border at FF. I can't believe any customs agent would throw your clothing on the ground in a random search
1208501,JayM5209,2010-06-09 08:55:00,1050,"Crossed northbound at Intl. Falls at 5 am Saturday, 5/28, and there was 0 wait time, no inspections being done. A very polite and professional young man wished us good fishing and a safe trip, even though we were one bottle of wine over on the alcohol. (He did not send us inside to declare the excess and pay duty.) In my 30+ years of crossings (luckily w/out ever undergoing an empty-it-all-out inspection) I've become convinced that our neighbors to the north work very hard in training their border agents to adhere to a vigorous Good Neighbor policy. It's always been a pleasure to interact with them."
1208507,IowaDave,2010-06-09 09:03:00,69,"We got our vehicle searched a couple years ago. They stopped the 2 vehicles in front of us and the 2 behind us. Took an extra 20 minutes or so, but not too big of a deal. Just doing their jobs and trying to keep things safe IMO."
1208518,IRISHATTACK,2010-06-09 09:21:00,44,"The young guy at the Sault, not only threw about half of the cloths on the ground but as he walked on tackle boxes he cracked 2 of them. Every time before that and since, I have gone right through with no problem, and have not paid duty on extra beer in 3 years."
1208539,Mark R,2010-06-09 10:13:00,1538,"I didn't mean to say I didn't believe what happened to you, I meant it's hard to fathom why he would do such a thing when a proper search can be done without all that nonsense."
1208545,stumcfar,2010-06-09 10:34:00,451,"We have never had a problem going into Ontario. We have pulled an enclosed trailer the last few years and only one time did they ask us to unlock it and then they just looked in and thanked us and off we went. We have been checked a little more coming back and last year we actually had an outbound check when we left the states. We had an incident one year going into Manitoba, where the border agent climbed into the boat and stepped on and broke a rod. He was a real jerk and we found out later that there is a form that can be sent in for reimbursement. The problem is, who wants to ask for that form, the rubber gloves would probably come out then!"
1208863,Fish_on,2010-06-10 07:42:00,1856,I have been across the border around 60 times since 1979 and I have never been searched. Amazing.
