Can his mother just sign the letter allowing him to go or does he need a signature from both?? Any help would be great. Thanks, Joe"
1210422,Aaron-IN,2010-06-15 18:12:00,500,You will need a notorized letter from his mother (assuming she is his legal guardian) and his birth certificate. Make sure you include all of his mothers contact information on the letter as well.

When they travel to spend a portion of their summer with me in camp they travel with their passports and a notarized letter from their mother. Our letter includes their travel itinerary including dates,where they will be crossing the border, who the girls will be traveling with, the contact info for both me and their mother, and the details about when they will be returning home to the states.With this information we have never had an issues at the border. Hope this helps.Dave"
1210504,joeman79,2010-06-15 21:55:00,417,Well Kids Dad found out he was going to Canada and I guess he is in the military and has joint custody. And he is forbiding him to go. And the kid was going up on a mission trip up to Thunder Bay to do HOuse improvements for the less fortunate. I guess he had an attorney call his mom and everything. SO I guess he does have to consent according to what she told my wife. Sucks that he can't ebven let his kid go on a missiontrip after working all year at fund raisers. Sorry this is off topic Juls.
