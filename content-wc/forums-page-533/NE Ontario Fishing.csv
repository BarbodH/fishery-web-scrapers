1209854,DonC,2010-06-13 21:17:00,93,"wveer, I recommend the Upper or Lower French River 200 miles north of Toronto. Smallmouth fishing is very good throughout. Walleye fishing on the Upper French and Lake Nippissing is acceptable. Walleye on the Lower French is spotty except in Spring. Pike fishing is fine on both Upper and Lower French Rivers. I recommend Chaudiere Lodge on the Upper French if you want an American Plan and a top notch lodge. Boats are cedar stripped and have 20 HP, so you do not fly. If you have your own boat, that would be good. 3 years ago my brothers and I stayed at Casa Blanca which was nice. On the Lower French, Bears Den Lodge looks good. Have never stayed there though. There are Canadian Hydrographic topo maps of the Upper French. The Lower French is more remote and undeveloped, and there is no topo maps, and so more care needs to be exercised. There are huge muskie in both areas. My favorite place to go is to fly to Winnipeg, drive to Minaki Ontario, and stay at Birch Island Resort. Great lodge and great fishing. Boats are 17 foot Lunds with 50 HP Yamaha 4 strokes, and they are essentially new or 1 year old. Good luck with your choice. I know fishermen from Pittsburg go to Chaudiere Lodge in past years. Don"

1210029,doubleheader,2010-06-14 12:57:00,2652,"I fish the west arm of Nipissing each year. Every year is different, but we usually do pretty well on the walleye and the bass and musky is good also. This year Nipissing is down 2' from average depth. I've fished quite a few lakes, and personally this is one of my favorites, but it can be difficult to locate fish if you lack lake experience. Still, it's a beautiful lake and you should be able to find decent quantities of fish if you work a little."
1210141,adempsey,2010-06-14 19:19:00,963,"Try this site, it's quite good for planning a trip in Ontario:http://www.noto.ca/buildatrip.htmlI often promote it, but I really enjoyed my trips to Lady Evelyn Lake. I believe this is within your driving range (it's about 6-7 hours from Toronto). However, if you want the bigger pike you're better off on a different lake (as far NW as you can get). So, when using the noto.ca guide do not overlook the James Bay Frontier or Sudbury regions as many of the outfitters are on the ""border"" and within your driving distance.Also, don't overlook Quebec.Good luck!"
