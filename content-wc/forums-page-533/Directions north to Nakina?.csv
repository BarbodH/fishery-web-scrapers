1193140,Erie Ranger620,2010-04-25 13:52:00,74,So whats the best way to Nakina coming through Michigan from Ohio?This my first trip up in that area I have been fishing northern Quebec. Is 17 to 11 the best way? Or does 631 through Hornepayne make the most sense. Or is there another option that doesn't include gravel roads?
1193169,Crede,2010-04-25 15:08:00,134,"Coming from Columbus we go 17N from SSM to White River. 631 thru Hornepayne to 11W. 11W thru Longlac to Geraldton. 584 from Geraldton to Nakina. Tried 17N from SSM to Nipigon and back to Geraldton on 11E. Took about 90 minutes more, although more scenic with more time along Superior."
1193207,515,2010-04-25 16:19:00,254,Crede has it correct. Just keep your eyes open for moose and bears wandering the roads. What outfitter are you fishing with in Nakina?
1193304,Erie Ranger620,2010-04-25 19:30:00,74,"We are heading to O'sullivans Rainbow [http://www.osullivansrainbow.com/index.html] First time there have had good reports looking for a lodge to call home that I can drive to with limited gravel and is semi secluded. I can give up the serenity of a flyin, for having the tech of my own boat [Alumacraft 165 Mag 50 hp tiller] I do enjoy the challenge of opening up a new lake. I like to run a bouncer harnesses over wind beaten reefs and drop-offs and structure near river mouths. I love shallow weed beds at dusk popping 1/16 -1/8 twister tails into 3-5ft. Has anyone tried in the evening pulling cranks especially #5 shad-Raps over deep 50-100ft water in the summer to walleyes eating ciscos rising up in the evening? Its a pattern in Quebec that has worked well. Do these sound like patterns for area lakes. Does anyone know how tea-stained the water is there compared to the waters of Gouin in Quebec?

1193399,Mr Ranger,2010-04-26 06:16:00,272,"Hey Erie Ranger620, think you will love OS. This will be my sixth year up and have caught walleyes every way possible except slip bobbers which I have not gotten desperate enough to try. Every year the fishing has gotten better. We have had very good success with cranks from 5ft down to 40ft. Our best year was trolling 7"" perch Rapala floaters. We have had the best luck with perch color or purple and yellow worked too. When the jigging slows down head for the cranks and Lake Trout and deeper walleyes. Your days on Erie will serve you well as you know to be flexible. We go up the last full week of June. Have fun."
1210192,Putzer5,2010-06-14 22:01:00,11,"We have been going to O'sullivan for 17 years. We keep it simple. We use bottom bouncers and crawler harnesses. We always catch lots of fish. It sounds like it has been hot this year, so I suspect that the fish will be in the rocks, off of points. Always fish an area where the wind is blowing in. We always look for them in the weed beds first, then go deeper to rocky points. Lake Superb, which is connected to O'sullivan has some good fishing, near the island at the river mouth, but it is a long trip, to get there. We will be there the week of 7/25/2010."
1210236,tooski,2010-06-15 07:04:00,393,"Just returned from that area. Crede is correct, 631 thru Hornepayne is the better route with good roads. Smokey is also right in that we saw a few bears and moose along the route, keep alert. Fishing was very good with zero black flies and few skeeters due to the draught. May change with the recent rains however."
1210247,onetimedave,2010-06-15 07:25:00,502,"I75 to the Soo. Then Rt17 to White River, then North on 631 to Rt11 and turn left (West) to Geraldton and right on 584 to Nakina. No gravel roads. Usually see wildlife (bear and moose) between White River and Rt 11. Have traveled to Nakina 15 times from Ohio and found this the best route."
1210424,Erie Ranger620,2010-06-15 18:23:00,74,Thanks guys I am always amazed and humbled by the help fellow fisher dudes give each I quess we share a common love of this sport. Bottom Bouncers are my all time favorite shallow deep and every where in between they catch fish. I fish Lake Erie every chance I get and bbouncer always first choice Northlands Floatnspin & Macs Smile Blade. Leaving in 10 days for OS staying overnight at the Silver Nugget in Geroldton anyone stay there before? Has anyone stayed in cabin 6 at OS? First time is always seems like such an adventure hope to make this my home lake after 15-20 years on one lake in Quebec. Heres some bottombouncer action from Sat http://walleyewarrior.blogspot.com/
1210460,Yellow Fever,2010-06-15 19:57:00,1809,Hello....I lived in North Western Ontario for a few years and had the pleasure of working in all of the towns up there. I agree with the short cut through Hornpayne but The drive from Sault to Nipigon and then north on Hwy 11 is as pretty a drive as you will ever take. I had not been up there in 25 years and drove through this winter on my way to Calgary and I will say I had forgotten the unbelievable beauty up there. I hope you have a great trip but really the 90 minutes longer it takes is nothing compared to what you will see.
