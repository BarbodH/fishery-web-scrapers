I have contacted Wright's Wilderness Camp and Golden Hook. Any comments or comparisons on those 2 camps? Thanks in advance.wmd"
1209558,Guest,2010-06-12 18:36:00,0,Both are good camps. Gull Rock is a great lake to fish. I stay at Wright's because the owners are GREAT to work with and take super care of you while you are there. It is also close to what I call the better fishing spots on the lake. Hope you have a great trip where ever you stay at.

I have never fished that lake in September, but I have heard that it is a good time to fish that lake. I've been staying at South Bay for years and the resort is very clean and organized. I'll be staying there again in July."

Owner's one of the best sticks in the Red Lake area who uses his time and knowlede to ensure no-one struggles (even though it's kinda hard to struggle on Gull Rock, but sometimes somebody does). Very clean, well run camp. September is an awesome time to be on Gull Rock!!! Good Luck."
