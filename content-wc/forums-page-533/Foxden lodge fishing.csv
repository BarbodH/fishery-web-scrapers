After looking online for a resort to go to we decided on foxden lodge ontario. We were not disappointed. Even with the mayfly hatch in full swing, we caught over a hundred fish. We are average fisherman at best but we were able to catch a 26 inch 7 pound walleye and a 10 pound pike. The food was great and the living quarters were justas good. If you are looking for an affordable fishing trip that has all the amenities of some of more expensive resorts give foxden lodge a look"
