6330720,1shooter,2019-06-13 07:38:00,1493,My new truck is in the shop and may not be done for my fishing trip. Any issues with crossing border with a dealer loaner car?
6330726,The tank,2019-06-13 07:46:00,340,We had one a few years back. Canada said nothing. Coming back in the USA they asked and we had to show them the paperwork from the dealer. No big deal.

A few yrs ago my wife and I rented a van, econoline type open back for a fun antique road trip to OH<WV<PA and returned and no mention at all about the vehicle being a rental, on the way across or back."
6330758,dhottle,2019-06-13 08:48:00,163,I recently rented a car in Duluth & then spent a week at Rainy Lake in Ontario. US customs wanted to see my rental paper work before waving us on. So just have your paperwork handy when you go through customs.

6331016,camp chef,2019-06-14 07:25:00,915,I work for a GM dealer and the insurance on our loaners is NOT good outside the US. Check with the dealer for permission but also with your own insurance as they will be the primary insurer on any loaner vehicles you may be in.

We have not had any problems at all crossing the border. I think we had to show the rental agreement once, but usually they just wave us through. We have never had an insurance claim."
6655748,Sapthiro,2022-05-13 01:01:00,1,"Dealers often encounter problems at customs because the state changes the legislation every year, and some dealers find out about the changes too late. Buying cars from abroad is quite common, saving a lot of money. I also bought a car from Japan. I don't know how to properly bring a car from overseas, but these guys http://jdmbuysell.com solved all these issues. I got an awesome car at a very low price. It would have become much more expensive if I had bought it here."
