6654078,elway12,2022-05-06 08:00:00,335,Thanks for the kind words Pooch and Stjoguy for posting the information. We are going for a bit longer than the 5 days so the trip is more than the base rate but we will still be under the 1st timers special. The special rate has a 2400 weight limit for the group and it must be a minimum of 6 people. I could still use one more person to add to our group.

6654854,elway12,2022-05-09 14:35:00,335,I was able to get another person added to our group so we are able to go!! We could still add one more person if someone wants to join us. Thanks for getting the word out. 60 days of planning and dreaming until our trip!!
6640926,elway12,2022-03-17 10:55:00,335,"Hi All, I posted this in Share A Seat but I figured posting it here might get it out to a few more folks. I need 2 maybe 3 people to fill out my group that will be fishing on Miniss Lake thru Slate Falls Outposts on July 7-15th 2022. Message me if interested and I will give you more information."
6643656,elway12,2022-03-27 21:25:00,335,I am still in need of 1-2 people to fill out our group to Miniss. If you have anyone who is interested please pass on this posting. Thanks!
6652208,elway12,2022-04-29 09:18:00,335,"Well, I HAD people lined up to go on our trip and now they have just backed out. Thus, I am still in need 1 or 2 people to join us on our Miniss trip July 8-15th 2022. Thanks to all of you that have been getting the word out."
6652240,Eckohlt,2022-04-29 10:39:00,3685,"I know you don't want to hear this,if I wasn't already going July 16 I would be in,sounds like a Great Lake."
6653992,reddemon2,2022-05-05 18:44:00,255,Is this the $1000 special?
6654016,RichA$1970,2022-05-06 03:57:00,1159,That would be a steal if it was for the duration but Iâ€™d put my money on No it is not.
6654026,Eckohlt,2022-05-06 05:10:00,3685,If it is a 7 day trip to miniss for 1000$ it's a huge steal.
6654038,guidedfishing,2022-05-06 05:54:00,531,"Well if it $1000 for a cabin for 7 days the value is what you perceive it to be. If that includes meals, boat & gas well yes that would be well worth looking at for someone without a boat."
6654066,stjoeguy,2022-05-06 07:14:00,979,"I'm not sure what the cost is for elway12's trip or whether he still has any openings, but here's the rate info for Miniss with Slate Falls Outposts from their website: Current Summer specials MINISS SUMMER SPECIAL BACK BY POPULAR DEMAND!! Miniss Lake [July 1 to end of season] 6 to 8 people $1000 US for 5 Days fishing extra days are $150 if you want to do a longer trip. [[weight restrictions apply to the Miniss special]] [[An extra 700 or 1200 pounds is an additional cost call for details and pricing]] No, it doesn't included meals, that would be a steal, but it's still a pretty good price for a fly-in. I fished Miniss from the Slate Falls east cabin in 2018 and had a great time. There were fires south of the lake that year and we came across a little rock island that must have been struck by lightning. It's hard to see in the photo, but some brush is still smoldering and the tree is burnt.https://slatefallsoutposts.com/ontar...ario-outposts/"
