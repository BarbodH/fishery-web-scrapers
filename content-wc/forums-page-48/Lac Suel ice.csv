6654762,NWwalleye,2022-05-09 07:15:00,223,Thinking it will be close. Weather is warm and the rain will help. Keep our fingers crossed
6654764,prov1800,2022-05-09 07:27:00,5010,Don't give up yet.Things are happening ice is getting dark and soft.some more rain and good weather coming again.Lots of current in that area.

6654860,prov1800,2022-05-09 14:50:00,5010,Getting black fast everywhere I took the back road detour today and went past Long Lake and looks to go in couple of days which means Eagle will follow a week later.I picked up my prop today I got fixed and saw the ice on Wabigoon in my buddies bay and pretty black lije your photo and saw Thunder Lake also its ready to go.All great news.

In other matters, the water in our lake is higher than I have seen it in the spring, quite a contrast from where it was last year, when it was as low as I had seen it. There was a month in the August period last year when I had to pry the boat off the rail system because the water was so low and I couldn't use the dock at the cabin up north for the plane because the floats bottomed out before I could get along side. Crazy variations in less than a years time."
