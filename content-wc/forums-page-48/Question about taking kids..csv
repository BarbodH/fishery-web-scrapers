2312850,nitroman,2014-01-01 16:00:00,368,Today I told my 10 year old he will be joining me on this years trip and boy is he as excited as I am. My brother in law will be taking his son as well so the 2 are now in my kitchen planning their trip. My question is do i need a passport or just his birth cert for the trip? He has some gift certificates to cabelas and a local bait and tackle so we will be gearing up here soon as he is already asking to go shopping. We did order a rain suit today as that is a must for early season fishing. Any other lessons learned to help us out? His reaction when I told him he was going this year was absolutely priceless just pure joy. I think I may be even more excited to take him and show him the ropes than he knows!
2312874,Catman59,2014-01-01 16:09:00,345,I would get him a passport card. Kids are 1/2 price of a regular PP card .You will be set and your border crossing will be easy. I started taking my kids 11 years ago and they have enjoyed the many trips. Good luck .
2313098,kzoofisher,2014-01-01 17:06:00,5144,"Get a passport card and take notarized letters from both Moms detailing that they are aware of the trip, where your going and when. I've never needed the letter but I know somebody who did and didn't have it. Total PITA for her and hours wasted.Over pack the warm layers. I'd buy a couple of cheaper rain suits for each kid and rubber over shoes to ensure they stay dry. You'll have a ball if they stay comfortable."
2313106,Mrnovice,2014-01-01 17:08:00,75,"Been taking my 2 kids since they were 5 and 7. Passport card will work fine, it is cheaper. The only thing is you can't fly international with it....only driving across the border. Be sure and get a signed note from mom if she is not going. They will ask for it at the border if both parents are not along. With a note, we have no issues at all. Good luck, it will be the best times!"
2313194,Blades-n-Beads,2014-01-01 18:08:00,484,"Nitroman, I started taking my 2 boys every year since they were 10 and 13, now both gone and married we still make one trip together every year. They will have it no other way. One of the best things they remember when they were little was I included them in all the planning and details a trip takes and to this day they both love the planning part. As a father putting on some age I tear up when they show up at my door and want to get the planning phase in gear for another trip. Now they take the bull by the horns and make things happen but include me. Funny how things turn around when parents do things the right way when the children are little. They do not forget. Hope you and your son have a safe and wonderful trip."
2313257,pjshorthorn,2014-01-01 18:51:00,5654,"I took my son for the first time when he was 10. It was the best trip I've ever taken. Let the boys be part of the overall experience and ask them to help out with chores you feel they won't mind too much. My son felt like he was part of the group when he was helping out whether it was organizing the boat each evening, helping dry dishes or just sweeping out the cabin. Concentrate on them in the boat and help them learn everything they are interested in absorbing. I didn't get much fishing time in myself that trip, but watching my son have the time of his life catching walleyes and pike was well worth that very small sacrifice. Let the young ones lead.....if they are cold and wet, go in if they want to and build a fire in the stove. If they get bored, pull up on shore and let them explore. When they say they would like to fish a little more, but they are a little hungry....take a break for lunch even if the fish are biting better than ever. Take more pictures than you think are necessary. They will be special items for years to come. Even though you technically don't have to buy him a license ( I think), buy one anyway so he feels like one of the big guys. Take the best pictures from the trip and frame them with his fishing license. If you plan on taking fish home, his license will allow you to keep his limit whereas any fish he would keep during the trip without a license count towards your possession limit ( this wasn't an important aspect to myself when I've bought his license). If the boys do catch a trophy, submit the info to the Ontario Angler award program ( or province you are fishing in) and get their certificate and stickers. They will brag about that for years to come. You'll need to look up the qualifying criteria per species. I'm glad to say that my son is still interested in hanging out with Dad in a boat for quite a few hours each day on our trips. I'm privileged to have him going along with me on his sixth trip this year as a grown man. Remember one important thing.....the young lads will miss Mommy a LOT while they are gone and Mommy will miss them EVEN MORE. The only time I saw my son a little down was when we were ready to fly home after 7 days of being gone. I asked him if he missed Mommy and he had that trembling lip and just nodded his head...... if he is a little down during the trip, it won't be because he isn't having a fun vacation with Dad. The other fellas have already mentioned to you about the notarized documents from Mommy. That is a really important aspect to have in place. I carried multiple copies in case they asked to keep a copy at the border. Just a few thoughts from my first trip with the son. As they say in the commercials.........X amount of $ for the trip, quality time with your child.....priceless. Enjoy and best of luck. PjShorthorn"
2314577,LOW1,2014-01-02 09:35:00,2828,"If you want to save a few bucks, the kids don't need a passport or a passport card if they have their original birth certificates and are under 16. The birth certificate should have the official raised stamp on it - a simple photocopy may not work.Follow the advice given re: a notarized letter from the moms giving their consent to entering Canada. Include in the letter Mom's telephone number if the border folks want to contact them to verify.Ten year olds like to eat their way to Canada. You should consider stopping at the A & W drive in at Spring Valley, MN and Gordy's Top Hat in Cloquet. They may also like the Mine View tourist information center in Virginia which gives an interesting view of the mines, big trucks to see, etc. And find a place in Canada to order them some perogies."
2314937,Carnhzkr,2014-01-02 11:58:00,964,"I'd bet a dozen doughnuts that everyone, including minors, MUST have a passport or passport card to clear customs. Kids used to require only a birth cert, but that changed a few years ago.When I first started taking my two boys, I tried to include some non-fishing activities. I imagine you'll be crossing at Intl Falls. On one of my first trips with my boys, I got Subways at Evelith and stopped to eat them at the Mine View Lookout just before you get to Virginia. That's a good one for kids. They have some huge dump trucks and mining equipment they can climb on. It's a good photo opportunity and it's right on the way.If you have time, I'd suggest the free tour of the paper mill in Intl Falls. That was the highlight of the trip for my oldest boy one year when it was just the two of us. He got to wear a hard hat and eye protection and watch the big machines and ask questions. One more diversion on your way home, if you have time, is the tour of the old mine in Sudan, MN. It's about 20 miles off the highway, toward Ely. It takes a while, and it costs around $10 per person, but kids love it. One more thing I'd always try to work in, if there's a particularly rainy or windy day, I'd take off half a day and go into town to explore. I've gotten pizza and gone to the museum in Red Lake, Ice Cream at Smitty's in Ear Falls, Robin's Doughnuts in Sioux Lookout. I know my wife appreciated the break."

I was 7 when I went with the guys for the first time and haven't missed yet, except 2012 when my twins were born and my wife asked that I stay home to help her, and 2020 when the border was closed. In 2019 my son was 7 and started his tradition, bad part was year 2 he already had to break his streak due to the border being closed. He started it again in 2021."

6654772,RRK285,2022-05-09 07:57:00,44,My dad and I are taking my 10 and 8 year olds on their first trip in a couple weeks. We are flying in too. 3 generations. I think my kids have been packed for a month already. They are excited!
2329409,Lovetofish,2014-01-07 07:45:00,458,My daughter has caught walleye on Gummy Worms.
2330369,MrSimon,2014-01-07 12:48:00,922,"You are right, some guys might consider it a concession .... but its really an investment! It will pay off big time down the road when the kids start planning the trips."
2331985,nitroman,2014-01-07 21:27:00,368,"We decided to go to the local bait and tackle this Sunday to cure some cabin fever and start looking for things he needs as he has been preparing his ""list"". They have a big concrete tank in back they stock chubs in in the summer but now it's full of bass,bluegill,crappie,walleye, and a trout . We were the only customers so the guy behind the counter gave him a ice rod and sent him back to fish the tank. He ended up catching some gills and further entrenching his desire to fish. He spent an hour back there just having a ball. I don't see a problem with him getting bored in the boat up north as we spend many days on the Mississippi fishing and the kid just plain loves to fish and is always trying new things even if what he has is working. Ever since he was old enough to start fishing with me he has always had the patience for the sport and would stick out long after even I got bored with a spot. I plan on mounting my gopro in the boat to capture some moments on the trip along with lots of pics as his mom is a scrap booker and will require them. He has been crossing the days of the colander and asking questions about the trip and bugging me as when it's time to get the lists out and start the planning. Defiantly going to be awesome and prolly the start of his yearly trips that I hope last a lifetime as I will need someone to take me up the when I get to old to."
2332121,Da' Walleye Assassun,2014-01-07 22:34:00,358,Your kids will also pick out your nursing home.
6653908,nitroman,2022-05-05 12:53:00,368,Man time Flies by! This year he graduates and is already a member of the Army national Guard. I am taking him back again this year for his graduation trip. This year he mans his own boat (will still stick close to dad and mom I bet) and is charge of his own time on the lake now. He grew into a well rounded responsible young man that enjoys fishing and I foresee will always be a part of each years trip and will eventually replace dad as the chief planner. I am as excited now as I was 8 years ago for him to be with us up north!
6653976,RichA$1970,2022-05-05 17:59:00,1159,"Like others said, keep them warm and dry with a good rain suit and rubber boots plus layers of warm clothes and the rest is easy. I would take him fishing even to a local pond to ensure his gear is up to speed and no issues before you go."
6654062,Jwendt15,2022-05-06 07:05:00,72,"Great story, thanks for sharing. I have been going to Onaway Lodge for years on Lac Seul and have a 7 and 4 year old. Been wondering when is the right time to start taking them up north. I figure another year or two and will give it a shot. Got excited just reading your post. Can't wait to start making those memories with them!"
6654424,REG,2022-05-07 08:36:00,445,"I first took my 2 oldest to Canada when my son was 8 and my daughter was 10. My son was the 8 year old. And this year he'll be flying into Minneapolis for us to pick him up on the way north - he just turned 30. I was able to get them all up North yearly until they went to college or had their own jobs/families. I know they all have fantastic memories of those years as do I. You won't be able to fish every minute (I remember one time when I was either taking their fish off, or baiting their hook for about a half hour and barely getting a cast in myself) or stay out as long, but it will be some of the best times your kids and you will ever have."
6654456,prov1800,2022-05-07 11:28:00,5010,Last summer I took out a Dad and his 2 and 6 year old kids and Had a great time with them.Well behaved and kept them busy catching fish.The 2 year old had a great time in between dishing with the minnows in the bucket.When my boys were still babies my wife and i took them everywhere with us from fishing to camping on the lake already.
6654458,bthomas3333,2022-05-07 11:35:00,465,"Same as many here I started taking my son when he was 10 which is about the same age my dad started taking me. My first trips were paddling in Quatico which is a lot rougher than a fly out outpost which is where I started. I know I pushed my son too a few too many hours a time or two, but it seems to be ok now. As others said def head back when they need a break. I'd also add if the fishing is really slow and nothing seems to be working, stop fishing and switch gears to exploring or build a camp fire / etc. This offseason one of the greatest moments in a few years happened. After taking my son every year from 10-17 years old and only stopping for college and grad degree, my son is graduating with his engineering degree! He came up to me this January after missing the last 7 years or so and said ""dad, lets go fishing somewhere this Summer."" **** near made this old guy cry. He still wants to fish with the old man! Enjoy the time with the son. Time goes fast. B-"
2315849,jiggster,2014-01-02 17:22:00,183,I have been taking my son since he was 9. We were lucky enough to have time and not rushed. We stopped at every sport shop between Minneapolis and Ear Falls. You have received great information. One other thing to consider is to throw in a bag with a change of clothes for each kid and maybe a change of sox for everyone. I have gotten my feet wet getting in and out of the boat on shore. The time you will have is precious and will never be forgotten.
2315993,nitroman,2014-01-02 18:12:00,368,Thanks for all the great replies guys! I think I will get him the card as it seems the easiest and I can hang on to it for future trips. Extra clothes and socks in the boat is a great idea. Already informed mom that she needs to write a letter too. She is excited to see him go as she knows how much he loves to do what dad does and she knows how much he loves fishing. Although she dreads the day when he starts heading west to snowmobile with me lol.keep the tips coming as I am sure I am not the only one that will benefit. Thanks agin fellas!
2316081,Blades-n-Beads,2014-01-02 18:48:00,484,"Nitro, one more thing, can't believe I didn't mention this before, on accident one trip many many years ago my boys and myself packed a great lunch with a bag of chips or may have been corn curls or something, one of my boys tossed a few over board when a seagul flew by, next thing you know both the boys were chucking hand fulls to about 20 gulls, they were laughing up a storm, every trip since the first one they make sure there are many bags of chips just for the gulls. To this day they still do it. Great memories."
2316353,jkretch,2014-01-02 20:46:00,80,"I have two boys. Between the two of them, crossed border 10 times when at least one of them was under 16 with only a birth cert with original seal. No issues. Youngest just turned 16 - so will have to get him a passport now. If your venue offers portage lakes - they have always been a highlight of the trip. Something about the adventure of a new and different lake. Have fun!"
2316409,btyreprich,2014-01-02 21:05:00,1067,Just realized that I forget to tell you what I did with my kids in preparation for their first trip to Canada. The very first item we bought was a life jacket. Made sure the jackets fit the kids and was comfortable. I let the kids pick out the jackets in terms of color schemes so they'd take ownership of them. No more important piece of fishing gear of course. Make sure the rain suit will fit over the life jacket. Enjoy the trip. The memories are priceless.
2320177,kzoofisher,2014-01-04 13:08:00,5144,"Great reco on the life jacket, can't believe I forgot that."
2322801,billy weaver,2014-01-05 11:48:00,470,"Get the passport and letters from mom, chances are this won't be their last trip. Get them a decent rain suit a little on the large size. You are in for a real treat as I started taking my grandson to Canada fishing at age 6 and he has been going for 7 years. Be sure to take plenty of photos for mom and family."
2323761,MrSimon,2014-01-05 17:05:00,922,"Great advice so far. Keeping the kids comfortable is absolutely key. Warm and dry is essential .... keeping bugs off them is important too. And don't forget sunscreen and chapstick. Pictures, pictures, pictures .... and let them take a lot of pictures too. And if at all possible, take some of their friends with them. Ideally, two dads with two or three kids is the best combo."
2324842,Slushfish,2014-01-06 04:57:00,263,"We've been taking both our boys to Ca. 5-10 times a yr since they were 6mo. old. They are now 7 & 13. Using all the same good ideas mentioned above, we've not had one issue. Abide by their rules and everything should go smooth. Key is to keep them happy. If they get bored, stop and do something to keep them busy, even if it is prime time. Find a spot to swim, pick blueberries, let em play with the minnows. At times like those sometimes you,and me,as fishermen have to make concessions and remember its really about them. For some people that can be hard. Make sure its fun for them.Slushfish"
2328793,Papa eye,2014-01-06 21:38:00,124,"Lots of good advice already. As a father of three boys I have taken them as young as 7, Remember to pack little bags of skittles, gummy worms, etc for those pauses in the action. I suggest an UL for walleye jigging. They develop the feel quicker. Let them try that goofy lure they picked out, try not to over coach. My best trick if they get discouraged is to set the hook, pause, then ask the the little one to hold your rod while you get out the sunscreen or a treat... Next thing you know they got a fish! Btw my wife really enjoyed the peace at home when we ""got"" to go fishing. She always said it was her favourite vacation."

No issues from the border guard in International Falls.If the kids are young enough, explain to them how to answer the border guard's questions just as they would a teacher at school.I will disagree with a previous post on buying the kids inexpensive rain suits. I searched the internet and found thicker rain suits that will hold up and are large enough for the kids to grow into them. We just rolled the pants legs up or tucked them in the rubber boots.I did save money buying inexpensive rubber boots for the kids at Blain's Farm & Fleet. These worked fine on the three times we had to put our rain gear on.NOTHING will make a fisherman miserable like being soaked in a rain storm. If you want the kids to come up the following year, provide them with good equipment and make a fuss over each & every fish they catch."
