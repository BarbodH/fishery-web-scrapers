6655630,prov1800,2022-05-12 14:50:00,5010,Not going to totally put my neck out there but woukd say yes.Looking pretty good from what iam seeing.Definatly will be fishable water in most areas.
6655632,prov1800,2022-05-12 14:54:00,5010,Bridge is good.Fixed a while ago plus the other further up the road.
6655638,prov1800,2022-05-12 15:12:00,5010,Pretty crazy
6655640,walleyecheek,2022-05-12 15:15:00,2231,Just make sure you wash it down with cases of beer (preferably Labatts)
6655680,dschiebel,2022-05-12 17:29:00,85,"My grampa, who fished clay lake for 35 years, told us that eating walleye with mercury will not hurt you as long as you drink beer while consuming it lots of beer. He stated that the beer will absorb the mercury and you just pee it out, thats why lots of beer is necessary. He stated that after you pee for about 10 minutes you should be good, but to make sure you need to have 2 brandy godfathers before bed. A brandy godfather is 2 shots of good brandy a 1 shot of amaretto. That suppose to kill what ever mercury is left. Grampa just turned 94 and acts like he is 10 or 12. Not sure why that is but he is extremely physically healthy. Grama says that he still has all his teeth, and when not fishing, he is chasing her all the time. She says she has to lock him in the garage, or she locks herself in the bathroom until his sex drive calms down. So anyways there is that."
6655698,Eckohlt,2022-05-12 18:08:00,3685,"If I fish clay n eat fish I'm gonna die,I don't drink beer,and I ain't gonna start."
6655702,prov1800,2022-05-12 18:23:00,5010,Don't drink either and still kicking and fishing.you got nothing to worry about.
6655540,prov1800,2022-05-12 10:46:00,5010,https://youtu.be/CYb9j9vftEUOne of the banks is eroding so they are putting some huge rocks in to contain it.
6655550,Eckohlt,2022-05-12 11:03:00,3685,"Where are all the fish going to go when there sweep down river,some lake is going to get loaded up??"
6655558,prov1800,2022-05-12 11:19:00,5010,Eck this water goes into Clay Lake and system is loaded fish.Normally can fish right under railroad. Walleyes come rifht up to there to spawn.Used to take my kids there when season opened and be nothing to catch so many fish there you woukd lose track how many you woukd catch.Same goes for Clay Lake and the 25 mi of water.They had mercury dumped into the system from dryden paper mill years ago so eating fish is up to the individual.Guided many years there and ate some fish.???.As far as fishing goes its one of the top fisheries in my book.Checked out North Star Lodge this morning and water definatly high.There store has water right up to it. Normally that water is at least 50 yds from the store
6655578,Eckohlt,2022-05-12 11:46:00,3685,"Crazy,sounds like clay is the place to go,just have to wry about glowing in the dark from eating fish."
6655580,Wawajake,2022-05-12 11:53:00,413,"Mercury does not cause glowing in the dark , but it does cause early on set of menopause in both women and even in MEN .....where your always hot or cold as your temperature is up and down !!! &#x1f609;"
6655584,prov1800,2022-05-12 11:59:00,5010,Thx for the medical facts.Seems iam good so far. Dont have any of those systems and fished there a lot.Know many people that also have and we are all good so far.
6655588,Kwhc,2022-05-12 12:28:00,4,In your opinion will ice be out most lakes by opener?
6655592,Knutson21,2022-05-12 12:29:00,348,"My Grandmas cousin is 91 and has fished Clay Lake/Wabigoon River his whole life and has eaten a lot of walleyes from the system. Maybe its the cases of beer he has washed his system out with but he is still kicking. When we go to the cabin there we eat a couple of meals of walleyes, so I hope to have the same longevity as he does. Does it concern me yes, but I am guessing the 10 eater size walleyes I eat there every couple of years won't affect me. Ha"
6655594,jambi,2022-05-12 12:37:00,504,Quite a contrast to your other video showing how low the water was (From March 20th 2021 though):https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cX-o0lfcxAk
6655598,N_of_Quibell,2022-05-12 12:57:00,151,I think that bridge was already slated for replacement this summer - perhaps the timetable will get moved up a bit. Denny
