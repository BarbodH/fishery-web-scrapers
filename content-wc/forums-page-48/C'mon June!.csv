6655320,NM_Trout,2022-05-11 16:21:00,1094,"I note that the webcam on Lac Seul shows receding ice on a daily basis. I'm guessing that Red Lake is just a little behind. With weather above (mostly) freezing this week, along with the rain, I'm guessing Red Lake is clear of ice in a week. Now if the roads just stay open :-)"

6655354,PhilTickelson,2022-05-11 18:42:00,84,I sure hope so! I'm due at Five Lakes Lodge on Gull Rock next Saturday. I'm pretty nervous that it's going to get pushed
6655366,Eckohlt,2022-05-11 19:04:00,3685,"I wouldn't pack yet,give it a week n see what's going on,gonna be touch n go situation,hope it's a go for you,resort owners need it bad."
6655374,Golden Eagle,2022-05-11 19:18:00,2642,"I'll be fishing a shallow lake that turns soft sooner than surrounding deeper lakes. Several times I've fished it while Howey Bay in Red Lake was covered with ice. I've also fished it when about half the lake was covered with ice. Fishing was outstanding. Minutes ago I emailed my outfitter that all but 2 of my party will be available to arrive at camp Thursday or Friday if there's a plane with empty seats to be filled. I'm pretty confident that 5 or 6 of us have a chance at frying a couple of 26"" pike Friday, May 20. I'm looking forward to my best May trip in several years."
6655376,Eckohlt,2022-05-11 19:28:00,3685,Keep us in the loop on condition up there Eagle.
