6654178,NVM,2022-05-06 12:31:00,107,"Obabikon Bay Camp in a protected area of LOTW. Took my family there a couple years ago and we had a great time. My two girls would go back anytime. Jared was a great host and sent to an area that we could fish weedbeds and we caught perch, walleye, bass, and pike. We went in July and the kids swam off the docks. Highly recommend."
6654200,PhilTickelson,2022-05-06 13:42:00,84,"Give Ian at five lakes lodge a call! It’s maybe a bigger lake than you’ve been looking at, but they are located in a very protected bay. Lots of walleyes and big northern. Also a great setup for families. They have horseshoes and other yard games setup, and a bunch of fun swimming stuff setup just a short swim from the dock. Water trampoline type stuff that would be a blast during a hot summer day. Ian will make sure you guys catch some fish while you’re there too, he knows the lake system very well."

6655720,farmnfish,2022-05-12 19:26:00,130,Indian lake lodge on a chain of smaller lakes just north of vermilion Bay. My wife and kids in the age range you're talking about had a great time there. Blue lake provincial Park is next door with the most beautiful beach and crystal blue water. Lots of side trips for rainy days too.
6655758,jsmyers,2022-05-13 05:25:00,198,I'd suggest Sleepy Dog Cabins on Wabaskang: http://sleepydogcabins.com/I'm sure the lake meets your criteria. I took two 9-year olds and a 6-year old there in 2019 and had a great time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OES3R_35VK8 There are a couple of other videos on that YouTube account of that trip. Here is my trip report: https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=695976How do I know Sleepy Dog did the trick? My 6-year old (who is now 9) has be pestering us about when we're going to go back to Canada!
6654002,oldlund,2022-05-05 20:02:00,209,"I might take the family to Canada this year in mid August. Any suggestions for a good resort, not huge water, for 6 and 9 year old? Ideally walleye, pike, maybe bass things that bite. My budget is fairly high for the right place. My only non negotiable criteria is that I can bring our boat. Thanks in advance.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"
6654014,RichA$1970,2022-05-06 03:54:00,1159,I have never been there but Vermillion Bay Lodge looks really nice and you can bring your boat. I think the owner is on this board so check out their website. Nice lodge and the grounds look good along with a reasonable family package deal.
6654020,fishin779,2022-05-06 04:27:00,63,"You might look into the Totem Resort in Sioux Narrows. It is a great FAMILY FRIENDLY place. They allow you to have your own boat, they have a guide service, really good food, etc."
6654050,gbeyes,2022-05-06 06:37:00,21,"Eagle Lake Island lodge is a really neat resort if you are looking for the all inclusive type of trip. they have guides available. includes fish cleaning, food, drinks etc. the lodge is nice for kids if weather is bad. Cabins are very updated and super clean. Food is excellent, and the bar has all the top shelf stuff you might want. https://eaglelakeislandlodge.ca/"
6654076,prov1800,2022-05-06 07:54:00,5010,Pretty much all camps let you bring your own boat.Check out KCs Landing on Edward Lake.Part of the Indian Lake chain of 7 lakes.Not huge but long enough for fun boat rides.Pretty clear water lake.1000 ft of beautifull beach and lot of water toys there for kids and water trampoline.Very good fishing for all species.Good docks and very nice cabins.Check their web out.www.clarksresorts.com
6654088,Duflebag,2022-05-06 08:35:00,218,"Oldlund, I have posted this reply to others looking for a camp that focuses on families rather than fishermen. I would highly recommend Stanley's West Arm Resort on Eagle Lake. I have known the owners for over 25 years. The resort was owned by Marv Wisniewski for years and has been run by his son Rob and Rob's wife Chantel for quite a while now. Stanley's is one of the only family resorts that I know. There are a lot of things to do for the whole family. I have recommended Stanely's to many friends that wanted to bring their family up to Canada and not have the rest of the family not happy because you are in a strictly fishing camp. I am not related in any way to Stanley's other than being friends with the family for going on 30 years now. I go to another camp for my fishing trips but I recommend Stanley's for anyone looking for a family oriented family resort. I hope your family has the trip of a lifetime."
6654096,walleyecheek,2022-05-06 08:58:00,2231,Totem & the others mentioned are on pretty BIG water. I would suggest Arrowhead resort in Nestorfalls.
6654140,Carnhzkr,2022-05-06 10:39:00,964,"A lodge that I have recommended over the years to dads wanting to bring their young kids on a first Canadian trip is Wenasaga Lodge a few miles north east of Ear Falls. I've been going to Canada fishing for many, many years, but this was the first camp where I took my two sons and wife on our first family trip. As you can relate, that first trip was designed around making sure my boys had fun, as I was hoping to cultivate a lifelong interest so they'd continue to be my fishing partners when they got older. If you follow the river that comes in on the upper part of the lake, there's a spectacular waterfall. What kid doesn't enjoy hiking along the falls and fishing the pools? We had a couple of picnic lunches in this area. Where the water goes out on the southern end is another fun spot where the kids can climb along the rapids and fish below. When we went in 2004, I believe, when my boys were 6 and 8. At that time, the owners had access to quite a few smaller lakes that you could drive and hike into. Some of those small lakes were loaded with small pike. Those days were highlights for my boys. One rainy morning, we stayed off the water and went in to Ear Falls to have a look around and got ice cream. The lake is about 7 miles long, so it's easy to navigate and the owners will help you find action. I only went there the one time. I've had better fishing, overall, but this place served its purpose for a nice camp for the family, and they had an attractive family rate when we went."
6654154,Yellowfin123,2022-05-06 11:42:00,2182,"a sandy beach with water toys would be a huge plus for those ages, assuming they're good swimmers.. they'd never forget that and you would be hero.."
6654172,walleyecheek,2022-05-06 12:14:00,2231,Arrowhead has an awsome beach with all the bells & whistles.
