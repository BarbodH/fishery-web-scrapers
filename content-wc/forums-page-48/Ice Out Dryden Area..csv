Last year water was the lowest its been for decades with an early ice out that had us fishing from the boat in April for walleye, to this year with the highest water levels in decades and a late ice out. I'm not sure whether i'm more anxious about losing my dock or to get in the boat, both actually, if i'm honest. I feel for those of you who have trips planned and are wondering if the ice will be out. I'm gonna say on Wabigoon and any similar shallow lakes in the are that you will be FINE for the 21st. Might bump into the odd bit of ice here and there but you'll be wetting a line, probably be able to do some trolling on Hwy 502 on the way up....lol. Ice is going fast, and we have some HOT, WET and WINDY days ahead. I was ice fishing on the skidoos last thursday and my son was swimming this evening after school...he's nuts, I know. I went off exploring this afternoon and all the small lakes are open in my area south west of Dryden. I'm on Wabigoon, there is open water at the mouth of the river and Govt. Dock and our back bay is wide open, and its usually a week to 10 days from there for ice out, which takes us right up till opener, but she'll be open. Might still be an issue for fly ins, but its looking good!VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/dpk9FEPXaMQ"
