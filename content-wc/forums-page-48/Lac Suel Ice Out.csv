There will be some fishable water around Sioux Lookout on opener but in my opinion, a lot of Lac Seul will be inaccessible. Here are some pictures from the Deception boat launch, taken today (Saturday May 10), 1 week from opening day."

6655234,Sorelips,2022-05-11 08:56:00,5,Yeah not good for the opener I'll bet Deception and Lost Lake boat ramps will be like parking lots on the opener. We're not due there until the 28th may have dodged a bullet this year.
6655238,schoolofhardknocks,2022-05-11 09:24:00,29,"We are due to fly into Keike from Pickeral Arms on THE opener...touch 'n go. Packing now, but talk about stress. I'll update here as I get a report and appreciate anyone else who adds to the conversation.Latest as of 5.5.22:https://www.benbeattieoutdoors.com/"

6655270,danvan18$,2022-05-11 12:40:00,67,I hope you get in- been to Keike many times and you will catch a ton of fish. Good thing- very short flight. If you see my yellow marker buoy floating in the second bay across from the cabin it's yours! Forgot it last September.
