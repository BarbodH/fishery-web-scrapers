6654786,kim n indiana,2022-05-09 10:26:00,62,"get something like lake fork baby ring fry or creature bait. You can lay that hook right into the rings and it makes it very effective in weeds. I fish private pond all summer that is chock full of weeds, and its the only way i can fish it. I still lose too many fish when they go down into weeds but that's another story."

6654536,Eckohlt,2022-05-07 18:26:00,3685,It will be solid alright when they set the hook on a pine tree log.
6654542,prov1800,2022-05-07 18:31:00,5010,Be exciting for a second.
6654546,Eckohlt,2022-05-07 18:36:00,3685,"Yup,it's always exciting when you set the hook on something solid,,,,it's like OH BOY!!! Here we go.But most the time the only thing that goes is your jig,,,Gone."

6654626,Eckohlt,2022-05-08 10:07:00,3685,That be a good spot to open a tackle shop.
6654630,prov1800,2022-05-08 10:17:00,5010,Would suggest to anyone that fishes in wooded/rock areas or weeds to go with a good weedless jig which will save you a lot of jigs.
6654638,Eckohlt,2022-05-08 10:47:00,3685,"Or don't go to a lake where you have fish in timber,that's what I would do."
6654640,prov1800,2022-05-08 10:56:00,5010,"Eck.i havnt found a lake yet in NWO that doesn't have rocks,weeds,timber and sunken timber yet."
