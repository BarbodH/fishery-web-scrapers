Last year, roughly 10 miles from camp, main engine battery was dead trolly motor batteries to low to jump start engine. Thankfully still had cell service and called the camp. Pete came and jumped our main battery and got us back. He then loaned us a spare battery to take in case of it happening again. That is only one example how they treat guest. Good luck all, safe travels and happy fishing!"

6654156,krazyk711,2022-05-06 11:42:00,26,Lunge fest is when we go catch a bunch of muskies ! along with lots of big pike and smalleys who also like to munch on the bigger baits ..

The hosts Tom/ Margaret will go above and beyond whatever it takes to make things right for your visit. The cabins are the best I have ever been in in Ontario(just look at the website and see how the look) and the boats are larger than many camps and I have never had an issue with one in all the times I have been here. The pizza night is a great time to gather with all the other guests. Two of us were up last August and the fishing was exceptional and we are back in July to see if it was the time of year or the two years rest they all got. I am thinking about coming back late August if their is an opening.The wife says their is no reason to look for another place as this is perfect as far as she is concerned. Later, Jay"
6655094,Bobber1,2022-05-10 14:33:00,10,"Like all of you, we're really excited to make our 1st Ontario trip in 2 years. The last week of June, heading for the Mashkinonje Resort on the West Arm of Lake Nipissing, the 3rd largest lake entirely within the Province. Wiki-P suggests there are over 40 species of fish; our targets include northern pike, walleye, smallmouth bass and sizable muskies. While most of our efforts will be concentrated on the West Arm (check it out on a map - very cool water complex), we'll spend a few days chasing smallies around the islands where the West Bay joins the main lake. Although not a likely choice destination for those from the midwest, it's ""only"" a 14-hr drive from the Philly area. Having grown up in the 60's in Duluth, I dearly miss the close proximity to Canada, but I do plan to return to fish Leech in October."

In remission now, thought I better get him back up that way. I'll prob get up to the great lakes this fall."

6653478,bthomas3333,2022-05-03 15:32:00,465,It's an insane Summer schedule but after losing 5 trips to Covid going big this summer: Fishing Cree Lake/Saskatchewan (Broken Arrow Camp) for a week mid June. Should be pretty much prime time for Trout and Pike on big water. First time there. Already rebooked for Sept 2023. Super great owner who is literally killing it by taking an old camp and refurbishing everything and yet leaving it as an outpost that fits more pocketbooks. Returning to fish the Innoko in Alaska in late July. Going to try Midnight sun this time. Only made possible by all the cancelled trips and money leftover from 2020 and 2021. Should be a bunch of nice pike in need of dental work. Fishing Taltson Bay camp in Sept. This is a return trip to one of my favorite spots and again the prime target is big pike. Good luck all! B-
6653486,danvan18$,2022-05-03 15:55:00,67,As we have spoken Rod- you will enjoy Wapesi (2X for me and nice size wally's) and Keike (probably 20X) with Pickerel Arm Camp. I hope to get back to Wapesi sometime. Went to Keike last September and fish were aggressive and bigger than usual.This year going to Otatakan in June- haven't been there in 15+ years-another lake stuffed with walleye and an awesome cabin.
6653488,danvan18$,2022-05-03 15:59:00,67,We had some great trips with Ghost River- fond memories going to the many different lakes they offer. I liked going through the tunnel to Clamshell and then portage to Rock. But we started to do fly-ins and got hooked on those.

This will be a family trip with my wife and one son. Late July, I'm taking my wife to Witch Bay on Lake of the Woods. Never been there, but it sounds like a first class lodge with American plan, and the type of lodge my wife will enjoy. I want her to enjoy it so she'll keep coming on these trips with me. Mid-September I'm taking my two sons to Lost Island on the eastern side of Lac Seul. I've never been here either, but this lodge has been on my list for a long time. I'd appreciate any help I can get on fishing this area of the lake. I'd sure like to squeeze in a 4th trip, but it'd have to be early, like May, or late, like October. Anybody have an open seat for an early or late trip, let me know!"

It was on one of those time heading toward Carling that I first saw the Winoga cabin. i believe it was built in 2006. I've stayed there every year since 2007. Prime fishing is 10 minutes away instead of an hour."

Staying in our favorite cabin (Wolf). This is our favorite place, mostly because you don't have to be too great a fisherman to catch a trophy! Back up to Wine Lake for the July walleye frenzy. We will catch literally hundreds of walleye with minimal effort. We will be staying in the IceHouse cabin which is small but new. Need the skeeter spray for that trip! September is for Wildewood on Lake Savant for the second year. We had a great time there last year and couldn't think of a better place for that time of year. So glad for the opportunity to fish in Canada again this year. We are going until we drop! Fish On! Hooks"

We still have room for 1-2 more people to add to our group if anyone is interested.

Amazing People own and run the camp (Kartinens) for multiple generations Beautiful lake/river system. Hard to imagine anywhere more scenic and peaceful Drive-In, boat-in remoteness. But, camp has wifi for email, calling home Lots of Portage lakes to explore Easy Walleye fishing. Haven't targeted Pike there but have caught lots Walleye fishing. 150 pound allowance (v. 100lb fly in) is a bonus for bringing nice to haves"

I am going to golden hook on Gullrock. Have fished Gullrock for many years. I feel like the walleye fishing seems to be better further north. Have stayed on other camps on Gullrock and they are very nice. Golden Hook has great cabins and upgraded boats. Red Lake is not far and we buy all our groceries and beer there. Been 40 years or so going up and other than a fly in, gullrock has produced the best walleye fishing for me. I am always on the lookout for something new and different though. I wish you all amazing, hassle free trips this summer."
6653328,nitroman,2022-05-03 07:56:00,368,"June 5th week headed to Nestor Falls to fish crooked Pine for a few days just the wife and I. Stayed at Arrowhead before overnight on Fridays but decided to try and fish the lake for a few days. Then on June 11th headed back to Cedar lake for our annual week with the group. We have been fishing the same lake/camp for 20 years. Love it! We know the lake and do well each year, love the owners and generally just enjoy the week there. I don't look for anything different as I love the rustic basic camp. We just need a dry place to sleep and a dock for the boat with power to charge the batteries. We all bring our own boats but the camp boats are just that with the opportunity to upgrade deluxe boats if needed. Cabins are the basic osb interior with bath, shower , kitchen and such. We sit at the top of the horse shoe on the lake which provides opportunity to try either leg of the lake. Walleye, pike, perch, crappie, Muskie, whitefish to be had! After 20 years we have all our sots down and always have a great week! also after 20 years I have become more interested in watching my wife, kid, nephews, new guys catch the fish. Don't get me wrong I still want to catch em all but I really find a lot of joy in watching the kids catch a fish of their lifetime as well as my wife. I honestly wouldn't recommend Cedar to any of you, terrible place to fish and the bugs are really bad nearly all season. (wink)"

We have been going for 10 years besides 2020. Come by chance resort is where we stay usually or Ole's resort. Cabins are nice, scenery is nice. There is a general store about a mile away for anything needed during our stay. Can't wait to get back there for some good fishing. Good luck to all wherever your headed."
6653334,stjoeguy,2022-05-03 08:12:00,979,"Two Canada fishing trips are scheduled for this summer, both on Lake St. Joseph, Ontario, about 130 miles NE of Sioux Lookout, just south of Pickle Lake. The June trip is to the Winoga Lodge outpost cabin on Ice House Bay, where I've been going since about 2007. The August trip is to the Slate Falls Outposts cabin on Root Bay. I usually try to try new spots on the August trip, but we had so much fun at Root Bay last year that we decided to return this year. Obviously, the fishing is great, but another aspect that I really enjoy is the solitude. Both cabins are 20 miles from any other cabins. The feeling of having the whole lake to yourself is great. A couple years ago, when Winoga added internet access, I wasn't real pleased, because I liked being totally out of touch with the world for a week, but I've gotten used to it now since it allows keeping up on Walleye Central!! At least they haven't added TV (yet). The trips, and Walleye Central, have also let me build up a group of great fishing friends from all over the country over the years and I look forward to fishing with them every year. Thanks for the good wishes and may your trips be amazing and hassle free, also!!"
