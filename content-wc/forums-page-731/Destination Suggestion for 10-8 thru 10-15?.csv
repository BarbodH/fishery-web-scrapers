Requirement #1 is that this must be in Ontario or Quebec - no more than 600 miles from home here in Ohio, so NW Ontario is out. Would love to go there, but too much driving. Rquirement #2 (from the boss) is that we have indoor hot shower since her health is not good. Requirement #3 is that the place must permit us to bring our labs so I might do a bit of duck hunting too. They sleep in kennels, not running loose in someone else's cabin. Requiremnt #4 is that we can have some good walleye fishing. Please make suggestions because most places are either closed or only interested in booking moose hunters at that time. Best wishes, O F"
