552022,JohnAB,2005-09-12 08:01:00,49,"Stehle and GaryL, When we were out at Kawaweogama ( month of July )we were catching fish by the Cigar Island in 2 to 4 feet of water. Barney also was pulling them in there in the same depths. Pulled a 37 inch pike out of those depths as well. Did find however, that the fishing this year was a bit slower than the previous year which I think was due more to the hot temps we had the first two and a half weeks we were there. Surface temp of the water got up to 82 F on my fish finder. Caught my biggest walleyes in the deep trough behind Star Island trolling a larger crankbait. Walleye was 26 inches in length. Fish finder marked a lot of fish in that trough during those hot days which is not surprising. One downer was the lack of minnows we were catching at the Minnow Lake for bait. Not near as productive as previous years I am told. Bonus on this years trip was learning how to navigate the rapids to Barney's camp (bought a boat motor from them)and we portaged into McEwen from behind Star Island. You both missed the big event in Allanwater in July as a wedding was held there and there must have been a good 200 people out for it. GaryL, was great meeting you, next time we will have to share a boat. Stehle, one day we will have to coordinate our trips better so we too can meet on Kawaweogama."
552039,Stehle,2005-09-12 16:10:00,95,"Yeah, it would be great to finally meet you. We had a decent time this year and caught several fish. My boat partner was kind of a downer, but I won't have him next year. I did enjoy out fishing him every day, though, but he did get the biggest Walleye of the group. I have word from my family that he may not be back, which would be a plus for the whole camp. Maybe it was because I didn't take the fish off his hook? Overall, it was an average year for fish catch with the exception of the freaky 2 day period of the shallow water bite. However, my boat partner really killed the week for me. I guess that's the breaks."

552062,JohnAB,2005-09-13 19:12:00,49,"Stehle, Bummer on the fishing partner woes. That can ruin a trip in no time flat. Only woes I had this year was with boat motors. First night at camp the switchbox went in my Merc 7.5. So got out the 9.8 horse Merc only to have it overheat constantly. So I had to take the switchbox off of it and put on my other Merc which got it running fine. For the second boat I dug out Carl's Chrysler but the carb was absolutely gummed up so had to tear it apart and clean etc before it would run. For how old it was, that motor sure worked fine but was underpowered as it was only a 6 horse and just barely made it up the rapids at Allanwater. I also bought another Merc from John and Barney while I was there. Thing ran great for 2 days then went south in a hurry. Thing would not run right at all. Kudo's though to John for his hard work on it and he finally got the thing working great but unfortunately it was our last night there. Next year it will get a work out. Must say John and Barney are some real fine people. Always pleasant and willing to help. Do you always go up the 3rd week of June? We are looking at once again at getting out there first part of July and staying for 3 weeks at the cabin. Sure noticed a lot more boats out there during July then what I saw in my last trip in August. One week everyday at noon there was a group of ten boats on the backside of the Island having shore lunch. Pleasant group of fellows. Email me at [email protected] as I would like to discuss fishing spots with you and GaryL."

552113,Guest,2005-09-14 15:39:00,0,"Took my son out with me. I ran the boat and he ran the rods. I watched him catch alot of fish and I remembered my Dad saying ""No you fish, I've caught lots of them, I just want to watch you."" I know what he meant now. That was my bext day in the last 10 years....Kerry"
552117,Guest,2005-09-15 01:41:00,0,"best day we had was 140 walleyes in the boat, biggest was 26"" and many in range of 22 to 24"" on lac seul on the nw part of the lake fishing out of Lac Seul Evergreen Lodge. We were in Ghost Narrows by a big square rock, 23 miles from camp, It is on the east side of McKenzie Bay, had 2 days over there with over 100 walleyes in the boat. I go by jjfurs on here, just too lazy today to sign in"
551951,Guest,2005-09-07 13:24:00,0,Little early for Cabin Fever but it will be here soon enough. To help stave it off tell us about your best day on the water this year.
551963,Guest,2005-09-07 21:20:00,0,Best day we had on the water was in June on Lac Seul. We got on a couple of spots that let us literally catch fish all day long. We didnt catch any real big fish but we caught loads of fish slot and above. Both spots produced fish for us the last two days we fished them and it turned out to be the best day and week I have ever spent on the water catching Walleye.
551965,Stehle,2005-09-08 05:25:00,95,One wierd day this summer on Lake Kawaweogama(near Savant Lake) we were catching fish from 2'- 6' of water. Doubles were so common that you couldn't count them all. I had one Walleye that bit my spinner rig as it dangled over the side of the boat (while helping my boating partner). It was just freaky...a true Walleye feeding frenzy.
551967,Guest,2005-09-08 07:53:00,0,"We were on LOTW in July and we were dragging bottom bouncers with minnows off a wind blown point. We were fishing in 15 to 20 foot of water and with three of us in the boat we had doubles and an occasional triple on hook ups. The good fishing lasted all day long and most of the fish were in the 22 to 24"" range. I dont know exactly how many we caught but it was the most I have ever seen put in a boat. We went back the next day and the wind had changed enough that they had moved out. That day made our week a huge success and I cant wait to get back to that spot next year. Who knows maybe they will be there again."
551970,Guest,2005-09-08 08:38:00,0,"Stehle, We fished the same lake in July and had a few days with similar results but not that shallow. We were fishing the windblown side of Cigar islands in 10-12 feet. Where were your fish? Gary"
551974,Stehle,2005-09-08 11:33:00,95,"Gary Believe it or not it was the opening to the back side of Star Island. The opening that is closest to Cigar, not the first one nearest the big water. It was really wierd. The fish weren't very big with the biggest around 20"", but most 14-17"". They could see our boat and everything....they were in some sort of feeding frenzy. Cigar is one of my frequent stops on that side of the lake. If they don't bit there, I head to the islands south and south east of the Cigar opening. The island south (about 3/4 mile from Cigar) has a long shoal that protrudes some 150 feet from the island. The wind can hit that shoal from either side and provide real good fishing prospects. The depth goes from 4-6' down to 20' in short order. Very similar to the opening between Cigar and the other island. The island southeast of Cigar (square shaped island) can get hot as well. It makes for a nice round robin between the three islands to find the walleye. Thanks for getting my head out of work for a while....I guess I'll just have to look at my digital pix again to fully reenergize my spirit."
551975,Stehle,2005-09-08 11:35:00,95,I meant the square island southwest of Cigar...Southeast is mainland.
551976,Guest,2005-09-08 11:44:00,0,"This is how screwed up my sense of direction is when I'm up there. I just looked at Google's map of Lake Kawaweogama and realized that those islands are in fact due West and North Northwest of Cigar. To check it out go to http://maps.google.com/ Put Savant Lake, ON in the search. Click on Satelite. Pan due east and you'll see a great shot of the lake."
551978,Guest,2005-09-08 12:00:00,0,"I fished that same island for the first time this past trip and had pretty good success. I know exactly the reef you're talking about. 2 years ago we found a tremendous amount of walleye in front of Star right in front of the cabin near the shallow weed bed. However, there wasn't much size. How did you do in the river this year? There weren't any Walleye in the river which is usually a guaranteed success."
551980,Guest,2005-09-08 12:42:00,0,"The river was my goto spot when I needed a good slot fish for the freezer. My partner caught a 26"" fish there and I got a 25"". A front moved through on us and the walleye moved from the 8-12' depth range (on the outskirts of the current) to 12-20' depth near the tiny island in the mouth. I was bouncing 1.5 oz near that island and would go from 12 - 20' within a boat length. Letting out line like a maniac, I almost always got a bite. We've always fished the third week of June and the walleye are still in their post-spawn areas before it gets really hot. The lake has several places to catch fish and generally speaking, if one spot is cold another will be hot. Behind Star are several points to be fished. I have 5-6 places that I hit frequently behind Star. 5-6 that I hit in Lake McEwan. 4-5 spots near Cigar and 2-3 spots in the big water. If you go up the river and into Sunray Lake, there is some good action at the mouth of the river going into Sunray. And if you haven't done it yet, travel up the river even further to the rapids, beach your boat near the trail and hike to the rapids with your jig rod. Very Fun Action. I use wobble jigs and curly tails. The initial bite is always hot....leave em alone for a while when it dies off and then hit again....tons of fun."
