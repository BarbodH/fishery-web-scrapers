551966,Guest,2005-09-08 05:56:00,0,I have a four year old Garmin and it worked fine. Anything new would be better technology than my old one so I cannot see you having any problem..

If you are just looking for something to use so that you dont get lost, then just go to walmart and get one of the cheapest ones they have and it will do the trick. Stevewww.ManitobaAnglers.com"
