552130,Guest,2005-09-15 12:03:00,0,"Actually golf is for guys who have enough resources to golf, fish, hunt and basically do whatever activity they like. P.S. a little physical activity i.e.golf, offsets the general inactivity of fishing and provides the much needed balance most of us strive for in our lives."
552009,Guest,2005-09-10 12:04:00,0,"Once upon a time a man asked a woman to ""Marry Him"" She said ""No"" He went fishing, hunting, golfing and drank beer and lived happily everafter."

552026,Guest,2005-09-12 10:36:00,0,"I have a differnt version...in your version the guy gets to know his right hand too much. A man asked a woman to marry him. She said yes. She loves the outdoors as much as him and urges him to go on at least two trips a year with the guys, as well as the other outdoor trips with her. She loves boats and makes him buy a nicer boat and she is now bringing home RV pamphlets. He lived even happier ever after."
