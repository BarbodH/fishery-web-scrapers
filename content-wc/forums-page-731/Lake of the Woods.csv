The trick is I am bringing wife and three kids. I could sleep in the boat for a week if I was catching fish but they need some comforts. Looking for someplace that caters to families, ,, beach, activities, etc."
551912,dewyg,2005-09-03 22:10:00,1006,I live in Kenora and can get you a deal on a cabin with a beach etc... great family place with an american plan. Drop me an email if you are interested dewyg@ yahoo.com.

They have a sand beach, paddle boats, a slide, camp fire at night, within easy walking distance to Helliars Resort for an ice cream cone. Been going there for over 10 years now with the wife and kids and wouldn't go anywhere else. He also charges in Canadian(the way it should be). The cabins are very nice and clean and you get clean towels twice in a week. Can't miss the place, yellow cabins on your right as you cross the falls heading north in Nestor Falls. Give them a try."

Great place, got alot of fond memories there. Grew up in cabin #9. Paid $200.00 to stay in the boathouse per week. How much are the rates now? Just curious, takin' a trip down memory lane. Bo"
551935,Guest,2005-09-06 13:26:00,0,"Have to put in a word for Mylie's Place out of Morson. http://www.myliesplace.com We go up a couple times a year and bring the kids and grandkids every second year. They grandkids always cry when it's time to go home. Seandy beach, lots of floating docks to fish from. Canoe, peddle boat, store with candy, ice cream treats, frog catching, playground, etc. We almost need to book a second week to rest after a trip with the family. Rates and location are excellent and not far from the border at Baudette. The only tough part is making a new reservation. I see they have 2006 availability on their website and doesn't look like a whole lot left until August. Enjoy. FN"
551937,Guest,2005-09-06 15:41:00,0,"Yep the boat house is still standing and better then ever. They converted both the upper and lower to cabins. We stay in the lower one. The new boat house is across the ramp. Clyde and Decie are still there, she says they will be there until they bury her. They bought the house just above the camp and they live there now. The back half of what used to be their house is now a two person cabin. I believe the couple that rents that stays there year around. They do an amazing job. You have to book that resort for the next year before you leave or you won't get your cabin. They are full all summer and it is the same people year after year. They stay until November now to accomodate the deer hunters. I think that is the greatest compliment, repeat customers. My buddy has been staying in the same cabin for over 20 years now."
551938,Guest,2005-09-06 19:41:00,0,Here is a resort that should have plenty of things for the family to do besides fishing. They are on Lake of the Woods. http://www.redindianlodge.com
551941,Guest,2005-09-06 21:01:00,0,"I've been heading up to LOW for about 15 years. All of my trips have been family trips, the last 10 with kids. The most friendly family oriented resort would have to be Canadian Haven in Nestor Falls. The camp host have two fantastic kids. Numerous amenities for the kids on the boat dock and decent fishing. Check out their website http://www.canadianhaven.com"

However, it is not on LOTW. It is on the lake that dumps into LOTW at Nestor Falls. If that's not important to you, Arrowhead is also a good choice. I started staying at Arrowhead in 1953. Lots of great memories there. I still have a number of friends who spend the entire summer at Arrowhead. I now live across the bay from Canadian Haven, which is also a great place...especially for kids. You won't go wrong with either choice."
