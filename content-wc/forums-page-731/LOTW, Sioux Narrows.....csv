551939,Guest,2005-09-06 19:49:00,0,"Just got back from the narrows. Fishing was good but biggest were 3 approx. 18.5"". Most were 14-16""ers, good eaters. Was also up in July with most being eaters and 2 over 20"". In the last 4 years I'll bet my cabin (several different groups) have only taken 20 eyes over 20"". Thats a pretty sick average. What gives? we run out to Chisolm, Deadbroke, up south of the Barrier Islands etc. Fish the humps, shorelines everything!! With the gas prices it is just not worth the trip. It cost 2 of us $50 +oil to run out to Deadbroke and bring back 4- 14""ers for supper. Now, we don't keep anything over 17"" but is fun to get on some decent fish. About 5 or 6 years ago we up for a long weekend and had a hard time getting anything under 18""!!! About 30-40 a day from 19-25"" that was fun. Now considering selling the place. It cost $400 in gas for my last weekend!! Think the Canucks will wake up when tousands of other guys feel this pinch too? Now I'm not bashing Canada but they could do their part by making it more appealing!! Dennis"

We saw the same thing both north and south of the Barrier Islands. The big fish were not around this year. We DID have SOME success fishing on bars with big rocks on them extending out from windward side of islands during July. August and September, however, were different stories -- none of the big girls to be found. In other years we marked and found the big ones in ""normal"" walleye spots just like we found the small ones this year. I hope it is NOT the netting. I was thinking about that too. Why would netting take primarily the larger fish?? That doesn't sound right."

They told us that its getting hard for them to guide their guests to eating size walleyes and pike. We have been hiring these 2 guides every year for the last 4 years and know that they spend at least 2/3 of their season guiding people for walleyes on Sabaskong Bay. If its not the native netting thats making this change, what is it???"
