I must admit that most of the big fish I've landed on the Red and Winnipeg Rivers have been taken by trolling. However, that's what I have confidence with, and, of course, the more fish you catch, the more think that's the way to go. I would like to improve my jigging skills. We usually anchor in on what we believe is a good spot and jig 3/8 round heads with a salty. I would say we've been met moderate success. I've had good ( successful ) fisherman tell me the trick is to pound the bottom then lift and hold 4"" up. Then, I've seen guys jerkin the jig around like he setting the hook. ( and catch plenty of fish ) What about whistlers, rattlers, color, ect.? Is the old saying "" use the smallest that will get you to the bottom "" play on the rivers? Or, do you want a heavy jig? How about stingers? I'd be intersted in what some of you jiggin pros like best. I'm not looking for your secret spot, but thought this would be good discussion while we all dream of cool October days JS - 42 days till I'm there."
551812,Rat,2005-08-28 13:22:00,102,"So here's what I think anyway. On any given day jigging height will vary. My wife and I use different approaches from 4 ft all the way to zero (dragging). You have to experiment and then finally go with what is working at the time. This might also change during the day. That's why fishing is so much fun. In general jigs should be the lightest possible. Sometimes in river fishing that means a 3/4 or 1 oz jig. I'm not much of a fan of stingers because they can injure fish. Many times if fish are biting ""short"" it is because they are not creating a strong enough vacuum to inhale the jig. This can be corrected by dropping down jig sizes. As for color, I have seen close to miracle changes at times. You are looking for contrast in the water. This can also change as the day progresses and the lighting situation changes. Anchoring can be extremely effective but I like to move around with a trolling motor until I locate fish. Anchor once you have them located and be ready to move with the fish. I'm 12 days away from heaven. Practice CPR and have a good one. The Rat"

I always like to have either a flasher on it or some rattles to draw more attension in the muddy water. Most importantly keep the jig close to the bottom and use one of the two approaches. 1. Slow up and down movement of about 6 inches and let it pause.Keep the movement real slow. 2. Keep the jig 6 inches off the bottom and lower the jig every 20 sec. to the bottom. ring it slowly off the bottom and pause it. To me the color and size isn't as important as the jig. These to approaches have been the best for me the past few years, but things can always change.Just keep doing differant things until the fish let you know what they want."

551990,Guest,2005-09-09 10:07:00,0,"We do a lot of fishing in the fall for the Greenback run on both the Red and in Pine Falls. In the past we have run crankbaits and been successful. However, last year we consistently jigged for two days straight and were very successful. A 9.6 and a 10.6. The size of jig depends heavily on how the fish are biting but also on the current flow and how vertical you want to be. Last year, believe it or not we anchored up and were using 1 and 1.5 ounce jigs and had no problems getting the fish to take the bait in. In terms of how far off the bottom to be, you really do have to experiment and see what happens. We've had strikes when the jig is just sitting idle on the bottom and also when moving it around to trigger the fish. Sometimes they'll come up for it when lifting your jig up off the bottom and sometimes they'll take it on the drop. It's always good advice when fishing with a partner to start out trying two different techniques to see what's working better. If your on the fish and the bite is good, I don't have any problem anchoring up. If the fishing dies off, we'll pull up the anchor and move around 'til we find 'em again."
552018,Cornhusker,2005-09-12 00:31:00,104,"I agree with the heavy jig comment. Last we too used 1 ounce or better jigs and did better with them. Our group of 4 caught 14 fish over pounds, the bigesst being 13.7. Low to the bottom is key, however we did very well ""banging"" the jig on the bottom a few times and then barely lifting at all. I also think that color is the final factor in this kind of fishing, but it can make a difference at times.
