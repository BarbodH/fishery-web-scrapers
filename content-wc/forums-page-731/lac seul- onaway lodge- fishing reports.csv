552101,Guest,2005-09-13 22:40:00,0,"Sorry to take so long getting back to you. All of those spots are for Walleye, I don't want Pike in the boat so I don't even fish for them. They still seem to find me though. I chipped a propeller this year as well (first one ever), gives you a sick feeling doesn't it. As the season goes on, Broad and Sunlight don't produce as well as they do earlier. Although the ride can get interesting, I just don't bother. Send me your address, I have a really good map of all my spots marked from all the years. We get up in the morning, check the wind, then decide where we are heading for the day. And every year we go to at least 3-4 new spots, generally OK'd by Blair first, but we love exploring new water. My home e-mail [email protected]"

552110,Guest,2005-09-14 10:30:00,0,Thanks for the info. Will report on our catch when we get back. Will be there 9/24-28. Hope for decent weather. Anyone else with hotspots to try let me know. Thanks in advance.
552118,jjfurs,2005-09-15 01:51:00,16,"hot spot for walleye for us, over 300 fish in 3 days was at Ghost Narrows by a big square looking rock that sticks out of the water, fish the southeast side in 10 to 16 feet of water, it is an awesome reef. i believe this place is only a 3 mile ride from onaway"
551740,Guest,2005-08-24 12:58:00,0,heading north in a week. whats hot and whats not? what is the bite like? need to see if i need to buy any more equipment.
551751,Guest,2005-08-24 22:02:00,0,"Good Luck, you should have a great time. Blair and Kathy are the best, please tell them that Steve from Madison says hello. Be prepared to backtroll and jig. Everything that you need and didn't bring you can get at the Sport Shop in Ear Falls. Jigs, spinner rigs, leaded swivels and plenty of them....the toothy fish will break you off. If this is your first time, HIRE A GUIDE. It is alot of water and it is easy to get turned around, but best of all they will put you on fish and cook lunch to boot. Best eating in the world is a LS shore lunch. I have been going there for the past 6 years and it never disappoints. Blair will tell you what is hot that week but my personal favorites are South Inlet, Stoney Point, Ghost Narrows, and the bay of islands at evening, the sunsets are simply spectacular. Bring lots of film, you are making memories. Have fun...let ALL the Big ones go"
551778,Guest,2005-08-25 17:04:00,0,Just wondering . I also fish Lac Seul in the fall. Are the spots you mentioned for northerns or walleyes? Stony Point and Ghost Narrows have produced many northerns for me but little to no walleyes.
552028,Guest,2005-09-12 11:44:00,0,"steve, got back last friday had good weather and of as expected GREAT FISHING, had some big winds on tue otherwise nice chop. big walleye was 28.5 and northern 43+. all released to fight another day. blair says hi back at ya, this was our 2nd year, at his camp and he is warming up to us, 3 if you count next year as we booked for 06. thanks for the info and good luck on your next trip up there"

552048,Guest,2005-09-13 07:25:00,0,"LSfisherman- Watch the water levels are down 18 inches or so , we knocked out TWO lower units in less than 16 hours , one on a boat that we took up , then had to rent a camp boat and beached it on a rock pile in the middle of the lake, had to pay a grand to the resort for the one and the other will be replaced this week back home. we fished manatobia point twin humps @ 1:30 -3:30 fish stacked between 15-28ft. tried rocky point-- so-so , went into broad/ sunlight lake good fishing but be carefull we hit a stump in 5ft of water to claim one unit and heard of several others taken out not worth the $$ for the fishing . we fished out of scout bay area good luck"
