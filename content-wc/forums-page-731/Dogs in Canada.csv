552005,Ogoki,2005-09-10 07:19:00,291,"Proof of rabies vaccination from your vet. We take our dog and get her a three year shot and keep the proof in the truck with proof of insurance , registrations for truck ,boat trailer etc. Have never been asked for proof yet, not even this year when she growled at the customs agent. On a different note we take along the plastc bags that groceries come in to use as poop pick-up bags. Tie the top and throw in trash. We use them at areas where someone could step in it."

552008,rockpt,2005-09-10 11:41:00,589,"Also, do some research on blastomycosis, a fungul organism found in the soil in many parts of NW Ontario that can infect and kill dogs if not promptly treated. If your dog becomes ill after returning from Canada, tell your vet that you recently visited Canada so he will know to test for blasto and promptly begin treatment if the test is positive. Because blasto is much rarer in parts of the US than it is in Ontario, many vets may not think to test for it unless you tell them. Not trying to scare you or suggest you shouldn't take your dog with you (we've taken our dog on 13 trips to LOTW with no problems), but just be aware of blasto so you can be sure dog gets prompt treatment if he needs it."
