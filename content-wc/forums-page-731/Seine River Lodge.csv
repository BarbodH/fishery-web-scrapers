551820,Guest,2005-08-28 21:26:00,0,"Hi, Went to Seine River Lodge this past June (early June) with my son. The fishing was good (it was quite cold and the water was rough, yet we managed plenty of walleye--not much size but plenty of action, a few pike in the 27"" range, and a few 18"" bass). Because there was only the two of us, we were put in one of the older cabins--not much light and a few holes in the screens. If there are 4 or more of you, I'd highly recommend the upgrade to the newer units (satellite TV, while we had none, a full kitchen while we had a small cook stove, new plumbing, while our sink backed up several times). The boats and motors are well maintained and the camp was clean. Quent did an excellent job of taking us around the river system to show us the hazards and some good fishing spots (he took 2.5 hours for the tour--I was jumping at the bit to get my line in the water, but in the end, I was glad he took the time). The cabin, gear, and bait for the price he offers are unbeatable. Bottom line: I will be going back next year, hopefully with a buddy and his son (so we can get into the newer units). I do an annual fishing trip with my son (he just turned 15) and except for the previous year at Lac Seul, this was the best fishing we've had. Email me if you have any questions. Worldly Traveller"
