I have been seeing alot of positive reports coming from the Lorain, OH area of the lake. We will either head south for Ohio or east to Ontario. My personal choice would be Ontario simply because the beer is better. With gas prices being what they are we need to fish an area that has the likelyhood of catching fish. Question- Where on the northern shore of Lake Erie would be a good place to target walleye and steelhead. We are planning a trip on the first weekend in Oct."
