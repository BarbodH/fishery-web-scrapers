551948,nitroman,2005-09-07 11:06:00,368,My wife and I went to the race in Michigan and met alot of fellow race fans from Canada and alot of them had these cool collapsable lawn chairs. They were red and white with the maple leaf just like the Canadian flag. Well we have looked everywhere and the only place we can find them is canadian tire but they will not ship to the US so we were wondering if anyone lived close and could lend us a hand. We will send the money to purchase them and ship them if anyone up there is interested. If so e-mail me and we will set it up. Thank You Scott

Here are the links to them.http://www.canadiantire.ca/assortmen...romSearch=truehttp://www.canadiantire.ca/assortmen...romSearch=true Let me know and I will check if our Canadian Tire has any left.

551987,nitroman,2005-09-08 19:33:00,368,It's the second one with the arms on it. We live in central Iowa I can't imagine it would be too much to ship 4 of them if they were packed in a box. We have a place on the Mississippi river that we go to on the weekends and when we go to the sandbars everyone has the same walmart chairs in the same colors so we have been looking for some that are unique. Thanks Guy's Scott
