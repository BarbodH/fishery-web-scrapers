It is CJOB 680 - www.cjob.com You can listen live over the internet. They update the Winnipeg and Red River bites usually - or you can email or call in to ask how it looks. Lots of great local pros involved - probably the best live resource you'll find. BTW - two days ago reports on the program of one boat bringing in 7 greenbacks I think in the 2 - 4lb range, in the Red north of Selkirk. Good fishing gents! Pistol Pete PS - I was up at Pine Falls on the Sept. long weekend - caught my first Green. 11"" er. Rest were drums or local walleye - not long now!"
