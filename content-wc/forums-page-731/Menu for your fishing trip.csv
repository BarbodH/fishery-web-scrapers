552020,jerry bark,2005-09-12 07:49:00,822,"hey shoe, good idea to precook some entree items and then vacuum seal! in the past we have generally cooked fish for dinner, one or two shore lunches on days when we run far from camp(sandwhiches otherwise) and everyone brings their own breakfast foods. for me breakfast is a pepsi and a piece of jerky 'cause the fish are hungry NOW, let's go! i think I'll cook up a big batch of back ribs on my pit, a nice pot roast with veggies and some grilled chicken and vacuum seal them to be sure we have the week covered in case they arn't biting, or someone yells: i can't take any more walleye this week! like happened in '04. i need to work on a vacuum sealed dessert for shore lunch that i could then reheat by boiling in the bag, any ideas?? i tried this with peach cobbler leftovers once, not pretty. maybe some bread pudding would work if i don't vacuum all the way before sealing. i also like to cook in the dutch oven so we often do large ovens full of desserts to share with the camp operators (helps to get a better cabin for next year) or neighbors in camp. cheers jerry"

552033,Guest,2005-09-12 14:19:00,0,"just got back last friday and as camp cook for 11 guys, we had burgers/brats and homadefries, roast beef with sweet corn, 13lb whole pork loin with stuffing, chili with all the fixns,21lb turkey with garlic mashed potatoes, steak and baked toes along with fish every night sometimes deep fried, baked, poached, a big hit this years was deep fried veggies,onion rings,peppers, zuccini,egg plant, culliflower, mushrooms, even made 3 egg omlets one morning otherwise everyone is to full from the previous night to eat bkfst. i have been our camp cook for the past 11 years and always try something new each year. our food bill costs everyone 30-35 bucks a year for a week, #### i think that is the only reason that about 8 of them keep coming back with us each year, i also made a birthday cake for one of the guys this year, on the avg we all gain about 6-10 lbs as you always looking for something new to try- fish tacos are worth a try sodak"
552034,Guest,2005-09-12 14:20:00,0,Jerry Just make sure you freeze the soupy type of stuff before you vaccum seal it. We also take jumbalya. Shoe

552036,jerry bark,2005-09-12 14:51:00,822,"jambalaya would make an awesome shore lunch! two loaves of beer bread, real butter and add some fresh walleye to the jambalaya, oh yeah! i spotted a box of Zatarian's gumbo mix in the store the other day and thought that would make a good shore lunch as well, take along a bag of frozen veggies add the mix and some fresh walleye. thanks for the idea, maybe the peach cobbler would work if i froze it in butter tubs first then seal? time for an experiment.... cheers, jerry PS: being that my wife's not dutch i'll have to take your word that your oven is working the way you like!!;^)"

552121,wooglin,2005-09-15 07:19:00,371,"Pretty much just replace the beef with walleye and make the taco 'meat' as you normally would. We always use softshells just because they're easier to make at camp. They are pretty good, I tell ya that!"
551993,Guest,2005-09-09 14:52:00,0,"I've seen just about every topic discussed on WC,resorts,line,gps units,bait etc.but what do you guys and gals eat when your in the bush.Our menu is Polish sausage,dumplings,and saurkraut, roast beef and potatoes,fried walleye,steak and baked potatoes and a trip into town to try and help get rid of all that exess beer you canadians don't need lol."
551994,wooglin,2005-09-09 15:24:00,371,"We typically eat some beer-battered walleye every night, in combo with one or two different flavored fish. Those are lemmon pepper, plum glazed, fish tacos, fish pizza, orange/peanut flavored, ranch flavored, to name a few. Sometimes we'll bring some venison or beef steak, maybe some brats. Each night is usually accompanied by some foil rapped potatoes-n-onions and beans."
551995,IaDave,2005-09-09 16:02:00,476,"We have a deal where you are responsible for the menu for one nite and you do all the cooking and cleaning for that meal. Get quite a variety for 4 nites. The other nites are fish,potatoes and beans. We use to eat fish every nite but now we like something different once in a while."
551998,Frankm,2005-09-09 18:17:00,154,"We have deep fried Walleye with shore lunch breadng. Walleye Alfedo, and Walleye Sandwiches. For the rest of the week we have Steaks, Buffalo wings, Burgers, Spagetti, Chili. For breakfast we try and have something different each day. We have scrambled eggs and bacon, pancakes and sausage, bicuits and gravy, Eggs over medium with sausage, Eggs Benedict from scratch (next year we are doing instant), omletes. Half the fun for us is planning the meals. We of course bring lots of snacks. Beef jerky, beef sticks, string cheese, summer sausage, sharp cheddar and crackers, granola bars, twinkies, ho hos, cookies. Every year we try and do something new. We laugh because we eat better that week than when we're at home. No wonder I come home 10lbs overweight each year. The way we see it is it's vacation. Live a little."
552001,Guest,2005-09-09 19:50:00,0,"We're not into killing fish, so it's sandwiches for lunch and crockpot chili, spaghetti, tacos, bbq beef, ham for dinner."
552002,Guest,2005-09-10 03:44:00,0,"Its all about the eats up there. Big fish, Big eats. It seems that almost everyone has a specailty dish they whip up during the week outside of the standard canaidan plate of walleye, potatoes, beans, corn...which by the way my 5 year old loves better than ice cream as he noted this year. i tried the fish tacos this year with great response and have been toying around with a fish pizza but would like to know how you do yours. I always bring a bag of meat from what ever was in season to share with the weekend warriors. last year it was deer, wild turkey and bear. they seemed to make for some well appreciated red meat breaks amoung all the fish. grocery store there has good steaks now too, so grilling out one night is usually essential. as you have probably heard, walleye is not just for breakfast anymore. sandwiches, baked dishes, omlette, you name it. with all that you can see why every one does come back 10lbs bigger. packing sandwiches for the lake this year with good lunchmeat and canadian rye bread was a big hit as well as our 1st official in the ground ""pike bake""."
552006,Ogoki,2005-09-10 07:26:00,291,"We eat a big breakfast. Eggs, turkey sausage , breakfast rools, pancakes etc. Around four each afternoon we have fish and potatoes. We take along a tupperware container for slaw and keep in fridge. Some days we add baked beans. We go for nine days on the water and found that mid way thru the trip we make a couple pizzas. Eat the left overs the next day in the boat , then it's back to fish and potatoes. They never taste any better than fresh caught. Alredy have two trips planned for Canada next summer."
552011,Guest,2005-09-10 17:33:00,0,"We had to drive 45 minutes to the lake then unload the trucks and walk down to the lake and do it all over on the way back.We would bring a heavy lunch of samiches (5 different meats,3 cheeses)so you did'nt get tired of the same thing all the time.Then for supper we would have stuff that you could just heat and eat(smoked polish sausage,potatoe dumplings,saurkraut) zapped in the microwave.This year we are going to a place where the boats are on the lake so we will have more time to cook and try different meal options maybe even breakfast."
552016,Guest,2005-09-11 09:20:00,0,"On our fly in we can only take 100lbs. So we go with a lot of dried noodles and packaged cheese mixes. Mac and cheese,buttered garlic noodles, Oh and fish all five days. This is easy to do if you stop and think about what you eat during the year. Dried food saves weight for xtra beer... Good luck"
552017,Guest,2005-09-11 19:38:00,0,"As for our groups menu. For breakfast we make it simple and eat cereal at least 5 days. The other 2 days we will have sausage or bacon and eggs. Lunch is shore lunch or cold meat sandwiches and snacks. Dinner we will have fish and with our fish we will have pork chops, ribs, steaks, chicken, white chili, goose stew. Along with potatoes, beans, corn or what else we may have. What we do is with the dinner entres we will smoke or cook them at home and then vaccum seal it. So all we have to do is warm it up. It does wonders and saves a lot of time."
