NWO fishing bum if your out there please email me. scar"

I don't have time to respond right now, but will do so likely tomorrow. . . . I guess you have time to wait, Seul will be ice-covered for months yet! NWO Fishing Bum"

554525,JohnAB,2006-02-10 10:39:00,49,"scar, I have fished around Sioux Lookout at Sen Bay etc and can offer the following directions. To get to Sen Bay head down the highway to Savant Lake about 30 kilometers till you hit a road heading off to your left called the Vermilion River road I believe. Follow that road down about 5 or 6 kilometers or so. You will see two trails about 100 yards apart through the bush on the left hand side of the road. Take the second one down and you can launch your boat there. This is Sen bay. Trails are wide enough to get a vehicle and boat down no problem. A fair number of people use this area as it is the only launch onto Sen bay I know of. No charge here either as the site is not maintained although there is a floating dock there. As for another area have you tried Deception Lake just down the highway on your right from the Deception Bay launch point? You see the odd vehicle parked there and there is a launch site there but not a formal parking area etc. I fished it last year with good success for walleyes with the biggest one being just a hair over 27 inches. Deception Lake is part of Lac Seul so it follows the same regs as Lac Seul. I fished along the north east edge of the lake. Or you can try Blatchford Lake and the river east of Sioux Lookout. As you head out of Sioux Lookout past the Home Hardware do not turn left at the stop sign but go straight through it and then travel about 10 km's or so. Will see the launch area on your right hand side. Launches into the river. Can fish the river or head to Blatchford Lake or the falls at the end. Decent walleye fishing there. Hope this helps."
554678,Guest,2006-02-16 18:18:00,0,"Scar, I can't access your email, or even your email address through the site. I don't know where the other post you uploaded disappered to. If you want to talk personally, just post on here the info and I'll get in touch soon. Availability will probably be an issue. Specific location could be a long talk as well; I assume you don't want Minnitaki. I've had a lot of considerations put forth for my time this summer, some for all, some for parts, and some for days. I am certainly behind my normal timeline for determining my summer schedule/destination(s). Even the government wants a piece of me . . . and all I want is water with fish in it. I hate ice fishing. But yet I still blindlessly do it, which I can't really figure out??? NWO Fishing Bum"
