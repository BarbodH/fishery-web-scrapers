554531,Troutbeck,2006-02-10 15:34:00,682,My brother has a little 3hp merc (Tohatsu) 2 stroke. It's light and we've taken it to back lakes in Canada. It's a one cylinder so it vibrates a little but it works great. Occasionally you can find little old 3hp Johnsons (like from the 50s and 60s). Sweet little 2 cyl motors! Good luck.
554536,Lovetofish,2006-02-10 17:28:00,458,I bring up a 3.1 merc with a built in tank and carry an extra gallon of gas. Works great. Never had a problem. I do bring along a spare prop and cotter pin. What's really nice is my boy is now big enough to carry it! LOL
554541,phishfearme,2006-02-10 21:36:00,1242,how about a set of chest waders and simply get into the water and pull the boat thru tight spots. phish

554558,Guest,2006-02-11 19:45:00,0,"He is looking for something that weighs less than a maring battery. I looked in Cabelas and they sell 3.5 hp Nissan's, but they weigh 40 pounds and have a small gas tank included. Marine batteries are also about 40 pounds."

554595,Guest,2006-02-13 08:00:00,0,"What we have done to get around portages is we rigged up some big bicycle tires to metal arms and these attach to the boat. Two guy can pull a 14' boat full of gear with a 15 hp motor pretty effortlessly(as compared to unloading and carring everything). If it is a rocky portage the big tires help alot. And when we get to where we want to fish we can take off the wheels and they are not in the way. Where we go we have have about a 1/4 mile portage. We land the boats and load them with everything we need for the week, then drive a couple of miles to a 1/4 mile portage. We throw on the wheels and drag it over the portage, take the wheel off and boat in the rest of the way. The lake we go to is pretty good size so the larger boat and motor is nice once we are back there. We did this protage once without the tire rig and it was 4 1/2 hours of lugging heavy stuff around, by the time we were done we were all exhausted. Now it only takes 30 mins and no one is tired and we can bring extra beer and gas back there because we don't have to worry about carring it. It has made the trip much more enjoyable."
554643,Guest,2006-02-14 14:46:00,0,"They do weigh about the same, but what about the electric motor? The original statement was they were getting older and out of shape, and the electric motor/battery didn't last long. A small gas motor is the best solution, and if they are getting older and out of shape, as my group and I are; I promise you that finding a metal packframe with the little ledge thing is the easiest. Set the motor upside down on the ledge, make sure the gas line and vent cap are shut, and use a couple bungee cords. Take along a gallon gas can and you can run the motor all day if you want to."
554649,Guest,2006-02-14 16:58:00,0,The quad I have will not float. I believe that the floating thing is an urban legend. I have an older 400 Yamaha. We have drive it into a 16 ft lund and gone up the lake. Easy is the name of the game. The canoe is towed. I have only done this a couple of times. I have some back issues now and weekend warrior stuff is no longer in the cards. There are flat bottom boats now available that have a ramp for drive in and drive off similliar to a landing craft. Saw one at a boat show a few years ago. We did raise a few eyebrows with our rig and I did not tell my wife.:)
554500,Guest,2006-02-09 15:02:00,0,"My friends and I like trying to get lakes that are off the beaten path. We usually carry a marine battery and a trolling motor to power the boat that is at the lake we are going to. Well, we are all getting older and more and more out of shape. Do any of you have any suggestions on what would be the easiest way to power the boat once we get to it? We tried a dry cell battery once but it died very quickly. Do any of you know of a small battery that would give us several hours of power? Please remember that these lakes have no paths to them. To walk a mile usually takes a little over an hour. thank you, psrome"
554501,Guest,2006-02-09 16:07:00,0,"I do the same thing every year when I'm up in Ontario. I have found that it is much easier to find a small, light weight two stroke (2-4hp) motor with an internal fuel tank on it. One person can easily carry the motor with fuel in it. That seems to be easier than lugging a battery and a trolling motor along. Those small motors get very good gas mileage so you don't have to worry about running dry just for a day of fishing. The very easiest way is to take a canoe and paddle."
554507,Guest,2006-02-09 16:50:00,0,"I agree. 2-4 HP gas motor is lighter than a 12V battery, let alone the electric motor, and if it's windy, a lot better choice. Bungee it to a metal pack frame, and you should be able to strap a gallon gas can on, too."
554511,Guest,2006-02-09 18:37:00,0,"We portage in all the time. I have a rack on the quad that carries everything for those easy to get to difficult lakes, for the hard ones we carry in a 17 ft square stern with a 4hp. I use a small remote tank. I carry the motor on the shoulder and have had too much fuel spilled over the years so I don't like the tanked motors. I have also floated the quad across lakes with the bigger boat and then moved on to the smaller lakes. As I age I find that the smaller lakes are not as good fishing as they used to be. Better fishing close to the cottage:D"
554515,Trailerguy,2006-02-09 20:56:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I use a small two stroke with a self-contained tank. It trolls for over 4 hrs. on the fuel in the tank, I've never needed more than that on a portage lake. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
554518,Guest,2006-02-10 00:20:00,0,"Trailerguy is on the money with the 2hp. At my lodge I run 2hp Yamaha's all the time on my bush lakes. They are reliable, and run quite awhile. You could very well get through the entire week with 5 gal of gas or under. They are versitale enough for both trolling, and running to the other side of a small lake. If you want to use electric, I suggest you pick up a solar battery charger. They are very light, and will continually charge the battery. Not sure if one battery will do the trick for the week. But in the middle of nowhere, it will get it charged up for you. Small out of the way lakes are a very different experience. Many of my customers really have a great time with them. Course me taking them in with an ATV and trailer makes life easier, and then they get to sleep in a bed. I'm sure you already know to pack light. If you know where you are going, and what you will be fishing you can target that fish with a very isolated tackle box. Have a great trip! All the best, Greg Bolinski Agate Bay Lodge"
554521,Skylane,2006-02-10 06:47:00,101,"Good topic, these are some things that have been on my mind as well. What brand of small outboard are you guys using or would suggest? What kind of boat do you like to drag into these places? Do you use a trailer or drag it with the 4-wheeler if it is not a portage? Limiterr, I am intersted in the floating of your 4-wheeler. Would you mind telling how that has worked and any downside risks, such as tipping over or getting water in the engine-transmission? I have heard they will float but have not seen it done. Thanks."
554526,lenray,2006-02-10 10:54:00,467,Here is what we do. Have a 1.2 Tanaka from Cabelas that will shoot a canoe real well and also a 2 HP and a 3 HP. I am 61 have the V-10 Ford with the quads trailer etc. Take a younger MULE with you. They usually can't afford all da stuff but are excited about getting way up NORD and have the youth and strength to get ya back in there. Sometimes the MULE has a good memory and it doesn't work for the next year BUTTTT many MULES out there.
554529,Guest,2006-02-10 14:39:00,0,"I've used 2 and 3hp Yamahas. They are real workhorses. The 2's are air-cooled. The 3's are water cooled and a lot quieter,and also have a neutral which is nice, the downside is when you backtroll the water discharges into the boat, so you have to bail a little once in a while. Not sure who else makes small motors, but it would be hard to beat Yamama. If you make sure to shut off the gas line and the vent on the gas cap, they shouldn't leak too much when you portage them."
554530,Guest,2006-02-10 14:55:00,0,"We have been fishing portage lakes off old logging roads for about 12 years. Our original method was to bring deep cycle batteries and small electric motors. Over the years, we also got tired of lugging batteries and switched to 2-hp outboards. We run two old Evinrudes (mid-1970s) that still work great and a newer one. We usually are fishing out of 12' V-hulls that are fairly light and we can carry pretty easy. There is no lightweight battery out their that can power an electric motor well for several hours. I still drag the battery down to troll with on my favorite walleye lake where we think the gas motors are too noisy. Also, the electrics were a lot more peaceful than the gas, so I still occasionally drag one down just for a break from the noise."
