554625,Guest,2006-02-13 17:27:00,0,I saw the post on rain wear but i am bringing my 11 year old kid on his first fly in to Northern manitoba in late july. i can't find many options for rain gear for kids. I don't want to spend to much money as he will outgrow them in two years or so but i don't want to him to get drenched if it rains. Anybody have any ideas? Thanks. Duffy

Don't skimp on this portion of the trip, if they are uncomfortable it will not be any fun for them. We bought higher end life jackets also, they wear them all the time even when not in the boat. We have never had to fight with them to keep them on. Well worth the money. good luck"

You get a cold 11 year old, and you are on shore 15 minutes later. Get him a good rainsuit. Going cheap will cost you, and those plastic rainsuits almost make you colder. Not sure his size, but you can look at Cabela's and look at woman's small rainwear as an option. It does not look any different than the mens, just smaller sizes. Just don't get him the powder blue rainsuit, there is black and graphite or forest."
