554613,Guest,2006-02-13 14:57:00,0,"Absolutely. I have guided Lac Seul for years, albeit in the larger section of water in the centre of the lake. I challenge most new guests midday to point towards the lodge, or I ask them ""if something happened to me right now, how would you get back to camp?"" In most cases, they have no clue! Granted my section of the lake is far more confusing than near Ear Falls, AND my guests are guided everyday so they are not as worried about paying attention to navigation as perhaps they would be knowing they would later be on their own. Lac Seul is full of fish, but a guide will put you on them quicker, give you the right presentation(s), and show you not only structure to fish, but also structure that will cause you to need a tow back to camp if you hit it. I could provide countless examples . . . here's a recent one from September. There were three unguided boats from another lodge fishing an area I have fished alot. They really weren't in a great location (not on the spots-on-spots if you will), though I could see them catching the odd fish. I proceeded to start working a large sand break, where being out of position by as little as a boat length will greatly decrease fish production. After maybe 30 fish in an hour between the three of us, we went for lunch on a nearby beach. Because it was still ""hopping"" when we left for lunch, we went back there. The other three boats (not surprisingly) had moved almost to where we were. And (again not surprisingly) they were catching more fish, but the fish would come and go, because they were not working the structure properly. Because the structure break is very long, I pulled in further down. My guests were laughing because they knew the other boats had moved after seeing us boat so many fish before lunch (this is typical when other boats are within viewing distance). Anyway, I told my guests it was time for a clinic. We then started producing easily three times more fish than all three other boats combined, because of that specific knowledge I had on fishing that particular break (which I had fished four times previously that week; experience that no visiting fisherman could ever have). Most of the time, I just pack up and leave, nothing is ever said. On this particular day, as we were slowly pulling out and putting jackets on, etc., we were within shouting distance, and the one guy called over ""What are you using for bait?"" ""The same thing as you"", I responded (jig with a minnow). The guy then said, ""Yeah, we thought we were doing great until you guys pulled up . . ."", to which I simply responded ""Enjoy the rest of your day""! As I cranked up the motor, my one guest turned to the other and said ""That's why we use a guide"", to which under my breath I said ""Exactly!"" Yes Lac Seul is full of fish, and yes if you go unguided you will certainly catch fish (particularly if you have been there before). But what you think is good, is probably relatively crap, but you don't know any better. Even if you have been there once a year for 20 years, it can't replace having been on the water everyday that current year. And as was correctly mentioned previously, not only is it my experience, but I have the first-hand info. from 10 other guides who sit around the table with me and eat dinner, sharing all their information from that day on the water. No guest, no owner, no textbook, or anything else can replace that amount of first-hand knowledge from a group with that much theory and practical application on that fishery behind them. So the choice for a guide I guess is completely yours. But it's simply laughable, when people spend $400 on gas to travel, around $1000 for a 5-7 day trip, any food, possibly bait, etc., etc., but they contemplate dropping $125 on a guide for a day (per boat).

554614,Guest,2006-02-13 15:01:00,0,Sorry Wabby boy....Im not a guide just a guy who has fished for years and likes to see first timers on a lake catch some fish and learn what others are doing that is successful. I have seen what happens when a new fisherman wastes time trying to figure out the HOW'S of a new lake when a guide could have solved his confusion quickly. Im sure you have seen it on Wabby when you introduce new fisherman to the lake...its kind of like a deer in the headlights look. Bet you dont let them pick the spots without your help....right?
554615,Guest,2006-02-13 15:04:00,0,"And before Trailerguy jumps on me, I am paid the exact same amount, everyday from May to September, no questions asked, on-the-water or off-the-water, guiding guests or scouting on my own. So I have no personal intere$t$ in mind!! NWO Fishing Bum"

554619,Guest,2006-02-13 15:23:00,0,"in retrospect, i probably should have gotten a guide on my first trip up there. i can remember how frustrated my son and i were about noon of the second day up there. we probably wasted that much time before we found out how and where to catch eyes. we probably would have been doing that in 15 minutes on the first day with a guide."
554623,Trailerguy,2006-02-13 16:22:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]In my experience, if the outfitter doesn't know enough about the lake, or care enough that his guests to put them on fish, you picked the wrong outfitter. I've also never seen a guide that could make the fish jump in the boat on a ""bad"" day. On the otherhand I've never understood a fisherman that didn't have a good time without having caught a couple hundred fish over his limit. Generally speaking someone fishing a lake like Lac Suel is going to do fine on their own, if they are capable of finding their way home for supper. ;) Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
554624,Guest,2006-02-13 16:36:00,0,"The thing is, most people that are probably posting on this site are experienced fisherman, who know what to look for. I fish Lac Seul and took a break one year and fished Minaki a year, and was able to find fish because I know what to look for in Canadian Walleye. If the person posting asking about a guide has only fished Wisconsin, then he ABSOLUTELY needs a guide for the first day, and maybe more so he understands how to fish. Not everyone is an expert. Usually on my trips, there is one or two guys who come along who really do not have a lot of experience. I always get a guide on the first day and throw the newby's with the guide to show proper jigging, or bottom bouncing techniques. Guides do more than show spots. Good ones teach fishing as well. Tip well, and have a great time."
554626,Guest,2006-02-13 17:44:00,0,"I'm not sure if the resort owner was being less than helpful or honestly believes that you would be wasting your money. The root question might be, ""Should you hire a guide?"" IMHO, there is no one right answer. Its your fishin vacation - whatever works for you. (Just look at the differing opinions on this thread). ------ No Guide -------- Are you a group of experienced walleye fisherman AND are good ""big"" water boaters/navigators AND enjoy solving the fishing puzzel yourself AND are not afraid of the reefs AND are willing to invest in a learning curve? THEN you could skip hiring a guide. ++++++ Yes, get a Guide ++++++ Would you prefer to be shown some techniques and locations your first day, not have to worry about reefs or getting back to the lodge AND maybe someone cooking shore lunch for you? Then a buckandaquarter may be some of the smartest money you will spend on fishing this year. Concentrate more on fishing, less on boating and navigating. ...Babbeling on..... I've hired guides on a handful of long weekend trips where we didn't have the experience and wanted to get on the fish. We don't hire a guide on Lac Seul. Mostly because we were so used to Fly-In trips where part of the adventure is to master the fishing on your own. Not necessarily a better way, just our preferred way."
554631,Guest,2006-02-13 21:24:00,0,Thanks for your reply. It is very helpful. I do want to get a guide to teach us the area (ear falls) we are staying at. Do you have anyone you can recommend?
554634,orchard frank,2006-02-13 22:03:00,1900,"I've seen June on Lac Seul so cold we were wearing all the clothes we brought, other Junes so hot it was hard to sleep at night. I couldn't agree more with the posts that recommend a guide. Remember your $ investment and the time you have up there, a guide is good return on not much money. If you get hit with tough conditions or just want a day of on the water instruction geared toward the local conditions, it will help. You are also likely to get a shore lunch and a tour if you want it. (P.S. Take some Rapala Deep Husky Jerks in the ""Glass Minnow"" color, looks like a smelt, has been HOT for us in June)"
554638,Guest,2006-02-14 10:00:00,0,"Wabby Boy, You must be having a bad day. Fishing is not about catching tons of fish, its about the anticapation that you will catch fish because you are doing what needs to be done to catch fish....its the old hunter-hunted thing. Take a pill and let the man hire a guide....we all are not expert Walleye fisherman like you."

554640,Mike Kansas,2006-02-14 11:36:00,1463,"Our group of nine guys has been fishing Lac Seul for many years. My wife and I and several other couples also go to LS one week every year and I take several of my customers to LS for a week every year. While LS is a great Walleye lake and affords the opportunity for all who fish to have a great experience I still believe there are times that a Guide can enhance a trip with his expertise. All days on LS are not equal. A fishermans ability to catch fish depends on his knowledge of lake structure and the conditions that allow that piece of structure to have a high probabilty of holding fish. The proper presentation whether it be jigging,cranks,bottom bouncers,floats or flipping plastics is based on prior knowledge of that structure and the replication of doing what worked before. Time of the year is a big factor on LS. Your ability to follow the Walleye from its early season spawning pattern to its deep water late summer early fall hiding spots is a critical component to your success. The best way to know where the Walleye is in this pattern is to there every day just like most Guides are. I also believe that the wind direction on LS is a critical tool that you must utilize. I have spots that a west wind will put me on fish with a high probability of success. But that same spot with a south wind is no better than fishing in my bathtub. All these factors are important to me and the success of those in my boat. After all we all go fishing to have a good time with those who fish with us. Believe me there is no thrill like having someone who is new to Walleye fishing on LS hook up with a good fish. If a Guide is your cup of tea...enjoy it. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"

554709,Guest,2006-02-17 19:49:00,0,Curious when you guide on LS... What type of boat do you run?
554710,Trailerguy,2006-02-17 21:22:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Oh Yeah,:boozer: Another unregistered guest.......... I stand by the statement that if your outfitter doesn't know enough about the lake, or care enough about his guests to put them on fish, you picked the wrong outfitter. Catching walleyes in Lac Suel isn't brain surgery. Either the outfitter, or the guest fisherman would lack normal skills to be skunked at the end of the week. Like unskilled at putting a minnow on a jig. If a fisherman had a burning desire to fish his first day,20 miles from camp in unfamiliar waters, then a guide would be in order. Also if the weather was bad and the bite was poor, I'd consider a guide. On a normal week in June, if you just want to catch fish at a leisurly pace and actually enjoy your vacation and a little exploring, I'd just talk to the outfitter. I've never seen one that wouldn't help you out, ;) unless you already have him PO'd. Another real easy way to learn is to visit with your fellow guests at the end of the day, most people will give you honest answers. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

554627,Guest,2006-02-13 19:34:00,0,"I have fished Lac Seul for a number of years now and even in June when the fishing is pretty consistent, I personally like having a guide for all the reasons that NWO said. In fact, I can recall a couple of years back to back where the same week in early June was very different than the previous year. Point is, the guides are on the water every day and things do change. I only get one trip a year to Canada and its too important to me not to spend the extra cash to make sure I am on fish. I go with my father (70+) and one small child (under 13) and having that guide there when weather is bad, when making shore lunch, getting put on fish, and when learning new techniques, etc. makes the trip that much more enjoyable. LS is a big body of water and while I consider myself an OK fisherman, having a pro on board makes it a vacation, not an adventure. In the evening I get to take the boat out by myself and see if I can find fish and that is fun too, so I get the best of both worlds. Everbody has a different comfort level in their fishing and boating skills, so do what is right for you, but if my recommendation is get a guide for at least one day on a new body of water and if not, really spend time looking at lake maps and have a plan when you hit the water, remember 90% of the fish are in 10% of the lake. IA Walleye"
554630,voyaguer,2006-02-13 21:22:00,54,"I think Mr Sauger has it right, it depends on what you feel most comfortable with. Having guides can be a bit of a crap shoot, because there are very good ones and not so good. Last time I was at Seul, the guides didn't seem to take very well to US citizens, and it was a discouraging. However, one of my very best friends is a guide (who took me out about 50 years ago for the first time) and I would recommend guides based on him to anyone. I'm pretty much a loner. I want to stop where I want to and fish how I want to. I have been in these general waters for quite a while and feel fairly comfortable that I can find some fish, maybe not the most or biggest, and can find my way home without damage (so far, anyway). That being the case, I have gone out with guides from time to time, most often to learn navigation more so than ""where the big ones are"". You know, if you go out with a guide and don't like the results, then you can request not to go again with that person or any guide. Or, if the guide treats you well, and you enjoy the experience, then you should let the guide know and respond accordingly. Remember, these folks are part timers - you only can fish up there for about a 1\4 of the year, and some do it for the fun\experience and some base their livelihood on it. And the experience is not necessarily about the largest or most fish. When I think about my experiences with guides, regardless of the outcome, I think of the positive part of the trip. It is hard to go to these areas and not find a way to enjoy yourself unless you try. take care Phil"
554589,Guest,2006-02-12 15:31:00,0,"I am coming to Lac Seul for the first time. I am staying at a resort right by Ear Falls. I have not heard of it before on this website. I am coming the last week of June and the owner of the resort I am staying at tells me that I don't need a guide. Very strange. I tried to arrange a guide through them for the first day I am up there and the owner tells me I'm wasting my money. I just wanted to learn a few spots & presentations. Very strange, not wanting to help or take my money. Any thoughts?"
554590,Guest,2006-02-12 17:14:00,0,Call up Four Seasons Bait and Tackle in Ear Falls if no one can give you a name of a guide. I would highly suggest one to show you around and point out a few of the hazards. What resort you staying at?
554593,Guest,2006-02-12 20:56:00,0,I don't think you need a guide. I have never used a guide on Lac Seul and I catch plenty of fish and I have never lost a lower unit. My suggestion would be to get a good map and have the owner of the resort mark a few fishing spots and any hazards in the area. If you are moderately competent you will figure things out pretty easy. Use your locator to search for fish and don't fish 'em til' you see 'em on the screen. Good Luck.
554594,Skylane,2006-02-13 06:56:00,101,"I would vote for looking for a guide also. Everyone has different experience levels and we are not all experts. A good guide will give you some feel for the lake, what bait to use and how and where to use it. Despite some of what you hear from these forums, if you go in there cold, and don't have much experience, fishing may not meet your expectations. A guide might make the differnce between good memories and great memories. I would also caution that there are good guides and a lot of others that are not worth their salt. You have a lot of time, do your homework, find a good one, book him now and you will have a great time."
554596,Guest,2006-02-13 08:26:00,0,I would rather not say. I don't want to give them a bad name without giving them a chance. The resort is less than 2 mile from Ear Falls. Thanks for your help.
554598,Guest,2006-02-13 10:17:00,0,"jojo, the fact is that the resort owner is probably right. walleye fishing in june on lac seul is usually not a problem for anyone with any fishing skill at all. the owner should be able to put you on fish near ear falls and show you any hazards on a map. on the other hand, a guide can be very reassuring and comforting on a body of water as big as lac seul. he was just giving you his opinion. others would differ. i can remember my first trip up there and it took about a day and a half to get into a groove. i also remember getting lost within a couple of miles of camp back in the sanctuary area."
554601,voyaguer,2006-02-13 12:58:00,54,"I would agee with this, assuming you have experience with boats as well as fishing and have a good depth finder. Depth finder sure helps with finding the fish and avoiding damages to equipment. good luck Phil"
554608,Hump,2006-02-13 13:28:00,578,"Last year was our first on Lac Seul. We too were in the nw section. I didn't hire a guide. We were pretty wary the first couple of days , but caught alot of fish. As the week went on, we got more comfortable with the lake, but only went as far as Sawmill. This year I have hired a guide, for a half day. mMy intentions are for him to take us around the area, let me use my GPS( which I have no idea how to work at this point), and basically show us the hazards and really get to know that section of the lake. As far as the camp owner, he was probably telling you the truth. You can probably catch fish off the dock. Our owner told us of some people that have been there 8 years and have yet to go past the railroad bridge in the river."
554611,Guest,2006-02-13 14:02:00,0,"No doubt about it you dont need a guide on Lac Seul to catch fish....HOWEVER your chances of getting on bigger fish and larger quanitys of fish will go way up with a good Guide. After all he knows where,what,when and why and remember most Guides fish every day. They also talk to other Guides at night....information = fish.....and knowledge is king."
