We just put a plastic tail or power bait on with a crawler and fish with a vertical presentation. Last year in June we wore our arms out pulling in Walleyes from 5 to 7 feet of water in grassy areas.

Same goes with cranks. It depends what time of year you are there. Always have shad raps with you. My lucky lure is a #18 Original Rapala in the Flourescent Red/Gold. Will not go to Canada without a few of these to work the weedlines."
