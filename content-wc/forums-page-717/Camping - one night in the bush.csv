Thank you for taking the time to post this info. I for one very much appreciate your post. I am planing a trip to Lac Suel in June of this year with my family 2 11 year olds and a 12 year old probably an extra kid or two (LOL) I plan on camping in a camp but a night or two on the lake would be very cool. I'm a guide on Lake Erie and this is the first time I would every consider leaving Ohio in prime time. I'm interested in working with you for a couple of days one day on eyes another on some toothy critters. Any recommendation on a camp that has RV parking? I'd like to camp very near some good pan fishing for the kids. Thanks for all your help (past post) [email protected]. Drop me a line I'll call you."

554012,wooglin,2006-01-25 09:20:00,371,"So some of the guys are saying they want to take some gear with us one day, head way up into Lac Seul (we launch in Hudson), fish all day, camp in the bush, then fish all day again, then head it home. What are the regulations of just setting up camp (tent/food/light) in the middle of no where? Thanks."
554014,Guest,2006-01-25 10:04:00,0,Camping by nonresidents is strictly forbidden on Lac Seul. I wouldn't want to be found by local guides or the CO's. CO's can confiscate your gear and make life and your return a real pain
554015,wooglin,2006-01-25 10:18:00,371,Thanks! Do you know if there are special passes or licenses we can obtain for this?
554017,Guest,2006-01-25 10:31:00,0,"None available, nonresident camping was removed about 20 years ago as part of the Lac Seul Management Plan. Check with som eof the camps as there are a few outposts on the lake, some of the camps have campgrounds too."
554018,Guest,2006-01-25 11:09:00,0,"Wooglin, Nice to hear from you on here again! I don't know how far you are thinking about heading, but I guide the region north and west of the Reserve. It's much different in that section of LS than it is around Sioux Lookout or Ear Falls . . . far fewer people and only a couple lodges and outposts. As someone with degrees in both forestry, and outdoor recreation, parks and tourism, Lac Seul provides a great case study to examine the 'balancing act' of conflicting land uses in NWO. Because the old District Land Use Guidelines for that region weren't overly specific, in recognition of the growing interest and pressure in the area, Lac Seul was looked at closely in the mid-90's when the Lands for Life process was enacted and Ontario's Living Legacy was forged. Land use around the lake is an interest of several different stakeholders, and is discussed at several different scales. Under the basic direction of the OLL, the MNR has principle jurisdiction over the islands and shoreline surrounding LS, except near Ear Falls, Hudson, and Sioux Lookout where Municipal Official Plans govern (these are also about the only areas where development can procedd in any significant magnitude). Decisions regarding resource/land use rest with the MNR (or under specific circumstances could rest with the MOE or DFO), but are often made in conjunction with the Lac Seul Advisory Committee (LSAC). The LSAC is a fairly political group, with almost everyone thinking they have the most important issues regarding use of the resource, and trying to take over these meetings (e.g., the guy who owns Anderson's in Sioux Lookout). The lake is broken into zones to aid planning protocol and discussions. . . .anyway, I could go on all day, but there is a short background. To find out specific details, I would first direct you to the MNR website (www.mnr.gov.on.ca), and down the left-side menu, find the ""Crown Land Use Policy Atlas"", pull up Lac Seul, and make a decision as to the area you would like, if possible, to visit. The 1000 or so islnads on Lac Seul, excluding those within the Reserve, represent a Conservation Reserve, with many specific guidelines (http://crownlanduseatlas.mnr.gov.on.ca/pdfs/C2317.pdf). The lake itself is a general use area with different regulations (http://crownlanduseatlas.mnr.gov.on.ca/pdfs/G2518.pdf). Once you have figured out where you might like to go, you can contact the local MNR office and they will inform you as to what is possible. As I said, I guide the area just northwest and west of the reserve (amongst all those islands if you are looking at the map), and there are certainly plenty of places to camp (which is simple as a resident of Ontario, but not so as a non-resident). Neither I nor anyone else I know would cause you any trouble as long as you left the place the way you found it! The problem of course would come if there was 50 different groups out there all the time, and that is why we now have these regulations in place. I also know the CO for that area; really nice guy, provided you play by the rules!! So again, your best bet, is to determine exactly where you want to go and then contact the MNR. Like I said, LS is an unbelievable resource, and a real case study for balancing conflicting stakeholder interests in NWO. Thankfully, we have recognized these issues and worked to put the appropriate legislation, policy and guidelines in place, while the ecosystem is still fairly intact, which should allow the resource to provide the same benefits we see today to future generations.

554019,wooglin,2006-01-25 11:14:00,371,"Thanks guys for the info - I'll definately do my research and have no intentions on breaking any laws. Do you have any other camp ground suggestions that are up in that area? (Links??). We stay near Hudson as it is really reasonable and have had good times there - but we're always open for new ideas! PS, I'm always on this board lurking - just haven't had much to post. But now that spring is right around the corner, fishing will pick up for me!"
554020,hawk82,2006-01-25 11:23:00,126,"What about Camping on the English River below Maynard Falls over to Separation Lake? I see there are campgrounds there, but are there any rules or regulations in place there?"

554022,Guest,2006-01-25 11:37:00,0,"Curious if those who camp @ the mouth of Altimeter creek and back in the Sunlight/Broad lake areas are breaking the law by doing so?
