554691,Mohleye,2006-02-17 10:00:00,368,"Camps on Gullrock offer 4 day packages in July and August. You should be able to get plenty of feedback on this site. I fished Gullrock two different times in August and it was excellent. No smallies, though. Stayed at Wright's Wilderness Lodge. Very nice, but probably full by now. Other lodges are Poplar Point, Golden Hook, South Bay, and a couple others."

Stayed at Golden Hook first week of June about 11 years ago and had good fishing. Owners were not that friendly, but we weren't at camp much."
554134,Skyraptor,2006-01-26 21:49:00,291,"Due to my sons travelling Baseball and Football season I have a very limited window to take him fishing to Ontario this year. I'm looking at the last week in July or the first week in August. I'm looking for places that offer good walleye, northern and smallmouth fishing in either a drive-to or a fly-in lodge. Due to the time frame it has to be only 4 days and most lodges I have seen offer 7-day packages. Anyone have some good lodges to go too?"

Try this place....www.kenoraair.ca Heading up for the second time this year. MJ is great. Tell her Christian sent ya! Don't work for the place, but I stay in touch with her through the year."
554163,ONE TIME DAVE,2006-01-27 14:15:00,110,"Try www.awonakina.com Arctic Watershed Outposts. They have several lakes but two smaller ones with great fishing. Makoki and or Wayner ideal for a party of two and they will do less than a week. I have maps of both if you decide. Let me know. [email protected]. Remi and Christine of AWO will be in Ohio next week, so be patient if try to call them."
554172,kbkakes,2006-01-27 16:23:00,49,"Skyraptor.. As I told Blueranger in another post....If you want to drive as far as Ear Falls I have to recommend the Lake I was at with my sons in 2002. Check out Sumach Lake W/Excelent Adventures outposts. Is only a 20 min flight and the lake is great for Walleye. Nonstop pike. Lake also has lake trout, smallies and perch. Also great host. Faron and Joyce Buckler. Good Luck....Kevin Mhttp://www.exc-adventures.com/index.htm"
554173,Guest,2006-01-27 19:01:00,0,"I've been in that same situation with my son the last couple of years. We have gone to Black Island Resort (www.blackisland.com) on LOTW the last week in July for two years. It's a short drive across the border and a boat in lodge. Great owners, equipment, and food. The fishing is a little harder that time of year but it is a slower time for them and Mike will give you special attention. This year I will be up there in June. Good Luck"
554184,Guest,2006-01-28 15:40:00,0,Buena Vista Resort in Morson on Lake of the Woods - good reef walleye fishing the end of July and you can stay number of days you wish. buenavistaresort.com
554605,Mr_Gord,2006-02-13 13:22:00,2,"Try South Shore Lodge on Eagle Lake in N.W.O. Great Walleye lake and the lodge is very remote, when we got to the landing they picked us up in a boat and took us to the lodge, was realy neat. Check them out at www.southshorelodge.com You'll have a great time."
