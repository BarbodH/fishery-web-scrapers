554570,Guest,2006-02-12 13:12:00,0,"Our group of 6 guys went to Wawang Lake Resort one spring. We caught 7 walleye all over 30"". We released all of them. Wawang Lake is a trophy lake. My brother caught four of them himself. If you're looking for trophies I would definitely give Wawang Lake a try. We were very impressed."

553390,Guest,2005-12-19 20:56:00,0,"i have caught many many over 30's on lake of the woods,, in fact ,, i have one in my freezer now ,, it would not be there as i support catch and release ,, but it died when it was unhooked ,, i spent over 2 hours trying to revive it ,, it went right away but floated back up almost immediately ,, :-( but for all time biggest i have seen ,, it would be very hard to catch up to the monsters we have caught and released in Shoal Lake,, ,,, now before anybody gives me grief for that , i will explain ,, shoal lake is closed to all walleye fishing ,, has been for a while,, but what can you do when they hit a 10 inch muskie bait you are using in the pursuit of them huge northerns, we get the walleyes when trolling deep reefs for the big pike,, but i have fished a bass tourny there for a few years and have seen a great increase of the numbers of smaller walleye also being on them shallow rock piles with them bass,"
553392,phishfearme,2005-12-20 07:54:00,1242,"dale - just curious, but how do you close a lake to walleye fishing? what is ""walleye fishing""? how does the MNR know your intent? how does the MNR enforce this? this seems like another one of those unenforcable laws (or laws that'll never be enforced) that permiate both the US and Canada. thanks, phish"
553393,Guest,2005-12-20 09:53:00,0,I believe it simply means you can't posess (keep) any. -Unless the lake is closed to fishing altogether.
553394,phishfearme,2005-12-20 11:40:00,1242,"i think you're right - which means it's open to walleye ""fishing"" - i think??? phish"
553399,grt1,2005-12-20 15:08:00,259,I think it means that you better be using a bait that walleye would not normally be hitting (ie: large muskie bucktails). If you use a spinner bait rigged with a minnow you could be in for a lot of explaining.
553405,phishfearme,2005-12-20 21:31:00,1242,"according to the 2004 ontario regulations summary, shoal lake above ash rapids is closed all year to walleye and sauger. to quote the guide, ""it is illegal to attempt to catch fish for which the season is closed even though you are going to release them."" and ""if you catch one...the fish must be released back to the water immediately."" so, it's a law that must be respected and obeyed but probably one that is also impossible to proove. i wouldn't mind hearing from someone who knows more about this as far as ontario goes. for example, where i live in PA, there was a major issue about targeting bass while they're on the redd's. conviction would require patient observation by a conservation officer but still would be a proovable violation. if you're fishing away from spawning areas and catch a bass - fishing for anything (including bass illegally) - there would simply be no case. i believe this law never came to fruition here. phish"
553815,Guest,2006-01-16 22:14:00,0,"The rules as I understand them from a guides point of view is. Walleye fishing on Shoal Lake on purpose is illegal. IF you happen to catch on while fishing for smallmouth bass, muskie or pike it is to be returned to the water immediately. DEAD or ALIVE...Sorry about that. But that is what the MNR has told me for years. Now..if you persist to sit in one spot and continuosly catch and release walleye, they can and will nail your butt. Ten lb is small for Shoal Lake. I personally have caught and released 16lb walleye from Shoal. I have heard of larger being netted by the natives. Never seen one, but I bet they are certainly their. I used to fish for smallmouth bass as a guide, using leeches. It was not uncommon to catch walleye this way but I would catch one, maybe two and get the heck out of that spot. Not worth the time and trouble trying to explain to the MNR I was fishing bass when they did not believe me anyway. I once came out of a remote lake above the rapids. I was fishing large pike, with muskie baits. I went into Shoal Lake Narrows to continue pike fishing, I was stopped by the MNR and immediately accused of fishing muskie out of season. I got so ticked off with him, I just started my boat and left him sitting their. Here was a twit of an MNR guy telling me, that the muskie bait ""I"" had on was no good for big northern pike. Best bet..is IF you catch a walleye, put it back. If you catch another move to another spot. Saves a lot of trouble. Shoal Lake should be opened. The Labrynith Bays have a good stock of smaller walleye after all these years, but from what I hear, IF it is open to sports fishing, the natives want to commercial it again. #### they have nets out their anyway. They have nets all over LOTW for that matter, and it is only a matter of time, before it is all mucked up again. Cannot win this one as I see it. The government caves into the natives anyway. Watch the posts. when you start seeing posts of people catching nothing but large walleye consistently, and no smaller shorelunch sizes ones, then you know for sure, the smaller ones have been taken already."

553884,Guest,2006-01-17 22:42:00,0,Last winter there was an MSFA website where one could see and post photos of netting on Lake of the Woods and it disappeared without a trace - like some one got to the guy who was running it. I exchanged emails with him while it was up and he said the MNR was hitting the site every day. Anyone know anything about it???? His email address dried up also.
553889,Guest,2006-01-18 12:10:00,0,Thaddeus Lake southeast of Lac Seul a bit is a smaller lake but ya got a good chance at a 30' eye. We had trouble catching eyes small enough for shore lunch.
553292,Guest,2005-12-14 09:00:00,0,"The elusive 30"" Walleye seems to be a hot topic. In your opinion what lake offers the best chance of catching a 30"" Walleye?"
553293,Guest,2005-12-14 09:06:00,0,"Kevin, For my 02 cents, go to Pine Falls, Manitoba in Oct....best fishing and great area! Steve"
553297,Guest,2005-12-14 11:17:00,0,"30"" walleyes are consistently caught all year long on Lac Seul. That would be my top recommendation, if you want a definate shot at a 30"", as well as great volume of 25""-30"" walleye, and really at any time of year (at least on water, my experience on the ice on Lac Seul is limited). There are other great places too, but the 30"" fish seem readily available for only short periods of the year. Northeastern Lake Ontario, specifically the Bay of Quinte/Otonabee River system can produce huge walleyes. I have caught big walleyes and witnessed several other big walleyes (30""+) caught out of there at opener, but even moreso during the first couple weeks of October, and then during the last 3-4 weeks before ice-over in mid- to late-November and early December. The situation is similar at Pine Falls, as the other response suggests, where your best bet at a monster is often during October (winter comes earlier in Manitoba than it does in Southern Ontario). The other notable waterbodies known for producing big walleyes, although I haven't fished them personally, are the Columbia River and western Lake Erie. NWO Fishing Bum"
