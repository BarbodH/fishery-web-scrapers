554477,nitroman,2006-02-08 18:42:00,368,Stay away from the frog toggs I bought my bro-in-law a pair for christmas. 1st day on the water last year the crotch ripped out. after a week of wearing them(we had bad weather) the seat wore thru and they started to leak everywhere. Good thing we had duct tape or he would of never made the week with them. I just bought a stearns walleye hunter set they look to be very durable.
554485,beagle22b07,2006-02-08 22:34:00,34,"cunn Good Rain Gear in Canada is worth it's weight in Gold. Look into Kool Dri. They are very light and extremely durable. I used to wear my first one small game hunting on damp mornings, and they can also be used as a wind breaker on those windy days on the open water. I used to get the inexpensive suits all the time and always ended up wet. Finally, I purchased a ""Kool-Dri"" suit. Best investment I ever made. Buy one a couple sizes larger than you need and you can wear it year round even over your Carharts in the winter. I know the initial investment looks like alot, but when it's all said and done, you'll be money ahead. If I had half the money I spent on cheap rain gear, I probably could have bought 5 good ones. Anyways, look into them at the website below. www.kooldrirainwear.com/ Larry"

554513,Guest,2006-02-09 19:15:00,0,"Spend the extra money and buy a light weight gore-tex rain suit from cabelas. The light weight suit will run about $200 for the full suit (pants & jacket). If you plan on using it in cold weather too, buy it alittle bigger so you can wear heavier clothes under it. In my experience cheaping out on a rain suit is not a good idea, I rather be out $200 than soaking wet and/or uncomfortable on a fishing trip. The gore-tex jacket works well as a spring jacket or windbreaker too."
554538,SoDakMac,2006-02-10 20:46:00,218,">Cabelas Guidewear - love it. Cabelas pro series guidewear - >lighter weight for warm weather. Caelas premium parka and >pants - very nice and comfortable - wife wears hers all the >time and has fished in it from Maine to Alaska. Another vote for Cabela's Guideware. I finally got a set five years ago after going through (literally) many inexpensive suits for the past 30 years. Now most of my fishing partners have them too. The Guideware saved our Canadian trip two years ago since we lived in them for five days. Expensive but worth every dollar when you are in the boat and it is raining and sleeting and you have spent $1,000 getting there."
554549,Wisconeye,2006-02-11 11:07:00,79,"Cabela's guide wear just can't be beat. If get one with a zip-out liner you'll find it to be your every-day fishing coat. I wear mine all the time when fishing in Canada. After a day of catching a lot of fish, including northerns which slime up everything, I just splash them in the lake to clean them off, hang 'em up and put them back on the next day. I love mine and I think I have about $150 in a set, Bargain Cave!"

554408,Guest,2006-02-06 22:44:00,0,Depends how much you want to spend. Frogg Toogs are good for the price but i don't know about durability. Cabela's has the dry plus line that is less expensive then the guide wear both do a good job. I recommend bibs what ever you decide and buy them at lest one size larger then you think to allow for layering. Gander Mnt also has a nice rain suit. If it's a one time deal consider a sterns rain suit for about $30.00
554411,Guest,2006-02-07 08:29:00,0,"The rain gear I have is a mis-match set. I also have a cold weather set of raingear and warm weather. So you might need cold weather if it is 1st part of June and warm set in Aug. Buy the best you can afford. I bought mine at a close out store and bought mine in camo so that they will cross over to hunting. No since in buying a good pair of rain gear and it be blue, yellow or some crazy color that would clash when in a deerstand or turkey blind. Good Luck!"
554419,Frankm,2006-02-07 12:39:00,154,I've heard good things about Frogg Toggs. They are very lightweight. I have Bone Dry bibs which I really like they aren't cheap but I've had them for 10 years now and still in great shape. They are nice and warm when its cold and not too bad when its warmer. If your going when its cold make sure you have decent rain gear. Nothing worse that being cold and wet when your trying to fish.
554427,Guest,2006-02-07 15:15:00,0,A decent rainsuit can make or break a trip during bad weather (we can pick our trip days but the weather is still a crapshoot). I bought a suit for around a $100 at Cabelas and it works great for me.No time to be a cheapskate.
554435,Ohio fisherman,2006-02-07 20:50:00,989,Cabelas Guidewear - love it. Cabelas pro series guidewear - lighter weight for warm weather. Caelas premium parka and pants - very nice and comfortable - wife wears hers all the time and has fished in it from Maine to Alaska.
554436,Guest,2006-02-07 21:21:00,0,"hi- forget about frogg toggs- take a good look at them and you will see they are nothing more than a cheap rain suit coated with course fleece 2 guys had brand new suits last year and the seams leaked on pants and jacket - and only 1 walk thru the brush and they were shredded- absolutley the worst rain suit- they took them back to cabelas after only one week and because they where torn they would not replace them, i fished with both guys and they did not abuse them at all - buy the cabelas dry plus or if you can go a little higher in price go to gor tex or guide wear - one rainy trip and you will be glad you spent the few extra $ - trust the other advise from guys who have been there- i fish in all weather and a good rain suit is a bargain when your catching fish and every one else is sitting in the cabin! good luck"
554437,Guest,2006-02-07 21:51:00,0,"I have Frog Toggs and I do like them for mid-summer fishing. If the weather is warm, it is a decent suit. I had no problems with the seems. It does catch fish hooks though, and I would not wear it if I was walking through brush. It does seem like it would catch and tear easily. For Canada in June, I would want something a little more durable that offers more weather protection than just rain protection. It can get cold up north, even in June."
554445,Guest,2006-02-07 23:19:00,0,"I have the Gander Mtn. Guide Series, bibs and Jacket and am so glad. Last years trip was 4 days of intermittent rain and cold. With the bibs you can leave them on all day. The rest of these posts are right, buy the best you can afford, you will not be disappointed and they will last for years. Think $100 not $10."
554474,cunn6776,2006-02-08 17:48:00,8,"Thanks for the info everyone. I was kind of wondering about the durability of the toggs, and if they could leak or not. I've been looking at the Cabelas brand pretty hard and leaning that way now. I don't want to be wet and cold on my first Canadian trip. Thanks again."
