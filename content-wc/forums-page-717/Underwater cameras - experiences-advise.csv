I'm tempted to purchase one from Cabelas since they offer a 100%, no questions asked, guarantee. Then, if I don't like it, return it. Although, I'm afraid I'd spend all day watching TV, and not enjoying everything else that is afforded by a day on the water. Your thoughts and experiences welcomed."

Visibility is more limited when compared to clearer systems, but you still can see bottom structure, fish, etc. if you get close enough. Knowing what I do now, I wouldn't bother getting one again. Sure it was neat the first few times we used it to check out my favorite spots, try to determine why fish were holding there, etc. but it was also work and did take time away from fishing. Getting the camera positioned so you can see exacty what you are interested in required that you twist the cable, vary the depth, move further and closer to objects and a lot of time was spent jerking the camera up/down/sideways/twist/up/down.... Using it while drifting, trolling or in much current will require even more jerking/twisting/up/down to get things just right--but it may not even be possible to position it correctly if you are moving too fast.. After we got done viewing an area, you we generally left with this: ""that was neat, but now what..."" feeling. A couple weeks later(and two dozen more uses),and we haven't used it again--it's been in the garage for a two years now collecting dust. If you are going to spend that kind of money, put it into a higher end rod and reel. I think you'll get much more enjoyment and better use from that instead. Just my opinion...but I'd just as soon have another nice walleye rod and reel intead. Chuck"

Even then, I don't see it as a worthwhile investment. What eventually sold me against them was watching walleye after walleye swim past our boat and baits one day. I found it to be aggravating and asked my fishing partner to turn the thing off."
554633,Guest,2006-02-13 21:58:00,0,I've used the two that are on the market. The aqua view and I forget the other. Actually I liked them for looking at things and the fish too. Only problem here on LOTW was during the alge season it was not all that good below 20ft. Unless right on bottom. I wanted it to take photos mainly. Worked to a certain extent. They are ideal if you have dropped something overboard thats about all.
