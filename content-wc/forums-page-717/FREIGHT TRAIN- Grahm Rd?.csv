I was wondering if motors are allowed in there for non citizens that are camping on crown land or is it canoe only? I have heard they are allowed and some say they are not. Everything I can find on the MNR website says motors are allowed. Any help would be greatly appreciated."

My assumption is if you can legally get to the water, motors are fine. Some areas are restricted to vehicle travel, some roads are bulldozed shut or dug up, etc. Our fearless leader has all the maps. I'm not sure where the brightsand runs. 2 years ago we put in on the left hand side of the road by Sparkling and portaged up into Rude. Is that part of the brightsand? If it is, there were a couple groups in there with motors, residents and non residents."

We are going to be heading south from there. You guys headed nortwest, how was the fishing when you where there. We are planning an early June trip."
554718,Guest,2006-02-19 11:02:00,0,Yes you can use motors on the Brightsands. You can access the Brightsands at about marker 100 just after the bridge on the left hand side. The right hand side will take you to Sparkling and Kashishabog. I go up every year and I've never been disappointed with the fishing. The parking can be a problem depending on the time of year and holiday. There is a road prior to the bridge that leads off to the west at about marker 80. You cannot access the Brightsands from that road and there is a sign before the bridge stating that.
