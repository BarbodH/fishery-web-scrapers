554571,Guest,2006-02-11 18:40:00,0,"The bay you refer to by Black Bear Portage is the area I was talking about. There is a resort at the M (medical evac) on the government map. Weeds start at about 12 feet and eventually run all the way to the resort, start looking for your musky (and crappie) there and work on in. Also don't overlook the rock hump just out from the portage--it's got nice walleye on the lower part of the hump, and smallies on the 10' side, we've seen musky there too. I'm assuming you are refering to the big yellow map, when you talk about the 'ou' on the map. That is not the bay I was refering to, although we've got a couple musky not far from there in the bay that Clark Island is in. The bay I was refering to is actually off the east part of the river as it gets ready to go on toward the Whitedog dam. You go north of the orange marker bouy and the bay is after you go past the point(on the east side). In fact, if you keep following this part of the river, there is another bay that is actually the outflowage from Blackberry Lake(?)and forms part of the north channel. This bay is also good for big musky and northern too, if there isn't any water flowing thru the north channel. Work the island in the north end of the bay. Just be careful in this section of the lake, because there are several rocks that are not shown on any maps, that have been hit by many over the years. Chuck"

554556,Guest,2006-02-11 19:11:00,0,"Don, We try to get to Rough Rock a couple of times during the 2 weeks wer are there. There were years where we went exclusively up there, because the big northern and smallies were so numerous. Just be careful, because it can get quite nasty with the wrong wind, in a jiffy. You may be a little early in late May for the crappie to have start moving into the shallow flat I was referring to. I would start looking in the same area, only start in deeper water and work your way in. Weed growth will start to show up around 18 feet or so, so maybe that's a good depth. You should see them on the sonar at that depth too. Anwyay, cast around with 1/16 to 1/8 oz heads with yellow, gray or white grubs/twister tails, or jig em' vertically if they are near the bottom. Around mid-june the crappie usually start moving in (depends on the season, weather and water level) to the shallow flat I was referring to. We've usually caught them in 6' at these times, but had a couple years where we got them at 2' right against the shoreline. What we do then is cast out with the same jigs but under a small bobber--cast into the open holes in the weeds and against the rocks on the north shore. (If you try to get too close they spook easily.) I'm familiar with the beaver hut in Lost Lake and have fished it often with small brown crappie tubes, although high water and the slight current flowing into Milner's Bay the past few years has seemed to move the crappie a little further to the west of the hut--more along the north shoreline. Thanks for the tip on the floating weed bog. We've caught a few smaller musky in Lost Lake, while fishing for smallies--and try to get in there at least once over a two week period. The first week of June should have some good smallies in Milner's Bay, at Sugarloaf Island in Big Sand, at Green Island and the weed bed to the west of it in Big Sand, Vermillion and Mine Bays in Big Sand, and Finger Bay in Little Sand. If you can find them in Duck Bay on the north end of Little Sand, you will be in for a treat-- since they are usually in large numbers--but it really depends on the season and water level. By the way, start looking for walleye in the narrows between 18 and 12', especially on the north shoreline and entrance to the big bay that is there. Chuck"

554557,Guest,2006-02-11 19:38:00,0,"I don't know about the English River, never looked for them there or heard that. However, I have caught plenty of crappie on the Winnepeg, a few miles from where the English River dumps into it. They aren't 'everywhere' or as plentiful, like they are in many midwest lakes around here. You need to search for them, even if you know the general area where they seem to inhabit, and they are very easily spooked when you do get on them. We've had years where we didn't get a single one, and then were years where we caught plenty in a morning. Most run larger than 10"", and we've even caught a few 16""ers. We are 99.9% catch and release on everything, and only have a walleye or two each week were are there. (The crappie we do catch up there are too rare to keep.) Chuck"

554559,voyaguer,2006-02-11 20:19:00,54,"Thanks for all of the information, all of you. I'll be there June 10 +\- and look forward to it. With what I have learned from you, I'll be prepared to do more small mouth and crappie fishing than planned. Typically I do more walleye fishing and will certainly try that, but knowing about the muskie and crappie fishing will influence the tackle I take along. In regards to the query about crappie on the English River, I have never caught one there in the past 15 years, but I also haven't sought them. Mostly I have fished for walleye, northerns and a few small mouth there. In the past, when in cappie territory, I have eventually caught them while fishing for walleye and bass, and haven't had that experience on the part of the English River I have fished. By reference, I have learned from you that the Winnipeg River runs noth, to Manitoba, not south to LOW. Having fished so many of these rivers and lakes to the east, I should have known that but did not. I suspect I'll spend most of my time in Rough Rock and north part of Little Sand. In a week, there is only so much you can do. As a side note, knowing some folks in the Ministry, I'm still concerned about the amount of fish netting going on up there, but it sounds like there remain reasonable numbers to catch. And if you wonder, like I often do, I catch and release always, use barbless hooks usually, except that I will keep one walleye a day for dinner. In a week, that's not much. What would you do with a 40 # muskie or northern anyway, although crappie can make a tasty meal. For me, I don't envy a trophy mount of a formerly live fish on a wall somewhere, thinking that it could be swimming out there somewhere for someone else to possibly catch. I was around 40 years ago to see the rampant waste, and hope the netting today is not a repeat of that. Ok, I'm off the soapbox. best of luck to all of you"

554535,voyaguer,2006-02-10 17:11:00,54,"Headed to the Winnipeg River, north of LOW and Minaki, in June. Will be in the vicinity of Rough Rock Lake and others. Would appreciate some advice on the fishing there, particularly for Walleye. I also hear that it has a fair Muskie population. Is it similar to the English River ? Thanks for your time and information"
554539,Guest,2006-02-10 20:47:00,0,"The Winnepeg River from the Reservation south of Minaki, to the Whitedog Dam is noted for very big Musky. Every year they have a big tournament in August, and there are some monsters that get caught. The biggest I've personally caught in the past 20+ years was 55"". Rough Rock has some very nice locations for Musky and big northern. The islands and rock piles to the south part of the lake where the river comes is where we consistantly catch musky each year. There is a huge weed bed in the south eastern part of the lake (out from the fly-in resort), that we've also got some nice musky and big northern in. (They are feeding on the crappie that are in and around the weed bed.) The north part of the lake has big bay that is good for musky, but be careful because there are a number of rocks in that area that are not on the maps. We've pulled a few out of this bay and the points on either side of it. We've typically caught them on #3 to #5 mepps and 1/4 to 3/8 oz spinnerbaits. Enjoy, Chuck"
554540,voyaguer,2006-02-10 21:01:00,54,"Thanks very much, I got out my map and looked at the areas you noted and now have some good information. I will need to procure some Muskie equipment. Never have caught one of those, but many walleye and fairly large northern (largest 17 # +\_) . take care Phil"
554547,Guest,2006-02-11 10:26:00,0,"We don't fish exclusively for musky, but spend about 95% of the time targeting smallies, and when we get tired we'll fish for walleye. [Yah, I know this is a walleye board. :)] So, we catch musky while beating the banks, structure and cover for smallies, and occassionally hook one while walleye fishing. As such, #3 mepps and 3-1/2"" tube jigs have caught more musky for us on M and MH bait casting setups with 8# to 12# line. So, if you want to get a lot of action and occassionally get a musky, I suggest smallie fishing. There's a whole lot more action! By the way, the Winnepeg river has a narrows that makes a right hand bend about a mile before it runs into Rough Rock. We've caught more musky the past couple or years around the island that is in the narrows, and along the northern shoreline (and it's 2 coves) before the bend. (The walleye often stackup along the locations, and the Musky are chowing down on them.) We've had many instances where we'd be reeling in a walleye and have a Musky (or 40+ inch northern) grab it at the boat. It's a real heart stopper, to have them sit at the side of the boat with the walleye in their mouth -- and not let go.... I think we've gotten 6 musky in the narrows over the past couple of years there by working the banks and rocky shoreline for smallies, especially when the water isn't flowing as much. Enjoy your trip, I know we will! Chuck"

554550,hawk82,2006-02-11 13:45:00,126,Does the Winnepeg River connect with the English River? When I was looking at Google Earth I could have swore they did. Might have been mistaken though.
554551,Guest,2006-02-11 13:48:00,0,"Chuck,the bay your talking about on the east end ,is that by Black bear Portage camp?And the bay on the west end ,is that above the o u on the map? How deep do you fish fore the eyes by the turn in the river?"
554552,Guest,2006-02-11 14:17:00,0,"ChuckE We have a group going up May 27-June 2 at Birch Island. My fishing buddy wants to fish Rough Rock this year. We seldom venture in to it. We, like you, are primarily smallmouth fisherman, using tender tubes. We also catch musky and walleye tube fishing for smallmouth. I also enjoy fishing crappie with light plastic grubs and tackle. What pattern do you recommend for crappie in Rough Rock? How long will the crappie remain shallow or in the weeds as the season progresses? Any advice on smallmouth areas is also appreciated. We are C&R only with smallmouth and crappie. Also release 95-99% of walleye. All Musky and Pike released. I recommend Lost Lake, down by the bridge, in the back near the beaver dam for crappie. There is also a floating bog in the right back that has some crappie also. Smallmouth are prevalent most places on the shore there. Thanks, Don"
