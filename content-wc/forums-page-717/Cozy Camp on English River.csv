554534,page,2006-02-10 16:58:00,6,I am considering the week of July 15 thru 22 at Cozy Camp. Does anyone on this site go there and what do you like about it? Or did you used to go there and why did you stop? Thanks in advance for your input.
554542,Larry S,2006-02-10 22:41:00,666,"Page, I checked out the search feature on this board for all the postings on Cozy Camp. After reading these postings and talking to the owners 3 of us have deceided to go there from June 10th to 15th before we go on a fly-in trip. The camp has a lot of water to fish on the river ,plus lakes connected to the river. It also has numbers of lakes you can hook up a boat/motor to your truck/van and fish many different lakes. The price is reasonable,so were giving it a shot Larry S"

Portage area above falls was very productive constant action. Cabins were not the greatest some looked very ""rustic"". Owners were very nice. We took in crawlers and they worked very well. They have minnows available at camp. We had a good time. Price was very reasonable. Robby"

My nephew caught the biggest Northern I have ever seen down by the falls....47"" ....on his son's Snoopy pole!!!! Accomodations were a little primitive by I know that he was realy upgrading and I am sure that they are really nice now!!! Enjoy!"
554686,page,2006-02-17 08:09:00,6,Thanks for the replies. The word rustic scares my wife. Outside doesn't matter but is the inside of the cabins decent and clean or wornout?
554687,Guest,2006-02-17 09:25:00,0,I have pics. I will reply later.

Even when my wife went with me one year, she was never in the cabin. Well, to sleep and that's about it. It's too beautiful to stay in side. My wife doesn't come anymore after making me go pick berries while my buddies were off fishing. I still haven't forgotten that...my buddies don't let me. :("
