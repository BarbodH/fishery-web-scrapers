554670,pfg1,2006-02-15 23:44:00,52,"Hello, I am ""negotiating"" to buy a 2006 Lund Explorer Camo Tiller model with a 2006 Shorelander bunk trailer but so far the dealer is sticking to full retail prices. The dealer has shown me his Lund ""Dealer Retail"" price list of the boat and accessories. Are these prices negotiable from dealer to dealer or will I pay full sticker price regardless of the dealer? What is a reasonable discount? I am transferring my F75 Yamaha motor to the new rig. Thanks, DAVID"
