554681,Roddy,2006-02-16 21:46:00,488,"We have used Knobby's on our last two trips. We had used 4 different outfitters on our 4 previous trips and were never quite satisfied with the whole package with the other outfitters. The lake we have fished is Roadhouse. The cabin is huge and up until this year they had indoor toilets. I think they are doing away with them because of new requlations. They do a fantastic job of trying to keep you pleased. They checked on us at least every other day, and if we needed anything they delivered it the same day. You may be able to find an outfitter with bigger fish, but I doubt you will find anyone with better customer satisfaction. If you have any other questions I can answer for you, drop me an e-mail.
