1345165,WARRIOR,2011-08-30 07:50:00,195,always a good idea to call credit card company before leaving country.
1345241,Lovetofish,2011-08-30 12:03:00,458,"Interesting thread. I just called my credit card company to let them know I'll soon be in Canada for a week. The service lady made note of my dates and where I'll be traveling in case I do need my credit card. If I would not have called VISA any charge up there would have been denied. She said this is not only a proceedure for out of country charges but also from other areas of the USA that I have normally not been charging from. Why, simply because of theft. So, thanks for the heads up and hope I won't need the card."
1345493,doubleheader,2011-08-31 07:22:00,2652,"We offset some of the rising prices by taking one 2 week trip/year rather than separate 1 week trips. Also, since we cook our own meals, meals really aren't a factor, I mean heck, you have to eat at home too. The same could be said of the fuel expense, it's not like you won't be spending money on gas at home, and finally, there are lodges that offer discounts if you stay a 2nd week. All in all, I think the Canadian experience is a a very economical vacation, and it's a very competitive market. I don't think anyone is getting rich in the lodge business up north. As far as currency is concerned, I never exchange money and have yet to be turned down. In the few places we stopped this past year, two places exchanged my greenbacks at par. I use a credit card that doesn't charge an international fee for gas and lodging; can't remember which, might be my AMEX."
1342895,Danbear,2011-08-23 10:04:00,72,"My bottom line is a 4 or 5% swing in exchange rate will not deter me from going to Canada fishing, I have an excellent time every year, I love the camp where I go (Birch Dale Lodge Eagle Lake) so I save enough all year to go even if prices rise 10-20% I am still going, what the heck it's the best vacation of the year and you can't put a price on that. Leave in 16 days can't wait."
1342897,LOW1,2011-08-23 10:10:00,2828,"Some possible good news is the recent apparent strengthening of the US$ vs the CND$ dollar. We may be back to parity very soon. If you utilize your options re the exchange, this could be a 5 to 10 percent savings over earlier this summer.Also, I know that a buck is a buck, but don't shortchange yourself or your family and friends from a unique Canadian experience over a few percentage points. Unless we support Canadian businesses the quality of this experience will be reduced."
1342921,dewyg,2011-08-23 11:13:00,1006,"I find it interesting that the gentleman feels that the resorts should be lowering there prices to keep attracting the U.S. based customers. Interesting philisophy, I wish that worked with all business. Resorts/Vacations are a want not a need."
1342983,Guest,2011-08-23 13:52:00,0,"That's his point!!! They are a want (which is the first thing to go in tight times) not a need!!!!! Gord's comparison to gas is not at all valid, the camps are not oil companies, nor is a vacation comparable to buying fuel that is needed to support life."
1343005,v-bay gord,2011-08-23 14:51:00,3168,"My comparison to the gas price from 20 years ago was just an example of the change of costs over 20 years......substitute ""outboard motor"" or ""labour costs"" if that makes more sense."
1343006,dewyg,2011-08-23 15:07:00,1006,"I agree with you Gord, everything goes up ie salary etc.."
1343007,55walleyes,2011-08-23 15:16:00,131,I agree about Canada trip being a want but as a teacher in Indiana that has reached top of pay scale I have not had a raise in 5 years. I have still found a way to make trip but it is getting tougher.
1343121,buckoeye,2011-08-23 20:31:00,37,"Hope this helps: I travel international for work and in Canada. I have a MARRIOTT VISA CARD, NO INTERNATIONAL FEES. NOTHING and the highest daily exchange rate. Yes, if you only leave the country once or twice. You should notify your credit card company. If someone steals your card and then they go to Canada, you would be crying with the unwanted transactions and charges. Especially if they gave the ok for the transactions. NO I do not work for Visa or Mariott"
1343363,yurtman,2011-08-24 12:57:00,46,"Be aware that Canadian retailers are way less likely to accept personal cheques that American retailers. Some of the lodges will, but gas stations, restaurants, tackle shops etc. will not. I'm Canadian and I am always amazed when in the States how common it is there to use a cheque; we don't even ask b/c e know what the answer is. There is no way that your credit card company should have an issue with you being in Canada, especially if you inform them first. I would change credit cards - there are a million of them out there."
1344283,Manitou,2011-08-27 09:27:00,125,"I'm a little late on this thread and haven't read all of it.But here's a little tip from me to you.If you belong to AAA you can go to any CAA office here and buy traveller's cheques in Canadian currency with your US money. You will NOT find a better exchange rate. They give the best rate available - they don't charge overhead. I have done this a few times here in Winnipeg as my wife earns some money from an American employer, and we have researched this.I would add - call your local AAA office and see what they rate they may have for Canadian traveller's cheques, it may also be true down there that they have the most competitive exchange."
1342399,FrankLeigh,2011-08-21 22:11:00,80,I am Canadian and have had my US dollar Visa card cancelled because I used it in Buffalo and Las Vegas on the same day. I guess that they are trying to protect us from identity fraud but I am not really willing to give my travel plans to Visa.I guess that cash is still king.
1342418,yarcraft91,2011-08-22 05:40:00,11487,"Yep- let the CC company know about your travel plans. That's what I do and never a problem with the cards anywhere in the world. Do I care if Visa knows I'm traveling? No. Whenever I charge something they know exactly where I am and when I was there, anyway.If, as said by another poster, Canadians no longer want US cash, that's new. I've never had trouble with US cash in Canada, in fact, that's how our guide wants to be paid. Grocery stores take US currency and the exchange rate is programmed right into their cash registers. But, I only know about the Prairie Provinces, not the eastern ones."
1342643,lcwhit,2011-08-22 16:48:00,104,the issue is more one of protecting the banks than the customer. they dont want the liability associated with stolen cards. they have some pretty sophisticated software to spot oddities in purchase histories-amounts and locations etc. they will cancel and ask questions later. the burden is on you to call them to reactivate the cards.
1342766,gapwedge,2011-08-22 22:39:00,19,"When I went to Canada in July the exchange rate was 3-4%. The dollar has since gotten stronger and is now only discounted about 1%.While the unfavorable exchange rate of US dollars is a factor, it is minor compared to the excessive profits the banks seek to make in exchanging US dollars into canadian dollars. My bank sought to charge me about 9% to make the exchange when the exchange rate was only 3-4%.It is my understanding that the Canadian banks are similarly greedy in as much as when your lodge owner or store merchant takes the US dollars you hand him to his Canadian bank for conversion and deposit, they hammer him with a fee in addition to the exchange rate then in effect.I'm curious about the fee charged at the border to make these exchanges. Thanks for the reply."
1342769,walley250,2011-08-23 00:11:00,161,We always stop at Pembina and get our US money switched to Canadian and then back to dollars again on our way home. We get this done at a gas station up there. Never paid much attention to if we were getting ripped or not. Maybe it would be something to pay attention to.
1342824,Jig A Lowe,2011-08-23 07:30:00,87,"Well, the resorts always have the option to lower their prices to offset the weak dollar. I would think that would be a good business decision. If US customers cancel their Canadian vacation because of the unfavorable exchange rate and then vacation state-side, it may be hard to get these people back. I have been going the the same lodge for over 20 yrs. The prices increase by appx. 5% every yr. irrespective of the exchange rate at the time. The cost of our lodging is now appx. 2 1/2 times what it was 20+ yrs ago. And, the cost to me is even greater with the unfavorable exchange rate. And, yes, the vacancy rate has been steadily climbing. I understand why resort owners would be reluctant to lower prices to offset the exchange rate but it may be the lesser of evils. Canadian resort owners have taken many blows the past few yrs. -- the passport requirement, the high cost of gas, changing fishing regulations, the weak US economy and, of course, the exchange rate. All of these factors have discouraged US visits to Canada. The one factorthat the resort owners could impact would be the exchange rate by adjusting prices downward somewhat. I think many US visitors would consider that to be very nice gesture."
1342834,v-bay gord,2011-08-23 07:44:00,3168,"Yes, that would be a very nice gesture....similar to the band playing as the Titanic went down! By the way, 20 years ago the price for gas was about $1.12 per gallon."
1342840,tv4fish,2011-08-23 08:10:00,2694,Gord: You can't argue with facts. JMO - But do you want an empty resort due to these circumstances OR do you want people continuing to come there and you're just NOT making quite as much $$$'s. The man has a valid point.
1342842,LOW1,2011-08-23 08:14:00,2828,We opened an account at a Canadian credit union and receive a fair exchange rate. By depositing American dollars into the account and then paying in Canadian dollars we frequently save about 4 or 5% over paying directly in American dollars. No account fees if a modest amount (more than $1000) is kept in the account.
1342877,v-bay gord,2011-08-23 09:28:00,3168,"Of course the point is valid. My observation from this geographical area is that most have kept their rates the same for the past few years.......so in fact they are already not making as much $$$. The other bothersome fact is that people need to make a profit to continue doing maintenence and upgrades....never mind having something left to live on. I guess my reaction is that the point was much more valid 4 or 5 years ago when things were much better all around. Today cutting rates further comes at the expense of something else (maintenence, equipment, sanity)......and that is unsustainable."
1342054,wallydave,2011-08-20 11:48:00,2151,"I tried to get some travelers checks for our trip in June, so did my boat/cabin buddy. Neither my credit union or his bank carries travelers checks anymore! We ended with using good old cash money! At the Camp we fish out of all the prices are based on US currency, we did exchange some US for Canadian for small purchases, beer groceries and leeches. As posted above, most places add a 3% fee to CC users."
1342091,Biggerbear,2011-08-20 15:45:00,13,"I jsut checked online and Today for 5,000.00 USD you get 4,934 CADWhat the heck !!! I have not fished Canada for a while but this is not good !!!Back in the 80's we would get 30% now it's backwards. Really scary for the US now."
1342092,Obabikon,2011-08-20 15:49:00,2370,"Sadly, big bear, that's VERY good for this year. It's been much worse most of the summer. The US dollar has been devalued drastically. Hopefully it turns back the other way, because it's been devastating for most resorts."
1342102,NARDA 1,2011-08-20 16:37:00,636,They charge a 2.75% transaction fee.
1342175,Guest,2011-08-21 06:46:00,0,The only way to get a fair shake is to walk into the bank and get some good old CASH.
1342247,DaveO,2011-08-21 10:36:00,3,"Just got back from Deer Horn Lodge/res. Cabonga. I had paid the dep in US cash-which was taken on par...great. Brought US cash with me to pay for everything and then some, but everyone wanted payment by CC--no one wanted US Dollars which struck me as odd. I am a business owner and know all abt the exchange rate, int'l surcharges, etc. they incur...yet everyone from McDonalds to gas stations and restaurants wanted CC payment not US cash. I live in upstate NY so am used to our canadian visitors using their currency, and having to deal with the exchange. I travel alot and the plain fact isthe US dollar is not king anymore when traveling. debit or prepaid cc or reg cc is the way of the world now"
1342261,v-bay gord,2011-08-21 11:26:00,3168,"One of the issues these days is the rapid fluctuations in the US vs Cdn dollar exchange rate. If you are a business and accept it at a 5% exchange rate one day, by the time you deposit it in your bank it seems like it can be totally different. In the past this was not the case.....exchange rates were much less dynamic."
1342267,chevtow,2011-08-21 12:08:00,691,"When you leave the country you should call the credit card companies you intend to use and make them aware of your plans. I've always done this and never have problems in any country. Many of them have the little notes on your statements stating this very fact. I usually pay with dollars in Canada, seeing as pretty much everyone takes them. Credit cards are reserved for major repairs and unforeseen expenses."
1342355,MorganMan,2011-08-21 18:30:00,341,"We have almost always had to pay with check so haven't had those issues with a credit card....go to know though. We will continue to only use in emergency. Our group also throws money into the pot and we use that money for gas for all vehicles, any duty at the border and any food we need for the cabin and trip both ways. It seems to make things even for everyone in the expense column. We do make a stop at the border (especially when exchange rate was more significant) and exchange for Canadian funds and change back upon our return."
1342385,Nimstug,2011-08-21 20:31:00,2605,"This past March a hold was placed on my debit card after I used in a parking meter in L.A. at about 10:00 pm for $1.00. The next morning it didn't work. When I talked to my bank a couple of days later, I was told about problems with identity theft. I was advised to call before taking a 'distant' trip. Not sure how they figure 'distant.' I had no problem using the credit card in California, but that's issued by a different institution so they Called a week before I went to Florida in May and had no problems with the debit card. At our Canadian camp, we pay with personal check. Rates are quoted in U.S. funds.NimstugThe physician can bury his mistakes but the architect can only advise his clients to plant vines. -F.L.Wright"
1341964,DanL,2011-08-19 21:36:00,262,I was in Canada a few weeks ago and I had both of my credit cards cancelled when I used them in Canada. I called both credit card companies and informed them I would be in Canada. This is not the first time this has happened. Four others in my group experienced the same problem. Next year I am thinking of bringing Canadian cash or travelers checks. I paid for the cabin with a check. What does everyone else use for currency in Canada? Is there a best way to pay with the currency exchange?
1341991,Guest,2011-08-20 05:03:00,0,You would be far better off paying in Canadian dollars that you exchanged at a bank. Your CC company makes atleast an additional 1-2% exchanging your money.
1341993,Obabikon,2011-08-20 05:31:00,2370,"CC companies make money on the exchange, a foreign usage fee, and then ontop of that they take the recipiants for like 3%. All in all, they get somewhere in the range of 6-7% minimum on a CC usage. Personal checks or cash"
1342001,rebs,2011-08-20 06:33:00,7587,if the cc bank makes money on it then why would they cancel your card for using it in Canada ?
1342006,Guss,2011-08-20 06:55:00,27,"When fishing the SiouxLookout area, we go into town to the Bank of Montreal, good exchange and I think 1% fee, not bad."
1342013,Richard B,2011-08-20 07:21:00,735,Not attempting to be nosey but did the credit card company explain why they cancelled the cards? I have never had an issue using mine up in Canada.
1342037,NARDA 1,2011-08-20 09:35:00,636,"We actually set up a checking account and debit cards for our group. We use the debit cards for gasoline, liquor and grocery purchases and the checkbook for major purchases like paying the lodge. Those exchange fees can really mount up on the lage purchases."
1342039,NARDA 1,2011-08-20 09:41:00,636,Had that happen with our debit cards. They put a hold on the account because of the out of country charges thinking the cards were stolen. The problem was it was over the weekend when it was noticed and we had to wait until Monday to call and straighten it out. Each year now I call the fraud department for the debit card and have them put a notation on the card that it will be used in Canada and the dates we will be up there. No problems since.
1342043,DavKin,2011-08-20 10:24:00,104,"Narda, How did your bank handle the currency conversion when you used your debit card? I use Harris Bank and will be leaving on Sept. 3 for Red Lake. Thanks, Dave"
1342052,DanL,2011-08-20 11:28:00,262,They said it had nothing to do with being in Canada. They said it was a fraud issue that affected many cards. I don't buy that. !5 minutes earlier my card worked in International Falls.
