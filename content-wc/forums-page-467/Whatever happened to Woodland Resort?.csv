The turnoff to the resort was a few miles south of Sioux Narrows. You could drive to the resort but they didn't have a boat ramp. You had to put in at a public boat ramp on the north side of Snake Bay, motor into Whitefish Bay an then go directly north about a mile or two to the resort. Woodland Resort was very near White Point. I believe it was owned and operated by Dick and Judy Starky. I can't imagine that the place is not a resort anymore and was wondering if anyone knows what the resort is called now, or if it is still a resort. Thanks in advance for the info. Marv"

Might be seasonal rentals.My uncle lives on the same road as the resort, Fickas Road in Sioux Narrows and he doesn't even know for sure whether it's still operating or not. It is still there though."

We have stayed Crawfords in 1971, Breezy Point 1972-1979, Woodland 1979-1983, Breezy Point 1999-2001, and finally back to Crawfords in 2004 and again this year. We did make trips out to Woodland and in 2001 and 2004 the resort was no longer there. The lodge where hotdogs and drinks were served every Sunday by Dick as a welcome is no longer standing. Most of the rental cabins are gone and newer homes in their place. Another sad fact is Breezy Point went away. Having stayed there 10 times it was a family tradition, and we always stayed in the same cabin. The bathroom was on the front porch."

Stayed in the cabin named the ""TEPEE"" for two weeks every year with my parents. Nice beach, nice docks. They had a great Sunday brunch back then. Moved to Crawfords for many years after that. I think Matt Rydberg owns it now. Last trip I took there with my Dad was back in 2000. He passed in 2005. Bought a new Sylvan in 2008 and took my wife and daughter there. Stayed at Indianhead in Snake Bay. First trip with out my Dad. Kind of scary. I need to go back next year. GPS is a great thing. Thanks for listening."
