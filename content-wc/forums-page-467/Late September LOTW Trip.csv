1344791,Guest,2011-08-29 07:00:00,0,"Heading to Nestor Falls/Sabaskong Bay during the last week of September. Plan on fishing for whatever is biting and willing to motor an hour or so to get to a spot. My first trip this time of year. Think I know the spots for crappie (Hay Island, Obabikon, Miles Bay) and walleye (channels and areas with current in ~25-30 ft. of water). Anyone have any tips/locations they would be willing to share for perch and smallmouth bass? Appreciate."
