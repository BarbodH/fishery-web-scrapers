1291591,Guest,2011-04-06 10:51:00,0,"My group of 8 is returning to Wally Mullin's camp on Lake Sasseginaga in Ontario in late August. We were there 6 years ago and happened to time our prized week in the middle of a stretch of very unsettled weather. The eye fishing ws very tough, yet we have decided to give the place another shot. Has anyone on this board been there recently ( last couple of years)?? Any reports and tips are much appreciated! Thanks."
1291892,adempsey,2011-04-07 00:03:00,963,You will most likely find some reports from the past few years at: http://kipawa.net/index.phpHave a good trip!
1294321,Guest,2011-04-13 15:41:00,0,Thanks for the reply...but I found nothing there specific to Lake Sasseginaga. Nobody else out there in cyberspace has been to Sass?
1294926,adempsey,2011-04-14 21:02:00,963,"Really? There are several reports in the forum from that lake. Oh well, good luck with your search!"
1295168,Guest,2011-04-15 14:07:00,0,You're right! I was looking in the wrong forum before. This 'ol dinosaur needs help with some computer apps. Thanks for the heads up.
1315122,rimfire21,2011-06-06 14:39:00,7,"Howdy. I just returned from Wally Mullen's place at Sasseginaga last night (June 5, 2011). This is my third trip, having been there in June 2003 and June 2005. There were six in the party and we stayed at Outpost Cabin #6 this time as we had done in the past. In a word, the fishing was ""TERRIBLE"". Four of us are experienced fishermen who spend a great deal of time on the water. This past week the 6 of us caught a total of 4 suckers, 6 northern pike, and 8 walleye. None of them were trophies. That is 18 fish for 6 men in 3 boats who averaged better than 8 hours per day on the water. We fished hard! We had all types of different weather and temps, and we fished in the sun, wind, rain, chop, calm, early and late! We threw everything we had at the fish; stick baits, Hot 'n Tots, Rapalas, Husky Jerks, fresh crawlers on Green Mountain Grabber rigs, bottom bouncers, spoons, - you name it. We drifted, we trolled, we sat still. We went so far as to put crawlers on hooks with sinkers below bobbers. It plain sucked! Each of the 3 boats had fish finders that worked and we couldn't find the fish anywhere within a 40 minute boat ride from our cabin. We charted/marked very few groups or schools and very few singles. We noticed that the lake had very few minnows or bait fish around. We found almost no weeds in the lake and we traveled all over looking for the fish. We tried every pikey looking bay without result. We weren't missing bites or strikes either. I had less than 6 bites all week. Believe me, we brought a lot of crawlers home with us! I saw 4 northerns follow my lures, and I had two strikes that I lost the fish on. Pretty darn poor results for over 80+ hours of fishing. I noticed that there were few terns, gulls, or eagles on the lake which leads me to believe that they aren't finding much to eat there. Wally Mullens said, ""The walleye are milkin', and they're sick for a while after that."" Well, I'll tell you. You can catch walleye during the spawn and the fishing doesn't completely shut off for better than a full week like we saw it. Northern pike spawn much earlier than the walleyes and they were't there either. I saw that the lake maps he gave us were copies of the same maps we got on our fisrt trip in 2003 with the same ""hot spots"" marked. We never found that they produced any better than other spots we located on our own back then and I wonder if Wally has actually put a line in the water in a few years.Some other words of advice: Be careful about the amount of gas you use as Wally will charge you $8.00 per gallon for anything you use beyond the advertised 5 gallons per boat. He rounds the gallons and the dollars up. He will ask you if you want him to bring any ice in the middle of the week and it sounds likje a favor, He will then charge you handsomely for the chunks of lake ice he brings you. We found that the cabins were clean and neat and were freshly painted. They had plenty of firewood available and we needed the stove on several nights as the temps were in the low 40's. You will need to bring your own trash bags, toilet paper, and I suggest a stapler and a roll of screen to put on the front door of the cabin as there is no screened door to let air in and keep the many, many mosquitos out. We had trouble with the oven in our cabin and ended up using the outside grill alot, thought the tank we had was 80% empty and we had to boat up the lake to take one from a cabin that wasn't being used. The propane 'frige was venting directly into the camp until we fixed it with a beer can and some hose clamps we had brought. We filtered our drinking water and also brought cases of frozen bottled water to keep our beer coolers cold. The kitchen is well stocked with utensiles and great cast iron skillets to use in the event you actually catch a fish to cook and eat. Nice buildings with old appliances and furniture, good running boats and engines with easy docking, nice views, terrible fishing. (at least this week). It was never terrific fishing in the past but we returned, being optimistic about our chances of the fishing getting better."
1315127,Jack77,2011-06-06 14:46:00,168,After getting that report I would give up my deposit and go somewhere else. That sounds much like the worst fishing trip that I have ever been on. I know what the let down feels like after a much anticipated trip. I am sorry to hear about your trip.
1315143,phishfearme,2011-06-06 15:23:00,1242,"i made the mistake of fishing in this region many years ago and after many years in northwestern ontario, i think THE key issue here is the clarity of the water - ie; the FERTILITY of the water. most the lakes we now fish are stained and very fertile and are associated with a major river system. they're fertile with tons of food base and the walleye (and pike) populations are solid. even lakes in other regions of quebec and ontario that are clear (oligotropic lakes) hold poor walleye populations although they may hold wonderful lake trout populations. if you go for walleye, the first thing to ask is the clarity (or fertility) of the lake - try to avoid oligotropic lakes - unless you want the chance to catch lakers also - but don't look for excellent walleye days. i wish someone had told me this 20 years ago. phish"

1319749,Jaskonie,2011-06-18 13:10:00,80,"I see that you you threw in the occasional compliment which is nice. The place is up for sale, how does 750 grand sound. I may not be exact but I know its close."
1343154,Guest,2011-08-23 21:46:00,0,I must say you guys must have been at a different Sasseginaga than my son and I. We were there in May for just a couple of days fishing and it was very good. The second night (our last) fishermen were lined up waiting for their turn at the fish cleaning station. There were some very nice stringers. For the first time on the lake I thought we did quite well. Planning to go back in Sept for some more pickerel and some Lakers which we didn't get a chance to target in May.
1343836,Jaskonie,2011-08-25 20:30:00,80,"Its a good lake, it seems people have problems with the personalities of the outfitters so they rag on the lake a lil bit. We love the lake and want to try the Mullins camp next year. We had been staying at Bush Country but the price doesnt match the value for us anymore."

The propane 'fridge was venting directly into the camp until we fixed it with a beer can and some hose clamps we had brought.

1315250,retire55,2011-06-06 19:45:00,1029,"rimfire21: Sorry to read that you and your gang had such a terrible trip into Sasseginaga. I last fished Sasseginaga in late May 2008 out of Bush Country Camp in the north end of the lake. While the walleye didn't jump into the boat, we did catch ample walleye to eat and to take home. Other fishermen in camp that week experienced similar fishing. One explanation for this spring is that the spring was late in arriving. Most lakes in that area were still ice covered at the beginning of May. During a telephone conversation last Friday with the outfitter where I'll be fishing at the end of June, I asked how the bite was and his response was ""next question"". Apparently the walleye weren't biting in the Abitibi region last week."
