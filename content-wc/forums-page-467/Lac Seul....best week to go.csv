1343438,Ranger319,2011-08-24 17:52:00,166,What week/time frame do you feel is the best to head up? Usually go the 3rd week in June but just curious as to earlier or later might be better. Lets hear some opinions!Thanks

1343590,Mike Kansas,2011-08-25 07:47:00,1463,"We have fished Lac Seul in May,June,July,August and September during the last 25 years. My favorite time is the first three weeks in June. During that period the Eyes are still in shallow water and are easier to locate and I simply love shallow water (4' to12') jigging. This time of the year can produce some great days of 100 fish or more per person...not always but when they school up in the shallows you can catch so many that a case of ""Walleye Elbow"" can occur. I also love late July and August...the Eyes have moved to deeper water and fishing mid-lake humps and sunken islands can produce big numbers of fish and I believe that larger size fish are more common that time of year. Lac Seul is truly a Walleye paradise and while it is true that the fishing can be great anytime of the year it becomes very important that you understand what pattern the Eyes are in during their transistion from shallow spring to deep late summer. Even an idiot can catch Walleye on Lac Seul and I'm living proof of that. Good Luck, Mike Kansas PS...Forgot to mention that the Smallmouth bite is great in June too."
1343664,Bitinlight,2011-08-25 10:07:00,95,"We make two trips to the Northeast Section of Lac Seul each year and fish anywhere from Bear Narrows to Chamberlain Narrows and sometimes as far as Birch Narrows. The first trip is the first full week of June, and the 2nd is the second full week of July. The bite on both trips usually has been the same with jig and minnow/crawler as the primary presentation, but that's what we basically do. Our traditional spots produce during both trips, and every trip we find new spots to add to the list. During the July trip the fish might be a little deeper. This year in June the 12-15 foot range was the best with some fish shallower and deeper. In July, it was 15-18 with again some deeper and some shallower. Biggest thing is fish the wind. Size is the same on both trips, however, this July trip 24.5 was the biggest. Tons of slots and many fish from 20-23. Always have some 25's and 26's with an occasional 27 or 28. Numbers are always excellent. Never have had a bad trip to Lac Seul."
1343711,dan cardinal,2011-08-25 12:39:00,64,"I think alot depends on your preference as far as style of fishing. Like Mike Kansas says, it is very important to understand seasonal habits. I like August on Lac Seul...walleye are normally 20 to 30 FOW or deeper...often concentrated on mid lake...and that's my preference....I enjoy finding them and catching them deeper. I'm a jig fisherman too, and the deeper water just lends to the style I like. If you have more confidence fishing shallower water, then June is probably going to be better. The first week of August, two in my boat, we averaged 55+ walleye per day....lot's of 22's to 24's....also 25's and 26's every day....we used mostly straight plastic. I also agree whole-heartedly...never a bad time on Lac Seul!"
1343799,bigwalleye1,2011-08-25 17:08:00,2632,"I like both styles of fishing, deep rock and shoreline. Rather than put myself through all the agony, I thought the best answer was to take two trips, so we go second week of June and second week of July, and I get the best of both. That said, I do a lower budget trip, we do our own cooking, plan our own menus and travel a short distance to the landing every day with trailered boats, but I can do 2 such trips for the price of 1 outpost. For me, though, it's all about the fishing, not so much about where I sleep..."
1343895,Bitinlight,2011-08-26 06:40:00,95,"My buddy and I are lucky to have wives who love the outdoors and walleye fishing. We take them on the second Lac Seul trip in July which is like our summer vacation. The two gals fish 10 hrs. per day in all kinds of weather, and never say, ""Let's go in"". They are as good as most guys--bait their own hooks, tie jigs on, net fish, play the bite, etc. It makes it alot easier to ""sell"" a second trip if you take the boss, and she enjoys it. I asked my wife once what she would do if she had to choose between the Lac Seul trip and the winter trip we take to Mexico. She said she would probably choose to keep going on the Lac Seul trip. We are lucky enough to be able to stay at Lac Seul Outposts at Chamberlain Narrows both trips--very comfortable, but not extravagant. We have taken many July trips with the wives, including 6 fly-ins, but have become ""hooked"" on Lac Seul. Only thing missing is how to figure out how to get a third trip in. It's too long of a wait until next June!"
