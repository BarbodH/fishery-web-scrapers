Then they headed out to Shakespear island for the big pike. The way I understand it the wind came up and it took them 6 hours to get back to Beardmore. We fished Shakespear and King's Head island areas a number of time (12 miles off shore from Beardmore). Thankfully we had little weather to make travel difficult."
1345194,Finshady,2011-08-30 09:14:00,12,"Thanks for all the info. Great HelpWade, Could you help out on the launch location in Ombabika river. Is it close to the rapids or closer to the actual lake."
1345197,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2011-08-30 09:24:00,5533,"If you are familiar with the rapids on the river..............the ""landing"" is about 100-150 yards south of the rapids.You can see the rapids in the background."
1342502,Finshady,2011-08-22 09:48:00,12,"Just joined the site. Lots of good info. I am taking my annual trip to Pasha (northeast of Thunderbay) in a few weeks and was wondering if anyone had some answers to a few of my questions.1. Does anyone know if there is a launch north of Pasha to get out to Lake Nipigon other than at the Onaman River resort. Is there one directly onto lake Nipigon2. Has anyone fished the following lakes in recent years and does anyone have any info on results and accessibility. (drive in, portage, launch)- Jackson- Elbow- Conglomerate- FullertonThanks in advance for anyones input."
1342597,tikka851,2011-08-22 14:12:00,1,"Finshady,I fished Elbow and Jackson last September. Jackson is roughly a 3/4 mile hike in. Half of this was through lowland and can be quite wet. The road into Jackson was somewhat grown over as well, I did some pruning. Don't know if I would do this with a new pickup. Elbow is a short walk in. A couple hundred yards, if that. There is no real landing to speak of. Both of these lakes produced well for us (walleye). I would consider them numbers lakes. I am sure there are some bigger ones in there, but the largest I remember is 22"" or 23"". We did catch a few Northern in elbow(5-10 lbs.) but only targeted them for a short time."
1343162,Guest,2011-08-23 23:15:00,0,"I was at Pasha Lake Cabins earlier this month and fished both Jackson and Elbow. Jackson was a long, scratch your truck, rough ride in followed by a very long, rough, over logs, through muck trek into the lake. After that I caught 3 fish all day. The other boat with us had a better day with maybe 12 - 15 fish each. The camp owner, Chad, was in Jackson a few days after us and also had a very tough day with few fish. I wouldn't go back to Jackson. Elbow was my favorite lake there. The walk in is very easy (other than carrying in the motor) and short. There isn't a launch but Chad has a boat cached there. Elbow had the best structure of any of the lakes we fished. It is over 100' deep in parts and has sandy and rocky points and some vegetation near decent drop-offs. Many of the lakes we fished while at Pasha were fairly flat and soft-bottomed. I really enjoyed the look and feel of Elbow. There are some rocks to avoid while getting out to the main part of the lake but Chad can mark them on a map for you. There are also some nasty rocks down past the ""elbow"" but we fished primarily in the first arm of the lake and got a lot of fish. On the way back in we fished the river mouth that is literally right next to where the boats are kept. It drops off to over 20' right away. We got several fish there in a couple minutes but had to leave (we were already late for dinner). I would definitely start there at the river mouth. The only negative to Elbow is that it is a long drive. The best fishing we had was the Nipigon trip with Chad on the Little Jackfish River That was a lot of fun."
1343932,Guest,2011-08-26 08:41:00,0,Caught a mammoth pike & walleye on Oxaline Lake.......
1344151,eyemike,2011-08-26 19:44:00,233,"It has been a while since I have been to Conglomerate.It is a fair distance drive from Pasha on camp 40 road. the boats go in from the road. You travel up stream to the lake. The stream is very rocky and during low water conditions is real slow going. The lake is a nice little lake with an island in the middle. Fishing here was very good, especially for pike in the 7 to 12 lb. range. We also caught nice walleye but not near as good as some other portage lakes in the area. Real nice lake though."
1344491,Ogoki,2011-08-28 07:16:00,291,"St Joe Guy , I have fished other areas of the Little Jackfish River with great results . In fact my wife and I just got back from fishing way north of where the Jackfish enters Lake Nipigon . Do you think fishing where you fished the Jackfish with Pasha Lake Cabins would be something a person would want to do for a whole week ? One place where I have fished the Jackfish , I can only fish maybe 300 yards of the river . When you fish there do you fish out of a 14 ft boat or from shore ? Don't laugh when I say from shore as I do fantastic there fishing from shore . I just want to be able to fish more than one area if I commit a week to a trip like that . Thank you for any info you are willing to provide or send me a PM . Thanks. My wife and I have been flying in for our June trip and that trip is now costing us right at 4000 from the time we leave home until we get back . Yes I can afford it but after 35 fly-in trips I just don't want to spend that much for one trip. I would raher spread that out over 3 trip during the summer . She teaches and is off for the summer and I am self-emplyed and can take much of the summer off . My busy season is from now until December . I work 15 hour days this time of the year so I pay my dues LOL ."
1345103,Guest,2011-08-29 21:58:00,0,"Okogi, the Jackfish River trip is a guided trip on which the camp owner, Chad, takes out camp guests for an additional charge. He takes different guests throughout the week, so you wouldn't be fishing the river all week unless you hired him every day. Here is a video from another site that includes this river trip:http://www.idofishing.com/videos/vie...-river-ontario The video is on the show host's boat and they started from a different location on the lake but the river fishing looks to be in the same place. Chad took 6 of us out on his 20+ foot boat with a 225 HP that he keeps closer to the river than the dock in the video. After the drive to Nipigon it took us about 1/2 hour on Chad's boat to get to the river. We just fished one spot on the river and didn't get to the mouth or any other bays or rivers. We were there maybe 4 hours and the fishing was pretty much like in the video. I probably got 50 walleyes that afternoon."
1345115,Ogoki,2011-08-30 05:02:00,291,"St Joe Guy , The trip I am talking about is a camp out deal , UNGUIDED with 14 ft boats and motors . It is for ONE WEEK . My question is , is there fishing available where you can catch fish more than one spot ? I have fished where all the walleye were ""stacked"" at a falls . When you leave Lake Nipigon how far can you go up the Little Jackfish River , might be a better question . If there are 2 or 3 miles of fishable river, then I would go for it . Thanks for your info !! The video link answered my question . Thanks Again !!!"
1345117,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2011-08-30 05:33:00,5533,"There is a landing about 2 hours north of Pasha on the near Ombabika Bay. It's a haul on those roads and the last 2 miles are little more than a goat path. We took a Lund Pro Guide 1725 back in there and that's about all the landing will allow unless you bring a 2nd truck, shovels and some jerk straps. It was well worth it though. We spent the day exploring Jackfish and Ombabika Bay. Fishing and scenery were awesome everywhere as expected. As I'm sure you know, those roads are h*ll on your boat unless you've got a great rock guard.All these fish as well as many others came from all over Ombabika Bay. There is a perfect camping beach in the bay as well. When we pulled up on it for a shore lunch there were fresh moose tracks (we much have just missed it) on the beach."
1345120,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2011-08-30 05:42:00,5533,For that price you can do 4 Pasha Lake trips/year. We line in SE MN and we can do a husband/wife trip staying at Pasha for $1000/week (everything included). Chad has an excellent resort with unbelievable fishing all around him.
