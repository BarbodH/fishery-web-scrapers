I plan on upgrading my electronics to a lowrance elite 5 HDS sonar/gps combo too, so the chip would need to work with that particular unit.Thx for the responsesSammy"
1344504,walleyeguy13,2011-08-28 08:10:00,264,I think your only option is the Navionics Canada chip.
1344616,MorganMan,2011-08-28 15:56:00,341,"I know this year's Navionics Midwest chip also has Lac Seul. I don't know if it's called Midwest, but the one with Minnesota, Iowa, etc. I don't know what, if any, other lakes in Canada it has but I know it has Lac Seul."
1344656,rather-be-fishin,2011-08-28 18:10:00,429,It's called the Navionics N Region map. Just have to check Navionics web site to see if Platinum or Premium will fit your unit.
1345043,SinOrSwim,2011-08-29 18:24:00,1528,"Navionics is your only option as I just bought one. Morgan is right about Lac Seul being on the North chip but ONLY, I repeat ONLY on the cheap Hotmaps version and not the more expensive Premium or Platinum. I lucked out because the lake I wanted in Iowa was still in HD on the $99 chip along with Lac Seul. Thank you to the nice gentleman who helped me at Bass Pro. He had all the chips and we would plug them into one of their finders which was similar to my Humminbird 595c. If we hadn't have plugged them all in we would have never realized the premium didn't have it. Because once you buy it's yours."
