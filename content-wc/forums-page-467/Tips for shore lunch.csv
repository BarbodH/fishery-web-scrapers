1343639,jimirjr,2011-08-25 09:11:00,1149,"SHORE LUNCH?? Love it! WHEN SOMEONE ELSE IS COOKING IT for me... (i.e. a guide.) But... we never have a guide.We don't fish that far from base, so we go back for some cold ones and a quick snack or sandwhich. Our big meal is in the Eve... Now that said, we go in the Fall when the days are shorter... nitefall @ 7:30. Sunrise @ 7:00 Usually fix a GOOD breakfast which keeps us till supper... just my 2 cents"
1343848,Bigfishhunter,2011-08-25 20:48:00,803,"I always have a small tarp (10x10 or so) and some bungees in the boat. That way if it is raining a bit, just enough to mess the oil up, but not enough to head off the lake, you can still cook and enjoy. Heck, we have even crammed under there during some real downpours and had a nice fire and a meal."
1343856,NWwalleye,2011-08-25 21:22:00,223,I have 2 large beach umbrella's in my side storage compartment for the exact same thing .1 for cooking under and 1 for some people to eat under ..
1342986,SinOrSwim,2011-08-23 13:57:00,1528,Could you two post a link to the table you use? I'd be interested in something like that as getting old and fat makes it much more difficult to clean fish on my knees. I'm getting a cramp in my back thinking about it.
1343063,1shooter,2011-08-23 17:39:00,1493,This is the table we use.http://www.cabelas.com/product/Campi...3Bcat104267880

1343101,Rodney Bondele,2011-08-23 19:42:00,73,Things that work for me are canned potatoes. Be sure to drain the can completly before adding to the grease. No problems with canned potatoes through coustoms. Place fish bredding in a gallon zip lock bag. Cut walleye in two inch strips. Drop in bag and shake.Now I am hungry.Rodney Bondele
1343103,jiggster,2011-08-23 19:45:00,183,I also used a table like these for cooking on. I have had a campstove stand and a white cleaning board that fits in the mesh pouch in the front of the boat. I can start the stove and oil will the fish are being cleaned. We also have been micro the potatoes in the morning. Cooks faster.
1343122,Angry Minnow,2011-08-23 20:31:00,14,"We always carry a shore lunch bag with the old boy scout pots, tong's, hot pads and gloves, and were a fan of the farmer match system. One tip is that I will take a scrubby sponge put in a zip lock with some dish soap so we don't have to carry the bottle out. Also those oven mits don't work as well as a pair of welding gloves."
1343156,orchard frank,2011-08-23 21:57:00,1900,"In light syrup. Lots of good ways for the fish and spuds, but pears are simply the best way to finish it all off."
1343183,NWwalleye,2011-08-24 05:50:00,223,canned fruit and homemade cookies here for dessert ...
1343222,Mohleye,2011-08-24 07:42:00,368,"I have one of those tables too, and the other nice thing about them is each leg is height adjustable, so you can get it reasonably level easily."
1343383,eyeshaveit,2011-08-24 13:57:00,5,Take a pie iron find you some wild blueberries and make blueberry pies for desert sprinkled with a little powdered sugar. A great desert that fits that shore lunch theme I think.
1342455,SinOrSwim,2011-08-22 07:57:00,1528,"Started this in the general section and didn't get much traffic. Thought I'd see if the Canada section would bring more ideas/tips.not sure if there is anything better than a good shore lunch. Thought I'd see what others do and what tips they have learned over the years doing shore lunches.One of the best things we ever did was take a thermometer with us. One of the long thermometers from a turkey fryer work best. That way, there is no guess work on what temperature your oil is. First few years cooking over a fire there were many fillets either charred instantaneously or soggy with lack of temp. Also, using a propane cooker vs a fire is a great benefit too. Cleaning fish using the oar from the boat will help keep the knife sharp so it doesn't drag against the rocks."
1342631,Pikeslayer8,2011-08-22 16:13:00,1460,"Nice thread Sin. Most of us realize that some of our most memorable trips were in part the obstacles we overcome. Shore lunch provides a vehicle to expose the competentcy(or lack thereof) of the organizer of the ""box"".My experience has been that we usually decide to to it during breakfast and if the weather is ok. Time to do the dishes, load the box, take a crap, put fresh live bait in boat,fill boat cooler, etc. Camp chefs get distracted. Past trips I have forgotten: forks, shore lunch breading, fillet knives, and worst of all the fish flipper spatula. Outcome: forks: eat your beans with a Lazy Ikebreading: Who needs it to eat the best fish on the planetfillet Knives: got a couple spares in our boxesspatula: cut a forked tree branchCheck your box twice and sent it out with the first boat out to be put on your shore lunch campsite. And lay off the guy who forgot"
1342670,SinOrSwim,2011-08-22 17:57:00,1528,"Ahh, you bring up a great point. We have actually made a list and put it in a laminated cover to use to make sure when we load the tote we have everything. There have been many a time when a boat is heading back to camp to get some fish batter or some other necessity. plastic tote with a checklistcheck"
1342692,MorganMan,2011-08-22 18:39:00,341,"LOL, pikeslayer.......just brought back memories of the same things over the years in our group. Even with a list, we have forgotten things. Your summary of the morning is very accurate and takes me back to the cabin. I am removing myself from tote responsibilities going forward and I will sit back and chuckle.....oh, and say ""I told you so""."
1342698,bigwalleye1,2011-08-22 18:47:00,2632,"Sin, I replied in the ""General"" category, but here's some more. Pack the box the night before as you're cooking dinner on the grill. You're in and out enough to grab things as you think of them. I have boat box dedicated to shore lunch, so with a quick glance I can tell what I'm missing. Try cooking in cast iron. It's a pain to carry around, but with the big HP on the back, the boat doesn't know it. Cast iron heats slower, but holds the heat a long time, so the oil isn't subject to the wild temp swings that charfry one fillet while soggying up the next one. Spring for one of those chromed long handled dippers they sell at Fleet by the deep fry stuff. You can lift a couple fillets at one and hold them while they drain off. I carry all my spices in a ziplock, all the paper plates and forks and trash bags and dish towels, etc the same way. Get one of the small diameter 10 lb LP cylinders. I put an ice cream pail over the collar and it just fits into the single battery slot under the floor in my Pro-V. Out of sight, and out of the way. The pail helps to keep the collar from biting into any wiring that runs thru that little compartment."
1342774,MorganMan,2011-08-23 01:56:00,341,"Bigwalleye.....thanks for the info on the shore lunch ideas, good stuff. We are on fly ins so we are subject to the larger propane tanks, but they help at the front of the boat to plane on the water with our itty bitty 15hp motors! Cast iron definitely helps with moderation on oil temp and the thermometer is a big help. We are still Fall guys and can't wait to get up there."
1342785,lund scout,2011-08-23 05:29:00,1,No need to carry a thermometer. Just throw a farmers match in the oil and it will light right at 350 degrees. Been doing it for years and it really works well. Just put them in a pill container and throw them in shore lunch kit.
1342837,SinOrSwim,2011-08-23 08:06:00,1528,"I'm not really sure how carrying a thermometer is different than carrying a box of matches? The thermometer allows you to see the temp after cooking a bunch of fillets and getting the temp back to normal. And, I don't have to fish out used matches out of my oil. Cool trick though."
1342864,plumberjoe,2011-08-23 09:14:00,54,We added a small aluminum rollup table this year. It worked great for cleaning fish then a quick rinse we cooked on it. The one we got fits in a bag smaller than a foldup lawn chair and only weighs a couple of pounds. No more cleaning fish on my hands and knees. Paid 15 dollars at Walmart.
1342927,NWwalleye,2011-08-23 11:31:00,223,"I got the bigger version of that table, my best investment for shorelunches.I also do the match in the oil.... Easy thermometer .."
