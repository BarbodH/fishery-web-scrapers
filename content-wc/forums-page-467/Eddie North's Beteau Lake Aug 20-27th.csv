Arms too tired from hauling in many big gators to type a long report yet but once all pictures have been gathered I will do a proper report. Eddie and Craig were great and really care about making your trip a memorable experience and the camp has some of the most beautiful scenery you will ever see. Even with the low water levels this fall, the fishing was outstanding with many Pike over 40"" and Walleye up to 32"" !!! If you are sitting on the fence about taking a trip to Eddie North's, I suggest you won't be disappointed as this is a truly amazing place with incredible fishing. This was a common view in the middle of the boat... And this was a personal best for me but not the largest of the week! Thanks Eddie Special thanks to Dana and the Wallace's for the company & good times. More to follow soon..."
