1344534,jab,2011-08-28 09:04:00,12,Just got back from Lac De Mille Lacs the walleye fishing was extremely poor! Looking for a change for next year. I have been on Lac Suel in the past during June and have had great luck. We also have heard that Press Lake is excellent. Has anyone has experience with both lakes or can point us to what traditionally has the best fishing? Thanks
