1342189,steve.a,2011-08-21 07:47:00,274,"Speaking of going in to Obabikon Lake, how do most people go in? Trolling motor, main motor, kicker motor, idle, on plane?"
1342303,Obabikon,2011-08-21 15:10:00,2370,"This year, it had better be trolling motor or big motor trimmed WAY up. Water's low."
1342484,1shooter,2011-08-22 09:09:00,1493,Has anyone ever fished in Caribou lake that is located in the back of Obabikon Lake? Curious if you have and if you did any good.
1342522,Obabikon,2011-08-22 10:35:00,2370,My favorite place on all of Lake of the Woods. Very beautiful water... dark tannon staind. Fishing is pretty good up there... walleyes and northerns mostly. One of the few places that regularly produces Large Mouth bass in the area.
1342563,1shooter,2011-08-22 12:18:00,1493,are there any maps out there that show structure for that lake?
1342716,Obabikon,2011-08-22 19:23:00,2370,"No there aren't. There's only one ""reef"" it's in the middle of the SouthEast cover. It's hitable, and sometimes full of walleye. But, for the most part, they're in the weedbeds."
1344417,1shooter,2011-08-27 19:31:00,1493,Has the fishing picked up or is it still slow?
1344517,J-Man,2011-08-28 08:31:00,191,Most reports have been that fish are very scattered...lots of wind the last couple of weeks and several storm cells moving through in that time period have the lake and the fish a little stirred up. Fish were still deeper than what you might normally expect this time of year. Weather has been stable for a couple of days now and the forecast looks reasonable as well. The long weekend should be great.
1344847,1shooter,2011-08-29 08:52:00,1493,Heading up for the long weekend. Hopefully it will pick up by then.
1341175,1shooter,2011-08-17 08:58:00,1493,Any reports of how fishing is going right now?
1341341,Obabikon,2011-08-17 18:37:00,2370,"Kind of slow... windy today. Hit a lul when we had a big algea bloom. But, it'll pick up shortly. The fish have been deep."
1341350,rpieske,2011-08-17 19:09:00,1276,"Windy today......that was an understatement. I was by your place last week and it looked good. Saw that BIG muskie twice. Still won't take anything, but likes to look."
1341560,Bill Krejca,2011-08-18 14:37:00,6107,"I'm beginning to get a little worried about getting into Obabikon Lake when I go up on Sep 16. The basin report shows the water level is dropping, looks about 1/2 ft lower right now than last year in Sep. It can be rather tricky getting out when the water is low and the current is going in. Hope it rains some! Bill Krejca"
1341568,1shooter,2011-08-18 15:32:00,1493,You just need to go a little faster. ;-)
1341623,Bill Krejca,2011-08-18 19:46:00,6107,"Hey, I go half fast normally."
1341740,lakerbreaker,2011-08-19 08:54:00,253,"We fished Miles on Monday for the first time-Lots of small eyes and saugers-Did get enough 16-17"" eyes for our group dinner though-A few tank sized perch too-They were between 22-30 feet of water-We got most of our fish on jig/minnow combo-We liked the area enough we will be looking for a resort in that area next year-"
1341922,Obabikon,2011-08-19 18:21:00,2370,"www.obabikon.com Not a bad place, if you ask me! Right next to Miles Bay... Very protected area."
1341925,lakerbreaker,2011-08-19 18:40:00,253,"Yes, looks like a great place. Unfortunately it looks to be about triple the price we pay at the resort we stay now. We are a large group (20 plus people) and all bring kids. I have searched this site and see a couple other options as well."
1341928,Obabikon,2011-08-19 18:55:00,2370,Feel free to send me a pm. I'd be happy to suggest several local areas that provide house keeping plans at affordable rates.
