The toe of the boot was hot but it was lot's of little fish.with Some good quailty marble eyes mixed in. Larry's kid, first year down and he smashed a 27 inch some quick pics and back she goes. That kid we be smiling for a while.. We were there for a week and that fish was the biggest but we were pulling lot's of 22,23 in a couple of 24. But I like the smaller ones the 16 and 17 for shore lunch. Yumm fish and beans Can't wait for next year"
