1345270,jeb73,2011-08-30 14:17:00,3,"Anyone ever stay on Fox Lake Island Camp? It's the red cottage coming through the straights on Little Fox Lake before Lount Lake. I've fished this part of the English River many years, I'm 38, first year I went I was 5 and still going yearly with family and friends. Anyway, I've never been able to find out about the red cottage on Fox Lake. Maybe it's private? It appears like it's a rental place."
1345337,greenie,2011-08-30 17:57:00,87,"Pretty sure it's private. I think the people that own it were leaving the day we were leaving. We ran into them at the marina. There's a shed at the marina that has a sign on it...""Fox Lake Camp""."
1345469,jeb73,2011-08-31 06:14:00,3,"I know they have different boats there from time to time. Some years they have boats that say Fox Lake Camp and some years they have boats that are private boats. I've gone up in spring and fall a few times and most of the time there are people in camp. I've heard different stories, but it's not on the internet so it probably is private. The water must have dropped significantly since late June. It was down from the past two years when my group was up, but certainly not as low as it is now. Fishing was slow to great for us this year, one day in particular we had 20 or more walleyes around or over 25 inches, most out of one hole. That was a combined total for 12 guys out of six boats. Other days were much slower than normal, but even the slow days we caught some very nice fish, the biggest walleye was 27.5 inches. We also had 10 or so northern 38 inches or over with one being 43. The past three years have all been a little slower than usual. Probably just a fluke thing because when they turned on this year it was really good for quantity and size."
1342423,Bigstorm,2011-08-22 05:57:00,799,"Very interested to see how you did, I'm heading up there on 8/31. Have never fished Fox or Lount/Separation, we always go up river. Last I heard (3 weeks ago) the water was down 3 to 4 ft from normal"
1342595,kansasity,2011-08-22 14:08:00,80,"Bigstorm, heading up the same day, fly in Friday morning, look like it's supposed to rain up there a few days next week. I hope it does so maybe the water will come back up a little. Our camp is empty until we arrive next Friday. Good luck."
1343132,kansasity,2011-08-23 20:49:00,80,"So did you catch any, hopefully get to see some good pics before we leave. Hope you had fun!"
1343859,kansasity,2011-08-25 21:29:00,80,Where's the report and pics? Would love to see them!
1344340,greenie,2011-08-27 12:29:00,87,"OK Kansas....Sorry guys, things at work has been nuts since getting back and I haven't been able to get on the net at all.Things were different this year for sure. Fishing is not the same as usual. LOW, LOW WATER and NO CURRENT whatsoever! Huh? Yes, there is no current what so ever. The only current we found from the mouth of Indian Lake to Separation Lake was at the outlet of Lount to Separation which we didn't fish, only because we were exploring for the day on Lount and a little into Separation. Using the breeze was a big help most days. Moving around and when locating fish they'd be stacked like cord wood. We jig fished with crawlers only; sometimes using 1/16 oz. in 4-5ft. of water. One spot there'd be a NE wind, we drifted over big boulders using 1/16 oz. jigs never feeling bottom. The walleyes would smack the jig going over the top of the boulder. 9 out of 10 times it was a fish and not a snag.Bring a drift sock for slowing the boat down when drifting with the wind. We used the transom mount trolling motor A LOT! Used the anchor once. (That was a complete waste of time) It's like fishing a lake; not river fishing at all. Walleyes our boat caught were 13"" - 23½"". Can count on one hand how many saugers I caught. The little guys were not around much at all. One spot I caught a 23""er and took pic released; very next second both of us had a 23"" er and 23½"" er all in the matter of 4 minutes. That was awesome.Smallmouth were everywhere this year. In a picture below we were drifting out in front of Kenora Air Fly in camp; that one went 3½-4lbs.Northerns were nice nice up to 7-12lbs. All caught on jigs fishing for walleye.This was by far the best trip for quality in the five years of going to the English River, Grassy Narrows, Ont. Quality not quantity.I can't wait for next year!I have pics of the Nestor Falls Fly in camp and the Kenora Air Fly in camp below."
1344341,greenie,2011-08-27 12:30:00,87,More pics....
1344633,Bigstorm,2011-08-28 17:15:00,799,"Great report! We are leaving wednesday night and should be on the water by10AM thursday. I've personally never been up there when the water was this low, should be interesting though. I'm hoping the walleyes are stacked up in some of our normal deeper spots"
1344817,kansasity,2011-08-29 07:49:00,80,"Awsome report! Leaving for Kenora Thursday morning, should be on the water Friday afternoon! Great pics, where abouts did you fish? Some in Lount I see, nice smallie! You didn't fish the 400 hole? Anyway nice pics and report!!!"
1345052,greenie,2011-08-29 18:49:00,87,Fished on the SE side of Lount and straight out in front of the Lount Lake Lodge Flyin. Out by the island to the right (south of lodge). Did way more exploring than fishing in Lount. Maybe next year we will do more fishing. Lount is only about 4-5 miles down river from our camping island. Have fun Bigstorm & Kansasity!!! Remember pics and reports!!!!
1345263,kansasity,2011-08-30 13:39:00,80,"Good luck Bigstorm! Make sure you got your warm stuff, I think we are gonna be in for a shocker come Friday. Looks like a cold front coming through. High 60, and low of around 50. Thanks again Greenie for all the info. 1 and a half days and a wake up!"
1310230,kansasity,2011-05-23 08:48:00,80,"I should be receiving my map today, i'm like a kid waiting for a piece of candy."
1310279,FishTwentyFourSeven,2011-05-23 10:27:00,38,"Hey Jigman, How did you get into the Moose Lake? I have always wanted to go there but not really sure how to get in there without a plane. How big were the northern in there? Thanks for the help."
1310330,Jig Man,2011-05-23 12:36:00,95,"The boats were put there by the outfitter, just a walk through the woods. I do not recall the name of the outfitter, he is out of business. Northerns were decent size, not huge but not hammer handles either."
1310666,thunderatwork,2011-05-24 08:56:00,79,bill (krash) krylock was thew name of the old outfitter- he was a treat for sure
1311118,kansasity,2011-05-25 10:01:00,80,"Ya, I heard that. Mary Jane from Kenora Air is who we are going with. My friends have been going to her outposts for years. Mainly Carroll Lake which she doesn't have anymore. Thats how we got to go to Lount Lake. There are only two places on Lount, Kenora Air and Nestor Falls."
1311257,Jig Man,2011-05-25 17:10:00,95,Am I correct that bill (krash) krylock met his demise by living up to his name?
1311310,kansasity,2011-05-25 19:28:00,80,"Maybe, either way i'm glad he's not flying us in. Not with the nickname KRASH."
1311489,thunderatwork,2011-05-26 09:30:00,79,"i know he fell off the wagon, i believe he got into debt with kenora air and they just took over his rights to lount. not sure how the ""rights"" thing to have camps on queensland works"
1342192,kansasity,2011-08-21 07:58:00,80,11 more days and we will be landing on lount lake about this time and can't wait!
1342221,greenie,2011-08-21 08:58:00,87,Just got back from Little Fox Lake Island Camp Thursday. Will post pics and report soon.
1308140,kansasity,2011-05-17 14:37:00,80,"Hey everyone! Just wondering if anyone on here has a trip planned to Lount Lake and would like to hear how they do, heading up there in Sept and just wondering if anyone has fished Lount basicly. How they did, yada yada yada. Thanks"
1308458,greenie,2011-05-18 08:46:00,87,Where are you staying on Lount Lake?
1308955,kansasity,2011-05-19 10:19:00,80,"With Kenora air, close to the 400 hole. Not to far from where Seperation lake flows into Lount."
1309314,greenie,2011-05-20 08:35:00,87,When we go in August...Not sure we are going this year?? We Stay on the Fox Lake Island Camp. (Tenting for a week) We are about 5-7 miles East from Lount Lake. Was planning on fishing more into Lount last year but ended up going 19 miles north to Scotty and Dumpy. I think I know what cabin your staying in. There's only two on Lount if not mistaken. One on the NW side and one on the SE side. Your on the NW side? Good fishing from what I've heard.
1309397,kansasity,2011-05-20 11:32:00,80,"Yup, that's the one. I hope it's good fishing. but ya only 2 on lount. It's my first fly-in. I just ordered a map from fishingmapsplus.com on Monday, hopefully a good investment! How was Fox lake fishing?"
1309408,Jig Man,2011-05-20 12:01:00,95,Lount Lake was the first Fly-In I ever did back around 1996. Same lodge you are going to but it was run back thyen by diffrent outfitter named Crash. Lount Lake fishing was decent but that was a long time ago. The best part is they had a portage lake to go to. It is the lake in the Top Right corner of this maphttp://www.nestorfalls.com/lakeMaps/LountLake.pdf The lake was crystal clear and you coud sight fish the Northerns. It was blast watching 3 Northern fight over your lure. Simply the most fun afternoon of fishing I ever had and I have been back to Canada almost yearly since then.
1309419,kansasity,2011-05-20 12:25:00,80,Was there a boat to use? Did you have to carry your motor? How tough was the portage? Are you talking about Moose Lake?
1309480,FishTwentyFourSeven,2011-05-20 15:03:00,38,This is my 10th of 11th year. PM me and I will give you my email address and we can talk.
1309757,Jig Man,2011-05-21 14:40:00,95,Yes I think it was Moose Lake. 2 Boats and 1 motor were there. Probably carried gas. I don't recall the portgae it was 15 +/- years ago.
1309933,greenie,2011-05-22 08:47:00,87,If we didn't want to go more than a mile from camp all week; we wouldn't have to! Fishing is just that good!!
