1343382,eyeshaveit,2011-08-24 13:52:00,5,I used Vados Bait in Minneapolis. Called them a week ahead they were packed in legal bedding and ready to go. First time I've used them but it definitely won't be the last. Good prices too.
1343470,Lazy Fisherman,2011-08-24 19:33:00,276,"Thanks eyeshaveit, but we will be heading up Rt.53 to Duluth."
1343481,rather-be-fishin,2011-08-24 20:03:00,429,"Fisherman's Corner, Duluth.....Corner of Midway road and Hwy 53. Call ahead and they will pack them in bedding for Canada. Fisherman's Corner fishermanscorner.net (218) 729-5369 5675 Miller Trunk Hwy, Duluth, MN Have a Great Trip! RBF"
1343495,Campcountry,2011-08-24 20:59:00,164,If buying nightcrawlers in Kenora the best places are the Canadian Tire store and the Husky gas station beside Sunset Baits on the east side of town. The reason why is that only these two places get their crawlers from Manny's Baits out of Manitoba. Everyone else that I have tried get theirs out of the Toronto area and the quality has been extremely poor - because of the weather I am told - but the quality was bad last year too.Manny's are much better quality.

1343806,JDP,2011-08-25 17:27:00,1457,I have used Vado's crawlers for many years on Canadian trips.Top quality and very healthy crawlers at a fair price.http://www.vadosbait.com/
1343840,Golden Eagle,2011-08-25 20:35:00,2642,Bought my first ever nightcrawlers for Canada fishing earlier this month for a week of fishing LOTW. Got 'em at Sportsman's Service. Around $21 for a box of 10 dozen. Great worms. Have shopped there for 39 years.
1343857,JayM5209,2011-08-25 21:24:00,1050,"Another vote for Vados Bait. Current price is $69.99 for a full flat packed in bedding for Canada. With 500 in a standard flat, that's roughly 41 dozen at $1.70/dozen.Another option that I used this past June is Knutson's bait in Michigan. Their current price is $59.99 for a full flat packed in bedding for Canada, or about $1.46/dozen. I always order online or by phone about three weeks ahead of time and they schedule UPS or FedEx deliver the day before I leave. This year my order from Knutsons, including delivery, was cheaper than I could buy a flat in dirt locally. Excellent quality, too."
