Luke had been tearing up the pike trolling deep diving husky jerk, but when I told him there were big Musky in the part of Lac Suel we decided to fish the last day he went for my biggest bait, a 12"" jointed believer. Would not have been my choice but I've learned it doesn't matter what I think up there, let him put what ever lure he wants on and odds are he'll catch something and it means a lot more when he picked out the lure whether its from my box or a new one he picks out at the tackle shop on the way up. Great memories!"

1345171,Stu,2011-08-30 07:58:00,472,Luke is a lucky young man. Having a dad who spends time with him is more of a treasure than any fish he will ever catch. Great job and please keep us up-dated on your future trips. Thanks for the story - Stu

1345340,rnnonmt,2011-08-30 18:06:00,992,Love it! Great Job to your son. Been taking my 11 year old for the past 3 years to Lac Seul. Doesnt bother me a bit that he out-fishes me. Keep taking your son with Dad!
