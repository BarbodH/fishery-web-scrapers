I am wondering which depth range I should first target, all you fall guys must have some opinions on a starting depth range that you have faith in that time of year. Thanks for the help. Matt"

Early in my stay I pounded walleyes in 3.5 - 4.5 fow. I was sitting in a bay where a tiny crick seeped into the lake. Some sort of hatch must have been going on. Same location that greens up earliest when ice breaks up. September had been a warm month.Weather turned cooler after a couple of days and fish moved into deeper water after a day or so. From then on I had most of my success in moving water. Also got into fish on points and humps at 8' - 18'. Had the whole lake & camp to myself for the entire week until moose hunters flew in.Same lake for the September 24, 2011 week is looking awfully good to me right now. I've been home, from 8 days fishing on LOTW, for almost 16 days and am missing NW Ontario something terrible."
