1343800,walleye4life,2011-08-25 17:15:00,54,"All of the above are great places to fish and all good operations.After making several trips to Thunderhook you just cannot beat their hospitality either at Smoothrock or an Outpost.The ouposts are all solar, new Lund 16ft boats with 15 and 20hp Yamaha's. Ice delivered during the week and many more.We stayed at Almos Bay this summer during the 3rd week of July and the fishing was great. The Smoothrock / Funger system has over 30,000 acres of fishable water."
