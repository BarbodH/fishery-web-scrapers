1459031,v-bay gord,2012-07-08 08:21:00,3168,In my experience you will do better with a mono or flourocarbon leader. I think that holds true for most species.

Just got home yesterday. I'll send you my report.poochpig @frontier.comPooch"

1459046,Bigfishhunter,2012-07-08 08:53:00,803,"the lake that I fish on, requires a stealth approach, more so than other lakes. I have done extensive testing on jigs with superline tied straight to the jig and lines with a clear mono leader. I have never had the jig with superline even come close to the number of fish that the one with the leader has. Water is super clear here though, and the fish are fished pretty hard. I don't think it hurts to have a leader. Use a double uni to connect lines."
