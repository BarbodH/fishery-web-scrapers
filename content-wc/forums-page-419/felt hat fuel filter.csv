1459148,campchick,2012-07-08 12:48:00,96,"Yes, it works. I once heard a story about a guy who was impatient and wanted it to filter faster so he cut a hole in the pointy end. How stupid is that?"
1459384,phishfearme,2012-07-09 06:31:00,1242,"i think we need to define what ""it works"" means - i just don't see this method removing all water - it may hold back water preferentially over gas but some must slip through. pete only said to filter all the gas through the felt with no other instructions and i recall seeing the flow through the felt slow down after we stopped pumping and there being a small puddle of what appeared to be an oily gas mixture in the bottom of the flet funnel but it would then just seep down into the tank. we probably shoulda been told to not let that happen and just discard this slow running amount. so it kinda ""works"" if you have the correct procedure and are trained in it. the answer though is to prevent water from getting in in the first place. thanks for th responses. phish"
1459058,phishfearme,2012-07-08 09:14:00,1242,"if you read my Williams Lake trip report, you noted that we were cursed with water in the gas. the outfitter's solution was to provide a ""felt hat"" to place in the funnel and hand pump the fuel from the 55 gallon drum to the boat tanks through this filter. it is supposed to prevent the water from going through to the tanks. sorry, but i'm a doubting thomas here even though the outfitter (pete johnson) would/should/could be considered an expert. gas alone goes directly through felt water alone goes directly through felt but for some capilary reason, the felt will prevent water from passing if the water and gas are mixed??? i don't think so. even if it does - to some extent - SOME water WILL get through!! i think this is one for the Mythbusters (and plan to submit it) but i would like to know what the experts on WC think. phish"
1459087,tooski,2012-07-08 10:06:00,393,Even high tech gas filters do not get all the water out of gas. I doubt someones noggin cover would work.
1459090,v-bay gord,2012-07-08 10:10:00,3168,"I've seen the felt hat thing done in the past. Must be an ""old school"" solution. Not sure if it works for water but I wouldn't be surprised if it did."
1459103,4JawChuck,2012-07-08 10:39:00,277,"It works, this technique was used in WWII. I've tried it and it gets most of the water as long as the felt is dry...but not all of it. It's a better than nothing solution."
1459119,Bill Krejca,2012-07-08 11:16:00,6107,"The technique was in use even before WW ll. Through bad experiences with water in the gas, my dad used a special purchased felt disc filter on his bronze funnel as far back as the 1930's in Minnesota and Canada. Gas was hard to get at that time that didn't have water in it. I remember in the 1940's and later that he always used that funnel before putting the gas in his tank- he liked to show me the water that had been in the gas - it showed up as a slippery mercury-like fluid sliding on top of the felt. Bill Krejca"
1459125,tooski,2012-07-08 11:42:00,393,So I'm guessing you never got to try the felt filter? Otherwise mythbusters would not be needed...Either the water-gas issue didn't come up till later in the week or you did not get the cure till you left Williams lake?
1459134,wallydave,2012-07-08 12:05:00,2151,This idea could serve dual purpose! Filter the gas and keep skeeters and black flies away!!
1459135,Guest,2012-07-08 12:06:00,0,"Used the felt hat before, works pretty well"
1459138,JayM5209,2012-07-08 12:12:00,1050,None of my felt hats!! . . . they're all Stetsons.
1459146,bigwalleye1,2012-07-08 12:38:00,2632,"I recall an old timer talking about using a chamois shirt as a filter in a pinch in the bush back in the early floatplane days. Real leather chamois, like a car drying chamois, is what he was talking about. I'd buy into the felt argument as well."
