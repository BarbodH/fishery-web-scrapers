I drove by so many lakes and rarely saw anyone fishing. I can't be the first to have wondered ""is the fishing good in ""that"" lake?"" Do you think that all of the lakes have fish? Has anyone ever been overcome and stopped tried any of them out?"

I have to guess that some of the little lakes are overrun with snake pike, but I'm sure there are some gems out there. Anything on a highway that doesn't already have a lodge I would be skeptical of."
