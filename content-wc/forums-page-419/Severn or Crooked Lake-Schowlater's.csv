Based on the information from this site I am confident in Ed's operation, but I could not find any recent feedback on these two lakes.. Can anyone give me their experiences on these two lakes.. Thanks in advance for any feeback.."

We talked for a while about his outposts and other resorts. He was very knowledgable about all the lakes in that area and other lodge owners. He seemed very trustworthy, I would have booked with him if I was not already booked with Halley's. Just a thought"
1459097,kona7,2012-07-08 10:30:00,6,Pikeman;Thanks for the comments. I have usually found the W/C community to be straight shooters on giving out fishing experiences with outfitters..I will give it a couple of extra days to see if anyone on here has fished these lakes. Ed is going to give me some references that I will also follow-up on..

I explained to him that we were interested in big pike along with walleyes, but some of the guys in the group wanted to fish for smallies. His outposts were a bit north of smallmouth waters, but the pike action looked great. Best of luck"

Great numbers and quality of fish and great equipment. I'm headed back in early Sept again. I've also already booked a different location for mid June 2013 with Showalter, and will probably do a second trip with him in fall 2013. I've traded conversations with a fellow that has fished both locations you are looking at. I know both locations are great for walleye. He's been to Crooked many many times and to Severn just once. Please PM me your email address and i can forward you his report from this June, maybe get you in touch with him as he is not on WC. Everyone that I've spoken with about Showalter says one thing - top notch outfitter with some excellent fishing opportunities. PS - Like pikeman14 mentioned, I dont think any of his outposts have smallmouth."

I 'almost' got tired of catching walleye. Showalters is a great operation. The setup at Carroll lake was great. I can only imagine that is replicated throughout the other outposts. Weather (heavy fog) was the only issue that prevented us from leaving Carroll on the last day. I will be going back to Showalters! -DJ"
