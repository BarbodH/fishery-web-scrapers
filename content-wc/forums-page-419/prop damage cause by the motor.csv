1459065,phishfearme,2012-07-08 09:25:00,1242,"during our Williams Lake trip, one of our boats was backing out of the dock and CRUNCH! the captain thought he'd hit a rock - and badly. he raised the motor and two of the three prop blades were seroisly damaged - in spite of the fact that stainless steel ""rock hopper"" guards were installed that significantly prevent prop damage. he called on Dr. Phish to evaluate the situation and i noted that there were no rocks near the dock with any indication of prop damage. then i observed that the was a loose ""cowling"" or ""metal trim"" piece that was atteched to the lower motor end just above the prop that was dangling by a single bolt. this was a steel piece and we all know that in a fight that steel beats aluminum. apparently this ""high speed trim"" as Pete called it, had vibrated loose and the rudder portion of the trim twisted back and killed the prop. who would design such a monster that helps ever so slightly on top end speed but can come loose with a single point of failure and destoy the prop?? i hesitate to mention the manufacturer (Yamha 25hp) but wonder of this has ever happened to others? and, during the drive home, we noted a boat in tow with a yamaha 150 on it and it also had this trip just above the prop. yamaha is NOT on my list of acceptable motors. comment? thoughts? thanks, phish"

Some ""lock tight"" on the threads of the bolt will help......as will a cursory examination of the motor occasionally. By the way, the rudder does compensate for the pull of the prop and is more noticeable on certain boats or on how they are loaded. There are times when the rudder is out of adjustment that you may feel like you've been lifting weights with your steering arm after a whole day."
