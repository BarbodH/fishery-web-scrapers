1459702,northernbite,2012-07-09 19:04:00,1186,Have you ever tried to fish a crawler way up north? Well I have many years ago on my first trip and you can't get a walleye to hit. So now it is just jig tails.Paul
1459734,fishincrazy,2012-07-09 20:21:00,1282,NICE!!!!!!FC
1459835,Mohleye,2012-07-10 06:38:00,368,"Northernbite, I'd suggest sometime putting a half crawler on with your jig and plastic tail, especially mid-summer. Your opinion on crawlers might change."
1459133,fishincrazy,2012-07-08 12:04:00,1282,So someone throwing stones about bait has become racist?NICE!!!!!Tech I wonder you automatically assume Allen is talking about IndiansI think he means Canadian citizens calling them native means there Canadian citizens.FC
1459162,HighTech,2012-07-08 13:31:00,75,"It's fairly clear to me what he means,, but perhaps he could be the one to clear up his statement."
1459174,fishincrazy,2012-07-08 14:14:00,1282,"I guess it's all in how we look at things I took it to mean CANADIANS not what color or race.We've crossed the line and there's no going back now I guess.I have seen people of all races commit crimes against nature.For us as ethical sportsmen and women arguing over Black and white,brown,yellow whatever is stupid.You want to make it about color that's up to you.After all online we're all smart,rich,handsome,and right.tech I'm sorry you feel this way,but I guess it is what it is.FC"
1459182,v-bay gord,2012-07-08 14:39:00,3168,"If you witness something that is so obviously wrong, and do nothing to correct it (ie MNR tip line) then you become part of the problem."
1459221,HighTech,2012-07-08 16:28:00,75,"fishin,, I agree with you, it is about criminals and crime, it is never about grouping a class of people or a citizenry as a group when describing crime. I have have little tolerance when races are classified as something, be it intellegent, lazy, criminals or whatever. A description of someone destroying food as ""native Canadian"" did not sit well with me. If there was a person doing this he was of poor character to say the least. A man is judged by his character and not the color of his skin. (MLK Jr) As for me I think it's time I went fishing!! Fishin crazy, you have a good sense of humor, you should join me someday !!"
1459299,fishincrazy,2012-07-08 20:09:00,1282,"I would consider it an honor but do not find myself that far north or west on a regular basis(it's like 1500 miles from Philly).I would however be delighted to at least invision myself being able to make the trip.Thank you for your kind words and I think the more we can laugh at ourselves and how important we think we are the better we can treat each other.I travel North occasionally and will remember this invite.(we fish the eastern part of your province)Thank you Tech, if you are ever south let me know and that offer goes both ways.FC"
1459467,v-bay gord,2012-07-09 10:04:00,3168,"Here's a blurb from today that relates to the topic..... MNR Says Most Anglers Following The Rules By Mike Ebbeling - July 9th, 2012 - 8:40am Most anglers are following the rules. Almost 95% of anglers checked in a recent enforcement blitz in the Sioux Lookout area were abiding by the rules. However, 16 charges and 25 warnings were issued at over 25 fishing lodges and a provincial park. Violations included possessing an over-limit of fish, transporting live fish, unlawfully packaged fish and fishing without a licence. The Ministry of Natural Resources reminds folks that conversation officers do routine checks to make sure anglers are obeying the law."

1458838,@Lunker,2012-07-07 15:49:00,835,"""I'm surprised that Ontario and others have not banned crawlers - at least in the north. They are non-native and their is renewed interest in keeping them from forests.""Just out of curiosity.......where do those ""Canadian crawlers"" come from if they're not native?As far as the original post, the same people who disregard the live bait laws are probably also shoplifters, DUI-ers, always exceed speed limits, and miscreants in general. I think, for the most part, people are either law-abiding, or look to bend / break it any time they have the opportunity."
1458844,Paul H,2012-07-07 16:06:00,1232,"Most come from Southern Ontario golf courses. Night crawlers are not native to any of NA. I've seen Robins in Northern Ontario and wondered what they eat,but what did thjey eat before the white man.. Here's a website from MN re: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives...rms/index.html"
1458885,Guest,2012-07-07 18:54:00,0,"I'm sorry some of you guys can't differentiate between a legitimate concern and a troll. I want to emphasize that I have never heard anyone brag about circumventing Canadian fishing regulations and my post didn't suggest that either. I suspect those that do circumvent the regulations are probably law abiding citizens in their everyday life, generally speaking. However, sometimes some visitors knowingly break the regulations. In addition to bait infractions, I've seen walleye intended for transport cleaned inappropriately (e.g. failure to keep the skin of the walleye fully intact when fishermen are taking walleye home from the province of Quebec). I suspect that most outfitters know exactly what clients do and don't do (garbage bins and fish gut pails provide much information). However, I also suspect that many outfitters are reluctant to speak to clients suspected of breaking fishing regulations for fear of losing clients. Besides I believe it is unfair to put the responsibility for enforcing the regulations on outfitters. Even though border guards can ask questions, I believe that the biggest strides can be gained through education. As to why I chose to post as a guest rather than my normal handle, it was because I don't need to endure verbal crap for years to come just because I raised a touchy subject. I understand and accept that some of you have never seen anyone circumvent the regulations. I see that as positive information in that it potentially means that the problem is small scale as has been suggested by other posters."
1458888,Obabikon,2012-07-07 19:07:00,2370,"I think your view of the average outfitter's position is incorrect. I would much rather personally correct my guests on fishing regulations, rather than have an MNR officer write them a ticket for $400... then them turn around to me and say why didn't you tell me. People in general (Americans and Canadians) aren't out looking to cheat the system. They don't typically break laws for the heck of it."
1458889,Obabikon,2012-07-07 19:09:00,2370,"http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodcons...rod_092379.pdf Also, at $500 for smuggling in leeches, who's dumb enough to try?"
1458900,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-07 19:32:00,1460,"Heck no on smuggling leeches, but there was the time in my younger wilder years where I snuck in a thimbleful of soil in a flat of crawlers. I do agree with one thing though. The title of this thread."
1458919,rjbuckeye,2012-07-07 20:47:00,9,"I've been coming to Canada every year for over sixty years and must say that most laws are followed. There's is always those who push it with a beer in the boat, etc. Night crawlers are native to Canada and can be found in the yard outside our cabin. I get asked every year if I'm bringing crawlers in and if in bedding! The camp near our cabin has lost much business over the years and is just hanging on! Any more arguments about the laws will shut him down and all the others because the laws are so limiting. I won't come 2000 miles for a just a swim! I think the person who started this is wanting to swim alone!"
1458922,AllenW,2012-07-07 20:56:00,11482,"Well, if your not a troll you must be hitting the Canadian hate Americans forums, nobody I have known for the over 35+ years of going to Canada would take a chance smuggling bait into Canada, or anybody I've talked to for that fact.Considering the chance of getting searched for drugs, just doesn't seem worth it.Does it happen, ya I suppose, but I watched two native Canadians repeatedly beat musky's and northern's to death with a paddle, then throw them back into the lake, so does that mean all Canadians are like that?No, I don't think so.Al"
1458970,v-bay gord,2012-07-08 06:07:00,3168,"I think the majority of outfitters educate and monitor their guests to make sure all laws and regulations are followed. I also know that most would not hesitate to ""kick some arse"" if a guest was flagrantly violating. Of course there is a small minority that probably look the other way, or just run a shoddy operation......these folk do not stay in business for very long. In the end ""what goes around, comes around"". I think if as a guest you are troubled by what is happening around you, you should speak up or contact the MNR about your concerns......they do have a toll free tip line. 1-877-TIPS-MNR (847-7667)"
1458985,HighTech,2012-07-08 06:56:00,75,"I have seen white people post stupitidy on the internet, but does that make all of them stupid?"
1458585,Guest,2012-07-06 17:45:00,0,"Over the years that I have frequented fishing lodges, I have continued to hear from some of our American neighbours that they don't abide with Canadian laws regarding bringing live bait (crawlers or leeches) into Canada. I'm at a loss to understand this practice. Whenever I visit the USA, I try my best to ensure I don't contravene any US laws - just seems like the neighbouring thing to do - to respect each others laws. The Canadian laws regarding bringing live bait into Canada have been in force long enough for everyone to know the laws. The fact that border guards don't always ask American fishermen coming into Canada whether they have any leeches or crawlers in dirt doesn't eliminate the existence of the laws. Even though I'm cognizant of the economic impact of the recreational fishing industry to Canada, I can't help but question the rationale of guests that knowingly flaunt our laws. Just wondering...."
1458590,wingmann,2012-07-06 18:06:00,42,"Not sure how often you have been told by an American that they don't obey that law. I have never heard anyone say they wouldn't. Whenever we bring worms from the US to Canada, they are always in bedding. Same goes for everyone I know that brings them over the border. Maybe someone was pulling your leg. This isn't hard to do so I have a hard time beliving someone wouldn't do the right thing.Wingmann"
1458591,dutchboy,2012-07-06 18:07:00,5717,"Don't you know most of us arrogant Americans are above the law? Facts are it's a societal thing. Sad to say we as a people don't seem to respect others, be we Americans, Iranians, Russians, Chinese, Canadians or what ever. Just as some prefer to speed and also drink and drive some like to push the limit in regards to border crossings. Often you will find those same folks will be over limit or choose to ignore the limits and slots designed to protect our resources. I will never say all Americans are this way anymore then I would lump all Canadians into one group. It's a sad situation and it won't get better anytime soon. Look around you...........people break the laws and ignore other peoples rights all the time. Kinda makes you want to move to the Arctic doesn't it?"
1458597,v-bay gord,2012-07-06 18:36:00,3168,"That hasn't been my experience in dealing with many Americans over the past 20 years. Maybe the odd gripe about laws etc, but can't say I've seen anyone flaunt the regulations."
1458605,Obabikon,2012-07-06 19:22:00,2370,"First of all, you're allowed to bring crawlers in (as long they aren't in dirt). Maybe you meant minnows and leeches. We put a lot of people through our resort, and not a single time has someone broken this law. Infact, this is one that most border guards ensure is kept up with. If this actually happens, my guess is it's less than 1:5000 actually break this law."
1458672,Swifty,2012-07-07 05:21:00,9,"This seems like a pretty ethnocentric view. I do my best to respect Canadian Laws when i visit Canada as you do when you visit the US. In fact, so does everyone i associate with. At the end of the day there are a$$hole Americans and there are a$$hole Canadians and i highly doubt the ratio is all that different."
1458683,Dogbreath,2012-07-07 06:29:00,494,"I think Swifty has it right, the percentage is pretty close....(maybe a couple less in Canada )I have also noticed from previous posts on this subject, that not everyone is aware that transporting bait fish from lake to lake is an offence, it is also done up here by our own who do not know it is an offense. Not everyone is into fishing as deeply as many of us are.Maybe ""Just wondering"" is trolling for an argument....."

I've personally brought up flats of crawlers various times (properly packed by Cabela's). Never hear anyone in a camp ""bragging"" on bringing north their illegal live bait......if the original poster has heard this numerous times at different camps from Americans that they don't ""abide"" the Canadian laws, I'd have to ask which camps are you staying at ? The owners of the lodges/camps where I go would not tolerate that behavior. Rich B"
