Looking forward to a good week of relaxing and fishing.Look us up we will be the camp flying the Nova Scotia flag.We started this practice over 20 years ago just to let people know were we are from."

Looking for any helpful hints from folks that have been recently. The houseboat is typically tied off at the northern point near obitcuawn(sp) sounds like the water is high. Curious on average depth of fish. Thanks"
1456628,NYBowHunter,2012-07-02 08:46:00,35,"Just got back this past Saturday - the water is high, about one foot under the high mark but according to our outfitter it was starting to go down. Best depths for walleye were between the 10 - 16 feet of water. We mostly trolled and had two days where they were going ridiculously good. Weather was crazy though - we were stuck in the cabin for almost the entire day last Tuesday with gale force winds and heavy rain."
1457242,Kman67rsss,2012-07-03 15:24:00,30,Thanks. Glad you had a good trip. Leaving mid afternoon tomorrow. What part of the reservoir were you on?
1457274,NYBowHunter,2012-07-03 16:26:00,35,We were in Baie du Nord (Baie Saraana) with the outfitter of the same name. The cabins there used to be owned by Air Melancon. Have a great time and a safe trip!
1457339,eight4,2012-07-03 18:56:00,11,Our group are going up to Baie du Nord on the 13th. How was the outfitter and fishing.
1457457,Freytown,2012-07-04 06:32:00,770,"Baie du Nord and Baie Saraana are two separate & different baie's. The outfitter ""Baie du Nord"" is only on baie du north as far as I am aware."
1457771,NYBowHunter,2012-07-04 17:52:00,35,"I was under the impression that baie du nord was a part of the greater baie Saraana but I guess I'm wrong.Eight - we had really crazy weather with lots of wind and rain for a day and a half but we had two days of fantastic fishing. We trolled cranks and worm rigs and couldn't finish a pass without catching 4 or 5. We stayed at the Pointe and the caretaker there was pretty good, though not as good as Gil who used to be there. Jason is filling in as the caretaker at the baie. Everything went pretty smoothly."
1457784,vteye,2012-07-04 18:23:00,812,How did do on the Grand Brochett? Its been couple years an hoping to go upthere next year. What sized walleyes were you catching?
1457792,NYBowHunter,2012-07-04 18:37:00,35,"We concentrated on pike for one full day when it was hot and sunny - nothing big... although my brother lost a monster. He caught a 9 1/2 lb and I caught a 6. We were surprized as our pike hotspots had fish on the small side. As far as 'eyes, they were mostly in the 15 - 19 inch range with one 4 pounder and a couple 3's. Lots of fun though!"
1459266,Guest,2012-07-08 18:14:00,0,I am going on the 14 of this month to Baie du Nord. have been to Baie du Nord numerous times and the fishing has always been good just as the others have said. But it usually takes a day or two to find them since they are aways moving around. The outfitter is good but not as good as when it was with Air Melancon.
