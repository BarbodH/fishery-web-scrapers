1458774,tackleman,2012-07-07 11:07:00,444,"i just got off the lake, spent 3 hours chasing the elusive walleye, boy are they hiding,One spot i went to, normally good this time of the year, spent 3/4 hour there, got 1 bite, no fish. the next spot ( round island) spent 1/2 hour there, no bites and i'm covering depths from 12 to 30 feet.finally went to Iowa point and picked up 8 to 10 off the point in 25 feet of water.the problem is , we are experiencing a MAJOR mayfly hatch and the walleye are having a feast of them.the sun is shining and the temps are in the high 70s to 80s"

Sounds like mayfly is major issue we had em back in June and I knew few people up in early June that had them.Keep your bait presentation slow and simple. Hook and Minnow or Jig will be best and move SLOW, SLOW, SLOW.Search for structure. Last day we were up there our group we were with just hammered em we had half dozen or more over 25"" with a bunch between 20-25"". We were fishing an area with alot of humps. Some places you could be in 40fow with others in 10-15 fow. That day we were anchored fronnt of the boat was in 21-23 FOW back was in 31-33 fow.Good Luck"
1459176,Moondog,2012-07-08 14:18:00,362,Have been here for 8 weeks and have seen mayflies in various amounts since early June but NOW......holy #hit!!! I agree with Tackleman but the only problem fishing anywhere near land are the flies. ouch. It has been an odd year but then every year is different. Tackleman........leaving for Colorado in the morning. Enjoyed the time we spent on the water and drinking a few cold ones...........see you in May. MJ
