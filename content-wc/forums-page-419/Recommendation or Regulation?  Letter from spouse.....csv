1458322,rnnonmt,2012-07-06 07:43:00,992,"At the border crossing this year in late June at Intl Falls/Ft Francis I was asked for the first time in four years of bringing my son into Canada for the letter from my spouse to allow my son with me into Canada. As always with the border agents I was polite and direct with my answers/responses. I told the border agent I did not have one but he let us through anyway and said next time make sure you have one. I have tried to find a definitive answer and read other posts on this but can't seem to nail it down to whether it is a ""recommendation or regulation."" It really doesn't matter to me either way. I am still happily married and could easily have my wife write the letter. Just interested in whether it is Canadian/Ontario Law or not. Thanks Happy Fishing!"
1458332,10point,2012-07-06 07:57:00,102,I was told I needed the same thing this year when crossing at the Soo. My wife is from Canada so we have crossed many times and have never needed it but I have taken one before but not his time. They let us through and also told me I had too much gas and that bear spray was not allowed to be brought in. Just let us through and didn't take anything or make us pay tariff on the gas. I have been researching the gas thing and I am not so sure about that one.
1458339,tv4fish,2012-07-06 08:13:00,2694,"I do believe it is a regulation (law). Same old story - some they enforce - some they ""let go"" ...........http://www.canlaw.com/legalforms/travelconsent.htm"
1458350,a3dad,2012-07-06 08:37:00,115,Its basically to protect the kid. How do they know that the parent isn't trying to flee the country without the other parent's permission? I know that when we applied for a US passport for my kids both parents had to be present or if only my wife went to the passport agency they needed a letter from me saying it was ok. I'd recommend bringing a letter anytime you leave the country just to be on the safe side.
1458373,UKBDM,2012-07-06 09:30:00,178,I have been crossing for almost 20 years proimarily at Int'l Falls. Every agent is different. Some ask for the letter and say you have to have it. I have seen where having the letter got me thru quickly and my BIL right behind me in line have to go in for questioning because he didn't have it.I take it every year and produce it upon request. You never know.
1458540,Dogbreath,2012-07-06 15:57:00,494,"As usually the case with cops, border guards, fish cops etc., your attitude has a whole lot to do with the outcome. As shown by the above posts, good attitude ""usually"" equals good results."

1458571,rnnonmt,2012-07-06 17:16:00,992,"Thanks for the links and replies guys. I still don't see where it is law. Best I can see is a recommendation for less hassle or ultimately being denied entry when crossing. Nonetheless, I will get one for next years trip..... and then I probably won't be asked for it. You know the old saying if you are prepared for it.... you won't need it type of deal. Thanks again. By the way... what if you are the only legal or custodial guardian? What if your spouse is deceased? Then what??? LOL"

We had the parents write a letter for his son and for us to drive his vehicle and had both notarized. Along with this we had proper insurance and the kids id. Got through the border without a hitch which otherwise could have been quite a hassle. I guess I look at it as whatever will make it easier for all involved and less stress. I want to get in the water as fast as I can and not spend time at the border. Whether we like it or not they are looking out for everyone's best interest, since they don't know our own personal histories."
