I choose to shoulder my burden, and then some, taking two trips to ensure plenty of stories remembrances and anecdotes to share, and consuming sufficient quantities of fish, bourbon, ice cubes and fresh air to ensure balance in the economic engine of our friends to the north."

1404665,HeHooksHimself,2012-03-09 08:17:00,725,"Toddskie, I highly recommend you do not do this. It only leads to trouble. First of all, it is hard on your home life. The wife will not be happy when there is never enough money to remodel the kitchen, but always enough to go to Canada. Then there is the ""once a year is not enough"" syndrome, which just doubles the misery. Just going to Canada is such a long drive and the gas prices are so high! Then there is the ""one case of beer per person rule"" which generally means you have to buy beer in Canada at around $40 per case. The exchange rate sucks so you are not getting any discount for your once strong dollar. When you get to your destination, you find that it is not the Taj Mahal. In fact you might even have to relieve yourself outdoors or in an outhouse. You spend all day in a boat and for what? A few fish? You can do this a lot closer to home. It almost always rains when I go to Canada and it is often colder than you expect, especially in the spring. Then if you wait until summer there are bugs! At meal time you are either having to make a fire on shore or eating sandwiches with stale bread in the boat. You have to cook your own stuff and clean up after you eat. There is no TV or anything so you are stuck playing cards, drinking beer and smoking cigars. It stays light way into the night so you get so little sleep you are never rested. Fish guts, cracked hands, having to reline your pole or replace hooks, lines in the prop, dropping stuff overboard, slipping off the rocks or dock into the water. I mean this is no vacation! Therefore I think my ""Canada Eh?"" brothers and sisters will agree that you should think long and hard before taking your first trip to Canada. Any input WCers?"

Your wife will never understand the ""inside"" jokes about the trip, she will feel left out. The bonding that will happed when you and your sun fish until dark, around 10PM, will also leave your wife wondering, what happened to my husband and son??Just a few things to consider!!Condiser yourself warned!!"
