WALLEYE CENTRAL is HEBNER LAKE. In 45+ years of fishing Ontario I have never seen so many 16 to 20 inch eyes. Caught a eye with a 9"" eye in it's mouth and caught two eyes on a crank bait at the same time. The inlet and exit rivers provided the most action but eyes were caught everywhere. Eyes caught using jigs with twister tails and crank baits. No live bait. Caught approx. 1300 fish with 90% being eyes. Pike did not turn on till last 2 days. Weather good with water temps in the 60's and dropping lake water. Lake dropped approx. 12"" during 1 week trip. Scenery awesome. If anyone wants to make this trip, Hebner is a flyin out of Nakina."
