Research on the Little Brown Bat in the Parklands Region Published by adminon December 8, 2009in Behind the Scenes Series. Closed Jack Dubois, (Retired) Associate Curator of Mammalogy and Ornithology One of the more fascinating creatures in Manitoba is the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus). These small insect eaters gather in groups of up to 10,000 to overwinter together in caves, known as hibernacula. Only a few caves are sufficiently deep and have the necessary structure to maintain their temperature at 5 °C, allowing the bats to hibernate in them from late September to late April. Caves in the Parklands region are critical to the survival of this species in Manitoba. Little brown bats, in their natural habitat, the cave, will form one of the major dioramas of the Parklands/Mixed Woods Gallery. Little brown bats recreated for placement in the cave Cave in early construction stage Little brown bats feed on small flying insects like moths and mosquitoes, each eating several grams every night. In the summer, groups of female bats live in nursery colonies in hollow trees and attics. They each give birth to one young in early June. The males disperse singly around the province, roosting in trees and sometimes under building soffits. All of them return to the caves in early August, where mating occurs prior to winter hibernation. In 1988, Jack Dubois began to study the little brown bat. His objectives were to map the distribution of little brown bats in Manitoba; to locate as many hibernacula and summer nursery colonies as possible, and to determine where bats found in hibernacula spend summers and where bats found in summer colonies overwinter. To map distributions and to monitor seasonal movements of bats, a banding program was set up. Speleological Society of Manitoba members and other volunteers helped find bat caves. Information provided by home and cottage owners, the Manitoba Department of Natural Resources and others led to the summer banding of bats in residential and cottage areas throughout the province and into adjacent northwestern Ontario around Lake of the Woods. Most banding has occurred in caves in the Grand Rapids and Gypsumville areas, and in St. George Cave, north of Hodgson. Sleeping bats are plucked by hand from the cave wall and placed in a cloth bag. Once they are captured, the bats are examined to determine sex, reproductive status, age, signs of injuries and whether external parasites, like fleas and mites, are present. Previously banded bats are recorded and any injuries and/or parasites are noted. Time in capture and handling is kept to a minimum to avoid stressing the animals. So far, approximately 6,000 little brown bats have been banded in caves and approximately 750 at nursery colonies. Band returns have shown the bats to be very loyal to their summer and winter roosts. The majority of those banded in the summer on the west side of the province appear to hibernate in a single cave in south central Manitoba, sometimes travelling more than 300 km each way. Less than one percent of bats banded in a particular cave have ever been found in another cave. As a result of this study, at least 13 caves are known to serve as hibernacula for little brown bats in Manitoba. The largest discovered to date is St. George Cave. After several years of effort, the Province of Manitoba has declared this critical cave and a small area around it an ecological reserve. This is the most stringent legal protection available to a natural feature. More than 20,000 little browns spend each winter in that cave and they are very vulnerable to any form of disturbance while deep in their winter sleep."
1459721,phishfearme,2012-07-09 19:46:00,1242,thanks gord - the answer is that they migrate to caves! there must not be many of them though and they probably should be protected like ****. anything that eats 600 mosquitos an hour is a fried to all bush fisherman. phish
1459067,phishfearme,2012-07-08 09:31:00,1242,"our williams lake cabin was infested with bats - one of the 5 bedrooms had guano all over the beds and floor (as also did larrys's room next to it) - what a mess. the outfitter knows about them and is trying to do somethink short of trying to kill them all (which may or may not be successful) including foaming everywhere (to no avail) and installing a bat house outside. no luck so far. that's all very well - but - where do these bats go in the winter? they don't/can't migrate, they can't dig significantly and there's no real caves or mines in the area that would protect them from 40degC/F below zero, yet they seem to thrive up in the north land. anyone know for sure? thanks, phish"
1459100,5richards,2012-07-08 10:36:00,131,This certainly could be a health consideration -- read http://voices.yahoo.com/the-hidden-d...no-108570.html for your own edification. I'd want at least a partial refund for the cabin alone!

1459212,lassh,2012-07-08 16:09:00,553,"They go to the bat cave boy wonder! I didn't know they thrived that far north. There must be some caves or underground places they winter. The bats in that cabin may be planning to stay. I had a parasitology professor who did his doctorate on bat parasites. They spent a lot of time crawling around in caves taking guano samples. They wore respirators when around the dung. The biggest danger from bat guano is from a mold that grows in the poo. People can contract histoplasmosis which is a severe respiratory ailment from the fungus that thrives on old bat doo. I hope the fishing was good. If you or your group notice cold like symptoms, you should get to the doctor to be checked out. The dung probably wasn't there long enough to grow the fungus but to be on safe side, if you notice respiratory prbolems go to a good doc."

There must be some caves or underground places they winter. The bats in that cabin may be planning to stay. i think this is the answer - there MUST be some caves or underground places where they can winter - and staying in the cabin is not an option as the unheated inside will get almost as cold as the outside. but - did you ever try to dig up in the candian schield? it's all hard rock and not real ameanable to cave formation. by the way, the guano dried quite rapidly and was easily swept up so i don't think fungus would be an issue. we swept up what was there and left it in a pile on the floor and told pete. he can then judge how fast the buildup is. they did install bat houses while we were there - be interesting to see if they work - none of mine work here in PA. phish"
1459434,SinOrSwim,2012-07-09 08:36:00,1528,"That stinks about your trip. A lot of money and you get one week usually to go to cananda. We had one years ago that was just an awful week all the way around. Were promised a lot of things that never transpired. I had some bats in a rental property years ago and what a pain in the rear! I was new to rental properties so called a guy who said he was the bat expert and he could get rid of em. Paid him a fair amount of money and all he did was calk the fascia boards and duct tape a window screen to the side of the house. Apparently, this was to let them out but they couldn't get back in. Sort of worked but most couldn't get out and died in there. Stunk like crazy. The issue inside wasn't poop but hte little bat bugs (can't remember what they were called). Small red spider like bugs that bit my tenant."
