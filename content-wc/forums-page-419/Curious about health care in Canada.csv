1458717,Curryale,2012-07-07 08:29:00,50,"There are really three systems in Ontario dealing with car accidents. 1. No fault benefits - are attached to every Ontario automobile policy. They are your own benefits that can cover things like physiotherapy and massage therapy. 2. The second is OHIP treatment. The Ontario government and the insurance companies have a deal where the insurers pay the Ontario government a large sum of money every year. In exchange the government agrees not to sue the insurers for the medical expenses it incurs due to mvas. 3. A tort system. That's where one (who is not negligent) sues someone who is at fault for the accident. They can sue for pain and suffering, past and future loss of income, past and future medical care not already covered by 1 and 2. Number 3 is almost exactally the same as in many US states. The biggest difference in Ontario is that the minimum insurance limits are 200k. Most people have a million. That means large jury awards on tort cases actually get paid unlike in many other jurisdictions."
1458764,fishincrazy,2012-07-07 10:29:00,1282,Thanks Dog this issue has been beaten to death in our media I'm glad to finally read some facts about health care in both countries.FC
1458765,fishincrazy,2012-07-07 10:31:00,1282,Here's a hook removal video check it out:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfSGAso5vpIThis is the closest to what I do.I learned how to dp it watching Bill Dance on TV.His video is the best but I cannot find it anywhere.I'm going to message him and see if he can send it to me.FC
1458539,Obabikon,2012-07-06 15:54:00,2370,"If you're on LOTW's... stop by the camp, I'll take the hook out for free. I do the trick with mono-line... works like a snap. I've taken two out already this year with no problems."
1458545,fishincrazy,2012-07-06 16:05:00,1282,Nice!!I've done this for friends before it is really quite easy.Everyone should learn how to do it!Well my experience with Socialist medicine came at the expense of the lodge owners at the time young daughter.She had juvenile arthritis of some sort and could not get any quality care N of the border.My father at the time volunteered at the Shriners Hospital for children here in Philly.He worked something out with a specialist and brought the whole family down for free and treated her.I've lost contact with her over the years but I know in Canada the doctors couldn't help her it wasn't considered a priority.It is a shame when people suffer at the hands of their governmentWe here in the states have this to look forward to with Obamacare.Just my $.02.FC
1458568,v-bay gord,2012-07-06 17:10:00,3168,"Sorry, but the Canadian health care system is not as disfunctional as you are trying to portray......but I suppose that's the nature of the U.S. political scene. Besides, the proposals you have in the U.S. are not anywhere near what we have up here......totally different. We have a ""not for profit"" system."
1458577,tooski,2012-07-06 17:24:00,393,Hey Gord- how about a video on hook removal? I realize you would have to wait till the right opportunity.....Maybe stick a hook in a steak or chop. If it came out as well as your others it might seriously be of help to someone....
1458586,v-bay gord,2012-07-06 17:49:00,3168,"I just did a hook removal last week! Darn, didn't even think about doing a video. Next time.........or perhaps I can use a melon or steak as the pseudo victim. Thanks for the suggestion tooski!"
1458638,fishincrazy,2012-07-06 21:11:00,1282,"I did a little research and it seems Canadian health care isn't quite as disfunctional as we have been lead to believe,I know that my friend Norm's daughter could not get the care she needed and she suffered this is why she came south.It seems that Canadians do come to the US for medical services but the numbers are not as high as we have been lead to believe here in the states.In fact people have been sent South for speciality procedures by Canadian Doctors.Again not as many as we have been lead to believe.It also seems that procedures provided in the states are covered by the Canadian health care system mostly.I also read that many of the Canadians who come south pay for there own care to avoid being found out by their families,and friends.So Gord I will do more research this topic intrests me.Any information you could provide would be great.Here's a hook removal video check it out:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfSGAso5vpIFC"
1458648,Campcountry,2012-07-06 21:53:00,164,"Our health system in Canada actually does work very well and it is really amusing to hear all of the falsehoods being passed around by politicians south of the border. Sad though in a way as the American public are reduced to basing their decisions on their own health care system on a lot of misinformation. The only real gripe Canadians have with our health care system is that there is a longer wait time to arrange non urgent appointments with specialists and also for elective procedures by specialists than there is in a for-profit system. Since health care is a provincial responsibility that wait can vary a great deal depending on which province you are in. This can lead to a small number of Canadians to choosing to make an appointment with a US Specialist because they do not want to wait. Depending on the specialist, the wait can be a few weeks to a few months. When you hear about Canadians crossing the border for treatment - that is what it is about. Keep in mind that the majority of Canadians live within an hour or two of the border so it is no big deal."
1458689,fishincrazy,2012-07-07 06:51:00,1282,"Camp this is what I read about online and you know they never lie online. I also found some interesting numbers on doctor to public ratios it said in Canada it was 2.2 doctors to every 1000 people where as it is 2.4 to every 1000 in the states.I got this from the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development. 2010-09-28.Seems very equal until you take into account the population difference.With more doctors wait times are less in the states.It does seem however urgent medical care is provided in an urgent fashion,unlike what we here in the states have been told.FC"
1458692,Dogbreath,2012-07-07 07:13:00,494,"Hey Fishincrazy, read this link, it was done by AARP, it trys to dispell a few myths about both systems. It sounds fair and accurate to me.In my experiences living both sides of the border, I couldnt find any discrepancies.http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/government-elections/info-03-2012/myths-canada-health-care.html?cmp=NLC-WBLTR-MPTEST-051112-F1-1&USEG_ID"
1458711,Guest,2012-07-07 08:10:00,0,"I would be interested to know the procedure you use to remove a hook. When I went to the ER in Sioux Lookout they used the procedure I knew about but had never used - 1. cut the hook back away from the entry point 2. wiggle it until the point breaks the surface 3. grab the point and pull out the rest of the hook. If I'd had anaesthetic and antibiotic ointment, or maybe even ice, I could have tried it myself."
1458296,Shellback,2012-07-06 07:04:00,8083,"So through your taxes, you have ""free"", and I use the term free loosely, health care. How about medical expenses that are caused by accidents, such as the work place or automobile accidents. If a party is found negligent, are they responsible to pick up the tab? I imagine here in the states, there are billions of dollars in medical costs due to accidents. Well maybe not medical costs, but lawyer fees. LOL! Would an individual sue the responsible party, then have to repay the medical costs, or the the govt go right after the responsible party?"
1458313,Guest,2012-07-06 07:25:00,0,Any injury is covered (no charge to you directly) under the Canadian health care system unless it is a result of an auto accident or workplace incident. In those cases you get the same medical treatment only payment of the treatment is paid behind the scene by workers compensation or the auto insurer. You don't need to get involved for anything at all unless you feel you deserve more compensation for your injuries which in that case you can use the courts and sue for a judgement award (pain and suffering..etc.) but your immediate medical requirements are covered for you by the system.
1458342,Shellback,2012-07-06 08:21:00,8083,"Ah Ha, I see they didn't cut the lawyers out of the equation all together. LOL!"
1458344,v-bay gord,2012-07-06 08:28:00,3168,I believe the amount that a person can sue for is limited.......so basically it's not an environment preferred by parasitic lawyers........
1458363,Shellback,2012-07-06 09:07:00,8083,Dang! We sure could afford to send a few north if needed. LOL!
1458471,Guest,2012-07-06 13:45:00,0,"This is a bit off-topic, but I am a Yank who was at a resort on Minnitaki last week. Buried one prong of a treble hook into the ball of my thumb. When I showed it to the resort owner he licked his chops and pulled out a giant set of wire cutters, which induced me to go to the ER in Sioux Lookout. They were very skilled and professional but insisted I pay in full before leaving, despite my having a pocketful of insurance cards. The procedure was $300, less than I expected and much better than being carved up by my friend who runs the camp. I was told that about half of the $300 was the expense of entering me into their database."
1458473,Jesse-WI,2012-07-06 13:53:00,534,"I worked up in Toronto for 2 years and this is the norm. Check your own coverage before you cross the border so you fully understand just how much of the upfront money you spend will be reimbursed. Unless you are in critical shape, they want the money first if you do not have a health card from Canada. In my case, short of a life and death situation, it was always wiser to catch a plane home immediately or cross the border and seek assistance in Buffalo."
1458479,tooski,2012-07-06 14:01:00,393,"Spent three days in Geraldton hospital after a car-moose encounter. Fractureed back, broken ankle, stitches, dozens of x-rays, doctors costs, emergency vehicle and paramedics cost. Total bill around $2500.00. That""s about what it cost for a soda and bag of chips at Cleveland Clinic..."
1458517,nemusky,2012-07-06 15:05:00,60,"This last spring my uncle who is 70 and on blood thinners took a treble through his pointer finger. His son (also along on the trip) is a hospital executive back here in the states and he used his company provided satellite phone to call his pals and they all suggested that he head back to the US for the removal. Not sure entirely why, like if it had to deal with medicare or what not but I found it interesting."
1458534,Dogbreath,2012-07-06 15:43:00,494,"A little off topic, but here is article I found interestinghttp://www.aarp.org/politics-society/government-elections/info-03-2012/myths-canada-health-care.html?cmp=NLC-WBLTR-MPTEST-051112-F1-1&USEG_IDRe 300 bucks to take out a fish hook???? I paid 100 bucks for a chest cold diagnosis in FL... both seem pretty reasonable to me for out of state/province/country coverage"
