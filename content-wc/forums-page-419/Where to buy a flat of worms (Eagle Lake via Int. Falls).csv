1458247,JCsGoneFishin,2012-07-05 23:16:00,34,Heading to Eagle Lake (via International Falls) and need to know where to buy a flat of worms...??? Do I have to order ahead of time?
1458284,v-bay gord,2012-07-06 06:37:00,3168,"If you're waiting till you get up here then either Eagle Junction (807-755-2226) at the corner of hwy 594 and 17, or Bobby's Corner (807-227-2099) in Vermilion Bay would be your choices. Yes, I would phone to make sure they will have a flat when you get there. Alternatively, you can bring them across the border if packed in artificial bedding. While you're making calls, perhaps one to your outfitter to see if they are still there....."
1458348,JCsGoneFishin,2012-07-06 08:36:00,34,Why do I need to call and see if they are still there? (saw this comment a couple of times...)
1458541,81Saluki,2012-07-06 15:59:00,97,"We always stop at The Outdoorsman's Headquarters in IFalls. They're just off to the left kind of behind a liquor store (address is 1130 3rd Ave ... phone 218/283-9337). Prices are much better than Bobby's Corner in VBay and are packed for crossing the border. You might want to call them to ask about current prices or whether you can ""reserve"" a flat.If you buy them there, the only suggestion I have is to make sure you can store them in a cool spot in your vehicle as they won't survive a 3-hour trip in a boat under a tarp in warm temps. We learned that lesson the hard way many years ago. 81Saluki"
1458619,v-bay gord,2012-07-06 20:27:00,3168,I believe a flat of crawlers at Eagle Junction is $60....not sure how that compares. JC.....I pm'd you on your question.
