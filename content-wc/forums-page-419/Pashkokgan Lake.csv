1443312,btmbncr,2012-05-31 17:48:00,492,I'm looking into taking a trip to this lake with my wife this fall.Probably the first 2 weeks of September.Has anyone fished it for walleyes at this time of the year?I searched the forum and didn't find much about it.I was wondering if it was a good walleye lake.I would appreciate any help/info.Thanks Bill
1443367,Fishoil,2012-05-31 20:31:00,1277,I've been going there yearly since 1998. I was there last June and Sept. and did well both times. I'm leaving for there again tomorrow morning. When I get back I'll be happy to help you out with any questions you have.
