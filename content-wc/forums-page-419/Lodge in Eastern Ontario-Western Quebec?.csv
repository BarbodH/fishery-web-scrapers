1457852,NickDalasio,2012-07-05 03:47:00,34,"Hi folks, I'm new to the forum.A few of us are trying to plan a trip next year to either Eastern Ontario or Western Quebec (want to keep the drive to a minimum from Pennsylvania). Some of us want to fish for walleye, some want pike, some want to fish for trout. Can anyone recommend a lodge where they've fished before that would offer all of these species in decent numbers? Thanks!"
1457854,mcsteve,2012-07-05 04:14:00,13,Check out the lodges on Lake Kipawa in Quebec. There you will find all of the species you list in abundance. There are many lodges that can accommodate you no matter what you are looking for. I have stayed at both 3 Seasons Camp and Alwaki Lodge. Both are excellent. There is a forum for those who visit the lake and many of the outfitters participate. www.kipawa.net Steve
1457877,NickDalasio,2012-07-05 06:24:00,34,"Thanks Steve.Actually, we went to Kipawa this year, had a great time, the lodge was excellent, and the food was great (American plan). We caught decent numbers of walleye every day, some were fairly large (24-29"").The ONLY gripe we had (if you could even call it that) is that a couple of the guys wanted to target lakers and pike, we did manage to catch a few, but were hoping for a little more diversity. We did go during an extremely hot week weather-wise, and it was our first time fishing this lake. We may just go back to Kipawa, but I wanted to see if there was anything else available."
1457975,mcsteve,2012-07-05 10:38:00,13,"I've been to quite a few lakes in NE Ontario and have not enjoyed them as much as Kipawa. I find that most of the lakes within a few hours drive of Sudbury and North Bay tend to get a lot of traffic. That being said, there are many outfitters that are accessible only by fly in that get great reviews. I guess it all depends on what you goal is for price and facilities. Lakers in Kipawa can be a bit elusive, depending on what section of the lake you are at. My first few trips to the lake were very frustrating in my search for lakers until another group shared some frozen herring with us and showed us how to rig them. I've had some great luck using herring sitting just off bottom at the deep drops since then and even troll them using a cut bait rig. Where did you stay when you were there?"
1457999,NickDalasio,2012-07-05 11:15:00,34,"We were at Kipawa Lodge, and again, I can't say enough about what a great lodge it was.The owners and other fishermen in camp went out of their way to show us locations, techniques, etc.We're not opposed to fly-in or cooking our own meals."
1458261,fishincrazy,2012-07-06 05:30:00,1282,Check out Garden Island Lodge.it's like 1 1/2 hours north of North Bay.It is a boat in lodge with no easy access to the waters you will fish.The species you mentioned are all swimming here.You would have to go either early in the season or late (early fall)but you can catch these plus some nice smallmouth.Check it out at www.garden-island.com FC
1458331,retire55,2012-07-06 07:55:00,1029,Here are a few more drive-to lodges (within 60 miles of Lake Kipawa) for consideration in western Quebec with the three species you seek:http://www.ogascanan.com/ on Lac Ogascananhttp://www.bushcountrycamp.com/bushc...p/Welcome.html on Lac Sasseginagahttp://www.duckswild.com/coucoushee/ on Lac Kikwissi The three lodges above instituted a 21 inch maximum length walleye harvest for 2012http://www.clubtroutlake.com/ on Trout Lake
1458749,NickDalasio,2012-07-07 09:55:00,34,Thanks for the input! Let me know if you have any other sugggestions.

I personally have not been there as it has been out of my price range so far but it is on my bucket list. Have a great year and please report back on your adventure.http://www.awashish.com/en/1/Home/Thank you,Larry Mac"
