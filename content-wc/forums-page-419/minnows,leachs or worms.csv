1459649,fire105,2012-07-09 16:47:00,40,eyeman i think i will go with you advise. leaches and crawlers but i think we might use some minnows at the shuts. thanks
1458602,fire105,2012-07-06 19:16:00,40,"heading up to taki next week. should i be picking up some leaches, minnows (what size?) or worms on the way up."
1458666,wallydave,2012-07-07 04:35:00,2151,"The only live bait you can take across the border is crawlers if they are in bedding. Salted minnows are ok, no leeches at all."
1458702,fire105,2012-07-07 07:57:00,40,i'm going to pick them up on the canadian side
1458708,J-Man,2012-07-07 08:02:00,191,"In my 20 years on Lake of the Woods, I've noticed the following trends:Minnow guys catch all kinds of fish on minnows,leech guys catch all kinds of fish on leeches, andcrawler guys catch all kinds of fish on crawlers. My personal choice would be minnow, leech, crawler, but...when it comes to the heat of summer and keeping bait alive....leeches would be my choice. Minnows don't like the warm water and expire so fast it's a losing game unless you can get them fresh each morning. Good luck up north."
1458743,gfish,2012-07-07 09:48:00,23,"We went up 2 weeks ago, and decided that next year we were going to go with leeches and crawlers, with only a few dozen minnows for the chutes or isolated humps. We did very well with crawlers this year, and they are just so much easier to keep fresh. Good luck!"
1458927,rjbuckeye,2012-07-07 21:33:00,9,"My vote for the walleye fisherman is minnows in spring, pre spawn, and leeches or worms after. definitly crawlers for the monster eyes!"
1458963,Pooch,2012-07-08 04:52:00,4619,"Just returned home from our first Canada trip of the year. We always take all three baits to camp.When pulling spinners behind bottom bouncers last week it was definitely a worm bite the first few days. Storm came through and it turned into a leech bite. I've seen this before, but have never figured out why. When jigging the minnows won hands down most of the time.That said I've seen it many times when a leech or crawler on a jig will get hit faster than a minnow. Could be that the minnow doesn't stand out in a crowd of other baitfish, but the leech or crawler does.If you have access to minnows in camp and can't take all three baits then I would be leaning towards leaving the worms home and buying leeches after crossing the border. We paid $38 a pound for them at Larry's in Kakabeka Falls. Worms can be hard to keep unless you have room in the fridge for them. Leeches need to be kept cold all the time to keep them from spawning then dieing. Nobody knows for sure what fish will be hitting today or tomorrow. So it's your preference.Have a good trip.Pooch"
1459256,eyeman_1,2012-07-08 17:53:00,690,"I just came back from LOTW and the bite was equally good on leeches and crawlers. We pulled both behind spinners and it didn't seem to matter on numbers, although the arguement could be made for bigger fish the leeches were better, and they caught more pike? We didn't mess with minnows as it was so warm and they are tough to keep. Leeches and crawlers take far less work to maintain."
