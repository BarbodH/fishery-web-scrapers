We've fished there for quite a few years now and have had success bottom bouncing fishing 22-30 foot of water. And also for suggestions for new techniques. We usually plan our trip around the last week in August and fish primarily for Walleye...and during the day Bass/Northern.The majority of our eyes come between 6:30-7:45am and just before dusk. We've tried staying out past dusk but if we fish with the same technique we usually just run into rock bass stealing our worms. Is it worth getting up before sunrise or staying out pask dusk? Just wondering if we need to move to deeper/shallower waters at different times of day? Or just fish for Bass/Northern during the other times of day? We fish out of 14' boat and usually backtroll as there is no front motor. And we backtroll wil light rods 5' - 6'..usually 5-5.5' because the majority of the eyes we catch are on the smaller side 16-21"" so rod sensitivity is key. Usually fishing live bait on spinners for floating jig heads...although we do occasionally try a rapala as well. Any recommendations on time of day and techniques would be greatly appreciated!thanks!"
