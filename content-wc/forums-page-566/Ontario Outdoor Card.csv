1120830,retire55,2009-07-14 08:36:00,1029,"IMHO, there are logical reasons for the non-resident requirement to purchase a 3 year Outdoors Card ($9) to fish in Ontario commencing 1 Jan 2009. The Outdoors Card provides a unique identifying number to everyone who fishes/hunts in Ontario, whether resident or non-resident. Privacy laws prevent Ontario from using driver licence numbers or social insurance numbers as unique identifiers. The Outdoors Card unique identifier affords access to Ontario electronic services (e.g. obtaining fishing licences on-line). And with an Ontario Outdoors Card, non-resident hunters will no longer be required to bring their hunting accreditation documentation with them each time. As well, lost licences can be easily replaced rather than having to purchase another licence (particularly expensive for a moose licence). Lastly, all fishing/hunting licence fees, fines, etc, collected by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, are deposited into a Special Purpose Fund that provides much needed dollars to support fish and wildlife management in Ontario. Perhaps with a better understanding of the benefits of the Ontario Outdoors Card, you will be better able to accept the requirement and its nominal charge."

In the future, if it was explained to me correctly, I walk in with my outdoor card and the issuer of the license prints it out....all handled electronically. Walk into Bobby's in Vermillion Bay any Saturday morning from opener to mid-June and watch the line waiting to get a fishing license. $3/year on top of the bargain price I pay for a nonresident annual fishing license. . . a no brainer. That's alot less than the cost of gas to get from the hard road back to the lake I'm going to fish for one day."
1120946,WalleyeWally28,2009-07-14 15:14:00,298,"Jay,I agree 100%. Your explanation is the same as I got at Bobby's a week ago last Fri. It will make it easier and faster. Well worth it."
1120993,joeman79,2009-07-14 18:31:00,417,"Take it from someone who has hand written THOUSANDS and THOUSANDS of licenses, this is a good thing for ALL involved and 9 bucks!!!! SO WHAT It will speed up the whole process and will be great trust me. Since Ks went to computerized licenses, besides a few little gliches it has been great. But ya aint never gonna please everyone."
1121035,Glenman12,2009-07-14 20:45:00,762,"It comes down to $3.00 a year...when you figure that most pay anywhere from $500 to $1,500 a year for a trip, $3.00 more is a spit in the bucket.."
1121097,Thumpr50,2009-07-15 06:54:00,139,Griping about 3 bucks a year for something that makes getting your license easier? And compared to what you pay for a trip to Ontario? C'MON!! The convenience makes it well worth it....
1121160,Golden Eagle,2009-07-15 12:07:00,2642,Didn't mean for the thread to go in this direction. I was just wondering if I should have received my permanent card.Cost of the card is no problem for me. I put my energy toward complaining about high taxes and eroding investments.
1119870,Golden Eagle,2009-07-10 05:08:00,2642,I bought my annual license and Outdoor Card May 15. Have not received my Outdoor Card. Has anyone else received their card?
1119885,Babamel2,2009-07-10 06:28:00,414,"I ordered my license and outdoor card by phone and they both came in the same envelope. Take what you received and look at it carefully. If you got two pieces of paper, check if one of them is the license and the other the temp (paper) Out Door Card."
1119895,Golden Eagle,2009-07-10 07:07:00,2642,"Thanks, I have the temp."
1119922,Glenman12,2009-07-10 08:23:00,762,It was my understanding that the permanent plastic outdoor cards would be mailed out in the fall..
1119958,Golden Eagle,2009-07-10 10:47:00,2642,Thanks for the response. I'll look for mine this fall.

1120746,Glenman12,2009-07-13 21:21:00,762,stay home
1120747,v-bay gord,2009-07-13 21:24:00,3168,"Nine bucks and good for three years.........a profit enhancing endeavor???....give us a break, or make a better argument to back your point."
1120761,joeman79,2009-07-13 21:47:00,417,CHEAP I'd pay more I think they are doing a great job managing the resource.
1120767,alanexpup,2009-07-13 22:23:00,278,"its like any other permit, it collects just enough money to employ another handful of relatives for the government. nepotism i think its called."
