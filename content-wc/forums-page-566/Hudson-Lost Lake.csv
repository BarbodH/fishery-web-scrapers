Just wondering with the weather being so cool if the fish have entered their summer patterns yet. Thinking that my usual last week of July fishing spots might not be as hot at they are normally. Any thoughts? How about the water levels, about normal?Tim"

My good friend and fellow guide Colin Gosse has been doing well shallow in Lost Lake lately. Personally, I have found several good deep bites, over 20' for a month now. The pattern seems to be that there isn't one. Try it all, be versatile, have fun!!"
