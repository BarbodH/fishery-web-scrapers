It's been a few years for me, but I'm guessing that the walleyes have moved out to the reefs in Red Gut; maybe hanging around Moose Island? As for baits, leeches or crawlers? Also looking to do a little casting for northerns and smallies. Thinking about heading up into Porters inlet maybe. Strange Bay off Red Gut has always been good for catching northerns, too. Any info would be appreciated. Thanks, Bill PS I promise to post a report when I return!"
