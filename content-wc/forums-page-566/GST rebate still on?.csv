1122230,GNO,2009-07-19 18:41:00,153,"It is available on packages, not just lodging or items purchased. A package such as cabin, boat, motor, guide or flight. Basically 3 things combined. Your outfitter can do this if they choose andrebate it directly back to you and save you the time & hassle of waiting for it."
