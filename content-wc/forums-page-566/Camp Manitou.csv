The also has big muskie, though I did not fish for them but I did see them and they were big. Also has awesome lake trout fishing, jig in 100 ft. of water this time of year. There is also a largemouth lake you can get into and it totally fun, small lake you can back troll around in a few hours. Live bait is allowed for smallies which makes for 50-60+ fish per day but artifical is alot of fun too."
1122068,Jay Merics,2009-07-18 22:49:00,21,"Thank""s Harvey,I would be targeting Musky and Pike. How long of a run is it to Camp Manitou from Esox Landing? I would be bringing my own boat ( 16.5 deepv- F60 yamaha).I know this is deep clear lake trout water but are there areas with weeds in Lower Manitou/Esox Lake? this would be an early September trip for me."
