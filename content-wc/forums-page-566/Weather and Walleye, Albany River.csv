1122259,Hayduke,2009-07-19 20:34:00,11,I am flying out on 8/1 from Nakina and was wondering what the weather and water levels have been like. All this cool weather I am thinking the Walleye fishing won't be typical for this time of year? Any info from someone who has been there recently would be greatly appreciated.
1122289,phishfearme,2009-07-20 04:38:00,1242,we just returned from the pickle lake area and crossed the albany between lake st joe and osnaburg lake and the river was rumpling. the cold weather and rain probably hasn't lowered the levels that much at all. we found the water temps about 15degF cooler than the same time last year and the walleye were still in the flow areas having yet to move into the lake. they were also considerably deeper that what is usual this time of year. the cool/cold summer continues. where along the river are you headed? we've fished the entire albany river from osnaburg to aba. phish

1122505,phishfearme,2009-07-20 19:19:00,1242,"looks like you'll be up a tributary of the albany from makokabatin lake - should be a great trip for you as this seems like a new outpost. please post a report. as for brookies - unless you can find a spring - either surface or underwater - you'll have a tough time with them. we spent 2, two week canoe trips on the albany with not one brookie - and we tried all the rapids but no luck. locals told us about the need to find really cold water. spring water up there is 41degF. feel it and you will know it's spring water. the outflow of most all of these lakes are surface water and this time of year is just to warm to hold brookies. best of luck. phish"
