Especially looking for suggestions that will make it easier for my never-even-seen-a-walleye family to be successful. I've done a bit of searching on the board here and it looks like fishing the edges of weed beds is a good bet in late July on Wabaskang. Will have a sonar/gps with me so should be able to dial in pretty well once I get my bearings. My last (and only) trip was to Perrault Lake about 3 years ago, couldn't get the hang of the ""jig and a minnow"" thing but am going to try it again this time around. Also plan to drift with a crawler harness quite a bit as that was most successful on my last trip.Can someone fill me in on the northern pike action on Wabaskang? I have an idea that catching lots of small pike should be pretty easy - don't really care about size of fish, but am counting on the pike to provide good action if the walleye fishing isn't as hot as I'd like. Am I correct in my assumptions?We'll be staying at Peffley's Camp and I'm confident Dave Peffley will help us find the fish if we have any trouble, but also hope that I'm able to find them on my own.Any suggestions would be appreciated! My kids fish with me a lot already so I don't anticipate having any trouble keeping them interested - provided we don't spend 2 or 3 days trying to find a few small fish... ;-)Thanks"

As for the jigs, you need to feel the bottom and I slowly retrive versus vertical. Try worms and minnows. But a lot of talk about lost lake so you might want to try that. I haven't personally fished wab but I do see a lot of boats out by mcloed bay around the island that seperates the two parts of the lake straight out from your camp. Just ask the camp owner and he should be able to put you on fish. We always arrive at camp early to talk to the people just leaving. Fish wind blown points and shores.Scott"

Fixed depth or slip bobers work well with Jigs. The fish bite best or are more active in 20ft or less of water. Play angles when at anchor you may need two anchors to set up just right. No loud noises banging the bottom of the boat this will turn the fish off. You will see boats with electric trolling motors on certain spots that hold fish but the hum seams to turn the fish off so I stay away from them the fish will move around in the areas & will come to you. The most active fish suspend. The fish on the bottom will bite but they are more or less neutral feeders. Weeds rock reefs & any flat 5ft-15ft area should hold fish with deep water 35-40 nearby. 10lb test should catch Walleye & Pike but the bite could pick up with 6lb for walleye. I have landed a 46"" Pike on 6lb but use 14lb for casting."
1121975,Larry Mac,2009-07-18 10:44:00,530,"Hi MartyT, I think it is great that you are taking your family to Canada. They will truly enjoy it. I am sure you will find the fish but being that you are taking the wife and kids for the first time I would recommend using a guide for the first day at least. The advantages of using a guide have been discussed on this forum numerous times. Wabaskang is a large lake 15000 acres so he will also help familarize yourself with this lake. He will put you on the fish right away and will prepare a great shore lunch for your family. I would also fish the jumbo perch they are great eating and fast action. Also if you find the perch you should also find the predators. We are leaving for our second trip to Canada this year a week from this Friday and we are taking 4 kids along(we always have our children with us) and they cannot wait. Have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
