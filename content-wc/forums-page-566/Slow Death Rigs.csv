1121628,adempsey,2009-07-16 23:53:00,963,"Used this a bit my first time a couple weeks ago. Worked well enough for me, but I wasn't using a bottom bouncer since I was drift fishing relatively shallow.Used both nightcrawlers and these: http://www.berkley-fishing.com/prod.php?k=74890&sk=74853&p=PURGFRY3-GP%20(1094616)I also had line twist, which I will fix with a barrel swivel next time I set it up."
1121778,IowaDave,2009-07-17 12:28:00,69,Here is a good article about using the technique also. http://www.outdoorlife.com/articles/.../09/slow-death?#
1120048,joeman79,2009-07-10 18:08:00,417,"Anybody ever use these? Read a lot of good stuff on them. Want to try some in August on Lac Seul. Just curious. Thanks, Joe"
1120087,Guest,2009-07-10 21:25:00,0,"Joeman79: These things are deadly!! I would buy the red hooks, use a four foot lead, and a bottom bouncer. This is all I used last week on Lac Seul, it seemed the bigger walleyes liked this approach. Use half a crawler, the tail end."
1120117,rebs,2009-07-11 04:36:00,7587,I have heard this befor where using the tail end or the head end makes a difference. Does anyone know why or have any kind of explaination for this?
1120138,eyecatcher01,2009-07-11 07:15:00,631,"i actually prefer to use the head portion, seems to stay threaded on the hook better for me. plus most of the time that first segment is just right distance for the hook to come thru (seems to be tougher skin) and than leave 3/8-1/2 inch tail.i like to dress them up sometimes with couple beads and have even put a blade ahead. the one must tho is a good barrel swivel, also heavier mono line like 12lb or 14lb to avoid line twist."
1120297,mata,2009-07-12 08:20:00,78,"tried this rig and we had trouble with twisting, used directions on the package. can not fish with a twisted rig"
1121272,Blackcloud,2009-07-15 19:55:00,2,I used the slow death on Pelican lake which is part of Lac seul and it worked phenomenal. I was catching so many walleyes that i got sick of putting the worm on so I tried a 4 inch YUM walleye grub. It worked amazing and i still caught fish after fish. The problem with twisting might be solved by using a good quality barrel swivel and bottom bouncer. I haven't had any problems with the twisting!! I've heard nothing but good things from friends that use this method.
1121417,Babamel2,2009-07-16 11:22:00,414,"could someone out their either give a good description of the Slow Death Rig, or provide a pictuure? Thanks in advance."
1121437,AllenW,2009-07-16 11:50:00,11482,"http://www.mustad.no/slowdeath/Try that.I've used them and found I ended up replacing the swivels with ball bearing ones from Sampo, I'm sure any good quality one with work, but these work best for me, and I use 8# test mono.imho trick is calmer days and keeping the speed down to get just enough action that it spins though the water.Calmer days just make it easier to keep a speed your using.They haven't been totally effective for me, but have worked on enough occasions I keep several on hand.They're cheap enough I'd give it a shot.Al"

1121485,Steve Ediger,2009-07-16 15:07:00,97,UKATSJust got mine yesterday from Cabelas. Took 3 days. Joeman got me all excited about this technique - never heard of it till last week.Steve
