1121173,Guest,2009-07-15 13:22:00,0,Canadian beer is the nector of the gods. The water is draw from glaciers and mountain streams never touched by foreign fisherman or hunters. The hops and barley are grown in mountain meadows tended by hand.
1121207,elmo,2009-07-15 15:31:00,43,Sounds like a good beer add!

1120722,cruiseforever,2009-07-13 20:34:00,177,"I would have to agree with some of what Canadian Guy has mentioned. I use to camp and fish in diffrent areas of Canada that were not serviced by lodges or outfitters. I saw groups of fisherman, mostly an older crowd that we called meat hunters. They would try to get the biggest fish to fill their limit. It was legal, but sad to think about. It is similar to when Bass and Walleye tournaments started. There was no CPR, just catch and keep. Just look at the pictures when BASS started. Also there were large amounts of garbage tossed in areas along with large amounts of human waste. Very disgusting. Now I use lodges, still enjoy great fishing and get a place to dry. To defend Americans as not having some fault for what has happen to some areas of Canada is just being blind to the history of the area."
1120765,joeman79,2009-07-13 22:01:00,417,"I don't think anyone was saying there was no fault on the americans part. But putting them all in same catergory is not fair or right. I am sure some of the trashing of lands and fish hogging was done by Canadians as well. The past is the past, we are learning as we go and I think both sides are doing a great job abiding by new rules and concepts. We have the same kind of arguements here between the Kansans and the Nebraskans. We think they are fish hogs but there are just as many kansans fish hogs. But in the last 26 years I have been in this industry I can say there are far more people that pratice C&R and other conservation practices now than ever. The conservation thing is working, not in all cases but a vast improvement. You are never going to be free over slob fisherman and hunters, thats just the way it is. And when the get busted I cheer the OPP or whatever you call it and say good job. Nothing to become resentful for, be positive and try to teach and show people the benefits of a clean and well managed resource. None of us are without fault or the ability to do a better job and rude comments and suggestions that we are pigs does not help anything. theres my rant Joe"
1120895,Guest,2009-07-14 12:38:00,0,I've lived in Canada (BC/Alberta)my whole life and yet to pay $41 for a case of beer. I think you found the most expensive store in Canada. WoW.... hard to believe. I think I would be bringing up your monkey piss too.
1120902,cast_and_blast,2009-07-14 12:50:00,1098,"Well, it's your country...just look-up www.thebeerstore.ca to confirm the prices. Can't make it up - they are all over Canada. But, that includes GST and PST too so it's quite a bargain... And the Molson I bought at the border is the non-import; it's Canadian. As far as what ""monkey piss"" tastes like...I defer - can't say as I would want to partake. Scott"
1120913,Guest,2009-07-14 13:23:00,0,I had a look at you link and the closest store to me is 3 provinces away. I dont doubt you paid what you did all I'm saying is you can buy it cheeper and not have the boarder hassle. Cheers!
1120916,Guest,2009-07-14 13:27:00,0,"I understand a ""case"" of Beer is 12 bottles in western Canada and 24 in areas east of Manitoba. Might explain the price shock. To cast and blast .......beer and liquor is under provincial ownership in Canada and the beer store is strictly only an Ontario thing. American monkey piss is not that bad...I enjoy Pabst when I visit the states."
1120920,Guest,2009-07-14 13:42:00,0,"Limiterr, Your correct I was referring to a 12 bottle case and I think there was some confusion. I should also note Alberta is not under provincial ownership. Comparing American beer vs Canadian its like comparing leaded fuel vs unleaded.. oh and we have some flavour added in also. Just kidden!"
1120926,cast_and_blast,2009-07-14 14:11:00,1098,"Yes, I was referring to a case as 24 x 12 ounce bottles/cans. Canadian beer is good stuff - I make a point of buying it when I'm there. Have a good one - Scott"
1121024,elmo,2009-07-14 19:51:00,43,"Canada has good beer and the U S has good beer, but Canada along with the U S has Horse piss beer. But to say nothing better than beer from Canada and the rest sucks?? Starts to sound like my nephew from Texas with his Texas crap. Everything in and from Texas is better. All I know is that can beer at the beer store is high even when I pay for a case (24 cans Alexander Keiths $44.00 Can. a case) with US money and $1.20 dep. The outfitter will not let you take glass to any of his camps and the cans are higher in price than glass, and do not blame him for that. So after 5 cases of beer at $1.20dep and the cans are smashed to fly out with I guess the outfitter just takes them to recycle or try to get the $6.00 dep back? Or do people just trash the cans and they go to the dump? Maybe someone can help me out? Keith's is darn good beer!"

When someone jumps on this forum and begins posting inflammatory statements like you are and they do so anonymously it makes it look like there is a 13 year old on the other side of the keyboard. As far as being the ""walleye mafia"" I would say you have the roles reversed. You are the one expounding upon the idea that US citizens ""stay home and leave your fish alone"". I come to Canada for vacation (northern MN too) and I do so legally. I pay my fees, buy my license and obey the rules of Canada. As I said before, I'll continue to do so until I choose not to or there are laws put in place that prevent me from doing so. Scott"
1120495,cast_and_blast,2009-07-13 08:47:00,1098,"Well, I like pork and beans. Case of Molson was $14 (US) at the store before I crossed the bridge in I-Falls. Payed about $8 (US) duty at the customs station on the Fort Frances side. Total = $22 (US). At the Beer Store in Fort Frances Molson was $41 (CAN) with only a 5% currency discount (even though it was 11% via VISA or DISCOVER). Total = $38.95 plus tax (CAN). So, it's about 1/2 the price and Ontario still gets their fees. Scott"

1120503,elmo,2009-07-13 09:12:00,43,"Funny thing happened at the gas station the other day ( 2 Years ago). 2 trucks from Ontario with gas cans filling them up at the gas station. The little Mazda truck with a topper crossed right in front of us at the crossing. My wife and I watched him fill up 6, 5gallon gas cans as we filled up. They just waived him through and he just slowed down and went on. I do not know what the other truck was doing with all the gas cans in the back? Thank god for those gas stations in I Falls and other crossing towns. Wonder what else he was haulin across? I bet the store owner could careless who bought the gas, it was a sale. And maybe a couple of cartons of smokes."
1120570,Guest,2009-07-13 13:17:00,0,The Canadian fishery was in trouble in the 80s and 90s from over use by you guessed it Americans. American fisherman outnumber canadians in most areas of NW Ontario. It was common in those years to have 30 or more Ws and Mn residents fishing on small lakes for weeks at a time. I have seen limits of 40in northern and 25in plus Walleye. There are still islands on the lakes where I fish with huge dumps of American garbage.Crown land camping rules were enacted fish limits lowered and the fishery had rebounded. We rarely see now the abuses of the past because of education and laws. In those years the yanks stayed in campers and tents for no fee and brought everything and asked the locals here how come everything was so pricy.......Sounds familiar. Hunting for big game laws were changed at around the same time for out of province people requiring them to use a guide and stay at a resort or business. Our resources were being stretched to the limit by our populous southern neighbour. There are many including myself who would see the same for the fishery.
1120589,cast_and_blast,2009-07-13 14:19:00,1098,"Really? Who is in charge in Canada? Were these Americans breaking the law?

Let's imagine it is true for a moment...why would the Canadian officials allow ""huge dumps of garbage""? I agree with one thing - fishing is different now with the practice of C&R that many fisherman employ - I think this is true in Canada as well as the US.Quote: Originally Posted by Canadian GuyIn those years the yanks stayed in campers and tents for no fee and brought everything and asked the locals here how come everything was so pricy.......Sounds familiar.

Our resources were being stretched to the limit by our populous southern neighbour. There are many including myself who would see the same for the fishery.I don't know who this ""many"" is that you speak of. We have the ""All Canada Show"", we have newsletters from resorts, we have resorts and outfitters posting on websites all expounding the Canadian experience and asking Americans to spend their hard earned dollars and venture North. I get to Canada and I'm welcomed by the bait shop as I purchase my license, by the restaurant owner as I purchase my meal, by the gas station attendant as I fuel my tow vehicle and boat, by the resort owner as I check in. I don't know of any of these people that would want Americans to ""stay home"". In 2006 Ontario's population was just shy of 13M pople. In 2006 Minnesota's population was just over 5M and Wisconsin's just over 5.2M. What percentage of MN and WI residents purchase a Ontario fishing license? 1% at the very, very most (100,000)? All at non-resident prices. Compare/contrast that to the number of Ontario (and othe Canadian province) residents that purchase an Ontario fishing license...Who is catching and keeping the fish? Who is impacting the fishery? Your argument is baseless and full of generalities and third-hand observations that you present as fact. Your sole point in posting here is to try to be inflammatory. I'll be back in Canada in October to fish in Ontario. I'll be buying my beer at the border and bringing my pork and beans to serve as a side dish to some wonderful, fresh-caught walleye. Can't wait.

We pay the crown land camping fees as perscribed by your goverment, that's part of the trip. We purchase grocieries, fuel and other supplies from sporting good stores and small local stores. Repairs, when needed, are done by local repair shops. Some years none is needed and other years alot.(Truck breaks done, power trim on boat and so on) But each time we are up there it seems we can spend $500 to $2000 depending on the trip and the price of gas that year. We stay at some camps that will take truck camper and some times in the bush. BUT, I will always bring my own boat and gear. I didn't work and save to buy and not play with my own toys.

1119436,Guest,2009-07-08 17:54:00,0,Not to upstage your story but when I was in my early 20s myself and three other buddies took 14 cases of beer across the boarder for a week long trip. Needless to say customs tore through every singe thing we had packed at 3:00 am in the morning. I think that might have been the last time I ever took beer into Canada. A lot easier to buy there and it's better.

Many times we stop at the store before you cross the bridge (I-Falls side) and buy our Molson or liquor to supplement what we brought from home. It's a crap shoot - has nothing to do with the booze or the amount. Most likely has more to do with the person answering the questions. If you look nervous, change your answers, have multiple people in the vehicle talking over each other to answer the agent, etc. you'll get searched. On the way home to the US from a smallmouth trip (all catch & release) we were asked if we had any fish - answered no. The agent looked at me, then my suburban, then my boat and said ""all this, and you didn't catch fish?"" I laughed and said that I didn't say we didn't catch them, we just released them all. She went through all the coolers in the back of the Suburban, welcomed us home and we were on our way. Duty on 3 cases of Molson bottles was about $27 US if I recall. Scott"

1117451,IowaDave,2009-06-30 08:31:00,69,"I'm looking for some opinions from you guys. About 10 years ago before I knew (or read) the rules about how much alcohol you're allowed to take into Canada a friend & I took 4 cases with us on a 2 week fishing trip. When they asked us at the border how much alcohol we had we told them. We weren't trying to hide anything and weren't being smart or rude with them in the least. They asked us again how much we had & we told them. They then told us to pull into the 'holding area', took is into the office, put us in seperate rooms and asked us about 20 questions such as how do we know the other person, what do they do for a living, what do we do for a living, etc. etc. They compared our answers, charged us a duty for the extra, which I don't remember exactly how much it was, but it seemed at the time that it was about as much as it originally cost us in the states, and sent us on our way, but not before going through our vehicle & boat. It wasn't a huge deal, but took over an hour & was a general pain in the rear. Anyway, since then I've never ever even thought about taking over the approved amount with us. If we need more we just buy it in canada. The subject of taking booze across the border came up on another website & several people recommend that you just take up as much as you want, declare it, pay the duty on the extra (which they claim is only about $9.00/ case of beer) and go on your way.....no big deal. They say this is much cheaper than paying for it in Canada, which would be true if their statements are correct. Like I said, I've never tried or even thought about it since the experience I had and if what happened to me happens 1 time in 20 it wouldn't be worth the hassle, so I was just wondering your guy's take on this. Also, if any of you do this, is the $9.00/case duty correct?What say you?"
1117461,ret-ro,2009-06-30 09:01:00,41,"You are allowed one liter of alcohol or 24-12oz cans of beer.We bring what we want, declare it and pay the duty. Sometimes we haven't been charged for the overage. Price sounds about right. They base the duty on the actual cost of the product, which you also need to declare."
1117478,Mohleye,2009-06-30 09:57:00,368,"There's no good answer to this. Guys take extra and declare it and have no problems. We take the allowed amount and buy the rest in Canada. We like it better anyway, and figure it's one less potential customs hassle. Last month I crossed at IF with my neighbor. Just the two of us, minimal gear in the open bed of my pickup. We had no alcohol and told them so, and were promptly searched. Ahead of us in line were people pulling boats with covers, etc, and they passed right through. Not complaining, they were courteous and professional and it didn't take long. I think they do things with no apparent rhyme or reason on purpose, which I guess makes sense."

It's a little cheaper than buying it up there. We saw them pull over and wondered what was going on. Thought they were in for the old ""random search"""
1117594,dp4562,2009-06-30 18:13:00,52,We (3 times a year) always bring all of our beer with us and declare at the border. It goes real smooth and costs about $10 per case depending on what you tell them you paid for the beer. This makes the beer cost $25-$30 per case vs $40 in Canada and saves a stop at the beer store in Canada.

They always tell us...........hope you remember your trip eh. LOL But, we sit in the cabin at night and drink and play poker so we go through quite a bit of beer per person. Fish during the day, drink beer and play cards at night. Ahhhhhh, can't wait."
1117668,Whopper,2009-07-01 04:44:00,340,ret-ro is correct on the amount I paid $9.00 duty for an extra case of beer in May
1119401,Bigiver,2009-07-08 15:40:00,94,"I understand that it is cheaper to pay the duty on beer you bring up than buying it up there. Is it also cheaper to pay the duty on a liter of say Crown Royal or Canadian Club? Is it any cheaper in the Duty Free? Thanks, Bigiver"
