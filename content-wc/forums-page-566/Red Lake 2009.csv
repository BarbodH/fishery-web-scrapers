1121939,stevensinks,2009-07-18 07:39:00,330,Gary this is my second trip to Bow narrows. I went with a group of 4 guys last year the first week of June. We had a good time and good fishing. This year my wife and I are going. We are letting them do our cooking so she can have a vacation. Like you Im hoping for good weather. If we have that I am sure we will have good fishing. We will see you up there.
1121137,rollo89,2009-07-15 09:59:00,2,Any reports from Red Lake so far this year? I am heading up this weekend (7/17) and just curious if the mayfly hatch has occurred yet or not. I know things are really far behind this year b/c of the weather.Thanks in advance!Ron

1121171,rollo89,2009-07-15 13:16:00,2,thanks for the quick reply. I will assume that I will have to compete with them this year.

1121257,Mike Kansas,2009-07-15 18:56:00,1463,You will be fine Joe. The Walleyes will be hungry and hooking up for you in two weeks. One time in Manitoba during the May Fly hatch we caught Walleye on Fly Rods and flys. Mike Kansas
1121258,Guest,2009-07-15 18:56:00,0,"We've been at Red Lake since July 4, there is little sign that there has been a major mayfly hatch, the surface water temp in Red Lake has been 59F-64 over the last 1 1/2 weeks. The fishing has been fair in Red Lake, good in Keg and excellent in Gullrock."
1121463,Guest,2009-07-16 13:42:00,0,"I live on Red, and the season started off very slow, high cold water and a cold spring, however about 2 weeks ago, things turned around and fishing is now excellent throughout the entire chain of lakes. (ya just gotta find em, their hungry, lol)"
1121872,stevensinks,2009-07-17 18:24:00,330,Red Im glad to hear that the fishing is picking up. We will be getting to town on the 24th to take in some of the Norseman Days then head to Bow Narrows on the 25th. I cant wait.

I hope sevensinks catches enough fish for us to eat too! We will be cooking our own food. We might try one or two indoor shore lunches.Our first time to this resort. Hoping for good fishing and good weather."
