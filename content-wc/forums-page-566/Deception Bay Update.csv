It would be much appreciated, including specific spots, depths, tackle, and bait. I leave on Monday and can't wait."
1121983,tcasica,2009-07-18 11:19:00,14,Hello All - I would also be interested in any reports for the same area. I'll be fishing similar areas on Lac Seul - Lost Lake and Deception area from the 25th - 31st. I'll also be fishing Big Vermillion and staying at Deerpath Lodge. Understand that you can find the eye's anywhere within 20 ft of water and that the water levels are a little low this year.
