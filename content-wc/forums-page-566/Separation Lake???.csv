1121784,jeb73,2009-07-17 12:49:00,3,Does anyone know who owns Fox Lake Camp on the English River? It is the red cabin on an island just east of Lount Lake and close to 9 Foot Bay for those familar with that section of river. I've never been able to find out who actually owns this camp or if it's even available for rent.Thanks

I have not been there before, but have fished the English River system in another area (Tetu).For you guys that have fished up there, what should we look for as far as structure and location for both Walleye and Pike that time of year. I don't expect anyone to give up their honey holes, I just need some basic info to help us get started in the right direction.Also what techniques work best that time of year?Thankshttp://www.myfishingpictures.com/sho...=13626&cat=500"
1086874,PRD1,2009-03-10 14:30:00,458,We fish Umfreville Lake which is the next lake up the English river beyond Separation Rapids. We fish Memorial day week which sometimes runs into the first few days of June. Both Walleye and Pike are shallow and the water on the cool side (sometimes like last year on the cold side!) so suspending crank baits like the Rapala Husky Jerk in the larger sizes and the X-10 and X-12 X Raps are very good. We also have tood luck with Shad Raps and Minnow Raps. We catch good number of Walleye on crank baits but also fish Jig/minnow as well. Again fish are typically shallow 12 feet or less and we get some real nice pike in the bays right next to shore. Hope this helps.

Bring lots of jigs and plastic tails...The water is stained so jigs that make some noise and kick out vibration are key. Northland Thumper Jigs work well tipped with a 3 or 4 inch Slurpies Grub. X-Raps work well too and are good because you will put a mixed bag of pike, walleye and some smallmouths in the boat."

1087365,PRD1,2009-03-12 07:21:00,458,Lount is the next one to the east of Separation and Umfreville is the next one to the west. It ends at the Caribou Falls Dam and below the dam is Tetu Lake. This site offers some nice topo maps of the area.http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/topo/map
1087388,thunderatwork,2009-03-12 08:51:00,79,"anyways, I've always had good fishing on the english river, first couple of times was thru bill""krash"" Krylock the last couple of times was thru grassy narrows- now called dreamcatcher lodge-again upstream. good numbers and good size. however at grassy one needed a guide. lount we didn't as the fishing was all fairly close to the shack that krylock called a cabin. good luck I'm sure you will do well on the english river."

1121432,Guest,2009-07-16 11:41:00,0,"Went to Seperation 1st time last September. Did ok averaging 4-5 fish per hour of all kinds. Mostly trolled 5-10 ft deep and jigged down to 20. It wasn't until the last day that the boat guy told us we were fishing too deep. He sent us into the weeds 5ft and less where we hit our best day of walleyes plus a dozen 12-13"" perch."
