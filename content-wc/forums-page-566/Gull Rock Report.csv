1121878,Fishin Fun,2009-07-17 18:45:00,218,"Mary does have Wi-fi, but it wasn't working very well the other day. I don't know if she got it straightened out or not yet. The weather was cold, rainy, and windy the past 3 days so we left a day early. The fishing on Sunday was awesome. I mean awesome! We had 6 guys in 2 boats and on Monday caught over 100 walleyes. I even caught a 27"" that weighted 6.2lbs. We caught so many fish. Too many to count and too many big ones to keep. Loads of fun."
1121899,Moondog,2009-07-17 21:06:00,362,When the weather is bad with cloud coverage the satellite connection is very poor. Mary has contemplated a new antenna but (massive $$$$) even that does not ensure good Mbs. We had great luck with it the entire time we were there. Have the May Flies hatched there and how bad did it affect the fishing and for how long?
1121902,tackleman,2009-07-17 21:26:00,444,"the may flies are just appearing, the weather has been miserable and cold, the furnace was kicking in on the house the last 2 days.I haven't been out since monday but when i did fish there was no problem in getting eaters and big ones (20""+). I found them in 20 to 25 feet on most points, along the boot and around the flats by the clay banks.the may fly hatch will more than likely be happening for thenext couple weeks but the water is still only 59 degrees and this may slow things down as far as the hatch goes."
1121912,Moondog,2009-07-17 22:30:00,362,"Thanks for responding, once again...... So on a ""normal"" year.........when does the mayfly hatch usually happen and for how long?"
1121987,walleyeduran,2009-07-18 11:32:00,286,"A normal year is a very interesting question. If you ask Al Gore, he is going to tell you that the may fly hatch will be happening earlier ever year do to ""GLOBEL WARMING"". If you ask 80% of the other scientist throughout the world, they will tell you we are actually cooliing down the last 20 or so years. After this last spring/summer I am leaning towards the ice age theory. Duran"
