1120768,alanexpup,2009-07-13 22:25:00,278,I dont know where those areas are but in the sactuary about 5 miles east of ear falls there is about a 15 rapids depending on how deep the water is.

Besides the Scaler lake falls , west of Kakabeeka Narrows ,there remains only the falls at the west end of Wapesi bay north of Chamberlain Narrows. There are some high current areas ("" rapids"") north ( Manitou rapids) and SW ( Crooked ""rapids"") of Deception light . best regards, JBP"
