1122047,fishman10,2009-07-18 20:18:00,226,the tornado took the cabin one half mile into the lake and the missing fisherman was found several days later 4 miles away.
1122060,Moondog,2009-07-18 21:47:00,362,We just left Gull Rock before this happened and the 3 gentleman that died were in a cabin that was tossed into the lake just off shore. 2 men found immediately next to the shore and another a few days later. The other cabin had 5 people in it and that cabin was also dumped in the lake (not a 1/2 mile off shore either) but the floor came out and dumped the guys on the ground a few feet from the lake. Watch the sky and know that there will be no warnings!!!

Apparently the video that was seen on the news was taken by Kathy and Blair at Onaway. Love that area, wish I could go every year, really sad to hear what happened at Fisherman's cove...glad to hear there weren't even more fatalities, which there easily could have been."
