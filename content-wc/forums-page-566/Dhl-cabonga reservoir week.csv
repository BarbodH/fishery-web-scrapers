1122040,RUDE TROOPER,2009-07-18 19:14:00,65,Hello there my fellow fisherman and woman. Just got home from DHL after a week of fishing. It's 9pm now and it was a long drive home. Getting things cleaned up and put away. Tomorrow morning after I have had a cup of coffee I shall sit down and post a couple of pics and give a detailed account. Glad to be home but I already miss those sunsets up north. Mike

Tremblant and Mt. Laurier but other than that no problems. The roads were fine and no construction or delays. We arrived at the lodge around 1:00 pm and me and my daughter were fishing by 3! The first two days were decent weather wise. Our first nite in camp, Frank, who is one of the workers pulled in a 9 pounder! Great fish! That was the biggest I saw caught all week. Sunday morning the wife and kids were sleeping in and I was on the water by 5:30. The fish were biting as well. The first morning out I caught 3 nice fish early. I was slow trolling a harness rig. The first one was a 3.8 pounder. That turned out to be my biggest fish of the week. I caught and released some lesser fish. We headed out as a family after breakfast and caught a few more fish down around Burns Bay. Several hours later that same day the cold front moved in. The next 3 days had everything shut down. Guys that had been going here for 20 plus years were having difficulty getting on fish. Temps were running in the upper 40's to low 50's. One rain storm I got caught in even had sleet bouncing in with it. The winds continued to blow steady out of the north and simply made things miserable all around. Around Wednesday the winds began to shift more from the south. The fish started to come out of suspension and begin feeding. The standard fare was working. Trolling harness rigs and jigging known areas. This year I did a lot more exploring of the reservoir with the GPS and Navionics built into my new sonar. Phenominal tool to have on such a vast expanse of water. Everyone I talked too had the same results though. You would catch 1 or 2 fish on a spot and that was it. The schools of fish were not coming shallow to feed. You would get those couple of fish and things shut down. That was the way it went for the next couple of days. Friday and Saturday some of the groups were getting on schooled fish and things were getting better. I hooked into about a 10-12 pound northern Friday morning. It was bright and sunny and we were working a couple of southern island points. I hooked up and knew it was a good fish. When I pulled him up next to the boat he let go of the harness and lingered for a couple of seconds. This guy was in the upper 30's. Great fish but I didn't get to land him. All in all this was my third year at DHL. I caught over 30 fish for the week. This was my best year by far but far from what this reservoir is capable of producing. One thing is for sure. The weather made it difficult to find feeding fish and kept them at bay for a good chunk of the week. Our reservations are made for next year. I was able to meet one of our members here who came in on Friday. I gave Curt all the information I could in hopes that he and his son and grandson can get on some good fish. I look forward to seeing what he has to post later this week. The weather is certainly improving and hopefully so does their fishing. I'll get the photos on later today after I have a chance to get to them. Mike"

1122296,Guest,2009-07-20 05:51:00,0,"Thanks for posting a report Trooper. I know those cold fronts that sweep through the north country can really put a lid on the bite. It's interesting how the camp workers can come up with some great fish on occasion. Luke, who had been in Frank's position years before also came up with some amazing catches. My theory is there's a honey hole not far from camp, location tightly guarded, that at times is unusually productive. I remember reading an ancient post from a number of years back when the lake had been drawn down considerably, the guy mentioned a particular spot that saved the week for him. Mentioned it but never gave the location. Not that the Cabonga dosen't have great fishing in many places most of the time, but I've always wondered about that spot. Our group has some special places also, as I'm sure most groups do. It's a big beautiful lake, it has been very good to us for the last four years and hopefully for many to come. Good fishing!........Ron"
