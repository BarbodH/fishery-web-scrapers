3098905,Pooch,2014-08-17 20:20:00,4619,"We have bought minnows there for years, but never leeches. With the construction on 61 north of Duluth we are probably going to alter our route and will miss our usual bait shops west of Thunder Bay. Came home route 61 two weeks ago and it was bad. Don't want to pull the boat back through there unless I have to.Has anyone bought leeches from JD Baits (south of Sioux Lookout) this year? How about minnows? What are they charging this year for both or either?I need to call them in the next couple days. Anyone have their phone number and hours?Thanks!Pooch"
3098945,Warrior56215,2014-08-17 20:33:00,46,"The number is 807-737-2980. Deb is usually there 7 am to 6 pm. I have never bought leeches from her, only Minnows and crawlers. Small minnows wee $3.50 doz. this past July. Wish I was going back. Good luck."
3102801,scar,2014-08-19 06:15:00,196,"JD's has a decent supply of leaches and crawlers as well as minnows. I bought minnows two weeks ago and we bought the regular not small for $5/dz. Well worth it as they are great size for jigging eyes - bigger then your little finger. run hook through their mouth, out the gill then push minnow way up the shank and run hook out the side of the minnow just below the spine. You can now use the same minnow for two to three fish and it does not come off or get mauled too bad.Thanks for this tip Lac Seul Guide Colin Gosse!"
3117201,Skiball,2014-08-23 13:36:00,82,Having been using Joe and Deb for some years and very happy with quality of the minnows and her knowledge of the whole area. Just need a good crawler spot on our 20th trip to Lac Seul on the 5th of sept. Any good crawler supplies out there or even off of rte 53 in Mn if .....I have bedding? Thanks and good fishing to all

3117601,Pooch,2014-08-23 17:48:00,4619,"They are ALL good trips. Some are just ""gooder"" than others!I think we have three bags of ten dozen each ordered from J&D's for next Thursday.Last trip of the season then harvest and maybe a chance to get in a few test and tune passes in a new race car before winter shuts the race season off in Central Illinois.Pooch"
