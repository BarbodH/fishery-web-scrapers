2923169,Hawkfan,2014-06-22 08:03:00,237,"Red Pine Lodge and outposts now has the Slate Falls cabins on Gull and on Zionz. If you go to fishredpine.com you can get a map that includes some of Zionz. You still won't get into any of Fawcett though. Sparks narrows was always a good producer and yes, there is supposed to be trout in that lake. One guy in our group thought he hooked into one on one of the number of trips we made there, but he was in a boat by himself that day and lost it before he got it to the boat. That was the only time trout was ever even mentioned. But like Sin said, we always went in late August or September. It's a great lake system though. Had many good times on Gull. Enjoy your trip!"
2937873,jgar1865,2014-06-25 22:51:00,14,"Thanks for all your responses! That glorious day when I fly-in to the Canadian Wilderness to Fawcett L. is fast approaching! Yeah, Kona, I agree, I usually don't fly in minnows either. too much weight, too hard to care for, and too hard to deal with. How many times have you taken off full speed only to realize the minnow bucket is still in the water? Yikes! I like that map redpine has available, Sinorswim. Shows depths. I wonder how they got that? Everyone else ive talked to says depth maps for this part of Canada don't exist...just wish it covered Fawcett L as well! BTW, I marked on my map 2 islands I think your talking about (has to be one) and will let you know if they are still there! Good to know that there is a small Laker pop in this chain of lakes, Hawkfan. Can't be many, the lakes are pretty shallow, but I see Sparks Narrows reaches up to 40' and there might be a couple other deep holes in the 30's. Not a huge Laker guy obviously, but my poor Dad has fished all his life and never caught one, this will give him a couple hours of hope! Thanks again for the input, would welcome any others... jim"
3025457,Hawkfan,2014-07-23 21:39:00,237,Any report jgar?
3025569,SinOrSwim,2014-07-23 22:59:00,1528,probably too late for this trip but the best thing we ever did for minnows was get one of those mesh minnow buckets. Put all our minnows in there and sink it to the bottom of the lake at the end of the dock. Water is colder and more oxygenated. None of them evere died. One or two maybe but not half. Each morning put coupld scoops in each bucket and we were off. Sink the rest to the bottom and also no worries about those getting too hot or eaten by minks
3031681,jgar1865,2014-07-26 01:03:00,14,"Had one of our best fly-in trips ever to Fawcett Lake! Will go down in the memory banks for sure. Kay Air service was incredible. We were scheduled to fly out at 6 am, arrived at 5:30 and by 5:50 we were taking off for Fawcett. Same thing on the pick-up...scheduled for 6 am, the plane landed at 5:30. Loved it. No ""hurry up and wait bullcrap with Kay Air. Dudes were efficient. Fishing at Fawcett was awesome. Mom broke Family Record with a 28"" Pig Walleye, I and brother landed 26's, Dad a couple 25's. The 4 of us caught a dozen 23-24 ""Two Footers"". More 19-22's than we kept track of. No joke, there were times we struggled to catch ""eaters"" for dinner. Caught vast majority of Walleyes in the heavy current between the 2 arms of the Devils Rapids. Discovered the spot by drifting, kept motoring back up the current to go threw it again but spent so little time in the ""strike zone"" and got so many snags by jigging leadheads that we devised a new strategy. Made a HUGE anchor from a rock (boulder) that allowed even the 2nd boat to even tie up to the 1st. Then casted slip bobbers set roughly 1-2 above the bottom upstream, watched them flow right next to our boat, and then downstream until either it went under or couldn't see the bobber anymore. No joke, 70% of the time you would see that bobber go frickin DOWN! Fish on. Reeled in line while it was coming back to us, and then opened the bail once it went by the boat. Reel in a bit before setting the hook, Hard! This method at that spot was successful for us morning, noon, and night. We'd toyed around in the past with slip bobbers before (reefs, off the dock, while shore lunching...) but never had we deployed it with such success as we did here. It was incredible. Such a natural presentation, like the fish are expecting, drifting down at current speed with a fat worm/leech or minnow hooked to it. This spot produced 75% of all fish caught and was within 5 mins of cabin. So that left all the other spots. Despite all I'd heard about Sparks Narrows, we went their 2x and didn't catch anything appreciable. The Northern 1/2 of Fawcett is basically 10' and under and nowhere to fish in mid July. It is deeper above Zionz Creek and we did find good fishing there. Caught some above and below Devil's Rapids but honestly not near as much as we might have expected. Got some at the Humps in the main lake, ""nowheresville island"", and off the North Island in our Channel. Mom caught her 28"" Walleye at Zionz Narrows. Long ways from camp but there was significant current there and that meant bigger Walleyes. Cabin was very super comfortable. Had 2 gas ranges/stoves, 2 refrigerators/freezers (electric so they actually made ice!!!) and a generator system that gave us electricity whenever we wanted. Weather was cool, but it kept the bugs down and meant we could put the fans in the windows. Good sleeping weather. Really liked this place. Had other great adventures fishing here, too. Learned a lot about Canadian Fishing to make me a better fisherman. Jim"
3032057,Hawkfan,2014-07-26 07:48:00,237,Thanks for the report!
3034977,kona77,2014-07-27 12:46:00,236,"Jgar- Thanks for the trip report.. Looks like you had a great time. We also started using slip bobbers more the last two years.. Still prefer to drift with jigs or bottom bouncer's, but there is still something fun about watching a bobber go under.. Already booked on another lake with Wayne/Karla for 2015 but Fawcett looks like another good lake to possibly explore in the future.."
3116057,jgar1865,2014-08-22 22:07:00,14,"You're welcome for the fish report. Cant say enough about how great Kay Air was and how comfortable the cabin was at Fawcett. We have already booked another trip with Northern Lights for 2015. Am now a firm believer in current for big Walleyes. It seems that over and over again if you can find current, you can find walleyes. Bigger ones too. I too prefer to drift jigs or spinners over spots (my days of backtrolling into the waves and splash are over!) but on this particular spot, the snags were so numerous and the ""hot zone"" so short, that slip bobbers were the only solution. We are already gearing up for 2015!"
1220024,MorganMan,2010-07-17 09:52:00,341,"Wondering if anyone has fished these lakes recently and what report you may have on your trip? We fly in to Gull and fish it mostly, but have easy access to all 3."
1220028,SinOrSwim,2010-07-17 10:08:00,1528,One of those had a crap load of ANTS on one of the islands. LOLOLOL!!!
1220057,GNO,2010-07-17 12:27:00,153,"If you go to L&M Fly Ins website, they have a fishing report page and report what each group is doing for fishing. Their cabin is on Fawcett and the guests also fish Zionz and Gull."
1220058,SSA,2010-07-17 12:28:00,19,"You ever take the day trip around Thistle Island hitting all 3 lakes in 1 day, thats a neat and fun trip. L & M's cabin on Fawcett posts fishing reports including Fawcett's for each week, be worth checking out there web site for the reports. If you need the web site I can provide it, not sure if I am allowed to post a web address on these posts??You stay at Gull north or south?"
1220068,MorganMan,2010-07-17 14:02:00,341,"Thanks, I checked out the website and fishing reports. They seem vague as far as details about which lake and if they ventured off Fawcett to fish or not. Hopefully, someone can shed some light on Gull Lake in the recent past this season? We have our go to spots on the lake, but am always interested in anything we might miss. And yes, we have encountered a substantial number of ants on a particular island on Zionz! I don't remember it being as funny as SinOrSwim!"
1220077,Hawkfan,2010-07-17 14:45:00,237,Thats because you were the one that found them. The rest of us found it extremely funny.
1220206,MorganMan,2010-07-18 06:56:00,341,"Sorry, SSA. Didn't see that last question. We have stayed at both, but we are staying in the North cabin this year again. We alternate every few years it seems."
2920529,jgar1865,2014-06-20 22:57:00,14,"Hey Guys, We got a trip scheduled July 14-19 at Fawcett L. We were originally booked with L&M Outfitters but they just sold their outposts to Northern Lights. Doesn't seem like a big deal, same cabin and lake, just now we will be flying with Kay Air out of Ear Falls instead of Dryden. Folks at Northern Lights seem really nice, promise us free live bait for our troubles. This forum helped me a lot a couple years ago when we flew to Wapikaimaski and I gave a post trip report as well. Thanks Pikeslayer8 and Castnblast! So, anyone been to this Fawcett, Gull, Zionz lake chain recently? Looks awesome, lots of water and current to fish. Devils Rapids is just a skip downstream on the Cat River from our cabin. That's got to be a good spot? Once again I got a cool topo map from CanadaMapSales but it doesn't have depths. From Slate Falls Outposts, I was able to get a depth map of Gull Lake where their cabin(s) are but it cuts off Fawcett and Zionz. Anyone know how to get a depth map here? Or familiar enough to point out any underwater reefs/humps? Deepest part of the lake appears to be Sparks Narrows (40'). Pickerel Arm Camp has a cabin here and they say that ""even an occasional Lake Trout is caught at Fawcett in the springtime."" Can anyone else confirm that their is a small Laker population on this chain? Might be fun to chase for an hr or two... Anyone fished below Devils Rapids? Or NE of the Falls on Zionz Creek? Any advice on where underwater humps are? Is it worth going ""around the world"" of Thistle Island? Any advice/experience would be appreciated. I promise to give a post fishing report just like I did last time on this forum. Thanks guys, jim"
2920769,kona77,2014-06-21 06:50:00,236,"Jim;I have not fished Fawcett, but I can tell you the Clarks run a good business and provide great service. This was the second year we have fished on one of their lakes and we had great fishing and service on both occasions.We have never bothered with minnows before on any of our past 15+ fly-in's, but the last two years with late ice out the minnows have been a real bonus when the eye's have not been hitting plastics. The Clarks will also stop by during the week and re-supply the minnows and check on any other issues.. One of our motors was not running the greatest this year and they dropped off a new motor mid-week.. That is the kind of service I appreciate in an outfitter!!! There is a recent post on Fawcett on the Clarks website.. Not a lot of detail but I assume Karla could give you contact information of the groups that have fished Fawcett this year and you could get direct information from them.. Good Luck on your trip.."
2920833,SinOrSwim,2014-06-21 07:17:00,1528,"jgar, MorganMan can probably help you a little more than me as far as Gull goes. It has been 4 years or so since we have fished it and we always went in September. I could try to pull my GPS out and look for some spots but I have the map up on the website. We never really fished Zionz but did venture in there a time or two. It's a pretty long haul from North Gull to Zionz wiht a 15hp motor. If you look at the map where the SFO cabin is by the Birch River. It has a star there. If you go south of that star you see islands. I think it's the one that sort of sticks out toward that area of 20 feet depth on the map. I'm not sure the best way to describe it looking at the map. That island has been a go to spot for many years. The west side and most of the north side is really shallow but the NE corner all the way around to the south side of that little island always has fish. Guaranteed dinner and certain times during the day that island has given us a lot of 22 to 26 inch fish with the random 27 and 28 thrown in. The other place we fished alot was down in the area of Sparks Narrows. That is where I caught a 30 about 10 or 12 years ago. I don't remember specifics but we have fished the areas between the North Gull cabin over to Zionz and I don't remember any areas being all that great.That stinks you have to drive all the way to Ear Falls instead of Dryden to fly out? I miss going to Gull."
