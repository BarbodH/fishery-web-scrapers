I've already gone to various sights and none seem to be very clear on what channels we can use for boat to boat traffic. Maybe it's because I don't understand the terms used.This link is very specific for U.S. waters, but the chart above for Canada is not very clear at all.http://boating.ncf.ca/vhfchannels.htmlThanks,Pooch"
