2939281,forgop,2014-06-26 11:30:00,880,Not exactly an option for those of us who do fly - ins.
2950265,MuskyMaster,2014-06-29 22:42:00,79,"**** COBRA!!!!!! I bought a pair of 16 mile range figuring if they work 1/4 we would be good. NOPE!!! 1 mile max on a straight line over water, conditions didn't matter. 1.5 miles it was all static..... sucked"
2950297,forgop,2014-06-29 23:37:00,880,"I ended up getting a Motorola set. If they work for a couple of miles, great. If not, it'll give the kids something to play with otherwise."
3119209,forgop,2014-08-24 14:48:00,880,"Thought I'd give a report on how the radios worked out. For our small area, they worked fine. The bigger surprise was the radios provided communication even between the short distance from one portage lake to the main lake."
3119945,Skyraptor,2014-08-25 03:46:00,291,Yup VHF marine radios are what my group used for years while fishing Reindeer Lake in northern SK. Had a Humminbird brand marine. Well worth the money but have not used them in a few years since we do not go to Reindeer anymore. Going on eBay since our group split up due to family doings and kids.
2930193,SinOrSwim,2014-06-24 07:33:00,1528,"Yes, we have been on smaller lakes and larger. Even on the larger lakes, many times we arent' that far apart but we still can't get them to work very well. I hope you have better luck than we have.Half the time a radio ends up making a bunch of random noises and squawks etc so it gets turned off. Which, doesn't do anybody any good. But, you can't sit there and listen to that all day.I would love to hear from people who have used any of these radios successfully."
2932225,Aspencreek,2014-06-24 15:43:00,2911,"You may not have, or will hear, from anybody about having good luck with 2 way radios because NOBODY has had good luck with them. Although a great idea to be able to keep everyone in your group informed, the years of trying to find a radio that is better than ""Yelling across the water"" has escaped our group. We must have tried at least 6 different pairs from at least 4 different makers all with NO good results. My brother purchased a pair that he was convinced would solve all the difficulties of the past. At no small cost I might add. After just a couple days, he decided to explore a new area on Lac Suel only to hit a rock and lost his prop. He called and called for help. I was only about a mile away but on the other side of a couple small islands. When he didn't show up at the meeting spot we found him, not at all happy. Those very expensive radios are now part of the structure on the bottom of the lake, and he took great joy in donating them."
2932329,nicko,2014-06-24 16:15:00,508,"Have a look at standard horizon, Icom or Uniden. Amazon is a good search site. I have the standard horizon with built in gps. You certainly don't need that for what you want. Uniden has some nice lower cost models that get good reviews and are pretty low cost.http://www.amazon.com/Icom-01-Floati...words=Icom+VHFhttp://www.amazon.com/Uniden-Handhel...productDetails"
2933137,kliph,2014-06-24 20:08:00,2337,As far as UHF and VHF here is some info: http://ezinearticles.com/?UHF-Versus...er?&id=1328253
2933697,Daddybigfins,2014-06-25 03:15:00,484,"VHF is the way to go----on the 5 watt setting the range is more than adequate for most situations. Being able to receive noaa weather stations for forecasts and storm alerts is worth the $100. The coast guard monitors channel 16 24hrs a day, cheapest insurance policy you can buy. Did a solo sea kayak trip thru southeast AK and my VHF was strapped to my chest the entire trip. Many VHF units have three way scan; channels 16, 9 and a third the owner can program. You can't compare cheap 2 way radios with VHF units=apples to oranges."
2934313,northernbite,2014-06-25 07:34:00,1186,I guess I'm wondering why nobody mentions or use Marine grade radios? Three of use go up in July and we have the marine radios in all 3 boats. it's rare when you can't at least hear somebody calling. Just a thought. We did learn you do need to turn them on. LOL Paul
2934833,MrSimon,2014-06-25 09:18:00,922,"Ain't that the truth! If you are only a mile two apart, and there is nothing between you .... anything will work. Even cheapos from Wal-Mart. But as soon as you go around a point or get a few big islands between you .... forget about it."
2937905,jgar1865,2014-06-26 00:25:00,14,"having 2-way communication between 2 boats has always been a dream of ours. It's never happened. It just amazes me how ineffecutual theses 2 way raidios, walkie-talkies are. we've tried 3 different types over the course of many years and have never been successful. they end up being a joke within the 1st day. sad, but true."
2939041,SinOrSwim,2014-06-26 10:30:00,1528,Not as simple if you don't take your own boat though?
2939137,cuamb,2014-06-26 10:49:00,203,Several in our group purchased VHF marine radios and mounted the 8 ft antennas on our boats. Gives us pretty good distance (as long as you have the antenna up). The 8 ft antenna gives us a little higher elevation and reduces the influence of the curvature of the earth.
2925193,forgop,2014-06-23 00:21:00,880,"I know they can be limited by weather and line of site, so the ranges can be greatly over exaggerated. That said, we're going to be going on some smaller lakes but it'd still be nice to communicate if we're at different ends of the lake of maybe 5 miles between us. We had a set we used last year until they got rained on really bad and after that they were worthless. Therefore, I'd like something resistant to weather and then be rechargeable. Any particular brands/models you have specific knowledge of? Here are the sets I'm looking at on amazon thus far. http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004NYB68E/...Y5D3CCD9&psc=1http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001WMFYH4/...IZA2YJTY&psc=1http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UE6MIO/...NES97PXR&psc=1http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-MT350.../ref=pd_cp_e_1"
2925209,adempsey,2014-06-23 00:53:00,963,"I've only used a couple models by Cobra. My brother owns the CXR725 and I bought the CXT545. They worked alright. Suffer from the same limitations as all two-ways. The one thing I didn't like is the CXT545 only comes with a USB cable for charging. Luckily I had an old cell phone charger that I could use.I only bought this brand because that's what I could find in the store and it was a last minute thing. Although, Cobra makes a floating model that looks decent.Otherwise, I'd probably go with something made by Motorola.REI has an informative post on two-way radios."
2925473,patricktjms,2014-06-23 05:59:00,67,Give a look to the Standard Horizon HX 851. Built-in GPS in a 5 watt handheld. Pretty decent unit.Sent from my SCH-I535 using Tapatalk
2926137,SinOrSwim,2014-06-23 08:46:00,1528,"We have tried all sorts of different hand held radios and most don't work very well. I will say though, batteries are better than rechargeable. You can take extra batteries with you in the boat.Having said that is there a better alternative? VHF???Also, when it says 16 miles I think it means 16 miles on perfectly flat land with nothing in between them and perfect weather conditions."
2926281,adempsey,2014-06-23 09:12:00,963,"Well, according to that REI article the maximum distance between two 6' tall people on a lake is 7 miles simply due to the curvature of the earth. To get a longer distance you need to be at a higher elevation.So, no matter what you get that will be your maximum distance on a lake, unless you stand on an island or something. Higher wattage units will not make much difference with distance, however they may provide a cleaner signal."
2926337,patricktjms,2014-06-23 09:17:00,67,VHF simplex radio communications are limited to line of sight. You can talk to the space station on .5 watts but you might not be able to do anything over the top of a 3 mile wide mountain. you can figure the radio waves will travel horizon to horizon +15% under good conditions. 5 watts for a handheld will easily get you accross a lake.
2927577,forgop,2014-06-23 14:43:00,880,"I understand that. Virtually any of the lakes we'd be going on that are 5 miles from the farthest point, so something good enough to cover just 2-3 miles would be all we'd really need."
2928505,nicko,2014-06-23 18:08:00,508,I've never had much luck with the small GMRS radios. They are very limiting. A couple of miles maybe but that's with perfect line of site. Why take the chance when your 4-5 miles away with trees and islands. The vhf's are decent for that. You can find them cheap. Better to be safe than sorry. On the off chance you need help you could call for it if your near a camp or towns. We carry a fixed mount VHF and 2 handhelds. Have a look at them. N
2930073,Simple Man,2014-06-24 07:15:00,92,What would be your recommendation for handlheld VHF? Our group typically has 2-3 boats and it is nice to be able to communicate when we are on seperate parts of the lake. We had pretty decent EF Johnson's last year (UHF) and they did not work well for us. I have not looked in to renting VHFs but that may be an option as well. Thanks.
2930169,Skywagon,2014-06-24 07:27:00,1106,"UHF does not have great distance capabilities without a repeater. Since the FCC forced everyone to make the mandatory frequency change on UHF, I would bet used UHF radio's can probably be had for a song on Ebay."
