This was our first trip at this lake and this lodge but it certainly will not be our last. We have fished in June, at various NW Ontario lakes many times over the years but never in August. We weren't able to get much pre-trip information about the lodge but I liked that the fishing report on their FB page did not seem overblown. This trip was a last minute decision so we just went with our instincts. Dave, the co-owner, made arrangements for us to be picked up at International Falls airport by a local van service. The van service tracked our flight via internet and was waiting for us, pulling right up to the plane and transferring our gear upon arrival. A couple hours later we were in our comfortable cabin on Hay Island after a brief boat ride from Morson in a huge & comfortable covered Lund. Meals are served in a window filled dining room at the edge of the island and the view is perfect. The meals are prepared by Chef Sherry, the co-owner, and her very talented staff. Everything, from menu selection, presentation, table setting & service was absolutely first class. Sherry made things cozy by introducing everyone and breaking the ice for conversation with other guest. There were only Five (5) tables so it really had a family atmosphere. I need to use a CPAP machine at night and the generator is off from 11 PM to 6 AM. The staff had me covered with a battery setup and inverter already in place near my comfortable bed. Cabins are roomy and modern with ceiling fans and good screens. One of the reasons we selected this lodge was the quality of the boats; 18' Lunds with 50 or 60 hp motors (not sure) and foot controlled front trolling motors. Nice for us bass-boat trained guys. We scheduled a guide for our first day but quickly changed that to a guide every day after realizing how great these guides are. They are regular staff and really know the lake. Fishing was excellent, with jigs and minnows in the mornings. Many walleye, including a 10+ pound PB and a lot of big perch. We also caught a surprising number of large rusty crawdads that would latch onto the minnow. Best luck was in 18' to 21' FOW. The action was moderately fast and we moved whenever it slowed. We alternated between shore lunch and sack lunch. Both were excellent with huge sandwiches on homemade fresh bread and delicious cookies. The boat was comfortable and roomy enough for all our stuff. Most afternoons were spent casting for bass. We had several 5 lb beauties and a lot of fun. The bass came in clusters with some pike and one 4 foot muskie mixed in. I caught the muskie on a homemade 3.5 inch soft plastic swimbait and 10 lb mono. What a blast that was. it was about a 10 minute battle with the fish in and out of the net 3 times before it finally rolled and cut my line. My compliments to a smooth Shimano Chronarch drag system. We did a fly out to Karsten Lake on our last day and caught pike in the 28"" to 34"" range all day on bass type spinners and chatterbaits. It was a great way to finish up. There were guests in camp who had come every year for decades and it is clear why they return. Every detail has been considered and made as comfortable and convenient as possible for the customer's benefit. Dave & Sherry could teach a class in Business School. We will return."

I know we did not go to Obabikon or Whitefish. A lot of other boats seemed drawn to the same general area we were usually fishing and there were multiple shore lunch locations nearby.
