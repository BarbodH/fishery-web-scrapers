Enough weight to cast but it would slowly sink. We are headed to Lac Seul in a couple weeks. Any of you ever just troll the shore and cast something simple like this? I would assume this could be effective for most anything. Walleye, Smallie and even Northern?"

The movement was accomplished by rowing, an unheard of method in today's high tech world. Lots of fun and a great quiet way to enjoy. Bill"
