3104393,oleJoe,2014-08-19 12:46:00,114,A bottle of peroxide will take care of all nicks and cuts. Just pour it over them and they won't get infected. I always take a pr of slippers and nylon running pants to sleep in. Just nice to get out of heavy boots and a lot of clothes after a long day. We also take a syphon hose to fill the gas tanks. A lot easier and no mess. A sponge and towel for the boat. Hate standing in water. But enjoying the trip is at the top of the list. Have a good one.
3116633,forgop,2014-08-23 08:37:00,880,"I think this may go without saying, but a real backpack, especially if portage to another lake is desired. Something like a large army surplus Alice pack would be great. The trip always resulted in wet feet, so.we went in sandals and on colder days would want to put on dry shoes/socks after we were on the other lake. I used a bag my sleeping bag set came with (non-padded straps and no compartments) always resulted in digging through a big mess of stuff. Alice pack is big enough to carry enough gear for 2 with compartments to separate rain gear, snacks, bug repellent, suscreen, etc. That will be something that is used on all future trips for me in addition to what is mentioned above."
3117433,SinOrSwim,2014-08-23 16:16:00,1528,"A good dry bag whether you are flying or driving. But, especially on a fly in. Those boats are small and you will ALWAYS be wet. Drive in waves you get the spray, backtroll you get the spray or just plain rain. Bottom of boat is always wet. A good dry bag to keep stuff dry is essential.Also, look around camp or under the camp and find some old boards. A couple feet long. Like a 2x6 or bigger. Put that in the bottom of the boat back by the driver. It will give you something to put your feet on to keep them out of the water that WILL find its way into your boat."
3117929,forgop,2014-08-23 20:04:00,880,"Speaking of boards, the portage I made at my camp required you to get wet feet and such. If I go back next year, I'll make sure to construct a better platform to walk between the rocks and downed trees. Not a big deal on warm days, but when temps are in the 50's, I'd prefer to keep my feet dry."
3099569,bigwalleye1,2014-08-18 07:52:00,2632,Super glue to add to the first aid kit. Small bottle of peroxide as well. Works in a pinch. Good electrical tape a headlamp
3099793,Ferrispata,2014-08-18 08:57:00,63,Good snap lights. Break one of those each night before bed and place in the main area so you can find your way to the john in the middle of the night. Don't forget your sunscreen and a good lip balm. Out on the water all day can do murder on your lips/skin.
3099993,JayM5209,2014-08-18 09:43:00,1050,"Plus a bottle of Corn Husker's Lotion! Use liberally on the hands each evening for relief from the cuts, scratches, gill plate punctures, etc."
3100009,Knoxabilly,2014-08-18 09:46:00,225,Corn Huskers is gone through faster then minnows when we're in Canada!
3100017,grapestomper,2014-08-18 09:46:00,41,How about baby wipes.
3100049,Carnhzkr,2014-08-18 09:54:00,964,"One thing I brought that worked out real well on my last fly-in trip were those individual Kool-Aids and Crystal Lites. We drank the water at camp and the Kool-Aid covered any fishy taste. Saved lots of weight not bringing in water or pop (still had to find room for my case of Molson, though)."
3101129,lassh,2014-08-18 15:57:00,553,Dehydrated hash browns that come in a pint sized milk carton like container (Costco). Versatile and very good. Quality cutters (such as Knipex). Don't bring wire dykes. You may need something that can cut big hooks. Fleece to be worn under rain gear instead of heavy jackets. Don't bring more than 40 jigs (especially if you are using superfine) Bring a small hook sharpener. Whistle Always bring rain gear.
3101305,Slushfish,2014-08-18 17:18:00,263,"Headlamps, black tape, Mio water additive, for when the beer isn't flowing."
3101449,MorganMan,2014-08-18 17:48:00,341,"It's been mentioned several time already, but can't be stressed enough for anyone thinking of going on a fly in, but hasn't. And that is good rain gear. Even on nice days when there is little chance of weather change, you have to have your rain gear with you. With the smaller boats, often 14 footers, you will get soaked with even small chop or rollers crossing any size body of water. There have been times when even goggles would have been nice to have to shed the spray!! LOL, good times. Wet times. Spend some money on good stuff, it's even lighter than the cheap stuff in many cases and won't leak. Cards for evening poker.....with your headlamps on if your solar panel didn't charge the battery bank. And don't run out of beer."
3101625,Carnhzkr,2014-08-18 18:34:00,964,"X2 on the dehydrated hash browns from Costco. Been taking them the past three years. They're light, easy to make and taste great."
3097393,feathersandfins,2014-08-17 11:56:00,10,My wife and I are packing for our fly-in trip next week. What last minute advice can you give us as to; ->Things you wish you had brought but did not ->Things you were glad you brought.
3097545,Hawkfan,2014-08-17 12:43:00,237,My brother has a small portable bilge. Much easier than a bail bucket when it has rained all night.
3097633,phishfearme,2014-08-17 13:03:00,1242,you simply can't pay too much for a set of raingear phish
3097681,SinOrSwim,2014-08-17 13:19:00,1528,"Small portable bilge is awesome if you have multiple boats. About the size of a coffee can, runs on 2 D batteries. Makes quick work. Plus we backtroll a lot so would always get water in the boat.Also a small camping fan. Works great if it's hot and also helps dry things more quickly if it gets wet. Boots etc. Sit them by the wood stove with a fan blowing in them."
3098137,Guest,2014-08-17 16:13:00,0,Just got back from one. Don't forget a portable depth finder. A Thermacell keeps the bugs way. Have fun.
3098601,NY Walleye,2014-08-17 18:57:00,78,"I second the thermacell. Also, duct tape- fixes everything. Needed it for an anchor rope issue and it worked great."
3098889,Mike Borger,2014-08-17 20:18:00,1554,Bringing your wife? Pack a couple of sheets to cover the mattresses with along with your sleeping bag and pillow.
3099321,brochet,2014-08-18 06:18:00,88,I thing the question on a fly in should be what not to bring.
3099345,SinOrSwim,2014-08-18 06:20:00,1528,"Yes, I did this regardless of whether a wife was along or not. It's gross to wake up with your head on a bare mattress where you don't know how many others have drooled or mice have been. Also, flip flops to wear to and from the bathroom at night or in the am along with a headlamp. Nice to use the red lights on that vs the bright white light if you are trying to get in and out without waking everyone up."
3099465,Juls,2014-08-18 07:08:00,13414,Bring a small first aid kit. Those pike will tear your hands up!
