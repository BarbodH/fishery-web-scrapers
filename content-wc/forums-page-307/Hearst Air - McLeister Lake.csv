I would assume the contour lines are in metres (even though the scale is in miles and the area is in acres). So, just multiply the numbers by 3 to get a reasonable idea of the depth in feet."
3125865,jds63,2014-08-26 13:38:00,3,"Thanks for the map, i know the lake is not big, but that helps.I did em the fella that did that video last year about his trip, we were supposed to go in 2013 but got cancelled and rebooked for September 2014. Outfitter wants $100 for a generator, i dont think we need one, so just trying to figure out if i really need to bring a fish finder for such a small lake, especially if we can fish the river system.Appreciate your help. Thanks !"
