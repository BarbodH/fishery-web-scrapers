Personally, I've been going to NW Ontario since a young age and have fished many different drive in and fly in lakes. What separates all our ""greatest spots"" from all others seems to be the availability of fast current. Keep in mind we always go to Canada anytime between July 6-20 so the time of year may be a factor. Early on we were mesmerized by finding ""secret underwater humps"" and have generally done well there. We also loved main lake points that extended deep into the main lake. We did well there too, but nothing, nothing compared to finding some kind of narrows or falls where the current was swift. Sometimes this was above or below falls, sometimes this was in a ""narrows"" but the key ingredient has always been swift current. I'm actually amazed sometimes how swift the current is and cant believe that walleye are able to hang there but they are. Sometimes good spots are eddies, breaks, changes in current, in front of small islands, sometimes the best spot is right in the middle of the fastest water! We typically drift these areas with jigs or spinners but lately have become adept at anchoring in this fast water (yeah, get a big rock for an anchor) and casting slip bobbers upstream, reeling in the slack, opening the bail as it goes past your boat, and watching it until you cant see it anymore. We absolutely killed it last year at Fawcett L with this technique. So now we are obsessed with lakes that offer lots of current. Needs to be on some sort of river system. Do you guys feel the same way? Anyone as current obsessed as I am? To me it seems to separate the big walleyes from the small ones. Tougher to fish, but ****, well worth it. Thoughts?"

3116737,Bill Krejca,2014-08-23 09:09:00,6107,"Current seems to be an attractant for minnows, probably due to the moving water kicking up bits and pieces of items upon which the small fish feed. The food chain then continues with fish coming in to feed on the minnows. This also generally holds true for wind blown lake shores. It seems that lakes with current coming in and going out also provide some degree of ""restocking"" capability for the body of water, the current perhaps allowing/causing the fish to relocate more than if merely in a smaller closed lake. My personal larger fish, however, have usually been taken in calmer water; very few have been taken in the current, even though fish are able to remain behind bottom rocks, apparently not having to exhaust an undue amount of energy to stay in that position.

3117305,515,2014-08-23 14:57:00,254,Inflowing current spots on the lakes we hit are always the go to spot when we want guarenteed action. I tend to believe that the younger more energetic fish hang out there constantly and we can always find our dinner fish there. But when chasing down the big ones it seems to be the deeper cooler water is preferred by them. That being said darkness will draw them into the current if you don't mind being on the water then.
3117417,greenie,2014-08-23 16:04:00,87,I'm current obsessed too!!!!!! Rocks and current are the first thing to look for. Neckdowns of rivers coming of a lake is usually best. Walleyes hide behind rock structure and ambush their prey. High water find neckdowns in 6-12 ft. In low water they are in pools and easier the catch. Northerns will be their too. Big ones at that! We have drifted current using 1/16 oz. jigs with half crawler. The walleyes would just smack that jig going over the rocks or boulders on 4-6 ft. The English River system is something that can't be beat!!
3117769,phishfearme,2014-08-23 19:00:00,1242,"current for us has always resulted in good numbers but only rarely size. by size I mean 24inchers or more. for size it's mainly been main lake structure - especially at the edge of a feeding shelf (a large weeded or structured flat where lots of minnow and other fish breed, feed and grow) that drops into deep water. these are our spots where trophies are mainly caught. it could also be a rock pile or an underwater esker. these structures are mainly features of shield lakes and not common at all in the james bay lowlands lakes of the region north of the shield. so, we try to choose lakes with lots of flow (for numbers) and lots of structure for the big girls. phish"
