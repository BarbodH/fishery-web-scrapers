We stayed at the Continental Motel, very nice, awaiting the train trip on August 1st to Lodge 88 on Esnagi Lake.The next morning we boarded the train (a Budd Car) and after several stops along the way arrived at our drop stop and was picked up by Nick (one of the dock hands at the Lodge) and taken by ATV to the Lodge.The accommodations were first class, the food was outstanding and plentiful. The boats and dock were in good shape which is great for old guys with bad backs and knees.The fishing was very good with plenty of walleye and northern pike available. We found fish in 10 ft. or less, in or near the weeds and in the deeper water. We used jigs and bottom bouncers in the deeper water and crankbaits mostly thin fins in the shallower water. The water temp. was mostly in the high 60s and low 70s according to how much sun we had.One thing was apparent, the fish were eating very good as the were very fat and gave a much better fight than most fish of the same length. I don't know how many time I would have bet I had a northern on that had to weigh 10 pds. and it would be a 5 pd. fish.Esnagi is a long lake (27 miles) but narrow so a fisherman can get out every day.While we were there Bob Izumi and his crew came in to make a show. What a great group of people, very friendly and fun to have around. Bob was gracious and and the opposite of what you might expect from a person of celebrity status.Terry the manager of Lodge 88 and his staff made for us a great week of fishing, with 5 star accommodations, food and assistance they gave to fishermen that needed a little more help than most. The cook and our waitress were beyond any expectations we could have had. And much different from some reports, no bugs, we never felt the need to break out any repellent.The train trip to and from Lodge 88 was very good and different from our normal fly-ins, all in all a new and interesting way to go fishing."
