An added treat to the trip was the spotting of several Woodland Caribou!All of the weed beds held pike ;the walleyes were holding on the outside edges and any where you foud rocks or some current . We had several days of stong wind out of the north west that stacked the walleyes against the shore in 2/3'of water it made for some different and wild fishing .The deepest water we found was out in front of the cabin it was 32'deep and was about a half mile long 200 yds. wide . It was dredged with small dipsey divers and bottom bouncer's .We marked fish but caught nothing deeper than 15 feet. this piece of water was a challenge ,but we put a program together in a day and a half of fishing that produced well the rest of the week. It was a week well spent."
