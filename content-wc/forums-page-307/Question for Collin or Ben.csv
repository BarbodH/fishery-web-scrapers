3113217,Jabs,2014-08-21 19:41:00,24,Going up the First part of September. Would they still be Deeper than 25 feet? Still mostly on minnows? When do they start going after big rubber or rapalas? Big lake on reefs? Or Could they be gorging on smelt or ciscos in deep current? What water temp do lake trout start their fall spawn? Thanks in advance

Rapalas and rubber are working when trolled through current areas at night, but as the water temp drops this bite will be daytime as well. Walleye are still currently in summer mode with water temps sitting around 70F. For the main lake in mid September look for 30 ft and deeper yet. The only way to beat very deep walleye fishing in fall is to target those current areas. Water temps are the same deep and in current. Walleyes are already starting to gorge on Ciscos of good size!"
