3112465,SinOrSwim,2014-08-21 14:55:00,1528,LOl someone has justified a trip to two with their wife!!!!!
3115673,pike50plus,2014-08-22 19:39:00,584,"Mike, leave them a couple?"
3107281,MrSimon,2014-08-20 08:59:00,922,We arrive in Hearst around dinner time on the 28th and fly the morning of the 29th. I imagine you'll be on the road before we get there so we'll miss you by a matter of hours. Enjoy your trip!!
3107545,forgop,2014-08-20 10:03:00,880,My trip this year through Parks came in at around $1150/person after gas. What is the rebate I've seen mentioned?
3107649,wallydave,2014-08-20 10:23:00,2151,https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ght=hst+rebateHere is the link for a recent discussion on the rebate. From my experiance if your outfitter gives you a itemized receipt the chances of getting your rebate are greater.Good luck!
3108065,adempsey,2014-08-20 12:15:00,963,"A lot of variables to consider, but I'll attempt an estimate.For a group of four, I'd estimate about $1150 at the low end, $1600 average and up to $2850 per person, depending on what camp you fly in to. A group of 4 staying for 7 days ranges from $800 to $2500 per person. On average, the rate is about $1250 per person. This includes tax. The rates can be lower with a larger group and at certain times of the year as well.Group Costs for four:Gas: 1400 miles with MPG at 18, gas price at $3.45/g - $275Hotel: 2 rooms - $250Food: $200Booze: $150That's about $220 per person. Obviously these numbers can be all over the place depending on how much you drink or if you take two vehicles etc..Per Person Costs:Outpost: $800 to $2500, $1250 being average for 7 days for 4 peopleLicence: $62 for 8 days, including card for Sports Licence [Conservation is $40]Restaurants on the road: $75 (couple dinners and lunch). Also, keep in mind, by ""low end"" I don't mean of lower quality. Just lower cost for the outpost, often due to closer distance to the air base or fewer amenities (e.g., no solar lights or electricity).I think the lowest price you could attain is if you drive all night to the air base, no restaurant stops, eat only fish, don't drink booze, conservation licence and use a fuel efficient vehicle. In that hypothetical situation the cost would be about $900 per person. Even lower if you fly in and set up camp instead of staying at a cabin. Personally, I'd pay the extra few hundred dollars in lieu of suffering without beer and a good nights rest."
3108073,forgop,2014-08-20 12:19:00,880,"Not really. By the time the outfitter flies in an extra trip to provide a boat and such, you're really no better off price wise."
3108105,adempsey,2014-08-20 12:30:00,963,I should have been more specific. I was referring to Northwest Flying fly-in camps. They fly you into specific lakes where there are already boats waiting for you. Posted rates are $445+tax per person for 7 days for a group of 3 or more.
3108161,forgop,2014-08-20 12:47:00,880,"Ok- Just wondered as I've asked outfitters for this option and the coast hasn't been enough of a difference to give up running water in the cabin, fridge, stove, shower, etc. Pricing this option is generally less than $100 cheaper and not worth the money saved."
3108601,pwbmlr,2014-08-20 14:35:00,37,"I went with Parks this past year. The paid invoice that Martin and Jenn give you will work for the HST rebate. Just fill in the form and send it with the invoice to address on HST form. You will received a refund for 1/2 the tax you paid in about 6 weeks. For a group of 4 guys we got just over $200 back Canadian, netted about $180 USD."
3108609,forgop,2014-08-20 14:36:00,880,Good to hear. I'll get this done this week. Wish I knew about this for my trip last year.
3108769,SinOrSwim,2014-08-20 15:05:00,1528,"The place we used to go is $1350 per man for 5 nights plus tax. But, much of this depends on the type of camp you go to. Some might be cheaper if the fishing isn't as great or if they don't have the extras like running water, indoor toilets, frigs and freezers. Those were things we always looked for. We don't necessarily like to ""rough it"". In addition, we didn't skimp on things like live bait and ice. So, 1350 plus tax is say 1500 or close to it. Add on about 100 or so for ice and bait that is 1600. We threw in about 300 into the kitty for gas, food and duty/border fees so now at 1900. Add on gas to get to and from where our group meets, the overnight stay prior to leaving, food and drinks on way up and back along with beer for the trip. Then, add on fishing gear. I'm easily at 2500. I'm purposely buy things from Cabelas etc over a period of time so my wife doesn't see one big chunk. LOL I'm upping my estimate to 2500 to 3000 per person for our trip. Which is a big reason we don't do that anymore. Tough to justify a 3000 dollar vacation when it's not even the family vacation and it's just one person. Seems like every year I'm buying something I probably don't need. Fish finder, new rain gear, new rod/reel along with tackle."
3101801,fishron,2014-08-18 19:12:00,317,"What would be the average money for a fly-in trip, considering travel costs, (700 miles), food, licenses, accomodations en route or on the return, and the large tax incurred for trips into Canada. Thanks for any feedback."
3102641,lassh,2014-08-19 05:31:00,553,There is some variation but it should be around $1500 to $1800.
3102905,MrSimon,2014-08-19 06:43:00,922,"We are doing a fly-in with Hearst Air next week. Five guys. 2,000 miles total driving. The all-in cost per person will be in the $1,600 range. That does NOT count the hundreds of dollars spent on fishing tackle and gear."
3102993,pwbmlr,2014-08-19 07:10:00,37,"We did a trip for a week with 4 guys and it cost $1100.00 USD a guy. That included everything except passport, fishing liscense, and fishing gear. Key to keeping the cost down is to put one person in charge of buying all the supplies. I run our trip and prepare the menu and make sure we have everything needed to eat well. This also helps with keeping the weight limit down. We are allowed 100 per person. What we do is allow each person 50lb for their fishing and personal gear. The other 50lbs per person is put towards the food, beer and cooking gear weight.This year we were only 40lbs group over in weight for the entire group. This was only because we decided to bring an extra 2 cases of beer. Bottom line, just make a list with your group. Set a budget for meals/supplies. If you stick to the list and stay close to the budget you will be fine. Just remember if you need to spend a little extra do it! This is a vac and it is meant to be fun!BTW- it actually cost us around $1060USD because when I got home I sent the HST rebate form in. Every guy got about $40 back."
3103265,fishron,2014-08-19 07:50:00,317,Thanks for the replies. Four of us did our first true fly-in this year where we were allowed a 110 weight limit. We were over by 120 lbs. We also give the guy who drives a pass on gas costs. This year that was me. On average our statistician came up with $1700 per man. I think we can do better if we put our heads to it.
3104153,MrSimon,2014-08-19 11:51:00,922,There is only so much you can do in terms of cutting costs on groceries and gear .... outfitter and travel costs make up the bulk of what you pay.
3104401,octanehi5,2014-08-19 12:48:00,1104,"Thats not a bad cost when you consider, that the base cost to fly in is about $1100 to the lake I fly into, Taxes,fuel, food, place to stay the night before breakfast, lunch ,dinner on the road. I do not eat like a bird on these trips its top notch meals. $1500 to 1700 is a good ball park figure for a 7 day trip per person"
3104409,Mike Borger,2014-08-19 12:50:00,1554,When are guys flying in? I'm flying with Hearst Air the 21-28.
3106953,Ferrispata,2014-08-20 07:32:00,63,~$1500 per person for us.
3107105,SinOrSwim,2014-08-20 08:09:00,1528,"We always told new guys to plan on about 2 grand. That is if you already have a base of fishing gear. You will always buy more regardless. I actually think it's a little more than that. More like 2K to 2500. Once you factor in the outfitter cost, bait, ice,food, beer lodging the night before, food on way up and back, gas etc. Agree, have one guy be in charge of all the food. Decide on a menu, make a shopping list and have one person get all the stuff. Then, we always put a couple hundred in a kitty and pulled money to pay back for the food and also that is how we paid for gas etc on the way up and back. That way it is fair. If there is money left over at the end we split it up. We also take money out of the kitty to give to the person we borrow a trailer from. Our outfitter never charged for being overweight. He just sent more stuff in on other flights. Some of them will work with you on that stuff and some won't. We haven't flown in for a couple years now. Our groups kept getting smaller and smller. Cost being a very large factor. Driving in is substantially less expensive. But, I loved doing the fly ins."
