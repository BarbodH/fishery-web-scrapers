Ice fishing will be early this yr. Here in Ct. we have only hit 90, 4 times this summer. Like it or not the past few winters have been getting colder, late ice outs, next yr will be the same. Good luck to all of you fall fisherman.My group is 10 months out until next yrs trip to Lac Hebert with Air Tamarac. We have enjoyed the bite in late june these past yrs.with the late ice outs,putting things 3 weeks later than normal"
