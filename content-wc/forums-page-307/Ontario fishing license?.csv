3112761,phishfearme,2014-08-21 16:16:00,1242,it good for the calendar year
3112801,SinOrSwim,2014-08-21 16:37:00,1528,"yes, calendar year. Dec 31st. I looked into the same thing"
3116249,Guest,2014-08-23 05:27:00,0,"the one year license ends Dec 31 of that year however the card is good for three years so do not toss the card out, even if expired. The card has all your information on it and speeds up the purchase of your next years license.So don't toss the card out."
3117401,Skiball,2014-08-23 16:01:00,82,"Absolutely keep the card. I purchased my license online today for my 8 day and becasue all the info is on the card, it took 3-5 mins and it was printed."
3117761,jimirjr,2014-08-23 18:57:00,1149,"Yep... I just had to 're new' the OUTDOORS card.... going In Sept. and then again next July, thought I could save and purchase a license in Sept and have it last through next Sept. In Colorado, Licenses run March-March... OR till the end of March..."

I said, ""Hey, I want one like that."" Maybe net year since my outdoor card expires this year too. Anyway, I like it all in one convenient package. Nice. BIL will have to order License next year same old way. License expires but Outdoor card good for 2 more years."
