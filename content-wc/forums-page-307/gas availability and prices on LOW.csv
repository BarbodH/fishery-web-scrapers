3117409,lassh,2014-08-23 16:01:00,553,"Thanks for info everyone. I've not been up to Clearwater Bay before. Of course I'll be traveling from South by water. Is the Clearwater Bay marina in Deception Bay? Also I believe there are additional fishing rules in that area. Could someone highlight the rules? Is it no natural bait, barbless, one hook? Are the rules the same in White Partridge Bay? How's the fishing up there at tis time of year? Thanks again."
3119289,zeebee,2014-08-24 15:43:00,1144,"Just got back from a week fishing Ptarmigan, Ash Rapids and Cul de Sac/Omega. Cul de Sac is barbless. Lots of good size walleye in the 15' to 20' depth. Slow death, deep huskys, deep tail dancers and crawler harness all produced very well. Largest was 28.5"" with dozens in the 22"" to 27"" range. In fact, we had to really focus on the last day to get slots (think Ptarmigan). Caught more incidental lakers than slots. Dont hesitate to go shallow...been a weird year in that respect.Premium grade is $2/litre at Ash Rapids camp. Expensive except when you need it.Good fishin........"
3119417,lassh,2014-08-24 17:41:00,553,"Thanks Zeebee. It sounds like you had a really great trip. Thanks for the shallow water tip. I will give it more time than I might have otherwise at this time of year. Yeah, if you're running low with a long way to go, 2 bucks a liter will have to work. I'm envious of your proximity to LOW. Its a long drive for me but way worth it. Less than a week I'll be bone tired from a day on the water and sipping a Macallan, and strategizing for the next day. Cheers!"
3103289,lassh,2014-08-19 07:55:00,553,"I'm going to need to refuel at some point during my trip to LOW. I can coordinate a fishing foray with a trip to a marina for fuel. I will be in Ptarmigan Bay area. Where is gas available? Kenora- Devils Gap Marina? Deception Bay? Clearwater Bay? Ash Rapids? Can I assume the gas will be good quality or will they be emptying their tanks at end of season? I have never been to any of these places, I just saw symbols for marina on the map. About how much is the gas? Thanks for any help."
3103385,Obabikon,2014-08-19 08:08:00,2370,"I'm not sure about Kenora, but I would guess it'd be in the range of $1.70/liter at a marina."
3103473,bigtimeelectric,2014-08-19 08:34:00,174,I filled up my 2025 pro v at the marina in Morson last summer and it was $285.00 usouch haha
3103817,Dog,2014-08-19 10:13:00,210,When we were in the Kenora area in June I filled up at Bare Point Marina and that's just east of town. The price at that time was $1.54 per litre and never had any problems with it. I believe that Bare Point is run by Devils Gap Marina. Fred
3104513,cbprov,2014-08-19 13:33:00,1010,devils gap has cheapest fuel. premium fuel is avaialble too
3105433,Manitou,2014-08-19 17:26:00,125,There is also the Wharf right downtown.Best looking chicks IIRC.
3105521,lassh,2014-08-19 18:17:00,553,And they get even better looking after a week in isolation.
3113673,freespoolin,2014-08-22 05:33:00,472,"Clearwater Bay Shell is closest to Ptarmigan (requires pulling your boat out), there is a marina at Clearwater Bay {Pye's Landing) with gas on the dock."
3114289,Manitou,2014-08-22 09:06:00,125,I avoid buying gas in Kenora if at all possible.It's about 20-30 cents or more per liter.http://www.winnipeggasprices.com/I'm in Winnipeg so I carry 5 or 6 jerry cans every time I head out.
3116889,NP4ME,2014-08-23 09:59:00,378,If that's not the truth!
