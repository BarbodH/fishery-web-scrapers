3124953,deadhead1,2014-08-26 08:26:00,193,I'm on NE end of LOW but due to ****ty weather I haven't been out for a few days. Prior to weather walleye were very good with lots of crappie and perch as well. Water level is still higher than normal but way down from highest point. I can see my dock again! O will be out lots on the long weekend so hopefully they will still be biting.
3125009,lassh,2014-08-26 08:36:00,553,How deep are the crappie and perch at this time of year?
3125025,deadhead1,2014-08-26 08:38:00,193,I have been getting them along with walleye in 24 to 30 ft. This is the first time I have ever gotten crappie in my part of the lake.
3125121,lassh,2014-08-26 09:21:00,553,I've never caught crappie on that part of lake either. Interesting. I'm coming in on Thursday in the late afternoon. It looks like right now theres a storm predicted. I hope it doesn't keep us off the water. We're staying in Ptarmigan Bay.
3125193,zeebee,2014-08-26 09:35:00,1144,"Spent a week in the Ptarmigan Bay area. Fish are shallower than usual for this time of year. We found them in 10-20'. Slow death on a BB was well.....deadly as were tail dancers and deep huskys. Our best catches were yielded outta Cul de Sac. Theres a lone cottage in that bay. A few hundred yards directly off the dock is a reef...try it. Troll the narrow between the cottage island and the mainland, we took 50+ fish there with nothin under 22"".The narrows leading into Cul de Sac reportedly coughed up a 33"" and a reef as you exit the narrow into Cul de Sac produced countless more eyes and three muskies including a 52"" to a fellow with more patience than me. The rapids into Shoal produced well for a couple of guys from Nebraska whom we met although we never personally tried the area (Shoal or Nebraska)The area as a whole will give you the best bet for an August 30"" as any Ive fished. Find the reefs, keep in movin water and/or windward areas, fish under 20' and all will be very good."
