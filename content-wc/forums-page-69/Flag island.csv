This was before the border strike was even on the table I called right after they announced the august 9 opening. I suspect it will be this way until someone declares the wuhan crisis is over. For now they want every US citizen entering Canadian land air or waters to go through the virus protocol and face to face screening.

6586224,skap,2021-08-03 14:42:00,58,"I hate to say it, but as it is right now you will probably need to stay in Canada if you want to fish Canadian waters. Unfortunately as it stands today water crossings are not an option. Hoping there are additional clarifications and updates as we get closer to next week and over the next month. To be completely honest, I am not totally sure how we legally drive back to the US to come home when you use a remote reporting station. Hard to get a covid test at the Angle. I have reservations up there over Labor Day weekend myself and having that option is a big reason I go to that area. Good luck!!!"

6586552,Guest,2021-08-04 09:50:00,0,"Anyone have any updated info on this? We are in the same situation, staying at Flag Island and boating into Canadian waters is such a draw for us."
6587444,Guest,2021-08-06 13:17:00,0,It looks like the old rules will apply on the 9th.https://www.canada.ca/en/border-serv...1OIorpsQpNk-BU
6587564,C182P,2021-08-07 03:53:00,59,Per call to Canadian customs Fort Francis no entry onto Canadian waters will not be permitted unless you first cross into Canada via land crossing at a port of entry. I asked because we like to fish border waters out of Crane Lake MN and fish Canadian side also. So to fish Canadian side of LOW you would need to cross at Baudette or FF.
6587592,ifishmn,2021-08-07 06:12:00,162,"I've asked this question to two different resort operations at the Angle, with no response yet. My guess is the border agents at this time are going to take a very hard stance in their interpretation of the new rules to encourage as much traffic at the border as possible. Fits with the timing of the strike. Will wait to hear from the folks at the Angle who will get the real story from their contacts who will be actually patrolling the lake. These resorts don't want their guests getting into a bind with the good neighbors to the north and ruining a trip."
