Watch that yearly progression in the regeneration of the land.[/QUOTEI was there when that fire started. Had a bad storm go by and saw the lightening strike. Bombers thought they had it out but it flared up big-time the next day. We were in the west end of Sen Bay. Smoke was so thick it blocked the sun and burnt pine needles rained from the sky. Flames started over the hill our way and we got the heck out of there. Next year same week we were back. Looked cool, regeneration started and they arial seeded with jackpine. It's nice and green and did not affect fishing.By the way, the Loon Rapids bridge was put in a year or two BEFORE the fire. It was put in because they planned to log live trees. It was all salvage logging after that and they lost several million dollars."
6587468,PRO-V16,2021-08-06 15:10:00,454,Here are some pictures of the fire on Lac Seul that I posted about.
6587558,prov1900,2021-08-06 23:06:00,544,Those pics are amazing!
6585374,David Anderson,2021-08-01 12:28:00,2073,"Well sounds like the island should be the same. Forest fires are interesting, like a lot of members state, it's interesting to see the changes, We fish Lac Seul and there are area's by Scaler Lake that was once burnt but now it's pretty dense and green. Think about it, say one day your outfitter claims you've lost all your hair....sorry not welcome! Go enjoy yourself."
6585378,Ohio fisherman,2021-08-01 12:47:00,988,Life is short and getting shorter each day. You have already seen plenty of fire damage and reforestation. No need to experience that instead of what you already know you like and desire to experience. The fire is sad and the devastation will recover over many years and decades. You have time for one last hurrah trip with your daughter. Find a new destination and make it the best ever.
6585382,Wallychowder,2021-08-01 12:49:00,1567,Ask your daughter what she would like to do ?
6585386,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2021-08-01 12:58:00,240,"I have experienced this situation on the Gunflint Trail, which was affected by the Ham Lake fire of 2007, which was a huge fire, causing evacuations up and down the trail. It was a minor miracle that our family's vacation spot, the Gunflint Lodge, survived. The whole Canadian side of the lake burned. If you ever are in the market for a good read, the book Fire on the Gunflint, is a very well-written book. We went back for our family vacation, and, like many have stated, used the experience to educate our kids on the cycle of fire and restoration. (the fishing was still as good!) In 2011, Larus Lake (Nestor Falls Outposts) experienced fire which came literally within yards of burning a brand-new outpost camp. Never gave a second thought to not returning. Heaven on earth, Larus Lake is to me. In 2018, 5 of my group of 6 decided to no longer return, and our 17 year run of May/June heaven was over. I still mourn that. I still made 2-3 outpost trips a summer up until last year. If you really love something, fire damage and other 'blemishes' don't really matter. At least, that's my two-cents worth. The beauty will return."
6585458,Da' Walleye Assassun,2021-08-01 17:15:00,358,It was about a year after the fire. The fishing did not seem affected compared with previous trips. The beauty of the scenery was missing.
6585500,hoppy63,2021-08-01 18:55:00,367,For whatever reason the burned out ares I have been seem to produce more blueberries......go catch fish and make blueberry pancakes!
6585544,Ohio fisherman,2021-08-01 22:09:00,988,"As Hoppy suggests, we make pancakes. We always take along some good pancake mix, real maple syrup, and homemade breakfast sausage. We find blueberries in areas that have been cut for timber and are progressing with the stages of forest succession."

6585596,tv4fish,2021-08-02 06:54:00,2694,"Big: I also remember seeing Deception Bay right after the fire went across it --- pretty amazing how the forests have ""regenerated"" in that area............"
6585604,wallypod,2021-08-02 07:20:00,21,"For me, suggest looking for a new camp. Returned to a burned lake/cabin and still reminisce about about the big timber edged lake shores. Fishing was/is still fantastic. If looking to continue a tradition you may be disappointed. However if you go to a new location you can continue the most important traditions of being together without the distraction and heartbreak of your favorite spots on the lake unrecognizable. Just my opinion..."
6585218,NM_Trout,2021-08-01 06:40:00,1094,"My family has a favorite outpost in NW Ontario, featuring a cabin on a tiny island. We just received word that the cabin and island didn't take damage, but the area around the lake ""doesn't have much left to burn"". Much of the joy of the trip isn't merely the fishing, but the enjoyment of the beauty of the north woods. The thick moss all the way up to the pine trees. The sounds and smells of the forest. My kids loved exploring the water line, having shore lunches, and I loved it as it was a great change from living in the desert. Sounds like much of that is gone.Not sure how much the fishing will be impacted, as I have to think that rain runoff is going to put a bunch of ash in the water and the chemistry may be changed. Trying to also figure out if a visit there is just going to be heartbreak. But I also hate to say goodbye. Darn near feels like I lost a close friend. It will be 30 years before it ""looks like it used to"".What do you think? Time to find someplace new to make memories? I've got a deposit in place that I might be able to change to a new camp. I guess I have almost a year to decide."
6585250,That Minnesota guy,2021-08-01 07:34:00,8293,It would be a lesson for the kids that things change and the world works in mysterious ways. From the outfitters point of view i'm sure he would love to see you after what they have been through. Only you can decide whats important.
6585260,Huntindave,2021-08-01 07:51:00,2194,"I have been in areas following a major burn. Yes, twelve months later there is regeneration already taking place. It is actually quite interesting to see how, as the environment transitions, so do the animals using the changing environment. One will usually have an increase in actual sightings of many animals simply because of the sparse and changing cover. Like has been said, only you can decide, if you and your kids would like to see and experience the transition as it happens or prefer the same-ole same-ole."
6585274,Wrktfsh,2021-08-01 08:23:00,492,"I'd go back. You've seen it at its best, you have a chance to see it at its worst and if you go back you see it recover"
6585280,Pooch,2021-08-01 08:30:00,4618,"Absolutely go! Photo areas then each year go back to the same spot and retake another photo. It is interesting to see how fast nature rebounds after a fire. The one thing I noticed after a fire on Birch Lake, ON was the mix of tree species changed. After a year there we so many new saplings the whole area was green already. Two years later most people would never realize there had been a recent fire. With the competition for light, the trees grew tall quickly. Pooch"
6585306,NM_Trout,2021-08-01 09:06:00,1094,"Good comments.My ""kids"" are now in their older 20's, and they have seen quite a bit of this already. We live in the US SW, and we have spent a lot of time in the Southern Rocky Mountains. Bark beetle damage, coupled with drought has brought many devastating fires to the area. The first trees back are the aspens due to their shared root structure. We camp several times a year near Creede CO, and have been camping in burn areas for years now. Even after 10 years now, with aspens about 10-12' tall, we still prefer getting out into the tall pines. We only get up to the north woods once every 3-4 years, and it is always a pleasure to be surrounded by that much green. I know that it will eventually come back. I need to weigh whether or not I want to be in the middle of it next year.Next year is a big year I suspect. My youngest is getting married this September, and I am trying to sneak in one last dad / daughter trip before grandkids come into the picture. Don't get me wrong... I am looking forward to that one day too. It would just be nice to have one more Ontario adventure with her 1:1. We need to determine if we go to the place we know, or try something new. Both have pros and cons. More than for me, I want her to have a great trip. I've posted this one before, but it is one of my favorite pix."
6585326,Da' Walleye Assassun,2021-08-01 09:39:00,358,"I have fished lakes after a forest fire. It was much less of a ""Canadian experience"" if that makes sense."
6585338,Baseline,2021-08-01 10:59:00,3207,"It is your vacation. If you want the pristine Canadian experience then switch resorts. If you want a lesson in the effects of forest fires then go back. If you don't care one way or the other then there isn't much of a choice to make. Personally, I'd give the area a year of two to regenerate, then go back."
6585344,Eckohlt,2021-08-01 11:22:00,3685,"I won't give it anytime to regenerate if I pound big fish in the lake,I'd go right back pronto."
6585372,NM_Trout,2021-08-01 12:10:00,1094,How soon after the fire? How was the fishing?
