6587580,tv4fish,2021-08-07 05:06:00,2694,"I have to admit - a 2 percent yearly increase does seem a little small - Quote: A four year agreement from 2018-2021 with an average annual increase of 2 per cent per year BUT They can now look at it as ""back pay""............ (8 % increase)........"
6587584,Bigtaproot,2021-08-07 05:41:00,900,Not much better benefits than the old lady and I have at the pork processing plant. They even fell for the word promise in the final settlement which is usually a mistake.
6587596,walleyecheek,2021-08-07 06:13:00,2231,"The way I'm reading it. They get a 2 percent raise for 2018,19,20,21 ? Basically back pay ! Whats the new contract say going forward ?"
6587598,pjshorthorn,2021-08-07 06:30:00,5654,"Smart business decision in order to get some things fixed. Tough to do your job well when subjected to the type of things , if true, that they are claiming. I would have loved sitting in the room watching and listening to both sides at the bargaining table.

6587610,Obabikon,2021-08-07 06:48:00,2370,"I am glad it is resolvedâ¦ But holding us hostage, and causing more problems for us was not OK."
6587620,RichA$1970,2021-08-07 07:00:00,1159,Well another obstacle eliminated so we can kill this thread. Now we just need some rain and hopefully no issues with the rapid tests and back to business.

6587656,prov1800,2021-08-07 08:41:00,5010,Got some rain and some more on its way this week.Cold front in now also.
6587676,RichA$1970,2021-08-07 10:05:00,1159,"More good news and hope business picks up for all of you next week. For all of us tourists who have been b*tching since March 2020 trying to get in, there might be some hiccups, delays and minor issues but let it go as I’m sure everyone’s trying their best and just enjoy the lakes. I’m truly looking forward to it as some people she’ll out $$$ to shrinks and this is my form of therapy."
6587686,Short Strike,2021-08-07 11:12:00,56,just 36 short hours away... everything is lining up nicely.
6587498,reddemon2,2021-08-06 17:39:00,255,"It's not looking good as truck traffic at the current crossings is reporting 2-4hr delays. If this is any indication of what's to come, Monday will be interesting and wouldn't doubt it if only 1 lane will be used for entry. I will be watching closely as I'm looking to cross next thursday in I-Falls"
6587508,walleyecheek,2021-08-06 18:00:00,2231,"Oh yeah, its going to get worse. The border isn't even open yet. Get prepared !"
6587512,Eckohlt,2021-08-06 18:10:00,3685,"I'll wait no more than 24 hours at the border,after that I'll head back south."
6587514,reddemon2,2021-08-06 18:13:00,255,Only 24? You may have to get some of that lemonade to hold you over
6587518,Eckohlt,2021-08-06 18:22:00,3685,Walleye chowder I think is going to have a lemonade stand set up.
6587548,RichA$1970,2021-08-06 21:08:00,1159,How about some Lot Lizards to kill some time while waiting?
6587562,C182P,2021-08-07 03:25:00,59,I see Reuters article saying 5 hour delays at some crossings. And this is only commercial truck traffic. Can't imagine what it might be once non essential travel starts on Monday. How many truckers many that are paid by the mile will sit for 5 hours making nothing?
