6587146,Baseline,2021-08-05 17:24:00,3207,"I'm planning on heading to the border at Fort Francis next Wed. I stopped by my local Walgreens to check on testing. They told me they were out of the quick tests so all test had to be sent to the lab. The pharm-tech said the shortage of tests was at all stores in the area. They said results of the other test they offer can arrive in 2 to 5 days no guarantees. CVS same story. Local medical facilities same story and need referral. Walk up Minnesota State testing center results in 24 to 48 hours, but could take 5 days - no guarantees. So in northern MN, at least, it is a crap shoot getting results of an approved test within the 72 hour requirement. Then there is the matter of the strike of the Border Patrol. I have an appointment Monday morning. I let you know how it goes."
6587148,Larry S,2021-08-05 17:28:00,665,Got a test yesterday at CVS a PCR/NAAT Got the results at 1035pm Same day on my phone & computer Also several friends got same test and got results back the same day. No delay here in Nevada
6587216,C182P,2021-08-05 21:04:00,59,From north of the range and have found out the same. All had available ID NOW tests yesterday and all gone today. And problem with Walgreens is you can only book 48 hours in advance for the ID NOW at least that’s what I found on the website. Looked today and could book tomorrow but all next week blocked off. None of the 3 Walgreens on the range test on Saturday or Sunday. Planning on Wednesday for the border also so need test Monday. None of the range hospitals have the ID now and all ship out the samples for the PCR. One of them did tell me I could expect the PCR back within 24. But can’t guarantee. It’s a dilemma for us that don’t live near the tall buildings.
