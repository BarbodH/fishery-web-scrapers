6586476,Bill Krejca,2021-08-04 07:04:00,6107,"RE: Gullet - I normally can get 2 pieces out of one by cutting lengthwise, and attaching to a bucktail/feathered jig. Piece not used can be wrapped in a wet cloth; the front part of the gullet is super tough, sometime can get much of a day out of the same piece, even when catching! Long time ago, I watched a pike pick up such a jig just sitting on the bottom in shallow water, assumed attraction was scent. Bill"
6586482,prov1800,2021-08-04 07:21:00,5010,Iam sure its the scent Bill.They definatly last unless a northern bites it off or get hung up on a rock.But they are easy to replace.

Tried a while longer and only caught some pike which were slow to.On to the walleyes.Very good bite but mainly small one again but ended up with 4 good eatèrs.Smallies are in about the same depth as walleyes so ended up catching a bunch of them to.Fun day except for the smoke
