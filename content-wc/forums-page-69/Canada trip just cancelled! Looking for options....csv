6586690,ljcs789,2021-08-04 17:09:00,42,"just booked at Nodak Lodge on Lake Winnie in Minnesota and we were able to roll over our deposits to 2022 at Viking Lodge. As long as we can get a boat on the water and throw out a line, everything is good. Here's to all for safety in these fires and safe travels as you make your way to outposts this year! Thanks all for the suggestions!"

6586246,ljcs789,2021-08-03 15:34:00,42,Just found out that Viking Outpost in Red Lake is still under the wildfires and they just cancelled our trip to Telescope Lake for 8/13-8/20. So sad for all of them (and us) just purchased groceries and licenses last week! We will roll over into next year. We're trying to line up a Minnesota option for a bring your own boat option. Longshot here-most everyone is booked up so I know chances are slim. Let me know if anyone has any ideas. Thanks!!
6586248,That Minnesota guy,2021-08-03 15:38:00,8293,Check with the Thunderbird Lodge on Rainy 218-286-3151 if they can't help start calling the resorts on Kab.
6586260,C182P,2021-08-03 16:08:00,59,Kab Rainy Low and Vermilion are all options. Unfortunately virtually every resort in northern half of MN is booked solid through their close up and have been since late May. You might get lucky with someone doing a last minute cancellation. What about a resort on the Canadian side of LOW?
6586264,KSjim,2021-08-03 16:24:00,88,"If you are still interested in going to Canada, Loon Haunt Outpost operates out of Red Lake and their website indicates they have some opening at camps not effected by the local fires. Have made at least a dozen trips with Bill and Louise and highly recommend them. loonhaunt.com"
6586310,drlee,2021-08-03 18:09:00,409,"Could check Press Lake Camp. Drive in, own boat or rental, north of Ignace, ONT, 10,000 acres, 1 camp on system fed by English River, no private cabins. Very good fishing. Good owners. Nice cabins.This will be my 16th year there, so I guess I must like it."
6586312,Eckohlt,2021-08-03 18:11:00,3685,Be there oct 2
6586450,Habitual Eyer,2021-08-04 06:15:00,144,If you have your own boat haul it to Red Lake or Gullrock. After fly-ins and remote drive-ins over the last few decades I have settled on Gullrock and Red. Surprisingly outstanding fishing and many camps. Minnesota packed and rates have skyrocketed.
6586466,prov1800,2021-08-04 06:47:00,5010,Sorry to hear that.There's plenty of camps that will have openings.If your familiar with hwy#105 there will lots of openings along there
6586568,7 Mag,2021-08-04 10:48:00,1887,Check Cedar Point Lodge on Eagle Lake they may have an opening.
6586652,JAY221,2021-08-04 15:25:00,877,"I believe Rainbow Point Lodge at Perrault Falls has some openings. Later, Jay"
