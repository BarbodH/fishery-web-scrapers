6585968,Eckohlt,2021-08-03 05:23:00,3685,"Longer wait just leave earlier,not a problem."
6585970,Wallychowder,2021-08-03 05:25:00,1567,Do you think a week early will be sufficient ?
6586106,C182P,2021-08-03 10:54:00,59,"Biggest thing worrying me at this point is being the unlucky recipient of a random test kit. All the hassle of trying to get that test submitted before leaving civilization, plus checking for results without internet or cell coverage. Throw in the delta which seems to like to hide in fully vaccinated people and a positive up there would be bad. Does anyone know if you came up positive on a random are you stuck for 14 days in your cabin in Canada or are you allowed to pack up and head south immediately? I suspect a call to Ministry of Health would be the only way to get this answered."
6586142,Eckohlt,2021-08-03 11:38:00,3685,"I'm thinking 2 weeks,that should get you to where your going in time."
6585752,bus33,2021-08-02 12:35:00,289,You are right....I haven't found anywhere that it says random. Has anyone called Canadian Customs and talked to a live person?
6585756,C182P,2021-08-02 12:41:00,59,"It did say random before. go to Entry Requirements for Fully Vaccinated Travelers on the website. That is where it states the entry test is one of the requirements, not random. Again, hope the website change is incorrect. anyone planning to go next week I HIGHLY recommend a call to the border station you plan on crossing at."
6585758,C182P,2021-08-02 12:49:00,59,"So I just called to Canada customs in the Fort, and the nice officer on the phone told me that as of August 9, the arrival testing will be RANDOM. Would be the kit as they have handed out before. Customs really has nothing to do with this, its the Ministry of Health, and they are just the middle person so to speak. She did not know what the travel Canada website no longer says random, but assured me that will be the case."
6585760,bus33,2021-08-02 12:50:00,289,Thanks for the info.....I was on hold with them until I saw this.
6585762,Hookhunter75,2021-08-02 12:56:00,60,I also spoke with Pembina Emerson crossing and was told the same thing. Testing will be randomized. However Pembina Emerson crossing has Red Cross on site and travelers will be tested there if chosen.
6585766,Wallychowder,2021-08-02 13:23:00,1567,&#x1f923; That all sounds like quite a few hoops to jump through !!!
6585774,MikeAnkeny,2021-08-02 13:57:00,67,Yikes! Trip to Minnesota side of LOTW is looking better every day.
6585860,v-bay gord,2021-08-02 16:50:00,3168,"Seems like a lot of misinformation going on. I will post actual results from a number of my US guests scheduled to arrive on August 11. The good, the bad, the ugly.... By the way get your neighbor vaccinated."
6585922,C182P,2021-08-02 20:44:00,59,Biggest source of misinformation is Canada's own travel website. Be nice if what the official site says agreed with what the front line agents say. Next worry will be the strike and any slow down that may accompany it.
6585962,Guest,2021-08-03 04:58:00,0,Toronto news reported last night Canadian Border Agents could strike as soon as this Friday. Not good news.
6585646,Guest,2021-08-02 08:47:00,0,Can you post an official link that states it will be random. The Canada govt website makes it look like all will be tested. It will be done at the border or if they do not have the ability to test you get a take with you test that you send in. Not sure how that will be possible for fisherman and none of the border crossings to NW Ontario have the ability to test on site. If I knew how to post the link I would maybe someone smarter than me can. I really hope you are correct but we will all know in about a week.
6585650,BuckeyeATC,2021-08-02 09:05:00,88,About half way down this page. https://www.canada.ca/en/public-heal...ravellers.html
6585674,skap,2021-08-02 09:46:00,58,"So something appears may have changed with these entry requirements. I follow this pretty closely and the test requirement was always written that you may be subjected to a random test. Thus the reason you needed a quarantine plan if that test came back positive. Now it kind of looks like the original verbiage has changed and they are testing everyone when crossing, as well requiring the 72 pre arrival test. This is kind of a big change that has slipped under the radar if true. You still don't get the test results back right away so you still need the quarantine plan but I find it a little crazy they are testing literally everyone with an onsite test or a take home test."
6585712,djk50164,2021-08-02 11:15:00,370,"I'm thinking exact opposite, less traffic with more time available to test."
6585724,bus33,2021-08-02 11:41:00,289,That was my thought too.....more time to get the wrinkles out. I'm willing to pay the price I guess. We are planning on being there at midnight.
6585726,C182P,2021-08-02 11:51:00,59,"So reading about this on the travel.gc.ca website and the wording has been changed. Before they referred to random tests at the border. They now say everyone will be tested at the border. My crossing at Fort Francis doesn't have ability to test you on site so it looks like they will give you a self test packet at the border and waive you through. Then you are supposed to have set up an account with Switch Health in Ontario in advance, and scheduled a time in advance to have your online consultation on doing the test to yourself, administer the test-possibly while they watch via Face time or some other app, then deliver the test to a courier (fedex?) to deliver it to their labs. You then must be able to be contacted by internet(or maybe you must keep going online to check) to find out your results. Gotta guess this may take 4 to 5 days since courier has to deliver and they have to run in in their lab. This is the same procedure that Canadians and duals have had to do when entering Canada, except for they had to quarantine for 14 days at their house and also do a second self test at day 8. So it seems like the only change is no 14 day quarantine and no day 8 test while awaiting your results. I see this as a complete show stopper for 99% of the people that want to take a week long fishing trip. Just trying to book your appointment time with Switch Health when you don't know how long you will be held up at the border and other variables will be hard. And no saying 4 people traveling together will be able to schedule all their online appointments close to the same time. And where to you find a courier and what hours are they available to drop our test off? And all of this is assuming you have good internet or cell data service to do the test and check results."
6585728,Larry S,2021-08-02 11:53:00,665,"skap read the quote from BuckeyeATC The Government is testing RANDOMLY, Only selected persons will be tested NOT EVERYONE!!"
6585738,C182P,2021-08-02 12:19:00,59,"Don't rely on anyone's quotes including mine. See for yourself at https://travel.gc.ca It very clearly states that everyone (no longer says random as it did last Friday) will be tested at the border. It lays out the procedures for those crossings that do and don't have testing ability on site. It lists only 17 exceptions to the arrival testing requirement and being fully vaccinated and have a negative 72 hour test are NOT exceptions. Passing through to Alaska, youth sports teams, and a few other things are exceptions. The wording has definitely changed from random to everyone with limited exceptions. I hope someone else can go into the official Canada travel website and tell me I'm reading this wrong. Otherwise I am not going to try to cross until these additional steps are eliminated."
6585748,KC Walleye,2021-08-02 12:31:00,274,"Wow, this is a game changer for sure. What once seems to be an easy crossing with pre planning, now is a nightmare once again? Hopefully someone can enlighten us all and debunk the supposed changes."
6585750,C182P,2021-08-02 12:33:00,59,I'm hoping for the same as we have laid a lot of legwork into going up on the 11th. Hopefully the official website is not correct at the moment. Our previous plan was if we were chosen for random testing we were just going to do a U turn and head home.
6585278,bus33,2021-08-01 08:30:00,289,"We are had a change of plans and now are going to try to cross the border on the 9th. I understand the vaccine and pre-entry covid test requirements. When reading the requirements/checklists on the Canada website it talks about “Arrival Testing”.Language from Canada…“ Taking your arrival testWhen you enter Canada, you'll be instructed to either take an arrival test at the border, or receive a home test kit.If you don’t qualify as fully vaccinated, you will also get a kit to use on Day-8 of your mandatory quarantine (except for travellers who are only passing through on their way to or from Alaska).There is no fee for the arrival test.”Also….“ Who doesn’t need an arrival testFully vaccinated travellers still have to do an arrival test.Travellers who provide a positive COVID-19 test result may be exempt from arrival testing.”Also…“Find out if your travel may be exemptFilter by keywords for your work roles or personal situations, then open the options that appear. Filter content: results appear below as you type.Showing 17 filtered from 17 total entriesAll eligible vaccinated travellersFully vaccinated travellers who are eligible to enter Canada are exempt from some requirements if they meet certain conditions.Check if you qualify as fully vaccinatedPre-entry test requiredArrival test requiredExempt from Day-8 testExempt from quarantineExempt from mandatory hotel stopover”Can someone explain this? Is this the random testing we talk about or does everyone also have to get tested at the border?Thanks"
6585332,Larry S,2021-08-01 10:04:00,665,"After the 9th when you arrive at the border via land, you present your vaccination card and test you took within 72 hours . The border has the prerogative to give someone a test. It all depends on the border people Larry S"
6585560,Twins_dad,2021-08-02 04:46:00,38,Our group was discussing this just yesterday. One of the cooler heads in the group suggested...let's just monitor walleye central daily after the boarder opens for updates on how the process does or doesn't work. So we are holding tight...for now.
6585570,tv4fish,2021-08-02 05:16:00,2694,Do you really think that this will be settled??http://fraservalleynewsnetwork.com/2...strike-action/
6585582,Hookhunter75,2021-08-02 06:09:00,60,Yes this was a timed tactic. Even if it does happen 90 percent of those workers are deemed essential and can’t strike.
6585594,bus33,2021-08-02 06:51:00,289,"Well, we are planning on getting in line at midnight so I guess we are the guinea pigs."
6585600,MikeF,2021-08-02 07:02:00,895,"They may not be able to actual stop working and/or picket, but they sure can adjust their work speed accordingly. I am sure confusion about new crossing requirements and procedures could be of help to their cause."
6585612,Hookhunter75,2021-08-02 07:33:00,60,No doubt. They may not stop working but the wait times would be substantial.
6585624,tv4fish,2021-08-02 08:04:00,2694,And THAT is exactly what I am thinking...............
6585642,BuckeyeATC,2021-08-02 08:39:00,88,"After August 9th, the CBSA will be randomly selecting incoming travelers for on-site testing as I understand it. I'm guessing if you cross between 11:00pm and 6:00am your chances of being randomly chosen for testing will be significantly less."
