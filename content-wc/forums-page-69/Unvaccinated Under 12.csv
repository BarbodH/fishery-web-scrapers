6587802,treegrower,2021-08-07 20:24:00,5,My son age 11 will be crossing the border with me at Pigeon River in a couple weeks. He’s too young to be vaccinated. I have conflicting information on if he will need the day 1 testing as we won’t be in Canada for the day 8 test. Sounds like they give a test kit. We are fishing north of Ignace. Has anyone done one of these things? Will I be able to do the kit in TBay with internet access then drop it somewhere? I don’t want to do it at the camp and find out there’s no way to send it anywhere.
