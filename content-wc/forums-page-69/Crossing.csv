6586870,Bigtaproot,2021-08-05 07:05:00,900,Many thanks for the very detailed information
6586958,LOW1,2021-08-05 10:02:00,2828,"I hope they speed up that process. If I remember correctly there are four lines for cars at the IFalls/ Fort Frances crossing. Assuming 15 minutes per car that means 4 cars per hour per line or 16 cars per hour for the entire crossing location. Or only about 400 cars per 24 hours. Maybe there will be multiple border agents ""out on the pavement"" instead of just in their booths to speed up that process. Otherwise it may be a very long wait."
6586968,C182P,2021-08-05 10:57:00,59,"Most I've ever seen is 2 lines opened at busy times at the Fort. One normally. So either 2 windows or 1. With a strike who knows? It will be Monday or Tuesday before we see if they are going to move us right through or bring it down to a snails pace. Also there is still only one lane open to non-commercial traffic on the bridge . I don't see there being any out on the pavement cause they need their computer screen up to look at your Arrive Can app, scan your PP, etc. They will have every opportunity to go exactly by the book and grind it to a halt if it is what they decide to do for strike purposes. Hope I'm wrong. Spoke with Canada Customs at the bridge twice this week and they've been as friendly and helpful as always so I'm hoping nothing changes."
6586996,fishingfever,2021-08-05 12:11:00,85,"Years ago we were in a line at the Falls that was very long and barely moving. I called the border at Baudette and asked about the line there. The lady said ""sir, there is no line here"". After a short debate we pulled out of line and drove to Baudette and went right through. I don't know if we saved time or not but it felt good to me moving instead of sitting still. I doubt that will work now though. LOL."
6587002,johnboat,2021-08-05 12:18:00,2014,Shhhhhhhhh............
6587014,C182P,2021-08-05 12:30:00,59,"That may work for some people depending on destination, but if you're going east and north out of the Fort that means you get to drive all the way west to Baudette an hour before coming back east another hour. . Time in line vs time on the road? who knows."
6587064,Thunder Bay Walleye,2021-08-05 14:43:00,56,Slowdown at the border https://www.tbnewswatch.com/local-ne...adline-4196648
6587076,C182P,2021-08-05 15:05:00,59,"Oh boy, I figured that going by every detail in the book could bring it to a standstill. Looks like that may happen. Can you imagine being in line for 4 hours then answering 682 questions before being waived through? Bring your pee bottles and skip the morning coffee. Gonna be lots of bursting bladders. Your 72 hour test results could expire while you're in line. All they have to do is start passing out the random test kits to everyone in line to bring all this to a screeching halt."
6587114,reddemon2,2021-08-05 16:21:00,255,Heading up on Saturday to get in line
6586664,Obabikon,2021-08-04 16:13:00,2370,"I am a dual citizen and resort owner. Since we were deemed âessentialâ 14 months ago, we have been allowed to cross. Border opens on the 9th"
6586684,x4flatfish,2021-08-04 17:00:00,319,This is really good info! Thanks for taking the time. Now my question. You said maybe a half hour to cross. I am assuming this includes time sitting in line? About how long can we expect to spend with a border agent? Usually through in a couple minutes. About how much time do you think has been added to the procedure doing the required paperwork etc.?
6586702,Obabikon,2021-08-04 17:56:00,2370,"There was absolutely no line when we crossed. We were the only people at the border the entire time we were there. I am not sure what that will do in the long run, with many cars coming in. I would assume that there will be a wait to get to the windowâ¦ Then you can expect 15 to 30 minutes."
6586706,x4flatfish,2021-08-04 18:04:00,319,wow!
6586736,phishfearme,2021-08-04 19:26:00,1242,yes - opens on the 9th - although Tooski is right - if i say it's open on the 11th then it's open on the 11th - unless it's not. phish
6586746,phishfearme,2021-08-04 19:32:00,1242,"no doubt about it, the crossing at grand portage (pigeon river) is MUCH faster and less hastle than IF - and worth a bit of an extra drive. convenient duty free and gas right there also. phish"
6586784,Pooch,2021-08-04 20:48:00,4618,"Depends on where you are coming from and where you are going to as to whether it saves any time to cross at one or the other crossings. If you have to sit in line at FF/IF for an hour, but the extra drive time to cross at PR is more than an hour then you would be better off to sit in line at FF/IF and save your gas. Traffic on 61 through MN is many times really slow with all the tourist towns and cross traffic. Used to be terrible to get behind a slow driver as you are many times stuck there for many miles. Under powered rigs towing a camper were the worst. Lots of slow down areas. Oh yea... bicycles and pedestrians. Border crossing is usually quicker at PR, but FF/IF is usually faster travel in MN side. At last there are places to pass on 53. Just my thoughts as we cross at both places depending on where we are fishing that trip. We always go through Superior/Duluth then split off to 53 or 61 after crossing the bay bridge. Pooch"
6586830,Wallychowder,2021-08-05 05:16:00,1567,"Yeah, but there not on strike yet either ! Tomorrow will tell the real story !"
6586858,Obabikon,2021-08-05 06:27:00,2370,"I'm trying to stay positive. It is shameful that the border guards are doing this now. I understand wanting a new contract. However, they could have gone on strike 6 months ago or in two months. Instead they are holding an industry hostage who has done nothing but suffer for 18 months. Why not punish us some more?"
6586860,Hookhunter75,2021-08-05 06:29:00,60,It’s cut throat. They know they will get that little extra they want by doing this.
6586554,a_hershy,2021-08-04 09:53:00,36,Great info.Thank you.
6586558,Esoxfeign1313,2021-08-04 09:59:00,79,"Ah, I missed that part. Thanks"
6586576,kettyspanky,2021-08-04 11:09:00,271,Thanks for the update and the great info. Very helpful.
6586586,phishfearme,2021-08-04 11:22:00,1242,"great info and many thanks to Obabikon! remember, his crossing times quoted are BEFORE the border opens on the 11th. who knows what the waits will be but it's probably a good bet they will be longer - and that's assuming there's no strike. phish"
6586610,Wallychowder,2021-08-04 13:27:00,1567,I thought it opened on the 9th ?
6586612,tooski,2021-08-04 13:35:00,393,It opens whenever Phish says it opens. Phish aren't the only thing that phears him...
6586614,Bstar,2021-08-04 13:36:00,564,"Jared, Thanks for the info. We'll be crossing at IFalls on 8/12."
6586644,Mojo-NC,2021-08-04 14:33:00,1929,"Great information, thank you! I have a question that you may or may not be able to answer based on your experience. On my official CDC vaccination card, the vaccination site entered of the required vaccination information for both doses on the front side of the card (manufacturer, lot number, date, and location), but did not include any of my personal information as indicated. The name, DOB, and patient number lines were all left blank on the front of the card. However, on the back of the card they placed a sticker with a barcode that contained all of the required personal information. Do you think that will be a problem? ArriveCAN also has a place where vaccination #1 and vaccination #2 photos are required. I'm not sure if I should include a picture of the front of the CDC card as V1 and the back of the card as V2. My other option would be to photograph separate vaccination cards (not CDC) that were used by the site to document time, manufacturer, Dose 1 or 2, time, the name of the individual that gave me the vaccination, observation time, next appointment date/time, etc. Lot number was not included on those cards. I will bring both versions of vaccination documentation along with my passport, but would like to try to minimize confusion as much as possible in advance with respect to what I use for the arriveCAN app. Others may also have the same issue, who knows? This is new territory for everyone."
6586658,reddemon2,2021-08-04 16:00:00,255,Another way to look at border crossing timeshttps://bwt.cbp.gov/ I may drive the extra miles and go thru Grand Portage rather than I falls
6586662,Obabikon,2021-08-04 16:11:00,2370,"Mojoâ¦. It should not be a problem. Scan everything in or photo everything in. It'll be OK if you do front on photo number one and back on photo number two. Or you can chop the two together. Do your best to document it, and then bring the physical copies with you to the border. You will be just fine"
6586504,Obabikon,2021-08-04 08:25:00,2370,"So myself and the entire family crossed the border on Sunday. It was slow, but efficient. I want everybody to be prepared to spend some time at the border. They will get better with a little more experience. Given the circumstances, we are happy the border is opening. Here are things that you must do to cross the Canadian border.1. Proof of vaccination (paper card will work). Anyone 12 and older needs to be vaccinated to cross without quarantine. 11 and younger are free to travel with a vaccinated guardian. However they still will require a negative molecular test within 72 hours of travel. You must have fully completed your vaccination two weeks prior to travel.￼2. Negative molecular test within 72 hours of crossing (pcr, nat, naat…. and more are acceptable). Here is a list of acceptable tests…https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/tr...getting-tested3. Use the arrivecan app prior to travel. You can download this to any smart phone… Or you can use your personal computer at home. This process takes about 10 minutes to answer the questions. You will need your passport or drivers license and vaccine card to fill out the information. You will be asked to either take a picture of or scan your card and upload it to the program. This is to be done 72 hours or less from your crossing. Here is the link to arrivecan…https://arrivecan.cbsa-asfc.cloud-nuage.canada.ca/authI want to add that arrivecan is a completely free service. If it any point in time they ask for payment information, you are on the wrong site. Stop immediately and do not keep going. You can always contact me directly if you need help. In the process of filling out the information, you can add dependents that are traveling with you. If you are not going to use your mobile phone… Make sure you print out the receipt before leaving home. It will be the last page on your home computer.This sounds like a lot, but I am being incredibly thorough. I want it clear for everyone, but at the same time I want everyone to know this was not too complicated. We are all hoping to get things back to normal for next year, and are happy do you have anything this year.Thanks, JaredIf you have questions, feel free to email me… Even if you are not coming to our camp. My additional contact information is on our website, if you prefer to talk by phone.[email protected]"
6586508,rosh1,2021-08-04 08:27:00,275,Thanks for update
6586514,Hookhunter75,2021-08-04 08:33:00,60,When you crossed how in depth did they get regarding a quarantine plan?
6586516,Hillbiehle,2021-08-04 08:33:00,66,Thanks for the information. Can you define slow? 30 minutes? 2 hours? Was this at International Falls?
6586520,bus33,2021-08-04 08:35:00,289,...And you said in a previous post you and your family used the Walgreens ID NOW test?
6586524,Obabikon,2021-08-04 08:43:00,2370,"We used the NAAT test at Walgreens.It took me an hour to get across. However, that isn’t what you will go through… I was importing goods also, and that takes time. If it had just been a simple crossing… Maybe 30 minutes?"
6586526,Obabikon,2021-08-04 08:45:00,2370,"A resort was an acceptable place to have a “quarantine plan”. They didn’t even talk about it.I crossed in Baudette Minnesota/rainy river Ontario.Another positive thing… The “random test” is a small box that you take with you to your destination. We did these already, and was not a big deal. They are NOT going to have a medical tent sitting right there, test you, and then send you home."
6586528,Hookhunter75,2021-08-04 08:49:00,60,That’s great information. Thank you!
6586536,Esoxfeign1313,2021-08-04 09:19:00,79,"Thank you for the detailed info, but I thought the border opened on 8/9. I’m confused."
6586538,Da' Walleye Assassun,2021-08-04 09:25:00,358,Obabikon owns a resort in Ontario. He is allowed to cross the border for business.
