I have never done a fly-in trip this late, and am noticing all the fire activity around Red Lake, and to the west. I haven't contacted our outfitter yet, because I know they are super busy opening their outposts. Has anyone any info./past experiences to share regarding this--thanks. Just hoping this does not scuttle our trip."

I imagine the only difference is you may need to be prepared to leave mid-trip due to changing weather conditions and fire threats. There are two fires near that camp right now, a smaller one is 5 miles to the NW a big one 11 miles to the south. Not sure which direction they are moving. Let's hope things are under control by the time you go.https://www.lioapplications.lrc.gov....ewer=FFIM.FFIMhttps://firesmoke.ca/forecasts/current/"
