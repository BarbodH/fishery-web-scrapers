Started in Quetico and ended up in Wabakimi due to the fires and closure of a large area of Quetico park. So, he should have plenty to write about."

6500308,Lazy Fisherman,2020-11-19 14:37:00,276,Mike Thanks for the great trip report. Always enjoy reading your reports. A couple years ago I think you were talking about a trip to Lake of the Woods. Did you make it there?

6500612,adempsey2.0,2020-11-20 22:28:00,611,"I was on that trip to Studd with Mike and have to say the Walleye fishing was amazing. It was a really enjoyable trip. Five lakes to fish, all accessible by water. Super fun. That was in September as well. Probably unbelievable earlier in the season. Uchi looks pretty crazy too. I think the differences would be the larger size of Uchi lake and being at a lodge versus fishing several smaller lakes and being the only cabin on the lake. I don't think you would be disappointed in either."

These trips are irreplaceable, and you present an amazing example of this. Hats off!Including my son is the best part of what I do, I've always said that. Something any dad can understand and relate to.Quote: Originally Posted by gordy28Really enjoyed that report Mike The tackle overview was great (I definitely don't take enough styles of lures for pike) and the maps highlighting wind direction etc was also a nice toughMust have been weird/awesome for you guys to be in a large camp as the only guestsCheers AndrewThanks Andrew, yeah it was equal parts weird and awesome, but definitely more awesome. Quote: Originally Posted by BigtaprootMike,As always, great report. How would you compare the fishing relative to Studd Lake? BigrootWay better at Uchi, but the lake is also way bigger so not much of a surprise. Studd was awesome though. Single cabin location and the fishing was nothing to sneeze at. Really depends what type of trip you're looking for if you're comparing the two.Quote: Originally Posted by Lazy FishermanMikeThanks for the great trip report. Always enjoy reading your reports. A couple years ago I think you were talking about a trip to Lake of the Woods. Did you make it there?Never did, and still want to badly. I was actually set to go 3 years ago, when roughly 1 month prior my personal life fell apart and there was no way I could go and had to cancel It's really taken until now to get things back on track.Quote: Originally Posted by EporterelmhurstThat is mike borger What is?Quote: Originally Posted by adempsey2.0I was on that trip to Studd with Mike and have to say the Walleye fishing was amazing.

6501212,4x4bassin,2020-11-23 15:45:00,17,Great report as always Mike. Looks like you guys had a great time and caught some nice fish and even lost a couple monsters as well. You guys did pretty good considering mother nature was not really cooperating that week. As I have been to Uchi several times I can vouch for the amazing fishery of both walleye and pike. Can't wait to go back......I will be putting a couple reports up here soon (not quite as good as Mikes)on my 2 trips to Uchi Lake Lodge in 2020

6587016,Bigtaproot,2021-08-05 12:33:00,900,"Mike, As always, great report. Mike is too modest to pitch his website which is full of valuable information. It is required reading for the old lady and me to dream beyond Branson"
6499696,Mike Borger,2020-11-17 06:37:00,1554,"For all of my friends Stateside who missed fishing in Canada this year and are suffering, maybe this will help ease the pain at least a little. My son Brendan and I visited Uchi Lake Lodge in northwestern Ontario in early September, and despite dealing with some pretty inclement weather the entire trip, we had a great time.Endless numbers of walleyes including a decent number of larger ones with the largest just a hair under 29"". Most caught jigging blade baits and plastic paddletails (no bait required), and a slightly larger class of fish on deep diving crankbaits.We tried hard for pike, and unlike early season when they're stacked in the back bays, at that time of year it's a trolling game. Largest was a fat beautifully spotted 40 incher, and beyond that there was a handful of fish in the high 30's. Both my son and I lost HUGE fish, and Brendan's especially will haunt both of us for a while.Under new ownership, the lodge itself is not 5 star, but it's clean and comfortable with very decent boats and is easily a cut above your typical single cabin outpost if you enjoy a few more amenities including having your meals provided for.For anyone interested here's the full story on our trip in detail, including 4 separate highlight reel videos with more than 85 minuted of footage combined.

6499770,IaDave14,2020-11-17 10:20:00,99,Thanks for the report I went there in the late 90's and found the fishing to be the same. Tons of walleyes and some larger ones-my largest was 27.5. Different owner back then and she was very strict about conservation only license might explain the fishing. I've always wanted to go back but a little too expensive for my fishing partners. The food was fantastic but I like to eat on my own schedule. Glad they are back and running again heard it was closed down for awhile.
6499806,Mike Borger,2020-11-17 12:21:00,1554,"It's ballpark for a full service American plan fly-in lodge, but I get what you're saying for sure. For the right person it's a great choice!Quote: Originally Posted by IaDave14Thanks for the report I went there in the late 90's and found the fishing to be the same.

Glad they are back and running again heard it was closed down for awhile.Sounds as though the fishing hasn't changed much, but then I don't think the lake has seen a whole lot of pressure over the last few years. The new owner seems like a pretty great guy, he's definitely trying hard to fix the place up"
6499808,RichA$1970,2020-11-17 12:21:00,1159,"I agree with Eck, looks good but their $$$$ is more than a lot of other resorts in the region. It would be good to see some Sunset Country reviews that are half the cost in the future."
6499934,Mike Borger,2020-11-17 22:02:00,1554,That's actually a great idea. If you or anyone else has some suggestions let me know!
6499942,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2020-11-18 00:23:00,240,"Would like to see a die-hard pike fisherman like yourself get on Cairns Lake, via Nestor Falls Fly-In Outposts. I have had my eye on that lake for quite awhile, but not many openings exist. I have fished Clear Lake, which is only about 5 minutes from Cairns, and have seen the cabin when we dropped off some fuel and other supplies en route to another lake. Have heard from guys who have fished 5 or 6 lakes in that locale that Cairns is a great lake for big pike. Goes without saying that the walleye fishing is very, very good on Cairns, too."
