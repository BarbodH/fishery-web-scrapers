6586872,Bigtaproot,2021-08-05 07:07:00,900,Do you guys have any secrets for getting satellite views of a fly in lake? I know about all the standard ones like Google bing fish Canada But was wondering if there are any websites out there that offer a detailed satellite images that I may not know about

6586926,MN_Moose,2021-08-05 09:10:00,964,"I also use Zoom Earthhttps://zoom.earth/#view=51.013662,-94.713137,13z"

I am assuming by ""fish Canada"" you meant Fish ON-line? I use the Ontario Map Viewer version. It is the same map as far as I know. Been really slow lately.https://www.lioapplications.lrc.gov....M&locale=en-CA"
