6583862,hoppy63,2021-07-27 19:00:00,367,I hope it is worked out.....but we will support their decision once we arrive
6583866,kzoofisher,2021-07-27 19:11:00,5144,"They've been waiting three years for a fair deal. Now they not only have a hurting tourism industry to help put pressure on Ottawa, they also have a US economy that doesn't need a big slowdown with its largest trading partner. Another shortage of car parts, lumber, aluminum and many other things will not be good. I bet the phone lines are buzzing between DC and Ottawa. Getting the US to open up to Canadians would help Trudeau save face for whatever deal he makes with the union. Won't take many days of trucks backed up to Hudson Bay to get some action."
6583912,IowaWalleye1978,2021-07-28 06:22:00,96,If agents strike our group will be staying at flag island. Assuming we can still fish Canadian waters even if the agents do go on strike.
6583916,Wallychowder,2021-07-28 06:54:00,1567,"""Strikes"" sure aren't what they used to be ! Someone took care of that !"
6586626,troutwater,2021-08-04 13:59:00,299,Looks like they set the strike date for Friday per the Wall Street Journal and Duluth News Tribune.
6586634,Hookhunter75,2021-08-04 14:12:00,60,This strike notice was given last week. It can be postponed if they agree to continue to negotiate in good faith. I work in a profession that union/employerNegotiations happen.
6586682,1/4 oz Jig,2021-08-04 16:56:00,90,This article says border agents won’t be collecting duty or taxes during the strike. This might make an agreement come fairly quickly. In the meantime bring plenty of duty free booze!!!https://www.yahoo.com/news/canadian-...201533632.html
6586756,phishfearme,2021-08-04 19:43:00,1242,"UGH! i guess i read this as a work slowdown. hopefully it will bring on an agreement. there's a few websites that show border crossing wait times - may be worth watching these in the days before you head up. thanks for the article, phish"
6583794,PeteyK,2021-07-27 16:04:00,7,"Since the American border will not open (maybe) for Canadians driving to the US until August 21st at the earliest, could we see the Canadian government move their date to late August? It would not surprise me. Canada has taken the Covid crisis much more serious than the US has. With the rising cases in the US and the uncertain future we may be in for a longer wait..."
6583800,Guest,2021-07-27 16:35:00,0,smart move by justin who really doesn't want the border open this year this strike will take the pressure off him while making the unions the bad guy brilliant
6583804,Da' Walleye Assassun,2021-07-27 17:03:00,358,"A spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency said 90% of personnel are classified as ""essential"" and will continue to work."
6583806,Guest,2021-07-27 17:06:00,0,yes on super slow mode
6583808,Hookhunter75,2021-07-27 17:14:00,60,Maybe slow but 90 percent is enough to keep it going.
6583818,Wawajake,2021-07-27 17:36:00,413,"Duties that are not essential would be collecting duties and taxes, providing information, providing guidance,” said Mark Webber, national president of the Customs and Immigration Union. “It could mean slow-downs at borders, it could mean slow downs for Canada Post parcels and courier, essentially any activity that doesn’t directly affect the safety and security of Canadians.”The members employed by the CBSA and Treasury Board began holding strike votes in June, after they had been without a contract for nearly three years and talks broke off between the two sides in December.https://bc.ctvnews.ca/you-ll-see-dis...s-strike-vote-"
6583844,reddemon2,2021-07-27 18:21:00,255,1. Border agents work in very slow mode and it's a slow entry 2. Border Agents don't give a Sh*t and it's a nice fast entry 3. Trudeau changes his mind and keeps it closed
6583848,Eckohlt,2021-07-27 18:38:00,3685,I'm all in for number 2
6583850,hoppy63,2021-07-27 18:38:00,367,"Being a union man, I agree. Just hope it gets settled quick."
6583856,djk50164,2021-07-27 18:51:00,370,If any of you are not able to cross the border because of this I hope you also agree with there decision to strike!
6583660,Wallychowder,2021-07-27 09:57:00,1567,Border agents vote to strike !
6583724,rosh1,2021-07-27 12:19:00,275,Might take 72 hours in line to get over border.
6583758,Prairieboy43,2021-07-27 13:37:00,38,Crazy stuff. Border been closed greater than a year. Now want guards shut er down via strike. Wow. Canada going downhill fast. https://www.justicenewsflash.com/202...720154282.html
6583766,Wawajake,2021-07-27 14:24:00,413,"Actually the 9000 Border and admin workers have been working without a contract for three years now, and negotiations have failed with Gov. after as much patience as they could muster. https://www.sootoday.com/local-news/...-aug-6-4165075"
6583776,Hookhunter75,2021-07-27 14:48:00,60,Does anyone feel or have concerns that as the tourism industry mobilizes that the rug could get pulled out? With the talk of strikes and cases rising in the US what will Canada’s government threshold be to pull the plug on a reopening?A lot of money is going to be spent by businesses to get ready and clients to prepare for their trip. Would the optics be worst to keep the border opening as is or stop it before it starts?
6583780,Eckohlt,2021-07-27 15:01:00,3685,"Can't close it forever,they gotta move forward and let'er eat."
6583786,walleyecheek,2021-07-27 15:40:00,2231,"If i was a bettin man ! (and i am) I would bet there going to delay the opening ! Forest fires, Border Strike, US cases surging. I hope I'm wrong !"
6583788,Hookhunter75,2021-07-27 15:49:00,60,I don’t disagree it’s a possibility but man would that be a financial crushing blow after they let the tourism industry movilize
6583790,kzoofisher,2021-07-27 15:49:00,5144,As far as negotiating leverage goes this is a great time to strike. Smart business move by the agents.
6583792,Hookhunter75,2021-07-27 15:55:00,60,I agree it’s a well planned move. I am hopeful that the political optics of saying you are going to loosen restrictions but then fail to seal a deal with the component most crucial in implementing your boarder opening would make them figure this out before the Cbsa goes to the line. I also think going back on your announcement looks worst than moving forward especially when you were quoted today in a press conference saying that fully vaccinated travelers pose a low risk
