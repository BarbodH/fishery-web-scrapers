Just happened to have moved our trip to next week after the 2nd year of denial. Just Dock and I as we are the most flexible but anticipating low water levels, smoky skies and hungry walleyes. Will share a report on our return. Also anticipating a September trip to Savant Lake with Wildewood. Go away Delta Variant! Fish On! Hooks"
