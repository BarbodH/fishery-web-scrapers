6582246,Hookhunter75,2021-07-23 08:11:00,60,Not fishing this year. I fly in every year and fish the Gouin. I am spending a month in BC hunting this year.
6582248,NARDA 1,2021-07-23 08:12:00,636,"Hopefully heading to Birch Dale Lodge on Eagle Lake 9/8/21,but have to recover from surgery first!"
6582260,C&K,2021-07-23 08:30:00,492,We're not. The time we like to go fishing in Canada is already past. Both wife and I already had corona so got a test called T-Detect from Adaptive Biotechnologies. It's an FDA approved test you can get if you've had corona that tells whether or not its safe to get vaccine. Wife is an RN and wanted the test before getting any drugs that are not FDA licensed. We can't get no corona vaccine due to the test results and having innate (natural) immunity to the virus. So we'll be staying stateside until they figure out a better system at the border than vaccine cards.
6582262,Sportdog,2021-07-23 08:31:00,6735,That hunting trip sounds awesome!!! Best of luck to you.
6582280,stjoeguy,2021-07-23 08:58:00,979,"Going to Root Bay on Lake St. Joseph with Slate Falls Outposts in August, Eagle Island on Lake St. Joseph with Slate Falls Outposts in September, and the Winoga cabin on Lake St. Joseph later in September. The first two are fly-ins. I usually bring my boat to the Winoga cabin but the lake level is so low this year that I'm thinking of using a camp boat instead. I've seen too much lower unit and prop damage when St. Joe was at normal lake levels. Guess what my favorite lake is!"
6582294,Bstar,2021-07-23 09:11:00,564,Flying in with Slate Falls Outposts 8/14-8/21 to their Arc Lake Outpost. They built a new cabin there in 2019 but it hasn't been used much since then. The lake has had very little fishing pressure for the last several years. Looking forward to it. Favorite lake is Miniss which is just north of Arc.

6582350,3M TA3,2021-07-23 11:54:00,2846,That's interesting. 3 of us got it here and all three of also also got vaccine. Must be a Wisconsin thing. Curious what test is performed to check for your innateness. Remember the name of it?

6582230,mwh624,2021-07-23 07:55:00,183,"Hopefully, but booked some other vacations and am running out of available time"
6582234,Pooch,2021-07-23 07:57:00,4618,"Ditto^^^ There is no way I could say ""favorite"" lake. Every lake I've fished had something about it that I really liked. Now I have several that I really enjoy fishing because the fishing is good, people are good and we catch fish. The two at the top of my list are both big water. One has numbers and the average walleye is 16 - 21 inches. The other has less numbers, but the average size walleye is 18 - 23 inches. Both have scattered 28-29 inch walleye and large Northern Pike if that what we are after. One has Lake Trout while the other does not. One has Small Mouth while the one with lake trout lake does not. One is man made (LS) while the other is a classic shield lake. Pooch"
