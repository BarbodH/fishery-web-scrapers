5093393,stabbert,2016-08-31 20:10:00,7,"Looking for recommendation in Ontario where we can target Walleye, Musky, Pike and Lake Trout all on the same like preferably without portage or pulling boats in and out of water every day. We have been to Lac Seul and are looking for something different. We bring our own boats and like the idea of a boat in outpost ideally to get a bit more remote and not stay at the main lodge of whatever camp."
