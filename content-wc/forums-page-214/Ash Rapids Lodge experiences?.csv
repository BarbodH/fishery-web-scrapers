I've had dinner there a couple of times. You can have the 5 star experience (there are a lot of wealthy Winnipegers who have cottages in the area), or you can have a more rustic experience, either way, the food is fantastic. You can go 10 minutes in 1 direction and see multiple $2m plus cottages, or 10 minutes in another direction and be the only one around for miles. Shoal lake to the west (connected) for pike and bass, Clearwater Bay area to the north for Lake Trout, and walleye pretty much everywhere. Enjoy."
