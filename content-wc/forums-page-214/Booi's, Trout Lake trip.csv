5087849,DaBirdman,2016-08-28 20:24:00,164,I got to looking a little harder at pics of their cabins. Are they all duplex cabins where you share a common wall with a different group on the other side? And for gas....you're allowed a maximum 6 gallons per boat per day? How far & how much exploring could 2-3 people per boat accomplish (including trolling most of the day)?
5088001,rzep,2016-08-29 05:29:00,1196,"Yes, most of them are sxs duplex. I was assured that noise and close proximity is not an issue. Since they cater to middle and upper end, I do not expect 6 guys drinking till 3am .... Boats have honda 25hp ...with two of us and maybe one down rigger,i think 6 gal will be enough per day..."
5088097,rzep,2016-08-29 06:32:00,1196,ZeeBee Do you recall if the boats have depth finder on them? ... is this another thing I should be planning on bringing ?
5089178,eyemike,2016-08-29 16:24:00,233,"Several of the cabins are Duplexes, but not all. Our cabin was very quiet, we did not hear the people on the other side at all. Email Jim and Tracy if you feel it would be an issue. They do not have depth finders in the boats, I took an old Eagle graph and alligator clipped to the starting battery for graph power, saved a little weight not having to haul in a battery. attach a transducer to a 2 foot 2x4 and c-clamp to back of transom. My wife and I did a lot of running around and a lot of trolling crank baits, not once did we even come close to running low on gas. You will be amazed at how far those motors will go on 6 gallons of gas. Again if it is a concern, talk to Jim and Tracy, They will bend over backwards to assist you with your trip."
5089186,eyemike,2016-08-29 16:36:00,233,"You can get portable downriggers at Cabala's for around $70. Also as far as gas is concerned, our boat had a 30 hp motor and not once were we low on gas at the end of the day. Fishing 8 to 12 hours a day."
5089202,rzep,2016-08-29 16:49:00,1196,"Thanks Mike . From echanges I had with Tracy, I felt privacy will not be an issue."
5084929,DaBirdman,2016-08-26 19:23:00,164,"Do the guides actually take you out & show you the spots? What if you want to do morning lakers, afternoon pike and evening walleyes? And do they rent out locators or do you have to bring your own?"
5084977,eyemike,2016-08-26 19:43:00,233,You follow the guide boat if you want to go with the guide. You take your own graph. you can use their outboard battery for power to the graph.
5084993,DaBirdman,2016-08-26 19:51:00,164,"Nice! I'll have to look into using my own locator. Two ways I could do it....one, bring my Marcum along that I use for ice fishing or....two, figure out some way to rig up my HDS7 but that would mean buying a number of parts & stuff"
5085849,zeebee,2016-08-27 11:10:00,1144,"You need a guide on Trout like a guy with 20/20 vision needs a white cane. On my 1st trip I asked Jim Booi where some spots were and he pointed to the lake and said ""out there"". We caught walleye off every point, along rocky shorelines and within 1 minute of camp.Lakers are concentrated in a couple of basins and we had one on every 10 minutes.As I mentioned earlier....1st trip. laker 33 lbs...biggest that year.2nd trip 47"" NP....biggest in camp that year too.Walleye....100's.There are many shorelunch spots around the lake. It is likely the best and easiest lake to fish you will encounter.Pay the guides on the side if you dont feel like filleting your catch.Im not a jig fisherman and all my walleye were caught on cranks. But for #s jigs of course produce up there.Lakers were all caught on Thompson platinum spoons in firetiger ...the largest size, think its 6"". You will catchLakers with heavy white jigs but for biggies, troll a big spoon.The Lake is hard to get lost on because its virtually a big bowl and Cat Island ...the massive island that sits directly across from Boois camp, serves as a landmark and can be seen from every place you are likely to fish.Dont need a map dont need a GPS...compass and away you go,. Very few rocks to worry about unless you take the 1 hr trip towards the NE section.My only recommendation is to bring portable depth sounders and downriggers."
5085977,rzep,2016-08-27 12:35:00,1196,Thanks for info Zee....sounds like my kind of place...not looking for challenges on my vacation. ..
5086017,zeebee,2016-08-27 13:01:00,1144,"I have no doubt you will really enjoy both the accommodations and the fishing.Been on over 20 fly ins and it has to rank as #1 overall. I had planned on being at Cat IslandLodge next week but, there was miscommunication about price/length of trip so Lac Suel instead.Need the kids to finish school and start payin their own way....sigh."
5086105,DaBirdman,2016-08-27 13:34:00,164,Great info Zee! Sounds like so much fun I wish we were leaving right now! Looks like it's really affordable as well. We got our trip narrowed down to either Hidden Bay or Booi's. Both seem excellent but Booi's is getting a little bit of the upper hand with the availability of trout in the lake.
5086481,AMPHIB206,2016-08-27 19:08:00,191,Here's Jim cleaning walleye with a machete. Nice work. https://youtu.be/kynEyqYh7OA
5086497,rzep,2016-08-27 19:13:00,1196,I do not have down rigger. Would using bottom bouncers -1 or 2 oz- work on trout in late July?
5086569,zeebee,2016-08-27 20:26:00,1144,"By late July they will be 70'+ down. Get 2 oz white jigs with large white tubes.If you want to troll do some research on Luhr Jensen Pink Lady and their variations. I dont have much experience with those so cant help.Portable down-riggers are not that expensive, under $200 and will last a lifetime. 8 lbs cannon ball if you are going 70' is fine.On one flyin I managed to forget the cannonball on the plane, filled a heavy sock with stones and it worked fine for the week."
5011041,tim.123,2016-07-22 08:50:00,13,"Was at Booi's on Trout Lake the first week of July. It was a great trip. Plenty of fish, no bugs. The average size of walleyes on this lake is hard to believe. We caught hundreds of walleyes in the 21-23 inch range. In order to get fish under 18 inches to eat, we had to move up into shallower water. There were fish aplenty at this depth also. Most of the people in the camp were fishing the shallow water bite. Constant action but smaller size. We fished 20-25 foot of water and the size went up. We didn't target pike but we caught a few. I was surprised we didn't get more. No big pike for us. One guy got one 46 inches while we were there. Later in the week we targeted Lake Trout. We caught plenty about 60 foot down in 90 feet of water. Again no huge ones but trout in the 6 to 10 Lb. range were not hard to come by. Swimbaits outperformed any other bait we fished by a wide margin. Same as last year on another lake. Booi's is a first class operation. Shore lunches, steak feed, everything was first class. My only reservation was we didn't catch any really big fish. I am sure they are there but we couldn't find them. Fished mostly structure next to the main basin with the wind blowing in. Great trip, Great lodge, great people."
5011337,dan cardinal,2016-07-22 10:54:00,64,Tim... glad you had a good trip. Sent you a PM.
5011449,Mike Borger,2016-07-22 11:54:00,1554,"Thanks for the recap, sounds great!"
5011689,LoDo,2016-07-22 13:19:00,721,"I've fished Boo's on Trout a few times years ago. Big Lake, with a ton of fish."
5080321,rzep,2016-08-24 15:23:00,1196,Thanks for the update ... I am looking at them for 2017 ... I am looking at late June/early August ... any months better than other ...? since I am going with wife I am trying to minizmize black flies/mosquitos issues ..
5080601,eyemike,2016-08-24 17:54:00,233,The only bugs that we encountered a Boois was spiders My wife always brings Raid House and Garden on our trips and we sure used it! We didn't encounter one fly or mosquito.
5080809,rzep,2016-08-24 19:22:00,1196,Mike What time of the year were you there?
5081825,zeebee,2016-08-25 08:12:00,1144,"The big fish are there. Been to Trout lake twice. First trip a 33 lbs Laker; 2nd trip 47"" NP.Take in a portable downrigger and large spoons as it will up your catch of large lakers significantly.Never fished a lake with so many 22-24"" eyes as the dominant size group. Its a big lake that would take a year to cover fully."
5082281,dan cardinal,2016-08-25 10:44:00,64,"Been there the first part of August 2012. Was a great trip. All the information provided here is spot on. No mosquitos at all. Sounds unlikely I know. But true... we encountered no mosquitos! We had a couple of dead calm, warm days... we had a few flies. But nothing serious. We noticed no spiders. No mice. Very well managed. Highly recommend this camp."
5082857,eyemike,2016-08-25 16:50:00,233,The second week of July.
