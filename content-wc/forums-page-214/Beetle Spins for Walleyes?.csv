I cast them along shorelines and weed edges. That is, I use Beetle Spins in a horizontal presentation with water depths being primarily 2-10 fow. I suspect the Beetle Spins will work in deeper water, that is, you will very likely catch some walleyes with them. However, I wonder if other presentations might be more effective. I am normally fishing the sides of rock humps or deeper points this time of the season. Vertical presentations would be my presentation of choice at this point in the season, rather than horizontal presentations. The Beetle Spins may work okay for you if you encounter walleyes on the tops of rock humps or along weed edges. In such situations, you can go horizontal for these fish (cast and retrieve). Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5089074,lawson2343,2016-08-29 14:47:00,459,"Thanks Born to Fish. I meant to ask how well they work in deep water in a mostly vertical fishing situation, rather than trolling/retrieving in a horizontal manner. I should have worded my original post better."
5089114,BornToFish,2016-08-29 15:20:00,1224,"Greetings again, I returned home a week ago from a two week trip north of Red Lake. We were getting many nice walleyes in 27-30 fow when fishing rock structure. We also had a nice bite going along weed edges just before dark. The weed edge in this particular lake is at about nine fow. The Beetle Spins might have worked well casted along the edge of these weeds - a classic horizontal presentation. However, I wouldn't use Beetle Spins on the sides of the rock humps. There, I was vertically jigging with minnows and doing very well, as I was keeping my jig/minnow in the strike zone at all times through proper boat control. I hope that you have a great trip. Show them no mercy! Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5090113,mt hook,2016-08-30 08:07:00,65,"I fish them from 2' to 30' just change to heaver jig to get it down. Cast and retrieve in a pumping motionkeeping it at the depth I want. Some times I jig them on a tight line.Just because a beetle spin is a bass/blue gill bait, doesn't mean you can't catch walleye on it.If a beetle spin is one of your go to baits then use it."
5090393,Bill Krejca,2016-08-30 10:02:00,6107,"They can work at any depth, heavier head for deeper water, if you like to cast, wait a while, and retrieve. Sort oi difficult, although not impossible for straight down vertical fishing. If vertical fishing deeper water, I'd not use the BS, would/should keep the bait moving to impart some type of action - the at rest stage probably not as attractive to the fish, just my opinion. I like to have my vertical baits remain sort of naturally positioned(and looking) when I stop them. Also, the non-moving bait can then give the fish a better look at the rather odd shaped conglomeration hanging there. That said, I did once catch a 29 incher vertically fishing with a power leach and overhead spinner. Bill"
