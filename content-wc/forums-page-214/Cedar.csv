5083545,prov1800,2016-08-26 05:40:00,5010,Fishing has been decent.walleyes started going deeper a few ago.at first fishing was fairly fast but then the bite slowed down. Nothing to panic about.happens every year.just need some patience.most boats were running and gunning all over.just burning fuel.i try to stay above 30 ft.and do quite well.lots of fish at 22-25'.lindy rigs will do best but shouldnt feed them any line. Just give them a couple of extra seconds and then set the hook.drop shotting works well also.pretty much need decent electronics.hace seen fish floating on both cedar and eagle.some fisherman going to deep and just killing fish.bringing them up slow isnt the solution.
