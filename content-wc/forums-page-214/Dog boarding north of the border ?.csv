No. 2 is the Dryden Canine Academy with the link: http://www.vegakennels.com/.Be sure to take the vaccination papers along. I hope you find a place."

5094210,v-bay gord,2016-09-01 12:57:00,3168,I take our dogs to the Second Chance Pet place http://www.secondchancepetnetwork.ca/ Nice people. Our dogs like going there. They are located just outside of Dryden......between Hwy 502 and the mill in Dryden.
5095042,rzep,2016-09-02 07:13:00,1196,Why would you take your dogs to a non kill shelter? They do boarding as well?
5095154,v-bay gord,2016-09-02 08:32:00,3168,"Yes, they board dogs. It helps them pay the bills running the shelter. Lot's of people board their dogs there...."
5095170,rzep,2016-09-02 08:39:00,1196,OK...no reports of people having theirs dogs adopted out by mistake?
5095202,v-bay gord,2016-09-02 08:54:00,3168,You should call and talk to Anne or Trevor. There are no concerns leaving a pet with them.
