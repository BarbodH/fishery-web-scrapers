5089857,dosxx,2016-08-30 05:54:00,60,We are considering a trip to Two Mile Outpost with OLO for a change of scenery next year. We went to Abamassagi the last two years with OLO and loved it but we like to switch up lakes every few years. Does anybody have any input on this lake and the outpost? It sounds like we can portage to a couple of lakes to fish.PM's welcome.Thanks!
