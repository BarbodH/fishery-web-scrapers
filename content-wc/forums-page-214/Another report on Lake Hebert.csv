Again the lake has deliver as promises.1st let me tell you about the road from Mt St-Michel to Parent; I never seen the road in such a good condition; good is not the word to use, it was excellent, it was like driving on a carpet Talking about road, our return was also very good maybe a little less nice but not by much. The flight in was more bumpy with high wind but those wind push-us to 145mph in the Cessna.As usually we were overload so Jean brought our over- weight the next day; this is what I call customer service at is best!Fishing was a little tough specially because of the rain and very high wind; luckily there is some excellent boat and motor that allowed us to be on the water. We manage to catch around 100 walleyes and three pikes; no size but a lot within the slot limit. Our best spot was one that wasn't identifed on the paper map that is supply by Air Tamarac but I found it on the Navionics map.One thing that is very good is the fact that we caught a lot of small walleyes so that is a good indication that the lake is doing very good.Looking forward to go back next year."

I picked up a nail in my tire in the town of Parent as indicated on my Honda pilots monitor. The last thing I wanted to do was stop and unload and put on the doughnut spare. So to avoid being covered by dust with every passing vehicle I drove on. Two and a half hours later we reached hard pavement and the first small town. I found a mechanic who fixed the tire, (almost on the rim) for ten bucks and we were on our way in fifteen minutes. Truly had an angel on my shoulder that day."

The road going in has been getting better every yr.Air Tam Continues to be the best outfitter in Quebec.I always book the next yr once I step off the plane, only 10 months to go"
