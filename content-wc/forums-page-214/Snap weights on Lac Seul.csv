In our experience when the walleyes are 25ft+ they want slow presention and by that I mean under 1.5mph, sure u can go that slow using cranks but the baits action is not at full potential, hence less bites. Baitwalkers and harnesses were much more effective. With the leadcore we caught more sauger and pike than walleyes. By all means, give it a shot. To some degree, I enjoy finding out what doesn't work as much as I enjoy finding out what does work"
