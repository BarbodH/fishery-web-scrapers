5096586,Mattymo,2016-09-03 15:37:00,16,I am going to Nestor falls for a few days the first week of October. We are going to muskie and walleye fish. I have been there a few times and fished only muskies. Any tips for walleyes that time of year? I have 2 first timers coming with me and would like them to have a good time. Thanks

My experiences on Canada Shield lakes during July, August and early September is that walleyes frequently hold in a fairly narrow range of depth of water. For example, I might find walleyes holding at 22-23 fow. In contrast, I find in mid-September and October that walleyes may hold in a much broader range of depth of water. For example, they might be holding at 20-30 fow. I believe there is normally a fairly broad gradient in water temperature as a function of depth during much of the summer. The temperature at the lake's surface might be in the low to mid 70 degrees F. and decrease to the mid 40s degrees F. at the lake's bottom. During such conditions, the walleyes will find their preferred water conditions (e.g. temperature, oxygen levels, food, light penetration, etc.) at a distinct depth of water (e.g. 22-23 fow). In contrast, the gradient in water temperatures for many lakes in mid-September through freeze-up is less pronounced. The lake's surface temperature might be 50 degrees F., whereas the temperature at the lake's bottom might still be in the 40s degree F.. Under such conditions, the walleyes have a much broader range in depth of water that has their ideal conditions. I might find them holding at 20 fow or 35 fow. Depth of water doesn't matter as much to walleyes now, as most of the water column is pretty much the same and good. I agree with Baseline's suggestions for places to look for walleyes. I'm suggesting that you might need to check out a broader range in depth of water than you might earlier in the season. The good thing about fall fishing is that the fish are often bunched up in big schools. If you can find one walleye, you likely have found all of them. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
