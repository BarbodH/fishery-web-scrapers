5088842,ziggyzag,2016-08-29 12:54:00,125,"Jim: We where there in June and I agree with you do not need minnows worms will work fine and we had 100 fish per boat any day you wanted to sit and catch them. Sorry can not help for this time of year but I am sure you will kill them, Good luck and post a report when you get back."
5089842,dosxx,2016-08-30 05:46:00,60,"We were there with a group of four the first week of August. We fished with artificial only and the fishing was excellent. We did not have any 100 fish days this year (we have in the past) but averaged 80 per two man boat per day.Most of the walleye were on 1/4 oz jigs with curly tails, paddle tails, and some straight tail worms. Trolling lipless crank baits (Bill Lewis Rattle Trap) was also successful especially if it got windy and it was tough to jig. We did not target pike but there are definitely some there. The biggest walleye was 25"" and the biggest pike was 35"". I hope you have an awesome trip!"
