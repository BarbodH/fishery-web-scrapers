5082977,HeHooksHimself,2016-08-25 17:52:00,725,It is actually a base for an outfitter that fishes numerous lakes. She usually has an empty cabin. There also is a more traditional motel. There have been times we had a room in the motel and a cabin. She kind of goes by how many people. Fish On! Hooks

5084577,JAY221,2016-08-26 15:51:00,877,"I believe this one is right in Ear Falls on the west side of the highway. Later, Jay"
5084809,pattmit,2016-08-26 18:15:00,36,We have stayed at a place called Trillium Motel in ear falls before but haven't heard of this other place. Sounds like our group found a place. Thanks for the help

5088962,Guest,2016-08-29 13:44:00,0,"let's see, you don't answer your phone and you over charge for a room that you can hear your neighbor fart in, OH YEAH, I've got a room for YOU! Pine Grove will do you right...."

5078865,Pat T,2016-08-23 20:26:00,221,"Would appreciate any suggestions for motels in Vermillion Bay. I am aware that there are a couple, just hoping someone could offer some help in choosing. Just saying one night only. Thanks, Pat T"
5078953,v-bay gord,2016-08-23 20:55:00,3168,North Side Motel seems to be popular.........
5079553,Guest,2016-08-24 08:11:00,0,"couple years back I was looking at a piece of property outside Vermilion Bay, the first night I stayed with a friend who is a local ( lives on 105) the 2nd night I wanted a motel, since I was returning to the states and leaving at 4 in the morning, my buddy called the northsde and was quoted 59 dollars for the night, when I got there a couple of hours later the blonde owner charged me 79 dollars, after she saw I was from the states, She gave me the American discount!!!!! This was in Oct. and the place was dead, I don't do business (any) in Vermilion Bay anymore, Dryden is right down the road!!!!"

5080505,NARDA 1,2016-08-24 17:20:00,636,+1 Northside Motel 807-227-5339 owners name is Cindy (she bought the Motel a couple years ago).
5080769,Pat T,2016-08-24 19:10:00,221,"I just called up there. We wouldnt have a problem paying $79, but was told it would be $109 which includes tax. Pretty steep for mid Sept if you ask me."
5081553,HeHooksHimself,2016-08-25 06:49:00,725,We often stay at Pine Grove. Gail holds it to about $35/guy. We usually have our own cabin. The trains are our alarm clock! Hooks
5081617,v-bay gord,2016-08-25 07:05:00,3168,That's about $80 US.
5081761,Pat T,2016-08-25 07:52:00,221,I guess $80 would be fair. Didnt realize the exchange rate was that good. Might be worth another call up there to double-check. Regarding Pine Grove are you suggesting that these are small cabins as opposed to a motel?
