4415657,Shellback,2016-01-01 09:34:00,8083,I guess I'm about 5 months away from my first trip to Canada. I usually leave the Weds after Memorial Day for 2 weeks. Then I'm back a couple days after Labor Day for another 2 weeks. Last year I got in another week in late July. This year I'm thinking of trying to get a full 10 days in July. I already have 10 days reserved in April for crappie fishing in VA. Then back to VA in Oct. Hoping the wife's and my health allow us to make the trips. My buddy usually spends 3 months in FL for the winter. Just slipped on a wet ramp and tore the muscles and tendons off his knee. Looks like he will be rehabbing the next 3 months instead. Sucks getting old!
