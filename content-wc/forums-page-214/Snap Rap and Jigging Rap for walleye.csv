5093874,pattmit,2016-09-01 09:02:00,36,I've watched a bunch of videos and read some articles on this method of fishing. Curious if anyone has any feedback for this tactic. Pros/Cons? Stories? Headed to NW Ontario in a few weeks and might try fishing this way a day or 2. Thanks

Unlike your standard jig presentation where they typically hit on the drop, with the rap they hit on the rip up. Takes some getting used to. You have constant pressure on your jigging arm. Back home my arm hurt for two weeks from the constant jigging. No kidding. But fun it was."
