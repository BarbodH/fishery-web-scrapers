I simply use my US issued credit card, as it is accepted everywhere that I spend money in Canada. The exchange rate from the credit card company is competitive, while the transaction fee is minimal. I advise to the issuing financial institution that I will be traveling out of the country, such that my transactions are not rejected. Using my credit card is simple and works well for me and my wife. The flipside is that we don't get dinged transferring unspent Canada funds into US currency, nor do we have to hold unspent Canada currency until the next year. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

I use my credit card wherever I can, but I've been to lots of places in Ontario that won't take a card. These are usually mom and pop bait shops and rural restaurants. You really get zinged on the US exchange at these businesses and they give you Canadian change. I always have a hundred or so of Canadian when I travel there. I take several trips a year so conversion to US isn't a problem for me."
