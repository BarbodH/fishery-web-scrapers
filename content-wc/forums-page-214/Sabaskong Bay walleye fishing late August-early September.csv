5082777,Roger B MN,2016-08-25 15:55:00,332,"I'm taking my usual Sabaskong Bay trip much later than usual this year, going next week. Any tips on where/what kind of structure I can find some decent walleye fishing in Sab this time of year? Staying at Split Rock lodge towards Nestor Falls, usually fish muskies from Nestor east to Horseshoe/Raspberry Islands area in the west. I plan on spending more time fishing walleyes this year however. Thanks in advance!"

5083593,1700SS,2016-08-26 06:20:00,104,Probably still a little early for them to move into any neck down area's. Neck down between Blueberry and Cedar you might want to check. I would try humps and points. Right on the drop off or a little ways out. Minnesota Guy where you staying? I will be up that week also. I am staying at Red Wing Lodge out of Morson.Brett

PjShorthorn."
5083977,1700SS,2016-08-26 08:34:00,104,"I will let her know. I believe I did hear a few stories about you guys when I was up there in July. All good of course! I never did get over to turtle to check out the sign you guys put up, put I will have to next month."
5084697,Bill Krejca,2016-08-26 16:46:00,6107,"Yeah, curious minds want to know the status of the sign. (Good luck on the trip!) Also, for some reason, the song ""Waltzing Matilda"" comes to mind!! Bill"
5084841,BreezyPoint,2016-08-26 18:34:00,1581,"When I went back up, the tree the sign was hung on was down and the sign was gone. Sorry about that, I went up to Turtle Portage to firmly anchor the sign and that is what I found.Frank"
