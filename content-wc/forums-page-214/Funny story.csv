Wearing a life jacket in the cabin and not taking it off till back in the cabin. Wears bear bells so the bear will hear him .....etc So he is in the front of the boat fishing, his partner takes a 7 inch spoon and removes the treble hook. His partner starts dangling the lure near the guys head and face while casting. After about 3 minutes of this the front fisherman says ""hey your hooks are getting close to me"" The back fisherman states he is sorry. He then drops the spoon down the back of the guys shirt and lets her rip, Front guy goes crazy and starts throwing everything in the boat at the back guy, Back gut laughs so hard he pooped himself. Watching this from 50 yards away was hysterical. They had to run to the cabin so the back guy can change clothes. As they are on the dock the front guy falls off the and into the water. Anyways us 60 year old guys also had to run to the cabin, dam butter flavored Crisco."

We all get done eating our lunch and relaxing a little bit and my brother decides he has to go make a deposit in the woods. So off he goes toilet paper in hand. If you knew my brother you would know that he never takes too long to do anything. So after about 10-15 minutes somebody makes a comment about how long he's been in the woods. All of a sudden here he comes out of the woods with no shirt on and he runs right to the lake and starts washing his shirt! We ask him what happened and he says ""Well, I found the perfect deadfall that I could use to do my business and there was a nice tree right in front of it that I could hold onto while I was busy. So I got comfortable with my butt over the deadfall and I was holding onto that tree and I was about done when that tree I was holding onto decided to break!"" He said the tree was a good 2-3"" in diameter. At this point we are all laughing our butts off. So evidently when the tree broke he fell backwards right into what he had just deposited getting his shirt and his bare butt full of you know what. So when he came out of the woods he went right to the lake to wash his shirt. I'm sure glad I didn't have to fish with him that afternoon!"

5088089,jfaisten,2016-08-29 06:30:00,1060,I love bear bells. The story goes that the local sporting goods store owners go out in the woods and look for bear crap so they can replenish their supply of bear bells.
