521658,TECK,2002-06-21 08:41:00,151,I think ever one won that trip. I know I did. Read the small print
521659,fishmaster,2002-06-21 13:49:00,209,I WON the same trip at the Green Bay sport show this year along with everyone else i know.All they do is purchase your name.Like one said read the fine print as we talked about it one night at camp while having a few beers there is a hitch and the deal is more than most camps charge for a weeks stay.I would tell you not to BITE on this one as i am sure most all who read this and have been to the shows this past winter.Good luck on your decision!!!!!Keep on fishingfishmaster
521660,sdyer,2002-06-25 17:46:00,34,I have heard about this scam but don't understand it. What are they trying to pull? Please advise. ThanksDuffy
521661,BD,2002-06-25 23:00:00,739,"If the trip is worth $300 and they charge $300, no complaints.If the trip is worth $300 and they charge your buddy $600 and you nothing ($300 per head) only the buddy who has paid for your trip has a right to complain.If the trip is worth $300 and they charge three of your buddies $500 and you nothing ($300 per head plus an extra $300) you have three buddies who BESIDES paying for your trip have been charged an extra $100 each.Naughty Pines has these same ""give aways"" every year. If the trip there was worth it they could count on repeat business and word of mouth instead of gimmicks and ripoffs.""Angling: incessant expectation, and perpetual disappointment."" --- Arthur Young (circa 1787)"
