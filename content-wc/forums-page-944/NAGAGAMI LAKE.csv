521831,TQO,2002-06-25 21:02:00,10,My company represented an outfitter on this lake and I had the chance to fish it on an inspection trip. We did not have good fishing at all compared to other lakes that we have fished. I have since befriended another couple who has a lodge on the lake and they insist there are loads of walleye in the lake. We didn't see it and nobody else in the camp did.All the accommodations were great from what we saw of the 3 or 4 lodges on the lake. What outfitter are you looking at?We caught about 10 hammer handle pike per day and I honestly only caught about 5 walleye out of Nagagami. Now there is a little catch and realease lake called Hiawatha about a 1 mile walk through the woods that was awesome walleye action. Caught about 100 the 1 day we went over there. Should have fished over there every day.We send most of our people to lodge out of White River now. 60 miles closer and better fishing and you can take the train in if you want to save some $.Have a good tripTQO[email protected]
