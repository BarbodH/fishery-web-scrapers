521818,Guest,2002-06-24 14:24:00,0,"Just thought I would lighten the weather thoughts alittle from what everyone is reading and watching the weather channel.We were up for a week of fishing with east wind for 5 straight days 10 to 30 mph, clouds, rain, fronts coming and changing all the time. Had one summer, sunny day the end of the week.For two guys in a weeks fishing we caught 20 Pike over 30 inches biggest being 43 inches, hundreds of walleyes in the 17 to 22 inch range biggest being something around 25 inches, and lots of lake trout from 2 to 5 lbs with weather I would have rather read about. But wouldn't have missed the fishing! Several days it was hand to fin combat, by that we use the two man rule, (who doesn't have a fish on takes the fish off the hook for the other guy), limits the possible mistakes we have all had, so the trick is to have another one on and coming to the boat so your partner is taking off YOUR fish and not the other way around !!! We had times the action was so fast we lost count of the doubles much less anything else, for a hour at a time!!! Just kept the rod bent and the pliers working. Try it sometime. Twice during the week in the evening the trout action was every cast from 8 to 10:30 pm. You had to stop to get a drink and catch your breath. In the rain!!!So for all of you about to make the trip enjoy Canada its a great place !!!!"

We fished the same lake (setting net) one day and came up to him as he was fighting a trophy pike. I did not catch as many fish as he did but i fish differntly than he does. I cast big metal all day for trophy pike and take short brakes to catch eyes or trout for lunch. I did manage to catch between me and my buddy about 35 pike over 37 inches with 7 over 40 inches and the largest was 44"". Some kid from kentucky caught a 49"" 31lb pike on favourable lake while we were there. The kid was 16 YEARS YOUNG AND CAUGHT it ON 6 LB TEST IN THE MOUTH OF ONE OF the many creeks that come into Favourable lake. Between my group of 10 we managed about 80 pike over 37"" in 6 days of fishing when added to hoosiers total over 100 big pike were caught. The big pike were very aggressive and where in the flat shallow bays and in the many reed beds in the mouths of the rivers. The walleye fishing on three of the five lakes was hotter than #####!!! We had lunch for 10 guys in 15 minutes each day. South trout lake produced two walleys for my group that measured 27"" and 28.5 inches. I will e-mail you (hoosier) the pics as soon as I figure out to work my digital camera. I am deciding between June 1st or June 6th for next year. I am already counting the days. Are you going back (probally a dumb question) and if so when? Hopefully the same week as me I enjoyed your company. Bob is getting many repeaters that are booking before they leave so don't wait if you want early season. The best thing about the these fish is that THEY ARE STILL SWIMING IN THE WATER as the lodge is catch and release only except for lunch of course."
