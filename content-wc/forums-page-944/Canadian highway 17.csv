521788,Rocky,2002-06-24 11:38:00,5,Does anyone know anything about highway 17 from Sault St. Marie to Dryden Ontario? Good or bad road? Any construction or other delays? speed limit? Also what would a gallon of gas in Ontario equal in U.S funds? Thanks in advance
521789,retire55,2002-06-24 12:17:00,1029,"Rocky:The price of gasoline in Canada depends upon how far you get away from civilization.Todays conversion rate from US to Cdn (1 $ US equates to 1.523 $ Cdn).Todays price/litre (Ontario) for regular unleaded of 62 cents Cdn.4.546 litres equals 1 Cdn gallonTherefore, 1 Cdn gallon sells for $2.82 CdnTherefore, 1 Cdn gallon would sell for $1.85 US. Since a Cdn gallon is 20% more than an American gallon, the comparable price in US gallons is $1.48 US. Hope that helps. Jay"

The gas prices I paid were around 0.85 Canadian dollars per liter. The way I do the math says you multiply by 3.79 liters per US gallon and multiply by the Canada to US rate of 0.64 and it comes out to the equivalent of $2.06 per gallon. By the way, the fishing in the Ignace area was absolutely fantastic the week of 6-17-02."
