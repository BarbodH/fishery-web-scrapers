How about Gunn lake at that time? I've stayed at Big North Lodge - nice place - but didn't know Gunn lake so went up to Sand and Little Sand.

That time of year almost all your fishing will be up in big and little sand. Just to name a few the beach, petes point, burnt all over. The big northerns are starting to move back in at that time also. Drop me a line [email protected]"
521880,Guest,2002-06-26 00:47:00,0,"iamwalleye, I agree that Big North Lodge is a wonderful place and Pat and Alex are great hosts. My dad, 2 brothers and I have been going there every year for the past 10 years. We are going again this coming week. We have spent most of our time fishing around the Throat and myrtle areas and have had great fishing for northerns and smallmouth and always caught enough walleye for a couple of meals during our stay. This year we would like to venture up to big and little sand and possibly roughrock lake. We are looking mainly for northerns, musky and smallmouth and would appreciate any advice you could give. Thanks in advance! Docnorthern [email protected]"
