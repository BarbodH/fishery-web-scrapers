In past years we have had great perch fishing both summer and ice fishing. Last Christmas while ice fishing, we saw some commercial fisherman near where we usually catch perch in the summer. They were catching both perch and walleye in their nets. So obviously, the walleye are there yet we have never really caught them during the summer and only rarely in the winter. Mostly we fish with a jig tipped with a minnow head for the perch. Anybody have any tips as to how to fish for the walleye that I presume are still there? Anybody have any reasons why we can't catch the walleye?Not that I mind the perch they are great tasting. It would just be nice to get a little variety.ThanksDoug"
