Its strictly a fly-in lodge supposedly and was wondering if anyone here has any knowledge or better yet, actually been there recently. Thanks in advance. Dave"

It is basically a big, deep basin that contains some lake trout, walleye, and northerns. I did not stay at the lodge, but rather at a more strategically located camp towards the middle portion of the lake. Supposedly, the best fishing is in the river, but there is one rock shoal that attracts walleyes. No trouble finding it because it is marked by a milk jug. Some of the walleyes there are blue in color, and very tasty."
