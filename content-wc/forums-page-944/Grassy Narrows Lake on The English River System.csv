521640,Guest,2002-06-20 13:52:00,0,"I was wondering if anyone had information on Grassy Narrows lake. I'm looking for a good lake map of the area, as well as some good places to try. I am going up there the first week in july. I've never been there before so it should be quite the adventure. If anyone has a good map or knows where I can get one I would really appreciate it. Also if anyone has been up there recently I would love to hear how you did. Thanks"
