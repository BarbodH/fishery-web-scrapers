521731,Guest,2002-06-24 20:13:00,0,"just returned Saturday the 22nd, after fishing for a week.... the BUGS win....they bit better than the fish. We stayed at Miwapene camp ( very very nice) and made the trips to pickerel bay ,sunny side and an out-post camp of miwapene about 2 miles north of sunny side.the first three days we had light rain and a high of 9*c, burned wood every day to keep warm. The next three days it warmed up to 27*c and we sweet our butts off. The owner said it was the longest stable weather they had yet this year.we used jigging spoons in 20 feet of water with some success for very short times each day (9:00 pm - 9:30pm )the other boat fished shallow (4 feet)trolling worm harnesses with split shot in the heat of the day (11:00am - 2:00pm) Friday they boated 9 and kept four fish, two almost 2 lbs. A lot of fish suspended and would not touch anything I threw at them.You might as well go back to camp when you don't see fish on the bottom with your depth finder. better luck and tight lines, POOK417"
