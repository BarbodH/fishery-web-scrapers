521619,Guest,2002-06-20 05:33:00,0,I am booked with Gardiner Outfitters for the first week in July and I am concerned by some of the previous posts about Ron being extremely difficult to deal with and the equipment and cabins being ancient. On the other hand several posts have been favourable. I am excited about the trip but worried about what my turn out to be a dud holiday. Anyone with any experience on these lakes able to give me the real story? Thanks in advance boys.Chromer
521620,Guest,2002-06-20 16:24:00,0,"Chromer- the REAL story on Ron is----He is a total jerk!!! We (6 of us) flew into Echo Lake about 5 years or so ago. He is a very rude man and his wife Shirley is a saint to live and put up with his #####!! A quick story- 2 of us arrived at his place a few hours earlier than our other guys. He made us unload our truck which carried all the food and gear for 6 guys into his old truck to drive down to the dock to have all weighed!!! I said why unload this stuff twice, why can!t we drive our truck down and unload it on the dock to be weighed--- NO way he said, my rules!!! He said we were over weight before we even put anything on the scales. He was correct and he charged us $120 BOTH ways!! You figure that one out. At the end of the trip we questioned him and he shut the door in our face.The place we satyed at was a run down A frame with holes all over the place which were plugged to keep out the bugs with pieces of insulation.When we got there he told us we had to remove our boots and shoes or stay out. The boats were ancient and the motors even worse.Heres how he checked his motors-- when we got there all the motors were hanging on a board between 2 trees. He dry started all of them shifted each to show all were running.All the props were recently freshly painted and he said if any of the paint was off the blades, we were resposible. From the remarks on the undersides of all the bunks and ceiling, all the others thought he was a jerk too! When we were ready to leave he started each motor again dry and said they were OK.Whe n we got back to the dock, his wife was tying up the plane and we wanted a picture of all of us and asked her if she would take it for us. As she was getting ready to take the picture, he started hollering like an idiot to her to come over to the plane and help her do something.Evidently she wasn!t fast enough as he threw a can of oil at her and hit her in the back of the neck!!! I asked him if that was really necessary, he never even looked up at me!! A total #####. At the Hamburg NY show his booth was across from a friends of mines, his wife said he never had a single person actually book and confirm a trip the entire time she was there and she said he never smiled once---Yes thats ##### Ron. When we got home we wrote the Cochrane, Ontario Chamber of Commerce a complaint letter. We got a response about a month later. They said we were not the only customers who were treated in this manner and sugested no one else book with him again-- Guess what-- WE haven!t and never will. Good luck to you,hope he has mellowed but I wouldn!t put any $$ on it.Too many other reputable outfitters who appreciate your business in Ontario to give any money to this jerk!!"
521621,phishfearme,2002-06-21 07:30:00,1242,"cromer - my group was at partridge/kesagami last july. i have to agree with samson in many ways. we go to different lakes with different outfitters every year and this guy is the worst by far. wait until you see the old 12ft boats and ancient motors you'll have on partridge. wait until you read all the rules regulations and fines that he has posted up on the walls. wait until you see the thick plastic covers on all the beds that are there to make those cheap foam mattresses last forever but will not allow you to sleep comfortably. as a matter of fact, everything he does is oriented around making his junk last as long as possible and ##### your comfort. the fishing on partridge is poor at best and it takes forever to get to kesagami - but the boats and motors on kesagami are fine. when we were there there was a very stiff wind outta the west which prevented us from exiting the dock with his garbage motors. i could go on and on.bottom line - we'd never rebook with him and all of us are warning our friends.good luck and i hope you can enjoy yourself as much as possible.phishp.s there's some spring seep pits right behind the boat storage area on kesagami which make great coolers for beer/pop."
521622,phishfearme,2002-06-21 07:42:00,1242,"cromer - forgot to offer you some marked up maps of kesagami lake with where we did good. contact me if you wish: [email protected].note also that you'll see a continuous stream of freighter canoes from the kesagami lodge hitting the bouyed spots over and over again. these spots are the only real structure/features in the lake as it's the flattest, shallowest, muddiest, most featureless lake i've ever seen. we had to give it a try and did have pretty good fishing but i really prefer the shield lake much, much more. these james bay lowland lakes just aren't as interesting.phish"
521623,Guest,2002-06-24 05:29:00,0,OK now I am officially worried. He hit his wife in the back of the head with a can of oil? What the ##### is that? Thanks for responses guys.Chromer
521624,Guest,2002-06-24 15:19:00,0,"Chromer- yes, that is no lie- he was so impatient in what he was waiting to do to the airplane he actually hollered "" Shirley, get over here NOW!!"" She had a camera in her hand and just after taking our pictures, here comes a can of oil and YES it did hit her in the back of the neck. Story has lots more crap he pulled but I think ( or hope ) you got the message on him. Whatever, have a good trip. As for Kesagami- all the other posts have been true. Our friends just got back and at times there were 8-12 boats fishing over a hole. Heck, I could do that here in NY!!"
