521701,Guest,2002-06-22 08:11:00,0,"Pathfinder,I just got back from Coppens Resort on Thursday. The lake is up 2-3 feet and the color of chocoalte milk because of all the rain. They have the railroad bridge drawn up so boat traffic can get under the bridge. Our camp owner said that the lake will continue to rise for a while. This was our first time fishing Rainy so I am not able to tell you whether we had a good fishing trip or not. We averaged about 10-15 bass (2 over 20""), 10-15 walleyes and a bunch of ""hammer handles"" a day. We had our best luck at Little Grassy Lake on the east end of Seine. We went to Porters Inlet twice and didn't do very well. There were a couple of groups who went to the north end of Red Gut and said that the water clarity was bad all the way.Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but the fishing might be tough.Renn"
521702,Guest,2002-06-24 06:35:00,0,Thanks Renn. Lets hope they have no more rain and the water clears.
521703,Guest,2002-06-24 11:54:00,0,I'm heading up to Taylors Cove on Sunday. Ed has told me that his fuel pumps were under water. Did Coppens have gas? Did you guys get over to Black Sturgeon? I was wondering if Black Sturgeon was muddy. Were you fishing live bait for Walleyes or getting them while cranking for smallies? TGG
521704,Guest,2002-06-25 06:04:00,0,"TGG,When we left Ed's fish cleaning house had water on the entire floor. He was pretty nervous. Another 3-4 inches would put water into the two large freezers he had in there.We did not make it to Black Sturgen. We got to Coppens on the 15th and went up to Porters on the 16th in the morning and the water was so muddy throughout Red Gut we didn't go back up there until 19th and it was still muddy. We did manage to find clearer water in the bays on the north shore of Swell. Blind bay was very clear but did raise anything there.We caught most of our walleyes on crankbaits. Rattling Raps, Rapalas, and Shad Raps. A few on Tube Baits and even a few on spinner baits!! We didn't really fish very hard for walleyes. Good Luck and have a good time!!!Renn"
