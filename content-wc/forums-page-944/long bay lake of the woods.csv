You can fish Long Bay, Yellow Girl Bay, the Sunset Channel etc. Take your cabin along with you (the houseboat), tow your fishing boats behind, tie the cabin up to an island, and go fishing. Our group has been houseboating here for 15 years. http://www.lowhouseboats.com"

The run to Yellow Girl Bay and surrounding areas is not that long from their resort. We're headihg there this Thur. and can't wait.Tight lines. Phone 800-465 1091 Gill"
521593,Guest,2002-06-26 11:13:00,0,My vote goes to the Tomahawk Resort as well....... no finer accomodations and no better people to deal with . Stay there 5 - 6 times per year and won't stay any other place.
