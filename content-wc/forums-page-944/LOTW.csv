Did the big storm from two weeks ago have a major effect on the waters up that far? Have fished there the last 2 years and have done really well, but it never hurts to check on current conditions. Thanks in advance, Gill"

Caught fish in 11 feet on Wednesday the 19th and on Thursday they were in 15 to 16 the friday 19 to 22 feet. Fishing should be very good.
