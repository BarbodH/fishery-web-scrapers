521770,Guest,2002-06-25 18:57:00,0,Just returned from a week long trip to Rice Lake on June 15th. The water level seems pretty much normal. The walleye fishing was not great possibly due to the abundance of spawning panfish. My wife and I do not fish as hard as we did 30 years ago. We stay at Plank Rd cottages on south shore at Gores Landing. Bluegill and crappie fishing was excellent. Hope this helps.
