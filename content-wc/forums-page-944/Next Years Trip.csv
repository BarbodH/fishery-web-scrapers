Was completlely UNDER impressed with the lodge, but I guess the fishing was good enough to overlook a few things.I am already looking forward to next years trip, I'm begining to check out lodges and I was wanting some input from y'all...Looking to spend a little more money next year and do the ""outpost"" thing.Looking at Anderson's outposts (Tuktegweik, Kakebeka/Pickerel Narrow's and Tom's landing) and Lac Seul outfitters/Ojibwa out fitters at Chamberlain Narrows.It looks like they are all within 10 miles of each other's.Need some input... please help."

Others on here would like to know.A drive-in (the last 13 miles take about an hour) with excellant fishing is Press Lake Camp. There are housekeeping cabins and campsites only, no lodge. www.presslake.on.ca Another option is houseboating. Our group has been using Lake of the Woods Houseboats for 15 yrs. www.lowhouseboats.com Search the archives in the general discussion, Canada, and fishing reports for Press Lake and for the favorite resort threads. That will give you some ideas.""Angling: incessant expectation, and perpetual disappointment."" --- Arthur Young (circa 1787)"
