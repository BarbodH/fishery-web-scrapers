1496217,Footdoc55,2012-10-16 21:20:00,275,"I have been to God's Lake 5 times. 4 times I have stayed at God's River Lodge and once I stayed at Elk Island Lodge. Elk Island Lodge is in the middle of the lake and you have to travel far all the time to get to the better fishing spots. God's River Lodge is right at the mouth of the river and has a lot more opportunities for good fishing. When at God's River Lodge, we did travel far at times to the graveyard area and to bays that held huge northerns. We always go the last week of May. Some years, there was still significant ice present. One day, in the grave yard, my son caught 4 walleyes, each in excess of 10 pounds throwing a point crank bait from Lucky Craft. We did one day at Siemon's lake, which is a flyin from God's and we caught several northerns at or over 45"" on plastics and traditional lures. They do not protect their tributaries in the spring and while at Siemon's, we would motor up these tributaries and see these ""logs"" just laying there. These big northerns were a bit lethargic until about 11 AM and as it warmed up, so did the fishing. They absolutely destroyed plastics. As far as brookies, we would float or drift down the river and use orange jointed rapalas, I believe #8's and they would slam them in current. They averaged 20"" and we caught several ""Master Anglers"". In talking with a local, he told me brookies loved bacon and encouraged me to take a strip of cooked bacon from breakfast and put a small amount on a jig and drift it through the rapids. I never tried it but I think it would work. God's River Lodge is a good place with access to great fishing, decent food, decent accomodations, good boats and decent guides. I plan to go there every year or every other year the rest of my days. Enjoy"

1495411,Mike Borger,2012-10-14 10:00:00,1554,"Hey guys there's been a little bit of chatter on the board about Gods lake in northern Manitoba, but not much.Has anyone been there? If so I'd love to hear from you.I'm researching a possible trip there in 2013 and there's at least 3 lodges on the lake to choose from.Would love to hear from anyone who's been and any opinions on the best tome of the year for big pike and lakers and brook trout and what one can realistically expect.Alternatively if anyone can recommend a REALLY good outpost camp for large numbers of big northerns in Manitoba I'd love to hear about it.Trying to plan the trip of a lifetime. Cheers"
1495416,LeeMB,2012-10-14 10:33:00,83,I spent 6 years guiding on Gods recently. PM me your specific questions.

1495843,adempsey,2012-10-15 17:40:00,963,"Already done with Ontario are ya!?!??!? Don't know much about the Gods River/Lake, but I had this video bookmarked so thought I would link it for you.Good luck!"
1495853,Mike Borger,2012-10-15 18:14:00,1554,"Thanks bud. I watched that one already while sifting through the net.Not done with Ontario. I have a close friend who I've known since we were 8 years old, so almost 40 years now.He's been really sick for 3 years now and is just now miraculously getting better, although he still has two operations slated for Jan and Apr of 2013.We talked recently and he asked if we could go fishing together somewhere special next year, assuming he's able to. He's always been a huge brook trout nut and likes big pike as well so the Gods seems to be a natural.Looking at anything interesting though. Possibly char in the Ungava region or maybe even the Alagnak river in Alaska.This is a once in a lifetime trip for him."
1495909,zeebee,2012-10-15 20:34:00,1144,good read...http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...=brookies&st=0
1495914,grizzley,2012-10-15 20:45:00,2518,"Never been there, but saw a program on it many yrs. ago.If it's anything like that program you'll be !The pike and brook trout they were catching were awsome.I was tempted to head there after watching that show, but never made it.That could have all changed by now.????"
1496047,adempsey,2012-10-16 12:15:00,963,"Hopefully all goes well for him next year. It's great to be able to offer something like this for an old friend. I was watching some videos from the ""New Fly Fisher"" on Labrador and Newfoundland. Some places looked incredible. Might be worth considering.http://www.youtube.com/user/thenewfl.../videos?view=0Fortress Lake in BC looks stunning too. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAy2ounYpFs&feature=plcphttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qWxrUbStIM&feature=plcphttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgMk3...e=results_mainhttp://www.flyfishalberta.com/fortresslake/On one of my fishing trips we me a large group of guys that said a lot of great things about Hawk Lake Lodge in Ontario. Not sure if they have brook trout fishing, but they have many lakes to fish and food/service is supposed to be outstanding. I also noticed it's an Orvis Endorsed fly fishing expedition. The Orvis site has some interesting places as well.Maybe go for some Sheefish in Alaska? Heh. That would probably be a once in a lifetime fish to catch! There are a lot of really amazing places to go to in Alaska. They would definitely be a trip of a lifetime for me - char, grayling, salmon, trout, pike - yes please!! Tikchik Narrows Lodge looks like a real nice place.Ultimately I doubt it matters where you end up. Trophy fishing is always just a bonus.Looking forward to hearing what you end up deciding upon - and of course, the report that follows!Cheers!"
1496057,Mike Borger,2012-10-16 12:48:00,1554,"Thanks again! I've researched Labrador to death and I've watched all those videos as well.I've fished the Eagle river system in Labrador once before and it was incredible. Always wanted to go back.The problem is my buddy doesn't fly fish and it's fly only out there for the most part.Fortress lake looks pretty cool. It would be kind of weird travelling to BC to catch brookies though.I always find the planning, research, booking then the anticipation of these trips is a lot of fun in itself. I'm enjoying myself right now.You're right though, no matter where we go we'll have a blast."
