The US agent did ask me to open the trunk but did not search it, he just looked it over.I do have a question.Knowing that we could not cross in Canada with night crawlers, on the way up we bought a half flat of crawlers in Nestor Falls. They were really nice crawlers and served us well all week but we had several dozen left when it was time to head home. We left those at the lodge but I got to wondering, could we have legally brought them home (back accross the border into the US)?"
1495499,hogridnfool,2012-10-14 17:26:00,349,"Yes, you could have. You can also bring Nightcrawlers into Canada, but they have to be in a canadian approved bedding, like newspaper. NO DIRT ALLOWED!"
1495500,Shellback,2012-10-14 17:27:00,8083,"You can bring worms from the US into Ontario, they can't be in dirt though. They must be packed in artificial bedding. Never have been asked crossing back to the states if I have worms, and usually bring some back."

1496393,trapper_john,2012-10-17 15:15:00,83,"Interesting enough, the crawlers that I buy here in WI come from Canada, in Canadian dirt. Canadian dirt has to be taken out and bedding put in for the worms to go home. Just an observation."
1496434,Obabikon,2012-10-17 18:19:00,2370,"Worms are perfectly legal to transport back and forth across the broder. Going up, coming home or both... Dirt is not allowed to be transported either direction. What it is for makes no difference."
1498631,k80john,2012-10-25 21:42:00,53,"We buy our crawlers at the Bait Box in Superior, WI in bedding. No dirt of course. We get through no problem coming or going."
