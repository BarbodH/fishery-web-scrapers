1498084,Mike Kansas,2012-10-24 09:16:00,1463,Good point Dave. We have all our reservations secured for 2013. Three trips to Lac Seul. Mike Kansas
1498123,aggie kolisnik,2012-10-24 11:31:00,39,"I am in agreement that your dates should be secured and your deposits sent. As a camp owner, I can say that very few dates are left on our board for 2013. Good luck for 2013 everyone."
1498181,bigwalleye1,2012-10-24 14:00:00,2632,"I make doubly sure next year's deposits are in place before departure for home on this year's trips. Having that little card in my wallet when I leave is a nice little ""daydream"" on the tough days at work. Open the wallet, check the dates, remember the fish, and smile. Makes the bad days pass faster. I like surprises, but pulling into a Canadian resort with 3 other guys, 2 trucks, 2 boats and a week's worth of supplies and finding out I have no reservation is NOT on the ""surprise"" list. My resorter sends me a calendar and a nice letter with my reservation info every year at Christmas as additional confirmation."
1498417,Mara5,2012-10-25 09:51:00,209,We stay at the same resort (pickeral arm) every year. We have our reservation for the following year before we leave.
