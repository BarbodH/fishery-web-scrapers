Over the years (decades) I have been fortunate to have partaken in numerous fly-ins and with few exceptions (really remote, low pressure lakes) there is a strong correlation between lake size and fish size. You can almost be certain that a smaller body of water, despite being remote, will be a numbers only lake at best if, it is booked solid during the season. In contrast, a larger lake can be both a numbers and trophy lake even with pressure approaching moderate. When my kids were younger, smaller lakes were cool although I did seek those that were not fished hard. Now, we prefer the opportunity for a trophy so a big lake is mandatory. The last two years we have caught lakers over 30 lbs and NP's over 45"" on a larger lake while catching more + 20"" ""walleye than we can count. Moreover larger lakes provide unlimited potential for exploring new spots. For those booking their first fly-in.....Size does matter."

The lake itself does not always have to be necessarily huge. My suspicion is that the deep areas provide a safe haven, perhaps reducing, to some degree, at times, the chance to be caught.

1499194,Skywagon,2012-10-28 07:27:00,1106,"Speaking of walleye only, I agree with Bill, smaller lakes with scattered deep water areas, can and do produce trophy fish. On the smaller-shallow lakes, it seems they can produce numbers, but rarely anything of bragging size, even on the lakes with little or no fishing pressure.I would guess to get to a lake where you can regularly catch ""over 30 pound lake trout, NP's over 45"", while catching more +20 inch walleye than we can count"", it will be an extended flight or a long road trip. That would definately be a fun trip and only improved on, if I could shoot a bull moose with a 60 inch spread while there, with someone else paying the bill. Dream on."
1499250,phishfearme,2012-10-28 09:57:00,1242,"only thing i'd add to bill's post is that in addition to having large areas of deep water (which enables winter survival) there needs to be large areas of shallow spawning gravely/rocky spots and large ""feeding shelves"" where they can feed and have access to deep water nearby. even huge lakes - without the above features may not fit the bill. although many of the hugh james bay lowlands lakes - which are flat, shallow and featureless (eg; kesagami) do hold trophy size eyes and pike. there's always exceptions - but i'd bet the MNR would tell you that in general, large lakes produce larger fish. phish"
1499288,zeebee,2012-10-28 11:46:00,1144,"918 min flight outta Red Lake....Trout Lake....why shoot a 60"" when you can get a biggee. I wouldnt proclaim regularly...except the walleye. Lakers average 8 lbs with every 10th fish or so over 15 lbs. Northerns over 35"" common. Ask the bride to pay the bill but do so whispering while she sleeps.....take no answer as affirmative."
1499533,Mike Kansas,2012-10-29 09:36:00,1463,"I perfer larger lakes with a fair amount of deep water and shelving ares. Also believe it is important to have some flowing water from rivers that provide some current and excellent spawning areas. Maybe most important is a good forage base. These conditions provide the ingredients for a healthy population of Walleye. The debate comes when we determine what a TROPHY fish is. I personally feel that a 29"" Walleye and bigger is a trophy and trophies need the conditions stated above. Mike Kansas"
