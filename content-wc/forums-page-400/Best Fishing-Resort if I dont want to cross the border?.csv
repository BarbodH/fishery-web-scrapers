Looking at Drive too options in Northern Minnesota. Main target is walleye, pike, bass. Looking for a resort with decent boats for rent. Lodging doesnt need to be anything fancy as long as the fishing is good. Any suggestions would be appreciated!"
1496385,dutchboy,2012-10-17 14:38:00,5717,"LOW, Rainy, Kabetogama, Namakin, Sand Point, Leech, Red Lake, Winni, Mille Lacs, and the list goes on and on. Minnesota has as many good fishing Lakes as Kansas City has good BBQ joints! All the lakes listed will have a resort with good accommodations and boats available. Pick a lake and we can get you resort names."
