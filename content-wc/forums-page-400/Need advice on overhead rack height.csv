I have had a Polaris 6-wheeler on it's side (sprayer tank mounted in bed, top heavy) and got by with cracked ribs. If at all feasable, pulling a small boat trailer with good ground clearance, might be a better option. Less problems with overhead tree limbs on tight trails and you can get away from the top heavy-tipping over problem. I know that won't work in all situations, but it would sure be inconveniant to interupt the fishing trip because you have to go to the hospital."
