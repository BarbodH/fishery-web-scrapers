1496559,adempsey,2012-10-18 08:13:00,963,"If I could swing a week to do that I would for sure. However, I pretty much stay local (in SW Ontario) due to money and time. Mostly day/weekend trips, but we do get away for a long weekend and stay at a cottage each season."

Jeff personally guides us on area lakes at no fee! We fish lakes in & around the Chapleau game preserve. Last year we did well with eyes and we even caught some ""eater"" size lakers. The cabins are big, clean, & have nicely equipped kitchens(no running water in the winter). At the end of the night we usually end up over at Jeff & Tina's place watching some hockey and having a few beers.*The last pic reminded me: Not much better than fresh fish, fried potatoes, & the Tigers advancing to the World Series!"
1497039,81Saluki,2012-10-19 17:16:00,97,"I'm not a hard-water fishing enthusiast, but the concept has always intrigued me. A few years ago a buddy in central MN convinced me to give it a try. So we rented a shack for a weekend on a popular lake. Didn't *SEE* a fish the entire weekend (had an underwater video system). We decided to try it again the next year -- with a different operator on a different part of the lake -- yet had the same result. Both trips were memorable but, in the end, neither was worth the cost. It's highly unlikely I'll ever do it again. For what it's worth, here's my advice/comments when considering renting an ice shack from an operator ... whether north or south of the border: FIRST -- We called various operators each year and everyone said they put their shacks on top of fish. DON'T BELIEVE THEM!! As far as I'm concerned, they'll say whatever you want to hear to get you to book a date. Harumph. SECOND -- Cost per night per person (for a tiny 8' x 10' shack) was more than what it would cost for a more comfortable local motel room with cable TV. Zero fish are possible at the motel, but if I never even *SEE* a fish under the shack, then the operator's value-added proposition becomes moot. BOTTOM LINE? If you're someone like me who wants to see/catch fish while IN the shack AND isn't mobile (no snowmobile, no auger) don't even think about it. :-( 81Saluki"

Come up in February, rent a snowmobile/ice auger, go back to the cabin at night ( yes, your cabin is winterized, so you will have to rough it with the outhouse and no water), that will be part of the fun. You should try it once, go with someone who knows what they are doing and you will be hooked."
