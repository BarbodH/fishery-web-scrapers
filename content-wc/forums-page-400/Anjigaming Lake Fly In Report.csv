1495018,Mike Borger,2012-10-12 13:32:00,1554,"Hey guys I recently spent 5 days at Anjigaming lake within the boundaries of the Chapleau Game Preserve, once again using Park's Fly In Fishing.I've flown into several of their camps over the last few years and have never had a bad trip.Overall it was a very good trip with some larger fish being caught once the pattern was established.That pattern was vertical jigging on deep rocky structure in 40-50' of water directly adjacent to the deepest basin in the lake.This pattern is very typical at least in my experience on deeper shield lakes once turnover has occurred.The camp is rustic but more than comfortable. Martin has made improvements since I was last there in the form of two new boats, a new very nice airtight wood stove, and an elaborate solar system that helps power electric lighting and the hot/cold running water in the cabin.It was all duly noted and appreciated. We really did win the weather lottery as well not breaking out the rain gear once on the entire trip.Overall thumbs up, can't wait to go back.If anyone's interested my full report can be seen here complete with pic's and video.Cheers, Mikehttp://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...howtopic=65935"
1495054,TIGHTLINER,2012-10-12 15:45:00,223,Great report Mike is this it for the 2012 season or are you headed up again?
1495060,Mike Borger,2012-10-12 16:11:00,1554,That's it for this year I think. It's steelhead season now anyway.
1495088,Rich B,2012-10-12 18:20:00,1081,"Mike, Thanks for another excellent report.....it's not only the outstanding photos ""on the water"" but the video's of the camp and some of the ""catching"" are fun to watch. Appreciate that you share so much freely following your trips up ""north on Holiday"". Faith, Family, Friends.....and Fishing. Rich"

1495625,Hawkfan,2012-10-15 07:58:00,237,Dang it! I wanted to see that monster you had on in that video too. And that last video of the fish Julian pulled in was a nice one. That thing had some shoulders on it. Great report. Thanks for sharing.

1495693,vteye,2012-10-15 11:07:00,812,"HI Mike,Your reports are the best, something I look forward to seeing. The Sutton report was book worthy. Thanks"
1495921,unclepaully,2012-10-15 21:11:00,112,Once again a great report. Thanks Mike. Is Park's completely done with Hawk Air now or do they fly out of both locales?
1495927,Mike Borger,2012-10-15 21:31:00,1554,I'm pretty sure they're offering their guests the option of flying out of either Hawk Junction or Chapleau.
