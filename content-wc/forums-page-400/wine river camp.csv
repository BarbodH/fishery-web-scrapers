1495424,Guest,2012-10-14 11:21:00,0,wine river camp our group out of chicago is thinking of visiting this resort for a week in september 2013 seems like a very remote camp and reports on fishing and resort experiences would be appreciated jim wolf chicago boys
1495435,HeHooksHimself,2012-10-14 12:10:00,725,"Well, this is our favorite place and I have been going here steadily for 12 years. This fishery is supreme. Because of good management and relatively low pressure, the walleye, trout and pike population is healthy and plentiful. Due to a recently reworked price structure, the annoyance of feeling nickled and dimed for everything you can imagine has been alleviated. Now their price includes boat seats and electric starts as it should. This camp is not particularly cheap but well worth the extra for the quality of the fishing. There are five lakes accessible from the camp and each one provides a different experience. There are also several lakes available for an extra charge. The camp itself is well maintained and Herb and Ann, the hosts, are great people. Herb is a carpenter so the cabins are the best, comfortable and well designed, most with a level of privacy and a beautiful deck overlooking the picturesque lake. No indoor plumbing here but the row of outhouses is clean and there is a shower house with hot water. Also no electricity but a recent addition of solar lighting is available in some of the cabins. We go in the spring and I know the September patterns must be different but the fish are not hard to find. If you want any more information i will be glad to talk with you personally through PM or email. Good Choice!"

1495610,Guest,2012-10-15 07:22:00,0,dave winelakecamp.com it looks like a great resort jim wolf thinking of going next september however it looks like the resort is for sale so I don't know if it will change prices drastically or conditions of resort and equipment so I plan to evaluate it next spring jim wolf chicago boys
1495666,HeHooksHimself,2012-10-15 09:43:00,725,"The camp has been for sale for several years. i think Ann is more interested than Herb in selling. Let me assure you that they have not let things go while it is for sale, this camp and the equipment is in the best repair. As far as your questions....well its fishing. Can you catch fifty walleyes a day per person? We have had many days like that. Can you have days when you are lucky to catch enough to eat. We have had days like that. While we are familiar with this system, we have found no better place for consistent good fishing than this place. Lake Trout? Wine Lake has big and healthy trout. We fish in the spring and these things are flopping around in the shallows then. Average fish are around 25"" and we have have plenty over 30"". Doc has caught two at 34 1/2 and as big around as your thigh. We have heard of several over 40"". Smallmouth are here and have been for about 5 or 6 years. Most of them are isolated at Anishinabi Falls but they have made their way out to Wine Lake. usually we get them up to 16"". We typically jig in this system for walleyes, but plenty of people back troll with lindy rigs or some similar set ups. This system has big pike all over and my biggest is 42"" Last year we had two rookies with us and I had one with me on the first day. His first fish was a 42"" pike trolling a #12 rapala. I have caught countless pike over the slot and we almost always have 6-8 a year in our group. I have no stake in this place other than my love for it and i consider Herb and Ann good friends even though I have never seen them anywhere but at their camp! you will not be sorry."
1495689,teddi,2012-10-15 10:54:00,349,nothing against paul and deb but my choice would be wine lake camp. better fishing and not as far to travel by boat to find them.
1495803,Guest,2012-10-15 15:34:00,0,"teddi thanks for input can you give me some details of your past trip experiences at wine lake camp have you been able to average on some days 50 walleyes/man and some nice northerns 35"" + we did a lot of trolling with big plugs all week(SEPT 15-22) at wrc and had only one decent one 33 1/2 ""plus the good fishing we found out the hard way is at narrow lake and the north end we spend all day on a boat drive with gps to find the place;your comments and thoughts on wine lake appreciated fairly decent steady action for walleyes with 5 miles from camp jim wolf chicago boys"
