Any recommendations or ideas are greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for sharing your ideas and experiences."
1497492,NARDA 1,2012-10-22 09:38:00,636,Eagle Lake is about 2 1/2 hours from International Falls and is a great lake for pike and musky. www.birchdalelodge.com
1497501,Mike Kansas,2012-10-22 10:06:00,1463,"We use to strictly fish for Pike on Lac Seul. Even though we now spend most of our time on Walleye and Smallies we still manage to Pike fish a little. Have caught and still do catch a lot of Pike and some nice ones. Got several over 40 "" last year fishing wood near deep water."

Options for accomodation would be Ash Rapids Lodge, Shoal Lake Lodge, or a daily trailer from Kenora (book into a hotel). Ash Rapids is better option in terms of the two resorts. Easy access to awesome musky, walleye and lake trout to boot."
