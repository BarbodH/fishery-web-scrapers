1490410,1jigfish2,2012-09-26 13:07:00,110,"Glad that had fun anyways. Any trip is what you make of it, we cannot control the weather. Good luck in spring, we will be back at Cedar Lake for the opener."
1495398,Kevin R,2012-10-14 09:26:00,305,"I was up that same week & told the fishing was awful. I thought Walleye fishing was great same for Bass, but Pike were near impossible to catch. I caught 50 Walleye in about an hour one day then tried pike, in 4 hours I caught one pike it was 37"" skinny had a couple huge hooks in it from a sucker rig it broke off of, the thick leader along with the hooks were stopping the fish from feeding I removed the hooks & leader the fish swam away with a chance to feed better. I had no trouble catching Walleye at anytime but only got 4- pike all week & spent most of my time fishing for them. The water was the dirtiest I have ever seen thick patches of green scum on the surface. Weather was nice most days."
1495436,HeHooksHimself,2012-10-14 12:16:00,725,"Kevin, there was one group in our camp that landed on a walleye hole and were able to produce with crawler harnesses- maybe it was you. We are jiggers and while we caught enough to eat and bring a few home, we are used to much steadier action. No complaints though, as we would rather be in a boat than at work. Cathing fish is just a bonus. We caught only two pike in the two days and both (in the mid 20"" range) were healthy and aggressive. Glad you had more luck, you were probably using a different method. In any case, Cedar Lake is not the type of lake we would probably return to."
1495863,1jigfish2,2012-10-15 18:37:00,110,"We have been going up for 5 years, planning to go back up in spring. We have not found a lake that produces the way that this one does. We only jig with medium fathead minnows.The green scum (algae) was bad this fall, but did not make a difference with fishing. The first few days were work to locate the numbers of fish we like, but then we hit paydirt."
1488258,HeHooksHimself,2012-09-20 05:05:00,725,"Returned Monday night from our brief trip to Cedar Lake with Cedar Lake Lodge. This trip did not produce many fish for us but in fairness the weather was all over the place. First day we hunted and scared up enough for dinner in a drizzley morning and then partly cloudy afternoon. Second day we went south in the morning and managed to boat only a sucker. It was warm and sunny. No fish eaten during our mid day break. That afternoon we hit a few and thought we found a hole, but that hole only produced fish the next day and not very many at that. Third day was spent mostly at the narrows and we were able to catch a few to pack out. Last day we went hunting on the east arm and could literally not even mark a fish on the depth finder. A brisk north wind made things really tough. Nice scenery but we could only eat the fish we had already caught. All in all the fishing was slow but we managed to eat walleye every meal except one and pack out 3 apiece and a giant perch.We stayed at Cedar Lake Lodge and enjoyed our host, Al. He is a laid back guy that gave us some advice but really just let us do our own thing, which we were ok with. The camp is an older place and a little run down but it was adequate for us. When we first arrived he wanted to ""upgrade"" us but being the cheap low-budget guys we are we stayed with the 14 ft boat with the well used 15hp 2 stroke Yamaha. Needless to say we were never in a hurry and we got a chance to look around trying to get somewhere. While we typically like a more remote location, it was nice to be able to see the ND Irish whip up on the Mich. St. Spartans on the satellite TV. One funny thing that happened is when Doc opened the toilet lid to make the first deposit there was a frog swimming around in it. Scared the crap out of him! Literally.Cedar Lake is probably a good fishery for those that know the lake and have their honey holes marked but we struggled. The road noise from the 105 was loud and with the number of resorts and cabins on the lake I am sure the pressure is great throughout the summer. All in all it was worth the trip but not one of those lasting memories. Maybe we are just spoiled with Wine Lake Camp. It makes a difference when the owner is a carpenter and as anal as Herb and Ann can be about things we have grown to appreciate the remoteness, maintenance, equipment, cabins and the fishery that is Wine Lake Camp. We'll be there in eight months for the walleye opener."
1488405,Pikeslayer8,2012-09-20 10:24:00,1460,So many times it can really be a crap shoot on the fishing conditions this time of year. Going to a new lake with fronts rolling through all the time can really turn off the bite and make things tough. So how was that sucker and frog leg supper?
1488408,wallydave,2012-09-20 10:33:00,2151,"Some of the best Canadian memories and stories revolve around less than spectacular fishing trips! Like many have said, ""a bad day of fishing beats a good day at work!"" The days with the better fishing just add to the joy of the trip!"
1488419,HeHooksHimself,2012-09-20 11:03:00,725,"It was worth the trip. here's a good story: There we were sitting at the narrows. i pulled up a few but Doc was getting skunked. Now the one nice thing about CLL is that they put two bailing buckets in the boat, one in the front and one in the back. Doc decides to relieve himself and like clockwork, gets his first bite in midstream. This was the only fish over 18"" and I offer to net it but he doesn't respond and pulls up the fish losing the jig head in the process, but the fish makes the boat. I said, ""well, I offered to net it!"" and he responds, ""I wasn't thinking, I had my wanger out!"" It was at that point he realized that he had pizzed all over himself. That right there made the trip worth it!"
1488437,wallydave,2012-09-20 12:14:00,2151,"...we call that ""chummin for walleyes!"" As you can see it works!! Thanks to working in a hospital we now feature the bedside urinals in our camp boats!!"
1488500,Glenman12,2012-09-20 15:36:00,762,WTF!!!..Ive been going to CLL for over 30 yrs and never had two bailers in the boat..I need to email Al...
1488503,tackleman,2012-09-20 15:39:00,444,"if you watch the postings about gullrock, red lake and lac seul, you will see that this has been a strange year for the bite. all these lakes are reporting very spotty fishing at times and some days the fish are few and far between. you just hit Cedar at one of those weeks when fishing was crappy"
1488552,HeHooksHimself,2012-09-20 18:11:00,725,"Maybe I should have looked at the bill a little closer. Two bailing buckets might have been an upgrade, lol."
1488566,Glenman12,2012-09-20 18:46:00,762,As far as Al trying to put you in a bigger boat..it was probably because he had some extra 16's as the camp wasnt full..when we go in the middle of June the camp is full and all of the 16's are in use..
1488699,HeHooksHimself,2012-09-21 07:22:00,725,"We weren't offended by the offer to upgrade, but we are so cheap and low budget he found out pretty quickly that we were trying to slide by. Some of our lack of success is definitely a product of our lack of aggressiveness. All I know is every minute I spent there was better than whatever else I would have been doing had I not been there."
