1496695,Aaron-IN,2012-10-18 13:49:00,500,If you have any Canadian friends up there you trust give them the money and have them buy the boat and get it registered for you.
1496754,Skywagon,2012-10-18 17:22:00,1106,"You will be all right to register it in Canada, may need to use a Canadian mailing address (can't remember). Aaron, had to go to Minaki Aircraft Repair yesterday, drove through the big city just because, thought you would like to know it is still there. Did not see any fish floating, so you may be all right for next season."
1496812,Bill Krejca,2012-10-18 20:47:00,6107,"Hmm... This summer I picked up a form at Canadian customs at Pigeon River allowing me to leave my boat, to be picked up several weeks later, and returned to US. They didn't have any objections to this. Bill"
1493253,Hawker,2012-10-06 06:10:00,3967,"Any way to find out what the rules/laws are on a US citizen buying a used boat in Ontario and storing it there for personal use? Wife retires this winter and looking at purchasing a good used boat up north, keeping it there and making multiple trips during the year(s) to come. Already have a place we can pull the RV trailer to and stay, but don't want to have to try and drag a boat along behind too. Ideas, suggestions?? Appreciate it!!"
1493257,Campcountry,2012-10-06 06:43:00,164,The only issue you may run into would be licencing the boat. If you are tying to licence the boat in Canada you may need a Canadian address. Perhaps give them a call - http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety...cence-3212.htm It may be easier to buy and register a boat in the US and just leave it in Canada. US residents who cottage in Canada do that all the time.
1493271,Skywagon,2012-10-06 08:39:00,1106,"It has to be registered in Canada to legally leave it there. Note, I said legally."
1493375,fisherman 1,2012-10-06 19:17:00,39,"I had a friend from Iowa that damaged there lower unit late in the fall one year. They took the boat to a local marine dealer to repair it and store it for the winter, to be picked up in the spring. as they stay in a RV in Canada for the whole summer.Canada Customs decided to check the area for out of country boats and RV's. They stopped at the marine dealer and saw the Iowa boat, found out where they stayed, then they went to the RV park and checked for out of country RV's being left in Canada.The boat owner did leave there RV in Canada but it was purchased in Canada so there was no problem with that. But with the boat they had the option of either coming up and taking it back to Iowa for the winter, or to pay the sales tax for the current value of the boat, get the trailer safety checked and register it in Canada.Be carefull what you do. You can leave it in Canada but Legally you do have to register it and pay sales tax on it.Good Luck"
1493573,pan-man,2012-10-07 20:11:00,299,I leave a boat and camper up in Canada for Summer. I pull a permit (free) while crossing border. I believe I can leave them for 90 days without any problems. I try to get to same place 4-5 times a year and sure makes the traveling a lot easier. I am even able to drive a car on the in between trips.
1493645,LOW1,2012-10-08 07:43:00,2828,"For a number of years we have kept a U.S. registered boat at a marina in Canada. There is a form which the marina or the border crossing will have which must be completed. Also, there is a requirement that the marina must do some repair or service on the boat. An oil change is sufficient. The form needs to be provided to the border crossing each year. And the marina needs to keep a copy.Apparently marinas are inspected for compliance periodically.A U.S. registered boat which is just parked or stored permanently in Canada other than at a proper facility is subject to penalty or confiscation if found."
1493692,LOW1,2012-10-08 09:52:00,2828,"Here's a link re a nonresident storing a non-Canadian registered boat year round at a Canadian marina. It's discussed in paragraph 11 under ""Temporary Importation.""http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publicati...d2-2-3-eng.pdfIf you don't want to go that route I'd consider buying and registering the boat in Canada, especially if you want to buy a used one. A Canadian dealer should be able to help with the licensing process."
1494132,Hawker,2012-10-09 13:48:00,3967,"My thoughts are to purchase, or at least attempt to purchase a good used boat from one of two fishing camps on LOTW that they plan on selling to upgrade their line of camp boats. Of course I would make the purchase legal in all respects, but what I didn't know (still don't yet) is if I as a US citizen can purchase and register the boat in Canada and leave it there for use when I come up. I know what I want to do in my head, but putting it down in words I tend to confuse even myself (lol)!!"
1494502,Burr,2012-10-10 14:19:00,8612,"I know what you mean Hawker. But you're right to ask the question. Last year when I entered Canada - I knew I was going to be there for the weekend, return to the states, and then return to Canada for the following weekend. I asked customs if it was allowable, legal, for me to leave my boat in storage in Canada between trips. They had one answer for me - I have to bring my boat with me when I leave Canada. Can't leave anything behind.Still would like to leave the boat/quad up there between trips, but what they told me was it's not allowed."
1494509,LOW1,2012-10-10 14:35:00,2828,I think the answer to your question is yes - if you buy the boat in Canada and license and keep it in Canada.http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety...cence-3211.htm A telephone number for information is 1-800-267-6687.
