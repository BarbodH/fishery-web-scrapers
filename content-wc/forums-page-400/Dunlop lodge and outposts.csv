1496527,MidWestFishman,2012-10-18 06:40:00,44,I haven't fished there but did meet Jerry the owner at an All Canada fishing show. I was already booked to go to another lodge that year (Jerry used to guide for them) or I would have went to his lodge. He seemed like a super guy and very knowledgable about pike fishing. He gave me some inside info on the lodge I was going to that I found very factual when I went there. I have received the Manitoba Master Angler lists the last couple years and he always has a ton of people who get their name listed so I don't think he is inflating his lodge at all when he calls it trophy fishing. I have wanted to go there and it will probably be my 2014 lodge pick.
