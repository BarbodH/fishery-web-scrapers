He said, ""let's not net it, I'll just grab her""... leaned a little too far over, and had nothing to catch himself on. I grabbed the fish, then helped him back into the boat. Still have the picture of the two of us holding the fish, him soaking wet. Great memory!"
1494687,McLoki,2012-10-11 10:30:00,102,"On one of the very early trips out with the boat after I purchased it (just a few months ago), was launching at a Lake I had never been to that would actually let me run my main motor (a rarity around here). We were hoping to drive to the marina, but never found it - instead found a launch site that was free, but no dock next to the ramp. (the first time I had been to a ramp with no dock) backed up the boat, everything was fine, unhooked what I needed to and proceeded to walk into the water to climb up into the boat.As soon as my foot hit the water, there was no traction at all - dropped straight to my butt and started sliding. Grabbed the trailer and tried to stand up, but I couldn't (and fell full into the water in the process) - no traction at all. I finally had to just hold on to the trailer and scoot on my butt until I was out of the water, then stand. It was a busy day and of course, everyone waiting to launch got a great laugh. (Almost as good as when I finally got into the boat, (climbed over the front) - started floating away and realised the keys were in the truck. My wife threw me the keys (which I thankfully caught)). The rest of the day was as fun as the start and we ended up just giving up on that lake, going to our normal fishing lake, using the kicker. We have not returned to the lake since. If nothing else, it did teach me how easy it would be to drop an entire vehicle into a lake. If I had only rear wheel drive and the tires hit the water, there is no way a 2WD car/truck could have gone anywhere but in the lake.Michael"
1494711,EyeMagic,2012-10-11 11:36:00,10,"Some funny stories here. The reason I posted this is because one of the funniest moments we had experienced in going to Canada over 25+ years was Hubba taking the Plunge a few years back.We were at White Pine Lodge (LOTW) several years back in spring, Last weekend of May. There was 3 of us. Hubba, Honesby and Myself. Beautiful spring day and a trip to Yellowgirl on LOTW was in order. Fishing was great all day and we needed to return back to the lodge (White Pine-Snake Bay) as we were on the American Dinner Plan. We headed back to camp around 4:30pm to get cleaned up and grab a few beers before dinner. We approach the dock and Hubba jumps out with rope on front of the boat and proceeds to tie off the front of boat to the dock. The back end swings out away from the dock and Hubba reaches out to grab my hand and pull us in. His hand never made contact with mine and he goes into a full-on somersault into the cold spring water. Keep in mind, he has Jeans,Long Underwear, T-shirt, Hoodie Sweat shirt, Full Flannel Jacket. Seconds later(for what seemed an eternity) we see Hubba's Hat, Smokes and misc sunglass case, misc paperwork,etc. float to the top. I look at Honesby and say ""Where did he go?"". Just then we hear the sound of whale's blowhole and up surfaces hubba, gasping for air and what assuredly was some very cold water. At this point Honesby and I bust out laughing and nearly pee in our pants from watching all this unfold in front of us. Hubba struggles several times to pull himself onto the dock as we fumble around with the net to get his belongings that surfaced from the water. Hubba then proceeds down the dock and yells out a few explitives and say's ""I'M NOT GOING TO DINNER"" and implying that it was our fault that this had just happened. Honesby and I can hardly contain ourselves and watch and listen to him Squish and Squash up the huge incline of stairs to cabin 4 and hear the infamous Screendoor slam behind him. We sat in the boat with our backs to the cabin laughing and almost falling into the water ourselves from what we had just experienced. We then proceed up the stairs looking down at the path of water which looked like were tracking bigfoot from the trail of water his shoes and clothes had just left. We entered the cabin giggling like a bunch of 3rd grade girls, hardly containing ourselves. Honesby and I grabbed a few beers and cleaned up for dinner. Hubba went down to the dock to see if he could scoop out his prescription sunglasses which he had lost and was never able to locate or get off the bottom with the net. Honesby and I walked to the lodge for dinner and they asked where's hubba in which we replied ""He's a little under the water"" as that went right over their heads. We returned to the cabin with Hubba's boxed dinner and entered the cabin to what appeared to be a kitchen table with all his wet belongings laid out like an evidence table that only the O.P.P. could have created. This started another outburst of laughter lasting another 10 minutes along with 5 more minutes of laughter from the clothesline on the screened porch with all the wet clothes. To this day Hubba will never laugh about it but finally assured us that it wasn't our fault? Whatever Hubba!OH CANADA- I love the fact that every year, no matter what, many,many good memories are made up there and are all in good fun in keepin with God's Country.p.s. nobody was hurt in making this memory (Maybe Hubba's Pride--LOL)"
1494826,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-10-11 19:06:00,84,The bologna was fried in a pan. Don't want to make our Canadian friends mad but the bologna wasn't too good. We bought a whole roll at at grocery store in Nestor Falls. We tried to eat it as sandwiches but didn't taste like American bologna. He got a wild hair one morning and decided it might taste better fried. Looked nasty when he fried it up. No chance I would have ate it. He paid for it later.
1494844,wallydave,2012-10-11 20:14:00,2151,"One year we tried a new lake, my boat and cabin buddy and I were out one morning, he had a ""emergency"" we stopped at a shore lunch spot so he could take care of ""business"" he rushed off the boat, stepping on my spare rod and reel, and breaking it. Now I have one of his favorite reels. I have tried to give it back but he feels he owes me one! Every year since then I have tried to give it back! We still have a good laugh about ""pristine"" shore lunch spot!"
1494933,Guest,2012-10-12 08:20:00,0,"Rainy days and shore lunches don't mix very well. I usually try to go ashore on the large smooth rocks along the shores of beautiful Lac Seul. I hate getting sand in the boat. The caring husband that I am I lovingly helped my wife out of the boat and onto a safe surface and warned her of the dangers of the slippery rocks. The rest of the guys showed up in their boats and a lunch was enjoyed by all. When it was time to get back to fishing, I lovingly helped my wife back into the boat and proceeded to gather the lunch bags and untie the rope to launch the boat. On my final return to the boat, my feet slipped out from under me, and I fell flat on my back and slid down the rocks into the lake. My wife with a concerned voice asked me if I had slipped. I answered with the first thing that came to my mind. ""No dear. I thought it would be nice to throw my body against this rock and slide into the lake."" The rest of the guys were laughing until they saw my wife's face. It was a pretty quiet afternoon in the boat. The rain was almost pleasant."
1494940,lacywbosu,2012-10-12 08:46:00,171,I am still laughing.
1495105,Fishin Fun,2012-10-12 19:09:00,218,Is it bad that I just laughed out loud and my wife looked at me like I'm crazy? OMG that's funny.
1495382,dman617,2012-10-14 08:30:00,117,"About 5 years ago, while at the launch, I took a 1/2 plunge. At about age 30. Unloaded the trailer, and I thought I could take a large step/ leap on to the dock from the trailer. Apparently, I was not close enough. Took a big step and my leading leg slipped from the dock and then I proceeded to impale my thigh on the dock post. The post was about 6 inches higher then the dock deck. Waist down was in the water, sunglasses went flying over the dock and in the drink. Upper half of my body laying on the dock. Others watched my actions and asked if I was OK. ""looks like that hurt"". ""Nah, I'm OK,not a problem. Hope the fish are biting today"" Tie up the boat. Limp up to the truck with tears in my eyes from pain and getting a bit queasy. Go park the truck. Come wobbling down to the truck and take off. Only made it about 1/2 hour fishing. Couldn't use that leg for a couple days. Must have bruised the bone or something. Note to self. Don't do that again. And when you fall, look for your sunglasses. Didn't realize they came off until later on the lake. Never did find them in 1-2 ft of water at the dock."
1496514,fourize,2012-10-18 05:31:00,287,"My 80 year old father fell out of the boat a few years ago. It wasn't the warmest of days either. His face turned white as a ghost, and he looked terrified. I grabbed onto his arm and held on to him for dear life. He managed to grab the side of the boat with both hands/arms and just relax and stay calm before we planned our next move. Between me pulling and him hoisting himself up, we managed to get him back in the boat. Only then did we realize we were on a rock reef in about 4 foot of water. He could have literally stood up...LOL! We had to go back in because he was cold and started shivering, but he changed into dry clothes and back out we went. We had a good laugh afterwards."
1494461,EyeMagic,2012-10-10 12:02:00,10,"Ok, I've been to Canada for over 25+ years and have failed only once to land in the boat and take my seat. The One time I failed, I was very wet. How many of you have taken the ""plunge""? Whether it be off the dock or while on the lake? I am sure there are many funny stories relating to this. Let's hear em'."
1494466,tv4fish,2012-10-10 12:20:00,2694,Yup - I've got one. My 2 buddies and I -- first time on Minnitaki --- 17 ft. Basstracker Guide Special with 50 hp Merc. tiller. We are heading out on the lake - guy in front pedesatal has a wide brim hat - wind starts to blow it off - he reaches down to grab it - falls in -- my other buddy and I grab him as the boat continues at the same speed - we had him out of the water so fast his wallet didn't even get wet.
1494534,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-10-10 16:32:00,84,"After a fried bologna breakfast a buddy of mine has a bowel emergency. Touch an go getting to shore in time. He panics, jumps while we are 5 feet or so from shore. Doesn't make it, slips and falls backward into the lake. Completely soaked and pooped his pants to top if off."
1494560,RickOnt,2012-10-10 18:21:00,217,"Hey SM HunterI don't care what anyone says ""That there is Funny""Rick"
1494566,Glenman12,2012-10-10 18:41:00,762,"OMG, I cant stop laughing..that is hilarious..cant wait to tell my buddies this one at our weekly lunch tomorrow...but, fried bologna for breakfast?..have it for lunch a few times when we go up but never for breakfast.."
1494568,grizzley,2012-10-10 18:52:00,2518,"That may be tough to beat!!!While reaching for the net, I was ""launched"" into the delaware river, backwards, at night, by one of those stupid clamp on seats. (not my boat)You should have seen the look on the young guys face when I popped up and grabbed onto the side of the boat. The seat is now fully secured. Sort of glad it happened to me, and not his girlfriend. Now we laugh about it. I had a 29 1/4'' walleye in the boat, and asked him where the red button was. When he said; what button? I replied; the one you hit to throw the old guy out the boat when he catches a bigger fish than you!!!"
1494582,djarz929,2012-10-10 19:44:00,40,This is f*ing hilarious. My buddies will be rolling when i tell them this one. Fried Bologna is always on our menu.
1494588,wallydave,2012-10-10 20:16:00,2151,"Is that pan fried? Deep fried, and with what oil!!?? Which Canadian beer goes with fried bologna any way?"
1494598,2746,2012-10-10 20:48:00,3206,"Pan fried bologna is pretty common in Canada. On several breakfast menus at resturantes I've been to. Ordered it just once.....comes thick cut, pan fried and not something I ever ordered again. I prefer spam."
1494664,HeHooksHimself,2012-10-11 08:59:00,725,"While I am sure i can't beat the fried bologna story, I do have a bowel emergency story if anyone wants to start that thread. For this one I will have my ""taking the plunge"" story.While at Wine Lake Camp, my son Nate and I decided to take the 1/2 mile hike up a rustic trail to Tipover Lake, which no one had fished that year up to that point (first week in june). It is called Tipover Lake because they used to have a canoe there and tipping over was frequent but in recent history it has had a small jon boat with oars. We made our way on to the lake in the small semi-stable boat and rowed our way over to where we thought the fish might be but after 45 minutes or so I needed to change positions. now, you might be aware that the sides of a jon boat are only an inch or two higher than the seats. I am aware of that now but during the change of positions it seemed natural to have the side of the boat catch my lower back. Well, that didnt happen and as I fell backwards off the boat I launched my son into the drink as well, along with almost everything in the boat. Forturnately most of that floated and we were able to gather it up and didn't lose anything and my son was able to get himself back in the boat with no problem. I, however, had a different experience as my boots were now full of water and i couldn't get my fat azz and 59 year old body back into the boat. After about 20 minutes in the water and a mighty pull by my son I was able to get most of the gut over the back of the boat and out of the water. Fortunately it was sunny and I was able to warm up and get relatively dry. Casualties were precious cigars (which we ended up taking back to the cabin and hanging on a clothes line, though the weren't the same) and my wife's digital camera which she reluctantly let me bring along.They say things come in three's and so later that day I got out of the bigger boat at a falls that we like to fish from the bank and slipped on the mud and cracked two ribs. The next day we were in Turnaround Lake and i was the passenger and it was raining, so I was bundled in my hoodie. When I came out, nothing looked familiar and i had no idea where i was!As you can imagine, I have been getting ribbed about that trip and my experience of:Tipping over in Tipover LakeFalling at the Falls, andGetting turned around in Turnaround.By the way, I am only permitted by the wife to take waterproof disposable cameras to Canada."
