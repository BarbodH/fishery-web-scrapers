1497680,Chops,2012-10-22 19:30:00,56,Curious how many people still heading up north yet this year for a late fall trip. Years ago it seemed that most resorts closed about the first of October. Now it seems that many stay open later to draw in the fall fishermen. So just wondering how many people take advantage of the late season.

This year I had an opportunity to go up the last week of September. I had a great time. Temps were perfect (for me) and the fishing was wonderful. Also, there were very few people. The week after we came home they had about a foot of snow in Red Lake and very cold temps. so it is kind of a crap shoot but one I hope to take again."
