511512,Guest,2001-03-18 06:39:00,0,"You don't have the colour numbers do you? Storm Lures used to make over a 100 colour combos for the Thin Fin, Normark has reduced that to about 15.There wasn't a lot of places that carried a wide assortment of colours in Thin Fins. I've picked most of my assortment from discount bins and from some very old displays in some shops.I'd just keep looking and check out those sale bins.Not much help trying to find your colours, they'll be tough to find.David aka superdad"
511513,fishhead,2001-03-19 17:31:00,48,you and me both !!!!!!!!!!!! still have gold and black in mat finish which they dont make any more. and still have the original shinner minnow in same colour.also in red and blue and green. Wouldnt trade even for gold instead i made a mould and started making them for myself not very easy at first but persistence pays off.
