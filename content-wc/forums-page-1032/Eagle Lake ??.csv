I've got current maps and am reading as much as I can. I've got a guide booked for the first two days. I'm looking for any info anyone can pass on concerning fall walleye patterns, locations, presentations, ect. about Eagle lake. Look forward to hearing from someone who has fished it at this time of year. Thanks in advance..Ed"

Your guide should be able to turn you onto the hot spots. We went without a guide the first couple days and then were guided the rest of the week. It is a HUGE body of water so the guides know it best. Which lodge are you staying at? Good Luck!

Also, did you guys do any muskie fishing. Also, if ya got any waypoints you'd like to pass on just E-mail them to me. Where did you stay when you were there and how was the weathre.. Take care and tight lines..Ed"
