Do you ussualy catch alot of fish or just big fish? Is there alot good sized Northern fishing? Also does this lake or a near lake have trout? Do you guys have any suggestions for a lake that has excellent Northern fishing, eithter Ontario or Manitoba. Lastly how far is Gullrock from International Falls (miles/hours). Thanks"
511543,Guest,2001-03-18 15:22:00,0,Never fished it but heard good reports of alot of fish. Appproximately 4-4 1/2 hours from Int. Falls

Caught plenty of walleyes on one ""hump"" in middle of lake, but had to contend with 20 boats all circling the same spot. So so in other areas. I liked the lake, we camped in a motor home, but lots of area resorts. I'd go again. Only complaint is too many other boats. But it is fairly easy to get to private areas, since the lake is so big."
511546,Guest,2001-03-19 18:12:00,0,"Brian- I have fished Gull Rock for 12 years. Most of the time in the firsrt week of August but three years in June. We have had good fishing. A couple of years the walleyes were too big to keep, so eating was in danger. I usually don't fish northern, but have seen soem good ones. We do catch some trolling for eyes. The lake is big, but alot of islands . I like to fish Keg lake, bigger walleyes. ?We stay at Weavers. E-mail me if you would like more information."
