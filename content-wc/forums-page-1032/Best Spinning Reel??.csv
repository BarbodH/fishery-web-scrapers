511503,Guest,2001-03-17 11:54:00,0,"You didn't say how much you wanted to spend, but here's what I would get for that rod:- Shimano 2000FD series, Stradic, Symetre, Sahara, Sedona (pick your price)- Fin-Nor Ahab Lite 2000 series- Diawa Tournament SS 1300.Can't go wrong with any of these."
511504,Karl,2001-03-17 20:59:00,63,"I totally agree, in that order. Shimano is the best, Fin-Nor is second, and Diawa third a distant third. Get a size that holds 140-170 yards of 6 to 8 pound test, like the Shimano 2000 series. As for price, I didn't catch any more walleye on my new Shimano Sustain 2000 ($225) than on my old Shimano Symetre 2000 ($70). I've used Shimano excusively for 10 years and never had a single problem with them. (buy the way, I also think St.Croix makes the best rods - good choice!)"
511505,Guest,2001-03-18 18:42:00,0,Pricey but my pinnacle is worth double what i paid for it.

511507,Guest,2001-03-18 21:20:00,0,Shimano reels are my choice. Some of the smoothest reels I've fished with. Either 2000F or 2000R. (Depending on wether or not you like front or rear drag) Good luck!
511508,Guest,2001-03-20 22:10:00,0,I'd go with a Shimano Sedona also. But I also have a nice Penn 4300SS which has done me well in the Quetico. I take both on those trips.
