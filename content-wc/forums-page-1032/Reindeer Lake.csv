511548,Skyraptor,2001-03-18 18:33:00,291,Am going to Reindeer Lake Trout Camp in late June and would appreciate any information that anyone has on this camp and the what to expect in size and quality of fish at this time of year. Also are biting insects out at that time of year? What type of lures to bring and what size and color?

I never heard of Trout Camp, but I know there are several lodges in the southern end of the lake.Because the south end of the lake is accessible by road, the further north you go, the better the fishing. Late June should be a good time, bugs on the water won't bother you, but on shore, they will eat your #####. We caught pike on everything. take the standard spoons, 5 of diamonds, red eyes, etc. But also take plastic baits. sluggo's worked real well in the weads. 7""-9"" long. Crank baits, jerk baits, top water, they all caught fish. we used small jigs with chartruise grubs to catch walleye. and most of the spoons will catch trout. Let me know where this lodge is located. I might make it up to Reindeer again. Good Luck"
