Happy Landing is exactly what you are looking for. Excellent fishing, food, service and equipment. I just read an article in the outdoor news about them, and already am looking forward to our trip this year. This will be our fourth year going back there and let me tell you, I look forward to it more and more every year. Well good luck with your search Ron!"
