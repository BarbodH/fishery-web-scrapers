511493,Hammerhead Herb,2001-03-16 13:02:00,259,Does anyone have any info on these lakes east of Dryden. How good is the fishing and at what particular locations? How well are the channels marked?How good is the lodge and the service?The German food looks interesting and we might make it there this year.
511494,Guest,2001-03-16 14:52:00,0,"We were up there the last two years and the food and the service is fantastic. Both years the fishing was slow. We went early June last year and had bad weather and the first year was early August. Walleye fishing was slow and we only landed a very small muskie. The Pike fishing is plentiful. The lakes are much easier to navigate through than Eagle lake. If you go you must portage to the smallmouth bass lake. It was incredible, 4-6 pound smallies on a regular basis. Walter and Manfred run a lodge. This year we are going to Lake of the Woods, but would go back in a heartbeat. Let me know if you need more info. Have a great time!!"
511495,Guest,2001-03-16 17:21:00,0,been fishing that lake for 10 years now and been staying at merkels camp like there. 2 years caught a 10 lbs walleyeand had great fishing that year . the only problem fishing there is when the wind blows the big lake gets a chalkie look.take night cralwers with you .
511496,Walley Guide,2001-03-17 19:15:00,67,"I have been fishing the lakes since the mid-70's. Last year was one of the best walleye years, fought some tough water at times.I am there on the second or/and the third week, after season opens each year. I have not stayed at Lone Pine, but I have talked to some who have. If you want meals fixed and taken care of, I don't think you will find a finer place on this lake chain. I like fixing my own meals, plus staying on Dinoric is closer to where I fish. I have stayed at Pine Sunset for most of the years. The camp is not fancy by no means, but if your looking for a bed, bath, and a place to get away it has worked well. Brown Bay Camp is the other camp on Dinoric, fine folks there and the cabins are in much better condition. If you would like information about the lakes, please e-mail me at [email protected] I will try to help answer some questions you may have, and if I can't find the answer, I'll get you linked up with one of my friends up there if you need more help than I can provide. I am not a professional guide I just love chasing those eyes and I got the name from my family and friends by putting them on the walleye in some tough conditions.Hope this helps some.Walley"

511498,Guest,2001-03-20 11:37:00,0,I have been going to these lakes for 10 yrs. some years the fishing has been better than others. I have heard of lakes that are better but I am content. In our group we have had people catch 15 lb pike and up to 7 lb walleye. We have always had enough to fix for meals and meet our limit.
