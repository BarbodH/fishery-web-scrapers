Where is a good spot to fish that is reasonably close.2- We go to Athapapukow(sp) just south of Flin Flon. How are the water conditions supposed to be this spring?3- How and where do you catch walleye in numbers on that lake? We have fished that lake for years and cannot seem to get into the walleye. Any help and advice will be greatly appreciated. John"
511417,gofish,2001-03-11 20:16:00,24,You've got some excellent fishing right there in Turtle Mountain Provincial Park. William lake has some pretty good trout and perch. I think there's other lakes in the park worth checking out as well.

511419,Guest,2001-03-13 03:53:00,0,"Lake of the Prairies is a reasonable drive about 3.5hrs away. Great eye fishery as there is a 18""to28"" slot that have to be sent back. SO you can catch 24"" plus eyes fairly consistently."

511423,Backwater Eddy,2001-03-20 04:06:00,3871,"If it is in early May-June try the Drayton Dam just North of Drayton ND on the Red River. Sauger, Pike, Walleye, and channel catfish should be doing well about then. Backwater Eddy"
