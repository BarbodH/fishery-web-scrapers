511472,Guest,2001-03-14 06:09:00,0,"I am shopping for my first GPS (handheld), with cost being somewhat of an issue. I've researched several, including the eTrex, the Magellan 315, and the Garmin 12. I also see there is a new eTrex, the Venture. My question is: would the basic unit suffice on a larger lake, such as Eagle in NW ON, or is it a good idea to buy up? Can any one share their experiences with these units, or give some advice? Thanks."
511473,Guest,2001-03-14 09:49:00,0,"If cost is an issue, I don't think that you can beat the Garmin 12 for value, and features, for the money. I have used one for the last 3 years on Mille Lacs and also several times on LOW and size or performance has never been an issue."
511474,Guest,2001-03-16 20:39:00,0,"Hey Mark, here's some advice for you. I own two Gps's, a Magellan 300 and an Eagle.I can't recall the model of the eagle, it's out in the garage, but the Eagle is my preferance. It's not because of the make, rather the features that it has that the Magellen doesn't have. I fish up in northern Saskatchewan, and the lakes are very big, full of rocks and confusing, with all the islands that are there. My eagle has the trials feature which is awsome. You just set your waypoint at the lodge, and as you drive the boat it draws a line on a blank screen. When it comes time to head in, you follow your line and it leads you back to the lodge. I've come in, in the dark without getting lost or hitting a rock. My advice is look more for features, like trails, rather than make, as Magellan makes Gps's with trials. One thing that I did notice bad about the Magelln though, was when I had both turned on beside each other, the Magellan took longer to both receive signals and in some cases would not pick up the third satellite. I hope my message helps you."

511477,Guest,2001-03-17 09:04:00,0,"I have an Eagle-Nav and have had pretty good luck with it. Make sure you take lots of extra batteries if you use an Eagle. Two or three sets for a week long trip if you use it a lot. VERY important is to not store it very long with batteries in it. They will go dead in about one month even without any use. The Eagle will do an excellent job to keep you from getting lost using the trail/route features. I would not count on it however to keep you from hitting rocks on the water. The accuracy is just not that good. Try putting it on its most zoomed in mode and just stand still and see how much deviation the plot gives you without moving. This will give you an idea of the accuracy of a given reading with respect to the precision available. The government is always messing with signal reproducability so it does not seem to be consistent over time. Stand in the exact same spot on 30 day intervals and check the readings. You will see what I mean. Overall very good for navigation but will not necessarily put you ""exactly"" on a ""hot spot"" that is not very big.Hope this helps."
511478,Guest,2001-03-17 10:11:00,0,"Mark,I agree with the replys that you have received....I have an Eagle handheld and love it. It is very true that the thing eats batteries like a kid eats candy on Halloween. One word of caution, I bought a cigarette lighter adapter to use on the boat and found out that the charging cycle on the boat electrical system went above 16 volts. It fryed my GPS. I spoke with the engineers at Lowrance/Eagle and they told me that the hand held units do not have voltage protection. I now use a small riding lawnmower battery for my fish finder and GPS and am able to use it for weeks on a single charge. As for acuracy, the US government discontinued the signal jamming last year for GPS so that DGPS is no longer required for accuracy within 10m. GPS units that operate using 5 satelites will yield the same accuracy. Good Luck"
511476,Timmy,2001-03-17 22:14:00,94,I too have an Eagle 5 channel unit about 4 years old. It is sure easier to use than my new mapping unit. Just take a little longer to lock on the Satelites. Mapping is nice but not necessary. Hope this helps.
511479,Guest,2001-03-19 12:42:00,0,"MarkBuy the best Gps your pocket can afford.Garmin ,Lowrance and Magellan all have great units that will do the job any place in the world.More bucks will just buy more features.Any of the mapping GPS's will also be more bucks.The main thing when a person buys a GPS is to read the""MANUAL"". The basics are satellite status,navigation, plotter,and menue .Check out this web for some good info. www.joe.mehaffey.com Don"
