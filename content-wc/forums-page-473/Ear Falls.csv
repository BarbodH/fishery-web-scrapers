1330611,bigdaddy66,2011-07-17 05:39:00,7,We always stop at the Trillium before heading on North. It is clean and good.
1330960,Mohleye,2011-07-18 07:25:00,368,"The Trillium and the 105 both have good food. We stayed at the Trillium last week and got pizza from the place in the little mall in Ear Falls, which was also good. If you're going soon you'd better check on room availability, there are hundreds of firefighters staying in the area and rooms are pretty scarce. We talked tio the group coming in as we were going out Sat AM and they got the last room at the Trillium Friday night."
