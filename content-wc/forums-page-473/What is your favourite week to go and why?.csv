1334568,IaDave,2011-07-27 15:27:00,476,I think it depends on what type of baitfish are in the system- I know in Minnitaki they feed alot on smelt and they tend to stay deep-around 30'. Last year the same week we went into Lac Suel-Vaughn Lake with a guide and we caught them in 5-6' on windy points and also caught some in 15-20' of water on a hump.
1334768,tv4fish,2011-07-28 07:13:00,2694,Thanks Dave -- That's the area we will be in-- kinda sounds like not much different than our latest trip - the last week of June this year.
1335313,GWC,2011-07-29 10:44:00,1021,"About any time I works for me. Unfortunately there is a limit on the number of trips I can make. It's about 1000 mile trip one way for me. So, I make a trip in Mid-June for Spring Walleye and If I'm lucky another in Mid September. Mid June catches the walleye after spawn & usually shallow. Mid September because 1) the fish are feeding for winter 2) we catch a fair number 3) it's a long long time until June."

They have openings from the end of June to the end of August. We have always avoided the last week of June to the 1st week of August due to the mayflies, but some guys say they weren't that bad this year. Your thoughts are appreciated."
1334385,micropterus,2011-07-27 07:11:00,450,Doesn't the hatch depend on the weather?
1334390,wallydave,2011-07-27 07:21:00,2151,"We used to hit the waters of the NW end of Lac Seul the first week of June. June 1st is my boat/cabin buddies birthday, plus it used to be the day they opened up the Sanctuary for fishing. He hurt his back, went back to school and now teaches school. The opening day for the Sanctuary has moved to later in June, plus being a teacher and having a couple of sons along with his wife making the trip North, we have moved our week back until the end of the school year. Things change, the weather and water levels never remain the same, part of fishing is adjusting to changes."
1334410,Mike Kansas,2011-07-27 08:03:00,1463,"We like the first half of June. The Walleye are still shallow have begin schooling up and generally have the feedbag on since the spawn is normally over. During our 25 years on Lac Seul we have also done better size wise during the the first half of June. Good numbers of fish, good size = Good Times. I would also add that late July and early August have produced a lot of big fish for us on Bottom Bouncers with either minnow,crawler or leech. Fishing 20'+ water at that time and spending time on deep ledges and mid lake structure. Mike Kansas"
1334415,Biggerbear,2011-07-27 08:07:00,13,I have been on the English River System just about every possible week over the years. Recently we watched some of the video from the end of June and for sure that is the best time for us. We watched some of the fall video and it was close but the end of June still stands out. If I had to go late in the year it would be the last week of August thru mid September.
1334419,NARDA 1,2011-07-27 08:17:00,636,"We go the week after labor day. The camp is less busy, the weather is cooler and the fishing has been very good."
1334464,IaDave,2011-07-27 09:52:00,476,"If I'm taking my boat after Labor Day to me is best- less boats,bigger fish,cooler weather. The downside side is less daylight and the Fall can be windy. For fly-ins anytime the end of June first part on July."
1334531,new hips,2011-07-27 13:26:00,498,"We fish Lac seul quite a few years, 1st or 2nd week in September was best, no bugs and fish were always in deeper water, and hungry. One year we went the 3rd week in September, it was cold and windy most of the week."
1334534,Mike Borger,2011-07-27 13:49:00,1554,"If I had to pick one specific time frame it would be the last 2 weeks of August.Weather is usually stable. Cool nights, comfortable days and little to no bugs.Walleye are very predictable that time of year as well."
1334561,tv4fish,2011-07-27 15:00:00,2694,"Guys: I'm going to be lucky enough to make a 2nd trip this year and it WILL be the last week of August. I haven't hit Lac Seul at that time of year before. If I may ask - what general depths have been the most successful for you guys for that time of year (understanding that each year may be different, etc.) - just looking for some general tips for that time of year. Thanks in advance."
