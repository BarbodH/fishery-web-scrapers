1335298,Golden Eagle,2011-07-29 10:23:00,2642,We need to give camp owners slack when they seem not to be upgrading equipment and facilities. They're forced to pay bills and live on the rest instead of reinvesting in their operation. It's a major problem if there's a mortgage and it's no fun paying for floatplane service.
1335303,Moondog,2011-07-29 10:32:00,362,"The place we stay at on Gullrock was up this year from the last few but at that the owner says the exchange rate is a killer. Does not have any ""comfort"" money to put in capital building expenses, upgrades etc. My guess is that most resort owners will, by necessity, have to raise their rates to accommodate the falling value of our just recently printed dollar."
1334277,SinOrSwim,2011-07-26 18:56:00,1528,"We changed trips this year. Have been doing a fly-in for the past 17+ years and this year didn't have much interest. Maybe 3 instead of the usual 6 or 8. Changed to a drive-in and we now have like 12 going. I think cost is certainly a factor. But, I also think no contact, no ""real"" electricity and not liking flying factor in as well."
1334297,Rich B,2011-07-26 19:57:00,1081,"My wife and I drove up through the Soo a week ago, and we stopped at the Duty Free heading north and talked with the staff.....I asked them if they had seen many Americans in the store so far this Spring/Summer.....they said no, the number of Americans heading north to camps was way down. They did say that the number of Canadians driving over for beer and smokes was way up, especially considering the current dollar exchange rate. A Canadian at our camp who lives just east of the Soo said he knew a lot of local folks that would cross the border to fill up their vehicles in the US, and to pick up groceries, etc and stop at the Duty Free. We live in east central Ohio.....unemployment is still too high around here, and wages have been flat or fallen over the last few years for much of this area. Between the 13.5 % tax and the .92 cents on the American dollar for exchange, that hurts when it's time to pay the tab (not to say it wasn't the other way for years, though I believe it's one of the major reasons one doesn't see the numbers of Americans heading north as in past years). Another recent post asked where in the USA are there places like Canada.... the majority of the answers came back that really there aren't (outside of the Boundry Waters).....and that's why I'll keep heading north as long as the Good Lord allows. Rich B"
1334310,Guest,2011-07-26 20:29:00,0,"In addition to the exchange rate and the 13% tax, the price of gas, food, lodging and booze is high when compared with US. They have a policy that you can't bring in bait. It sells there for a premium (the place we stay counts each and every minnow). They should be giving us free bait for all the amount of money that we spend there. Anyone know of any good places on the US side of LOW?"
1334314,dutchboy,2011-07-26 20:41:00,5717,Nope........all the resorts charge there to.
1334364,tigerjohn1554,2011-07-27 05:41:00,77,It's called the trickle down effect.Kind of like those bumper stickers that read: LOST YOUR JOB YET? KEEP BUYING FOREIGN.
1334478,Freytown,2011-07-27 10:37:00,770,Travel is down for all types of vacations...not just fishing trips toCanada. So in a nut shell there are many businesses hurting this summer.http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/...76E54Z20110715
1334501,Northern Exposure,2011-07-27 11:37:00,29,They must keep records of the # of non res ontario fishing licenses sold. Anyone know where to find such info? It would be interesting to see how much it has slowed compared to 5 years ago.
1335197,Guest,2011-07-29 06:46:00,0,"Yea, but not as much!"
1335223,downriverbob,2011-07-29 07:50:00,880,"Cost for resorts are also getting worse for the people who run them, ask the people who run Ontario resorts about new provincial policies about how they must filter water supplies. The cost of these systems are very costly for smaller resorts and business that are in the area. BOB"
1335259,Obabikon,2011-07-29 09:16:00,2370,"Exchange rate and cost of food/fuel have hampered resorts all over Canada. It's very difficult to stay in the black when all your expenses go up 20% or more from last year... then add the fact that if you didn't raise your prices 20% from last year, you're making less money per person. It's a tough year, even if traffic is up... which I'm not sure it is."
1334063,LOW1,2011-07-26 10:13:00,2828,My sense from my trips this year is that there are at least a few more people travelling to the Lake of the Woods area and that they are spending more money and are in better moods. Am I correct on this? What is happening in other areas?
1334079,campchick,2011-07-26 10:32:00,96,"Well, I would have to say that business is down across the board. Depending on the kind of establishment you have, some outfitters are worse off than others. Hardest hit seem to be the fly in American Plan resorts, followed by the fly in outposts. From what I hear, the drive in camps are not doing too bad. Some of my guests drove highways 502 and 105 in the last week and reported seeing no other vehicles and it was Saturday. There should have been a bunch of other travelers. It seems business is not good and not looking much better for next year. For someone wanting to get into this lifestyle - lots of resorts will be available this fall."
1334134,Aaron-IN,2011-07-26 12:40:00,500,I drove to Canada for the first time in a while via Int. Falls and could not believe how few people there were at the border and all the fishing communities up to Kenora. Can't imagine things are good for resort owners.
1334147,Ogoki,2011-07-26 13:09:00,291,"I flew in out of Pickle Lake late May this spring with some friends . Two cars in parking lot when we went in and three when we came out . Got home on Sunday evening from that trip and my wife and I left for Armstrong Thursday morning for our trip. Parking lot was pretty full. Mentioned to outfitter that the lot looked pretty good and he said he did much charter flying and many of the vehicles was for that . Said July was going to be slow . Did not see the cars and trucks on the raod driving around Lake Superior like we saw ten years ago . Seems like less every year . That being said how can the higher dollar trips be all that busy . The younger guys with a family cannot afford these trips . In the mid eighties I along with friends could do a fly-in trip for a weeks pay . That even included splitting up the gas too. From my church and from the town where we live ,I counted up there were 54 paid fly-in trips to the Armstrong area around 1990 . Many guys took two trips . Many of those guys are either dead or too bad of health to make that trip. Many of my friends now have kids in college or they lost so much in their retirements that they now take canoe or camping trips . I hate to sound like doom and gloom but I don't see it any other way at least from here . I work my tail off and live on the cheap side just so I can still save for retirement and still go North fishing and bear hunting . In fact I hate to admit it but, much of my awake hours are spent thinking about past and future trips ."
1334157,wolverine fan,2011-07-26 13:31:00,71,Another reason is airfares. I didnt go to minaki for the first time in years because i couldnt get a plane ticket for under $650. I have never paid over $450 in the past years and then they were going to charge me another $100 for rod carriers each way! I never even checked car rental cause i couldnt afford to fly.
1334182,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-26 14:30:00,1460,"Over the years, I've definately noticied a sharp drop in fellow American anglers. Used to be you couldn't go into the Harborage and not think you were at a fish shirt convention. The hotels are barely half full during prime time when you had to get reservations years in advance. This year in June I spent an extra day in Ft.Francis. I really expected to see more sportsman than I did. Very disapointing. Pretty soon your favorite hotel or outfitter could be closed!I guess we lost a generation or two of anglers along our busy way. Smaller brotherhood of what we hold dear in our Canadian fishing adventures."
1334194,Freytown,2011-07-26 14:49:00,770,"Fuel cost & currency exhange raised this years cost too. US$ dollar only gets you .94 cents...and that's the bank rate, be lucky to get .90 cents. Facts of life is a US$ doesn't go very far these days.Let's pray it doesn't get any worst."
1334228,lcwhit,2011-07-26 16:32:00,104,"this is third or fourth year of this. my wife and i fished steamboat second week of july and saw one other boat in maybe 4 hours. beautiful day and little wind. not many people up there anymore. one of the little grocery stores in ear falls is closed. strange thing though, we thought the prices weren't that much higher than home. young people ar working more, making less and paying more for the essentials like food and gasoline. too little money left to save for a trip i guess. tough economies on both sides of border. i'm just looking forward to my next trip in mid august. can't wait again."
1334241,jaggersr,2011-07-26 17:13:00,44,"The camps I go to are pretty much business as usual. No surprize because both have an excellent reputation and repeat clientel. My buddies bear camp was 100% full on repeats at the end of last season. However, when we traveled the first week of June to Chapleau from Indiana. We noticed a significant reduction of both boats, trailers with ATV, campers and traffic in general along I75 through the UP to the Soo. My belief is that the diehards will find a way."
1334270,drew59,2011-07-26 18:39:00,87,"My wife and I go twice a year near Armstrong. It's definately down the last couple of years. Not sure why except people are scared. The trip is still a good value, all things considered. There are good, remote drive to resorts that are much cheaper than flying in."
