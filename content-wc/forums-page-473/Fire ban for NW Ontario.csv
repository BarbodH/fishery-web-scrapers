1331809,jignminow,2011-07-20 05:19:00,168,"we use single burner propane stoves. The burner screws onto the top of a small tank and a base snaps on the bottom of it.....just right for your 14"" skillet. We take two and put the bean pot on the other....1 more day!!!!"
1331863,Mohleye,2011-07-20 07:36:00,368,"You can use the traditional 2 burner Coleman just fine. We just did last week. You don't need to use the back and wind screens if they get in the way, just leave them flat."

1334715,DavKin,2011-07-28 04:46:00,104,According to Viking Island Outposts the fire ban has been lifted. Shore lunch is back.
1334815,Fishoil,2011-07-28 08:09:00,1277,"As of yesterday the fireban was lifted in NW Ontario. There are still travel restrictions north of Pickle Lake and on the Albany River. This is copied from the MNR website: Northwest Region... The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources has ended the Restricted Fire Zone previously imposed in the Northwest Region. Outdoor fires are allowed, but people are asked to use extreme caution. If you are in an organized municipality or First Nations community, check with local fire officials before having an outdoor fire as there may be bans or local bylaws in place. Emergency Area Orders are in place over fires in the Sioux Lookout District with travel restrictions on roadways and lakes. Check here for information on the Emergency Area Orders. There were no new fires in the Region on July 27 as of 16:00CST."
1330872,cruiseforever,2011-07-17 20:26:00,177,Fire ban in place. Have attached link.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...ge/240351.html
1330881,elway12,2011-07-17 20:41:00,335,Just got back from a week on Lake Savant and we could smell and see a haze of smoke almost everyday. Heard that there are numerous fires all over Ontario - A shame. Hopefully they can be contained/put out.
1330890,Outfitter17,2011-07-17 21:04:00,127,"The Fire Ban is only for Zones 1,2, and 3 in Nw ontario - not all of NW ontario. Everything just north of kenora, just north of dryden, and just south of Sioux lookout all the way down to the US border are not in the fire ban zone."
1330901,EddieNorth,2011-07-17 21:34:00,32,"We have had a few days you could smell the smoke good,Our camp is on the Attawapiskat,,Beteau Lake,,,we have a fire north of us,south of us and west of us,looked bad yesterday but today things cleared up,We could sure use some rain up here the river is very very low,good news is the fish are easy to find. Cheers Everyone, Eddie"
1330971,JayM5209,2011-07-18 07:46:00,1050,The MNR's map of current fires is here.http://forest.lrc.gov.on.ca/AFFM/fir...ap_English.htm
1331207,Guest,2011-07-18 15:04:00,0,"I always seem to get confused when it comes to ""burn bans"" as the restrictions seem to fluctuate. According to an article today in the Kenora Daily Miner and News ""In a Restricted Fire Zone, all burning permits are suspended and all open fires are prohibited. Campfires may be allowed at some organized campgrounds or parks that use approved fire pits and meet certain other criteria."" I'm heading north tomorrow. I'm pretty sure we'll be clear of the RFZ but, if it's extended south, my question is in an RFZ can a person do a shore lunch on a non-park lake? If so, what fuel is allowed? As always, we'll be extremely careful where ever we are no matter what the tinder conditions! We just want to know what the rules are since I can't seem to find them online. JustCurious"
1331305,Hawkfan,2011-07-18 18:05:00,237,"Holy cow! Is that number of active fires accurate? Is this number of fires common in a dry year? We have flown into Gull Lake the last dozen years and last year there was a fire that had to be put out by plane the day we left (disclaimer...on the opposite end of the lake from where we were), but that was the closest I have been to that situation. And I guess by close I mean we were there the same day. Probably wouldn't have known anything about it if video wasn't posted on our outfitter's website. But I pull up the website posted here and there are red balloons everywhere."
1331315,JayM5209,2011-07-18 18:33:00,1050,"Hawkfan, you can click on any of the balloons and it will show the status of that particular fire. Also, scroll down the page to get to info below the map. It shows how many fires are active, how many (by region) year-to-date, etc.Over the past 32 years I've been ""evacuated"" (ordered to leave the area) twice because of fires approaching the camp we were at. Incidentally, the fastest evening of lake trout fishing I ever experienced was the day before being evacuated. The smoke was so thick you couldn't see a quarter mile across the water. Six people in three boats caught probably 50 lakers in two hours time. Stuff memories are made of."
1331340,hoosiercanadian,2011-07-18 19:39:00,104,"Just Curious, you might want to take a camp stove up with you if you are going to prepare any shore lunches."
1331807,DavKin,2011-07-20 05:06:00,104,The fire ban has me looking at camp stoves. Will a 14 in skillet fit on a Coleman two burner or should I be looking at the ones without a back & side wind screens?
