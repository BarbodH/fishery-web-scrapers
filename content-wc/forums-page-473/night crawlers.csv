1334443,bryhardt,2011-07-27 09:03:00,11,Thanks for the information. I will definitely stop by there. Two more days before heading out... finishing up packing now.
1333397,outdoorsron,2011-07-24 15:54:00,843,"Hello: Just wanted to know if anybody buys their night crawlers at Rainy Lake Sports and tackle in Fort Francis, Ont. Just wanted to know about the quality of the bait. Going up to Gull Rock and thought I would get bait and licenses at one stop. Thank You O R"
1333489,Steve of Madison,2011-07-24 21:00:00,230,"That's where I buy mine, trouble this year was the water temps in the lake made my minnow bucket and leech bag a killing field. With surface temps in the 70's, throwing your minnow bucket or leech container overboard just shocks and kills them.Keep them on board and add some ice to your containers thoughout the day."
1333500,jkwildhunting,2011-07-24 21:32:00,361,Getting a Flat of crawlers local in Canadian bedding may be cheaper then getting couple 10-20 dozen in canada.I see your from Iowa if you have group members from Des Moines I know johnston bait does flats of canadian crawlers. Easiest way to go IMO if you have the room and time!
1333580,Eyes_R_Us,2011-07-25 07:50:00,66,I'm also a satisfied Johnston Bait customer. Darcy has been making up my Canada packs for 9 years now. I don't suppose your route brings you over this way but if by chance you are going I80 to I35 it would only be a few minutes out of your way to stop there. They are easy to find from the interstate. Call them a few days ahead of time and they will have it in the cooler waiting for you. I use a styrofoam shipping container for my crawlers. I wrap about three frozen 20oz water bottles in paper towel and throw them on top. Keeps the crawlers happy until I get to camp and can freeze up a few more bottles.
1333666,PARAJOHN,2011-07-25 11:52:00,15,Sportsmans Service in I.Falls also carries crawlers for Canada. You can look them up on the web and contact them for pricing.
1333978,Mohleye,2011-07-26 07:29:00,368,"We buy a flat at Four Seasons in Ear Falls when we stop for licenses. The last time I checked pricing it was about the same cost as the states. Crawlers seem to be a little livlier and in better shape when we arrive than they were when we brought from the states, no matter how much we tried to babysit them. Steve of Madison....we keep both crawlers and leeches in plastic containers with screw tops and keep in the cooler, especially in hot weather. Then each guy has a empty Skoal tin to keep a few for immediate use. This helps so the cooler isn't getting opened constantly. We are remote and ice is a valuable commodity. Not much you can do with minnows in hot weather. Luckily that seems to be when crawlers work best anyway."
1334208,davenathe,2011-07-26 15:18:00,113,"Picked ours up and Fort Frances and what a mistake. $70 for a bag (that is about $80+ U.S. with tax, yes a bag not a flat. Never again, have always picked up in Dryden but wanted to bring some leeches this year so stopped in Fort Frances."
1334213,bryhardt,2011-07-26 15:38:00,11,"I was planning on picking up crawlers at Bobby's in Vermillion Bay this Saturday on my way to gull rock. I have never been in there, so if there are any other suggestions I would be curious also to know. Thanks"
1334225,jkwildhunting,2011-07-26 16:18:00,361,"bryhardt,I would suggest just going up to 5 season spots in Ear Falls and gettin your crawlers. They seem to have alot better selection of live bait then at Bobbys. Most guys will stay away from Bobby because of his ""sense of Humor"""
1334392,Mohleye,2011-07-27 07:26:00,368,I would also recommend Four Seasons in Ear Falls. I paid $68.00 for a flat of 500 a few weeks ago and they were very nice crawlers. If you are wanting a flat or 1/2 flat they might need some advance notice. Their email is [email protected].
