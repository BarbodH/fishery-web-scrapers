1334031,Babamel2,2011-07-26 09:20:00,414,Would you vote for candidates who promise cutting taxes. There is a movement to shut down many airports in small markets they say it is for tax reasons. however there could be other motives
1334065,dutchboy,2011-07-26 10:14:00,5717,"The number and amount of the subsides won't change no matter if they close 100 small airports or 1000. Congress has agreed to take care of the airline industry, I want the airline industry to take care of us.As far as electing officials.............ours are just as corrupt as any other country so I see no point in addressing that."
1334244,lcwhit,2011-07-26 17:19:00,104,"the feds subsidize these small airports/airlines to the tune of 60 million per year. american airlines alone had revenues of 23 billion in the last 12 months and managed to lose about 400 million dollars in the same period. the federal subsidies are hardly a major consideration in determining how many routes to serve and how many to close down. i doubt that the industry would notice if congress were to pull the plug entirely. to them, its all about the price of fuel. 60 million wouldnt buy 3 planes. american just signed a deal to buy 460 new fuel efficient planes."
1333356,rpieske,2011-07-24 12:42:00,1276,"Delta just announced that it was giving 90 days notice of stopping flights to 24 small cities, including International Falls, MN. This will be a major blow to this community. Hopefully, some other airline will pick them up. The tourist industry up here really didn't need this added problem."
1333497,skindzier,2011-07-24 21:20:00,137,"That really stinks. I flew in there a couple times when it was Northwest. I think another airline will pick it up, but I'll bet there's a price hike."
1333532,dogrodder,2011-07-25 05:47:00,400,Delta dropped our town as well. Hopefully another airline will pick it up.
1333590,ziemann,2011-07-25 08:42:00,641,"Yep- Brainerd, MN was dropped as well. That wouldn't be as big of a deal since we used to be able to go to St. Cloud close by...but that was dropped a year ago as well.... It it now 2 hours to Duluth, Fargo, or Minneapolis to catch a flight.... Delta is definitely off of my Christmas list..."
1333594,dutchboy,2011-07-25 08:57:00,5717,"Come on guys, we all knew that when Delta bought Northwest this would happen. First job was to break the unions. Second, add charges for everything and reduce services to nothing more then getting a seat. Next, shut down small terminals. Fourth, drop Mpls as a hub.These are more corporate pigs who think of nothing but their own bottom lines."
1333624,Aaron-IN,2011-07-25 10:03:00,500,"If you are use to flying into International Falls while heading North to fish you might try flying to Winnipeg. You dont have to deal with the long wait at the border (at times) and Kenora is only a few hours away by rental car. Very easy to get in and out of, I've been doing it for years."
1333697,Guest,2011-07-25 13:02:00,0,"Corporate pigs is right on!! How dare they try to make a profit by closing in places Brianerd & Bemidji and IF. Those pigs, we should demand they keep them open no matter how unprofitable they are."
1333758,dutchboy,2011-07-25 15:33:00,5717,"Feel free to register. The airlines are subsidized millions to provide air travel to the citizens of the U.S. at a affordable cost. If my tax dollars are going to the airlines I want them to service the smaller cities. If they want to decline the subsidy fine, then do what you want."
1333833,joeman79,2011-07-25 19:17:00,417,AMEN Dutchboy!! Maybe it's Mushmouth? LOL
1333876,Guest,2011-07-25 20:49:00,0,maybe we don't need to pay millions to subsize air travel from remote these locations. just a thought
