I will be fishing on Minnitaki July 30 - Aug. 4. I am very familiar with Minnitaki as I have fished it numerous times in May and June. Am very familiar with Rice creek, Red Pine Bay and the English River so I know my way around. I assume that fishing this time of year will be quite different. Can anyone familiar with Minnitaki suggest some spots to fish as well as depths. We will have jigs, crawlers/spinners and bottom bouncers. Thanks!"

Was the last of June and thru July 10th and the fish had not moved to Abram chute aend yet. Some but not many. Water was okay at 68 degrees to 70 the day before I left. Lac Seul had fis relating to weeds in shallow water and tems were about the same. I might suggest that you try the bottom bouncers in 15 to 25' then go shallow if you cannot locate. This late in the year you could troll with artificials too if it stays warm. Look for smaller humps, sunken islands ect and sharp drop offs as usual. You might even try cast towards shore to see whats there especially iof there are any weeds. Fish should be more scattered but once you find them don't use up all your toes and fingers counting them. Have fun and please post upon your return how things went for you, Jim"

1335474,BenBeattie,2011-07-29 17:46:00,232,"Minnitaki in August... humps, reefs and island points with deep water and a good drop off. Main lake basin stuff 20-35'. Late July, August and Sept are my fav. months on Minnitaki. You should be able to find lots of fish. Have fun!"
