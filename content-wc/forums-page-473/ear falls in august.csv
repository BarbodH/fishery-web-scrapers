Will be staying just south of you on Cedar. The lakes we fish around there the fish are usually right on the weed edges or a little deep off of the rocks. Seems if you find them in an area on one lake that time of year they are in the exact same area on all of the lakes(we try to fish a different lake everyday).Normal weather I would say is in the 70's and lows in the upper 40's from my experience but can range widely of course. Take gloves to shorts.If you have any other questions you can PM me I am glad to share.

The past 3 years we have made a second trip the middle of August. We have found that you need to check all depths on a daily basis. One year we were told to fish deep and found them stacked on a point in shallow (3'-10') water on a hot calm day. We've had luck along weed beds one day and found they had moved deep the next. Generally, our August trips have produced more and larger walleyes than our July trips. We also are leaving for the Ear Falls area on the 12th. Where are you staying?"
