1333087,joeman79,2011-07-23 12:09:00,417,"Had friends that stayed there last year. Well I guess that is always a risk in the wilderness, hope no one was there?? How did you find out about it? I looked on fire map and saw there was a fire southwest of the lake. Wishing the great folks at NWO the best luck!! Sorry for their loss."
1333098,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-23 12:46:00,1460,"Joeman,I was talking with Vic this morning as I'm concidering a fall trip. Those boys are running on empty and now with all the evacuations. You know they are doing their part. This is very bad for them what with Richardson, Birch, Okanse, Mink right there as well. The Carillion camp was a big camp held 10 easy. Hard to replace that.Joeman, I've seen some of your posts. I've seen your blue walleye. All very impressive. I'm pleased to know that we have fished some of the same waters with NWO!"
1333103,joeman79,2011-07-23 13:05:00,417,"Yeah they have a few camps right in that area, hope to goodness that they get some rain and QUICK! Hate it for them and all their guests as well. NOt a fun deal. We are using a different outfitter this year, as NWO had no opening to lakes I wanted to go to when I made my reservation. Currently there are no fires very close to where we are going and Pray that they stay away, leaving thursday. Just called my buddy that went to Carillon last year and he said he was gonna call Vic and Doug also. He has used them for YEARS. I want to book a trip to Wabi and Granite in the future with them. I love the shorter drive!"
1333166,J.Iverson,2011-07-23 16:48:00,64,I can't imagine how that will screw up the rest of their summer. I imagine Lil Shab is empty now to. So sad
1333173,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-23 17:20:00,1460,I saw that a little rain went through Ignace today. Too far south to do that area any good.Have you been to Carrillion J? It really looked like an awesome cabin and lake.
1333195,joeman79,2011-07-23 18:36:00,417,No but Buddy said it was a sweet place and nice big cabin. praying for rain!
1333248,J.Iverson,2011-07-23 23:45:00,64,"I stopped in there once on a flight out to pick up some people. I went in the cabin, it was very nice. It was actually one on our list to try."
1334185,Mohleye,2011-07-26 14:31:00,368,"J. Not sure what you mean by Little Shab being empty, but if you mean burned down, the fire was well to the east. Little Shab should be fine, at least from that fire."
