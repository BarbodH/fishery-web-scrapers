1334239,Paul H,2011-07-26 17:12:00,1232,"Been nearly 10 years, but used to go that area every year. Mid. Aug. is the latest I was ever there. PM me if you want any more."
1334249,FrankLeigh,2011-07-26 17:32:00,80,"Hey Deputydog,If I am not mistaken, Horseshoe Island is near Matatchewan, which would make it about 35 miles NE of Gowganda. What is Horseshoe Island like?"
1334303,Rich B,2011-07-26 20:03:00,1081,"I fished at a camp where I met two men that fished Horseshoe Camp/lake, and they both spoke highly of the fishery....though their comments about that fishery go back about 10 years, they both fished it until one purchased his own camp and his friend joined him at the new camp (where I met them). For what's it worth..... Rich"
1334386,deputy dog,2011-07-27 07:13:00,305,"we went to horseshoe numerous times in the late 80's early 90's when we were less experienced in productive canada style fishing. the camp was great with really nice cabins and good staff. we took our own boats and they had a pontoon to shuttle our gear to camp, which is located on an island. that being said, we were there more for the getaway than the fishing. dont get me wrong, we fished hard just the wrong way to be successful. we had fish frys but had to work for them. the owner at that time had 2 huge white fluffy dogs at camp and he helped out however he could. remember lots of rocks.....some were marked some werent. buddy of mine ripped whole lower unit off his new bass rig one year. biggest thing that sticks out is cabins were great fishing not so much. they have a website with info and prices seem very reasonable. we have moved on to fly-in trips and honed our fishing skills. good luck in your search,i hope this helped!"
1334439,ohiojmj,2011-07-27 08:48:00,1262,"Been to Horseshoe Island Camp twice back in late 90's. Hmmm, remember a bass boat blazing through a narrow section with rocks while heading up to the chutes at the top of lake. Fishing in late May both times was tough, bet we were no experienced fishermen either. Based on my current knowledge and memory of that lake (Mistinikon), I'd rate it as average. HIC was decent for no electricty and using propane, camp owner couple were helpful, white dogs were cool. the other camp looked so so on maintenance. There are some cottages on the lake, not many. We could have used a few more weed beds, but there was plenty at bottom of lake and in a few bays. While not overly packed with shoals, the ones we found held lotsa fish. Biggest pike was 36"", mostly in the low-mid twenties. Lotsa small walleye under 16"" slot limit, but we hammered a bunch in the 24"" range. Would I go back now? Maybe. For the distance driven, I'd prefer to go back to Lac Remigny in Quebec which after 5 trips. I believe is a better fishery for pike while I didn't try hard for walleye on that lake."
