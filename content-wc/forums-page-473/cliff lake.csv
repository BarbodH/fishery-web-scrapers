Also, any opinions/experiences on cliff lake would be greatly appreciated. I usually fish canyon and really enjoy it. I'm just looking to try some different water.regardsSammy"

Always fish Cliff at least one full day each time I'm there. It's one of my favorite lakes - lakers, big walleyes, smallies. The big walleyes are cisco feeders and roam suspended over deep water. There have been discussions of Cliff Lake in the past. Use the Search function on this forum and you'll pull up lots of helpful info.P.S. I spend my time of Cliff fishing for the lakers and haven't worked it hard specifically for 'eyes. But, my personal best 'eye came from Cliff while trolling for lakers, as did my son's and that of one of my frequent boat partners."
