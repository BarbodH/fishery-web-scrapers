1333096,joeman79,2011-07-23 12:41:00,417,Ok it has been awhile since there was a thread about beer and I am leaving in 5 DAYS!!!!!!!!!!!! And want to try a couple new Canadian Beers. My favorites are Kokanee and Alexander Kieth's IPA. I pre-ordered a bunch of that along with a couple cases of Sleeman's. You Beer Lovers out there give me your suggestions for a couple new ones to try. Have a group of 12 so will have a nice Beer Tasting panel. Thanks

1333253,F250,2011-07-24 05:54:00,75,I live 1 mile from the Quebec border. Labatt's 50 is my favorite. I'll be stopping at the Duty Free store in four days and loading up for our week at Poutrincourt Outfitters.

1333631,labsrus,2011-07-25 10:20:00,557,Spent a week at a fly-in and we had the standard Molsons and labatts Head back for a drive in trip On Friday We will be getting some Steam Whistle and some Molson M Should be good
1333729,FrankLeigh,2011-07-25 14:33:00,80,"Creemore is a good small brewery, not available everywhere, though. My favourite is COLD !"
1335041,Bigfishhunter,2011-07-28 16:26:00,803,"Try Big Rock or Fort Garry. Fort Garry is tough to get outside manitoba as it is a winnipeg based beer. My all time favorite beer is Fort Garry Dark, smoothest dark beer I have ever had."
1335133,downriverbob,2011-07-28 20:58:00,880,Molson Golden and Molson Export Ale. BOB
1335153,5 of Diamonds,2011-07-28 22:26:00,151,"Molson's new M. WOW! What a beer! Perhaps the best beer I've ever drank. Other beer near the top of my list are Molson Canadian, Molson Golden, Yuengling Lager, Shiner Bock & Yuengling Premium."
