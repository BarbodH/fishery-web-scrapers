There's lot's of great camps or lodges that offer family packages and swimming pools, beaches, etc....and some that are fishing camps that have a playground, etc...... If you let us know where home is for you and how far you want to drive (with your family and kids), a lot of the folks will help you out with suggestions.....just saying that Ontario (I'm thinking you're looking for suggestions in Ontario) is one big province. I think it's great you're looking to take your family up north......I did for years, and my adult children have some great memories from their younger days vacationing up north and my son loves to fish (the girls not so much - ha - but they do love being on the water). Faith, Family, Friends......and Fishing. Rich B"

There are TV's in the newer cabins, WiFi, and there is a nice swim beach for small kids on the river. The older kids can swim by the docks.My kids are 13, 13, and 15. They loved it, and they caught lots of fish. Timberlane was well run, and very hospitable hosts and staff.Scott"
