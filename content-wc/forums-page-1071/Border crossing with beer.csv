507876,Guest,2000-05-24 05:09:00,0,"I believe it boils down to saving a few dollars. As a local in NW Ontario it bothers a lot of us that some US fisherman take everything from home.It puts nothing into the economy of the area where people are trying to make a living off the resource. You'll have a better experience in this area and make some friends if you drop a few dollars, even if it is more expensive. Frank"
507877,Guest,2000-05-24 15:51:00,0,"Frank makes a good point about supporting the local economy. Anything to help relations would be a plus.I've been going to NW Ontario for 25 years. I've only missed two years with the birth of our children. I look forward to it all year. Some of my fondest memories have been of visiting with locals in tackle stores and pubs. Truly a friendlier bunch of people would be hard to find.It's too bad the Provincial Ministries always try to regulate behaviors with vinegar instead of honey. While slots have certainly been a boon and their success is being duplicated south of the border, other punitive measures regarding limits if you didn't stay at a Canadian Resort, buying bait on the northern side, no beer in the boat and a host of other changes over the years, while often well-intentioned, have left a bad taste in many visitor's mouths, as well as negative impacts for the Canadian businesses they were designed to protect.Anything we can do to disprove the perception of the meat-hog, cheap skate, know-it-all American is worth doing to ensure the experiences many of us have treasured over the years will be there for duplication by our children.Sorry about the soap box. But it pains me to read some of the bashing posts from both sides. Anyone close enough to it knows both sides benefit from each other."

507863,badgereyes,2000-05-14 15:35:00,1,"My first Ontario fishing trip occurs in two weeks with 5 other guys. Anyone know what the duty is on beer greater than the 1 case you can take across. We are wondering if it's cheaper paying the duty or what. Also, since we are crossing the border on 5/27/00 which is Memorial weekend, am I better to go thru Pigeon River instead of Fort Frances? Any help is appreciated."
507864,Guest,2000-05-14 20:36:00,0,"Take your case of beer, but then try some Canadian beer. It is good,it makes the locals happy and you too!If you page down a couple of pages in this forum, you will see a discussion on favorite Canadian brews.Enjoy,Fritz"
507865,MP35,2000-05-14 20:52:00,19,Some years back we had extra cases of beer and the duty was like 4.00 can p/case. Still alot cheaper than what beer cost up there!
507866,Guest,2000-05-15 05:01:00,0,"Why not buy from the locals? They make a living off of the people who use the resource. Drink the Canadian beer, it's excellant and about $30.00 Can. a case of 24. Good fishing: Frank"
507867,Guest,2000-05-15 11:45:00,0,"You can take 1 case per person or 1 liter of alcohol. Take 1 case of beer, but if you need more get some Canadian beer. It cost more, but it is better! Try Blue!!!"
507868,RMB,2000-05-15 17:27:00,251,"Canadien beer is by far better beer. If you buy at the duty free store at the border and pay duty on it, it will still be cheaper than buying it outright once across the border. Actually they usually run some sort of discount on quantities at the duty free store anyway. Last year we got 2 free cases with the purchase of 20 + the price was discounted. All said and done, we only paid $18.00 a case for Labatts Blue and Molson Golden. Great price! Also, the Canadien beer is stronger so you get more bang for the buck. Have fun!"
507869,GetTheNet,2000-05-17 20:07:00,29,"If you do not get to Fort Frances by 9-10AM, you will be in a 2-3 mile line waiting to cross the border. Never been to Pigeon River, so I can not comment.I agree with others. Spend some cash with the locals. It may be cheaper to pay the duty, but what is your time worth? Having extra beer is sure to delay you at the border. I prefer to go through as invisible as possible.RB"
507870,Guest,2000-05-18 07:37:00,0,"each person is allowed to take 5 cases per person, 1 is duty free, we have been going to canada for the last 15 yrs. It is cheaper to do it this way and saves time. If possible try going over the border between 12am and 3am,less traffic and headaches."
507871,Guest,2000-05-19 13:22:00,0,whats the fine per case?
507872,Guest,2000-05-22 00:00:00,0,"anyone know what the fines per ""overage"" case of beer that are not claimed, but found, during a search/rape?"
