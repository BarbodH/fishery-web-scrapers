I'll be staying on Cliff the Last week of June and would like to try Cedar for Walleyes. How's the walleye population and what are the best techniques to use? Any locations I should try? I'm fairly knowledgeable about Cliff Lake but walleye fishing is always marginal. I'm hoping Cedar may be the place to go for more quantity. I'm satisfied with quality of walleyes from Cliff but looking for a place to go for more fish. I'm hoping someone can give me advice for Cedar that will improve numbers. Sounds like I'm a meat hawg, but that's not the case. We practice catch and release except for table fare. Please advise."

Also try around Gull island on the east side of the lake and the usual all points. Try getting out early to beat the resort traffic and move deeper as the day goes on. You can motor to perrauilt lake from cedar and there are several good areas as you enter perrauilt. The large rock area known as whaleback rock. I prefer perrauilt to cedar. Don't be afraid to fish spots that do not have all the pressure.Good FishingKurt"
