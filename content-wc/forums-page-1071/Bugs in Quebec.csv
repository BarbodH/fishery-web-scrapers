507970,sweg,2000-05-20 06:37:00,7,I am headed to the Kipawa area of Quebec the first week of June and was wondering what to expect in the way of annoying insects. I've been to the area in May and the black flies and mosquitos were bearable but I'm wondering what it's like in early June? Any advice on dealing with these pests???
507971,Guest,2000-05-20 06:44:00,0,hi Sweg fished this area for 25 years great area for fishing what camp are you staying at or are you camping the flies will be bad in june to thats when we go so take all your bug dope you will need it good luck Al
507972,sweg,2000-05-20 10:10:00,7,more than likely we will be further back the Manowauke(sp?)Trail at Lac La Guarde. We camp out in tents (do it yourself trip). Do you find any particular repelant to be better than the others??How about the use of a head net??
507973,Guest,2000-05-22 10:07:00,0,hi Sweg i dont no the area you are going in to we stay at red pine chute nice spot we all have those bug jackets which work real well my dad has the head net he seems to like it but i dont use them so good luck
507974,sweg,2000-05-22 13:23:00,7,Fished near the chute last year but water levels were very low. And there was some sort of restriction on fishing right at the chute. We made a few friends that lived there during the summer (they were from Altoona PA). we hope to hit the chute again this year too.
507975,Guest,2000-05-23 03:46:00,0,hi Sweg we put our boats in below the chute and go down the lake to the camp we fish at the chute once inawhile but found the fish smaller inthat area that is a santuray untill the 15th of june from the bridge down to the signs i am from ont how about yourself
507976,Guest,2000-05-23 06:06:00,0,"I am from harrisburg, PA. I think we are mostly going to fish Lac La Guarde. Last year we cought most of our largest Walleye there. Its a hard lake to get a boat into and we saw 1 other boat in 4 days of fishing there....plus we camp on a small island where we arn't bothered by bears!!"
507977,Guest,2000-05-23 18:34:00,0,Sounds like a good trip its good to getaway from the city even if you catch fish or not but in this area you usually catch all the fish you want have a good trip
