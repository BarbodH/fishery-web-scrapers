507881,Guest,2000-05-22 16:56:00,0,"I was up for opening week. The weather at times did not cooperate. We stayed,and fished near the Ouse River. Fishing was slow. Most walleye we caught was on lindy rigs. We trolled a lot, and blue rapalas and husky jerks produced the best for smallies,and pan fish and a few walleyes. Most of the walleye we caught was in 14' water between the deep and shallow weed beds.Good luck,LindyRigger"
