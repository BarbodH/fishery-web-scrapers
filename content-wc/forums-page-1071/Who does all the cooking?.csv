When we go to LOTW we sometimes have 20+ guy's, the rule for dinner is: the boat that has the Cook goes in about an hour early, every one in that boat is a cooks helper (the people change every day). Dinner is served at an agreed time say 6:30, the last boat load in for dinner does dishes. I do the shore lunch every day (fry the fish) so I usually don't do any other cooking but I can get hooked for dinner dishes.When I had smaller groups up to my cabin, I also did all the shopping and cooking but never any clean up, in fact the guy's usually would not let me do any cleaning even if I wanted to! I totaled up how much I spent for food & they all chipped in to pay, for some reason they alway gave me more than I spent. The rule also was you brought your own beer or drinks and snacks to share, Well again after every one left there was usually a twelve pack or two left for the host. I know this was a little long winded and a little off the subject but I just wanted to tell everyone what a great bunch of guy's I fish with!"

507938,Guest,2000-05-24 04:34:00,0,"Guys, reading all these posts makes me hungry. And glad I found this slice of heaven. Others that don't go to Canada don't know what they're missing. ANYWAY, first year 4 of us went to the Old Post in Ontario (Lake St. Joseph), we were on the plan where you bring your own food and cook for yourself in fully equipped cabin. The camp owner called several weeks before we were to arrive, said he had a larger group that he'd like to have use our cabin, and asked if if would be ok if the camp put us on the American plan providing our meals for free, in exchange for us moving to a smaller cabin that had no cooking facilities, just a refrigerator. We said fine, and man, that was the best move we ever made. The food at this place is just super (you can check it out at www.oldpost.com), and we've gotten the American plan ever since. Cost isn't wildly different than bringing your own, and all you do is show up, and eat. No prep, no clean-up. More time on the water, etc. We usually get a guide who takes care of the shore lunch, and when we have no guide they send us out with our choice of a shore lunch kit or bag lunches. This year we will have 9 guys. And my nine year old son Spence is coming! YAHOO! Good luck on the water. John."
507926,Guest,2000-05-18 10:55:00,0,"On our first trip a few years ago I somehow became the designated cook for our group. I'm curious who else has been given K.P. status for their trips? I do the menu planing, the grocery shopping and then the cooking while we're in Camp. I'm proud to say that all of us leave Canada a few pounds heavier than when we arrived. I am not proud to say that I'm still not getting much help with the dishes afterwards. However this usually works out well to have one person designated to do it all. Half the guys in our group couldn't boil water without finding a way to burn the water.I'd like to hear some tips, advice and stories from other ""Designated Chefs."""
507927,Guest,2000-05-18 13:51:00,0,"Our group (six guys) all lend a hand in menu making and grocery shopping. It's all part of the ""Trip"", know what I mean. Of course our group is fired up for the next year's trip about 10minutes after getting back from the last one!We all seem to help with the making of dinner, some of us fillet the fish, some will do the dishes, or filter water, etc. We all have our specialties, If we are doing burgers on the grill, I would most likely be doing the flippin'. One guy usually ends up doing the bulk of the dishes though...and always rags me because it is the one thing I won't do on the trip. However, he never ever cleans fish...so I call it even!"
507928,Pooch,2000-05-18 14:23:00,4619,"The cook NEVER does dishes! The cook SELDOM cleans fish! The cook COMPILES the food stocks before the trip. EVERYONE helps the cook whenever needed. NOBODY crabs about the grub or they become the COOK!The best bunch of guys to spend a week with are the groups that have no ""shirkers"". If a new guy joins us and is shy about camp chores they don't get invited back. No matter who's friend they are.EVERYBODY fishes. New guys spend the first day on the water with the most experienced fishermen of the group. We try to keep each other up on whats working and share locations of new spots we have stumbled on.There needs to be some shared courtesy for everyone to have a good trip. Our trips this year will be close to twenty trips north of the border and they get better every year.Yes, we still have basically the same six guys that we started with. We regret that two have died on us over the years, but thats life. We each will make that trip some day."
507929,Reelmn,2000-05-18 14:31:00,328,"I am the appointed cook and proud of it. The understanding is that I prepare all the meals but do NONE of the dishes. I have found that if I prepare good food they will not complain or wimp out on the KP duty. We start the morning with coffee, bacon and scrambled eggs with shredded cheddar cheese mixed with it or pancakes with some vanilla added to the mix. I have a new recipe to try this year, it is frozen hash browns that are cooked until done then crack 6 eggs and place them on top of the hb's. Put the shredded scheese on top then cover with a lid and cook about 4 minutes until the eggs set. Cover all of this with crisp crumbled bacon and set the skillet on the table, bet they ask for seconds. Tacos are popular for supper and easy to fix. I prepare the meat at home then freeze in a ziplock bag. Warm it in a skillet and serve with canned diced tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, sour cream and refried beans. Can't beat fresh fish and fried potatoes/onions. Cut the fish in chunks, mix cornmeal and a small amount of Old Bay seasoning together in a ziplock bag. Fill the cast iron skillet with oil, get it smokin hot, drop the fish in the bag, shake them off and put in the skillet. Sorry about being windy but I love to cook and share my thoughts."
507930,Guest,2000-05-18 16:23:00,0,We do not really have a designated cook in our group but I usually try to cook as often as possible since I trust my own cooking and THE COOK DOESN'T DO DISHES!!!!!!
507931,Guest,2000-05-19 05:53:00,0,"We have been doing this for quite a few years and we all (3or4) share in the planning,shopping, prep.and cooking of the meals. When it is not my turn to cook I always help with the setting of the table and getting the drinks toughter and any thing else that needs doing. If anyone does not share in these duties he does not come with us again. I had to kick my own brother off the trip because he thought he could lay on the couch every day while we took care of everything."
507932,Guest,2000-05-19 06:08:00,0,"In my group, I do ALL the cooking. And that is just the way I like it! I'm the only one who can get up early so I can get a big start on breakfast. The guys are great about everything, they do the dishes, they clean the fish, I sometimes feel they are doing more than me. But it is usually my cabin that we stay at and they stay there for free so it works out great. If we have any new guys in camp, we usually give them a hard time, make them feel like their back at home, soon they are relaxed, and they pitch right in."
507933,Guest,2000-05-22 06:22:00,0,"I'm going to cut-N-paste all the comments that say ""THE COOK DOESN'T DO DISHES"" and forward them to my group. Actually they're not bad, it's just that after a full day of fishing and a big meal, everybody wants to crash. Everyone cleans their own fish. I like the comments about new guys. We put the newest guys with the most experienced too, but the new guy (aka ""Designated Leech Taster"") is also responsible for fetching beverages while in the cabin. However, any fun at the new guy's expense is generally very mild and everyone bends over backwards to make sure he gets onto as many fish as possible.Love the skillet breakfast idea, I'm going to try it. It's good to know I'm not the only guy who jumps out of bed 45 minutes before everyone else to make coffee and cook breakfast. Tacos? I hadn't thought of that, might be worth a try. Just about everytime I cook I put potatoes in the oven for the next meal. If I'm cooking breakfast I'll put some taters in and let them get half-baked, then we'll dice them with an onion, put them in a zip-loc and fry them for shorelunch. I do the same thing at night so we have fried potatoes for breakfast."
507934,Guest,2000-05-22 18:59:00,0,"Hey Nate,Just a note....THE COOK NEVER DOES THE DISHES....NOT NO WAY-NOT NO HOW!!!!!Best o' luck on your trip.."
507935,Guest,2000-05-22 19:10:00,0,"I must admit i could'nt boil water without burning it. One of the guys, in fact he sets the trips up, does all the cooking. The rest of us split up fish cleaning (I actually enjoy that), cleaning dishes, and the other chores. He is also on vacation. THANKS TO ALL THE COOKS!!!!"
