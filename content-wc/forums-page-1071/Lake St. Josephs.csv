The camp operators can provide you with the necessary tag to fish the lake. Check out www.oldpost.com. It's the nicest of the three camps on the lake. LOL Fred"

507896,Guest,2000-05-22 06:48:00,0,Brad< I would like to know some specifics about this lake. Can you dock your own boat and fish?If so where could a person stay? Would you please get back to me and let me know some specifics. We have fished Osenburg several times over the years and caught boatloads of eyes but never any big ones. would like to try St Joesephs if possible.thanks

Lake St. Joe is unique in that there is an accord between the camp operators and the Ontario MNR to manage the lake. The camp operators are issued 1500 tags per year for the lake to provide to their guests. There is only one boat ramp and that is controlled by the camp operators. You acn certainly take your own boat if you like, but you will still have to stay at one of the camps. I received a letter from John Grace at The Old Post last week saying that he only had 30 tags left for the year. Check out the Old Post website (www.oldpost.com) and give John Grace a call. I'm sure he can explain all of the reasons better than I can. LOL Fred"
