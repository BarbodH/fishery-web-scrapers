We're going a week later this year than normal, and with the weather the way it's been this spring, we're thinking we may be looking at far different conditions than we've encountered in the past. Does anyone have experience on Minnitaki in July or August?"

I agree with this early spring/summer I think the fishing will be hotter sooner as the water warms. HAVE FUN...Terry/IA"

But,...last year the weather was cooler and wetter than most previous years and the water level was way up. These same two weeks the year before you couldn't buy a walleye. The weather then was 85-95 degrees, blue sky, no wind and the water level was way down. So, it depends on the weather. This spring is turning out to be like last spring (cool and wet), so I'm hoping for a repeat of last year's excellent fishing.fyi, the smallmouth fishing was exactly opposite - two years ago I caught smallmouth everywhere, last year they were rare."

Now I go for 2 weeks in July and August and 1 week in Sept. I like the summer time because the weather is usually more stable, and I've caught as many fish the summer months as I have in June. If I can help you let me know. Minnataki is a excellent fishery.GOOD LUCK !!!!!!!!"
