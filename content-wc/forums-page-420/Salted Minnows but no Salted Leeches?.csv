They asked us to pull over while he checked into the leeches. Another agent came out and tolds us that we cannot bring in the salted leeches and that we couldnt dispose of them on the Canadian side of the border (he was very nice about) so we had to run them back across to the US side.I did ask the agent what the reasoning was for not being allowed the salted leeches, since they are dead. He was unsure but knew that they weren't allowed inDoes anyone know why salted leeches arent allowed?"
1458341,tv4fish,2012-07-06 08:19:00,2694,"I believe the wording that covers your situation is that the law just says ""no leeches may be brought into Canada"" - does not specify whether or not they can be ""dead or alive""."
1458364,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-06 09:07:00,235,The interesting thing to me about this thread is that people bring salted leeches. Never heard of that before. I'm sure they work though...the salted minnows sure do.
1458391,Guest,2012-07-06 10:31:00,0,Little off topic But i to have never heard of salted leeches Hows that done? Are they frozen? Do you make your own or are they retailed?
1458414,Bigstorm,2012-07-06 11:16:00,799,"On our trip to Canada last year someone brought them, Nobody else knew that he did, but we obviously didnt know that they were not allowed anyway. The guy salted them, layed them out flat after they died, vaccum sealed with salt in the back and then froze them. They actually worked just as well as salted and live minnows except that they lasted way longer on the hook.Thats why we brought them with this year, too bad we didnt get to use them. The agent also said that there were certain types of minnows that you could not bring in even if they were salted. He didnt specify which types but promptly asked what kind our salted minnows were. Fatheads are OK he said"
