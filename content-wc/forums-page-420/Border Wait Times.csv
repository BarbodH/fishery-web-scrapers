1458338,Ranger319,2012-07-06 08:06:00,166,We cross around 3-4am and in the last 10+ years of doing it have never had more than 2 vehicles in front of us. The return trip back to the states...now that can be a line. After a few years of waiting for HOURS in line that was enough. We now hit the boarder around 1am and there is rarely anyone in line. The questions asked seem to go a heck of a lot faster early in the morning too.
1458389,Bitinlight,2012-07-06 10:24:00,95,"Entered Canada through International Falls on Monday, June 4 at about 1:30 p.m. with basically no delay. Returned to the U.S. on Saturday, June 9 at about 12:30 p.m. and drove right to the check point with nobody in front of us at all."
1458145,IA JOE,2012-07-05 16:45:00,35,"The last thread on this was back in early May. On the way up I'm going to reach ""The Border Crossing"" at Internationl Falls around 4 pm on Friday the 13th. How long has the delay been at that time? Would 3 pm be better?"
1458187,Guest,2012-07-05 18:14:00,0,It has been my experience that there is very little wait. We will be crossing about the same time also on the 13. Were from iowa also
1458203,Glenman12,2012-07-05 19:24:00,762,up til this year we've crossed on Friday about 3:00-4:00..its been a mixed bag..most of the time we have 2-3 cars ahead of us and get right thru..one time we had about a 45 min wait and one time an hour and a half..I have no clue what caused the long waits..we're happy if we are at least on the bridge..
1458236,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-07-05 22:22:00,84,Crossed on Friday in June about noon. Drove right up to the stop line. Had to wait for a car to pull away and that was it. Took longer to pay the toll than to talk to an agent.
1458250,nemusky,2012-07-06 00:07:00,60,You folks are bold to start your vacation and cross the boarder on Friday the 13th!
1458285,Sidge61,2012-07-06 06:42:00,59,Will be crossing the border about noon on the 13th and hope we get through quickly. Now with that in mind where is a good place to eat north of the border?
1458292,wallydave,2012-07-06 07:01:00,2151,"For the last several years our group has been crossing Friday nights. Much less traffic on Fridays, than on Saturdays, even with the reduced numbers of folks going North!, At I Falls you can still see plenty of truck and boats in the parking lots on Friday nights, all waiting to cross in the morning. This year we went to Boston Pizza in Fort Frances Friday night, pretty good pizza, Tim Hortons for breakfast was also pretty good! When I travel, I like to have some of the local fare, if I wanted to eat at Mcdonalds, I would have stayed home."
1458300,Bigstorm,2012-07-06 07:07:00,799,"we crossed on 6/16 (saturday) at 3PM, no wait at all."
1458306,rnnonmt,2012-07-06 07:13:00,992,"We usually cross late friday night and have no wait time but that doesn't help you answer your question. However, you can check out this website that has current border wait times at the various border crossings. http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/bwt-taf/menu-eng.htmlWe used it on the way up from a smart phone. Good luck"
1458312,Slashorn,2012-07-06 07:23:00,19,"We crossed last year on Friday at about 7 pm with no problem - it is coming back that is a pain in the butt Really?!? Homeland security here is a clue, a van with kids will not likely engage in terrorist activities and that passport says I am an American..."
