It is cheaper to buy whatever you want that is over at the Duty Free Liquor where you cross and then pay the fee-it is a real easy process. Buy your stuff at the store, they give you the slip, you pick up the stuff at the little warehouse before you cross which is right on your way, they check the slip at the border, you go in and pay, and go on your merry way. It is more expensive to buy something once you have crossed. You can do this at the Pigeon River or International Falls crossing. Don't know about anything else."

They roll it out, you swipe your card, load it on cart and on your way. Kokanee is around 40 a case. The beer stores are owned by Labatts Brewing, so better deals."
