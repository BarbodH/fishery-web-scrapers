Just wondering if anybody is having any luck in steamboat bay, or Mckenzie bay now? I am sure the sandbanks are giving up a few eh? How about the ghost narrows? heard lots of good things about them last year, but nothing yet this year I have tried a few times, but never had much success fishing between goose island and steamboat narrows, has anybody found good fishing in that vicinity? there are several spots that look very promising!!!!!!!"
1457036,wallydave,2012-07-03 07:48:00,2151,"we heard of a spot due south from the entrance to steamboat, the ""corner"" to your left of the bay and along the shore line in 20-25 fow. But that tip is a couple of weeks old now. Check with your camp, they will try to put you on the fish! Good luck!"
1457381,bigtimeelectric,2012-07-03 20:12:00,174,I have tried a few spots in that area as well. Also I am wondering where lunker point got its name? I have not and havn't heard of anybody even having average fishing there? not being negative just saying it is probably called that for the same reason people throw out marker bouys that they don't intend to fish by........happy 4th everybody
