I'm staying the night before in Sioux Lookout at the Best Western because the boat landing is still 25 miles from Sioux Lookout and they like to start boating in by about 8AM if I recall correctlyKenora is still a distance to go if that is your plan or if you have a late boat-in. Just thought I would let you know.See you there!Cheers!Tom"
1458030,jambi,2012-07-05 12:21:00,504,I've stayed at the Best Western Lakeside in Kenora. Very nice. Have a great trip.

They are picking us up at 1:00 on Sunday. We are staying at Sturgeon River in cabin #2, stop by and say hi. Hope you have a safe trip.....Mark"
1458037,Sidge61,2012-07-05 12:49:00,59,"Safe trip to you as well Mark. We are in cabin #3 at SRL and should have a fishing report for you by the time you arrive. We plan on fishing part of Saturday and then Sunday with a shore lunch on Sunday. Can't wait. Look for myself, my son and the blonde gal that is my soon-to-be wife!! She is the better looking of the 3!!!"
