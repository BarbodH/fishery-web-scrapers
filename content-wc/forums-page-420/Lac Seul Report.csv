1456517,Steve of Madison,2012-07-01 21:08:00,230,"The ""move on in"" crowd is not from any particular state but it certainly is frustrating. It's happened several times with us, so we try our hand at ""fisherman fishing"". Throw out a bouy (anywhere, not on the spot you intend on fishing) and see how many boats you can catch. It's always worth the laugh at them when you go and pick it up later!"
1456520,DaBullz,2012-07-01 21:20:00,12,"While I'm not particularly bothered when my fishing space is infringed upon, it does seem to happen too often on Lac Seul. It's very odd given the nature and size of the water. I took my 2 kids up first week of June. We arrived at LSL around 4pm and sauntered across the bay. I always catch fish there - it wasn't too long before a few boats made their way. What I enjoyed was the scene the next morning - got into my boat around 8am and I saw 4 boats crowding the spot I was fishing just the night before. Funny. Generally, we fished alone, but every now and again, especially since fishing was a bit slow that week, we had uninvited company. We were fishing Broad Lake on Thursday - folks fished the mouth, I guess, while went over to the north end. Within 30 minutes of our arrival, we had 4 boats within 20 yards. Either way, I don't get too worked up about it. Walleye fishin' with my kiddos - I ain't gonna let it diminish a great experience."
1456721,tv4fish,2012-07-02 12:08:00,2694,"I have to ""chime in"" on this one - we just got back from Lac Seul on Saturday - had some of our best large walleye fishing ever, BUT -- Guys, don't think it is just the ""out of towners"" that will move in on you while you're on a hot spot. (Mods - if you remove this post, I will be more than a little upset).We were on a small island on Lac Seul, (this island is not bigger than 70 feet long by 30 feet wide) - kind of on a ""main highway"" route - One of the Anderson camp boats was ""roaring through"" at full throttle - one of my party made the mistake of setting the hook as the boat was going by, and yeah, the rod was bending as it was another nice fish - that boat shut down and starting fishing within 20 feet of us. He was situated so that we could no longer do our usual drift across the point of the island. Anderson's lodge is getting a nasty letter with the date and time."
1456858,Jabs,2012-07-02 18:37:00,24,"I Will Also chime in on Anderson's. We were up for the opener and probably fished they same island as you did next to three sisters . We were 25' from shore and this Anderson's boat going full throttle from across the lake coming right at us till they parked with in 15 feet of us. They kept pushing us closer and closer to shore till they squeezed us out.I realize they traveled 40 miles from pelican to put their clients on fish, remember their motto is if you don't catch fish, you don't pay. pretty weak if you ask me. I wonder how their clients felt when your going across this beautiful lake and then you park next to some other boat. I don't call that guiding, I call it trying to get a big tip."
1456869,joeman79,2012-07-02 19:16:00,417,If I was paying a guide to fish on Lac Seul and he pulled up that close to ANYBODY I would ask him please find somewhere else to fish or take me back to the lodge. If I was a guide I would be embarassed to have to fish so close to anyone. That lake has so many GREAT places to fish without being on top of anyone. I don't like my buddies fishing that close to me even. Fortunately we have never had any problems.
1457042,wallydave,2012-07-03 08:05:00,2151,"The fishing on the NW end of Lac Seul was slow this year and folks were getting desperate to find fish, this led to quite a bit of crowding and bad manners. One lodges guests seemed to be the most frequent offenders, a few folks posted on the etiquette thread about smaller wakes at full speed, but our group would only go full throttle by the folks who blasted by us. A boat from ""our camp"" had been swamped a couple weeks before our visit. It is just poor sportsmenship to treat other people who share the same passion in this manner. Stay safe and have fun!"
1458230,cuamb,2012-07-05 21:38:00,203,"We have been on the NE section for 15 years. We see all the Anderson boats on the ""known"" hot spots. We have found our own and stay away from them. We get to fish alone and avoid the crowd.That said, they are probably worth it on your first trip. Especially if they can point out some of the hazards and get you on some fish. Next trip hit those spots and look for new ones. You will be surprised how many good spots there are. Just be careful.It is a wonderful fisherey."
1453354,Smeds,2012-06-24 10:15:00,103,"Got back yesterday after a week at Lac Seul Lodge. In 9 years up there, I've gotta say the fishing was the best yet! It started out pretty slow for us, as the dirty water from all of the rain and the mayfly hatch had us scratching our heads to find some quality fish. I made the call Tuesday to head out to clean water, and hopefully away from the major hatch ... So off past Stoney Point and Windigo Point in the main lake. First and secondary points, both main lake and back in a few bays were on fire! We were used to catching fish fairly shallow at this time of year, but this year location was a lot deeper. 20' to 27' was best, and pulling harnesses behind bouncers far outproduced any other method. We would locate a school by trolling along deep diving cranks in 25-20' of water, watching the graph for telltale hooks. Stop trolling, drop the crawler harness down and pull them with the bow mount @ 1.1 mph and pound them for 45 minutes! We tried bouncing jigs through the same school, tough to get bit. Back down with a harness, hooked up in less than a minute! Numbers and size were unbelievable! More 24""+ fish than any other years by far. Biggest was just shy of 27"". Nothing like going back to back to back with a 24.75, 25.5 and almost 27"". If you're headed up there, go try the big lake portion, watch your wind forecasts, be safe first but go pound them ... they're out there!"
1453387,Shotgun,2012-06-24 12:21:00,759,"Smeds, thanks for the info. We'll be at Lac Seul Lodge August 11th for the week. We've fished Lake Minnitaki for the last several year and decided to try another area. Mostly because last year the water level on Minnitaki was so low we had trouble getting around. Sucked up mud a couple times going through the channel that leads to the lodge. Any lures you would recommend for Lac Seul? We do a lot of trolling with snells and spinners, minnows or a half worm. We been pretty successful over the years with this approach."
1453645,Smeds,2012-06-25 05:26:00,103,"I think you're good to go, we had luck also throwing and trolling tail dancers. Have fun!"
1453657,jas4412,2012-06-25 06:15:00,15,We will be on Lac Seul from July 7 to July 13. Sounds very promising and now I'm getting real excited.
1455085,Davey two fish,2012-06-27 18:38:00,6,"Smeds, just got back from lac seul also. Have you ever been out in the middle of nowhere and a boat full of fishermen come right in on ya and crowd you out? Well it has happened to me too many times. I just don""t get it. Especially out in the middle of Lac Seul. My buddy and I were out all by ourselves hammering very nice size eye when these dudes out wandering around came right in on us and tried their best to push us off our spot. I told them it was a big lake and there was alot of water to fish. One of the guys replied that he wished he had a gun. Really? How can you enjoy a Canadian wilderness experience like this?"
1455199,Smeds,2012-06-28 04:29:00,103,"I hear ya two fish, happens too often. Part of the fun of Lac Seul is finding an ""unknown"" honey hole, away from the masses! I hope enough people read your thread and take heed ... however guys like that usually don't frequent forums like this. Next time, perhaps implement ""naked fishing"", and then ask them if they have'nt had any luck ... would they like some?"
1455226,Davey two fish,2012-06-28 06:26:00,6,"Smeds, what is naked fishing? Just seems that a certain group of people don't respect your space. I guess that is why they call them idiots out wandering around. The reason they are not smart is because they think I otta went to Ames."
1455917,Guest,2012-06-29 20:42:00,0,Ok smed. I wish I could agree with you on the Iowa comments but then again I'm from Iowa and would never move in on someone's spot. I just got back from your lake. Fished the main area just like you. Didn't see a boat within miles of the fishing spot we used on your lake. The only differences we noticed from the fishing you experienced is our fish were much larger. In the two days we spent fishing your lake we managed 10 fish over 28 inches. Guess we were a little better at wandering around than you. Hope you have better luck on your lake next trip.
1456009,Guest,2012-06-30 08:35:00,0,"Brent, read the posts ... Smed said nothing derogatory, just gave a good report. Davey Two fish called your state out. Nice job on the big fish, that's awesome! All of those were released hopefully?"
1456023,Shotgun,2012-06-30 10:59:00,759,"Davey Two Fish, I'm from Iowa also and would never move in on someone's fishing spot. As Franklin D. Roosevelt said "" I ask you to judge me on the enemies I have made""! vs. others actions. By judging others you make yourself easy to judge."
