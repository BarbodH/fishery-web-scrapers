1458535,Lovetofish,2012-07-06 15:46:00,458,Thanks. See ya all in a couple weeks.
1458385,Lovetofish,2012-07-06 10:19:00,458,Heading out in the morning. Need to decide which route to take as either way is about the same miles. Will cross at either Pigeon River or Fort Frances. Will the north shore drive be slower on Saturday in this heat?
1458390,Bitinlight,2012-07-06 10:27:00,95,Where are you coming from?
1458392,wallydave,2012-07-06 10:36:00,2151,Where are you going? Mapquest both routes and go from there. I've read posts that say the drive along the lake is pretty!
1458396,Bitinlight,2012-07-06 10:43:00,95,"North Shore drive is a pretty drive but depending on where you are coming from, it could be longer. We fish Lac Seul out of Sioux Lookout. I live in northwestern Wisconsin about 90 miles south of Duluth, and it is about 58 miles farther going the North Shore route. Slow driving on Saturdays as there are alot of tourists on the North Shore on weekends. But there could be some kind of a wait on Saturdays crossing at the Falls depending on what time you are there."
1458397,camp chef,2012-07-06 10:43:00,915,Everything else being equal the drive to pigeon river is one of the most scenic in the whole midwest. I would easily drive up to an extra 45 minutes just for the view.
1458401,clw74,2012-07-06 10:49:00,17,My vote is for taking 61. We usually go this route and love the scenery. My only concern is the construction / detours (53 in Superior to 61N Duluth) through Duluth. Anybody been through here lately? Heading up the end of July.
1458402,Lovetofish,2012-07-06 10:50:00,458,Coming up I-35 and I fish an hour north of Savant Lake. I've crossed both ways many times and the difference between the two routes is 26 miles. Once in Canada I can make better time from Thunder Bay to Ignace to camp. Better roads too. But if the north shore drive will be slow and busy I'd turn at Cloquet and go the Fort Frances route. Thanks for your input.
1458518,RapShad,2012-07-06 15:08:00,76,"There is a detour going North through Superior through downtown, there is construction on one of the bridges. Coming back south was smooth sailing."
1458524,Lovetofish,2012-07-06 15:17:00,458,Don't think I have to worry about Superior. I'd be on 35W from Mpls through Duluth until 61. Or is there something I don't know about?
1458530,camp chef,2012-07-06 15:32:00,915,"No ,you are good"
