1457822,tbomn,2012-07-04 20:34:00,4048,"I listen to the ballgames on my XM radio out in the bush. I have an old RoadyII with a marine antenna, portable radio, and 12volt battery. Just have the antenna out in an area where it has a clear shot to the south. Never miss a game."
1457916,RistoRap,2012-07-05 08:14:00,434,"What he said above, the little satellite receivers they sell for cars run on 12 volts - ask if your cabin will have solar power, you can hook it up to that instead of bringing your own battery, that's what we have done in the past. You would need a radio with an input jack - not sure if they make a small portable radio with a built in receiver?"
1457947,SinOrSwim,2012-07-05 09:27:00,1528,"MorganMan has a portable satellite radio we take with us. Connects into a small boom box if I remember correctly. We have been listening to football games for years. We are actually looking at taking a satellite dish and tv with us this year. Has anybody done that?I know what you are thinking, why go. But, we accidentally planned our trip during the Iowa vs Iowa St football game. There are people in our group who have not missed a game in 30 years and this year will be the first. We want to at least TRY and watch it."
1457993,mcsteve,2012-07-05 11:04:00,13,Sirius Satelite radio boom box works great. I have brought mine for the past few years. When power is available I use it but I also bring enough batteries to last a week (need to change them about every 2 days). I have also setup the new boat with a mounting kit so I can simply plug the portable unit in and it runs on the spare battery for the boat. Steve

1458010,Bigstorm,2012-07-05 11:41:00,799,"Boooooo! Listening to the game while out in the boat in Canada would be the only possible way my Canada trip could get any better. I'd rather listen to Uecker call the Brewer game than watch it, he's hilarious"
1458040,RistoRap,2012-07-05 12:59:00,434,"Try going with a group that likes to listen to talk radio, and after they loosened up a bit switched it to jazz. I'd rather have a pair of smoke alarms tied to my ears than have to listen to that for a week again. The others in the group were older than I, so I respected their wishes, plus it was one of their radios."
1458048,3M TA3,2012-07-05 13:18:00,2846,"I have a Panasonic Inno XM receiver. Smaller than a cell phone. I put some velcro on it at attach to boat and plug into AUX input on stereo. Been doing this for about 6 or 7 years now and all is great. The Inno was originally intended to be worn on the arm and listened to with ear buds. I use it lots of places with lots of different audio systems. ""Works great. Don't think they make them any more. Not sure. They are available at all kinds of different prices though. Bought mine for 50 bucks new 6 or 7 years ago."
