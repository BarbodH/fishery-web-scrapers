1457073,nicko,2012-07-03 09:00:00,508,We are down to 3 days and a wake up call for heading up to Wiley Point. Any reports from anyone that has been to the area recently? I am assuming we are into the summer pattern now with fish on points and mid-lake humps and structure. Any reports? Has the Mayfly hatch happened? Targeting everything this trip. Thanks...Nick

The fish were hard to come by in the early part of our trip. It was too windy to jig in the big waters so we were picking up a few walleyes. As the winds died down later in our trip, we hit some of the big water humps and were able to get into good quality walleye with a number of 24 - 26 inch fish. We also picked up a few nice northers and a couple of muskies jigging minnows off the bottom. Didn't have too much luck casting for northerns. Maybe due to the hot sunny days we had that probably pushed them to deeper water than we were fishing. We did bring back some jumbo perch and a few nice crappie. Good luck on your trip and post a report when you get back.Wingmann"

1457283,bassface44,2012-07-03 16:38:00,96,"Nicko, My group will be on an island on the north side of French Narrows the same time you are there. Everything I have been able to find has fish where you think they will be. Surface temps should be in the low 70s. The early weather has winds out of the same direction for a few days so don't rule out a shallow crankbait bite in my opinion. Tight lines. Wish I was there already"
1457431,nicko,2012-07-03 23:33:00,508,"Thanks guys. Manitou, where are we passing you? On our way to Wiley? Figured as much as thats what I figured about this time of year. Never been up this late in summer. We plan on pulling spinners this year and hopefully fish for eyes in the morning and smallies, pike and musky in the afternoon. Been told the evening and early morning top water might be on for smallmouth and muskie. Any particular spots I should conncentrate on? Thanks, N"

1457711,nicko,2012-07-04 14:31:00,508,"Thanks.....I'll look for it. Or should I look for the open house and ""for sale"" signs?"
1458009,nicko,2012-07-05 11:35:00,508,Anyone else have any reports? 1 day to go!
