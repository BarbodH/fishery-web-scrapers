1457984,tooski,2012-07-05 10:51:00,393,"Thanks Bass, seems like a very nice camera at that price."
1457990,bassface44,2012-07-05 11:00:00,96,They are definitely pretty nice when they work for the money. I know LunkerB has had problems getting one to last. Battery/charging issues with 3 different units I think now. Mine has been fine though.
