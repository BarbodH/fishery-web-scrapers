1456676,TruBlu,2012-07-02 10:26:00,2,Need some help with the HST. Is the maximum I can get back for this $75/person. How long has it taken to get this back. Website is very confusing and just wondering if anyone has had luck with this or not.Thanks

1456716,TIGHTLINER,2012-07-02 11:57:00,223,This can take up to 4 months to get a return. I was told that this check is written on the govt and it is good for the amount shown until it is cashed. I always took it to my local bank and by the time I got it back from them taking their part I lost a good portion of it. After I found out that this check is good until cashed I took it back to Ontario on this years trip and we got the whole amount the check was written for. I had to show two forms of ID and it was cashed no questions ask. This worked out the best way and I have already filed for the HST from this years trip and will do the same with it.
1458352,a3dad,2012-07-06 08:41:00,115,does anyone have the HST refund website URL handy? Many thanks!

1458366,new hips,2012-07-06 09:10:00,498,The Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) is a consumption tax in Canada. It is used in provinces where both the federal Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the regional Provincial Sales Tax (PST) have been combined into a single value added sales tax..
1458461,55walleyes,2012-07-06 13:14:00,131,When filling out the form do you put total tax paid for trip or do you just request the 50% of the tax that you should get back?
1458487,TIGHTLINER,2012-07-06 14:12:00,223,I put the total amount shown on the bill and let them take it from there have never had a problem with it.
1458508,tv4fish,2012-07-06 14:39:00,2694,"The instructions tell you to request ""half"" of the HST that you paid. Don't think you need to worry too much about that as you also have to send along your original receipt that will show the total HST that you paid."
