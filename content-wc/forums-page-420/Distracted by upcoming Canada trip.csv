1458410,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-07-06 11:11:00,84,"In the last few weeks leading up to the trip every time my phone rings or a get a text my wife just shakes her head and says "" which one is it this time"". Or haven't you guys got anything better to than than talk about your tip everyday. I say no of course. Same at work. They get sick of hearing me talk about the upcoming trip. I am showing them Google Earth of places of where to catch bass or where I saw a huge Muskie the year before. Everyone at home and work is glad when the day finally comes."
1458413,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-06 11:14:00,235,"If Walleye Central was taken down, workplace productivity would skyrocket. At least for me anyway."
1458453,3M TA3,2012-07-06 13:02:00,2846,"You're lucky you're self employed. Not everyone has that luxury. I envy those of you that get all worked up for the big trip. It used to be like that for me until I started making 5 or more trips per year. Now it seems it's just another trip, different body of water, but same oh same oh. Pure fishing pleasure. Last year I fished 221 days, many in Canada. Often they blended together so much that I'm not sure I was really aware of where I was. Just rippen those eyes, or Crappies, or trout. I think it's the most fun thing to do, for pleasure. Not sure if I would enjoy it as much if it was a job though. I would love to get all lathered up for a trip again. Perhaps something very isolated but, then I could'nt have all my toys with me and having those is half the fun too. Wow....getting a bit excited just thinking of the possibilities."
1458564,Bill Krejca,2012-07-06 17:02:00,6107,"Somehow, not thinking/daydreaming of heading north reminds me of that country song ""He Stopped Loving Her today"", describing the demise of a lady's former lover. Bill Krejca"
1458566,btmbncr,2012-07-06 17:07:00,492,"Couldn't get to sleep until after 03:00 last night/this morning.I ended up sorting through tackle to take,extra line,blades,beads,clevises and hooks.Might have to tie some spinners while there.Got my crankbait dive charts in the box etc.Bill"
1458245,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-05 23:14:00,235,"Anyone else find it hard to concentrate at work in the days leading up to a Canada trip, particularly in a desk type of job where Internet is right in front of you? It shouldn't be this way, but things like Mayfly hatch updates, border crossing updates and reports from lakes I've never been to (and may never get to) are much more interesting to me than work right now. Anyone else suffer from this affliction?"
1458252,Tim_Kelly,2012-07-06 01:20:00,710,"Don't know what you're talking about. It's not like I've been waking up at 4.30 for the past week with my head full of excitement about the trip. I leave tomorrow morning, so I should be able to get a good night sleep in just over a week. LOL"
1458263,Fishin Fun,2012-07-06 05:45:00,218,"If you consider having a countdown on my calendar at work and being on this website 10 times a day as a distraction. Then yes. It's darn hard to concentrate. According to the calendar I have 28 days until liftoff. Matter of fact, I was going to work on my grocery list today."
1458264,HeHooksHimself,2012-07-06 05:47:00,725,"I have a dry erase board on the wall directly across from my desk. in the lower left hand corner is a section that is titled. ""Days Until Fishing"" and I rotate pictures of me with a 31"" trout, 41"" pike and 26"" walleye. Everyone in the office makes sure that i change the number every day. Right now it says ""70.""I also have links to several lodge sites and WC in my favorites on my work computer. But I never look at them on the clock. Course not. And I never have a beer on the boat, either."
1458269,northernbite,2012-07-06 05:59:00,1186,"And then it will be all over and you will be thinking about what you did and should have done. I leave July 12th for 10 days, getting ready is half the fun. I had just got back from a 2 weeker on June 7th so after this one I may go in fall.paul"
1458281,nicko,2012-07-06 06:28:00,508,I just hope work doesn't monitor my Internet site usage. All they would see is WC and accuweather. Leavin tomorrow morning. Can't get here soon enough.
1458283,Bob_Loblaw,2012-07-06 06:34:00,109,It got so bad for me that I took today off work (I leave on Monday for Savant Lake) because I knew I would be utterly unproductive!
1458303,wallydave,2012-07-06 07:10:00,2151,"sounds like the dreaded walleye fever symptoms to me!!! I wonder if you would need professional help with this. As one who works in health care, and know this affliction personally, I would be glad to treat you all with this affliction! My fees would be most reasonable, but I would need to see how this affliction is treated during your fishing trips! Feel free to contact me to discuss the office times, due to the depth of this affliction treatments would best be applied in the boat, on the walleye waters of your choice!"
1458381,NickDalasio,2012-07-06 09:58:00,34,"LOL...all the the time. Whenever I'm not looking forward to an upcoming fishing or hunting trip, I'm planning one for next year. I hope the supervisor doesn't read this forum."
1458399,1860Angler,2012-07-06 10:47:00,2642,"I'm distracted for months before going to Canada!! I'm not going until the first part of September and already can hardly focus!! Agree with monitoring internet at work, WC, weather, and searching for new lodging places are always up on my computer!! 68 days until we leave, but who's counting!!"
