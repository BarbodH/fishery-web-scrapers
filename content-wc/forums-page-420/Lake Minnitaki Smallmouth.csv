1457132,Musky Husky,2012-07-03 10:57:00,4,"Heading up to Minnitaki in a couple of weeks. I am staying at Pickerel Arm Camp. This is my third trip and have always done well on the walleye and pike, but this year I would like to try to get into some smallmouth. I have heard that there is some great smallmouth fishing in Minnitaki. I was wondering if anybody had any suggestions about general areas that are good for smallmouth on Minnitaki. I am not looking for GPS coordinations and when I fish for smallmouth it is strictly catch and release. Thanks in advance"
1457153,Aaron-IN,2012-07-03 11:27:00,500,"Can't give you specifics on that lake but it's really not rocket science (I mean that in a good way). Just look for basketball size bolders in shollow areas early in the day and late in the day, take a bunch of Senkos(they need to be real Senkos) and a few topwater baits (I prefer the 3 inch torpedos).....that's all you need.--- Good Luck!"
1457181,RapShad,2012-07-03 12:17:00,76,"Just came back from fishing in Minnitaki. We have had great Smallie fishing in Minnitaki in the past, this year was different I think mainly because of the early ice out. The bass and Pike appear to be in deep summer patterns. The smallies we did catch were monsters but it took a lot of work to get them. I caught a nice 18 incher on a white xrap and my dad caught beautiful 19.75"" on a silver mepps #3. In years past though we have caught LOTS of big smallies, this year we caught maybe half of what we normally do. Not to discourage Minnitaki is a great Bass fishery this year was the hardest I have experienced after 13 years of going up there."
1457182,Mohleye,2012-07-03 12:20:00,368,"It's been many years since I was at Minnitaki, but we had good smallie fishing right in the arm, as mentioned just look for the areas with the boulders on the shoreline."
1457207,Red Pine J,2012-07-03 13:22:00,44,"& I'd try over @ the Red Pine River & up the river into the next pool. My pal ( just got back also from Minnitaki ) the water is HIGH so it will be no problem motoring up the river, just take it easy. Ima topwater bait thrower most of my smallie fishin, but, aberdeen hook, small splitshot & leech can be killer!!!!!!! Got 1 Master football on Flyrod & mayfly immitation. Should be some footballs ( that's what Smoky Cole ( local guide ) calls um.....lol ) up around the narrows heading for Minnitaki proper. RapShad...What cabin yall stay in??????? Has this always been yalls week @ Minnitaki???? I havn't been for 3 years I think....but this past week was our time there for many moons & sunsets. Tight lines to all!!!!!!!!!! Red Pine J"
1457258,ShimanoElite,2012-07-03 15:52:00,190,Ive fished Minnitaki in the past. We never targeted smallies but our group has landed several slobs. each one was taken back by the moonlight falls area of the arm. One of the guys in our group hooked an absolute monster trolling a rattle trap along a cliff in 80fow towards the main lake. smallies love to hide in the crevices of those deep shoreline cliffs.
1457563,Cash,2012-07-04 09:10:00,73,"I just got back from a week on Minnitaki with my daughter. We stayed at Pickerel Arm Camp (the Villa cabin) We had a good week but didn't catch any SMB. We didn't see one in camp all week. Mayflies hatched while we were there, maybe that had something to do with it.http://i936.photobucket.com/albums/a...r/IMG_7686.jpghttp://i936.photobucket.com/albums/a...IMG_7521-1.jpghttp://i936.photobucket.com/albums/a...r/IMG_7546.jpg"
1457637,Red Pine J,2012-07-04 11:38:00,44,"Had yall been to PAC in the past???????? Years ago @ PAC my family & I were in the ""Villa"" and one night were awakened to bear activity on our porch ( read trash can ). I'm pretty sure that bear didn't live long after that night. A bear in the bush is one thing, a bear in camp will not be tolorated for any length of time. Cash....my pals were in cabin #2 ( i think 2 ) last week. 2 guys from missery & spent a greater part of the week on the porch. ( sickly ), they also said the wind blew ( real hard ) a couple of days. Great lookin fish there Cash!!!!!!!!!!! My pals also said the bass were slow compared to some years. ( called fishin/ knot catchin football after football every year ) ....lol My best R P J"
1457983,Guest,2012-07-05 10:47:00,0,"I have always been amazed at how few smallmouths we catch while walleye fishin. We seldom go after them specifically. In a week in which we average maybe 20+ walleyes a day for 6 days we get a total of one or two smallmouths all week. I would have thought you would pick up one or two a day without even trying. Last week four of us did not catch a single one. Anyone else have this experience, on Minnitaki or elsewhere?"
