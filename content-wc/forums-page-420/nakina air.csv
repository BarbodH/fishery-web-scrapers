1456038,Dialed In,2012-06-30 11:42:00,15,"gmattbruin,Flew in on May 18th, had no issues with either Howard or Nakina Air, when we were flying in we tipped the pilot $30.00 and he asked if we could be ready next Sat at 7am. He was there at 6:45am. Howard and Elsie had no idea what time we would be coming out, it was up to Nakina Air.Been flying in since the 70's and one time waited an extra day, a plane had engine issues and the air service got way behind. Flew with Nakina many times, most of the time very good service. Experienced first hand groups get bumped for an unscheduled flight to a mine, IT WAS NOT NAKINA AIR."
1456058,tooski,2012-06-30 13:43:00,393,"Just came out of Dusey with Nakina Air ( 7-lakes) yesterday, they said around 10 AM and thats exactly when they showed up. Tracy runs a tight ship. Howard and Elsie are friends of mine but I'll tell you straight up if there was a bit of confusion it didn't come from Nakina Air's end. Howard goes by Howard's rules, I'd be happy to confirm that with anyone who doubts it. Joe T"
1457355,nwont,2012-07-03 19:23:00,16,"I live in Nakina. Greg did lose his lead dock hand around that time. But I would say it is much more likely that Howard did not book. Howard is a pretty shady character, not very well liked in these parts. They have many guys from the land base that can easily be bumped out to the lake to fill in.As well as Nakina Air operates, I fly with them often, they have a very high turnover rate. Greg is a nice guy, but can be overly demanding."
1457367,tooski,2012-07-03 19:56:00,393,"Nwont, You wouldn't happen to be the guy that had a a run-in with Howard when I was coming solo out of Two Mile outpost would you? If so I would like to talk to you. Joe T"
1457375,nwont,2012-07-03 20:06:00,16,"Not me, but I've heard lots of conflicting stories about that one. I try to stay away from that area, you never know if there will be anything left of your vehicle or boat when you get there. Howard doesn't like others around."
1457390,tooski,2012-07-03 20:31:00,393,"Nwont, PM sent."
1457829,Walleye Wanderer,2012-07-04 21:17:00,101,"The black haired girl is Tracey if I'm not mistaken and if Milley and Greg hired her to run the show, you can bet she is top notch they would demand it. We had quite a wait this year and Tracy gave us the green light to get some breakie and come back down to the dock in 2 hrs which was great. I like others have flown many times on NA and always had a great experience but as previously said, Saturdays are very busy. Mike's right, it should be a relaxing time even if waiting for your water taxi, after all your on vacation!"
1457880,deputy dog,2012-07-05 06:31:00,305,"our flight out of beteau usually arrives around 11:30-12:00pm and when we were departing on saturday it showed up at 10:30 am.....needless to say we were on the road a little earlier than expected but not quite prepared but did so quickly and the pilot was patient. btw we were also about 180lbs over, as usual, and they shuffled some stuff and made it work. top notch group!!!!"
1454528,Guest,2012-06-26 18:17:00,0,"Sorry to hear about your long delay. We've used Nakina Air Service many times, with an operation as large as Nakina Air Service has, I can not believe that they would have forgotten you. Needless to say I'll bet that the fishing was second to none and chalk up the delay as part of the fly in experience. And as for the pilots and dockhands I'm sure that there is enough of them to fill in a void if needed."
1454588,Mike Borger,2012-06-26 19:41:00,1554,"So, in reading between the lines you guys were forced to call Nakina Air on your sat phone to request a pick up which wasn't scheduled by Howard?Don't really understand especially since there was another group flying into camp the same Saturday.Was that a mistake? Was the second group not supposed to fly, but go in with ATV instead?It's difficult to comment on the situation without knowing all the details.Regardless you had a great trip and got out of camp on your scheduled day.Be happy."
1454592,dog2,2012-06-26 19:54:00,198,"great flying service.I have flown with them since 1977.Have flown with several outfitters on our double dip trips .NAKINA AIR is awesome ,sometimes the in bound group is late and when this happens who ever is ready at the dock goes ,and we wait at our cabin waitting."
1454645,gmattbruin,2012-06-26 22:03:00,174,"Solo, without knowing all the details it is always hard to comment on any situation. That is why Im not trying on here to point fingers or slam anyone...Nakina Air or Howard&Elsie. The post was a question...Did anyone have the same issues or know of what happened on that particular morning. What we were being told by one person and then being told by someone else was very different. When that happens, you have to ask questions, Im the one responsible for a group of 8 guys. No I didnt make a sat phone call, it was solved in another manner. I was not goin to air any issues with anyone person here,just was hoping for a straight answer...thats it! Howard & Elsie seemed very nice,took care of a problem early in the week that Im sure would of pissed alot of people off,but #$@# happens,and they fixed it. If I were to have a problem with them or anyone else, I would never try and sort that issue out here. Again,just a question. And yes,it was a great trip,as you know this lake is amazing."
1454797,onetimedave,2012-06-27 09:27:00,502,"Have used Nakina Air Service through AWO with never a problem. Always first class service on both ends. If everything is done as is supposed to be, then NO problem."
1454855,gmattbruin,2012-06-27 11:08:00,174,"agreed, they are a very efficient group and greg is incredibly organized on the dock. Most of our trips have been with Bruce who also does a fantastic job.Sat there are crazy."
1454861,TIGHTLINER,2012-06-27 11:17:00,223,After thinkning of this a little longer i remember the black hair girl has been with greg now for two years. She told me last year she worked doing the samething in thunderbay but wanted to move closer to home. I noticed greg ask her where nakina air stood as far as loading and who was going where and when and her answer was very quick and to the point. Greg turned around and said to my group she knows this dock and schdule inside and out she is always on top of things. I know there is always room for error or a overlook on anyones part. Just thought i would add this to the post.
1455484,Smettsio,2012-06-28 17:02:00,3,"GMATT, I flew out with Greg/Nakina Air the 16th. It was obvious that they had somehow gotten very delayed: Our 11:00 to 11:30 slot went out around 1:30. The only rumor at the dock was that a big group had shown up late. There were no planes sitting there out of service and the turnarounds were immediate. Tracy the checkin gal kept a cool head and everybody appreciated that they were humpin to get us out as soon as they could. 'It happens. Being prepared for the nothinness of waiting at an outpost isn't really possible I suppose...but it's part of the trip. Sorry you had such a delay."
1455507,gmattbruin,2012-06-28 18:07:00,174,"Thx for the info,appreciated. You are right about delays being common, we have experienced them on almost every trip. The concern is some very conflicting reasons for the delay. If NOTHING is booked, you would want to know why, if its another unforseen situation then no problem. Like Ive said, @#@$ happens."
1455562,chris.brock,2012-06-28 20:31:00,112,"just wanted to vouch for Howard and Elsie, they're great outfittersthings are a little more easy going in Northern On., just go with it"
1454280,gmattbruin,2012-06-26 09:50:00,174,"i asked this another post, but will put it out there in its own post. Did anyone else experience a LONG delay on SatJun16th flying in or out with Nakina Air. Our group was told be ready to flyout of our camp at 7am, we got taken out at 130pm. This isnt our 1st trip and have experienced many delays before and they ususally stem from weather,which is always understandable. We were told that Greg(NA) had a dockhand and pilot quit, and all im looking for is some confirmation that that is was happened. He runs a tight ship and always seems to me to be reliable,but @#$# happens. Just want to make sure this wasnt an outfitter error."
1454296,Mike Borger,2012-06-26 10:38:00,1554,"Why wouldn't you just ask at the airbase?, they wouldn't lie.Bottom line Saturdays are a busy flying day up there. More often than not I've been picked up in early afternoon. It's certainly no big deal, they can't schedule all the flights at once."
1454327,TIGHTLINER,2012-06-26 11:32:00,223,We have flown with Nakina Air 8 or 9 times we always found Greg to be on the up and up. I don't think we have ever had a wait time of more than a hour of what we were told the pickup time would be. Solo is right Saturday is a busy fly in and fly out day. Bruce one of the pilots has been there a long time always seemed happy with his job. The dockhands seemed to work good together this year when we used them with AWO You get one party late and several more and this could run into lots of backed up flights. I would ask the outfitter if he knew of any reason for the delay.
1454351,oleJoe,2012-06-26 12:45:00,114,"Most of the time if you are waiting to be picked up from an outpost, they will wait on the party flying in. If they aren't there first thing in the morning you will wait till they arrive or not show up at all. You will probably get picked up when every group is flown in and they are empty coming back. It happens. It has happened to us when the group coming in weren't on the dock on time. They really don't want to fly empty."
1454376,unclepaully,2012-06-26 13:36:00,112,"Two summers ago we were getting picked up at Beteau lake and we had to wait around until noon. Nakina Air called Eddie and let him know the appox. arrival time. No big deal, we just got home a little later. I try not to get all stressed about things that are out of my control. When it comes to flying I'm just happy when I'm back on Terra firma. I thought Nakina Air did a great job all around...would definitely use them again."
1454382,gmattbruin,2012-06-26 13:53:00,174,"Like I said this wasnt our 1st rodeo, and delays are always 2be expected. Mike I didnt ask Greg because when we got off the plane he was swamped with getting the plane ready to go again and we needed to get goin. There is more to the story guys. the group coming in gave us 1 version and the outfitter another. All Im trying to do is clarify 1 story or another...you all know by now you have to trust your outfitter. This is by no means a question towards Nakina Air. They are a top notch business,with great pilots and if they could clarify, that would be good. Dont want to have 2 conflicting stories on what happened. Remember i mentioned weather by no means a factor,it came down to prioritiy in when we would get out, or our flight was NEVER booked,which isnt good. I dont want to into the whole story before I know wht really happened."
1454400,Mike Borger,2012-06-26 14:18:00,1554,"Regardless of why it happened, in all seriousness should it really matter that much?Stuff like this happens all the time, roll with it or find a really good drive to camp that you like."
1454425,gmattbruin,2012-06-26 15:05:00,174,"Mike....had 2 be there! I know stuff happens. Im trying not to go into details, if you know wht I mean."
1454439,Crede,2012-06-26 15:32:00,134,"Not sure if this applies to what you are meaning to ask. Last year we flew with Nakina Air (different outfitter from your's). While waiting at the base to fly in we asked if they had made their schedule for the following Saturday - when we were scheduled to fly out. They said, ""Somewhat."". We asked where we were on that schedule and were told, ""Your outfitter hasn't scheduled your flight out yet."". We were somewhat surprised by this, but Nakina Air didn't really act like this was that unusual. Our outfitter had told us before that when to be ready for our flight out and the plane was right on time. I could see a scenario where Nakina Air has a kind of preset schedule for the outfitters they deal with but if the outfitter is somewhat ""late"" getting things scheduled that their outposts may go to the end of the line for the day. This is simply speculation on my part."
1454447,gmattbruin,2012-06-26 15:50:00,174,"Thank you Crede,you are very close. If your flight has not been booked AT ALL, that could be an issue."
