1458411,downriverbob,2012-07-06 11:12:00,880,"If you have a guide that works out of the resort you are staying I would go with him. I will save you time, you will be more time on the water. We will be heading up to the Sanctuary Resort which is in the middle of Whitefish Bay, Lake of the Woods. BOB"
