535873,Guest,2003-12-07 08:06:00,0,"Some of these fish stories are amazing. A 31 inch fish that weighs 13.5 pounds! Must be one of those new high quantity scales used for weighing that one. Better yet a tale of a 31 inch fish with a 22 inch girth, lmaorotf!"
535876,Backwater Eddy,2003-12-07 14:22:00,3871,"Ya....well...believe what you wish, I guess? Yet extraordinary girths on the Red River system walleye is not too uncommon. Or for walleye on many other like forage rich systems for that fact. But ja know, when you anonymous, calling folks liars has not too much weight behind it either? ;)"
535878,McQ,2003-12-07 14:54:00,615,Here's a big one that I'd appreciate a little guestimation on. One of the lads from the Gouin Reservoir area that I fish regularly every summer sent me this pic - no details but it's a biggie.http://groups.msn.com/McQonFishing/f...oto&PhotoID=42

535790,Guest,2003-12-02 08:29:00,0,Hey Dick...Them Eagles can eat a bunch of Hog Walleye. Before we give them the big girls we put Hot sauce on the fish. Those Eagles really fly fast after that lunch. Just dont let them fly over your boat...it gets messy.

535855,Guest,2003-12-06 08:34:00,0,Mine was a 28.5 on Lac Seul on May 28. Let me tell you about the little ones. We must have caught literally hundreds less then 12 inches. It's almost like deep sea fishing. Get the bait through the little ones and maybe get a nice fish. Lac Seul is going to be great for years to come.

535707,Guest,2003-11-19 20:09:00,0,"My 11 year old son caught a 30 1/4"" on Lac Seul in June. The proud Poppy could only muster a 28"". Two 29""'s in 2002, so I remain in the hunt for the one that break's 30"" for me. My 8-eight year old daughter is coming on the Lac Seul trip this year, so I once again expect to be shut out while she takes the fish of the trip. That would be a great moment. She already is a better fisherperson than I because she will fish in a steady rain, in the cold, and never complains. Just asks 100's of questions about fishing and wants to keep staying out....IA Walleye"
