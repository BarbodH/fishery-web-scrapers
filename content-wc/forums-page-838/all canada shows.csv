I was transferred down to Atlanta from Charlotte, NC and have only been living permantly here since October. Drop me an email. I would like to know if you've ever fished for Walleye in our mountains.

535904,Guest,2003-12-09 01:48:00,0,Wow only about another month to the outdoor shows.
535905,AL,2003-12-09 05:06:00,89,"I live in Georgia and make at least one annual trip to Canada a year. I have been wanting to go to an ""All Canada"" show the past few years. Which one would be the best and is it worth the trip? What can I expect to see at one of these shows? When and where are they? AL"
535906,Bob G2,2003-12-09 07:42:00,172,"Basically, I believe they are all the pretty much the same since they are run by the same outfit. The lodges may vary some depending on location. They do have seminars, but basically it is pretty much all lodges. They do have some cursory tackle at the gift shop, but you would see more, and at better prices, at a local tackle shop. If you are shopping to compare lodges in Canada, mostly Ontario Lodges, then this is a show for you."
535908,Guest,2003-12-09 08:54:00,0,"Al, Go to All Canada.com to check show schedules and locations. We, along with many other Canadian camps attend many of the shows. Should help you make a choice."
535913,retire55,2003-12-09 12:41:00,1029,"AL: A couple of other web sites to check out re sport shows are:http://www.sportshows.com/ andhttp://www.sport.reedexpo.com/ Information on sports shows in Canada is available at http://www.sportshows.ca/ Regardless which show you attend, the shows can provide at least some relief from winter cabin fever.

535925,DaveIN,2003-12-10 11:15:00,191,I have been to the Chicago show and it is great. I have been to Indianapolis show and it is not worth the price of the tickets. There were only about 25 or 30 resorts at that one. For what its worth. DaveIN
535964,Hammerhead Herb,2003-12-14 15:02:00,259,I also go to the Chicago show and its great (w/i 25 miles of O'Hare Airport also); they sell Labatts there also - though my outfitter usually buys me a few. One way to tell which is a good show is to see which ones have no more room for exhibitors. You can find this out at the All Canada Show website. www.allcanada.com
535965,Guest,2003-12-14 16:40:00,0,"All Canada shows.....rather stale just like the ""Blue"" they pass off as Canadian beer."
535966,AL,2003-12-14 19:02:00,89,Then I sould enjoy it.....I love Blue! AL
535971,Atlanta Dave,2003-12-15 12:37:00,323,Al Where in georgia are you from. I also fish canada a couple of times an year and live in Lilburn. We go to Lake Athabasca every June and are thinking of a trip to gouin in Quebec the end of July next year. Atlanta Dave
