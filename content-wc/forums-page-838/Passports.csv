Heard last week from a guy who plans to go to Canada this summer, and he was telling me he was told that starting in 2004 we will need a passport to visit Canada on fishing trips? Also I heard that passports went up to like 90 bucks now? Any information on this as it comes available would be appreciated."
535866,Erie Drifter,2003-12-06 20:54:00,1902,"When entering Canada from the United States, U.S. citizens must show either a U.S. passport or proof of American citizenship or permanent residency card (green card) and photo ID. A visitor visa is not required for U.S. citizens for a stay up to 180 days. U.S. citizens entering Canada from a third country must have a valid passport. Anyone with a history of criminal activity equivalent to a criminal record under the Canadian Criminal Code (including a Drinking While Impaired (DWI) charge) should contact the Canadian Embassy or nearest Canadian consulate before travel. For information on entry requirements, travelers may contact the Embassy of Canada or the Canadian consulates in Buffalo, Seattle, New York, Detroit, or Los Angeles. The United States of America Embassy provides information on U.S. Citizen Services, such as passports, acquisition of citizenship, birth and death registration, dual nationality, voting, benefits, notarials, adoptions and travel tips, as well as links to the State Department, Customs Service, Social Security Administration, Veterans Administration, the IRS and Canadian Government web sites. Many governments, including Canada's, have initiated procedures at entry and exit points to prevent international child abduction, including requiring documentary evidence of relationship and permission of the parent(s) or legal guardian not present for the child's travel. Having such documentation on hand, even if not required, may facilitate entry and departure. From: http://www.gov.pe.ca/immigration/ind...3?number=61788 Bill W. (War-N-Peace-ch 68)"
535867,Vitreum,2003-12-06 20:58:00,221,cannot imagine that either country would go to passports exclusively. just too much cross border commerce (both ways) to institute such a rigid requirement.
535868,fishmaster,2003-12-06 21:02:00,209,Yea but if someone wants to make a buck they will figure a way.
535872,McQ,2003-12-07 07:21:00,615,"Citizens or permanent residents of the United States do not require passports or visas, and can usually cross the US-Canada border without difficulty or delay. To forestall any problems, Canada Customs strongly suggest that US citizens carry proof of residency, and some identification documents showing citizenship such as a US passport (this is the best), birth certificate, or baptismal certificate. Permanent residents of the US who are not US citizens (yet) are advised to carry their alien registration receipt card (US Form I-151 or Form I-551). If you are traveling with persons under the age of 18, they MUST have their birth certificate AND a letter from their legal guardians, giving permission to travel to Canada."
