535988,Atlanta Dave,2003-12-16 07:23:00,323,Does anyone know what is laying on the dock looks like some type animal? Atlanta Dave
535997,gmerz,2003-12-16 10:04:00,911,looks like a dead small deer being fed on by crows...
536011,Guest,2003-12-17 09:42:00,0,Looks like a coyote someone hauled up there (see footprint trail on dock) with Ravens eating on it.
536014,Guest,2003-12-17 16:06:00,0,"I checked the previous pictures taken at different times and nothing including the ""raven"" have moved. It sure looks like one."
536015,Guest,2003-12-17 16:09:00,0,It almost looks like a camp fire started on the dock.
536029,Frank Walsh,2003-12-18 07:01:00,34,"Curiosity got the better of me, and I just ran over to the dock to see exactly what it was. Gmerz got it right. It's a small deer. Probably a road or wolf kill dragged up there to attract critters. What's bizarre, is that there is a second deer head alongside of it. Lots of ravens hanging around."
535749,Guest,2003-11-26 00:11:00,0,I found this web site for some resort on the northwest angle and they have a camera mounted looking at the dock with a temp gauge on it. last week there was a little ice near shore and today there is ice on the water and snow on the ice. what a great web site.

535751,Guest,2003-11-26 10:03:00,0,"Walleyes Unlimited of Montana has some of those scattered around the state. A couple are at Ft. Peck. Yeah... pretty neat, you can see how windy it is, who's trucks are the ramp parking lot, and so forth."
535778,AL,2003-11-30 07:06:00,89,How often does the picture change?
535780,Guest,2003-11-30 07:51:00,0,"There are two cameras here. One is on a 100' tower and the other on the dock. These cameras are on the north side of Flag Island in the Northwest Angle and they look north towards Cyclone Island. They are basically live cameras. Since I fish up there, I check it regularly and it's rare not to see a current time stamp on the picture. Over this Thanksgiving weekend I've noticed that it's stuck. Give it a day or two, it will come back ""online"""
535781,Guest,2003-11-30 14:03:00,0,Great site...I think I see a couple of Ice fisherman off the point up the lake there. Looks like one running for a flag...........

535817,Guest,2003-12-03 18:29:00,0,We're running about 10in ice here in NW Ontario and we're getting good fish. I'm at work dreaming of the weekend. Looks like they got another one...they're running again
535894,gmerz,2003-12-08 09:48:00,911,"The camera is back ""online"" Sure looks like winter today..."
535902,Guest,2003-12-09 01:45:00,0,yep thats it thanks.
