This particular fish was caught by a guest by a lodge that I used to work at, so it's extremely interesting to me. I know the owner would not try to pull a fast one, and the guy who caught it is a local resident. I'm just curious why there is no picture with measuring tape. Just thought I'd bring it to the attention of the board."
