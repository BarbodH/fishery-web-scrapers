535934,Guest,2003-12-11 12:47:00,0,"I was there June 2002. the cabins are not fancy,but have what you need. When we were there the water was 2 feet high. We found the fishing good. We found walleyes at the mouth of the river by barrel lake. Also at a rapids in barrel lake. I will post my Web site with pictures later, when I have more time."
535935,Guest,2003-12-11 16:58:00,0,"www.geocities.com/uttechkdu/english-river-trip It is a good trip for a small budget. big smallmouths around rocks not big numbers though. We found walleyes by dragging spinners with crawlers. We did not do well in the river. We did catch alot of eyes by the mouth. In Barrel lake we fished the shorelines caught some fish. I wish we would have spent more time in barrel. but it is 1/2 hour from camp to the mouth. find some points in the lake. the basin of the lake is very deep. I would like to try the lake he has for lake trout. We did try the portage lake Maegan for trophy pike. ""waste of time"""
535944,Guest,2003-12-12 13:45:00,0,THANKS FOR THE INFO. DOES DAN ALSO HAVE PORTAGE LAKE FOR WALLEYE?
535958,Guest,2003-12-13 18:22:00,0,The one portage trip for eyes is a 20 min. boat ride from camp up to a rapids. there you leave your boat and on top of the rapids waits another boat. this gives you access to more river system and a lake or 2. I have not tried it but sounds fun.
535993,Guest,2003-12-16 08:58:00,0,"UTT, YOUR PICTURES ARE GREAT. THE WALLEYES ARE VERY NICE. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY YOU CAUGHT A DAY APPROXIMATELY AND THE AVERAGE SIZE. DID YOU HAVE A GUIDE OR JUST FIND THEM YOURSELF? IT LOOKS LIKE A GOOD PLACE. THANKS, ROBBY"
536007,Guest,2003-12-17 08:06:00,0,"I would say once we found them we caught 50 to 75 in a 2 man boat per day. The first day we did not catch too many maybe 10 or so. But we found how to catch them. We had one spot that was good all week, so we did not have to search for more. The mouth of the river before Barrel lake was our best spot. We caught alot of eater fish 13-16 inch. We did get some 17-18 inch fish and a few in the 20-26 inch range. smallmouth were 16-19 inch. Pike were in the upper 20"" with some in the low to mid 30"" range but we are not pike fisherman. the last mile or so of the river was my favorite area. I did not think too much of the area upstream from camp.I would like to explore barrel lake more. It is a deep lake away from shore. alot of nice shore line to fish. Alot of water with no people.There is not a fish behind every rock. If you found them it was fun. Back troll or drift with a 1/2-1 oz wieght, a spinner and a crawler until you find fish."
