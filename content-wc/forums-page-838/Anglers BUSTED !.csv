535816,Guest,2003-12-03 16:10:00,0,I would guess they were chucking the beers out during the run. Just ran outta time to ditch the fish LOL Good Fishen Rob
535831,Guest,2003-12-04 12:10:00,0,heck as much as they pay to fish that sewer pit the MDNR should have had to clean and cook the fish for them too.
535844,Guest,2003-12-04 20:55:00,0,"That isn't the point being made. The point is if you POACH you PAY. Simple enough ? If you don't like fishing in Canada, my advice to you is stay home. We all have the RIGHT to make choices, so make yours and stay home. Pretty basic, isn't it ? Good Fishen Rob"
535853,Reels,2003-12-05 19:15:00,2876,"Rob, I'm surprised you took the bait on that one. Just ignore nuts like that, the eventually go away or a squirel eats them. <{{}}><"
535862,Guest,2003-12-06 17:56:00,0,"I know.....but it was just TOO hard to pass up. I'm used to all the slagging that Canada / Canadians get on this web site (DUI laws, border crossing/guards, leech laws etc) These I can handle. I do however tend to stand up when some things get said. Claiming that NW Ont is a ""toilet bowl"" is one that gets me going. I have been known for opening my ""big yap"" when things that are said are totally uncalled for (i.e Yappy Canucks mouthing off to Y'alls on a boat launch) This comment I felt was totally ""uncalled"" for. It took me awhile to write my reply to that post as many of my ""drafts"" wouldn't have passed the censors ! LOL ! Good Fishen Rob"

535885,River_eye,2003-12-07 22:27:00,1486,"Hey Rob, what's up. Send me an e-mail at [email protected] just curious how you're doing."
535798,Guest,2003-12-02 16:58:00,0,"Direct from todays Winnipeg Sun. U.S Anglers lose licences, Fined $5,750 Kenora, Ont (CP) Three American anglers are on the hook for $5,750 in fines after a high-speed boat chase on a remote lake north of Kenora, Ont. Thomas Keathley, 41, of Mableton,Ga., and John Stevenson, 41, of Circleville, Ohio, were convicted of obstructing officers from the Ministry of Natural Resources and fined $1,500 each for obstruction and $1,000 each for having 15 walleye over the limit. Sherman Keathly, 41, of St. Louis, Mo., was convicted and fined $750 for obstruction. Their fishing licences were also suspended for a year."

535801,Guest,2003-12-02 19:16:00,0,You don't read that rag do you? lol!!!
535802,Guest,2003-12-02 19:46:00,0,This was all over the papers in NW Ontario. Some guys just don't get it. The odds of being caught are probaly not that great but if you are you will get the book thrown at you. The fines are going up and they will always publish your name. That alone should probably get you to rethink.
535803,Guest,2003-12-02 20:17:00,0,"HEY NOW, they have nothing but the best news available ! They also have the Sun Girl & Miss LonelyHearts........ I did see that she printed your letter........"
535804,Reels,2003-12-02 20:51:00,2876,I'm just laughing at a the thought of a high speed chase on a remote northern lake... I vision a bugs bunny cartoon. <{{}}><
535807,Guest,2003-12-03 00:39:00,0,DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT LAKE THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT
535808,eyedoktr,2003-12-03 05:50:00,2426,"In my opinion, it was not nearly a big enough penalty unless it was $1000 per fish over the limit. I also don't see where there was jail time and/or revocation of hunting and fishing priveleges for the rest of their lives (U.S.and Canada)."
535809,Guest,2003-12-03 11:02:00,0,That should teach them. Next time get a faster boat! It must've had the number 24 on the side.
535811,Guest,2003-12-03 12:17:00,0,That was my thought also. A high speed chase in a 16ft lund w/25 merc or was that maybe a 25 Acme ? Explain why they were caught..... LOL Good FIshen Rob
