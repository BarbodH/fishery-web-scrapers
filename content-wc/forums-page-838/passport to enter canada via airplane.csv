He said that he heard we need to purchase passports since we are in flight and not driving. Does anyone know if that's true? We certainly don't want to ignore it and get stuck!! Thanks in advance....."
535943,Guest,2003-12-12 12:47:00,0,As far as I know you will not need anything different than crossing by car. You will have to land and clear customs at a boarder airport. It is possible that you will get some good information on WC but you may also get misinformation. Anyone with questions about crossing the boarder should call customs and imigration direct and not rely on third hand info.
535947,Guest,2003-12-13 05:15:00,0,I fly my own plane into Ontario a few times during the year and have not been required to have a passport only a birth certificate. I had one time a friend forgot his birth certificate and he just showed his drivers liscense. Your friend will want to get a customs decal and have a current radio liscense for the plane (which is required for traveling across borders). Customs requires two hours notification before crossing the border either way. The AOPA (Aircraft Owners and Pilots Assocaition) has a nice packet of information avialable on this subject a no cost. Post your e-mail address and I will be happy to give you more info. Happy flying. Steve

Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful. Unfortunately, as well, being a Saturday, there were no representatives working at the Automated Customs Information Service (ACIS). I do recall though that American citizens can normally enter Canada with out difficulty with identification other than a passport (e.g. birth certicate, drivers licence). When I telephoned the ACIS this morning and selected arrival in Canada by private aircraft, the precorded message detailed that the pilot would have to telephone a customs office and provide necessary identification for himself/herself and all passengers. For future reference, you may find the following web site helpful:http://www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca/E/pub/cp/.../rc4161-e.html Jay"
