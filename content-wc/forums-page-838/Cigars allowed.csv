535955,Guest,2003-12-13 15:12:00,0,"Iknow about liquor and cigs, but how many cigars can you bring into Canada?"
535957,retire55,2003-12-13 16:52:00,1029,"Hump1: Copied from http://www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca/E/pub/cp/.../rc4161-e.html If you meet the age requirements of the province or territory where you enter Canada, you are allowed to bring the following amounts of tobacco into Canada without paying duty: up to 200 cigarettes, 50 cigars or cigarillos, 200 grams (7 ounces) of manufactured tobacco and 200 tobacco sticks. You may bring in additional quantities, but you must pay duties and taxes on the excess amount."
535959,Guest,2003-12-13 18:58:00,0,Thanks for the response
535961,iamwalleye1,2003-12-14 07:24:00,1589,"Every year I bring in about 25 that is all I can smoke or even come close to smoking, But you can bring in 50! Never had a problem!"
535974,Guest,2003-12-15 14:42:00,0,"Hump, are you coming to Canada from the States??? If you are from the States and coming up to Canada to fish I wouldn't bring cigars...you should buy them here in Canada, you can get Cuban, Dominican, etc....the only thing with the Cuban cigars is you can't bring them back with you when you go home...(as you already know, Cuban cigars are illegal in the States)....hope this helps!! Chrispy!"
535975,Guest,2003-12-15 14:47:00,0,We bought cigars in Canada last year. They were expensive! Like $8.00 a cigar. I realize they are of top quality. Much better than my WM Penn 10 for 3.29!
535976,Guest,2003-12-15 15:08:00,0,Where do you enter Canada??? If you come in through Windsor there are 100 stores in our area that sell all kinds of cigars at different prices....myself I smoke La Arora' (Dominican) and they run about $3.00 - $5.00 each....let me know where you are coming into Canada and I'll do a quick search for you and I should be able to find you a couple spots to purchase them... Chrispy!
535983,Reels,2003-12-15 20:08:00,2876,"I agree, Canadian Tobaco taxes are brutal. Bring some good Dominicans with you, buy a cuban up north if you want to try one. Relax and enoy the smoke! <{{}}><"
535990,Guest,2003-12-16 08:16:00,0,I go thru International Falls. Thanks again for the input.
535991,Guest,2003-12-16 08:35:00,0,I just did a quick search and found this store in Niagra Falls...I don't know the address but I'm sure with a little more searching you will be able to find that out....from what the guy said it has a big walk in humidor and sell all brands...
