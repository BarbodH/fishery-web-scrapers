We will be fishing for about everything(walleye,bass(catch/release through 7/1)northern,muskie,crappie,perch,etc)What types of cover should we be looking for,what are good baits/colors,what depths should the fish be in a normal year.We will be staying in the Nestor Falls area. Thanks in advance for any tips."

I used Doug Johnson last year and he put us on a lot of fish. I would also recommend Harvey from the same place. Al Meline is arrogant and expensive, he'd be my last resort. If you can't get hooked throught them post again on here and I will e-mail you some names that I have at home that you can also try. I took my kids last summer with the guide and they had the most fun they have ever had fishing up there. My daughter demands we get a guide again this year."
