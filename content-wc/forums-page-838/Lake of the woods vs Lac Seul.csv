535917,Guest,2003-12-09 16:20:00,0,"Looks like I will be going back to Lac Seul this summer. I am considering staying at Goose Bay. Price has as much to with this choice as anything. I spend most of the day on the boat while I am in Canada, so I figure I don't need a fancy place just a good and clean one. I have the map published by Red Lake Digital Media. Does anyone know of a better map than this one? I would prefer an electronic map but I don't thing one exists. Last time I was there, we fished the Wenasage Fish Sanctuary and the basin south of Steamboat Narrows. Is it worth running all the way down to McKenzie Bay? Any suggestions on other places to fish?"

535732,Guest,2003-11-25 07:50:00,0,"I'am planning a trip to Canada for the first week of July. Because it will be the week of the 4th I know I need to book early. I have narrowed my choices down to Lake of the Woods near Sioux Narrows or Lac Seul near Ear Falls. I have been to LOTW many times, I know a few good spots plus I like the idea of the clear water (for my camera) and the avalibility of small mouths there. I have only been to Lac Seul once and it was a bad week as far as the fishing goes. Not just for me, but it seemed everyone in camp was having a tough time. The fish had turned off because of the fronts that kept rolling through. The big question here is, is it worth the extra drive to go to Lac Seul? On LOTW I am looing at Lebron's camp even though I would like a camp closer to Yellow Girl Bay but can't find one. On Lac Seul I am looking at Goose Bay Camp. I don't need anything fancy just a decent and clean place. Brax"
535757,Brian_MN,2003-11-26 16:22:00,738,"Check out Witch Bay Camp on LOTW. It's north of Yellow Girl, but it's still an easy run down there if you like. It's also in the heart of muskie country. Lots caught within a mile or two of camp. www.witchbay.com"
535760,Guest,2003-11-26 18:57:00,0,"I have stayed at Witch Bay twice. It is a great place and they have a good location. They are just a little pricey for me. I am looking for a place I can just rent a cabin and dock my boat. This will keep the costs down. But thanks for the reply, Witch Bay would be my first choice if price was not an issue. Brax"
535762,Guest,2003-11-27 07:25:00,0,We have been going to Lac Seul's Scout Lake Resort at Ear Falls for many years in August. We have always caught an unbelievable amount of Walleye and Northern. I have fished LOTW on several occassions and it doesn't compare to Lac Suel. Last year in 6 short days of fishing we caught over 250 walleye.
535776,Guest,2003-11-29 20:14:00,0,Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh! It's a great perch lake!

535820,Guest,2003-12-04 05:18:00,0,"This Scout Lake Resort looks pretty good. I have stayed at Deer Fawn Lodge before, this sounds like it is near there. Where do you do most of your fishing in this area, how long of a run do you do per day? Is the resort as nice as the pictures show? Last time we were there, we mostly fished with spinner rigs and minnows, is this how you were catching all those eye's? Thanks for the info. Brax"
535843,Guest,2003-12-04 19:45:00,0,"Never fished LOTW, however stayed at Golden Eagle Resort last year the first week of June on Lac Seul. Was our third trip to Canada and I can say we caught more fish in the first three days on Lac Seul then we caught at an outpost out of Red Lake and Eagle Lake combined. There were six of us last year and combined we caught at least 1000 walleye for the week. No trophys, but lots in the 4-5lb range. Was my brother and fathers first time in Canada. Dad is still talking about having too take a week off from work to rest his arm from reeling in so many fish. Was truly a fantastic week. Needless to say we have booked the same week with Golden Eagle. If your interested check out www.goldeneagleresort.com Very nice people and very clean resort."
