535656,bluffstalker,2003-11-13 11:48:00,4,Wondering when the muskie opener is for 2004 and what month people prefer to fish june or july for muskies mainly and other species overall? Also drive to resort recomendations in NW Angle area; taking father and brother for short 4-5 day stay. Any opionions on Angle Outpost lodge?

Most years the fishing around ""the Angle"" for walleyes, smallies and muskies is pretty darn good from early-mid June on through the whole summer. Take your camera, that's some pretty country up there... I've fished the Angle for years and would recommend Flag Island Resort. Major rehab there this year. Nice location. It is on an island but if you're bringing your own boat, it's about a five minute ride from Young's Bay"

535664,Guest,2003-11-15 12:12:00,0,"I would suggest Walsh's bay store camp on Oak Island. check it out at http://www.baystorecamp.com/index.html . See if Frank is avalible to guide you for a day or 2. Fished with him this fall. He will put you on fish! Cabins are very clean, and if you are so pumped up to fish, that you forget to get groceries, His wife Laura will take good care of you."
535678,PRD1,2003-11-17 11:29:00,458,We were at Angle Outpost resort the first week of October and were really impressed by the quality/condition of the cabins and they were really nice folks. We were in a 2BR and it was like new. This was our first trip there and we would go back. The four of us got 7 Muskies (31/36/38/40/43/43/45) and saw a couple hogs. The weather was brutal that week (snow/rain/wind etc.) so I guess the fishing was OK all things considered. Paul

535746,balsl6,2003-11-25 20:17:00,426,Bay store camp or big sandy's are probably the 2 best resorts for muskie fishing. Neither one of them is on the mainland but within 10-15 minutes from youngs bay. Youngs bay resort is also a very nice place to stay Good Luck
