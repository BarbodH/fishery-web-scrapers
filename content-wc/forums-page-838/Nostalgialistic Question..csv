535859,Walleye Express,2003-12-06 14:24:00,2386,"[b] Hey, Eh. Gotta a question for you canadian guys. This is my first post and visit to this of corner the WC board. And don't worry, I won't make visiting here a habbit. :D Was just wondering about how the only two places I ever went into Canada are doing both fish wise and tourest wise. These trips were taken about 35 years ago with my Father, Brother and close personal friends and both etched memories and meant a lot to me. The first trip was to a place called Batchuwanna Bay. We stayed there fishing for only 1 day and then were transported via Dodge Power Wagon up some mountain to a Lake Called Adilade Lake, where we fished for Lakers and Brook Trout. The owner of the lodge at Batchuwanna name was Mr. Alsegieon. Now, the spellings of the Bay, Lake and the owners name may be in error. The other place was White Lake, where we camped in the White Lake provintial Park and viewed a outside movie in what was called an ampa-theatre. All things I will forever remember. Any recent info on any of these places?"

535875,McQ,2003-12-07 14:14:00,615,"Capt. Dan, I can't help with your question but wish you would visit this side of the site more often. With all the experience I have in fishing my local waters I gain a ton of insight from the techniques you use on the Bay. I find that the more information folks share on this board the more advantage we all gain. I'll be using your Stinger spoon advice up here in Northern Quebec this coming season for the simple reason that you have got me thinking more about using spoons and that is one tactic that isn't used here very often for the eyes. I'm not a downrigger fisherman but I can see an adaptable method that suits my style of longlining that will easily incorporate your Stinger technique."

I think your talking about my Slider Spoon idea. Of course this wasn't origianlly my idea. Sliders have been used for years while Salmon fishing on the Great Lakes. But the technique does vary in the fact that the sliders used for salmon were simply allowed to work freely up and down on the slac line that was created from the rod tip to the cannon ball below. Whereas my idea uses a stopper and the cranbait for getting the spoon slider down and around the fish zone. If you personally ever have a question about this rig, feel free to e-mail me with them. I went into production on my spoon slider crawler harness rigs this winter as well. Refined them to troll at speeds into the 3MPH zone without twists or tangles. I've made up 100 of them for retail at Franks Great Outdoors next season. Not sure how they will sell, as they are expensive to make up because of the component cost. But I know they took over in the catching department when the plane spoons sliders quit working for a while."
535895,Wawajake,2003-12-08 11:41:00,413,"Hey Walleye express I might be able to add a little clarity to your post. The place you probably mean is Batchawana Bay and its almost an hour north of Sault Ste Marie , it is just a small village but it also contains a small beach front provincial park on eastern shore of Lake Superior and has a couple of lodge type motels. Not sure if these lodge motels might still do excursion trips into the bush and interior lakes. Like Adelaide Lake ? (could not find that lake on map but might be smaller one) The only Motel Lodge I could find in yellow pages is Shoreline Motel Lodge 1 800 203 3529 . The Park WhiteLake you mentioned I suspect is the one further north on Hwy 17 closer to WhiteRiver Ont. (3 hrs from Sault) See the link to that park http://www.ontarioparks.com/english/whit.html jake jake"

I remember we had only went to Batchawanna Bay to meet up with the resort owner, who then transported us up a very steep and narrow 2 tracker to the Lake. We stayed on an island on the Lake in a rustic cabin with it's own flying squirrel homesteaded in the rafters. Also got a look at my first playboy in the outhouse behind the cabin. So you can see why I remember it so well. There was a fair sized river that ran paralell to the two tracker where we caught some beautiful Brookies up to 15 inches, on small firetail spinners and a piece of crawler. I'd bet it was only 20 to 30 miles from the Bay, but it was 35 years ago. And the White Lake you describe sounds like the place, as we seemed to continually go North after going through WaWa. Thank's for blowing some cob webs off my memory with my Dad."
535897,Le pickerel,2003-12-08 17:14:00,18,"Dear Mr. Express, Let me get this straight. You visited Canada thirty-five (35) years ago and now come on this Walleye Canada site wondering how things are doing at the two places you visited? Kinda like me saying I was down in the states last summer and met a guy by the name of Bob, great guy and he sure turned me on to some nice fish. Do you know him? Don't take offense W.E. I'm just PMSing and had nothing better to do this evening. Surely you have to see the humour in what you wrote. Hope you come back up soon so you can see for yourself how things have changed, some for the better, some for the worse. Le pic Oops, almost forgot. Eh!"
535915,Wawajake,2003-12-09 13:05:00,413,"hey Walleye express I think I on a fluke found your hosts at Batchawawa try this link the name seems fairly close to the spelling you had. http://www.salzburgerhofresort.com/ I doubt the fishing is as good as you experienced 35 years ago but not much has changed, a little more logging and more ATV accessible lakes. :) hey Jcass you must of been up this way 40 years ago, because you are correct that Montreal River section of highway (mountain pass)just celebrated I think its 40th anniversary of providing a direct highway link to Wawa. Unfortunately the map link you provided is a very general map it does not show the hundreds of lakes named and unnamed in that area. (and a few that us locals like to keep on the QT. ) :) jake"
535920,Walleye Express,2003-12-09 18:06:00,2386,"[b]Jake & Cass. Very, very cool. Thank you both for your efforts. And I know that this is the same family name that had the cabins on Batchawanna Bay. I'm sure the original guy is either retired or dead by now, but seems the family stayed successful and even expanded from their original business. Just wish they had an e-mail address. I'd like to find out what happened to the father, or if he remembered our trip. He would because of what happened on the way down. Also believe that the lake we fished is indeed the one Just east and up the mountain from the Bay. But believe me, it wasn't no walk in the park to get to it back then. I remember the power wagon broke a steering knuckle pin on the way out after our trip and the Dodge almost went off the road down into the raveen below. My Dad and Mr. Alsegon fixed it somehow with no more than a screw driver and a pair of pliers. I know they were really praising each other after we continued down."
535937,Guest,2003-12-11 20:00:00,0,I fished White Lake about 6 years ago and we did quite well. Its a very pretty lake. We were not staying at the camp ground but were working at the mines under constuction close to there. I think if you went back you would do quote well. The locals that we met were friendly and informative. All in all a very nice place.

I remember one day we split up and me and my bud headed down lake to a spillway dam that was made of wood timbers. We could see the walleyes and some suckers along the bottom in front of this spillway dam. Try as we may we could only get the smaller walleye dinks to bite. We did stop into a cove on the way back and i caught a very big pike on a bobber. Yup a bobber. It kept hitting the bobber as soon as it hit the water. So, I attached a single Eagle Claw hook to the bobbers line clip and when the pike hit again it got caught. I was an experimenter even back then. :D That same day my Dad and brother went to some rapids that seemed to be west of the park and he caught a 24 pound pike with a Red/White daredevil. Still got the pictures of that monster. The sights, sounds, colors and smells associated with both trips will forever be etched on my mind."

I think you either didn't read my post well enough or missed my intended point. These trips were with my Dad and ment a great deal to me. Perhaps your not old enough yet to have anything mean very much to you yet. I was simply enquiring about how these places have faired over the years and if there is still an interest and good fishing at these places. Asking about certain Lakes and Bays that are indeed in Canada doesn't seem to off the realm of things on a site called Canada. Right? But rest assured if I had wondered about what the fuss was about candians starting to treat US residents unfairly, you've reasured me that there is indeed no reason whatsoever."
535909,jcass,2003-12-09 09:02:00,255,"Go to this site to refresh your memory - super Ontario map.http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/tra...eets/map12.pdf Zoom in and out on Batchewana (sp?) and you will see an unnamed lake northwest of Batch... at the head of a river. THat might be the one. If you went east up into the hills you would have eventually crossed the train tracks. I drive by BAtch and White Lake every year heading up to do canoe trips. There are always a number of boats on White lake (the White River is dammed up there to form the lake) so the fishing must be ok. Provincial park is still there. A lot of the area from BAtch... to Wawa is now a big national Canadian park. Most of those rivers are 'spring' rivers, lots of water coming out to Superior as the snow melts, then they almost dry up in summer. Lots of nice people up in that region. THat road used to stop at the Montreal River north of Batch.. You must have gone up to White Lake just after the bridge was put in and the road was opened to Wawa, unless you went another way. Always fun to remember 'the old days' and trips with people no longer here."
