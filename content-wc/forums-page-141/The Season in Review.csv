6253732,BornToFish,2018-10-16 10:35:00,1224,"Greetings,I was pondering starting a new thread under this Canada Forum, with the purpose of collecting angler's thoughts about their 2018 fishing season in Canada. I delayed in starting the thread as I'm not sure about my own season, compared to recent seasons. It seemed to me that my season was ""different"" than recent seasons, but I'm not sure that I can put my finger on any explanations! I noticed a comment by Pooch on a nearby thread where he made the exact same comments.My wife and I still caught plenty of walleyes this season, in terms of numbers. We also caught fish with good size. Thus, by no means was it a bad season.It seems to me that we weren't catching fish in the ""usual"" places or depth of water. It seemed to me that the walleyes were more dispersed than in recent years, and those dispersed fish were on the move more than normal. I checked my fishing journal and noticed that the water temperature in the lakes that I fished were mostly lower than in years past. The water level in the lakes was at an all-time low this season. We also experienced many weeks with hazy skies due to nearby and distant wild fires.Do these observations explain this season as being ""different"" than other recent seasons? I don't know.Maybe you have your own observations from the 2018 season. So, how was your 2018 fishing season in Canada?Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6253814,Mojo-NC,2018-10-16 16:44:00,1929,"BornToFish, I think I would sum up 2018 by saying we had the best year ever in terms of numbers. Like everyone else who fished early in the season (1st week of June), we were initially very concerned about the late ice-out. Once we arrived and started fishing, those concerns went away pretty quickly. The fish were spread out and I would say the only real difference I noticed was that the walleyes definitely preferred slower moving baits - specifically jigs over dragging spinner rigs. I noticed that many of the fish we caught on spinner rigs were when we stopped the boat for whatever reason. Based on that observation I started dropping jigs tipped with minnows when that occurred and it was game on. We would use the spinner rigs as search baits and then switch to jigs. A couple of our guys struggled early on because of their lack of experience jigging, but they caught on nicely by week's end. Water temps were in the mid 50's and the fish were mostly in 8 - 18' of water, going out as deep as 25'. We caught fish in all of our usual spots and found a few new ones as well. We also try to focus on trying out some new techniques each year that we typically haven't used much previously. This year is was the slow death rig using several variations. That was a lot of fun and we caught some really nice fish (both walleye and pike) using the technique. Another technique that other guys in my group were using pretty successfully was ripping rattle traps over deep water structure. They caught a pair of 29"" walleyes and a 40"" pike using that technique. There's a song by the hard rock band Saliva called Click, Click, Boom. I would often say those 3 words while jigging this year with the Click Click being the bite and the Boom being the hook set. My son was sick of hearing it by the end of the week. Maybe he shouldn't have introduced me to the song."
6253848,LOWrider,2018-10-16 19:53:00,40,"Actually was thinking of a thread like this - glad you started it. This was our first year of retirement, so we spent a lot of time on the lake as opposed to our normal 3-4 trips. Generally I would agree with the 'different' comment, but since it was our first time seeing all of the seasons change, not sure my observations support that. Starting with ice season Jan - March. Jan & Feb seemed pretty normal with a walleye bite that tended to be active best mid-day to late afternoon. I was introduced to jigging raps for Crappies and shown some tactics by friends of my brother, and can gladly say that we were able to locate Crappies Feb - Mar pretty consistently across the lake. So in general Walleye fishing seemed steady/slow and Crappies better than usual. May - June. Fished for three straight weeks starting with the second week into June. During May we found Walleyes all over in all depths. Lots of small males as is usual, and a few bigger females, but not many. As May turned to June, the big females started showing up. We had several visits from Family and our little friendly contest ended up with the largest at 29, and several contenders 26-28 (for those scowling - we don't keep anything over 18 and often don't keep anything at all). Only problem with the first few weeks was only Walleye/Sauger. Perch / Crappies non-existent. Then the third week of June - the bottom fell out. We struggled to find anything using every tactic we know - jigging, crawler harnesses, etc. Notable event for June was we actually caught an eelpout - first time I've seen that while not on the ice. July. Fished the first couple weeks of July. Glad to say the we had what we call typical for this time, consistent Walleye on the humps, and a good mix of Perch and occasional Crappies. Lots of family came up and they had a good time seeing what this lake can really do. August - September. Things got hot, the fires were smoking the area up and Walleye fishing got poor fast. I mean really poor for about three weeks. We would fish most of a day and struggle to catch a couple 'keepers'. 10 inch Saugers seemed to be common enough. The interesting thing is we did great on the Crappies. Great is not an exaggeration, we caught 15+ Crappies several times, in fairly shallow water - 12' - 15' or so (yes guys we returned many of them to the lake for you next time). They weren't everywhere but they were in lots of places we typically get Walleyes in summer. Not sure if the slow Walleye fishing and good Crappie fishing were related somehow. From there mostly Duck hunted so don't have much to report on the fishing. Fished a couple times and didn't do great, but can't say if that means anything. So that's the report from us. Will be interesting to see how things are next year. Already anxious for hardwater fishing! Look forward to other posts to see how your seasons were."
6253852,Overwatchmike,2018-10-16 20:16:00,201,This year can be summed up in one word for me. RAIN! RAIN! RAIN! This year was so frustrating for us due to the constant rain. My camp being on a reservoir and this years constant rise and fall of the reservoir had the fishing the hardest I've ever experienced in the 20 years of ownership. Made it feel better when locals were complaining about how hard the fishing was.Sent from my SM-G955U using Tapatalk
6253896,spurs101,2018-10-17 07:11:00,635,"I went the first week of July. Way above average temps..air and surface temp. I expected deeper fishing in the 16 -20 foot range. With constant south/west winds which apparently set up a very consistent bite. 13 to 10 fow. Great numbers in the 17-23 range. Three 28's but didn't break 30. Lost a few that were potential 30's. All on trolling jigs, drifting, back trolling. I normally go 1st week of June or first week of Sept so it was hard to compare. Mayfly hatch..no problem. They were hitting like crazy. Even lake trout up high. Jig and twister, no live bait needed. My new pattern will be back 1st week of July. I don't want to miss the April, May June bite on the local lakes."
6254116,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2018-10-17 22:46:00,240,"Hi--enjoying reading these posts! Good thread. I fished Onepine Lake with NFO June 15-20, and it was a 5-star trip. Perfect early summer weather. Never got the Guidewear out all week. 5 guys went through 100 dozen minnows by the 4th day of the trip. Glad I brought a few pounds of leeches for backup. The walleye were on all week, and we caught a number of 24""+ fish, which is good work for an outpost lake. Fish were stacked up in 8-12 feet. None of us had ever been to this lake, but following the spots marked up on the map, and zeroing in on the sweet spot with the depthfinder, made for easy fishing. A great trip, and hoping to get back this summer. In my opinion, there's not a better outfitter than Dave and Michelle at Nestor Falls Outposts. But I'm sure a lot of people feel that way about there own favorite lake and outfitter. Trip #2 was a July 13-19 trip to Deer Lake (South Rapids outpost) with Eddie Showalter. The fishing was disappointing. Scorching hot weather, flat calm conditions to start the trip, followed quickly by a cold front which produced a ton of wind and lightning, and subsequent forest fires. The lake was at least 2-3 feet low, so the ""rapids"" were barely a trickle by mid-July. We fished hard and long to catch enough walleyes for our daily fry. When we fished the portage lake above the ""rapids,"" the fishing was good, but not great by any means. Eddie was a great host and a great pilot, and we had a good time despite the disappointing fishing. I would like to try another trip with Eddie, but on a different lake, and in June, not July/August. Booked at Clear Lake with NFO for mid-June, and looking at a repeat trip to Onepine in early June. Thanks to the author for starting this thread, and I am really enjoying reading the author's work on Perrault Lake. A great read, very informative."
6254248,38bill,2018-10-18 12:01:00,331,My wife and I headed up just north of Vermillion Bay for the last full week of July. Weather was pretty nice but it was a little windy. Caught nice fish at most of our favorite spots. Lots of nice smallies caught while walleye fishing too. I ended up with my biggest walleye ever at 10lb-12ozs caught while slip bobber fishing. We would mark fish and then stop and bobber fish. It worked really well. I would say that 2018 was a very good year.
6254498,packpro,2018-10-19 14:05:00,695,"Bit of a crazy trip for us. Seems like each year is different. Usually we catch great numbers and have our favorite spots. This year we caught good numbers, but the bite for us was spot on a spot. Past years we would catch fish on a nice drift, this year you had to be right on the 4' x 4' area. Love the weed lines, but the late ice out did not have them full grown and defined. Had a day where we killed them on a short portage lake. Went back two days later, same wind, same overcast, same temp, no lightning between outings. Every single spot.....Nada. Found them in different areas, but had to pick one here-one there. Had a better year nailing big Pike in he walleye spots. Lots of 36"" plus fish, big girths, big heads and few right at 40"" We usually get 2-3 this size while walleye fishing. This year 12-14 of them. Nice upgrade during the day. Better smallmouth fishing this year. Caught the prespawn in early June. Plus a few more Muskies while bass fishing. They are getting bigger every year. Still a very good trip, just different. Just about the time we think we have it figured out. Time to go. However that provides a whole year of new strategy discussions. Gets us through the winter."
6254844,oldlund,2018-10-21 10:07:00,209,"Fished LOTW near barrier islands mid July and Wiley/crow rock area. Fished humps, islands and fish all over but really struggled to get any above 18 inches. And I mean like 75 under for 1 over. We mixed it up a lot. Not sure what we were doing wrong. Still a lot of fun. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"
6254858,David Anderson,2018-10-21 10:43:00,2073,"Fished Lac Seul 4 times this year, 1 on opener, 2 middle of June, 4, middle of September in Chamberlain Narrows, 3rd trip was on the West side out of Fishemans Cove. 1. Opener, Fish were plentiful and shallow. Had my best day ever, 158 walleyes in the boat, 3 guys, 7 hours. Averaged a fish every 2.5 minutes. Size was well represented however more fish over 18 than under. Did get my personal best, 30+ inch walleye but she was definitely post spawn.2. June, fishing was tough, OK who's going to complain catching 70 walleyes/day/boat yet we really had to work for them. Traditional points and reefs were off and fish seemed somewhat deeper and scattered. 3. August. On the West side we tend to fish the midlake humps more. We had some points and close in humps (15 - 22 feet) that did really well last year but this year they just didn't seemed to have any fish on them. We did better on the main lake humps in 20 - 25 feet however they were scattered as well. Always had plenty to eat and caught some nice fish but we had to search.4. Mid September. Same story, fish were scattered and deep. Again, not complaining about lack of fish however the water was down about 2 feet or so. We fish one area where a river comes in and it was usually roaring however it was down to a trickle. I think the low water had a definite effect on the current in traditional areas where there is usually some water flow hence holds more fish. We never tried the 30 foot areas but it was a topic of discussion. We did catch plenty of smaller fish on points were there was some water flow.Conclusion, It was not our best year as I think the low levels and the late spring had an effect on the year as a whole, however next year brings a whole new game!!!"
