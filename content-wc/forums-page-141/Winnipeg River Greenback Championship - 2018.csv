6253560,Habitual Eyer,2018-10-15 13:42:00,144,I would like to find last weekends tourney results at Pine Falls. Anyone have anything they can share ?
6253576,Hawgeye,2018-10-15 15:00:00,1355,"http://kickerfish.ca/kevin-fryklund-...-championship/ I am not positive this is the correct 2018 results but it appears to be updated. Looks like the winning weight was as low as 27.58 lbs. The site I found this from is above . Winning team was Lloyd and Earl Gillis with a day 1 weight of 19.58 and day two of 8.0 lbs.....4 fish per day. Wow, if that is the case, it was a tough bite!"
6253638,mrwalleye5,2018-10-15 19:47:00,1922,If you are looking for the tournament that took place last weekend at Pine Falls this is it. Disregard the 2015 in the link. 39lbs isnâ€™t to shabby! Sorry this is Oct 6 and 7.http://kickerfish.ca/2015-voyageurs-walleye-classic/
