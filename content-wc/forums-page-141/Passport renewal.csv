5987561,Whopper,2018-02-06 11:36:00,340,"Hi Keith, I have a passport card and it has served me well for my trips north of the border. One thing I like about it, it fits in my wallet and I carry it all the time so I never have to worry about forgetting it on my trips. I'm good to go until Sept 2019 Take care"
5987617,Ogoki,2018-02-06 12:30:00,291,"Greetings Phil !! When I posted this i had already applied for renewal of Passport and had went the Passport Card route. Just got to thinking about it and you know how that goes. Can't see me going anywhere out of the country , except by my truck to Ontario. We are headed to Armstrong , end of May for another spring bear hunt with Duane. Keith"
5987641,Lovetofish,2018-02-06 12:39:00,458,I think my passport is good for a year or two. We got them the first year it was required to return from Canada so when was that? My wife and I have the passport cards. No plans for us that would require the passport book.
5988337,DeBo,2018-02-06 17:49:00,211,2008 was the year passports started to be required. Mine expired this month.... I had mine back within 2 weeks of dropping it off at the USPS. I would check your expiration date.
6252798,BornToFish,2018-10-11 14:16:00,1224,"Greetings, I returned home a few weeks ago from my last fishing trip of the season in NW Ontario. I happened to notice that my passport was about to expire. It turned out that my wife's passport was also about to expire. We decided to have our passports renewed now, as we likely will not look at them again until next spring. My wife printed the passport renewal forms from the internet. We then had our passport photographs taken at a local Walgreen's store. We mailed the documentation along with a personal check in the amount of $220 ($110 per person). The renewed passports arrived in today's mail - just twelve business days later! We did not pay extra for expedited service. This might be a good time to check the expiration date on your passport and encourage others in your group to do the same. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6252806,Lovetofish,2018-10-11 14:53:00,458,Went the passport card route and it will expire in early next year. If I did the renewal now will the new passport become effective the date my old one expires?
6252854,BornToFish,2018-10-11 17:38:00,1224,"Greetings, I don't know the answer to the question in the previous post. But, I can say that the date of issue for my wife's and my new passports is the day the new passport was processed. The issue date is not the date following the expiration of our previous passports. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6252864,Misdirection,2018-10-11 18:50:00,418,One reason to get the passport in addition to the pass card is in the event of emergency and you need to fly back.Sent from my XT1635-01 using Tapatalk
5981850,Ogoki,2018-02-03 08:03:00,291,"In process of renewing our passports. Mentioned to my friends and none of them thought about checking theirs, which all expired this spring. Just a friendly reminder."
5981882,DeBo,2018-02-03 08:17:00,211,Mine is at the renewal center... for the 2nd time. I managed to properly double check everything but forgot to sign and date the application and they sent it back. So another friendly reminder for a different part of the process.
5981922,stjoeguy,2018-02-03 08:27:00,979,"Good until Feb. 2019, but remind me again in 9 months. In fact, I think I'll put it on the calendar now. Thanks."
5982066,packpro,2018-02-03 09:09:00,695,Thanks for the update. Just E-mail blasted my group.
5982202,Mojo-NC,2018-02-03 10:56:00,1929,My buddy just had his passport application returned because he was wearing glasses in the photo. I looked at my passport and I'm wearing glasses in my picture. What's up with that?
5982218,stjoeguy,2018-02-03 11:06:00,979,"Requirement for new passports as of November 1, 2016."
5982386,pjshorthorn,2018-02-03 13:37:00,5654,"Can you remind me to remind you 9 months from now? ...LOL. Seems like I'm having to remind myself , on most anything, way too much anymore. I did remember to renew my passport last year so I'm good for a while. Now where I put it is a whole different story that I'd rather not get into.PjShorthorn"
5982402,pjshorthorn,2018-02-03 13:43:00,5654,"I did my renewal application online last year about this time, printed out the forms, signed them and mailed it in with my old passport ,pictures and a check. None of this standing in line at a post office or an office certified to process your application. I had my new and old passport back within two weeks. I was blown away that anything in our government could be that efficient, but maybe the cookies and candy I sent in the package helped grease the wheels a bit. PjShorthorn"
5982498,Ogoki,2018-02-03 14:46:00,291,"Has anyone got the Passport Card instead of the Passport book ? In ten years we have never flown into Ontario. We take everything with us on fly in and the bears hunts we just need too much gear. We go to Armstrong and if we flew , we would have to go to Thunder Bay and then rent a car to proceed to Armstrong. For my wife and I we are looking at a $160 difference in cost of the two. Few weeks ago I flew to Memphis on business. By car 10 hours. Took 14 to get there . Coming back took from 5 a.m. Until 12:45 that night to pull into my driveway. Really can't see me flying abroad or into or out of Canada . Just some thoughts."
5982514,spurs101,2018-02-03 15:02:00,635,"I went the passcard route for both my wife and I. Had enough foreign travel to not want to go back. Couldn't see paying the higher passport fee . Just got notice in mail today that I'm approved and received picture and passport back. Travel card and documentation to be sent in a separate mailing. I would have to fly into North Bay via Toronto and load all that gear and probably pay an arm and a leg on baggage, plus rental car. No way, I'll take the relaxing drive up along the GLs, stop at the Soo, and head from there. Besides, we take our lab with us."
