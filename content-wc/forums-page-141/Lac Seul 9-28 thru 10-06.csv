When we arrived the water temp was 49.8 and when we left it was 47.5. At the Deception landing, the temp was 50.1 Saturday morning. To say the least we struggled like never before to find a consistent bite. All of our favorite spots were fished and the catch was spotty. Our numbers were down by 50% and the sizes we caught were about the same as always. 40% in or over the slot the rest under 18"". One nice northern, 40 "" about 20 lbs I'd guess, a few smallies. We really had to search to find the fish. Never really marked the numbers we are used to seeing. Everyone I talked to seemed to have the same results. When we stopped for gas on the way out in International Falls at Fast Gas, Holly said all the reports she had heard were the same, Very slow bite. She had mentioned that her father was up at Minnetonki in Sioux Lookout and he also reported slow fishing, so I guess it wasn't just our group. I was wondering, maybe we hit the turnover or something because the bite was disturbing. I will say that the stay at Lac Seul Outposts was terrific. The owners Ken and Brenda were pleasant as usual and the staff was very helpful. They supplied us with fantastic minnows, just the size we like, thanks Vicki. We had snow 3 days and rain 2 days so we did our shore lunch back at the cabin. The camp staff had a fire going in the cabin when we returned for lunch and when we returned at the end of each day. Very nice to come back to a warm cabin. Does anyone know when Lac Seul turns over? Still planning on returning same time and place next year, 1 out of 20 slow is a pretty good batting average.

We went from catching 100 walleye a day with at least 10% of them over 18"" on LOTW to the humps holding nothing. Was out yesterday with a buddy, fished Andrews Bay and around Scotty Island for bass and walleye and probably had the worst day of the year, 2 walleye between us on typically very productive humps. I don't really know what happened, yesterday even saw large schools of baitfish in deeper water with no larger fish at all."
