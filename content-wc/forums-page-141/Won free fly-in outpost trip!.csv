This does not bode well for me when I really retire...I'm kinda just faking it right now I wish I could join you and Doc. It would be a blast and the buffet would be epic with some walleye, wolverine, nervous chicken and Mechicken with some tasty Irish stew. PjShorthorn"
6240604,Mojo-NC,2018-09-03 09:13:00,1929,Congrats Terry. You have a lot of envious WC'ers here I'm sure. I also entered the contest. I wonder what I would have done if my name had been chosen because my wife and I planned a Caribbean cruise on those same dates. I think I still would have gone fishing and taken the financial hit to reschedule the cruise to a later date.
6240668,pjshorthorn,2018-09-03 13:05:00,5654,Your are a brave man Charlie Brown. I'm not going to lie.....I would have done the same thing...LOL. PjShorthorn

6250980,DougBlack,2018-10-03 08:29:00,29,How was trip?
6251160,mctbone,2018-10-03 17:03:00,26,"Trip was cold but fun. Mornings in the 30s and daytime highs in the 40s. Some rain first day. Got walleyes every day. Day 3 was best. They were on fire. Mike had a string of about 8 consecutive casts with fish and we caught at least 50 fish that day, despite the short days and not getting out until 11:30 due to wind, rain and cold temperatures. Day 4 was almost as good, but the fish shut down before days' end. No pike of any size, but we really didn't fish them. Little Miss is a walleye lake without much in the way of pike so 90% of our fishing was for walleyes. Overall, better than average size walleyes with very few under 17 inches and quite a few 20-23. I believe the largest was 24"", but all were very thick bodied. Most fish were caught on jig and paddletail or jig and twister tipped with a piece of worm. When they got real slow, I was able to coax a few more with a jig and worm. We didn't do much backtrolling. Mostly relied on Mike's ability to find a likely spot and drift it with jigs. That's a quick summary. I'm sure Mike will come out with a much more detailed report eventually."
6240270,mctbone,2018-09-02 08:00:00,26,Got a call from Mike Borger last night telling me I won a free trip with him to Air Dale's Little Missinaibi outpost Sept 26-30 as a result of entering a contest on his website. So excited as I thought my fishing was done for the year. Terry
6240276,kona77,2018-09-02 08:13:00,236,Congrats.. Fishing big gators with Mike B would be a blast and great learning experience. Have a great time. I am sure we will see a report.
6240282,That Minnesota guy,2018-09-02 08:19:00,8293,"Congrats, you will have a good time I think. Mike has a nice site he just needs to get some more traffic. I like it because it's Pike heavy with info although the Walleye guys have plenty of input. Be sure to take lots of photo's and bring some warm clothes."
6240288,kzoofisher,2018-09-02 08:35:00,5144,"Your wife called and said you were busy, sorry about that. I'll take your place so it doesn't go to waste."
6240316,Mike Borger,2018-09-02 10:11:00,1554,"Congrat's Terry, very glad you're able to make the trip, we'll have a blast!"
6240500,HeHooksHimself,2018-09-02 21:28:00,725,"I was so sure I was going to win that trip I submitted the vacation request the day I entered the contest. Oh well, congratulations to you, but at least I will have the cleanest garage in the county! So Jealous! Hooks"
6240524,PRO-V1,2018-09-03 06:06:00,142,...............congrats what a great ending to the season.Mike
6240526,pjshorthorn,2018-09-03 06:12:00,5654,Since when do retired guys have to submit for vacation days off? PjShorthorn
6240548,lassh,2018-09-03 07:04:00,553,Lucky dog!! Have a great trip!
6240566,HeHooksHimself,2018-09-03 08:05:00,725,"In retirement I have to clear everything with the wife. She is pretty good about it though, she had a full knee replacement on Aug. 16 yet I am still leaving for Canada on Friday. She is a good boss! If you can free yourself to join us, Pat, we are bringing some wild game up since we killed a Wolverine Saturday night!"
