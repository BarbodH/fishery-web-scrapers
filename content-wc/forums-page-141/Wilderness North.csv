I'm interested in them because they will accommodate groups of 2, which would be my brother and myself. Putting together a group of 6-8 guys has become increasingly difficult, so I seek out outfitters like Wilderness North or Mattice Lake Outfitters that will work with small groups. I did a search on this site, but didn't find much of anything recent or relevant. I'm deciding between a stay at Striker's Point Lodge or at D'Alton Lake, one of their outpost camps. Myself, I prefer the outpost experience, but my brother loves a lodge with Wifi. Anyway, thanks much for anything anyone can provide, info. wise."
6254578,chris.brock,2018-10-19 22:47:00,112,"I bet if you made some phone calls, quite a few outfitters would try and accommodate a party of 2 at a reasonable price. I don't know anything about Wilderness North. Check out MLO's camp on Whitewater. I think they call it a mini lodge, but it's cabins 200yds apart on a beach. I've been there, I liked the camp and loved the lake. That might be a compromise for you and your brother."
6254580,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2018-10-19 23:46:00,240,"Thanks, Chris. I have flown with Mattice Lake Outfitters (Auger Lake) and I loved the experience. So, yes, they are on the short list. Will be going to the All-Canada show in Green Bay this January, but I hope to have booked with an outfitter before then. Thanks for the reply."
6254658,Boxerboy,2018-10-20 09:55:00,4,"Just for what it's worth, I was booking a fishing trip in Northern Ontario for a group of 8 guys in 2019. E-mailed back & forth for about 3 weeks. The last correspondence was that I had asked him how he wanted the deposit money sent & would he be so kind as to give me a couple of references. His reply was that he was too busy to answer my questions. No references no go. Don't believe everything you read on the internet. Always ask for references. Red Pine Lodge Ivanhoe Lake. Now I'm starting all over again. Just say'in!"
6254674,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2018-10-20 11:12:00,240,"Thanks. One of the first things Wilderness North did was to offer connections to references. I agree, that is very important. That is one of the chief reasons I started this thread, to get ""references"" from those who have been there in the past few years. I first got interested in this outfitter by watching an episode of Troy Lindner's ""The Ontario Experience,"" a very well-produced, informative show which is available on YouTube. Good luck with your search! The searching/planning is a big part of the fun of a trip."

You should also check out their boat-in outposts if that lake interests you still.Also, MI Walleye guy, as for Wilderness North, they always seemed to be off the radar and a bit on the pricey side. Looks like a good operation, but I have not read much from anyone who has been to their lodges/camps. Always interested me though. They started flying out of Nakina for some of their lodges now at least. As for minimum parties. A lot of places will allow 2. Some outfitters will just an additional fee, but not all. I suggest contacting Brace Lake Outfitters, Ara Lake Camp or Meta Lake Lodge as well."
6254761,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2018-10-20 22:37:00,240,"Thanks for the info. Brace Lake Outfitters has always interested me, since seeing Mike Borger's report/article on that lake. If they would accommodate a group size of 2, they would definitely be a strong consideration. I'm going to contact them and find out. Thanks again."
6254834,gordy28,2018-10-21 09:32:00,437,"So I went to Miminiska Losge w Wilderness North in 2016. I was lucky to get invited on a trip my father in law planned. I wasn’t involved in any of the planning, just showed up. Overall was a great trip, wilderness north and their staff run a good camp and overall the operation seemed very efficient and smooth. My only comment on the negative side would be for a very expensive trip ($2600 USD for 4 nights) was that things I would have expected to be included like bait were an extra charge and not cheap. Also things ordered through the lodge like beer etc was also very expensive. My guess is their targeted clientele don’t care and I wasn’t paying but I was just a little surprised. The fishing on Mim was incredible though. My two cents would be if you are going to book with them get a clear understanding of what’s included, what’s not and if you require extras what’s the cost. I am Canadian so things that seemed really expensive to me at a 30% mark up to USD may not seem as bad to someone from the USCheersGordy"
6254856,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2018-10-21 10:40:00,240,"Thanks, Gordy. I am aware of the cost of lodge life with this outfitter, which is why booking one of their outposts (D'Alton Lake) seems more cost effective to me. Pretty reasonable/comparable to many of the local outpost lakes with other outfitters. Thanks for the fishing info. on Mim."
