I used various methods for installing my unit in the lodge's boats, but eventually migrated to plastic brackets that mount on the track within the gunnel - e.g. the Lund Sport-Trac. G3 boats have a similar track on their boats. I believe that G3 and Lund boats with the gunnel tracks are fairly common at many fishing lodge throughout NW Ontario. I used a G3 brand bracket last season and most of this fishing season. This bracket failed on our fishing trip in August. I switched to a Lund style bracket during my September fishing trip and found it difficult to remove from the boat when packing to return home. A friend on Walleye Central told me about an aluminum bracket from Cisco Fishing Systems in Cleveland, Ohio. I just received my MTU42 bracket from Cisco Fishing Systems. It looks incredibly robust! The bracket is made from a piece of 3/8 inch thick aluminum bar. All other components are made from stainless steel or aluminum. I sent my larger (3.625 inch diameter base) and smaller (2.375 inch diameter base) RAM balls to Cisco Fishing Systems so they could customize the hole pattern in the bracket to accept the RAM balls. David Logan at Cisco Fishing Systems was delightful to work with throughout the project. The cost of the bracket was $67. There were additional charges for shop time and shipping. Someone with access to a drill press and a set of taps could customize their own hole pattern and save on the shop time. I recommend the MTU42 bracket from Cisco Fishing Systems to anyone that might be looking for a better way to mount their personal gps/sonar units when they fish from a Lund or G3 boat at their fishing lodge of choice. Good Fishing and Tight Lines!!"

I have a Lowrance Elite4 HDI that I place in their portable/ice fishing case which is sufficient. However, I am open to improvements. Thanks for sharing. Dave"
6253446,BornToFish,2018-10-15 07:59:00,1224,"Greetings,I too am always looking for better ways to do things when fishing. This quest led me to the MTU42 bracket from Cisco Fishing Systems. I attached two photographs of the bracket with the RAM ball mounted to it. I did not show the RAM arm or the Humminbird Helix 9.In the photographs of the ""back"" of the bracket, I have the stainless steel ""clips"" in two different positions to show how the clips will engage the Sport-Trac channel within the boat's gunnel. The clip in the extended position is ready to be inserted into the Sport-Trac channel.In the photograph of the ""front"" of the bracket, you will see the mounted RAM ball. You will also see two knurled knobs. You might be able to make out the red line on the flat surface of the small knurled knob. You use these red lines as a visual indicator of the 90 degree turn needed to engage the clips in the Sport-Trac channel. The larger knurled knob is used to loosen or tighten the clips in the Sport-Trac channel.The RAM ball + bracket shown in the picture weighs 1.6 pounds. I'm pretty sure the RAM ball is over one-half of the weight.You might want to check with the outfitter to verify his boats at the fly-in camp have the Lund Sport-Trac style gunnel. I'm not sure that older Naden or Alumarine boats would have this style of gunnel.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6253470,DavKin,2018-10-15 09:04:00,104,Thank you. I forgot to ask how you secure the battery?
6253506,BornToFish,2018-10-15 10:05:00,1224,"Greetings, I power my Humminbird unit with the starter battery for the boat's motor. I installed alligator style clips to the electrical leads. I believe there is a three amp fuse on the positive lead. I pass the leads through the rubber collar on the boat's splashwell and then connect them to the posts on the battery. It takes about 2-3 minutes to install everything and have the unit powered up. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
