6250962,DavKin,2018-10-03 07:54:00,104,"Just curious if and how often anyone fishes with blue lead and/or floating jigs? During a recent trip to an outpost camp north of Red Lake, a pink and blue floating jig caught more fish than pink or perch. I see H2O precision jigs has a Ford blue but in 20 years of fishing for walleye, this is the first year I tried some blue."

6250982,SteveZ,2018-10-03 08:35:00,271,I use blue/white and purple/white jigs frequently on the English River. Make my own.

6251040,BornToFish,2018-10-03 12:07:00,1224,"Greetings, My wife and I experimented in 2017 with my ""home made"" jigs painted with a blue glitter powder paint. We liked it so much that it became one of our ""go to"" colors in 2018. It seemed that at least one of us had one in the water at all times. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6251182,The tank,2018-10-03 18:11:00,340,My go to jig is a glow blue knuckle ball jig with a glow white hoochie goochie go to bait.
6251530,valley366,2018-10-05 13:05:00,193,"We went to a resort for a number of years that had 3 interconnected lakes. The main lake the jigs I used 90% of the time was either blue or purple. Strangely when dragging spoons and Mepps Spinners the blue shades dominated too. On the two other lakes Gold was best on one and bright yellows, green and orange on the other.Lindy makes some nice purple and blue jigs. They can take abuse too."
