Interested in water levels, water temp, flow, shiner run and the greenbacks (size & numbers of fish being caught). Understand there is a tournament this weekend so specifics not needed. Thanks in advance."

Water is about 3-4 feet lower than usual.We fished Pine Falls Tuesday Oct 2. Fished from 8:30 to 4:15. We started on the lake. Tried depths from 11' to 20'. Water temp was 51.5F.Having caught nothing, nada, zilch we moved to the mouth of the River. Fished near Two Hearts. Caught two itsy bitsy teeny weeny walleye and a mini perch.Went further back into the River and caught nothing in spite of fishing 5 spots.River temp was 52.5F. There is no flow in the River. OK, a little noticeable at Treaty rock.Pine Falls has become progressively worse for us over the past 6 weeks.So to borrow the words of Linda Perry/4Non BlondesWhat's Up WHATS GOING ON? The Red is maybe a bit better but at the same time more fisher-people fishing it also."

6252318,luv2huntnfish,2018-10-09 15:05:00,73,"I heard from another source that the quality fish from the tournament were taken way out they were not taken in river, in Traverse Bay, or anywhere close to those areas. I am curious if the above is accurate how is the fishing is in the river and Traverse Bay areas as I do not wish to travel 20 to 40 miles from the dock to find fish. Thanks in advance."
