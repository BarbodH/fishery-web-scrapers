Kag is interesting both in size, multi species and appears to vary quite a bit in that you have the main lake, Humboldt bay and the inflows. It always makes it to the final 5 an never makes the final cut. Clear water is not my preference especially for walleye an pike waters. Chris & Phish appreciate your thoughts."
6249558,adempsey2.0,2018-09-27 14:33:00,611,"I really have no recollection of Kag being what I would call ""clear"" at all. I don't think the water clarity was different than most lakes I have fished out of Nakina or White River/Wawa/Hornepayne.Fished first week of July a few years ago. Spring was late. Walleye were still migrating into the main lake. Fishing the inflowing rivers was incredible. Most other spots would pop out a few fish since they were still moving in. Barely scratched the surface of that lake, it is quite large. The Opichuan goes for a long ways and opens up into another lake you can get into if you wish. It should not be a question if you should go to Kag, it should be where to stay and when to go.I would go back for sure."
6249600,phishfearme,2018-09-27 17:39:00,1242,"a few final points: - streams that are formed by the outlet of lakes (like the opichuan river - which most of us would call a creek) get water from the surface of the upstream lake which in summer is the warmest water around - sometimes approaching 80 degF). specks are very sensitive to water temperature (as are lakers) and cannot survive in water much warmer than the upper 60's degF. so how do they survive? enter the underground or ""side stream"" springs - whose temperature is the average annual air temperature which in this region is about 43degF - very nice for specks - and also wonderful for keeping beer cold. so, unless you can find an area in the opichuan river with entering springs, there will be no specks in the summer. - specks are also very sensitive to water turbidity - so the outlet streams of mesotropic lakes rarely hold specks regardless of temperature - lakers also require cold water (and low turbidity) which in the summer is only at depths below the thermocline - below the thermocline are few organics (turbidity) which is what ""fertility"" is derived from - resulting in clear and cold water. this is oligotrophic by definition. (a side story - I went swimming in the summer in an oligotrophic lake - while treading water my feet were freezing while my upper body was quite comfortable. so, in northern ontario the thermocline may only be 6 ft deep +/-. we had been fishing for lakers with downriggers and planers to 50ft +/- with minimal success but then switched to 10-12 ft diving plugs and did quite well.) if kag holds lakers it is at least oligotrophic at depth - and the outlet river must have springs somewhere along the length. you may be able to get specks in the spring throughout the opicuan river but in the summer they retreat to cold water entry points. here endeth the biology lesson for today. phish"
6249664,515,2018-09-27 19:48:00,254,I fished Kag this summer mid july and can help you out with lots of info. We used Twin lakes Outfitters and their camps are in the right location on the lake to always be on fish. Chad and Dawn work hard to keep camps up to expectations and will work to keep your group happy. I know they have the right spot as daily we were seeing other boats in and around our camp fishing and not once did any of our three boats feel the need to head towards the other outfitters camps on north end of lake. I'm trying to find the time to get a report together with pics but its hunting season now so i'm a bit distracted. PM your phone number and I'll call (I have unlimited long distance North America wide) if you want some evening this week and answer any questions you have. Kag lake is a walleye factory you won't be disappointed with it.
6249674,Crede,2018-09-27 20:07:00,134,"Fished Kag twice with Leuenbergers. Once in late May, once in mid-June. Agree that it is a walleye factory. Also has tons of structure. Can't comment on other species as we only fished walleyes both trips. Time from Leuenbergers Lodge to creeks at south end of lake 20 minutes to give you some perspective when you look at a map. I think that the water is a little less stained than some other lakes in the area, but I'm not sure I would have noticed that if someone hadn't said that to me ahead of time. I have nothing but good to say about Leuenbergers and Kag Lodge."
6252570,hoppy63,2018-10-10 16:24:00,367,You have PM.
6248950,hoppy63,2018-09-25 19:23:00,367,"Looking for info on Kag lake....I know there are several outfitters but is large body of water. Looking for any input on any of the outfitters, what fishing is like at any time of year, areas, etc....any info i can get will be appreciated. Just curious of what to expect on this lake. I also know being big body of water that wind can come into play so would need to take that into consideration also when looking for a camp. Thanks for any info."
6248978,Namegosikaa,2018-09-25 20:45:00,61,"Guess it comes down to what your looking for, twin lakes camps are at the southwest end with access to humble bay which is arguably the best part of the lake for walleye plus lake trout directly east of camp in the main lake. If brook trout is on the agenda you may want to be closer to the north end where the lodge may interest you if your looking for some more comfort. Mattice lake outfitters also has a beautiful camp close to the lodge if your looking to be alone in a housekeeping package, being a mattice camp it's going to be very nice and flying out of Armstrong may be an advantage depending on where your coming from"
6248980,chris.brock,2018-09-25 20:59:00,112,"Clear water, a little atypical for the area. A deep, oligotrophic lake trout lake. Twin Lakes also has Van Poele, a smaller, private lake if the winds are up and you can boat through a channel and pop out on the E side of Kag. My choice would be Twin Lakes camps at the narrows going into Humble Bay though."
6249048,vteye3,2018-09-26 07:41:00,496,A lake our group has considered as we like the multi-species aspect. Anyone want to share on there experience?
6249142,hoppy63,2018-09-26 12:56:00,367,"A couple in our group are interested in brookies. I just don't know how good the chances are to hook one or how hard it is to access them. These guys are mid 60's so a bunch of walking slippery rocks not a good idea. I would like to hook a laker, so I'm curious of what those chances are if we go early in year, and are walleye and pike caught in good numbers? I'm not necessarily interested in 100 a day....if I catch 20-30 fish I'm more than happy."
6249172,phishfearme,2018-09-26 15:07:00,1242,"please let me add my 2 cents here. although I have not specifically fished Kag, I have fished a number of oligotrophic lakes in northern Ontario - and we sounded like you, trying to find multiple species, not just pike and walleye. my experience is that these infertile lakes simply do not hold good populations of walleye and pike - they can house nice trout populations but unless there are huge shallower areas (for spawning and feedng), do not expect good walleye or pike. your best bet is to contact the outfitter and get names of people who were there last year around the same time you are planning. if he is hesitant (client privacy maybe), one alarm should be set off - so ask him to please contact one of his clients and ask that the client contact you. if this doesn't work, maybe it's time to look elsewhere. concerning brookies in the Kag lake outlet stream - we fished the lake downstream of Kag (abazotikichuan or just plain aba which is on the Albany river) and tried to walk upstream to catch some brookies. forget it - broke a rod, got stuck in the numerous deadfalls but did manage one 5 inch brookie. again - ask the outfitter for references of people who have tried this. one lake where we did have excellent walleye/pike AND lakers is springpole lake just downstream of huge Birch Lake. the deep oligotrophic portion is isolated from the portion where the birch river flows. this allowed us to focus on lakers in front of the cabin where 100ft depths are common (but pike and walleye were tough) and travel down to the birch river and focus on walleye and pike with lots of success (no lakers). this is indeed a rare situation. good luck phish"
6249174,Namegosikaa,2018-09-26 15:07:00,61,"The Opichuan river has two sets of rapids close to the lake outflow that hold brookies but fishing from a boat would be tough, wading and walking would be most likely your best approach. I'm with Chris Brock, the twin lakes camps are very nice and close to the best action. His vanpoele suggestion is also a good one."
6249242,chris.brock,2018-09-26 17:46:00,112,"I hear ya phishfearme, deep, clear oligotrophic scares me. Kag must be different though. It's got a lodge and a bunch of camps and does have a good reputation and a big fan base."
6249262,phishfearme,2018-09-26 18:59:00,1242,"the definition of a successful fishing trip varies considerably from group to group. our first trips were to northeast Ontario and we thought we were in fishing heaven. then we worked our way to northwest Ontario and that made us forget about each of the earlier trips - then we learned more about the important differences in the lakes in the northwest - especially oligotrophic versus mesotrophic, lake size, depth structure that permits fish to survive winters, how fishing pressure can so easily wipe out wilderness lakes and on and on. it took us 20 years and quite a few poor trips, but I think now we have narrowed it down and can pick lakes and outfitters that keep us quite happy - and I think other groups do the same - just they are in different stages of experience. phish"
6249266,chris.brock,2018-09-26 19:12:00,112,"anyways, neither of us have fished Kag but from what I've read over the years, I wanna fish it someday because I believe it is a good lake, probably a unique lake, the size of it and the multi species aspect makes me think it could be a great trip"
