We caught fish jigging plastics in 16 20 fow. Water temp was 48 degrees with little flow out of the dam. Saturday and Sunday were good fishing days but little did we know that the crazy stuff was yet to come. Monday the jig bite kind of died so we went to dragging cranks. Wow is all I can say. We caught big fish pass after pass after pass. We had 4 fish over 26"" and couldn't seem to catch an under for dinner. The trolling bite was great until Friday when it shut off. Switched to jigs and it was crazy again. We stayed at Little Canada Camp for the first time and I can't thank Collin enough for a wonderful trip. We ended up with 1 30.5"", 4 28"", 1 27 1/2"", 1 27"", 12 26"", and oodles of 25""ers. We also had 4 northerns over 39"" with 42"" being the biggest."
