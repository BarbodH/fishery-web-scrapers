6249872,Spurgery,2018-09-28 15:52:00,79,Was wondering if anybody has any feedback on the quality of the cabins at Birch Point Camp on Nungesser Lake north of Red Lake? Can't find anything on their website as far as cabins are concerned. Thanks in advance. RCS
6250296,JMKC,2018-09-30 09:02:00,238,Stayed there 5 years ago in early June. Cabins were a bit rustic but very livable. The cabins had indoor toilet and shower. Propane stove and fridge. Electrical outlets were scarce. 25hp motor on 16' boats in good shape. Large lake with great fishing. Boat in camp. My buddy stays there every year.
6250452,tparker,2018-10-01 07:23:00,100,"Agree with JMKC. Haven't been there in 6 years, but the cabins were pretty basic then. I would hope they have upgraded a few things since then. Cabins had all the basics, but not much else. No ""real"" furniture to sit on except the kitchen table. If Roy Green is still the camp owner he will do everything he can to get you on fish. Enjoyed my trips there, our group just decided to try a few other places."
6250624,Spurgery,2018-10-01 17:00:00,79,Thanks guys. I am a little concerned on the size of the smaller 4 person cabins and if 4 people in one of them would be too cramped.
6250882,MikeMcC,2018-10-02 20:21:00,72,I enjoy the camp but it is fairly rustic. I have not noticed any upgrades to the cabins which are marginal. I would check to see if the 4 person cabin is 2 bunks or 4 twins. Boats are good with flat floors and nice 4 stroke 25hp yamahas.
6251890,Baitslinger,2018-10-07 20:29:00,93,"I hesitate to post my thoughts, since it's already tough at times to book a week at Birch Point . . . But . . . . . The cabins are fine. Very basic, no furniture other than dining tables and chairs. Simple bathrooms with flush toilets and showers, and fridges and kitchen appliances. Certainly nothing fancy, but very clean and entirely adequate for a fishing camp. As for the rest of the camp, it's fine too. Terrific fish house (although they will clean all your fish for you). Nice boats, late model Yamaha 25hp four strokes, and great staff. Roy, the camp owner, is a gem. A bit of a character (in the best possible sense), friendly and honest. Never have spent a day in camp without talking to him numerous times. Follow his recomendations on where and how to fish and you WILL catch plenty of fish. He has treated us, and our children, wonderfully over the decade that we have been steady customers, and now, feels more like an old friend. Can't say enough good things about Roy, or the camp. Now please don't book during my week!!"
