6252590,fishron,2018-10-10 18:59:00,317,"Just got back from our annual fall trip to Wolfe Lake in southern Ontario. This was a tough one. The week before, some wild weather came through and the wind was all wrong. NE to east and none of our traditional bays were producing. We went with the wind and managed to catch some good fish, enough that we filled our limits. My best walleye came just at dark in five feet of water as we approached our camp trolling a jr thunderstick. She measured 19.7 inches which is exactly the top end of the slot. The year before we took several over the slot walleye from our traditional bays. We don't target smallmouth but some good ones came along as did many large panfish and a few pike. We did catch walleye in sizes from six inches all the way through to slot size but not anywhere the action we're used to. The surface temperature was 64 and most fish were marked in 22ft. Deep for that temperature I felt. One of our mostly cloudy weird wind days it calmed done and the bay we were fishing was absolutely covered with schools of lake minnows over the weed beds. Too much forage? Our lake has been overtaken by Eurasian milfoil and it has affected many of the areas we fish. We had a great trip regardless with evening campfires and good comrade-re. We'll do better next year."

It was exceptional pike pike fishing though both for size and numbers. Our experience has been whenever there is an east wind the fishing shuts down. It seems every time we were up this year, the wind was out of the east or we couldn't get a stable weather pattern. Our lake turns over end of Septemberish too which makes fishing at this time difficult. Once labor day comes the walleyes mover deep, like 30-35 ft."
6252996,fishron,2018-10-12 13:14:00,317,"DF, never fished Dalhousie. Sorry to hear the fishing was slow there too. We chatted with a couple cottage owners as we fished one shoreline and they confirmed how slow the fishing has been late in the seasonon Wolfe. On another note referring to the southern Ontario region, two years ago we fished Crotch Lake, also in that area. As a side trip one day we visited a ministry fish hatchery nearby along rt 7. They had quite an operation going and were successfully rearing large numbers of walleye fingerlings along with several trout species and lake ciscos. One local lake they stocked stood out. Crowe lake near Sharbot Lake had received two walleye fingerling stockings in 2011 and 2013 of nearly 50,000 total. Could be some good walleye fishing there about now."
6253074,Shellback,2018-10-13 07:42:00,8083,"There's a Crow lake next to Bob's lake, is that the one you are talking about. Or is there another lake with the E on the end of the name? I spent 2 weeks in June, and another 2 weeks in Sept on the St Lawrence in Gananoque. Got into some nice walleye 5 to 7 pounds in June, and then a nice 2inch 9 + pounder in Sept. We had absolutely beautiful weather the first 2 weeks of Sept. All my walleye were caught dust to dark. I was by myself and after dark when I caught the 9 pounder, and landed up not being able to release it. Here's a pic from the next morning. Sorry about the sideways pic."
6253106,fishron,2018-10-13 09:22:00,317,"Nice walleye Shellback. The St Lawrence and lake Ontario have some giant walleye in them. Years ago we used to get huge ones in Oswego Harbor on Lake Ontario at night and I had a memorable night on the St Lawrence many years back where huge walleye were one after the other. The Crowe lake I mentioned is not the one connected to Bob's Lake. That one doesn't have an e. The lake and town of Sharbot Lake are another 45 minutes north and not far from the fish culture station I mentioned. I found it interesting that the lake ciscos they were raising were to be stocked in huge lake Ontario. An attempt to re-establish the species that had disappeared due to commercial overfishing. There were several other lakes in the area that received smaller numbers of walleye fingerlings. Wolfe Lake is spring fed and has never been stocked, having a native population of shoal spawning walleye."
6253536,Pooch,2018-10-15 11:42:00,4618,"Seems that most folks I talk to had a different sort of year fishing for walleye. Not really a bad year, but a ""different"" year than recent past. We also spend some time fishing for smallies and they were predictable as usual.Again, 2018 was just an odd year more or less. Neither bad nor great. Just ""different"".Folks that were not overly flexible struggled the most. Guys that moved, changed things up did better it seems.Pooch"
6254614,spw2350,2018-10-20 06:52:00,26,"Reminds me of my Dad's favorite fishing statement ""Wind from the East fishing the least Wind from the West fishing the best"""
