6251284,rockape,2018-10-04 08:47:00,215,Clark's boats are awesome. Great price too. We fished 3 out of one for a week and it was perfect.
6251294,lazermule,2018-10-04 09:19:00,86,"Yes, it was coming right down Deception Bay at probably 40-50 mph. The waves were over the dock at the landing. I have been to Sen Bay quite a few times, and I would have made my way up there, but the weather wasn't cooperating so I stayed south of Loon Rapids. LM"
6249026,law57,2018-09-26 06:55:00,1147,"How true... I just figure minnows are part of the trip. I usually just back troll a jig - so minnows last me a long time... Many years ago - more than I care to remember - a friend and I went to Eastern Wisconsin to fish off of one of the nuclear plants on Lake Michigan. Cold, wet, and miserable. The fish wanted smelt - smaller 6 inch smelt. $10/dozen - in the late '70's. So we flipped a coin to see who would go buy smelt. Then we started to catch fish too. The fresh roe in the rainbows, gobbed on a hook, and soaked in cold water to set up worked too. But first you had to catch a rainbow - smelt. Three guys from the Twin Cities were there too. They weren't catching anything. They had spawn bags - but not fresh stuff. I heard one of them mutter: ""It will be a cold day in **** when I pay $10/dozen for midget smelt"". The had driven 300 miles one way. They were staying in a motel someplace and eating in restaurants. But they wouldn't go the extra few feet to complete the trip. Yup - $10/doz was a lot of money back then. It still is today. But as prov1800 says, it's just part of the entire cost. Either you do it or you don't."
6249030,Pooch,2018-09-26 07:02:00,4618,"Even though I'm now past seventy, I still farm which eliminates the spring and fall trips so, no I do not use the boat but for two trips to LS (my boat) and normally one trip to Lake Savant (camp boats). When not working we race several weekends a month all summer. So there is little time left for anything. I've not fished here in Illinois for twenty years. Strip mines, cooling lakes and the Illinois river north of where I live are about the only options, but after fishing Canada the past sixty some trips, it is hard to fish anywhere else.And yes, we have had this conversation with my buddies I fish with who also have their own boats that we are fools for owning a boat, but like others we like to fish out of our own boats that are set up how we like them.I'm going to follow the lead of the guys in the Boat Insurance forum and shop some of their suggestions or just carry liability. Homeowners? Not sure. I insure everything with Country Financial, but their watercraft rates are stupid expensive.Thanks for the suggestions.Pooch"
6249040,rockape,2018-09-26 07:22:00,215,"I got past wanting to own a boat after watching my friends spend a ton of money on them in my early days. I always make sure I am renting a killer skiff with a great depth finder and trolling motor. $1,000 for the week split with 1-2 other guys. Huge deck space and storage too. I pay more to have a great boat with at least a 50 on the back. I also never skimp on minnows. I don't care how much they are as long as the quality is good. I get 7 days in Canada each year, and I'm not going to have a bad trip over an extra $50-$100 bucks. I am also a musky nut. I have spent $30-$60 for those stupid lures! Why would I ***** about minnow cost for walleyes!!!!! Can't wait till next June! And I'm with Pooch. I live in central Indiana, and after Canada, there is no point in fishing here. There are some good lakes in Northern Indiana and Michigan, but nothing worthwhile here. I don't waste my time."
6249042,martinbns,2018-09-26 07:23:00,1520,Agreed
6249046,martinbns,2018-09-26 07:29:00,1520,"Too funny and true. I used to hunt with guys that insisted on cheaping out on bullets. They both liked cheap sierra bullets which worked fine on deer, but not so much on moose. In the years we moose hunted they both literally peppered the hide of moose with 140 gr sierra boattails from their matching Savage rifles because they were great off the bench. I tended to be the tracker in that group and I did a lot of work trying to find game they injured until I stopped hunting with them. The whole hunt or trip is the cost, cheaping out on one small part to save a couple of bucks is silly. Coming to Canada to fish for walleye and cheaping out on minnows is like shooting yourself in the foot with a sierra."
6249214,David Anderson,2018-09-26 16:28:00,2073,"I would say you are about right, 3 - 5 inches. We get a lot of what I would call small suckers in that group which make up the majority of the larger minnows and the larger Rainbow's run in that 3 - 3.5 range. I insist on getting 4 dozen or so because the minnows at camp range from 2.5 to 3.5 and are mediums. To be quite honest it doesn't seem to make much difference if the minnows are 2.5 or 5 inches, in fact I am often surprised how small of a walleye will hit a larger sucker minnow. Maybe it's just in my head, bigger baits/bigger fish but I'm not reeling in 24 inch plus fish all day, I've caught a 8 inch walleye on a 3 inch minnow. I know I switch to plastic when the bite gets hot and will catch more than than the other guys in the boat, until it slows down a bit,"
6249294,martinbns,2018-09-26 20:31:00,1520,"My last day out there were a couple of 5"" sucker minnows mixed into our mediums and truthfully, neither of them caught us a fish when the 3-4"" were deadly."
6250926,lazermule,2018-10-03 06:43:00,86,"Yes, I'm all ears as well. Paid $6.30 CAN / DZ for minnowsJust returned 10/1 from LS. We were there 9/27 through 10/1 and we had snow on LS every day. 10/28 was the best day and was mediocre at best and it went downhill from there. Got blown off Deception Bay 9/30, Probably won't go that late in the year again.LM"
6250940,lazermule,2018-10-03 07:03:00,86,"Correction to the above, 9/28 was our best day. Wont let me edit for some reason."
6251282,David Anderson,2018-10-04 08:38:00,2073,"Wow, you must have had a perfect east or west wind as we launch there on our way to Chamberlain and I have never seen it even remotely bad. Interesting as I have never fished the east side however I have a friend that does pretty well in the fall in Sen Bay, just north of Deception"
6247736,martinbns,2018-09-22 10:19:00,1520,"I suspect in through the mouth, out through the gill then back through the body. They stay on pretty well, often can catch a couple off each minnow."
6247798,Obabikon,2018-09-22 14:40:00,2370,Minnows are expensive... but I just want to say that I don't know any bait dealers driving an Escalade. If your goal is to maximize your fishing trip by catching the most fish possible... buy minnows. If your goal is to make your fishing trip as affordable as possible... buy a flat of worms before you cross. Nothing wrong with either goal.
6247896,David Anderson,2018-09-22 23:44:00,2073,Exactly! best way to maximize your bait!!!
6248154,Guest,2018-09-23 19:20:00,0,"usually just buy our bait at camp and never from bait shop curious what the average sizes are for minnows? Are the ""large"" minnows around 3-5"" roughly. Seem like over years at camp the minnows are getting smaller and would prefer to use larger minnows so am looking at buying a bunch at a bait shop if they are worth it in size. Minnowman"
6248232,prov1800,2018-09-24 06:29:00,5010,I always get a kick out of guys trying to cheap out on the most important part of a fishing trip.so iam thinking 2 guys in a boat.10 doz minnows at 5.00 bucks per dozen@ 6 days.300 bucks divided by 2=150.00 each for some cheap fun.i see guys ripping around in huge engines aimlessly looking for fishing holes 20-30 mi from camp. Not giving cr*p about fuel.that kills me.and they worry about minnow prices.haha.give me a break fellows.most camps give each guy a couple of dozen in the pkg and Clarke's camps on cedar doesn't charge for minnows at all.
6248970,Pooch,2018-09-25 20:30:00,4618,"prov1800 has a point. But... most of us have to watch our expenses to keep these trips as affordable as possible. Otherwise the trip doesn't happen. Bait expense isn't the only thing that factors into whether some folks go or not go. Fuel is huge anymore. Lodging is right up there also.Everyone loves fresh lively minnows, but if a salted much less expensive minnow catches fish sometimes less, sometimes the same and sometimes more than a live minnow then it does matter for most of us if we can keep our trip expenses in line.Speaking of expenses, boat insurance! I'm shopping. My last insurance statement was $406 a year on a twenty thousand dollar boat. For me only getting to make two trips to Canada a year with the boat that is over two hundred dollars per trip just for boat insurance. That is not anywhere affordable to most folks. I'll probably go to liability only. One can be insurance poor and have to consider self insure some of the low risk items.So it's not just minnow prices, it is a lot of things that add to the total. Each expense needs to fit and be appropriate.Pooch"
6248972,martinbns,2018-09-25 20:32:00,1520,$406/2 trips = $203 Does that mean you never use the boat at home all year? If so I would use camp boats.
6249006,Obabikon,2018-09-26 05:01:00,2370,"I would only have liability, but isn't your boat itself covered on your home owner's insurance?"
6249012,Shellback,2018-09-26 05:20:00,8083,"Pooch, Have you tried Bob at World Wide Marine, a board sponsor? Saved me close to 50%."
6249024,prov1800,2018-09-26 06:51:00,5010,There is always the option of using a camp boat that's included in your package.at Clarke's northern lights besides the free minnows you get a 18 ft Crestline Kodiak with a 50 Yamaha tiller.Great accomadations. Win win situation.no upgrade boat costs there.insurance is something you would need anyways on a personal basis on your own boat and would not be a added cost to any trips.trips are always expensive but out trips south are way more especially when the exchange rates are so high.600-700 a week for a fishing trip with everything included sounds pretty cheap fun filled week to me.
6225966,Pooch,2018-07-25 18:46:00,4618,"Headed back up a a few weeks. Last camp furnished minnows. (Best minnows I've ever had!! Beautiful, large and healthy) Next one does not.I had heard $5 USD a dozen and I thought that was high. I'm liking salted more and more every price increase. And yes, I know that trapping is hard work, but nearly forty three cents apiece for minnows seems high?Pooch"
6226084,martinbns,2018-07-26 05:57:00,1520,"Apparently our very hot summer has sent most minnows deep, thus they have been very difficult to trap. One of the guys from Fort Francis posted on here there were none available a couple of weeks ago. In the overall cost of a trip seems inconsequential to me. They are still the best bait to catch walleye in shield lakes."
6226100,rockape,2018-07-26 07:03:00,215,"From my 16 years of heading to the shield, $5 is very fair and consistent for small to medium sized minnows. I've had to pay close to $7 in years past. I don't remember ever paying less than $5. Ojibway Baits always has great minnows. I was up in mid-June so things could have changed with the heat."
6226142,pjshorthorn,2018-07-26 08:08:00,5654,"Pooch, If I remember correctly, you are familiar with J&D Baits in Sioux Lookout. I have used them many many times and always felt they had very competitive prices regardless of what the retail price was at the time. Just for grins, I went back to my old trip(s) notes and found the following prices that I paid for standard size minnows ( medium size) through J&D. 2002 - $3.50 per dozen. CDN They were called Bernier Baits in 2002. That makes me feel old. 2003 - $3.50 per dozen CDN 2004 - $3.50 per dozen CDN 2005 - $4.00 per dozen CDN I also have some prices from Lac Seul Outposts from 2006 and beyond and those costs were $ 4.00+ CDN as well. That was to be expected as we just bought what we needed each day and let them figure out how to keep them alive!!! I guess, now that I have looked at some of my old receipts, I wouldn't be too adverse to paying $5.00 per dozen today if you can get them at that price. I don't like paying more for anything if I can help it,but as Martin already mentioned, bait is a small cost of the overall trip. I don't think you would be getting horked at $5.00/dz. I actually may have been getting horked at $3.50 CND 14 years ago.....LOL! We have also done the salted minnow route and although reasonable in price, we often found it hard to find decent size minnows from a supplier and , in my opinion, maintenance was just as difficult as keeping minnows alive at times. In any event, have a safe and great trip to a Lac Seul. She is a beauty of a place. PjShorthorn"
6247484,law57,2018-09-21 15:14:00,1147,Pooch - take a trap with you and find some small ponds. Try them out - once you find a producing pond you should have minnows for life with very little work. I have a great minnow pond about 1/2 mile from home. I can catch 10 dozen rainbow shiners in about 5 hours - all thru June. They disappear after that until September - too hot near shore. But I'm sure they could be caught deeper. I just use small dog biscuits from WalMart. I also put a few packing peanuts in the trap as an attractant. The pond water is dark and the packing peanuts seem to help.
6247518,Shellback,2018-09-21 16:54:00,8083,Illegal for a non resident to trap minnows.
6247552,law57,2018-09-21 18:12:00,1147,It's illegal to drink beer in the boat too. I've seen guys use two-wheel trucks to bring beer to their boats. just sayin'...
6247582,David Anderson,2018-09-21 19:48:00,2073,"Just got back from there. Picked up 4 dozen large minnows at Ojibwa Baits at about $5USD/doz. Don't know how much the mediums were. For what it's worth, we hook them ""Canadian"" style and often catch 2 - 4 walleyes per minnow. They were very nice as I like to bring some larger minnows into camp. Problem is anything will hit them. Snow is predicted there tomorrow."
6247678,jimirjr,2018-09-22 07:30:00,1149,"""CANADIAN STYLE"" ?? Plz explain?"
6247690,walleyecheek,2018-09-22 07:53:00,2231,I've also seen guys get a pretty hefty fine for BEER in the boat. Just saying !!!
