555318,Guest,2006-03-10 08:41:00,0,"Tea Tree Oil does nothing but make your eyes water in my experience. Ultrathon is essentially DEET. The only things that have worked for me are 100% DEET, and fairly stout clothing. Normally only have to use the DEET when portaging or hiking. Found nothing that worked for ankle biting flies. Was going to try plastic grocery bags under my socks next year. DEET works on no-seeums, which seem to be drawn by light at night, and seem to go away after lights out. Can also let them (skeeters) bite you, be miserable for a couple days, but then develop a pretty strong tolerance (at least worked this way for me) Learned that the hard way as a kid in the Boundary Waters/Quetico."

We'll see if it makes a difference Does anyone remember the discussion a few months (years?) ago about Geranium oil? There were studies done on it and it was found to be as effective or more effective than DEET. The problem with it was finding a way to get it into a useable form. This research was reliable, it wasn't from some late night info-mercial. Just wondering if anybody knows anymore on this subject?"

Saw a porpane device, I think it was called Skeeter-Vac that some guy from Iowa set up outside his cabin. Drew in every skeeter in camp and must of killed thousands of the little buggers. Could hardly believe this thing works but it did."
555453,Guest,2006-03-19 20:10:00,0,"Deet also will eat away at plastic. Keep it away from the depth finders (especially front lens) and lures. As a substitute to deet products we use a rub made with citronella and use it mainly on necks, ankles and behind (and on) the ears. Most of the northern Canadian tackle shops sell it (Youngs in Wawa, Skinners in Longlac). Only use deet when the bugs are unbearable (it is usually when the fish are biting). Most of the time the bugs on the water are not an issue."

I liberally spray my ball cap, clothes back of my neck behind my ears and ankles but try and avoid my face. Avoid wearing bright or dark cloths as the attract the bugs, light tan, is the colour of choice. I bought one of those screen jackets years ago but have never actually worn it. If you dress right and apply Deep Woods Off or any other brand that has a high level of deet in about every 30 to 40 min you will be okay."

Just don`t grab the grid while its on, it gives a nice zap to the recipient. Some brands are stronger than others with the best giving a pretty good light display at night time. It also works great with the little ankle nippers out on the lake(`lake flies`). DEET works best but like anything else, too much can be harmful.

554877,Pooch,2006-02-23 12:53:00,4619,"Some guys will poke fun at this. Our group got started about fifteen years ago wearing the cheap, light weight black with red toe chore boots called ""Pro-Line"". There are other knock offs out there but this brand has lasted the longest. They are about 15/18 inches tall. They are inexpensive and last years. At home I keep a pair by each back door to run out and get the mail or grab firewood. Living on a farm I use them alot for tile repair and other jobs that I don't want to mud up my work boots on. I even use them for scouting bean fields since bean plants slide around them and my feet don't get tangled up. Honestly, they really don't get hot out fishing! I think the water keeps the bottom of the boat cooler and that keeps the boots from getting hot. Also keeps your feet dry when you need to ""find a place we can pull into"" urge comes along. On those hot flat days when my feet do get warm, I just kick them off and go barefoot (or with socks)in the boat. Yah yah I know..... Pooch"

I put the tape over my socks around the ankles and in to my shoes. Last meal they had on me. Yes some of us fishing geeks wear white socks and tennis shoes and ah oh yea tee shirt and shorts and a dorkie hat of some sort in the boat. Aug is nice and summer wear is the in thing to wear on the water. Funny they don't bother much more than your ankles with white socks. I made a real statement with the duct tape on my ankles, so my wife said."

554719,Guest,2006-02-19 13:58:00,0,Freezing weather will ground the little skeeters. The big ones with multiple engines like the cool weather. If it's calm they're at you. The real big ones we capture and will use for bait later on. Make sure you weigh down pets and small children. Every once in a while they get as big as sparrows. These we'll keep and use for baiting our bear sets.

Anyone have any experience with any of these products? As much as deet seems to be the most common product, I'm not real sure I'm comfortable with smearing a product that will melt plastic all over exposed skin to repell bugs. Thanks for the input so far. Larry"
554751,Guest,2006-02-21 08:56:00,0,Deet won't hurt you....and your only using it for a short period of time....I wouldn't want to bathe in it every day of the year though. I can't remember getting bitten by anything when wearing the ultra-thon.......if you have ever been around black flies you won't worry about things like deet as long as they aren't biting you....they can be brutal.

554645,Guest,2006-02-14 15:29:00,0,"Part of this may depend on how far north you're going, and how late in June. We usually go in early June, in the Red Lake area. You shouldn't have any problems with mosquitos on the water, but they can be terrible on portage trails, docks, and around camp. We also have a lot of no-seeums in June, but only in camp. They will come right through the screens, but spraying them with Off seems to keep them out. The flies aren't bad enough for us that we need to wear boots when the weather's nice. The flies we run into, that everyone calls black flies, are smaller and the bite doesn't seem to hurt, but it leaves a welt that itches for weeks afterwards. Last year we went in July, and the flies were also referred to as blackflies, and they were what we call houseflies, also some were what we call horseflies. Both were impossible to get rid of on the water, even if the wind was howling or you were motoring across the lake, they would get out of the wind in the bottom of the boat and nail your ankles whenever they had a chance. Deep Woods Off would keep them away 10-15 minutes at most, especially right before a rain. Those flies would definitely be enough to wear boots for. Deep Woods Off or Cutters work fine for the mosquitos and the small ""black flies"", if you don't mind the Deet. There are stronger sprays, up to 100% deet, but you need to be really careful to wash your hands before touching your eyes, lips and especially before relieving yourself. Sounds funny, but it isn't. To me it's not worth using. I hope this helps."
554646,jigman 2003,2006-02-14 15:47:00,981,"Yes, the flies that are little ankle biters out on the water are not black flies. I call them lake flies, but that probably isn't accurate either. They look like house flies to me. The real black fly bite leaves a little drop of blood and don't start to itch until the devils are long gone. Horseflies are those great big devils. Anywhere from a 1/2"" to 1"" long. Deerflies are about the same size as a house fly, but they have white markings on their wings. Those are the ones that ""ping"" off the back of your head. I haven't had a real issue with bugs. I've been to Canada in early June, late June, mid-July, late-July and early August. The worst I've ever seen the skeeters was in mid-July. Once you are in the bush, they are bad any of the warmer months. Take some Deep Woods Off or Cutter's with the highest concentration of DEER you can find. Take some coils, take some cigars, and don't sit outside at dusk or dawn and you'll be fine."
554647,MoWalleyeguy,2006-02-14 16:13:00,409,"Its amazing how which lake you are going to can make a difference. I have been on many lakes but my last 5 trips have been to Lake of the Woods up on the north eastern corner and the bugs have not been bad at all. They tell me this area is always ""nice"" when it comes to the black flys and other biters and it has been very pleasant to us. We were up there in July and again in Sept in 05'. A few lakes we have been too slightly east and north, the biters can be almost unbearable when the breeze is light. Listen to your outfitter and make sure you are over prepared rather then under prepared."
554650,Stu,2006-02-14 18:25:00,472,Be carefull w/ the bug spray. That stuff repels fish too. A good pair of wool socks usually keeps the flies off of my ankles. a buddy of mine is in the Army. He said that they used to eat a couple of match heads and the sulfer was released from their pores and kept the skeeters away. I have'nt had the guts to try it yet.
554651,Guest,2006-02-14 18:33:00,0,I always take some lent sheets that you would use in your dryer and it keeps the bugs away.
554654,Guest,2006-02-15 06:50:00,0,"I've used a product called Repel Permanone for years. It is intended to be applied to clothing, not skin. It repels those biting black flies that attack your ankles. It also reples ticks, mosquitos etc. The active ingredient is 0.5% Premethrin. Before a commercial product for humans entered the market I used a product intended for dogs that contained 2% active ingredient. For those that can't tolerate deet or don't like its smell Cutter introduced an new insect reppellent called ""Cutter Advanced"". It contains Picaridin. To me it is practically oderless. Also some dermatologists recommend it for persons whom deet causes flushing. Googling ""picaridin"" will provide info."

Do you use the nets over the hats? Rhino Skin? The outfitter says I won't have much of a problem on the water, but could have a problem on shore. What about repellants? Do they really work? Which ones are best? How about inside the camp? Just mosquito coils or do you use mosquito nets over the beds for added protection? I'm doing a drive in so weight isn't a problem. Any suggestions would be appreciated. I would hate to see a great fishing trip disrupted by being unprepared for the ""Bug Wars"". Thanks Larry"

Both like sunny days and still air. A strong breeze blows them away mostly. Mosquito coils will keep them off you in the cottage, but deet seems like the best repellent. I'm not a deet fan myself, if you just keep moving and don't spend a lot of time outside after dusk you'll be OK. Just start a lawn mower and the black flys and sand knats will flock to you. ;) A headnet works best when they get bad. If you like big black cigars, it's a perfect time to light up.

554642,Bill Krejca,2006-02-14 13:58:00,6107,"Larry, I prefer leather ""work boots"" for my feet, no matter what time of the year. They keep the bugs off the ankles, and keep your feet dry when it rains. Coils are great for inside the cabin. I like to burn them for a short time before going to bed, after all outside trips are finished, so that the skeeter population isn't restocked by hitchickers after the ones inside are killed. I don't like to burn the coils very long, however, as I can't see the stuff that kills bugs as necessarily being good for us humans. Lenght of burning is probably proportionate to the number of air hole in the screens, cabin structure, etc. A good? cigar or aromatic pipe tobacco seems to help keep the buggers away, also, if you can stand smoking them. A litle deet seems to help, too, but I'm not so sure it is good for you, either. Happy swatting,"
