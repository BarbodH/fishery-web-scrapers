Sourdough English Muffin, lightly toasted Butter Blueberry or the Malkin's of your choice Only one can of Raspberry left. A buddy saw a can of Strawberry on my counter and it left with him. I better get back to Canada quick! I can't figure it out, but every time I open a can of Malkins it's like I'm right back at my buddy's cabin on LOTW/Ontario :) Funny how memories work. Todd"
