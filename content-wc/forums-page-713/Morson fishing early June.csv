555155,Guest,2006-03-03 21:05:00,0,"We usually trolled lindy rigs with either nightcrawlers or minnows for the walleye, spinner baits and spoons along the shoreline weeds for northerns. Good Luck, Wingmann"
555171,PJM,2006-03-05 01:05:00,3516,"EJ The fishing depends on the water temp and what you like to fish for. If you are not familiar with the lake hire a guide. A lot of islands and rocks, so get a good map. What are you going to fish for?"
555186,EJ,2006-03-05 11:25:00,619,"Walleyes, maybe some smallmouth if they are about. EJ"
555234,esgrams,2006-03-06 21:47:00,92,"Troll with spinners until you find them, pull out all the aggresive ones then we slow down by either drifting or jigging, have fished alot around Hay Island which if memory serves me correctly is about 7-8 miles north of Morson, but I'm not sure as we come out by way of Nestor Falls"
555236,PJM,2006-03-07 00:19:00,3516,"EJ Your posted this same question on another site and Eastwind replyed back and he knows the the lake, so I value his opinion. It seem like I never fish the same spots in that lake because the weather seem to dictate where you fish. Last June around the 15th we were fishing deep, like 25 feet or deeper because of the water temp. Then what happends is the fish will move on the the rock reef at some time and the feed on crayfish in shallow water. I don't fish for smallmouth but I have caught the off rocky points in shallow water fishing for walleyes. It was like 3 years in a row I caught a smallmouth that was over 20 inches in 25 to 30 feet of water vertical jigging for walleyes and they were bright brown, so you know they were deep. Miles bay, Sabaskong Bay or the Rubber island are all different. Some have mud, rocks or deep water, so you seem to fish them differently. Right out from the resort you are staying is a red bouy S72 or S71, I have always ahd good luck there in June in the moring or evening. Maybe Rockpt will commit on this also, He fished up there alot"
555246,JTCUSTOM,2006-03-07 16:43:00,8,"If your'e mainly looking for walleye look for the shallow sandy bays with new weed growth or boulder will help. My favorite presentation would be pulling spinners and minnows. The area you are staying has many great bays that should be excellent. to the west bells harbor, spilt rock,sandy bay,neongoshing sp? the list goes on. If you go north you have many areas in miles bay. Back to the east don't venture much past little mink or into sunset channel as those areas have too many nets in them. hiring a guide for a day may not be a bad idea It will give you more ideas where to go and a little more confidence when navigating. What ever you do don't just rely on a gps because you will find rock! You should buy a map from the camp and use gps to back your self up. good luck jon t"
555389,Guest,2006-03-14 21:25:00,0,New Moon is a great place. Have the owners give you some pointers. nicest people you'll ever meet and they have been there a lifetime. Use a guide at least one day. Lots of rock trouble if you aren't careful. Good walleys up in Miles that time of year and sandy bays towards Basil. We find big smallies in shallow warm bays and big rock shore lines. Have Fun!
