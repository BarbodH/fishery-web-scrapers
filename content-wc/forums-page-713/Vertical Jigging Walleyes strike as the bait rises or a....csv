555408,Guest,2006-03-15 18:46:00,0,Ok guys now what is your opinion? When vertical jigging for those Lac Seul walleyes say with a jig tipped minnow or crawler do the fish strike as the bait rises or as it decends? I usually feel the fish on as I am lifting the bait and believe the fish strikes at most times as the bait decends.

(If I'am not bottom bouncing) However I have a semi-pro expert fisherman with my party who only fishes with a plain ole lead head jig and a chartuse mister twister. He slowly lowers it to the bottom and then slowly raises it up with is arm three feet then lowers it again. He says the walleye almost aways hits it when it starts to drop.He fishes at home a lot and he has developed a keen sense of touch. He is hard to out fish for any species. He just likes the added competion. Since he does so well with just a mister twister I sometimes wonder..... is all of Berklys smelly baits just to give us something else to buy? Just kidding.
