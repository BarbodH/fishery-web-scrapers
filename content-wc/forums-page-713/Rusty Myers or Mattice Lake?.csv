If anyone has used these outfitters for fly-in's i'd appreciate any input or if you have any suggestions on other fly-in places you've been to i'd be happy to look at those also. Just looking for a great fly-in spot with nice cabins and fishing where you won't see another person for the whole week. Also, any area in ontario or price range would be considered. Since this will be my first fly-in trip i thought i'd ask you guys for your opinion. It's just my wife and I and we're both avid fisherman looking to get away from the tourist areas and crowds. Thanks for your help."

Very friendly AND helpful staff (including Don & Annette, the owners) great facilities, the most enjoyable fishing trip I've been on. The Reservoir is huge, the scenery spectacular, and the fishing was excellent when we were there (early July). Highly recommended."

For numbers of pike I'd rank them: Vick, Pringle, Ogoki. For size of pike I'd rank them Pringle, Ogoki (close second), Vick. Accommodations, service, fishing, etc. all top notch. I've never met or talked to anyone who anything bad to say about MLO. I do not have any experience with Rusty so I cannot comment on them. I can tell you that if you go with MLO you will not be disappointed."

555462,jigman 2003,2006-03-20 11:59:00,981,"Well, now that you bring that up. The reason I went with MLO the first time was because they were one of the very few outfitters who will take a party of two without paying for four. They won't do it to all of their camps, but they will for Ogoki, Vick, Pringle (if you get lucky), and I believe Whitewater. Oh, I have to add this: Didn't realize you wanted a single cabin lake only. With MLO you could do Vick for sure, Pringle if there's an opening they don't fill, and I think one other single cabin lake. Go to www.matticelake.com and look at their website. Email them with your questions and they'll answer them."

I have used them 9 times and can help you with different lakes from personal experience. Cabins good, rates ($$) good, fishing and personal service GREAT. My e-mail is wfsales @ neo.rr.com. Good fishing"
