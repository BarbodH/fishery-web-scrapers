555010,Guest,2006-02-28 19:49:00,0,"NWO, Did I understand it correctly that you caught these fish and let AV get his picture taken with them by you so the photographs could be as pretty as the fish? Just kidding AV, nice fish. I have never caught a Rainbow close to that, but I did catch a 9 lb Brown in Missouri a few years back. Sorry no pics, I got pics but it is to early to send them...NICE BEARD too."

Show me four nice fish you have caught over the years and then we can talk on an even page.http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y58...er/wallygg.jpghttp://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y58...4ever/Eye3.jpghttp://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y58...4ever/Eye2.jpghttp://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y58...4ever/Eye1.jpg We just want to see some proof of your greatness, its not that we don't believe you....er right....!

554982,Guest,2006-02-28 09:03:00,0,Nice fish AV. Did you catch those on Iowa in Bray?
554985,Guest,2006-02-28 09:21:00,0,"One of them yes, the others are from AV's secret spot on Seul!! Never to be shown to the likes of someone who won't identify him/herself!! AV"
554987,Guest,2006-02-28 09:41:00,0,"Secret spots....HA HA...Your good AV, but I have seen you miss a few hook sets....not many just a few. Where is that thing you called a beard?"
554990,Guest,2006-02-28 10:23:00,0,"After all that Oh Yeah . . . they must have yanked the topic. I'm glad we ended it off on a good note, which AV probably doesn't realize, if he didn't check the PC late last night. AV gets off on those pictures daily, particularly at this time of year. Did you get any pics of your 32.5"" from Seul. Am I priviledged enough for you to tell me when you caught it (year)? That's right up there with the biggest I've seen come out of Seul.

554992,Guest,2006-02-28 10:50:00,0,"NWO, Sorry no pictures of my LS Fish. Caught her in June of 1998 in a heavy rain storm that was accompanied by a strong west wind pounding a saddle between two Islands on the main lake North of Altimer Creek entrance. It was one of those days we dream about because during the storm the fish really turned on. We caught many nice fish and I know you have heard it before but the other guy in the boat lost one at the boat that I really think was bigger. It was my fault because I was trying to keep the boat off the rocks and couldnt get to the net. But the eyes on the one he lost looked like a couple of Silver Dollars. By the way tell AV after I turned up the brightness on my computer I could see his beard....let her grow AV"

Actually, what is a skill is picking up the different hues within the fish in the photographs. A great example is that Rainbow, AWESOME colours!! I'm going to test the memory again AV, but I'm going to say that Rainbow was boated the second Saturday of April last year ('05). One thing I do know for sure is that we were out on Superior, much of the bay we were fishing was ice, and even though it was sunny, it was absolutely freezing!! NWO Fishing Bum"
