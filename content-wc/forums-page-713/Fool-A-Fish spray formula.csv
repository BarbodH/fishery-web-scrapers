555365,Guest,2006-03-13 15:11:00,0,Based on the response to this posting. it must be some good stuff. Most likely comes with a bottle designed & worded to catch fishermen.
555367,fishmaster,2006-03-13 16:58:00,209,Yea does not look like too many guys have tried the stuff yet? I put in an order for the 2oz bottles and will give it a shot and will post the end of May on how well it did or did not work. Looks like there are few guys looking to see what it is about but have not tried it.

555386,fishmaster,2006-03-14 16:32:00,209,"Trailerguy Check out the site and see what you think, not sure but it is not really a scent formula so much. Got it in the mail today so will see when we get out in Canada in May.http://www.foolafish.com/ Fool-a-Fish is based on research that shows fish see and are attracted to light in the ultra-violet spectrum, which is invisible to the human eye. Fool-a-Fish is an odorless, colorless compound that causes your bait or lure to shine with reflected ultraviolet light."
555465,Guest,2006-03-20 13:11:00,0,"Just out of curiosity, How do you know if this stuff really works or not? Let me hear somebody's logic. Wouldn't you catch fish without it?"

Fool-a-Fish is an odorless, >colorless compound that causes your bait or lure to shine with >reflected ultraviolet light. Where's the research and results? I didn't see a link to it on their site. Anyone can make that statement, but they don't link the evidence (unless I missed that somehow?). How can anyone PROVE that's what it's actually doing if it's invisible, tasteless and odorless to humans? I think it should be called ""Fool-A-Fisherman"". :popcorn: Juls"
555488,fishmaster,2006-03-21 17:06:00,209,"Don't have any idea if it works or not, as for the proof well all you can do is read about it from all the sites, and we all know most of what we read when it comes to fishing is most likely BS. But hey gotta try it now since I have it now. I am sure now that openwater season is upon us some others will try it before I get the chance, after I try it I will give my honest opinion on it. :rotflmao:"
