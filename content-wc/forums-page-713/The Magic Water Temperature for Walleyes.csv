What temperature does the water achieve to allow the large female walleyes to begin there spawning ritual. What temperature do the first males show up in the spawning area to fertilize. this is also the same time the big females protect their turf and eat anything in their face. The final stage is the big bite of all the little males , what temp. What does the feeding pattern have to do with catching fish during the spawning season. If an area is closed because of spawning fish does it pay to fish the area aroung it . Or is it better to fish an area similar in topography and environment at a completely different site and hope for smaller pods of spawing active walleyes."
