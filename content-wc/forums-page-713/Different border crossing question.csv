555470,Guest,2006-03-20 16:09:00,0,"Thanks for the suggestion, just checked with the insurance today. $250 deductible, $205 to repair. In the end I'm getting it fixed. I'll be driving through Wisconsin from Beloit to Superior, and as Jigman pointed out elsewhere, I'd rather spend the $205 bucks and have one less thing to have to worry about on the road. Hopefully I won't crack the new one while I'm in Ontario, have about 20-30 miles to drive on gravel. Won't have to worry about me tailgaiting on that stretch! Oncoming vehicles could pose a problem though."

The crack is near the top of the windshield and meanders from the driver's side towards the passenger side, so does not impede view of the road/turning etc. It might interfere with spotting aircraft or something like that which I normally don't do when I am driving. Does anyone know what if any vehicle/safety regulations Ontario has concerning this type of automobile condition? I'd rather not get it replaced at this time, but also don't want to have trouble at the border or be in violation of Ontario regulations while I am visiting. Thanks."

555377,grt1,2006-03-14 10:41:00,259,"I've been driving all winter with a crack that I recieved courtesy of road rocks and nothing has been said to me, I don't think this crack in the windshield of your vehicle should be a problem."
555380,Guest,2006-03-14 11:58:00,0,Once you get to the border you will be fine. Gravel roads abound north of the border and windshield cracks are a normal occurence to the local residents and tourists of western Ontario.
555381,jigman 2003,2006-03-14 13:04:00,981,"I interpret the question to be ""...is it legal..."" or ""...could I get in trouble..."". If that is so, here is WI law from the DOT website: May I operate with a cracked windshield? Yes, depending on where the crack is. It cannot be in the critical area (windshield wiper area). Transportation rules 305.32 & 305.34 I understand not wanting any hassles at the border. To me, it would be one less thing to worry about, but that's just me."
555382,Guest,2006-03-14 14:33:00,0,"If they ask at the border, just tell them it happened on the drive up."
555384,Guest,2006-03-14 15:46:00,0,"I took a chunk of wood from the rear dual tires of a log truck a couple of years ago on 11 near Atikokan. Lucky it was only wood, put a baseball size dent in my hood before it hit the windshield. And had a lot of rocks for such a short drive from I Falls. So I would say they get plenty of cracked windshields"
555393,Guest,2006-03-15 09:26:00,0,grt1 Tell Mikey I did good up at the village yesterday. Also he might want to check his shack some *#^hole broke into mine.
555441,Capn Hooker,2006-03-18 19:02:00,333,I had a crack in my windshield from a rock. Called my insurance company (State Farm) and they sent someone out to my house to replace it NO CHARGE TO ME. You might want to see what your insurance agent says.
555455,jigman 2003,2006-03-20 07:53:00,981,"Yes, on my policy a cracked windshield is covered under comprehesive. No deductible, no increase in my rates. They may even recommend fixing it with the injectable stuff rather than replacing it. They could do it while you're at work, come out to go home and it's done. Takes all of an hour"
