The watercraft provided were 14 ft lund boats and 15 HP motors (if I recall correctly). Main problem was keeping the bow oriented when winds where gusting and shifting directions. Numerous times we simply got blown off our spots (not literally, but just capitulated), and at best it is a good way to get worn out in a hurry. I've been trying to think of ways to make this less of a problem, and have also been thinking of ways to reduce boat speed without having to resort to constant backtrolling (we fish a lot of spinner harnesses). I've seen some of the big water guys are using something that looks like two small drift socks arranged below the boat near the bow. The setup appeared a little involved for a camp setting, though. We will have a drift sock with us that we use when deep jigging for lakers. Anyone know of practical ways to stabilize the bow in strong erratic winds, and/or to cut the forward speed of a small outpost-type boat/motor setup? Also would like to emphasize that I am not talking about being on the water during dangerous conditions."

555502,Guest,2006-03-22 13:50:00,0,"Ha, that would be nice, but my camp doesn't have them (not a drive-in). I'll pass on your suggestion though!"
555505,Guest,2006-03-22 16:46:00,0,Use 2 small drift socks or at least 1 to help control the boat and keep front from beating you to death.
555507,Slick Willy,2006-03-22 17:24:00,36,Just drop your anchor down about 6 feet and tie it off - not as good as a sock but a cheap fix.
555515,Dave Q,2006-03-23 08:48:00,1003,does the ancor work??
555522,515,2006-03-23 15:02:00,254,It's a tough issue on a remote lakes but the driftsock is probably one of the best options. Other then that try to spread the weight out in the boat to keep the bow down and out of the wind as much as you can. Good Luck
