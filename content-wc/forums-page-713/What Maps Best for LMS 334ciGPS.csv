555385,voyaguer,2006-03-14 16:08:00,54,Am considering one of these units and fish the English and Winnipeg Rivers among other areas north and east of LOW. Prices seem pretty comparable on the net - didn't see any huge savings one place or the other. WIll convert to portable for fly ins etc. Any advice on the better maps sets that are available for this sonar/gps unit ? Either chips sets or downloadable ? tx in advance
