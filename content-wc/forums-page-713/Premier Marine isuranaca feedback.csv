I have not however had to make a claim Is there a problem with this company in getting settlement? BobH
555437,Guest,2006-03-18 00:17:00,0,I think this is the same company that denied my application for insuring my first boat. They require previous boat onwenership of at least two years before they will consider accepting the application. What kind of BS is that? I grew up around boats and could drive a boat better at age 10 than most adults. I don't have a home policy. I wouldn't want to attach a boat to a home policy anyway. Why would anyone want to risk claims on their home policy by having a boat claim. Even a careful navigator can crack a rock every once in awhile.
