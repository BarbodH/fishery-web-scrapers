1101535,J-Man,2009-04-30 17:37:00,191,Here are a couple more photos from our bay taken at about 6pm this evening. Also a couple of different views of what is happening to the west. It's still hanging tough in the big water. The last photo shows Manitou Island in the background.-- Justin
1101756,J-Man,2009-05-01 12:52:00,191,All clear as far as we can see today. Hanson Bay is open as well. Probably a week before the big stuff to the west loosens up and moves out.
1100127,J-Man,2009-04-25 21:05:00,191,"Hello All,Anyone interested in ice conditions in Morson can check out a couple of photos from our bay taken Sunday afternoon April 25. Some blackness there, but not much out from shore yet. Didn't have a chance to go up and look to the west, but was told it's solid white west of the gap and the ice is just out to the government dock in Hanson Bay.Still thinking it will be a week or more before it clears our bay, but a good combination of sunshine, wind and rain could soften things up sooner. Temps still getting low overnights so progress is slow. I'll be back up to the lake again Tuesday and then Thursday or Friday for the season so I will try to post a few more pics if people are interested."
1100136,rockpt,2009-04-25 22:37:00,589,Most of the lake still covered.http://www.outdoors911.com/reports/a...9&d=1240705585

1100195,J-Man,2009-04-26 09:09:00,191,"Hi Marv,Yup, it's me! Looking forward to meeting you guys in a few weeks. It looks like the resort wintered well and we're looking forward to getting things fired up. Hopefully it's a little more pleasant weather wise this spring than last.I'll do some more photos when I get up there to stay at the end of the week."
1100231,Ia Walihntr,2009-04-26 11:29:00,320,I appreciate the photos. See you in three weeks.
1100449,alanb,2009-04-27 09:58:00,56,"J-Man - Definitely appreciate the photos. We'll be heading out from Morson on the 15th. Checking the sat photo is now a daily routine. My guess was around May 5th for the ice to be out from Morson north through Miles Bay. How is this year running compared to last on ice conditions? I think Obabikon gets up there at the end of this week; so for those of us up for the opener we appreciate the ""on location"" updates on the ice out when you get take a break from opening up your resorts. alanb"
1100470,Obabikon,2009-04-27 11:02:00,2370,Last year it went out like the 8th of May or something around there. It's kind of late... usually ice is out sometime during the last week in April.
1101361,J-Man,2009-04-30 09:46:00,191,"10:45 am - Thursday, April 30, 2009. Ice on our bay at Mylie's is looking pretty weak. A good east wind would probably turn it to slush in a hurry. Foggy today so pictures will have to wait. It looked like the gap at the point going out to the big water was open yesterday. I will try to get up and look out west when the fog clears and see what is going on out there.Things are a bit ahead of last year. Having Miles all clear by May 5 will be a challenge I think. We need some wind to move things around now. I'll get some photos in the next day or two. Sure is hard to get stuff done outside when it's raining. We need some sun please!!-- Justin"
1101497,Obabikon,2009-04-30 15:22:00,2370,"Weather calls for rain and clouds for the next week... Talked to Richard today... he said Hanson was out past the government dock. My car's loaded, and I'm just waiting for word the ice is out.... I'm definately ready to go."
1101521,J-Man,2009-04-30 16:43:00,191,"5:38pm - Thursday, April 30, 2009.Ice is going out of the bay as I type. The wind picked up a bit and is moving things around. There is still a a decent sized sheet in the bay, but it's over on the east shoreline at the moment.The fog has cleared so I will take some photos this evening and try to get a shot of things to the west. Rain will help soften things up and the clouds will keep the overnight temps from going low. The sun would certainly help, but I don't think the forecast will hurt too much.I can see open water all the way to the point towards Hanson Bay and past the first couple of red markers so you can probably start warming up the car, Jared."
