1102427,SoDakMac,2009-05-04 20:57:00,218,Does anyone know if there is a problem with obtaining ultra low sulfur diesel fuel in Canada? I have run my older F250 diesel many miles on Canadian roads but my buddies new F250 requires the ultra low sulfur fuel and I could not really tell him what the availability is in Canada since I really never paid any attention. I assume there is no problem finding it. We head up North the last week of June. Thanks for any info.
