1082646,ILScott,2009-02-21 13:50:00,139,"Just curious who is going to Wabaskang or Wine this year? Where are you staying? What type of fish are you going to target? This is my off year of going. Also, what is the fishing like on the north end of Wabaskang because I usually go to Wine. Thinking about making the portage back up to Wabaskang would this be worth it?Scott"
1083229,Guest,2009-02-24 04:59:00,0,"Scott, Our group will be going to Wabaskang for our 15th year. We stay at Peffley's (formerly Lundy's) on the north end of the lake away from the other resorts. Nice clean place, rates comparable to a drive to camp but more secluded and great owners. We are primarily walleye and northern fishermen and have always done very well on Wabaskang for both. However, we also take a little time out of our trip to smallmouth fish (which has become increasingly fantastic) every year, and also to limit out on those big perch in Wabaskang. We almost always take one day of our trip to portage down to Wine. We have never done that trip because we ""need"" to catch fish. We have always caught plenty of fish on Wabaskang. But the portage to Wine is a nice scenic trip, a cool adventure and does offer some more water to fish and explore. We are primarily C & R guys so fishing Wine doesn't bother us in that regard."
1083292,Guest,2009-02-24 09:40:00,0,"Scptt, I'll definately be making the trip up to Wabaskang again this year. My first trip is June 6th for a week, with 5 other weeks throughout the summer also planned. Obviously I cannont wait until then. I could fish Wabaskang all summer and not get bored because the fishing changes drastically throughout the season. The walleyes start shallow and progress out to of the weeds in late July and August and are working the reefs. The smallmouth are shallow in June along the shorelines and then in July/Aug you find them on islands, reefs, and even weed edges. Fially the northen fishing starts to get really good towards late June and stays good all summer through September. I would agree with ScottIL that a trip to Wine would be a blast, but not necessary to catch fish because the fishing on Wabaskang has gotten better every year IMO. Watch for my reports this summer, hopefully I""ll be able to give them from the resort again this year as long as the wireless keeps working. Mike"

1085703,Guest,2009-03-05 18:40:00,0,We'll be up in late July to fish the Wabaskang for a week. Will be staying at Sleepy Dog with our good friend Tom Williams. We have always had real good luck at the north end of the lake.
1094875,warrior2090,2009-04-07 09:21:00,12,I have two groups going up to Pefflys. The first trip is May 15th and then again September 12th. Hope the ice goes out a little sooner than it did last year. We had to bust ice a couple of times to get into camp the first day. Can't wait!
1094924,teddi,2009-04-07 11:20:00,349,if your going may 15 bring an ice auger. the ice is going to be late this year. was out last week and had 41 inches of ice on mcleod bay
1102210,Kevin R,2009-05-04 07:00:00,305,"For an adventure it would work. I think the fishing would be better in Wine though. I started fishing Wabaskang in 1970 at that time the fishing was great fish anywhere & catch large pike they hit just about anything, but Wine was way better larger average size & more action. I may rent a small boat this season for an adventure to Wine. When people fished Wine through the 70's & 80's the Walleyes were much larger average size. The biggest change in all the area lakes I see is small Northerns & Walleyes are less common. In 2008 I caught very few Northern less than 26"" & few Walleyes under 16"". The change in size limits is working 25""-26"" Walleyes are easy to catch same goes for 40"" Northern, they were caught in the early 70's but not that often like these days."
