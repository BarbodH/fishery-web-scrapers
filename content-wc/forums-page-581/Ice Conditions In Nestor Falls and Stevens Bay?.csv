1100233,JVC,2009-04-26 11:51:00,21,"Anyone had a recent look at the ice/open water situation below the bridge in Nestor Falls, or in Stevens Bay? I assume Stevens Bay opens some time before the main lake areas, whether it be Miles Bay, or Whitefish Bay. Question is, how much earlier is Stevens navigable? Want to put a canoe in on Stevens on the 2nd or 3rd, and paddle west to Turtle Lake, and into Whitefish. Might have to camp a day or two around the portage or rails before Whitefish is open, but the alternative is waiting until the next weekend, which is just a pain, what with the great forecast for the week of the 3rd to 10th. Hope I do not have to camp somewhere in Stevens! Thanks!"
1100280,Bill Krejca,2009-04-26 15:30:00,6107,"JVC, I believe unless the policy has changed, or you are a resident, that you cannot camp in Whitefish. Bill Krejca"
1100293,teddi,2009-04-26 16:31:00,349,"the policy hasn,t changed"
1101220,JVC,2009-04-29 20:19:00,21,Residency is not an issue. That`s why my taxes are so high!
1101266,Hawker,2009-04-30 05:12:00,3967,"Ice still isn't out in Stevens Bay. The ice went out day before yesterday in the very east end but still ice from YWC island on out to Hay Island. Might be gone in the next few days, depending, but it's not all soft water yet."
1101368,Bill Krejca,2009-04-30 10:01:00,6107,Have fun! Bill Krejca
1101390,JVC,2009-04-30 11:08:00,21,"Thanks Bill. For you and Hawker (or others): I`ve never been down the road to Stevens Bay before; what signs are there, or road # indicators, or whatever. Looks like a few trails or tracks on the topo maps, and would like not to get on the wrong one! Thank!"
1101458,Bill Krejca,2009-04-30 13:46:00,6107,"Re: road - It depends on where you are going to put in. The road I use goes to a landing for Young's Wilderness Camp, where I have been staying in Sep. for some years. That road is across from Black Bear Camp (I think it is still called that). There is a house and garage on the left side of the hignway,and the access road goes between. There is also a Young's sign with an arrow, which you can see from the highway. Several other camps use the road, with different turnoffs, and there are a few private cabins at the end. Another road and landing, which is used by other camps is just down the highway a short distance. There also is a native access farther north. These are the ones of which I'm aware. Since the roads are not public landings, so to speak, you'll want to check out the access acceptability. The folks up there can get a little up$et when a car is parked on their lot without their approval. Young's phone no. is (807) 226-1206. Bill Krejca"

Lake of the Woods is moving out pretty good now, at least as far as we can see. Some light ice just lying there. South Narrow looks pretty well open and Crow is turning dark."""
