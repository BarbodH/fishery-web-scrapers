1097675,thunderatwork,2009-04-16 12:22:00,79,"bai t is always an issue for our fly-in group, by the third or fourth day the minnows are going belly up faster than we can use them. leeches in the first part of august are hard to find. Gulp works only sometimes. we have heard of salting minnows for and keeping them fresh that way. how does one do that? thanks"
1097683,Golden Eagle,2009-04-16 12:53:00,2642,"I recently bought 3 pounds of large tuffy minnows. Drained them.Placed them in a bucket of coarse salt, borax and garlic powder (4-1 salt over borax and just a bit of garlic powder for a little stink)Let them sit in the mixture overnight.Put them out to dry in the sun. Separate them so they dry out.Bag them about 5 dozen to a plastic bag. Bag with a zipper is best. Keep them in the freezer until you're ready to test them on fish. They make a difference when a cold snap makes catching walleyes on plain jig and grub a little hard. Those 3 pounds will give me about 3 or 4 weeks of catching this season.You'll probably come up with better suggestions on salting them and I'll be looking."
1097701,Jimmy Jig,2009-04-16 14:13:00,1905,"I use canning salt and borax, about 4 -1 also. But, I do the salt mix in pail twice. They don't seem to be dry enough the first time. I do them about a few days before leaving and I bag them 2 dozen to a zip lock bag and do not freeze them. I keep them in the frig, not the freezer."
1097713,campchick,2009-04-16 14:47:00,96,"I don't think salted minnows are worth bringing at all. I own a camp and sure dispose of a pile of them over the summer. People leave them for me with the statement ""See if these work for someone else - they didn't work worth a darn for us."""
1097728,Golden Eagle,2009-04-16 15:58:00,2642,"JimmyJig, I put mine out in the sun to dry. Hardware cloth nailed to a square made of 2' X 4's. Towel on top of the hardware cloth and the minnows on the towel. They work great for me, but mostly I use a jig and powergrub. We don't take any live bait. Going where the fish are is most important of all.Will be out of my driveway early on May 13. Going fishing. We'll catch a ton of walleyes. The first 4 days. More if we don't spend too much time fishing pike."
1097821,Whopper,2009-04-17 04:35:00,340,Golden Eagle you told me 6 to 1 LOL The garlic (fresh) is going in the sauce. See you on the 15th
1097875,Golden Eagle,2009-04-17 09:17:00,2642,"Whopper, it's all part of hope and change."
1098113,drlee,2009-04-18 17:44:00,409,"I purchase salted minnows at a bait shop in Fond du Lac, WI for approx. $1 per dozen. I have fished with them on fly-in, drive-in, and boat-in camps in Ontario over a 15 year period and would challenge anyone to fish along side of me with live minnows and be able to tell any difference in catch rates. I use 1/4 and 3/8 oz. jigs or little joe spinners rigs with chain/bead trolling sinkers. If I have trouble with the walleye bite with my minnows, I simply switch to a 1/2 night crawler. I have used the same ""batch"" of salted minnows for a full month by freezing them, then keeping them in plastic coffee cans in the refrig. I give my leftovers to the camp owners/guides at the end of the week and they are grateful to get them. I use barbless hooks; I keep the minnows right next to me in my fishing boat all day, even in the hottest weather...add a couple of ice cubes if you must. Or, cover with a wet, white boat towel. Frankly, I don't even mind paying the price difference for live minnows, but the convenience of salted bait is just too much for me to resist! ""You don't fish? Then you are not worth talking to."""
1100939,Guest,2009-04-28 21:20:00,0,"I think they are well worth the time. I let them sit out just long enough to slime up, towel them off and let them sit in a bunch of table salt for a few hours. Then I pop them in the freezer untill its time to go up. I have even used them a year later. One year we caught walleys with salties still in their mouths from being caught before. Some years they kick live minnows butts, the next not even close. For a fly in I wouldn't be with out. John B.O.A.T"
1101023,Mike Kansas,2009-04-29 09:01:00,1463,Have taken Salted minnows on fly ins in the past and have had fair luck. Have had great luck with a flat of crawlers from cabelas...easy to take care of and keep fresh and the eyes love them.
