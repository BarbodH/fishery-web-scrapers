1102353,5richards,2009-05-04 16:03:00,131,All comments are good -- You can't miss with the various spoons in all sizes -- we found that the 3/4 ounce as opposed to the larger spoons worked better even on the 40 inch plus pike. Make sure you have several sizes. Don't forget to have weedless spoons. As far as leaders I find that if you make your own out of heavy duty fluorocarbon line [60-80 lb. test] that it performs much better than the steel leaders. We make them @12 - 18 inches long. We had no bite offs. We used power pro line and it was great! Have fun!
1102398,pikepaul,2009-05-04 19:04:00,16,Power-Pro and semko are the way to go.
1102171,elway12,2009-05-03 21:46:00,335,"Will be travelling to Canada this July and would like some suggestions on targeting northerns. I am trying to fill my tackle box up with more than just silver spoons and dare devils Any tackle and or patters you could recommend would be great. The lake I will be going to has plenty of structure, weed beds and is fairly large. Has mainly northern, walleye and lakers."
1102172,skindzier,2009-05-03 21:51:00,137,"Mepps Musky Killers and any other assorted bucktail type spinners. Big bass-style tandem spinners are good too (and are semi-weedless). Speaking of weedless, make sure some of those silver spoons are Johnson's silver minnows and get some red pork rind for them too. That said, by July the bigger northerns will probably not be hanging in the weeds much any more. You'll want to target more steep dropoffs around reefs and the like. Maybe even try some deep running crank baits over deeper water."
1102188,bellbuoy,2009-05-04 05:04:00,490,"Trolling #13 Black over white Husky Jerks. LOTW Northerns love them. Also a Glass Shad Rap in perch, never got to see how big that one was, though."
1102197,Hawker,2009-05-04 05:38:00,3967,"Very good suggestions so far and a couple of more for you. Trolling or casting ""clown"" Husky Jerks is a great option, and trolling or casting Red Crawfish Rattle Traps in 1/2 or 3/4 oz is something they like very well. Don't forget to take along so good topwater ""chugging"" type baits as well. My personal favorite is a frog pattern large Chug-Bug for an evening bite which produces some of the most explosive strikes I've ever encountered. I also throw a lot of the Silver Minnows but I've found that the Gold produces better for me than the Silver so ya might take a few of those along too. If you load up on everything listed so far, you should have a ball!!"
1102239,Guest,2009-05-04 08:43:00,0,"I've had good luck the last couple of years using Chatter Shads. I've discovered that I can bend the blade a little bit to adjust the depth of the lure. I've also tried using the standard chatter baits and chatter frogs, but so far I haven't caught any lunkers on any chatters except the Chatter Shads. You're not going to wrong with any of the other suggestions mentioned earlier, though. Husky Jerks, Shad Raps, and Rattle Traps are always good baits for Northerns. We always go the first week of June now, but we used to go in July. We had the best luck in July for Northerns when we actively searched out cold water. This usually meant looking for steep drop-offs and cold water streams entering the lake. When we were fishing the stream inlets we generally noticed that when the walleye quit biting the pike would start. So, we would switch rods and start throwing for pike. Good Luck!"
1102251,Babamel2,2009-05-04 09:27:00,414,Pike have sharp teeth. pack steel or titanium leaders.
1102271,elway12,2009-05-04 10:27:00,335,Thanks for all the tips. I am getting a list together to take to the tackle shop!
1102288,Stauff,2009-05-04 11:49:00,110,"We use to go up during the middle of July, and our most succesful tactic for larger pike came by taking the lazy approach. Larger chrome/black and chrome/blue BASS crankbaits (3"" cheapies and Big O) in a lazy trolling pattern in the evenings always produced the largest fish for us. It was a relaxing evening watching the sun go down until someone would yell, ""I'm hung up"" only to find that he's hung on a twenty pound pike! Enjoy the trip and don't try to make it too difficult. That's too much like work."
1102328,fisher_i_am,2009-05-04 14:37:00,498,"Fish weeds with spoons, can't go wrong. 5 of diamonds 3/4"" or 1oz and 1-1/8 oz silver minnows with trailer. Fish near any creek that feeds into the lake with above Fish wind blown rocky points with above and/or large ratle traps (trebles suck) Troll mid-lake humps(15-25') or around islands, trolling bagley bang-o-b's 8"" and little ernies"
1102329,fisher_i_am,2009-05-04 14:40:00,498,"sorry, large spinner baits = musky size spinner baits ... black and orange or brown and copper"
