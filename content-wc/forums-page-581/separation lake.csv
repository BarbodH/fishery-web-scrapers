1101894,thunderatwork,2009-05-02 07:18:00,79,"take twice as many jigs as you think, one tenth as many lures as you think, leave the bass lures home, take a couple of five of diamond 3/4 oz spoons for pike. green 1/4 and 3/8 oz jigs maybe some other colors as well. never been to separation, however have been just up stream on lount in july and sept. good portable deptfinder is good, minnows/leeches or half nightcrawlers all work. if separation is like lount it will be too rocky to use the spinner harnesses or do much trolling. Gulp has worked well for us one year and total blank the next. don't know why. find rocky bottom near moving water probaly 16 to 25 ft deep and you should be in fish. generally the faster the current the shallower the fish, but don't waste your time in real fast current(snags). I know people on this site have been to separation Have fun."
