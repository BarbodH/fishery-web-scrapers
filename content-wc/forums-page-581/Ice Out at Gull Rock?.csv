1099991,tackleman,2009-04-25 09:19:00,444,"I'm not sure how thick it is, but Bug River is open under the bridge and a little where the creek comes into it. The lake is still covered and the guys in Red Lake told me yesterday there is still 25 inches of ice on it.In front of my place I have some open water where my neighbour plowed a road for his ice shack but I'm not sure if it is just water that has accumulated as the snow melted, I'm not brave enough to go and check it out.When I was at my dock yesterday it appeared that the ice on the shore had dropped and cracked so hopefully if we get some rain it will aid in the melting process."

1100149,Tonyo,2009-04-26 05:47:00,212,"Moondog, You will have to keep us posted when you get there and back. Our group will be in to Five Lakes the week after. Can't wait. We go every year but I still am as excited this year as our first trip over 10 years ago. Gullrock is a great lake. Takleman, keep us posted on the ice. It is a way for me to pass the time until we leave. Thanks, TonyO"
1100497,Five Lakes Lodge,2009-04-27 12:31:00,4,"Just thought I would give a quick update on the lake conditions here. There's not much snow left but the lakes are still ice covered; however the ice lifted more than a week ago and it's starting to open up around shore. The last report I got a couple of days ago said there was still over 20 inches of ice but it's quite slushy on top and it's starting to honeycomb. Forecasted temperatures over the next week are from 48° to 55°F but it's still getting down close to freezing over night. It's really too early to call for the opener but I'm still hopeful the ice will be out. It looks like water conditions will be similar to last year with the late start to the season (cooler temperatures, late walleye spawn, etc.). Hope this helps.Everett"
