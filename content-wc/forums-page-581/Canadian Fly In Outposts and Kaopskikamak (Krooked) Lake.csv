1101565,GNO,2009-04-30 19:09:00,153,"Real good sized stained water lake. Lots of islands and bays, 3 cabins on the lake, 2 owned by Canadian Fly ins and Tinkers Places owns one. Excellent lake trout, good walleye, and I guess the smallmouth have recently taken off in the lake. What time of year are you looking at going?"
1101574,pegasis0066,2009-04-30 19:18:00,64,"Huh, thought the outfitter had the only cabin on the lake?We are either going in in mid June or early July. We are really interested in big pike - does the lake have pike, and big pike (greater than 36 inches)? By the way, how do you catch lake trout? Never fished for them.ThanksRob"
1101582,GNO,2009-04-30 19:40:00,153,"There are some good pike in the lake. If you are targeting them you should do pretty well. The opportunity to catch pike around 40"" is definately there, but you will have to put in your time. Jaigh will point you in the right direction on where to fish for them. The lake trout will be don at that time. Either vertical jigging or dipsy divers will be your best bet if you want to fish for the lakers. They will be from 40-100' deep at that time of year. There are 3 cabins on the lake, the lake is located East of the 502 hwy between Dryden and Fort Frances."
