1102743,Jesse-WI,2009-05-05 21:01:00,534,You can bring as much as you want and they will charge you duty on any amount they decide is above reasonable capacity for the vehicles you are crossing with at the time. If you have just a vehicle that is one full tank. If you have a vehicle and boat then both can have full tanks. You can usually also argue that one additional small tank per boat engine is acceptable as a backup tank. After that you are blowing smoke and everyone knows it. Every resort I have stayed at prohibits almost any extra gas not directly left in the boat at all times.
1102894,Guest,2009-05-06 10:39:00,0,I shudder at the thought of 55 gallons of fuel igniting in an accident. I feel it is not responsible. There must be rules for safe transporting of drums of fuel. I know the tanks in back of vehicles going to the bush are all secured vented and grounded. Doesn't sound right that you can transport a large volume of fuel like that without approipriate safety measures in place.
1103053,walleyestalker,2009-05-06 22:25:00,9,"Im not complaining about the price. The post was about bringing extra gas, If you can do it. Do it. We catch more walleye in one day than most people do in there life. Ill stay right where i am"
1102053,voyager1,2009-05-03 08:11:00,32,Can anyone tell me how much extra gas you can bring with you into Ontario? I thought I heard that you can bring up to (2) two 6 gallon cans/tanks without having to pay duty. Thanks.
1102062,walleyes4u,2009-05-03 09:08:00,12,"I take at least 2 trips per year to Canada. I believe a lot of those decisions are up to the discretion of the border guard. Some will let you take anything you intend to consume on your trip. I usually take a 55 gallon drum full of gasoline and have been charged duty (which is the Federal Sales Tax of about 8%) only once. Many years ago, they were quite anal on gasoline crossing the border. Where will you be crossing the border at? We cross at the Pigeon River crossing in Minnesota. They used to also be anal on potatoes but I have not been asked the ""potato"" question for some time. The cost of the ""duty"" is no big deal. I always declare what I have. I know guys who try to hide things to save a few bucks and that is not a good thing. Even if you pay duty on gasoline, it is still a lot cheaper than Canadian gasoline. If you are staying at a resort, they may object to bringing gasoline as they may need the income from gasoline sales to operate. I am sure others will give you good feedback on this question. Remember, a bad day of fishing is better than a good day at work."
1102076,JayM5209,2009-05-03 11:00:00,1050,"If you're staying at a camp/resort, I'd check with the owners before bringing extra gas. I know some have insurance coverage that severely limits the amount of fuel that can be stored on site. Personally,I wouldn't want to contribute to the camp owner's liability risk and potential losses by bringing more fuel into camp than my boat's tank holds.Last summer I spent a week at a camp that had several groups of pro anglers in residence for a tourney on the local lake. I've never seen so many 5 gal. gas cans in my life!! Everyone was careful about stacking them away from cabins, etc., but I thought more than once about the fireworks display that could have happened had there been an accident or second of carelessness. Not worth the risk IMHO."
1102110,v-bay gord,2009-05-03 16:55:00,3168,"I think a couple extra cans is reasonable and poses no risk. A fifty five gallon drum of gas? That's crazy in my opinion. I think many camp owners would have serious concerns about that being parked anywhere near their establishment. Maybe you are at an isolated location, and not at a resort. It is still pretty crazy considering the aftermath of any highway accident or other mishap you might encounter. Some may even say irresponsible....."
1102204,Guest,2009-05-04 05:57:00,0,"Let me get this right. You are hauling 55 gallons of fuel to go on a holiday to save what maybe a $100. I don't like the word anal as well. Anal are US cutoms stopping me at the border coming back to Canada and asking me what I was doing in the States. I asked how is that any of your business? The told me I was in a ""protected area"" at the border and they could have searched me as well even though I was leaving."
1102215,stumcfar,2009-05-04 07:36:00,451,"I think it depends alot on the mood the border agents are in. We have actually been charged duty on one trip in which we had two, 6 gallon tanks in the boat. We were told one tank per motor. Since the boat only had one motor, then only one tank. That was extreme, but it happened!"
1102222,hawg,2009-05-04 07:46:00,2008,True definition of a Pork and Beaner.
1102444,walleyestalker,2009-05-04 23:29:00,9,"55 gallons is alot however the outpost we stay at charges over 9 dollars a gallon, so its more than just a little thing"
1102691,Bigfishhunter,2009-05-05 18:23:00,803,"9$ a gallon? Find a new place to go! Somewhere that cares about their clients. There are a lot of places that will charge a full package price which will include a fair amount of gas. Good outfitters do not dime and nickel their clients just cause they have no where else to go. That will not promote people to come back, and outfitters need repeat business!"
1102704,Golden Eagle,2009-05-05 18:51:00,2642,I believe it cost around $10 a gallon to get gas to some outposts in 2008. Gasoline was expensive and so was the cost to fly it to camp.
