We fished the previous two years on Lac Seul in the Scout Lake area, but we went earlier (June 7th through the 14th). I know conditions are always unpredictable, but does anyone who heads up there at that time have any insight on what we could possibly expect? We'll be bringing two boats, one a deep V Alumnacraft with a 50hp and a 17 foot Triton Semi-V with a 40hp. We're concerned with how the Semi-V will handle the ""big water"" on a windy day.Also, if anyone has any tips or suggestions for good spots in the Ear Falls arm, we would appreciate it."

We used to go in late May / early June. Sweatshirts and windbreakers are usually all that's required in the early mornings. We usually get mostly sunny days with a couple of days of rain and we rarely get chased off the lake by storms (we've just been lucky, knock on wood). The wind does howl sometimes though. I still bring the cold weather gear but it never makes it out of the cabin. I can't really offer any advice on the semi-v boat but my first few years of going to Lac Seul were in a 14 ft Lund with a 15 horse motor. It made for some interesting rides back to camp on the windy days but we always made it back. We were limited to fishing the sheltered bays on the windy days but since it is Lac Seul, there was never a shortage of fish. The area we fish (near vaughan lake) has a spot that is over a mile and half wide and 80' deep so the waves can really roll. Not much info but I hope it helps."
1102877,Guest,2009-05-06 10:02:00,0,"The question of the boat handling the waves cannot really be answered directly. Let me explain why: 1. LS is a huge body of water (as you know) and given that is very broad in some places and relatively shallow, it can really start to churn. If you get a northwest wind that is howling and attempt to cross from the south shore to the north shore, your going to get wet. 2. We fish out of 18' Lunds with a 90 HP Yammie on the back, and they can handle just about anything. More importantly, they are run by very experienced boaters/fisherman, who know how to handle the rigs in just about any weather. However, having said that, in a decade of fishing LS, with great rides and experiencd fishermen, I have sat on Islands twice letting the wind/waves slacking. So what are my two points: (a) while the boat matters, the experience of the person maning the wheel/tiller matters as much. I have watch people take 18 foot lunds designed to handle big wave and do everthing wrong and put themselves in danger. I have watched experienced boaters handle the same waves completely differently and never put water in the boat. Also (b), be smart and know when to leave if the wind begins to blow hard, know when not to go out (or not go far) when the wind/weather is a mess. Know your limits as a boater. If have not run the tiller in 4 foot waves, LS is not the place to try it because if you make a mistake, there are not many people around to spot your problem and offer help. Boating mistakes are almost never due to equipment failure, but rather human error. I once watched a guy in a very nice bass boat run it flat out in very high waves, and he took one wave right over the bow and almost ran the boat completely under because he never backed off the throttle. A better boater would have been watching more closely backed off the thottle before the wave hit and never put more than some spray in the boat. Finally use common sense, there is nothing wrong with sitting on an island for 20 minutes or an hour letting the worst of the storm pass. Heck, makes for a great story for my kids. If we had decided that our manhood was being tested and dumped the boat, how would I feel? Your boats should be fine, if you know how to handle them and you use common sense. IA Walleye"
