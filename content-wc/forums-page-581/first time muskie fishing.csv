1101937,Obabikon,2009-05-02 10:07:00,2370,"I wouldn't even consider trolling that time of year... but to each their own. Load up on bucktails... different colors, sizes, blades, etc... then always have a top water lure ready and an artificial lure ready (anything rubber that resembles something they'd eat) So, three rods... but the major one is the bucktail."
1101977,pegasis0066,2009-05-02 15:32:00,64,Why not troll that time of the year?
1101997,Obabikon,2009-05-02 17:33:00,2370,"Because, that's the time of the year the muskies blow up on it... right next to the boat. You might catch some fish, but why take away the excitement? Also, they're usually closer to the shores that time of the year anyways."
1102101,pegasis0066,2009-05-03 15:28:00,64,"Is that different than pike that time of the year (late June)? I also assumed pike and muskie fished very similar; and, I thought pike in late June were seeking deeper, colder water that time of the year?"
1102108,v-bay gord,2009-05-03 16:44:00,3168,"Drillmesilly........if I was fishing out of that location I might spend some time fishing the larger bays due south......these are Lost Bay, Meridian Bay, Midway Bay, Muskeg Bay and Eldorado Bay. All of them are proven muskie locations, and considering the time of year should have some prime cabbage beds. I would probably cast these areas with bucktails, jerkbaits, surface baits, etc. Trolling can work, especially if you are seeking out other species.....ie. a husky jerk trolled near mudflats, weed beds, points etc might produce some walleye & pike if you are interested in those species........you might also stumble onto a muskie as well, but it would not be my first choice if I was only targeting muskie. Other areas that you might try are the bay that you will be staying in.......it is close and probably overlooked by most anglers. Good luck!"
1102138,joeman79,2009-05-03 18:49:00,417,"Muskies don't go deep like pike in late June. They will be way shallower than the pike in July and August. From what I have read and expierenced. Caught a 50 incher on LOTW in about 6 ft of water, second week in July."
