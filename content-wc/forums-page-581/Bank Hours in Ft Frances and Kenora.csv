We are staying the night at Frances and going onto Kenora on Saturday.Any info would be appreciated, Thanks"

This link may help:http://www.google.com/search?sourcei...+frances+banksAs to why, though it's not necessary, I've found it useful to get some Canadian funds for miscellaneous purchases, say at the Safeway, bait shop, restaurant and motel. We always stop at the duty free shop on the way home where any leftovers are spent or exchanged. I try to limit my use of a credit card as much as I can.Have a great trip!Nimstug"

1102868,Guest,2009-05-06 09:31:00,0,"Why convert?.........in our case it is nice to use the currency the lodge uses, ""Canadian"" or we could use ""US"" and get a ""fair"" exchange, which in Canada over the 30+ years I have traveled there, I have found a fair exchange at a business normally means 3-5% less than what you can exchange at a bank. It all comes down if you think it is worth your time to exchange currency. I think the 10 minute stop is well worth the 100-200 bucks I can save on our trip. (other than last year....with a rate at around $ 0.98, the 10 minutes saved was a great deal...lol) I purchased some money about a month ago when the exchange was just over 25%, that alone has saved nearly 10% from where the rate is today. That's already saved over $250....makes it a better deal when we return on our second trip in Aug. Enjoy each day, but enjoy everyday fishing more!!! Wallace"

When they tell me the price I respond ""So you need a Queen, four Loonies, a bear, bird and two beavers, Does that about cover it?"" The reponces vary and are very entertaining!"
