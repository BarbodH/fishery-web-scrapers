1101213,kcmelty,2009-04-29 20:09:00,7,We have 7 people traveling from Kansas City to Red Lake this June. We are having problems finding a rental van to drive from Winnipeg to Red Lake in. The best the guy in charge of this can do is two mini vans. I don't think 7 guys and all of their gear for a week long trip is going to fit very well even in two mini vans. Does anyone have any suggestions on finding a large passenger van in the Winnipeg area? I have searched the web and no luck. Any help would be appreciated.
1101218,Glenman12,2009-04-29 20:16:00,762,Long day at work and Im a little tired and maybe not following you right...are you guys flying from Kansas City to Winnepeg and then looking to rent vehicles?..
1101219,IMWalleye,2009-04-29 20:17:00,35,"I've done 7 in two mini vans from Winnipeg many times! Including some groceries. Let the camp get some of your stuff ( beer, etc.)."
1101223,kcmelty,2009-04-29 20:21:00,7,"Yes, we fly to Winnipeg and drive to Red Lake."
1101232,Glenman12,2009-04-29 20:53:00,762,Do any of the rental agencies have king cab pickups? that should do it for 7 guys and their gear

1101241,Golden Eagle,2009-04-29 21:27:00,2642,"Several years ago we did the same trip starting out in Nashville, TN, then to Winnipeg. Booked our flights through Karen Veal of Red Lake Travel Service in Red Lake. Best place to get help is to work with people who do business where you're going. She found a 15 passenger van for us at a good price. It's worth a shot. I don't have her toll free number tonight, but could come up with it at work tomorrow if you need it."
1101244,Golden Eagle,2009-04-29 21:36:00,2642,"thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Google.[email protected]800-465-3305Phone: 807-727-2742 Fax: 807-727-3302Hope this gives you what you need. I haven't booked through them in several years, but hope they still have what you want. I've given up on commercial flights, motels and restaurants when heading up north. Driving my van, sleeping on the ground and eating from my ice chest are working for me. I enjoy 2 or 3 or 4 round trips of 3000 miles each year. Good luck fishing."
1101559,kcmelty,2009-04-30 19:01:00,7,We are actually working with Karen but she apparently couldn't come up with a large van this year. I guess when I think about it the mini vans are going to have as much or more room than the float planes that we are going to be on. Thanks for all of the help. If anyone has any tips on fishing Optic lake please let me know.
