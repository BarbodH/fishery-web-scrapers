Anyway they sold us minnows in bulk by the gallon, can anybody tall me the name of the place and if they still are in business. It was next to a small grocery store and a beer store . I am trying to find a place along the way to Minaki that will sell minnows in bulk, more then a couple of dozen. If anybody knows a bait dealer along the hiway that sells in bulk let me knowThanksDano1 month, 1day and 21 hours to go!~"

1100609,fisherman 1,2009-04-27 18:56:00,39,"Here is a little info that I copied from the MNR's Fishing regs website. It might save you a little money if you get stopped with a gallon of minnows. In other words anyone with a licence is only allowed to posess 10 dozen minnows and 10 dozen leaches max. at any time. This is a per licence limit so everyone in your group with a licence is allowed this many baitfish.Good fishin,BAIT LIMIT NOTESBaitfish120Includes those caught and or purchased.
