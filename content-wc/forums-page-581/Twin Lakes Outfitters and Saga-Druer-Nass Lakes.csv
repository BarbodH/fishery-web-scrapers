1101456,pegasis0066,2009-04-30 13:43:00,64,"I found a little a bit of information about this outfitter and lake, but was wondering if anyone might have some more information. Specifically I have these questions: - How is the fishing, especially for decent size Northerns (greater than 30"") - Are nearby lakes Nass and Druers accessible by boat up river? - Any tips on catching walleye and northerns in these lakesThanks"
1101638,pikepaul,2009-05-01 05:51:00,16,I didn't know Bill had any of those lakes now. How recent is your info?
1101644,pegasis0066,2009-05-01 06:18:00,64,I guess he recently purchased the outposts - I have been speaking to him for about a week now. I get the sense from things I have read on this site that Saga is pretty small and shallow. Therefore was wondering if the other lakes were accessible and held better fish.
1101722,pikepaul,2009-05-01 10:19:00,16,I sent you a pm. Take a look. pm me if you want
1102099,pegasis0066,2009-05-03 15:14:00,64,"Huh, it doesn't look that big on my topo map, maybe 1.5 miles square. Also the outfitter told me you couldn't go down river due to the rapids, but he said you could up river, and get to Durer and Nass - is that not true?thanks"
1102201,onetimedave,2009-05-04 05:48:00,502,Twin Lakes Air has been sold to a father & son. They purchased last year and should be in full operations theis year. Previous owner Bill sold a couple of his better camps to www.awonakina.com. Bill has been in the tourist business several different times in Ontario and must have figured it was time to get out again.

1102374,pegasis0066,2009-05-04 17:33:00,64,"Thanks for the video, but what the **** where your friends (the guy videoing and the the guy waving the branch) doing as you pulled the boat up river!If that was me, there would have been some four letter words flying!Thanks again"
1102387,Mike Borger,2009-05-04 18:17:00,1554,"That was my 70 year old dad with bad knees swatting the flys and my 72 year old uncle taking the video.They did their share of the slugging for me over the years, it's my turn now.(And yeah that's the first set of rapids up from the lake, there are several more. None were navigable with the high water we had, all had to be lined)"
1102399,pikepaul,2009-05-04 19:07:00,16,"Good man Solo,All one had to do was listen to the camera operator breathing and that would give a clue that manual labor isn't appropriate."
