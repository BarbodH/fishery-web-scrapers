555752,Guest,2006-03-29 17:07:00,0,Smallies are a real under rated fish in the area. The only time I can say I focuss on them is when I have kids . No better fish in Canada to get kids hooked on fishing
555753,IaCraig,2006-03-29 17:47:00,434,"I pick that time of year because the weather is usually more stable and the walleyes are easier to pattern even if the odds of 30"" fish is less. Yes, I fish all over but most my walleye time is spent on humps around Big Sand or the mouth of rough rock. I like to relax at the end of the day with trolling crankbaits, and for me that picks up in Big Sand around late July. Also, as the weather heats up I think casting for northerns gets better. (and muskys too for that matter). IaCraig"

555784,Guest,2006-03-30 15:14:00,0,There are now stricter daily catch/possession/slot limits on that system now so you can bet the MNR has identified a problem. I personally think the walleye fishing has went steadily downhill over the past 7-8 years (I've been going up there since 1979) at least that is what I've noticed. I think it has a lot to due with the extreme spring high water conditions messing the spawn up for several consecutive years. These past couple of years I've caught some walleye in June that had eggs...which I'm sure would have been absorbed at some point. I could be totally wrong but that's my theory...along with the heavy lodge pressure that was put on that system in the late 90's early 2000's. Not sure if it's just a coincidence or related in any way to my theory above but I've noticed a continuous improvement in the smallmouth and Muskie fishing over that same time period.

555803,Guest,2006-03-31 09:20:00,0,"Arron, Interesting observation about the effects of the higher water on the Winnepeg over the past few years on fishing. I too have had my suspiscions. First of all, my partner and I don't fish walleye enough on the Winnepeg to have noticed the effect on walleye fishing. We fish mainly for smallies and northern, and we fish walleye as a way to take a break from beating the banks. We'll usually only fish for them 2 days a week, the two weeks we're there. We've noticed that weed growth in general has been lighter and not as heavy in many of the bays, along the river, etc. If you look closely at the weeds, they don't appear as green as they used to and in many areas the weeds have a brownish color to them--even the new growth. I suspect the less dense and poorer weed growth has really had an impact on the forage, since we no longer see massive numbers of perch, minnows and even crawfish in many areas that used to be chock full of them. (I can remember countless instances in the mid-90's when the perch and small smallmouth were so thick in many areas, that you had trouble catching anything else on a small mepps spinner--we'd call these areas 'the nursery' and would quickly work thru them when we encountered such. However, we haven't seen that much over the past 6 years or so.) We've also noticed that the smallmouth fishing has improved--not necessarily from a number that you'll catch, but from a size standpoint. We still catch the same numbers, but the smallmouth we've caught over the past few years seem to be bigger, and you don't catch as many smaller ones as you used to -- you get just as many, they are just bigger now. So, what does this mean? I think it means that the smallies population on the system is aging, and am afraid we may be heading for poorer smallie fishing on the Winnepeg in the future, because new year smallies aren't as plentiful as they used to be. (We used to see huge numbers of 'smallmouth balls' as we worked thru an area, but seldom see this anymore.) I'm wondering if most gamefish are gradually shifting their feeding over to smaller gamefish fry, due to the reduction in perch, minnows, etc. I'm also wondering if the smallie spawn has had similiar results that you've noticed about the walleye--since we catch more and more large females that have failed to spawn when we're there in late-June and early-July. Smallmouth live for a long time in the north, but without a good population of new fry, I'm concerned that thier number will rapidly drop off in the coming years, since the number of new ones have decreased dramatically. Yes, I think the new water controls have had a definite impact on that fishery. ...just my opinon. Chuck"
555812,Guest,2006-03-31 11:08:00,0,"Arron, I agree with not catching the perch while walleye fishing, like you used to. We too have recently caught some huge smallmouth, and in greater numbers than ever before than any other time over the past 20+ years. There were many years while smallmouth fishing where we'd have to deliberately pull our mepps, spinnerbaits, etc. away from a chasing small smallmouth, so a bigger one had a chance for it. In fact, we'd call that a 'smallie chaser"" and became a common technique we incorporated into our presentations. However, we haven't really needed to do that much over the past 5 years or so. We also used to look for humps that had deeper suspended (18' or so) smallies near by, although they were usaually smaller 10-15"", they would be there in fairly large numbers and it would keep us from having to walleye fish for a few afternoons :) . We'd cast to them (and count down the lure)with heavily weighted plastic minnows and finesse worms--but we haven't found any of those in the past 5 years either--even in our usual ""go to"" locations. (That was a presentation we could always count on for 15+ years or so, and not many even knew or targeted them this way.) The 'packs' of smaller smallmouth just don't show up on the sonar anymore--sure you see 1'ies or 3'ise on the sonar in a small group, but not the 10 to 30 fish ""packs"" like you used to. Just wondering if you've noticed a reduction in the number of loons on the water? I suspect a lot of nests have been flooded as the water level fluctuates. We'll be there June 22-July 8 this year, staying at Sunset Resort across the river from the ol' Minaki Lodge. We're also planning to go back for another week the last part of Sept. Chuck"

555817,Guest,2006-03-31 12:44:00,0,"chuck...yes, I have noticed a reduction in the number of loons over the past several years (there are still plenty around though), however, they seem to have been replaced by bald eagles. I remember leaving the island last year to come home and counting 8 different mature bald eagles from the island to the boat launch. It's looking like an early ice out this year so I might bump my trip up a week. You ever Portage up into the North Channel off of Roughrock?"

555864,Guest,2006-03-31 13:44:00,0,"Aaron, Been up in the north channel only once, when water was at the max level a few years ago. Getting there wasn't worth the effort in my opinion. We thought it would be a bonanza, given less pressure, rock entry, remoteness, etc. but it wan't as spectacular as we had hoped. We did get a couple of nice musky right off the edge of the eddy, just at the entrance however. Rocks everywhere! We've gone up into the Black Sturgeon river a few times, and fished the lakes above the rapids south of Minaki. You can crank an aluminum boat around the rapids on the wooden portage they have there. Caught some nice smallmouth and largemouth in the lakes. I think we were off the big yellow government map by 10 miles or so. We've also been all the way back to the waterfall on the MacFarlane river several times. The waterfall/rapids comes out of Vermillion Lake and is about a 75' fall to the bottom. (We even walked up to the top.) There were some very nice smallmouth along the way, and an overabundance of hammerhandles too. The biggest smallmouth I ever caught at Minaki was when we went into Abelson Lake. Abelson is bounded by the Winnepeg River on one side and Gunn Lake on the other, about 5 miles south of Minaki. Excellent smallmouth lake that sees little or no pressure. We took a small 10 hp motor with us, because our resort owner had put a small lund there in the spring--it was about a 500 yd hike. It has some northern and walleye, but we didn't even bother with them! Lastly, we've walked into a few of the beaver ponds that eventually find their way into Little Sand and Big Sand. It wasn't really worth the effort, except for one, it had some decent lake trout that were extremely hungry. Yes, I think the eagles are making a comeback in that area, compared to 20 years ago.

555866,Guest,2006-03-31 14:26:00,0,"Chuck...I don't think we are talking about the same ""North Channel"". Maybe I should just keep it a secret...LOL"
555868,Guest,2006-03-31 15:53:00,0,"I thought you were referring to the big bay that leads to Blue Berry Lake. A lot of musky fishermen go in that area, and there are many unmarked rocks????? Chuck"
555871,Guest,2006-03-31 18:30:00,0,"Chuck...nope, I was referring to the North Channel that you have to portage a boat into (very short 10 yards). If you look on a map it's just north of Rough Rock. It's a chain of lakes stretching all the way over to the road that leads to whitedog dam. The first and last lakes in the chain have some monster smallmouth in them. I get in there at least once a year when I'm up."
555876,Guest,2006-03-31 20:48:00,0,"OK, I know where that is, it's on the other side of the bay that leads to Blue Berry. No need to worry, my portaging days are over now that I have fiberglass boats. LOL Chuck"

555938,Guest,2006-04-04 09:18:00,0,"We're in Pistol Lake. I just got back from there with the kids from spring break. It was unreal pike action. With the 8 lines we had in over a 200 yard streach the 4 of us never sat down for long. The average was 3 - 4 pounds , but we had at least 5 a day between 7 - 12 pounds and one that topped the scale at 18.5 pounds. And since I almost only fish walleye I don't own any leaders and all the stores were closed. I had a lot of bite off's and one rod shot out of my chair down the hole like a rocket. For the kids I had six javex bottles with about 50 feet of line with a treble hook and frozen sardine's . Lke I said we caught lots but with the big sardine the pike swim a lot of times 20 feet the drop it. So there was almost always a bottle dragging across the ice Have you ever fished Vermillion ???"

555957,Guest,2006-04-05 15:20:00,0,"After much discussion with our group and after celebrating our 25th anniversary of trips to Minaki last year, we are going to come back again this year. There is no question that the walleye fishing has been dramatically poorer over the last 10 years, but considering the whole experience (and the learning curve of a new lake) we felt it was easier to keep our trip together. You guys have discussed the loons and eagles and high water and I totally agree that something is happening with the system. One thing we have commented on is where have all the beavers gone? They used to be everywhere. I feel habitat change has as much if not more to do with the walleye decline than over harvest of us ""one trip per year guys"". I've got old pictures of the original crew when I was just 16-17 years old with stringers of 4-5 lb walleye and it was an annual deal. I'm 42 now and we (our group) haven't kept a walleye over 18"" or brought home #'s of fish like that for 15-20 years (mainly because us young guys pounded catch and release into the old school guys!). The last outstanding walleye year I can remember was 1995 and coincidently it was the last year I saw a MNR CO (2 very pretty young ladies at that!) It just seems to me that pressure is an issue, but maybe not the main one. I fish Mille Lacs and my son stops counting boats when he gets to 200. Even with all that pressure I still can count on boating and releasing 20-30 walleyes in a morning. If pressure were the main issue then Mille Lacs would be a dead sea instead of a walleye factory. Other than the 12-13 inchers I caught last year, I would have loved to catch that many on Big Sand! 10-15 years ago it wasn't uncommon to boat 50-75 nice walleys in a day. One year we caught 7 over 30"" in my boat and countless in the 23""-27"" range. The joke was could you catch one small enough for shore lunch! Up on Big Sand 20 boats were catching and releasing large #'s of big walleyes. Our group (and I'm assuming the vast majority of anglers) changed our fish killing ways 15-20 years ago. I remember a year when you could only keep one walleye and it had to be whole! I find it hard to believe that over harvest by USA anglers is the main problem. I spend way more time on smallies and toothy critters now then I ever did. It used to be smallies and northern/muskies were fished when the water was flat calm and the walleyes shut off. Now it is because they are sometimes the only fish you can find with any regularity. I don't know what the answer is but hopefully people smarter than me can find a way to return this amazing place to its former walleye greatness. I do know that changing the water level by 4 feet each spring can't be good for spawning walleye!"
555959,Guest,2006-04-05 16:15:00,0,"I can tell you where the beaver's gone. I personally destroy the dam everyday up on the hill behind our place until they move. Our neibour has shot a few. Not that he anything aginst them until they dropped 2 tree's in one week on his new cottage. Last week the dam in the next bay over was destroyed by someone. Beaver's left uncontrolled have taken the main hwy out several times. I think there is hope for walleye's at Minaki. The waleye fishing just about collapsed in Lake Of The Woods. And currently it's a world class fishery. I get there every chance I can. Unfortuently they have opened it up to commercial fishermen , and I don't have the numbers in front of me but the pounds taken I beleive is in the millions yearly ( I'll have to look up those numbers again )"
555988,Guest,2006-04-06 14:22:00,0,"Very good point about the beaver, we've noticed that also. The feeders and isolated bays used to be loaded with them, and it was like a fire in a fireworks factory whenever you trolled into one--tails smacking everywhere. (I'm talking isolated bays were the beaver never really caused any problems for anyone.) I suspect that troublesome beaver have always been fair game with cottage owners, but don't believe it more-so now than it has been in the past. We don't see many new huts being worked on anymore, just decaying remnents of the old ones (which are still good for decent smallie action). I suspect many a new beaver hut built in the fall gets flooded in the spring due to the higher water level. We've also noticed a decrease in other aquatic life--in general, fewer lilly pads, grass mats that aren't as big as they once were, weed growth that hardly makes it to the surface by late summer, etc. I'm not convinced that angling pressure is the cause of declining walleye, for the size of the system at Minaki, it should be a walleye powerhouse, when compared to a lot of other systems that see much-much more pressure. What's the common denomonator in all these observations over the past several years? Chuck"

I want to put in my cents on what I believe is happening The fishing pressure has increased and I believe had some effect on the population of the walleyes but this body of water is huge. I support the change in the limit but........ American's like me who make the trip a couple of times a year and have not kept a walleye over 18"" in the last ten years I do not believe are the problem. Over the years I have come to know many people who have cabins on the lake and have stayed in several of the private fishing camps. Many (but not all) of these people are meat hogs and keep everything that they catch. About 10 years ago I stayed at a private camp and was chewed out for releasing fish after we got our limit. This particular guy I think sells the fish in town. With this said I have not stayed with this guy since. The last several years I have been staying at Paradise in the new cabins WOW these are nice.

555916,Guest,2006-04-03 15:50:00,0,"You guy's make excellent points on the drop of walleye . Now don't get mad at me , but a few years ago while fishing I got to spend some time with a natural resource officer and a student doing a survey. He stated that American fishermen out number resident fishermen 10 - 1 . Which is why I'm sure American's have been singled out for the reduced limits. To me sure that would help some, but there is far greater problems . When was the last time you've seen a CO officer on the water. I'm there every weekend in the summer plus my holiday's . I've only been pulled over once ever and that was coming off the portage in big sand , and I wasn't fishing that day. I also spend a lot of time at the beach in big sand and I alway look for the fish gut pile , and too often I see 3 - 4 pound walleye getting fried for dinner. Now to the cottagers , and this would include me. You add all the weeks in the season, I have the potential to eat a lot of fish. Now include my guest out there. I used to be pretty bad . I've changed a whole lot but I know a lot of land owners out there that if you went home to their freezer and to the freezer at the lake. the game warden would need an extra book. I have noticed a few less loons on the water , but the lower numbers could also be due part of there winter grounds. What ever natural resouces feel is needed it's better then what they did to Shoal lake in Ontario. That lake hasn't had a walleye season , and I'm guessing for about 20 years. It totally failed , and they continue to do nothing. That's my 2 bits"

Smallmouth live for a long time in the north, but without a good population of new fry, I'm concerned that thier number will rapidly drop off in the coming years, since the number of new ones have decreased dramatically. Yes, I think the new water controls have had a definite impact on that fishery. ...just my opinon. Chuck"
555806,Guest,2006-03-31 10:13:00,0,"Chuck, I agree with most of your observations and think that the changes in weed growth as you describe is a result of the spring high water conditions. I've been concerned about the spawn for smallmouth to but honestly haven't noticed a decline in the number of smaller fish or numbers...in fact it seems like we catch more and bigger fish every year. last year (June 13-20) was my best year I've had ever fishing for smallmouth on Big Sand both in numbers of fish (big and small) and size. I've been trying to catch a smallmouth over 23 inches for years up there and did it three times last June with the largest being 24 1/4 inch hog. I have noticed a dramatic decrease in the number of perch that we catch fishing for walleye. When will you be up there this year?"

555420,coop,2006-03-16 12:20:00,7,We'll be there 3rd week in June and 2nd week in July. Group sizes 6-8 each. Never had a bad trip. Last few years been staying at North Star.
555430,Guest,2006-03-17 13:21:00,0,"I'm there so much because my cottage is on Pistol Lake. But I do spend a lot of time in the Vermillion lake area for lakers, I used to trailer the boat to other walleye lakes in the area like Green water, Pelican pouch , up to English river. But Why ? There are slower days for walleye's , but never a bad day. As the price of gas keeps going crazy . I spend half my time fishing Pistol now, The larger ones are not as plentiful as in the river, but lots of 16"" - 24"". Plus it is one body of water that holds plenty of large musky, and pike."
555435,Spike the net man,2006-03-17 22:35:00,18,"My group of 4 will be at Barber's the week of June 24, and my group of 11 will be back at Barber's the week of July 15th. Been going to Minaki for 20+ years, no good reason to stop now. Yea, the walleye fishing can get a little slow at times, but it forces me move around and continue to find spots I have never fished before. The fish are around, don't be a boat chaser, look at the maps and give a few of those spots that look like they might hold fish a try. You may be very suprised when you set the hook."

555709,IaCraig,2006-03-28 12:36:00,434,"We are taking 2 boats up to North Star the end of July. 3 adults and 4 kids. I'm returning because I know the area pretty well and I like our lodge owners. However, I am organizing a ""guys' trip to Lac Suel and maybe somewhere else to get to know other systems in case Minaki doesn't wake by the time my kids get old enough to focus on eyes (1-2 years). IaCraig"

555727,Reels,2006-03-28 21:06:00,2876,We changed now to second and third week of June... <{{}}><
555737,Mille Lacs Guy,2006-03-29 10:19:00,401,Many in our group are not returning. Some are not returning after 10-20 years in a row to Minaki. I think about 8 of the 12 people in our group are not going back this year.
555743,Guest,2006-03-29 13:32:00,0,Don't forget the smallmouth! There are some very nice ones in Pistol. Chuck
555222,Guest,2006-03-06 14:30:00,0,I'll be there June 13

555308,Guest,2006-03-09 15:49:00,0,I'm there every weekend in the summer fishing and every second in the winter fishing.
555314,voyaguer,2006-03-09 21:48:00,54,why ?
555337,Guest,2006-03-11 15:59:00,0,Our group is going to fish the English this year. I love Minaki and will return but we are going to give the fishery a couple of years to recover. Last year was the first year that I have missed in 23 years.
555352,voyaguer,2006-03-12 19:35:00,54,"I have been fishing the English for the past 15 years and thought I'd try the Winnipeg for the first time. Would be curious to share notes. good luck on the English and I would like to know where you go and how the fising was. For me, I'll try Rough Rock this year. I get the impression that there is alot of traffic up there, but we'll see. bite on Phil"
555359,Guest,2006-03-13 09:24:00,0,hardly any traffic on Rough Rock. Take your musky baits.
555364,voyaguer,2006-03-13 14:31:00,54,"Thanks look forward to this experience. Posted something about Rough Rock several weeks ago and one fellow came back with quite a bit of information on the lake, fishing areas, etc. take care Phil"
555374,page,2006-03-14 08:08:00,6,I would like to try fishing somewhere on the English river this July. Do you have any recommendations? Thanks.
555379,voyaguer,2006-03-14 11:10:00,54,"I have fished Separation to Big Fox, and then a few places upstream like Oak etc. The primary camp on Separation (Separation Lake Lodge) is reportedly for sale. I think the current owner intends to keep things going this year. they are situated well for fishing, particularly for a drive in\boat in. Usually good for walleye and northerns, fair for small mouth. They have had housekeeping and american plans. They also run the campground at the primary landing from the road in. It is a bit congested for me, but if you are into camping, the fishing there can be very good. English River is fairly long, coming out of Lac Suel before it dumps into the Winnipeg. Further up stream is Ball Lake, and although I've never fished there, I have heard good things about that area also. Look under Ball Lake. I believe you can drive-boat in there also via Grassy Narrows ? Peronally, I didn't like Oak Lake too well. Umpreyville would be a thought. Halleys Camps have several places there. If I were to go there, i would look first at the Kettle Falls camp so far as fishing areas. I have never stayed at Halleys. Have heard varying reports on the operation there. Alway a good idea to check with the LWCB about the plans for the year, water levels and quality etc. before going. good luck Phil"
555163,Reels,2006-03-04 16:05:00,2876,Just wondering who is going to Minaki this year and how many are not returning? I'll be there 1st week of June. <{{}}><

555196,Guest,2006-03-05 14:14:00,0,"Woods, Were you staying that week? We'll be at Sunset Point, right across the river from the old and burned out lodge. Chuck"
555198,Reels,2006-03-05 16:02:00,2876,That was the bottom line for us. There was more to the trip than just the fishing. We love the area and will wait for it to bounce back. I just changed my tactics a little. I fish for more northern and smallmouth instead of 24/7 walleye. Now it is like 22/7 for walleye. :-) <{{}}><
