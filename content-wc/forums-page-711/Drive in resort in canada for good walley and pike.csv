555777,River_eye,2006-03-30 12:02:00,1486,"http://www.alanmeline.com/ This is the old website, but this is a lodge you can go to where all the guides are owners."
555778,walleyegeek,2006-03-30 12:20:00,3,"I reccommend Pointe Du Bois, Manitoba. Very serene with great fishing for Walleye, Northerns, Smallmouth Bass, and HUGE Lake Sturgeon. There are two areas to fish here, the high side of the hydro dam and the eight foot falls (lower side) campground. You can drive up to Eagle Nest Lodge and rent a boat or stay at the lodge (about an hour up river with awesome fishing). I suggest renting a boat and staying at the campground at eight foot where the scenery is amazing and the fishing equally impressive. Lots of Walleye, perch, northerns and bass on the eight foot side plus if you desire there are massive lake sturgeon (head down river and fish under the powerlines), remeber that it is illegal to keep a lake sturgeon in Manitoba but they are awesome to catch! There are so many other great drive up locations in Manitoba for Walleye but this is one of my personal favorites as I grew up in the area. I could even hook you up with a local that would be happy to show you around for a day or two :) WalleyeGeek"

555893,Guest,2006-04-01 16:37:00,0,"Hi Rich, If your looking for daily limits with little effort and your driving up. You can head up to Red Lake. Huge body of water with smaller lakes everywhere. I know of a few private places, drive to cabins with amenities near by. Catch fish right off your own private dock. And cheaper than staying at a camp. I also know people who guide in the area if you need. If you need information you can give me shout. [email protected]"
555898,jcd,2006-04-02 15:28:00,185,Rich You might try 'availability' in their url:http://www.sportsmansresource.com/myliesplace/index.htm jcd
555939,MoWalleyeguy,2006-04-04 10:17:00,409,Great June Fishing for Walleyes and Pike-www.witchbay.com This is an awesome well hidden camp. If you like a drive in camp that is secluded with no other camps or resorts for miles and miles then this might be what your looking for.
555947,Guest,2006-04-04 17:02:00,0,"looks like a nice camp, BUT it would cost me over three thousand dollars to stay a week. Yikes!!"
555951,Guest,2006-04-04 21:17:00,0,Try Buena Vista in Morson they may have an openning. 45 minutes from the border and on Lake of the Woods. buenavistaresort.com
555971,freespoolin,2006-04-05 22:34:00,472,"It is going to be very difficult this late to make a booking for early June. It's the busiest time here in the Great White North. Lake of the Prairies in Western Manitoba is one of the best walleye drive-to walleye fisheries in this part of Canuckland. You can stay in Roblin or Russell, Manitoba. There is a tournament the first weekend in June so avoid that weekend. do a search on Travel Manitoba for accomodation. I prefer the Roblin end of the Lake, you're staying closer to the lake and can launch at Rickers (spelling?)."
555996,shaky legs 2,2006-04-07 07:23:00,15,Holinshead Lake Resort West North and West of Thunderbay. It is the only resort on the lake and there is 20 miles of gravel to get there. Only people staying at the resort can fish the lake as the last 10 miles of road is private. George and Sherri Dickson are the hosts. The website is www.holinshead.com.
555744,richsaraand2,2006-03-29 13:42:00,1,I am looking for a good drive in fishing trip into canada that would boast good numbers of walleyes and northerns. Any suggestions would be great. I am looking around the first part of June.
555745,Trailerguy,2006-03-29 14:02:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]You are likely to have to shop around, most the better resorts have already booked guests for that time frame. I'd try: http://www.sleepydogcabins.com/ or http://www.tallpinescamp.com/ these two have excellent accomodations, while http://www.kingfisherlodge.com/ has adequate accomedations and are a little less expensive. All three are drive to locations on Wabaskang Lake of course, about 150 miles north of Fort Francis. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
555747,jigman 2003,2006-03-29 14:40:00,981,"Yep, good luck on that time frame. Maybe for 2007. Your best bet is to start calling every place you can come up with and see if they've had a cancellation. Do a search on here for drive in walleye fishing. Lots of good info."
555749,Guest,2006-03-29 16:28:00,0,"Exactly Jigman2003, Early-June is starting the peak period for most places . . .you will be hard pressed to find a good place at that time, unless there is a cancellation. Do a search, and start phoning. Good Luck! NWO Fishing Bum"

555762,Guest,2006-03-29 22:00:00,0,Hey Trailerguy. I see you spend lot's of time on Wabaskang. I'm going in September. Didn't realize there were that many lodges on the lake. What kind of traffic should I expect second week of Sept? Staying at Peffleys. Can't wait to get there.
555764,Trailerguy,2006-03-30 07:06:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Wabby is pretty good sized, over a 100 miles of shoreline I beleive. You'll see other boats but there's seldom any conficts, plenty of room for all. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
555767,Guest,2006-03-30 08:33:00,0,"Hey Richsaraand, i just booked a trip for the end of May with www.southbaylodge.com last week. This will be my second year going up there, i like northerns most of all and thats what they have lots of. Also lake trout on the main lake and we went to one of their portage lakes and caught lots of walleye for one of the days. Its a drive to the launch and then a 2 mile boat ride to the lodge, nice setting. H. Hofmeister"
555770,extremeangling,2006-03-30 10:52:00,7,"Take a look at 1.)Dog Lake Resort (Near Thunder Bay) 2.)True North Outposts (Emo, near Fort Frances) 3.)Ross' Camps (Emo, near Fort Frances) All offer great walleye fishing with pike and smallies to boot. #'s 2 and 3 have lakers too. -DV"
555774,Guest,2006-03-30 11:17:00,0,Try Franklins Stone Lake lodge. It is a do it yourself type of resort. 7 local lakes to choose from plus a place to launch a bigger boat in the bug river with access to Gull Rock Lake...Huge fish!!! Lots of reefs..be careful if you have glass! Lots of fish. Long drive just short of Red Lake!! Franklin is an absolute riot!!
