Falls airport and the van service brings us to the float plane base, then we have a 35 min. flight to camp. I think they also offer a boat-in. We have a diverse group and they all don't like to fish the same thing, this works out great at this place - they have walleye, smallmouth bass, pike, muskie, lake trout and muskie. They food is always good, they have nice guide boats, we always take the guided package because its and all inclusive package and they carry 8-10 guides on staff. We have been going for 4 years now and things seem to get a little better each year. We will be back up there in early august this year. there website is www.happylandingfishing.com"

555716,jigman 2003,2006-03-28 15:26:00,981,"Don't know of any lodges that have direct flights from the states. Many do have a service that will pick up from the nearest airport and bring you to the base camp, then fly you out. Don't know if you want an American Plan Lodge or outpost type facility where there are multiple cabins. Giving as much info. as you can will help others here guide you to a camp."
555718,Guest,2006-03-28 16:06:00,0,Yes looking for American plan Lodge. Willing to make connections. Just didn't know where to Start. I have a couple of favorite outposts that we go to but I have 3 business associates that don't have as much time and would rather go to a lodge. Thanks
555720,Guest,2006-03-28 16:35:00,0,"I believe Watsons will pick you up anywhere in the US or Canada.http://www.pineportage.com/ No lakers, but plenty of Walleye and Pike. Great place and people."
555722,Guest,2006-03-28 16:39:00,0,"Your best bet isn't that cheap. You can fly from Chicago to Winnipeg and connect to Bearskin airline to Red Lake Ont. From there you will be picked up by your outfitter. You can leave early Chicago time and be fishing by late day if your timing it right. I'd recommend Viking Outposts. I've fished with them for more than 15 years. They do a very nice job. They are at: http://www.vikingoutpost.com/. Im sure there are a number of outpost that fly out of Red Lake that could take you out if you want to shop around. I'm guessing you are looking at 600-700 for the airfare and about 800-1200 for the lodge. Not cheap but it sounds like you want the EASIEST option. Thanks, Brett"
555723,IaDave,2006-03-28 16:45:00,476,"Check out Uchi Lake, they fly out of Sioux Lookout. I know Sioux Lookout has a decent sized airport that you can get connections to and they will pick you up at the airport. I think their website is www.uchilake.com. I have been there before so if you have any questions feel free to email me."

555981,Mohleye,2006-04-06 10:07:00,368,"Take a look at Birch Lake Lodge. They have American Plan, and good fishing including lakers. Their base is in Red Lake, so I'd think they could get you from the airport to their base. They have a website."
