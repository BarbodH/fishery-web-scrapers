555634,Airkiller2,2006-03-25 10:25:00,4,"We used to stay in IF, but realized 10 minutes more and no long lines on Sat morning. NO BRAINER Stayed at the Red Dog, La Rendevous and Super 8. We preferred the Super 8 Very clean and a good continental breakfast. Ak2"
555654,Guest,2006-03-26 05:54:00,0,"International Falls had developed a reputation for vandalism and theft from vehicles and boats at motels. The Holiday Inn actually added a night guard and I saw a post on this site that said despite that guard and being slightly ""out"" of town (extreme western edge), patrons woke one morning to find trailer tires slashed. I was concerned about that. So I called a few of the motels and asked them if there was a theft/vandalism problem. I got answers like ""not as much anymore"", ""we don't have a problem because our night desk looks right out into the parking lot"", ""not for 3 years now because the city added night police patrols"", etc. Having point this out, I should also say I do have friends that stay there every year for one night before crossing the border. They have done this since 1992 and never had a problem. They stay in the Super 8 on the southeast edge of town. I prefer to cross and stay at the Rendezvous as others have noted. Not cheap, but nice."
555666,Airkiller2,2006-03-26 18:46:00,4,That was one of the reasons we crossed the border. We came out one morning and found one of our tires slashed. There were 25 others that morning at the goodyear store when they openned that Sat. Needless to say we crossed the border the next year. Also be sure and check if the motel you stay at in Fort Francis has a security guardon duty. Other days other than Fri and Sat. La Rendevous and Super 8 do. The old Red Dog didn't . Maybe that has changed. Ak2

Not as fancy (or expensive) as the Rendezvous, but very nice, with a large, well-lit parking lot right across the road from the police station, if you have worries about security. We stayed there and were very satisfied."

555919,waleht,2006-04-03 16:06:00,132,"Another option to consider is to stay in Orr, MN. There is an American Inn there. I stayed there once. The accomoddations were nice, but it was a little pricey compared to a super 8 or Days Inn, but I felt comfortable leaving my boat unattended. There only is a parking lot in the front which is well lit at night. Also if your taking the wife or kids there is a nive pool with a 115' waterslide. If you normally take US 53 you can't miss it if you have been that way before. Also I have been staying in international falls for the last 25+ years and I have never had a problem (probably just jinxed myself). I ussually stay at the Days Inn (nothing fancy, but reasonable) which is next to the Chocolate Moose. I mean right next to it. About 100 feet from the front door. The Chocolate Moose is a nice restaurant. It was originally a big Boy and then the international skillet (not very good then), but has been the Chocolate Moose for last 5 years or so. Nice atmosphere and good food. The super 8 is on the opposite side of the Days Inn. What can I say its a super 8...I did not like their beds. The Holiday Inn was ok....again pricey and the restuarant is not that good. Also crossing the border lately has not been so bad lately with the new building up. Another thing to consider is if its really slow at the border there is a higher chance they will ask you to pull over and search you vehicle and boat. Safety in numbers I guess. I did stay at Red Dog a long long time ago. We did it for the same reasons you are thinking of crossing the border the night before. However the food was terrible. Canadian eggs are terrible. I Have not stayed at the other Canadian hotels mentioned."
555528,Crappie Kid,2006-03-23 15:56:00,1581,We are arriving at Eagle Lake on July 1st. I am trying to decide on staying one night near Hibbing-Virginia MN (10 hours) or going a couple more hours and stay in Fort Frances. Is the border rossing is busier at noon or at 7 pm on that busy Saturday?

That way no long lines to deal with on friday morning. The lines are really nothing on friday morning anyway, but I have to believe that IF (and that's a big if), you can get a room in Fort on friday night you are way ahead. No dealing with lines at the border crossing, sleep in."
