555820,rpieske,2006-03-31 13:18:00,1276,"April 23rd. The ice was officially out. Here is a link to the status of the ice and historical data for Minnesota, which includes LOTW.http://climate.umn.edu/doc/ice_out/i..._status_06.htm"

555901,ChuckD2112,2006-04-02 18:45:00,6,Rob The ice will be gone it always is. Tie some flies buy some tackle. It will be time to go before we know it

555911,Guest,2006-04-03 09:22:00,0,"Grant is a nice lake to fish, been there. Nice cabin also. Lots of Smallmouth also. We did not have even a Musky fallow in Aug. but caught a lot of pike. Musky season? If you don't and can't keep'em then Musky season is always open to me. L&M is good bunch to fly out with. You should have a good time at Grant."
555927,ChuckD2112,2006-04-03 20:52:00,6,Thanks Elmo This is our 7th year with L&M first to Grant. A musky would be a nice bonus but the pike and bass are what I'm going to target. A large pike on the fly would be awesome Word has it a few lakers also reside in the lake
555931,Guest,2006-04-03 23:04:00,0,"Chuck Yes the Lake Trout are there. We used white tube jigs w/lead heads. Large 5-6 inch tubes or large white plastic ,1/2 or 3/4 oz lead heads. We found parts of the lake to be around 122' or so in the deep part. We fished deep and drifted with the wind. We had 3 nice ones, 1 may have been 10#-12#. Good luck!"
555668,Guest,2006-03-26 20:28:00,0,"Say 60 or 70 miles North of the border. We have a trip out with L and M Flyin to Grant Lake for Muskie, Lakers, Smallies, and Pike...bunch of Florida boys coming up for our annual migration to Canada. Rumors down south are its been a mild winter...April ice-out..we'll be fishing by noon on the 20th of May. Thanks all. Rob"
555677,Skylane,2006-03-27 06:43:00,101,It is anybody's guess when the ice will be out. I have been up there twice this winter and will confirm the ice did not get very thick and the weather has been pretty warm up until now (checked yesterday and it was 47). Last year was near record ice out on our lake and it looks like this year may be early also.
555686,Guest,2006-03-27 15:12:00,0,I don't think Muskie season comes in that early up there so check the regs.
555690,fishmaster,2006-03-27 17:06:00,209,3RD Saturday in June for as long as I have been fishing Canada. The opener for Muskies that is.
555692,Guest,2006-03-27 18:16:00,0,"About 2' of ice last weekend. Ice-out is dependent on weather now through May. Very little chance of having ice still at opener, so you and your boys should be just fine Rob. It's really still too early to guess, but you said 60 to 70 miles north of the border . . . May 1 is a decent guess, but at this point, I would offer a 95% confidence interval of two weeks (i.e., a 95% chance it's within or between the third week of April and second week of May). A better estimate could be given in a couple weeks. NWO Fishing Bum"

555697,Mr Ranger,2006-03-27 22:01:00,272,Still looks pretty white all over if you check this out :) Not far off however!http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/mod...r.143.250m.jpg
555773,extremeangling,2006-03-30 10:56:00,7,Ice is going fast. It's rained in Fort Frances and Thunder Bay for 2 days now. No snow on the ice and warm nights. -DV
