555985,Guest,2006-04-06 12:51:00,0,But what ever you do . DON'T tell why it can't be a spring or summer wedding.
555987,Guest,2006-04-06 14:19:00,0,"LOL. Sounds like me when I was ""planning"" my life out. I was a guide and my family owned a resort when I was that stage of life. Thus...I got married in August (slower fishing period). Had 1st child in April (before opening of fishing). Had 2nd child in late October (we were closed by then). The 2nd child's arrival did hold up my annual Saskatchewan goose hunt that year...but, not much :)."
556072,IaCraig,2006-04-07 12:47:00,434,"Or you can do what I did. When I was dating I told her once ""I was hunting and fishing before I met you, and I will still be hunting and fishing after you leave."". She knew I was half joking, but she never forgot it. I was lucky enough that she did mary me, and 18 years later she usually still asks me what weekends fit into my hunting and fishing schedule before she makes other plans. IaCraig"

I told my wife the same thing (almost, I left out the after your gone part), and she has always respected that. She knows that at certain times I'm going to be bowhunting, period. Same with fishing. If you're honest up front it is a whole lot easier in the long run."

Can't imagine a better honeymoon, the walleye fishing was pretty good too! She is still my fishin buddy, any woman that you can spend 12 hours a day fishing with is a lifelong keeper. Scott"

555958,Guest,2006-04-05 16:12:00,0,"I was just reading a post from Baxman, who was advised that he cannot go to Ross'Camp this year because he is getting married in June. I made the same mistake that he is doing. I got married on June 15 (I think that is the date). I then went and had a baby on the first week of June. Now talk about issues in planning a June trip. It is nearly impossible. Now my wife is due July 6 with another child (A boy). Between the actual birthdays, the weekend that we host the birthday parties, and the Anniversary, half my summer is dead to fishing. I am not going to be able to go on a beginning of June trip till the youngest kid is out of Junior High, and the birthdays are not as big a deal. If I could do it all over again, the May wedding would have been much better. Young guys, plan accordingly."
555960,Guest,2006-04-05 16:22:00,0,"May wedding? That's a recipe for no one showing up in Minnesota. That's the best walleye fishing of the year. No one even considers a May wedding that fishes around here. But, the advice is outstanding!"
555961,Todd_NE,2006-04-05 16:58:00,1330,I have always suggested weddings and child births on Feb 29. Todd

555963,Guest,2006-04-05 17:07:00,0,"One of our group got Married on the opening of Moose season. The lady would not reconsider the date and he capitulated. It was terrible watching grown men twitch and keep checking their watches. One child later and about seven years of #### it ended in a Divorce. You can always get another Woman but a good dog, hunting and fishing partners are hard to come by. God only gives you so many seasons to hunt and fish."
555965,Guest,2006-04-05 17:56:00,0,"Dec 31 here. Get the write-off, and I don't fish that night, have to take her out anyway. Kinda like a double header. Her idea to boot."
555968,Guest,2006-04-05 20:47:00,0,"Well instead of waiting for the kids to get out of jr.high, and then waiting for the b-days to not mean as much, you could do what i did, or what happened to me. Trust your wife, go off on a business trip only to return home to find out she ran off with the UPS guy, lose half your money to get rid of someone you can't trust and start over. But at least i now have time to go fishing without any worries and when i need to ship a package i only use Fed-Ex"

555975,Catman59,2006-04-06 06:36:00,345,I guess I must have done OK ....... we celebrate my youngest daughters birthday at Knobby's on the way to camp and our wedding anniversary is either at camp or on the trip home. Just another day for a fisherman. ( and an understanding wife !)
555977,jigman 2003,2006-04-06 07:59:00,981,"Get married in October. You might ruin a weekend of bowhunting or bird hunting, but your spring fishing trip(s) won't be affected."
