My fault for not looking at the depth map before taking off across a couple miles of very deep water. Had I looked at the map in front of me I would have seen that I was being pushed off course by a stiff sidewind and would have realized how close I was getting to a sunken island amidst the deep water. (I now fish that sunken island!) I pretty sure I'm not the only one to ding a lower unit in Canadian waters. At least we made it back to camp otherwise we would have had a twelve mile row. Pooch

556057,Guest,2006-04-10 12:09:00,0,"Not having insurance is ""being reckless"". Those resoters are living dangerously. It is just a matter of time before they will be in trouble! Wait until that resorter has something happen to someone while in one of his boats. If you provide a service, you had better be insured, or be prepared to lose everything."

556059,Guest,2006-04-10 12:44:00,0,"There's a big difference between insurance for liability and insurance for lower units. The only lower unit coverage we can get comes with $1000 deductible. When people freak out after that is pointed out, I start to worry about their competence. You would be shocked at the number of people that want to rent a boat and then get a little upset when you tell them they need a $20 map so they can find their way around. If you're extra careful out there, you'll be fine. The best insurance for a rental boat is a guide. Take the issue out of play and relax."

555458,Guest,2006-03-20 09:25:00,0,Does anyone buy rental insurance on the boat and motor you get with your cabin? I'd love to but can't find a company to write it. My homeowner policy covers the liability but not the boat and motor. The camp owner doesn't offer any additional insurace. Any ideas?
555463,Guest,2006-03-20 12:38:00,0,dont hit any rocks!!!
555473,Guest,2006-03-20 17:45:00,0,That's a great one don't hit any rocks. I wish someone had mentioned that a few years ago
555474,idapaul,2006-03-20 19:46:00,82,the only place i have seen it offered was at andy myers on eagle lake and i believe it was offered by the lodge them selves not thru any company.you might want to look at some of the companys that offer trip insurance. proabably would be pretty expensive if you could find it.just got to make sure the guy in front stays awake.
555475,Guest,2006-03-20 21:33:00,0,Evergreen Lodge on Lac Suel offers it on their camp boats
555480,Guest,2006-03-21 11:17:00,0,"Every outfitter I have used has offered it for something like $20 a week. That includes the following outfitters: Canadian Fly-In Fishing (Red Lake) Williams Lake Lodge (Lac Seul) Breezy Point (Ignace) Viking Outposts (Red Lake) I'm sure most offer it, but you may want to ask your outfitter."
555486,jigman 2003,2006-03-21 16:38:00,981,"Call me crazy, but as a business owner I think I would insure my assets. Things like motors would be included. Most outfitters have a deal with a manufacturer for new motors every two years. A lot of these guys get their motors fixed for free as part of the ""leasing"" deal. If they don't that's what the insurance is for. Personally, I would never buy that stuff."
555490,esgrams,2006-03-21 18:17:00,92,"jigmann, I've got friends that run a resort and their insurance on their equipment was getting unaffordable just like any other insurance. What they did was go to a $500 dollar deductible policy (included in the boat and motor rental)and the renter picks up the $500. Otherwise they were having people leave in the middle of the night after racking their motors up on a rock and finding out they were responsible for the damages. By the way my homeowners covers my rental equipment, or so I'm told by my agent. I never had to make a claim yet (knock on wood!!) See Ya"
556077,Guest,2006-04-07 22:40:00,0,"Sorry but I know for a fact that the motor leasing that outfitters have DOES NOT include damages incurred by guests, such as props, lower units etc. It only covers normal warranty work. So expect to pay for it, if you break it. Respect their property...use it as if it were your own."
