555913,Guest,2006-04-03 11:49:00,0,"Trailer Guy, You have never fished with my wife. She always catchs the biggest fish and I have to hear about it all winter. I made the mistake of getting a replica made of a 32"" walleye she caught on Lac Seul two years ago and she makes it a point to everybody that comes to the house that it is her fish and mine are the small ones on the wall. I told her this weekend that she couldnt go this year because of the wine issue and her comment was ""Your right Honey, somebody cant go and that somebody isnt Her"". Thank God she changed her mind, but I think its only because she makes me drive the boat and clean the fish. I also have to do all the cooking and wash dishes. Oh well, she keeps telling me its a good deal."

There are wines from many different coutries and many vintages. Unlike beer, wine and liqour is much more reasonably priced and not really worth taking it in with you."
556076,Ivy,2006-04-07 16:32:00,556,I took a trip with my dad a few years ago and had brought 2 great bottles of wine. I had cellered these for years and was saving them for just such a trip. We also took some beer and whiskey. We declared it all and knew we were over our limit. I expected to pay the duty. The border agent told us we were over and then told us to enjoy the vino. I guess he didn't want to mess with it at 3:00 in the morning. Ivy

Why not try out some of the local flavours instead of the same old? Look for a VQA seal on wines to be sure of a good choice. Henry of Pelham has an awesome Merlot and Cabernet Savignon."

How does wine affect the limatations on liqour when crossing the border. Is it equal in bottle volume to real booze??? Thanks for any help, Married Man"

Don't be so tight, let her bring the wine, declare any extra and pay the tax. You're on vacation and spending a little extra anyway, if momma's not happy nobody's happy. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
