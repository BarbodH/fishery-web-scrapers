555969,bigfish1965,2006-04-05 21:19:00,3210,I pick up my new little boat next week. I keep hearing guys rave about Amsoil. I am concerned about reducing the amount of oil etc (don't even know if I can with the oil injection). How does it compare witht he Merc oil and how would it affect warrantee? Motor is a 25HP 2 stroke (2006)
555990,SSH,2006-04-06 17:37:00,526,"The use of AMSOIL should not void any warranty provided their product is used as directed. Here is a link to their warranty statement: http://www.amsoil.com/warrantyletter...ted_4_8_03.pdf In regard to your Merc 2-stroke, the injection system dispenses the oil as needed. It can be altered, but I would recommend that only an authorized mechanic perform any adjustment to regulate oil use. Unauthorized adjustment that results in engine failure will definitely void your warranty. I am not an AMSOIL dealer, but do use it in my 1998 Merc 75hp 2-stroke, chain saw and gas trimmer."
