555899,Guest,2006-04-02 16:16:00,0,looking for a link to Northern Outposts out of Armstrong that shows the lakes and what the cabins look like. Found a link for them at northernoutposts.com but it was basic and didn't show rates or any pictures so not sure if thats the only link they have. thanks for the help
