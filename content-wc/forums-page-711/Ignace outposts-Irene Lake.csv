555477,Redtail5998,2006-03-20 22:24:00,34,Has anyone fished Irene Lake with Ignace Outposts.I picked up a brochure from them at a sports show and was wondering if this is maybe a lake I would enjoy. I am primarily interested in walleye and northern fishing. I would really appreciate any info that I could obtain about the fishing or Ignace Outposts. Thanks in advance.

We booked for right after the season began(and the ice went out), 3rd or 4th week of May. The owners were great. Flight took off on time, and we were at camp by 10:00am. What a camp! Sauna, shower, hot water in the cabin, A RECLINER, a sofa, HUGE kitchen and dining area. We loved the accomodations. We had never experienced this type of fishing before - we've always targeted walleye and bass in the past 20+ years. Irene is primarily a lake trout lake, although we did finally track down the walleye, halfway through the week. Again, we were there early. The first day, we caught trout in 2 feet of water. We also caught them in 20 - 30 feet the same day. The week we were there, the temperature went from 70 on Saturday, to 90 on Wednesday. In fact, a forest fire started somewhere in the area Tuesday or Wednesday, and we were engulfed in smog for the remainder of the week. At the end of the week, we were graphing trout in 120 feet of water. The best bait for us (and the cheapest) was to run up the many streams that feed the lake - catch suckers, who were running up the streams, and use them as ""strip-ons"", on a modified Lindy rig. After you catch your first shallow water Laker, you'll be hooked. They fight like a cross between a walleye, and a smallmouth. You KNOW you've got something on. Anyway, the walleye can be found in the mouths of the streams that dump in. We had our best luck in the evening - casting rapalas upstream and just reeling fast enough to pull in the slack +"
