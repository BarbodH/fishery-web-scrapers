I've taken different partners in the past but Dave wanted to learn a little about the competitive side of it all. We headed out on our Pre-fish around 10 o'clock that Wednesday Morn. Our heads were a little sore from the excitement the nite before but the sun was shining and so was our gear. We decided to head out to Keg lake first stop. I had done well in the river during the summer so I knew they'd be feeding around that area. Waves were high, a great Walleye chop for that time of year. We decided to spin with large minnows. Within 30 minute I had my first 6 pounder, ""man oh man looks like it's gonna be a good day"" I told myself. We sat in that area for a good 3 hours , we caught some smaller fish after that but nothing to write home about. Sitting in the waves, takes a little out of you, especially when you've been celebrating the nite before. I told my partner that behind Mackenzie was our next spot. Behind the Island was a home run. We took cover behind a small Island around the Slate bay area. ""Bang"" my line was on fire. 23,26,27,31,31 inch Walleyes. If I were to tell a tail this is the one I'd tell. I've never, ever, caught so many big fish as I caught during that pre-fish just before the Tourney. And my partner, well, let's just say he was a spectator and he handle the net like a professional. He couldn't believe it himself.(hehehe) <hope he reads this. During the Tournament, our fisrt day, we did Rank in the top 50 which was respectable but not as well as what I've done in the past. Our honey holes died and we did take a chance by sitting in one spot for a long time but sometimes that's the chances you take in a tournament . I've done better without pre-fishing, top 20 one year. A little luck and a little help from the fish Gods...... That's my story.... May you all have stories...... Tails of Mista Walleye"
