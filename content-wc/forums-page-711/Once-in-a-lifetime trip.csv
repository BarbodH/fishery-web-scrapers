So many lakes with no road access just over the hill type lakes full of trout,and walleye's. In most cases only a few locals fish them , and today's fisher man don't like to portage too far. So a little winter action is all they get. If you thought a shore lunch tasted good in summer, it's ten times better when the hot lunch hits the belly on a cold day"
555943,jigman 2003,2006-04-04 12:58:00,981,That does sound incredible. I've wondered about doing a fly-in during the winter. Does anyone offer a trip like that?
555944,Guest,2006-04-04 14:06:00,0,"try River air in Minaki, I saw they had at least one plane with ski's on it. But I recomend renting a sled if you don't have, it's the only way to go . And NO they don't let yo udrink on them either"
555946,jigman 2003,2006-04-04 14:55:00,981,"That's one place I wouldn't consider drinking, on a sled that is. Just like while driving a motorcycle, no drinking there. No drinking in my car while driving either. I do transport beer from the store to home in my car, however ;-)"
555601,Guest,2006-03-24 06:17:00,0,"Here's another suggestion - www.oldpost.com - no lakers, but all else is wonderful. Don't tell anybody else. Good luck. John"
555624,Guest,2006-03-24 16:12:00,0,"I love Ontario fishing , but if you don't mind the drive . Northern Mb just past Flin Flon to Kississing Lake just after ice off. Though I'm sure it's good all year. Walleye are lke fishing in a barrel , tons of pike in the 10 -20 pound range , and the lake has large lake trout . And at that time of year the five of diamonds works on all. Just look up the manitoba master angler awards records. That lake takes it's share ."
555641,fishingbuddy,2006-03-25 14:07:00,18,Have you ever fished Lac Suel. Accomadations are great at the resorts I have stayed at in the Northwest section near Ear Falls. Walleye fishing I don't think can get any better than what it is at Lac Suel today. You might want to check with Gawleys because they have different packages and also Whitewing resort has houseboats for rent and the experience is great. Hope you can find the experience of a lifetime. Hope you find that once-in-a-lifetime trip. Good fishing.
555894,Guest,2006-04-01 17:15:00,0,"Bonding with your father on a ultimate trip is probably the greatest gift a son can give. My buddy did same with his father a couple of years ago. The three boys took a little trip up north and had a blast. They did a fly-in just out of Red Lake. A little expensive but worth the trip. If you want sort of the same experience without emptying your wallet. And a little more privacy, your own cabin, do a little golfing, fishing all in the same day. I mean catch Walleye, Pike, Trout pretty much everytime you drop your line. Especially if your planning a spring trip you can give me a shout. I know of a few places on Red Lake with great private accomodations. My buddy also owns the local marina if you need to be set up with gear, guides etc. [email protected]"

555926,north_alabama,2006-04-03 20:29:00,172,"Jigman, Don't think it was mine. I sent one about 1-1.5 weeks ago, and don't have anything in my inbox today. Mine likely got caught in your spam folder or something. I'll try to recreate it and send it again. Appreciate the help."
555933,Ogoki,2006-04-04 07:23:00,291,"North Alabama, I would suggest NOT to put the trip off with your Dad. I wanted my Dad to go to Canada just one more time with me since we had not been there together since I was in high school but it will never happen. Dad had a second open heart surgery at 70 ,then a heart attack then back surgery then hernia surgery then a morphine pump for his back then now a possible hip replacement and the list goes on and on. If at all possible go this year ! ! I am 50 and have seen so many customers of mine who got to around 60 and them or their spouse started having health problems and their retirement is spent going to doctors vis**** and stopping by for coffee at Tim Hortons. That was some of the luckier ones . A couple Decembers ago three of my customers died of heart attacks , all in their late ffties. I just semi-retired at 50 and plan to do it NOW. I can vouch for Jigman on the QUALITY of Mattice Lake Outfitters ! ! Good Luck !"
555936,jigman 2003,2006-04-04 08:48:00,981,"Hey North Alabama-just responded to your email. The guy that can really tell you about Ogoki is ""Ogoki"". The guy who responded right above me. He's been there a lot, and at other MLO camps that I haven't been to. I'm sure he'd be glad to share some thoughts with you too. Ogoki-81 days til we're fishing on the Ogoki. Looking forward to seeing you up there. Anybody else here going to the Ogoki with MLO?"
555940,Guest,2006-04-04 11:51:00,0,"Don't worry, it's not like we're completely putting it off. But we're already committed to a boat-in (Lac Des Mille Lacs and 5-6 portage lakes) this summer, where we went last summer and had a blast. Next year is up in the air but we had intended to look at a ""minor"" fly-in with the same outfitters we're staying at this year, but the cost of MLO is actually less and probably the fishing is superior, so we're already thinking about changing 2007 plans, but are a little limited time-wise because of some family events that summer. Also looking at AWO. What we're thinking right now is maybe doing Ogoki Res or Pringle next summer, and Kagianagami in '08, or vice versa. The events you described are exactly the kind of thing I fear happening someday, and it is why the ""big fly-in"" (for us, anyway) keeps creeping forward in time, and now it's morphing into two trips. One will be our last, so I hope to keep making them better each summer until that time. Is what Jigman '03 said accurate? Are you willing to give me a data dump to sort though all the MLO options? If so, I'd really appreciate it. So many lakes and so little vacation time ...."
555427,Atlanta Dave,2006-03-17 07:47:00,323,Check out Lakers Unlimited on Lake Athabasca. Atlanta Dave
555434,pfg1,2006-03-17 22:16:00,52,"My dad is 70 and fighting brain cancer. I know about your dilemma. I recommend two resorts, both fly-ins: Knee Lake Lodge Milton Lake Lodge Either one is a trip of a lifetime. Good luck, DAVID"
555442,Guest,2006-03-18 21:01:00,0,I went to a sport show this winter looking for Knee Lake lodge and a few of the resort owners said that knee went banqrupt. I didn't believe it so I checked around and it is true.
555444,Guest,2006-03-19 09:12:00,0,Where did you check around and get the confirmation that it actually was? I don't believe it...
555452,Guest,2006-03-19 19:00:00,0,"I would recommend either the northeast section of Lac Seul (Chamberlain Narrows Area) or Kesagami Lake. As you have probably already heard Lac Seul is an excellent fishery. You will catch between 50-100 walleyes per day, with a decent number in the 23""-27"" range and a realistic shot at a 30"" + fish. The pike and smallmouth bass fishing are also great. The norhteast section of the lake has very few outfitters and thus there are not many people you have to share the lake with. I believe Ojibway Outfitters and Anderson's outpost camp are the only outfits up that way, other than a houseboat here and there. We have been going to Ojibway for the last 10 years and honestly I can't say anything negative about the place. I would recommend checking out there website: http://www.lacseuloutposts.com/ Kesagami Lake offers the best of both worlds: remoteness, comfort, and great fishing. It is located just south of James Bay and is famous for it's huge pike. If you want to catch a pike over 45"" this is the place to go. The walleye fishing here is excellent too, you won't catch the big eye's you get out of Lac Seul, but you will find the same quantity of average size fish. The lodge is very nice, you get daily maid service, there is a full time chef, bar, etc (essentially a Canadian Wilderness Resort). You have a guide that will operate the boat, put you on fish, clean your fish, and cook your shore lunch. Basically, everything is done for you, all you have to do is fish, eat and drink. The only negative is you have to use single barbless hooks (so you have to convert any tackle that does not conform) and this trip will cost twice the trip to Lac Seul. If you want more info on either place email me ([email protected])"
555454,Guest,2006-03-19 22:02:00,0,Knee lake did go brankrupt but it was bought by one of the minority shareholders. They will operate as North Star resorts. Check out:www.silsbylakelodge.com Trophy pike fishing at it's best at half the cost of knee lake and it's 50 miles north of it. May not get the mint on the pillow but you will get trophy pike and lots of 3-5 pound walleyes. Good luck
555481,north_alabama,2006-03-21 12:01:00,172,I've done some looking into most of them and will continue until I've checked out all the suggested options. So much water and so little time! Thanks again!
555487,Guest,2006-03-21 16:48:00,0,"For the ""Trip of a Lifetime"" try catching 20lb Monsters all day long in the Land of the 24 hour sun. Friends of mine have been there and all they can say is ""UNBELIEVABLE""....check it out.www.nwtfishing.com/ Lac La Marte Lodge"
555509,north_alabama,2006-03-22 19:42:00,172,"Jigman 2003, I sent you an email concerning Mattice Lake Outfitters. No rush, but if you didn't get it let me know via the board and I'll try again."
555548,Guest,2006-03-24 06:17:00,0,"Here's another suggestion - www.oldpost.com - no lakers, but all else is wonderful. Don't tell anybody else. Good luck. John"
555391,north_alabama,2006-03-15 08:27:00,172,"Looking for ideas. As time goes on most things come to an end, and I'm wanting to plan a once-in-a-lifetime-type trip with Dad 2-3 years in the future (around his 70th b-day). We like fishing for Walleye, Pike, and Lakers. We love Ontario, but could be open to other options. We've roughed it plenty in the past, so I'm more inclined to kind of strike a balance between a good degree of comfort and remoteness/good fishing. I know ""once-in-a-lifetime"" means different things to different people, and our means are modest, but not destitute. Just as a reference, our past ""big"" trips have been to Quetico/BWCA, and we'll be making our second trip to Lac Des Mille Lacs in Ontario this June, since age has become a factor as far as the parks are concerned. So what are everyone's best experiences: outstanding multispecies fishing, good accomodations, relaxing, etc., the whole nine yards. Any/all suggestions appreciated."
555392,MN_Moose,2006-03-15 08:42:00,965,I have thought about this allot. The one area that would be my once in a lifetime trip would be to Bear Narrows section of Lac Seul. Ojibway Outfitters has a place there. I think Anderson's has one or two nearby. That is what my definition of once in a lifetime trip would be. Better than a fly in. Not as costly as a trip to South America. With two to three years advance notice you should be able to make a reservation.
555398,jigman 2003,2006-03-15 11:51:00,981,"I went through this about 5 years ago. I had done a drive in with Dad and the fishing was sub-par. I really wanted him to experience walleye fishing at its best. I looked for a long time trying to find an outfitter who'd take a party of 2 on a fly-in. That is, without paying for 4. I finally landed on Mattice Lake Outfitters out of Armstrong. Dad and I did 3 trips with them. Probably the best thing I ever did as far as ""bonding"" with my Dad. Now, he is struggling with his health and so is my mother. He cannot leave her alone, and so his fly-in days are over. I am glad that we did while we could. If money was no object (which of course it is), I would have loved to take him to Gangler's Seal Lake Lodge. Someday, I am going to get there or to a place like it."
555401,Guest,2006-03-15 15:24:00,0,"I cannot afford this trip, but my friend has gone several times in the last few years. It is expensive, but he brags about everything about it. The food, the lodging and the fishing is incredible.www.wollastonlakelodge.com He stepped out of the boat once in waders in a bay to fly fish for northerns, and he said huge northerns were bumping into him. He was afraid to put his free hand in the water. I think it is over $3000 for the week. I like my $599 Lac Seul destination."
555402,Guest,2006-03-15 15:40:00,0,"Try Moosepoint Lodge on Shikag Lake. This is a fly-in out of Ft. Francis. Only resort on lake and catch and release. We threw back 25"" walleyes all day. The biggest walley for the week was 31"", biggest nothern 42"" and biggest smallmouth was 22"". Guides will take you anywhere you want to catch a specific fish. The people who own this place are from West Bend, Wi and are very nice. The lodging is very clean and the food id great!"
555409,Guest,2006-03-15 19:24:00,0,"Jigman, thanks. Where did you go with Mattice? I checked out their website, and they seem to have quite a large number of options. Good fishing?"
555413,jigman 2003,2006-03-16 08:07:00,981,"NAlabama- yep, very happy with the fishing I've had with Mattice. My Dad and I fished Vick one year and Pringle for three. Pringle is definitely a better walleye lake, Vick is better for pike. Obviously, they both have good fishing for both species, but if I had to pick one it would be Pringle. Last year, my buddies and I went to Ogoki Reservoir. I believe that is my new ""home"" in Canada. It is a multi-cabin setting, but there is so much water you rarely see the other guys. Even if you do see a boat now and then, it isn't like you can't fish all the good spots. Given a choice of Vick, Pringle, and Ogoki to fish the rest of my life, it would be Ogoki. If you are looking for a quiet, beautiful setting where its just you and your Dad I'd go with Pringle. Don, Annette, Jason, and Yolanda will take good care of you. Great accommodations, fishing, and outfitting. If you'd like more info. you can email me at [email protected] Be glad to help you out."
555419,Stu,2006-03-16 12:09:00,472,"I agree with Dave B. Wollaston is second to none, but it is expensive. Also check out Andy Meyers Lodge on Eagle Lake. I haven't been there yet, but everyone I talk to raves about it. They have top notch walleye, smallmouth and musky. one day fly outs are also available. Good luck - Stu"
555421,grt1,2006-03-16 13:29:00,259,"I guided guys that went to Wollaston and they said that although it was good fishing, it wasn't worth the cost when compared to the lodges that are available without the added cost of flying into them."
555426,Guest,2006-03-16 20:06:00,0,"Check out Rough Rock Lodge on the Winnipeg River, Multi-species, close to the lodge, secluded."
