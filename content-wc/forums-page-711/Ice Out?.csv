Expected Temp +14 celsius 46 fahrenheit this up coming week...I was checking the ice last week, lots of air holes.. 4 wheelers still tearing up and down in front of my place...Howey Bay.. My predictions would be April 21 ice completely gone... With high winds your looking at April 19th... I spoke to many locals and the bigger fish are heading towards the spawning beds already...They've been catching females with eggs... Mista Walleye;)"

555263,AGreen,2006-03-08 09:44:00,1,Well let's hear the predictions. I'll be heading up to Red Lake for the opener. Anybody got an idea on when they think ice will be out? My guess is that it will be early this year. Maybe a couple weeks early. But I could be way off base. pikeboy
555272,grt1,2006-03-08 13:12:00,259,"I was out a couple weekends ago and there was only 19"" of ice usually at that time of the year we are looking at close to 50"" so my estimate of ice out is 3rd week of April."

555279,Guest,2006-03-08 18:47:00,0,Theres about 32in of ice on the lakes here in NW Ontario where I live. I feel we are going to have an average ice out. I'm guessing the third week of April to the fourth week. The Walleyes we're catching are also very ripe. More so than normal. I also saw a Skunk this week. The Kaministiqua River is open and I also saw an eagle. Bottom line ...I'm going fishing on Friday.....

555319,Guest,2006-03-10 08:51:00,0,In 1987 the ice went out in Howey Bay April 20th. That the earliest since 1931. I fill this year it will go earlier. There alot of bad ice.
