529627,Guest,2003-04-28 22:35:00,0,You should be able to vacation in Canada without worrying about SARS. The print media & television news people jumped on this story like flies to #####. The kill rate for West Nile and other flu viruses are much higher then SARS. You Yanks will always be welcome in my backyard (except you Philly Flyer fans - knock my Leafs out eh !)
529617,Guest,2003-04-08 12:27:00,0,"was just wondering if anyone is having any concerns over the outbreak of sars in canada i heard today that canada has the second highest number of cases for a country. i have a trip planned in july and will definitly still go, but it does make one think a little."
529618,Guest,2003-04-08 12:33:00,0,"All the reports seem to indicate that the problem is in the Metro Toronto area. All the good fishing is a long ways from there.I think especially when you drive, there is nothing to worry about."

To add some perspective, the Greater Toronto Area has a population of 4.5 million, and there are presently less than 200 suspected cases of SARS. Although tragic, the death total of 11 is far less than the number of people who die from the flu every year.The vast majority of people who get sick from SARS are either very old, very young, infirm, or those with weakened immune systems. For more than 99% of those infected, the symptoms are indistinguishable from that of a regular flu.And, as has been mentioned, there is even a lesser worry in areas outside of Toronto. Good luck.derrek.""It's the weaseling out of things that sets us apart from the animals.... Except the weasel."" - H.J. Simpson"

I noticed a lot of people with masks at the airport, (they get alot of flights from Asia) Also saw some masks on people in the downtown area.Being cooped up in a plane is one thing but I will not let it stop me from going to Canada especially by car."
529622,Guest,2003-04-08 18:04:00,0,"Just like someone said about the flu, 99 people die each day in the U.S. from the flu, and sars attckes the same number of people.The only reason SARS is in the news is for something new!"

529624,Guest,2003-04-27 16:54:00,0,I know a guy who's a border patrolman up here in Northern Mn and he tells me that there are rumors of the entire US/Canada border being shut down completly in a matter of days. Wow!
529625,Guest,2003-04-27 17:41:00,0,wow is right please keep us posted if you hear anymore thanks
