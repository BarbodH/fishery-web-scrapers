(that new lung desease we'er hearing so much about) Well they have just added Onterio Canada to the list because of the number of outbreaks there. Any of you natives know anything about that? Not really concerned....just interested."
529836,Guest,2003-04-14 18:56:00,0,We had another three deaths here this week in Toronto. SARS is being watched closely but your risk of getting it is extremely low. The people who died were all elderly. I would not worry about it unless you are travelling international to the far east.

There sounds like alot of cases but Toronto has more than 3 million people and about 150 cases of SARS. Wearing a surgical mask offers no protection. Any mask must be of a biological control design.
529838,Rat,2003-04-15 14:32:00,102,How are you going to catch SARS while you are out in the boon docks far away from any people? You still may need the mask if your partners are enjoying Labatt's and beans.
529839,Vitreum,2003-04-15 14:49:00,221,"the last thing i'd worry about in canada is sars. last year it was west nile virus. a few years ago it was lyme disease. and let's not forget about those mice in new mexico. if your number is up, your number is up. fish on."

If you have concerns, by all means bring a surgical mask, maybe even some rubber gloves....and don't forget your marijuana...don't forget to tell Canada Customs it's strictly for medicinal purposes...legal only in Canada, you know...eh!...OH...the rubber gloves will then come in handy:+"
529841,Guest,2003-04-28 08:36:00,0,"In all my years of coming to this site, this has to be the silliest question I've ever heard. Complete nonsense. I can't beleive someone would even ask such a ridiculous question. I live in Toronto and I haven't seen one person in the city with a mask on...let alone on a fly-in. I'd be more concerned with West Nile Virus than anything else. SARS has been blown way out of proportion and the WHO hasn't got a clue...maybe if they actually came here to investigate they would see for themselves that there in NO EMERCENCY here. Maybe from their desks in Geneva they see it another way. The WHO is a joke."
529842,Guest,2003-04-28 10:36:00,0,Actually us folks from Ontario don't have a thing to worry about because we are immune to SARS. The only people dying from this disease is Visitors.I think it would be best for everyone to stay home breathing in only the air your heppa filter puts out because its the only safe way for you.That should do it. Thanks for your interest.........
529843,Guest,2003-04-28 17:20:00,0,death toll up to 20 here in toronto. West Nile season just around corner. nothing to worry about.
