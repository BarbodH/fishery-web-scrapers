530265,Guest,2003-04-28 12:33:00,0,We are heading to Cozy Camp on the English river and wanted to get our leeches and minnows in Ignace...maybe a little liquor also...is there an on-line bait shop in Ignace that anyone knows of so we could e-mail ahead and have everything ready when we get there??
530266,Guest,2003-04-28 12:51:00,0,Stop by Castle Baits in Ignace. They are located about a 1/3 of a mile west of HWY 599. They are usually well staffed and I've never had much of a delay. TGG
530267,Stehle,2003-04-28 14:05:00,95,Ditto. They open at 6:00 am but the girls are usually there earlier than that and will serve you.
