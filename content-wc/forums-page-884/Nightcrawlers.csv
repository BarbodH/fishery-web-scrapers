530021,Guest,2003-04-23 19:52:00,0,How much would a flat cost in Canada? Any bait shop recommendations?
530022,Dinky,2003-04-26 15:45:00,307,I always buy my crawlers(flat of 500) in North Bay on my way to Quebec.Last year I paid $41.00ca which included gst and pst taxes. You should be able to get them accross the border in your neck of the woods for around that.Even if you paid $80.00ca its still cheaper than Cabelas.
530011,bronzeback77,2003-04-22 08:37:00,97,We are taking our annual trip to Lake of the Woods in May and I am planning on purchasing 500 nightcrawlers from Cabelas ( $39.99 seems like a good price). Has anyone ever bought their crawlers from Cabelas? Can they be transported in the container that they are shipped in? Do I need to transfer them into something else for the 17-hour drive? If so how big of a container would I need to transport 500 worms? Any tips would be appreciated.
530012,VMS,2003-04-22 09:13:00,1103,The only thing I know is that the bedding the nightcrawlers are in must be commercial bedding. I would think that Cabelas would have it in commercial material since I think they can ship them.Size? I would think you would want a decent sized cooler that can be made to have air pass through from the top.steve
530013,Newby,2003-04-22 09:32:00,148,"We take crawlers up to Canada every year. We just put them in a regular cooler with some ice, not to much. Our drive is about 20hrs. Not sure about Cabela's packing, but I think I seem to remember someone on here saying they were packed in soil, and not bedding. Search the archives, because I remember reading it here."
530014,Guest,2003-04-22 11:09:00,0,"Insofar as transporting the crawlers, you could get two coolers, one that will fit inside the other with room for a gel pack or ice. Pack the smaller cooler (foam) with prepared bedding (that means water added and chilled at least 24 hours before) and put in an appropriate amount of crawlers. Read bedding directions for amount of bedding needed.I take crawlers in the small two sided worm styrofoam boxes in worm bedding-3 dozen each and place the boxes in a slightly larger softpack cooler with a frozen gel pack. I have extra gel packs for each cooler for rotating cool packs. Ice might also work but you will have drain the cooler and make sure the water doesn't get in with the crawlers. P.S. take a small container with a lid with you to, if you use part of a nightcrawler-don't put the unused part back in with the other nightcrawlers. Put in a separate container. Depending on how fastidious you are you can put the worm boxes in the refridgerator at night or swap gel packs from the freezing compartment."
530015,Wallerian,2003-04-22 22:07:00,10,"I bought a flat of crawlers from Cabela's a few years ago for a trip to Canada. They were packed in soil so we transfered them into commercial bedding, wrapped a couple freezer packs in newspaper layed on top of the bedding and reused the styrofoam cooler they were shipped in. Very important to keep them cool all week and they should be fine. Check with some of your local area bait shops. You may find that their prices are competitive. Ken"
530016,Cat Eye Outfitter,2003-04-23 06:41:00,9,"Just a side note. Your crawlers should be packed in bedding -- paper or other ""non-soil based"" organic medium. Canadian customs can (or probably will) refuse entry of worms if they are packed in soil. As most of the posts have said here, ""cool"" is the key. Packing your crawlers with some surrounding ice packs/ice will keep them nice 'n fresh."
530017,Guest,2003-04-23 11:27:00,0,"All good tips for preservation of your bait. I use a 2 ""thick styrofoam large cooler, probably in the 90 quart range. I just freeze half gallon or smaller water bottles that will fit in the small freezer of our gas refrig when we get to outpost cabin. Using commercial bedding is a must to get across border, then I usually have a leyer of newspaper over the top with ice jug on the paper. Crawlers last all week. We usually go through 500 for 4 guys in a week, better to have a few extra. Local bait shops will accomodte you if you give them advance notice. I've never been brave enough to do mail order. Heard Cabelas does a nice job though. Good luck! 79 days to go!"
530019,Thumper,2003-04-23 11:58:00,133,"I was just talking to the guys at Cabela's in Owatana about this same issue. No, they're not shipped in commercial bedding, they're shipped in dirt. Assuming you're going into Canada for LOTW, then you need artificial betting.There's an outfit called Vados in the Twin Cities that does a ""Canadian Pack"" flat of nightcrawlers. http://www.vadosbait.com/bait.html or 763-784-6728 in the Mpls area.When I called a few weeks ago, they weren't able to give me a price yet. End of April they said. Gues it's about time for me to call them back.Anyway, their Canadian Pack is already setup with artificial bedding, so all you have to do is add an ice pack or two, depending on your travel distance.Another option would be to contact a bait dealer in the area you are heading, to avoid the hassle of transport. When I called around, the prices of most (not all) dealers were competitive with Cabela's/Bass Pro ($45/47). They just wanted a week or more notice."
530018,663,2003-04-23 12:01:00,15,"All the above info is good and will keep your crawlers fresh for the trip and the week fishing. Cabelas crawlers will come packed in soil and you will have to repack in a bedding. A dirty job but not difficult, just takes a little time. An earlier post suggested Vados Bait at 1 888 584-3474 for bulk crawlers that come packed in bedding in a cooler ready for the trip. I have not tried them but plan to this year."
530020,Larry S,2003-04-23 12:11:00,666,Bought 500 crawlers last year from Vados bait.They come in styrofoam canada pack with bedding not soil.The bait was fine and stayed cool all trip with a few ice-packs on top of the bedding Phone # for Vados is 1 888 584 3474 the price last year was almost the same as cabela's
