528953,Bobby,2003-03-25 21:49:00,211,"I sometimes travel gravel roads and, unfortunately, have gotten a couple chips in my new boat. I have one of the screens near the tongue of my trailer, however it has cut down the rocks by about half. Slowing down significantly when trailering helps greatly, however rocks still fly up. This fall, while fishing near Pine Falls on the Wpg River, I spoke to a fellow who had a boat 'bra.' It was black vinyl and had a soft inside. It covered the entire front of his boat and clipped over the upper bow deck area. It was the cats @ss! Unfortunately, I've forgotten the fellow's name AND the person who specially made the bra for him.Does anyone know where I could get such a thing made? It is cheaper than a paint job and decals, by far. Any help or suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated."
528954,Bryan,2003-03-26 06:52:00,244,"Bobby:I'll take a shot in the dark here. Was the fellows name Tom Koizumi? He has a bra as you describe and was at Pine Falls last fall. I just had one made the same as Tom's a couple of weeks ago at ""SEW WUT"" in Calgary (the same lady that made Tom's). The bra cost $750 Can. with the lining. There is also another fellow in Swift Current Sask. that does a variation of the same thing($350 Can. I believe) but the material isn't as sturdy. If you like I could send you pictures of the bra and I'm sure any commercial upholstry shop could make you one. They certainly work well and look good as well."
528955,Guest,2003-03-26 09:53:00,0,Most any boat canvas place can make you variations of what you saw.They are a time consuming thing to take off and put back on.There are rockguards made that stay on the trailer and protect the boat quite well. Those are not an imposition.
528956,Bobby,2003-03-26 15:06:00,211,Pictures would be great! The guy I met had a green Mr Pike 17 single console and was from Winnipeg. My email:[email protected]Thanks!!
528957,Guest,2003-03-26 18:11:00,0,I have a boat bra. If it takes me three minutes to install or remove from start to finish I'd be surprised. I have instructions you can give a fabricator. We used a Firestone product common to boat travel tarps for the bra with an anti-scuff liner. You may want to disregard the anti-scuff liner. It doubles the cost of the bra but we felt the cost was warranted.
528958,Highlander,2003-04-27 16:21:00,6,Boat Bra!!???? That's priceless!! Afraid to get a little dingy on your boaty!!!??? Maybe you've been using your jock strap as a substitute for a surgical mask :P
528959,Guest,2003-04-27 16:33:00,0,"I bought one from Cabela's a couple of years ago. It cost about 160.00 US and has an antiscuff liner. Mine is a pain in the butt to put on, but it does work.When I had an aluminum boat, I didn't worry about the dings, but glass is another matter."
