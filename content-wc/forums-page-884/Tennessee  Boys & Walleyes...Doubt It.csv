Last year they sat around the campfire telling storys about their Wives and their sisters...one in the same. The ugliest one in the group brought a hand full of wool with him that he slept with. BAA BAA Yes Euker they are entertaining as long as they are down wind."
530101,Mike KS,2003-04-29 11:51:00,18,At least the Vols will go.....Missouri is to busy.
530090,Guest,2003-04-23 09:38:00,0,I got some Vols going on a trip to Canada this year and Im worried. I know I will have to tie on all their jigs and probably reel in any fish they snag. Last year they were afraid to get their picture taken because the flash bulb scared them. They sure can drink plenty of fire water and they have four teeth and 12 toes between the three of them.
530091,Guest,2003-04-23 11:06:00,0,"Hey Sam, good for you. Earning your wings for heaven it sounds like.Why else would anyone go fishing with a Vol. I have the pleasure of fishing with 3 of them each year at Lac Suel. There is actuallya 4th one but he has lived in Florida long enough to discover dentists. I had to take a year off, let my liver recover.They sure can eat too, but at least they are easy to cook for.Good Luck to you........reckon you already know you will need that."
530094,McQ,2003-04-23 11:07:00,615,Your introduction seems to qualify them Sam. How can we help you?
530092,Thumper,2003-04-23 12:01:00,133,"They may be easy to cook for, but DON'T let them do the cooking. You never know what may end up in the kettle! ;-)- RickRoad Kill Is NOT A Delicacy!!"
530093,Guest,2003-04-23 12:33:00,0,Euker....Do your Vols take baths while on your trip? Last year the only water I could get close to our Vols with was in their Whiskey. They dont smell to bad as long we keep them down wind or in the smoke of the fire. Sometimes I think they might be lefthanded if you get my drift. But to each his own. BAA BAA
530095,Guest,2003-04-23 15:12:00,0,Well howdy fellers. Thank ye for all the complemets you did pay to my couzins.
530096,Guest,2003-04-23 18:29:00,0,Come on Iowa Farm Boy...Everbody knows that Couzzin has two Z ss.
530097,Guest,2003-04-24 12:17:00,0,"Sam now that you mention it the bath thing was curious. They always went in pairs like girls to the bathroom. I tried not to puzzle on it too often, afraid of what I might conclude. One year one of the Tennessee boys had a milk carton with a picture of his missing sheep on the side of it. Every morning at breakfast he would get all misty eyed. Said he missed his wife too, she had the prettiest tooth in the whole trailer court. God Bless you for doing your part to educate them."
530098,Guest,2003-04-25 07:29:00,0,"Euker, Do your Vols ever catch any fish? Im not talking about the Bluegills they fish for with their Cane Poles and cork bobbers. I mean real fish like Walleye . I also noticed that they like to fish with one hand in a pocket and its not always their pocket....they certainly are a strange bunch. What is the deal about the Milk Carton....sounds like a missing girlfriend BAA BAA"
530099,Guest,2003-04-25 11:55:00,0,"Never. catch any fish I mean. They are a entertaining group. They only have about 22 letters in the Tennessee alphabet I have noticed. But it sure is fun trying to figure out what it is they are trying to say. I too have to remind them to set the hook now and then. They always have thier eyes closed when then they have the hand in the pocket thing going on. What the heck is that all about anyway? Do your guys wear the same bib overalls with no shirt all week, or do they change clothes occasionally? That's the only reason I never make a comment about two guys heading for a bath at the same time. By then I really am just glad to get a breath of fresh air. whew..."
