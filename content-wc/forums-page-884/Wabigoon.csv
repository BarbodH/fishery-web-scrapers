Fishing is decent, especially for pike. Anyone else been fishing there? How do you like it? Any tips on fishing there in early June?"
530236,Guest,2003-04-28 07:54:00,0,"Wabigoon is a big lake with lots of places. I've been going to Merkel's for at least 10 years. The family and I will be there June 6 thru 13. As it is about anywhere, the wind and the weather kind of dictate where you go. We've had good luck within 5 miles of camp and in Butler and W. Butler. It's a great place...Terry and Merrill are great hosts. 39 Days!!!:)"
530237,rebelrn2001,2003-04-28 17:53:00,1563,I agree Terry and Merrill are great hosts. We leave to head home on the 6th. You can ask them how Dan and Sue did. They will know us. I like to fish in Butler mostly. I found a couple spots last year in Wabigoon for pike that were pretty darn good. What do you use there? We like spoons. I haven't had much luck w/the 'eye's there though. That big island (?Christies Island?) wasn't much last year. That was the first I tried around there. Any suggestions would be helpful. I could give you my email address if you want and we can compare more notes. [email protected]. We are from the Green Bay area.Thanks.

530239,Guest,2003-04-28 19:56:00,0,"I have fished the Wabigoon/Dinorwic lakes since 83. Haven't been back the last couple of years because of a disagreement with the camp we went to. When you leave Merkels you go by a couple of good spots for walleye and northern. The grassy bay before the channel into Butler is often good for pike. If you head out from Muskie Bay and follow the shore line around so that you are heading east toward Dinorwic that point and northern shore is often good for Walleye. I have seen a 13 lb Walleye caught there. Watch the weather for a nice calm day and take fixn's for shore lunch and motor down to turtle Pond and Minnehaha. Depending on the boat and motor it is about an hour ride. In turtle, throw spoons or spinners in the mouth for pike, turn left and go down the the point on the east shore for walleye. Also fish the south wall for walleye. I have caught 27 to 29 inch walleye there. In Minnehaha fish the east shore below the falls. You need to fish this in the morning when it is in the shadows. Once the sun hits it they shut off. A friend of mine caught a 42 inch walleye below the falls jigging for walleye. If you head down toward Dinorwic there are two islands in the channel right before some private homes. Fish the south side of the north island, if you jig along here you will pick up walleye and northern. The north side is often good too but it is very snaggy. It's a great chain of lakes with lots of places to fish. I even find the sweede lakes good at times. We plan on going back soon."

I hope someday soon they have Navionics maps for this area. Regarding the grassy bay before the exit to go to Butler, that spot has provided many nice fish for me too. Last spring, I casted a large surface plug against the far left shore and 2 of 3 casts in a row to the same spot provided 30+"" pike. They just SLAMMED it!"
530241,Guest,2003-04-29 12:08:00,0,"rebelrn2001If you like to fish pike, which I like to do in the evening, take a ride east down the channel toward dinorwic. Once you go past Hubers the channel turns south to dinorwic, to the north and east there are a couple of bays. I like to go there about 7 pm when the wind has died down and the water is like glass. It is quite and peaceful (except about 8pm when the train goes by), and you can cast for pike and just relax. Will be up at Lac Seul 2 weeks from today getting an early start on pike before the opener."
