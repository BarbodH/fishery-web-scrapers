530223,Guest,2003-04-27 09:28:00,0,Anyone have a report on ice condtions at WB. Any guesses on when it will go out?
530224,darcyfish,2003-04-27 10:20:00,15,"I would say a week, bays are open,ice just out in the middle.Raining today so that will help and warm weather this week and some wind and we will be fishing out of boats again.D'arcy"
530225,Guest,2003-04-27 11:11:00,0,Great news Darcy. I assume the water level is pretty low. Is the south end open down by Whitefish Bay Camp?
530226,darcyfish,2003-04-27 13:40:00,15,"Water levels are way down, have not heard but would assume, little more current down in the south area."
