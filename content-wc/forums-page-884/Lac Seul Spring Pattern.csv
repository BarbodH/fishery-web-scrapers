530003,Guest,2003-04-22 06:12:00,0,Going to Lac Seul for the first time the second week of June. Would appreciatte it if any of you that fish Lac Seul would give me an idea about what pattern the Walleye will be in and what methods would be most effective in catching Walleye.
530004,Guest,2003-04-22 11:31:00,0,"No matter what you do, find a way up the river to Broad lake and Sunlight lake. The wally's will be slamming any rig in the tackle box up there. It's a long haul from most resorts, but pack a lunch and head up for a day of wrist bustin walleyes.Good Luck and watch out for the rock reefs. Every year I've been up we ended up buying a prop.Late"
530008,Guest,2003-04-22 11:57:00,0,You need a whole lot of jigs in a variety of colors in weights of 1/4- 3/8 ounce. Tip these with a minnow or a leech and the action begins. Hang on. If you want you can put a twister tail on also for added action. Have fun.
530009,Guest,2003-04-22 16:56:00,0,"Where are you going to be. We will be at Lac Seul the 2nd week in June as well. Fourth year in a row for the 2nd week in June at Lac Seul. I ask where because the west, central and east portions are all similar but a bit different as well. Classic presentations work well: jigs on wind blown points in 2 - 8 feet, bottom bouncers with spinners with minnow, and casting cranks when you find super agrressive fish or you just want to try and sly a larger fish. Jigs - I fish 1/4 in pink with a 4"" white curly tail (I bit a little of the body off to fit the jig better. Some guys take the time to go lighter or heavier depending on the water depth but that takes too much time for me in the spring when 90% of the time the fish are very aggressive and the extra time it takes to tie off and on is time enough to catch a couple of fish. I don't find color too big of a deal on LS in the spring, but rather the jigging speed is more important. That can go from the dragging approach to speed snap jigging depending on the situation. On spinners, generally hammered gold does the trick, but I will go chautruese or fire tiger is that is not the ticket. In spring, its a minnow bite for me. I have tried leaches and nightcrawlers, but this early, minnows out fish them 2 or 3 to 1. Not even taking in leaches this year.Its a great fishery. Respect the weather because LS can turn ugly in a strong wind. Better to ride out bad weather on a island and fish another day than have a major problem...cheers"

530010,Guest,2003-04-26 13:45:00,0,"If you go to Just Fish Fishing Reports, Silver Water Wheel Lodge fishing reports from last year have one for everyweek. Just look up the time period you will be going and click the report. This camp catches an unbelievable amount of big fish, and releases them. Check it out at http://www.justfishontario.com/disc18_toc.htmI just finished reading them all this morning and printed them all out. What a wealth of information. The site has an incredible amount of fishing reports from that area. Great site."

Broad is east southeast of Big Island about a mile up a small creek which name I forget. Sunshine, although I've never been there, is east of Broad and another small creek run. Two years ago, around Memorial Day, we caught wally on virtually every cast. Last year wasn't nearly as good, but, again on Memorial Day, few places were hot. It took about another three weeks for the whole lake to warm up."
