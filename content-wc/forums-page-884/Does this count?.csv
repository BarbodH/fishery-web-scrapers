530112,Soolkyut,2003-04-27 16:35:00,60,Well if it makes you feel better no fish bit and we always return all fish we ever catch so it isn't a big deal
530102,Soolkyut,2003-04-23 11:34:00,60,"Me and some friends went fishing in the river near my house for the first time this year, hoping to catch near anything, we fished for a few hours without any bites but were having too much fun to quit. Suddenly I have one on my line, a 15.5 inch Walleye which is super rare cause where we were fishing its mostly cats, bullheads and pikes. Unfortunately the fish didn't actually bite my hook, I snagged him under the mouth as he was swimming by I suppose. Other friends claim it doesn't count as the first of the year since I didn't actually get him to bite, i just hooked him when he was swimming along. Does it count?"
530103,Thumper,2003-04-23 11:44:00,133,"IMHO, it doesn't ""really"" count. But, if your buddy didn't catch anything either, it puts you a half-point ahead. ;-) I mean, really, LUCK does count for something!- RickThe Wild are heading to Vancouver - any good fishing spots up there :D"
530104,Guest,2003-04-23 19:12:00,0,If you were a Flyers fan it would count by me
530105,Matches,2003-04-23 19:31:00,236,"Nope! You didn't catch the fish, the fish caught you!"
530107,Guest,2003-04-24 06:08:00,0,"Hey Soolkyut, whatcha doin fishin at this time of year? The season doesn't open for another two and a half weeks. By the way, the fish does not count as caught unless it bites.Be careful, there are eyes out there and I don't mean wall eyes.Le pic"
530106,Thumper,2003-04-24 08:23:00,133,"Hey, BudEveryone KNOWS that Flyers fans can't count! ;-)Good luck vs. Ottawa on Friday."
530108,Guest,2003-04-24 10:13:00,0,"It is illegal to ""snag"" fish so I say it doesn't count.The WILD all the way !!"
530109,Stevie B,2003-04-24 11:50:00,157,I went trout fishing this last weekend and even then we got checked by the MNR. We thought that we were off the beaten path enough but they where still checkking us out. Be careful!Fish ON!!
530110,Guest,2003-04-25 13:53:00,0,"we were fishing out of my yard onto a really small river, I'm pretty sure no one was gonna check us"
530111,Guest,2003-04-27 15:10:00,0,"Being ""prtty sure no one is gonna catch us"" still don't make it right. You, my friend, are breaking the law by fishing out of season and I wouldn't hesitate to report you. If it's a small river you fish, I'm prttey sure about where that is too since I too am a local. Watch over your shoulder cause you never know who's watching!"
