Can't think of anything those monster pike would like more then a big, rotting, stinky, old, dead piece of meat. Can't catch walleyes every minute of every day while I'm in gods country"

Their response is copied below:""Smelt may not be used for bait, alive or dead. Smelt is an exotic species and have a reputation for spreading into waters quite easily. Though dead fish do not pose the same risk it is hard to monitor that no live fish are present and that there is no risk of fertilized eggs being released into the environment"".This response came from:Natural Resources Information Centre300 Water St.Peterborough, ONK9J 8M5phone:(416)314-2000 or 1-800-667-1940 fax: (705)755-1677 [email protected]"
