530244,Guest,2003-04-28 20:10:00,0,How do they do this??I Fish LOTW a few times a year and would like to try??
530245,Guest,2003-04-29 06:39:00,0,"I fish with two jigs at home and rig it with a three way swivel about 12 "" above the bottom jig. I use a 3/8oz leadhead with a 6"" drop off the swivel for the top jig and a 1/4oz jig on the 12"" drop. I use live bait on the 3/8oz short drop and a 4"" twister tail on the 1/4oz bottom drop. This bouancy of the twister tail allows the bottom drop to ""float"" off the bottom which helps minimize tangles and gives two distinctive presentations. Sounds like this can be done in Ontario and Im looking forward to trying it."

530247,Guest,2003-04-29 12:50:00,0,"Have not fished Ontario for many years, but in Sask. guys use a stand-up jig with leech (for example) as their sinker, then add about 4-6 ft of leader terminating with a hook or floating jig head with another leech (or?)."
530248,Guest,2003-04-29 14:16:00,0,"You can use a maximum of 4 hooks on one line.See below...Gear Restrictions (from 2003 Ontario regs)Hooks and LinesA fishing line must not have more than four hooks. On an artificiallure, a gang containing up to three hooks is considered to be onehook. In all other situations, a double hook counts as two hooks;and a treble hook counts as three hooks.As stated previously, it is illegal to use or possess lead fishing sinkers or jigs in Canada's national parks and wildlife areas.Contact National Parks at http://parkscanada.pch.gc.ca/parks/main_e.htm or National Wildlife Areas at http://www.cws-scf.ec.gc.ca for more info."
