529985,Xplorer,2003-04-22 07:58:00,244,"Friday noon will be better than later in the afternoon and midnight should be no problem at all. You will be detoured thru a non-construction route. It will be hard to tell what kind of delays folks will have until the first ""wave"" comes thru on opening weekend for Ontario. I just know that when i go over thru Superior to my in-laws in Hurley on a late friday afternoon, I have said more than once ""if i only had a buck for every boat that was going north I could retire in a summer"":) Even if you get stuck for a bit, just take it easy as everyone is in the same ""boat""!Xplorer"
529986,VMS,2003-04-22 09:11:00,1103,"Using the Proctor Route, you could actually go a bit further on 2 to (I believe) 33 north from Cloquet, which hits 53. Not sure about stop lights the other direction (I have never travelled that route), but I believe 33 is 4 lanes to 53...Just a thought..Steve"
529987,BD,2003-04-22 22:53:00,739,We allways take the Procor route. When coming into Superior take the turnoff for Hwy. 2 and go through Superior following Hwy. 2. You will cross the south bridge and get on the Hwy. 2 ramp from the LEFT lane. You will go south around Duluth and follow Hwy. 2 through Protor to Hwy. 33. Follow Hwy. 33 to Hwy. 53. You will find less traffic and fewer problems any time of day on this route.
529984,Karl,2003-04-24 19:37:00,63,If it's like last time it doesn't matter what time of day. The road was completely gone where they were working on it. No one lane at a time.
529988,VMS,2003-04-25 06:40:00,1103,"Doesn't that route have alot of stop lights in superior though? If you stay on 53, you have no extra lights and you have a direct connect with 35 south to 2...Steve"
529989,Xplorer,2003-04-25 08:59:00,244,"Yes, quicker to stay on 53 over the highbridge and head south on I-35.Xplorer"
529990,Guest,2003-04-25 09:38:00,0,"Xplorer, Is the towing grade as steep on the southern I-35 route as on 53??"
529991,Xplorer,2003-04-25 11:30:00,244,"TTWI, Yup, probably about the same grade but you can get a good run at it on the highway if need be. Only at max about .75 mile from bottom of hill to the turnoff towards Proctor. Xplorer"
529992,Guest,2003-04-25 12:36:00,0,"Thanks, 53 can get very interesting at the 5 corners, especially with a couple of inexperienced towers."
529993,BD,2003-04-28 05:04:00,739,If you go through Superior on Hwy. 2 you will hit a few stoplights but is the better route IMHO.
529974,Xplorer,2003-04-21 10:27:00,244,"I know that many of you heading up to Ontario travel north on highway 53 from Wisconsin thru Duluth on your way to the border at Int'l Falls. Just as an FYI, highway 53 is closed thru Duluth, and is closed until @ October 2004 for reconstruction. As yo cross the highbridge from WI you will be directed to go north on I-35 (right lane). You will be detoured up Mesaba Ave (first exit/downtown duluth exit) and will reconnect to Hwy 53 at the mall/gander mountain. I would think that there may be a longer than usual of a delay, especially on friday afternoons, as many locals use this route to go home and there will be a couple extra lights on this route. Also do not be suprised if the off ramp backs up on to the interstate as there is a traffic light shortly up Mesaba Ave after exiting I-35. Safe travels all.Xplorer"
529975,Reels,2003-04-21 11:38:00,2876,Thanks for the tip!<{{}}><
529976,fishmaster,2003-04-21 13:45:00,209,Thanks for the info and if anyone has a short cut around this please post.Thanks
529977,Xplorer,2003-04-21 14:01:00,244,"Unfortunatly, no shortcut. Only a ""long-cut"" if you want to avoid the detour/crowd. You could cross the highbridge and go south on I-35 and follow the signs for Hwy 2 west. Go thru Proctor and about 2 miles out of town you hit a set of stoplights. Starvin Marvins restaurant/truckstop is on your right, the intersection is at Midway road. Go right and follow north to Hwy 53. You will intersect hwy 53 at Pike lake/Fisherman's Corner baitshop north of Duluth.This route will be longer milewise, but may be shorter timewise depending on the traffic/time, and definitly less stressful. Xplorer"
529978,Vitreum,2003-04-21 15:52:00,221,thanks for the heads up. i'm flying into st paul. seems like i bypass duluth slightly to the west. will i get into this mess? duluth is confusing enough without a detour.
529980,Karl,2003-04-21 22:27:00,63,"Deja Vu? Two (or was it 3) years ago they did the same identical detour. It was also an entire construction season closure. Couldn't they have fixed it all correctly the first time? Worst part was the low budget for putting up ""53 North Detour"" signs. Best part was the detour ended at the corner where the Gander Mountain store is located, so I was still able to purchase just a couple more lures on my way up.Thank for the forewarning. 74 days and counting...."
529979,Xplorer,2003-04-22 04:09:00,244,"Vitreum, You will miss the mess. You will be cutting off of I-35 at Cloquet and heading north on Hwy 33 for about 20 miles to where it hits Hwy 53. Xplorer"
529981,Xplorer,2003-04-22 04:13:00,244,"You are correct Karl, the exact same area!! I believe the entire ""hill"" section is being redone up to where the 5 way is, they have been moving houses along the way. Hopefully they will actually get it right this time. The ""longcut"" i mentioned above would be about 15 miles extra or so. Xplorer"
529982,Guest,2003-04-22 06:25:00,0,Thanks for the info guys. This is what makes this board great.I will be heading through Duluth on a Friday at about noon. Do you think this will be a problem time?ThanksAdam
529983,TJ,2003-04-22 07:27:00,316,"WE go through about midnight. Do you know if they will be working all night, or should we make pretty good time at that time of night ?Thanks"
