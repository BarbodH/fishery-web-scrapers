Get a fencer kit like the kind that ranchers and farmers use. Put the leads at each end of the boat. Best to run at night when the fish run shallow. When you get caught and you will....they'll take away all your equipment, fine you........ you can share a cell with Buff and Biff. They like poachers........."

530178,Guest,2003-04-28 08:49:00,0,I think Dick should go away
530166,Guest,2003-04-24 06:41:00,0,Is there any way to rig a fish shocker using your batteries or a feed from your engine? Does anyone have a design they can share? I don't plan on keeping the fish just want to see what bubbles up.

530168,Guest,2003-04-24 12:03:00,0,Been know to try a little hooka in college but would not consider myself a hooka boy.
530169,Guest,2003-04-24 13:08:00,0,Dear Dick....This is shocking...I cant believe that the Withem family would stoop to tactics like this.
530170,Guest,2003-04-24 14:15:00,0,I don't acually want to keep the fish I shock. I just want to see how big they are.
530171,Guest,2003-04-24 14:21:00,0,Thats the same thing I told my wife before we got married.....30 years ago.
530172,River Rat,2003-04-24 15:29:00,43,"Well, as long as you intend on cleaning them instead of shock and release, why not use explosives. It always works for me."
530173,Matches,2003-04-26 19:28:00,236,I don't get it. You want to shock fish to see what bubbles up??What am I missing?
530175,bigfish1965,2003-04-26 21:33:00,3210,"You really need more than one battery. Seven or eight should do. Hook them up in series. ( Wait till your neighbours asleep and see if he has any spare batteries stashed away in a convenient place like under the hood of his car, etc.) Arrange the 'hot' end about 3 ft apart, lower it down, hit the switch and ring the dinner bell. They come up pre-cooked. YUMMY!"
530176,Guest,2003-04-27 08:45:00,0,"Dicked With, Just to be on the safe side, be sure you duct tape the leads from all the batteries to each side of your head or it won't work. Right above the temple area should be adequite. Should provide about 96 volts DC. Better yet see if you can find the same number of 24 volt batteries. Whatever you do make sure you hookem up in parralell to get the maximum effect. I would think this should be sufficiant to take care of your delema once and for all. Let us know how you come out."
