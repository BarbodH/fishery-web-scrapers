530258,Guest,2003-04-28 10:12:00,0,We fly out of Red lake usually about the first week of June. We have not had mosquito problems. This year we are going May 17th - 24th.I have been trying to get info on ice out in the Red Lake area for the past week and can't get any decent info. Hopefully someone will give you an answer.Bellcon

Make sure your young ones are weighted down as well as any small animals or they might get carried off. They also take a huge amount of blood when they bite. If you feel light headed head for cover. You don't want to pass out and let them have at you."
530260,Guest,2003-04-28 15:34:00,0,"There are no mosquitos in NW Ontario. This is a myth perpretated by the infidel locals to keep fishermen from the States from visiting. In fact, there are no biting insects of any kind within 1000 miles of our beautiful pristine lakes and thick woods. Beast and man may venture freely outdoors without fear of any insect bites. So, come...come one and come all to NW Ontario and leave your protective clothing and totally unnecessary bug spray at home. Let there be no more foolish talk of the mythical mosquito."
530261,Guest,2003-04-28 17:30:00,0,#1 ice will be out by then#2 With this dry spring that nasty bird should be limited in numbers at that time! Last year they were so bad they were dropping mule deer!lol
