529584,Guest,2003-04-12 09:52:00,0,Do you have any luck with smallies? What about trolling with crankbaits on the reefs. How do you fish Wallies in the weeds? With Do you use a slip bobber. I find fishing weeds very tough for me. I guess I am not sure what technique to use. Thanks for your help!!
529585,fishmaster,2003-04-28 12:51:00,209,Ice is going out on Eagle Lake on the Vermilion Bay end. Should be clear in a couple of day's.Looks like we won't have to worry about ice out for the opener this year!!!!!!!!
529574,Guest,2003-04-07 18:47:00,0,We are going to Eagle Lake on July 20th thru the 26th. We will be at the South Shore Lodge. Has anybody had any success for walleyes and smallmouth in that part of the lake and what worked? How are the black flyes at that time of the year?
529575,Guest,2003-04-08 10:22:00,0,"Talk to the owners. They will point you to the deeper rock reefs and sunken islands that time of year. The fish will be schooled so you may have to move around and find the active schools. Also, fish the windy side of points and you may find shallower active fish. Have fun!"
529576,JB,2003-04-08 10:26:00,109,"Will be up there July 26th-August 9th and staying at Pine Beach Lodge. Largest walleye ever to come into my boat (13 3/4 lbs) came two years ago from a spot very close to S. Shore. So yes, walleyes are in the area. Actually, walleyes are pretty much found all over the lake. I fish the Viking and Portage Bay areas the most. It's a fantastic walleye fishery with numbers of fish in the 4-6 lb range.But it can be very challenging lake to fish. Fish this time of year can be found anywhere from 6ft to 30ft and can be on sand, rock, or weeds. Be prepared to fish multiple locations and fish your electronics. If you don't mark fish, leave. Don't waste your time with minnows (the resort will probably want to sell them to you). Bring crawlers and leeches and fish with lindy rigs with about a 2.5' to 3' snell. Hope this helps and good luck.Catch a big one and let her go!"
529577,JoeUpnorth,2003-04-08 19:50:00,17,I agree that you can skip the minnows and use other baits to catch fish on Eagle. Have you ever tried using an eight inch plastic worm on a harness instead of the real thing? Or tipping a spinner and snell hook combo with a twister tail and back trolling it with a snap wieght? I am going to give them a try this July when I am there. I always use the lindy rigs made out of leader meterial (wire) and not mono. I got real sick of going through the rigs with all of those pike and their sharp teeth ripping them apart.
529578,catchNrelease,2003-04-09 14:16:00,157,"JB, We'll have to compare notes. That's exactly where I fish every year end of August. I don't fish Viking as much do to the boat traffic. I located a few reefs within a mile that don't get fished as much and produce just as well. Portage Bay with the clearer water gets big fish. Good luck and let me know how it goes.Oh yeah, I fish out of Temple Bay."
529579,JB,2003-04-10 09:42:00,109,"CatchNrelease,I don't actually fish Viking reef either. Too busy as you note. I usually fish reefs or small islands in that general area. That part of the lake is my favorite place to fish when the wind is kicking out of the west. Have a little spot that walleyes just stack up on when she is really howling. Everyone heads for cover, but we stay and nail the eyes'. Portage is my favorite part of the lake. Not as many resort boat with guides on that part. You can actually fish alone with no one in sight most of the time.JoeUpnorth,Never tried the tactics you talked about. But it's worth a try. I think there are many tactics that would work on that lake, you just have to give it a shot."
529580,Guest,2003-04-10 10:51:00,0,I think the best time to fish eagle lake is in the Fall. The middle of September to the middle of October. There are lots of big walleye in the back bays. The problem is the weather can be a problem. I think this lake is coming back big time. I stay at Fin and Feather. It's great. You can also flyin to some of the oweners lakes for a day and experience some tredmendous walleye fishing.
529581,rebelrunner,2003-04-11 17:42:00,20,"Rice, (or anyone else) Could you tell me more about your endorsement for Eagle Lake fising in September. I am considering a week, in mid-Sept., at some resort to tie into 1. Northerns and 2. Walleyes. What area of the lake, what presentations have worked well for you. Got a couple of buddies dying to fill their tackle box with the right stuff for a slay-ride. Thanks!p.s. Basic housekeeping plan lodging...any places you'd recommend or avoid? Your input would sure help narrow the field. Thanks!"
529582,Guest,2003-04-11 18:57:00,0,I mostly jig with minnows and crawlers. Bottom bounchers should work well also. Mid September you might want to try Muskie fishing also. I suggest that you get a quide because the lake is hugh. Jig points deeper than you would in the Summer and spring. Try trolling crank baits off of some of the islands by deeper water. If you would like Fin and Feathers number drop me your e-mail address.
529583,Mark_NE,2003-04-11 21:04:00,58,"Rebelrunner,If you are serious about fishing Eagle in September you owe it to youself to check out Andy Myers Lodge. Steve Herbeck runs a first class operation. My son and I spent a week there last July and had a blast. We booked our trip back for this summer right after last summers trip. AML is one of those places that you would like to keep all to yourself but are willing to share with other fishermen who love the sport. You may want to check out Muskie fishing in September on Eagle as well, Steve runs a fall trophy Muskie special. AML's web site is - www.andymyerslodge.com"
