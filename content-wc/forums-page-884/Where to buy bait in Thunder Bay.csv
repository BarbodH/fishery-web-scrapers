Good luck and good fishing!"

530292,Guest,2003-04-29 14:55:00,0,"We go with a group of 12 people usually and last year we finally kept track and we caught and released over 2000 walleyes in a week. You go through a few leeches doing this, but what better way to spend a week of your life?"

530294,Guest,2003-04-30 06:33:00,0,"Thats 24 Walleyes per man per day....thats not even a good morning for our group on Lac Seul....Most of our days last year were 80 plus per day per man..12 hour day. Hope that Lac Seul is as good this year as last. Noyhing beats a day of 23"" Walleyes ...less its 24"" Walleyes...... Barbless hooks/catch and release."
530296,Guest,2003-04-30 07:15:00,0,"Thanks Larry S that site was really helpful! Sam,I wasn't boasting as to numbers of fish, our group consists of two families with 7 kids, the whole day is not spent fishing, just a great family time. And there is no better place to spend it than in Gods great outdoors. I was not trying to start a numbers contest-thats why I didnt name the lake. Good luck to all this spring and summer season!"
