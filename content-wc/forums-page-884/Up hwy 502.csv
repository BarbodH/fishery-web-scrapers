There's still one section of old rough surface, about 20 miles long, but the rest is new and smooth. It was raining lightly today on the return trip. The lakes in NWO are just starting to melt, shallow bays and narrows with moving water are barely open. Most lakes have not started to melt around the shorelines and I was told 30"" of ice is common. Temps in the 50's took the snow off and rain turned the top of the ice gray this weekend.Wabaskang looked to be 2 feet lower than it was last fall, as low as I've seen that lake, they need some big rains and sunny days before the opener."

529955,Guest,2003-04-27 18:15:00,0,"The lakes are really softening up. I""m guessing 10 more days before complete iceout. The pond by my house is icefree now and as a rule we have 10 days to two weeks of ice on the bigger lakes if history repeats itself as it has for the last 20 years."
