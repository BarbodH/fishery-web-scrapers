6670768,LoDo,2022-07-05 18:44:00,721,We use it on Red Lake. It works for what we need it too.

When the water level changes you can put an offset in your helix that will change all the depths. So if your map says you should be in 10’ but you’re in 8’ of water you can put an offset of -2’ and your helix will correct the whole map to show the water level being 2’ lower. Even if the depths are not 100% accurate it’s a good way to see contour and ledges that may be holding fish. If you want to give it a test run before buying the chip you can download the navionics app on your phone. I think it’s like $20. The app has an option to download a section of the map on your phone so you won’t need cell service to use it. Your cellphone’s GPS still works in remote areas. It’s nice having GPS and depth map up there. If there are other boats in your group that use the app they will show up on your map which is nice as well. I’m headed up 2 weeks from today to fish with Ceasars, I think I’ve spoken to you on this message board in past years, you fish with Taramac if I remember correctly? Have you been up this year, or is your trip coming up?"
6670904,valley366,2022-07-06 10:53:00,193,I have not kept current on phones but in the older model I Phones they did not have an internal GPS and require cel signal for GPS use. Android's generally have an internal GPS capability.I do agree it is a good cheep way to test the data for a lake. I also like the ability to have a secondary source of navigation data available should I ever get lost.
6670908,Peterpikes,2022-07-06 11:02:00,33,"I have an old iPhone 6 that I use for mapping up there, but I’m not sure what models have gps and which don’t. Easy way to check is to put your phone in airplane mode and see if the gps is still working. I should have mentioned in the earlier post that putting your phone in airplane mode up there will make you battery last 3x as long because your phone won’t be constantly looking for cell service"
6671078,tweedrules,2022-07-07 04:03:00,107,"Thanks so much for the info. We will definitely purchase, especially with the depth adjustment feature. We don't fish at Tamarac. We've use Air Mont Laurier/Lac Du Male for the past 10+ years. We have used Caesars, Air Melacon, Oasis Baie du Nord among others. Been going for 16 years. Love the Gouin. I posted a trip report on the Gouin thread. Have a great trip and thanks for the help."

Even areas a bay or 2 over from a good spot can be completely off. Having said that, I have the app installed and have prescouted a bunch of structures that I want to explore as we will be in a part of the lake we have never fished before on this coming trip. It is always interesting to see how the outfitters hot spot map looks compared to my guesses as a learning experience. I also marked many navigation landmarks and printed out a few copies to keep in each boat just in case."
