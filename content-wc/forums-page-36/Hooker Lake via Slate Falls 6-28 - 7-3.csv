Nothing really big. Only targeted pike for about an hour one day. That bite was also very good. Several nice pike but nothing big. Had several pike attack our walleyes at the boat. Weather was very comfortable. Wind was tough one day. Fished mainly around the 15' depth. Caught most of my walleye on jigs with twister tails and paddle tails. As a change up I occasionaly used a lindy rig with a floating jig head tipped with a small piece of nightcrawler."
