6672026,prov1800,2022-07-12 07:00:00,5010,Didn't dish steamboat.To far to run fished around bay of islands area.
6671314,prov1800,2022-07-08 08:00:00,5010,"Had a great 3 days with returning party finally.We fished from Lac Suel Lodge and had 3 days of great fishing.weatger was very nice and wind was low first 2 days but yesterday had some rollers on big parts.Teusday was a incredible day of catching.Walleyes are all in the 20-25""hard to catch that 17"" take home size but got it done.Northern pike were aggresive everyday and mostly slot sized. Wed/Thurs dropped off for some reason.Mayflies were out but not crazy.Water temps are great at 66-69 f depending where you go.Would say not that busy out on lake.Deeper bite is not really happening yet so most fish came shallow 10-15 ft and 2 of my spots I always at 5 ft were dynamite.Great camp atmosphere friendly tines in fish cleaning shack.Got to meet up with Pooch yesterday and his fishing buddy.Had nice conservation w√¨th them.I get another 3 days on LS from Onaway Lodge starting tomorrow"
