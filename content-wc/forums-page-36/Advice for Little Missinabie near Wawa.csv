6669158,mvt528,2022-06-30 09:43:00,2,"Looking for some walleye advice for Little Missinabie (aka Little Miss) near Wawa. We're flying-in with Hawk Air, July 10th - July 17th 2022. We've been all over NW Ontario over the years, mainly the Nakina area, but we've always gone August/September. This will be our first early July trip. At what depth should we expect to find the walleye in early July? Should we focus on the open lake areas or the river area? Are there recommended spots near the Hawk Air cabin? Or near the Air Dale cabin?What do you recommend for depth and locations in nearby Elbow Lake?What approach is recommended for early July? jigging twister tails or casting swim baits or trolling Hot-n-Tots? Any and all advice would be appreciated. Thanks, MLM"

Little Miss offers a ton of different fishing options. You can travel as short or as long as you would like in search of good fishing locations. Our group found trolling to the be best in early August. There is an area near the Air Dale camp where there are native petroglyphs. A very cool area to explore. The area if front of the petroglyphs always produced good catches for us. You do not need to travel far from the Hawk Air camp to get fish there are some nice points to the left of the cabin (facing the water, back to the cabin) that were always reliable. Once again we trolled spinner baits with a crawler. We tried the river a couple of times and it always produced fish but nothing out of the ordinary. If I recall most fish were in 10-12 feet of water. There are...or at least there were several nice cabbage beds near the petroglyph area that always produced for us. Little Miss is a nice lake and I would go back but be ready for some pretty long boat rides. I hope this helps."
