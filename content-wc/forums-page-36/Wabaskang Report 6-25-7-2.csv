6671764,UKBDM,2022-07-11 06:24:00,178,"Never had a problem getting to Keynote, Aerobus, or McLeod(North)Bay in a camp boat or my boat. If water got really low (like last year when Jim and Julie didn't open) a big boat might have issues getting to Keynote but Aerobus and Mcleod would still be no problem. Yes, we fish most of the time within 15 min of Jim and Julies. We do go up to narrows that open into the big lake and we also fish some spots in the second lake but 80-90% of the time we are in the areas you mention."
6670550,UKBDM,2022-07-05 09:31:00,178,"Great to be back @ Jim and Julie's Wabaskang Camp last week! Two missed trips was too many! Crossed border @ IF about 8:45am Saturday. Maybe 25 trucks/boats in front of us ... only two lanes open but a 3rd opened up and it moved pretty quickly. Officer asked for passports ... had my ArriveCan QR code ready but wasn't needed. No random test. Never seen 502 in this great of shape. 105 nice also ... no detour. Made the normal stops at Beer Store/LCBO, QSL Tackle in Dryden, and Dutchie's in Perrault Falls. Had lunch Sat at the Whiskey Jack Restaurant on 105 just north of Jim and Julie's road. Great pizza, burgers and cold beer. New tradition for us before our our camp arrival time of 2pm. Cool, windy and wet was the story of the week. Cool and wet was fine but wind (10-20mph) complicated things. Lake has come down 1.5' but still 1.5' feet high. Jim has 16' Lund SSV's with 20hp Yamaha's and we add transom trolling motors and portable fishfinders. Great fishing boats but tough boat control in big wind. Walleyes were scattered early in week ... a couple fish at each location but never big schools. Jig/grub/crawler and crankbaits worked well. Later in week they started moving into weeds and we started catching them in better numbers. Jig/minnow or jig/grub/crawler worked best. Some success on emerging weed edges with bottom bouncer/spinner rigs with crawler. Average size was up with 26.5"" being biggest but many over 20"". Smallmouth were scattered also. Top water bite never materialized but Mepps spinners, tube jigs, and crankbaits did the trick. 19.5"" was biggest but we usually catch a handful of those. Not this year. Just the one. Northern Pike were the highlight of the week. Big thick fellas that bit all day. Trolling stickbaits in shallow(< 15') or Super Shad Raps in deeper water worked pretty much all day. Casting orange spoons and double blade Mepps #5 spinners in morning/evening was best for me. Group caught 20+ over 30"" with yours truly boating two 39"" studs in less than 24 hrs. Hooked one pretty deep and he was bleeding pretty bad ... didnt like keeping him but it was best thing to do. Perch/Crappie were biting well in the weeds ... didn't fish for them much. No luck on Lake Trout ... usually we catch 2-3 trolling blue/chrome spoons with dipseys up in Aerobus Bay. Didn't really see mayflies like we usually do. Late iceout and high water levels? Great week overall despite the wind. Never caught the big numbers of walleyes I like but enjoyed being on Lake Wabaskang for my 11th year in a row. I'm not counting the two COVID years. Return trip was uneventful. 10 trucks/boats ahead of us at 7:30am. Fewest questions/shortest time ever."

6670694,dosxx,2022-07-05 15:36:00,60,Thanks for the report. Our group is headed there on July 22. It will be our 25th or so trip as a group but our first time in that area. Iâ€™m counting the days!
6670822,JAY221,2022-07-06 04:44:00,877,"Question for you. Did you find much debris floating in the lake? Thanks for the info. Later, Jay"
6670854,UKBDM,2022-07-06 07:16:00,178,We did not. Apparently there was a lot the first two weeks of the season. You will see it on the shoreline. Wabaskang is normally pretty safe from obstructions but some of them are underwater that normally are above. Noticed one of the other camp's (Sleepy Dog I think) dock was wrecked by the ice this spring and the cribs out front are under water. Not a place you wouldn't be cautious anyway.
6670864,JAY221,2022-07-06 08:10:00,877,"Ok, Thanks. Sleepy Dog is where we will be. The cabin just to the right of the docks going in. I just scheduled my second trip in August. We were up last August and it was the opposite as it was extremely low. Later, Jay"
6671226,sheepman,2022-07-07 17:04:00,98,"Jay, PM sent maybe more than once!"
6671288,JAY221,2022-07-08 04:39:00,877,"Yes sir, You are a wealth of info on Wabaskang! I'm headed back in a week. Later, Jay"
6671504,ILScott,2022-07-09 06:52:00,139,"I always go back to Wine Lake and when we go across Wabaskang it looks wide open. When I look at where Jim and Julies is located it looks more protected. I was wondering since you stay at Jim and Julies the following. So can you get into Keynote Lake? Can you get into Aerobus Lake? Do you mainly fish Aerobus Bay, McLeod Bay and Ruby Lake?"
6671518,JAY221,2022-07-09 07:42:00,877,"We stay at Sleepy Dog Cabins but to answer some of your questions it is yes with normal water levels or above you can get into keynote and Ruby & Aerobus. I believe their is more structure in this end of the lake but I could be wrong. We have been from end to end of the whole system. Later, Jay"
