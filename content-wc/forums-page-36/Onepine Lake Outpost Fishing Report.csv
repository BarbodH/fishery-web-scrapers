It was great returning to Ontario after an-almost 3 year absence. I was worried about the border crossing, but it went much more smoothly than I anticipated. The only drawback was a nearly one-hour wait at the border (2:00 p.m., Friday, June 17). We flew in on Sunday, June 19. As you all know if you were up there, the temperatures were beyond warm. They were downright miserable. But we weren't there to sit in the cabin, so we set out for a brief 3-hour session, and the bite was on. But so was the heat, so we cleaned fish, sat on the deck, had a snack and plenty of water, and waited for the heat to subside a bit before going out again. That first fish fry was fantastic, not because of how great it tasted, but because it seemed to mark an end to the pandemic. The next day was a repeat of the previous one. Scorching heat, but excellent fishing. Frustrating in not being able to get as many hours on the lake as we would have liked, but the sun and heat forced us to be prudent. Finally, on day 3 the weather started to normalize, which meant rain, wind, and much more comfortable conditions. Again, the bite was on. The bigger walleye were surprisingly shallow, and there was a small island a few minutes from the cabin, where the walleye swam into view to inhale the jig and minnow, in 2-4 feet of water. One afternoon, my boat partner and I caught 90 walleye between us, fishing in rain and moderate winds, and that was probably was the highlight of the trip for me. Fished for 4-5 hours, and never saw a pike, only lost a very few jigs to snags. And the average-sized fish were in that sweet 18-21 inch range, with 8-9 in that 22-24"" range. That probably doesn't sound like anything to you guys who fish Lac Seul or Rainy Lake, but it was heaven to us. Days 4-5-6 were very comfortable, with the usual blend of Canadian weather found in late June. Great sleeping conditions, and the rain mostly fell at night, which was fine with us. This was our fourth trip to Onepine, and each year we feel more comfortable branching out from the cabin, and exploring the further reaches of the lake. Found some new rock piles and neck-down areas between points that were fabulous. However, when the wind died down, and the sun came out, the fishing was much tougher. Fished the portage lake, Strawberry Lake, and the fishing was fantastic. The walleye were surprisingly good-sized, and they were eager to chew. Catching 100 fish per boat in a few hours was pretty easy. All in all, a great, great trip. I've had trips where I caught a lot more fish, but this trip was special, because there were times when I wasn't sure if we were ever getting back to Nestor Falls. Looking forward to my second trip with Nestor Falls Outposts in August, back to my favorite lake, Larus. Hope you all have great trips coming up!"

That is heaven to any walleye fan regardless of the lake (IMO).."
6670132,Mojo-NC,2022-07-04 08:10:00,1929,"Sounds like a great trip. During our slowest year in Canada, I think I caught 58 walleyes over 6 days. We still had a great time. On other trips I've caught 80 fish in 4 hours. That was fun too, but the numbers are not what makes the trip for me. The challenge of catching fish during a slow bite is just as exciting to me. If I catch 10 fish a day in my home waters, it's a good day, so there is that. We're heading up to Lac Seul on Friday. It's the Canada experience that I'm looking forward to, regardless of the numbers. Tight lines!"
