6670848,hammerdown31,2022-07-06 06:57:00,12,Anyone have any reports on Savant Lake. Group of 4 will be arriving on July 16th. First trip to Canada for our group. Really looking forward to some great times. Thanks in advance for any info/advice.
6671002,HeHooksHimself,2022-07-06 17:31:00,725,"Went to Wildewood on Savant Lake last September and scheduled to go up again this September 2. Wildewood seems a little pricey when compared to other camps but their prices are all inclusive, minnows and gas for instance are part of the deal. Also, Andy took us out for a few hours and showed us how to fish deep for lakers and then let us use on of his poles for the rest of the week. The fishing was outstanding when we were there especially at the narrows. Every evening we could count on a walleye bonanza with countless fish at our disposal. This year we plan on venturing further out to experience the parts of the lake that we have yet to see. We purchased the upgrade option for boats which worked great for us. Of course, the experience in July might be significantly different but I am sure you will have a great time! Fish On! Hooks"
6671420,RichA$1970,2022-07-08 15:11:00,1159,Fully agree with He Hook Hooks Himself Too Much and it was a pleasure meeting him there last September. This is like an All Inclusive with the owners on site and visible daily taking care of you. Hope to go back this fall.
6671450,Pooch,2022-07-08 19:53:00,4618,"Not really like an all inclusive. It is a housekeeping only camp. Bring your own food and some personal supplies. Good camp, but think ""remote outpost"" in your planning. It was a flyin when I stated going there three owners ago in the early 1990's. Camp is well ran and fishing is stupid good if you have any Canadian fishing experience in you at all. If not, the learning curve is short! Have a good trip and report back to those of us who couldn't fit a trip in it this year. Pooch"
6671732,SterlingArcher,2022-07-10 18:19:00,92,"My group got back from Savant last Friday. One of the best years for numbers and size of walleyes in the 20 years I've been going up, and the lake trout and pike fishing were very good as well. Are you staying on the good part of Lake at Cat Track/Cliff and Romas or are you down at Wildewood?We caught walleyes everywhere from 6' to 35' depending on the part of the lake and weather conditions. We had a couple of glassy calm days where we had to fish deeper but they were still very productive.1/4oz glow white jig was the best producer, with parrot second best. We caught lakers at depths between 30' (saw them chasing herring on top of a hump and went up after them) and 70' but most hit in 45-55' of water. 3/4oz white Mission Tackle tube jig tipped with a sucker minnow. Biggest this trip was only 32"" but we got several nice ones.With the late ice out and high water weed growth is WAY BEHIND, so we caught most of our pike just in areas where there were lots of walleye. A gold 5"" Doctor Spoon was by far the hottest ticket. No megas, but all four of us filled out on pike to take home and caught a bunch of 28-35"" slot pike. Next year we're going to actually target big pike more.Let me know what other questions you have - happy to point you in the right direction if I can."

6671824,hammerdown31,2022-07-11 11:37:00,12,Thanks to all for the info. We are looking forward to a great week.
6671954,HeHooksHimself,2022-07-11 20:06:00,725,"Good to know, Arch. We are already booked this year and hope to make it further into the lake this year. Will let you know how we do. Hooks"
6671976,SterlingArcher,2022-07-11 22:12:00,92,It's such a fun lake to explore. We find great new areas every year!
6672020,HeHooksHimself,2022-07-12 06:46:00,725,"Pooch marked up a map for us but we did not even come close to all the areas he marked. Arch, if you want to PM me your favorite hot spot I would very much appreciate it"
