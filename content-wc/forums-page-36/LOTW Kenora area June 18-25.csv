Northern aggressive in new weeds on spoons, bucktails, spinnerbaits, jerkbaits. Catching nice walleyes in the weeds along with them with a lot of them hitting the booyah pikee spinnerbait. Caught most big walleyes trolling flicker minnows on rocky shorelines and islands. A bunch of nice walleyes in the 24 to 29 range and northerns in the 33 to 37 range. Did not fish for lakers this trip. Weed growth is behind. Water temp got up to 70 with hot days. Good luck with your trip. Love this area."
