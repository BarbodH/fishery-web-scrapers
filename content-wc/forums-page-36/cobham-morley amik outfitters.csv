6671894,kasmere,2022-07-11 16:51:00,20,Heading into the Cobham/Morley outpost 7/18 next week. Rena said the dock was still a bit under water. Anyone traveling on flyouts North of Red Lake would appreciate your input obn water levels. Are they getting closer to normal pool?
6671956,turkeyriver,2022-07-11 20:07:00,80,Been to the Cobham several times. Last time we were there the dock at Morley was out of the water a good 3-4 feet. We're going to Blackbirch with Amik next week too. Going to be interesting.
6672008,jnoelting,2022-07-12 06:17:00,6,Fished 6/8 - 6/13 with Amik at Loree Lake - dock was was partially under water when we arrived John had barrels of gas keeping it down and when we left the lake had dropped considerably so he could remove barrels. From what I have heard from others water levels keep dropping as all that water moves out - I wouldn't be too worried.
6672018,turkeyriver,2022-07-12 06:36:00,80,"Good to hear. Seems like on many docks at the outpost cabins, there's a low spot just as you get to shore. I could see that as a ""water over the dock"" issue that you need boots for two steps or you get wet feet. I'm sure it will be doable."
