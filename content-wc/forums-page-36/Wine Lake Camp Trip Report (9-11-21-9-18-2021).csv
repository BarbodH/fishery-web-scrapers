6598888,jsmyers,2021-09-22 18:48:00,198,"I'm going to post this in a few installments, it might take a few days as I collect pictures and my thoughts stay tuned! This was my second trip to Wine Lake Camp, the first being in September of 2016. Other recent trips include Wabaskang (Sleepy Dog Cabins in June 2019 and Peffleys in May 2011) and September 2019 in Quetico.Our planning went roughly like this:June 2021: Me and Dr./Mrs.: Where do you kids want to go now that COVID is looking to be behind us soon?Kids: Fishing in Canada!Me to self: YES! Me to cousin: We need to plan a 2022 trip to NW Ontario, what are you thinking?Cousin: Wine Lake Camp early in the season!Me to Nick (WLC Owner): What's your availability in May or June 2022?Nick: Booked Solid! Word that border might open up in August Me to Nick: What about September 2022?Nick: Lots of room, as long as the border opens up!Me to cousin and dad: How about this fall?Cousin: I can probably make that work.Dad: Sounds great! a few weeks pass, border announcement Me to cousin and dad: Can we book it?Dad: Yep!Cousin: Whoa this is moving really fast I'm not so sure I can make it.Me to many others: Interested?Others: Yes but, next time, etc Dad and I to each other: Let's go as a pair!Sister: Hey, I might be interested, lemme check a few things .yep, I'm coming too!Mom: Hey, if my hubby and both kids are going, I'm going too! then all of the gear, food, travel, and COVID logistics planning I live in Raleigh, NC and my sister and parents live in the Charleston, SC area. Thankfully we were able to lean on my cousin in MSP to receive dry goods and bins we shipped to him, simplifying our logistics. We flew to MSP late in afternoon on Thursday 9/9, picked up a rental truck and went over to my cousin's place to get our dry goods and have some dinner. (If you're in Saint Paul, I recommend Waldmann Brewery and Wurstery. After dinner, we loaded up the truck and checked into a hotel adjacent to I-35 on the north side of town. 9/10 was for driving and the border crossing. Everything went smoothly, with great weather and minimal lines in Ft. Frances. We arrived in Dryden around 4:30 pm, checked in to our hotel, hit the Safeway for meat and produce, and grabbed a filling meal at the Patricia Inn. Saturday 9/11 was a short drive up to Perrault Falls in the early morning and a pleasant boat ride across Wabaskang to the Falls. Then things got a bit interesting"
6598904,jsmyers,2021-09-22 19:22:00,198,"The night before, an intense line of storms rolled through, we were in the middle of cold front conditions: we had a stiff wind out of the NW. Heading across the Big Lake and Mean Lake on Wabaskang was a bit choppy, but WLC's new boat kept us all dry and comfortable. Adventure #1: Taking our loaded-down camp boats upstream on the Anishinabi River, which was about 3' low, below the normal levels that are as thin as ~3.5') and into a ~15 mph wind! NWO needs some rain and some deep snow. I honestly fear for the future of fisheries in the Canadian Shield with climate change. For those of you familiar with Wabaskang and Wine Lakes, check out the picture of the falls, you'll be shocked how lot the water is.With Nick and Rob's help, all eight camp guests make it through, but with a bit of difficulty. Our group of four shared Wine Lake Camp (WLC) with a solo fisherman from Kansas City and a group of three from AZ. Nick was excited to have some ladies in camp so late in the season. There was time for us to set up our cabin, our gear, have lunch, and get out on the water to wet a line around 2 pm.The stiff wind continued, but it was manageable. Surface water temps were around 64 degrees F. I tried to find some locations where an island created a current funnel and where wind hit weedbeds or rocky reefs adjacent to deep water. Primary target: northern pike!My sister caught the first fish. We found ourselves getting tired of the wind, and head over to a leeward bay (Dynamite Bay) with some good weeds. In a total of ~4 hours of fishing before dinner, we all caught three or more, including a walleye, at least one 25-30 pike, and maybe a bass. Not bad for the slightly adverse conditions while getting familiar with the lay of the lake. On the way home, I stop to check out something that catches my eye on the lake map and I put a mental pin in the stop to fish it later.Day 2 started with calm conditions at sunrise, but we don't get out until around 10 am after a hearty breakfast and a good night's sleep. The NNW wind picked up around that time. Another guest had told us that he placed a buoy on a hump which HeHooksHimself had already told me about. The other guest said he wouldn't be on the spot in the morning and invited us to try it. My dad wanted to target walleye, so I dropped him and my sister off there. My mom and I went to other side of the basin where we would try for lakers. Neither plan went well for us. My mom unfortunately(?), pulled a 22.5 walleye out of ~50 feet of water. It had some serious signs of barotrauma. Hopefully it was a nice meal for a large lake trout or pike. But no trout for us and the other boat couldn't stick to the bottom in the wind. We both shifted down to the southwest corner of the lake and caught a number of small pike along weedbeds along that shore. We'd also gotten word in camp that many pike were coming from an area around the narrows to another lake known as Turnaround Lake, including the three rocky points that stick out into the basin around that narrows. We fished all around and made first contact with a big girl on one of the points when I hook into a solid fish that immediately shook free. I few casts later, my mom gets her first pike over 30 inches with this great looking 32 incher on a Mepps #5 Aglia with a nickel blade and no hair. We head in for lunch, and I notice that the wind shifts from NNW to SW. Heading out after lunch, I figure that a couple of rocky points just one third mile from camp would be worth a look. In between the two points is a very shallow weedy shelf with a quick drop-off to 30+ feet, including a wide-enough section of weeds along the break in 8-10 feet. (The weed line on Wine seems to be 10-11, and sometimes 12 feet-deep when the lake is ~3 feet low. I suspect it is near 14-15 feet normally). We slay them, catching many ~24 pike including at least one double! Near the second point, and probably near a triple edge of shallow/deep and rock/weeds, my mom hooks into a big one (again on the Mepps #5).If you fish much for pike, you can tell by the way the line enters the water when you have a good one. There's a different cadence to the head shakes and the fish often starts moving deliberately to deep water. After an exciting battle, we net the 38.5 beauty. My mom topped my personal best pike that I caught on the north end of Wine Lake in the spring of 2011!"
6598916,HeHooksHimself,2021-09-22 20:20:00,725,"JSM, Love the detail and the story! I can hardly wait for the rest of the story. I can visualize every spot you are talking about. Hooks"
6598986,jsmyers,2021-09-23 06:51:00,198,"There was a steady night by night drop in water temperatures each day for most of the trip, so by day three, the surface was around 63 degrees. On 9/13, we didn't get an early start, and to switch things up, I share the boat with my sister. The plan is to check out Turnaround Lake. Normally at WLC, there are four lakes other than Wine that you can easily take your boat into, and the camp has cache/portage boats on another three lakes or so. Because of the extremely low water levels and the limited season, there is only one option other than Wine this year: Turnaround Lake. On the way south, we cast around a small rocky island at the entrance to Dynamite Bay and then try the points again around the entrance to Turnaround. We catch a few around the island and the wind is now out of the south, so the points are a bust for big fish. Getting into Turnaround was a lot easier than getting into camp two days earlier. We don't have much of a wind to fight, and our boat isn't loaded down with gear and food. My folks get hung up on a log early in the adventure, assume the whole thing will be as difficult, and decide it isn't worth it. It's a long weedy narrow area with roughly 1-2 feet water mostly. I notice that the temps there are in the high 50s and we see a lot of perch.After clearing the narrowest and shallowest, we hang around trying to catch a perch or small pike while we wait for our folks, and eventually decide that they gave up. Before we head back in, I want to check out a weedbed extending off of the main point in little Turnaround Lake. We catch a few, including a bass, but it isn't the great spot I was hoping for. However, I realize now that there may still be unexplored aspects of the spot. I focused on the tip of the point above water, but the deepest water in Turnaround is to the NW of the obvious point, and the rough depth map implies that there's a larger shelf between that deep water and where we fished. I'll have to try again next time. While we're back there, the wind shifts from SSW to SE-ish.We head back through the narrows and meet back up with the parents, who are drifting roughly parallel to the western shore outside of some reeds and rocks. My dad has been doing well on Z-mann StreakZ threaded on a swimbait jig, catching walleye, bass, and pike by drifting it near the bottom. His sonar is pretty lit up with fish in 10-20 feet of water. We join in, casting lures up to the shallower weeds and also fishing vertically. I catch a small walleye and a pike on a live minnow on a drop shot rig (a technique I learned from a guide in Lake Hartwell, SC targeting spotted and largemouth bass). Dad's got a nice stringer, so we head in to clean the fish and have dinner.After dinner, dad and I fish the northeast end of the lake. First, we toll deep cranks over the basin. I catch a ~20 walleye on a purpledescent Rapala Tail Dancer Deep 30. He's using a husky jerk deep but doesn't get a bite. We then motor over to some rocky points and islands where we used to have shore lunches when portaging over from Wabaskang. It's a little eerie to see my 8-year old self cleaning a pike on the rocks in my mind's eye.Our technique is mostly to cast various lures near shore for bass and pike. We catch fish, but it isn't fast and furious. We also head over to where the Anishinabi River flows into Wine Lake. In the evenings here in 2016, we caught a lot of walleyes slow rolling ratting lipless lures over the sand and around the weeds. We don't find any walleyes, but catch some pike, including my first bigger fish of the trip, a 34 northern that was hanging out in the sandbar in about a foot of water (or less) and fell for a 1 ¼ oz little cleo (nickel and orange).My mom and sister take the opportunity for an evening cruise, getting out to look for wildlife and enjoy the scenery.Starting off in the morning on 9/14, The plan is to stay near camp and put a few hours in, have an early lunch, and then go fishing with Nick in the afternoon. I kick things off with some basin trolling with my sister, this time we both have TDDs. I get a twin of the fish from the night before, not far off of a shoreline point. We find an offshore hump that we saw a boat on the afternoon before, and I save a waypoint so its easy to return. We turn our attention to pike and the weedbed we did so well on two days before. While we don't get big ones, the spot is consistent for me all trip long. Meanwhile, my parents are fishing the first bay SE from camp. My mom gets another 32 pike.Heading out with Nick around 1 pm, my sister and I hop into his flat-bottomed work boat, grab light rods with a jig and my parents follow in their boat. For most of you on Walleye Central, this is probably all pretty basic knowledge, but Nick shows us how he hooks a minnow (in mouth, out gill, through side, resting sideways and dead) and how he backtrolls, detects bites, and sets the hook.I'm surprised by a number of things:Using dead minnows or intentionally killing live onesThat at this time of year that a bite isn't a tap or a wiggle, but rather a slightly sticky sensation that is 95% indistinguishable from the bottom at first.That he moves the bait vertically as little as possible.Other aspects of this technique aren't new to me. For instance, I know how to control the boat by backtrolling, but it is helpful to have a live demonstration to get the finer details and to boost confidence. For instance, I'd never really known how to use a marker bouy to its full potential to create a frame of reference while you move the boat slowly. It takes us a while to finally hook up, but pretty soon my sister and I are right there with Nick pulling in fish after fish, many of them in the low to mid 20s. I think the biggest is mine at 25 but we generally don't count or measure. After a bit, we notice that parents are having a tougher time, even though they haven't been skunked. I feel like I've got the tools needed to pilot my own ship, so I switch boats with my dad to play guide. Later we joke that Nick was trying really hard to not let us see how many fish he was catching, quietly reeling them in and unhooking them behind his back. We try a number of spots, generally finding fish around 30-32' on that day, but sometimes as shallow as 25 feet. One of the spots is the same hump I mentioned on day 2. At one point, we can see rain to our SW and N, but keep on fishing. Nick thinks we'll only get a couple of drips, but he says, I'm often wrong about these things. He's right about being wrong. We get hammered by a short, but intense rain cell. It clears up and we dry off. I goof up and mistakenly think my rain gear is back at the dock in a dry bag in my boat, so I'm extra soaked. Its quite a successful couple of days for us. We starting to feel like walleye fisherman and not just pike fishermen who sometimes catch walleye."

6600008,jsmyers,2021-09-28 12:54:00,198,"I started a journal right after my June 2019 trip, but went right from catching up from the trip to planning a September trip, and lost enough memory to put in the details that would matter most.This time, I started the evening of day 1, but quickly found that eat, fish, sleep, euchre -> repeat didn't leave much time. On the last night, I started putting what happened when stuff on a piece of scrap paper. I finished that on highway 105 on the way home. I made it a priority to write things down as soon as I could afterward. I got a lot written on my flight home.For me, I want to record something about the weather and water temps, but most importantly, the details of the spot on the spot, when that exists. I don't fish these lakes enough to know them like the back of my hand, but you learn a lot in a week. My hope is that I can build more effectively on my last trips for my next trips. I think it will also help me to identify good new spots in the future.Next time, I'm going to mark every day a few key details like wind, water temp, and memory prompting notes, the day of, realizing that I won't usually have time to put the details in until the trip is done.The attachment is a couple of pages from this trip in that journal."

6599920,jsmyers,2021-09-28 07:03:00,198,"On day 5 (9/15), dad and I head out at sunrise to fish near camp. It's a still, foggy, and beautiful morning. We head to the hump I'd marked the day before in my GPS, this time armed with our newfound walleye fishing education. We catch twin 21.5 walleyes before breakfast. Its hard to fish, land fish, unhook fish (especially northerns), control the boat, and take video at the same time, so I haven't used my video camera as much as I'd hoped during the trip, but do get a good release video of my walleye. The attached pic is cropped from it. After breakfast, we pack lunches, with a plan to head south to parts of the lake I never visited in previous trips. There is a sizeable island in the middle of a deep basin area southeast of the entrance to Turnaround Lake. I'm wondering if there are some good rocky shelves or trees in the water around it. I'm partly hoping to find some bass, but also find that pike hunt around rocks and wood just as much. It turns out this island generally drops quickly into 30+ feet of water. Most of the rock is slab bedrock, rather than the productive boulders I'm looking for. We catch a bass or two around the island (maybe a pike too). The fish themselves weren't too memorable, but I do remember how I caught one of the bass. In one spot, right up against shore, there is a rock shelf with perhaps 6 or less of water on top of a large flat stone and a drop like a little cliff to at least 5 feet. The rock itself looks like an undercut bank or a roof over a drive-in restaurant for a bass. I cast a jig up on the shallow shelf, wiggle it slowly to the edge and watch it drop. A second after I resumed the retrieve, I had a smallmouth on the line. Just like I planned! We then go an exposed rock reef along the east shore. I was told that it was the previous camp owner's (Herb) favorite walleye spot. My mom and I cast all kinds of artificials for pike and bass. While we don't get skunked, we catch more rock than fish. I include a black marabou hair jig in my arsenal. I did well with similar jigs in June of 2019 for smallmouth on Wabaskang. It doesn't work the same in fall. The numbers of bass are probably deeper, and while we catch a few up shallower on lures as large as a 285 Doctor Spoon, we didn't catch a huge number of bass nor any real monsters on this trip. We have sandwich shore lunch on a small sandy beach just north of Herb's rock. I tell them that I want to go north to the next point, that looks like it's got a lot of good rocks on it, and perhaps weeds too. The wind is blowing consistently from the SSW, so the point should be good now. Launching from the beach, mom and I start fishing in that direction. My sister cranks up her boat and zooms herself and dad south. I realize they aren't coming back, so after a minute, we rev up and go see what's up. They're off a large point on the lee side of the lake, they're seeing fish on the sonar, and my dad has already caught a walleye, so we decide to join them.We don't get anything and before long, the wind has pushed us out to lake trout country. I'm seeing fish on the sonar, so out come the big paddle tail jigs as we drift north across the basin. A while later the solo camp guest (who's been within sight most of this timeusually trolling for trout) is landing a trout a few hundred yards downwind. I remember the tips he gave me earlier and put on three-way rigs and proceed to troll for the next hour or so. We zig-wag all the way to the north side of the island and then back until we meet up with my sister and father who by then had drifted out similarly and were excited by the numbers of fish they were seeing below the thermocline. No trout, burbot, or whitefish for us. I later find out that I missed an important tip:I'd gotten the speed right, keeping consistently close to 1.3 mph by trolling either into or with the wind at an angle and using the tiller angle to control speed more than the throttle and shifter.The other guest told me to ignore marks that were suspended high in the water column (near 40 feet deep) because they never bite.This second attempt I had enough lead on to get deep. (I think we had 7 oz). In attempt one, we were probably pulling up around 45 feet or so when moving. This time, we were bouncing along on the bottom the entire time. But what I didn't get was that he'd been getting fish about 10 to 15 feet off the bottom. We probably didn't have much of a shot of getting a hit within five feet of it. After reunited the group, I convince everybody to go over to the point that was my original post-lunch target. It's got a lot of weeds just out from a pair of rocky outcroppings. In between is a tiny shallow bay. I clean up, catching pike after pike, with an eater walleye thrown in as a bonus. This little guy attacked a large bucktail which is a mismatch of a tail from a Mepps Musky Maribou and a body from an Aglia Magnum (#7 blades). In retrospect, I may have caught some big ones if I'd found the drop to deeper water and focused there.I also tried a chatterbait for the first time and discover the newest addition to my list of favorite pike lures. My chatterbait was (day 7 story) white with a silver blade and a bit of chartreuse in the skirt. I've added a 3-4 chartreuse paddle tail. I love these things! I wish I hadn't waited until day 5 to try it out.It's different than the silver Mepps that does so well but has many of the same elements. It's kinds like a spinner crossed with a rattling lipless crankbait with a swimbait attached.It fishes relatively deep.It has action on the drop and the horizontal retrieve.It can be retrieved slow.It's a single hook and more weedless than many options.I believe that pike need vibration more than flash, but it's got both it feels like you're pulling a beehive through the water and the blade shines like a spinner.It's got wiggle.It doesn't spin around, so I don't need a swivel, keeping the terminal tackle low-profile. I forget which day it was, but one evening I catch pike on consecutive casts with it when we're otherwise not getting much action. I'm in a spot where there are about 3-4 feet of weeds on the bottom in about 10 feet of water, leaving roughly 6 feet of open water above. I cast it out, count to six, and give it a hard pull to get the blade buzzing and get an instant strike. It's like  three, four, (take up slack) five, six, pull, buzzzz-bam! After releasing, I do it again, but the second time, my pull to start the lure is a hookset. The fish hit on the fall, no buzz, right to bam! For some reason, nobody else is getting bit by the rocky and weedy point. My mom had a slow day all day; our wild trout chase didn't help the level of action. My sister is captaining her boat, taking a break from fishing, and my dad is jigging in slightly deeper water and is getting frustrated with all of the fish on the sonar that won't bite. As much as I'd like to keep catching a pike every few casts, it feels a bit selfish to continue like this when dinner and euchre are beckoning."
