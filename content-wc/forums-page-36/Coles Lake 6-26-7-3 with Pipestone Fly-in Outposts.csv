We caught fish everywhere on everything (including a bare jig)! We had worms, minnows, and leeches and all worked equally well. The fish were moving around quite a bit, you might catch 50 in a spot and come back to it and they had moved so there was some traveling around the lake to stay with schools of fish. We used jigs with or without plastic and some type of meat. Fished some slip bobbers and it was non-stop catching of walleye and perch. Also did well trolling gold jerk baits for walleye. We caught a few pike put didn't really fish them much because the walleye fishing was so good. PFO was good to work with on the planning, rescheduling, and such. We cooked a lot of fish, the walleye wings were excellent, and we ended up making a walleye chowder that turned out fantastic. Lots of rest and relaxation for the group, the weather was amazing (considering how hot is was in Georgia when we left and returned), lows in the low 40's and highs in the mid 60's. The biggest hassle we had was with commercial airlines (Delta) who changed our flights and we missed our connection to IFalls. Delta was absolutely no help, basically said we will get you on a flight then next day but that would have meant we missed our fly out. We tried to find a rental car but there were not available and finally found a shuttle who took us from Minneapolis to IFalls for $625 (4 guys). Our outfitter offered to drive 7 hours one way to get us and drive us to the airbase if we couldn't get it worked out. Overall, one of the best trips we've had on a fly in and definitely the best fishing we have ever had. https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/202...a3941d06a7.jpghttps://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/202...c8add48146.jpghttps://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/202...eb62a5255e.jpghttps://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/202...1967889d1e.jpghttps://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/202...71871a92bb.jpghttps://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/202...e472a03dc0.jpghttps://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/202...16e3cf2e8d.jpgSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"

Garnish with parsley or small chunks of fishsprinkled with paprika. I tripled the recipe, and added a couple of chopped carrots for some color. We didnt have fish base, so I saved 4 backbones/rib sections after we fileted our fish and put in with some vegetable scraps (bell pepper top, tomato core, onion core) and boiled until it reduced by 2/3 then strained into a cup using a coffee filter and ended up with 1/4-1/2 cup of stock. I also used black pepper instead of white pepper, and left out the paprika (we didn't have it in the cabin). This was very easy to make and turned out great."

6670866,stjoeguy,2022-07-06 08:28:00,979,The chowder sounds great. Thanks for the recipe.
6670872,Cgillespie,2022-07-06 08:38:00,120,I gotta try that recipe. It's been miserable hot since we got back to Arkansas. It makes me wonder if a small summer place up there might be worth it.
6670880,Camoclad,2022-07-06 09:08:00,628,Exactly what I told my wife when I got back home. I almost suffocated walking out of the Atlanta airport. Bless the airport lawmen wearing body armor and having to stand out in that heat! Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
