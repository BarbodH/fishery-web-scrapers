6668386,Murph97SxS,2022-06-27 14:06:00,6,It went really well 450 over the week. Atleast 20 over the 23” mark. 2 27” and 1 30” I can give some more detail later on. Just at work at the moment
6670802,calvinvee,2022-07-05 21:49:00,2,Good to hear that it went well! My son and I are going later this month. I was hoping it was a decent lake.
6651662,Murph97SxS,2022-04-27 20:01:00,6,"Hello Folks,First time doing a fly-in ever have decided on white river air. I had limited dates I could get off work. And one of the only lakes available for those dates was Cornish Lake. I have scoured the forums for any mentions of Cornish Lake. Has anyone fished it before or any discussion on white river air in general. Thanks"
6651810,Fishquest,2022-04-28 08:04:00,89,I've never seen any info on the lake either but I checked it out on their website and on satellite maps and it looks like a typical Ontario fly in lake. Rocky and weedy should be easy enough to find fish with the usualy tactics. Please post a report when you return and some pics would be awesome to hear how you made out.
6651824,vteye3,2022-04-28 08:50:00,496,Murph post the dates of when you are going. This site is happy to provide tactics and will be fairly accurate. Ontario is beautiful and absolutely sure you will have a great time.
6651840,Murph97SxS,2022-04-28 09:07:00,6,We Will be going Mid June. I appreciate it. I actually do live in Ontario and fish northern Ontario ( for me that’s north of North Bay) and northern Quebec fairly often so I do know the tactics. Was more so just looking for info on experiences people have had with Cornish lake was curious because I hadn’t seen anything and I’m being over excited. I will definetly keep the thread updated after my trip
6651842,Murph97SxS,2022-04-28 09:08:00,6,"Yes Me to! I’ve stared at the satellite of it extensively. Just over excited and was super curious because I swear I’ve heard every other lake through White River Air mentioned, just not Cornish. I will definetly keep the thread updated!"
6651894,Spartan1,2022-04-28 11:32:00,46,Although my group has never fished Cornish Lake we have used White River Air and they are a top notch outfitter! You made the right choice. Cabins are very nice and the equipment is well maintained. Their pilots are very helpful and friendly. Have a great time!!!
6651898,Murph97SxS,2022-04-28 11:36:00,6,Thanks really appreciate it!! What lake does your group normally go to?
6653434,Spartan1,2022-05-03 13:24:00,46,"We visited Garnham Lake in August, 2019. A very nice cabin, even had an indoor toilet! A very nice facility. Fishing was very good, I would not call it GREAT fishing but no one ever had a problem limiting out every time we hit the water. The walleye were very nice size. Lots of good structure to explore and fish."
6653520,Murph97SxS,2022-05-03 18:12:00,6,That’s awesome! We will normally target walleye in the evenings. Looking to target some larger pike during the day. Hoping it’s not a lot of smaller pike which the place we normally go to has a lot of.
6653530,Eckohlt,2022-05-03 18:30:00,3685,"I'm thinking there's small pike in every lake,big arse pike make little pike,you know,,,the ones that bite your lure off."
