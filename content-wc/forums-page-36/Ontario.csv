6670816,prov1800,2022-07-06 04:27:00,5010,Someone asks a question about fishing and I answer with a comment i I actually know something about.I have fished a number of there lakes with my wife and guests. Wayne and Karla are my personal friends and run a great show.
6670818,Juls,2022-07-06 04:42:00,13414,"I'm only leaving this rude comment, because he responded to you. Don't be ""that guy""...keep it civil, or don't comment at all. Thanks"
6668002,Hookhunter135,2022-06-26 12:19:00,129,I appreciate everyone’s responses. I am open to investigating any outfitter that would possibly give us what we are looking for. We can always discuss increasing our budget for right place. One place I am looking at is the Attawapaskit river system. There seems to be some quality fishing in that area.
6668012,CincyPike,2022-06-26 12:43:00,9,Check out Dunlop lodge in Manitoba. Great value and lots of trophy pike. I've fished both outpost and both great. I prefer Pelletier because it's a bigger lake and they have a good package that is included in the price. It is a haul though.
6668032,CincyPike,2022-06-26 13:51:00,9,Food package sorry.
6668082,Bill Krejca,2022-06-26 16:37:00,6107,"In Manitoba, Reed Lake is known for big fish. I have been to Tramping Lake, which is ne of Reed a few miles, a fellow trolling big baits there got, I believe, 5 Master Angler fish in one day; our party, fishing walleye got a very large one on several trips. Bill"
6668134,SweetD,2022-06-26 19:42:00,243,Regarding Attiwipaskat we went to Beteau Lake on that system and while I was critical of the previous outfitter I know it holds trophy potential and lots of them if you can sneak into one of those early weeks after ice out. Having since talked with the new owner of Graywood Outfitters I’m confident they have resolved many of the travel/camp related issues. It is a beautiful and rugged lake with tons of water to fish. As I get older Pike become less and less interesting to me (lots of work slinging big baits) but if affordability and big Pike are what you are after with really good Walleye fishing (I caught my only 30” fish there in my over 30 years of fishing North of the border) then Beteau and Graywood might just be a good fit. As many have said for consistent (the key here is consistent) big Pike action gonna spend more than $2000. I believe Beteau is still below that mark.Good luck
6668250,adempsey2.0,2022-06-27 08:12:00,611,"Time of year is probably the most important factor for targeting trophy pike. I prefer 2 to 3 weeks after ice out, but right after ice out can be good too it just depends on the weather.If you want to stick closer to PA, I would look into Bushland Adventures Lac Evans outpost in QC. Although, the website is currently down so I do not know what the status of that outfitter is. Hearst Air also some options. Although, I am not sure if they are still operating their camps on the Attawapiskat. I did fish Napken and we caught some nice trophy fish, but it wasn't 10 trophies per day. Interesting body of water nonetheless.A bit further west from PA, but North Caribou Lake out of Armstrong/Pickle Lake can be really good. Lots of varied structure, but it is a fairly large lake so you need to know/find where the pike are in the spring. That goes for any large lake. They are often concentrated in a few areas of the lake and probably where you least expect them to be. As mentioned, I agree that the camps operated by Graywood Outfitters out of Nakina may be good choices as well. Slate Falls Outposts out of Sioux Lookout is another. It starts to come down to travel logistics and whether trying to find somewhere in western Ontario is worth it vs. going to SK or MB or even AK."
6670574,Sylvanboat,2022-07-05 10:12:00,94,"The best northern fishing I ever experienced was at Lac LaMartre in NW Territories. Very pricey but you will be pulling your baits away fron 15 lb fish since you won't want to take the time to remove the hook. If you want big northern, this is without question the place to go."
6670670,LoDo,2022-07-05 14:00:00,721,"Check out Jan Lake Lodge on Jan Lake. Excellent cabins, huge fish, etc... Ive been twice and need to get there one more time in my life. Incredible!!"
6670680,walleyecheek,2022-07-05 14:37:00,2231,It's definitely cheaper !
6670696,jackpotjohnny48,2022-07-05 15:38:00,153,"I've done some fly-ins for muskies, but never for pike, so my input will not be based upon any first hand experience with a fly-in pike lake. Having said that, I do seem to recall that somebody here on this forum mentioned that they had done fairly well for large pike going with White River Air, located in White River, Ontario. I've watched a few of the White River pike fishing videos on YouTube, and I'll link one of them below. A YouTube fisherman by the name of Rod Young seems to post quite a few pike videos from White River. I've watched a few of them, and checked out the White River website. Prices seemed to be very reasonable, if I remember correctly. But, as mentioned, I don't have any first hand experience with this outfitter. Here's a link to one of Rod Young's pike videos (he has quite a few pike videos on YouTube). Hope this helps, ""Jackpot"" John Schroederhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXs5XD45Z7M"
6667876,Hookhunter135,2022-06-26 06:38:00,129,"I know this has been covered a lot in various threads and I have looked over them. The research is endless. Looking for specific recommendations for a quality Fly in Trip for my Dad, Brother, Good Friend and I. We are looking for a place to catch quality Northern Pike. We have been doing fly in trips on the Gouin Res for the past 7 years minus Covid. It’s a great fishery but we would like the chance to catch larger pike more consistently. We prefer remote outposts that don’t have multiple cabins on the same lake. We are not concerned about amenities we are used to rustic camping. We bring our own food and beer and enjoy the week together in solitude. Price point we would like 1500-2000 USD per person. We live in PA we have been looking mostly in Ontario but are open to other suggestions if the camp fits what we are looking for."
6667880,That Minnesota guy,2022-06-26 06:53:00,8293,Send a message to Mike Borger here on this site. Better be very clear on what you consider primitive and acceptable.
6667896,pjshorthorn,2022-06-26 08:03:00,5654,Send a PM to Golden Eagle on here. He fishes pike primarily and has a place he has been going to for many years. I think it is north of Red Lake Ontario. PjShorthorn
6667898,prov1800,2022-06-26 08:07:00,5010,So not many people looking for pike trips as its mostly all other species you hear about.All I can contribute is places I've had chances to go.Fly out wise I get chances to fly in to a few of Clarks outposts.Lots of big pike on any of there lakes.My favorite pike lake woukd be there Anishinabi Lake Lodge.Quite place with only 4 cabins on the island or tgere Williams Narrows cabin which sits on otger end of lake on its own.Lake produces good pike.Will have to work throufh a lot of small /med pike to get a big one.Spring colder water or fall time being best.Check them out.www.clarksresorts.com
6667908,Lmbkiller,2022-06-26 08:20:00,639,Northern Manitoba sask or nw territories for big and many pike. Won't be cheap though
6667932,phishfearme,2022-06-26 08:53:00,1242,"from a fellow PA guy, you will need to drive - a bit more than to the Gouin but worth it - a great option would be Kearns Lake with Thousand Lakes where you would need to drive to Armstrong - see our three trips there:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...ht=kearns+lakehttps://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...ghlight=kearnshttps://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...ghlight=kearns you could also drive further west for many other great options. phish"
6667980,SterlingArcher,2022-06-26 11:14:00,92,If you want big pike and lots of em I'd look at Saskatchewan.

6668000,NM_Trout,2022-06-26 12:09:00,1094,Following this.I think $2k might be a bit on the lite side for where you might need to go for consistent and large northerns. If this exists for that price point I am interested :-)
