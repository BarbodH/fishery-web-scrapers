6668706,valley366,2022-06-28 15:21:00,193,Had a conversation with an outfitter recently. He was placed in a position of holding reservations for people that were hoping the policy would change. He ended up with empty cabins when they cancelled at the last minute. I told him he should take their deposits and thank them. If they want a reservation in the future to send their deposits but that is the policy.

Right or wrong there will be some in a group that won't get jabbed, and when one or two out of 5 man group can't go, the whole trip tends to fall apart. No different than when Canada started denying entry to people with DUI's. Almost every group of guys that had been going to the same place in Canada for years had one or two with a DUI on the record, and lots of those trips ended because part of the group wasn't welcome in Canada. Canadian tourism industry put pressure on Canadian customs to ease up on the DUI ban because of it."

6669018,C182P,2022-06-29 16:00:00,59,"I have a couple of friends that operate outfitting businesses in Ontario -one has been at it for over 30 years. pretty big fly in operation. When the DUI thing came along they lost close to 20% of their business. Groups quit going for various reasons once one or two of the regulars drop out, be it from death, DUI, old age, whatever. They have seen a fair number of groups not coming back this year due to some in the group not being vaccinated. When Bill the guy that has always put the trip together, bought the groceries, etc is no longer going because of (old age, DUI, non-vaccination, etc), many times no one else steps in to fill his shoes and the group trip is over. I'm not saying Canada needs to change the COVID policy, just saying it will have a negative effect on tourism. Unfortunately in todays world of instant gratification, not that many young people willing to take the place of a drop out member. General lack of interest in outdoors. That's an even bigger problem facing the fishing and hunting tourism industry."

6668344,stumcfar,2022-06-27 12:51:00,451,"The only issue on our June 1st crossing with shots, was one of our guys was part of a test group in June of 2020 and he had received his first 2 shots in less than 21 days. Our crossing agent said if he hadn't received a booster, he wouldn't be allowed in."

We spoke to our houseboat outfitter and he indicated that lodges across the board in Ontario are losing about 25% of their booked reservations because guys had booked reservations expecting the restrictions to be lifted by the time they would actually go. It worked out in our favor because another group our same week had to cancel for that reason. We ended up being able to get an upgrade boat that was unavailable when we initially booked our trip. I guess the planning leader of that specific group was pretty upset with those guys because they had put down their deposits a year ago. When it came time to collect the remainder of their money, that's when he found out they weren't vaccinated and had to cancel. Those experiences could have a severe and permanent negative effect on groups. Our outfitter didn't know if that particular group would ever go up to Canada together again because of the actions of those guys. Something to think about..."
