6671090,tv4fish,2022-07-07 05:28:00,2694,"My (Our) experiences regarding the mayfly hatch is that IF you are fishing when the hatch starts - you can use almost anything and the walleyes will hit it - after a few days of the hatch, the walleyes seem to get a little fussier - I'm sure it is because they are getting full stomachs......."
6671186,SweetD,2022-07-07 13:06:00,243,That makes sense TVFish. I waa thinking if they fill up on mayflies would kill the fishing at some point. Hopefully we hit it next week when they are just starting to hatch so it is the fish feeding frenzy previously described!!!
6671194,Eckohlt,2022-07-07 14:10:00,3685,Should be done soon.
6671198,Golden Eagle,2022-07-07 14:25:00,2642,"Pike find whitefish and walleyes that are feeding on mayflies. Pike load up on whitefish & walleyes, eating so much that they end up hugging the bottom, belching and off their feed for a few days. You might catch a couple with blood suckers attched to their bellies."
