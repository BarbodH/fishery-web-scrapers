Yesterday, I read an article (which I haven't been able to relocate) that the probability of being selected is based on a ""statistical algorithm"" apparently based on data gleaned from your ArriveCan info. My assumption is that if the algorithm judges you to be at high risk, you are more likely to get the dread blue box."

6671682,C182P,2022-07-10 09:33:00,59,"Not sure if I buy that algorithm for high risk and low vac areas story. My dad was randomed in February, double poked and once boosted (boosted 4 weeks prior to crossing), lives 50 miles south of Canadian border in MN, and MN has a fairly high vac rate. Took 21 days to get the results back also. We had already gone back for another trip to Canada before he had the results from the random. The random can be a big hassle and cause a significant delay in travel plans if you're the unlucky recipient. Canada can certainly do what it wants, but my opinion is its long past the time to get over it already. There are vaccinated people that aren't traveling north because of the hassle of the random - and knowing they lack the tech ability to get through a random. It certainly isn't helping the Canadian tourism industry that is already on its heels."

I don't know if multiple occupancy of the vehicle makes any difference or not. Just hope for the best! (no blue boxes). BTW, good luck at LOTW/Morson.

Today, the Government of Canada announced it is extending current border measures for travellers entering Canada. Requirements for travellers arriving to Canada are expected to remain in effect until at least September 30, 2022. In addition, the pause of mandatory random testing will continue at all airports until mid-July, for travellers who qualify as fully vaccinated. The pause was put in place on June 11, 2022, and is allowing airports to focus on streamlining their operations, while the Government of Canada moves forward with its planned move of COVID-19 testing for air travellers outside of airports to select test provider stores, pharmacies, or by virtual appointment. Mandatory random testing continues at land border points of entry, with no changes. Travellers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated, unless exempt, will continue to test on Day 1 and Day 8 of their 14-day quarantine."

6668474,N_of_Quibell,2022-06-27 20:33:00,151,"This is probably more detail than anyone wants, but since I don't have a phone with internet capability, I was curious: https://switchhealth.ca/en/individua...ts/covid-test/ According to Switch Health, who administers the random test program, a laptop with Chrome browser should work. Tbaytel is numerous free WIFI hotspots in towns such as Fort Frances where I cross, my plan was if I was so unlucky to get the blue box was/is to find one of the WIFI hotspots and fire up the laptop. Any reasons this isn't likely to work?"
6668516,glncanada99,2022-06-28 04:42:00,13,"So here is a question and by no means trying to buck the Canadian border rules on Covid. Lets say you say the heck with it and decide to not do the Rapid test. You go on your way, enjoy your trip and return home. Are their any consequences to not taking the test? Just wandering"

6668648,N_of_Quibell,2022-06-28 12:26:00,151,"I believe the ""video chat"" thing is Switch Health's ASMO portal, which they describe at:https://switchhealth.ca/en/individua...ts/covid-test/ They describe in detail how to access the portal and the computer/phone requirements. It might be worth registering and establishing an account beforehand to minimize surprises at the border."

6668916,Hwy101,2022-06-29 09:44:00,18,"Thanks N_of_Q. That was the last bit of information we needed. I still hope we don't get flagged for testing, but we will be ready."
6668928,C182P,2022-06-29 10:48:00,59,"Crossed several times through Fort Francis this winter, and 2 of the 3 we had at least one in our party get the random. With a tech savy young adult it took about 45 minutes each time. We had set up accounts with Switch Health in advance so that part of the testing was already in place to save time doing that over the phone. Just spoke with a friend that crossed 2 weeks ago in the Fort. They got handed the random. He said the procedure has completely changed from when he had got randomed this winter. No longer through switch health, I think he said it was through LifeLab. He said it was horrible, and took them almost 4 hours to complete the test. Part of the process involved waiting for a call back from Lifelab? and that was a 2 hour plus wait for that call. So it sounds like if you had previously set up an account through Switch Health to expedite the process if you got the random, that account with Switchhealth is no longer valid. Maybe Canada has gone to a different testing company? Of maybe they are using 2 different testing companies now? Its all a bad joke. Doesn't exactly make you feel welcome and can definitely impact travel plans. Let's hope at some point Canada just moves on with life with Covid in it. I don't know that testing for Covid does anything more than testing for athletes foot would at this point. Its everywhere. Just deal with it."
6668938,rpbadger,2022-06-29 11:30:00,22,"Expect changes today! As of June 30, the temporary restriction on random testing at airports expires. I would not expect Trudeau to reinstate the random testing at airports. I expect he will eliminate it and eliminate the random testing for land crossings. Stay tuned."
6665654,farmnfish,2022-06-18 16:11:00,130,What is the point of a random test the results of won't be know till long after it would do any good?
6665658,MikeF,2022-06-18 16:37:00,895,Tracking case numbers?
6665696,Old Timer,2022-06-18 23:44:00,255,"Mike is right. Canada wants a statistically valid figure for the number of Covid-positive travelers entering their country. Pooch: On the ArriveCan link I briefly addressed the random-testing procedure. The key issue is whether you're going someplace where you will have cell service for the health official to monitor the zoom test. If your lodge has service you can take your test there. Or maybe you have a layover in a motel that has cell service and you can take the test there. But let's say you're crossing at IF around noon and have a fly-out with Rusty scheduled for 2 or 3 pm that same day. Generally, remote cabins don't have cell service so you'll have to take the zoom test before you fly-out. That means you wait your turn someplace in your car close to border where your phone still has service. Maybe you miss your fly out or maybe you don't. Same deal if you're planning to boat in that same afternoon to a remote cabin on Rainy or LOTW. Last August we missed our bait pick-up and lift to a remote lodge because we sat in the car 3 hours waiting our turn for the test. That was a bad experience. So what I learned is to afford yourself enough time to take the zoom test (if you're tagged) before you're scheduled for something else like a fly-out or boat out. The random test can be a minor pain or a big pain. It all depends on your schedule and having adequate cell service to take the zoom-monitored test. How quickly your turn comes up once you dial in is dependent upon how many other travelers are ahead of you on the cue."
6665760,N_of_Quibell,2022-06-19 13:03:00,151,"In their words: ""Mandatory random testing is part of the Government of Canada surveillance program to track the importation of COVID-19 virus into Canada, and identify new variants of concern."" I don't think the primary goal here is individual case management - they are looking for leading indicators of issues down the road."
6668238,hoppy63,2022-06-27 07:38:00,367,"We crossed at the Soo on June 9. My partner received a random (I'm not sure what kind). The border agent said it had to be completed within 24 hours and to call the number on the box. I asked the agent a question about it and he replied ""call the number on the box"". We'll we just got out of there and drove to a spot to park and look into it. It was a zoom test and there was no number that we found on the box. After opening it up there was a number (or 2) to call and set up an appointment. We crossed at 4am by the way. I called a number that I wasn't even sure was correct and waited on hold for 45 minutes with no answer. I called the outfitter to see if they had advice and was told instructions should walk us through. After several more hours of calling (on hold) and looking on line for info with no luck, I called outfitter back and she had found info for us. After listening and it not making much sense I told her what test we had and she said she didn't know they were handing these types out at border and that she couldn't believe it and they should not be but regardless they are and did. She knew nothing about this one and said to just keep traveling and we would take care of it when we got there so we did. She said they wouldn't even have results before we were home. After getting to Nakina we went straight to her and I had figured out enough to know I had to schedule appointment on line (after registering) which was no easy task for someone as computer skilled (or lacking) as myself but she went through it with us and the first appointment available was 3 days later. How does one complete test within 24 hours if you can't schedule appointment? Fortunately lodge had wifi so we scheduled for 8:30 on the 13th. As it turns ed out my partner had medical issue and spent the week in Thunder bay hospital and test was never taken. That's just my experience. I have read where several people have gotten the random and had it taken care of in an hour or so. I'd like to know how and what needs to be done to do this for future reference. I wonder if a thread (sticky?) could be posted here with step by step instructions to complete any different type of test that might be given so dummies like myself can more easily get through this without the added stress of worrying about not getting it completed and then the thought you might be denied access crossing border for this reason on a future trip?I'd like to hear any stories or info anyone wishes to share."
6668262,Old Timer,2022-06-27 08:50:00,255,"Hoppy: Do a search on my handle and you find that I have addressed the random test several times before. Like I've said, it can be a minor inconvenience or a big pain. And we know what it was for you. And on one trip it was for me as well. In short, don't look for help from the customs agent. They hand out the box, tell you the instructions are included with the test and to move on. Unless you or somebody in your party is tech savvy you'll probably have problems taking the test. Just the way it is. That's why I have said I'd rather Canada keep the 72 hour pre-test and discard the random test. But that isn't going to happen. Many of my older vaxed friends are foregoing their Canada trips because of the random risk and not being zoom literate."
6668268,Knutson21,2022-06-27 09:07:00,348,"We Crossed border at International Falls 3:30AM Friday June 17th. Just myself and 10 year old son. We handed the customs agent our passports, she scanned them and said you filled out the Arrivecan App properly, asked the standard, Where, how long, reason, bait, food, weapons, questions. Then asked for a letter from my wife that I was allowed to take my son across the boarder, pulled that from the visor and handed it to her. She read it and said have a good trip. Maybe there 2 minutes total. At that time I was the only car and boat at the boarder. No Random Test. My son had to do the random test last September because he was unvaccinated at that time. On the way home, 11:00 AM Friday June 24th 19 Minute wait, others in our group were about 1/2 hour behind us and they waited about 50 minutes. Again once at agent he asked a couple of questions, and off we went. He did ask in a firm way for me to put the vehicle in park."
6668316,pete kraft,2022-06-27 11:22:00,28,"So, a person conducts the random test through the zoom app?"
6668328,stjoeguy,2022-06-27 12:15:00,979,"The test is not done using the Zoom app. It's a video phone connection, but not Zoom. I did the test twice last fall. The key is that you need a good phone connection where you can access the internet. It's tough to do sitting in a truck. There's just too much stuff to lose or drop. In Fort Frances we sat in a restaurant and in Rainy River we found a Senior Centre with tables and a good internet connection. Both Rainy River and Fort Frances had Purolator boxes where we could drop off the boxes. Here's a video showing the process. I recall another seal that needed to be applied someplace that's not mentioned in this video. Basically you just need time, space and a good internet connection. Then just wait and follow directions.https://switchhealth.ca/en/individua...id-test/#video"
6668354,Old Timer,2022-06-27 13:24:00,255,"St. Joe is right. It isn't a Zoom call, but rather a video conference via a phone connection. My bad for calling it Zoom. We were given random test kits at Rainy River and then at Emerson. Both times we did the testing in a vehicle. At RR we conducted four tests and it was a bit of a circus in the van to put it kindly. Fortunately. I had travelers who were half my age and who could drive the video-testing procedure far better than I could. As St. Joe said, you need a good phone connection with internet capabilities. We did the testing close to the customs stations."
