I am thinking about 2 week of September. How is the bite compared to the rest of the summer? Worth going, or is it close to turnover that early up north? Also, any resort recomendations would be nice. I have read the archives twice, and my head is spinning with all the different choices. Looking for a cabin for two guys, bringing my own boat and food. Thanks. <{{}}><"

I would go first week in Sept but can't get desired cabin . I've been thinking Sept. might be 10% off compared to end of June but still great fishing. Go for it. When you learn the area its the greatest, Hawkeye"

We talked to the local guides and the turnover isn't until mid-or late October. We get most of our fish deep 24-30 ft even check 40ft-60ft for sauger. Minnows crawlers and power baits work well. Last year we caught at least 100 walleyes over 21 in. We go to Williams Lake lodge, drawback it is 15 miles to the main lake were we fish. Needless to say we take our shorelunch and spend the entire day on main lake points and bars.The hardest part to Lac Seul is to get fish under the slot. if you need more info email me Paul"
