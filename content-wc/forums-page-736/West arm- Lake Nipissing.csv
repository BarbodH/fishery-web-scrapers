The walleye fishing was sub-par compared to past years, although late in the week we did locate some nice fish down the lake outside Jennings Point in the 8' weed beds. The water level was down at least 2 feet from the previous year, I don't know if that had anything to do with our inability to find fish or not, but they weren't to be found in any quantity in their usual haunches. This year the wives went with us. It was their first time and I'm very happy to report that both of them really enjoyed themselves. I've been going to Lakair for about 45 years, although I only started back regularly the last 10. I must report that the cabins, although basic, are absolutely spotless, and the lodge owners, Kevin and Leslie, are very very nice folks. There are a number of rock reefs in the west arm. This year I found two. Fortunately no damage as I was going very slow. I thought I was going to witness a fatality when a 2025 Lund with a 250 Evinrude came screaming past a shoal wide open. I spoke with this fella upon my return to the dock and while I'm sure he is knowledgable of this lake, I'm equally sure he barely missed the shoal I had hit only minutes before. If you're going to Canada, please make sure you use caution on the water. This fella lives around Toronto, and he said he was going back to Lakair the end of the month for two weeks. Unless he wises up it's only a matter of time for him. I sure hope he slows down."
