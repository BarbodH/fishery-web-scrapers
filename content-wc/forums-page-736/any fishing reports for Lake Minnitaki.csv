I am up here this week with the kids and we went out today on Pelican and caught about 30. mostly small but more than enough to eat. again deep and slow. 20 feet of water, 1/4 oz heads, within 4 inches of the bottom. around moving water or humps seemed best."

Then trolled crankbaits mostly and got bigger fish, about even numbers of walleyes and northerns. Best action was in Redpine Bay. Others in camp did well trolling Lindy rigs and spinner rigs. Did not have much success jiggin deep on humps, although we did get our best walleye that way."
