551349,Guest,2005-08-11 09:12:00,0,I believe they check some national data base that shows if a person has criminal record. I don't think they tap into each states DOT data base.
551351,Guest,2005-08-11 10:21:00,0,"If you are arrested in any state, you will receive a state arrest record, and also will be issued an FBI number. The FBI number will allow any agency that runs it to see where in the US you have been arrested. Customs can run this number and see any states' arrests."
551123,Guest,2005-08-04 13:27:00,0,I guess it all depends on the agent you get when you cross. They usally ask us where we are going and how long we are staying before they ever asked for ID. This is the first year they have ever asked for ID let alone check it. I happy you got in and good luck next year if you decide to go back. I do have my doubts that turning anyone around would make the roads safer; DUI or not unless she was drunk while attemping to cross.
551134,Guest,2005-08-04 16:51:00,0,"lonnie......something does not make sense here. From what I have read and been told by more than reliable sources, if your dui is over 10 years old you are automatically considered ""rehabilitated"" and there should be NO question as to whether you can enter Canada or not. This matter should be pursued to make sure it doesn't happen to you or anyone else again."
551141,Matches,2005-08-04 21:26:00,236,"Some requirements for deemed rehabilitation include only Having one convicted offense more than 10 years ago. Lonnie had two, plus the speeding tickets probably didn't help either."
551145,Guest,2005-08-04 22:17:00,0,"I don't know as if this incident was unusual or not. According to what Canadian Customs said I guess I was pretty lucky to get in at all.I knew a recent DUI/DWI could cause a problem crossing, although I did not know that 2 DWI's was enough for a lifetime ban from entering Canada. I genuinely thought that after than many years it would not be an issue. Had I known this ahead of time, then I would have taken the necessary steps to get the waiver. What they said was that since I had 2 DWI's that it was a lifetime ban from entering Canada. Other than the 2 speeding tickets I have a squeky clean driving record in over 30 years. That fact is easily verified. I think if it had been 1 DUI/DWI it probably would not have been a problem getting in, but 2 is more serious. That is fine, it is there country and they can make whatever rules they want. I really can not argue with that. If I want to go back I will jump through their hoops, they make the rules and if I want into Canada I will play by their rules. BUT, what really got me though was that it really really feels like it is all about the $$$ than genuinely the safety of Canada's highways. Why else would they tell me I can never come in, BUT, give us $200 and I can come in for the week???? Why even then did no one asked if I was still drinking or anything at all about how long since I drank, nothing. For all they knew I could have still been drinking a quart of booze every day. Incidently,just for interest: I can verify my rehab, recovery, and credability. AA attendance weekly since 1977. Worked as a Chemical Dependency counselor for State of Minnesota from 1985-2001 and currently working as a county Social Worker for Aitkin County since 2001. I go to jails regularly to do alcohol and drug assessmnets on inmates, and do chemical education classes. My point is that to do my work and get in to jail to present a program and for work I had to pass background checks. My credability is pretty darn solid, so that is not an issue. Thanks, Lonnie"
551150,Matches,2005-08-05 09:32:00,236,"Lonnie, congratulations on your sobriety, and I agree your creditability is solid. I think the bottom line here is, it is all up to the agent at the border. I don't know what their law (if any) is for having to let someone in, but I think that discretion is all left to the agent. Even if someone has a 100% clean record, I wonder if the agent has to let someone in if they have bad vibes about someone. I would be curious to know."
551154,Jimbobwee,2005-08-05 10:38:00,9,"I wonder if someone was turned away, perhaps they could try to re-enter at a later time (the next agent's shift). Just a thought. Probably be a gamble though."
551158,Guest,2005-08-05 12:36:00,0,Interesting comment about trying to reenter. i have wondered the samething myself. If you get turned away at Fort Francis the crossing at Baudette is a short 1 hour drive away. My guess is your name gets into the computer and if they catch you trying to reenter you'd wish your mother never met your father.
551279,rpieske,2005-08-09 20:40:00,1276,I suggest providing a US Passport when entering for identification. You should not have a problem.
551294,Matches,2005-08-10 08:33:00,236,"With a passport, can't they still ask for your drivers license? Wouldn't a DUI still show up if they ran a name check, or does that onlyl show up from the drivers license number?"
551297,Fred_G,2005-08-10 09:32:00,908,I can tell you from experience that a passport does not make any difference. If the border agent wants to check you a passport won't help.
550623,Matches,2005-07-22 11:51:00,236,"This may be helpful for some. The question pops up from time to time if you had a DUI 20 Years ago, is it a problem entering Canada. Answer: It Depends The two links below will help answer many questions if you need to be concerned. Deemed Rehabilitation You may be deemed rehabilitated if at least 10 years have passed since you completed the sentence imposed for your crime. Some requirements for deemed rehabilitation include: You have only been convicted of one offence; and The offence would be punishable in Canada by a maximum term of imprisonment of less than 10 years. You are not required to submit an application to be deemed rehabilitated.

550646,PJM,2005-07-22 23:19:00,3516,"Matches Have you had a DUI where you were stopped at the border, what is the cost to get across?"
550652,Matches,2005-07-23 14:14:00,236,"No I haven't had a DUI as I am a very responsible and health conscious person. Regarding the cost, I have heard for $200.00 and a nice smile they may let you in. I wish I could buy the same Budweiser in the US that they sell in Canada. Go figure!"
550657,bailey,2005-07-23 19:49:00,22,Seems to be some good information about this at this link:http://gocanada.about.com/od/borderc...rehab_cert.htm
550677,Guest,2005-07-24 21:14:00,0,"Does that mean if I had a DUI 21 years ago, I might not be able to enter Canada?"
550682,bailey,2005-07-25 05:20:00,22,Sounds like you would be able to do some paperwork (the rehabilitation application) and likely get approved since so much time has elapsed. I would contact the Canadian consulate and ask the question.http://gocanada.about.com/cs/borderc...ssy_in_usa.htm
550694,Matches,2005-07-25 12:01:00,236,"Jughead, it may be worth a phone call, but the way I read it, you should be OK without filling out any papers if you have had only 1 DUI and it was more than 10 years ago. Again, it reads: You are not required to submit an application to be deemed rehabilitated. You are Deemed Rehabilitated if you have only been convicted of one offence; and The offence would be punishable in Canada by a maximum term of imprisonment of less than 10 years."
551051,Guest,2005-08-04 09:28:00,0,"Well, I finally ran into this situation this summer. My wife and I were making our annual trek to LacSuel. We have been doing this at least once a year for the last 10 years. Well, we crossed at International Falls and Candian Customs checked our drivers liscence. Mine showed I had 2 DUI's 35 years ago. In the last 35 years I have 2 speeding tickets !!! Well, needless to say the Canadian customs told me I could not enter Canada ever in my life. I was told I would have to turn around and could then apply for a waiver which would take at least a month or more to get, and cost between $200 and $1000 for a processing fee. I was never asked if I ever went through rehab or was currently sober or what I do for a living, etc. etc. (As a matter of fact I have not had a drink since completeing treatment in 1977, and have worked as a chemical dependency counselor and social worker for the last 20 years.) Well, I am telling my wife we have to turn around, and cancel our cabin we have reserved. I asked my wife for our cell phone so I can call and tell the resort we are not allowed to come into Canada. Ah, now the customs agents asks where we are going, I tell them the name of the resort and that we already have a cabin reserved. Then and only then was I told that for $200 they could let me in for the week. Hmmm, I am told I can't ever come into Canada for the rest of my life, but for $200 they will let me in for the week. How is it that $200 makes it ok if they are so worried someone might be undesirable or a danger to public safety??? I got the feeling it is about getting the $$$. They never asked if I still drank, I could have been drinking a quart of booze a day for all they knew, and if I pay a fee they will let me in? Paying a fee does not make one a safe person. I reluctanly paid the $200 because I did not want to disappoint my wife, but it seemed to me it was like all about the $$$ rather than if I was really a safe person to let into Canada. It is their country and the certainly can make the rules, but I think if they had said flat out, ""this is our law sorry but you can't come in period"" it would have been better than feeling it was all about getting the $$$ rather than actually ensuring public safety on Candian roads. Will we go back, maybe, maybe not? Have not decided yet."
