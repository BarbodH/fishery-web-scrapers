551310,Guest,2005-08-10 14:46:00,0,"Myself and 3 friends fished Kenozha last month. Huge numbers of 2-3lb walleyes, with the odd 5 pounder for good measure. No large pike were caught and unfortunately no brookies. We found most of our fish in relatively shallow water (5-12'). Likely because of the heavy tannin stain to the water. Bait was unnecessary. 3"" twisters in various colours were all we needed, with yellow being probably the best colour. As mentioned the fish were quite shallow, and this being the case, various shallow running lures also produced. The best for us was an old lightly used standbye, a # 4 or 5 Mepps with the rubber minnow trailing. A white comet style blade with red dots was especially productive. I'd definitely reccomend picking a few up. Kenozha itself was great, if you can read a lake you'll do fine. Just remember, stay shallow, and key in on the windblown shorelines. Yes, we did do the portage, it's most definitely worth it. The lake the boat is on is useless. Head east around a large island. You'll find a neckdown. In one corner there's an inflow, right beside it to the right is an outflow. The inflow takes you to a current area at the head of a rapids, line the boat up to this point and motor upstream to a great hole. The outflow takes you to the base of the same rapids. Once you reach that point, navigate S/E through that lake to the outflow. The current areas and rapids are loaded with walleye. One other note: the beginning of the portage is located just up from the outflow of the lake. With care you can navigate down through the first rapids (on the left side heading downstream). Good walleye there as well. We beached the boats at that point and waded down around the corner in our running shoes fishing from shore. Had a blast, tons and tons of walleye. While there last month we also had a visit from the seemingly infamous bear. He ran like a scalded cat when he saw us though. Nothing really to worry about, although I'd definitely burn your garbage right away and dump the fish entrails far from the camp. Make sure you bring a portable fishfinder and a couple of markers, as we found several small but highly productive humps on the lake that would be impossible to find and fish effectively without. Finally, while I can appreciate your interest in catching brook trout, the season closes on Sept. 5th in that area. You'll be fishing illegally by even targeting them. Hope you have a great a trip. You picked a great camp, and Ernie and Donna are great hosts."

551312,Crede,2005-08-10 18:33:00,134,"Fished Kenozha in September 4 or 5 years ago. Agree with everything Tripper said. Good numbers of walleye 2 - 3 lbs, some up to 6. Was more interested in numbers as had my father-in-law along for his first Canada trip. Most caught off points 5 -12 ft or in current. Didn't try for pike. Got minnows in Armstrong. Caught a lot off the point where the cabin is. Island just out from the cabin looked great, but didn't catch a single one there despite trying every time going out and coming in. All in all had a good week without having to work much for it."

550990,Guest,2005-08-03 07:35:00,0,fished there about 5 years ago.we did catch a 5 pound brook trout about 3 or 4 rapids downstream.had to wade to get back up the rapids.there keezhik lake camp has good brook trout fishing in outflowing river.have fun.

551045,phishfearme,2005-08-04 08:14:00,1242,"arrow - let me take a stab at speaking for bigfoot. my group was at kecheokagan lake a week after bigfoot's with wesley outposts and i'm pretty sure we had very similar experiences; excellent cabin (indoor bath with shower, solar electric, much more), excellent boat and motors, excellent fly-in service BUT to a lake that was clearly netted (we found the nets) and we had to work to catch small walleye and also very few small pike (although i believe bigfoot caught a 28"" eye). the lake appears to be one with incredible options - THREE major rivers flow into it, many rapids & good flow areas and it's many miles long - and bigfoots group was the first group ever with mine being the second (for 10 days). we were all dissappointed though. i've been hesitant to post the trip results as i do every year (as probably is bigfoot) because the outfitter did all he could (being new he had some learning to do) and i would recommend him highly - but not this lake - at least until it recovers more - and we all know how long that takes this far north. contact me via email if you'd like to hear more. phish"

551230,Honest John,2005-08-08 09:21:00,152,"Hello Ole Timer, I fished Kenozha with my group last summer in August. There were plenty of walleyes and northerns. The biggest walleye caught by our group was only 24"" and the biggest Northern was only 38"", but the fish were plentiful and relatively easy to catch all day long. We mainly fished off various islands with a jig and a leech for walleyes. For your trip, it may matter to you that there is nothing between Thunder Bay and Armstrong; so get your gasoline and food at Thunder Bay. Also, Armstrong is on EASTERN time. THE BEAR Midway into the trip, Sven and Brian found a bear ambling along the beach from the point toward our cabin. They were taking pictures and enjoying seeing the bear until some of the older guys pointed out that this was likely to become a very serious problem. First we tried raising our arms over our heads to make us appear larger to the bear and we ran toward the bear, yelling profanities at him. This seemed to interest the bear, but did not bother him. Then Sven and Brian began throwing rocks at the bear. They were about 100 yards away from the bear, so he seemed pretty safe. Even with rocks raining down all around the bear, he seemed unconcerned. Then Brian threw a strike and beaned the bear, hitting him right between the eyes. We heard the thonk, and finally the bear was impressed. He ran back into the woods. While Brian and Sven were throwing the rocks, some of us had retreated to camp where we had thrown all of our entire firewood supply onto the campfire. We sent Ryan to get more wood. He walked down the shore in the opposite direction of where we had last seen the bear. Moments later, Ryan rushed into camp to report that the bear was now just down the shore on the other side of camp. Sven and Brian armed themselves with more rocks and began to throw again. When the very first rock landed near the bear, he obviously remembered that rocks hurt, so he ran away. We never saw him again. On the last day of our trip we used the radiophone to contact Huron Air and give them a weather report at 6 a.m. Although it looked pretty cloudy and foggy, we decided that we could truthfully tell them that we could see across the lake. That made no difference to them because Huron Air was completely fogged in. They had us call back every couple of hours all morning long. Eventually, we flew out at 12:15 p.m. instead of 7 a.m. Our return flight was much smoother, and no one experienced any airsickness. Good luck and have a great trip. Honest John"
551243,Guest,2005-08-08 14:26:00,0,"Thanks, John. Did you do the portage?"
551256,Honest John,2005-08-09 08:52:00,152,"Yes. The first time we found the boat FULL of water with a single empty gas can. We drained the boat and pulled it up higher and left the plug tied to the tiller. The mosquitos were eating us alive. Even so, I made the portage again a day or so later and brought gasoline. I started the motor and made sure it ran OK. We never got around to actually fishing after the portage. Also, the fishing in Kenozha was just great anyway."
