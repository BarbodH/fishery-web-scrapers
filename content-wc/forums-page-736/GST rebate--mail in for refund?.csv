They then process the receipts like they do at the border and send you back your refund in USD. I didn't read the fine print on the form and now see they charge $10 or 17% (which ever is greater) for the handling. We have yet to get our $$ back (probably about $40 USD). I emailed them (with our tip details, $ spent and where) (no phone # or address on the forms I have left at home) a couple days ago and they did get back to me right away asking me 'what company I used'. I emailed back saying I was confused, that I used 'Custom House'. They emailed back again soon and indicated they would check into it. Anyone use them and have you had any problems? How long did it take? Thanks."
