551380,Hump,2005-08-12 13:55:00,578,"We took our first trip to Evergreen and Lac Seul last summer. Evergreen is a great place and very friendly people. I thought fishing was great, but to some whom had been there, it was down due to barometric pressure and mayflies. If that is down, i can't wait for next year. Pat and several others told me that the new restraunt , i believe it is called, Hwy 105 has great food. The corner restrauant in Vermillion Bay has good food. e-mail if you want other info, even tho i am a rookie at Lac Seul."
551301,Guest,2005-08-10 10:06:00,0,"Thanks to all the helpful information from everyone (and researching past threads), we're booked with Gary and Patty for next July. They seem like great people. Final questions, if anyone wants to share - 1) best diner in Ear Falls (I understand there are three within a few minutes of camp); 2) best source for a decent map of the area (I've ordered the NW and SW Lac Seul maps from fishingmap.com, but if there are other helpful resources, I'd love to hear them); and 3) understanding that techniques vary from year to year with the weather and water levels, best crankbaits and other baits to bring along. Thanks for everyone's help!!"
551305,Mike Kansas,2005-08-10 10:35:00,1463,"Dave, Check with the lady that owns the bait shop on the NE corner of the main HWY and the turn off to Evergreen. Her sister owns a Cafe in Ear Falls that we have eaten at several times and the food is good. Pat and Gary will give you a map with good fishing spots marked and they will be happy to help you all they can. My wife and I stayed there last year and my wife caught a 31 1/2"" Walleye on a Perch Shad Rap Model SRRSO7 color 05. We use a lot of Shad Raps and I like colors as follows 05, 11, 23, 26 and 70. Bet if you ask Gary he will tell you where my wife caught her fish. You have picked a great Resort with great hosts. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"

I know evergreen would always complain when we would troll past there camp into the little cove, we did catch fish in there when the water was right. do they have a launching ramp? we might just go there next year. fished lac saul for about 15 years. I dont think there is a good restaurant in ear falls, I guess not like what we are used to anyway. dont forget below the dam, that is the best spot period. good luck. alan"

551343,Guest,2005-08-11 07:28:00,0,They have a boat ramp.
551370,Guest,2005-08-12 09:03:00,0,"I just booked a trip as well 06/10/2006! Had to take this year off, wife and I added to the family this year. In the past we stayed at Golden Fawn, making the switch because I've heard so many good things about Evergreen on this board, that and they appear to have better boats and accomodations. The ""sanctuary"" will NOT be open during our 2006 visit. Anyone have any info on fishing before the sanctuary opens. In the past we've fished there and Lunker point, never needed to travel any further, but would not have a problem doing so. any additional info would be appreciated. Thanks AVS"
551371,Guest,2005-08-12 09:28:00,0,"Thanks for all the helpful info, but my curiosity is now piqued - what is ""the sanctuary"", and of course, is it open by July 15th? Thanks!"
551374,Guest,2005-08-12 09:49:00,0,"The santuary is the place were beer flows and the woman run wild! no just kidding the the santuary is a spawning area that is closed off in the spring to fishing, I think it opens mid June and stays open the rest of the season."
551376,Guest,2005-08-12 10:11:00,0,"AVS - My 20 and 18 year old sons whom I fish with would have preferred your first answer (although I suspect if one hunts around, there are places a little like that in or around Ear Falls)! Thanks."
