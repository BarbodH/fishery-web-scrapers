We have been going to a lodge out of Ear Falls, but the drive from SE Mo. is starting to get old.... along with me. Not really looking for LOW or Eagle Lake area. However, have not ruled that area out. Any suggestions? Thanks, Brad"

However, there is a great place just before Kenora thats very remote and not another resort for about 20 miles. Its Witchbay Camp. They are top notch with everything they have. great fishing close to the resort or you can go exploring where ever you want and not see very many people even when camp is full. Fishing is great for walleye and muskies, good for smallies and northerns. They have top of the line Lund boats with 50hp electric start motors, trolling motors, livewells and depth finders. Excellent food, extremely accomidating staff and fishing pros included in your package. I hope this helps Wingmann"

It is bare bones and offers daily rate. Best Smallmouth Bass fishing I ever had. It doesn't have a web site. It's surprising that a 30-45 minute boat trip will get away from the water skiing, personal watercraft and fishing pressure of drive in resorts. I've heard good things about ""The Fisheries Resort"" It is a drive to and appears to be more family oriented, etc.http://thefisheries.com/ In the same general area of Rainy Lake is Coppen's Resort. Maybe a little less expensive. http://www.coppensresort.com/ A couple of other Rainy Lake Ontario boat in resorts are: Camp Narrows and Campfire Island (an upscale island resort). I think each of these resorts have web sites too."

551206,Guest,2005-08-07 12:02:00,0,"Mylie's Place is located on the mainland. Same road off the highway as Buena Vista. No restuarant, but the best location on the mainland in the area and finest dock system I've seen anywhere at a resort, period. Plus, great accomodations that are always super clean and the best rates in the area as well.http://www.myliesplace.com"
