We are looking for a good place to camp and dock my boat for the last week of Aug and the first week of Sept 2005. We are looking for a good resort that has good camping site, hook ups, dock, toliet facilites, ramp etc. We have look at Gold Pines Camp and Evergreen Lodge. Is anyone familiar with these places or do you know of other good places to go? Thank you"
551209,bailey,2005-08-07 15:23:00,22,I just asked the same question here earlier today- was advised to do a search under the topic of Lac Seul resorts- lots of good info and it should answer your questions.

We have a truck camper and pull a 20 foot boat. How is their camp sites. Are the camp site roomy. It it a well kept up place? How is the dock, fish cleaning station and toliet/shower faciliies (my wife is coming along). How is the fishing on the lake? We have never fished in this area of Canada. I tie my own jigs with bucktails and make my own in line spinners (buck tails). What are the best baits and colors for this lake? I fish mostly for smallmouth bass, walleyes and Northerns. What can I expect from this lake. I am also looking for some pictures of the lake and the resort (gold pines or evergreen). We are even thinking about fishing Pakwash Lake or is Lac Seul a better choice? Please email me if you wish. Thank you"
