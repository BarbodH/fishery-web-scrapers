We fish for Small Mouth bass, Walleye and Northern. I was told this was a great lake for the smallies. I have fished Canada waters before near Dryden (wabigoon Lake). However, we wanted to try something differant. Has anybody fished this lake before. How do you fish this lake? What is the structure like on this lake. I tie my own jigs with bucktails and make my own inline bucktail spinner. I use mostly plastics and lures. What are the hot color for this lake? Is plastics and lures a good choice for this lake? Is live bait better? What kind of experience have you had on this lake (good or bad). Thanks for your help."

We never fished for Smallies but have caught a few while jigging Walleyes. Orange is my favorite color for my jigs. When we go in May we fish with dead suckers for pike. We have pretty good luck with white mepps with a silver blade. There is lots of spots you'll be able to find. I've seen alot Smallies come out of Bruce Lake. Depending on where your staying its not that far. I go to Ciancis which is in the Trout River between Pakwash and Bruce. We mostly verticle jig for Walleyes with a jig and minnow. Others in the camp have luck trolling with a simple spinner lindy type rig or trolling crank baits."
551227,TKCENTERLINE,2005-08-08 08:50:00,24,Thank you for your responce. As a matter of fact that is the same resort we are planning on staying at. We are camping in a truck camper and I pull a 20' deep vee boat. How is the resort? How is the dock and the fish cleaning station. Is it a well kept place. Does it have roomy camp sites. I have talked to Lucy and she has sent us some information. It looks like they are on a river. How far is the lakes (Pakwash and Bruce) from the camp? Is the lakes well marked? My wife is coming and wants to know about the town (ear falls. Is the lake a big lake? What is the average walleyes and northern. Please let me know more and e mail me if you wish.

Both Pakwash and Bruce Lakes are within a few minutes of camp. The walleye fishing was good (but not as good as Lac Seul)at the mouth of the Trout Lake River as well as other areas on the lake. We enjoyed a trip up the Chikuni River to the falls. Ear Falls is a small town but usually has everything we need. The people at Wilson's grocery store are very accomodating. Four Seasons will have all the bait, tackle, and advice you will need. There is also a fine library if your wife likes to read or check her e-mail. The two restaurants on 105 are both good, especially the newly remodeled one - don't remember the name - not the Trillium. Enjoy your trip - we always do!"
