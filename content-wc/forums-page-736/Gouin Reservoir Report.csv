This outfitter is located on the Nemio River, one of 7 major spawning rivers for the reservoir. Although we fished the river occasionally, most often we opted to make a 15 minute run (15 foot aluminum with 15 HP) downstream to Baie du Nord. The area is beautiful and the amount of sand beaches and sand bars is awesome. Driving time from Ottawa, Ontario was approx 7.5 hours with about 5 hours of that on good quality gravel logging roads (graded daily). I was able to safely maintain a speed of 45 mph most of the time. Only tense moments were when we would meet very large logging trucks with immense loads going the other way at 50 mph. The dust created by these huge trucks leaves anyone else in a complete ""white out like "" situation. Consequently, when you saw a logging truck approaching, you checked your rear view mirror for other vehicles behind , you slowed down to a crawl and you pulled over to the right as far as possible. Twenty seconds or so after the truck passed, you could see well enough again to continue. As for the fishing, we had 3 thunderstorms during our stay and no doubt, that impacted the walleye fishing to some extent. On our best day, 2 of us landed 40 walleyes in 6 hours of fishing. Most of the walleyes we caught were 15 -19 inches in length. Our biggest landed was 22 inches and we lost a bigger one (about 25 inches) at the boat. We were unable to find any schools of bigger walleyes - a little disappointing from my perspective. We enjoyed 5 walleye meals while there (two of which were breakfasts). On our worst day, after a morning thunderstorm, we landed only 6 walleyes in the 5 hours before an afternoon thunderstorm. In all, the two of us landed over a 100 walleye in 6 days of fishing. There is no slot limit in the existing fishing regulations and the possession limit is 8 walleye and 10 northerns. Methods we used were jigging, bottom bouncing and crankbaiting. Other clients in camp only jigged and were rewarded daily with more but smaller walleyes (most were 12-16 inches). We also caught approx a dozen perch and approx 2 dozen northern pike. We didn't target pike at all, they were merely picked up fishing for walleyes. All pike were released, the biggest of which was 8 lbs. We stayed in a new 2 bedroom cabin built this past spring that had a shower, a toilet, hot and cold water in the shower and in the kitchen and a screened porch with a view of the river. Although this cabin could sleep 8, the cabin was ideally suited for 4 fishermen and possibly 6 in a stretch situation - there just wouldn't be sufficient room for 8 guys and their gear. New 15 foot Starfish boats (Princecraft) with 15 HP motors worked well. Hosts (Ron and Rosie) were outstandingly friendly and hosted a pot luck dinner and corn roast for all camp clients our last night in camp. Wild blueberries were plentiful (one client picked 15 quarts in 2 hours)."

551393,retire55,2005-08-12 18:18:00,1029,"Hey phish: At present, there are no remote cabins. Existing cabins are all in the same location but suitably spread apart (not on top of your neigbour). The perch we caught while fishing walleyes were 6 inches or less - so not worth pursuing. I lucked into two pieces of fresh wild blueberry pie from the hostess while in camp - scrumptous!"
