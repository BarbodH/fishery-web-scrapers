Now, my pal uses the full-arm approach. He jigs his sometimes 2-3 feet, using his whole arm, not just wrist action. To say the least, I outfish him."

My style depends on the situation. if i'm anchored off a point or over structure, typically little movement to my presentation. if it's a soft bite, i have more successfull hookups if i give the fish a little time to decide he wants it before setting the hook. on the river it's a different story altogether. other times, the fish want an aggressive bite, where you need to lift the bait 2-3 feet and they grab it on the free fall, this can be fun because you may not realize you have a fish until the slack doesn't come out of the line as it should (then you set the hook or get robbed). as stated, it all depends on the situation."

Had both of us on the front off the front with two jigging rods each (IL) and slowly went up river with the wall of jigs in short hops. I could not keep up with him, he did it 8 hours straight without a break exept to pee. It there was a fish uder the boat, he was toast. <{{}}><"

My last trip to Lac Seul June 2004, I got schooled by the group until I started to watch them and they were almost just letting it drag on the ground w/ no Jig action, It was cold and blustery and the fish must have been a little reserved. My catch rate did increase after I adapted to the new technique. I guess one size does not fit all and be aware of the conditions."
