I know I have seen it out there somewhere, just can't seem to locate it. If someone knows the technique or a website that shows it I would appreciate it. Al"
551392,Matches,2005-08-12 18:18:00,236,Here's a good one.http://www.onthelake.net/fishing/articles/ybones.htm
551397,fishinnut,2005-08-12 19:45:00,642,I use the five piece method to fillet pike. What's your e-mail and I'll try to explain it.
551398,retire55,2005-08-12 19:48:00,1029,Here's another great reference for filleting: http://www.fishontario.com/articles/...ish/index.html
551411,pikemike,2005-08-13 10:46:00,95,Never heard of the 5 piece method...does it waste more meat than the traditional Y-boning technique?
551430,Snowball,2005-08-13 20:03:00,28,"Have a look at this! Sorry it is in french but I think you should get the idea.http://www.putfile.com/media.php?n=Cleaning-Pike-French Regards, Snowball"
551442,Guest,2005-08-14 19:50:00,0,Why not just get the nobones about it video and have one boneless butterfly fillet! It comes out in 1 complete pc no bones and the bones come out in 1pc too without any wasted meat.
551449,Snowball,2005-08-15 07:57:00,28,"Have a look at this. There is a sample of the zipper method for pike.http://www.nobonesaboutit.com/ Regards, Snowball"
