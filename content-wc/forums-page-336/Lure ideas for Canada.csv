2644945,adempsey,2014-04-06 14:00:00,963,"I usually bring a few different lures. I bring one natural color and one in firetiger.A few jerkbaits to pitch - Rapala X-Rap, Storm Thunderstick, Bomber Long A, Koppers Live Target Perch. - Pitching to shore line in the evening to get those big girls that come up to feed. A few to troll - Storm Hot'n'Tot, Rapala Shad Rap, Rapala Minnow Rap, Berkely Flicker Shad - Trolling in 12-15 feet of water.A few to troll deeper - Rapala Deep Down Husky Jerk, Reef Runner Deep Diver 800, Rapala Trolls-To, Rapala Taildancer - Trolling in 20+ FOWA few to jig - Reef Runner Cicada, Silver Buddy, Northland Buckshot Spoon. Basically, I borrow various jigging spoons from my ice fishing tackle. I probably toss in a couple of spoons, like Williams Wablers, and some lipless cranks like a Rattletrap or Live Target Shad as well.I normally bring tackle for three guys, but if it were just me it would only be about 12-15 lures.Also, I am sure whatever you are bringing for Pike can be used for the Walleye as well."
2645081,Riceburner,2014-04-06 14:58:00,436,"The brown stained water has always been a great place for orange, brown, and yellow chartreuse colored lures. I think it is because they are visible--so the bright sunshine , even mid-day conditions work well too. We fished spinner snells with a small chunk of crawler with great results. Have fun."
2645777,HeHooksHimself,2014-04-06 19:01:00,725,"We find Rapalas work best for us. I would not be without my #10 Perch X-Rap. It is my ""go to"" I always switch to blue husky jerk with bold belly if I switch at all. For pitching and swimming, you just can't beat shad style of walleye assassins (3 or 4 inch) with the twister tail. Almost as good as minnows all the time and sometimes better than minnows. In dark water you got to have some ""bump""- flash or spin. I can't wait, we are booked for opening week and I am absolutely positive that the ice will be out!"
2647369,bones82,2014-04-07 08:35:00,121,"Here is a list of techniques that have proven successful on tea stained water over the years for us:* Shad raps, x-raps, and hot-n-tots - #7 & #9 Brighter colors, but blue chrome with orange belly is my go to here. Shad color has always been good too. 1.5 mph troll * Husky jerk when they are shallow - same colors as above* Slow Death rig trolled under 1 mph - I mix this up with smile blades, bead, plain slow death hook, and Northland floating slow death rig* Bouncer and spinner with crawler or minnow - slower troll* 3 - 4"" Gulp and a 1/8 - 1/4 oz. jig - use colors that work for you. Pink, smelt, and nuclear chicken were great last year* wacky rig a plastic crawler* jigging rap either vertically jigged or snap jig at slow troll* slip bobber - I use in current??* BfishN Moxi or Gulp paddle tail reeled slowly back to boat - good in current* #9 Minnow Rap - Bleeding Shad/Smelt color right before sunset trolled at 1 - 1.5 mph* Lazy Ike or Flatfish trolled slowly at .7 mph - can tip with half crawler if you want* In-line 3/8 oz chain weight with spinner rig trolled under 1 mph for shallow fish near shore"
2649777,yoopertrout,2014-04-07 16:14:00,1172,Thanks again everyone!
2654513,btmbncr,2014-04-08 17:28:00,492,"Bring some 1 oz. to 2 1/2 oz. botton bouncers with a dozen single hook spinner leaders.Make the leaders about 25 inches long.Most should have small silver blades and some with small gold blades.Bead color,red,orange,chartruese and glow green.Throw in a 1/2 dozen with Mac's Smile blades,the small silver ones and a hand full of chartruese Spin and Glo's.Bring a few crawlers along.A half crawler on one of these spinner bouncers combos and yell ""get the net"".Bill"
2641617,yoopertrout,2014-04-05 15:28:00,1172,"Hello, We are going to a small stained lake (3miles by 1 mile) in N.W. Ontario the third week in June. I'm planning on mostly fishing jigs and bait/twisters. I'll bring some lures for northerns. Would I be wise to bring lures for walleyes too? Suggestions?"
2641673,epiepenburg,2014-04-05 15:39:00,365,Jigs and twister tails are a primary go to bait for people when fishing walleye. Go with brighter colors.
2641785,acplumber,2014-04-05 16:09:00,80,We were at a stained lake-fly in in 2012. And the walleye just hammered my storm thunderstick in firetiger all week Pike didn't touch it Even the perch were hitting it
2642073,packpro,2014-04-05 17:12:00,695,"Love the Berkely Powerbait Hollow Belly paddle tails with weighted hooks. Caught Smallmouth, large pike, and many walleyes within a few hours. You can fish the whole water column and it can be rigged virtually weedless if needed. Nice action, Very versatile."
2642433,Jack77,2014-04-05 18:45:00,168,"We have always had good luck trolling for walleye when we wanted a break from jigging. Here are a few.Storm ThunderStiks - FiretigerRapala - Husky Jerks - Firetiger, Perch, Red and whiteStorm Swim Shads - Pearl and FireTiger"
2642505,yoopertrout,2014-04-05 18:57:00,1172,"Thanks everyone! On the thundersticks, am I right to assume the deep rather than the original?"
2642889,ftfarms,2014-04-05 20:19:00,444,Take a couple 3/8-1/2oz Chrome and blue rattle traps. If I had one choice besides my whistler jigs it would be my chrome-blue rattle trap. I've caught a ton of walleyes and northerns on them. Dark days fire tiger light days chrome blue.
2643193,NathanH,2014-04-05 21:56:00,697,Hands down Rapala fat rap.
2643721,acplumber,2014-04-06 07:20:00,80,"Yooper- it was the original that worked for me, just tolled every day leaving the cabin in 6-12 FOW just along the drop offs"
