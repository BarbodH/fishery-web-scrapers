2684449,Gunner_Fletch,2014-04-16 07:49:00,74,Also....a treble hook is deemed to be 1 hook on an artificial lure. Example .....trolling a crank bait with 3 trebles means you have 3 hooks in the the water. See the use of the umbrella rig in Ontario clarifies this.
2677769,1-shot,2014-04-14 14:28:00,35,"I can tell you that on the Detroit river, whether on the US side or the Ontario side, almost everyone uses stingers. I do know that sometimes on the Great lakes and bigger bodies of water there are some exceptions, not sure if that is the case on the Detroit river. I agree it would be nice to hear from a CO to clear it up. Not clearly black or white with the definition from the link."

2680281,1jigfish2,2014-04-15 07:29:00,110,"Comparing where you live in USA, to Canada for regulations makes no sense. We use them in Wisconsin also, but that has no legality in Canada. Stating to a ranger that we use them back home, will not get you far, if they are not legal there.The ranger that told us they were not legal, said that a lot of people use them, but they were not legal. This was about 9 years ago that we questioned him. The law is sketchy, hence us NOT using them. Until I get a definite legal answer, I am too scared to use them.Jay, I just read the pages that you posted a link to. A very compelling argument. If they print it, you would surely think that it has to be legal. I would still like to hear from a ranger or someone with the MNR, just to be sure.Saying oops later, does not make it any cheaper, when paying a fine."
2680497,bones82,2014-04-15 07:55:00,121,"Found this older post: https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...p/t-76989.html""retire5503-13-2008, 09:45 AMDirtThe following question was submitted to Dave Anderson, the District Enforcement Supervisor at Red Lake, OntarioThe Ontario MNR website it states that you can fish with one pole with one line with up to 4 hooks. I was wondering if the same rules applied to a 3-way rig. That is essentially one line that connects to a three way swivel and splits into two lines. On the first line - or dropper line I would be fishing a single hook jig and minnow or leech. On the second line - or trailer line I would be pulling a rapala (crankbait) with up to 3 treble hooks. Would this be illegal? The entire rig is hooked up to one pole and one line it just splits in two. I realize this may be a stupid question but I just want to be sure. I will be fishing the Red Lake area of Ontario.The answer I received from the District Enforcement Supervisor at Red Lake is:What you describe would be legal.The whole issue of what was deemed to be a hook has been confusing. This has recently been clarified in the revisions to the Ontario Fishery Regulations. The question often asked was, is a treble hook a hook or 3 hooks. So now you can have a line that has a total of 4 hooks on it. For example 4 treble (multi point) or 4 single hooks (single point) or any combination as long as it doesn't exceed 4.That being said there are some lakes with special regulations to restrict anglers to single point hooks, but unless it is a special regulation lake what I first said is the rule. If further clarification is required, telephone Dave Anderson at 807 727 1393"""
2680833,1-shot,2014-04-15 09:24:00,35,"The Detroit river splits down the middle between USA and Ontario. When on the Ontario side, must have an Ontario license and follow all the Ontario rules and vice versa. The people fishing the Ontario waters of the Detroit River use stingers (both american and canadian). You're talking thousands of people fishing this waterway, if they were illegal this would be the place to start with enforcement."
2681233,octanehi5,2014-04-15 10:45:00,1104,"Crawler harnesses are legal, On a single jig hook the treble stingers are also legal. Another option Tie a stand off hook a foot above the jig"
2682729,packpro,2014-04-15 16:48:00,695,"Not sure about the legality, but we did use them on a trip where we could not get live minnows. We ended up using the salted minnows that the camp offered. They were not bad, but they quickly turned mushy despite our best efforts to keep them chilled. The stinger was critical as minnows were easily ripped from the hooks no matter how creative we were when hooking them our jigs. Totally changed the catch rate. It was a little frustrating before we added the stingers."
2684361,Gunner_Fletch,2014-04-16 07:32:00,74,"Bones....here's what I learned a long time ago. Don't always assume people holding a certain ""position"" (MNR ranger) know what the rules/regulations are either. On occasion I have personally corrected a young, new, greenhorn CO on a certain fishing/hunting reg. Don't get me wrong, these people do a great job and some things are confusingly written. Better to call the head office of whatever region you are fishing for clarification......and get the name of the person you're speaking to for future reference. That said, on LOTW for example....you can use stingers on a jig. Some parts of LOTW have different regs....for example Clearwater Bay no minnows etc."
2676402,1-shot,2014-04-14 09:12:00,35,"I was wondering if anyone attaches stinger hooks to their jigs while fishing for walleye in northern Canada. When jigging the Detroit River, I along with almost everyone I know, attaches at single ""stinger"" treble hook to the jig about 2-3 inches behind the jig head. Maybe 30% of my hookups end up on the stinger. For whatever reason, I have never used a stinger on the Canadian lakes and wanted to get everyone else's opinion.The Detroit River this year by the way has been amazing. Went out Friday and Saturday evenings and between 3 of us, boated 10 walleye over 8 lbs, with the biggest biggest weighing just over 11 and numerous 5-8 pounders. Was difficult to catch anything under 22 inches for eating. Unbelieveable weekend. thanks1-shot"
2676505,deadhead1,2014-04-14 09:32:00,193,"I carry them with me and if walleye are short biting and stealing bait then I will use a stinger. There are times when 75% of the fish are caught on the stinger. I do find going without the stinger seems to get more bites so as long as I am catching good then I don't use them, only for short strikes. I fish Lake of The Woods near Kenora."
2676553,bones82,2014-04-14 09:43:00,121,"Any predictions on ice out up there deadhead? I know it's cold this week, but the 45 day forecast is very promising for open water for the opener."
2676649,deadhead1,2014-04-14 09:54:00,193,"I'm looking out of my window at the lake right now on to Storm Bay. Some of the snow has melted and there is water on top of the ice from the snow melt. It got real cold here on the weekend so it has frozen over again, even seen snowmobiles on the lake on Sunday!! I would say with warm weather it should still be ice out by mid May. It seems to take four weeks of warm weather to get rid of it most years."

2676849,bigwalleye1,2014-04-14 10:36:00,2632,"Icarry 'em on Lac Seul, but rarely use them. If I'm getting short hits, I'll slow down or go to shorter shanked hooks and that seems to cure it. Seems to be a larger problem in cold water and current."
2677353,1jigfish2,2014-04-14 12:55:00,110,"Is it legal to use stingers up there? We fish Cedar Lake, north of Vermillion Bay, we were told years ago that it was illegal to add any additional hooks. We have never used them, for that reason. Please advise."

2677449,1jigfish2,2014-04-14 13:20:00,110,"Bones82, Thanks, I read the site that you posted. It does not say anything about add on hooks, that is for factory hooks, lures, etc.. It is about store bought hooks, lures, etc.. We were told by a MNR ranger years ago (while we were being checked) that stingers were not allowed. We asked him that particular question. He stated that any add on hooks were not legal. We were being legal then. I would like to find out the truth, or it could get pretty expensive. I have heard both sides, but never used then, because we did not want to chance it. It would be nice to hear from a ranger."
2677473,bones82,2014-04-14 13:25:00,121,"Here is what it says specifically for those of you who don't open it:""A fishing line must not have more than four hooks attached. A hook includes a single-pointed or multiple-pointed hook on a common shaft but does not include a snagger or spring gaff. The number of hooks includes any single-pointed or multiple-pointed hooks that are part of a lure."" So, would a 2 or 3 hook crawler harness be illegal?"
