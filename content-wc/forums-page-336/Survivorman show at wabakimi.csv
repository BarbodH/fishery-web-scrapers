2647337,Hillbiehle,2014-04-07 08:27:00,66,"I haven't seen the show and plan to watch this evening on the DVR. Without seeing, my initial thoughts, and past experience of going over worst case scenarios in my head is, I would avoid at all costs camping on the shore. We typically have two boats, and unfortunately I've been too reliant on using the other boat as a safety net. Quite often I'm typically ill prepared with just the basics. Hearing the hum of those mosquitoes on the mainland while fishing in the twilight gives me the tingles just thinking about it. I'll never forget on Lake St. Joe the hum of the mosquitoes from the mainland ¼ mile away. I suspect after watching the show tonight I'll do a better job of utilizing an emergency kit and remind myself that I'm at the mercy of mother nature and various mechanical issues that could quickly detour a good fishing trip."
2647657,SinOrSwim,2014-04-07 09:26:00,1528,"I think he is trying to really show how the average person would respond to many situations. ONe thing he can do better than anything I've ever seen is start a fire. Not sure I would stay on the lake or go ashore? I see pros and cons to both. My instinct would be to go on shore though. One thing I don't understand is I have seen his survivorman and son twice now, both in Canada. One was a fishing trip and one a kayak trip. If you have fishing gear there is no reason it shouldn't be out fishing all the time. Tie the pole to a tree and throw some bait out there. His shows typically show worst case scenario with very little gear and here is what you would do. With his son however, they have a TON of gear in reality. I think he is trying to create a doomsday scenario when in reality it probably isn't that hard with the amount of gear they have. But still trying to make good TV."
2657681,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-09 11:34:00,1460,"Well, I think I tracked down where this show was filmed. Was reported to me through Facebook (one of Huron Air's pilots), that the lake in the Wabakimi Park episode is Peninsular Lake, 85 miles NE of Armstrong. That would put it straight north of Ogoki Reservoir well outside the boundaries of Wabakimi Providential Park."
2633809,1-shot,2014-04-03 15:00:00,35,"Any one else see Discovery Channel's ""Survivorman"" show done from Northwest ontario in Wabakimi. It is re-airing this Sunday at 6m eastern time."
2633881,SinOrSwim,2014-04-03 15:15:00,1528,"Just watched it this afternoon. I have seen pretty much every Survivorman. I like it when they do these shows because if I ever got stranded, it's exactly like his last two episodes with his son. It would be in Ontario out fishing. I do chuckle a little. For such an avid outdoorsman when he shows himself fishing, he looks a little out of sorts. Jerking the rod around when reeling in a fish. lolWhat outpost camp was that? Huron air picked them up."
2634001,Carnhzkr,2014-04-03 15:48:00,964,"I watched it last night and thought the same thing. You could tell by the way he held and cast his spinning outfit that he wasn't an avid fisherman. I've only watched a couple of episodes since it's become ""Survivorman and Son"", but I'm not too impressed with the ""and Son"" part. The Son didn't look like he really wanted to be there. If you watch the closing credits, he did give thanks to Huron Air and mentioned the name of the Outpost. I think it was Wabakimi Outpost, but can't remember for sure."
2634017,Carnhzkr,2014-04-03 15:57:00,964,"I'll give him credit for one thing, though. I had no idea you could start a fire like that with bug spray. I'll have to give that a try."
2634345,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-03 17:29:00,1460,Thanks for the heads up 1 shot! Got my DVR set to record.
2634593,jimirjr,2014-04-03 18:28:00,1149,"Not so sure about sleeping in the boat like they did... Rocking and bouncing all nite... His Son didn't seem to be having such a good time, did he?"
2634777,Jig Man,2014-04-03 19:19:00,95,Thank you for alerting me to this. My last fly-in trip was to Wabakimi and on the first day my son and I were accross the lake from our cabin and our motor died! I should be owed Royalties! Can't wait to check it out.
2645817,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-06 19:11:00,1460,"Mam O Man! Blueberries, Walleye, and a few overnighters on the lake. Those boys are having fun but they truly can't fish a lick. The bed of bough branches for a bed in the boat is a masterful idea. Comfy and cozy! They sure aren't afraid to drink the Wab water. Les scoffs at ""beaver fever"". Calling in the loons is funny, but Les just needs a mirror to find the biggest loon on the lake. I tell ya what, this show was fun but was all ""mental Les drama"" with very little substance. I enjoyed it thoroughly!"
2645937,hoosiercanadian,2014-04-06 19:52:00,104,"I thought the decision to walk through the bush was a very risky one. The bush up there can be so thick that a rabbit could'nt get through it, with fallen trees and moss 2 feet thick ,as well as possibly turning into a bog and making you get off your course to go around it , then get you turned around. Great to see a survival show filmed in Canada though, but those boys need to fish more. They appeared to be very inexperienced."
2646521,Ogoki,2014-04-07 03:16:00,291,"Don't shoot me or flame me for my comments. But I think most of us here could show them how to fillet a fish ,much better than they did . My wife even noticed how little they got out of that first walleye . Now how many of you would sleep in a boat , on a lake where you are the highest spot on the lake , if a lightning storm came up. I think most guys know , if you see lightning or hear thunder you need to get off the lake , as in away the the edge and boat. In this show it appears as if he is trying to teach people how to survive in a given circumstance . I think many of you here could have done a better job with this .I have read this board almost daily for years and would rather have been there with you than them. Yes seeing the scenery made me want to be there . After 38 fly in trips , I still cant get enough of Northern Ontario. Like I said don't beat me up for my thoughts , but my wife even said after watching that he would have rather been there with me than them."
