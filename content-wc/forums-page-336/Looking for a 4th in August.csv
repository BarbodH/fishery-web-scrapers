Too many friends too afraid of their wives and co - workers unable to take off work at same time. Dates appear to be Aug 9-16 and leaving from central Indiana to fly out of Wawa. Lake with good numbers and several trophy quality fish. So far, my cousin and I (late 30s) and his retired step dad with 45 years of fly in experience are slated to go. Lots of beer will be consumed and cigars will be smoked. For more specifics, please shoot me a PM and a little bit about yourself. Thanks."
2525250,Kansas Bound,2014-03-06 15:16:00,152,This is the time of year we now go. The weather and fish are a lot more predictable. I think the bugs are less as well. The only hard part is waiting that long to go.
2525474,5richards,2014-03-06 16:38:00,131,probably a good idea to let everyone know which lake you are going to fish.
2525786,forgop,2014-03-06 17:51:00,880,I'll share that with those who have enough interest to at least send a PM.

2679681,forgop,2014-04-14 23:16:00,880,"Thought I'd give this another bump. Had a few nibbles and a darned wedding that got in the way of landing a great catch for our group, so looking for any others that might have interest. We could make this a single for a group of 4 or a group of your 3 to make 6. Mike Borger has fished this lake multiple times with great reviews. Send me a PM for more specific details."
