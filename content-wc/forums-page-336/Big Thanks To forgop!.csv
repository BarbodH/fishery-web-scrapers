Quite unexpectedly I received a package from him in the mail consisting of a bunch of very fine cigars and a couple of big bags of some really spectacular coffee beans. Two of my most favorite things.You're a true gentleman Duane, thank you!!"

2628705,Juls,2014-04-02 11:51:00,13414,"Those are the best kind of ""Thank you's""....very thoughtful indeed!"
2646505,forgop,2014-04-07 02:48:00,880,"Just a token of my appreciation for the help. Without your excellent reviews, I would have never stumbled across many of these lakes and your tips are great. However, it is your fault that I had to explain to my wife that I was going on another trip this summer after I planned to take the year off...but your pics/vids gave me walleye fever so I couldn't turn it down. Only 56 more days until Cancun, but 123 LONG days until Canada fishing."
