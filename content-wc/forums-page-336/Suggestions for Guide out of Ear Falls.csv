2661393,SinOrSwim,2014-04-10 06:48:00,1528,Not sure if it's an unwritten rule but can you post them here and let people give you pros and cons? Maybe people have used some of those guides and have good things to say? May actually give those guides a big boost having some positive reviews on this board?

2662665,Jwendt15,2014-04-10 09:58:00,72,"Sure, below is a list of the guides she recommended. I have tried looking them up in this forum but haven't had much luck. Hopefully I'm not breaking any ""codes"" by doing this, but I would love to hear any feedback from anyone that has used them: Don MacDonald Stan Williams Dennis Sharp Terry Williams Jon Jacobs Patty had mentioned we would be satisfied with either so I am sure they are all great to take out."
2663577,teddi,2014-04-10 15:36:00,349,"They are all good but I don,t know john Jacobs. Never heard of him before up here."
2663665,SinOrSwim,2014-04-10 16:03:00,1528,Ask Prov1800 if he knows him.
2663873,prov1800,2014-04-10 16:38:00,5010,"I live down the road from you at red lake rd, just come up there when iam called.have guided for a few camps your way.usually run out of scout bay with my own boat."
2664361,NWwalleye,2014-04-10 19:24:00,223,I bet he knows him ....
2664457,prov1800,2014-04-10 19:34:00,5010,Think so.
2651825,Jwendt15,2014-04-08 07:09:00,72,Anyone have any recommendations on a good guide out of Ear Falls? This will be our first time on Lac Seul so it would be good to get on some spots and learn presentation day one. We do have some rookies on the trip so someone with a little patience would be preferred. Also would be great if we could experience a great shore lunch for the first time! Thanks for any advice you can provide!
2653105,SinOrSwim,2014-04-08 11:48:00,1528,FishGuide1800 guides up in that area and was very helpful for us last year. I don't think he posts under that moniker though? Might be Prov1800?? I can't remember. He was going to help us out last fall but was on Holiday while we were up there. Much of it depends on time of year and where you are staying. Do they have access or provide guides? Possibly give more specifics?
2653265,Jwendt15,2014-04-08 12:23:00,72,"We are heading out there the second week in June. Staying at Evergreen Lodge in the Ear Falls area. No guides are available directly through the lodge, but I am sure that won't be an issue."
2653321,KTroller,2014-04-08 12:38:00,237,"We usually stay up that way during that time of year give or take a week. You shouldn't need a guide. There's a whole string of Evergreen camp boats that head out in the morning that I'm sure you can follow to/tell you spots & routes. You can also have the camp mark up a map for you. We're doing a boat in to a different section of the lake this year or you could follow us around, but PM me if you want some additional spots.KT"
2653865,prov1800,2014-04-08 14:51:00,5010,Thx sin.I had to register again and your right its prov1800.I also do some guiding for evergreen lodge.if you guys are interested you can call me at 1-807-227-2438 or my cell at 1-807-220-0860.
2654017,prov1800,2014-04-08 15:25:00,5010,"Just have to say most places people fish on most canadian are places guides have found and have taken their guests to these locations.lac suel included.then these places end up becoming camp spots andevery camp in the area sends there guests to these placesand at times these places get pretty dam crowded.in thecearfalls area there is the wenesaga river, great for playing bumper boats and another favourite spot is sawmill bay.with some 15 camps up there sending there guests to these places it can get pretty crowded and maybe if your from the states some people are ok with this, me iam not.i still have a few places where i can fish in peace, thankfull for that and so are the guests i take out.also running from earfalls to mackenzie bay, thats a long way to go to catch fish.just my two cents."
2654321,Jwendt15,2014-04-08 16:38:00,72,"KT, where are you staying? Definitely not opposed to meeting up somewhere to see how the fishing is going. Prov, do you still guide in that area? We are from the states but have always enjoyed more ""peaceful"" fishing. However I do understand that most new fisherman are pointed to the more popular, easier spots to find. Feel free to PM me if you are interested."
2655729,teddi,2014-04-09 04:38:00,349,Patty should be able to get you a guide localy.
