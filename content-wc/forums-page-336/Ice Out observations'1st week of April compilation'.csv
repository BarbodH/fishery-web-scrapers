2658225,LoDo,2014-04-09 13:31:00,721,"Prov1800, Thanks for the updates! I have a good group going to the Caribou Park area, Donald Lake, May 22. How do you feel about the ice out in the Ear Falls and Red Lake areas? Are we on schedule? Thanks,"
2658697,115 optimax,2014-04-09 15:32:00,650,I was on a little Splake lake on the 7th that normally only has about 10-12 inches of Ice on it this time of year..My auger only had 3 inches to spare on the 7th.Who knows what's going to happen this spring.
2650817,Limeyangler,2014-04-07 19:38:00,563,"Lots of talk about when ice out is going to be this year. Thought I'd throw my hat in the ring and show what ice conditions have been like for the first week of April over 5 years. The videos start in 2010 and go right up to today, 7th April 2014. Quite the contrast recently from boat fishing in 2010 to 4' thick ice today.April 10th 2010https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYJ0JQydaE8April 4th 2011https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6EHgZOzO0QApril 4th 2012https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAT9yPUgc44April 14th 2013https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qfrLvAp0xYApril 7th 2014https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbDrx-tnJvc"
2650889,jkaup,2014-04-07 19:56:00,56,The last video wouldn't play. Said private?
2650929,Limeyangler,2014-04-07 20:10:00,563,Sorry 'bout that .fixed it now .should play.
2651169,Carnhzkr,2014-04-07 21:07:00,964,"If you were a real man, you'd use a hand auger."
2651185,Mike Borger,2014-04-07 21:12:00,1554,How thick was the ice last year in early April compared to this year Simon?I'm guessing that a lot of what you're drilling through this year is snow.
2651801,Limeyangler,2014-04-08 07:01:00,563,"Last year we had a lot of snow too, but it came pretty late. It was a normal ice out though .around May 12th.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSHLKZtZd98 I am not really sure how thick the ice was this time last year, but i have some pictures of out front of the house that show hardly any snow left and can say with confidence it is thicker this year. Yesterday there was around 8 inches of snow where I was, then another 6 or so of water under that crust then 3 feet of solid black ice. That was on a smallish but deeper trout lake. But talking to a guy out front of our house on Wabigoon the other day sounds like a similar scenario. However, ice conditions were different all over the lake. Another spot was a thin crust of crap ice/snow, then a foot of water but still 3 feet of black ice. By the time i left the lake I was glad I was on a 1200cc with 20""x154"" track ..took every horse under the hood to get out of areas of slush over 2' deep!"
2656785,srj,2014-04-09 09:03:00,971,"Limey, interesting stuff. Sure nice to have the power you need to get out of the deep stuff. Must of been a lot of stuff flying behind you. Wabigoon is one of my favorite Ontario lakes. It seems all species eat really well in that stained water as they all are porkers. Always enjoy your posts."
2657297,prov1800,2014-04-09 10:32:00,5010,"Been out fishing throughout this winter and been out a lot lately.from my observations this winter did have a little more snow than last year, but the ice thickness is the same.I fish the lakes north of vermilion bay and they have great conditions right now.hardly any snow on top of the ice.it has really gone down.only had to shovel 5-10"" in some spots, then we hit frozen slush which serms to be around 12"" of that crap and the we get around 28-30"" of solid good ice.havnt needed a extension yet, sometimes we have had to drill around the hole to get the motor a little deeper and thats all it needs.few places were you can see the slush saturating the snow with water.everything seems pretty normal for a canadian spring.weather is what determines what is going to happen.when the frozen slush melts and it will start this week as it is warming here.that will be a mess but as soon as the ice lifts its going to be good to go again for fishing for a couple of weeks as usual.a lot of things have to happen in the next 6 weeks."
2658009,bones82,2014-04-09 12:45:00,121,Prov1800 - What's your prediction on ice out based on your experience and comparing this year to last year? As well as the extended forecast? We are heading to the English River for the opener NE of Kenora. Based on prior years I believe the river opens a little sooner than inland lakes. Thoughts? I have noticed that the temps for April 2014 have been 5-10 degrees warmer than last year at this time.
2658089,prov1800,2014-04-09 13:00:00,5010,"You guys should be good, rivers here are already opening up near the current areas.end of april will tell all"
