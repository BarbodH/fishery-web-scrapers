2677321,Hawker,2014-04-14 12:46:00,3967,"Just called the owners of Young's Wilderness Camp (Perry & Carol) to see what the current conditions are up there compared to last year. Still some snow on the ground and ice, but actually close to what it was last year about this time. We always go the last week of May into June and did great last year, so not too worried about ice etc.While talking with him, he advised a group had just canceled during the middle of June in the case I wanted to re-schedule my trip, but it's already too late (wife's work) for me to change. That being said, here is an opportunity (short notice I know) for a group of four (4 minimum) up to eight (8) folks to hit Lake of the Woods during ""prime time""! The open dates are June 13th - June 21st which is a great time slot that I wish I could take myself, but am committed otherwise.My wife and I have been going to Young's for the past 23 years straight and all I can say is that it is a great place to stay, great owners and staff, excellent cabins, excellent boats, super great area to fish!!Give'em a call if your looking for someplace during that time slot, tell'em Hawker told ya about the opening! 866-894-0674 (toll free from U.S.)http://www.youngswildernesscamp.com"
