2648257,Carnhzkr,2014-04-07 11:15:00,964,"I'm not exactly sure where West English River Prov Park is, but I know of a great DIY spot on the Western edge of the English river - West end of Ontario, that is. Been on DIY trips there many, many times, since the sixties. If you take the road north of Minaki, across the Whitedog dam, you come to a Y in the road. Left takes you into the village of Whitedog and right takes you to the Caribou Falls hydro dam. The dam creates Lake Umfreville on the English. Above the dam is Haley's main lodge and below the dam is a public camping area. The camping area has changed a lot over the years (haven't we all?). There was a time when you had to obtain nightly crown permits to camp. There were a few years when the gov't turned the campground over to the local tribe and they charged a nightly fee. We never know for sure what we're going to run into until we get there, but we have not had to pay anything to camp there for many years. There was a time in the old days when this was a pretty busy place. It was hard to find a spot to pitch a tent on the weekends, but it's been pretty much abandoned for the past 15 - 20 years or so. We'll often go the entire week without a single neighbor and only see a few locals that drive down from Whitedog. You can still see the old cement slabs where folks used to park their RVs, and the rotted remains of an old outhouse, but there are no amenities at all at the campground, other than a place you can put in a boat below the dam. Each day, we pass by Caribou Falls Lodge and Tetu Lodge on our way to our fishing spots. This water is also used by KCR camp and another lodge that comes in from Manitoba to the west. We've always done really well fishing the English in this area. Of course, we've fished it for so many years, we have our spots and techniques down to a science. We know if they're not biting in spot 1, we move to 2, then to 3, etc., and we will eventually find them."

One thing you are right on, the lakes belong to the public, but that is the Canadian public. Inviting Americans to break the law is not excusable. There may not be as many CO's out there as there used to be, but I can guarantee they are out there in N/W Ontario and will do their duty, as they should. You can bet that plenty of locals would be more than happy to turn an American in that was bushwacking, and well they should. Let's take the proper channels to address this. I don't like it either."
2648993,phishfearme,2014-04-07 14:03:00,1242,"you simply need to contact the regional MNR about the lakes or areas you plan to access - the Ontario crown land access rules are all over the map and heavily regional with special regulations for parks. for example, the lake where we'll be going this summer has logging roads all around it but access - and HOW you access it - is strictly limited as the roads were put in by logging companies well after the outpost was established. the holder of the outpost LUP was more than within his rights to insist that that the roads would either be gated and locked or torn out. but gates only work so well and none of the roads were taken out. the last time on this lake, we saw three boats that were hauled in illegally. when we asked how they got there all we got was ""you ask too many questions"". after seeing numerous of these violations by locals, it's clear to me that Canada has just as many people who think the laws were meant for someone else as we do in the US. phish"
2649257,Aaron-IN,2014-04-07 14:50:00,500,Exactly! I won't go into details here other than to say I've done a bunch of DIY trips in the last 30 years and of the people I saw breaking the laws 99% were the locals.

Seems like sour grapes for someone who doesn't want anyone around who isn't using an outfitter as opposed to true concern about the law. Either an outfitter has exclusive rights to a lake or they don't. If an outfitter does not have exclusive rights, then he should accept the fact that other people will be using the lake by using any means legal, including portaging in every day. After looking at a green zone non resident map and doing other research, it is apparent to me that DIYing (at least in NWO) is frowned upon by various political and commercial interests in Ontario. And thats OK, because Ontario can make and enforce its laws. I will keep all my options open, including looking at other provinces. Thanks for the input guys."
2650545,Golden Eagle,2014-04-07 18:53:00,2642,There's not a camp on every good fishing lake. Why bust through the bush to make it to a fly in lake that has a camp? Would it be so one can drive past paying guests to one up them? Strange behavior.Find your own lake that hasn't been hit hard and have at it. Try not to leave a trail or you might have company on your next trip.
2650657,Larry S,2014-04-07 19:06:00,665,"I was at this fly-in with Phish. After we got home one of the Canadian Fishing websites I access has a place where you can ask the MNR questions on any subject pertaining to the outdoors in Ontario. I asked a question on the above subject and never got an answer. To me this means that the MNR is either too lazy to answer the question, or didn't want to answer it. In any case the above mentioned lake did have residents who got into the lake on closed roads which the outfitter has said they are breaking the law by using. This owner is a OPP Officer."
2650705,fsz,2014-04-07 19:17:00,144,"It's not about one upping anyone. Our group already has the equipment, and we just want the best possible fishing we can get on a DIY trip. If you back out the green zones where non residents can't camp, the options are certainly less. And we are keeping our options open. I think the issue for some people is they have been going to lake so and so for 20 years and never knew their outfitter doesnt have exclusive rights. They see either ""locals"" or non res fishing and want to assume some law is being broken."

2657841,v-bay gord,2014-04-09 11:56:00,3168,"Some ideas are worthy of debate, as are some individuals. In this case I don't see the point... For most members on WC who primarily fish the NW region of Ontario this argument is meaningless. The fisheries in the NE region are second class in comparison to those in the NW. That is a fact. There is no shortage of quality fisheries here that can be accessed by road. The reality is access needs to be managed and it has never been a ""Canadian heritage right"" to be able to park your RV on any lakeshore you feel like."
2659233,yoopertrout,2014-04-09 17:46:00,1172,"I'm not sure this is true. I spoke with an outfitter about a trip this summer when I found out about a logging road 1/2 mile from a lake we were considering being flown into. He has had his fishing operation in place for many years. AFTER he spent the money and started the operation, the logging companies wanted to log the area. To protect his investment, and the tourist money coming into the area, the rule was set that the roads were to be used for logging only. He said that if someone uses the logging roads to get to the lakes he flies to, they can be arrested. Given his investment, and the thousands of lakes with no camps on them, I think this is reasonable. There are a zillion places in Ontario to do a do it yourself trip. No need to crowd into a fly-in camp lake, upsetting the guests who paid to be flown there, and harming the owner's business. I would feel differently if there were relatively few lakes in Ontario, as I generally am a fan of public access to public fishing waters. Given the fact that lakes without camps vastly outnumber those that do, why destroy the tradition and economic benefit of the traditional fly-in vacation?"
2659265,phishfearme,2014-04-09 17:50:00,1242,"nor drive your Hummer thru the bush. nor ride your ATV anywhere you want to. from this US boy's point of view the ""Canadian heritage"" is to use your own strength and ability to go as far into the wilderness as you can - this is very similar to the ""US wilderness heritage"" if there is one. the ability now of essentially everyone and anyone to easily access everything and anything by motorized vehicles is where the heart of the problem lies. management has become essential and some people just don't like it. well too bad. phish"

I would say that very few lakes THAT ARE WORTH FISHING are not already either: 1 - taken by either lodges and outposts or 2- direct portages from these or 3 - restricted/reserved by the native Canadians or 4 - have boat caches on them. sure you can find isolated small lakes that would produce a nice day or two of fishing but they could never support an outpost or lodge or be worth extensive bushwhacking into. phish"
2660897,roscoe33,2014-04-10 00:32:00,653,"The resort we frequented for the last 15 years, was started by 2 brave and poor Canadians, who set up a shack and a tent, and sold minnows and ice to the car topper crowd that drove up the logging road. Eventually they got the lease rights to the land, and built a few cabins. They have grown, and they still cater to the people that camp on crown land, further up the road. Many of the former campers, are now their regular cabin renters. There are many areas where there are no lodges or resorts, or people. These are the areas that our family sought out, starting in 1953 when granddad retired. Those lakes are still there, and still have no lodges. The wilderness experience is still there. Although we no longer tent camp these lakes, we still stop in for a day of fishing, or just remembering for an hour or two, when we happen to be traveling through. Now we stay in cabins, relax, pick berries, catch a few fish. Nothing has really changed, except now we can afford to rent the cabin. It seems the hustle and bustle, competitive attitude has gotten to the far western end of Ontario. I have witnessed too many groups that treat their vacation like a business venture. Like they NEED to catch 50 fish per day, or they have lost something, or failed. IMO, if they NEED to catch 50 fish a day, they have already lost something. We have chosen to stay east of Ignace for the last 20 years for that reason."
2661817,Wawajake,2014-04-10 07:59:00,413,"Your right Roscoe , what once was outdoors heritage for us Canadians to explore our backwoods is being overtaken by a much more competitive outlook, where money and numbers take precedence. It seems even more so in North Western Ontario maybe. (I see above where a North western lodge owner has slagged North Eastern Ontario but that's to be expected) One only needs to read the above octanehi5 post to see how the guy with the most money and the most numbers thinking operates .unfortunately it is at the expense of the normal fishermen that just wants to experience a variety of lakes and the fish his taxes support. Fishing is being commercialized and slowly taken away from the normal joe and his kids and as the sport becomes elite it will become rarer because the future generations will lose interest as access and rules benefiting the lodge owner becomes worse and worse. Eventually the lodge owners will realize they were part of the cause and effect, but it will be too late then .their elite customers will have died off even as the Canadian Tire Stores tackle section will get smaller , it won't happen fast it will be a decade or two before the selfish exclusive lodges fail too .. like the first run of USA clientelle lodges that folded with the USA passport hit last decade. I can use one lodge here in North eastern Ontario 80 miles north of Sault on the Agawa River as an example I stayed there in the mid 90's . Accessed it via the Rail service in winter for the cross country skiing clientelle and in the summer by logging roads if you wanted. But clientele dwindled as MNR closed summer roads and last nail in coffin will be this year when ACR rail line stops passenger service that off the grid lodge is being abandoned, his son (my friend) had originally had hopes of taking it over from his father and mother , but now is working at the local TSC store. There is an example of closing access impacts . In this case because of MNR  headwaters park  thinking. So not even a selfish lodge owner situation. (although we have those too here in Algoma ) So Toronto people deciding what is good for Northern Ontario at locals expense."

2665049,roscoe33,2014-04-10 23:09:00,653,"Just to be clear, my comments were not aimed at any lodge owners or operators. It was type of clientele that we were running into. What they expected in fishing, what they expected from the lodge, the competitive nature of their fishing, and what we felt was simply not relaxing. I also don't fault the owners for catering to these clientele, as they bring big bucks and certainly contribute a chunk to their bottom line. How an operator runs his business is really no concern of mine. The politics between locals and operators, no concern of mine. Really have had only one bad resort owner (drunk and rude) that we chose not to return to. Now he has sold out to 2 city folk that may turn the place around. They seem like nice people, hopefully they can make a run of it. We don't go the the upscale resorts, or do fly-ins any longer, simply because its not relaxing for us. We would rather be somewhere basic, where some guy is there, teaching his 10 year old how to set the drag, work a jig, and see the kid smile when he lands a fish. Our expectations in a resort: clean, a shower, heat when needed, 5 minutes worth of fishing tips to get us up to date on current conditions. Tight lines to all."
2665145,Wawajake,2014-04-11 05:27:00,413,".............and those are the same things us locals want, a remote location to relax and maybe even teach our fishing heritage to our children, a place to hear the loons (instead of the loonies on the jet skis) and use public land and lakes to get there.... and as for the definition of rich.....its always funny when a guy driving a $50,000 SUV pulling a $40,000 bass boat using LaCroiX rods and the best reels on the market and goes on two or three fishing trips a year tells me, sitting in my 14 ft alum boat with a 9 hp 10 year old merc towed by a 6 year old Dodge ...that he is middle class poor."

I don't make a 6 figure salary, far from it. My wife doesn't work because my daughter has had health issues for the last 9 years. I have 2 kids, with 1 in college. I have 4 vehicles, all used, and yes one of them is a SUV. I also have a Yarcraft 209TFX, a nice home, and 2 dogs. Other than the house payment, I have NO DEBT! I don't consider myself rich. I am middle class. How do you ask? Unless it is an emergency, I pay cash for everything. If I cannot afford it, it does not get purchased. 30 years ago, I quit drinking because I wanted to buy a boat, 3 years later I paid cash for a new Stratos, and yes, I was a drunk! 3 years ago, I could not afford to go to Canada and continue to smoke so I quit a 2 pack a day habit. That was almost a $4,000 per year savings. My family and I don't go on family vacations because the kids have had summer jobs since they were 12 years old. To have someone attempt to judge and complain about what they perceive as rich is just outrageous. God bless the rich and the middle class that drive those big vehicles and big boats. They provide a heck of a lot of jobs. Sorry for the rant!"

But enough of this thread .........the clientelle will conveinantly ignore the locals..... and the lodge owners will continue their quest to keep locals away from ""their remote fish"".

Without the drive to pressure, that people but on drive to spots, I have never found a drive to lake to compare to a true fly in destination, that even comes close to the quality of fishing on the fly in.

If the locals (Wawajake) don't like the idea of portaging a 14 ' and 9.9 in and out of a lake everytime they fish a fly-in lake then spend $250,000.00 and buy a piston Beaver like the outfitters do."

And please don't pretend that all these lakes were always just fly in, because many had roads and trails into them long before self centered lodge owners decided they wanted to corner the market at the expense of tax paying locals. Nope I don't need to buy a beaver plane , I will continue to use my ATV (here in North Eastern Ontario) and if you leave me alone I will not offend the lodge clients , but if you ratchet it up by lying to your clients about your lakes being crown land accessible .then you can expect that the locals will slowly become your biggest enemy and I would think lodge owners would want to work with the community not against it. If you can't share your lake with a few locals once and awhile then you are forgetting what it means to be Canadian and the Canadian outdoor values in our heritage. Meanwhile the (Ontario) Public Lands Act, Section 3, outlines that 25 percent or more of crown land that borders a lake must be reserved for public use. By ignoring its obligation to the people of Ontario, MNR has created a two-tier system of access to our shared resources. What right does MNR have to violate the law and to restrict the access of traditional users to those lands but allow access to only the privileged few? Public Lands Act section 3 that was written by the lawmakers to ensure lakes on which Crown lands border will always be available for adequate ""sustained"" access and recreational opportunities for present and future generations of Ontarians.

2653585,phishfearme,2014-04-08 13:40:00,1242,I think what you state (leaving unregistered boats on a lake for long periods) is only part of the issue - it's also HOW you access the lakes. busting through gated logging roads with motorized vehicles or off roading trailering a ton of boats/motors/gear is what causes many of the problems - and an underfunded OPP or MNR just can't keep up with these. portaging in via canoe (or boat/motor) is perfectly fine as long as initial access is gained legally. phish
2655881,Wawajake,2014-04-09 05:40:00,413,"So Phishfarme so glad you think as an American that us Canadians are causing ""problems"" by using crown land and trails already there....and want to experience our Canadian heritage on publically owned lakes. The way I look at it the lodge owners like V bay or others make money off every fish caught and so we know what their motive is.......the almighty dollar so they lobby the government to allow them to make more money and exaggeratte to MNR what ""problems"" arise but not having their ""own lakes"". (or nine of them like some lodge owners here posting) Meanwhile us locals just want the freedom to use existing raods and trails to experience lakes and fishing (yes catch and release even) that our taxes pay for. Its funny that many a Canadian resteraunt establishment wants to make money off tourist clientelle (and I commend them for it).....BUT they don't lobby the Government to get to be the only eating establishment in that city block! ...because that would be seen as a ridiculous request! But that is essentially what the lodge owners selfishly want . But I realize I am preaching to the ones that want to make a buck off Canadian public fish .......or their clientelle who already fished out their country. (or their country already allowed too many of their lakes to be private) . I like many locals here just want the freedom to enjoy my Canadian heritage on public land and lakes and not lose those rights to money and their deceptive lobbiests."

The rest of us drive thousands of miles and spend thousands of dollars to fish the same water that you can fish on your way home from work. There is more than a lifetime's worth of legal and public fishing within only a few hours of your house. Regulations continue to get more conservative ... protecting the resources for future generations. And the mind-set of anglers, visitors, and business owners is becoming more and more geared toward catch and release ... meaning more and bigger fish for everyone. Yet still you complain.

2651281,Mike Borger,2014-04-07 21:33:00,1554,"Road access being restricted to the fly in lakes is a hot button topic with a large number of local anglers up north.The impression I get is, right or wrong when people think their rights are being violated their hackles are immediately raised.Outfitter lakes comprise an extremely small percentage of the lakes in any given region. It's completely unnecessary to drive in and fish these lakes, there are countless alternatives that are as good or better with zero people around. Paddle and portage in if you wish, if you do that then you've paid your dues.Open access is the death knell of most fly in lakes. I really don't think it's too much to ask to put measures in place to protect these outfitter lakes. Bear in mind the MNR hasn't handed out any new commercial LUP's in ON for a long time. What's here now is what we have and once they're gone, that's it, they're gone. We're talking about protecting an entire industry here, not simply restricting access to only those with money.And just to re-emphasize the point, anyone can access these lakes by legal means and camp and fish on them to their hearts content. I myself have paddled into numerous outfitter lakes and enjoyed every one. It's simply the roads that are being restricted.Over the years I've been on countless fly in trips, and have also camped and bushwhacked into even more.As someone who enjoys both types of trips I can honestly say I wouldn't dream of driving a 4X4 or a quad into an outfitter lake. I want my kids and grandkids to be able to have the same experiences I've had.Some people are simply too self centered and short sighted."
2642289,fsz,2014-04-05 18:11:00,144,"I have been going to western quebec since 1979 as a boy. Never thru an outfitter or exclusive rights areas, always DIY trips. Thinking about a change to NWO. After looking on google earth at many of the lakes various outfitters advertise to some degree as fly in only, it seems more are accessible by road, trail, or water than the advertising lets on. My understanding is outfitters do not have exclusive rights to lakes in NWO the way they do in parts of quebec. In other words, if you can get to the lake you can fish it. I am aware there is a crown land camping fee for non-residents and that non-residents that do not use an outfitter must go by conservation limits. I am also aware in certain areas of crown land camping within a certain distance of a lake (outfitters lobbied for this to discourage DIYers). Not sure if this applies everywhere (including lakes in provincal parks.) It is obvious by looking at a map there are many lakes with roads right up to them, even as you get away from the main towns. I'm sure true fly in only lakes have better fishing but I just can't believe the lakes with road or reasonable water access are completely uncomparable in fishing quality. Any perspective or info you do it yours selfers- can offer is appreciated. Thanks, FSZ"
2643185,Mike Borger,2014-04-05 21:54:00,1554,Many fly in lakes in Ontario have roads close to them. In most cases there are restrictions put in place by the MNR where they cannot be used to access the outfitter lakes.
2644041,Golden Eagle,2014-04-06 08:42:00,2642,"Fly in lakes with camps are not the only lakes with great fishing. Go by canoe or use a 4wd to gain access to great fishing. Locals won't travel far for a short limit of walleyes. Travel just a bit further than most fishermen and you'll be into great fishing. It's not easy and it takes time, but it's rewarding. It'll take over your life and you won't be able to hold a full-time job, meaning you'll need to be a school teacher or maybe have a rich mother. In 1960 my wife and I drove our Austin Healey Sprite to the Chapleau area and spent 7 weeks camping and fishing. I became acquainted with a lot of locals and we explored several fishing spots when I returned in later years with an old car that carried a boat on it's roof. These days I'm riding in Beavers, Otters and Caravans. No more dragging boats and carrying motors through the bush. I never had the urge to make my way into a fly in lake (that had a camp) without paying and I wasn't cheated on the fishing success."
2644649,zeebee,2014-04-06 11:41:00,1144,Look into the Quetico/Boundary waters area. Lots of info and well marked and groomed camp sites and portages. World class canoeing/camping/fishing.
2644889,Pooch,2014-04-06 13:54:00,4619,"Agree with OP. First fly in we landed and there was a small village across the bay that was accessed by rail. So much for remoteness.......There is a lot of good fishing camps that also have a outpost or camping area. And! They are on some very good lakes. Many of the camps on Lac Seul also have a cabin stashed away in the more remote areas of that lake that you access by boat only. Consider something like that.There are just so many different options out there. Pick a couple that crank your carrot and post them on this forum. You'll get honest feedback from most of us.The above post is correct in that many lakes, even close to roads are closed to outside access. Some were flyin camps before the road was extended and the MNR has protected them and the fishery by limiting access to only the camps that were there before the road. Which seems fair, to some extent. If I were an outfitter adn had built a remote camp and had to fly everything in to function, I'd be pretty unhappy if there was suddenly road access to the same lake.It's a different world in Canada with the slow growth rates for fish. The resource really is fragile and needs protection.Just a thought.Pooch"
2644897,speckmaster,2014-04-06 13:57:00,17,"Most of the fly in lakes in NW Ontario that have roads near them have special restrictions surrounding them. Like someone mentioned, certain roads cannot be used to access these lakes and in certain areas a motorized vehicle cannot be used within a specific distance of the lake. If you get caught breaking these rules, your equipment will probably be confiscated"
2644985,fsz,2014-04-06 14:23:00,144,"Thanks for all the input guys. Should have specified were not really into the canoe thing, we fish out of 14' car toppers or square stern canoe with motors, so quetico is out. Looking at west english river provincal park. I'm thinking camping is allowed there, I mean why else would it be labeled a provinval park, right? I know at least one outfitter operates on one of the lakes in the park, but I would think that lake is open for public access because its in a provincal park. Anyone ever set up a spike camp in west english river?"
2645097,BreezyPoint,2014-04-06 15:09:00,1581,West English River Provincial Park is in a ' green zone'. That means non residents are not permitted to camp there.Here is a link to a difficult to read map showing this...http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodcons...l02_178735.pdf
2646369,roscoe33,2014-04-06 22:14:00,653,"We used to camp on Crown land years ago. 12 miles west of Upsala Ontario, Graham road north, about 50k north, to the north end of Pakashkan lake, there is a large clearing for camping. Huge lake to explore. 10 more lakes within a couple miles. A few miles north is North Alley lake, has a small clearing for camping, and an outhouse of sorts. Also has a small camp area on an island, frequented by moose hunters. Fish this lake before July, or the weeds get bad. And a few miles south is a river, that heads into 3 lakes. There is some great fishing on all of these waters. These are walleye and northern waters. No smallies, muskies, or trout."
2648073,Wawajake,2014-04-07 10:33:00,413,"You have to realize that this website has a LOT of lodge owners or operators on it, and many of them have selfishly misled the Ontario Government about how much locals were using the lakes that they then convinced the MNR to close to locals (except if you are willing to carry a canoe in thru the trees) This despite the fact that many of these lakes have old logging roads or previous access roads that were there for many many years and locals fished for years and years without ""outfishing them"" because they adhered to MNR fishing rules just like lodge owners are supposed to. BUT some of these roads are now blocked. Also in the Sault Ste Marie area it has been proven that many a MNR employee (and retired ones) mysteriously now have remote classification for their camps. Much deception has occurred to crown land lakes that belong to the public not the lodge owners. So please grumble as loud as possible , because the locals fishermen will support you tourists ability to have a fishing experience on Canada's crown land lakes............its the lodgeowners that won't. And feel free to get in where you can because the MNR are few and far between and at most you will get a riled up lodge owner claiming he owns the lake your on( which he does not!). The locals are fighting this tooth and nail and MPP's are getting an ear full again this spring, I imagine it is even worse in North western ontario."
