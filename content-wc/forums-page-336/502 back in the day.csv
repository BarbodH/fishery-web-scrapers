I guess bears don't !@$% in the woods? LOl Ditto on the no drinkies before heading onto the 502 thougjh after crossing the border there is a decent rest area though just after getting onto 502 on your right as previously stated. That will cut off about half hour off the between times at least 'til Dryden"
2667313,jimmie,2014-04-11 15:51:00,123,I two have seen more moose there just after getting out of Sioux Lookout in fact and near Ojibway Park Only one to date on the 502 but that was around 2:30 am. Thank goodness I was going up a hill and could get slowed to nearly stop while she glaxed back at me but kept walking in front until she found a trail. She was bigger than my truck!! See fox all the time on 502. Do not believe I have seen any bear on 502 but one again by the park on 72 and a few north of the Sioux on my way to deception Bay landing.
2674433,LoDo,2014-04-13 18:16:00,721,I see more moose between Ear Falls and Red Lake on the 102 then anywhere I've been. Driving through there after dark is super sketchy and you best have four eyes on the road IMO.
2676386,bus33,2014-04-14 09:02:00,289,"We always time it so we cross the border at sun up then hit 502 on our trek to Ear Falls. I love that stretch especially during sun up. Like others have said, thats when I really get into Canada mode."
2676521,bones82,2014-04-14 09:40:00,121,"We use to take 502 when we fished that direction. We head up 71 now. We usually drive through the night and cross at International Falls at 3am. Usually only a few cars to contend with at that time. You can start to see daylight by 4:00 if I remember correctly. The stretch from Cloquette to International Falls is a long, brutal stretch in the dark. The blood starts flowing again at the border with the anticipation of wetting a line in 5-6 hours and the sunrise right around the corner. I'm a bit nervous about the ice being out for the opener, but have faith that the English River will open quickly."
2680289,Lake Wisconsin,2014-04-15 07:30:00,1960,"I have driven 502 many times, and often at least one way at night. Lots of moose to be aware of - usually keep the speed between 50-60 mph. But on another note, I saw an accident that I will never forget. A surburban from IL was flying, most say 75+mph down 502. Lost control on one of the curvy hills and smashed into the rock on the side of the road. Driver and one of the kids had sheets over them, assuming they were killed. 2 other adults were weeping, and 2 other kids the same. Gear all over the place. On this road, speed for sure kills. Please make sure that you are not going past your limits of your ability or your truck."
2682809,packpro,2014-04-15 17:19:00,695,"Couple of thoughts on 502. On my very first trip at about 2AM were we about 15 miles from Dryden. One of the guys was a veteran so he brought a hand held spot light. We could see the green glow of an eye up in front of us running parallel to our path. All of a sudden the green glow makes a left hand turn right in our path. At the time we were driving a little Chevy S-10. I think we could have gotten the hood under the large bull. It was shining in the headlights about 6 feet in front of the lead car. Just about the time we caught our breath a smaller cow was following. Quite a first 502 experience.Years later we were delayed due to a fuel pump replacement that was required mid trip. We were on 502 at sun up instead of the middle of our usual middle of the night crossing. At about the same area off in the distance we see a car pulled over in the other lane. Knowing how desolate that stretch of road is we decided to pull up and make sure everything was OK. We are focused on the car, but no one is out of the vehicle. As we looked above the car there is a rock ledge cantilevered out over the shoulder of the road. On top of the ledge their is a rather large black bear just laying prone on it's stomach. With it's head right on the edge of the ledge it was a casual observer of the intermittent passers by.Years later I had a GMC Denali XL that I traded in. That SUV made 8 trips up 502 in four years. I won't lie, if we could see far enough ahead we were ""slightly"" over the speed limit. Also at those speeds, we would have to swing out into the opposing lanes (remember, we could see far enough ahead) and dive into the corners. The lesson here is that was just stupid due to the safety concerns. Secondarily, I had some front end issues right before I traded it in. I got a quote from the dealer and just about everything needed replaced $3,700. Traded it in, and learned my lesson.Stories for another day......running out of gas/ drinking gas. Missing a turn and driving up the railroad track ."

Seems like we Americans get updates on distances to nearest city/town every 10 miles. You are lucky to get an update every 100km in Ontario. The 502 is a beautiful drive. The trees, rock, bright blue water, and windshield full of guts. Love it! I can't think of a time throughout the year where I'm more excited then the minute we pull into Chimo Air in Red Lake."

I like 3 full days of fishing at least so on Wed after work we head up.Last year I believe we pulled into my buddies house in Hudson at 2:30am.The drive was fine, but I did have a quick minute of my butthole puckering up.....Cruising in my brand new 2013 Ram 1500 Laramie with my buddies boat. He was sleeping and I saw a big black blob next to a sign. I saw the giant paddles on a moose's head raise up off the ground and turn his head towards the road. I put on the binders! The black blob was his giant *** as he was facing away from the truck. I couldn't slow down fast enough, but as I went by he turned his head. I thought he was gonna take out my mirror. His back was at my roof line lol! I was definatly sleepy but was wide away after that. My buddy riding shotgun had eyes the size of baseballs haha! All I could think of was NOOOOOOO!!!!! By far the biggest bull moose I have ever seen. That is something I will never forget. Doing the same thing this fourth of July weekend this year. I will probably be going alot slower! lol"

Apparently two guys hauling boats going in opposite directions had their trailer tires collide with each other on a curve. No one was hurt, but those trailers had seen their last Canada trip. I can't imagine the shock of that collision. I bet that woke 'em up. After seeing that I hug the shoulder when cornering on that road."

Knocking out lights and reflectors on the trailer and chipping the paint on the boat. We started taking 71 and have done so for many years. All of my old crew that used to go on 502 is gone. Maybe I need to take this new crew up there and try it again.

Amazing views of Lake Superior, incredible rock formations, and that feeling of leaving civilization behind and heading into the northern wilderness. Rt. 631 from White River up through Hornepayne to where it connects with Rt. 11 not too far west of Hearst. That road is straight up desolate. We've parked the RV along that road a few times to spend the night .... I think we could have just parked in the road and nobody would have driven by all night."
2524826,tv4fish,2014-03-06 13:23:00,2694,"I DO believe you are thinking of the one ""wayside rest"" area that is not very far north of its (502) intersection with Hwy. 11. On the east side of the Hwy."
2466545,Carnhzkr,2014-02-19 10:20:00,964,"I've only gotten one speeding ticket in Canada. It was maybe 20 years ago on 11 west of FF. The patrolman said something like, ""I guess it's up to you if you pay it or not"", meaning because I'm a US citizen. I wasn't really sure what that meant. I ended up calling some Canadian police office to ask if I actually needed to pay the fine. The message I got was that I didn't really have to pay it, but if I got checked crossing through Canadian customs, they'd see I had an outstanding fine. The statute of limitations on a speeding ticket was five years. Needless to say, I sent in my check. As far as 502, I'm one of those jerks flying by the guys pulling boats. Whenever I come to the top of a hill and I can see two miles in the distance, I use gravity to my advantage and usually push it to 70+."

Rather than heading into Dryden, this route takes you through the little village of Eagle River and comes out at the bait / gift shop along 17, just before you cross the Eagle River bridge. I was convinced this route was a good 10 - 15 minutes faster, but anymore, I'm not so sure it is. This route is paved, except for a two-mile stretch. There might be a quicker route if you take one of the gravel roads going north before you get to Eagle River, but I don't mess with it anymore."

In 1986 while heading to Lac Suel for the long weekend a big doe found the front of my 85 Toyota pickup taking out the radiator, lights etc. Don't remember the name anymore, but there is a logging road running east and a smaller tote road west. Backed into the logging road and thumbed a ride back to the Fort Frances customs. My lady stayed in the vehicle to make sure no one helped themselves to the boat and stuff. They were very helpful---by now it was 10:00 p.m. and they told me they knew the bar the one guy who would tow me was at!!! They called him and he showed up an hour later and we headed up the road. He got us back to the old I Falls Holiday Inn at 2:00 a.m. for $110.00. It was a pretty exciting drive. I was a bit worried about U.S. customs as he had had quite a few, it seemed but they knew him. Been up many times since without problems. Still a nice drive especially when there is no road work. Lots of fun lakes not far off the road too."

The existing Highway 812 extended north from Highway 11 for approximately 50 kilometres (30 mi), and so work began to extend it north the remaining 100 kilometres (62 mi). During construction, the route was referred to as the Manitou Road. It was completed in the fall of 1980 and designated Highway 502"
2496162,Musky Husky,2014-02-27 12:27:00,4,"I agree with what many have posted about 502. It is a beautiful drive and great scenery, but I do not fly down that road anymore. In July of 2011 on our annual trip up to Ontario we were heading north up 502 when about half way up to Drydeb we see a police car stopped right in the middle of the road not allowing any cars to pass. Come to find out about 1/2 a mile up a Chevy Suburban and a boat had went off the road into the woods. The boat was about a 20 foot Skeeter bass boat on a tandem axkle trailer that was torn to pieces with multiple flat tires. The Suburban was so far back in the woods they had to cut the trees down so they could pull the truck out of the woods. The police officier explained to us that he was not letting anybody pass because the tow truck's cable could snap and injure someone. I am not sure if anybody was seriously injured, but I respect that highway and do not fly through there anymore. I also have no desire to drive it at night."
2464097,tv4fish,2014-02-18 15:22:00,2694,"Nope - You're NOT the only one. One of my group also hates it - he tries his best to sleep through that stretch, especially on the way home as we leave at about 5:00 a.m. from Sioux Lookout -- very seldom does he succeed."

Came back up it yesterday from a short trip to the southlands, it was snowing, with a few inches on the pavement, was shocked to meet a snow plow about a 1/3 of the way from the north end. The highway crew's track record for not plowing has been well documented this winter. The road has been snow covered since mid November, no telling how the pavement is holding up under it, as always, it will be a surprise this spring."

I remember seeing off on the shoulders the old remains of the old 105 highway. I think you can still see parts of it once in a while. Anyone remember seeing the old remains?
2464513,NARDA 1,2014-02-18 17:15:00,636,I would like the 502 a lot more if they increased the speed limit. It seems to take forever when you are that close to the lodge.

2466425,jimmie,2014-02-19 09:30:00,123,"I traveld the 72 to longbow crossing 71/17 when it was still gravel part way in the 60's the I too heard about 502. I have since used that road despite the construction, recontruction, washouts and occassional moose. How ever the route going the west side is actullay much smoother with less curves and tar next to the water and rickety wooded bridges. The distance is now only about 10 miles further that going east thru dryden back to V. Bay. I like you prefer the more rustic 502 but I'm usually heading to Sioux Lookout and no longer Eagle as I did in the early days. Even the repatch areas that might have once tossed your battery out of your boat and offered a few flat tires ( too many are in too big of a hurry even to this day) are nearly gone! Yeah!! I'll be giving 502 my tire tracks in less than 20 weeks. Hate these long winters more each year. I do love fishing in NW Ontario though!! See ya there!"
2466449,jimmie,2014-02-19 09:43:00,123,Speed kills you know. I understand but enjoy the two hour drive. I am always intrigued by the uinspoiled nature eventhough that is going away slowly but surely as what we call progress ensues. I make the trip at leat once but normally two times and one year I made the trip four times. It's all part of the adventure and I have done it alone almost 40 times in the past 20 years. I find myself going 40 at times and have to slow down when heading down hill more often that I should. Still not my favorite part of the adventure but hopefulluly the fishies will bring a bigger amile to my face.
2466457,Lovetofish,2014-02-19 09:48:00,458,Last trip up for me I had to follow a warden pulling a boat. Needless to say he wasn't in any hurry and I was Chicken Little to pass. Thankfully he turned off about half way to Dryden. How fast do others drive to avoid a ticket? I believe the sign reads 80 km/h. I usually drive just under 60 mph but I don't recall ever seeing the OOP on that road.
2466489,tv4fish,2014-02-19 09:58:00,2694,"There's a speed limit on that road ??????? Sure could have fooled me! Those of us that are pulling a boat seem to get passed by the guys w/o a boat, regardless of our speed. The guys with the rod racks on top and the ones apparently going on a fly-in seem to ALWAYS fly by us - even if we hit 80 mph going down some of those hills. That's another thing - sure seems like we USED to see a lot more OPP cars patroling that road than we have in the last few years. Budget cuts, I imagine."
2466513,AllenW,2014-02-19 10:03:00,11482,"Yup, they are there. Hit one running about 15 kph over and got pulled over, didn't have my seat belt on correctly either, which he noticed and things didn't look good. Then when pulling my drivers license out he noticed my carry permit and he became even more concerned. I told him while I may have been missing the speed limit, I didn't miss Canada's gun laws and my carry gun was home. Which ended up in a long conversation on carry and guns, he being against, me for. Turns out he shoots IPSC and I do too, conversation went to the shooting sports and he got a call and told me to wear my belt correctly and mind the speed limit or next time it'd be a ticket. Hard to go their speed limit as it could easily be 10 or 15 mph faster, so I use cruise control a lot. Don't see many, but they are there. Al"
2462673,Bakefish,2014-02-18 08:06:00,1077,"It used to be that when we would travel to Ear Falls we would have to jog west out of Ft. Francis on 11 and then head north on 71 until we reached 17, at which point we'd head back east until we hit 105, and then north to Ear Falls. It was a brutal drive. Nothing quick about it. Then we started hearing rumors of a new highway going in that would cut right up through the middle, eliminating that trip west and then back east. 502 was to become a reality. One year we heard that the road had been cut and was well under construction. We figured that it was perhaps our last driving the circuitous route we've been driving for years. While in Ear Falls we'd heard tales that a brave soul could make it through 502 if they didn't mind gravel road the entire way. That's all we needed. We found the unmarked road and decided to give it a shot, not knowing for sure if the road even went all the way through.There were pockets of construction all the way through, but otherwise it was clear sailing. We didn't see another vehicle going in either direction, except for construction crews. The gravel road was as smooth as you could ask for since there was little traffic using it. We were hauling one of those little U-Hauls that we rented in Illinois. It was brand new when we got it, but the gravel pounding the front of the trailer shot blasted all of the paint off of it and gave the metal a nice orange peel finish to it. The trailer came with two nice plastic cone hubcaps. It was returned with two well beaten rims that once held coned hubcaps. The gravel ate the cones. We made great time, probably better than we have since it's been paved. So I have the unique claim that I was one of the first to travel 502. Unlike many, I love that road to this day. It's not as remote as it was before all the lodges started sprouting up, but to me it is what Canada is all about."
2462889,tv4fish,2014-02-18 08:33:00,2694,"Over the past few years we have really noticed a decrease in the logging trucks - kind of a sign of the economy, I guess. I kind of chuckle every time we come upon a sizable ""dip"" in that road -- you can see the black ""wheel marks"" from the dolly wheels on the tongue of the boat trailers.For many years - it seemed like that road was ALWAYS ""under construction""."
2463409,Pooch,2014-02-18 10:50:00,4619,I agree that 502 is a pretty drive. With drive being a key word. You have to actually drive and not day dream on that stretch.

If we are lucky try to snap pictures of wildlife if they do not interfere with our march North. However always keep your finger crossed for NO CONSTRUCTION. A couple years back we waited 45 minutes for the flag truck to lead us South. Yes it is quite the road."

Since then it's become our normal route however, a few years back, on a whim, we turned west at Vermilion Bay on our trip home and took 17 back. It brought back lots of memories and we enjoyed seeing the communities we drove through. We enjoyed it enough I think we may continue to do it on occasion just for a change."

I always find myself doing the metric conversion countdown in my head when I see the signs - Dryden 120 KM, Dryden 100 KM, Dryden 80 KM... I always get overanxious and press my speed when I come to the crest of a hill and can see a mile or two in the distance. One of these days, I'm going to pay for that.I do enjoy the scenic S curve on the south end when you cross the bridge over Red Gut bay (I think that's Red Gut).I always watch for Preacher Creek. I let my mind wander and imagine the story behind how it got it's name. I'll bet Jack London could have written a good book about that story.Do you do like me and imagine what's at the end of each of those small trails you see heading off to the east or west? Wouldn't it be fun to explore those with a four-wheeler and a spinning rod?To pass the time, I count the Iowa license plates. I'm always amazed that there's anyone left in Iowa. I swear the entire state heads to Ontario the same week as as I do.Hey, come to think of it, I guess I do enjoy that stretch, but if you get passed by a black F150, it's probably me."
