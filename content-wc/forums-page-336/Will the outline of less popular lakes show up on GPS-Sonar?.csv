2660777,bushead11,2014-04-09 22:34:00,151,I just bought an Elite 7 HDI for my boat and want to take it to Canada in May. I usually have a handheld Garmin GPS for navigation and it worked great to this point. My question is: If I purchase the Hot Maps chip will the body of water we fish show up as a body of water on the Lowrance or just a big land blob? My goal would be to have the Lowrance GPS take the place of the garmin since the main purpose would be navigation not contours. Im taking it either way because I really want to use the down imaging and color sonar out of the upgraded camp boat. Cant imagine I'm the only guy with this issue...

2661537,3M TA3,2014-04-10 07:14:00,2846,Regardless if the lakes are on the map be sure to leave trails and plant lots of weigh points. It will help you stay out of trouble later and of course help you get back on the fish once you find them. Still a great tool even if the lake isn't on the map.
2661561,bushead11,2014-04-10 07:25:00,151,"We are fishing the woman river a little south east of Red Lake. Looking at the Hot Maps Premium Canana chip. There are tons of Islands, back bays and fingers that go on forever. With the garmin I can at least see where I am headed. If I use the Lorance and all I see is a brown screen it doesnt do much good unless we use the ""track"" feature and litterally go back exactly the same way we came... I have marked waypoints on the Garmin for fising spots but see how I could do it with the lowrance as well... that will be helpful once we reach where we are going. I will try to add some screenshots of what I am looking for the lowrance t"

2661881,SinOrSwim,2014-04-10 08:13:00,1528,"The outline of the lake will probably show up regardless of whether you have the chip or not. We went to North adn South Gull for years and never had a map chip. The outline of the lake showed up on the GPS. Granted, it was not accurate and many times it looked like I was on land. But, it still helped me mark points to fish and where the cabin was. In addition there was a couple places I marked multiple way points as I navigated through a rocky area. It allowed me to buzz through there pretty fast after that."
2662161,bushead11,2014-04-10 08:51:00,151,Here is a screen shot of my garmin handheld. I have the cananda topo map loaded so it shows the contours of land and gives me the outline of the lakes for navigation. this thing has been spot on.Want to see if the canada Hot maps premium will give me similar water/vs land outline just for navigation and marking waypoints on the Lowrance instead of the handheld.
2662361,adempsey,2014-04-10 09:19:00,963,"The lake outlines never showed on my Garmin eTrex. However, I am not sure I had all the proper map layers showing (I am pretty sure you can have multiples displaying or switch between them with the settings). I only had my lake map chip active. So, if the lake wasn't on the map chip it doesn't show up at all. They don't show on my Navionics phone app either.Honestly, this to me is a no brainer and Lowrance/Garmin etc.. really need to at least put the outlines of all lakes on their map chips."
2669849,rnnonmt,2014-04-12 11:13:00,992,I found this area on my canadian hotmaps that I have on my Ipad and unfortunately Woman river is nothing more than what google earth looks like.
2681609,skap,2014-04-15 11:53:00,58,"First off, congrats on on the new sonar. I have that same unit and love it.I live in MN but fish quite a bit in the Sioux Lookout area. I purchased the Navionics north chip and it does have depth contours for the lakes I fish up there. The only thing is that its more of a base map and only shows the depths in a color gradient and by 10 foot increments, not 1 foot detail. For me that was fine as I really just wanted it for navigation as much as anything. I just make sure I mark all the hazard spots as I travel by for future reference.If you are at a Cabelas, they can insert the chips into the display models so you can see what detail there is for your area before you purchase it. Kind of nice to see it in advance as the chips are not returnable.Hope this helps at least a little.Good luck all, spring will be here soon!"
