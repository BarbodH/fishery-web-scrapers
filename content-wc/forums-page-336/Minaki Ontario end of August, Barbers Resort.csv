I expect we'll have a great trip, anyone care to share their experience fishing this area or staying at Barbers? I'm also trying to convince my friend Tim to go with us, if you can give any feedback that would help me get Tim on board I'd sure appreciate it. John"

2636041,briand,2014-04-04 07:31:00,48,That is one of the best times for solitude. Very few cottagers and tourists. The fishing should be amazing.As well that time of year ...NO BUGS
