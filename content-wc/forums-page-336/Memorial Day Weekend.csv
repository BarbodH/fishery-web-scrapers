We went a couple of years ago. Caught fish, probably a bigger average, but not as many. Weather was not good. Is that typical or have some of you had great trips. Ear Falls area."

It all depends on so many variables, weather being a main one. Nobody can say that a certain week is always good, or bad, too many differences from year to year. That being said, we go up at that time, because we feel it is better for us. We have always caught many fish, it is just a matter of how many. Last year ice went off 3 days before we got there, we still caught many fish, but not as many as some years past. Some years the fish average a bigger size, some years not. Good fishing and tight lines."
2654481,jimmie,2014-04-08 17:25:00,123,I took my landlord up in 2002 I think and it was cold rainy with some sun a cpl days. Every year since it has been better weather than that during Mem Day time. We saw ice where there was runoff on the rocks but none in the lake. Caught a few fish but he forgot rain hood. The type that takes things apart so he'll know whre they are kind of guy. Then he can never find them. Had a good time though and great warm place to stay at Anderson's. I go every year in July!! Make a 2nd trip in August too.

A couple of cold cloudy windy days and a couple days of blue skies! Bring along plenty of wet and cold weather gear and you will be fine!"

As wallydave said, be prepared clothing wise for anything - from fishing in snow or rain to a blazing sun so hot you want to get into the shade! We've seen it all that week, but the fishing is usually great.Enjoy your trip."
