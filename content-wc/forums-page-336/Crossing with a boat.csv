2647857,3M TA3,2014-04-07 09:58:00,2846,"I can't say I know for sure if insurance is required but if it was then it would seem to me that it would be one of those questions that the crossing agent would be asking, and I've never been asked. Never. I own several boats and two of them see Ontario waters regularly. One is insured and one isn't. Seems that liability insurance for the clunker ought to be pretty cheap and after more than 40 years without incident maybe my luck is running out. Perhaps I'll shop around."
2647897,Andre (wallyandre),2014-04-07 10:03:00,2274,The answer is: No
2649073,BreezyPoint,2014-04-07 14:15:00,1581,"But, I would get insurance anyway. I had my boat accident on Lake of the Woods and my insurance company took great care of me. They even sent an investigator to Morson to meet with me and interview the witnesses (fortunately for me, there were probably close to a dozen witnesses).This accident involved serious injuries to the occupant of the other boat and my insurance company had my back all the way. Without insurance I would have been on my own.An accident can happen anywhere, even on vast Lake of the Woods, even if one is very careful.In my case, I was stopped in the water 50 feet in front of the docks, when I was t-boned at high speed. There was nothing I could do to prevent it.I am sure most people would recommend getting insurance. It isn't that expensive."
2649217,benn,2014-04-07 14:45:00,48,"Your HO insurance should cover liability for your motor, as it is only 20hp. Most companies provide automatic liability for outboards less than 50hp. Some will even cover more hp. Mine provides automatic liability for up to 250hp! There is also some physical damage coverage for watercraft, but usually limited to $2000 and for only specific perils."
2642689,bigcreekdad,2014-04-05 19:25:00,74,"I've been taking my boat 2-3 times a year for 20 years. Never had a problem. The only suggestion I might add is to not have the boat covered when you cross. This sometimes results in a search. No big deal if they do, but it can hold you up. Have fun, and report back."
2642865,btyreprich,2014-04-05 20:16:00,1067,"I do not agree that you should take the boat cover off. Most all boats I see crossing the boarder in my 37 years of fishing have covers on. Like previous poser have mentioned, you should: 1. Have passports ready 2. Answer all questions honestly and don't joke around 3. Have registration for boat & trailer readily available - along with proof of insurance. Enjoy your trip!"
2643489,bigcreekdad,2014-04-06 05:57:00,74,"It was just a suggestion to remove the cover before crossing. I've crossed well over 50 times, and have seen instances of covered boats ahead of me get inspected. Your call entirely."
2643713,CI_Guy,2014-04-06 07:18:00,2118,I've been asked to take the cover off my boat by US customs but never by the Canadians. When I took the cover off they spent a few seconds looking in the boat then sent us on our way.
2643801,mms3rd,2014-04-06 07:35:00,148,"Thanks. I doubt I have any ownership papers that I could find on the boat...have 'em on the motor.I assume you make sure the boat is super clean....I was partly worried about this carrying invasive species in stuff.When I cross, I so often see a group of boats pulled over to the side. Maybe they are just taking a pee.Thanks again."
2643881,cruiseforever,2014-04-06 08:15:00,177,I have never removed the cover. But it has sent me to the X-ray truck a few times.
2644001,Bill Krejca,2014-04-06 08:35:00,6107,"Occasionally, they'll ask to lift up some of the cover, usually undo a snap or two. I think the reason is more to make sure no one is hiding in the boat than anything else. If I was a border official, I probably would get a little bored doing the exact same thing, same question, etc., all day long, so varying the activity is probably in order. Gives us all something to chat about while waiting for the polar thickness to melt! Bill"
2644025,Andre (wallyandre),2014-04-06 08:41:00,2274,"Exactly that.I cross the border around 80 times per season (from March to December)My boat registration, trailer, truck and insurance paper are all plastified on the same sheet. I give my passeport with the plastified sheet and never have any problem"
2646937,mms3rd,2014-04-07 06:57:00,148,"Unless it is part of my homeowners policy, I have never had insurance on my boat and never even thought of it.Now, the boat and motor right now are probably not worth more than $7500.Does Canada require people coming in to have insurance on the boats? I assume their concern would be for liability if I hit somebody.....not if I hit a rock and blow the boat up. I've never been asked about insurance on the car....maybe I read too much into this.....How many of you have boat insurance? Guess I should call my agent."
2647625,camp chef,2014-04-07 09:14:00,915,Boat insurance is cheap. I wouldn't think twice about getting it.
2640033,mms3rd,2014-04-05 07:34:00,148,"I have never taken my boat across the border into Canada (smaller Tracker with 20 horse). But for one place I like, the price difference is very big if you bring your own boat.Can you give me some tips on how to cross with a boat without too many hassles? I've only been held up on the border once (going in) and it was a pain. I also got held up coming back to the states when I tried to bring a stick back....planned to make a walking stick for a friend....shees....after the ag inspector reviewed it, I was allowed to bring the stick into the country. Guess it's a bug thing."
2640105,Gregking,2014-04-05 07:46:00,2658,Not a big deal. They will ask: What's your business inn Canada How long is your stay Who's the owner of the boat Who's the owner of the pickup Any live bait Any weapons Anything you are selling in Canada Roll down all windows and remove sunglasses. Answer questions directly. Have passports opened to page Hope this helps
2640137,h8go4s,2014-04-05 07:52:00,1673,"I've crossed several times with a boat with a travel cover on it and never had a problem. No different than without a boat as long as you know the rules and follow them. Take your hat and sunglasses off, have your passports ready, be sober, be polite, don't lie and don't try to be a comedian.The one time we got stopped returning to the US was when we were trying to beat a snowstorm home and hit the border at about 2 AM. The customs guys probably were bored, so they put us in a little room while they went through the truck. But they didn't even pull the cover off the boat and we were on our way half an hour later. Good luck."
2640233,Guest,2014-04-05 08:08:00,0,I've crossed at least a 1000 times for business and pleasure at the Soo and have never been asked who the owner of anything was or if I was selling anything in Canada. Almost every time I was also asked whether I carried any tobacco or alcohol. I guess it depends on where you are crossing.
2640249,Guest,2014-04-05 08:10:00,0,Oh yeah. Never had a passport. Just an enhanced DL.
2640441,CI_Guy,2014-04-05 08:52:00,2118,"Just answers the questions honestly without any extra info. I've been asked if I planned on leaving the boat in Canada a couple of times, but not really much different from crossing without a boat. Once I was asked how I knew everyone in the truck."
2641969,packpro,2014-04-05 16:52:00,695,"Crossed last year for the first time with a boat. No questions at all about the boat or ownership. Had all my papers with me just in case, but it was completely painless. Just the standard questions detailed in the earlier posts."
2642081,@Lunker,2014-04-05 17:14:00,835,"I've never ever been asked a single question about my boat. I do, however, make sure I have a copy of the registration, and proof of insurance. ( knock on wood )"
2642377,CSH Kucinski,2014-04-05 18:26:00,1340,I have never had an issue taking my boat back and fourth across the border. Just be polite and answer all questions honestly.
2642425,ftfarms,2014-04-05 18:42:00,444,It's never been I proplem for me either. I took it the first two times with no license plate cause it fell off. Neither country said a word. Oh and I didn't have the ill sticker or numbers on it either.
