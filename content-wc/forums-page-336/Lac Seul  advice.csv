2643289,jimmie,2014-04-06 00:03:00,123,"Ditto on all the advice that has been offered. I prefer to use 1/hat are multicolored mostly orange with a hint of yellow, pink and white.May not be the best choice for some but I tip it with a 3"" white curly tail and a piece of crawler. You may catch 'eyes, perch, pike, smallies and even a Musky as I have but the hot weather I use a whie beetle spin 1/4 ounce and toss by any clump of weeds as the eyes are there to keep cooler and I'm there to try and catch 'em. I have noticed that my choice of jigs (Northland) now have the red hooks and I have had even better luck with those. This year I am hoping to try thr Lindy Lil' Guy crawler harness. You'll like ly notice that the guides use Lindy Little Joe rigs as much as anything too and minnows on them. Crawlers would likely work as well. Just do not stay in one spot too long if they are not biting move on and do not be afraid to try different lures and even retrieve techniques. I bring at least 4 poles along each day with them ready to go. I have two wiith jigs and one with bettle spin and another ready to snap on a crank of some sort. Regardless of your choices if you do not catch 'eyes on L:ac Seul you'll likely never catch one anywhere else. Good luck and enjoy the area. I think it's awesome. I wish I could live to be 2,000 years old and have my health to get a chance to fish all the nooks and crannies of 10/11 bodies of water in the immediate area of Sioux Lookout. I have fished the eastern area the most and have yet to scratch the surface that began more than 15 years ago and more than 40 trips. If you find a few hot spots do not be surprised if they are cool next year. Just a side note my first year I came upon a small flat just around the corner and a bay passed Deception Landing so I put in my jig and caught 49 fish in two hours. I labled it hole 49 because I tried for another 1/2 hour to get #50 and again later that day to no avail. Since then each year I give it a try and in the next 35 trips or more I have not totaled a dozen more. A flat about 15' up from 50-60' feet of water. AAnother time I caught a 23,24,25"" fish in a row in less than 15 minutes in 22 feet just at the entrance to the back channel leading to Sen Bay. JMjust get a good map if you fish this area and stay the course in the middle of most paths and you'll do fine. Keep an eye out for log debris just past Loon Rapids. Above all else enjoy your time in this region and it would not hurt to give Him thanks!"
2651025,NWE,2014-04-07 20:35:00,13,"Can't go wrong with a 1/8 or 3/16 Northland jig, chartreuse and yellow. 6"" from the bottom off structure or pitching with a slow retrieve. Works every time."

I have plenty of Lindy rigs,bouncers,spinners and cranks.I'm weak on the jig selection.Also would it be a good idea to bring crawlers up for then?Any help would be appreciated.My father just had a tumor and kidney removed.I want to take him to Lac Seul this summer.Besides he is a big fish ""magnet"".Thanks Bill"

572198,Jimmy Jig,2008-03-17 10:21:00,1905,"At that time of the year the fish can be deeper that June/July. I think 3/8 oz. jig heads and a few 1/2 oz. will be the best. Chartreuse and Flor.Red work the best for me. Leaches, nightcrawler or minnow to tip them with. The new Gulp in a Pail I have not tried yet, the regular Gulp has never out fished live bait for me. You can catch fish with it but not as good. Crawlers can be imported but must be in worm bedding. Leaches and minnows can not be imported from US."

572247,Guest,2008-03-18 05:40:00,0,"I have fished that area a few times. If you do not want to bring the crawlers, call ahead to Four Seasons Bait Shop in Ear Falls and make sure you will have a flat waiting for you. Late in the season they seem to run out of leeches (at least big ones) but they should not be out of crawlers but it is good to call ahead. When you consider what you pay at home for the crawlers, and then the extra for the bedding, it is not much more then buying from Four Seasons. My favorite bait up there is a 1/4 ounce jig with a matching chartreuse or orange 3"" Gulp with a small piece of crawler for a little added scent. If you need to go deeper then 20' then you might want to use a 3/8th. Also, buy your spinners from Four Seasons. You need both on the water as it changes day to day what they are hitting. Four Seasons has a great supply of spinners at a very reasonable price. They sell these spinners and they are about the best I have used. I am too lazy to tie my own and buy them in bulk. The Chartreuse Reflecto tape and the Nickel on brass are my best bets. I use the bead chain spinners to keep them right on the bottom.http://www.klasstackle.com/"
572267,lacseulfishfry,2008-03-18 21:30:00,5,"I have guided out of Sioux Lookout for years now and one thing I have learned about August and September, is that the walleyes can be found anywhere that appears to be a prominent point sticking out into a large area of the lake, points on the outside of bays, beaches with 20 feet or more of water out in front, around current especially. The thing about Lac Seul is that the water is always moving westerly so choke points or funnnels are good features to look for. I have found many fishing spots by just fishing the points until I found structure that was holding fish. Now without getting too technical, using a graph can speed up the process. You do not need one since most times when you find walleyes, they will bite. Every trip up here should be regarded as a learning experience. I have a saying in Guide Training... You have to ""Burn to Learn"". Each time you return you will have gained more experience and more knowledge. Confidence comes with experience and knowledge. I can offer you plenty of support. Bits of info at a time would be good for you. Spinners and minnows are fast and great ways for covering water(shoreline) looking for schools of walleyes. I hope you trust this info and please feel free to ask for more. Over the years I have many guests in the boat around your father's age. I know how hard it can be on people when they think they will never make another trip to Canada. I take great pleasure in ensuring a safe, adventurous and memorable Lac Seul Adventures for people of all abilities, regardless of their age."
572340,CDNWalleyehunter,2008-03-21 15:48:00,17,"I am from Dryden, I fish lac seul alot. Half the time up in williams bay which is north of dryden. Or Scout Bay, which is by Ear Falls. My favorite time to fish lac seul is from July to October, when you get on the walleye you can catch them from 5 feet of water to 25 feet. there are spots where they suspend and I troll cranks like tail dancers and shadraps with planer boards. But if you get on them I like to use a 3/8 ounce jig to have more control in the current. Minnows work well with any jig, but I caught some of my biggest on a yellow jig with a red eye. If you are in a mix of walleye, try trolling or casting some cranks through the spot, I find it sometimes produces a 30""+ walleye. Last year my biggest walleye was caught just outside of scout bay off a shallow long reef by big island. It was a 33""walleye, and its still there to be caught again. Trust me you havn't experienced Walleye fishing until you come up to Lac Seul. If you have anymore questions email me at [email protected]"
572504,fire105,2008-03-28 12:40:00,40,"besides the walleye advise, coming out of ear falls and traveling out from under the bridge traveling out to the lake watch out for the markers, stay to the left of the red makers(rock pile) . i didnt folow those instructions last year and took out my lower unit $5000 later i will stay left of the markers."
2632921,bodono47,2014-04-03 10:47:00,5,"The placement of markers on Lac Seul has to do with current. Markers are placed so that red is on your right when going upstream, green is on the left when going upstream. It's vital you know the direction of flow in the area you are fishing.You have to know where the current direction changes, one place is around Taylor Island.Remember that ice moves these markers with ice out conditions. Sometimes they don't get back to where they were set until well into the Spring.Be careful."
2637577,MikeMcC,2014-04-04 13:15:00,72,I lost my lower unit even when on the correct side of a red marker entering Shanty Narrows from Mckenzie. Don't cut the markers close!
