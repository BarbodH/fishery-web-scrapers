2649337,Aaron-IN,2014-04-07 14:58:00,500,"The COs up there don't bother because it's not really a law they can enforce, they are normally just concerned with the fish total and size."
2662177,benn,2014-04-10 08:54:00,48,"Our group was checked on Lac Seul last year. We had 3 guys in our boat and 6 fish. 2 sport license and 1 conservation. We had eaten shore lunch earlier, but our boat did not provide any fish. The CO asked who caught the fish in our boat. We answered all of us caught some (we didn't keep track individually). They asked if we had shore lunch. We answered yes. They then asked who provided the fish for our lunch and we pointed to the other 2 boats in our group. They immediately took off and checked those boats for limits, etc. We then saw them go on shore where we ate shore lunch. After they were done, they came back to our boat and said one of the guys in the other boat got ticketed for 1 too many fish over the slot. We asked why and they said because they had a limit of ""big"" fish in their boat, they assumed at least one of the fish we ate for shore lunch was over the slot size because we couldn't prove the size of the fish we ate. (I believe the other guy said they probably cleaned an over fish for lunch) They also told us we could have the ticketed guy go to town the next day and argue before the magistrate and that they would probably reduce the amount of the fine. They also said party fishing was not legal and that was because the other guy was ticketed, because he caught and kept 2 big fish that day. They asked if we had any fish back and camp, which we didn't, but they said they might stop by and check, which they didn't. As a ""party"", we didn't have anywhere near our limit, or limit of big fish, but because one of the guys kept 2 big fish that day, they ticketed him. They do know what questions to ask and how to ask them, so if they suspect you are party fishing, they will do something about it. It is best if each boat is in control of keeping and eating their own fish."
2662601,Aaron-IN,2014-04-10 09:49:00,500,"""they assumed at least one of the fish we ate for shore lunch was over the slot size because we couldn't prove the size of the fish we ate."" I'm sure the law is different in Canada (as most are) but in the states that wouldn't hold up in court. The burden of proof is on law enforcement, not you!"
2664481,benn,2014-04-10 19:39:00,48,"Yes, he should have gone into town and fought the ticket. But I think he may have made a statement to the CO that he had kept his 1 over for shore lunch, and that would have cooked his goose! The point is, if party fishing was allowed in Ontario, he would have been ok."
2664649,tuiflies,2014-04-10 20:21:00,158,"They enforce it based on your statements or finding you with more fish than your license allows. Contrary to popular belief, the majority of outdoors folk are not practiced liars (possibly excepting the size of the one that got away). They keep asking questions and we keep answering. It doesn't take long to see when someone is not being entirely truthful and eventually, (more often than not), they come clean.Quote: Originally Posted by benn(I believe the other guy said they probably cleaned an over fish for lunch)They wouldn't just assume. They are bound by burden of proof just like any other law enforcement officer."
2664985,roscoe33,2014-04-10 22:08:00,653,Absolutely.
2664993,roscoe33,2014-04-10 22:12:00,653,"Also, during their visit of the lunch location, they may have found carcass remains, that indicated the fish size. Just curious, how much was that ticket/fine. Hopefully high enough to make their point, but not too high that it took food out of the kids mouths."
2666041,benn,2014-04-11 09:09:00,48,"They did say they were unable to find any remains, but were still going to ticket the other boat. It must have been based on a statement made by one of the guys in that boat. I don't remember the exact amount, but it was in the $250 to $300 range."
2668561,roscoe33,2014-04-12 00:50:00,653,"So that one specific walleye cost an extra $100 a pound, yikes !"
2581153,kzoofisher,2014-03-22 06:24:00,5144,"Don't know that it is specifically allowed but I've never heard of anyone getting a ticket in Michigan. Two guys in the boat and nine fish in the well you just keep fishing. In Ontario we usually stay one short of the limit (2 on the C lic) until we're ready to head in and that might qualify as party fishing for the guy who is releasing his fish. Once One of us hits our limit it is strictly c&r for him. When the kids get older and I need more fish I'll buy them their own licenses. Another thing that happens a lot in Michigan is ""gifting"" fish. You are allowed a three day limit in possession so long as two days are processed. Some guys will ""gift"" limits to their wife and kids so they can have 25 or 30 fish in the freezer. I think that is unethical as heck and possibly illegal but the odds of getting busted are extremely low. For many people that is how they judge ethics; if it isn't likely to be prosecuted it's ok. The intent of the law is quite clear, to allow anglers who take a long weekend to keep a limit every day and I'm good with that. There are some waters that can handle the extra limits very well, others not so much. If more fisherman adhered to the intent of the law rather than trying to find loopholes we would have less complex regulations. Mini rant over."
2586561,roscoe33,2014-03-23 18:30:00,653,"http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_164557.htmlPossessing more fish than permitted by your fishing licence or the fishing quota. Catch and retain and possession limits may vary by region, fisheries division, individual body of water, or even parts of a body of water. You must determine your “daily” fishing limit for the waters you intend to fish and follow these limits. Remember you may only catch your own limit – there are no provisions for “party” fishing or for excluding fish that you may have consumed or plan to consume that day.Simple, catch and keep your own limit.I know of no law that says you have to stop fishing once reaching your limit.Practicing catch and release appears to be perfectly legal.Or target another species of fish.An interesting twist in some of the Ontario fishing zones:Some areas require you to kill all fish onboard, no live fish allowed.Some areas allow keeping fish alive, but no culling.Some areas allow you to cull fish."
2591465,Bill Krejca,2014-03-24 20:58:00,6107,"A few years ago, we fished a lake in Missouri where each fish in possession had to be somehow separated from any other fisherman's in the boat. This could be done by a live well divider, clipped fin, marked in some matter, etc. I don't know if the entire state has the same rules. It was a large pita. Bill"
2595969,SteveJ715,2014-03-25 21:53:00,59,"http://www.startribune.com/local/247563501.htmlWe're talking lake trout here, and the limit was one per guy on the lake in question (on the Ontario side, anyway). Two guys fishing, one guy catches and keeps one, then the same guy catches the world record laker (on a tip-up, not overall). He keeps the trophy and gives the smaller fish to his buddy, figuring they each have one, no harm, no foul. But since the MNR had stopped to check their licenses earlier the same day and they saw he already had his limit, they busted him when they read the account of the monster laker. For our group, when it comes to walleyes, we've never worried whether one guy contributed five <18"" fish and the other guy contributed three if we could keep eight. Perhaps we should start caring. I'm curious, for the guys that have been stopped/searched, have the MNR officers asked you how many of the fish were yours individually, or did they look at your licenses to see how many you could have in the boat and just count what's on the stringer?- Steve"
2596425,tv4fish,2014-03-26 06:45:00,2694,"First off - we primarily fish Lac Seul - but, yes, we have been checked a few times and they are more concerned about the number of fish we have in the cooler and the SIZE. We have never been asked ""who caught how many"". I don't think that is even an issue."
2604522,tuiflies,2014-03-27 22:18:00,158,"I think the issue comes when one guy in a boat has 8 fish in his posession because 4 are for his buddy in another boat. The term ""party hunting"" is used (and legal in ON) to allow anyone in your group (or ""party"") to shoot an animal for one license as long as you are in communication and within 5 km of each other. This scenario is not legal for fishing in ON because there are possession limits and daily limits (which include fish caught and consumed that day or prepared for consumption later that day). If you tell a C.O. That you caught four walleye in the morning, ate them for lunch and had any more in your possession later that day, you'd get charged. No party fishing means you can't say the fish on the stringer now are for my buddy."
2612618,jWN,2014-03-29 18:55:00,62,if you have to party fish you are in the wrong place!
2612898,blink3477,2014-03-29 19:53:00,51,I think if you always stay under your group total and offload keepers into other boats in your party before you hit your boat limit you would be fine. You would probably be okay if you got stopped and were over if you could point to another boat and when he checked them they were under. We just swing over and drop off keepers to other boats we are with so there is no controversy. If you are not fishing close enough to drop off a couple keepers in your buddy's boat you aren't party fishing. We always stay one under in each boat so we can keep fishing. If you keep fishing after you are at your boat's limit the next walleye that hits the floor of the boat makes you over the limit...even if it is for 10 seconds. Stay one under if you want to continue fishing.
2646418,tuiflies,2014-04-06 23:02:00,158,I disagree. I've worked with many C.O.'s and I'm sure every one would write you up. Do not get caught with more fish in your boat than your license allows!
2646553,kzoofisher,2014-04-07 03:53:00,5144,"Few years back my friend returned to camp on the last day of fishing to find CO's there. He didn't sweat it because he only had two fish and never kept more than two. Unfortunately, somebody else had kept two extra to fill out Tim's limit not realizing he had a C license and they were over as a group. Seems they always tried to max out the last day for the trip home. The other guy took the ticket but there were hard feelings and hard words about the fine. Much simpler just to keep your own limit and let everybody else worry about their's, don'tcha think?"
2579489,mlobes,2014-03-21 16:01:00,5,Is it legal to party fish in Ontario?
2579577,Carnhzkr,2014-03-21 16:26:00,964,"What is ""party fishing""? I'm not familiar with the term. Does that mean drinking in the boat while you fish? If so, then no, that is not legal."
2579729,speckmaster,2014-03-21 16:58:00,17,Party fishing is not allowed. You are only allowed to fill your own limit. Kids have to be strong enough/capable of reeling in their own fish to keep their limit.
2579745,kzoofisher,2014-03-21 17:01:00,5144,"Kids also have to fish under their own license to have a separate limit, no? If he fishes under your license his fish count towards your limit."
2579857,fisherman 1,2014-03-21 17:23:00,39,"Yes, and no. For non resident's under 18 they must fish with someone with a licence and what they catch and keep is part of the limit on that license. There is a option to buy the kid a license if they want to keep there own limit. For Ontario residents kids don't need a license and they can keep a limit allowed with a sport fishing license."
2579921,bigwalleye1,2014-03-21 17:55:00,2632,"If somebody's fishing in my boat in Canada and he can't manage to boat 4 keeper walleyes in a day on the water, he'd better be able to swim. A LONG ways. We don't fish close to the landing. Just sayin'."
2580153,ohiojmj,2014-03-21 19:22:00,1262,Is it legal anywhere?
2580521,HeHooksHimself,2014-03-21 21:07:00,725,"Fact is, if there are two guys in the boat and eight walleyes <18"" in the well then they are legal for a sportsman license. At least that is the rule we use. You gotta be reasonable with this. What are you supposed to do, put a mark on your fish? We also cull if we keep the fish healthy. We have been known to party in the boat upon occasion as well...filthy Americans!"
2580977,Shotgun,2014-03-22 04:45:00,759,Annual Family Fishing LicenseAllows a nonresident and immediate family (children under age 16 and spouse) to fish throughout the license period. The combined catch for all family members may not exceed one daily limit and one possession limit for each species.Not a party license but works well for an immediate family or if the spouse goes along.
2581009,mlobes,2014-03-22 05:05:00,5,I was aware of the rule about children under 18 can fish and any fish caught would count towards the adult with a limit. When reading the regs I don't see anything where if you're fishing with more that one person in the boat and you catch your limit that you wouldn't be able to continue fishing and fill part of their limit. The rule says catch limit is the number of fish you are allowed to keep in a day. If there are multiple people in the boat and if that rule holds true then it could be the total of all the limits combined. If ever stopped and questioned I suppose it would be hard to determine who caught how many it would be what ever you told them. If you have a minor fishing under an adult who has a license wouldn't that be party fishing. It is legal in Minnesota to party fish.
