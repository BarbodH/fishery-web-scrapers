2646961,Sportfisher,2014-04-07 07:05:00,47,"I have been to Minnitaki the last few years. Our group stays at Donnelly's, (great place and Alan and family are great people, BTW) and we try to make our fist day on the water June 15 or 16, so as to be able to fish the sanctuaries. We generally don't fish the main lake. Nice thing about Minnitaki is that there are many places to fish, and you can always find someplace out of the weather. Have a GPS and let it track and you won't have any problems. We fish Moonlight Falls area, Red Pine and Lyons Bays as well as spend a morning at the English River. If an area is dead, and before leaving, I throw some spoons on a Medium heavy rod just in case there is a good sized northern in the area. If you are going to stay at Donnellys, it is quite a bit cheaper in July. Have a great time!"
2655401,115 optimax,2014-04-08 20:58:00,650,I got a buddy that lives in Sioux lookout and will be staying at his place.As for fishing he hasn't been out on Minitaki much.Thanks for the advice..
2665265,prov1800,2014-04-11 06:19:00,5010,"My wife works in sioux and lives a abram lake.lucky me.get to go there quit a bit but not through june much.fishing is awesome through july to October.

2667649,tuiflies,2014-04-11 17:38:00,158,"I was surprised to learn last year how different the lakes in the system could be from one another from year to year. Personally I struggled more on Minnitaki last year than other years so I started spending time on Lac Seul where I hammered them and found fish quite easily. When I mentioned this to a friend, he said the same thing happened in reverse a few years ago. LS seemed to be more challenging and Minnitaki couldn't give them up fast enough. Luckily, they are all close enough that you can check them all out in the same week if you want. If the waters high enough you can boat from the bottom of the pickerel arm all the way to Ear Falls. (Make sure you are guided the first time you try to drive Pelican Falls though.). As for a place to stay, I highly recommend Donnelly's as well. Great guys in every respect."
2584009,115 optimax,2014-03-22 22:16:00,650,I was thinking of doing some Walleye fishing on Minitaki Lk in June.Ive did good ice fishing there but I've never been out there on a boat.Does anybody have any ideas or advice?Thanks.... JT
2584305,CI_Guy,2014-03-23 06:23:00,2118,We fish Minitaki in early July every year. Look for islands with gravel and weeds on the shore line. You want the wind blowing towards the island. There should be smalllies close to shore. Rocks and other structure close to that side of the islands in 12' to 18' depths should hold some walleye.
2587394,RoughWaters,2014-03-23 23:01:00,98,"Our crew has fished Minnitaki every June for the last 10 years out of Donnelly's. The fishing has been very good overall with lots of places to catch fish. Everything from weedbeds, to rock points, off shore reefs. It's a blast being able to catch fish from all over the lake."
2587993,skap,2014-03-24 08:29:00,58,I have fished Minnitaki in June for the last 15 years. Minnitaki is awesome and you should have no trouble catching fish. It is a deep lake though and I tend to find in June that walleye can be caught in just about any depth. We have done well in 10 feet and 40 feet in June. One thing to remember is that there are a number of fish sanctuaries that open on June 15th. Just something to keep in mind depending on when you are thinking about going. Feel free to PM me with any specific questions. Good Luck!!!!
2591921,115 optimax,2014-03-25 05:33:00,650,"Is it kind of like Lac Suel?I fished Lac Suel a million times and I just want to try something new.I was thinking down in the Pickerel Arm Area, I iced fished there years ago and caught my biggest and blackest walleye ever. It was 29.75 inches and almost 11 poundsThis year is going to be a little screwy I think.I just got in from work and it's - 28c with the wind again. Nothing is melting and my auger won't make it through the ice anymore.I need an extension."
2593713,Guest,2014-03-25 14:02:00,0,"We have be at PAC for the last 27 years the 2nd or 3 rd week of June. We don't fish the main lake much. Spend most of our time at Moonlight Falls , SW Bay Lyons Bay and fish in Red Pine bay but can't keep any until the 15 th of June. Seems we find nice fish in differnt spots, Some days right off the end ouf our dock. Wind blowing in is a key . Last year 28.5 walleye and 21 in. smallie don't pike fish much. Good numbers most days. We will be at PAC june 5th. Good Luck !"
2596161,115 optimax,2014-03-26 00:34:00,650,"I seen a YouTube video of Moonlight Falls and some nice Walleye.I heard good things about Lyons Bay and Red Pine Bay.I will probably be up there around June 15th.With the way the weather is,the fish might still be close to the Sanctuarys. - 24c right now."
2599865,jimmie,2014-03-27 00:22:00,123,"Depending upon what time of the month of june and water temps as to where you might fish. Just ask other fisher guys or resort folk they will put you on them. I have several spots that I try and it seems that the chutes area has fish arrive in my many spots there a bit later in the month if the water is cold or weather hass been unsettled. Also as usual almost anywhere you fish if a northern moves in you should move at least for awhile. Lotsa nice structure on this body of water just like Lac Seul. Just don't spend too long in an unproductive spot. It may be worth trying later in the day or the next day. If there are any weed beds there will be fish. Don't be afraid to try any shallow areas. I've caught my biggest walleye in the shallows of nearly all lakes that I have fished. Weeds, rocks even timber are the ticket. Become aware of any rock hazards especially those unmarked. If you have GPS use it as there are many nice secluded bays and numerous islands. If you know the lake and can keep your bearings then no problem but . . . if you do not then it can bite you until you find your way. Good luck to all of you and have a safe season. Jim"
