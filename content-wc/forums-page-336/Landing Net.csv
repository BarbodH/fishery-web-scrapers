2648777,tv4fish,2014-04-07 13:32:00,2694,"UMMM I do -- One on top of the other in the boat doesn't take up that much room. The smaller/shallow ""strechy"" one for walleyes - the deeper one for northerns......"
2648825,Carnhzkr,2014-04-07 13:42:00,964,"I""m not saying you can't land a pike with rubber net. You usually can. I'm just saying that if you net one head first, and he gets his nose pointed out through one of the seines, those slimy things can swim right through it. I've seen it happen many times, and I'm surely not the only one. When we first used a rubber net, maybe 20 years ago, I thought it was the cat's meow. Walleyes pop right out with no tangles. Works great. Then a pike slid through it one time and I figured that was a fluke and would never happen again. It was no fluke. I think that rubber net is in a landfill somewhere. Maybe they're made differently now, but they sure look the same to me."
2648857,bones82,2014-04-07 13:44:00,121,Interesting. I've never experienced that before. Mine will end up in the landfill if I lose a big fish.
2649193,Carnhzkr,2014-04-07 14:42:00,964,"Speaking of nets, one time my dad bought a new net. It was a pretty deep net, and after several big walleye tangles, he got the bright idea to tie a knot in the ""basket"" to make it shallower. Seemed to be a great idea - no more tangles, until one day which will forever live in family infamy through the retelling of Canadian fishing stories. My dad caught the biggest walleye he'd ever had on the end of his line. My mom always hated being the net person, as she's always said it's a thankless job (if you net the fish properly, that's what you're supposed to do, but if you screw up, it's all your fault). She nets the fish, and as she lifts the giant up to the boat, it flops out of the shallow net and away it swam. I was not along that trip, it was just the two of them, but as the story goes, my mom looked at my dad in a panic. My dad looked back at her and made the quick and wise decision to say, ""It's my fault, I shouldn't have tied the knot in the net"". He may have lost the fish of his dreams, but he kept a wife."
2649209,bones82,2014-04-07 14:45:00,121,"Fantastic story. Happy wife, happy life! That's why my wife stays home."
2649369,drlee,2014-04-07 15:10:00,409,"Rubber nets can create a problem, i.e., you can lose a big fish; but I will continue to use mine since they are easier on the fish and the angler in the catch/release mode, which is the vast majority of the time. I guess losing a big one does not upset me that much. As to burying a hook: If you flatten the barbs you may have some pain, but you will be good to go without major surgery! Years ago, I drove from Eagle Lake to Dryden with a buried treble in my finger. After the Doc was done with me, I was in a lot of pain for the next three days. If I had been on a fly in, I would have truly been in trouble. (Yeah, I know there are methods for removing barbed hooks...sort of.) Do I lose fish when I go barbless? Nope."
2649385,Bill Krejca,2014-04-07 15:12:00,6107,"Re: stretch nets - In my opinion, the rubber nets sold today are less likely to slip pike through than those sold some years ago. I, too, had several go right through when the rubber nets first came out. I haven't had that experience with one purchased two years ago. Bill"
2649449,bones82,2014-04-07 15:19:00,121,"We've had to remove hooks twice over the years. Luckily they were in the hand. One we pulled out, the other we cut the treble and pushed through. I'd be lying if I said there wasn't some liquid courage involved in the removal process. I can tell you that pike slime does not feel good in fillet knife cut. I could imagine how it feels in a hook wound."

2647137,TheDFP,2014-04-07 07:46:00,39,Father and I have another trip planned for a fly-in. We have had too many close calls getting stuck with a hook while trying to land a fish. Saw a guy a couple of years ago who put a trebble hook through the joint on his finger while landing his biggest walleye ever. He had the hook through his finger joint while the fish was thrashing around. Don't want to ruin a trip because of something like this. Does anyone have a good recommendation on a landing net? Space is premium in the 14' outpost boat and don't want to be untangling a set of trebbles out of the net.
2647281,Bill Krejca,2014-04-07 08:15:00,6107,"Hooked hands are no fun. Rubberized nets , either coated or stretch, are helpful. In my opinion, the safest unhooking approach is to first tightly grab the fish embedded hook with pliers before handling the fish. If the fish does decide to flap, the hook will be controlled. This is especially so when crank baits are used. Folks making videos for general public viewing do fishermen, especially new folks, a disfavor by showing their manly ability to lift the hooked fish while the hook(s) is still in the fish. Some years ago, after taking crank bait hooks out of two friends' hands in less that 20 minutes of each other, I/we have learned to first grab the pliers and hook, then the fish.Bill"
2647353,tv4fish,2014-04-07 08:32:00,2694,"I will agree with Bill -IMHO, those nets are well worth the additional price."
2647481,bones82,2014-04-07 08:54:00,121,I agree. Rubber stretch nets are the way to go. We always unhook the fish in the net and then grab the fish. Never grab the tight line and hoist the fish...recipe for disaster.
2648201,MrSimon,2014-04-07 11:03:00,922,"Agree on the rubberized nets. I once got a hook stuck deep in my thumb on the very first fish I caught on a week-long trip at an outpost. I got it out safely, but now use pliers on EVERY fish I catch. No more grabbing hooks with my fingers."
2648249,Pezman38,2014-04-07 11:14:00,3196,"Stowmaster, space savers and great nets if beckmans aren't possible."
2648289,Carnhzkr,2014-04-07 11:25:00,964,"I""m not a big fan of the stretchy rubber nets. The rubber coated nets are fine, but not the stretchy ones. They work great for walleye, but I've seen too many pike slide right through them. If I used one of those for walleye, I'd need a second, nonstretchy net just for pike, and who has room for two nets?"
2648329,SinOrSwim,2014-04-07 11:31:00,1528,http://www.cabelas.com/product/Fishi...3Bcat104427180I just replaced on and got this. Didnt use it much as the guide had his net but for a fly in it would be great.
2648569,bones82,2014-04-07 12:48:00,121,"Ours handled several 40""+ pike last year without issue."
2648753,phishfearme,2014-04-07 13:29:00,1242,"amazing that no one has mentioned using a cradle rather than round nets - round nets have been shown to damage pike backbones as they bend the fish too much. and also surprised that no one has mentioned at least getting rid of the barbs AND making treble hooks either double by cutting off one hook or replacing the treble with a large single hook. read the Manitoba rules! and finally - using a gloved hand under the gill cage has worked fine for me - although holding up large fish by the head with the body dangling down has also been shown to do damage to internal organs - so get the fish up and supported underneath ASAP, unhook the barbless hook, take a photo and back into the water. phish"
