This is just a heads up for anyone coming to Canada for the first time around those dates. Years ago we decided to go Lake Trout fishing 2 days earlier before the walleye opener. It was a Thursday afternoon and it was cold, we had down filled parkas, Sorel winter boots and wool pants on. Friday morning we awoke to about 1-2 inches of snow on the ground and put on our winter gear on again to fish that morning. Later in the day after dinner we went out again wearing only sweat shirts and the next day in the afternoon, Saturday it was T-Shirts and between 75-80 degrees. We fished walleyes that night in T-Shirts.The weather can go in all kinds of directions in May."

2667177,jimmie,2014-04-11 14:57:00,123,I invited my landlord along an an earlier thanusual trip on Memorial day weekend in 2002 and it was sleety and sunny on the same day every day for the first three and on our final day it was sunny but cool. Every year since then it has been better weather in the Northland. Had he not forgotten his hood to his coat and had to use an ice bage with holes to wear over his head it would have been better. lol He has never gone back again! I have invited him in July and August but he says I'm not going to where it snows on Memorial Day. A few years ago it snowed here on the holiday weekend too! Go figure.
