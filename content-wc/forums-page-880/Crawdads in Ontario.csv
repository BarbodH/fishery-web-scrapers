Or, you could pickle your own prior to the trip if they have crayfish at your baitshop.As far as what fish will eat them, I think just about any fish will gobble up some li'l lobsters if they have a chance. Just that some species spend more time looking for them than others.As far as trapping them up in Canada...Whaht chew tahkin' abawt, mahn? They'z naht bayt, they is dinnah, no? Cajun delacacy, say oui? ;)"
