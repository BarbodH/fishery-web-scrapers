530380,Guest,2003-05-02 06:08:00,0,Sounds like a lot of the Lakes are going to be low this year. Anybody got any low water pointers that can help put us all on fish?
530381,Ron,2003-05-09 17:19:00,387,"The only suggestion I have if you are new to LOTW is take it slow.The water is certainly down a good three feet right now, and unless we get rain it will remain that way.When you come to a marker and uncertain or forget which site to go, slow down and look. Most markers are a few feet from where the rock, reef is anyway. Dont bother trying to follow anyone as they may not know where they are going either. Obtain a topo map, but even here a few are not correct.Best bet is if you are staying at a lodge/resort is to hire one of their guides for a day or two. If the guide has any clue, he will show you safe ways to get around that area.Another item I suggest. There is a new prop on the market. The Piranha. It is a composite of whatever materials. One thing I do know is IF you tap a rock, hit a log etc. it will normally damage only one blade. This prop too never really looses it pitch unlike aluminum. You can see these at http://www.propsplus.on.ca I know several lodges that are now using these and I strongly suggest them myself.Good luck, good fishing, and just take it slow. It's a holiday, remember that.Ronhttp://www.kenoraontario.net"
