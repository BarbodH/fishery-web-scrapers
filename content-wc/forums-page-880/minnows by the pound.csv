530823,McQ,2003-05-11 05:23:00,615,"Approximate cost of bulk bait in Canada - cost will vary from region to region and will increase later in the season. All prices in Cndn funds. Reduce by 1/3 for US.Crawlers - Flat/500 $50-$60Minnows - Gallon/ (unsorted approx 30 doz) $60Leeches - Pound/ (unsorted quantity about 40 doz) $50-60There are some problems associated with buying minnows in bulk relative to keeping them alive for extended periods - aeration to supply oxygen is required, you would need at least a fifty gallon barrel to provide sufficient space. Better to buy your minnows fresh each day from the outfitter.Unsorted leeches may result in an imbalance of jumbos. If you want the bigger ones it's better to buy them by the dozen from either a baitshop or your outfitter. Remember to change the water daily and remove any dead ones.Crawlers can be transported across the border in commercial bedding, leeches and minnows are restricted."
