530911,huskeram,2003-05-11 09:32:00,6,Will be making my first trip into Canada May-17-24. Will be staying at Little Canada camp and fishing the English river for walleyes and pike. Was wondering if anyone has stayed there or fished the English river. I have only fished walleyes in lakes not in rivers. Any tips on what to use or how to find the walleyes in the river would really help me out alot. By the way hows the weather been up around there. I can't wait to get up there. thanks.........good fishing to all
