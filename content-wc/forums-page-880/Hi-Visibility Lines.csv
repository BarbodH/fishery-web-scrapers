Do any of you guys use the hi-visibility lines such as Stren Hi-Vis Gold? The lake we fish is very tea stained. I was looking for a line that is easier to see but I don't know if it effects the fishing. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks"

If it would affect the fishing or you think it affects the fishing, just add a swivel to the end with an addition of clear mono or floricarbon line ahead of your lure. I prefer the floricarbon. Good fishing."
