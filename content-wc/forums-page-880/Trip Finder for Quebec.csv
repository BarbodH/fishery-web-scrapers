NW Ontario is a great place, like many others in Canada including Quebec. But no destination needs your help in promoting it if your disrepecting others to do so.Stay on topic or stay out of it."

530181,Guest,2003-04-24 15:57:00,0,"Anyone know of a trip finder website for outpost lodges for the province of Quebec, like the one that exists for Northwestern Ontario?"
530182,McQ,2003-04-24 16:10:00,615,Here you go:http://www.fpq.com/entrelistean.html (search engine go by region)http://www.quebec-outfitters.net/http://www.sportsmansresource.com/flocalxxquebec.htmhttp://www.quebeclodges.com/quebec_fishing_lodges.htmlMy personal favoritehttp://www.pointe-aux-dores.com/apropos/about.shtml
530183,Guest,2003-04-25 17:37:00,0,Thanks for the websites McQ!
530184,McQ,2003-04-26 08:05:00,615,"You're welcome, my associate Don Meissner has been working with Quebec Tourism for a few years now. They have been underwriting the PBS fishing production of ""Streamside"" and Don has fished a number of regions. I personally fish the La Verendrye Park, Gouin Reservoir and the Mistassinni - Albenal areas.Whenever possible I would be happy to help anyone find the appropriate place for your vacation trip."
530185,Guest,2003-04-27 09:22:00,0,"McQ,Can you steer me in the direction of a fly-in outpost camp in Quebec? Would prefer remote, private lake. Thanks."
530186,McQ,2003-04-27 09:57:00,615,"What are you interested in, walleye, pike, bass, lake trout, char, landlocked salmon, brookies, etc. How far do you want to drive into the province, do you want to go east, west or due north. There are at least 400 spots that come to mind and that's only in the area due north a couple of hours by air from Ottawa or Montreal. Have you been up this way in the past? Would you like to start the fly-in phase just a short drive from the border? How many in your party? Are you on a budget or is the sky the limit. You can have accomodations from bush rough to the finest 5 star resort. Help me out with a few more specifics and I'll do my best to put you in a place that will be a lifetime memory.I have no axes to grind nor do I receive any compensation for any tips i may pass along, just like to see folks like you come up and enjoy some of the finest fishing available anywhere.You can email me if you like [email protected] although it might be more meaningful to other members posting here if we carry on through this thread."
530187,Highlander,2003-04-27 16:00:00,6,Why would you want to go to Quebec where you'll be treated badly for speaking English and especially when you are an American??!!!! Get real! Try Northwestern Ontario where the real fish are and the real men come to play :-)

530188,Guest,2003-05-01 12:19:00,0,"Highlander. You make me laugh! What makes you think that I am an American? Why would I want to travel to Northwestern Ontario when the cost is often much more than that of a comparable outfitter in Quebec, travel a greater distance, and the fishing is not necessarily any better, depending on whose opinion you ask? Keep travelling to NW Ontario. It just means more fish for those of us who prefer to fish in Quebec."
