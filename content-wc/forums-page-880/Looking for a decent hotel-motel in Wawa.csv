530836,Jim,2003-05-12 20:13:00,238,Thanks for the link Stephen. I checked out the site and it looks good. Do you think it has indoor or outdoor toilets? What about running water? I'm assuming they must. Do rooms come with separate bathrooms or is there only one per floor. Do they have T.V. way up there?

530793,Guest,2003-05-11 14:47:00,0,I stayed at the Bristol last year and it was fine. As I recall it was about 60 or so Canadian and it was very clean. It passed my wife's cleanliness test so that says something. We ate at the Columbia restaurant and it was very good too. I plan to do both next year.

530786,jzstiff,2003-05-11 19:34:00,188,I'm going up to Lake Kabinakigami. Great place to fish. Flying out of Hawk Junction. Been going there a couple years now and find the 2nd week of the season to be the best. Usually miss the mosquitos and black flies but it's looking kinda warm there so far and think they might get me this year. Thanks for the replies all. Booked a chalet at the Motor in. Great price of $111 (US) for 6 of us. FISH ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

530784,Guest,2003-05-10 15:11:00,0,The Wawa Motor Inn is the best I've found in that town. They have so larger chalets in the back that are pretty nice.
530785,Guest,2003-05-10 16:56:00,0,whereabouts are you headed for fishing???.we will be going up through wawa about a week later than you...headed towards our trip also..
530787,Guest,2003-05-10 19:01:00,0,We stay at the Pennisula Inn just to the west of Wawa (1-2miles). Cheap rooms (single $65 Cdn) they also have a restaurant.. Happy fishin..
530788,Guest,2003-05-11 06:35:00,0,Don't forget to stop at Young's for an ice cream cone!! Ha Ha I wouldn't feel like I had been to Wawa unless I had stopped at Young's. Wawa Motor Inn gets our visit also as we pass thru every year. I don't know about this year as we are taking our Lab with us on her first annual fly-in trip. Wife said it might be first and last too!!

530789,Guest,2003-05-11 08:30:00,0,Has anyone stayed at the Beaver Hotel? Looks nice from the outside. We're looking for a different place to stay ... our previous place is going downhill.
