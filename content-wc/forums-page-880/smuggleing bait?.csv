530734,Guest,2003-05-09 17:39:00,0,"I work for customs and i will just tell you all this- If you don't mind being detained and arrested in front of many other travellers, go ahead and try!!If caught, you run the risk of having your vehicle and ALL of your equipment seized by Canada Customs!!Do yourself a favour- BUY CANADIAN!!"
530735,Jesse-WI,2003-05-09 19:10:00,534,"The law says you can not bring live leeches into Canada. We could go on and on about the reasons, but its the law so lets just respect it."
530736,bigfish1965,2003-05-09 19:38:00,3210,"Reason for leeches... a while ago some leeches were brought across that someone had purchased in the US. They contained a virus that, through several years, the US leeches had become immune to, but wiped out the leech population in the lake they were used. Can't bring in minnows because of the fear of invading species problem."
530737,Guest,2003-05-10 09:18:00,0,"If the reason is a virus, then why do the leech trucks at the baitshops have Minn. licenses? I do believe it is the almighty dollar. No big deal for me."
530739,Guest,2003-05-10 11:23:00,0,I have to say this about that. where do you smuggle them from. I asked the owners of the bait shop where they get their leaches from and guess what- they come from the U.S. Somewhere in Minnesota I think they said.
530740,Guest,2003-05-10 12:01:00,0,any suggestions on where to buy JUMBO leaches between fort frances and ear falls? I have been a little dissapointed the last few years with what has been available.thanksryan
530738,bigfish1965,2003-05-10 18:46:00,3210,The bait suppliers have sources that are considered safe. There is no way to know where Joe Fisherman got his from.
530741,ken,2003-05-11 04:27:00,30,"If customs is so concerned with water from leeches coming acrosstheir border,why dont they check bilges and livewells?"
530742,Guest,2003-05-11 05:06:00,0,"Rainy Lake has good leeches but very expensive (807-274-6429). If you stop there, make sure not to buy the lures, one day I bought a lure(3.99) from K-mart and then went to rainy lake sports and seen the same lure(11.59) not a very good site."
530723,Guest,2003-05-08 13:57:00,0,I know a guy that is dead set on smuggleing leaches for the walleye opener because the quality is always poor up in Ear Falls. Anybody know the consequences for getting caught so I can talk him out of it.
530724,Guest,2003-05-08 16:19:00,0,"Maybe he could go with ""Dick Withem"". They be a great pair!"
530725,retire55,2003-05-08 16:41:00,1029,"Please supply his name, vehicle brand and licence number and expected crossing date and I'll pass the information along to the Canadian authorities. Too bad your probable border crossing is so far from here - I'd pay money to watch the authorities send his sorry behind home (after posting a $500 bond to get released)."
530727,Guest,2003-05-08 17:01:00,0,"Go ahead and try it, you, I mean he, MIGHT not have to worry. I just hope you, oops I mean he, gets caught. It's funny watching cars get torn down at the border!!!"
530728,Guest,2003-05-08 19:28:00,0,He is probably taking every thing else with him too. May as well bring the bait too. I mean you're only visiting a foreign country who set the laws and you are guests there....
530729,Jesse-WI,2003-05-08 20:58:00,534,"If you lie and then get searched, it could cost you a lot of money and being refused entry into the country. This would completely ruin your trip.They are several places to buy leeches between Fort Frances and Ear Falls. Call ahead and place a special order."
530726,Guest,2003-05-08 21:31:00,0,NAZI.....
530730,BD,2003-05-09 05:09:00,739,There is a good bait shop on Hwy.11 on the east side of Fort Francis. Anyone dumb enough to risk ruining the trip for all of you just so he can have his special bait isn't worth having along.
530731,The Eyes_Have it,2003-05-09 06:28:00,315,"Having never fished in Canada, I'm wondering why a person couldn't bring leeches across the border?"
530732,VMS,2003-05-09 06:37:00,1103,"I would think much of it is due to the fact that you are bringing across water, which is not native to the land. It makes sure that nothing would get introduced into their waters or land that could potentially be destructive (like euration milfoil, non native fish etc). Same goes for Nightcrawlers. You can bring nightcrawlers, as long as they are in commercial bedding and nothing else.Steve"
