I love going to Cananda, my favorite trip of the year. Regarless of the negative posts, I've never been treated with anything other than the upmost respect by Canadians. Sure their are a few jerks, but they exist in every country. A war, economy or ignorant comments will never keep me away."
529909,Trailerguy,2003-04-20 20:05:00,1407,"People who want to boycott Canada because of patrotism, must be boycotting Boston, and San Frisco too, right?"
529910,Ron,2003-05-09 17:43:00,387,"I do not really think that all that many will stop coming to Canada because of political reasons. As it has been mentioned do not blame lodge/resort or business's here in Canada for what our Federal Politicians do. We have no control over them until the next election.I would like to point out various other reasons that some might want to avoid Ontario.1 Sars - Well I believe that has been taken care of. You will NOT have to fish wearing a surgical mask. I have heard of no cases here in NW Ontario anyway. To me, it is only a matter of washing hands, covering ones mouth when coughing.2-West Nile Virus - what the heck. Use a good repelant with DEET. Long sleeve shirts, and make sure the screens on the cabins are good. I for one am certainly NOT going to stop going fishing just because of some stupid mosquito.3-Exchange rate. A non issue with me. Most lodges charge in US Funds anyway.4-The War. Well that too is actually a non issue now. It is apparently over for the better part. I applaud the US and it's forces for a job well done.5-The US Economy. this is the one that may or may not hit some of the business's in Ontario. We have no control over the US economy. Heck if one looses their job, or laid off, things do and must change. I know a few resorts that have had cancellations, but I know of others that are up. For anyone who is feeling the pinch of the economy still come to Ontario or even Canada. Maybe look into something or someplace that is more affordable. But when it comes to those two virus's, what are we going to do. Lock our doors and hide? Not a chance with me. I will be out in the sun on Lake of the Woods fishing, in short sleeves, wearing of course some kind of repelant if needed. As for Sars, well I know of no one who has been to those foreign countries anyway. If I catch it I catch it. But I'll be fishing and that is all that matters.Ronhttp://www.kenoraontario.net"

If so, I'm guessing a small amount.Responses from lodge owners as well as predictions from everyone else are welcome."
529899,Trailerguy,2003-04-16 18:45:00,1407,"A freind has a lodge near Perrault Falls, he says it's a non-issue. Reservations are ahead of last year."
529900,Guest,2003-04-16 18:53:00,0,If fisherman choose not to go to Canada this year they need to remember that the one thing that we all cherish being Americans and Canadians is FREEDOM....Soldiers from both of our countrys have fought and died to protect this right for each of us and the politics that protect that freedom should not make any of us not cross the border.I will fish Canada this year and enjoy my time with my friends who make Canada their home and we will talk of fishing and family and drink Amercian beer while eating Canadian Walleye and neither of our countrys politics will stop us from enjoying each others company and the freedom we all take for granted.Each of you do what you must. Just dont let politics keep you from eating Canadian Walleye with your friends.
529901,Arkie eye jerker,2003-04-16 19:07:00,228,I'm doing my part to keep the business up. Will bring three with me to Canada the third week of June. I don't even let my wife interfere with my fishing trips (much) so I am sure not going to let politics I have no control over get in the way.
529902,Karl,2003-04-17 01:38:00,63,"No impact whatsoever. Matter of fact, i'd be more that pleased if someone cancelled where I stay. I'd book it immediately. My wife wouldn't be pleased, but that I can deal with.I believe that those professing politics over fishing aren't the type of people I prefer to spend a lot of time and money to fish with or stay at the same camp with anyway. Kinda' like the motto of this board - ""Shut up and fish!"""
529903,Guest,2003-04-17 06:01:00,0,None whatsoever. Both our collective populations have a very short memory. In a month or so Iraq is just another distant memory that had no real perceptable impact on your way of life for joe average. If you have relatives in the service maybe a different tune but this is a small percentage. The US economy in downturn will have a slight impact but there are so mant Americans coming here that they are like herds of lemmings....only a little yappier:)
529904,Ivy,2003-04-17 06:34:00,556,"I would think that because fishing vacations in general are one of the best vacation bargains you can purchase, they would be uneffected to be better than last year. Since most people drive to their lodge or fishing area, you don't have to mess around with the airports.I have been on vacations where we spent almost the same amount for a Hotel room in one night than we did for a cabin in Canada for a week.Ivy"
529905,Guest,2003-04-17 15:21:00,0,Won't effect my plans...but the way the exchange rate is going..it looks like it will cost more. ;)
529906,Vitreum,2003-04-17 15:33:00,221,"i doubt that one will see any real impact from the canada junkies on this board. if anything, you may see a little drop off in the casual or occasional visitor."
529907,Guest,2003-04-19 21:32:00,0,"Our business is ahead of last year. You are correct Eric, repeat business makes it happen year after year....fishing vacations are a great value, in more ways than one. Family fishing trips are lifelong memories!ro"
