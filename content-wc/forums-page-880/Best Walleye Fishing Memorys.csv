Water in lake drained, Walleyes small. Cass Lake...drove to resort, no border guards to deal with, no exchange-rate hassle, lower priced gas,reasonable license fee, spent our money with people who really like Americans."

Having served in the military, the last time I had fished with my Dad was when I was 18. I can remember his patience as I was growing up and teaching me to fish. As time went by, I stuck with fishing and he grew away from it. 20 years later I had the priviledge of paying for his trip to Canada and doing everything for him to repay him for his acts of kindness and love all those years ago. Just seeing his face as we fished and he got to take in the beauty that is Canada was worth every penny. Actually it was priceless. Don't know how much longer Dad will be around, but that will never be forgotten."

Bottom line is that we are neighbours, sometimes we have our differences, but who doesn't ? Good luck & be safe everyone (including kelp) this season!!!"

Our best day ever finished with a flurry of around 60 27"" plus Walleyes on a spot that was about the size of a two car garage. Every time we trolled over it with a Leech and a jig we would catch two or three of these monsters. Have fished the same spot every day for the last three years and while we catch a few there we keep hopeing for the return of ""THE SCHOOL"""
530331,Guest,2003-04-30 07:14:00,0,"A couple years ago I took my dad and my son on their first Canadian fishing trip. The weather was lousy most of the week. We caught fish, but some days we had to work pretty hard just to have enough for supper. Late in the week the lodge owner (he must have felt sorry for us) gave us permission to fish a walk-in lake that only gets fished a few times a year. The only stipulation was that we could only bring small walleyes out. The 3-mile hike was all my dad could handle, but it was worth it. There was a tiny old boat that leaked and a motor that wouldn't start, so we never got more than 100 yards from where the boat was hidden. But did we ever catch fish....200 walleyes between the 3 of us in about 4 hours would be a conservative estimate and almost all were between 21 and 24 inches. The only hard part was finding six eaters under 18 inches. At midday we pulled up to a rocky point, had a picnic lunch and took naps in the sun...mostly to rest our arms. Shortly after lunch my son landed a 40"" northern on a light rod, with dad trying to help with a rotten old net he'd found in the woods near the boat. I've never laughed so hard in my life. What a memory."

It began to rain lightly, almost a heavy mist. There was another boat down the way, but withour raingear, so they took off. Now I have never been able to keep count of the fish that my boat catches. This much I know. We had a pound of leeches, and we were pulling Lindy rigs with pink Phelps floaters, (which I don't use all that often). Now we caught many, many walleyes on the same leech. In two hours of non-stop action, that pound of leeches was gone. But what really made it special was the fact that the other guy in my boat was my brother, a guy who I get to spend too little time with as we've grown older. We'll both remember it for ever.PS. all fish were release with the exception of four eaters for dinner that night. Dam, the beer tasted good that night!"
530333,Guest,2003-04-30 09:21:00,0,"Last June My wife, brother, dad and myself went on a one day fly out from our resort on LOTW. We took the boats out about a 100 yards from the landing area and started trolling this large rock point. 300-400 Walleye later the plane came back and we retured to the lodge. We fished this 50yrd x 50yrd area for 8 hours either catching a fish or losing our bait on ever pass. Mix in 40-50 Small Mouth and a bunch of Pike and Perch I would say we caught 500 + fish between the four of us. It was a wonderful day and we were the only souls on the lake that day besides a copuple nosy loons and Black Bears."
530334,Guest,2003-04-30 09:28:00,0,THIS IS SIMPLE---FISHING WITH MY DAD. DO NOT CARE WHAT WE CATCH. CHERISH THOSE MEMORIES...DAD WILL NOT ALWAYS BE THERE!!!!!
530335,Guest,2003-04-30 11:05:00,0,"On a trip to Canada about 4 years ago, me my two brothers and my father all found the time to fish together for the first in our lifes. It was great. On the flight back to Houston I was telling the guy next to me on the plane about our trip. The passenger behind who was apperantly listening tapped me on the shoulder and said I wish my sons were like you and your brothers. You have no idea how much that has meant to him. A week later my step mother told me that fishing trip with his sons is all he talks about. That made my year."
530336,Guest,2003-04-30 12:43:00,0,This past March I was ice fishing on Lake of the Woods with my son and my brother and his two sons. We started early in the morning and by the afternoon we only had a two small saugers and a perch in the pail. We decided to move one more time and it paid off big time. In the next two hours we caught twenty eight walleyes over 16 inches and probably twice that many smaller ones. My nine year old nephew stuck a 28 inch fish that will be on his wall for years to come. This day will stick out for me because of how fast a slow day of fishing suddenly became great.
530337,Guest,2003-05-02 06:36:00,0,"Five years ago I took both of my Daughters on a Fly In. They were 16 and 17 at the time and had caught some Walleyes on previous trips but nothing like they caught on this one. We had six days of unbelievable Walleye fishing that included lots of fish and lots of fish in the 25/27"" range. it must have worked because both of the girls told me when they get married the hubby better be a Walleye fisherman or there wont be a wedding."
