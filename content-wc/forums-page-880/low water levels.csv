530766,duffy,2003-05-09 14:54:00,49,With all of this talk of low water levels in NW Ontario how will that affect the pike and walleye fishing? Any ideas on changing of tactics for early season fishing?Duffy

530770,Guest,2003-05-12 06:36:00,0,I wouldn't worry about it......I'd much rather be fishing low level water or water on the rise.
