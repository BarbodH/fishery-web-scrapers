530862,lobo1,2003-05-10 19:26:00,734,cant go wrong. first rate. first class. some of the best waters in all of ontario. new cabin on a new lake every year. pressurized aircraft out of Tbay - what can u say about that ??!!.Only drawback I ever found is that for their best camps you have to fly in with 6 guys and more than likely you have to book a year ahead of time. Been to several of his camps and they all produced 100 fish per person days. we got cancelled because of ice last year. we were to be the first group into Kanuchuan.any specific questions you can post them here or leave your emaillobo1
