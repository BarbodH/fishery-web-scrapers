543310,Guest,2004-09-15 07:16:00,0,"was at kenozha a few years ago.lots of walleyes and some big northerns.we took several over 40 inches.lots of adventure opportunity.we went downstream 4 or 5 rapids.holes between rapids were full of walleyes and last rapids produced a 5 pound brook trout.we had to wade to get boats back up rapids.also have been to trophy fish 3 other camps and they were all great.any other questions let me know,tim"
543316,Guest,2004-09-15 12:48:00,0,"Thanks for the reply Tim, sounds great. Just out of curiosity it appears on my map as though Machawaian feeds into Kenozha. Can you navigate the river between the two lakes or are there impassable rapids? Also, what were the cabins and boats like?"

543346,Guest,2004-09-16 06:02:00,0,"the cabin is very nice-14 foot lund boats and 10 horse motors that ran great when we were there.you can go upriver to machawain but will have to do some wading to get boat thru rapids.we spent a week at machawain and then came downstream to kenozha and spent another week.there is a big hole above first rapids upstream from kenozha yhat can be fantastic walleyes and is not too hard to get to.later,tim"
