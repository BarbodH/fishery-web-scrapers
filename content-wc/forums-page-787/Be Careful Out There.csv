543447,Guest,2004-09-24 11:27:00,0,"OPP Marine Unit search successful Two missing fishermen found alive By Janet Gibson Miner and News While OPP divers continue to search for a missing Bergland man on Lake of the Woods, other OPP marine units have found two Chicago area fisherman who were reported missing Tuesday in the Williams Lake area north of Dryden. Alan Vatsnoras, 27, and Daniel Jenca, 35, were rescued Wednesday morning on the shore of McKenzie Bay in the northern part of Lac Seul, Dryden OPP Const. Diane Harder said. The men spent two nights in the bush after running out of gas on a fishing trip. They set out Monday morning from Williams Lake Lodge in a 17-ft. Lund boat with a 40-hp Yamaha motor and were last seen fishing in the lake Monday at noon. How they ended up 32 km to the north, police aren't 100 per cent sure, Harder said. Lac Seul is accessible from Williams Lake. Vatsnoras and Jenca were back out fishing at the lodge Thursday morning and will return home Saturday. They're very grateful to be alive, said lodge owner Kathy Stieglitz. LAKE OF THE WOODS SEARCH The 32-year-old man missing on Lake of the Woods fell from a fishing boat returning to Morson from Oak Island, Minn. on Saturday, Sept. 18, around 10 p.m. The OPP marine unit, an OPP helicopter and volunteers searched the area near Poplar Island and Firebag Island in vain Sunday, Monday and were joined Tuesday and Wednesday by OPP divers. According to reports to police, the man, who was with two friends and a cousin, was sitting in the back of the 17-foot boat when he disappeared. He wasn't wearing a lifejacket."

Being found that far from camp and running out of gas most likely went hand-in-hand. My guess would be these guys went down Williams Ceek into Williams Bay, and out onto Lac Seul in search of more fish. It is common to see poeple come down to do that. Of course, these guys were still a long way from where Williams meets Lac Seul. To drive all the way up past Manitoba Point for fish is beyond rediculous, you would be passing over thousands of fish. You could get stranded just south of Manitoba and drift with a strong south wind in that direction (wind and waves are typically quite large on L.S this time of year), but that still wouldn't get you up to Mackenzie. So what does that leave? . . . perhaps one of two possibilities, both are which are the outcome of poor planning. One or both could have fished further north and felt if they could return to that spot they would get fish. Anyone who has fished Lac Seul knows how poor that assumption would be; as I said they would be passing over tons of fish for no reason. I suppose another possibility is these guys knew other people staying/fishing further north and wanted to hook-up, and simply failed to either A) calculate gas consumption properly, B) calculate the distance properly, or C) both. Oh wait . . . I guess a third possibility is they got out on Lac Seul, got lost, and used up their gas trying to find the entrance back into Williams Bay. If this was the case, they were no where even close!! Like I said, I'm sure with more detail the story would perhaps answer some of these questions, but it is fun to guess. Now, onto my next concern. Like I said, I know this area quite well and have dealt with similar situations often. One must remember and respect not only how few people are in that area, particularly at this time of year, but also the ferocity of the weather. If the situation were mid-summer it would likely be a bit different. But anyway, that said, how did these guys not get found until Wednesday morning? I'm now looking at this as a guide at the lodge at which they were staying (my role in the bulk of such experiences). When a boat doesn't show up for dinner you start asking questions. Did anyone see so and so today? Did they say anything about staying out late? When and where was the last time you saw them? If missing dinner is very odd, you send out a boat searching right after dinner. If it's somewhat commonplace for these guests and/or guide to stay out through dinner, perhaps you wait awhile. In the summer you have light until at least 10. Now you have 8 at best. Darkness is the real sticking factor; you have to be well-experienced out there and know the area well to drive Lac Seul in the dark. I would be sending out all such people available to search a little before dark if the situation was a boat containing guests who were expected back for dinner. Now, if the boat has only guide(s) (out bear-baiting, fishing, whatever) leave them until morning; don't bother, they can take care of themselves. Guests, particularly if they are unguided, a whole different story. So, if you don't find them that night, they become your #1 goal in the morning, particularly as a lodge owner!! Now there is a lot of water to cover out there in that section of Lac Seul, with many islands, but still 3-4 boats could do a fairly extensive search of the area in half a day, and coordinate to increase the search area after that. So I guess my concern is how these guys weren't found until Wednesday morning? Was the search area not large enough? Did the other guests and staff at Williams do nothing??? WOW! Have I rambled. I know it seems like such a simple lost in the north story, but to someone who actually understands how such a situation could develop, there are plenty of details which require further exploration. And as for the LOTW story . . . it too is missing several details, but it has large amounts of alcohol intake written all over it!"

543478,Guest,2004-09-27 05:21:00,0,Thanks for the reminder. It's the same thing every year. I was out yesterday for Smallmouths and even though the waters cold two guys show up fully loaded with gear in a small boat with no life jackets and a heavy jacket because it was cool in the morning. Seems the younger generation is more in tune than the over 55 guys.
