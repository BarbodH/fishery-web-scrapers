543402,Guest,2004-09-20 16:49:00,0,"Retire55 is correct, in that the quintefishing forum is your best bet for up to date info. I can tell you personally that since the water has been drastically cleared by the zebra mussels the fishery has changed dramatically. Your best shot for a Quinte trophy is trolling in the Picton area from roughly Nov. 'till ice up. The Glenora ferry area was hot last fall. Large deep diving cranks like Mann's Stretch 20's used in conjunction with planer boards are the norm. Picton bay itself has a great night bite when the shad move in in late fall. Slooow trolling (electric preferred) with Rebel Fastracks work great. There is a sporadic jig bite off Thompson's and Shermans point, but your best luck will come trolling. Good luck!"
