Good cabins , good people who will help you onto fish.The camp is on a stained bay of Sturgeon , have caught 25+ inch Walleyes and 44 inch Northerns right in the camp. This year was very tough with all of the rain and all of the cold weather.Their docks were only out of the water once in August , otherwise they have been flooded all year long.It is our camp of choice and if you are taking a family , they have a family rate in July and August that is unbeatable. Late model Lunds with 4 stroke Honda , or if you take your own , they dont charge anything to use the docks. Even though the fishing was tough , we still caught plenty and had a great time. Here is their website. http://www.heartland.on.ca/whitesands/ ( Email has been changed , if interested , I can forward their new addy)"
