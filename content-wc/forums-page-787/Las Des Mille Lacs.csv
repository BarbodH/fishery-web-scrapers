I think anyone with some decent fishing skills can catch fish with a map marked with an ""X"". A good fisherman can put the ""X"" on the map, and that's what you'll need to be able to do. I generally find fish from 30' to 15'with even deeper water adjacent to it. I'll be out next weekend giving it a try (9/24, 9/25). Big minnows work best. When the feed bags on they're not going to waste their time chasing a small bait"
543377,Guest,2004-09-18 06:19:00,0,"Otter lake was good for pike 20""-28"". We went to another small lake to the south of the big lake. Marked lots of walleyes holding up against a rock bluff but couldn't catch them. Baril Bay - the smallmouth-pike-laketrout lake a couple hundred yards to the west was just starting to have the bass hit. We caught some pike and a few bass in there. Saw many large pike 40"" laying in some of the northern bays that were warmimg faster but never got one bigger than 28"" to hit. But it looks real good there for bass fishing. They say many people come there in July- August to fish bass and we saw some nice ones 3-4 pounds. The camp manager guy will put you on some fish. You have to give up some info to get it though once you leave!!"

543024,north_alabama,2004-08-28 08:04:00,172,"Hi all. I'm new to this forum. I'm a transplant from Northern Illinois and anxious to get back to the north to do some fishing! Anyway, I'm looking at taking a trip to Lac Des Mille Lacs in Ontario and was wondering if anyone is familiar with the lake and the quality of the fishing. The people who want to take my money to fish there all say it is very good, but I'm looking for the real story. The trip would be the last week of june through July 4 or so. We're looking at staying down in the SW area of the lake (Baril Bay). I've fished a bunch of the lakes in Quetico Park and BWCA, so I'm generally familiar with what to expect, but am looking for anything specific: numbers of fish, size, general water quality, water temp tendencies, where the fish generally hang out in the late-june timeframe, etc. I also plan to do some pike fishing if they're still active. Lastly, is there a good good source of maps anyone knows of? Thanks."
543030,Guest,2004-08-28 12:52:00,0,"I fish Lac in the Fall and Winter. We do very well depending on weather. It's a large very prolific lake. Maps are available from your outfitter or local places like Walmart and Canadian Tire. It is a popular lake with a reasonable amount of pressure. I am a jig, live bait rigger. We catch fish in the 8 to 10 range every year."
543046,hgf,2004-08-29 09:02:00,199,"I fished the north end for one week 2 weeks ago. First time there. Fishing was very poor at that time. That part of the lake is very shallow, and is supposed to be great early. After that, you have to work hard for your fish. Or at least that was the comment of my older neighbor, who live in Thunder Bay, and fish there all the time. But the south end could be different, it is a very large lake. From my end, I would go again in May or early June, or in September, but not in the summer."
543050,Guest,2004-08-29 15:40:00,0,"I fished that exact spot in mid to late June. The walleye were already moving into the deeper water by then. They were hitting pretty good in some areas with current and 25 apiece a day was about right. We trolled spinners tipped with bait on the bottom to get them about 15 feet down. It should be good if you can find them, but they are usually out of Baril bay by then."
543091,north_alabama,2004-08-30 21:03:00,172,"Thanks, Any idea what the fish typically do later in the summer? Do they migrate to the main body of the lake or do they slide deeper in the vicinity? I decided to go ahead and book the trip so I'll have to chase them wherever they move off to."
543105,Guest,2004-08-31 12:47:00,0,Some portion maps of the lake here.http://www.thunderbayfishing.com/lakes.htm l.b.
543156,Guest,2004-09-03 02:19:00,0,"The camp manager at baril bay knows where they go. They are mostly out in the main part of the lake. He has the spots marked on the map. I never went out there but I think they are just feeding areas adjacent to a little deeper water than back in the bay. They are past the ""Grassy Narrows"" spot if you find that on the map. The Grassy narrows is where they were when I was there. They say the mayfly hatch is usually the last 2 weeks of June in that area, and fishing usually drops off for whatever reason. I went up to Otter Lake several times to slay the northerns and hunt for the school of giant walleye they say the Camp managers son was always showing up at camp with just before dark. Never found the walleye, but if you fish in the evening where the lake makes a turn near the rocky bluff......"
543169,north_alabama,2004-09-04 07:52:00,172,"Thanks, It sounds like you stayed in the same place we're staying (wilderness outfitters). What did you think of it overall? I've ordered a map of the lake so maybe I'll get a better feel for what the bay and surrounding areas are like. Was anything much going on on the other lakes? I'll make a point to get over to otter lake (was planning on trying most of them anyway). :9"
543354,Guest,2004-09-16 12:20:00,0,"What do you guys here about this lake in the fall someone once told me that after labor day it goes dead, which I have a hard time believing cause normally you can catch the hogs then?"
