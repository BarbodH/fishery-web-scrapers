Nothing exciting happening, check out my responses in the ""What's happen'n on the red R/Traverse Bay"" posting a little further down in this Canada bulletin board. If your driving more than 1.5 hours to get here....might be considered to be a waste of gas. Would wait till some of the locals start reporting some action. Water is high and current is fast! Big mamas no where to be found. gms"
