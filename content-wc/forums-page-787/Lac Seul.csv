I have looked at prior posts about Lac Seul, and you guys recommend Evergreen, Fisherman's Cove, Lac Seul Lodge, and Silver Water Wheel. How good is Golden Eagle? Also how is the fishing in that corner of the lake. It looks like there are more lodges in that corner near Ear Falls. Does that are get more pressure? Do you have to go far for fish?"
543411,Guest,2004-09-22 07:53:00,0,"First of all, it's Lac Seul, so if you have to go very far for walleyes you're probably doing something wrong (with the exception of a very cold, late spring). But that said, there is no question the northwest end of the lake gets far more pressure than does the more isolated south-central section."

543462,Guest,2004-09-25 14:47:00,0,If you're after really big eyes go to silver water wheel. If you are just looking to bend your rod I'm sure you would be happy anywere else.

543474,Guest,2004-09-26 19:57:00,0,"I've looked pretty hard for a resort that has ice fishing, Mahkwa Lodge had a couple groups ice fish two years ago. I tried to get in last year but they were doing some work around camp and I couldn't get in. Maybe this year."
543485,Reel_Magic,2004-09-27 18:52:00,20,"I have my hooks out. I called Mahkwa Lodge hope to get a reply. if I can't get info I think I'll load up the gear and head up next say March give or take. I'll keep looking for info. If you hear anthing let me know. I'll have to look at everything bait, hot spots, snow, lodging. fuel ect..ect... I have all the gear to stay on the ice if needed. sounds like a blast to me. I wouldn't mind a small group with no drunks or tempers to deal with."
