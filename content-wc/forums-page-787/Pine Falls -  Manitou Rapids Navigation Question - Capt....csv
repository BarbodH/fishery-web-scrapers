Seing the water flow rate coming through Manitou Rapids (Pine Falls/Winnipeg River), wondering if any have braved going through and up to the Powerview dam. Myself I don't think I have seen it like this in many years, appears that coming up and down could be quite treacherous....this might explain why no one is ""up top"" near the dam fishing. gms"
543475,Guest,2004-09-26 21:23:00,0,When i pulled away from my dock today and got in the middle of the flow at one point i was doing 15 mph gps in neutral. If you were to lose power for some reason you could be swept onto the rocks in seconds. Small boats under 14 ft i would'nt recommend going up the chute right now. If our nice weather holds out they will reduce flow from the gates in a week or so. There are several ways to get through the rapids safely with larger boats but you really should get a local to show you the way. We personally saw or heard about 15 boats last fall fetch her up real hard from my place and even had to rescue two partys who ran their boats right up on to the rocks. Regards....CW

When I say shallow, I mean 4-6"" of water...that kinda shallow. Fun, durable, and functional boats, especially for rivers. Not too good on big water and tall waves though, no jets are I guess. For rivers and rocky shallow waters they are the cats meow. Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""ED on the RED"" ><,sUMo,>"

Checked lwcb.ca and the flow and levels are increasing. A few of the rocks I use for navigation are under and I expect that more of them will be under before the levels subside. The fishing was pretty good at least but the flows are something else. Better walleye fishing than I would of had on the red, thats a fact. The northerns are pretty active as well. 3 of us fishing in 26' of water and 2 of us had jacks on at the same time on the originally hooked fish which were a 20"" walleye and an 18"" jack. Both let go at the boat, couldn't net either. LOL Now thats what I call action."

There are what 5 or 6 dams between here and lake of the woods. Different levels are held to ensure there is enough to generate lots of power over the winter. An increase in flow at LOTW depending on the amount would not necesarilly mean an increase in gate height here. The extra flow could be used to power more turbines all down the line if the demand is there. C.W on the Manitou"

Imagine if this keeps up, will be tough getting out on the ice between Christmas and New Years....this is typically when we get the shack out up near the north side trailer park."
543495,timeout,2004-09-28 13:46:00,28,"The wpg system is fed by lake of the woods and the english river system. What is put in has to come out, it doesn't matter whether you put it through the turbines or through the spillways the volume flow m3/s is the same. The reservoirs are full to capacity with all the rain we've had. If they weren't full they wouldn't be opening gates or pushing it through the spillways they would be trying to conserve it now to make money down the road. Manitoba Hydro controls the level of Lake Wpg. at what something around 714.3 above sea level. While the red and wpg contribute only about 10% of the total flow into Lake winnipeg The increased flow from LWCB has to be accounted for by opening the control stuctures on the entire system. LWCB has the mandate to control the levels on the english, wpg and Lake of the woods which they are doing. Whether or not You think this water is coming is inconsequential to me. LWCB says water levels are rising and expected to increase for the next couple of weeks. I witnessed first hand how they are rising and the increased flow. You like I are using anecdoctal information, they are using empirical information. I'm going to go with the statistics they provide."
