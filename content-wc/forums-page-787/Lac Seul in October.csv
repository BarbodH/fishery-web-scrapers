If anyone has any information I might find useful (is it worth the trip, what type of fishing can I look for, etc.), I would greatly appreciate the help. Thanks and happy fishing!"

From the sounds of it we will be launching out of Williams Bay and we really dont have much of a clue how the fishing is going to be at this point. Since I have never fished LS in the fall before, but when I get back I will post a follow up on how the weekend turns out. Scott"
