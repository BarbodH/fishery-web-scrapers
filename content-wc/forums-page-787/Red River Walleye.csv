542750,NEWMARGUY,2004-08-19 12:43:00,34,"I assume most know about the fall run of large Walleye on the Red every fall but for those of you who don't - the Red River at or near Selkirk, Manitoba produces large ""green back"" Walleye every fall Late Sept. to freeze up. Usually not a problem catching a 10 plus pounder. I have caught 5 over 10# in one fall - 3 last year - one was 32 and 1/2 inches. You are only allowed to keep one per year and I return all I catch - I have a 13 lb. mounted and they are not good eaters at that size. Selkirk park has a boat launch and one can camp. The boat launches (4) are sometimes packed with traffic - the park is just ok. A new motel Super 8 is being built and the only other descent hotel is the Darewood Inn. It is usually booked up with fishermen a year in advance. I would suggust you try it though - the fishing can be great - the weather usually cold. I live right on the river a few miles south of Lockport just south of Selkirk so I know what I am talking about. Give it a try and Good Luck - I may see you on the river this fall (s14 Lund with 25 Merc and dressed in a green snowmobile suit). Jigs and salted minnows work great. Good Luck"

Thanks for the info though, it's a great fishery. We had a lot of good years but the last few have been awful tough. That said I and my partner last year got 5 over 8#'s in two days on the Red but no hogs. Pine Falls was realllly bad last year except for a blip or two as I understand it. We were there a number of days and did better than anyone we talked to just getting 5-8 keepers a day. Hope it's better in 04, I know we have to hit it right, but we're due or things have changed. Todd No honey, my taxidermist did do a good job, some walleye ARE green."

543403,walleyewacker,2004-09-20 17:35:00,144,"Thanks for the informative post. We're actually heading up there in a couple days(Wed-Sun)and staying in the Selkirk area. It's our first trip so really looking forward to it. Sounds like the weather is pretty warm though, :( I hope the fish decide to bite anyways, looking forward to the trip."
