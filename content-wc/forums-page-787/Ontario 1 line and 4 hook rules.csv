543409,north_alabama,2004-09-21 21:05:00,172,"I'm trying to understand the 4 hook limit to make sure I don't inadvertantly do something illegal. What I'd like to do is use a 3-way rig with a crankbait and either a flutter spoon or a spinner rig. If my crankbait has 2 trebles and the 3-wayed spoon or rig has a single hook, the way I read the regulations says that counts as three total hooks. If the spoon is used and has a treble it's still three hooks. If the spinner rig were rigged crawler style with two single hooks I'd have four total. If the spinner rig is used with a treble it would make five hooks (or six if the treble is a stinger and another single is used at the front of the bait) and exceed the limit. Is this the correct way to count hooks? Does using a three-way rig like I described violate the one line rule? I'm assuming it does not because it's all attached to one pole. Any help would be appreciated."
543416,jake,2004-09-22 12:19:00,1694,"you're interpretation is correct. when you put a treble on your spinner it becomes 3 hooks. only when a treble is attached to a artificial bait does it count as one hook. i run into a similar problem when handlineing the candian side of the detroit river. i usually run 2 leaders on the main line. on the us side i can run 2 cranks with 2 trebles each in canada i have to remove a hook to run the same bait. technically (if i had a fetish for tangled messes)i could run 4 leaders with single treble lures for my 4 hook total.
