575133,Guest,2008-06-16 19:36:00,0,"After staring down the barrel of an F5 tornado and torential rains here in Iowa I was long overdue for a trip to the north country. My mother in law and also my brother in law both lost their houses in Parkersburg, IA and tbe gloom and doom was really starting to wear on me around here also. So the first trip to Canada couldn't come a day to soon. Upon arrival (Sat 6/06) we decided that northern were our number one priority. We started close to Jim's camp only to find water temps in the 50's and very few weeds if any. I knew we were in trouble for catcbing big northerns on big lures. I knewthey weren't going to be chasing the lures a whole lot. We packed up and headed north up to Gawley's bay where I had a tip on a good walleye bite and warmer water temps. We started casting at a spot that usually produces numbers of decent northern early in the season. On his 10th cast my buddy Craig connected with the fish of a lifetime. It turned out to be 44 inches and 23 pounds! We took some pics and he slid her into the water to fight another day, hopefully my son's or wife's line in a week! We found our best norhern fishing anywhere that there was new weed growth coming in (very few spots) and also where creeks or narrows were located. In fact alot of our fish came out of the narrows going into Keynote and also into McCloud Bay and also from Indian reserve all the way to the big lake opening. Shallow water was the key as it held the most dense weeds. Add the sunshine and you had the northerns going ballistic on just about everything you threw...even the big lures. Walleyes were caught easily in shallow water from 5 to 10 feet on jigs and minnows. Most were caught in Keynote or Gawley's bay, especially when it was cloudy and windy. Smallies haven't made it to their beds yet but I think its just a matter of days and they will be snapping at anything thrown their direction. I can't wait until next week to get back up there...last week was just what the doctor ordered and if I'd quit letting my buddies catch all the fish I just might get my name on Jim's big fish of the week board also!"
575138,Guest,2008-06-16 20:49:00,0,How rough was Wabaskang that week. I was back in Wine during the week and that little lake got pretty rough a couple of days and the weather was cold and rainy. Going across on Wabaskang on Saturday the 7th we encountered 4 to 5 foot waves and it was a long trip in. In our group on Wine we caught a 42 and 39 inch Northern. We mainly fish for walleye but with the abundance of those we chose to fish northern and lake trout a lot more. scott
575139,lunker99,2008-06-16 20:50:00,236,Sounds like it was a good trip and thanks for the report.
575143,AB,2008-06-16 22:14:00,61,Our thoughts and prayers are with your family after the storm. We went through the same thing back in early 80's and I know it's tough. Thanks for the great report and hope you have good weather on your next trip. Good to hear they are biting in Keynote. What's the water level like?
575154,wildernessgum,2008-06-17 09:00:00,19,"Hey Big Mike, I always enjoy your reports. I only get to Wabaskang once a summer, (this year July 15th)but I enjoy the updates on the lake. Keep them coming. Sounds like your buddy caught quite the monster! Being from MN I have certainly been following tornados and flooding in Iowa. Hard to comprehend how it changes peoples lives. Hang it there. Glad you could still go fishing. Wildernessgum"
575180,Guest,2008-06-17 23:40:00,0,"Yeah, it was definately nice to get away from everything down here, even if it was only for a week. I spent yesterday helping a fishing buddy tear all of his sheetrock out because of flooding in Clarksville on the Shell Rock river. Back to Wabaskang...the water levels are what I would call perfect. Probably a little higher than normal but imo right where they should be. The only thing that concerns me is with the higher lake levels, cool temps, and lack of sunny days up to this point, if we'll have very good cabbage growth this year for good northern fishing. A few years back this occured and we couldn't find weeds anywhere near deep water. The only we way we caught our big norhern was open water trolling out over structure 24-32 feet deep. Don't get me wrong...thats a riot in and of itself, just not how I'm acccustomed to catching them though. Alot can go wrong reeling in a 40 inch northern on 10 lb fireline 140 feet back behind the boat! Hope for some sunny days in the next few weeks if you like to pound the cabbage beds! As for the weather last week, there was alot of clouds and rainfall, and I luckily missed the Sat June 7th day of horrific gusts of wind because we were still traveling up there that day. I know one of the days I think it was Tuesday or Wednesday was really rough as well out of the east but thats the day we pounded them in 5 feet of water along the shoreline of Doe Island. Water levels down in Keynote are also excellent and there's no problem getting down there."
575488,Guest,2008-06-25 18:51:00,0,"We fished the Wabby last week and had pretty good luck around the third narrows, first narrows in the evening, and Doe Island. My brother caught a nice lake trout on a jig in front of the portage going to Wine Lake. We could not believe it! Smally fishing was pretty tough but the northerns were hitting well. My buddy caught a 17lb northern at the base of Perrault Falls one morning. We had a great time at Sleepy Dog as the accomodations are always first class. All I can think about now is when I can get back up there!!"
575491,Guest,2008-06-25 20:27:00,0,Fish Wine the week of June 7th. We caught a lot of lake trout and I heard from a few people they used to catch them below the portage a lot. I personally have never tried it. With the rain we got that week the elevation of the portage came up and the camp owner ran all the boats up the portage on the way out of camp. With the high waters the lake trout might go up into that little bay. They are fun to catch. I have also heard of people parking at the portage and fishing from shore for them. Scott
575500,Hump,2008-06-26 07:24:00,578,Does anyone know. I miss his insights and comments.
575514,Guest,2008-06-26 18:46:00,0,"Mike, Bummer about the floods. We're heading up to Gawley's 8/16. You going to be up there? John"
