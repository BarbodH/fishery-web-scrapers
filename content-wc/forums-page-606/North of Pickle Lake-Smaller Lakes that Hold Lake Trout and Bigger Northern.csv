575410,Guest,2008-06-24 06:35:00,0,Just wondering if anyone knows of any lakes we could dump some small boats in around Pickle Lake (within an hour)that hold Lake Trout or Northerns that run a bit bigger. We're only going to have a day or two to do this but looking for a different adventure besides Kapkichi. WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE ANY ADVICE!
