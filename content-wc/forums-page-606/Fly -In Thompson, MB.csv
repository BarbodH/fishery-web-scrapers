575496,Bobby,2008-06-26 01:33:00,211,"There are a zillion different lodges and outfitters in Northern Manitoba, Thompson being the centre of the majority of them. As for flying out of Winnipeg, well, I would assume that most do (Neultin, Knee Lake, Utik Lake, Molson Lake, the lodges at Gods Lake, etc). A quick google of lodges in northern MB will give you umpteen websites with all the info you need. Check out Travel Manitoba's website or the website of any of the lodges above or http://www.itsmymoment.ca/lodges.html ""Hold on to the boat, boys, she's gonna ram us!"""

575515,td55,2008-06-26 20:29:00,4,"in my opinion silsby is the best pike lake in canada bar none.accomodations are very suitable.i have been the last four years but got iced out this year .we gambled looking for the 50.camp is very clean and atmosphere is very relaxed.the owner kip is a living treasure of canadian history.what amazes me is the large numbers of big healthy fish.even though i try to look mainly for big fish i am amazed at how healthy the 35-42 inch fish are.and rest assured there are big! big! fish lurking.i have hooked an seen them.yes hooked, another story for another day.every fisherman has one!!"
