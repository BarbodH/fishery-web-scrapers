It seemed to me that tourism was down quite a bit. My camp owner has had a small drop in business this year...but....nothing terrible yet. I suppose if ""things"" keep going as have been...business & travelers will continue to drop also. I've been to the same camp since 1993. Always a gr8 time......but I was quite shocked by myself eariler in the spring. I actually considered canceling my adventure. Silly me. I've always said that I'd go...if able.....& by golly after this year...I'll find a way...by ""hook"" or by crook......lol Anyways, fishin was very very good with most species still in a more of a spring pattern....versus summer pattern...as in most walleyes were caught in shallow water. Fished on Lake Minnitaki. Hope this finds all well, EH!!!!!!! john"

The reason I'm critical of unregistered users, (and I don't believe I ever told them to do a search or was overly critical) is because registered users, at the very least, have a reputation here. If I got on here, and said that I had gone to Lac Suel and it was awful, then everyone would know who I was (and could see right through my motives). I've been posting on here for a year, I don't pretend to have been around for the same length of time as some, but I'm not someone who wandered on and never came back. As far as free advertising for my camp, I don't post a link to my website. I don't do as many fishing reports as I used to. I reply and try to add to the conversation in several threads daily. Can a resort owner actually be interested in fishing like everyone else? In a year's time, I have not booked a single group off of walleye central, but I'm still here! I have permission from the site to do what I do, and I'll continue to do that. They also mentioned that unregistered users may be another camp owner or very loyal customer to another camp. Anyhow, in a way, you've made my point. Anyone who posts on here has a risk of being attacked. I'm not accusing you of doing it, but your post was critical of me specifically. The entire year I've been posting, I could've been unregistered and changed my screen name every few posts."

575433,Guest,2008-06-24 15:23:00,0,I have gone to Canada every year but just can't afford to do it this year. Maybe next year we will see how it goes. Seems everyone I know is not going up either. Seems like people are driving less so maybe this is just another result of that. I sure miss it though.
575517,IaCraig,2008-06-26 23:34:00,434,"CampownerChick - Personally I am kinda creeped out that your handle is so sexy but your bio says your a guy. I will end my thoughts on that matter now. Anyway, this site gets a lot more activity when people are anticipating a trip than when they are actually enjoying it. Great people visit this site, but I too kinda get tired of having 10 DWI, crossing the border or favorite beer posts to every 1 related to enjoying the country. Sure money is tight all over, but like always, those who can justify it will and those who cant, wont. Personally, I quit because for now time with the kids is tight, and since my family turned into my fishing partners and I have to foot the entire bill, my wife would prefer I spend the 2-3 grand on a variety of vacations instead of Canada every year. Don't mis understand, there is no greater group of fishing friends than a wife and 2 boys, but there is also Hawaii, Jamaica, Calorado cliff dwellings, Grand canyon and 100 other family destinations competing with Canada. When I get old enough that I smell like i'm dead, but I still got a little vinegar left in me, I'll return to 2-3 trips per year. Until then I got college to save for and beer & burbon to buy. You all have a great 2008. I might end up there in Sept yet, but no guarantees. Since I have a lakehouse in Misouri, I might see if Elmo wants to tag along.

575535,Guest,2008-06-27 12:21:00,0,"If you think there is little interest now, wait until next year if gas and lodging continue their increases. This board is a micro indicator of a macro issue: decreasing demand."
575551,riverrat4797,2008-06-27 22:50:00,3,"I used to post on this and the general site quite a bit. I just got tired of being attacked about my relationship with my girl, beer drinking, etc. Now, I rarely post. My last trip to Canada was in `82. I no longer go to Canada for several reasons. Money is not the major one, as I was there while Carter was president and the exchange rate was WAY in favor of the Canadians. Yes, expense has something to do with it, as I have flit the bill nowadays. However, I just can't find ANYONE willing to go. I mean NO ONE! My old partners have died or quit fishing. I have a Miss. R fishing cabin, so it's not like I don't know a lot of fishermen-with the money to go-they just don't won't. Why? Too much money. Too much driving. Too confusing regulations. Regulations too restrictive. For all the hassles, I'd rather just stay here. All excuses I've heard when trying to get a trip together. Are they legitimate? Who knows. Would I go ""IF"" I could get a few guys together? YOU BET. I sincerely hope I can afford to take the stepson when he gets back from Afghanistan."
575577,Guest,2008-06-29 07:51:00,0,"Thanks for the offer IaCraig. Plenty of water here in Misssouri to fish your cabin might lakeside now if it was not before. A trip to Canada wold now cost me $600.00 to 700.00 dollars in gas only, from here in Missouri. Now I have to look at it as if My wife and I were buying 2 plane tickets to fly into Canada to fish price wise in my mind. Finding people to go is also a problem. Everyone wants to go but when it comes to putting money down people scatter. This might be a nocation year for us and just stay home, and I hate to stay home."
575597,way2goofy,2008-06-29 14:16:00,22,"Me and my group are going in August. LOTW at Sioux Narrows. We just spent about $20,000 on last daughter's wedding June 14th. Here is how I'm raising my money for this years trip. EBAY ! I'm not advertising for Ebay but have raised about $500 for the trip sofar and figure the 3 of us will each need $1000 to be safe. I've only missed one year going since 1970. Something keeps drawing me back - hard to explain. The other part of our group are going on a 3 day fly-in out of Nestor Falls and then joining us for the rest of the week. There will be 7 total when they arrive after the fly-in. My nephew was promised a fly-in when he graduated from college and his dad is keeping the promise. A good friend just got back from LOTW and caught nice walleye and Northern Pike and also found the crappie. Biggest walleye was a 9 lb. another was 7 lb. I saw a pic. of the slab crappies. They were nice sized."
575610,StarcraftJohn,2008-06-29 20:07:00,8,"We are leaving for Lac Seul This Friday, this is our yearly family trip that most of us make, 13 this year (7 adults & 6 kids). We love going and look forward to it all year, planning months ahead and getting everything ready is all part of the experience. The sad part is with 2 trucks and a suburban pulling 3 boats comes down to about $1,800.00 in truck gas alone not counting 2 weeks worth of boat gas. Then you add Passports for everyone next year at $100.00 per adult and $50.00 per kid and it will probably be something a lot closer to home, maybe Missisippi River in MN for Smallmouth. Anyway I check this form out every day and very seldom post anything maybe answer something for someone, But I finally Registered and will make sure that I post a fishing report when I return from Lac Seul. Thanks for all the good info in the past posts. John"
575313,Guest,2008-06-22 13:02:00,0,"Campownerchick, The board is always quieter in the summer, as at any given time, some of the American users are on a Canadian trip, and Canadians like myself are fishing everyday. Now with satellite internet anywhere, many remote summer users can continue to check throughout the season...for many years, I for one didn't check the board once between May and September. And second, those who have frequented WC for 4, or 5, or 6 years and counting see A LOT of repetition, and thus don't post on albeit relevant topics anymore, except perhaps to instruct the 'thread-author' to do a search.

And of course, remember its everybody's opinion, and thank god we don't all agree on everything or it'd get boring pretty fast. As far as interest on the board, for many of us its summer now and after going though winter we want to be outside or getting stuff done that 4 foot of snow stoped us from doing all winter. This year for me sucks, as the guy I was going with to Red Lake this fall had to cancel, and a replacement is looking like it won't happen. I may have a trip to Vermilion (Minn) this fall and its a trip I've wanted to do for many years, basically musky fishing for that 50"" fish I've been trying to find..:) We could always bring up the pros and cons of catch and release and see what happens..:) Just kidding Al"

Part of that is the repetition of questions and part is because my interests have changed. I find myself pursuing other species of fish more and more. But I have already made two trips to Ontario this year chasing walleyes and pike. I even made it up to Obabikon by boat, it's quite a trip from Nestor Falls too. I've been going to Canada for nearly 20 years and hopefully will for many more if I'm able."

My wife would go but it is not the same as a group of 6-8 people, so we have other things we need to do with some x-tra money. I would spend $600.00 -700.00 in gas from here in Missouri to Canada alone, and 2 full days on the road up and back.

There for a while the crabby people jumped on every post that they didn't agree with and that drove many guys off. People would hide behind a fake or unregistered name and snipe away at others. Make remarks that they would not say in person and hide behind anonymity offered by the internet. There are many of the older guys who still use this board and make it a pleasure to use. But you can only discuss the merits of this line vs. that line so many times before it is a bore. New subjects and specific questions usually get a good honest answer from guys with a lot of time on the water. In answer to your question.... The Canada board has been quieter than past seasons. Many guys trips are now or soon. And remember that there are far more readers than participants on this forum. Which camp are you from? Don't be shy! Pooch"

575310,Bill Krejca,2008-06-22 11:31:00,6107,"Besides the economic reasons already given for less forum participation, the time of the year seems to also be a factor. Prior to heading up, and over the winter, most Canada zealots, if we may call them that, become in need of a ""fix"". This can come in the form of an inquiry such as ""who's going where"", or just a statement made to arouse a few folks on a quasi-emotional subject. These threads are usually fun to read and help most of us to make it through the long winter. After the trip is over(like now for many folks), the realities of life in the now world seem to kick in, and although with good intentions, the trip report promised sometimes gets lost in the myriad activities of modern survival. Along about August, the fall trip inquiries should start rolling in. (If we keep this thread about fewer threads going, we'll do our part.) Have a good one,"
