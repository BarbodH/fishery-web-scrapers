575328,Guest,2008-06-22 18:40:00,0,Heading up to minnitaki lake this friday. Fishing out of Donnellys lodge. Mainly want to target walleyes and lake trout. Any current reports? What depth of water are walleyes in? Minnows/leeches/crawlers? What depth and baits are being used for lakers right now? Thanks! jerrycanjoe

I suppose this will change as the summer progresses. Most bass were caught on live bait....that I relate to lack of mayflies(stated seeing a few late in the week). Water levels are much higher than last year. I'd be more than happy to answere any more ???? pertaining to Minnitaki. I've been on Minnitaki in Aug.1993 & June1994-2008. I love the 3rd week of June!!!!!!!!!!! john"
