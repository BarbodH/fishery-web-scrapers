And I think Steve was just telling you to clean your fish when you get to the bank, throw the guts on a rock. And pick up after yourself and you should not have any problems. I do not think Steve would ever be a smart A$$ and assume you were doing anything wrong. Just reminding us all to pick up after ourselves, keeping the area as clean or cleaner than when you got there. Thus avoiding a ticket or bad Reputation."
575467,Pooch,2008-06-25 08:44:00,4619,"I just spoke with the Ministry Supervisor from the Sioux Lookout office about having filleted fish in the boat. He said ""Fish must be left whole while on the water"". Pretty much what most here on WC have said. I hope I've not caused any confusion on this subject, but I needed to get it correct for our group and I know guys who clean fish in the boat and others who don't. I also (politely) called the 800-667-1940 number and advised them that I was getting the wrong information from that office on the same question. As the late Paul Harvey used to so eloquently say ""and now you know the rrrest of the story"". Thanks for all of the input from everyone. Pooch"

575479,Pooch,2008-06-25 14:16:00,4619,"Chezzz, I hate to speed things along for Mr. Harvey. I think it was his wife who passed away recently. Sorry. Pooch"
575484,Guest,2008-06-25 16:54:00,0,that makes a lot more sence. how in the world could anyone enforce slot limits if you could filet fish on the water? thanks for the info.
575486,Guest,2008-06-25 18:40:00,0,yes my wife said it was his wife that had died. If they fillet the fish in the boat what do they do with the carcass? I would think it against the rules to dump it in the water.

575511,Guest,2008-06-26 14:28:00,0,"How do these rules come into play for shore-lunches? Does one have to fillet the fish 'on shore'? What do you do with the carcasses, take them back to camp? Feed them to the gulls/eagles? Seriously."
575529,Guest,2008-06-27 10:32:00,0,"After cleaning your fish that you wish to Eat for lunch on shore, the remains will be gladly accepted for donation by the flying rats (seagulls) or Eagles, or any other needy critter that inhabit the shoreline. They need to eat as well. It's the paper plates, cups, cigarette butts, and other litter that will get you in trouble. And remember to completely extinguish your fire, the local inhabitants do not have a fire department, nor wish to deal with it after you are gone."
575537,Guest,2008-06-27 12:41:00,0,"You didn't answer any of my questions. And, we do not litter. So, please don't assume. You know what they say about assuming. It makes an AS.... out of U and ME."
575539,Guest,2008-06-27 13:34:00,0,"I believe Steve answered your questions. Leave the carcasses on a rock on the shore. Something will find them. I do not think he was assuming u would be littering, just warning you that if you do and get caught you may be ticketed. Relax Man! Between the Seagulls, Eagles Bears and other critters they will be gone in days."
