We just thread them thru the nose on the jig and fish them the same way.. Like many baits, there are people who have good things to say about gulp, and other people have had negative experiences.. I fish for Walleye's in Wisconsin and I agree that on most days a live minnow will out fish Gulp.. But in Canada, our group has had great success with gulp on jigs and a few bags will last us the whole trip.. The only thing I know that does not work as well are the gulp crawlers on harnesses.. For some reason we only have good luck with real crawlers using harnesses with bottom bouncers in Canada.."
575595,way2goofy,2008-06-29 14:04:00,22,"I have used Gulp 3"" leeches. They worked well for walleye. I recomend a trailer hook as the leeches are a bit brittle and break. At $4.00 a dozen you want them to stay on your hook. I did catch alot more walleye with the trailer hook added. I bought Gulp shinners and am told they are not as brittle. I bought the 16 oz. tub. but haven't used them yet."
575396,Guest,2008-06-23 18:40:00,0,anyone use these in canada yet for walleye?
575400,onemorecast,2008-06-23 19:47:00,23,"Yes, they worked, but not as well as live minnows. On the upside, they are very durable and in total less expensive than live bait. I will use them again."
575401,Glenman12,2008-06-23 19:51:00,762,"Yes several in our group of 12 used then and had success with them..also caught a lot of smallies using them too..a friend who fished somewhere near Kenora said his guide caught a 31"" walleye using the Gulp Alive shiners"
575402,Obabikon,2008-06-23 20:17:00,2370,"I have had 20+ guests using them... seem to be as good or better than minnows (which shocked me). A group of guests brought the worms... they worked great. Cut them in half, and jig. Anyhow, I havent' personally used them, but I don't feel a bit nervous about recommending them."
575403,Guest,2008-06-23 21:06:00,0,"We have used the regular Gulp minnows with good success for the last three years..My brother bought some of the 5"" Gulp Shiners this year and they worked great.. The only problem is they were a little bit too big so we needed to cut off the heads or use a wide gap jig to get a good hook set..You can usually catch numerous fish on single gulp minnow.. We are sold on them.."
575411,stumcfar,2008-06-24 07:26:00,451,"Our group used them in the Ear Falls area. We had 3 days of tremendous fishing, despite the weather. The gulp alive was virtually worthless. It is true, gulp alive is much more durable, in fact you could have used the same one all day. You may have even caught one or two fish on it. Pay the extra for a little more live bait."
575424,Guest,2008-06-24 12:49:00,0,"I was on Lake Dumoine in Quebec the 1st week of June. A couple guys in our group had them, one had 3"" one 4"". They both did very well, like 40 fish/day. Using crawlers with jigs and/or harnesses the most I caught was 17 in one day. On this lake there are few perch and the gulp minnow looked a lot like the primary forage fish."
575546,walleyeduran,2008-06-27 18:02:00,286,"Stumcfar, you have to remember when you are fishing gulp compared to live minnows, you have to fish them differently and also set the hook differently. I like fishing meat, but I have had very good results fihing gulp."
575558,Guest,2008-06-28 11:43:00,0,whats the difference? How do you fish them differently and what's with the hook set?
575583,Guest,2008-06-29 08:51:00,0,"I'm curious also as to how to ""rig them"" for fishing success? What do you do differently?"
