Anything worthwhile off the side roads that radiate from 502? Or I should ask anything any one will share! My wife, son and I and it will be CPR... We hope to see a few moose and bear on the trip up and back.. We saw 18 moose between Int'l falls and Ear falls two years ago on our last trip.. Amazing! thanks for any help in advance LH"
