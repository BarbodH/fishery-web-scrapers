575419,fisheagle,2008-06-24 11:08:00,44,"I am currntly trying this stuff and feel I've been scammed. It is supposed to disappear in the water, but I find it is more visible in the water than almost any other line except HI-VIS stuff. Now maybe fish eyes work differently than humans but it leaves me with the feeling that I am spooking more fish than before. Anyone have similar (or contradictory) thoughts?"
575421,Guest,2008-06-24 11:24:00,0,"I don't know about the visibility of the line, for a fish. Very seldom have I been out fished with this line, so I don't think its visible. I've been using this 2 years and I love it. Very strong and you can feel the lightest tap."
575431,pmarasco,2008-06-24 14:13:00,13,"I bought it (hook line and sinker - ba-da-bum). In my opinion, it didn't work at all. The same setup using the ""smoke"" color worked three times as well even after putting a mono leader on the crystal. I ended up using the crystal for lake trout fishing only."
575446,Guest,2008-06-24 19:55:00,0,"Without too much detail, I am using it for the first time this year and I have been out fished with the smoke fireline, even with identical leaders! I have even been outfished on a bottom bouncer! Junk"
575468,Guest,2008-06-25 09:14:00,0,"Well there must be something to this stuff that I am missing because I just couldn't keep it from breaking around the knot. Tried several different knots with wet line and just found the stuff to be brittle as heck. It's like the tightness of the knot would break itself.....either way, I'm not monkeying with this stuff again. And I agree that it is very visible."

575473,mwal,2008-06-25 11:56:00,151,I have been using fireline crystal 14lb on my lindy rod. I can detect bite better and think i have caught more fish. My setup 4 ft of 12lb mono to sinker swivel then a leader 24 inches to 8 ft to hook floater etc. I can feel everything better than my partners using straight mono and usually out fish them. To attach leader I'm using back to back uni knots and have never had one fail
575476,Guest,2008-06-25 13:35:00,0,"I agree with mwal. I have been using crytsal for two years and have had no problem with it up in Canada. I use it in reservoirs in Nebraska, and it has caused me no problems here either. As far as bottom bouncing, I have no problems with crystal tied TO the bouncer and my spinner or snell is tied with flouro. I jig with 6 lb crystal on my ultralite and tie directly to the jig. No problems with it either. I use a palomar knot and the knot holds up fine. The only problem I have had is cutting the knot away from the crank or whatever I am using. My suggestion is fish with what you are comfortable with. Fish On!!"
575478,Guest,2008-06-25 13:47:00,0,"Never used the crystal. But the smoke is a killer for me,I wanted to try the crystal but I have plenty of the smoke to use. I have 2 rods W/ 6# that I have used since 2000. all I did is to spool the line on backwards to another reel. Now all the line that was on the bottom of the old spool and in good shape is on a reel and the old is at the bottom. I use a small pair of cutters on my leatherman to cut the line. The only problem I have is breaking the 6# line when I get hung up. Wrap it around a boat paddle or you will cut your hands or fingers off! My wife caught a 27 # grass carp with 6# line. and a 16# pike with no leader. I don't think I will ever go back to mono."
