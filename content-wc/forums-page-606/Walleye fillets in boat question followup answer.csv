575356,Pooch,2008-06-23 09:38:00,4619,I just spoke with the MNR (800-667-1940) and the young lady told me it was legal to fillet your fish and keep it in the boat cooler. Leave a patch of skin on just as if you were going to take it home. Pooch
575361,Guest,2008-06-23 10:47:00,0,"Thanks, that is what I thought the answer would be."
575364,v-bay gord,2008-06-23 11:04:00,3168,"From the 2008-2009 Ontario fishing regulations.......""fish taken from waterbodies where size limits are in effect must be readily measurable at all times"". It goes on to list the exceptions which include preparing for immediate consumption, prepared at an overnight accomodation, transportation from a temporary accomodation to place of residence, and transportation overland. In other words, unless there are no size restrictions on the water body you are fishing, the fish must be left whole (able to be measured) while you are on the water. This only makes sense since filleting them on the lake only gives a loop-hole to play games with slot sizes or other length restrictions."
575369,dewyg,2008-06-23 11:43:00,1006,"Like I said! Do not fillet on the lake, how can they measure the fish."
575372,Pooch,2008-06-23 11:57:00,4619,"Fellows, I just called the Ontario MNR again and talked to a different agent and she also said that it IS legal to clean the fish, leaving some skin intact, place in a cooler and eat them that night. My guess is that that is the same as immediate consumption. Hope I haven't confused anyone. I'm still going to ask a MNR guy when I see one next week. Fishing reg's are confusing and seem to be open for interpretation. Pooch"
575380,v-bay gord,2008-06-23 13:00:00,3168,"The point that is being confused is the part of the fisheries regulation on page 9 of the 2008-2009 fishing regulations summary....specifically under the heading ""Transporting Sport Fish In Ontario"" ""Anglers need to ensure they are transporting fish in compliance with the regulations, which are designed to protect fisheries resources. The fish that you catch and keep may be cleaned. However, please remember that FISH TAKEN FROM WATERBODIES WHERE SIZE LIMITS ARE IN EFFECT MUST BE READILY MEASURABLE AT ALL TIMES, UNLESS the fish are: *being prepared for immediated consumption *prepared at an overnight accomodation for storage *being transported on the water from a temporary overnight accomodation to your residence and you are not engaged in sport fishing. *being transported overland. The point that needs to be stressed is if you are transporting cleaned fish around the lake (that has size restrictions) while you are still fishing (not immediately consuming them) then I would venture to say you are not in compliance with the above regulation.....but then again maybe the person on the phone is interpreting things differently. Seems clear to me though."

575384,v-bay gord,2008-06-23 13:36:00,3168,"Desk jockey might be a little harsh, as I just talked to one of them and they were very pleasant and helpful.....although admittedly wrong on the issue at hand. There are hundreds of area specific / lake specific regulations that apply to Ontario lakes. It is difficult for a summer student sitting in Toronto to know the variables. She indicated she would address the issue with her supervisor and actually had a look at the topic on Walleye Central. I think future calls might get a better answer. Phoning a district office (ie Kenora, Dryden, Red Lake) would be a more sure fire approach.....you could talk to the CO who might be the person doing the ticket writing."
575385,Goldeneagle,2008-06-23 13:45:00,78,I'm a desk jockey today although my name is on the sign that hangs above the front door.
575440,Guest,2008-06-24 16:42:00,0,We paid a fine 4 years ago on Sturgeon for this exact thing. We had a shore lunch and couldn't eat all the fish so while transporting back to camp we got it. Fish had skin on them. 3 fish in cooler and 3 fisherman in boat. He told us they had to be measurable since Sturgeon has a slot limit. He said gut the fish and keep in cooler that way. Only $100 fine we just didn't know the rule.
