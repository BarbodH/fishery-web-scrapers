575512,Guest,2008-06-26 14:43:00,0,"Worldclass: Walleye: 35"" and bigger Pike: 50"" and biggerWallHanger: Walleye: 30"" and bigger Pike: 40"" and bigger Remember, we're talking WORLDCLASS here."
575542,prov1900,2008-06-27 16:46:00,544,"Numbers mixed with size. Two years in a row, I have caught Ontario Master Angler (C&R) two years in a row. Pike last year and lake trout this year. I would call that world class any day of the week. Last year, one of our patches were for walleye. This year we had 5 lake trout that qualified. Boreal forest background is a big help too!!!"
575547,Guest,2008-06-27 18:53:00,0,"What are measurements for Master Angler? If they are like In Fisherman's 28"" and above for walleye then it is not world class to me. I agree with first post. Or perhaps weight should determine it. 15+ pound walleye and 30+ pound pike could be world class."
575556,Atlanta Dave,2008-06-28 09:18:00,323,I agree the master angler program at least in Manitoba is nowhere near world class a 41 inch pike only weighs about 16 lbs at best.I have many pike over 20 lbs up to 25 1/2 and I wont consider it world class till it hits 30 lbs. Leave for Lac La Marte Wed hope to get the 30. Atlanta Dave
