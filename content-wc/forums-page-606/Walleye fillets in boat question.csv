575506,Guest,2008-06-26 10:12:00,0,"That would not be true, there are houseboats with fires in them all over."
575508,Obabikon,2008-06-26 12:39:00,2370,"I hadnt' thought about that, but are those considered the same as fishing boats?"
575513,A Canuck,2008-06-26 15:04:00,86,"No. House boats are not the same as fishing boats as they have a head and are considered floating cottages. Which is why you are allowed to consume alcohol on a house boat, if anchored. AC"
575599,Capn Hooker,2008-06-29 15:37:00,333,"I only did that one time. All the cooking gear took up a lot of space in the boat. But it was fun anyhow and you can't get fish fresher than that.

575447,Pooch,2008-06-24 19:56:00,4619,I think I agree with most of you guys. I'm still going to ask the first MNR guy I run into. Probably just throw the fish whole in the cooler. Thanks for everyone's replies. Pooch
575449,2746,2008-06-24 21:04:00,3206,"We have always kept fillets from the previous day for shore lunch. That means, for example, on Monday night we put some fillets in the freezer to take out on Tuesday in the shore lunch box, packed just like they would be to go home. We count them in our totals so we are not over our possesion limit. We were checked on Gullrock a couple of years ago while we were getting shore lunch ready and showed them what we were doing. They took our cabin # and said those would count in our possesion limit and we said we knew that. They wished us well and I presume they checked the freezer at 5 lakes where we were staying. I've never looked it up in the regs to verify if it was legal but they sure didn't say anything."

575485,Guest,2008-06-25 18:31:00,0,"Every year we go to Canada, we will take some filleted walleyes which were caught the previous day in the cooler in our boat for shore lunch and never had a problem. Camp owners have told us this is fine with the Game wardens as long as we are within our limits of fish on the boat and in camp. I think people need to stop giving game wardens a bad rap as most are reasonable. They are out there doing their job and not trying to give the fisherman a hard time. Have met the wardens at the resort dock and were checked without any issues. Both men were plesant and professional. Wingmann"
575490,Obabikon,2008-06-25 20:27:00,2370,"As long as they were caught the day before, then that's legal."
575492,Obabikon,2008-06-25 20:28:00,2370,"Also, that wasn't really the question. The question focused on if you're allowed to clean fish caught that day in the boat."
575495,Guest,2008-06-25 22:31:00,0,"""glad to see you boys. We were just fixing to have a shore lunch. cxare to join us? We ain't got anything but these filets but that's the way we like our lubches.Never cared for beans or potaoes."""
575498,Guest,2008-06-26 05:43:00,0,Thanks for the invite boys. I notice you have no cooking utensils. Theres also 12 fillets that are all nice size. Pretty big appetite huh. You're in contravention of our law and I have to write you up. The judge will sort it out. I need your equipment which may be returned to you at your court date. If you keep up with the shore lunch thing I will charge you as well with lying to an officer. ($1000 fine). Any questions fellas
575501,Capn Hooker,2008-06-26 08:39:00,333,"So we were out on Gull Rock one time catching eyes. At lunchtime we fired up the Coleman stove, filleted a few fish and cooked and ate them right in the boat for an ""offshore"" lunch. We put the remains in a zip lock bag and disposed of them when we got back to camp. Any problem with that?

575338,Guest,2008-06-23 02:41:00,0,...and then you cross the international date line...is another limit legal?

Most of the time it's >probably not a problem, but I've heard of fines being imposed >for just that. > >So what happens when the guide is in the fish house and is cleaning your catch? He could be guiding 2-3 people and they could be in their cabin preparing dinner."
575343,dewyg,2008-06-23 06:29:00,1006,"You cannot do that, I tried that and the officer told me that it has to at your residence (camp). He told me he could charge me because he could not tell how long the fish were. He let me off with a warning!"
575350,retire55,2008-06-23 08:13:00,1029,"Just because a fisherman has reached his daily catch limit or his possession limit of walleye, he is not required to stop fishing for walleye in Ontario. Here's an excerpt from Ontario's fishing regulations - see page 3 at http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/198219.pdf ""If you catch a fish after reaching the daily catch or possession limit for that species, the fish must be released immediately back to the water (see A change to Ontario's Catch and Retain Rules, on the next page). If the limit is zero, anglers may practise catch and release only and any fish caught must be released immediately back into the water in a manner that does not harm the fish."" Just an opinion - Ontario's new Catch and Retain Rules represent a new threat to fishing resources and a cave-in to one group of stakeholders."
575353,phishfearme,2008-06-23 08:36:00,1242,"55 - thanks for the point and i stand corrected. i thought though that there was a reg about ""targeting"" a species after you've caught the limit. maybe it's a local US reg i was thinking about. phish"
575390,jokerjim,2008-06-23 16:51:00,473,I wonder how they can check the length when it is at you cabin and not in your boat.
575394,Guest,2008-06-23 17:53:00,0,Unless you are guilty until proven innocent in Canada isn't the burden of proof on the CO/MNR to prove you did something illegal? If I'm doing things legal I could give a rats you know what about who might think what based on one way or the other.
575395,Guest,2008-06-23 18:01:00,0,"Here is a section I pulled from the Ontario Fishing reg's 08/09 Transporting Sport Fish in Ontario Anglers need to ensure they are transporting fish in compliance with the regulations, which are designed to protect fisheries resources. The fish that you catch and keep may be cleaned. However, please remember that fish taken from waterbodies where size limits are in effect must be readily measurable at all times, unless the fish are: Being prepared for immediate consumption Prepared at an overnight accommodation for storage Being transported on the water from a temporary overnight accommodation to your residence and you are not engaged in sport fishing Being transported overland. I would say you CANNOT fillet your fish out in the boat, unless you are having a shore lunch. Hope this helps."
575437,Guest,2008-06-24 16:29:00,0,We paid a fine for this a few years ago. They told us we could gut the fish and put them in a cooler as long as they could measure them.
575314,Pooch,2008-06-22 14:19:00,4619,I've sent an email to the Ontario MNR asking them this. I suspect I won't get and answer back before we leave. Will ask our camp owner also. Is it legal to fillet a walleye and put it in my cooler (skin intact) while in the boat for supper that night? It makes no sense to drag a dead walleye around on a stringer all day then clean him back at camp that evening. I know it counts on my license limit. Pooch
575316,phishfearme,2008-06-22 15:25:00,1242,"pooch - i'm 99% sure that possession is possession weather the fish are live on a stringer, dead in a cooler, frozen fillets in the freezer or fillets on ice in your boat. the only issue would be if say you have a conservation license (2 walleye limit) and have two walleyes filleted in your boat cooler - then you're done fishing - at least for walleyes. you can always continue pike fishing. seems though it would be difficult to prove that you WEREN'T pike fishing even without a limit of walleye. phish"
575323,retire55,2008-06-22 17:32:00,1029,"While I don't think it would illegal to fillet a walleye in your boat and put it in your cooler, you might run into difficulty trying to prove you satisfied any length limits applicable on the lake you are fishing."
575324,Guest,2008-06-22 18:00:00,0,The same can be said for fisherman who fillet a walleye to take home. I think I would take my changes and just fillet it if you don't want to drag it around dead all day.
575329,Obabikon,2008-06-22 19:07:00,2370,"Will you be keeping the fish guts in the boat with you, or throwing them in the lake? Make sure you put them on shore somewhere, and not just toss them overboard. Other than that, my understanding is that it's 100% legal."
575330,Goldeneagle,2008-06-22 19:50:00,78,"Sorry to disagree, but I believe we need to take the whole fish to camp or shore lunch location for dressing. Don't take a chance unless you're certain. Also don't have one guy cleaning two limits in the fish cleaning house while the other guy is in your cabin peeling potatoes and heating the cooking oil. One guy, alone, cleaning two limits is over and subject to a hefty fine. It sounds crazy, but it's happened."
575332,Matches,2008-06-22 20:43:00,236,"Goldeneagle is correct. I've run into this question before. It is Not legal to fillet fish in your boat and then keep them in your cooler. You can fillet them if you are going to eat them right away such as at shore-lunch, but short of that you have to clean them back at the resort. Check this link out:http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_163582.html"
575333,Guest,2008-06-22 20:49:00,0,"If you are in the fish house cleaning fish while the other guys are getting dinner ready, you are not gonna get in trouble. Stop spreading fear. People do it all the time. If that applies, then what happens if I have the limit for 4 people in the freezer, and two guys are out fishing, leaving only two in the cabin? Oh no...they are gonna get in trouble!!!! No they are not."
575335,Goldeneagle,2008-06-22 20:59:00,78,"Dave B, I'm not into spreading fear. Most of the time it's probably not a problem, but I've heard of fines being imposed for just that."
575337,Muskygary,2008-06-23 01:11:00,137,"Also, here's a quick question. Three guys out fishing, four walleye in the boat. One guy has to have a limit and must stop fishing right?"
