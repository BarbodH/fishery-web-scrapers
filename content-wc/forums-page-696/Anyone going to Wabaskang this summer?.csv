558144,Guest,2006-06-07 09:34:00,0,I just got back from the Wabaskang and we stayed at Sleepy Dog. We have been going to Perrault Falls area for 25 years and this place has the nicest cabins you'll find in NWO. What a great place and the owner is one #### of a guy. The cabins were immaculate and the boat/motor combination was hard to beat. The north end of the lake is where everyone was fishing with success.
558145,Guest,2006-06-07 09:41:00,0,I highly recommend Sleepy Dog.

556171,Guest,2006-04-12 13:46:00,0,Any of you Wabby fishermen ever portage into Wine lake. I been going to Wine long time but have never fished Wabby . Anyone ever stay at Sleepy Dog am thinkin about tryin that next summer.
556241,waleht,2006-04-16 04:53:00,132,"Back when I was a younger buck I did portage into Wine from Wabaskang. It was not the easiest and I was in much better shape back then. As far as sleepy dog...I have not stayed there, but did stop by last spring and checked out there cabins. They were in the process of building some new cabins, but I was not impressed with the layout of the rest of the property. I would recommend to check out Jim & Julie's Wabaskang Camp. I have been staying at Wabaskang Camp for over a couple of decades now and relly like their layout. Their prices are reasonable and the camp is well maintianed. The dock is incredible!"
556296,Trailerguy,2006-04-18 09:12:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b] I got back from Wabby last night. Sunshine and 70+ degrees all weekend, it was great! The ice is very black, with water laying on top in many places. Since the ice wasn't safe for fishing, we took the 4 wheelers out on some of the logging roads, and found some nice moose sheds. It looks like ice out will be earlier than last year by a few days. Rainy Lake was ice covered last friday, but wide open when we went across the bridge yesterday. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
556318,sidewinder,2006-04-18 22:07:00,96,We went to Wine Lake last year with our wives and had a good time. Fishing was not the best a good time was had. We are coming to Wabaskang this spring May27-June3 mainly from reading your posts. Any advice and hints would be greatly appreciated. Will you be up there during that timeframe? Maybe we could get together for a few beverages. We will be staying at Dave Peffrey's(sp).Seems like a great guy. Also we want to give Wine Lake another chance so we will be short portage away.

556375,meie0062,2006-04-20 22:25:00,28,"Jim & Julie's - Sure do! Those two are the best - friendly, helpful, and you offer Julie a medium rare steak, and she'll pound it down just like one of the guys :) She really unwinds at the end of the season - just ask her about the ""candie-canes"" last fall, when Jim went to help the moose hunters drag a bull out of a swamp.... My annual trip is in the last week in September. Nothing like the full-effect (rain, wind, cold, and snow all at once) to put hair on your chest. My first year up there the sun came out for a total of 97 minutes. ####, was that first year a blast. I've only been going on this trip for 3 years now. The 'eldest' has been going up there for 30 years, my dad about 20, and everyone after that are under 10 years. I'm just waiting for the time I get caught doing something foolish and I end up in a 'Wabby Legend'. I'm glad I waited until I was older. I could have never handled the weather that time of year. After my first year fishing, I came up with the 'Fall Fishing Lake Wabby' test: Put your hands in a bucket of ice water for 10 minutes, and if you can still tie off a jig in 60 seconds, then your OK to go!"
556518,Guest,2006-04-25 18:54:00,0,I hear Ice is out and water is low any truth to that rumor.
556573,Trailerguy,2006-04-25 22:17:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]The water/ice was low 10 days ago, a typical fall level. It would suprise me if the ice isn't off by now, it was rotting and water covered then. Typically the level doesn't start to rise for a week or so after ice out, it takes a while for the snow melt to get that far through the system. It all depends, on how much rain falls before the opener. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

How far are the hot spots? What >are the best methods. Also, any smallmouth opportunities? > We'll be there two weeks behind you. There is great fishing within 10 minutes of camp. Best bet for walleyes is jig and minnow. Chartreuse is my color of choice 75 percent of the time. I've also had good luck jigging Hopkins spoons. Sometimes they will bite on the bare bait and at other times you'll do well tipping the treble hook with half a minnow (either half will work). We do very little trolling. The fish are typically 20-35 feet deep by this time of the year. Dave will tell you where the fish have been biting, but be sure to try Devil's Point south of camp. You won't believe the structure there. A lot of big fish are caught there. There are also several good spots west of Birch Island that are very productive. We've caught a lot of nice fish all along the shoreline off the rocks west of Birch in 18-25 feet of water. Also try deeper water east of the big point that juts out west of Birch Island. They will frequently be 28-32 feet deep. The south side of Birch can be very good as well at times. For smallmouth, there is shallow water on the east side of the island just south of camp that is smallmouth heaven when they are hitting. You'll just have to see what they are hitting on. Somedays it's tubes, other days crankbaits, and other days spinners. Also for smallmouth try casting crankbaits or tubes into the shallow rocks just inside the entrance to Mean Lake which is east and slightly north of camp. 15-18 inch smallmouth are plentiful and we've had many in excess of 20 inches in the last several years. Wabby is turning into a great smallmouth fishery. If things are normal, you should have a very productive week and you'll enjoy your stay at Pefley's."
555354,Guest,2006-03-12 22:21:00,0,Do to some schedule conflicts we will be going in July this year. This will be our 14th year at Peffley's Camp (formerly Lundy's) and we have high expectations as always.If the past is any indication Wabaskang won't let us down!
555362,Guest,2006-03-13 12:21:00,0,July usually is a good fishing month up there. The only thing that has given us trouble is a bug hatch towards the middle of the month. The fishing is still pretty good even with that happening.
555904,Guest,2006-04-02 19:59:00,0,Going to Wine in June and was just wondering where some good smallmouth and walleye spots on the north end of wabaskang are near the portage into Wine.
555906,waleht,2006-04-03 04:59:00,132,"I will be there May 27 - June 3 and Sept 2nd - 9th. I always stay at Jim and Julies Wabaskang Camp. Have been going there for 25+ years and been through 3 different owners. Clean cabins and a very clean fish house. He empties all the fish pails every night and cleans it every morning with a power sprayer and disenfectant. Plus there are three full size chest freezers for your fish. The rest of the camps on Wabaskang seem to be crowded together near the falls. Wabaskang camp is by itself about 5 miles south of everyone else. The driveway to get into the camp is five miles long...talk about off the road. Little did I know Wabaskang was such a popular place. I do admit I am a little jealous that some of you guys are going to get to be up there 5+ weeks, but then again some don't get to go at all. Does any one else go to Jim & Julies Wabaskang camp?"
555930,Trailerguy,2006-04-03 22:37:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Big Mike, who posts here, is Jim's brother, I think said he'll be up several times this summer. If the warm weather holds up there, I may try going up to the cottage over Easter weekend for trout. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
555932,waleht,2006-04-04 05:54:00,132,Cottage???? What part of the lake do you have a cottage? I fish Aerobus bay a lot and would love a cottage in there. Speaking of that....any info on the ins and outs of buying property in Canada if your a US citizen?
555937,Trailerguy,2006-04-04 09:05:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I'm in the SE corner, beyond the 1 st narrows. Buying property isn't too diferent than in the US, generally the taxes are reasonable. I bought when the exchange rate was $1.50 so that helped.We have a year round road on our end. The cottages on Aerobus might as well be considered boat-in, their ""road"" is poorly maintained and best left to mountian goats with hip waders. They do have cell phone coverage out there now I believe. One of my neighbors has his place for sale, he wants to go back to Manitoba to be near his grandkids. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

The fish cleaning house, probably one of the nicest in Canada, is kept clean and doesn't smell. The new owner, Dave Peffley, is a hard worker and attentive to his guests' needs. You already know about the fishing if you fish up there. We seldom stray more than ten minutes from camp. For me, it's the perfect vacation."
