558447,digjig,2006-06-14 10:59:00,146,What would you buy? What do you look for in a hand held gps? I'd like to take advantage of the Navionics add ons but am open to other options.

558453,Guest,2006-06-14 13:58:00,0,The best price I could find was $169.99 for the black and white and 269.99 for the color and 369.99 for the color plus. anyone find it cheaper?
558455,Hawker,2006-06-14 16:39:00,3967,Lowrance IFinder H20 hands down!! Be sure and get it with the Map Create 6 softeware for lots of functionality (sp)!! Hawker
558456,Guest,2006-06-14 17:02:00,0,"If you want to use navionics products definitely get the H2O (i recommend the color version). If you don't care about the navionics maps then get the new garmin unit (can't remember what it is called). For the money I think the Lowrance H2O is your best bet, you can get the color version (H2O) cheaper than the black and white garmin unit if I remember correctly."
558472,digjig,2006-06-15 09:47:00,146,"Thanks Gents, I am a newbie to the site and am already addicted. Thanks for the great info. From my searching, I believe the Lowrance Hunt C and the H20 c have the same ""waterproof"" specs. Does the Map Create 6 software only come with the 'Plus' option? Also, Lowrance says their memory card slot is an SD (Secure Digital) while Navionics says their cards are CF (Compact Flash). Does anyone have a Lowrance iFinder H2O or Hunt using a Navionics card? Just want to be sure before I plunk down some $'s. Thanks again for the comments."
558489,Hawker,2006-06-15 16:27:00,3967,"Yes, the Navionics cards will run/work well in the H20! I have the new Canada card and though just slightly dissapointed it does not show the hazards (known rock piles etc) as promised it would, it works very very well and is very accurate. Am pretty sure the Map Create 6 comes only with the plus models, but your only paying extra for Map Create 6 in that package anyway. It is well worth the extra though to have MP6. You can go to the Lowrance website and find the unit you want to look at and it will show/tell you all of the other brands etc of cards that you can use. I don't have the H20-C, I have the monochrome model, but I luv it and don't go anywhere without it. Have had a couple of Garmins, but I'll never go back after having a Lowrance, but Garmin does make some good units as well. Another thing you can do on the Lowrance website is download one of their virtual units and get a hands on with it right there at your computer and it will give you a good idea how well it works. Good luck, hope you find what will make a great unit for you! Hawker"
