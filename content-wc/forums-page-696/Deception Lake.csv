I am thinking about trying it this summer. Also, I think there is an earthen landing into the creek that connects Deception lake and Deception Bay on the opposite side of the road from the Deception Bay Landing. Has anyone ever put in there and would I be able to get a 17 footer in at that spot? Thanks. Big Ern"
