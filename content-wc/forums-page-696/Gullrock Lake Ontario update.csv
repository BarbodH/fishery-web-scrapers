I was only there for 5 or 6 minutes since I had work to do at home. Of course this was a Saturday morning and it is change over day so I couldn't see any other boats on the lake and where they were fishing."
558030,Minnow Man,2006-06-03 21:34:00,85,Hello Ihawk22 To get current updates on Gullrock lake fishing go to the What's New section of www.goldenhookcamp.com web site. They are always giving a updated fishing report on Gullrock Lake. It's an interesting read.

Must have been an early spawn because we were catching fish deeper than is normal for opening week (18 -25'). Fishermans point, Burnt Island, the hump, and the channel into Keg were all popular spots during that week. We could find them off most points and Islands, relating to structure, in the above mentioned depths. We had little to no luck on flats although we had a couple days of thunder storms that may have driven them deeper."

558148,grt1,2006-06-07 10:18:00,259,"my neighbour was out yesterday, he tells me there were 60 boats in the bay at the entrance to ranger creek. they were catching fish and this seemed like the only spot on the lake for walleye I've been getting smalll sauger in 30 feet but no walleye."
558458,Tonyo,2006-06-14 17:30:00,212,"Just got back on Sunday and was there june 3-10. As previously mentioned, most of the fish were in the mouth of Ranger creek for the first 4 days and then the weather turned cool. In general the fishing this year was not as good as the past but was still pretty good. We boated several fish over 20"" with the largest of our group 25""."
558461,Guest,2006-06-14 20:22:00,0,In the past we've seen tons of small fish caught at the mounth of Ranger Creek so we moved to the small island in ranger and caught a crap load of eyes. Fish the windward side of the small island.

558555,Guest,2006-06-18 10:49:00,0,We just returned from Gullrock 9-17 June. Fishing was not as good as in the past years. This was our 7th year. Fish were hard to find at times. We caught them in Ranger bay in 5-8 foot of water aroung the weed beds then also caught them in up to 30 foot of water off of the points. The weather was just too nice I think for the fishing to be good. It was almost 90 the last day we fished. Water temp was aroung 68 degrees. Good Luck
