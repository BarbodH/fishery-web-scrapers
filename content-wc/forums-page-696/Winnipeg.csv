558554,GatorGuy,2006-06-18 09:52:00,15,LOL. I was at Hooters TOO long yesterday afternoon! If your talking about next weekend (23rd-25th) the Bombers (CFL football) are playing in town Friday night. We also have a AA baseball team (Goldeyes) with a beautiful new balllpark but not sure if they're home or away next weekend. We have a great zoo (Assiniboine Park) aswell.
