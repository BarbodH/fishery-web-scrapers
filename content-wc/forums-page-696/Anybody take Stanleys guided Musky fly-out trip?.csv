558406,Crappie Kid,2006-06-13 13:15:00,1581,We are heading to Eagle Lake in July and was looking for feedback on Stanley's guided catch and release Musky fly out trip.
558412,Guest,2006-06-13 15:35:00,0,My son and I took the option 3 years ago and it was a great experience. Take the fly rod and some surface baits as well as some Mepps spinners and you will have a ball. We had 30 + fish up to 13 pounds. Marv guided us and it was definitely time well spent.
558413,Crappie Kid,2006-06-13 15:41:00,1581,Do they provide any rods or tackle or just transportation?
558419,Guest,2006-06-13 20:05:00,0,Your equipment. They fly you in and give you guidance
558473,Crappie Kid,2006-06-15 11:01:00,1581,$400 for a one day trip and no equipment available. Is this standard practice?
558475,Guest,2006-06-15 11:43:00,0,"5-10 pound fish........a spinning rod with maybe some #5 Mepps spinners would be all you would need. Specialized heavy musky gear would not be fun at all. A fly in, boat and gas for a couple people for $400 bucks doesn't sound bad....try doing it on foot. I'm sure the people at Stanleys could answer these questions for you."
558479,Crappie Kid,2006-06-15 13:05:00,1581,"Now that makes sense, thanks for the info."
558518,Guest,2006-06-16 19:07:00,0,"I have not been on the fly in but have been going to Stanley's for over 30 years. It is a first class operation and if you need a fly rod,besides your normal fishing pole, I bet they can round one up for you. I have talked to many that have really enjoyed the Musky adventure"
