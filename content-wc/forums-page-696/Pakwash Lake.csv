Two things come to mind: The resort certinally knows what there services are worth in the market place. You usually get what you pay for. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
557553,Guest,2006-05-23 11:01:00,0,"Trailerguy is right about getting what you pay for when selecting a lodge. In regards to the lake....Pakwash and the two Bruce Lakes are my family's favorite Canadian lakes. This is mostly because of all the memories, but the fishing (walleye and northern) is very good."
557560,Guest,2006-05-23 12:28:00,0,"Pakwash is a nice lake to fish. What I like about it, it's private, less traffic on the water. Not many locals fish Pakwash. Fishing is also good. If your in Trout river the weed beds are fantastic for those monster pike. And also there's small mouth bass in pakwash for a little variety. Two years ago my wife caught a 25 pound northern... Also I saw one guy pick up a 9 pound walleye on an opening weekend close to Cianci's camp a few years ago. Also price is very good for what you get. Mista W"
557590,Pikeslayer,2006-05-23 19:49:00,3,"Knutsy: I have never fished Pakwash, however, the rates that you've observed for fishing on Pakwash are not out of line for the Ear Falls/Red Lake area. I've been fishing in Red Lake since the early 90's....my personal favorite has to be Gullrock Lake....the best walleye and northern fishing I've ever experienced. If they aren't bitin' on the ""Rock"" (which is unusual) we sometimes head up to Red Lake which is not too far.....and there's lots of alternative spots in between. Check out fivelakeslodge dot com....my personal favorite spot to flop. Good luck and good fishin' Slayer ""Everybody needs something to believe in - I believe I'll have another beer."""
