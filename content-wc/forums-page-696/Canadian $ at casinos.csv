I have been told that casinos give about the best rate going. I cross at Sault Ste Marie, Ont., and know that there is a casino there. Since I've never been in a casino, I need to ask a dumb question ... will there be any kind of complications or hassle to just exchange money ... like do they give you chips and tokens, which you then have to exchange for Canadian money? If it's going to be a big ordeal, I'll just take a worse rate elsewhere. But if it's fairly smooth, I'll give it a try. Any insight would be appreciated."

558494,Guest,2006-06-15 22:41:00,0,"I'm a shift manager in the cage at a casino and the casinos do not give the best rate of exchange. All the casinos in Ontario except Windsor and Niagara use a similar rate each day. There are no premiums for larger purchases.If you're converting a $1000US or more,try the duty free and ask for a better rate, quite often you can get one but not usually for transactions under $1000US. ( you could always pool your money with your buddies outside and have on person go in and make a group purchase. It's always wise to use your cell phone and call around as the rates can vary quite a bit even on the same day.On any given day you can also use the internet to get the exchange rates from all the Canadian banks and use that to decide what's a good rate.Canadian banks as a group are pretty fair with their exchange rates. P.S. If you want to still use Casino S.S.Marie get their phone number off their website and you can call anytime for their rates each day."

I've also found that they have trouble getting large bills .... lots of 5's and 10's that were a real pain. I had not considered the duty-free stores. That is a great suggestion."
558531,bigfish1965,2006-06-17 09:01:00,3210,I'm a pit manager at the Niagara casino. We use a rate based on bank (minus a point to prevent people from bringing in a few million cash to try and turn a profit). THe cage cashiers give the best rates while our exchange machines give a less favourable rate. Our rate is set at 8 am each day.
558551,Guest,2006-06-18 06:55:00,0,Bigfish is correct that the cage cashiers usually give the best rates in the casino but not the best rates in town. The private currency exchanges and the duty free shops undercut the casino rates in order to grab their share of the business. Casinos are more convenient but they don't pay the best rates. Sorry bigfish but TG Pit Managers are not currency experts.
