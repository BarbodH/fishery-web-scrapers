558500,Bill Krejca,2006-06-16 08:25:00,6107,"BW, This looks like a troll to me, but all kidding aside, my dad (yes an Iowan) loved to fish bullheads on Lake of the Woods. Besides catching them on an ocassional still fished minnow, he'd use cut beef chunks (to keep the perch from stealing the bait)for bait at night. Although he loved walleyes, he said if you slightly overcooked a bullhead from the area, it was quite good eating. I disagreed. A relative once caught a 4 lb bullhead in Turtle Lake, p/o LOW, it was a monster. Good luck."
558502,betterzebco,2006-06-16 08:30:00,7,Walleye guy- What are the laws/limits in Canada pertaining to bullheads?
558503,betterzebco,2006-06-16 08:35:00,7,"You have some awesome friends: Bullheads, Dale Jr., Whats next, Bush Light and hunting dogs??"
558580,BWLCwalleyeguy,2006-06-19 09:39:00,26,"TerryIA, shoot me an email about Sioux Lookout, were leaving in 11 days, I also live in Cedar Falls. [email protected]"
558476,BWLCwalleyeguy,2006-06-15 11:59:00,26,"Hey all, been to Sioux Lookout and fished Abrams and Minnitaki many times in the last few years. I am taking a friend and his dad to the area for their first time. They are pretty die hard bullhead fisherman and were wondering if there were any spots anyone had to catch them. I am trying to talk them into walleye fishing, but all they talk about is bullheads and how much better they are than walleyes. I am clueless, any suggestions?"
558478,Guest,2006-06-15 12:47:00,0,I would guess they should stay home in Iowa and save all that money. But i really guess that you are putting us on.
558480,Guest,2006-06-15 13:18:00,0,"Yup... you got that right. You are ""clueless"". Got me laughing 'tho."
558482,Guest,2006-06-15 13:29:00,0,"Windblown points, mid-lake humps and fast drop-offs, using Minnows or Leeches on a jig - catch TONS of bullhead on that! LOL"
558483,Reels,2006-06-15 13:37:00,2876,Just tell them that Canadian bullheads are green with teeth! <{{}}><
558484,Lovetofish,2006-06-15 14:29:00,458,And if cooked right they taste like chicken.
558486,Mohleye,2006-06-15 15:05:00,368,"Find some deep water, fish something dead on the bottom, and introduce them to the thrill of eelpout fishing. They'll think they're back home in Iowa. For a look at this fearsome fighter, check out eelpout.net"
558491,Guest,2006-06-15 19:07:00,0,When will u be up to minnitaki? a bunch from cedar falls will be up there next saturday afternoon. I too have fishied the area but can always learn a new spot. Do you know of any smallie hot spots. Terry
558496,betterzebco,2006-06-16 07:54:00,7,"So, walleye guy, are you calling yourself a ""Bull-Head Guide""? Do you charge a different rate for guiding Walleyes and Bull-Heads?"
558498,BWLCwalleyeguy,2006-06-16 08:12:00,26,"I was talking with my buddy again last night and told him the bullhead prospects arent looking too good up north. So he suggested we stay here for another day and catch bullheads and then take the fillets to Canada so we can eat fish for shore lunch. I told him about the eelpout fishing and he wondered if we would be fishing in 3 feet of water like he does for bullhead, because his Dale Jr. pole only has about 30 feet of line on it. He also wondered about setting out some milk jug lines at night for flatheads, but I told him they dont usually bite after June 1st."
