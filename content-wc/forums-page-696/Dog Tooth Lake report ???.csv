558088,FISHNBOWLJOE,2006-06-05 16:32:00,80,"kenjmn, I'll be going up with a couple of my buddies this weekend too. I haven't been able to find out much either. I have been talking to a guy who's up there this week. He's going to leave us some info on how they did this week. I'll try to help if I can. Send me an e-mail at [email protected] and I'll let you know how to look for me. Good Luck and Good Fishing! Joe PS. Hope to see you Saturday!"
558567,FISHNBOWLJOE,2006-06-18 21:09:00,80,"Just got back yesterday. What a great trip! I didn't catch a lot of fish, but had fun and learned a lot. It seems like the weather there was about 3 weeks ahead of schedule. The week started out in the mid to upper 60's with the wind coming out of the east. Wayne, the resort owner said that the wind had been out of the east for 3 or 4 days and the temps were like a cold front as compared to what they had the previous 2 or 3 weeks. The wind seemed to change daily (we had wind from all points on the compass during the week),and the temps weren't very stable either. We didn't get any rain while we were fishing. Just a couple of times when we had a couple of drops and then it would quit. I did however manage to catch my first big walleye, a 26 incher. I also got a fat 3 pound smallie and a 27 inch northern. Everything else was smaller but still fun. Oh,the mayflys were hatching while we were there too. All in all less than ideal conditions, but still a great trip. It helped that the 3 of us that went are pretty good friends and we help each other while at the same time made fun of ourselves. As I said all in all a great trip! Joe"

Deer fly were present when wind was down. We caught fish in many different locations - some bays, some reefs, some shorelines - with no specific pattern. Some fish were very fat; some very empty bellied. I caught a 27"" that was football like and another 27"" that wasn't much over 5# with belly completely empty. The small fish were easy to catch in timber so there are plenty to eat. Lake was down about 12-18"" I owuld guess so be very careful with rocks and reefs. If you want to share info on locations, e-mail me at [email protected]. There is a lot to learn about this lake. Dan"
