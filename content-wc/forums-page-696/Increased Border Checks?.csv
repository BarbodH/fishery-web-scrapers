558370,Guest,2006-06-12 19:24:00,0,"I agree. Now there are some protesting the ""treatment"" these 17 accused ""terrorists"" are receiving. I guess they are innocent till proven guilty but in the end they deserve a good ole fashion hanging."

558566,FISHNBOWLJOE,2006-06-18 20:32:00,80,"Just got back yesterday from the Kenora area. We were checked on the way in. It looked like it was random, although I don't think it helped when the guy driving said ""Good morning mam"" to the guy at the checkpoint. No probs on the way back. A few simple questions and the border guard said have a safe trip back, and we were on our way. Joe"

558217,Guest,2006-06-08 23:31:00,0,"Jigmann....I think you need to go back and read your responses. The poor guy asked a simple question and you jumped all over him. The idea of this forum is for us to share information. If you got nothing to share then move on. For all you know this could be the guys first time on the site. I just read a thread about Lund Vs Crestliner which is a much older song and dance than this one. No one got upset in fact there were several lengthy and postive responses. I'm sure it raised the blood pressure of some, but they must have just moved on. Brent"
558254,jigman 2003,2006-06-09 21:34:00,981,"I think you need to go back and read all of my responses too. I apologized to the guy and to the board several times. While I do not feel that my responses were out of line the rest of you apparently do. Again, I see no reason to ask a question regarding increased border checks unless you are concerned about them. That's just MHO. I guess I don't get one of those here any longer."
558311,Guest,2006-06-11 22:40:00,0,"Just got back yesterday. Everybody needed to show driver licenses both diretions. Same questions, both ways. We got to the border at 10:30 on Saturday for our return trip, past noon when we got through. I got real nervous waiting in line because my low fuel light came on. But as I expected, I had enough. But next year, I'm putting some gas in at Vermillion Bay before we head back. I saw one guy walking with a gas can, so I wasn't the only one. :^) Fritz"

558336,MoWalleyeguy,2006-06-12 08:53:00,409,Legit question .... Ive been checked before. Took 45 minutes. Ive been through 7 times and checked once. Good luck and have a great trip!

558361,Rlcrouse,2006-06-12 17:48:00,286,"Got back last Sat. and didn't get checked either way. While we were there we were told about the increased activity, but either we missed out or it was just a rumor."
558365,Guest,2006-06-12 18:26:00,0,I had to bring a relative to the US for medical treatment in the spring. I had to go through a full check by US customs right back to where I was born. It was very comprehensive and although I felt uncomfortable I was not afraid. I had a feeling some profiling was going on. I have dark skin and had been away for some sun in the winter. With whats happening these days the border guards have their hands full...... I pray our government does the right thing with our home grown group in Toronto this past week. I'd like to see treason charges and a length of good Manitoba hemp.......
558367,Guest,2006-06-12 18:35:00,0,Oh...I'd like to see the same hemp used for reporters who inflame the situation and make these guys out to be hard done by. We have troops in harms way in Afghanistan..........
558128,Guest,2006-06-06 20:36:00,0,"Last week crossing into Canada at International Falls, checked license and a couple of questions, crossing into USA,they were checking everyones trunk. That was different then the past few years, but there were no lines to get in."
558134,jigman 2003,2006-06-07 07:07:00,981,"Okay, I fail to see how my first response was impolite. I offered information regarding his question and how to deal with border checks. I'm thinking there's a little thin skin around here."
558138,Guest,2006-06-07 07:41:00,0,It was a simple enough question....he didn't deserve to take any flak over it. Kind of a rabid response.
558139,jigman 2003,2006-06-07 07:56:00,981,"""What's to worry about? If they check you, they check you. Don't break the law and you have nothing to worry about. Plan a little extra time into your trip in case you get stopped and searched."" ""Why ask if you're not concerned? Yes, border checks have increased. It's been that way since 9/11. Each year it seems to get a little more intense. No big deal, just part of the trip planning."" Those are rabid responses, eh Gord? Guess I'm a mad dog gone wild. Sorry if I offended anyone, especially the newbie. I guess I'm just a little too ""rough talking"". I'll try my best to play nice in the future."
558140,Guest,2006-06-07 08:40:00,0,"in answer to your question, yes. nothing really increased on the way into canada. drivers license and the standard questions. lots more scrutiny on the way back home. and longer lines. at least that's my experience the last couple of years."
558143,Guest,2006-06-07 09:25:00,0,">What's to worry about? If they check you, they check you. >Don't break the law and you have nothing to worry about.

Had a nice long visit with and agricultural inspector last weekend."
558154,Guest,2006-06-07 14:26:00,0,"<""Why ask if you're not concerned?> Yep... he must be guilty and trying to hide something. SHEEESH. Do you work for homeland security??"
558155,jigman 2003,2006-06-07 14:46:00,981,"Unless I'm mistaken the reason you ask questions about border checks is because you want to know if something you are taking is prohibited, you plan to take something that is prohibited, you want to know where you can get a list of things that are prohibited, you want to know if there will be backups, etc. All of things show CONCERN."
558158,Guest,2006-06-07 15:41:00,0,Or you want to get an idea of how long it will take you to get through customs.
558159,Guest,2006-06-07 16:06:00,0,And maybe Just curious?
558105,CH47,2006-06-06 08:54:00,29,"I've read some recent posts around the net about increased frequency of border checks (both directions). Has anyone noticed anything recently? Thanks in advance, CH47"

558110,CH47,2006-06-06 11:27:00,29,Don't think I said anywhere that I was worried did I? Just curious.

558113,CH47,2006-06-06 12:06:00,29,Wow. Why ask any questions on this or any other board?
558114,jigman 2003,2006-06-06 12:41:00,981,"You ask questions to get answers about things you are concerned about or that you need more information on. I gave you the information you sought. This topic has been dealt with here ad nauseum. If you do a search for border checks, hassles at the border, border crossings, etc. you will get all the information you want and more. Sorry if you take offense, just sick of hearing about this stuff."
558115,Guest,2006-06-06 12:59:00,0,Don't read his question if you're sick of them. I'm never worried about the 15 - 20 minutes it takes if I get checked. It's the 3 mile line waiting to see if I will be checked that gets on my nerves.
558116,jigman 2003,2006-06-06 13:08:00,981,"Okay, you're right. I'll ignore all future requests for information on this topic. The guy's post sat here for hours with nobody responding. Thought I'd respond. No more."
558126,Guest,2006-06-06 19:37:00,0,Good idea to pass. It was a good question and deserved a polite answer!
558127,Schief79,2006-06-06 20:30:00,11,"Two of us crossed near Thunder Bay today, and had a nice conversation about where we were going and that was about it. Never even had to show any type of ID. He knew as we drove up where we were from by the plates on the car. Easiest time I have ever had crossing the border. Usually cross at Internation Falls. Go Navy. Schief79"
