Mike of Four Seasons set us up with some Jumbo leeches that he had gotten in. First time he said he was able to get them. Normally his large leeches are plenty big but these leeches were fat. Thanks to Four Seasons for excellent bait once again. :) We C & R some nice 22-28 inch eyes. Had some nice shore lunches out of the 16-17 inch walleyes. Father in law with his heart condition did quite well and is looking forward to his fall trip. Had a nice calm day that I spent watching my son jig for lake trout. 40-60 feet of water. He caught two that were grilling size. Kept one and the gang enjoyed it. :)
