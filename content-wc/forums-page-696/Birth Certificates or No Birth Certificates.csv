558270,north_alabama,2006-06-10 12:02:00,172,"My understanding is that there are 2 requirements. You must establish who you are, and that you are a citizen or legal resident of the US (for most of us here). A passport establishes *both* requirements. But if you're driving make sure you have a DL as well. A valid gov't issued photo ID (normally a Driver's License) establishes who you are. A Birth Certificate or Immigration Documents/Visa (not sure what exactly is required for that) establishes US citizenship or legal US residency, respectively. A voter ID card or social security card might help in the absense of a birth certificate. Going into Canada, admittance is always at the discretion of the immigration officer. You could have all the above and be turned away, or none of the above (in theory) and be admitted. However, Canada suggests either Birth Certificate/Driver's License or Passport. It's probably best for an aspiring guest in their country to follow their suggestions if at all possible. That being said, I've never had to show my birth certificate at the border, but have never tried to cross without one (except with a RABC permit for which I had to supply a birth certificate to get the permit in the first place). This year for the first time in my life I will carry a passport. I'm much more worried about having difficulty on the way back than on the way up. I will be carrying my passport, Driver's License, Voter Reg card, social security card and a credit card. I will probably shave off my beard as well, and have tried to stay out of the sun as much as possible this summer. If they won't let me back home with all that, I guess I'll just have to stay up and fish!"
558298,Guest,2006-06-11 19:37:00,0,We just came back today from Ontario. Crossed both ways at 1000 Islands. I handed over my passport and license my partner just had his license in hand and was asked for his birth certificate or passport by agent. He had his certificate he just couldn't get it fast enough and thout the license was good enough. It wasn't. It only took about 5 minutes total to go through. They opened a lot of boat covers and trucks in front of us but not ours. Piece of cake.
558515,IaCraig,2006-06-16 16:32:00,434,"It depends where you cross. I've always crossed into Ontario at Fort Francis with no hassles with just a drivers License for me and Birth Certificates for the kids. But the 1 time I crossed at the great lakes the Canada border agent gave me a real hassle. She wanted more than just a DL for me, so I offered her my voter registration card. She told me Canada hasn't considered a voter registration card as a valid form of citizenship for years. I explained that I didn't bring my passport because it was expired, and she said Canada and Mexico both accept expired US passports. We had a stare down for a while, then she finally let me cross and made it clear that I better not try again without a passport. IaCraig"
558516,jcd,2006-06-16 17:22:00,185,"We just came back from Ontario through Fort Frances. Only needed driver licenses both ways. The line to come back into the USA at 9:00AM on June 10 was so long it took almost 1.5 hr to reach the border station, then only about 3-5 min to go through, including X-raying the boat."
558525,ankorklankor,2006-06-17 07:08:00,273,Just got back from Manitoba and we were asked for our birth certificates. I would contact your fishing buddies and make sure they have a certified copy of theirs. Was not asked for them on the return to US.
558527,fourize,2006-06-17 07:26:00,287,"In the 12 years that my Dad and I have been going to Canada, we've never needed to show our birth certifiacates...only drivers license. But like my Dad has always said, ""it's better to have it and not need it, then to need it and not have it"". Leaving in 22 1/2 hours...wahooooooooo!"
558528,Guest,2006-06-17 07:29:00,0,"We've been going to Canada for 20+ years now. In all the crossings we've made, we've only been asked for birth certificates once, and that was at Rainy, about 5 years ago. Chuck"
558227,Guest,2006-06-09 09:59:00,0,I know what the websites say (bring a birth certificate)... but I also see where travelers post that they have gotten through just fine with just a driver's license. Can anyone who has actually gone tell me if they've done so with just a d/l??
558228,Crappie Kid,2006-06-09 10:22:00,1581,Get an official birth certificate. You will need one to get a passport in another year anyway.

Can anyone >who has actually gone tell me if they've done so with just a >d/l?? i go 4 times a year and have never been asked for a birth certificate, just i.d. my 13 year old son goes on two trips each year with me and they sometimes want or ask for a letter of ok from his mother and his birth certificate. i always have the letter and his birth cert. just in case. scar"
558231,Frankm,2006-06-09 10:44:00,154,"Like the website says you DO need a birth cert. Do they check for it all the time? No, but they can. If they do it you should have it."
558233,phaffy12,2006-06-09 10:50:00,9,"I have never been checked for it and wondered if its even worth bringing it. Then my buddy spent 6 hours trying to get back through American customs because all the people in his group had was drivers licenses. The customs officer said that wasn't good enough. Better to be safe than sorry, follow the rules."
558235,Guest,2006-06-09 10:54:00,0,"Thanks for the replies -- I have one and I have them for my two boys I'm taking (along with a notarized letter from 'mom')... I am concerned about the others in my party though -- I doubt they have one. We've gone 6 years in a row, and I've never been asked for one. We're leaving on Sunday morning, so there really isn't time for them to get one at this point..."
558236,Guest,2006-06-09 11:08:00,0,"The time you don't bring it, is the time they will question you for it. Bring it, it's the rules. I don't know why there is so much 'well, that's a stupid rule so I'm going to try to cross the border anyway' talk."
558245,Guest,2006-06-09 15:01:00,0,"Passport, birth certificate and maybe a voter registration card is proof of citizenship. Perhaps your buddies have a voter registration card in lieu of a birth certificate. It would help to prove you are US citizen. A green card if they aren't US citizens. Myself, I have a notarized birth certificate."
558262,stumcfar,2006-06-10 09:14:00,451,"I just got off the phone with a Border agent from Baudette, where we cross. He told me a picture ID is sufficient. If you are travelling with minors, you should carry a birth certificate for them. He said drivers license OR passport or a picture identification is sufficient. That is directly from the mouth of a fellow who does the checking."
558267,Mohleye,2006-06-10 11:31:00,368,"When you enter Canada, a customs officer may ask to see your passport and a valid visa, if one is necessary. If you are a citizen of the United States, you do not need a passport to enter Canada. However, you should carry proof of your citizenship, such as a birth certificate, certificate of citizenship or naturalization, as well as a photo ID. If you are a permanent resident of the U.S, you should bring your Permanent Resident Card (i.e., green card) with you. This is from the Canadian Customs website. In 26 trips, I've never been asked for more than a driver's license, however, I guess I'll carry a birth certificate in the future. I have a hard time picturing Canadian Customs officials turning away carloads of Americans from their vacations, but what if something would happen the day of your trip to put all the border crossings on ""red-alert""?"
