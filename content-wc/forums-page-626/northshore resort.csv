570698,Guest,2008-01-13 18:30:00,0,"Talked to two gentlemen who have been going there for 12 years at the All Canada show yesterday. They had nothing but good things to say about the resort and fishing, hence the reason they have been going there for 12 years. The guys told me they have a nice resort, good food and service. They typically go for walleye, smallmouth and northerns. You should have a great trip. Good luck. Wingmann17"
