570701,LeakingBoat,2008-01-13 19:42:00,1,In the past I have been driving to Pickle Lake to fish. My fishing buddies want to find some place closer to save the long drive to Pickle Lake. I have been looking at Cozy Camp on the English River because I have a smaller boat and try to avoid big water. We like to tent camp and they have camping facilities. Anyone out there have any experience with staying at Cozy Camp and any recommendations?
