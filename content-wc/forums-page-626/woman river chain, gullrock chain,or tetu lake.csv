I have fished Gullrock several years in a row and have had great success each year there. It is good sized body of water with several great areas to fish. I think you could choose any of the Lodges on the lake and have a great experience. The only one I have stayed at is Five Lakes Lodge. It is very nice, clean, with good equipment and with great owners. Hope you find what you are looking for in a Canadian Fishing Vacation. Only 6 months to go before another great week on Gullrock.

The walleye fishing is outstanding, especially considering it is so accessible. You are only a few minutes drive from the town of Red Lake, so you can get extra groceries and supplies, or spend some time in town if the weather is bad. I've been to two camps and they were both very nice, and I'm sure have been improved since. They even had memberships at a local golf course so their guests could play, although I could never understand driving all the way to northwest Ontario to play golf. Finding a camp with an opening in early June may be another story. The Woman River chain is reached by an approx 40 mile drive on a gravel road from Ear Falls. Woman River Camp is a drive-to camp, or the Woman Lake Lodge landing is in the same area. Woman Lake Lodge is at the north end of the chain. The owner picks you and all your gear up at the landing, and it's another 30-40 minutes by water to his camp. Both camps have a number of portage lakes available, and both have websites. In my opinion, the walleye fishing is probably better on Gullrock, however there are also lake trout in the Woman system, and fishing for them is usually pretty good in early June. You'd also be in a more remote area and have more water to yourselves. Either could be a great trip, it just depends on what you're looking for. I have no knowledge of Tetu Lake."

570655,Guest,2008-01-11 04:30:00,0,"Fished Tetu 3-4 times, have not been there in a few years. Fishing was always excellant numbers wise, size was usaully decent. Alot of fastmoving water there, you never had to go far to find them."
