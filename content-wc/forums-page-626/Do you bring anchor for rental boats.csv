My uncle tells me that no anchors are common at Canadian resorts because you need to keep moving to catch the fish. I'm thinking of bringing basketball net, tie off the bottom of the net, fill with rocks and attach to 50 foot of rope that I will also bring. What do you all do-fish without anchor or bring your own?"
570688,Guest,2008-01-13 07:42:00,0,most places i've stayed provide them
570689,Jimmy Jig,2008-01-13 08:17:00,1905,In Canada with all the rocks it common to have the boat come back without the anchor! Then the argument as to who replaces it.
570690,Pooch,2008-01-13 09:09:00,4619,Most camps we fish have anchors that are too light if there is any wind or current at all. When we really want to be in one spot I've taken a rope and tied it around an odd shaped rock and used that. Pooch
570691,Guest,2008-01-13 09:36:00,0,My brother took 3 anchors from home a couple years ago. Was fishing Lac Seul. The wind was dragging the anchor rope and he lost all three anchors on the first day. He then found a big rock and tied it on and the rock lasted all week. I dont think a cloth mesh net will last long as it will be dragging on the bottom and will eventually wear through. Ive made some using a coffee can and pouring pre mixed cement in it. Put in a large eye hook or bend some heavy wire for the rope. A bag of pre mix cost only a couple bucks.
570693,A Canuck,2008-01-13 11:21:00,86,The reason most anchors slip is because chain is not used... add a few feet of HD chain just above the anchor... should solve all you slipping issues... Also matching your anchor to the structure helps. A cheap anchor? Some concrete mixed into a milk jug. A Canuck

My experience with not lending out anchors....1)people making them out of rocks...see points 2 & 3 above, multiply by a factor of 4.! My suggestion if you think you need one.....bring a real anchor and a container such as a plastic milk crate to keep it in while in the boat to avoid point #3. Swishing the mud off before putting it in the boat is always appreciated by the boats owner."

Consequently, I started taking my own Chene anchor (available through Overton's and elsewhere I'm sure). I use the Chene anchor designed for boats 16 to 25 feet in length. Although it weighs less than 5 pounds, it has held our boat in moderate winds on numerous occasions. We tend to use the resorts anchor only if a second anchor is required. FWIW"

He told me the shore is covered with them ;-) Didn't read the backposts so maybe this was already mentioned. One year we took basketball nets to use as anchors. Tie one end shut before you go, fill it up with rocks once you get there, tie the other end shut, you have an anchor."
