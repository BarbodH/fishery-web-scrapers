570603,Northpoint,2008-01-09 11:53:00,38,"I noted below all of the discussion about hooks and slot limits with the real issue being protecting the fishery for the future. Given that discussion I could not help but go the next step to ask myself what else could be done to preserve the fishing.....especially on lakes with several resorts and active guides. In researching one resort I noted that the guide does not fish according to their web site. If I were a guide I would argue that my customers are better served by me actively fishing to be able to best understand the structure, depth and how active the fish are. From a customers perspective I might say that the guide should focus on keeping me on the fish rather than landing his own. What do you think?"
570605,lacseulwalleyeguide,2008-01-09 12:15:00,32,"Being a guide myself, I feel that it is important to fish a little, in order to get a feel for the spot, correct presentation, and to keep all lines vertical while jigging and backtrolling. I spend more time catering to my clients, and making sure that they are producing than fishing myself...it's their trip after all. Even while fishing, I still net, bait, tie , measure, and release. You would need to be a one man army to fish all of the time!!!"
570606,AllenW,2008-01-09 12:32:00,11482,"Its my feeling if your a guide you better know where your at, also the minute your duties to your client were interrupted by your fishing, you no longer are a guide, your a fishing buddy and get paid accordingly. On the other hand.... What the duties of the guide should be worked out before you go, does he net fish, unhook, move the boat, etc. If all your guide does is put you on fish, then I suppose he can do what ever he wants. :) Personally as long as his fishing didn't get in the way, and he provided the service he/she says he will, I could probably care less.

570611,Guest,2008-01-09 13:33:00,0,"When Walleye fishing especially jigging the Guide should be fishing. When jigging it allows him to know his customers are on the bottom and in the zone because the Guide can feel what is right with his rod. He can also feel the ""Bite"" and as we all know there are times that Walleye are not real aggressive and he can help the customers catch fish with his knowledge and assistance. I don't Guide but I have had many Rookies in my boat who needed to be told what was happening down there so they could catch fish."
570612,jigman 2003,2008-01-09 14:15:00,981,"Culling is illegal in WI. I have only two experiences from which to draw on. One was a trip on Sturgeon Bay for smallies with a very well known and respected guide. Been on ESPN and everything. He fished alright. By the end of the trip I figured out that we had been pre-fishing for an upcoming tournament. He always had the bow, caught all the most aggressive fish. I swore I'd never hire a guide again. Two years later I did. I hired Hutch from Prairie du Chien (note I give the name of the good one). This guy busted his hump for us. He never wet a line, but still put us on fish. That was while we were handlining. Neither of us had a clue how to handline, but he gave us a 15 minute lesson and we were off. He didn't need to be fishing to show us how to do it. He worked all day for less than a the guy on Sturgeon Bay charged for 4 hours. There was a tournament going on that day on the Mississippi too. From what I could see, we would have won had we been in it. We caught far more fish than the tournament boys. Hutch is a fantastic guide. Nothing but great things to say about him. My first experience was my fault for laying the ground rules. I did research the guy, but not well enough. Get first hand recommendations from someone you trust. Personally, I don't think guides should fish. Maybe for a bit to get guys on fish, but once they catch on to the technique it's time to guide, not fish. Just my $.02"

570614,T Mac,2008-01-09 16:45:00,10084,"For walleyes... jigging or rigging...yes, the guide should fish. He needs to, to maintain good boat control. Plus....in many cases, he might never know if they are biting or not...unless he/she is also jigging or rigging :) Trolling...not so much a problem. Probably of no advantage for him to fish."
570634,Guest,2008-01-10 14:22:00,0,"I guess the answer depends on the type of guided trip and the clientele. * If it's from a resort on a Canadian Shield lake the guide generally should not fish but should focus first on tending to the client's needs. Here a few of the gazillion exceptions: > Fish to demonstrate the proper technique until the clients catches on. > If action is slow he can boat a few to promote confidence in the guests. > The wallies are suicidal and its time for everybody to get in on the fun. > Maybe to scam the limit/possession rule. * On a Lake Erie charter the guide (charter cap) was way too busy managing the boat, netting fish, thinking of our next spot, etc. to even think about wetting a line  it was the right thing to do in that situation. * On a trip to Kentucky Lake the guide fished with us until we had the new technique down. The he watched to make sure we were adjusting to the changes  good tip for him. * A different guide on the same lake was just a slob who went fishing and granted us the honor of fishing from the back of his boat  he didn't even want us to see his deptfinder for fear of remembering his secret depth  what a loser. In summary, my opinion is the guide can fish only after all of the needs of client are met first. We're not paying to watch the guide catch fish."
570635,Guest,2008-01-10 14:23:00,0,"Exactly Mohleye, and you could flush that argument out into a book. In fact, such books exist. I think as guide you're putting your guests at an advantage, not disadvantage. There's no better way to guage the day's activity, and no, you can't always rely on your guests production as an indicator of pattern or even whether there are fish present in many circumstances, despite what some think! And if you're on the pattern, no, the guide will very rarely fish, because his/her time is fully spent landing, netting, measuring, retying, baiting, pictures, etc., etc., etc. OH, and let's not forget that particularly for walleye guiding, boat control is another critical duty. As we know, keeping on those spots-on-spots or back-trolling along a sharp break requires near-constant tiller control or trolling motor adjustment. And there always has and there always will be people who want to do it themselves, for the challenge, or the novelty, or the boat space, or to save $, or whatever, WHICH IS FINE! There are plenty of places I have fished or would fish where I haven't used the services of a guide, and there are plenty of places I wouldn't go without the assistance of a guide. But for those who dismiss taking an experienced guide because you feel his/her modis operandi is solely get paid to fish and steal your fish, I would contend you have had relatively poor guide(s) in the past, and/or have never experienced what a good guide can bring to your experience (fishing or otherwise).

570636,Bill Krejca,2008-01-10 14:50:00,6107,"Althought I do not guide, I normally spend a lot of time running the motor, be it gas or electric. I find it very difficult to run at a consistent speed if trolling, or to hover, if that is what is required, without having a line in the water, which acts as an indicator of movement. The key to both seems to be a line watching exercise requiring constant attention and correcting for wind or current. In the above situations, I feel the guide should have a line in the water. The guide's ""other two eyes"" need to be focused on the depth finder, so he can annouce depth changes to his clients. In other situations, it may not be as critical to the success of the client. Somehow, the above logic needs to be explained to the client. Good luck,"
570637,Mohleye,2008-01-10 14:52:00,368,"Since this is the Canada forum I was relating my comments to my experiences, meaning northwest Ontario. I've been on salmon charters where the captain alone, with the help of autopilot, maintained 16 lines on downriggers, planerboards, etc, netted the fish, and did everything else that needed doing. There was no way he would have had time to fish, and the thought never even entered my mind. A guide for Canadian walleye needs to do whatever it takes to put his clients on fish and see that they're catching them. The guide doing some fishing would help in all the ways mentioned for novice fishermen. As a more experienced fisherman, if I hired a guide I still would rather have him fish, all things being equal. None of us are too old to learn a few new tricks, and where better to learn them than from someone who's out there every day, in all kinds of conditions?"

570653,Jigger1,2008-01-10 22:24:00,234,"Goldeneagle couldn't agree with your more. This will be my ninth year back to the same resort. The resort I frequent, SWWL, has a staff of well trained and educated guides. I would broadly categorize them all as being gung-ho. These guys all like to fish and they love to see their clients catch fish even more. These aren't your average guides. I own a boat, it's got the toys and would categorize myself as a capable fisherman that would probably do very well on Lac Seul by myself. However I chose not to. This trip is all about me. I don't want to worry about driving the boat. I don't want to watch the graph all the time (even though I do), I want to focus all of my energy on catching big walleyes. For five glorious days, my only worry is that my bait is in the strike zone at all times and that my knot is tight. Beside that I enjoy taking in the beauty of the surroundings and try to connect whenever a fish hits. The guide on the other hand has to concentrate on everything. Boat control, speed, depth, contours, graph, fish attitude, thinking of the next spot if this one doesn't produce, watching the guests to make sure they're catching fish, giving them pointers to help their hooking percentage, netting fish, keeping a log of fish caught, calling out depth, and a host of other things I'm not mentioning and oh yeah all the while trying to catch the occasional fish to gauge the spot or how the fish are hitting. When a guide happens to catch a nice fish, for those that are truly fisherman, it's a joy to see a big fish in the boat. Do I wish it was me who would have caught it, absolutely, but can you really think for a moment that if the guides lure wasn't in the water that it would guarantee or greatly increase your odds of catching that particular fish? I'm a significantly better angler today because of the guides I've fished with over the last eight years. I have a better understanding of a variety of factors that influence fishing conditions and have implemented these with great success on my own. At least for this person, I feel that I have gained an invaluable education to help me better enjoy my favorite pass time by using and listening to my guide. Jigger1"

570658,Roger Benoit,2008-01-11 09:05:00,93,"I'd like to add my two cents here. I guide on the Winnipeg River for a lodge. The only time I wet a line is to make sure shore lunch is in the livewell. There was a comment, about the guide not needing to fish because as a guide the guests should be catching fish where the guide takes them. ""Give your head a shake"". You actually mean to tell me that anytime you've gone out fishing that you've caught enough fish to feed everyone in the boat?? The guide has to eat too you know. Weather, novice anglers, etc etc all play into whether the guide fishes or not. When it comes to Pike/Bass where i believe boat control is more important than anything else, I never fish. Having 3-4 guys throwing around buzz baits or whatever gear is being used is just too dangerous. I'd rather concentrate on making sure they are using the right combination of lures and boat control to actually fishing. I cant count the number of times i've had lures being whipped around my head..I've been lucky so far and not had incidents. Guiding is not easy. Sure when the fishing is good, yeah.. take them to spot a, b, c, let them catch fish.. But when fishing gets tough, you earn your keep. All this being said, should the guest request that i do not fish. I have no problem with that either. You are absolutely right..

I've put up with guides showing up late, hung over, leaving the boats a mess, driving them to and from work, advancing money, and the list goes on and on but the good ones are priceless and what they do is allow guests to participate in the wonderful world that is Lake of the Woods and walleye fishing. I just flew to Minneapolis for the funeral of a fellow who fished with us for over 20 years and he could tell you all the good guide - bad guide stories you'd want to hear. At the memorial there were hundreds of photos and about one third of them were his hunting and fishing photos. He always took a guide.

I don't want him to do things for me that I can do myself. I'll be picking his brain and watching his fishing techniques when it doesn't take away from what I'm doing. Shore lunches are great and I've done plenty, but fish don't take a break while we're off the lake. I don't want my guide to prepare a shore lunch and take me away from valuable fishing time.

I've run cost comparisons and hiring a guide everyday out of a drive to resort and going for a week to fly in are usually within $100 or so. If you like hiring guides, then do it. Just make sure you and he agree on what a guide should do.

If thats the relationship you want, then will your employee pull the ""boss"" out of the drink if he falls in? Especially if the ""boss"" is a bit rude!! How do you treat your boss if he/see is a bit demanding? I see the guide as someone to enhance your day on the lake, keep you safer than you would have been on your own, show you some techniques and spots you never knew and If he did this well, then you may possibly give him a tip. If he did not do it well, open yourself a Canadian beer and fee free to tell the boys your story around the campfire that night. We're talking about fishing here aren't we?"

570683,Atlanta Dave,2008-01-12 11:04:00,323,NOW all you are doing is rationalizing why you should be fishing. I would not hire a guide that fishes. I some times let the guide fish for a bit but it should be the clients wish not the guides. You are paid to guide not to fish. Atlanta Dave
570686,Matches,2008-01-12 21:23:00,236,"To answer Northpoints original question which was: Is the customer better served if the guide fishes to better understand the structure, depth and how active the fish are. OR Should the guide just focus on keeping me on the fish? My opinion is the guide needs to do both. I can understand that just staying on the fish is difficult at times if the wind is 25mph and in that case he can't do both. But other than that, I want the guide fishing to understand all those other things that's going on down below. I understand that the guide needs to do all the shore lunch work, maybe crank your boat across a portage, and maybe clean all the fish at the end of the day. In the boat I don't want the guide to just sit and wait to take a fish off my hook and re-bait for me. If the guide didn't fish, what is he suppose to do all day? Sit and listen to music while I fish?"
570703,joeman79,2008-01-13 22:26:00,417,"I use to guide myself and all of my customers always wanted me to fish. Many times to watch and learn what techniques I used in rod handling etc. So they could become better anglers. Kinda like we all did when we were learning to fish. Watching our Dads and Granpas. But they always expected me to do all the other stuff, and some of them jumped in and helped anchor the boat, net the fish, put their own bait on, and even clean fish. But all in all I think that most guides know what to do and when to do it when taking someone fishing. Can't go to canada this year taking kids on an Alakan Cruise. OUCH!!!"

570666,AllenW,2008-01-11 12:56:00,11482,"Would you say the guides fishing should interfere with his guide duties?? Also I fail to see the difference between furnace and fishing, the cust customer is buying a service and expects the serviceman/guide to fulfill his end of the bargain. Methinks you need to reread this confusing and to long a topic. I should probably just let it be, as I thought most of us were in agreement it didn't make any difference as long as the terms of hiring the guide were met...prob should have..:) Al"
570643,Goldeneagle,2008-01-10 18:36:00,78,"I wouldn't want to be in a boat with someone who wanted the guide to tie lures, release fish or any of the little things that should be done by a competent fisherman. If my partner hinted that he didn't want the guide to do any fishing, I'd convince him of the many advantages of having the guide fish as long as he puts our needs first. I show the guide I'm capable of taking care of my needs and I want to land and release my own fish so I can show Mr. Guide that I won't harm the resource. Once a guide realizes he's not being a servant for a greenhorn he'll start coming out with all sorts of valuable fishing information. I carry a pen along with 3"" X 5"" cards to take notes during a day on the water with a guide. Later the notes are transferred to my fishing notebook. My guide not only puts me on fish that day, but provides information for fishing the same water during other seasons and weather conditions. Even on a poor fishing day I can glean fishing information from a guide and not feel cheated because we didn't boat a lot of fish. Fishing with a guide is a team effort and not a power struggle. Keeping a poor guide from fishing while you're on the water will not make him anything other than a poor guide. Tell a top notch guide that he can't fish while he has you out just may have him send you out alone. That's how I'd handle it."
570645,AllenW,2008-01-10 19:12:00,11482,"Key here is while he takes care of his clients, a guide who lets his clients wait while he fishes isn't much of a guide, I don't care who you are. It also wouldn't take to many times for that top notch guy to tell me wait a minute I have a fish on and he'd be sitting on shore, not at the prices they get. Al"
570620,Guest,2008-01-09 19:11:00,0,"I agree with all the reason why a guide should fish. I have been fishing with a guide for over 20 years on LOTW. I think the only time I would be upset with them fishing is if they only cared about themselves and didn't put the client's needs ahead of their fishing. Also, I enjoy watching everyone catching fish especially those who are not good fishermen. My brother ended up with a guide who kept pushing him and his friend to go muskie fishing when they didn't have the gear nor wanted to fish for them. This guide pretty much ruined their whole trip and of course they never went back to the resort. Overall the majority of guides that I have fished with have been very good at their jobs. They usually put the clients needs before theirs. Our group doesn't need much help except for a couple of people who we have fish in the guide's boat. Almost always, the guide gives them a great day of fishing. Another thing our group does is pitching in for shore lunch. Every one picks a job from gathering fire wood, starting the fire, cooking, cleaning, etc. Guides are very happy for the help and you get back to fishing that much faster. Wingmann"
570621,Guest,2008-01-09 20:37:00,0,"Not a guide for hire, but do take a lot of people fishing. On the topic, when I do I tend to take the approach I feel a guide should. Equipment ready to go and boat under control. Explaining the what, how and why's. Hopefully they catch on, if they don't that's ok too. However no matter what 98% of the time they are the ones doing the catching. That's the way I like it, there's satisfaction in that. On the other hand if I'm fishing solo or in a tourney scenario, to keep skills honed, I am focusing on my techniques and need to fish. That's the way it is. A guide should follow the same principles, practice catch and release in the process. On a limited fishery, in either case, catching and keeping the fish is like eating the seed corn. A quick story, I once asked one of these people to fish a local tournament (actually a friend of mine). They caught on quick on the first few fishing trips and had the drive to fish a tourney, so what the heck. During the tourney on the first pass it was fish on! I was on the reel bringing in the fish and said get the net! The look I got was priceless. None the less we still had fun and did respectable in the event."
570622,Jigger1,2008-01-09 22:48:00,234,"NWO Fishing Bum - If we ever fish together again and you get a 30 on, you better land that fish or I'll slap you upside the head. I'm more than capable of handling my fish while you get the trophy in the boat. I go on a guided trip because they incrementally increase my odds of a trophy. They know the lake, the current conditions, what working what not, all I have to worry about is catching. If in the process of trying to get a trophy for me, they get one, good for them. For as many hours as they put on the water and the kind of service they deliver, they deserve it. Nine days on LacSeul this year. Four with my youngest daughter and five with the boys. The countdown has started. Jigger1"

570627,AllenW,2008-01-10 12:03:00,11482,"Your being paid to guide, not fish, thus the term ""Guide"" You can make up all the variables you want, but you are there to put customers on fish. If they don't have a shore lunch caught, you ain't doing something right or they shouldn't be there. You have a trophy on? Stop and think for a minute, you've guided them to a spot, and you catch the big fish..uh huh I think the problem here is some guides think guiding is a way for them to fish and get paid for it too. Least that's the way it sounds from posts here. Maybe that's why we had a guide once, and will never again make that mistake. Least when he nodded off he wasn't fishing, just drunk. Like I said before, get all this worked out before the giude gets in the boat, it'll save a lot of trouble. Al"
570628,Guest,2008-01-10 12:17:00,0,"Guides should be treated like the second class citizens they are. No fishing and no eating at shore lunch. They are called guides....not eaters. NWO, have you ever heard of a sack lunch???? I remember this one time a guide with me actually went back for seconds on potatoes, and finished off the beans that I thought should go to the Gulls. Man I was so mad. The next spot he took us to fish, I purposely did not catcha fish....boy I showed him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
570629,Guest,2008-01-10 12:28:00,0,"So Allen, you're basing your opinion on your anecdotal, one-time experience where the guide was asleep and drunk...you consider that an informed opinion do you? Your post is riddled with both arrogance and ignorance, sir! NWO Fishing Bum"
570630,Mohleye,2008-01-10 12:55:00,368,"Trying to imagine myself in the position of being a guide, and assuming my clients were relatively inexperienced, I can't imagine a better way to determine whether the fish were present at the spot I chose, how aggressive they were, and what depth was best, than by getting in there and catching a few myself. It would be a whole lot easier to help if I knew what was going on. Or to figure out in a reasonable amount of time to try another spot or technique. If I found the pattern and my clients were catching fish like crazy, it might be better to stop fishing and let them enjoy the catching. If I were the client, and it was a tough day, I'd rather have a guide help with a few lunchers than eat a ham sandwich. And I'd assume the guy enjoyed fishing, and encourage him to do so, as long as he didn't just fish and forget that he was supposed to be helping me catch fish. Just my 2 cents worth...."
570631,waterwalker,2008-01-10 13:59:00,311,"Fish move, change feeding habits and react to changes. As a client and a fair fisherman I realize this and if it requires the guide to fish to put me on fish and paterns then I would expect him to do that. The hot spot yesterday may not produce today. If fishing is hot and everyone is catching fish and paterns don't change then the guide should probably stop fishing and cater to his clients needs. Either way the guide should see that his clients are as successful as possible and have a good time. Clients catching fish is the name of the game and if clients catch fish and are happy they will return. I am sure that most guides do everything they can to get their clients on fish or they wouldn't be in business long.:duh:"
570633,mrwalleye5,2008-01-10 14:21:00,1922,"I was at Aiken's Lake this past late summer and I encouraged the guides (each one was young and very proffesional) to fish although I believe it was the protocal of the camp not to. We were doing a lot of back trolling in deep water and I felt in order to make it easier for us he needed to be feeling the bottom and not just be looking at our rod tips. As for catching more or the ""big fish"" then myself or other guests, then we had better just step up our game a bit. He would be just showing us that they are there and there are big un's. W5"
570615,Guest,2008-01-09 17:01:00,0,"As a long-time guide, I definately believe guides should fish, for many of the same reasons already mentioned, and with many of the same considerations already mentioned. Sure a guide knows his spots, but I always want the first-hand, experienced feel for what's happening. It's common for guests for example to not be catching and/or not be confident the fish are indeed down there...but after I drop a line and bring a couple up, they get renewed confidence, as they ""just needed to be shown they were there"" (to quote a common statement I hear during those instances). Also, there are those really slow days (and this can be more common on poor fisheries) where it's getting on 9:30, 10, 10:30 and a full shorelunch isn't in the cooler yet...you can bet in those instances a guide should be fishing to ensure that even though the morning was slow, the lunch is going to be delicious! Furthermore, particularly on less-productive fisheries), I can guarantee that morale is negligable by mid-season for guides at resorts where they don't fish. Think about it as a customer...a fishing guide loves fishing, that's probably why he/she is a guide...don't you think he/she will be more motivated to 'put you on the fish' if that includes putting him/herself on the fish as well. (I'm not here to debate semantics, but moreso point out the reality.) Then there is the problem with fish limits and wanting to eat shorelunch each day AND take fish home at the end of the trip. If I have two guys in the boat, let's say we need four fish for lunch...those two guests on conservation license (2 fish each) already have their two take-home fish sitting in the freezer, but can eat lunch on my four fish (sport license). This is a very common approach to 'circumventing' the fish limit problem for vacationing anglers. If the guide doesn't fish, his licensed limit doesn't count, and either the guests don't take home fish, they don't eat shorelunch the last day, or they run the risk of a fine...it's that simple. And if you tried to claim the fish on the guide's license and the C.O. knows he/she wasn't fishing or knows the policy of the resort is that guides don't fish...then you're in BIGGER trouble! Another example would be young children in the boat, particularly those aged <10, have an extremely short attention span and usually bad patience, which is not good for fishing particularly if it's slow. In such instances (lets say it's dad and son), I will fish, hook-up and pass off every fish to the child to bring in. Some children don't like it as they feel cheapened by it, but others, who coincidentally are usually the ones with the shorter attention span/less fishing experience, love the added excitement. Furthermore, dad is doing what he loves up in the bow while the guide is keeping the (sometimes sulking) child busy further back in the boat. There are many reasons for a guide to fish, not necessarily all the time, but in a variety of situations and for knowledge gathering, I think it's very important. NOW, that said, there are numerous relevant considerations. I don't fish unless all my guests are happy and fishing (or doing what they want). A guide shouldn't be fishing if a guest is waiting for bait, needs a new rig tied up, needs a fish netted, needs assistance (verbal or physical) fighting and landing a fish, etc., etc. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT! I've had trophy 30""+ walleyes on my line, when my guest in the bow hooks into a nice 21"" fish...in those instances (and I've had multiple occasions with 30""+ trophies) I've a) given my rod to another guest in the boat if they've since stopped fishing to take in the ongoings (and I always do this option if the other angler is a child...what excitement) or b) opened my bale, sat my rod down, dealt with all other duties, then picked up the rod, closed the bale, and found out whether the fish was still there or not. Some guests in these instances will think I'm crazy, but I'm ultimately there for them (and it's really just another good fish for me). NWO Fishing Bum"
570619,Obabikon,2008-01-09 17:42:00,2370,"Bum... that's the exact attitude a guide needs to have when he's fishing. I'm probably one of the worst guides, because when I get to go out, it's a treat. I hate putting down my rod to help a guest. :) But, I do it anyways. The real issue is this... it's 100% up to the guest. Infact, the guide should ask if it's ok with the guest that he fishes. I know that's not the practice, and very very few people would actually say no (even if they thought it was inappropriate), but it shows a courteous attitude. It also lets the guest know immediately that the guide is there for him."
