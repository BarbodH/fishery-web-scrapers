I love the Fall fishing, it's the best. They will be moving toward spawning areas, the river system will be hot. If you don't know where the river is, ask around where your staying, If that doesn't work pm me."

570618,Guest,2008-01-09 17:40:00,0,Would Bonny Bay Camp be in the middle of the action? Is this a nice place to stay?
570624,HighTech,2008-01-10 07:01:00,75,"I am not a camp owner or affiliated with any camps on the chin. However I do know most camps and their owners. Bonnie Bay is centrally located on the chain (slightly west) and it's a beautiful camp. It's always full when I visit so that must count for something. Contact Nancy or Len, they are the friendliest people you will meet. If your fortunate enough to get a spot this summer, watch for the ice delivery man,, then buy him a beer!!!"
570048,Guest,2007-12-08 13:34:00,0,What time of year do you find best to fish this lake system? I went in mid june last year and had horrible fishing. The lake had just gone up several inches and the mayflies were thick. I'm sure both were contributers.
569957,HighTech,2007-12-08 13:44:00,75,"Spring and Fall are always the best. This year the water started out verrrry low and early rain brough it up very fast to normal levels. The may fly showed up early but I noticed that they were not showing throught the Dinorwic Wabigoon system. I fished Dinorwic in June and the East end of Wabigoon with a lot of success. Where did you stay? Did you move into Dinorwic, Olsen, Larson, Paulson? The lake froze at normal levels and we currently have more than a foot of snow on the ground. I expect normal higher spring lake levels with good movement in the river system for spring."

569958,Guest,2007-12-08 14:18:00,0,We(my girlfriend and I)are from Wisconsin and stayed at Pilots Landing in Dryden around the 20th of june. We had our best luck around Devils Island and Copeland but it was still poor. We also tried Mile and Trap Lake with decent smallie action but we were mainly walleye fishing. Should we have headed more east and/or Dinorwic? thanks in anvance for the advice!

569959,HighTech,2007-12-08 15:26:00,75,"It's amazing how far the fish move in this system. I picked up a tagged walleye two years ago, the (MNR)told me it was tagged in Contact bay near Dryden, I caught it in Dinorwic Lake on the extreme south end some 30 miles from where it was tagged. Devils and Copeland cay pay off in the spring, same for mile and Trap. The big point is that they move a lot depending on weather and who knows what! If your fishing Wabigoon/Dinorwic and your in the right spot on that day you will have a walleye in less than 5 minutes. Then work it a bit and you'll have a dozen. They may start small but they get bigger quickly. Next day, same spot, nothin!!! You have to plan to work the system. Weeds, shore, reefs.. See what's working that day, remember no Walleye in 5 minutes and I'd suggest you move, this system tells you very quickly where the fish are. If you came up here and missed fishing Dinorwic, Olsen, Larson, Paulson, Rock, the River, or Turttle Pond then you missed 80% of the fishing."

569962,Guest,2007-12-08 22:10:00,0,Sounds like I missed alot of the good fishing by staying on the Goon chain and not hitting Dinorwic and the lakes attached to. When is the best time of year there? I was looking into early september and thought it might be best for numbers AND size.

569871,Guest,2007-11-26 20:07:00,0,"anyone fish these two lakes? I trying to decide which to concentrate on for a 5 night 4 day fishing trip. I see PWT pounded walleye on wabigoon, but I have little info on dinorwic, wondering if similar structure exists between the 2 lakes."

569880,Guest,2007-11-28 10:29:00,0,"Wabigoon can be very good as has good potential if you give it a chance. Wabigoon is like it owns...Water clarity near zero due to its clay based bottom (6-10 inches vertical vis). Has many reefs to be careful for boat traveling. If the wind picks up, gets very ""angry"" and rough."

569883,HighTech,2007-11-28 14:06:00,75,I live in the village of Wabigoon on Wabigoon Lake. Both Wabigoon and Dinorwic can be very productive depending on the bite. Dinorwic is clearer and deeper but Wabigoon can produce some large walleye in shallow muddy waters. I suspect the PWT winners bagged the bigger fish in Dinorwic. Even south of Dinorwic connected by a small river is Rock Lake which is also very productive with clear water and productive reefs. Camps on Wabigoon are available as well as on Dinorwic. If your in the area you will be fishing both lakes as you will want to follow the bite. It's just a bit more gas and money but thats why you came fishing! I'm out there every day spending my fair share.

569923,Guest,2007-12-03 11:02:00,0,"Fished both for about 20yrs. Our group has nine walleyes mounted. All over 30in. We found the best areas to be contact bay,olson,paulson and larson. Another nice little lake is mud lake.small river leads into it and as you enter there is an island and on the right is a deep hole that has produced many fine fish. Trap lake will produce some nice northern. As we stayed on Wabigon must of out fishing was done in these areas. Wabigon has a lot of islands that produce well. Hope this helps you.:cheers:"
