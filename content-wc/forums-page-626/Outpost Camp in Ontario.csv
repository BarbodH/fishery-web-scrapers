570820,Guest,2008-01-16 18:57:00,0,"Looking for any references you might provide. Looking for walleye (more volume than size), pike (potential to catch upper 30's or 4) and maybe lake trout. Able to spend ~$1,500/week. Went to All Canada in St. Charles last week and spent time discussing Dowswell Lake (Outpost Company) and Clear Lake (Nestor Falls Fly In Outposts). Both seem to be good outfitters with solid books of business. Any other references appreciated too. Thanks-"
570824,Guest,2008-01-16 19:58:00,0,I have used both Rusty Myers and L & M Fly Ins in the past. Both be worth checking with for an outpost trip.
