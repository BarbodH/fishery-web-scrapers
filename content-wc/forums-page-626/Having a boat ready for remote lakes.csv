570802,Guest,2008-01-16 11:25:00,0,"Rose, This is a fairly common practice, particularly for lodges based on relatively smaller fisheries...to add some diversity and/or access other fisheries which contain different species. The other, similar common practice is to have boats cached on the other side of short portages from the main fishery to other lakes, so a group goes out to fish and maybe spends the afternoon on a quiet portage lake, or something like that. If you have the extra boats and motors, and these other lakes offer something the main fishery doesn't (which in some cases may be only solitude), I would say do it. NOTE: If you are having guests hook up to your trailers and driving your equipment down the road, make sure you have your insurance set-up properly to reflect such!!! NWO Fishing Bum"
570805,Guest,2008-01-16 11:35:00,0,"I realize that many camps have boats for that very reason and the camp owner or employee take you there. I wasnt sure how many let you hook up to your own vehicle? Yes, I must double check with our insurance company to make sure we're covered. Thank you, Rose"
570817,Trailerguy,2008-01-16 17:48:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b] Rose, Several lodges in your immediate area let guests use a trailer to carry camp boats to remotes lakes for day trips. The MNR severly penalizes outfitters who leave boats overnite on lakes they have no boat cache on and/or have more than the apropriate number of boats. In the past at least one camp lost their permit for a boat cache due to this that I know of. The MNR now issues boat caches based on 100% daily usage for the boat on a given body of water, which is why few new permits get approved. Most of the lakes with caches from multiple outfitters were established years ago, and handed down from owner to owner. If you had a cache on a lake that you don't intend to use, I'd recommend you continue to keep the permit current, as the likely hood of getting it reapproved is small. However anyone can take a boat to any lake, anytime and use it, as long as they take it with them at the end of the day. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

We hav'nt fished the lake by the resort for years.All of our fishing is done on remote lakes with boat caches.We just have to drive about 30 minutes down the logging roads to get to them.Thats part of the adventure.The only bad thing is if something goes wrong (motor,weather,injuries,gas etc.)your on your own until the lodge comes looking for you.Make sure you have plan in place for just such an emergency.Last year the road washed out,if the lodge did'nt warn us and gave us an alternate route back we would have been screwed.That was the storm in Ignace.Try it on a limited basis,with you or your staff as ""paying customers"" and have something go wrong like a motor that won't start or hitting a rock and losing the prop.How would you solve those problems? Good Luck Terry"

I would guess that a decent percentage of the people that would need to use this service are not real versed when it comes to operating a trailer and loading and unloading a boat. I realize that it doesn't seem like it's that hard, but growing up next to a public access on a busy tourist lake in MN, I can assure you it is unbelievable how many things can happen and how much damage happens at the access with unexperienced operators."
