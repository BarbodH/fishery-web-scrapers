My Ontario Map shows good detail south of Minaki, but poor detail north of Minaki. I believe Navionics is changing some of thier maps around, so you may want to email them to get the latest info. The last time I looked the website, it wasn't clear to me what the best map for the Minaki area north and south of Minaki. Chuck"
