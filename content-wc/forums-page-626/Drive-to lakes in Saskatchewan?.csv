570736,Springseeker,2008-01-14 17:55:00,96,"Can anyone recommend some good lakes accessible by motorhome? We want to fish pike,walleye,and maybe Lake trout and stay in campgrounds-preferrably not too crowded. I think also the central to north central zones. Thanks."
570739,T Mac,2008-01-14 19:27:00,10084,www.sasktourism.com There are lots of good places you can drive to...and not all of them are far north. Most aren't what I'd call crowded. Lots of choices. Enjoy! I have always enjoyed my trips to Sask...and I always drove to my destinations and brought my own boat.
570753,skindzier,2008-01-15 11:33:00,137,"We used to go to Davin Lake which is about 160 miles north of La Ronge on Hwy 102/905 (most of that is gravel!). There used to be a provincial (I think) campground right next to Davin Lake lodge, which was abandonned several years back. Folks used to continue using it & the Lodge would grudgingly offer some services to folks there. However, I haven't been up there in 4 or 5 years (I caught the musky bug) and ownership of the lodge has changed. The lodge doesn't show that it offers camping on their site, but they have a lot of room, so it might be possible. Could be worth an email. The lake has good but not spectacular fishing for walleye, pike & lake trout. Usually pretty good action, but not usually real big. Here's the lodge site: http://www.davinlake.com/"
570757,uzzi,2008-01-15 12:39:00,349,"Thats a good site Tmac gave you, lots of information Another one is this one:http://www.cyr.gov.sk.ca/Parks It lists the Provincial Parks in Saskatchewan, most are near lakes for fishing. This site is for Sask Regional Parkshttp://www.saskregionalparks.ca/ Again, most of these parks are beside fishing lakes too, and offer some nice camping. Of course, some of the larger, popular, more common drive-to lakes in Saskatchewan include Diefenbaker, Tobin, Codette, Jan, Otter, LaRonge, Deschambeault, Last Mountain...... A nice trip would be to fish Last Mountain or Diefenbaker, then head up to Tobin for a while, then continue up the Hanson Lake road (HWY 106). It starts at Smeaton, SK and winds its way thru the northern shield up to Flin Flon, MB. There are so many fishing lakes, camping, etc on this route, its very scenic, and usually pretty quiet compared to some of the other ""hot spots"". There are lakes with all kinds of trout, walleye, pike, perch along this route too. But it is kinda remote, there are services along the way, but in between not a lot. Guess it depends what kind of trip you're looking for and how much time you've got. If I can help with anything else let me know"
570760,Springseeker,2008-01-15 13:27:00,96,"Thanks for the info guys. It's hard to pick from all those choices! We're basically looking for a fairly remote lake to spend 5 days at which can be reached by motorhome,rather than travel a lot. Maybe first trip out we'll have to do a bit of driving to see what's out there."
570777,uzzi,2008-01-15 20:15:00,349,"Well, if you like driving, then Sask is the right province to come to!! Lots of driving here if you want...haha..... Where are you coming from? West, East or South? Maybe that will determine where you go, as it takes several hours to drive across the province. The time of year might also dictate where you fish and what you want to go after."
570786,Waxy,2008-01-16 09:35:00,2938,"You've got two choices really for ""remote"", you can take the Hanson Lake Road as mentioned towards Deschambault (fantastic fishing, but it's BIG) and Jan Lakes, or you can go north of La Ronge on the #2/#102 that goes through Missinippe. I've been a fair ways up both roads and the there are some truly fantastic spots and fishing. How much you want to ""rough it"" will really determine how far up each road you want to go and where you stop. If you're looking for facilities - fuel, groceries, firewood, boat launch, etc..., you'll have to stay at a provincial campground or fairly close to one of the little (and I mean little) towns. Any way you slice it, I know you won't be disappointed, it's paradise up there. Waxy"
570787,Waxy,2008-01-16 09:37:00,2938,"Also, as mentioned, don't write off some of the southern lakes. Diefenbaker and Last Mountain both have prime trophy walleye fishing, and in the spring, pretty good all around fishing, and both are really nice spots with great camping facilities. Last Mountain is pretty quiet except for July and August, it gets pretty hairy on those nice summer weekends. Waxy"
570812,Springseeker,2008-01-16 15:06:00,96,"That sounds about what we're lokking for. I'm from Calgary and am thinking about trying Saskatchewan this year instead of Vancouver Island. We don't mind driving a long way,just want to make sure the motorhome can handle the roads. There are a lot of Rider fans here-maybe they'll have some input. Thanks guys!"
570821,uzzi,2008-01-16 19:09:00,349,"If you want to stay on the west side of Saskatchewan, there's some nice places up around Canoe Lake, Keely, Dore, take a peek at a map in that country. There is also Meadow Lake Prov park in the west that has lots of lakes for fishing too, though I can't comment on the fishing or camping out that way, never camped or fished there. And yes, way to go Riders! I'd imagine 1/2 of Alberta has Sak ties.."
