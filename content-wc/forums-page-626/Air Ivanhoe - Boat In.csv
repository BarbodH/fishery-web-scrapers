We've gone with Air Ivanhoe before to Lake Bonnar. Outfitter was great, facilities were great, but the fishing wasn't so great."
570723,Guest,2008-01-14 14:37:00,0,"did a couple of these fly ins years ago when we flew into some lakes they no longer use.I have talked to numerous customers who while helping out at the docks one Summer said that the fishing was pretty good but that was 12 years ago and who knows how things are.I do remember a guy saying that it was a long boat ride all the way down the lake, especially when it was rough.The equipment I remember were all in first rate condition and George and his wife ran an excellent business back then and am sure they still do. Good luck."

570752,Guest,2008-01-15 11:21:00,0,"Sorry, but what is the ""PP""? We're planning on staying in the Brook cabin for a boat in trip in August. Do you ever fish the river? Thanks for your feedback."
