570579,Obabikon,2008-01-08 11:35:00,2370,"Hump, If you don't mind me asking, what kind of deductable did the policy have?"
570581,IaCraig,2008-01-08 12:40:00,434,"I wonder if you need to worry about ""loss of use"", or if there is even such a thing on boat rentals. To explain - If you rent a car, your personal auto insurance covers the damage to it if you are in an accident. However, except for a few US states your personal auto policy only covers the cost to repair the rental car and not the ""loss of use"" of the rental. Let's say the car you rent goes for $50 a day, and you are in an accident and the body shop takes 60 days to fix it. The car rental place can sock you with a bill for $3000 because that is the missed earning opportunity the business experienced due to 60 days ""loss of use"". There are some instances where this has run into the tens of thousands of dollars."
570582,Guest,2008-01-08 13:00:00,0,"I think $30 a week and $200 deductible would be great. My Boaters Insurance (Progressive) has been wonderful.They have covered Canadian accidents in my boat without any questions and did so quickly and courteously,They have however told me in no uncertain terms ( I asked ) that my policy does not cover rental equipment in Canada nor do they offer any such policy. My Homeowners insurance (different company) also said the same thing. I inquired about adding an umbrella to my policy and was told that it was not possible.My suggestion would be to get the coverage in writing from your agent good luck"
570583,Guest,2008-01-08 13:10:00,0,"Exactly.....I inquired about an umbrella policy also, but my agent said there was nothing available. It seems to me that we definately have a need here, now if only an insurance co would pick up on the hint. A policy for covering you for a specific time period up to a specific $$$ amount, just for camp rentals. I would be willing at $30/wk and a $250 deductable."

Also, the Yamaha dealer I use (Tompkins Hardware in Emo) is GREAT!!! Fast repair and very helpful! So, I may lose the usage for a week, but those longer losses I should avoid. (unless the engine is totaled)"
570585,Guest,2008-01-08 14:59:00,0,"As an Independent Insurance agent, I would highly recommend you get in writing from your agent, that either your boat policy or homeowners covers a rental boat for physical damage. Most homeowner policies will cover a non-owned boat (under 50 or 100 hp) for liabilty (damage or injury you cause, other than the boat)but not cover physical damage and I have yet to see a boat policy that will cover a rental for physical damage. If in fact you have a Homeowners or boat policy that covers physical damage for a rental boat, I would appreciate the name of that company. On a side not, many resorts are dropping the physical damage coverage on there rentals, because the insurance companies are packaging all the coverages (including camp boats) for the resort under one blanket policy, and as you all know (or should) claims frequency is NOT a good thing..rentals=claims, claims=higher premiums"

570466,Guest,2008-01-06 16:59:00,0,"I, my brother and nephew are planing a fishing trip to Ontario. The resort that we are interested in says that we are responsible for boat and motor damage. I have no problem with that but wonder if there is a way we could buy a policy for the week that we stay at the resort, what it might cost, and what kind of coverage could we get."

570467,Oldschool,2008-01-06 18:23:00,163,"Gary, Good question as I have wondered the same thing for a couple of years. I stayed with Rainbow Point Lodge some years ago and they offered an insurance package on their equipment for the week. It was like $20 or so; inexpensive for the peace of mind. I don't know if it was a rider on his lodges's policy or what, and frankly, I didn't pay much attention to it then. I did a flyout for a week last summer and there is no way that I could avoid all of the rocks in that lake. I take it easy, especially the first time through, but there is no way that i could predict the positioning of some of those rocks. The lodge owner must have known as he had some great keel guards on the motors; they allowed us to fish the whole week without breakdown. I imagine that a call to Bob or Gail would lead to an answer. They are good people and have a nice lodge. I am sure that others here will have an answer without bothering those folks, however."

570550,Pooch,2008-01-06 19:24:00,4619,"According to my agent, my personal boat policy also covers any boat I rent up to the value of my personal boat. I'm insured with Country Mutual on the boat and almost all of our farm related policies. I'd pin down the agent before assuming the same. Pooch"
570570,Guest,2008-01-07 15:57:00,0,Just talked to my insurance man and he says I am covered under my home/owners policy. Just have to tell him when I'm going and the approx. value of the boat and I'm covered. This will really give me some peace of mind and fewer worries about ruining a trip by dropping a lower unit. Great discussion questions and thanks!!!!
570573,Guest,2008-01-07 17:37:00,0,"I wonder if anyone from Anglers Advantage might jump in here and let us know if we are covered under our policies, since there are many policy holders that visit this site? Jump in someone?"
570574,Guest,2008-01-07 18:17:00,0,"Really......what Insurance company do you have? I want to make a change and this would be a good reason to do so? I am concerned about this due to the fact I had a accident a couple years ago, my insuance co. took care of it, but that particular co. is no longer in WI. The HO policy I have now will cover me up to the value of the boat I have but it is a duck boat worth about $1000. The camp boat beats that by 15X's."
570576,Obabikon,2008-01-07 21:04:00,2370,"I can't say what actual insurance companies offer, but we're going to start a ""camp"" insurance policy. Which, I'm sure several camps do on their own. I planned on $30 per week, with a $200 deductable. Does that sound fair, or should I change it?"
570578,Hump,2008-01-08 06:47:00,578,"Our camp offered insurance in previous years. I think it was about $30.00 Well worth the price. Last year when we arrived at camp, we found out that they discontinued because of low water and several lower units that spring. It would have been nice to be notified so I could have checked with my insurance company."
