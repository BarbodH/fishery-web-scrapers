570715,Guest,2008-01-14 13:12:00,0,I pay a lot of attention to the wind pattern for the week before I go to Canada every year. My theory is that if the wind has been consitently out of one direction for a while that the Walleye will have reacted to that and have a better chance of being located with this pattern. As a example last year the wind had predominatly been out of the west for about 6 days before we arrived. I started on the west side of several areas that had good structure and lo and behold the Walleye were there. This theory is supported by fact that placten blows in and baitfish follow their food source (plancten) and of course Walleye follow the baitfish. It works year after year for me...GOOD LUCK Use a Wheather Service on your computer to check the wind before you go.

570744,Guest,2008-01-15 07:43:00,0,">what if the wind changes overnight in a couple of hours, and >blows hard. what would you do then I believe this is one reason why fishing often deteriorates when a cold front comes thru. A cold front often means a change in wind direction, this changes the wave patterns, and the baitfish and walleyes that were stacked up on a given location now move or disperse to look for a new restaurant. I don't have good tactics for this situation. Maybe look for structure like a hump in the middle of a lake that would remain swept by the wind even if the wind direction changes? Maybe the baitfish would only move to a different location on the hump?"
570746,Goldeneagle,2008-01-15 08:44:00,78,"Fishing with a constant wind can be great. When wind changes enough to eliminate successful fishing patterns I head for moving water. It'll find me fishing rivers, river mouths and any outlet on the lake. Don't overlook narrows where there's going to be a little current. Moving water isn't affected by changing winds. My all time greatest three days of walleye fishing came with an extremely strong North wind beating huge waves against me as I fished the outlet of a 14 mile long lake."
570764,Mohleye,2008-01-15 14:15:00,368,"My answer to the wind change question was going to be: Don't wait to keep your shore lunch fish. A big change in wind direction overnight usually means a front came through, and a change in the barometer, which can mean a pretty tough day of fishing. We've had afternoons where several days of steady wind really had the fish stacked up, and we just hated to call it a day, but were licking our chops to hit the same spot in the morning, only to have the wind die or change direction overnight, and the spot would be dead as can be. Early season I would look for moving water, summertime I'd stick to the same mid-lake structure that produces on days when the wind isn't a factor, keep moving and trying different presentations. Slow presentations like a crawler on a lindy rig might be a good bet. If the wind continued to blow in the same (new) direction throughout the day, I'd start looking for the fish to concentrate again in the same kinds of spots described in the other posts by mid-afternoon."

In my 50 years fishing Canada and the many years guiding on Lac Seul, this has been a tried and true tactic that has put many walleye in my boat including my personal best at 11.25#.Working that rough edge on the lee side by backtrolling into the wind has really worked. I have never used a drift sock as they seamed a bit of a chore and the kicker/plus electric is a good tactic also but again seems a bit of a chore; and most don't have their boats rigged for either of them. Most of the time we would go out in good weather and get caught by the wind and using the transition line as I call it is a way to save a day and wait out the wind till it drops for a drier ride home. Just the views of an arthertic old guide."

570444,orchard frank,2008-01-05 13:58:00,1900,"We had several great days on Lac Seul anchoring on a reef during big blows, and fishing directly over the side or doing a little casting. We always took our own boat, so had good anchor and plenty of line. We would go for a while with no bites, then pull them in as fast as we could when a school went through. The transition lines mentioned earlier have worked for us also. Good thing about anchoring is that it is easy, no fighting with boat control, you can move the boat around by adjusting the line out, or switching where it is tied off."

570680,Goldeneagle,2008-01-12 08:22:00,78,You guys aren't walleye fishermen. You're walleye catchers. Nice posts.
570682,AllenW,2008-01-12 10:12:00,11482,"Not sure about 6 foot waves, but in 3 foot or so, I'll try and position the boat to drift with the wind, then use the bow mount trolling motor to keep us at a 90 degree to the wind, bow mount will slow us down and keep both front and back of the boat able to fish easily with out crossing lines. I tend to use what ever weight jig I need to keep control of jig depth and add a minnow, but I suppose you could cast or troll this way. Al"
570684,Guest,2008-01-12 11:22:00,0,"I like the idea of ""creeping"" around a wind break and just poking out into the wind-blown section, if it is too windy to handle the full force of the waves or control the boat properly. If you know specific spots where the fish are, like humps, shallow reefs, or up along a rocky shore being blasted by waves, you could try to anchor upwind of the spot, let out enough line for the wind to back the boat close, then toss small jigs downwind on top of the spot. Let the jigs sink, then bounce them with the rod tip and reel up line very slowly, letting the jigs sink back down often. We do a lot better if the jig is being worked with some vertical component to its motion, rather than just being reeled horizontally back towards the boat. Use the smallest jig that will still keep the line snug. With a snug line and small jig, you can still feel a light bite, even if the line is out at an angle, then drop the rod tip and reel up slack so as to get a booming hookset. We find an interesting effect when fishing this way. Just after we anchor, we catch fish early in the retrieve, when the line is out at an angle. After a certain time, we then start catching them right under the boat as well, sometimes more so than when the line is outside the boat. I suppose the inital presence of the boat and the act of anchoring spook the fish, then they come back underneath the boat. Tossing a slip bobber and jig, or plain hook with bait, and letting it drift onto the spot might work too. Wind and wave action bounce the bait under the bobber, much as if you were jigging it vertically. We use these methods to fish from shore in strong winds with good success here in Iowa, where it is always windy. If you are searching for fish on a new lake, though, it could mean a lot of time wasted anchoring outside poor locations."

570337,kalde,2007-12-30 21:50:00,6,I was wondering what everyone's best choice is in heavu winds. I was in a tounament this year and our second day was heavy winds and we could not hook up on the right size of fish. We tried our usual live bait rigging but it just was not effective.
570342,T Mac,2007-12-31 15:05:00,10084,"When it gets REALLY heavy...cranks, trolled down wind."
570380,jerry bark,2008-01-03 08:11:00,822,"the best i ever did in strong wind was jig and minnow on the edge of an island where the wind was blowing a big current around the island and the eyes were stacked in a hole right under the current. they would hit the minnow before it hit bottom. ran through 4 dozen minnows and put on a curlytail, had to jig that twice to get a bite! usually in strong wind i go back in and try again later so can't offer much beyond that one day. cheers jerry"
570382,Jesse-WI,2008-01-03 10:47:00,534,"Back in my co-angler PWT days, I got to experience 6+ waves on Lake Eric and 3+ waves on Lake of the Woods. On Erie, we pulled cranks down wind using kicker motor as needed for speed and direction. On Lake of the Woods, we fished up wind using bottom bouncers, spinners and crawlers. We had the kicker motor and front trolling motor in the water. The kicker was locked straight forward and I adjusted the speed per Pro's instructions. Usually the kicker was set to let the boat just barely slip backwards. Pro would use the electric trolling motor to control direction and how fast we moved forward. I personally like drift socks but they are a bit of a pain on short drifts."
570398,freespoolin,2008-01-03 18:27:00,472,"For windy conditions, fish the windy side of the structure especially if the wind has been blowing in the same direction for a couple days. Use heavy bottom bouncers with live bait, put your rain gear on and backtroll. Or if it's so windy that the lake is too rough to fish, go on the lee side of an island and fish the break between the calmer water and the rough water. Walleyes are often stacked on that ""edge""."

570429,Guest,2008-01-04 15:58:00,0,I look for a reef and put out a drift sock with a bottom bouncer rig with a crawler on a spinner. Is effective but a lot of work pulling in the sock drift after drift but usually catch big fish on the windy days.
