It is a different world we live in, more and more violent crimes and many are finally getting tired of it, and laws are changing to help the victim. Al"
570675,Goldeneagle,2008-01-11 20:11:00,78,"Al, the problem with a shotgun is the barrel goes through a door before you can see into a room. If armed with a shotgun it's probably best to lock the bedroom door, get behind your bed with a cellphone in your hand. Only problem comes if you have a family member in another part of the house and you must go to them. It's better to clear a room with a handgun. With my revolvers I fire semi-wadcutters on the range and load with hollow points for carry. Hollow points won't go through a bad guy and into your neighbor's bedroom. They hit and spread. Gun free zones are dangerous. Bad guys don't follow rules. I'd like to have you as a neighbor even though you might not let me fish if I were your guide. I'm not a guide. Not good enough on the water to be one."

"""""""""""""" Point taken, but in Minn you search out a burglar and shoot him your in trouble, last time I went though shall carry they made a point to say you need to be in fear of your or your families life and make a attempt to escape harms way, meaning yes you'd be sitting in the bedroom screaming you have a gun and not to come in.. Shotgun would be my choice in that situation. The family member in another part of the house does change that though, I'm betting you'd be in your legal right to go find and protect them. Op topic title was protecting your property, here anyway (Minn) you can't use force to do that, protecting you or your family you can. I disagree considering the violent crimes done by people just trying to rob you, no longer do they just try and escape, now every time someone breaks into your house you stand the chance of being assaulted or killed.

The last 2 I just can't figure..A home invasion where the owner killed one of the invaders and wounded the other..I figure he should have got a medal plus costs for his ammo ..yet he is being investigated for excessive use of force..the other a senior for holding a guy for a breakin with his shotgun untill the law arrived..I am a proud Canadian but I'm getting a little flustered. What Gives......

570433,bigfish1965,2008-01-04 19:33:00,3210,Anytime someone points a gun at another there is investigation. If the two he shot were on their knees or on their way out the door it would be excessive force. But if they were in the process of attacking him it would not be. Even cops can't shoot someone without some type of warning unless they are fired upon. (POLICE...DROP THE GUN!!) There are all kinds of cases where someone shot an intruder and no charges were ever laid. But it does have to be investigated.

570451,Guest,2008-01-05 23:41:00,0,"We had a case a few years ago in Perrault Falls, where the owner of a local store caught 2 guys robbing the store at night. He shot one of the guys in the leg and the other got out of the store but was eventually caught. The police charged the owner of the store with careless use of a gun and use of a deadly weapon (or somethin like that) . there was such a public outcry that the charges were dropped by the crown. An old buddy of mine from chicago once told me ""dead men can't sue"" I guess the guy should have aimed higher."

570456,Goldeneagle,2008-01-06 07:54:00,78,Several states go by the Castle Doctrine and allow homeowners to use deadly force when their homes are being entered illegally. Shooting a bad guy in your yard while he's stealing your car is another story and not usually okay. I wouldn't live in a state that does not follow the Castle Doctrine and try not to spend a night in one. Gun free zones are not safe because bad guys don't follow the laws. In some states bad guys seem to have more rights than law abiding citizens.

570671,rpieske,2008-01-11 19:13:00,1276,">44 Magnum, best house protection available. You'd get some debate on that statement. I personally believe that a shotgun loaded with #4 or #6 shot is the best home defense weapon out there. Of course, there is always this alternative, too:http://www.taurususa.com/video/tauru...udge-video.cfm"
