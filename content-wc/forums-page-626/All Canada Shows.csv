Yesterday afternoon there were 100 cars in pile ups due to the fog outside of Madison. Two died and 50 were injured. Thanks Jared, you and your wife rock!!"
570650,Obabikon,2008-01-10 20:23:00,2370,"All Canada show at Pheseant Run (St. Charles) was a great first day! There's a bunch of great lodges, and great opportunities. If you have the chance, even if you know where you're going, come out and say hello!"
570652,Guest,2008-01-10 21:45:00,0,anyone else at pheasant run?? give me your screen and booth name and ill see you friday.cant wait for the walleye dinner.bender ouuut!!
570696,Guest,2008-01-13 15:40:00,0,I like the all Canada shows that I went to. But $9.00 a person is a little pricey after driving 125 miles with 3 family members the dollars add up. I know if they charge to walk in the door it keeps alot of rubberneckers from going to the show looking for freebies and hand outs. Maybe be they should let you use your ticket stub to get the fish dinner at half price or some dollars at the store.
570704,jigman 2003,2008-01-14 06:31:00,981,"I got a coupon this year in the mailer for what appears to be free admission. I assume the mailer comes based on filling out the card from the previous year. I agree $9 is a little pricey, usually you can get a coupon online for at least $2 off. Makes it a little better."
570717,Obabikon,2008-01-14 14:07:00,2370,"The Chicago All Canada show was great... for those Indy and Wisconsin people out there... definately make it to see everyone! We (however) will be at the Chicago Rosemont show, and if you're in the Chicago area, come down and say hello!"
570324,Fishoil,2007-12-28 09:02:00,1277,"About 20 years ago when I was looking for a camp for my first Canada trip I attended the Green Bay show. I found several options and ended up with a great camp with a great owner. After several great years at that camp we decided to change camps. The next one we found by word of mouth from previous guests and have been going there since '98. In all this time I've been to a couple of the GB shows, mainly just looking. But this year I will go again because I want to explore options for a caribou hunt and perhaps a black bear hunt also. As others have said the internet is probably your best marketing tool. You already have a good website and your presence here is obviously getting the word out that your camp is available. You respond to questions promptly and I assume e-mail inquiries as well. I looked at the vendor rates for the All Canada show and they represent a sizable investment. But if it puts guests in your cabins it should be worth it. Once your return customer base builds I'm sure you'll re-evaluate how you spend your promotional dollars. Good luck with the shows, I'll try to stop by your booth in Green Bay to say hi."
570325,Rose_Cliff Lake,2007-12-28 10:02:00,116,"Max1 Sorry to say the Indiana show is the only one we are not doing. We had a scheduling conflict. We may do it next year. We have been going to Canada for many years and about 6 years ago looked at a camp. In the end the $880,000 was out of our reach and the camp too large for the 2 of us. After many DEDICATED years at my job, I needed a change. The day I went to give my 2 week noticed [found another job] I was treated like *&%*^&% and walked to the door. [yes, I was bitter, but it planted a seed] Two weeks later was our annual trip to Canada. I was at a little general store in Perrault Falls and the owner remembered that at one time we were looking at camps and told me about another one for sale. She phoned ahead and on the way back to camp, I went to look at it. I stood there and it hit me, I was home! I went back to camp and said to my husband "" guest what, we just bought a resort""! He said, ""oh no, here we go again"". True story."
570327,Rose_Cliff Lake,2007-12-28 10:53:00,116,"When you buy a resort/camp, of course the price is based on size, condition, customer base, etc. Because the previous owner of our camp is quite sick, they did not promote the business for a few years and yes, the customer base declined a lot. Proof that you must promote in some manner and the shows are just one outlet. Walk in to any of the shows and you will find camp owners who have 5, 10, 20, 30 years under their belts, but they still do the shows. Why, because they are protecting their investment and not sitting back on their laurels. Others may not do shows because they spend their advertising $$ elsewhere, but trust me, they are spending money somewhere to promote their business. My guess when you said ""better camps"" you probably meant ""more established"" camps. With doing shows and with other means of advertising, we will become, ""more established"" too, but you will still find us doing shows because I want to be in front of people. I want to look them in the eye. I want to get to know them. I want to build relationships. As for the internet, just this week I spoke to a dozen or so past guests, and each one was retired and not internet savy. So having a website is great and most of us have one, but it will NEVER replace the personal interaction of looking someone in the eye and smiling. Steve, come to the Madison show and kick a few tires, I just want to meet you, shake your hand and smile. Then you can tell me if my website is any good. LOL"
570331,Guest,2007-12-28 16:17:00,0,Rose and O See you at the Madison Show....gotta go kick those tires.
570332,Rose_Cliff Lake,2007-12-28 19:58:00,116,"Steve, I DO look forward to meeting you! Rose"
570333,Guest,2007-12-28 20:28:00,0,Definately come by! Sometimes it's just time to get a new car... or at least four new tires!
570344,Guest,2008-01-01 10:03:00,0,"I typically go to the Chicagoland boat and fishing show in Rosemont. I understand many people go to the All Canada shows to avoid resorts outside of Canada and all the other junk that is being sold at this show. I like to go to it to spend the day checking out new possibilites for short trips like a 3 or 4 day weekend in the states, find new information and talk to people where I go around Hayward. This is also fun taking my daughter to the show so she can fish for the trout. Last year she got lucky and caught two fish. Also the resort owners tend to spoil her so she enjoys the attention. We also enjoy the variety of the different types of Jerky offered. And of course we get to see the resort we go to in Canada. The All Canada shows are nice but are a little too small for me. Wingmann"
570462,Obabikon,2008-01-06 15:36:00,2370,"Hope everyone in the Chicago area swings by! The Minneapolis show was good... great way to get pumped for your fishing trip. Also, wanted to let everyone know that Rose is exactly the same person as she is on here... excited, outgoing, and extremely kind!"

570291,Guest,2007-12-25 14:15:00,0,"Hi. I used to go to pheasant run also. when the kids were young we all would go and just collect brochures from all the resorts. we would have 2 or 3 bags full. over the next week or so we would all go through them and separate them into piles of nos, maybes, and pretty good. by the end the family and kids would have down to a couple of places. In the end everyone had a good time and helped decide where we were going. after a couple years of non attending we would go a start the process again. it seemed at pheasant run they always had a good turnout back then. it beat staying home in the winter for the day anyway."
570293,Guest,2007-12-26 04:08:00,0,"Rose, Good luck and congratulations on your purchase of a lodge. Best of luck to you."
570294,bellbuoy,2007-12-26 05:51:00,490,"Max1 is correct about the All Canada Show here in Indianapolis. It would help if they could be consistent with its location, one year at the fairgrounds, next year at the convention center downtwon, last year I think it was on the east side at a hotel. If you come to the Renfro show, request a booth in the Colisuem, 2nd choice would be what was called the Marsh Pavilion. I'd try to stay away from the building east of the Coliseum, that's where alot of the non-travel or junk vendors are located. Usually if a lodge is stuck in there we don't see them back for subsequent shows. Bellbuoy"
570296,thunderatwork,2007-12-26 08:00:00,79,sounds like this year we(my fishing partner and I( are going to the one in ST. Charles. for the first time
570300,Rose_Cliff Lake,2007-12-26 12:18:00,116,"Max1 Thanks for the congrats!! We are so excited and I can't wait to get started. We have many changes in store for the camp and A LOT of work ahead of us. It all starts [first show] in a few days in Minneapolis. If any of you attend any of the shows, would you stop by and say Hello? Rose"
570308,Guest,2007-12-27 03:44:00,0,"Rose, ABSOLUTELY!! Are you going to any of the shows in Indiana? My father/I go usually the 1st week in June and are primarily smallmouth fishermen but we fish for about everything including crappie/perch. We always catch enough walleyes to bring home our limit but that's about it for them. Got a couple of grandkids that we will be planning a trip with in the next few years, may have to make more than 1 trip,rats. Is the lodge something you have always wanted to do?"
570313,Guest,2007-12-27 10:50:00,0,"Just a thought here!!! What if the places you are considering are full for your time period, or maybe they are not even at the show! For new owners like Rose, or those that need to go to these shows to get thier camp filled up for the season, these shows serve a purpose. But the camp I go to and many others that I would certainly recommend, do not attend the shows. WHY.....because they don't need too. The don't need to because they have a good customer base and repeat business already, it costs a SMALL FORTUNE, and they don't want to take the time away to market to a small fraction who do attend a show. Most of the people who attend the All Canada Shows never book a trip, just check the numbers. They are mostly ""tire kickers"", or guys like me who go to see what might be new, or see who is at the show offering my ""dream trip"". I already have my trip for 2008 booked. And the better camps don't take the time or spend the money to attend the shows. If you wait for the show to book your trip chances are your first choice is either full, or there is a reason it isn't. It seems to me that in this age of computers, an above average website, that gives facts, information, prices, cabin info, good pictures of the camp, etc. would be a much better marketing investment, rather than spending $1000's on brochures that just end up in the trash can. Just my opinion, just like noses, everybody has one."

570319,Guest,2007-12-27 17:14:00,0,">WHY.....because they don't need too. The don't need to >because they have a good customer base and repeat business >already, it costs a SMALL FORTUNE, and they don't want to take >the time away to market to a small fraction who do attend a show. It is quite expensive to attend these shows, however in the case of most camps, if you book 2 or 3 people per show, it pays for the trip. >Most of the people who attend the All Canada Shows >never book a trip, just check the numbers. They are mostly >""tire kickers"", or guys like me who go to see what might be >new, or see who is at the show offering my ""dream trip"". It's true, but if you can get a ""tire kicker"" to consider your camp, there's a great opportunity to gain the business. >I already have my trip for 2008 booked. And the better camps >don't take the time or spend the money to attend the shows. Careful there... by ""better camps"" you should say ""lots of camps"". There are still a ton of good owners and good resorts at these shows! Some resorts have 50 beds, others have 25 beds... it's much more difficult to fill the 50 bed resort, even if you have a GREAT client base. >If you wait for the show to book your trip chances are your >first choice is either full, or there is a reason it isn't. That's true, especially if you want walleye opener, or first week in June. But, the ""reason"" it isn't could be as simple as it being a 50 bed resort, new owners, new management, or new marketing... it DOES NOT necissarily mean a bad place. >It seems to me that in this age of computers, an above average >website, that gives facts, information, prices, cabin info, >good pictures of the camp, etc. would be a much better >marketing investment, rather than spending $1000's on >brochures that just end up in the trash can. I agree that websites are very key! Also, quick replies, exact information, and general hospitality on the computer are key too. I'd say 75% of inquiries are via email, and that'd be a very conservative number. The web is the best way to communicate your business. All that said, I'm not going to say that sport shows are even a fraction of what they used to be. However, they still offer an important usage. Many customers like to come down and say hello at the shows. They've already booked with you, but it helps them get excited for their trip. They also get some ""one on one"" time to discuss things, and ask questions about the up coming year. Some people (believe it or not) still love face to face conversations. :) LOL Rose, You know I'll be seeing you at the shows! First one's in a week! We'll see you in Minnesota."
570322,Guest,2007-12-28 06:08:00,0,"Obabikon/Rose, For me I normally do not go to the shows anymore and do not have a good reason for not going. I has nothing to do with the fact that the resort we go to does not attend the shows. One of the reasons we have (and will again)went in the past is to simply have something to do in the winter. It actually costs me more to drive down/park and buy a ticket to get in then I ever spend. I do agree that a lot of people just want some face time with ""their"" resort of choice. For me and I believe most get their information from the internet. I will say too that one of the things that has me going to resort websites is for current lake conditions & fishing reports which could lead to future clients."
570270,Rose_Cliff Lake,2007-12-23 08:03:00,116,"I'm just curious if a lot of you go to the shows? If so, which ones?"
570271,Lazy Fisherman,2007-12-23 08:18:00,276,Have not been to a show in 15 years. I guess maybe it is time to go again to see if there has been any changes.
570272,Rose_Cliff Lake,2007-12-23 08:39:00,116,Where do you live?
570273,Guest,2007-12-23 09:40:00,0,"Used to go to Des Moines, but didn't feel they were very good, especially if I have found where I am going."
570275,Guest,2007-12-23 10:57:00,0,"I used to go to the one in chicago at pheasant run with some friends and always the one here in green bay, but in recent years (last 6) nothing has changed, so we quit going. The resorters seem to be depleating also. The resort we go to in the summer used to go, but doesn't anymore. He said the all canada shows were losing attendance and he just talked to the same people every year, no new people seem to be going through the door. I guess they must have a problem with their advertising if they aren't getting new people? He used to do all the AC shows (10 I think?) now he doesn't do any, He said there are better shows out there and they must be working for him, because he hasn't been back."
570276,Oldschool,2007-12-23 13:02:00,163,"I like them. They quit holding the show in Des Moines for a few years, but they came back last year. I picked my lodge from that show for summer, 2007. I am going to attend the show in Feb. this year. These shows are smaller than most other outdoor shows. It is easier to get through it in a decent amount of time, and the focus is appropriate for me; Canada. I get a kick out of talking to the lodge owners, even if they do try to sell, sell, sell. Many of them are not really as good as selling as they are at running lodges, so it gets entertaining. Not negative here as I learn a lot. Our group gets a bit tired of going to the same place constantly and seeing new territory and fishing new water is a large part of our fun: heck, when fishing is slow, the scenery is always right on."
570280,Catman59,2007-12-23 16:31:00,345,"The Des Moines one is small , but we go early so my son can get the Daredevil spoon that they give away . He started collecting them a few years back. The show itself is way short of the Minneapolis show , but still gets the blood warmed up !"
570281,Muskygary,2007-12-23 17:21:00,137,I go to the chicago show at pheasant run. Will first attend the Musky Show at Harper College in the am then have lunch and drive over to the all canadian show. I will make my reservations for this year at the show.I have the week of July 12 to 19 for vacation and have picked three resorts that look good. Will talk to the people at the show then have a beer and decide which one we like (if they have a opening for that week) and will make the reservation and pay my deposit at the show. This way I don't have to worry about sending a check through the mail! Makes for a great day in the winter. This year it's on january 12.
570283,Guest,2007-12-24 02:48:00,0,"Rose, Have been to 2 All Canada shows in Indiana and both were very small and not worth attending. The show to attend(in Indiana)is the Boat Sport & Travel show in FebRan by Renfro Productions I believe). Much better attendance and much more variety. Max"
570288,Rose_Cliff Lake,2007-12-24 19:04:00,116,"Max1 Thanks for the recommendation. We're doing all the All Canada shows except Indiana. That may be a good outlet for that state in the future, I'll check it out. Rose"
