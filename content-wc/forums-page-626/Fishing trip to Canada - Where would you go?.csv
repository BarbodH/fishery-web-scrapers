One suggestion however.....the Dad should have some experience fishing. Just because it's a fly in doesn't mean the fish jump in the boat. A good friend of mine, who had no real fishing experience, took his son a number of years ago and they about starved. They could hardly buy a fish and because your often alone on the lake there is no one to give you the tips you need. He describes it as a trip to H___. If Dad doesn't fish, take a guided trip."
570593,Obabikon,2008-01-08 20:06:00,2370,"Honestly, if it's Walleyes he's looking for Lac Suel would probably be the best recommendation. But, he'd better get moving, because he'll need to land a good guide. If he wants a little of everything... LOTW (out of Morson) is a quiet, secluded area..."
570597,MN_Moose,2008-01-09 08:00:00,965,I recommend Smith's Camp Lake Of The Woods near Kenora. Go out one day on a guided trip with Al and they will all have a great time and find some fish. Al will do a great job of explaining what where when and how. The best part is the shore lunch. It's a treat in itself.
570632,Guest,2008-01-10 14:01:00,0,"Without question, I qwould go to Lake St. Joseph and the Old Post. I do not work there or have any vested interest. You can fly there or drive through beautiful country. I have fished Lac Seul, the walleye numbers do not compare. Also there are great pike available. The best accomadations come along. They'll will be no dissapointment."
570638,Guest,2008-01-10 15:55:00,0,The tag system which limits the amount of fishermen can fish St Joe is a great thing and it shows. I personally like Root Bay area if I was going to fish St. Joe.
570644,Goldeneagle,2008-01-10 18:46:00,78,"I suggest having Mr. Boss and son hook up with another father and sun duo who have experienced success on a fishing trip to Ontario. We've been introducing fathers, mothers, sons and daughters to fishing in NW Ontario since 1959 and the whole deal is growing and growing and growing. If I ever get old maybe the younger guys will see that I make a few trips every year. This May we'll have four 19-20 year olds, two 8 year olds and a 12 year old. In July we'll have a grandfather, daughter, son-in-law and a cabin full of 8 to 16 year olds. Fishing with someone who has experienced success on the lake will make their first trip a great one."
570646,Guest,2008-01-10 19:49:00,0,You don't want to go to Canada. These are not the walleyes you're looking for... :secret:
570552,Skis,2008-01-06 19:56:00,1523,"My boss wants to take his son fishing in Canada in late June-early July this year for a graduation gift. He's never been to Canada. He asked for my input, but I've never been to Canada either (that will change). My first thoughts are Lac Seul and Nungesser. I'm looking for any additional input trying to help find the ""trip of a lifetime"". Thanks!!"
570553,Guest,2008-01-06 20:34:00,0,"Thats a great gift idea. There are many good lakes and places to go. You will find many good places using this forum but a question that must be answered first otherwise it can be overwhelming. Drive In, Boat In, Fly In? Meals included or Housekeeping? What type of trip is desired. Any budget to keep with in? Assuming a place to drive in or boat in with the mentioned lakes but there are even fly in options, too."
570556,Guest,2008-01-06 21:56:00,0,You gotta ask what type of fish are they targeting. Some lakes only support a few types of fish and others in the same area may have access to the other species.
570557,Guest,2008-01-07 01:42:00,0,"Also try to go to a All Canada show or a similar show depending where you live and talk to the resort owners,and get as much information as you can.Alot of resorts have web sites that you can browse at your own pace. Terry"
570558,bellbuoy,2008-01-07 04:34:00,490,"If he's never been to Canada, he needs to go somewhere where he can get a guide or it is included in the package. I would reccomend Witch Bay on Lake of the Woods where it is included.http://www.witchbay.com Bellbuoy"
570560,jigman 2003,2008-01-07 10:12:00,981,"This is my ""trip of a lifetime"" - http://www.ganglers.com/ He'll need to narrow his focus as previously stated. What does he want to fish for? Does he want to be alone or with other fishermen? How much does he want to spend? If he wants to go in June, he should get going. I would think even the best drive ins are getting pretty much booked for that month."
570562,Skis,2008-01-07 11:10:00,1523,"Forgot to add species: Walleye primarily, but chasing northern pike for an afternoon would be possible as well."
570563,jigman 2003,2008-01-07 11:29:00,981,"I've made this recommendation before, but I can honestly say they are great people. My first four years with Mattice Lake Outfitters was for a father/son trip. It was tough to find an outfitter that would take a party of two, MLO did so happily. Dad and I fished Vick once and Pringle three times. I'll go back to Pringle someday, maybe Vick too. I did Ogoki two times after Pringle, I'll go back there too. I'd recommend Pringle for a father/son trip. Great fishing, don't need a guide to find fish, nice cabin, great outfitters, pretty much middle of the road when it comes to price. Don't know how much this guy wants to spend, but I think a trip to Pringle or any of MLO's lakes would be a great trip for them. Check out their website, give the Elliot's a call, and you won't regret it. www.matticelake.com I'd be happy to mark up a lake map for them if they go to any of the lakes I've visited."
570564,lacseulwalleyeguide,2008-01-07 11:36:00,32,"Of course I would reccomend myself....www.canadafish.com Walleye, Northern, Muskie, Smallies, Lakers, and more...Lac Seul and surrounding lakes...absolutely solid fishing and everything else. I see a lot of the same faces every season, that should tell something. June is a very busy time though....research and book fast, there are alot of good options out there that are busy in June as well. Good luck to you, and let Canada show you it's finest fishing whatever you decide."
570568,T Mac,2008-01-07 15:31:00,10084,"I think if it was me...I'd do a Fly-in trip. The young man will love it! Dad will, too."
