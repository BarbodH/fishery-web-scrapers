570656,Guest,2008-01-11 07:18:00,0,"Hello again and I sincerely appreciate all of the responses everyone gave me regarding a canadian fly in. Recently I conducted a meeting to get all of the guys thoughts on the trip and everyone seemed a little discouraged because of all of the ""hoops"" you have to jump through to get there, crossing the border, licenses and especially the cost etc but the most discouraging thing is regarding the fact that a good friend of mine that wants to go had a DUI about a 4 years ago. To me that could make a planned trip a disaster if access is denied into Canada. However, what I would like to know is if anyone can recommend a place to go in Minnesota, (Mille Lacs Lake, Lake of the Woods or even Rainy Lake) where the fishing is just as good or even better? What are your thoughts on a house boat rental? The fly in we were going to do was in the fall on account that some of the guys have their own businesses that are seasonal and during the early summer months, its hard for them to break away. I am now thinking it might be better to stay in the states but I am not sure what the best time of the year would be. We want to still catch Walleyes, Northerns and whatever is available. We all live in the suburbs of Cleveland so I am not sure how long of a drive it would be. (16 hours?) Thank you very much!"
570659,jigman 2003,2008-01-11 09:21:00,981,"A place in MN where the fishing is just as good or even better than a Canadian fly-in? Yeah, I'd like that info too ;-) Hoops? It is easy to get into Canada, if you want to. Do the paperwork for getting in with a DUI. Most guys get right in, some don't. Sounds to me like a cop out, but hey, that's just me. If you guys are in Ohio, have you considered doing a 5 day charter on Erie? Great walleye and smallie fishing to be had I understand. Close to home, low cost, no passports, no DUI issues. Conversely, no peace and quiet, no lake to yourself, no Aurora Borealis, no unspoiled wilderness,......whoops, got sidetracked there. Bottom line: adjust your expectations. Good fishing can be had in MN, but it won't be fly-in good. If it were me, my ""good friend"" would be staying home while I did a fly in. Either that or he can use the info. provided here and elsewhere how to address his felony conviction. Passport is about $100, good for 10 years. $10 a year doesn't seem bad to me. Cross somewhere besides Fort Francis and the crossing is easy. Usually takes all of 5-10 minutes at Pigeon River. Cost? You went from being able to spend $2000 to cost being a factor? Seems a little screwy."
570662,Guest,2008-01-11 11:20:00,0,"Check out the plan a trip page on www.Fish-n-hunt-now.com. It will link you to many of the of the Manitoba lodges. Fly-in trips can range from $1,000 to $5,000 depending on how far you are willing to travel and how many comforts you want to have, ie: indoor plumbing, food, guides, etc... I have had excellent trips to Bolton's main lodge and outposts. If you are a little more cost conscience and not set on Manitoba you might try out Pipestone Flyouts in Ontario. He has some exclusive lakes in Ontario."
570409,Guest,2008-01-04 06:15:00,0,So basically what you are saying is that all three species do not co-exist very well as to the predator/prey relationship with one another? Walleyes do very well with Northerns but not with Lake Trout? Pleas don't take this as an ignorant question or smart comment.

570410,jigman 2003,2008-01-04 06:27:00,981,"No, it isn't a predator/prey issue. It is more an issue of the type of water. Lake trout need deep, cold water. That type of water will also support trophy pike, assuming there are some shallow bays for them to spawn in. It may also support walleyes, but generally not in the huge quantities as a shallower, warmer body of water (I learned this the hard way this past summer). If you are interested in having a ""chance"" at some 2-7 lb. lakers vs. catching real slobs, then there are plenty of lakes to pick from. If you want lakers to be a primary focus, then I'd recommend focusing on them and trophy pike. A lake like that could provide you with some walleyes for supper, but you probably won't go out and catch 30-50 a day. An option I've looked at a number of times (in your price range) is a trophy pike/laker and grayling trip. I'm sure someone will have some more suggestions for you. I would caution you in taking advice on this or any forum. Especially be careful of posts from non-members or non-registered folks. Always follow up with any recommendations by getting references from the outfitter."

But they're bigger lakes, and you won't be the only place on the lake. Birch Lake is one example that I've fished, Trout Lake is probably another."

570384,Guest,2008-01-03 13:01:00,0,Spunkeye why not go to the Sparm Lake. Great fishing in one of Pete's honeyholes. Also reasonably priced. Probabley cost you only a couple of Loads. Let me know.
570385,Guest,2008-01-03 13:35:00,0,Thank you all of you for the information. To be more specific I would like to go to a place that has great numbers in Walleye with above to average size and trophy size Northerns and a place to catch Lake trout.
570388,jigman 2003,2008-01-03 14:31:00,981,"That rules me out. I would think you may be looking more at a Sask. or Manitoba trip. It's tough to get all 3 species with the sizes you're looking for. Generally speaking, if a lake is a good lake trout lake the walleye fishing isn't that great. I'm sure those lakes exist, I just don't know about them."

570348,Guest,2008-01-02 10:34:00,0,"hello, Can anyone recommend an outpost you can fly into that has excellent fishing and is reasonably priced? We are looking into a place for this year with 4-6 people. We were looking at Manitoba, Ontario or Saskatchewan. I know this question is generic in nature but I figured others that post on here would have own opinions rather than opinions from actual owners? Thank you"
570349,Guest,2008-01-02 10:53:00,0,"That will depend on your definition of ""reasonably priced""."
570353,Oldschool,2008-01-02 12:17:00,163,"One of the most reasonably priced, while not what you might call inexpensive, is Due North Outposts. http://www.duenorthoutposts.com/ I was there with 9 others in 2007 and I consider them a quality outfit. Their equipment was good; not new in all cases, but it worked well. We caught a lot of fish, with ""a lot"" being absolutely super for some, and just acceptable to others. It all depends on what you expect, and what experiences you have had. Maybe 20-30 walleyes each day, and 10-15 northerns. Average size, with a few reaching good sizes. They have quite a few different lakes with size options, so they could probalby accommodate about anyting you need. I would go back."
570355,Guest,2008-01-02 12:47:00,0,"Reasonably priced to me would be around $2,000 for a week. Species would be for Walleye, Pike and maybe Lake Trout. Again, I am fishing here on this website because I would rather get the opinion from a fisherman than the owner of an outpost. Thank you."
570358,jigman 2003,2008-01-02 14:01:00,981,"Okay, your reasonable is much better than mine ;-) You should get many responses with that type of range. My suggestion is Mattice Lake Outfitters. I used them for 6 years, then waited too long to book a trip last year. None of the lakes I want to fish are open the week I want to go this year either, but they do have some openings at other lakes. You'll find that places with great reputations will be full or very near full already. A week at MLO's camps are about $1100 as I recall. Here's the website: www.matticelake.com I can personally attest for the fishing at Pringle (3 years), Ogoki (2 years) and Vick (1 year). I would rate them in that order for walleye fishing (Pringle and Ogoki are very close for size and numbers of fish-Pringle is much easier to fish due to being much smaller and not full of standing timber). I'd also be happy to share an outfitter I wouldn't recommend if you contact me via email. Anyone who's been on here for any amount of time already knows that answer."
570361,phishfearme,2008-01-02 14:50:00,1242,"spunkeye - for 2 grand a week you can get almost any ""outpost"" - you're only ruling out the american plan lodges at that rate. look at north of 51, viking, pete johnson, northern outposts and a whole lot more. i suggest you revise your question - ""can i get a week at an isolated, fly-in, housekeeping outpost in northern ontario for $1000"". this number seems like a minimum for a week trip these days but there's a few out there - see jigman's mattice suggestion for example and also north of 51. phish"
570368,Mohleye,2008-01-02 16:08:00,368,"You might also narrow it down a bit by letting us know what your priorities are.... for example: Great walleye numbers, trophy walleye or pike, lake trout or smallmouth fishing available, extra groceries and beer flown in ahead of time or during the week (most outfitters have weight limits), first class accomodations, etc. $2K gives you a lot of options, and if you've never done a fly-in before, it can be a little overwhelming. The more you share about what you're looking for, the better your responses will probably be."
570376,jigman 2003,2008-01-03 06:41:00,981,"One great thing I've found with MLO is their liberal weight limits. 150 lbs. is the highest you'll find. We've been over (way over) a couple times and they didn't charge us extra. They just brought it in later for free. I suppose that may change with currency and fuel issues now. MLO has their plane engines gone over every year, and I've found their pilots to be top notch. Courteous, friendly, and more than happy to go the extra mile. If you are lucky enough to get Don flying you, kick back and relax. I always feel supremely safe when he's ""behind the wheel"". Like previous posters said, narrow your group's main goals and the suggestions here will become more valuable. Good luck, and don't wait too long. With the sport show season starting, the remaining openings will start going fast. If you think you are going the first, second, or third week of June you may want to adjust your dates. At this date I'd suggest you plan on going in mid July or early August. If you consider Ogoki, you could probably still get in during June. That's due to the fact they have 5 cabins at that site. Here's where I'm going this year, thanks to Mr. Walleye. He has nothing but excellent things to say about the place. He's used them for a number of years.http://northernoutposts.ca/"

570381,Guest,2008-01-03 09:30:00,0,"Look at Arctic Watershed Outposts out of Nakina. WWW.awonakina.com We have used them 11 times with #12 this summer. LOTS of fish, walleye, and pike. Great service along with GOOD prices. Seven of us have caught and released over 1600 fish for a week the past several years. Most eyes in the 15 to 25"" range. Largest pike last year were two over 40, 1 at 41"" and a monster at 46"". Have fished several of their lakes and can help with more info. E-mail me [email protected]. Good fishing:cheers:"
