1804034,jkonop,2013-05-24 10:47:00,544,Anyone a a phone number for Dutchies or a web site so we could preorder minnows so there are enough on hand when we arrive.
1804154,worthsr,2013-05-24 11:32:00,52,I Googled Dutchie's general store and came up with this number: 807-529-6556
1804762,lcwhit,2013-05-24 16:38:00,104,I love dutchies. good folks. cold beer.
1395476,jkonop,2012-02-16 20:30:00,544,"How is Dutchies for minnows when it comes to size? Are they a good size or a bit small? Normally I go to Red Lake, this year I am going to Lac Seul. So I am not going to make it up to Ear Falls this year to buy minnows. Dutchies must me my best option, unless I dig around Dryden."
1395503,v-bay gord,2012-02-16 21:34:00,3168,Eagle Junction......between V-Bay and Dryden has good minnows.
1395558,jkonop,2012-02-17 06:58:00,544,"V-Bay Gord...Is that the place on the South side of the Road, closer to V-Bay than Dryden? If so, I know the spot. Thanks!"
1395833,v-bay gord,2012-02-17 18:11:00,3168,"Yes, at the hwy 594 turnoff to Eagle River."
1395866,jkonop,2012-02-17 19:47:00,544,Exactly..Thanks!
1397779,wallydave,2012-02-22 12:50:00,2151,"How has the recent snow fall been? It sounds like the snow fall this year has been on the light side, down here in the Cen. Il after last winter, we nearly tripled the average snow fall, this year we have barely had 3 in.!! Things average out!"
1397792,v-bay gord,2012-02-22 13:17:00,3168,We've had a good dump over the past several days but we are still below average for snow. It has been a great winter weatherwise.....enough snow and ice for outdoor stuff and warm enough temperatures to actually enjoy doing them! Great ice fishing weather.
1398144,Solo Dog,2012-02-23 09:34:00,7,Is there still a place or two to eat in VBay? Any reccomendations?
1398268,NARDA 1,2012-02-23 14:05:00,636,Busters BBQ is great. I heard they are serving breakfast too.
1398292,HeHooksHimself,2012-02-23 14:38:00,725,We did Busters for Dinner and breakfast last year. We were not diasppointed.
1390589,wallydave,2012-02-06 14:32:00,2151,"Any news about the Corner gas station in Vermillion Bay? We stop at Dutchies now for beer, gas, dry ice and Cuban cigars! After so many years certain spots become part of the whole trip experiance!"
1390591,v-bay gord,2012-02-06 14:37:00,3168,"No progress on that corner, but apparently the Traveler Restaurant / Motel (across the highway) was sold and is to be open this summer.....haven't seen any activity there though, so who knows. I'm sure that eventually the Village Corner spot will be picked up....it's a good location, plus once they put the by-pass around Dryden it will be even better!!!"
1390593,wallydave,2012-02-06 14:42:00,2151,"Gord, what is the news about the by-pass? We usually stop in Dryden, before heading to Ear Falls section of LS. Do you have any info for when this project will start? Or how it will effect travel plans? Thanks!"
1390600,v-bay gord,2012-02-06 14:49:00,3168,"The by-pass has been talked about for a number of years, and while I'm not certain on the timelines it seems there is more planning taking place recently. It will definately happen but not sure when. Apparently the bypass will skirt Dryden on the north side from about the Tim Hortons to the 3 mile corner on the west side of town. I don't think it will affect your trip at all......you'll just have to make the turn into town if you wish to stop and shop. I'm sure the town isn't in favour of the bypass but it is a bottleneck for all traffic going east or west in Canada. That's where Vermilion Bay, and specifically the site of the Village Corner might be attractive for some highway related business......I hope!"
1390713,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-02-06 18:23:00,235,Village Corner restaurant was an institution for many years for us. Last stop before Ear Falls area for us. Tasty malts. I would always grab the free map there and follow the lakes and rivers we were passing. The waterfall just a bit north of there always gets my juices flowing for some reason.
1390725,HeHooksHimself,2012-02-06 18:52:00,725,"While we sorely missed the Village Corner last year, Buster's did a fine job as far as we were concerned. Good breakfast too!"
1390732,The Canuck,2012-02-06 18:57:00,67,"The last I heard was the owners took a payout from the Insurance company and will not be rebuilding. I know that there was some issues with the Insurance company paying out due to 3 or 4 layers of roofing put on over the years, it was definetly a shock when I heard of the tragic news as it was a regular stop for me and my family on the way out of town. If you are on your way up to the Red Lake area, the 105 restaraunt in Ear Falls is a great place to stop as well great food."
1390842,wallydave,2012-02-07 05:50:00,2151,"Thanks Gord for the update! The Corner was a nice place to stop, I liked how they provided jobs for the local youth! It had been a long time since anyone pumped gas and cleaned the windshield the way they did!"
1392100,Glenman12,2012-02-09 19:39:00,762,"Sorry to hear about the Village Corner not reopening..have they leveled it yet? btw Gord, how thick is the ice up the and how much snow is on it.."
1392149,v-bay gord,2012-02-09 21:31:00,3168,"The site is cleared except for the clothing store which is still open. Depending on what lake you are on there is about 2 feet of ice.......some snow, but not a lot. Could be a low water year coming up unless we get some good spring rains."
