1795410,mudpusher,2013-05-21 18:23:00,248,18 more days for us.
1793834,camp chef,2013-05-21 10:40:00,915,Less than 48 hours to go. I almost wish there was still something to pack or get ready.Sleep will be difficult the next 2 nights.Maybe a couple Labatts after work will help. Good luck and safe travels to all headed to Canada this week.
1793978,Golden Eagle,2013-05-21 11:01:00,2642,Have at it!
1793986,wallydave,2013-05-21 11:03:00,2151,"The last day or two before the trip drive me crazy!! No matter how many trips and checking the packing list, those days are on snail speed! Have a great trip! Be sure and let us know how it went when you get back! There are some of us that still have 25 days to go!"
1794066,Hewhocookstomuch,2013-05-21 11:27:00,66,"I have less than thirty days too go. These are the slowest for me. Since I live in Virginia, I have to fly to Minnesota to hook up with Stjoeguy. I have to ship my bulky items to him, nothing but carry on luggage for me. So I have repack that several times. My fishing gear, sleeping bag, and other items I leave in Minnesota. So this time really drags along. I fly up three days before we head North, those three pass rather fast, since we are making our food purchases, finally trip to Cabala's and packing everything in the boat and truck. Maybe if they are home, a Twins game. What is the story on the ""WALLEYE CENTRAL"" bumper stickers?"
1794090,vteye,2013-05-21 11:33:00,812,"One more night as we depart tomorrow evening. Last night was a beautiful nights sleep, worked 12 hours and off to bed at 10, awoke first time at12:30 am, then 3:30 and gave up at 4:45. Safe travels"

I've never been one for bumper stickers but the Walleye Central stickers are sweet. Great boat and truck bling.
1794514,MrSimon,2013-05-21 13:31:00,922,"We leave first thing tomorrow morning! This afternoon at work is SSSSSLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWW! I've still got some last minute preparations and packing to do tonight, but hopefully I'll be in bed early ..... so I can lay there for hours trying to fall asleep."
1794730,Smallmouth Hunter,2013-05-21 14:37:00,84,Down to 22 and sleep is already getting a little tough. Fishing meeting on Sunday and that will help and then make it worse all at once.
1795362,rnnonmt,2013-05-21 18:09:00,992,Hope you guys dont need to travel the 502 on the way to Dryden. Couple post on WC already about 502 being closed due to a washout.
