1800866,IMSPIKE,2013-05-23 10:36:00,12,The 502 does provide some pretty scenery. The problem is that the scenrery sometimes makes people make poor decisions. Ex. stopping in the middle of the HWY to take pictures of bear's in the ditch.
1800986,midwest,2013-05-23 11:40:00,25,What about taking Turtle River Rd?
1801218,2746,2013-05-23 12:48:00,3206,We have but if your pulling a boat and it's been raining your boat will be covered in a rock dust mud that's tough to get off. If it's dry or just driving a pickup no problem. On the other hand we are usually ready for a stop by the time we get to Dryden.....a bunch of old men and we can't pass a gas station.
1801418,Pawchaser,2013-05-23 14:36:00,31,CKDR reporting that 502 is back open again.
1799290,misspike,2013-05-22 19:56:00,4,"It is normally 2 hours to Dryden from Ft. Frances on 502. Then another 2 hours to Sioux Lookout. You will want to take Highway 11 East (to Thunder Bay), then Highway 17 West. What would normally take you 4'ish hours, is now going to be about 7.5 hours."
1799466,Glenman12,2013-05-22 20:29:00,762,you think that would be faster than taking 11 west and then 71 north to 17 and then east?
1799482,misspike,2013-05-22 20:36:00,4,No... you are right. Google maps says it would only be 5.5 hours if you go 11 W to 71 to 17.
1799530,tackleman,2013-05-22 20:55:00,444,"when I go to fort frances from red lake, the route through Sioux narrows is only 1/2 longer than going 502 route"
1799546,2746,2013-05-22 20:57:00,3206,Thanks! I missed going with my regular group this year (grandson's graduation) and didn't have any contact with them. Was wondering what they were experiencing.
1799618,115 optimax,2013-05-22 21:28:00,650,Follow hwy 11 east from Fort to hwy 11B to Atikokan then follow 622 north to hwy 17.Turn left on to 17.From there it's only about 30 mins to hwy 72 for Sioux lookout
1799914,2746,2013-05-23 04:49:00,3206,That is what we have experienced on our trips to gullrock and we often do that just for a change in scenery.
1799922,wallydave,2013-05-23 04:58:00,2151,The first and last time we went this way one of our group got caught in a speed trap by the First Nation. For that reason and the scenery we like the 502. Its good to have the options in case of closures.
1800306,Strickers cut,2013-05-23 07:28:00,33,"This is unrelated to the 502 washout, but does anyone take the Oxdrift shortcut?"
1800450,Glenman12,2013-05-23 08:10:00,762,"if you are talking about the road that runs along the north shore of Eagle Lake and comes out on 17, then yes we do.."
1795042,tackleman,2013-05-21 16:30:00,444,washout was reported on the ckdr (Dryden radio) website. as of 3:25pm today. you may want to check the road conditions before heading up this weekend
1795162,2746,2013-05-21 17:17:00,3206,"Any report on where on 502? On another subject, has the ice left fully on Gullrock?"
1795306,Outfitter17,2013-05-21 17:46:00,127,"Larrym,It's only a couple miles up the 502, just north of the turn off of hwy 11 east."
1795370,NARDA 1,2013-05-21 18:10:00,636,HIGHWAY 502 CLOSED near intersection with Hwy 11 No word from OPP as to when Hwy 502 (Dryden to Fort Frances via Hwy 11) will reopen after a partial washout. This photo sent to us at 2:45 PM by Michelle Nordin
1795658,2746,2013-05-21 19:50:00,3206,Ouch!! That would make for a bad day......or maybe a bad week.
1796098,rnnonmt,2013-05-21 22:11:00,992,Eh... It's only a dodge.
1799002,wallydave,2013-05-22 18:57:00,2151,The Dryden radio station site says the 502 will be closed a couple of days. Hopefully the road willnbe open in three weeks or so! The drive on the 502 is one of the things I want to show my wife on her first trip North!
1799010,Minnow Man,2013-05-22 18:58:00,85,Hello Larry M Gullrock Lake was ice free Sunday evening. Both Northern & Walleye are biting.
1799026,Glenman12,2013-05-22 18:59:00,762,"about 3-4 yrs ago it was washed out on our way up..had to go via 71...but it was open on our way back..shouldn't take too long, weather permitting.."
1799154,Ranger319,2013-05-22 19:30:00,166,"So if you are leaving Fort Frances and need to get to Sioux Lookout and 502 was closed, what is the next best road to take? How much extra time would that add? Thanks"
