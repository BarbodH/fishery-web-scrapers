1793362,Fishoil,2013-05-21 08:26:00,1277,A galvanized trailer and an unpainted aluminum boat are a good idea too.
1793594,115 optimax,2013-05-21 09:22:00,650,"Yup!Iv'e never seen so many fenders,bunks,license plates and parts of exhaust systems laying on the side of the road as I do when i'm going to Williams Bay.When we haul off the North road we put a real bad hurt'n on it!"
1794738,Bill Krejca,2013-05-21 14:44:00,6107,"Good advice, I might add to assure that the flaps are not too low, to avoid the flaps hitting the road going over a bump and throwing up gravel. Bill"
1794994,mickr,2013-05-21 16:07:00,74,"thanks guys, I appreciate all of the advice. I was thinking the best thing to do would be too keep as little as weight as possible on the boat but I can certainly fill it with gear and put water in the wells."
1796378,McQ,2013-05-22 06:04:00,615,"I've logged many thousands of miles over gravel the last 35 years and this is a summary and solution for problems incurred. PRETTY DOESN""T CUT IT!!!!! Never had a trailer flat and never a bearing problem. Have experienced loose bunks and winch anchors. Lost a few license plates. Have had two flats on the truck. (4ply factory on new truck purchases) Sheered the lug nuts on a rear wheel of truck (this was very serious, was many miles from any service and had to have the truck towed to make repairs. not only expensive but the problem of getting the boat and gear into the outfitter cost a bunch of fishing time). Sand blasted a painted boat so bad it had to be sent to the factory for repainting (expensive). Same issue with a couple of painted trailers. Same issue with the foot of motors. Dented the hull trailering on a roller trailer when the rear straps loosened. Lost a few fenders, broken lights etc. My prep list and solutions to minimize problems and damage. Galvanized bunk trailer for past 30 years. Before every trip I get the boat off the trailer at a launch and go over every nut and bolt, check carpet on bunks for wear and use chain links to hold the license plate. I don't worry about lights - they are easy to replace and inexpensive. Check trailer tires, inflate to spec (replace if any unusual wear pattern) check and grease bearings and hub (have an extra hub and 2 bearing kits, including grease in my tool kit) 6 ply tires minimize flats and I rely on 2 spares for the trailer (never had to use them). Make sure lug nuts are torqued to the right spec. I lost the wheel to stressed lugs from an over zealous use of an air wrench. My boats are still painted but I tarp the hull completely front to trailer fenders. 25' tarp does this job and bungy cords secure it well. Wrap the motor foot with carpet remnant and secure with bungy cord. I do run an extra strap across the rear of the boat secured to the trailer to back up the trailer straps. I stop every hour of the trip - do a walk around and check everything, catching potential problems before they become an issue. I do load some gear and supplies in the boat but only in the rear not under the tarp so I can check on things when I do my walk around. Do the right things before you leave home and enjoy the trip."
1791242,mickr,2013-05-20 16:45:00,74,Hi guys I have a looong trailer run in front of me in a couple of weeks on a gravel road. Anything specific i should do to prepare for that other than ensuring my tires and bearings are in good shape. I appreciate any insight from guys that do this regularly
1791314,Walleye_Guru,2013-05-20 17:07:00,62,Recommend you run your tire pressure down to 20  25lbs. It will absorb a lot of the shock and awe of the roads. FYI  local logging roads are in VERY rough shape. The frost and run off has terrorized many primary routes. Not to mention those blasted BEAVERS!
1791570,Fred_G,2013-05-20 18:11:00,908,Slow down to 30 Mph or less. Driving 50-60 mph will have no paint left on your trailer frame.
1791626,Fisherman1792,2013-05-20 18:28:00,927,And make sure you have a spare tire. Best too to bring an extra set of wheel bearings.
1791698,Ogoki,2013-05-20 18:38:00,291,"3 or 4 years ago on our bear hunt / fishing trip we had 29 miles of gravel road to get to camp. Then all driving all week would be gravel logging roads. The first thing the outfitter said to us when we arrived was , what brand tires are on your truck . We said Bridgestone . He said the other three trucks that were already at camp all had at least one flat so far and they were Bridgestone tries . I thought ya right ,must be coincidence . Well you guessed it ,second day in camp I too had a flat. The trucks with other brands went all week without a flat. I would not have believed it ,if I had not been there."
1791834,a3dad,2013-05-20 19:22:00,115,you should also wrap up the boat as tight as possible to keep the all that dreaded dust out.
1792138,Fishoil,2013-05-20 20:10:00,1277,"Last trip up I ran about 350 miles on gravel and had 3 flats, one on the truck and two on the boat trailer. Make sure you have good tires and a spare on the truck. Take it down before you go so you know it will come down (I had a bad experience that could have been avoided by this), loosen and retorque all your lugnuts before you go so that you know you can get them off if you need to. Use the tools that you will have along to do it. Carry at least 2 spare tires for the boat trailer, a spare set of bearings, a hub, extra grease and seals. Make sure you're capable of changing these items too. Take a well stocked tool box and a small floor jack. If you're prepared for the problems that can (and will) happen it makes it easy to fix them and continue on with your trip."
1792506,115 optimax,2013-05-20 21:36:00,650,"Take 2 spare trailer tires,make sure all of the U-bolts,bunks,and fenders are tight.Ratchet strap you engine to one side and use a transom saver of some sort.Cover the bow with something so it doesn't look like someone shot your boat with 12 guage bird shot.Drive slower than normal.When the roads were real bad on the way to Lac Suel we would lower the tire pressure and add a bunch of water under the floor of the boat so it wouldn't bounce around as bad.If you got live wells fill them up and plug the holes with a towel."
1792706,Skywagon,2013-05-21 04:53:00,1106,"Williams Bay is hard on trailers, swore off for 5 years, went back last year with a friend and remembered again why I swore off the first time."
1792938,tv4fish,2013-05-21 06:34:00,2694,"mickr: You have received some good advice -- the one thing I might add - if you can, put some BIG mudflaps on your tow vehicle to prevent it from throwing rocks up onto your boat."
