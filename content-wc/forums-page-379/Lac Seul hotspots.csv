1799450,muskyroller,2013-05-22 20:24:00,56,"Fished chamberlain narrows for muskies but the group I fish with likes the size of walleyes on the west end of Lac Seul...plus, a heck of a lot easier to get to and cheaper. So, I was just hoping...Been at it for big pike the last few years on the west end without a sighting of a musky."
1799474,misspike,2013-05-22 20:32:00,4,"The biggest musky I have caught was 37, but I netted a 49.5. Three guys were out last year and boated 5 monsters, and the year before a girl I know caught a 55.... Monster fish. I have my big walleye on the wall, now I am holding out for a big pike (biggest being 40) and musky.... maybe this summer."
1800298,Mike Kansas,2013-05-23 07:28:00,1463,"I have been fishing Lac Seul for 30 years. Have fished east end, west end north shore and south shore and in my opinion there are two factors that govern Walleye fishing on Lac Seul. First of all the time of the year determines the fish general location. After spawn they start their transistion to deeper water and by july 1 you can catch eyes anywhere from 4' of water to 20' of water over sunken islands and other deep cover. The other factor especially early in the year when the eyes are shallow is the wind. If you fish points and shores that have wind blowing in on them it increases your catch rate because the wind blows the plancten in and the minnows follow the plancten and the eyes follow the minnows. As we all know eyes are voracious eaters and minnows in shallow water are like a McDonalds sign to grandkids. Fish slow and when jigging stay in contact with the jig. When you feel something ""Different"" set the hook. Sometimes when the fish are not aggressive all you feel is a ""tick"" instead of a hard bite. Get a sensitive rod and catch a bunch Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1801810,LoDo,2013-05-23 16:42:00,721,"I've heard great things about the Chamberlain narrows and musky fishing! I have a dear friend who's family hits up Sioux Lookout annually and have good luck with muskies! I have yet to catch one, but I don't necessarily fish musky waters. Someday!"
1801922,muskyroller,2013-05-23 17:42:00,56,"It's interesting how the same lake can fish so differently. I realize that the East and West sections of LS are miles apart, but the variety of spots to fish is amazing the further east you go. Up by Chamberlain you have everything you can think of - reefs, rock/rubble shorelines, cabbage beds, stump fields, stump fields with cabbage, sand beaches, neck downs w/current - I'm probably missing a few other areas, too. To the east it seems like it's hard to even find a decent size cabbage bed. Fish rocks and TRY to find some current. The muskies are crazy big over in the east section...man, do I need to get back!!!"
1727633,bigtimeelectric,2013-04-30 08:46:00,174,"I don't know what they are called, but the three small islands half way between steamboat narrows and goose island. I usually shoot right between 2 of them on my way from Gawleys Little Beaver lodge on my way to Makenzie bay. Last year we stoped and jig fished a inside corner on the east side of that structure and wow we popped some good fish. Nothing over 20"" but about 30 nice eyes in a couple hours for 2 boats. Has anybody else fished these islands? I know for most of us it is just a blow by spot on the way south. It won't be long know fellas!!!!!"
1727785,Guest,2013-04-30 09:20:00,0,ShhhhhhhhhhhhhÂ¡ Those are fun to fish and watch everyone else drive by to go another ten miles to fish. Lots of good spots close to camp. It just depends what scenery you want while fishing.
1729609,lcwhit,2013-04-30 16:59:00,104,"all of those islands from goose to steamboat hold walleye at times. seems to depend a lot on wind direction. ive had some really good times on them, but they can be spotty."
1742865,bigtimeelectric,2013-05-04 08:31:00,174,I have also caught them on the southwest corner of the island lunker point is on although I forget the name of the island.I have also had some fair luck a on the east side of goose island
1750841,LoDo,2013-05-06 19:40:00,721,"Enough said! Pick a day and head to McKenzie Bay! There are countless spots! Work the wind, depths, rocky points, etc... McKenzie Bay never disappoints! Have fun!"
1752833,bigtimeelectric,2013-05-07 11:19:00,174,"LODO, mackenzie bay goes without saying, great area to fish and I run down there every day the weather lets me. However it intrigues me that the fishing isn't as good in that section of the lake in the summer. The only conclussion I can draw is lack of forage from steamboat narrows North. I am trying to see if others have good success up there or if the fishing is tougher like what I have experienced? There is great structure, flowing water just like down south. So I thought I would get the conversation going on here as some of the other threads I have no interest in. Good luck out there fella!what time of year do you go up?"
1752953,wallydave,2013-05-07 11:52:00,2151,"I have been fishing the NW end of LS for many years, early to mid-June. The bite moves away from the spawning areas during this time. Ice-out and water levels are always different, adding to the mix of finding fish. Making adjustments is just part of fishing a large body of water. This year will be no different, a later than usual ice-out, low water levels as least for now, time will tell on that. I am looking forward to trying some new spots this year, some of the islands, Steamboat and some other areas too!."
1754609,LoDo,2013-05-07 20:22:00,721,"I first started fishing Lac Seul in 2001. Our group stayed in Ear Falls at a camp called Three Pines or something close to that name. I don't remember. We found ourselves in long boat rides to McKenzie every day we stayed. The following 5-6 years we stayed at Onaway and Lac Seul lodge to the south of Ear Falls. We figured if we are going to fish McKenzie we might as well stay closer. Both camps are nice. Fishing McKenzie is one of my fav places. So many great spots! We always fish late May and early June. Spring fishing!The last 5 years our group has been going to Donald Lake in the Caribou National Forest which is dead west of Red Lake. There are three compounds/camps on this lake and all three are owned by the same group of investors. We have the lake to ourselves. Great fishing! Several inlets and outlets to other lakes. Absolutely beautiful! We get into some lake trout and cook them in an all day smoker! Good eats! Of course we are all about frying walleyes too... jig and minnow on those lake trout if you can believe it. Our group will be in Donald June 6 to 14.I'd like to get over to Sioux Lookout on the east side of Lac Seul someday. I don't believe there are muskies in McKenzie or up near Ear Falls. I could be wrong?? Def not muskies in Donald. Big Northerns though! Anyways, happy fishing this summer! Best of luck!"
1798906,muskyroller,2013-05-22 18:30:00,56,"Been staying at Onaway now the last five years for the same reasons as above...why stay up near ear falls, just to make the run all the way to McKenzie. Wondering, once you get through the narrows into McKenzie, has anyone done anything up towards the north and northeast section of the bay. Typically fish around the big island and small islands...then south of big island. Wondering about checking out the northern part to add to the milk-run. Will be up June 21-28. Can't wait!And, if anyone has seen any muskies in the area???? As you can tell by the screen name...that's my bread and butter! )"
1799322,LoDo,2013-05-22 19:58:00,721,Continue past the Big Island to the northeast. Pass Deer Island and go all the way to the small island (not named) on my map that sits by its lonesome. Its the last island before you hit the shallows. The southwest end of that island fishes extremely well. There is a rock that is enormous that sits by itself and all around that rock is insanely good. 12-20ft in depth! Big fish! From Deer Island to the island i'm referring to is all good! Other good spots is along little and big sandbanks just south of Deer Island. In the past usually there are always boats there. All around Ghost Narrows are usually good. The south side of Cormorant Islands is another great spot. I have yet to get south and east of Manitoba Point. Musky - I dont think you are going to find musky north and west of Manitoba point. I could be wrong. I know musky is plentiful near Sioux Lookout! Sioux Lookout is a long boat ride!
