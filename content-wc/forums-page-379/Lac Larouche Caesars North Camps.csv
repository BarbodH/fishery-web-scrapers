1797378,rsiminski,2013-05-22 10:31:00,53,I'm heading up to Clova June 21st fishing with Caesars North Camps and staying at Larouche. I was wondering if anyone has fished this lake before and could tell me what the fishing was like. 2 years ago I flew into Little Benny with Caesars and we had a fantastic trip. I'm hopeing for the same results. So if anyone can share some knowledge it would be greatly appreciated.
