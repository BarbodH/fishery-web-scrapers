I called the OPP and they said it is completely closed and to listen to the local radio station - updates will be broadcast as they come up. The lady I talked to said she thought is might be closed for a while (day or two). If you are planning this route, please listen to 93.1 fm as you get closer to Fort Frances/I. Falls for updates. I will post when I hear its reopened, if someone doesn't do it sooner."
