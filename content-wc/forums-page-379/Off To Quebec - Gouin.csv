Only thing different this year will be I'm going solo. Searched high & low for a partner but no luck.I remember I had a waiting list for these trips but the ole gang has called it quits. I will travel in daylight as night travel alone for me is not a good idea. I'm not too good at dodging upstate NY deer...last year around Watertown our truck lost out to a whitetail. Boooooo. Had to get a rental in the morning and drive back 200 miles to get another truck.Oh well, I am as excited as usually...only wish the better half wasn't so worried. Post a report when I return. FT"
