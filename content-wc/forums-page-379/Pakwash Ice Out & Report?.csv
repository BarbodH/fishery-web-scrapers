1796682,REG,2013-05-22 07:26:00,445,I heard from Snake Falls Monday that the lake still had some ice but I'm guessing there can't be much - and it might be gone by now. Will be a late spring for sure but can't imagine it will be a problem for you. When/where are you going?

1797386,NathanH,2013-05-22 10:32:00,697,Snake Falls? Are you referring to a certain transplant to Ear Falls?
1797450,REG,2013-05-22 10:55:00,445,"Not sure about transplants, but Snake Falls Camp is on the north edge of Pakwash. Plenty of water coming into the lake from the Chukuni, so I suspect the ice clears out of there first.."
