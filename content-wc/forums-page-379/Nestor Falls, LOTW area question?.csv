1802010,stillangling,2013-05-23 18:24:00,149,The outflow of lake of the woods at Kenora is 46 F as of today. The mouth of the Rainy is a little warmer than that at 47. Back bays will be warmer but the main basin of the lake should be close to that. We are supposed to get a good frost tonight and the next three days are below average temps.
