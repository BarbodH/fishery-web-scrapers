1797370,Terwalleye,2013-05-22 10:30:00,166,"Hey Glenman,Getting giddy yet? 3 weeks from heading north for our group. Chatter level is up, lists being checked, more un-needed lures being bought. lolHey you mention Richmond to the north of Nelson. I know there used be a culvert there, too small for a boat. Did they make it a bridge? I thought I read more about this somewhere last fall; but can't find that thread."
1799042,Glenman12,2013-05-22 19:04:00,762,"yeah..one day last year me and my partner were fishing Nelson..we would see boats going in that direction and then ""disappear"" in the reeds..we headed over there and yes..theres a bridge there now that you can get under and into Richmond..I think if the water levels were extremely high you would have a problem though..stopped in there a few times and always caught fish ( must be a mud bottom or something because the walleye in there are the darkest Ive ever seen) and of course my first Cedar Lake crappie.."
1766433,team walleye,2013-05-11 15:31:00,336,Anyone ever have any luck? Where on the lake should I be looking? Thanks!
1766593,JayM5209,2013-05-11 17:02:00,1050,"Several times in recent years I've seen a crappie caught in a lake upstream from Perrault. However, I do not think there is an established population of any significant size in the chain of lakes Perrault is part of. One may be caught in Perrault now and then, but not enough to spend time looking for them. Crappies are not indigenous to the lakes in that area."
1766721,team walleye,2013-05-11 18:21:00,336,I was wondering that i have heard of people catching them but I have fished Perrault several times and never have seen one myself.
1767113,Rich B,2013-05-11 21:26:00,1081,"I'd suggest Nelson Lake (in the Cedar Lake chain), if you want to fish Crappies.....we fished Nelson Lake one afternoon and pulled some nice sized Crappies as well as decent perch....try the shallow areas off the island in Nelson (that's where we found them). Good luck, Rich B"
1768473,Glenman12,2013-05-12 12:30:00,762,Hi Rich...we caught crappies last year in Lake Richmond north of Nelson while trolling for walleyes..we plan on targeting them this year for an evening or so...thanks for the tip on the island in Nelson..what side of the island were you getting them on?
1769385,Rich B,2013-05-12 20:27:00,1081,"GM, On the side closest to the channel (on your left) when you enter Nelson lake......there's a flat that extends out from the island, and we found them in and next to bull rushes out toward the tip of the flat.....very nice size crappie. Am taking another group up for the opener.....Cedar is a special Lake....thanks again for your help and advice when I was checking it out a few years back. Take good care, Rich"
1769585,nitroman,2013-05-12 21:28:00,368,Peephole is also another place we found them in Cedar.
1769593,Glenman12,2013-05-12 21:29:00,762,"we found them in and next to bull rushes out toward the tip of the flat.....very nice size crappie."" I know exactly where you mean...thanks and good luck this year.."
1770425,Glenman12,2013-05-13 09:25:00,762,hi Nitroman...where were you picking them up in Peephole?
1773721,nitroman,2013-05-14 10:25:00,368,All the way to the back northeast corner where you you turn the corner to the north to hit the last bay. If you are trolling the north shore along the weedbeds in the east side of the bay there are some there too. Not to many caught in the lake yet just one or two here and there but no patterns evolving. 16 days for us how about you?
