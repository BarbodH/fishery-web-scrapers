The only open water is the channel under the bridge from Richmond to Nelson Lake. The ice on the lake is not very dark yet. Glad I'm not booked for opening wk."
1769977,Kevin R,2013-05-13 06:56:00,305,Well it looks like Perrault will be open before June & my guess was a big long shot. Think it should clear quick it's 37f this morning winter is ending. A few times I have been fishing in August when it started snowing in that area but think this fall will be nice.

I'm skidooing up the lake by snowmachine getting cabins cleaned and ready to go. Ice is shore to shore with snow still on top. It's warming up here now though and the animals are out and about...tracks everywhere. Eagles nesting. Warm enough for a drink on the deck today. Hmm that sounds good. See ya later. (picture is from 7 am this morning.)"
1711737,wallydave,2013-04-24 18:34:00,2151,Looks like the temps for Ear Fall and Red Lake will be above freezing even at night for the next couple of days! That will help get things started! Any official predictions!?

Going back this summer.They have an Ice Out Watch on their photos page. Latest pictures are from 2 days ago. Pretty cool shots!Looks very frozen up in Ontario still! Where is the global warming we were promised.Here is the link:http://www.hiddenbay.com/photosvideos.htmlI hope they post more to keep us updated!!

1732713,zeebee,2013-05-01 14:39:00,1144,Ice out in Red Lake week after the 20th....just cant see it before unless a major heat wave and that's not in the forecast.

1692545,Kevin R,2013-04-19 13:30:00,305,My Dad just spoke with my uncle yesterday that lives on Lac Vieux Desert just north of Eagle River WI it was snowing & ice is thick. My uncle thinks this will be a late ice out May 15th or so. Kabatogama has many feet of ice & snow with more snow / cold coming rest of next two weeks if it doesn't warm up soon it could be June before lakes in Canada open up. I was heading north in about a week now pushed it back a month it's just getting warm in Florida we had a very cold March. My guess Perrualt lake opens June 1st

Their long term forecast was not looking very promising either . We don't fly in until about June 7 , so we should be ok by then ,I hope. LOL. I don't have any guesss when ice will be out there.
