I would also like the show to be within driving distance of a Cabelas store. Any suggestions? I see several in Minn and WI, but would like to get your opinion on a good one. I have access to walleye tackle and gear via mail order only, so would be looking to see this type of gear."

The Minneapolis Boat Show id great for boats, electronics and marine toy, the dates for that show are 1/15-19/03. There is a large Cabelas that my wife says I part own for all I've spent there, in Owatanna (sp) which is only an hour or 90 minutes south. Maybe someone has the dates of the other show for you. One last suggestion, dress warm. Good luck.Tom"
525215,IaDave,2002-10-26 08:13:00,476,Check out the Chicagoland Outdoors Show. Do a search on-line for the website. Dates are Jan 15-19.

Seminars by some of the legends in walleye fishing and some of the current top professionals run for 3.5 days. Usually Thursday evening thru Sunday. I believe always the first weekend of February. It's held at Canterbery Downs, a horse racing track. Has several levels of exhibits, boat dealers, fishing equipment, seminars, resorts ect... Usually a pretty good time for the avid Walleye Anglers wanting to go to a show dedicated to nothing but walleye anglers. Cabelas is only about 90 minutes from there. Also...if you like to gamble at all, they have a huge card room and serve food in the same complex off a wing. A group of us fishing buddies drive there every year 3 hours for a little mid winter get-a-way.Maybe we will see ya there!"
525217,AL,2002-10-28 04:57:00,89,Thanks for the info. I was looking at the Walleye show. I was also looking at the all-Canada show. Anyone ever attend that?
