525006,Guest,2002-10-19 06:31:00,0,Canadian handgun control is supose to be so good? So how is this incident with the EPA employee shooting two co-workers with his registered 9mm any different than simalar incidents in the USA?
525007,Guest,2002-10-22 05:26:00,0,It's different because it doesn't happen every 3 seconds.
525008,Guest,2002-10-22 18:32:00,0,targa2 The argument could easily be made that population denseity = frequency. Canadian gun control didn't prevent the occurance did it?
525009,bigfish1965,2002-10-23 15:58:00,3210,"I'm glad you asked that question teadrinker. A search on the internet of gov't sites in Canada and the U.S. gave me the following stats. Homicide rates.. Canada 2.2 per 100,000 U.S. 8.3 per 100,000 Violent crime rate.. Canada 100 per 100,000 U.S. 550 per 100,000 These are the averages of the years 1987-1992. During those years, the U.S. homicide rate grew by 30% to 9.3 per 1,000. and the Canadian rate grew to 2.7 per 1,000. However by 1998 the US rate had fallen to 6.62 per 1,000 and Canada's had fallen to 1.8 per 1,000. Robberies... In the period 1987-1996, an average of 38% of robberies in the US involved guns. In Canada during the same period, 25% of robberies involved guns. However the U.S. trend was upward as 1987 saw 33% of robberies using guns and by 1997 that number jumped to 42%. During that same time Canada's rate fell from 26% to 21%. The overall robbery by firearm rate was 91 per 100,000 in the U.S. and 26 per 100,000 in Canada. In the same period the U.S. average of homicides by gun was 5.7 per 100,000 while Canada's was 0.7 per 100,000. In the U.S. 1,441 people were killed by gun accidents while only 38 were killed in Canada during the same period. So what were you saying about it just looking bad because of the population difference?"
525010,Guest,2002-10-23 16:18:00,0,"Well if gun control doesn't work then how come I have never seen the cops pointing a gun at someone here ordering them out of there car?It does work..... its not without its flaws but I'll take the miniscule times someone use's a hand gun for crime over an everyday occurance.Not to mention, we have never had a serial sniper wacko on the loose here shooting children and old ladies. (not maling light of the situation.... just telling it like it is)Yes I do own guns FYI.MachZ"
525011,Guest,2002-10-24 17:51:00,0,Guns don't kill peoplple ....people do. Its just a little easier when there millions of guns laying around and the people have a tendancy for violence
