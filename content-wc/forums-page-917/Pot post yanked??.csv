525087,Guest,2002-10-23 15:18:00,0,"Just wondering why the ""Pot Laws in Canada"" post got yanked?? Could it be that our webmaster is disguising himself as the Minister Jerry Falwell perhaps? Or maybe it's Jimmy Swaggart or Oral Roberts or Billy Graham? We'll never know for sure I guess....I mean really, we talk about drowning squirrels in garbage cans, gun control laws(can get pretty heated sometimes),killing Saddam(can be pretty graphic sometimes), but you are censoring a discussion about the Pot Laws in Canada. How righteous of you!!! Thank you ""Big Brother"" for showing me the right way and for doing my thinking for me."
525088,Guest,2002-10-23 16:59:00,0,There are plenty of people and places on the web to discuss pot. Why do you need to discuss it on this website? Bigfish
525090,Guest,2002-10-23 19:31:00,0,"Nice, Leaf.I personally did not see the thread, nor did I yank it. I will look into it.Let's see, we have been called Stalin, Hitler, Commie, Censor, playing favorites etc, but never Jerry Falwell.I might suggest if the rest of your posts carry the tone that this one does, that may have been a factor. But then I don't know.I will check with Scott (Jerry Falwell) and see what's up.In the meantime, we do not Censor anything. We do not play favorites. We are human, but try to be even handed. If we feel a post is out of line or carries no reasonable good by being there, it gets removed.if a post goes overboard with language, attacks and innapropriate content we remove it.Who decides inaapropriate? We do. But we try to be fair. You may not see eye to eye with us on every issue here, or you may not agree with us yanking a post, but we did not nor will we ever personally attack you and toss around accuzations or speculate on your moral character, we only ask the same in return."

525095,Guest,2002-10-26 09:47:00,0,All that will happen if pot is legalized in Canada is that the USA will need more and bigger jails to house the smugglers caught on the US border.Maybe the US should send that bill back to us in Canada?
525096,Guest,2002-10-26 12:51:00,0,That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!!!
