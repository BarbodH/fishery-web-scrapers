525233,Guest,2002-10-29 20:35:00,0,I was wondering how the fishing was at Lac O'sullivan (Quebec) this summer? We're thinking of heading there in 2003...

I believe the water temp was at least 10 degrees lower than typical for that time and it showed in the fishing. Warming weather helped make each day progressively better, so all in all it was a great trip as usual. The big Laker for the week was 18 pounds, and the biggest pike, although we don't target them went 11 lbs."
