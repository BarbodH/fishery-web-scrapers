524883,Guest,2002-10-15 07:32:00,0,"There has been some talk on what's really happening on the Red these days. I'm far from an expert but would like to share our experiences.This was our eigth consecutive year of fishing the Selkirk portion of the Red. We fished 10-6 to 10-10. Every year we have come to fish at some time between the 5th and 15th of October.Let's start at the early years:For the first three years everyone caught fish. We stumbled around, trolled, jigged and caught good fish( 9 lbs. & up ) all up and down the river. It was fantastic!!The next three years fishing was still very good by any standard. We had become familiar with the river and knew where to troll and where to jig. We caught our share of fish, more than most, less than many. We now had quite a group of friends we have met to keep up with the reports and share stories with.The last two years have been very poor. Not just for us but for the entire group. A group that includes locals and long term Red River veterans. Last year a few boats found quality fish. They were the very lucky or very skilled. We still managed to salvage our trip with a handful of quality fish but nothing like the days of the past. This year was extreemly poor. Many very good fisherman going day's without a fish. We did bail out and went to Pine Falls but the Red was dead.My conclusion is that there arn't the fish in the Red, perhaps one could still score a big fish, there were reports of a handful of big fish taken. However, this from a hundred boats and many, many hours of fishing. I don't know what has happend, I don't have any answers but do know a once super fishery has lost it's magic. I just wanted to share our history and hope others may chime in with their experience.Eyegore"
524884,Dan,2002-10-15 11:50:00,325,"Who really knows for sure ... but in my mind commercial fishing on Lake Winnipeg has really taken its toll in the last few years. In places like Traverse Bay I believe the extensive curtain of nets is simply keeping most of the fall run from get into that river.FYI ... Nets go in Sept. 1 and have to be out at the end of Oct.(?). No commercial net is allow within 1 km of the river mouth.Last year I spoke with MNR fisheries biologists and hear that, since they have only two biologists covering Southern Manitoba, that Lake Winnipeg is not well understood.I'm looking for the name but can't find it .... I also spoke with the head of MNR(?) and learned that:- '95-98 commercial walleye harvest off of the Lake was one quarter of the historical average. And then the commercial fisherman discovered that walleye stocks had rebounded and ...- in '99 the commercial walleye harvest established an all-time record (more than 4x more fish harverted than in the previous year.- in 2000 the harvest established a new all-time record exceeding '99- I don't know 2001's harvest but like this year there are nets everywhereThis resource is better managed so that there will always be good sportsfishing. Walleye are worth way more than the $1-1.5 per pound that Manitoba's fish marketing board pays."
524885,Dan,2002-10-15 11:56:00,325,"correction: ""This resource needs to be better managed ..."""
524886,walleyedude,2002-10-15 12:15:00,34,"You did not even mention the Native'subsistance'fishery!Those nets are allowed everywhere and are there all fall and winter!I know of at least 5 in the river right now,and I am sure there is plenty more out in the lake.There is no regulation of the native fishery,they take what they want (any size)when they want.The courts and government do not want to deal with this issue so the fishery suffers.The natives were once only allowed to take what they could eat,then the courts allowed them to start selling them,as this fell under the term of 'subsistence'I agree, the fishery is more valuable as a sport fishery, and the commercial guys could have their licenses bought out and they could be re-trained as guides and outfitters.But we can not do anything about the native nets!"
524887,Dan,2002-10-15 12:37:00,325,"The nets in the river a definately a problem. But I thing it not even close to the problem that the big commerical nets are.But you can do something about native nets. Get the bands on the Winnipeg Lake and River to appreciated just how valuable it is. Sportfishing and the industry around it is a huge opportunity for them. New businesses, new facilities, new infrastructure. They are selling themselves short by allowing this is happen.The locals, and others, buying walleye taken from non-commercial nets maybe the real part of that problem. They need to be educated about how it may be hurting things.There's too much that we don't know about what is really going on out there. ..."
524888,Guest,2002-10-15 12:55:00,0,natives have raped the red just like many other great fisheries.
524889,walleyedude,2002-10-15 20:21:00,34,"It is not just the Bands around the lake and river,as you suggest, but so called'urban aboriginals'that are netting the river.Most live in Winnipeg and surrounding communities and are from reserves up north.And those who buy from them? Most do not fish or fish casually,so explaining to them they are hurting the resource falls on deaf ears.They are getting 'pickeral fillets'at $2.00 a pound.And by the way, the commercial fisherman restock the lake with walleye fry every spring.They have spawn camps where walleye are netted and the eggs reared to fry and released back into the lake.The natives sure as heck do not do this!"
524890,Dan,2002-10-15 21:16:00,325,I fish Traverse Bay and its been very slow compared with the past. That's year three.I really don't think its the small nets in the river that are the real source of the problem. Its the miles and miles of commercial nets. They are blocking the run. They UTTERLY dwarf the few nets put out by native fisherman.There's an extensive array of nets out by Elk Island right now and the word is the there's alot of walleye in them.I would rather not see nets in the river either; they also impeded movement of walleye being positioned at key places along favoured travelways. But we haven't really since large numbers walleye in the Winnipeg for 3 years and there's no way nets in the river are responsible for that.Its the commercial fisherman that are the problem. I think they are really hurting the fishery. And why would they have to add walleye fry into Lake Winnipeg anyway when the whole ecosystem naturally produces spectuclar results.There are few rules and little to no monitoring of the industry; nets must be placed more than one km from the mouth of the river . Robinson rock is further than that (first rock pile).Problem: commercial fisherman are licenced / sanctioned by government. For some licences have been pssed from generation to generation. They have legitimate interests in this fishery. Problem: when money grows on trees the lower branches get picked clean first. Hence nets are laid close enough to the river mouths to block much of the fall run.Problem: walleye have to get into the rivers for winter. Its crucial but they're not getting in in the last couple of years like they should be.Problem: MNR has no time for this and the Manitoba Fish Marketing Board has a vested interest.Problem: I think I have a good idea about what's happening out there and so do some of you. But what do we really know?In the past and admittedly on occasion still this area is a great great place to fish. So its time to take this fantastic and renewable resource alot more seriously. Its time we start looking for answers. Preserving the great fishing in the Red and Winnipeg rivers is a spectacular opportunity for all communities along the rivers. Its these communities and sportfishing-folk that could really be loosing out here.Is it time to start organising? Where do we start?
524892,Guest,2002-10-16 20:15:00,0,"It starting look more and more like it's the nets that have cut the fish off from the sport fishing crowd. Consider the following:* Three poor years in a row at both the Red and Pine Falls, each worse than the previous .* Commercial fishing has strong catches out on the main lake* Comparatively, a low harvest from sport fisherman ( 1 per year over 28"" ) most visitors buy the conservation liscense. * Weather patterns have been comparable to the good years. In the past, fishing was good once they came in. It did not matter if there was a south wind, North wind or no wind. This year the water temp was between 45-50, this used to be considered perfect.* If it was the sewer spill, why has Pine Falls been off?* Same goes for the silting of the mouth of the river theoryOne possibility I heard last year was that the pics forage base has changed from shiners to a baitfish that stays out in the main lake. I would be interested in any more info on this idea.Does the Manitoba NR department have any solid ideas on what going on? I know they were doing some kind of ""shocking"" study when we were there last week.If it is the nets, we have two choices. Try to implement a change as suggested above or just fondly remember a once great fishery now gone."
524894,Guest,2002-10-17 17:18:00,0,"Folks,I have been reading a number of posts regarding angling on the Red and Winnipeg rivers this fall and I would like to pass on some observations about what has been happening to date.The fall, greenback walleye fishery is important to the province and yet, as much as we would like to know all about why this unique fishery occurs, we do not have all the answers. However, we do know that the migration of large (mostly female) walleye in the fall into these two larger rivers is partially due to fish seeking food in a pre-spawn, pre-winter feeding ""spurt"". We have also observed that the amount of activity may be related to flow levels as fisheries managers will agree, flows are an important factor in attracting fish.In looking at flow levels over the past years, it is evident that flows this year on both rivers are at, or slightly below (Red River), average and this has been the case for the past three years. If those who fished the rivers in 1999 and experienced the incredable fishery that year, I can tell you that flows were significantly higher than the average. This corolation was also made for earlier years when Master Angler registrations were compared to flow rates. This may be one of the reasons that the Winnipeg River may be more consistant than the Red as it is controlled by hydro electric dams and flows are more consistant.In addition, Lake Winnipeg has experienced a tremendous explosion of rainbow smelt over the past ten years. Walleye have responded well in terms of growth rates but this too may have affected their migratory patterns. Why move great distances for food when there is lots where you are??However, one thing has been consistant through great angling years and poorer ones. The commercial net fishery on Lake Winnipeg has been around for about 100 years. Catches on the lake over the past number of years have been good, primarily based on some strong year classes since 1995. The fishermen in the South basin primarily use 3.75"" mesh nets and target smaller walleye as prices for them are better. There is very little market, if any for larger fish and very few fishermen target these fish. Yes, they set nets out from the mouth of the rivers but have to be at least one mile out. The number of nets set at the mouth of the Red appear to be no greater than other years. This commercial fishery is very valuable to the province, generating many millions of dollars annually and employing a significant number of people.As for domestic netting, First Nations people have the constitutional right to fish for food for their own use. The Red River sees a small amount of this activity and the Winnipeg River significantly more. Nets must be marked and fish cannot be wasted. Conservation Officers regularly check nets to ensure compliance. In summary, we think that we are experiencing a near normal year based on existing flow conditions. Unfortunately these fisheries cycle and not all years can match 1999 - we wish they would for obvious reasons. We do not feel that the fishery is under undue stress and we will continue to monitor it. I hope the above has been helpful. If it is any consolation, a recent check with other major river fisheries has shown all are experiencing a slower fall. Tobin Lake in Saskatchewan, the Rainey River in Ontario, the Mississippi and the Red River at Fargo, as well as our own, are all showing the same type of results. But who knows, things may change over the next few days/weeks. Should you have any further questions, please contact me at 204-945-7811. Thanks for your time and ""space"".Carl L.

Always nice to see educated information, I was getting tired of some of the Red River banter directed at Backwater Eddy.I will though make a statement about your comment about ""no waste"". I personally watched a Lake Winnipeg fisherman cleaning out his nets just NW of Robinson's Rock Pile in Traverse Bay and watched as he ""flung"" some of the netted fish out of his boat! I'm assuming these were either ""rough"" fish or walleye that did not make the grade."

My understanding is that in 98 the harvest was 25% of the average take and 1999 and 2000 were all time records. I don't know what the numbers are for 2001. Do you have these numbers? Can you provide the reference source for this? That would be much appreciated.>The fishermen in the South basin primarily use 3.75"" mesh nets >and target smaller walleye as prices for them are better. >There is very little market, if any for larger fish and very >few fishermen target these fish.Its commonly believed in our area/ there are reports from commercial fisherman, that large walleye do get caught in 3.75 mesh nets.

Economic studies elsewhere in Canada have shown where walleye in Commercial nets bring in 1-1.5 dollars per pound walleye caught but sportfishingfolks ( and quite often released ) bring in 50-75 dollars per pound much of its going directly to the local economy. Check with NWOTA for more info (www.nwota.com)The outcome of this analysis was that the Ontario government decided to buy out all the commercial fishing licences on Lake of the Woods. Just one commercial licence remains in that area. And the walleye fishing has improved dramatically there.Lets not forget about economic growth that the communities alopng the rivers are desperating looking for. Sportfishing is not even close to reaching any sort of capacity. So $1 verus $50 then add to that huge tourism opportunities as well as ensuring economic diversity ... you get the picture.As an aside I would ask our US friends: are there any commercial fisheries on so called sportfish in your country?>As for domestic netting, First Nations people have the >constitutional right to fish for food for their own use. >The Red River sees a small amount of this activity and the >Winnipeg River significantly more.

While I don't like to see them, I dont' believe that nets in the river can explain why Walleye aren't in the river like in years past. Do you?Other posters have claimed that large-scale, all-season non-commercial nets laid by native fisherfolk are the big problem. Do you?I've spoken with several native fishing guides in our area and they are very concerned with the situation as well.Respectfully, as to conservation officers regularly checking the nets how can that be true?

Sometimes those girls cant resist those GLAMOUR shots. Glad to hear that you are catching fish. I cant feel to sorry for you guys loseing a couple of ten pounders while Im sitting in my office trying to solve customer complaints...well maybe a little sorry. Catch one for me!!!!

524903,Guest,2002-10-19 21:31:00,0,"yeah, it sounds like all the locals and guides are wrong, and this guy for 2 years has it all figured out....get real. I am not trying to be rude here, but admit it, it does sound a little condesending.I too have only fished there the last two years. We had good luck this year at Pine falls, but only a couple of big ones on the red. In one day at pf, we had 3 over 10 and 14 fish between 7-9. But the rest of the week we got blown off the bay. We fished the same week as the post above. (Oct 7-12)I think our luck was just that, luck. We hit all of those fish in one tight area for about 4 hours. The rest of the day was ""average"" in comparison to others, which was quite poor.By the way, if above mentioned poster was tired of the ""whining and complaining"" of all the other ""non catching"" fishermen, why not be a sportsman and share your knowledge with the rest of this board. If you found them in different locals with different presentation, say it. Most everyone else here is very open with what is working and what isnt...."
524904,Guest,2002-10-20 05:18:00,0,"Who isn't condescending in his/her views or comments? Take your pick, lots of that going around to choose from by the looks of things.If the fish are so scattered and not there, as you claim, why should it matter if they share the exact spots? Odds are good the fish have moved anyway.You would just produce new mega clusters of boats fishing on old locations is all? Some hit and some miss, such is fishing. Why continue to argue about that, it is dam silly to say the least."

We were there the same time as you and we got two Masters and 5 other nice fish but also caught bunchs of small Sauger. Was wondering if you would share some information.

524905,Guest,2002-10-21 11:08:00,0,"hi mike ,the fish we took early in the week were in 12ft. and as the week progressed they moved deeper to 15 -18 ft mostly i think because of the wind change and the dropping water level. 3/8 whistlers worked best for me but my partner did well on odd balls both were tipped with saltys.we found fish in several different ares but we had to be patient and work hard for the fish we caught.as for -whatevers post i am not claiming to be an expert on the red but for us it seems like if we use as many of our angling skills and keep a open mind on it we have done well.too many people go to well known areas such as the red and think catching lots of huge fish will be easy just because it is a famous area."
524906,Guest,2002-10-21 12:10:00,0,"dr888, Thanks for the update. Glad you did well. We will be going back next year and giving it our best shot. Have a good winter and be ready for a fishing spring."
524907,Guest,2002-10-23 13:58:00,0,Had a Guide tell me that he thought the biggest problem with the Red for both Walleye and Catfish was that they havent dredged out the mouth of the River for several years. Has anybody else heard that this could be contributing to the slow fishing?
524908,Guest,2002-10-23 19:23:00,0,"Kevin,I'm not sure what type of ""guide"" was telling you that the reason the Red's walleye and ""catfishery"" was suffering, was due to the lack of dredging at the mouth of the river!!! That's totally absurd!If this so called guide had been anywhere near the Red this past season, he would have (or at least should have) experienced, one of the best seasons for channels in recent memory. Maybe he guides for ""Mud Hens"", if not, maybe he should be!"

524910,Guest,2002-10-24 12:24:00,0,Sorry boys didnt mean to get you so excited. We fished Catfish for three days at the end of June and the wheather was HOT. we fished three days and caught 40 fish (4 guys) During past years we would C&R 150 to 200 per day so we thought our trip was a little slow. The Guide simply mentioned that he was concerned about the lack of dredging and thought it could have a negative effect on the fishing. I wondered if it could be contributing to slow Walleye in the fall. If the mouth of the River is silting up could that discourage the Greenbacks from coming to the party???
524911,Guest,2002-10-24 22:54:00,0,"Hey Kevin,For the record I wasn't riled, but I did want to make my point on just how fantastic the catfishing was this past season!As for the lack of dredging at the mouth of the river these past few years? Personally I don't think this lends much in the way of merit for the slow fishing patterns. Ofcoarse this is only my opinion.I personally feel that the lack of flow has prevented a lot of fish from migrating into the Red. Again this is only an opinion, unfortunately nobody really knows for sure!For those that are interested, three of us hit the water today and for the most part we managed several nice ones. The largest was a thirty incher or eleven plus pounds. We caught five other between twoand three pounds. Unfortunately we dropped three others that had some serious weight. Personally I hate dropping those big ones, I keep trying to get through too them and that I just want a picture, (they don't seem to care do they).Anyway, we caught and lost all our fish in twenty feet. We were presenting a 3/8 oz. orange jig with a 5"" white Berkley power trailersplit tail. Yes we tipped this with two salties.The water temp. is now down to a dismal 36 degrees. It won't be long before were drilling!"
524898,Guest,2002-10-18 18:01:00,0,"I would like to thank both Carl and Dan for their honest and candid feedback. Your discourse on this subject is of great interest to many.I would like to touch briefly on the economic impact of a strong sport fishery. We have a similar situation here in North and South Dakota. Our issue is the release of Missouri River water to support downstream barges vs. sport fishing. Study after study shows that the economic impact of sport fishing dwarfs that of the water transportation industry. I can speak for my individual group. We travel to the providence and stay at the hotels, eat at the dinning establishments, purchase bait, fuel, tackle and truely enjoy the Manitoba hospitality. Each group of two will spend approximatly $750.00 - $1000.00 Canadian dollars during each visit. Spread this over hundreds or thousands of boats traveling from mid September to early November and you will see the impact sport fishing can have.The $22.00 Conservation Licsense is a bargan. I would be willing to pay many times this amount if it would help sustain the fishery. My suggestion is that you take a close look at the impact of netting on this resource. If netting has a true negative impact, use our expenditures to buy out the nets. If your research shows that the forage base ( Rainbow Smelt ) is the issue, were just out of luck. Howerver, if the fishing can return to it's past glory, many fisherman from both the US and Canada will gladly pay for the opportunity to fish a ""world class"" walleye fishery. Plus, we release virtually all the fish that we catch. Thank you for your time on this issue. I'm comforted by the fact that someone is annalyzing the options.Long Term Visitor"
524899,fishcop,2002-10-19 13:03:00,11,"Hey Walleye dude, your facts are pretty accurate, as well as many others on this thread, HOWEVER, first Nation Subsistence fishermen are still only allowed to net for their own consumption, sales is illegal. If you have been approached by a individual who offers to sell you fish, it is only legal to purchase it from an licenced commercial fisherman, and then it has to be accompanied by a receipt. If a treaty offers to sell you fish, keep in mind that it is illiegal, and either call the local conservation district office, or the TIP line."
524901,Guest,2002-10-19 15:48:00,0,"I am new to the red i have only fished it the last two years so i have never seen the good old days where everyone caught lots of big fish.last year ,2001 was my first trip we fished the first week of oct. with fair results five fish over ten the largest 13.5 with plenty of smaller ones (4- 9 lbers) not alot of people caught fish that week so we heard alot of excuses and complaining. This oct 5-11 was almost identical real slow fishing for most, again lots of whining and excuses.our boat 3 people had a excellent week 9 master angler fish a 14.2 the largest with a 13 , 12.8 ,12, 11,10.8,plus numerous 5- 8 lb fish.the biggest difference between us and the no fish people were that we did not fish with the packs of boats and the spots where the fish always were in the good old days when anybody with a jig and salty or pickeral rig would clobber them.we adapted to the conditions and hunted the fish with excellent results. sorry for such a long post . but it looks like there are still some pigs left in the red ."

524900,walleyedude,2002-10-19 19:50:00,34,"I read somewhere ( the Free Press?)that there was a court case in BC that a native challenged the law regarding the term 'subsistence', that selling fish was part of native culture and thus fish are sold to 'subsist'.I believe the natives won that case.If this is correct,it won't be long before someone in Manitoba tries this in court.I really hope this does not occur!"
524891,Cat Eye Outfitter,2002-10-16 11:20:00,9,"What Can be done by concerned fishing citizens of Canada, and the U.S. about perceived difficulties to Manitoban fishing resources?Carl Wall [email protected] is an important leader/fisheries biologist of what we call in Manitoba, Manitoba ""NR"" Natural resources --Fisheries. If we could get him to speak to us about some of our concerns we might have better information. If you want to speak with someone on your own (Carl wall works at the head office) try the following... Head Office 200 Saulteaux Crescent, Winnipeg, MB R3J 3W3(204) 945-6640 Toll Free: 1-800-665-0040 Email: [email protected] Secondly I believe he'll tell you what we've all heard in Manitoba before.... Natural Resources doesn't listen so much to individuals as it listens to local wildlife groups/associations and to the provincial organization: Manitoba Wildlife Federation http://www.mwf.mb.ca/whathome.htm These groups in general haven't seen as much of an increase in their memberships in Manitoba (of course there is always the exceptional groups that are very active)to make them even more effective than they already are.. The recommendations made by these groups offer the best chance at getting some suggestions heard and some changes made. Us. citizens can express their dismay to this organization via e-mail and phone.Thirdly there is the letter writing avenue. This is an avenue where visitors to our province/ resource users can make their concerns known to the minister of Manitoba Conservation: Steve Ashton. Generally you'll receive a response to a query sent to an elected official. Perhaps if he receives enough letters of concern there might be something done about it! American citizens can tell hotel owners, guides and restaurant owners, gas stations owners about their concerns. Ultimately it is their dollars that are going to be lost to the Manitoban economy. Call the minister Honourable Steve Ashton 945-3730/3522 1 800 282 8069 ext 3730 Minister of Conservation 945-3586 FAX [email protected]"

There is none on the native fishery.Commercial fisherman have a couple of short 'windows' to fish, the natives have all year.You only see a couple of native nets on the river while you are out fishing, those of us who are on the river and out in the lake see Native nets strung out all over, all year.The problem is a lot larger than it appears, we know how much walleye are being netted by the commercial fleet.Oh, and according to Carl Wall, Manitoba Fisheries Biologist, only a small percentage of greenbacks even come in to the rivers, the majority stay out in the lake.Some years the ice fishing out of Gimli and Hnausa is better than on the Red!"
