North winds picked up in the afternoon, but that was all.Only boated 6 greenbacks (biggest 20"") and a maria fishing the first rock pile going out on the lake. (20-25ft) All on green jigs and salted minnows. Almost all the boats were jigging.Action in other boats around us was similar, one here and there, nothing fast a furious like the fellow at the boat launch claimed was the case on Friday. Heard that a few times this year at Pine Falls...""you should have seen it yesterday"".Mill Boat Launch was not slippery, but very muddy!Let's hope there is a couple of nice days ahead of us to make up for the poor year it has been.Some of the nets around Robinsons' Rock have been removed and note the port/starboard buoys have been removed from the river."
