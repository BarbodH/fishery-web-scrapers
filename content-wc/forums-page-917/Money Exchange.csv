524837,Brad,2002-10-22 23:41:00,95,Crossed at Pembina two weeks ago. To answer your question the exchange rate at the truck stop was 1.545. Well worth the convenience of about 6 cents. Let us know how you do fishing.
524838,Guest,2002-10-23 05:46:00,0,If a Canadian dollar is worth 60 cents USA....is a woman that is rated as a 6 in the USA a 10 in Canada????
524839,bigfish1965,2002-10-23 08:02:00,3210,"No, actually the other way around. Our women have 'special' abilities that we never talk about."
524840,Guest,2002-10-23 13:06:00,0,"Hey Reels.Sorry to disagree with you, but mistakes can happen....and do happen when using US currency. We all can't be as intelligent and sharp as you, not to mention a major tightwad who knows exactly, to the penny, how much cashola is in his wallet at all times. What about for our seniors, or people with sight problems, or someone that's had a little too much to drink, or someone suffering from sleep deprivation, or someone that is mentally handicapped, or someone who suffers from depression or anxiety?? I'd say the Canadian money would be easier to use for those folks rather than the US money just because using Canadian money is a complete no brainer. I went golfing three weeks ago and gave the guy in the pro shop $60 for a $50 dollar green fee....by accident he gave me $20 back instead of $10. Lucky for him I was in a good mood and told him he made a mistake. He was very grateful for my honesty and did mention how our cash all looks the same sometimes. Basically, the colored money is far more user friendly no matter what you say."
524841,bigfish1965,2002-10-23 13:25:00,3210,"OMG Reels they are sooooo gonna burn you now, man. Do up your chinstrap and keep your stick on the ice!"
524844,Wally,2002-10-23 13:44:00,38,"When we go to Canada we get a whole passel of that funny colored stuff. We like to play poker with it cause you can bet five bucks and you are really only betting three bucks so when you get raised ten bucks you really only have to put in six but you are putting in ten so you feel like you are Brett Maverick but you are really more like Scrooge Mc Duck. Hope Im not going to fast for you,EH....But I love that Canada cash...last month when I got home I gave my wife $200 canadian to buy a new outfit....she still is confused...so I saved money,EH."
524842,Reels,2002-10-23 18:13:00,2876,"I have my hands over my bunghole waiting for the reaming bigfish. Chinstrap tightened, gloves ready....Heck, I'll even buy everyone a beer who shows up in Minaki next year and says where the #### is reels...I have to admit, this post has got me laughing. Thanks for the smiles.:-)<{{}}><"
524843,bigfish1965,2002-10-23 19:31:00,3210,"I'll do it for a real ( Canadian) beer. Better have lots of it, I can prolly say it a few times."
524845,Guest,2002-10-23 21:16:00,0,"Sorry to disappoint you guys, but on the international scene, Canadian beer is looked upon as swill. It seems so good because it gets compared to American beer, which if you can beleive, is worse.Try some Stella Artois from Belgium, or Becks from Germany, or perhaps a Guinness on tap or how about a Heinekin or maybe a fine Italian Perroni, oh and what about......I could keep going but I think you get my point."

524828,Guest,2002-10-20 12:07:00,0,"Hiya Reels.....how's ya'll doin'. I's a reckon you never done finished no high school never. Nope. I's a reckon you never done heard bout no dumb funny a$$ money neither, with all those dang funny colors on them done, none, either, neither,huh??Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuiieeeeeeee!!!! Them Canadians sure is some funny kinfolk I sure do reckon. What....with all them fancy colors and such. And I done never taked kindly to strangers never neither."
524829,Ted,2002-10-21 14:05:00,87,reels don't take all this canadian pride to heart. your still laughing all the way to bank when exchange money in canada.
524831,Waliwz,2002-10-21 14:13:00,23,"Hey allI have to apologize. I was the first one to mention colored money,and I did so purly in jest. I had hoped u would all see humor in and have a laugh ...maybe lighten your day.I did not mean for it to be come a bashing event . SO I am sorry!To those who saw the humor and took no offense wheeeew I am glad some still can joke. To those it offended sorry I will try my best to be a stright laced canadian from now on!Not much luck in that .....but I will try grinWaliwzGood fishing and hunting. pass it on ...take a youngster"
524832,Rick,2002-10-21 15:32:00,226,"Here's the way I see it:I have to agree Canadian currency is better looking, more colorful, and more creative. Where else will you find beavers and loons on money? Actually, my kids think Canadian money is better than souveniers. I give them what I have left over and they think its cool. Plus it saves me a shopping stop. However, I like the fact that one US dollar is worth about a Billion Canadian. OK, so its $1.60 to $1.00, +/-. Minor details. I think this one's a draw."
524833,Guest,2002-10-22 09:06:00,0,"Both are a nice looking currency but I find the Canuck currency easier to work with. Brown-$100, Red-$50, Green-$20, Purple-$10, Blue-$5.....it's impossible to give out the wrong amount, and no doubling checking needed when getting back change. The US cash all looks the same and making a mistake is easy."
524834,Reels,2002-10-22 14:44:00,2876,"Holy Smokes, what a sensative bunch. Good thing I didn't mention the ugly women....Relax guys and gals. As far as someone making a mistake about the money, well, I guess that is why we have schools, so we can read. I never had anyone give me a $100 for $1 or any other bill for that matter.My point is no one was making fun of Canadians. Just the French ones... I'm kidding again, dont get your underwear in a knot!Relax and have a beer.<{{}}><"
524830,Reels,2002-10-22 14:48:00,2876,What the ##### are you smoking??<{{}}><
524835,bigfish1965,2002-10-22 14:52:00,3210,Our money is coloured for a reason. We have ALCOHOL in our beer. A six pack of Labatts Ice and you'll be tippin the pretty ballerina with hundreds if they wasn't coloured so pretty...He he
524836,Reels,2002-10-22 19:29:00,2876,"I agree bigfish-you kanucks do have the best beer, and no, the woman are not ugly... I was just goofing around...I do find it amazing that people have thin skin about this. It was not meant to offend anyone. Sorry if it did.Tight Lines,<{{}}><"
524817,REELMAN,2002-10-08 19:01:00,1624,heading up north in a week. will be crossing at Pembina N.D. I called my bank today and the exchange rate was 1=.601How is this compared to exchanging money at a gas station in Pembina?
524818,Guest,2002-10-08 19:35:00,0,"I have always done best going to a Credit union or Bank just over the border in Canada and changing there instead of the US side.. Especially in a smaller town.Hehehe...on the other hand...in Regina one large Bank of Montreal told me they ""did not want my American money""...(oh well...a small Credit Union across the street did!)."
524819,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-10-11 12:34:00,618,"When we go north, we buy all of the gas with the credit card. The gas station is paid in Canadian funds. The credit card company uses the exact exchange rate of the day of purchase to bill you in US funds. All of the places that exchange money will take or charge a couple percent. This is reasonable and what they do for a living. I have seen some of the gas stations that were fair, some that gave 20% when the exchange was 48%, and some that told me that there is no exchange rate at their station. When we go, we chose one person to buy all of the gas on the card. When the bill comes we split the cost. Rich"
524820,Trailerguy,2002-10-11 19:17:00,1407,"I always take the time to stop at a Royal Bank of Canada, they have branches in most towns,then you get the rate of the day."
524821,GrandPops,2002-10-12 06:19:00,31,My inlaws got a summer place on LOTW when they retired. They setup a checking and savings account at a local credit union and when the exchange rate is high they put money into the savings. Whenever any of us go up there fishing we put all but personal things on the resort account and then pay the inlaws our share of the bill. Get the best exchange without having to worry about what the days exchange is. Also by having a savings account there the CU gets the investment ops just like a US bank.Works good for us.Keep Your Rod Bent !!GrandPops
524822,Waliwz,2002-10-12 12:42:00,23,Hey allAs a personal good dead !! I will be willing to trade u all the canadian money u want dollar for dollar ! For your boring one color american money! In exchange I will give u our very colorful canadina dollar ...I know U must be wondering why I would be willing to do such a thing ...but hey I am just a nice guy!:)Good fishing and hunting. pass it on ...take a youngster
524823,Guest,2002-10-13 13:48:00,0,i would suggest just using your bank card. you get that days rates and don't have to worry about how much cash to bring.
524824,Reels,2002-10-17 13:04:00,2876,"I agree with the credit card, best rates that are current, and your not stuck with funny looking money.<{{}}><"
524825,Guest,2002-10-20 06:41:00,0,Around the world most money is colorful except of cource the money in the U.S. Who's the oddball now smarty pants.Bar-goers in your country must go broke giving away 100's for 1's in the dim light.
524826,retire55,2002-10-20 07:46:00,1029,"Reels:Your comment regarding Canada's ""funny looking money"" is offensive and demonstrates disrespect. More importantly, I'm concerned that your disrespect probably extends to our fishing regulations as well. Consequently, just fish somewhere else!"
