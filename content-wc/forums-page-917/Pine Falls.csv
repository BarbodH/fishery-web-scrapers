525185,eyewitness,2002-10-25 08:45:00,680,"Speaking of pics....when do we get to see the piggies that you fellas CPRed this trip? I did see some pics from the Vanity Cup. Man did it look miserable! I experienced that last Oct. up at the NW Angle on LOW and don't want to do it again anytime soon. We had 8"" of snow, temps down to 13 deg. at night, highs around 25-30 with blowing snow, and frozen boats. Yee Haw! Where would you recommend staying on the river up there at Pine Falls? If you could drop me an email with any suggestions and possibly a phone # I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks again for the info."
525190,Guest,2002-10-25 09:30:00,0,"Todd,Nice post. I am still recovering from the trip. My boat is finally unthawed and trying to dry out in time for the trip to MI this weekend. Congrats on your big fish this year. We had two good fish this year. A 31"" a rookie caught from Dallas on his 2nd trip up there and I found a 28"" that was hungry.Glad to finally meet the big guy from NE. I'm sure we'll see ya up there in future years. What a great group of guys with an even greater attitude towards everything in general.take care,Jason"
525186,Todd_NE,2002-10-25 09:39:00,1330,"I sent you an email.It will be a week or two, need to get film developed and scanned. I'll get em up though. I've got to get that film back from Kansas remember... :)TYup, got her... feel that head shake!"
525191,Todd_NE,2002-10-25 09:45:00,1330,"We booked from Oct 13-18 next year. Hope we can meet up. That was neat you guys flew and drove in from about everywhere to meet and fish.Appreciated the heads up on the jigging. You won't believe it, but after you guys left there was usually 7-10 boats on the WHOLE bay. It totally cleared out.Our group and Dogfish's meeting up, sharing a joke, some fishing insights, and having fun are what Walleye Central is all about !!!I think the Manitou thought a football team was staying at there place with our group, I wasn't even the biggest guy :) Thank god for the big & tall walleye camo outlets.ToddYup, got her... feel that head shake!"

525192,Guest,2002-10-29 07:07:00,0,"Todd,I will be up there and fishing Oct 12-18 in 2003. Am looking forward to seeing the clan from NE. I can follow your boat around the bay and pick up the stragglers that you miss on your secret lures. ha ha A couple of the guys want to spend a few days duck and goose hunting, so maybe we will be eating duck caboobs and walleye one night.Fishing in MI was very slow. The weather was great though and was very scenic this time of year.take care,Jason"

525180,eyewitness,2002-10-24 15:20:00,680,I know how that little brother thing goes....I put him on fish and then he once in a while he gets lucky...x( Hey thanks for the insight...I think I'll give them a fair shake up at LOW and the Rainy River.
525188,Guest,2002-10-24 17:54:00,0,"Even though I haven't made it in the 10# club yet, the last two years going to Pine Falls has been great. Thanks to Todd, Rhett and the other guys just seeing the hogs that were pulled in was amazing. Beside's a tumble!! and a lower unit going out, Going to Pine Falls with the NE crew is a blast."
525173,Backwater Eddy,2002-10-24 18:23:00,3871,"As far as what may be the big shift up their Todd, I'll lay odds on it being forage related.By the looks of the health of the catfish there is no shortage of food. I personally suspect the walleye may be shifting to lake based forage more and more, becoming smelt gobblers. If the smelt are booming like the reports are indicating they may not need to make river runs in the fall to get fattened up for winter? Who really knows?Year class's may be getting hit hard by the nets too, no hard data = no hard proof? I wish they would do a serious independent study on the whole system.Backwater Eddy...><sUMo>Backwater Guiding""Ed on the RED"""
525174,Todd_NE,2002-10-24 18:37:00,1330,"Ed,I suspect the same thing is going on but do not realllly know. I do know that the fish we caught were in incredible shape. I remember one fish in particular that was 24.5"" and weighed 6.3 - wow. Yet, the fish we cleaned didn't have much forage in them, an occasional winnipeg shiner.There is also a lot more pressure on those fish and more fisherman all the time. Heck, just between me and a friend we have probably infuluenced 30-40 guys going up there now that didn't three or four years ago and that stuff is exponential because of word of mouth. I've met people up there who go because they've read stuff here and guys who've met guys who've met guys who had heard about a trip up there. It's incredible.This sounds like sacrilege to some, but I'd support a study of fishing and helping the papermill improve the ramp facility.One interesting thing is that there seems to be two types of walleyes at Pine Falls. One tends to be short and heavy that fights ""ok"" and another that is longer and thinner, more ""athletic"" looking that fights like the devil. I'm not a biologist that trusts my ability to ""sex"" fish but I wonder if it's different sexes, different genetics, different predominate habitat (river vs. lake for home range) or forage preference???Maybe Lurker can fill us in on all that.ToddYup, got her... feel that head shake!"
525175,Backwater Eddy,2002-10-25 04:57:00,3871,"The leaner & meaner fish may be more river-oriented walleye and the sumo stubby is more the lake roamer? I think river eyes fight way more then lake roamers, just my personal opinion. Many guys who fish catfish say river cats fight way more and harder then lake cats, maybe this is true with walleye too?Backwater Eddy...><sUMo>Backwater Guiding""Ed on the RED"""
525181,Jim,2002-10-25 07:50:00,238,"Todd: Way to go, I am glad to see that somebody knows how to catch Greenbacks in a tough year. I was looking on the reelbait site, would you recommend short or long shank - or both?Regards, Jim"
525182,Todd_NE,2002-10-25 08:25:00,1330,"I like the long shank jigs for adding plastic trailers, hooking larger minnows, and elongating a presentation. The bait also undulates a little different because of the longer hook than on a shorter hook.The short shank jigs are great for a ""compact"" presentation. I also prefer them for casting most of the time. The thing to watch on short shank jigs is whether the hook is in a good position for hookset, some short shank jigs are a problem.I really don't have a preference until the fish tell me what they like, I believe both worked equally well up north this year, though the fish up there seemed to like the larger shiners so to me the additional hook length was a plus because it made the bait a little bigger/longer lookingI do bend any jig hook slighly up and out for a better hookset, this is even more important on short shank jigs in my opinion.Bottomline, it depends on the day sometimes for whatever reason.Yup, got her... feel that head shake!"
525183,eyewitness,2002-10-25 08:25:00,680,"Todd, just ordered $60, yep $60 worth of those flashers. Nice looking jigs, especially the fact that they double as stand up jigs. I can't wait to try them. Thanks!"
525189,Todd_NE,2002-10-25 08:28:00,1330,"Gene,You'll get your 10!!! I remember meeting a guy on the Red a few years ago that was the ""last one left"" to get a big fish out of his group and had taken some ribbing.When he did get his big fish it was a 15 and everyone shut up... :)Wish you and Mark could have stayed a few more days.. ya just never know up there. You guys do a great job and pitch in like crazy, plus you have to put up w/me when I'm in overdrive....TYup, got her... feel that head shake!"
525166,Todd_NE,2002-10-24 12:34:00,1330,"Thought I'd report on our trip.We had a decent year at Pine Falls considering the Siberian weather and initial fishing pressure from the CWC tourney. The weather followed us back to Nebraska, I have not seen a temp above freezing in 8 days now. We fished through blizzards, frozen motors, frozen steering, disabled electric motors, one lost lower unit (not my boat :) ), snoring, etc. Most of my boat lids have been frozen shut for a week.Our big fish were two 12's, three 11's, and quite a few above 8. We caught and released the hogs. My brother Troy from Kansas put on quite a display, all but two of the big fish were his, including both 12's. He caught all of his fish on Reelbait Walleye Flasher 3/8 oz jigs - he put on a clinic. That extra bit of flash and vibration seemed to be the difference, and of course his touch. He's a masterful crappie jigger and those fish bit just about like a 6"" crappie, it wasn't a pronounced take 99% of the time, just a slightly lighter or heavier feeling jig. An #11.7 fish was caught by Justin Lauby, a good young fisherman from Lexington NE, on a Ripstik. The other big fish (11+) was caught by Gary Rash of Kansas. Everyone on the trip caught at least a 25/26"" fish but certainly the fishing wasn't like it has been in years past for numbers or size. While we were there the water dropped from 45 to 41 degrees according to my boat, others reported similar. At least three guys on the trip set personal bests. I think it was just setting up to get good then the weather plummeted too far too fast.We didn't find much of a trolling bite other than the first day when we did pretty well. Other than the first day, jigging was the order of the day anywhere from 12-18'. Thanks to WI_Dogfish for the tips up there and nice conversation. Nice group of guys. Appreciate the email Curt.One gentleman who claimed to have fished Pine Falls for 40 years at least a few times a week claimed this was the worst year ever for him, and last year was the worst before that. I will tell you, that the bar is pretty high up there though for fishing. We'll be back!Sorry we didn't make it in to Winnipeg Rob, we fished hard and didn't make it.By the way, I take that stuff back about live minnows doing better at Pine. Salties definitely were better this year.I'll get up a few pics when I get the chance.Yup, got her... feel that head shake!"
525167,Walleye Wacker,2002-10-24 12:55:00,6,Dont understand why you are so surprised that a couple of boys from Kansas would lay a fish whipping on the rest of you. Us Kansas boys have some soft touchs on them jigs and we can set a hook with the best of them....yup...Kansas is the home of the GREAT AMERCIAN FISHERMEN.

525169,Todd_NE,2002-10-24 13:30:00,1330,"Uhhhh.... I'm from Kansas. Just live in Nebraska now. Besides, I've had two 14+ fish come in over the gunnels of my boat :)I know this is in humor, but I'm happy for people, especially my brother when he catches big fish. He's just gotten into walleye fishing the past few years and I know he's a lifelong walleye fisherman after this trip.That rah rah stuff about people on trips getting upset over others catching fish is stupid. Everyone should be out to help everyone when it comes to fishing!"
525170,Walleye Wacker,2002-10-24 13:40:00,6,Nice response Todd NE...Did you net those 14 pounders for those Kansas residents?? Glad to hear that you got your brother hooked on Walleye fishing...its the only way to go. Where in Kansas does your Brother live?

525176,Todd_NE,2002-10-24 13:50:00,1330,"One was netted for me and I netted the other after I handed the rod to someone else to fight. It was the second walleye he ever caught.My brother splits his time between Garden City and Cedar Bluffs. He has the big black 2025 running around up there with Walleye Flashers on all his jigging rods.I can't believe I told you guys what he/we caught those on :)Yup, got her... feel that head shake!"
525172,Todd_NE,2002-10-24 14:02:00,1330,"This coming from a guy with 15+ fish..... You have more BIG fish from up there than the rest of us combined.Seriously Ed, it felt like a tough trip to us while we were there at times just because of the cold and periods of no bites but then you start adding up the big fish (at least my brother's :) ) and it looks pretty good. It was spotty fishing with small spurts and then BOOM - HOG CITY.The funny thing is three years ago we caught everything from 6""-31"", then last year we couldn't find much from 20-26"", now this year we didn't see much from 10-14 or 20-24"". I don't know what to say about the condition of the fishery. I know the locals I talked too seem to believe it's in decline, I never found one person that said otherwise - YET the fishing is still unbelievable to me.Troy did put a whipping on those fish and we caught a lot of nice 25-26"" fish for everyone. I started with a regular Reelbait jig with a piece of contrasting color powerbait and did ok but Troy choosing that Walleye Flasher was the king, it was sickening watching him dance his dance on the front of that boat :)I think Troy had the lightest touch and really keyed in on keeping that jig on the bottom, plus he got some confidence going which is the key for every jigger/fisherman. I'll admit I've gotten fond of the trolling up there and got some nice jigging fish too, but I stand there jigging thinking I should be pulling cranks when all of a sudden you feel the lightest tick through your goose hunting gloves and it's too late. You only get one or two of those big fish checking you out in a day under the conditions we fished in.I tell everyone that going to the Red or Winnipeg is like trophy deer hunting, don't focus on numbers of fish. Think of your lifetime trophy under the boat and fish like that.We could of used another hot hand buddy!Yup, got her... feel that head shake!"
525177,eyewitness,2002-10-24 14:34:00,680,"So where does one attain such ""walleye flashers""? Minnesota boy here and haven't used one before...Are they like the Roadrunner jigs with the blade on the back? Come on now....please let the cat out of the bag...."
525178,Todd_NE,2002-10-24 14:54:00,1330,"You can get them at www.reelbait.com We also caught a few on their prop and reg jigs but the flasher ruled. We caught them on lots of different colors though Orange and Glow seemed to be best. Al Patterson who owns Reelbait says Rich Mellon thinks they are the hottest ice jig going too, I haven't tried them for that yet. Us fat guys generally avoid Nebraska ice unless we're on a 3' deep lake.I would mention that 1/4 or 3/8 oz seemed to be about right. Troy was using 2 or 3 salties at a time (the turkey didn't mention that to me until the last day) I think one of the keys is that the blade puts out just enough vibration to bring in curious fish and make them bite better in that reallly discolored water. Again though, whatever it was Troy was doing (trust me, we were all watching him as we jigged at times) was just better.Todd_NE (I am on their pro staff, but to be honest I almost didn't tell anyone about this, it was the real deal up there and sometimes its hard to tell people a good thing even if you're on someone's staff. Plus, if you then say you are on the pro staff some say Ah Hah! I guess those of you that know me know how important my word is, besides pics and video don't lie @$#^#*&^(@#$%@# hehehe Dang little brothers! Who wants to say their little brother beat 'em like a drum?)Yup, got her... feel that head shake!"
