524723,NateW,2002-10-21 19:09:00,96,"We've stayed at Scout Lake Resort twice in the last three years and are already booked for a trip there in 2003.As mentioned elswhere the cabins are average, but how much time are you going to spend in the cabin anyway? Scout Lake can be good for Walleyes and when the weather is nasty on the big lake, at least smaller Scout Lake is still fishable.It's the camp closest to Broad lake, MacKenzie Bay and other good spots, plus it's right next to Bay of Islands which is where we caught most of our big walleyes last July.I definately recommend staying there. f you have any questions, e-mail me: [email protected]."
524724,NateW,2002-10-21 19:30:00,96,"Oh..and about the water thing...three years ago we were told (not by the folks at camp but by others who had just returned from Lac Seul) that many of the older camps don't have very good wells and that we should bring our own drinking water. We brought several gallon jugs and drank that but used tap water for cooking, coffee etc. Kinda funny, the coffee always tasted good, except that one morning we used the bottled spring water and then the coffee tasted really flat. Don't know why...sometimes you're better-off just shutting up and drinking your cofffee!HEY MP....I'll buy the place and hire you as a guide! Deal?? That reminds me...you hold up your end of the bargain on that new boat you got a year ago? heh-heh-heh"
524725,Guest,2002-10-22 18:12:00,0,"Nate!!!!!!!How's it going???You got a deal concerning the offer of being a guide/camp handyman.I'd pack my bags yesterday to be able to do something like that.Wouldn't it be terrible to have to wake up every morning and have to go fish??!! Let me know when!As for my part of the deal.... still waitin to go for a ride!Glad I have possession of the boat!! My guess is I came out WAY ahead on this deal. Knowing her, she will come up with plan ""B"" to get something in return. Know she has been eyeballin a Toyota MR2....Cheaper that the alternative!!Just waitin till June!MP"
524726,NateW,2002-10-24 18:21:00,96,"Cheaper than the alternative, yes! But not nearly as much fun in acquiring!!!Dates for our group in 2003, July 12 - 18..how about you?"
524727,Guest,2002-10-27 20:50:00,0,"Be up June 7-21. Can't wait...Boy, it's going to be a looooooooooooooooong winter! 7 months & 2 weeks to go!!!!!!"
524712,Guest,2002-10-04 15:53:00,0,"my group has been going to lac seul for about 6 years. we always stay in the ear falls lodges and have been very satisfied. each year we find ourselves fishing further and further down the lake toward mckenzie bay. needless to say, we are spending a lot of time on travel that we could be fishing. i have visited scout lake lodge's web site and find their rates to be competetive. have any of you had experience with these folks and the fishing nearby? does scout lake itself hold walleye during the summer months or do you have to run out to the big water? thanking you all in advance."
524713,the badger,2002-10-06 20:12:00,0,"Whit; I have fished LS five or six times and was at Scout Lake this August for the first time.I found the camp to be about average as compared to others.Cabins were clean but nothing special.We used their boats and motors and were happy with them,40 hp mercs and seventeen foot lunds.One nice thing about the camp is that it is located on smaller Scout Lake so if you have a windy day you can still get out to fish.We had such nice weather we never spent any time fishing Scout so I can't say how the fishing is.Other people at camp came in with some nice northern pike from Scout. The owners seemed nice enough but one thing that I didn't like was Rolands reluctance to give any info on fishing spots or what was currently happening on the lake .Maybe he is too tired at the end of the day to make any effort to gather information for his customers.We went on our own and stil managed 225 walleyes for the week.I think the prices were comparable to other camps in the area and probably would go back to Scout Lake again.The camp is in a good location on the lake with reasonable distance from some prime fishingareas on the lake."
524714,Guest,2002-10-07 09:55:00,0,"thanks badger. if you had nice weather, it must have been the later part of august. from fishing reports i have read, it was a pretty tough bite period for walleye. at least for the big ones. so you must have done pretty well. how long does it take to get out to the main lake? looks like about 15-20 minutes on the map. do you know whether scout lake is a spawning area for walleye? if so, they probably would have migrated out to deeper water by august. my map shows some 20 and 40 foot areas, but that the lake is really pretty shallow for the most part. thanks again. whit"
524715,Guest,2002-10-07 18:54:00,0,"Three of us first timers spent the third week of may at Scout Lake resortthis past summer. There was virtually no walleye action to be had in scout lake. We had quite a boat ride to Broad, sunlinght and a few other spots where we caught a tremendous number of fish, and a few really nice ones to boot. Caught a few northerns in Scout Lake but caught many more in Mckenzie bay and then way down to the south inlet, caught a dandy smallmouth down there too. Hired a guide one day..He said Scout Lake was very good later in the summer after the 2nd or third week of June..According to him most of the fish (walleye) migrate out of scout lake to spawn..I could believe him we stayed on Scout on a windy day and worked our butts off for a couple of walleye and a bunch of norhterns. The cabins were clean, but nothing fancy as the other post mentioned. Roland is nice but definitely not a hot spot kind of guy. Liz was very nice and I would go there again, but unless you get a 17' lund with a 40hp take your own boat. We ended up with a 16' and a 25 and it just ain't enough...26 miles one way to broad and that was a looooong trip. Caught a ton of fish and a few 29"" class over the course of the week, but it's a looooong ride. Thought I was going to leave a rich widow behind the 2nd trip back to scout lake..The waves were BIG...Caught a 41"" northern on the next to last day down around the south inlet. The scenery of that area alone was worth the trip. Just beautiful. If we go back next summer I'm taking a belly boat along and I'm going to hike to the lake that the south inlet flows in from..It's a fly in only proposition and should be good. It was our first trip to canada and our first walleye trip and it went very well. If you're an expereinced fisherman just looking for a convenient place to stay you should do well staying at Scout Lake. I wouldn't bother to hire a guide again, just take a bunch of 1/4 oz jig heads with you and follow the stream of boats out of camp each morning heading to Broad lake..Good luck..."
524716,Guest,2002-10-07 19:37:00,0,I second the trip to Broad lake cause this year it WAS the hot spot to be the 3rd and 4th week in May! Would also recommend floating jig heads... we cast then with split shot towards shore and dragged them back slowly and WHAMMMMO the eyes would hit hard! We didn't do that great with lead heads in Broad>most of the eyes were up in shallower water. Was a whole lotta fun settin the hook!In the 2 weeks I was up-hit Broad about 6 times...it is a long boat ride from Ear Falls>45 min. in my own boat. Can't imagine doing it with a 25-40hp! Already droolin for more...Only 8 more months to go!!!!!!
524717,Jesse-WI,2002-10-09 17:15:00,534,We were there 3 years ago in early July. Our cabin was very nice. They had problems with their water system the whole week. We had several long periods with no water. They were puting in a new one as we left but it did not do us any good. The only other problem we encountered was a minor disagreement on the gas provided when you bring your own boat. They were strict on the X gallons of gas per boat. They would not let you put the free gas in the wrong boat. (i.e. share).The fishing in the local lakes was fairly decent. The water was high that year. The flooded weeds had a large supply of slot walleyes and 26-30 inch northerns. The fish were very shallow.The places they marked on the maps were a nice long drive.
524718,Guest,2002-10-10 08:31:00,0,"I have been there on 2 occasions, once at the camp and once at their outpost in Mckenzy bay. The cabins are clean and comfortable, and very basic, this is not a luxury resort, it is for people who come to fish. People are nice, Rolley is a real character, but as said fishing tips from him are a waste of time. It met out need fine, never fished broad, but heard it is good. Scout lake is ok for walleye, they fish them by the 1st island from camp. That end of the lake is good, but lots of northern. Never ran into many big fish in this area(1 10 and a few 6-7's) We now go out of macquawa(spelling?) This is a basic camp too, but is really a nice area, and for us the fish weight is much bigger 5lb averages some days. It can be hard to find the eater sized walleye though, they are all too big! We have daily contests with out group of 3 boats and comming in at night with a 9 will deffinitely not assure big fish of the day money."
524719,the badger,2002-10-10 09:26:00,0,"Whit;Yes, we were there the last week in Aug.Just about all of our walleyes were under the slot. A few in the slot and none over the slot.Nobody could figure where the mid-size fish went in Aug.Lots of pike caught also while trolling for eyes.One other thing about the camp is that they recommended that you boil the tap water before drinking it,I am sure it is lake water and not from a well.It does not take long to get to the main part of the lake ,the channel leading to the lake is 10-15 ft. of water with no hazards that we could see.Like one other post said,Scout Lake camp is a fishing camp and not a luxury experience.As long as the fishing is good,the toilet flushes,the showers are hot, and the fridge keeps your beer cold what more could you want."
524720,Guest,2002-10-10 13:20:00,0,"badger, you got that last part right. surely they must have a well. i know it's the canadian backwoods, but that can't be legal. can it? i also was doing a little research and see that the lodge is for sale. don't know how that might influence the service. whit"
524721,Guest,2002-10-10 20:10:00,0,Where did you find this info about the resort being for sale?Did a real estate search and came up w/nutin??Just curious what a fishing resort would run???
