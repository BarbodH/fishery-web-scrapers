524963,b8y,2002-10-17 13:49:00,7,"Hey river eye, I am curious as to how you found the fishing up the river this year. Have you found a change in the average size of walleyes since the slot was put in place for that area A. I am specifically interested in the river portion and not side lakes like Crowduck. I read an article in the paper that said little echo is becoming a productive crappie fishery. Can you confirm that? Also, have you ever seen any muskie caught in the river? Thanks."
524964,River_eye,2002-10-17 15:39:00,1486,"As a matter of fact I have noticed bigger walleyes on the river this year, as well as last year. But it also seems like the fishing spots are more size specific. I fished spots this summer where they were all between 12-14"" and others where they're mostly above 16"". I don't know whether it's because I'm just getting more experienced on the waters or because there is a change.the size difference is noticed the most in the giant bay we call green lake which stradles the Ont./Mb. border, where crowduck pours in. For every 4 fish caught, 1 is below 16"" if you're lucky, while it's a little easier to find the smaller ones on the river, in certain spots of course.Little Echo lake houses some great early spring fishing for walleye, then shuts off, then produces monster Smallmouth, then shuts off about the beginning of July. Mediocre pike action all year, but generally not worth the trip. The lake is max 17 ft deep, and houses a few moster walleye. my guest caught a 28 3/4 in. last spring, and I found a 31"" floating this sping (hopefully died of old age). The lakes' patterns depend mostly on water levels.Have not seen evidence of great crappie fishing there, maybe bullhead.I actually have never targeted them and I don't know how to tell the difference between one and a rock bass, so can't help you on that one.Where are you from? do you fish the area often?"
524965,River_eye,2002-10-17 15:41:00,1486,"I have never seen musky, but I wouldn't sh*t my pants if I did see one, because reliable sources tell me you can catch them up river in Ontario near whitedog,"
524966,b8y,2002-10-17 18:47:00,7,"I do not fish up there as much as I would like. I was up for 4 days twice this year. I am hoping to go up more often next year. My father and uncle own one of the cabins on cabin cut. They are from the Selkirk area. Before they bought the cabin in the mid 60s, we used to go up and camp by boundary, when I was about 6. After they bought the cabin, we hardly ever made it past the lodge. Occasionaly we fish the fast water, but mostly we stay fairly close to the cabin. The truth is we hardly ever have to go far to catch a variety and the boat is generally too loaded to haul up much extra gas.I asked about the crappie as I started taking the girlfriend up and she wants to catch a variety. I figured to kill 2 birds with one stone and try up there, rather than working the creeks like muckles and wavey(north of selkirk). We have caught crappie in the past and yes rock bass up there, but without a specific pattern. ie incidental catches. Musky, now that is the question. About 5 years ago my father caught a fish which was either a muskie or the wildest colour variation I have seen on a jack. If it happens again I will count the pores underneath, and take a picture. I also have seen an apparent increase in size. Some people think it is too soon to be a result of the new slot. I do not know what it is, but if it is a result, then I wouldn't mind if this temporary slot became permanent. This year we really didn't mind throwing back 24, 25, and 26 inch pics. They would of gone back anyway but its nice to see when everyone has to follow the same practice. IMHO I wouldn't mind seeing the bottom bumped up a bit, but anything over 20 should go back anyway. The times really have changed."
524967,River_eye,2002-10-18 16:32:00,1486,"Which cabin is yours, the North one(island) or the south one(mainland). I never even knew the North one was there until two years ago. It's very well hidden."
524968,b8y,2002-10-19 13:50:00,7,"The island, up the hill. A lot of people do not realize it is there, unless they see boats, which has been less and less as the years go by. When they bought the cabin, my grandfather told one of the original owners that they could still use it, when they wanted. That partys composition has changed, but they still use it on a yearly basis. The truth is some years, they have used it more than the owners. As I mentioned, in the 60s we used to go up to boundary. One day my father saw an ad in the free press for a cabin for sale on the upper part of the river. He called my uncle and grandfather and they headed down to the states and bought the place sight unseen on the same day. They did not know it was there either, but as my father says, it was the best buy he ever made.I have decided to break down and buy a new outfit for next year. If or when I do, maybe we will see you up there, as I will have to make at least 4 or 5 trips up there to justify the expenditure.For me fishing on the red, spring summer and fall has been just too convenient. I just throw my 12' shell on the truck and go home whenever the kids annoy me too much. That really is not an option up the river. My other boat has reached the point of diminishing returns as the repair bills are escalating and after I paid over a k this year to get it fixed, it is still a piece of crap.Anyway time to get off the net and head off to work in selkirk. Later."
524969,River_eye,2002-10-21 16:57:00,1486,Maybe it was you that signalled us at night as we were going through cabin cut one night to go party.
524970,b8y,2002-10-24 23:23:00,7,"Yes that was us, but we were not trying to signal. We go down to the rocks at night with the kids to look for crayfish and look at the stars and whatever else. I was kind of amused, as during that period, I have never seen so many boats out after dark since they put the road into whitedog. I posted 3 pics under timeout on alt.binaries.pictures.fishing of 3 varieties we caught anchored at the same spot on the east side of the island. As usual the camera got left on shore when the biggest fish were caught. Those pictures show why we do not have to venture too far away. It is south of the campsite in the necked down area. Sorry the pictures are so large but I haven't quite got the scanner down pat."
524971,River_eye,2002-10-25 12:21:00,1486,"I'd like to see the pictures but I don't know where they are, that's not a web address is it?"
524972,b8y,2002-10-25 13:19:00,7,"usenet I believe. It is a newsgroup that I can access through outlook express. ISPs provide them. My provider strips them pretty quick for some reason,probably something to do with the storage capacity of their server. Sorry I can't be more help on how to access it and I really don't know where else to post it so you can find it."
