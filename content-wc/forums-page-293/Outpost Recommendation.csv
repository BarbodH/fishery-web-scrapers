3584554,pinecone,2015-02-25 19:01:00,3,"Searching for a fly in Canadian fishing service can be confusing. This will be the first fishing experience in Canada. I know everyone has their opinions, but looking for a recommendation with the following criteria:1. Somewhere based in Ontario, within a hour or so of Int. Falls.2. Scenic and solitude. Wildlife opportunities would be nice.3. Accommodations not too rough(don't need luxury). Sleeps up to six.4. On a lake with good fishability. Not too big. Access to moving water or portage lakes a plus.5. Good number of walleye. Option to go after at least 2 out of 3 of the following: big pike, smallmouth, and Trout (in that order)6. Price less than 1300 usd per person(I know prices can depend on group size)Thanks in advance for you thoughts"

I've never used them, but they are on the 2nd or 3rd generation running this operation so they have to be doing it right. I don't know where you live, but if you're in the Minneapolis area visit the NW Sportshow in late March. Lots of flyin services and resorts working the show."

3586730,KSjim,2015-02-26 09:53:00,88,"The outpost on Maynard Lake would be worth taking a look at. They fly out of Kenora. Maynard Lake is on the English River system. Very good fishing for walleye, pike, and smallmouth. Excellent portage lake for smallmouth.There is a lodge on the lake, so there will be some boat traffic, but it is ran by the same people that own the outpost. This makes it nice when you run out of minnows, beer,ice, etc. Makes the planning, especially for first timers, a lot easier. You can also hire a guide for a day or two if needed.www.maynardlake.com"
