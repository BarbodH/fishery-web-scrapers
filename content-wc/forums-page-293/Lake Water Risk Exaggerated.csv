3577970,F250,2015-02-24 05:09:00,75,"I have contracted giardia twice. Once after drinking water from a lake in northern Quebec, and once after hunting in marshes in Saskatchewan and not being careful about cleaning/drying my hands before consuming snacks. Lab tests confirmed giardia. Giardia cases must be reported to the CDC in the USA even if you contract the illness in another country. It was no fun either time. I am now very careful. We treat all our water on fishing/hunting/camping trips."
3579010,NathanH,2015-02-24 10:34:00,697,Reminds of a story my father in-law tells about going to the BWCA and having a fellow camper ask why bother to filter the water and as that guy reached down to fill up his cup a huge moose crap floated past. He was a big filter and boil guy after that.
3580778,stillangling,2015-02-24 19:34:00,149,"That does sound like a story alright. Moose have very loose stool in the summer once their diet shifts to aquatic vegetation and leaves so I can't imagine that anyone would see a moose turd floating by when they were in a boat...but don't let that get in the way of a good anecdote. Think of a juicy cow paddy and that is about what they drop in the summer. The ""pellets"" that most people associate with moose are typical when they shift to browse. By the way, distrust anything your father-in-law tells you, regardless of the topic!"
3589930,Baseline,2015-02-26 21:45:00,3207,Everything is great with lake water until its not and you or someone gets sick or parasites in the digestive tract some of which can have long lasting consequences. It is easy to boil water and/or run it through a filter. Why take the chance.
3590042,roscoe33,2015-02-26 23:59:00,653,"You might want to check out the flora that is supposed to be in your GI tract. Either something is lacking, or your diet is out of whack. Either way, blaming your growling GI on an infection from years ago, doesn't make sense. Many many thousands of people get these infections every year, with no lasting effects. I have had giardia, from a pool, and crypto, contracted from a municipal water supply. While people around me were dropping like flies, I was able to continue my work and school schedules, with very little interuption."
3592090,MrSimon,2015-02-27 11:29:00,922,"You might want to read this link:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3870550/ Here is an excerpt:Quote: Giardiasis can present with a broad range of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic, to acute or chronic diarrheal disease associated with abdominal pain and nausea. Most infections are self-limiting, although re-infection and chronic infection can occur. Recent evidence indicating that Giardia may cause chronic post-infectious gastrointestinal complications have made it a topic of intense research. The causes of the post-infectious clinical manifestations due to Giardia, even after complete elimination of the parasite, remain obscure. This review offers a state-of-the-art discussion on the long-term consequences of Giardia infections, from extra-intestinal manifestations, growth and cognitive deficiencies, to post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome."

3566874,stillangling,2015-02-21 07:12:00,149,"I realize that this started on another thread but it seems as though once these things run into 2 pages any rational thought gets lost in the din. The risk of contracting giardiasis from lake water is minimal. That is based upon science as opposed to anecdotal observations of fellow anglers.http://www.ncbi.lm.nih.gov/pubmed/10737847http://www.lightandmatter.com/article/hiking_water.htmlI drink lake water all the time and I live up here. Gross as it sounds, if you are getting sick on your fishing trip it can probably be blamed on one of your companions not washing their hands and doing food prep (see attached papers)."
3566930,Fisherman Ted,2015-02-21 07:31:00,461,"You make a very good point. When I was younger I did a 1,400 mile 10 week canoe trip all throughout Canada into Hudson Bay. All remote. Every drop of water we drank came right from the lakes. Boy was it delicious. No filtering. No boiling. And those lakes had beaver, and fish and waterfowl etc. Nothing different than the lakes today. I own a lodge and of course have to have a state of the art filtration system with all of the regulations. UV lights, filters, chlorination. The works. Yet when I guide during the summer I just grab a cup and drink right from the lake. I realize the regulations are there for a reason, but we aren't in downtown Winnipeg at a McDonalds. These lakes have been here for millions of years. Now if I was camping I guess I would grab a small filter. But I wouldn't give it much thought or worry. Really wouldn't -FT"
3567042,jokerjim,2015-02-21 07:52:00,473,"I think that if you are used to drinking lake water, straight from the lake and you don't get sick, you may have built up an immunity to the effects that would affect a tourist."
3567650,octanehi5,2015-02-21 10:09:00,1104,"It takes me 15 hrs to get to the plane base One hr flight to the lake, 7 full days of fishing, I'll play it save, boiling it. Do not want to take the chance of catching it, its not pretty This is a trip I do once a yr. if you live there and drink the water so be it.There are very good reasones they have those laws"
3567690,IL-Rebel,2015-02-21 10:25:00,349,"You are probably correct, but why take the chance. Boil water or for less than $100;http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_...nid=2528832011"

3570994,HeHooksHimself,2015-02-22 10:10:00,725,"While I contracted my giardia in the high mountains of Colorado, I still would play it safe. Beaver fever is something that has life long consequences. My stomach rumbles much more frequently than anyone elses, and loudly at times. Going through it was a couple of weeks that I would not wish on anyone. I had to replace my underwear supply!"
3571170,kzoofisher,2015-02-22 10:48:00,5144,While the risk may be relatively low the consequences are severe and the preventive measure are simple. This is why we take extra caution. It's like locking the doors to your house; a simple action that helps prevent an unlikely but very traumatic event. Making sure your campmates wash their hands is another simple safety measure. I like 'em both.
