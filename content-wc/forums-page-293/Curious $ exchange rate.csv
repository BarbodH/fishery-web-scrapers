3571178,Shellback,2015-02-22 10:50:00,8083,"Just curious how you Canadians fare with the exchange rate with Canadian purchases of US products. Say US made Offshore planer boards were selling at $50.00 Canadian when the dollars were par, has the price jumped up to reflect the current exchange rate? Or do costs stay the same till current inventories are gone and the dealer have to start replenishing at the new exchange rate?"
3572226,v-bay gord,2015-02-22 16:15:00,3168,"Since nobody has chimed in I will give my 2 cents (plus 20% exchange). Bottom line is costs go up in accordance with the changing US dollar (for US goods). There might be a delay due to supply in the line, or contractual pricing....or it may just increase 'cause they can. Produce in the grocery stores has dramatically gone up. It's interesting though, that Canada has a history of paying more for goods than in the US. Maybe we just like things that cost more?"
3572674,Shellback,2015-02-22 17:36:00,8083,"I didn't know if it was like OPEC and the price of oil. OPEC raises the price of oil, and gas stations immediately raise the price of gas, when that barrel of oil won't get here for 2 months!"
3573898,Skywagon,2015-02-23 05:53:00,1106,"I agree with Gord's answer. I would expect since the buying power of the Loonie has dropped, it will eventually show up with higher costs on most consumer items marketed by US companies(which most of the name brands are). Like the US, a lot of ""junk"" comes from overseas, I suspect in the end, even those items will increase in price for Canadians, as most of the worlds currencies are tied to the dollar. China is the wild card. Interesting on oil. Even though gas pump prices fluctuates here, it does not seem to be to the same degree as in the US. The gas prices in town (Dryden) have probably been the same for the last two weeks, that is quite common. Consumer prices here are always higher than the US (even considering transportation costs). Nobody can explain why, a Canadian mystery, but it is fact. When building our house in the fall of 2007-2008 the Loonie was over par, we bought almost all the materials locally, but were pricing many items on the south side of the border, just to keep the locals honest. Everything we priced was cheaper in the US, the biggest shocker was lumber (guess Canada does not have any trees). Grin and bare, it is the Canadian way."
3574434,tv4fish,2015-02-23 07:54:00,2694,"Gord: My group has always wondered about that. I don't think that your country's ""wage scale"" is comparatively higher, which one would logically think. It has ALWAYS been the case in the last 30 years that we have gone up there. As soon as you cross the border, expect to pay at least 10% more, especially for gas............ (Exchange rate not being considered)"
3574450,Shellback,2015-02-23 08:07:00,8083,"I'm guessing Canadians pay more due to the lack of competition. Here in the states there are always new businesses opening with lower prices to lure in the customers. We have 300 million prospective customers, and I believe Canada has what, 30 million? Just off the top of my head, lumber and night crawlers are imported into the US from Canada, yet they are cheaper here than in Canada, and that's not taking into consideration of the taxes added. Looking at the help wanted ads in S.E. Ontario, I thought the hourly pay rates were higher than jobs in my area of PA. With the costs of living in Canada, they need to be."
3574522,v-bay gord,2015-02-23 08:17:00,3168,"Some goods and services have either a different tax structure (gas being an example with more Federal and Provincial taxes built in), or other regulations that increase costs. Milk for example has a marketing board structure which maintains a higher return for the producer. No cheap milk or cheese up here! So lots of our goods suffer from hidden costs. Other stuff is just more expensive because the companies cite higher labor, transportation costs in Canada. Population wise, we are a smaller market as well which might explain some of the higher costs. When you come up to Canada to go fishing my suspicion is you are not shopping in a major center (Toronto) so small stores in the back woods are going to seem steep. It's interesting that a big chain such as Target could not bring the cost of goods down (at least to meet the shoppers expectations) when they expanded to Canada. They have now gone under and are running back south with their tail between their legs. Supply problems, higher costs, poor research......"
3574850,tv4fish,2015-02-23 09:26:00,2694,"I agree, and I have to admit that it was kind of a shocker for us here in Minnesota (of course, that is where Target has its headquarters). Somebody back here messed up big time.Apparently Wally Mart was able to pull it off."
3574930,retire55,2015-02-23 09:51:00,1029,"In 2012, I was looking to buy a new Honda 2000i generator. Local price in Ottawa was 1700 CAD or 1637 USD at the exchange rate then (0.9634). However, I learned that I could purchase the identical new generator in the US for 950 USD or 990 CAD. Sadly though, if I purchased said generator in the US and brought it back to Canada for use, the warranty was null and void. Consequently, I waited until I found a slightly used Honda 2000i for 1000 CAD. Its been on every fishing trip since. Of note, when I checked with the local Honda dealer this AM, price for a new Honda 2000i generator is 1200 CAD."
