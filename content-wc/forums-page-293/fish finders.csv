3566114,phishfearme,2015-02-20 20:26:00,1242,"I think I like the big print better!! CHIRP SYSTEMS Sonar reaches a whole new level. By Randy Vance Posted March 30, 2011 2CC CHIRP is the new sonar technology recently released to consumers by marine electronics gurus Garmin and Simrad. Its complete name iscompressed high-intensity radar pulse, and while the technology has been around some decades in military and commercial applications, these two players are the first to bring boaters the ultimate coolness of sonar clarity.CHIRP makes reading sonar signals on a chart plotter amazingly simple by using a technology that is really not so simple. Essentially, CHIRP replaces a single-frequency ping with a pulse that crosses from low to high frequencies. Think of the chirp a bird makes. It starts on a high or low note and ends on the opposite end of the frequency scale to make a pleasing noise. It is essentially a myriad of pings fired in a single burst. Thanks to the computing capabilities within the black box, these new sonars separate these frequencies, measure their distinctive returns, weigh the timing of the returns and their volume or amplitude and use the information to plot a high-resolution image of the bottom and targets in between.Ok, that’s a mouthful, but their benefits were easy to define in our recent tests. It’s like the difference between watching standard-resolution television on a circa-1980 TV and watching high-definition TV on a 50-inch 1080p screen. Remarkable.While capabilities and features of these CHIRP systems vary, one commonality among CHIRP sonars is specialized transducers developed by Airmar. Choices of Airmar transducers are slightly different in frequency ranges but comparable in their ability to transmit and receive a powerful, clear signal throughout the water column. Without them, CHIRP’s black-box modules are mute and blind.Simrad BSM-2 Broadband Sounder Module Suggested Retail Price: $2,495 Airmar Transducer: $1,795 to $2,995Our perfectly calm Simrad test day proved ideal for showcasing the company’s CHIRP sonar capabilities to the max. We scanned various wrecks and breaks from 40 to 500 feet and were impressed by the degree of detail.-We saw that target resolution was consistently detailed from shallow to very deep water and easily maintained a solid bottom return at depths of 1,000 feet. A trademark advantage to CHIRP is its ability to plot depths to 10,000 feet.-Simrad offers various color palettes to suit light conditions and personal taste. We found some targets were more clearly distinguishable with different palettes.-Our test unit allowed us to scroll back the chart plotter and “mark” a spot with the cursor to register that waypoint on the GPS chart plotter.-It allowed us to set a custom zoom window as small as five feet and showed remarkable zoom detail in that window at 500 feet.-Access to menus and functions was more complex than on the touch-screen Garmin unit we tested, but Simrad recently announced the addition of touch-screen capability on its latest units to be released later this summer.-Airmar offers two transducers with two nonadjustable frequency bands each: CHIRP no. 1 — 130 to 210 kHz or 40 to 60 kHz for shallower ranges, and CHIRP no. 2 — 40 to 60 kHz or 25 to 45 kHz for deeper ranges.Garmin GSD-26 Sounder Module Suggested Retail Price: $2,000 Airmar Transducers: $1,795 to $2,995Test conditions for the Garmin CHIRP unit were not so favorable. Three- to four-foot rollers meant our boat rocked heavily, and with that, the signal oscillated back and forth, weakening the ability of the unit to paint the photo-like images of which it is capable.-Target resolution (for fish and baitfish) and distinction were comparable to those of the Simrad unit, and we were able to see individual baitfish in schools.-Touch-screen operation made it easy to manage the system, shortening the learning curve from that of the Simrad unit.-Garmin allows users to customize CHIRP frequencies within the transducer’s frequency range, 25 kHz to 210 kHz, and to adjust transmit power from 300 watts to 3 kW to help better define desired targets.-We did not find the broad selection of color palettes on the Garmin unit that we had enjoyed on the Simrad, but we did find ample clarity on the palette available.-Garmin lacks the scroll-back function we enjoyed on Simrad, but we understand that function may be added by the time you read this.What Is CHIRP? The first consumer sonars came from Lowrance, more than 50 years ago.These sonars transmitted a ping that could be heard by the human ear as a “click.” They measured the time it took the ping echo to return to the transducer and measured its volume, called amplitude, to determine the target depth. It took a long ping to penetrate water to the target. The longer the ping, the more targets blended together. For 5o years, sonar-interpreting capabilities improved with software and LCD screens, but the single-frequency ping remained as its weak link.A CHIRP signal crosses from high to low frequencies in an elongated pulse and penetrates the water better. Next, sophisticated “black box” software distinguishes the returns of varying frequencies, their timing and volume in a complex but instantaneous calculation that allows the device to plot a much-higher-resolution image of targets on the screen instead of one faceless blob."
3566138,phishfearme,2015-02-20 20:42:00,1242,"Joe - my personal opinion is that all this hi tech stuff is not needed. color screens, GPS, 2 million vertical pixels, remember the 3-D sonar? and now CHIRP? and the vast majority of ""fish"" that you see are really not fish but ""software generated indications"" (too difficult to explain here). just show me the structure and I'll do just fine thanks. And if a Canadian lake needs that much tech then maybe the best solution is to get another lake. In my MBA marketing classes we learned about ""market segmentation"" which teaches a company to divide up it's market into a number of categories - the most profitable by far is the segment who buys stuff cause it's new and sexy. Is it better? this segment says it's absolutely better cause it's new and sexy. save the $$ and go on an extra trip or three. ""there's a thousand new lures produced every year and a million fishermen will bite"" phish"
3566922,tooski,2015-02-21 07:29:00,393,"Phish, When Rickont posted the CHIRP info I thought I should probably ""just ask Phish"" since you are a retired Nuclear or Aeronautical Engineer. Thanks for coming on board with your thoughts. Raymarine and Lowrance have the new models for less than $500 which isn't much different pricewise than the existing technology. I have been searching for a GPS-finder combo as an upgrade for a year or so. I have been finding I am more capable lately of getting lost on my Canadian fly-ins than I was in my youth. At any rate I think you have a hidden agenda in that you want me to save my money and join you and Larry at Kearns Lake this year... Joe T"
3567298,Larry S,2015-02-21 08:40:00,665,"Joe, Were waiting for you to pack your gear and drive up to meet us at Armstrong for the flight into Kearns All the new technology is great, but on these trips we go on you don't need color screens, hi-resolution screens and GPS/Depth Finder Complete Systems to find fish. If you want a GPS get a good portable unit. Just had to buy another portable system,and could not find a new or used Hummingbird Piranha Max which uses AA Batteries on E-Bay or other sites. Had to settle for a Lawrence X-4 which uses D Batteries which are more bulky and don't last as long Anyway it would be great to fish with you and your family at Kearns so think about it. Kearns is a wonderful Fishery Larry S"
3567378,PA troutguy,2015-02-21 09:08:00,58,"Tooski, I was considering chirp because it is supposed to clean up the fish finding. I am with Phish on his structure comment. I do like side imaging I have it on the front but not the cockpit. I am also looking for a screen bigger than five inches. Good luck on your search. Was headed to Cabelas today but there is a lot of white sunshine falling, also known as snow."
3568194,pale ryder,2015-02-21 13:57:00,1937,"IMHO, the main advantage of CHIRP is target separation. Which is also the advantage of a big screen. So it would seem to me that I would first spend on a bigger screen before I added CHIRP.SI, on the other hand is a game changer. SI saves me a lot of time in learning the structure and cover in the lake."
3568522,tooski,2015-02-21 16:04:00,393,"Larry and Phish, Sooner or later we're gonna do a fly-in together but until then can you help me out here? You both say I don't need a new fish finder... OK but---- the lake you are flying into this year has.... Indoor toilet, shower and dbl bowl sink in bathroom Remote start generator (really, for Christ's sake) 24 hour sat phone New 14' Lunds New 15 hp motors Flat screen HDTV with Dish Network DVD player with movie selection Filtered well water Propane fridge Electric fridge Chest freezer Microwave And finally... electric ice maker???? And I shouldn't buy a new depth finder although mine is 12 years old.... Love you guys, really."
3568946,Larry S,2015-02-21 18:10:00,665,"Joe, Not saying you shouldn't buy a new Fish/Depth finder If you like color screen and 320 or 480 pixel screen go for it As far as Kearns goes we do not use the satellite tv much if at all. The phone is nice to have, well water is great, Indoor toilet and shower great, don't use microwave, Don't use chest freezer but if you were taking home fish(We Don't) it would be of use. Ice maker makes very small cubes so we freeze ice trays to have bigger ice for our cocktails But seriously get whatever you want Joe, a small portable is fine for my fly-in trips, but if you want one with GPS on it go for it. Maybe one of these years we will finally get together for a fly-in trip Take Care Larry S"
3561042,tooski,2015-02-19 13:30:00,393,"I am thinking of updating my Lowrance 320 depthfinder. Gander has the Elite 5HDI Combo on sale for $299. Seems like a nice item however I also have seen the newer models, including the Raymarine, with the CHIRP technology. Looks like quite an improvement or is it just new sales talk? Anyone have the new CHIRP technology? Thanks....Or opinions on theirs?"
3561314,Lovetofish,2015-02-19 14:40:00,458,And old pro like you Tooski you probably don't need a depth finder.
3561370,tooski,2015-02-19 14:52:00,393,"Well you have the ""old"" part right...."
3561714,jWN,2015-02-19 16:18:00,62,"SI has been out long enough to work the bugs out. Do some research and bite the bullet. Look at how much we invest just to get on the water, may as well see what is under it. Just my opion."
3561930,tooski,2015-02-19 17:08:00,393,By SI do you mean side imaging? I have been doing a ton of research- I just trust WC opinions more than random Youtube entries. I am specifically interested in the CHIRP technology. Thanks.
