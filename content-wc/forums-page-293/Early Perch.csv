We catch a few while walleye fishing and have tried fishing some of last years weed growth but never get into them. Where are the perch at this time of year? deeper? rocks? any ideas where they might be found? Thanks!"
3575762,bushead11,2015-02-23 12:26:00,151,We fish a river system that has large a Perch population. Seeing that you can take home 50 of these monsters we wanted to get on them this year. Any suggestions to help pinpoint where they might be would be awesome!
3575882,v-bay gord,2015-02-23 13:08:00,3168,"Most likely they would be in shallow cabbage beds. Try vertical jigging with a small jig tipped with a bit of worm. Probably best on a sunny warmer day when the shallows start warming up. You may have to fish open pockets in the weed bed, likely very shallow... Here's a link to some perch fishing tips for May.. http://www.vermilionbaylodge.com/ont...h-fishing.html"
3575962,BornToFish,2015-02-23 13:31:00,1224,"I've found over the last years that catching perch is normally pretty easy to do. Finding them is usually the problem! All kidding aside, I will try to build on V-Bay Gord's comments. I've done well some years in May fishing in the bays that receive water from incoming creeks. These are the same creeks that the perch and walleyes use for their spawning runs. It seems as though the perch come out of the creeks and just linger around in front of the creek's opening into the bay. I just snoop around in the emerging weeds until I find them or give up. My favorite bay has a soft, mud bottom that warms up fairly quickly from sunlight and the water flowing into it from the creek. I've caught them in water as shallow as two feet and as deep as six feet. Many of the perch that I have cleaned were full of tiny crayfish that they must root out of the mud. I make hay when I find them, as they are usually moving on to a new place before too long. They likely move on when they exhaust their food supply. Predators such as pike are often cruising the same water as the perch. Expect a lot of bite-offs and for the flock to get dispersed. I normally use a 1/32 ounce, brightly colored jig underneath a slip bobber or stick bobber. I tip the jig with a chunk of crawler or a piece of minnow. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
