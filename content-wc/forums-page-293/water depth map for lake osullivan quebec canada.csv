1738265,F250,2013-05-03 05:37:00,75,"We will be arriving at Stramond Lake on June 10. During the 80's and early 90's I fished that lake dozens of times. It is very easy to navigate, with few hazards. I believe the last time I was there was around 1996. We had become friends with the former owners, and stopped going there when they turned it over to a family member. Anyway, it is a fun lake to fish - lots of walleyes, and we have caught Lakers up to 32 lbs. We don't target the pike. The website shows all new cabins, and we are looking forward to meeting the new owners. While I would like to take my 20'Alaskan, I have decided not to drag it up the Clova Road."
1739681,retire55,2013-05-03 09:44:00,1029,Thanks for the leg work Adempsey. I printed the bathymetric maps for Lake O'Sullivan and filed them away for future use.
1741457,adempsey,2013-05-03 18:15:00,963,No problem guys. Wasn't a big deal at all.

1530232,pike50plus,2013-01-29 08:25:00,584,"If the outfitters don't have ant they probably do not exist, imho."
1531100,adempsey,2013-01-30 19:17:00,963,"This guy might have one listed as Sullivan, but not sure. It's in the right region. Maybe email them to check it out. Worth a shot anyway."
1531105,MikeG1,2013-01-30 19:21:00,434,I have a trip to Stramond planned for June 1-8/2013. I understand Stramond in next door to Osullivan. What can you tell me about fishing these lakes? When was your trip. All info appreciated.
1531370,adempsey,2013-01-31 11:22:00,963,"Well, out of curiosity, I contacted the Quebec Ministry to see if they had the maps. It doesn't appear there are any bathy maps of O'Sullivan."
1533688,adempsey,2013-02-05 11:26:00,963,"Well, after a bunch of government back and forth it appears there are bathy maps for Lac O'Sullivan. I was told today they didn't exist and then a hour later I received them in my inbox, lol. I don't know what the heck is going on there. Apparently all the maps for that region were taken down due to concerns with the maps being too old and not indicating current navigation hazards.Unfortunately, the map is in 2 pdf files that are >10MB each which exceeds the max limit for an attachment. PM me your email and I will send them to you.Also, I am not sure these maps will help you with your ""prop"" issues. They may make things worse since the navigation hazards are not likely to be marked."
1533782,Freytown,2013-02-05 15:50:00,770,It appears you already know where most hazards are...how about making a map for us new guys thinking about Lac O'Sullivan.

1736673,mkress45,2013-05-02 15:22:00,16,"freytown there are many rock piles there at o sullivan it is a very clear lake, if only russell would mark some of the ones in the middle of the lake, I am going to call him & ask him to mark them. I contacted narvarics & they told me as of now they don""t have this lake covered. mel."
1736705,mkress45,2013-05-02 15:29:00,16,"thanks dempsey for all the help I went to the quebec minstry also, they told me the same thing it seems that lake no one wants to be bothered, maybe because it could be private. the map that russell has on his web site, according to him it is not right, so thanks again, mel from allentown pa."
