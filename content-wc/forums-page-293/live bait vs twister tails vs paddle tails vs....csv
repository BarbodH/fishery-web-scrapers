3584658,billy weaver,2015-02-25 19:27:00,470,"I agree with most of the posts. I start out with a jig and live minnow but switch to plastic when I find a hot spot. I use a 3"" Triple Ripple grub from Bass Pro in white or yellow and when my buddy starts out-fishing me I usually switch to something crazy like white with a red tail. The last 10 years I have been taking a flat of nightcrawlers and tip my jigs with half a crawler. When it gets dark I anchor over one of my hot spots and fish straight down just touching bottom with a jig and half a nightcrawler (no plastic). I like to catch them coming up to a flat from deep water, This usually happens right before total dark. But I will confess that if someone in our group is having success with something else I will be quick to change. Then there is always minnows."
3585594,doubleheader,2015-02-26 06:28:00,2652,"IMHO some good thinking here. I would phrase it this way, plastics are most successful when targeting the reaction bite. In weeds or current, the fish has little time to make the decision, more often than not the fish commits. That same fish on a mud flat or even in rocky open water comes up to the bait, follows it awhile, maybe even hangs on a bit, but more often than not drops the plastic bait."
3566290,Knoxabilly,2015-02-20 22:40:00,225,"Usually have a jig with 3"" curly tail on it- then I tip with minnow. Best of both worlds, if they're a little more lethargic then I'll take the curly tail off. I always felt the color of the grub helped grab their attention in that murky Lac Seul water especially"
3567506,Draco1206,2015-02-21 09:31:00,175,"I usually start out with a 3"" chartreuse or white twistertail with a gulp or trigger x minnow. Once I find fish I like to switch to swim baits because I like to feel the hits and I can get more casts in and cover more water. We don't usually bring live bait anymore on our fly-ins due to cost and weight but it hasn't really hurt our fishing or catch rates."
3570010,spoonchucker,2015-02-22 05:59:00,82,I am surprised no one has mentioned using tubes. We slow troll a 3 inch tube with jig head inside. Snap the jig every few seconds. Produces real well.
3570058,pjshorthorn,2015-02-22 06:13:00,5654,"I've used live bait primarily,but had good luck on some paddletail jigs last year that I got from Sirmansky Lures. Attached is a piture of some that I received and I have more beign made as we speak. I especially like the shad color with the chartreuse bullet head jig. Look them up online. PjShorthorn"
3570426,jokerjim,2015-02-22 07:52:00,473,"Check into Charlie Brewer Sliders. They come in several sizes and a lot of different color patterns. I have caught walleyes, smallmouth, largemouth, crappies, bluegills and perch on them."
3582498,johnboat,2015-02-25 10:25:00,2014,"I'm a live bait man. I have a neighbor who has forgotten more than I will ever know about walleye fishing. With a gun to his head, he would not put on live bait. He doesn't need to. Plastics only. I believe its a ringworm he prefers? Bites off a chunk of the head and threads it on. When I use plastics, 10% of the time maybe, that's what I go with. He once asked me why I don't like plastics. I said, ""I don't catch anything with it!"" He asks, ""When do you try plastics?"" I say ""When the fishing is slow and I'm trying other things!"" As I was saying that, I felt as dumb as the look he was giving me should make me feel. My goal is to reach 25% fishing time with plastics. But not when the bite is slow. In his words, ""Presentation trumps bait every time."" I will give plastics this. When I do pick up fish with them, they ""whack"" it harder than they do live bait. Pliers usually required. Must be the action........."
3582690,tv4fish,2015-02-25 11:12:00,2694,"John: Question: Did you mean to insert ""live"" in front of bait in that sentence?If so - I think you have opened a ""can of worms"" and I will disagree with your buddy (and maybe a few other guys will also). I think I could find numerous articles done by other walleye ""experts"" that would contradict that statement. My personal experience also contradicts it.Just sayin'............"
3583138,johnboat,2015-02-25 13:14:00,2014,"TV4, Nope, it means presentation vs. twister tail, fuzzy grub, or live, etc.......after re reading it, I see it wasn't that clear. Meaning if you are using live bait and your presentation is wrong you could have problems. I think the words I'm looking for are, the way you present your bait is more important than what you use for bait. My belief is live bait, with the right presentation, trumps everything. It might be right, it might be wrong. But that's what I believe. And if we believe something, we have more confidence in using it. I think that makes a huge difference as well. The guys I fish with will tell you my percentage ratio is more like 98% live and 2% plastic while jigging."
3583378,tv4fish,2015-02-25 14:19:00,2694,Our beliefs are similar.
3583466,fishinnut 3446,2015-02-25 14:41:00,638,"I will give plastics this. When I do pick up fish with them, they ""whack"" it harder than they do live bait.Pliers usually required. Very true, I start off with plastics about mid April and they just HAMMER IT almost all the time you can't even see the bait. Berkley ripple shad in glow/char. color"
3564714,bigwalleye1,2015-02-20 13:28:00,2632,"Thinking about open water already. How many of you use live bait in search mode and stay with it vs switching to twister tails, paddle tails, or something else? Favorites? Favorite colors? For me, I like to use jigs and live bait to find the fish, then change to 3 in white or yellow twister tails, but have been thinking about trying a shad colored paddle tail. They sure looked good in the Cabela's catalog... What are your preferences?"
3564842,tv4fish,2015-02-20 14:00:00,2694,"Our SOP is pretty much the same as yours. There are usually 3 of us. We will start with live bait -leeches, crawlers, minnows - depending on the time of year. And then, when we get into a good bite - at least one of us will try switching to the artificials (usually me). It seems like the fish STILL prefer the live stuff, though. Favorites - The Gulp leeches and the Gulp minnows (black over white about 4 inches long)."
3564874,mt hook,2015-02-20 14:08:00,65,All of the above
3564978,Algoma Guy,2015-02-20 14:49:00,48,If I had to put a number on it I would say 75% live bait 25% plastics. Various plastics will work but if you are looking for a paddle tail in particular the old school Mister Twister sassy shad is hard to beat. I trim the belly to give it a more minnow like profile. Believe it or not but the trimming is very important. Although many different lures and techniques catch walleye at different times give me a jig head and medium dace minnow and I'll keep that on all day. (Most of the time) haha
3564986,bobbylfishermon,2015-02-20 14:51:00,241,"I like to use perch or black with orange bellies flicker shads to search with, then switch to straight jig& minnow, or jig & apieceof crawler when we find them. In the spring, I almost use nothing but the flicker shads, because everything is up shallow, troll them or cast them, don't know what's going to smack them because everything eats them."
3565002,Lovetofish,2015-02-20 14:53:00,458,I use spinners for searching or in strong wind and white twisters for jigging and tip both with a salted minnow. Funny thing is my tackle box I bring to camp still weighs 100 pounds.
3565098,spurs101,2015-02-20 15:30:00,635,"I'll dress with a twister type tail and crawler. Chartreuse/black, fireball, orange/ chartreuse jig head Tails..chartreuse, motor oil, shade. I've stayed with the curly tails. The paddles get ripped to pieces pretty quick. I've recently had success the last few years using the Storm Curly tail in shade, clear, firetiger, and chartreuse. I'll back troll and work an area for locating willing feeders."
3565274,bthomas3333,2015-02-20 16:12:00,465,Live bait live bait live bait...As someone else mentions it out fishes plastics by 3 to 1. If we run out of live minnows we switch to salted which is better than plastics but not quite as good with a neutral bite.When you are on a crazy active bite. I am pretty sure you could use anything including an empty hook with a gold hook. Active bite the plastic tails are fine but otherwise...live bait live bait.B-
3565314,btmbncr,2015-02-20 16:15:00,492,"After an eye opening experience last summer pulling minnow baits,Husky Jerks,on a 3 way rig and out fishing live bait at least 3 to one it's now my go to rig to start out with. I usually don't fish until I see fish on the electronics.The exception to this is when the y are in real shallow water.Bill"
3565858,BornToFish,2015-02-20 18:55:00,1224,"I tend to view presentations to walleyes as being horizontal versus vertical. As their names imply, lure movement for vertical presentations is primarily vertical in the water column. Lure movement for horizontal presentations if mostly horizontal through the water. I use mostly horizontal presentations in the early season and when searching water for active walleyes. I find that I can effectively use more varied presentations early in the season. For example, a jig with a soft plastics puts fish in the boat, as does rigging and casting crankbaits. The fish is minding its own business when it sees the jig and twister tail passing by. It has to make a quick decision to eat or let it swim away. The fish has little time to think about it. As my season goes along into late July through September, more of my presentations are vertical. I'm fishing quite a bit on the sides of off-shore rock humps. The fish has all the time it needs to think about my presentation as its considering whether to eat or not eat. I've found that live bait out produces artificial baits by a wide margin in the later part of the season. I'm equally split between leeches, crawlers and minnows in July and August. Minnows really shine for me in September. Good Fishing and Tight Lines!!"
