3473770,pawalleye32,2015-01-24 08:28:00,18,Thanks. Trying to squeeze in a trip between baseball tournaments - wondering if flying the extra distance would give us more time on the water.
3492906,octanehi5,2015-01-30 05:35:00,1104,"When a plane flies its always full, as you go to the lake someone is returning, The extra charge only saves you time on the dirt road ,which in the last 3 yrs. has not been that bad Its a 4 hr ride no matter what you do. Same week Ron we will see you there, we can get together again. Going to the show sat 2/7/15 be there all day Call if going 860 402 3209 Ron"
3584802,kegisfly,2015-02-25 20:02:00,22,"The flight from Baskotong is an hour(+/-10min) to Matawa Bay on the Gouin. Probably an 1 & 1/2 to Hebert. Our group did the flight a few years ago. Our flights to and from the Gouin were scheduled for about 8 am. I believe Air Tamarac tries to get these flights out of the way early in the day. I guess the weather could always be more of a factor for this flight than from Clova. Another thing to consider... If you are overweight, they will not bring in the extra gear on a later flight when flying from Baskotong. My experience is that it is closer to a 5 hour drive from Mt Laurier to Clova. That road isn't terrible but, I would suggest a sturdy and reliable SUV, light truck, or truck with a full size spare tire (we got a flat on the dirt road last year). There are a lot of positives to the extra flight (you are saving gas also), but, it adds about 50% extra money to the base price of trip. Just my 2 cents, Kirk"
3585714,octanehi5,2015-02-26 07:00:00,1104,"I have been flying with air tam for 11yrs, I have flown from La Tuge at the rate at that time.I only did it once, To me its not worth the differance, Its very close to an hour and a half,you are gaining only 2 1/2 hrs in time. The road from St. Michael to Parent has greatly improved over the yrs. from Parent to Clova has been Graded to run Trucks from Seniter to Parent, Its only one hr to Clove from Parent, you can run at 50mph,from St.Michael to Parent you can run 45mph. There is no reason to tear your vehical up getting there. most people stay over the night before,and fly out in the morning. Ron it will be great to see you guys again this yr. I think there's a shore lunch in our future"
3467866,pawalleye32,2015-01-22 13:50:00,18,"Anyone ever fly from the Baskatong Reservoir to avoid the dirt road? If so, how long was the flight to the cabins?"
3468010,fosterthedog,2015-01-22 14:36:00,51,"I have thought about it, but always end up at 'I can think of a lot of better ways to use the $460'. It's only 4 hour( driving slow) from mt. Laurier to Clova. After looking at maps Clova is pretty close to 1/2 way between the souther end of the Baskatong and Lac Hebert, Clova to Hebert 45 mins X 2 is 1 1/2 hrs. Just a guess."
3468082,fishron,2015-01-22 14:49:00,317,"I agree, 460 per man is pretty steep. This June will only be our second time in and care should be taken when the road turns to gravel, but I've seen a lot worse."
3468098,fosterthedog,2015-01-22 14:52:00,51,"When you there ,Im 6/28-7/5"
3468154,fishron,2015-01-22 15:11:00,317,We are there for five days starting June 21. Last year was a blast. Here's a couple that I managed to stick.
3468194,fosterthedog,2015-01-22 15:14:00,51,"Nice fish, looks like you got some great weather."
3469194,a3dad,2015-01-22 19:25:00,115,"I did it once, I think it was the first year they offered it, and I think the flight was about an hour. But the nice thing is that they dropped us off right at our cabin on the Gouin. I suspect if you're going to Herbert they'll stop at Clova but I'd check with Jean on that. Personally I prefer to drive now. Given all the logistics of waiting for the flight and the flight time, you don't really save much time overall. The only benefit is not having to drive the forest road. And yeah, the cost us is steep."
3469402,NY Walleye,2015-01-22 20:16:00,78,"I think the adventure on the road makes the trip, as long as you don't have car trouble. Price is steep to pay for a four hour difference."
3469514,Andre (wallyandre),2015-01-22 20:46:00,2274,Something to consider is the waether forecast. If they can't fly then there is no gain in time
3470090,rsiminski,2015-01-23 06:10:00,53,I have flown out of Clova a few times and can say the road from mt. Laurier to Clova is not as bad as you think it is. The newer road from Mt. Laurier to Clova is a huge improvement from the old Clova Rd. There is no way I would spend the money to fly and bypass the drive. Just take your time and watch your speed and you will be fine. Two years ago we saw moose and a black bear on the way up!
