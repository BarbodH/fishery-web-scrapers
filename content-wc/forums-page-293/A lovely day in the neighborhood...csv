3573490,Rich B,2015-02-22 21:09:00,1081,"V-Bay,X 2 on the great photo of the ""snow angel"", most likely made by an eagle....really enjoyed seeing that photo.....can't say I've ever seen anything like that before in the snow angel category (ha).Bet you got plenty of fresh CRISP air today, eh ?So, did your wife beat you or did you beat her fishing today.....and did either of you place in the Vermilion Bay Kinsmen ice fishing derby ?Faith, Family, Friends......and fishing,Rich B"
3574138,v-bay gord,2015-02-23 06:49:00,3168,"The air was crisp. Some may even say brutal. You know it's cold when your wine turns to slush in your glass (see photo). The fisherwomen stayed warm in the shelter but fishing success was limited. The three perch caught by others took home the money, but tradition calls for everyone to win a prize. Next year is the 50th Kinsmen Carnival in VBay. I expect you all to be here!"
3574266,Skywagon,2015-02-23 07:09:00,1106,"Gord, They must have been drinking that low powered box wine Kept looking out at the lake yesterday afternoon, wind blowing the snow like sand across the desert, was glad to be inside. We all should support our local community and organizations, nice that you were doing so yesterday."
3574938,bobbylfishermon,2015-02-23 09:52:00,241,"Calling the ""Northside"" for reservations, I love hanging with a bunch of crazy people, especially for a good cause!!!"
3578850,Larbo,2015-02-24 09:49:00,231,I think I just caught a cold looking at the pictures...
3570466,Skywagon,2015-02-22 08:05:00,1106,"I think the walleye are safe today, -51f wind chill this morning."
3570538,Pooch,2015-02-22 08:23:00,4619,I'd bet you would appreciate a couple cords of oak or a little hedge right about now...........Pooch
3570762,v-bay gord,2015-02-22 09:16:00,3168,Are you saying you're too whimpy to enter the Vermilion Bay Kinsmen ice fishing derby this afternoon? I'll be there looking for the meaning of life....
3570826,Skywagon,2015-02-22 09:25:00,1106,"Gord, will be looking for your name in the CKDR obits... frozen body found on Eagle lake. Pooch, You think they would allow Osage Orange over the border? Might be a little popping and cracking going on in my fireplace with that stuff."
3571002,Pooch,2015-02-22 10:14:00,4619,"V-Bay and now poor Skywagon....I can't quite figure out if you guys north of the border are demented, slow learners or just tougher than nails. I'm still thinking about it. Why would anyone leave a perfectly good wood burner to stare at a hole in the ice on a day like that? Hope skywagon is wrong about the obit... I find V-bay pretty entertaining.Pooch"
3571066,bobbylfishermon,2015-02-22 10:21:00,241,"Dang Gord at -51F wind chill, the meaning of life for me, would be finding my @#$#%er before I wet my pants, overalls, and snowsuit! You're a HARDY bunch!!!!!"
3571098,bobbylfishermon,2015-02-22 10:29:00,241,"My wife said, if I went, she'd send a twizzer with, that OLD girl is just wrong!!!"
3571226,v-bay gord,2015-02-22 11:10:00,3168,"Don't fear......I'm taking my pop-up, a heater, my wife, and several beverages. If it wasn't a fund raiser I would be staring at my fire. I can handle some ""fresh"" air for 3 hours for a good cause. Was out fishing yesterday in some crisp winter weather too. Here's a few pics... The last one is an interesting ""snow angel"" made by what I can only assume was an eagle...."
3571290,bobbylfishermon,2015-02-22 11:19:00,241,"How cool is that ""snow angel"", I've never seen anything like that and probably never will !!! beautiful trout also, thanks for the pics."
3571802,Pooch,2015-02-22 14:00:00,4619,Really pretty pictures V-Bay. Thanks.Pooch
