3579250,jimirjr,2015-02-24 11:52:00,1149,"Yeah... Pike.... LOL! Fished an HB trip at LOW every other year the past 20 years.. I also favor JIGGING with 6lb Flouro... OR 8 lb Magna Thin... Numerous PIKE bite offs... BUT.. it is what it is.. I don't mind losing a 35 cent jig... BUT... what a blast landing 40"" PIKE on 8lb and a jig!! (If you are lucky!)"

3568002,Bitinlight,2015-02-21 12:07:00,95,"The last several years I have fished from Bear Narrows to Chamberlain Narrows of Lac Seul during the first week of June and a week during the middle of July. Walleye fishing has been exceptional during both trips. Thinking about moving the July trip to August. Any real difference in the fishing between early, middle, or late August and what I have experienced in July? Anybody got any information or recommendations about this time of year?"
3569106,jimirjr,2015-02-21 18:46:00,1149,"I'm interested, too... Going the 2nd week of July, houseboat trip. Heading toward Chamberlain.... and points N.E. Never been there. Wonder about fish locations, depths, etc/ Weather, BUGS.... etc?"
3569610,BornToFish,2015-02-21 21:42:00,1224,"I haven't yet fished on Lac Seul. However, I have considerable experience on another nearby lake during August. Walleyes on the lake that I fish are pretty well established on structure such as off-shore rock humps by mid-July. The walleyes by and large will stay near these same structural elements during August, but move deeper as the month progresses along. For example, I am typically fishing eight to ten feet deeper during the middle of August than I was in early August. I love fishing for walleyes in August and September on structure. The fish are often schooled-up. I'm thinking ""game on"" if I can pull up to a rock hump and catch one walleye, as I then know where they all are. The end of August is often more autumn like weather than summer weather. Weeds may very well be past their peak by end of August and in steady decline. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

3570218,pjshorthorn,2015-02-22 06:56:00,5654,"I've been fishing this section of Lac Seul since 1996 and has always been very productive for walleye and northern with an occasional musky possible up to 50"" class in the Chamberlain Narrows area. I've fished the spots mentioned in the original post all the way north to the where the Wapesi river comes into the bay as well as Scaler Lake. Some spots to consider would be Three Sisters reef, Ski Doo Point, Kekabeka Narrows, Chamberlain Narrows by Lac Seul Outposts, just around the corner to the west of this camp, Pecker Point. I also have some spots that have names that only mean something to myself. Generally, I fish extended flats and points that transition into steep drops. Depending on the bite, I'll either anchor on the flat and cast to the drop ;then jig back or anchor on the drop, cast to the flat and jig back into the drop allowing the jig to become vertical while reeling slowly. I've also done quite a bit of drifting down narrows on the drops when the wind was correct. If anyone is interested in more specific areas, feel free to PM me and I'll be happy to help with giving better info. on spots that have worked for myself over the years. I would suggest getting a map for your trip as it is very easy to get turned around on this part of the lake. It happened to me on my last trip even after all the years. I know GPS is a great thing,but it is only geat if it works when you need it. Maps work every time if you have one with you. If anything, it is a back up plan and the otufitters don't provide GPS on the camp boats. You will need the NE section of Lac Seul. Trak Maps, Canada Fishing Maps carry them online. Take care, PjShorthorn"
3570930,Eaglelakergirl,2015-02-22 09:54:00,1,"Depending which route you are taking to get to Lac Seaul - if you will be heading west on Hwy 17 towards the 105 turnoff, you can stop at Eagle Junction on the way. They have tons of maps, and I know they have the waterproof NE section Lac Seul."
3574946,mwh624,2015-02-23 09:52:00,183,Fish should be on main lake structure. Use your electronics to find what wind blown point/reef/hump they are on and you will catch all the fish you want.
3578706,jimirjr,2015-02-24 09:12:00,1149,"I have never been to Lac Suel... I understand due to the ""stained' color of the water, the Fish usually can bite all day? You can go with a 'heavier' line? AND... The fish can be shallower than in the usual lakes at that time?"
3578858,tv4fish,2015-02-24 09:50:00,2694,"Jim: I will just offer what we have found to be true: Yes, we have caught walleyes at all times of the day. We have also caught walleye on a bright, sunny day as shallow as 2-4 feet. As far as the heavier line - can't comment on that as we usually stay with 8 lb. mono. (yeah, we WILL get bitten off by northerns some times)."
