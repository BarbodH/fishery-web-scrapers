3581250,Pooch,2015-02-25 02:29:00,4619,Are they open on a regular schedule? Found them closed the last couple times we were in the area.The food was good.Pooch
3581810,tv4fish,2015-02-25 07:23:00,2694,"Ben: Thanks for ""telling it like it is"". (I just didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings)."
3583674,BenBeattie,2015-02-25 15:23:00,232,"Yes, dinner or breakfast only but you need to make a reservation."
3583754,Downrigger,2015-02-25 15:44:00,60,"Haven't seen any mention of Anderson's Lodge, located on Hwy 72 overlooking Abram Lake, about 5 miles south of 5 Corners. My wife and friend ate there last summer and said experience was very good, both service and food. Restaurant did not open until 5:30pm. While reservations were not required they were encouraged. She did say it was a little pricy."
3561722,tuiflies,2015-02-19 16:19:00,158,Dick and Nellies has a new owner as of last fall. Its worth another try if you found it lacking previously. The Wellington is my new favorite. Good food and decent prices.
3562138,jaym,2015-02-19 17:44:00,89,Is Dick and Nellies still closed on Sundays?
3563226,tv4fish,2015-02-20 07:08:00,2694,"+100 We have ""hit them all"" over the years - and for breakfast especially - I agree. (Guys should note that this post is from a local. THAT should tell you something right there)."
3564114,Babamel2,2015-02-20 10:39:00,414,Lol
3566722,Skywagon,2015-02-21 06:24:00,1106,You buying Mel?
3567466,Babamel2,2015-02-21 09:25:00,414,"Steve, send me an email copy of the reservation."
3573578,rockrunner,2015-02-22 22:23:00,205,Thanks for the info guys. Going up to Lac Suel this Spring/ Summer with a group of 16 for 3 full days of fishing. 5 day trip. Thanks again for some options though. It sounds like Wellingtons will be a go to spot if in the event we go the dining out route. I will have to post my thoughts after the trip.
3574002,Pooch,2015-02-23 06:30:00,4619,"Just a thought. Might not really matter, but.If you are going to hit a smaller restaurant with that large of a group, it might not hurt to call them a day ahead so they can accommodate you without disruptions to your schedule or their regular business.Pooch"
3580946,BenBeattie,2015-02-24 20:41:00,232,"Dick and nellies is horrible food and service. Forrest Inn is better. Knobbys better yet. The wellington lacks atmosphere, but is the best food in town."
3581106,prov1800,2015-02-24 21:43:00,5010,Can folks go to moosehorn to get something to eat ben.
3557242,bigwalleye1,2015-02-18 12:47:00,2632,"I think Robin's donut/sandwich shop is the place Pooch refers to above in post 9. Between Knobby's and Wellington. They've stepped up their game since Tim Horton's came to town. Horton's, BTW, is just past the Wellington, but I've never found the typical Tim Horton's selection available there. Pretty lame, last time I was there, (OK, last summer) they had 2 kinds of donuts and the coffee wasn't ready on the way to the lake. It's been back to Robin's since. The coffee's better there anyway."
3557554,wally rod,2015-02-18 14:45:00,14,Thanks it look like Knobbys this year
3557602,tv4fish,2015-02-18 15:15:00,2694,"Just a reminder:We used to go there ""regularly"" but the last few years their hours have been inconsistent. Are you looking for breakfast - lunch - dinner (or all 3)??"
3557714,wally rod,2015-02-18 16:03:00,14,Dinner and maybe breakfast if it good. We are staying at Forest Inn.
3559298,tv4fish,2015-02-19 06:40:00,2694,UMMMMMMM - I presume you have NOT stayed there before???
3559578,Skywagon,2015-02-19 07:30:00,1106,"Don't take bigwalleye1's word that the coffee is better at Robins, all the great connoisseurs of coffee know Tim Hortons is the best For donuts, neither selection is great, too bad we do not have a Krispy Kreme in the area."
3559602,SeulAreaWalleye,2015-02-19 07:35:00,100,"All of the listed so far are great options for a quick and good meal. There is also the Fifth Ave. restaurant with great meals and a sports lounge, finer dining area as well. That is right on the main St. with parking options as well, some boat room. Great Canadian and Chinese meals here, the New Kowloon restaurant is similar a few steps away. For finer dining options the Forest Inn (without reservation) and Moosehorn Lodge (reservation required)."
3560050,IaDave,2015-02-19 08:43:00,476,I had a pretty good steak at the Forest Inn but that has been about 10 yrs ago.
3560898,Pooch,2015-02-19 12:20:00,4619,"Skywagon, If there were Krispy Kremes near any fishing hole, we would all soon need bigger boats and motors.You and bigwalleye1 can have my share of any coffee. I don't know how anything can smell so good, but taste so bad. Might as well boil leeches and drink the broth.Pooch"
3560954,bigwalleye1,2015-02-19 12:47:00,2632,"If I was drinking it for the taste, I'd never have started....!!! 10-4 on the smell thing, though. If it tasted as good as it smelled, I'd have started drinking it at 8 or 9...."
3555050,wally rod,2015-02-18 03:25:00,14,Any good restaurants in sioux lookout in June?
3555090,John N,2015-02-18 04:52:00,362,Knobby's.
3555346,Skywagon,2015-02-18 05:58:00,1106,"Dick and Nellies is another option, it is on the south-east end of town, a couple of blocks east of Knobby's. Not many choices in Sioux Lookout, there is no fine dining in town."
3555538,tv4fish,2015-02-18 06:36:00,2694,"Probably agree with that comment - For breakfast we like the Wellington - it is west of Knobby's, down at the bottom of the hill on the south side of the road - it has gas pumps/convenience store. There is also the ""Fifth Avenue"" which caters to more of the ""oriental"" type of food (located downtown on the north side of the road as you go up the hill)."
3555690,bigwalleye1,2015-02-18 07:05:00,2632,"+1 for nothing in town. Saw the menu for Foxy's at Anderson's lodge south , but the prices scared me off. Maybe fine dining, but for that kind of dough, I can do a similar meal in camp lots cheaper."
3556602,mwh624,2015-02-18 10:16:00,183,"Best food is at Knobby's but never seems to be open and as others have stated is spendy. Dick and Nellies has your typical bar food, isn't too bad. If I remember, I think they have a decent pizza."
3556858,tv4fish,2015-02-18 11:03:00,2694,"I don't want to get too negative here, BUT, we have tried the pizza there and I have had better ""frozen"" pizza (and, I am sure it WAS a frozen pizza). And then there is the way they make a Rye/water/press drink...........JMHO."
3557074,John N,2015-02-18 11:54:00,362,There's also a Subway.
3557082,Pooch,2015-02-18 11:55:00,4619,"Lamp Lighter Inn just before you come into town on route 72 has a good breakfast. Never had any other meal while staying there for just one night when traveling to LS. Ate there numerous times. Good boat parking.Knobby's was closed for a while. Might be open now, I hope. Food was good. Limited boat parking when busy.Dick & Nellies is OK. Located as you enter the town of Sioux Lookout. Decent boat parking.Wellington is just down the road from Knobbies and is a good place to eat and pick up any snacks. We have only stopped there late in the evening and have had good meals. Very limited boat parking.There is a donut/sandwich shop in the area near the highway, but I can't remember where as it was located. Might be a Subway, but has been several years since we stumbled upon it. Don't think there is much if any boat parking.The later in the evening it gets, the slimmer are your choices. Plan ahead and call.Choices are somewhat limited as Sioux Lookout is a nice town with about everything you might need, but not a large city.As I found out a few years ago, the downtown Ford dealer is the local Yamaha repair shop. Or, it was then. FWIWPooch"
3557138,Lovetofish,2015-02-18 12:23:00,458,Another option is to eat in Dryden. Plenty of options there. I found that works best for my crew anyway. Then we travel another hour to Sioux Lookout for the night and swill a few brews at the motel.
