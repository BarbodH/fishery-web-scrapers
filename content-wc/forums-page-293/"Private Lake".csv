It may be a fun trip, but as far as fishing I think you will have a hard time getting the ship to back troll for you. Perhaps a kayak is available that you could maneuver around the ice flows and polar bears? So what do I think? I will be jealous if you end up onboard. On a positive note, I'm sure some of the more normal fellow seamen will be good influence on you. If you get to go be sure and do a series of posts on WC documenting your adventure. Good luck finding the HMS Terror.........perhaps the name is a premonition?"
3584050,Cut a deal,2015-02-25 16:50:00,38,"Ok Gord I got one more idea. A straight swap no cash involved as usual. I get a week free at your place boat and motor included. I said boat and motor cause I know ya. You get a week free at my cottage in the Kawarthas . It sleeps 6 got a pontoon and a little princecraft to fish in. Not many walleye but lots of smallmouth. 5 min to Tim Hortons. Lets say first week of July you can,t be that busy then is ice even out up there ? Now before you say NO go ask your wife. Were about a hour and half from New Hamburg you can invite her whole family up for the week. We got a bunkie and couple tents you could put 12 of her family around the place. She would love it and you could spend quality time with her family. Deal Gord ?"
3563178,Fisherman Ted,2015-02-20 07:01:00,461,Agree. Not cool damaging someones property whether right or wrong.
3565506,bthomas3333,2015-02-20 17:01:00,465,"Just playing the devil's advocate here, but perhaps the MNR is helping the lodge owners make the lodge feel more private for a very good reason. The success of that lodge owner drives Millions of dollars into the local economy. My two trips per year not counting the outpost lodging costs: 2 RT Air Canada flights from the US to YWG $1200 2 weekly car rentals from Hertz Canada $600 Locally purchased food for my trip $600 Live bait from the local bait shop $400 4 nts hotel stays in Red Lake and Winnipeg $500 Restr meals in Kenora / Red Lake / Winnipeg $200 etc... Just saying the reason the MNR may want to assist making those lodge feel more private is because the inconvenience to local fisherman might be outweighed by the benefit to the economy of Canada. Of course it is really up to the people of Canada to decide the priorities of the Govt and if the MNR is out of line do something about it. b-"
3566106,v-bay gord,2015-02-20 20:23:00,3168,"You are quite right on the economic benefits of ""remoteness"". Unfortunately this topic always generates the same response from the disgruntled group who can't stand tourism. They are bleeding hearts, and as a previous Prime Minister of Canada stated ... ""let them bleed"". For the benefit of WC readers, this issue is mostly in the N.E. part of Ontario, where the accessible lakes have been overfished and jealous eyes are focused on what remains remote and productive."
3572594,Habitual Eyer,2015-02-22 17:15:00,144,I was wondering same thing about small lake outside of Dryden.

3580042,Cut a deal,2015-02-24 16:25:00,38,LOL Gord come on I haven't said a word till now. I know this much the way you carved that pike I could only imagine the way you could carve up my wallet bud.
3580178,v-bay gord,2015-02-24 17:15:00,3168,Of course I would. Time you Southern Ontario bast*rds paid your way up here in the north.
3580226,Cut a deal,2015-02-24 17:26:00,38,"Admit it. For years I'm I the only one on here that religously sends you Christmas wishes every year even thou we agree on just about nothing. Southern Ontario bast*rds is a bit strong couldn,t we agree on I,m a piss ant or something ?"
3581034,v-bay gord,2015-02-24 21:11:00,3168,"I will admit that we agree on just about nothing. Your Christmas greetings are most appreciated (even if they contain no cash, like most other WC members send). I'm sure that being too proud to admit you are wrong, these Christmas greetings are just your way of saying you're sorry. I accept your apology, for all the stupid things you have, and will say. I was just kidding about the bast#rd comment, as my wife is from some forlorn Mennonite village down your way.....and I would never admit to thinking of her relatives in that manner."
3583602,Cut a deal,2015-02-25 15:09:00,38,"Gord your wife is from Elmira wow. So you know I like a deal I got a plan let me run it by you cause well I run everything by you. I.ve been really interested in this Franklin Expedition They say they are going up again this summer to find the other ship. I,ve applied to Parks Canada to be a deckhand or helper doing things around the ship they found. Follow me Gord if I get it they will fly me to Nunavut free. I figure they will take me out to some area where the fishing is amazing free. If it took them 200 years to find a ship the fishing has gotta be great right. Plus they will pay me to do it. So what ya think Gord."
3551178,fsz,2015-02-16 19:41:00,144,"Been looking at a specific lake in NWO. There is only one outfitter on the lake and the lake has road access. Despite this fact, it is billed as a ""private lake"". I didn't think ontario outfitters had exclusive rights like other provinces. Plus, If it has a road going to it, can't anyone just go and fish? I know there are restrictions on camping and also on motorized vehicle use on new logging roads (some lakes that have roads to them you can't use the road but can portage in), but if vehicles are allowed on the road to the lake to reach the outfitter, it would seem the lake would be ""open"". At a minimum, it would seem folks could portage in for the day. The fee is more in line with a fly in"
3551274,Draco1206,2015-02-16 20:05:00,175,I believe there is a whole thread devoted to this subject last spring. You should be able to find it by doing a search of the forum.
3551314,v-bay gord,2015-02-16 20:11:00,3168,"Perhaps the road ends on the lodge property...hence the road access could be limited to guests at the lodge. The lake isn't private, but the access may be."
3551594,38bill,2015-02-16 21:29:00,331,"""Private lake"" may just mean that its very private as there is only one resort and no homes on the lake."
3552090,Stu,2015-02-17 06:55:00,472,"Holinshead Lake is similar to this. The lodge owner explained to me that it used to be a fly-in only lake, but he paid for a road. Some locals occasionally portage into the lake, but he only allows his guests to use the road."
3552426,Fisherman Ted,2015-02-17 08:08:00,461,"Lodge owners (and individuals as well) have exclusive boat cache rights (to store and keep boats on remote lakes). So you cannot store a boat for an extended period of time though you can still use a boat for a day. That being said just because there is a road doesn't mean it is a public road. It could be a private road. Additionally the boat launches on that lake may be on private property. My lake has a private road with boat launches on my property, so a Lund Pro-V can't just wander down and push out. Unless you owned property on the lake or were a guest of mine you cannot launch a boat on the lake. However you can of course portage through from other lakes where there are public boat launches and or public access. Not a problem at all. Or jump in a plane and drop right in!"
3552994,BornToFish,2015-02-17 10:32:00,1224,"It might be that you have a legal right to drive to your lake of choice and launch a boat. However, someone might be annoyed that you are there as they may view the lake as being ""theirs"". If so, I wouldn't be at all surprised if your vehicle is vandalized when you are away from it. You might want to consider legal aspects of fishing the lake, in addition to whether or not you will be welcomed. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

3557994,fsz,2015-02-18 17:31:00,144,I should have looked at google earth first. Its pretty apparent there is only one road and as everyone has said its probably private for the outfitter. Doesn't look like anyone could portage thru based on distance but I guess its possible.
3563034,Guest,2015-02-20 06:11:00,0,"If the road is on crown land (and not the lodge owners land) then anyone can use it until it gets to the lodge owners property. Crown land is for the use of all Ontario people not just for the profits of a lodge owner. NO one can own the lake and unless they own all the land around the lake they cannot stop anyone from fishing that lake , anyone can use any trails or old roads via ATV or snowmachine. Me thinks sometimes these lodge owners exaggerate to their guests (so they can charge more) about how remote their lodge is, when in reality the public has been fishing those lakes longer than those lodge owners have been around............but lately money talks and now lodge owners are convincing the cash strapped MNR to close public access roads .....and MNR is happy to comply because it is one less lake they need to supervise...that is until the lodge owners get selfish and start berating legal public fishermen that get to the lake by portages etc etc. I also noticed that someone mentioned malicious damage that guests would do towards public fishers........hmm if that is a threat ...then payback can be a bitc??? There was a MNR meeting conference call for the public around Dubreilville yesterday and one of the Fur trappers made some very good points about how previous MNR fish studies on two lakes (One was Oba lake) showed that the ecotourist lodge in the first week of walleye seasons took more fish from the two lakes studied than all the winter public snowmobile access combined for that year...........so saying the public is over fishing their lakes............is absolutely false......it is actually the lodge that is taking by far the most fish. So the trapper asked why the MNR was not using their own studies to balance against the complaints from the lodges."
