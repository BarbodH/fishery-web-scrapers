3558450,h8go4s,2015-02-18 19:32:00,1673,I've used the Kayadyn gravity camp 6L filter for several years. http://shop.katadyn.com/product/8019...&language_id=1
3559866,KSjim,2015-02-19 08:19:00,88,"I would also recommend the Platypus Gravity Works system. We used it last year and it is so much nicer, faster, easier than boiling water.We just flew in a couple gallons of water and then used the containers to store water for the rest of the trip. It filters the water very fast. If it starts to slow down just back flush the filter. It is now a ""must take item"" for our fly-in trips.http://www.cascadedesigns.com/platyp...ation/category"
3559922,mwh624,2015-02-19 08:27:00,183,That's just wasting fuel. I believe the EPA recommends 1 minute of boiling
3560234,MrSimon,2015-02-19 09:26:00,922,"I have the same filter, and it does do an excellent job of filtering the water .... it comes out clean and clear. However, I found that the tannins and other particles in the water clogged the filter stone up very quickly. I had to take out the stone and scrub it clean after filling each bottle. I ended up only using it for my drinking water (about two nalgenes per day). For everything else (cooking, teeth brushing, making coffee/tea/gatorade) we treated lake water in flexible 5 gallon water bladders with some iodine and neutralizer tablets. It was still stained brown, but it was bacteria free and worked just fine."
3560714,roscoe33,2015-02-19 11:24:00,653,"Better safe than sorry. I have never been safe, and that day I am sorry is still out there. I have often just scooped water out of the lake and drank it. I usually swim in the water, and ingest some while doing so. So, I am infected anyway. Our cabin has the ""not tested, boil your water "" sign also, and the water comes from the lake. At another camp we go to, the water comes from a sand point buried on the beach. And stop calling it beaver fever. The poor beavers got it from humans."
3560722,Jerryv,2015-02-19 11:26:00,1222,"I bought one of the Katadyn Vario filters a couple of years ago for a BWCA trip. It worked great producing enough drinking water for four people during a hot spell in August. Just screw a water bottle onto it, drop the hose in the lake, and slowly pump for a minute.http://shop.katadyn.com/product/1551.../Katadyn_VarioJerry"
3561738,jWN,2015-02-19 16:26:00,62,"thanks for the in put. Just bought a playtapus system, looks to be pretty easy to use."
3562954,HeHooksHimself,2015-02-20 05:19:00,725,"Like Baxman's brother, I once contracted Beaver Fever from a high mountain stream in Colorado. No lie, when I got back I was umpiring a soft ball game. I knew I had some digestive problems. I called a guy out and announced to the teams, ""I will be right back!"" and had to leave the field to take care of an immediate urge Went to the doc and he told me what I had and had me listen through the stethoscope. It sounded like a construction crew in my belly! That was about 25 years ago and to this day my stomach gurgles excessively and I draw unwanted attention in church.. Trust me, boil or filter or bring in bottled..."
3565226,forgop,2015-02-20 16:07:00,880,"I used the exact same filter last year. worked great, but takes a while to pump enough for a camp. Gets clogged up pretty quickly with the need to use the scouring pad to ""sand"" off the stuff clogging it up."
3557610,jWN,2015-02-18 15:34:00,62,"We will be in an area that is very remote tent camping. Back in the mid 80's we would just take water from the lake with out worring. Now days it seems like maybe we were lucky. For those that go to simaliar areas and do not want to take in bottled water due to weight and such, what do you do? What are the best opptions out there or is it genarlally fine to take from the lake?"
3557626,3M TA3,2015-02-18 15:37:00,2846,It's really amazing what you can drink if you take the time to boil it first. Certainly that would be the minimum requirement.
3557634,JOE WALLEYE,2015-02-18 15:38:00,753,"invest in a filter. light weight, easy to pack. good insurance"
3557650,Pooch,2015-02-18 15:40:00,4619,"We used to drink lake water that was pumped to the cabins then through a simple filter. I doubt that works anymore. Never had a problem. Wife and I also took a filter that screwed onto the tap for an added pass through a filter.If I were camping, I would have some sort of filtration with me. Surely there are campers on this forum that will have the best recommendations. Depends a lot on where you are as to whether I'd drink directly from the lake. I've always heard that in the ""old days"" people would pull their drinking water from deeper water via some kind of stick and cup apparatus.There are tons of options for filters.Pooch"
3557730,JayM5209,2015-02-18 16:06:00,1050,"x2!!!!!!!!! Spend the bucks for a good, higher capacity filtration system. The $75-100 or more will be well worth it. Do an on line search at the outdoor/camping equipment sites for options. The money spent will be well worth avoiding someone in your group getting giardia. Lakes in NW Ontario with resident beavers, or with inflowing water from another lake with beavers - that's all lakes in NW Ontario - have high risk of giardia protozoa and you do not want those bugs in your gut.The risks are not limited to NW Ontario. I do not drink lake water anywhere unless filtered with the right equipment or boiled for the necessary time."
3557850,octanehi5,2015-02-18 16:33:00,1104,"AKA Beaver fever, always boil the lake water for 20 mins."
3557906,Pikeslayer8,2015-02-18 16:47:00,1460,"At Wabakimi there is a sign in our cabin, by the sink, that says ""Please Boil Water for 5 Minutes before being consumed"". We always joke about that sign........... If the bear comes into camp we got to get the water on the stove and stall the bear that 5 minutes......before being consumed..... The last several trips, we use a couple large nalgene bottles and a couple steri pens. Swirl em around in the water for about a minute (the color of the tip will change when completed) and stick in the fridge."
3557978,Mike Borger,2015-02-18 17:15:00,1554,For some time now I've brought a couple of these lightweight water filters with me on my fly in's. They're compatable with the 1L nalgene camping bottles.Takes a couple minutes to pump a litre of water. Takes all the bacteria out as well as the tannin stain. It's just like drinking fresh spring water.http://www.mec.ca/product/5001-239/m...2Bwater%2Bpump
3558090,kzoofisher,2015-02-18 17:56:00,5144,"I got one of these last year and it worked great. We took along bottles to carry in the boats and a five gallon collapsible container. We only did a couple gallons at a time and that was all we needed each day; took less than a minute to pump the bag full, it would be filtered in a couple minutes and you do it again. I had to back wash the filter once during the week. Highly recommend this if weight and space are at a premium.http://www.cascadedesigns.com/platyp...ation/category"
3558410,Baxman1958,2015-02-18 19:18:00,14,"Do everybody in your group a favor and get a good filtration setup. What a way to ruin a perhaps once in a lifetime trip!Beaver Scat Fever My older brother got it, drinking from a high mountain stream while trout fishing out West. Wrecked his guts for at least 6 months. My brothers and I have drank a lot of NW Ontario lake water over the last 45 years, but, not anymore. I also like to boil it (rather than a filter), but depending on your camping situation, 1 lb propane tanks might be at a premium. If you're burning wood, you obviously want to kill a couple birds with one stone, so you boil water before or after your cooking fire. Unless of course you happen to have a couple of face cords of dry oak and birch sitting next to your campsite. Wouldn't THAT be nice"
