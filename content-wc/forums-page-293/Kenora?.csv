3587482,MN_Moose,2015-02-26 12:03:00,964,"Kenora is a very cool mid size town. Bigger than Glenwood small than Des Moines. There are all kinds of shops in Kenora. Jewelry, gifts, decorations, I like going there and getting a different sense of society. Smith Camps is only 10 - 15 minuets to Kenora. Portage Lodge MacKenzie Lodge You could also look at a couple camps on Longbow Lake (connected to LOTW by portage lift) Gustafson's Resort"

3591898,deadhead1,2015-02-27 11:04:00,193,"It more like three hours to Winnipeg but, yes, it can be done. Also don't miss Reddin's store on Longbow Lake 10 minutes east of Kenora. There is lots of good Motels in Kenora but if you want to be on the water try Smith Camps. They have a great food on site."
3592954,stillangling,2015-02-27 14:43:00,149,"My advice would be to stay at the Lakeside Inn. It is right on the waterfront in town. The dining room is all glass looking out on the lake. Dinner as the sun sets. They have docks right at the hotel. Wander down in the morning and jump in your boat. The women can stroll around town all day and keep busy. As mentioned earlier the farmers market is cool. Lots of crafts and baking. Dino's is a good lunch spot. The Pier gets the nod for breakfast. They will love the Blue Heron (junk the women like to buy - can't understand the attraction myself). Definitely they will like the MS Kenora cruise. The street people can be a little colourful but they tend to stay in the mall parking lot near the liquor and beer stores. Nothing worthwhile there for shopping so it won't be an issue for the wives. In terms of the fishing, get south of the barrier islands and you will be very impressed with the quality of the fishing. Walleye move onto the humps in the summer and it is a no brainier."
3584338,BigEye,2015-02-25 18:04:00,223,"Wife finally lowering the boom. My wife and my buddies wife are loooonnngg time friends. Tired of us boys taking off to go fishing in the wilds of Canada while they sit home. The girls don't want to fish, they want to shop, eat out, all that stuff while we go fishing. Where we normally go, there is no place to do that. Another friend suggested Kenora. You still have great fishing with LOW at your doorstep, but there are things for the women to do. Is this true? Suggestions where to stay? What is there for shopping, restaurants?"
3584850,LOW1,2015-02-25 20:15:00,2828,"I think Kenora would be a great place to spend one day, perhaps two. Wednesdays are farmer's market days, which is worth seeing. Decent assortment of shops in the downtown area. Lake of the Woods museaum is worth seeing. LOTW Brewery is a decent restaurant, but the service can be slow if it's crowded. There is a bakery to the east ofthe brewery with good deli sandwiches and pastries. Borealli's (sp?) on main street is also not bad as a restaurant.All of the above are in the downtown area.Where to stay? I'd consider staying at a resort between Sioux Narrows (one hour south) and Kenora and driving into Kenora for the day."
3584938,v-bay gord,2015-02-25 20:31:00,3168,"I'm thinking Vermilion Bay should be your destination. Less crowded, but yet close to Kenora and Dryden......the women won't know what to do first! Places to fish? Many."
3584946,@Lunker,2015-02-25 20:32:00,835,Www.witchbay.com I believe it's 17 miles from the camp road to Kenora.
3584954,Baseline,2015-02-25 20:32:00,3207,"Kenora is a small town. I guess with the proper motivation the girls could find something to keep them busy. If you want good fishing and really happy wives go to Costa Rica or Roatan Honduras. Costa Rica has great shore fishing and cheap pangas (small boats the locals use to take people fishing) or top notch deep sea charters. Roatan is kick-azz fishing with lots to do. Both are affordable too. I know its not Canada, but this is how I solved the same situation and I get to fish as long as I want."
3585074,Bandit,2015-02-25 21:06:00,140,"Lots of resterants from fine dinning to fast food & downtown has small boutique type shops for the girls to shop in. Plus some box stores like Wal-Mart, Canadian Tire & good Grocery stores. Lots of different accomadations from hotels to motels and some fishing camps 30-45 minutes away. I Find Lake of the Woods has many lakes with the lake it's self. Areas with lots of eater Walleyes to areas where fishing a little slower but lots of trophy fish. Fishing good for Walleyes, Small Mouth / Large Mouth Bass, Northerns, Muskie & some lake Trout. Please PM me if you have any question."
3585530,Babamel2,2015-02-26 06:12:00,414,"A number of years ago my wife too felt like coming along rather than stay home. She did want to go in the boat with me, but made me promise that if she wanted to go back to the cabin, I would take her back regardless of how far from the cabin we were. We went with my buddy & wife, On Monday, my buddy's wife asked my wife is she would be willing to take off Wednesday to go to town. My wife responded ""Nope, I'm going fishing."" On Wednesday she commented to me ""Next year when we come ...."", By Friday her comment was ""We could come for two weeks some time."" So if you take your wives, be prepared for a change."
3585698,dutchboy,2015-02-26 06:55:00,5717,"I'm torn whether it's a good thing or a bad thing they want to come with. On one hand it's cool they want to be involved in the trip, on the other it's another ""guy thing"" eliminated. Glad I will never have to face the same issue. In any event I hope they have fun, a trip where they didn't would be a week of hel on earth."
3585794,SinOrSwim,2015-02-26 07:15:00,1528,"Sioux Narrows seemed very ""touristy"" when we drove through there last year. Granted, still not a lot of shopping to do I doubt."
3586498,Larry S,2015-02-26 09:11:00,665,"The wives can drive 2 hours to Winnipeg a large(600,000) city ,go shopping, visit many cultural places and dine at excellent restaurants. There are many hotels to overnite. The wife and my fishing friend's wife saw a panda on loan from China at the zoo in the late 80's,this was first time a panda had been out of China."
