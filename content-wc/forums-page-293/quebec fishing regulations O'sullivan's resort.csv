3575042,retire55,2015-02-23 10:11:00,1029,Here is the web reference to Quebec's Sport Fishing Regulations in English - see http://www.mffp.gouv.qc.ca/english/p...ions/index.asp O'Sullivan Lake Lodge is located in Quebec's Zone 14. The walleye possession limit in Zone 14 is 8 walleye per legal sports fishing licence. A sports fishing licence for 7 consecutive days is 45.22 CAD or 35.92 USD at current exchange rates.
