3525034,adempsey,2015-02-09 14:25:00,963,"Based on some research I just finished:For inland lakes, most anglers use Octopus or similar type of beak hook. The dominant products being Gamakatsu Octopus and Walleye Wide Gap Hooks. Other popular hooks are Mustad UltraPoint Double Wide Fine Wire Live Bait, Owner SSW Live Bait Hooks, VMC Octopus and Walleye Wide Gap Hooks and Matzuo Octopus Hooks.Hook Sizes:40% use size 220% use size 410% use size 110% use size 1/010% use size 610% use sizes 12,10,8,2/0,3/0Size 2 and 4 are the most common for multiple hook and single hook spinners. With multi-hook spinners, the hooks are usually the same size but some like to mix the size 2 and 4 together.The larger hooks (1+) are almost always single hook spinners."

Would never have guessed that I could catch walleye on such small hooks, but have done well with just a hook, leech and split shot. Basic pure fishing pleasure. Cheap, too.Pooch"

3592442,CKM,2015-02-27 13:01:00,3836,I kind of go with what size fish the lake is giving up at the time. If they're smaller fish I'll tend to roll with a #4. If they're larger I'll pull #2 hooks. And also if the bite is really light I may go with a #4
3594602,last chance,2015-02-27 20:16:00,3262,I fish lake eries central basin and like the gamakatsu walleye wide gap 2/0 hoogs for those big girls. and my landing rate has improved 50%. just my opinion.
3595442,ILScott,2015-02-28 07:01:00,139,I use the slow death red hook or a #1 aberdeen hook.
