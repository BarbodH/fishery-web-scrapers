I've been to Wabaskang a couple of times but not that late in the season. We're staying at Jim and Julie's."

The pike were in the shallow weeds. I haven't spent any time fishing for perch or smallies at that time of year, so I can't help you there. The weather was cold and rainy both years, so we moved our trip up a week this year. Hopefully we'll have a little warmer temps. My wife would sure appreciate it."
