Never been with this outfitter, never been to this lake, just used some of their recommendations to make a choice in the lake I wanted to fish. Please... can anyone who has been to this lake, give me all the information possible on the accomodations, and what I can expect in Walleye and Northern fishing at this time of year on this lake? Just want to catch some good size fish, and hopefully lots of them. Thanks Mike"

I can also mark up a lake map and mail it to you. You picked a great outfitter! You will have no regrets. My party is making it's 5th trip with Mattice Lake and each year seems to get better."

I will be taking my 6th trip with them this year and I honestly believe that no other outfitter offers the quality of service, accomodations, and fishing that they do. I have not fished Weese, but I am sure you will catch lots of fish. I don't know about ""big"" fish, but you should average 30-70 17.5"" to 23"" walleyes a day per man."

Have used a diffrent outfiiter each year for a change of pace and to see diffrent parts Canada. Mattice Lake Outfitters might be the first outfitter we may actualy use twice. First rate sevice. Ran out of Wiskey and tobacco, they flew in replacements later that day. Motor broke down on portage lake, they flew in to fix it. They delivered ice every other day. Fishing was good fot numbers but sizes were not there. Cabin first rate."

What is the walleye and Pike size range and what time of year did you go? Wondering about live Bait too, ive taken nightcrawlers to other places but sometimes minnows worked better whats ther case here. Thanks for the help."
