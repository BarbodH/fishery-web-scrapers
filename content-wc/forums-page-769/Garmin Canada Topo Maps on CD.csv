Has anyone had any expierence with these units and the Canada topo maps. I have booked a trip to the Gouin Reservoir and would like to use the maps there. Thanks in advance,"
546642,Thumper,2005-03-28 17:31:00,133,"I've got the US version for my RINO 120. It works. I can't say that I love it. Depending on Eastern or Western US, it has a level of granularity of 33 or 66 feet of elevation. The countours are pretty coarse as well. I don't think it gets updated very often - there are some roads that are 7 years old that don't show up on the map, despite me updating it every 6-months or so. Also, the waterways don't have any depth information. That said, it's better than nothing. I sure wish you could use DeLorme or competing mapping software on the Garmin products!"

I think it is a great product, with very few of the other manufactures offering anything with as much detail for all of canada. It is 4 disks and covers all the provinces. Here is a link you can zoom into the area you are looking for and see the detail they offer.http://www.garmin.com/cartography/ma...opoCanada.jsp# follow the link and then click on TOPO CANADA on the right hand side A great place to buy if you are looking, cheapest deal I could find for both the TOPO Canada Software and GPS. As well there is currently a 50$ rebates on the Garmins.http://www.gpscentral.ca/"

546703,Seanik,2005-03-30 22:24:00,218,"Thanks to all of you for the great information. I just purchased the Garmin Etrex Legend C and the Canada Topo map on eBay. The Gps after rebate was 245.00 US shipped and the Canada topo was 99.50 US shipped. I can't wait to get my new tops. Also got a portable transducer bracket, the suction cup kept falling off the wood boat even though it had a metal plate for the transducer. I ended the buying binge with a Garmin 120 portable fish finder. Hope I don't have to explain about all the package deliveries to the wife, good thing I'm retired and she is still working and probably won't be here when UPS delivers."
