The Airlane Travelodge, Victoria Inn or the Valhalla are also nice and they are easily accssible (at the corner of the Thunder Bay Expressway and Arthur St.). The other nice place is the Prince Arthur (the old, nice place in town), with an awesome near-lakeshore view of Lake Superior, but it is in downtown Port Arthur and thus is a bit more effort getting in and out of."
