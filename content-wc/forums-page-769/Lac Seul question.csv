Some years there are new islands on Lac Seul which weren't there the year before. I have an 18' boat and fished in spots where the rocks are sticking out of the water at the front of the boat and my depth finder reads 100' at the back of the boat. Wild structure. I love it and wouldn't have it any other way."
546513,Guest,2005-03-23 16:48:00,0,"I recommend looking at Ojibway Outfitters, they are located on the northeast section of the lake. Fishing is excellent, you don't have to take a 20 mile boat ride to find a good hole. Actually the best fishing on the lake is with in sight of the camp including the dock. Figure on catching 30-50+ walleye a day per person most in the 2-3 lb range, 5-7 lb fish are very common, and figure on boating at least one 8+ walleye during the course of the week. Smallmouth fishing is probably not as good as LOTW (never fished there), but we have caught several 15-19"" fish while going after walleyes. The best place i know of on Lac Suel for bass is Wapesi Bay (Northeast section of the lake). As for the cabins it is probably not as nice as silver waterwheel (never been there), but if you are just using it for sleeping and eating it is not bad. Check out there website they have a lot of pics. http://www.lacseuloutposts.com/"
546527,Guest,2005-03-24 22:24:00,0,"Don't give up on SWWL. I've been every year for the past seven, and these guys are right... there's none better! Sometimes you can sneak in on a cancellation, but Mike has improved the operation so much in the areas of customer service, equipment and fishing results that the waiting list does get lengthy at times. Once you're in, you're in and have dibs on rebooking the following year. As for comparing it to LOTW, there isn't one. I fish the US side (Rocky pt, Long pt, Knight, Bridges, Garden Isl) 6 or 8 times a year on the open water and the ice just to get a fix before going back to Lac Seul. I've caught numerous trophy 'eyes on LOTW, but they are just so much more abundant on Lac Seul. As someone else mentioned above, SWWL is in the middle of the lake so you don't get pressure from Ear Falls or Sioux Lookout. Keep trying for SWWL, its the only real choice."
546662,fishingbuddy,2005-03-29 15:23:00,18,"Have been fishing Lac Suel for 7 years now. Boy are you in for a treat if you go. Fantastic walleye fishing. Both in numbers and size quality. Huge amount of fish in the 3 to 5 lb range and can expect fish toping out over 28"" with a chance at a 30"" also. 100 fish per day are typical if your savy at fishing for walleyes. Jigging, live bait rigging, bottom bouncing with spinners and crawlers, all work. Send me a e-mail address and will tell you more."
546669,hawkeye,2005-03-29 18:30:00,112,"Fished out of Sioux Lookout 2X year for 27yr. For your first time stay at Anderson camp and use their guides (a little pricey) They will if wanted do all the cooking. Or go to Ojibway Outfitters remote camp, do your own cooking and like previous mentioned some of the worlds best fishing is just off the dock so to speak. I also fish other great lakes but Lac suel best once you pay your dues. I have never fished Ear Falls (West end) but many post on this site loves that end to."

546679,Guest,2005-03-29 21:41:00,0,hey Mark have u been to evergreen the last week of may i am from west va. in the usa.need some tips for that time of year.any info will be app.how is the pike fishing and smallies that time of year.what colors of plastics for eyes.ty.
546698,Rich J,2005-03-30 18:29:00,65,"bassluver We go to Evergreen for two weeks every May. Boats and cabins are excellent, all new or near new with swivel seats and 40 or 50 hp Mercs. Plenty of northern and walleye, can't help you much on smallies. Email or call Gary at evergreen for information on smallies, I am sure he will be able to help you out. The big problem may be getting a week as most are repeats.http://www.lacseulwalleye.com/ Rich J"
546702,hawkeye,2005-03-30 19:52:00,112,"RE; Hump 1 Pay your dues?? By that I mean simply fishing the lake over time and learning the honey holes. Honey Holes??? Places that more often than not you catch a lot of walleyes, I.E the more you fish a lake the better you know where to catch fish, i.e ""paying your dues"". PS. I never could explain anything in just a few words. Just having a little fun before ice out up north."
546704,Guest,2005-03-31 06:42:00,0,"Glad you explained "" Honey Holes!"""
546705,FIB,2005-03-31 07:13:00,23,"If I may add to your ""paying your dues"" line. Learning where the rocks and reefs are happens over time, especially since the water levels change year over year. It's a bit scary up there when you are racing through areas you have not been before. Have seen the depth finder go from 40 ft to 4 ft in seconds."
546103,Guest,2005-03-06 21:52:00,0,"Hi guys, I've never been to Lac Seul, but researching it for a friend who's taking his wife on there first ever trip to Canada (walleyes and smallmouth). For those of you who have fished it, how do you rate it? How would it compare to LOTW (which I have fished), in terms of both quantity and quality? Also, could you give me some lodging recommendations. The 2 lodges that I'm looking at are... 1. Silver Water Wheel 2. Lost Island Lodge Any other suggestions? Thanks in advance! John Schroeder"
546105,Larry S,2005-03-07 07:09:00,666,"Have fished North West end at Goose Bay It might be easier depending upon time of year to get accommidations around Ear Falls. Silver Waterwheel is almost completly booked every year, don't know about Lost Island Are we related in some way? Larry Schroeder"
546107,Guest,2005-03-07 07:34:00,0,"I have a trip I am going on in June, and have been trying to get a group to go in August. I just tried to book SWW and Mike said he was completely booked for the entire year. I have not fished LOW, but have fished other areas in Canada. Size and quantity of walleye have been incredible on Lac Seul. Only problem is at times you have to travel far to find the honey hole. The only reason I tried other lakes is to find similar fishing on a smaller lake, but I am going back to Lac Seul. It is a gimme."
546112,Gary_IA,2005-03-07 12:27:00,144,"Although I don't have first hand experience with Anderson's Lodge on Abrams Lake, near Sioux Lookout (with private access to Lac Seul), I do know of a group of anglers from the US east coast went there on a first time Canadian trip last year, near the end of May. From what they said and the website, it appears to be a topnotch accomodations and food. Fishing was outstanding during their 3 or 4 day stay. See:http://www.andersonslodge.com/"
546131,Guest,2005-03-08 09:38:00,0,"As has been mentioned, you probably won't get into SWWL this year. Lac Seul is the greatest walleye fishery around right now. There are many other lodges to check out, although most are in the more populated (whence more pressured) areas of the lake. When you come to SWWL you get the best. That creates so much return business, there is little room for new guests, but that doesn't mean you can't get on ""the list."" The list looks like the Green Bay Packers season ticket waiting list, lol. NWO Fishing Bum"

546278,Guest,2005-03-14 12:13:00,0,Check out Evergreen Lodge. They are up by Ear Falls. very friendly and helpful. I think they are getting new boats and motors for 2005. We've been there 10 or 12 times in the last 6 years
