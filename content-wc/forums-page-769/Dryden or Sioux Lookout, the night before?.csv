546596,hawkeye,2005-03-25 20:50:00,112,"Warning Siouxlookout motels are usrally??? booked up.The Lamplighter is cheap and will serve your purpose.1 807 737 1014 I think it's a 70 min drive from Dryden to S Lookout. I liked staying at the Kowality Inn 800 207 2134 (cheap) at Dryden, just after you cross the river. Great breakfast buffet, back door across alley, donnet? shop across street and Large grocery store close by. Walmart on East edge of town. In my going to canada stuff I have the names and phone # of most motels in both towns if you need them. Someone on this site needs to let you know when the stores are open. We started hauling our food up, didn't like taking the time shopping. Some of my friends have fished Ghost River Camp for years, they love it. Maybe the camp keeps beer, fishermen used to go there on the railroad years ago."

546628,Guest,2005-03-27 22:18:00,0,"i have had a cabin in sioux lookout for roughly 7 years now. they have done a lot with the town and i even bring the kids up there now in the summer. there is a new waterpark and hotel just as you come into town. the guy who built the new grocery store opened it this past winter. dont know how, as i have been up there for new years before and they cant even keep their restaurants warm. anyway, give me an email if you need to know anything about the town, fishing or lodgeing. [email protected] if you are looking for a place to stay i may even be able to help you out as i still have a few weeks open at our place if you dont mind having to cook and clean after yourselves. good fishing!! another good site is www.siouxbulletin.com. to keep up on the news up there"
546518,Guest,2005-03-24 10:51:00,0,"We are going to Ghost River Camp in July, we go in on Monday morning so we are going to drive up Sunday afternoon and spend Sunday night in a hotel. First, what will the border crossing in I Falls be like going into Canada on Sunday at about Noon to 3:oo pm? Also should we stay in Dryden or Sioux Lookout? We plan on picking up bait, groceries and booze wherever we stay. Also, names of motels in either town that are cheap. We will only be there one night so we dont need anything too great. Thanks in advance for oyur help. Brian"

Things change a lot up there from year to year, and especially in the motel trade. Because of this, rates, quality of sevice and even the name of the places can change. That being said, Sioux Lookout has a great web page for this type of community. Their web site is www.siouxlookout.com.... I know that will come as a suprise. Along the left hand margin of this wef pagenthere is tool bar. Go down to ""Chamber of Commerce"" and you will see ""Business ""Directory"". Click on that and then choose ""Accomidations"". You will find a list of the ""establishments"" that you are looking for. Hope I did not insult your intelligence with this step by step instructions. It took me a while to find it...I'm not the sharpest caryon in the box. Heck up until a few years ago I was still trying to sex nightcrawls. I use to watch them have sex and the first one to role over and fall a sleep I thought was the male. Seriously, this web site has some other nice links too. Look under ""Useful Links"" and you will find a link to ""currancy converter and also one for the local weather. As far as Dryen goes, I never stayed over. Only thing I did stopped for was gas at the Husky Station. Dryen also has a web page listing accomidations, but my brain was to taxed to navigate it. As to the topic of bording crossing times, here is a web page that lists the ""real time"" crossing times, www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/general/times/menu-e.html I got this off this board last year. A coulple of weeks before your trip you can tract the times. As a side note, if the Chamber of Commerce Office is open (you will have to drive right by it to get into town) stop and get the book ""Crasy White Man"". It's a great read. P.S. Don't tell anyone, but my real secret to sexing night crawls was to put a ""TV sapper"" in the worm contain and the males would always be the fisrt to gravitate to it."

The start of the second line of the second paragraph should read; ""hand margin of this web page there is tool bar"" not ""hand margin of this wef pagenthere is tool bar"". I gots to work on my speling too. Oh by the way the book ""Crazy White Man"" is at the Sioux Lookout Chamber of Commerce."

546581,IaDave,2005-03-25 09:55:00,476,I have stayed at the Lamplighter Inn in Sioux Lookout and it is a good hotel that doesn't cost alot. The bait shop is within a 1/4 mile from it. I'm not sure if the liquor or beer stores are open on Sunday. There is a grocery store downtown.
