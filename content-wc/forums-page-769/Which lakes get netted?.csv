546590,Guest,2005-03-25 14:46:00,0,After the uproar last summer of the rotting fish found in abandoned nets on LOTW a woman from the MNR claimed that the nets only targeted walleye. What a joke. The nets were filled with trophy pike and muskie. Nipissing was a great walleye lake back in the early 90s then the netting got out of hand. A friend who knows how to fish went to Nip last summer for the first time and managed only 15 walleye in a week of fishing.

546568,Guest,2005-03-26 16:30:00,0,"You could contact MNR district offices.ie Red Lake, Dryden, Kenora..to ask for what lakes have commercial licences on them, species and quotas for each licence. Unlike some of the responses commercial netting can be done in a responsible manner. Many of the licences are primarily for whitefish, with some allowable incidental catches for other sport fish...ie walleye, northern...but in much smaller amounts. It is possible to set nets in certain depths, locations where the target fish (whitefish) is what you will primarily catch. In some cases the netting is allowed only in certain portions of each lake so as to minimize incidental catches of other species. Quotas allow for only so many pounds of each species to be harvested and marketed. Are there loopholes and shoddy operations that waste...probably but it would not be the majority (nets are expensive and you can't sell poor quality fish). Major lakes in NW ont. such as Eagle, Lake of the Woods, and Lac Suel all have at least one commercial whitefish licence on them. I wouldn't make any assumptions about their effect on the rest of the fishery...in most cases a few weeks of the lodge operation shore lunches on each lake would exceed the walleye these (licenced) nets harvest. Thats a fact."

546573,Pooch,2005-03-25 07:52:00,4619,I know that some of the lakes in Canada get netted. Even those that seem remote and not that large. Where would a person find out which ones are netted and how much and what species are removed? Pooch

Some of the larger lakes are commercially harvested but I'm not sure were to find the harvest records? Ontario MNR should be able to supply the areas of legal commercial fishing activity. There is problems with illegal fishing or non regulated fishing is some areas. I'm not sure exactly what you are looking for, is it a question of what lake to select to fish on? Northern Eye"
