546240,Guest,2005-03-12 16:37:00,0,I am thinking about renting a houseboat this summer in Hudson. Looking for someone to share their experience and opinions. Thanks.

We have a party of 16 that rent 2 houseboats and have a great time. Now we only have to fish within 5 or 6 miles, where before had to run 25 miles one way to get where we want to fish. Just a thought to ponder, the cost of taking gas out of the houseboat to fill our personal boats runs $5.00 a gallon so we bring our own to save some money, do not know what they charge. We also have brought our own generators as the ones provided are very small. Also check into if there is a cost for insurance. We do not, we hire a guide to take the boat out and Costs us 250.00 for round trip. Fill the freezer with ice b4 you take off. These would be things to look into b4 you make a descision. Hoping you have fun if you decide to take the adventure."
