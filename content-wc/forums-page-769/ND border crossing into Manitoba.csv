Over the years, I've gone over in Pembina and I think it was called Westhope (middle of state). Its been many years since I've been there and would really like to know the most favorable crossing. Opinions anyone? wjw"

In all of those years, we have only been pulled aside one time going into Canada, and all they did was check our ID. Those who had some sort of mark on their record were talked to about upcoming issues (Like the DWI thing and some sort of police record mark) but at that time, they were not in effect. The line usually moves pretty fast. Nice open layout, room to pull off after passing through for pit stop, etc. Steve"
