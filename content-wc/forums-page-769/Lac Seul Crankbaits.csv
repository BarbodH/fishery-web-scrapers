What are the choice cranks and colors to drag and what depth and what type of structure do you perfer for dragging cranks? We have never fished Canada and any help would be greatly appreciatted. Thanks, Brad"

Like to work wind blown shorelines or large flats close to deeper water. In June we stick to water that is 8-15 ft deep and move fast enough to have good lure wobble. Over the years this type of fishing has caught bigger fish for us than jigging and it is a great way to cover more water and locate concentrated fish to stop and jig for."

This is a whiteish color that apparently matches the forage or shows up well, because this color out-produced all of my old favorites. I think it is available in a shad rap this year which should be a killer. I agree that the shad raps work good. We've been going for the last 12-14 yrs and one thing I've learned is to not be reluctant to fish shallow. Shallow sand can be red hot through June sometimes as little as 2-4'. Watch for gulls walking the shoreline, that is a hatch of gnats that will have the eyes right on the beach. Casting toward shore from a boat with a crank can be great. Mepps spinners work good then, too. Good Luck"

546689,Guest,2005-03-30 08:41:00,0,We have had good luck in June flipping small crankbaits and twister tails along shorelines. This method has not only got us on Walleye but some nice Smallies too.
