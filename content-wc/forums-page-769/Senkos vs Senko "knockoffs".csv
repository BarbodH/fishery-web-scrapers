I have yet to find a knock off that caught as many fish as the original Senko. What makes the Senko so good is it's drop rate, it's got the perfect salt impregnation about it that gives it the perfect drop rate...have not found a knock off that compared. A little trick I use when whacky rigging the Senko is to get a good supply of o-rings small enough to fit snug around the middle of the Senko....run the hook through the O-ring...not the Senko. The Senko will last a good while rigging it that way...if your into the Whacky rig style, which I've had the most success on for Smallmouth."
