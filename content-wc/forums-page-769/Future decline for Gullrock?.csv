543498,Guest,2004-09-28 15:39:00,0,"It seems to me that the camp owners should make it very clear in their brochures and any shows that they go to that the taking of any any walleyes over a certain size will not be tolerated. That any one doing so will have their fish physically taken away from them as stated by one reply to the original message. The position taken by the camp owners while not in accordance with Ontario's Laws as to what size walleyes can be legally kept will possibly cause them to lose some business, but I am sure this would not bother them. Of course they could gain business if word gets around that Gullrock is the ultimate big walleye spot in Ontario if you want to only fish for fun. Gullrock has not attained that reputation as of yet, they would need to wrest that title from Lac Seul where I never here anyone complaining about fishermen keeping big walleyes, at least on this message board. I go to Red Lake quite often and fish that lake, Keg and Gullrock. I appreciate the efforts of the camp owners but don't ever tell me I can't keep a legal sized fish. If keeping a few fish by the tourist fisherman is hurting the Red Lake Chain what is the large resident population doing to the walleyes? Camp owners make sure the homeboys live by the same rules you want the paying tourist fisherman to live by. Just some thoughts."
543534,Guest,2004-09-30 05:57:00,0,"I heard an interesting statistic the other day from a DNR person who was engaged in walleye research. For spawning purposes the fish that are 18-22"" long produce the largest percentage of eggs that will hatch. This is due mainly to the fish being younger and possibly healthier. I by no means am a fish biologist but if you think about it that makes sense. I also understand that if you enjoy to catch big fish you need to let them grow. I target walleye exclussively in my home state of Wisconsin and my favorite trip in Gullrock. The great thing about the Gullrock is you can catch as many as you want but you never know if that next fish will be a dink or a 22"". To me that is great. I truly appreciate that the camp owners have enforced this policy and will continue to support them by giving them our business. Jeff"
543558,Guest,2004-10-01 12:16:00,0,"Renn, I got your letter thank you for your concerns all I can say is our camp enforces the fish policy of no walleye over 18in. can be eaten. If I lose business do to the fish policy so be it, I do make the business with referral and when guys hear about all the big fish you can catch on Gullrock. Indyguy, the Gullrock camp owners fish policy doesn't say you can only fish for fun. My guest as I'm sure all the other camps guest eat fish daily also they can take fish home if they choose. The locals are doing there share to keep the fisheries strong. I fish with a lot of guys up here and I won't be in their boat if they kept over slot fish. I hope you can change your mentality about keeping big fish. Throwing them back only helps the fishing"

543563,2 DOGS,2004-10-01 13:29:00,361,"Indyguy: You and I agree on one thing and that is the ""trophy fish"" policy should be in the camp brochures and emphasized at shows. Placing a reminder on the cabin wall is a little after the fact. Mind you I'm not advocating taking any big fish, I have never taken a walleye over 18"", released them all the way up to 30+"". Replicas are much nicer anyway. I do believe it would be best if people were aware of this policy prior to booking. Now we disagree, there have been numerous posts on this board complaining about people who fish Lac Seul and continue taking their 1 fish over 21"", that they are legally entitled to. I remember one post I responded to regarding increasing the ""slot"" on Lac Seul in particular. I would love to see the ""slot"" changed to anything between 18"" to 28"" must be returned to the lake. Just my opinion, but then it would be a true trophy fish. While there are some camp owners on Lac Seul that really stress releasing over-slot fish, I don't believe the camp owners, as a group, have been as aggressive as those in the Red Lake chain, especially Gullrock."

543608,Guest,2004-10-02 11:02:00,0,"Indyguy I also agree with you that New guest that want to fish the Gullrock chain of Lakes should be told the fish policy. Thats why right out front on my sport show booth there is a Decal showing what size fish can be kept. The worst thing that can happen is someone not knowing the policy before they get to camp. As 2dogs was saying I know that fishermen keep the over 21in. fish on Lac Suel, I've lost guest to Lac Suel because they wanted to keep over the slot fish."
543621,Guest,2004-10-03 19:20:00,0,I agree with the premise that large fish should be returned to the lake. If the camp has stressed in all of their contact with a customer that this is a strict policy and part of the camp rules there should be no complaint. One question I would like to ask is during any Walleye Tournament on the Red lake Chain of Lakes is this critera adhered to? Do tournament fishermen have to bring in only the same size fish as the camp customer? Thanks guys.
543625,Guest,2004-10-03 22:28:00,0,"You need to understand this is a policy put in place by the Gullrock Lake Camp Owners Assoc. It is a policy enforced by the camp owners of this lake however it is not inforced by the MNR. This policy in no way shape or form effects the local people of Red Lake or the guests of the camp owners on Red Lake. I don't think any of the Gullrock camp owners would be against you if you wanted to freeze a wall hanger and have a taxidermist pick it up, as long as you count it as part of your limit. The policy just states oversize fish will not be cleaned in camp. From what I have seen in brochures it is plainly stated. I think there are 5 or 6 camps on this lake and it works out to be a very good policy, IMHO."
546179,Guest,2005-03-09 17:11:00,0,"Lynn, sounds like 17&7/8"" is getting pretty close to 18""s. Why don't you just keep walleyes 171/2 inches and smaller. Personaly, I perfer the 15-16"" fish when it comes to eating them and we very seldom take any fish home, sure makes the road checks go a lot faster."
546691,grt1,2005-03-30 11:18:00,259,"I just spent the last 15 minutes reading all the postings on the decline of gullrock fishing, let me tell you as a local who lives on this lake, it is not in decline. the campowners have done a marvellous job in trying to keep the lake producing. Certainly, there will always be a meat hog, who feels he/she is above the rules. While the MNR allows 1 over the slot, why must everyone take that one fish that is big. Last fall prior to the tournament that Bud talked about, I went out for a quick trip to spots I would like to fish in the tournament. In one day I caught and released, 2that were 25"" 2 that were 27 1/2"" and at least 10 that were over 22"". This is a sample of what can be seen because of the policy that is in place. And yes as a local, I observe the same policy that the camp owners have. I carry a camera. Gullrock is far from dead and when you visit, you too will discover this."
546706,Guest,2005-03-31 08:13:00,0,"Thanks GRT1, every once in a while it is good to hear some positive comments on these posts. It is still positive to remind fishermen, (& ladies) that practicing catch and release of our larger brood stock female walleyes is what has made this fishery what it is. Please continue to follow these simple rules and don't be afraid to help educate people thinking about not following the rules. The good days of fishing are still in front of us."
546707,Guest,2005-03-31 08:31:00,0,"You make a good point about the size of walleyes to keep. I remember when the slot size first went into place we spent our time trying to get our limit as close to the 18"" as possible. It's evident when cleaning fish in the cleaning house at night that this is still a common practice with stringers of limits so close to 18"" that the only way to accomplish that is sorting fish throughout the day.(human nature I guess) Like walleyduran we've learned to keep only the 15-16"" fish for eating and only seldom bring any home and like the rest of you I've watched fishing at most lakes in Ontario get better each year over the last 10 + years. It feels good to know you were a part of that."
546709,Guest,2005-03-31 09:44:00,0,"I keep Bullheads in my personal Bullhead slot 8"" to 12"". These are the best eaters if you roll them in mashed minnows and cigarette butts than fry them in motor oil they have a very exotic taste."
546712,Guest,2005-03-31 11:01:00,0,"I have been fishing Gullrock every year for about seven years now and the fishing has only gotten better. This past year our group boated a 30,28 1/2, 27, 4 at 26 and to many from 20-24 to count. Also a 42 and two 40 inch northern. We had a tough time finding fish to eat and hope it is the same way this year. I go up there to catch fish and have a good time, if I want the meat I will fish closer to home here in central Wisconsin. People can complain all they want about the lake association rules but if they are so bad then why are we starting to see the same regulations here on the Wisconsin River. They must do some good."
546158,lynns,2005-03-08 20:18:00,3,"I can assure you, if you stay at Goldenhook Camp, you are told more than once about the size limits. And I back Bill 100%, no one in my boat will ever get clost to 18"" and put it in the livewell. My rules are 17 @ 7/8 or less. I know Bill would put a stop to anyone from his camp keeping anything over the slot, and I commend him for it. Thats why the fishing is so good. The smaller ones are the best eating!! Lynn"

I stay at Wright's Wilderness Camp, (formorily Weaver's) and would also like to know which camp's the boats were from. Please e-mail me at [email protected] I will be leaving for Gull Rock this Saturday and will post on the fishing when I return. Renn, Good post and thanks for the concern."

Still would like to go fish for the green slimmers up north.I suppose you'll go chase teal this weekend. Will have to go to gull rock with you next year to see what all the fuss is about. PS Still spanking some nice ones on the Coon. Crazy.
543341,2 DOGS,2004-09-15 19:18:00,361,"Hey Bud: Long story short, no new boat (this year). Couldn't get the motor, thanks Mercury, so the second boat order has been placed. Get all the big ones staked out, we be goin in 05! Good to hear all the positive comments on releasing the big ones and the great fishing."
543349,Guest,2004-09-16 07:36:00,0,I wanted to say that we just finished our 6th year at Five Lakes Lodge and this year by far was the best big fish year we had. We had many many fish over 24-26. When I started fishing the Gullrock I was impressed by its quality. The last two years I also did a fly in and the numbers were there but not the size. Bud keep up the great work releasing those fish does make a difference. Jeff
543358,Guest,2004-09-16 15:15:00,0,"Was up at Golden Hook 2 weeks ago and saw a guy in a camp boat keep a 23"" fish. One in our group told Bill about and he was not a happy camper. One of the guys said he was from Denver and didn't care about the assn. rules.He won't be back there again. Don't know why they keep the moma's anyway. The smaller ones fry up 10 times better. Think it's just an ego thing."
543390,Guest,2004-09-19 22:32:00,0,"As the owner of Golden Hook Camp on Gullrock Lake I feel we must respond.We do indeed enforce the fish policy of releasing all walleye over 18"" & all northern over 27.1/2"". Reason for the fish policy is to give our guests the best possible fishing.The most unpleasant thing I have ever had to do as a resort owner is tell a guest to leave because they are not interested in the fish policy. Yes, I had to do that again this season, some folks just don't get it. If you see someone keeping over limits or keeping large fish get a boat registration number, camp names are on all camp boats, no camp name, then it's a private boat.Get the best possible discription and let your resort owner or MNR know.Remember the only reason you catch big fish is probably that many fisherman before you released it unharmed back into the water. Take a photo and do the same. We had two 31"" walleye released this summer & biggest northern released was 49.5"". These fish photos will be up on our web site in Nov. Fishing is much like a bank account, you must put something in, to get something out."
543406,Guest,2004-09-21 13:56:00,0,"A good topic and a great walleye lake. We have been fishing Gullrock 2-3 times per year for the past few years and have reservations for 05. All of our trips have been to Five Lakes Lodge. The associations rules have really made a difference in the quality of fishing and most of us are pleased that the lodge owners enforce it. I can't help telling the following story from the trip my wife and I made this past June. We were staying in a smaller cabin at Five Lakes close to the stairs that lead down to the dock. Each morning we would have breakfast and drink coffee in front of the big picture window and watch most of the fishermen leave for the day. One morning we awoke to find the skeleton of a 22-23"" cleaned walleye(found in the fish house from the night before) nailed to the top of the stair rail with a large sign reminding everyone who passed that fish this size were not cleaned at this camp and anyone caught doing it would not be invited back.Everyone leaving to fish had to go by that location and even though similar signs were posted inside each cabin nothing got the point accross like that fish skeleton nailed there for all to see! Way to go Bud!"
543418,Guest,2004-09-22 16:46:00,0,"I began fishing Gullrock in 1970 with a friend who at that time was employed by the mine. I have had the pleasure of fishing with my 2 sons and friends during most of those years. When they were 8 and 5 years respectively we practiced and promoted catch and releasy except for shore lunch only -- smaller fish. Redsky's camp was our hang out back then. Since 1970 many things have changed in the area ---fires of major proportions----tornados---ownership change at most of the camps and each time everything not only bounced back but improved. The most effective change was the size restriction policy adopted by all the camps. You can not find a fishery in Ontario with a comparable water flow that produces the number of 25"" and larger walleye that this one produces -- disregard the size restriction policy and it will not last long!~!~! PS please help me, I plan to start the GRANDCHILDREN through the cycle in 05 and hope for the same great experienc for them."
543280,Renn,2004-09-13 13:29:00,87,"I am placing this post to ask for help from fellow Walleye Central readers who fish Gullrock Lake. My family just returned from another great week of fishing at Gullrock but had two situations where we witnessed other boats keeping 20-22 inch walleyes. This is in addition to two similar situations we witnessed in August. All 4 of these situations were happening by boats staying at the same two camps. I can honestly say that this is the first time since the adoption of the ""Trophy Policy"" where we saw other boats keeping fish of this size. It was the Gullrock Camp Owners Association that adopted the policy that the 1 fish over the 18 inch length limit needs to be a ""trophy"". To me a trophy is not a 20-24 inch walleye. This policy is the reason the fishing at Gullrock is what it is today and will continue in a positive direction if the Camp Owners Association will consistantly enforce the policy they adopted. I know Bud the owner of Five Lakes Lodge is a regular reader of this forum and hopefully he will bring this issue to the next Association meeting. We have also contacted our camp owner and will be composing a letter to all of the camp owners in the Association stating our concern. I would encourage fellow Walleye Central readers, and Gullrock anglers, to contact your camp owner and express concern about the consistant enforcement of the ""Trophy Policy"" at all camps on Gullrock. This policy helped create the outstanding fishery Gullrock is today. Renn"

If the boat is from my camp fill free to stop in or call the camp and give me the info as my guest know I will take care of the matter. There was a walleye tournament on the chain of lakes last week, but it is catch and release. I am trying to get a camp owners meeting organised this fall and I will vocie your concerns."

He contacted the camp owner about the August situation. But the boats last week were from a different camp. We do know the camp where these boats were staying. By the way none of the boats were from Five Lakes. It is frustrating to see selfish anglers beginning to destroy a situation the camps on the Gullrock chain of lakes have worked so hard to develop. I have yet to fish Gullrock and have trouble catching enough ""eater"" size fish to feed 7 people in our party. So to me keeping a 20 - 24 inch fish to eat is hard to understand. Thank you for taking the time out of your schedule to be part of this thread and for bringing this situation up at the next association meeting. I will take the opportunity to discuss this over the phone with you. Again, thank you for your help. Renn"
