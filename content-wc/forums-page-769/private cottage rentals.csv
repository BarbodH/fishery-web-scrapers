I know another situation where a European decent couple adopted a native daughter who has not lived on a reserve since adoption. When they have major purchases she buys it and there's no tax. They've been doing that for years. She also went to Winnipeg to college on a free ride from the govt., which gave her living expenses while she was there. I've seen that winter lighting a couple of times, it always seems to involve a ""poorly kept"" property and a big insurance policy."

546355,Guest,2005-03-16 20:28:00,0,"I understand your view on renting your cabin as being legal, but if you're renting it to the public and tell them to use crown resources, you do need a license. If you are sure you are doing it all legal, then go to the MNR and tell them what you are doing and see if they say you are ok, or if they give you a fine. I have recently gotten a resource based tourism license and know the rules. This is directly from tourism licensing, if you operate accommodations, available for the public, that will make use of crown resources such as land,fish, and wildlife, and if you promote access to these resources for the public to visit yor establishment, then you will require a resource based tourism establishment license. So that pretty much means that if you are on the lake and renting it for money, you have to have one. If you let them use a boat while renting your cabin you are 100% illegal. You can argue all day long, but that is how it is. American lodges , housekeeping resorts, campgrounds, outpost, hotel, motel, marina, ect. all need licenses."
546368,Guest,2005-03-17 10:34:00,0,I have sent an email to Min of NMD. who is responsible for this asking the questions brought forward here. I will post the results of the email when it becomes available. It will definitely clear the waters.
546377,Guest,2005-03-17 16:00:00,0,"There is a house(cabin) for rental on Thunderlake near Dryden, Ontario. This is their first year. They are working on a web side but you can email them at [email protected] for more information. They offer weekly and monthly."
546630,Guest,2005-03-27 22:50:00,0,"i purchased a cottage 7 years ago from an american which gave me a shack and 2 acres of land ownership, not 99 year lease. i have purchased over $20,000 american dollars worth of canadian goods and services from the local economy in the sioux lookout area in order to make the place fit to stay. I also pay over $600 a year in taxes now for roads i dont have, schools my kids will never go to, and police protection i never get when our place gets broken into. I also pay the crown $65 a year to rent a path of land down my driveway in order to have electric that I paid a local contractor $14K, thats thousand, to hook up. i also pay the local hydro $25 a month connection fee whether we use it or not. When all of the nickle and dime stuff came through a few years ago and our taxes tripled i check with a local attorney, an attorney in the states and our accountant. I claim the income which is net so it is usually a loss after the cost of keeping it open, on my taxes down here if I use it more than 14 days a year. I have had a lot of luck in renting the place to offset the taxes, insurance and other costs that i have been hit with to between 10 to 30 people a year who typically spend $300 to $500 dollars worth of US funds while there. i hope this news from the trenches helps clarify what you are looking for. you can contact me directly if you need any help[email protected]"
546637,Guest,2005-03-28 12:02:00,0,Cottage Owner....please post your results. I have a few cottages that I'm going to start renting out in a few years just so I can have someone there while I'm not to keep an eye on the place. Your input would be greatly appreciated.
546308,Guest,2005-03-15 17:52:00,0,"Resort owners have to have proper gas storage, approved septic systems & treated water to drink. All docks must be in good repair.They also enforce fish policy, I can understand why they get up set about residents renting cottages with little invest & making money off the their lake advertising or just plain stealing their guests that they spent thousands at sport show to get to come to their resort. Yes the issue keeps coming, wonder why? My cottage isn't for rent & we support our lodge owner with buying minnows, grocery's & gas."
546309,Guest,2005-03-15 18:37:00,0,There is always issues between resorts and cottagers when they share the same lake. Some resorts feel that the lake is theirs because they have a resource based license. Municipal Affairs and Housing dictate the zoning and permitted uses of property. OMNR and Tourism have their licensing issues for but on PRIVATE PROPERTY they have no say. They can work with a restricted area order but thats it. It's my Property and if I'm renting it and paying taxes too bad. Next thing there will be rules as to who can come up as a guest from what country and how many and for how long.
546310,Trailerguy,2005-03-15 19:01:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]There is a cottage down the road from me that is a rental. The owner is from Wisc., he has a sheet on the wall at his business that folks sign up on. It appears to be full all summer. Wether or not sales tax is collected is anybodys guess. ;-) I seriously doubt that he's taking customers from any of the 7 resorts on the lake. In fact 1 of the ""resorts"" isn't actually, he's just getting started and lacks enough facilaties to qualify for the tourism permits. When he qualifies in a few years he will be eligible for a number of ""perks"" such as applying for moose tags or buying a Bear management unit,(sadly the day of being given a bear unit by the MNR seems to be gone). While I'm sure he's collecting sales tax, none of the other outfitters resent his competition, and that is quite suprising....in as much as he pays no income taxes......one of the advantages of being a native. :rotflmao:"
546311,Guest,2005-03-15 19:03:00,0,"I did some digging for you and came up with this Effective July 31, 1998, tourist accommodation establishments that make use of Crown Resources must be licensed under the amended Regulation 1037 of the Tourism Act. The Tourism Act is administered province-wide by the Ministry of Tourism and Recreation. Regulation 1037 under the Tourism Act defines ""Crown Resource"" to mean any right, interest, or allocation of Crown property or any right to use or allocate property of the Crown including right, interest or allocation in respect of fish and wildlife. A resource-based tourist establishment is required to be licensed by the Ministry of Tourism and Recreation, if it intends to enter into a Resource Stewardship Agreement or if it currently makes use of, or intends to apply to the Ministry of Natural Resources to use Crown resources through instruments such as land use permits, leases of Crown land, bear management areas, allocation of moose tags and boat caches. Over 1,350 resource-based tourism licenses have been issued in Northern Ontario, which represents 90% of the provincial total. MNDM staff with expertise in tourism are available to provide professional consulting services regarding the tourism licensing process, requirements of the Tourism Act and regulations, and whether other approvals for a license are required. Staff also process Resource-based Tourism Operation License applications, respond to information requests and visit Resource-based Tourism sites. In Northern Ontario, contact the MNDM Northern Development Advisor (Tourism) in your area, who will assist you directly or link you with a specialist either in MNDM or another ministry, who has the expertise you require . Click here for MNDM Contacts Links: Ontario Business Connects - RBT Applications, List of Field Offices Renting my cabin does not require a license nor does it make me an outfitter. I am a property owner leasing or renting my property like renting your home or any other property you own. Please correct me if I'm mistaken......"

546318,Guest,2005-03-15 22:24:00,0,"From what I've seen, most of the people that rent private cottages are the fish hogs. The type that waste fish, throw their garbage all over. They like the private cottages because their is no camp owner or other guests around to keep them in line. In the past in my area MNR (or the tax man) have not had a lot of luck catching and prosecuting them. I have heard that once the locals have had enough they will take matters in their own hand. Gotta watch out for those freak lightning storms in the middle of the winter. Stick to the licensed and legal resorts and help the local economy. Better yet with your mentality stay at home with your can of beans. The reason for licensing is to attempt managing a resource, so people can continue to enjoy excellent fishing in Canada in a clean and healthy environment."

546319,Guest,2005-03-16 05:42:00,0,You have got to be kidding. Cottage owners typically cater to families and people who they know and the same people rent every year. They keep the place spick and span and abide by the rules and treat it as their own home. Fishing is but a very small part of the whole Northern experience. People who are fish hogs stay at resorts who cast a blind eye to this to make a buck. I witness this every year.Your threatening print is also disturbing. In Canada we settle our differences over a beer or coffee...not burn the guy out.

546251,sabreman,2005-03-13 09:51:00,7,Anybody know a website where you might find private cottages for rent in the Northwest Ontario region. Or is this something that is not done in this area?

546255,downriverbob,2005-03-13 14:39:00,880,"Try this website, they tend to be a little on the high end in some areas but have vacation rentals all over the world and a ton in North America. www.vrbo.com"
546258,Guest,2005-03-13 16:28:00,0,"With most of these cases they are renting illegally. The MNR have allocated so many beds/lake for resorts. If cabin owners rent out their cabins illegally and do not charge the tax, you could have problems. They can run into problems with the Provincial Tax people and so could you."
546261,Guest,2005-03-13 18:15:00,0,MNR can only dictate guest numbers if they are on Crown Land with a land use permit. It's none of their business if you own or lease property freehold.
546262,Guest,2005-03-13 18:29:00,0,"You didn't seem to mention the tax man. Do you charge PST. IF you are running a ""small resort"" with out a resource based tourist licence they do."
546284,Guest,2005-03-14 17:47:00,0,MNR can make all the rules they want. I have a legal right to lease my property to anyone I want to. If I lease weekly so be it. I include my revenue at the end of the year and pay my income tax as rental income. If MNR had their way all cottages would be gone and the land would revert back to nature. There are way too many tree huggers and nonhunters and fisherman employed by OMNR. This cottage rental business comes up every year at our lake and a lot of people are critical of people like me who rent their place out. I have a number of American friends who come up and I enjoy their company. I'd appreciate if you could bring forward where it says I can't rent my place out. The resource based licence I understand only applies to commercial operators entering into agreements with OMNR for Moose and Bear licences and boat caches and land use permit.
546289,Guest,2005-03-14 23:30:00,0,"MNR only hires tree huggers. Hmm. Had a few run ins with them have you? If you are renting your cabin for profit to fishermen, you are a commercial operator. This is not rocket science. Even our Canadian gov't non-hunting tree huggers can figure that one out. Your hope is that they won't catch you. From the sounds of it, your neighbours hope they will. I'm with them."
546300,Guest,2005-03-15 14:02:00,0,"Gotta agree with cottage owner here. Everybody is already told enough what they can & can't do with their property. If the neighbours don't like it...CYA, wouldn't want to be ya!!! One mistake Cottage owner did make though is not getting cash from his clients, don't report it, just put it in YOUR pockets, where it belongs!!! By paying taxes, you just are funding the liberal tree huggers & friends!!! Jim"
546303,Guest,2005-03-15 14:55:00,0,This is the crux of the matter....What makes me a commercial operator? It is legal to rent or lease property in Ontario. That the property happens to be on a Lake and that some of the people happen to maybe want to fish is not my issue. It is legal to fish in Ontario and it's legal to rent space. So I guess it's okay to rent my place if they don't fish. Please provide black and white references to where it says it's illegal.
