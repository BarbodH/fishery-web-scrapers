546197,Guest,2005-03-10 12:26:00,0,I am looking for a good drive in fishing resort in northern SK for a trip planned towards the end of May or first part of June. Excellent fishing and nice cabins are a must. I will be bringing my own 18' boat. Any recommendations?

You can expect excellent walleye fishing in Jun-Jul and excellent pike fishing Jul-Aug so July is your best bet for both. It's a long drive but you indicated Northern Saskatchewan. I go there about every other year and the fishing is what brings me back. I've tried a lot of other places but always end up dissappointed either in the price or the quality of fish. I've seen my share of 40 inch pike and some very nice 30 inch walleye as well. Good Luck, Steve"

546567,gapr,2005-03-26 16:28:00,192,"i have went to amisk quite a few times as well. i have stayed athe north end of the lake at the overland cross country lodge get a hold of wayne elliott @the lodge and he can arrange accomadations. the nice part about the north end of the lake is that wayne's an excellent host, there is pavement right to the lodge and launch, and the lake is protected from the wind with the 100square mile island in the middle even on the windy days you can get up to the north channel. drawbacks is there are quite a few islands and as every other lake around northern sask a few rock reefs to watch for. early june you can get some great pike fishing in some of the bays(usually farthest from the launch). there is also the rocky view lodge iam not sure if it is open as i see it is for sale in the following linkhttp://www.pin.ca/sask/04-0601/default.htm"

546633,Guest,2005-03-28 06:43:00,0,"Don't go to Nipawin, Saskatchewan that early in the year if you plan on fishing the river. Usually to muddy from spring runoff. starts clearing up mid to late June. Should be able to pick some off out on Tobin Lake though. W5"
