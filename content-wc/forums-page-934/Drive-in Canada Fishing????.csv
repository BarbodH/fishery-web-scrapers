522880,Guest,2002-07-25 06:33:00,0,"Hi Everyone. I am looking for a new place to go fishing in Canada. The last place that we went did not have very good fishing and that lodge is now closed. I know that it can be difficult to find good drive-in or boat-in fishing, but maybe someone has an idea. The new location must be a drive-in location where I can take my own boat. Or, I would consider a location where we drive and then boat in to get to a lodge or cabin. My wife absolutely loves to go fishing, but her health is not very good, so we cannot fly. We need to drive so that we can accomodate her health needs and want to take our own boat because of creature comforts and because it is rigged nicely for fishing. We want to catch walleyes and maybe a few pike. We can drive from Ohio up through either Buffalo or Sault Ste. Marie. Please tell me what you would recommend. Thanks for the great help. Ohio Fisherman"

There is no charge for launching or docking your own boat.Lots of Ohio people like the Lodge.The web site is www.sawmill-lodge.com Pinner"

We went to Lac Seul in NW Ontario..Good roads and excellent camps..The fishing was fantastic...many slot fish and a number of 5-7 lbs walleye..Plenty of nice pike with a 41"" being the best..We stayed at Scout Lake Resort...Nice place, nice people excellent fishing...Drive right to the cabins..."

522884,Guest,2002-07-25 18:09:00,0,you may be out of touch with canada fishing over the lst few years. no one needs to fly anymore. there are plenty of excellent spots that you can drive to. I would HIGHLY recommend the Lac Seul area for a trip. Probably the best walleye hole in north america. And this is not an exaggeration. If your interested you can email me but I am leaving for LS tomorrow afternoon. If your interested email me at [email protected]
522885,Tyee,2002-07-25 19:07:00,60,"I saw that you're from Ohio, and as I live in East Central Ohio, Ihave fished a number of camps north of Toronto and also over bySault Ste. Marie. One of the best Camps that I've enjoyed over thelast few years is a new camp on Tunnel Lake, located about an hourand one-half northeast out of Sault Ste. Marie. Very good fishing forwalleye, pike and SM Bass; with quality accommodations, and greatowners. Their website is www.campkuha.comYou basically have the lake to yourselves, and there is a good rampat the Camp. Electric is available for onboard chargers, and the camphas a sauna which is enjoyable after a long day on the water. We'vepulled pike up to the upper teens, and smallmouth over 5 lbs, as wellas nice walleye (our biggest was 4 lbs, but many come in over 10lbs);though we just keep the small ones for fish frys.This is a quality camp cut out of the bush just a few years ago,with outstanding owners that run a family based operation. Good luckin your search."

522887,Guest,2002-07-26 20:16:00,0,We always drive in go as far as we can drive then take the quads with the boats or canoe and ride them as far as they will go then put into river lake systems and sometimes go overland with an inflatable--GREAT fishing
