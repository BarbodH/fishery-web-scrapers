Do you have to buy from beer store or do other business' carry beer also. Any information including hours and locations of stores would be much appreciated.Thanks,Larry"

Beer is also sold at the Liquor Control Board of Ontario but selection is not great or it is only premium beers. Jay"
522812,Guest,2002-07-24 21:25:00,0,"You can only buy beer from these 3 stores : ""The Beer Store"" , ""The Brewers Retail"" or ""The L.C.B.O."" (liquor store). Business hours vary from store to store, but the 31st is a Wednesday, so I'm positive they're open until 9 and I'm almost positive they're open until 10pm. They open for business at 10am. Good Drinkin'!"
