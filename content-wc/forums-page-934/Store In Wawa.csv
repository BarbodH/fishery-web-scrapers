522789,docIN,2002-07-23 13:57:00,120,Where's a good place to stay???Nothing fancy but clean and near a place to get a bite to eat.Thanks.
522790,Guest,2002-07-23 19:45:00,0,I love that store. They sell awesome fudge. They also have the best selection on jigheads and bodies. I always drag my husband in there when we go fishing in Wawa.

Kinda like a museum. Take a few minutes to check it out. Interesting set of old chastity belts in one section:o. Pickles out of the barrel. Have fun!Tim"

All kinds of lures, live baits, licenses, clothing ... basically, everything that you realized you forgot after 100 miles into the trip. Also, they give a VERY fair exchange rate on US $. It's almost what the international money markets indicate as the exchange rate."
