I crossed in May with a group of 6 vehicles and had absolutely no problems, nobody in our group has ever had an OWI though. I would have to say that most of the border guards were even more courteous than usual. I cross 2-3 times per year and have almost always had no problems, so maybe I just don't fit the profile of the people they are looking for."
