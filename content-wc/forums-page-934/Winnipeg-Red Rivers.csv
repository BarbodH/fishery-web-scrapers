Anything change with the netting/commercial fishing. I had heard discussion of buying back rights, etc.2. How has the fishery and forage been this summer3. Water levels4. Predictions for the fall fishing.Pine Falls in October is my favorite place on earth! We're headed up later this year to try and avoid the crowds a little more.Todd"

Forage base sounds very good by the reports I get from guides on the lower Red River, the fish look nice and chubby.Flows on most streams in southeastern Manitoba continue to be at or well above the upper decile condition. Flows of this magnitude are not expected to occur more than once every ten years during the summer. Some streams such as the Winnipeg River and the Roseau River are at all time highs for this time of year. The Red River is not at an all time high at the present time but may be a week from now when the next crest arrives from the United States. The long duration of high summer flows (i.e. the flow volume) is an all time summer record for the Red River. Flows on the Winnipeg River are presently at the crest while flows on the Roseau River continue to decline slowly. Flows on the Red River at Ste. Agathe are expected to rise to near 40,000 cfs when the crest arrives around July 22. This forecast is based on normal precipitation for the next few weeks.Red River near Lockport. http://www.gov.mb.ca/natres/watres/charts/lockport.gifWinnipeg River below Slave Falls.http://www.gov.mb.ca/natres/watres/c...slavefalls.gifLink to weekly updates on lake levals.http://www.gov.mb.ca/natres/watres/river_report.html Backwater Eddy...><sUMo>"

522753,Todd_NE,2002-07-26 06:56:00,1330,"True Stories,1. A few years ago we were up on the Red with a group of people and I mentioned to Rob to come over for Steak, Wine, Kokanee, etc (We have a kind of celebratory supper every year) and he asked if we were going to grill the steaks. I said yup, we just bring up a few small charcoal grills. Next thing I know Rob says don't haul that stuff ten hours, I got you covered. Here comes Rob with a van filled with a big grill... what a guy :)2. On our last day there a few years ago we were leaving the main Selkirk boat ramp about noon and it was packed. The four launch ramp docks were covered with boats that wouldn't run, waiting for the driver, etc. All of the other boats from my party had loaded and I along with about 20 other boats were trying to load out, a huge line was trying to also launch. A young kid from our party had went to get my suburban to load me, unfortunately he couldn't get anyone to move enough to let him back in the water and some rough characters on the dock were yelling at him and cussing him out for general purposes about using ""their"" ramp. Let's just say that ""Hockey Rob"" took care of the situation.... I'm still chuckling.3. The guy gave me pearl shad raps, I water up just thinking about it two 14# fish later.4. He puts up with us camo wearing fiberglass driving ""you alls"".Cya Oct 19-23 this year buddy.Todd"
