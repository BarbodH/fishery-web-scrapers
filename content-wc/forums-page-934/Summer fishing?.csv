Always worried about bugs, slow fishing, heat and more BUGS.Good things about after June is : easier to get accomodations, sometimes cheaper rates, not as crowded, etc.Let's hear from some of you mid summer fishermen, good and bad results.:)"

Mosquitos and black flies were still plentiful but really only a problem at the loading dock (a protected bay). Indeed, I didn't apply bug repellant once, after we left the loading dock.What constitutes successful (good) fishing trips is different for everybody. Some measure success solely by size and numbers of walleye caught. Personally, comraderie with the guys I'm with, good accommodations and equipment, and lots of fun make fishing trips successful for me. Sure, I like to catch fish. But give me a couple of meals of fresh walleye and I don't need to come home with a limit to be happy.Weather (and its impacts) combined with individual fishing prowess can impact fishing trips as well. For instance, this year's late Mayfly hatch did impact fishing (many walleyes were suspended from 12-16 feet in the water column (22 feet) and they were uninterested in anything we presented).For the last 30 years, early and mid May has been reserved for speckle trout fishing. Consequently, walleye fishing had to come later. Jay"

We figure we caught slightly over 500 walleye in eight days. We grab a bagel and usually hit the lake between 6 and 7 am and return for breakfast around 11 am. Rest till about 4 or 5 and stay out till about 10 or 11 pm. So that would be 10 to 12 hours on the lake a day between fishing and boat riding.I have been to Canada every week from the last week of May till first week of October and we prefer the last week of June or the first week of July.Always catch plenty for us anyway. We don't usually get into many big pike at that time but do real well on numbers of walleye. One year the first week of July I caught 8 pike between 8 and 12 lbs. Not trophies but alot of fun to catch.We have found the end of June first of July the water hasn't hit its highest temperatures for the summer, the days are the longest and the bugs have normally been tolerable.Good Luck and Be Careful!!"

522762,porcupine,2002-07-26 04:53:00,9,"Five good reasons to be up North in July or August-1. Bugs...what bugs?2. I can leave my parka at home.3. If it gets too hot, I can jump overboard and cool off.4. If the fishings is really bad, I pull out the clubs and hit the links for a round.5. If there is a beach nearby the scenery is better."
