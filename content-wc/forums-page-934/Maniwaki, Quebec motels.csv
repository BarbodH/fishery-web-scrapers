We are planning to drive 500 miles to Maniwaki and spend the night at a motel buy leeches in the morning before driving to the lodge. Any information on motels, if any, in Maniwaki would be appreciated. Also the location of any bait stores that sell leeches and prices would be helpful. Will post a report on Berthelot Lake upon our return.Thanks"
