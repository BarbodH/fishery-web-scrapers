Ask your ""better half"" when a polite good looking man in skimpy cutoffs goes by would she view the assets or ignore them....make sure shes being honest. I have witnessed first hand a pile of ladies with male strippers and they are as friskey as men can be................"

522784,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-07-24 19:48:00,618,"Thought you were asking about stripers at first glance. Oh well, the strippers are easier to come by and look better."

522785,Guest,2002-07-24 23:50:00,0,"This afternoon, while I was working in the front yard, an exceptional young lady in a halter top and short shorts walked by. She looked, I smiled and nodded, she gave a quick smile and kept on with her power walk. There came a catty remark from elsewhere in the yard (guess who). Well I ain't dead yet, and even though I am a grandfather, I still will be distracted by certain sights. If the ""better half"" (sometimes I wonder about the better part) would strip down and party more often, maybe I wouldn't be tempted to look as much as I do."
