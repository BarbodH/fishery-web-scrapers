Lots of walleyes, but not great size. A few in the 3# class but most smaller, but lots of them. Good Northern fishing also. The company I work for takes a group up every year to one of Amiks camps and generally is very pleased. Sometimes the fishing is slow if weather is not favorable, but where isn't that the case. I'd give them a thumbs up."
