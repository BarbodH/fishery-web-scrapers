522955,Guest,2002-07-26 20:39:00,0,Our party is going to Green's Outpost Camp on Birch Lake the 2nd week in August. We know nothing about the lake. Anxious to have a good First time trip for a couple of kids we would like to convert to serious walleye fishermen. Any info would be appreciated. Thanks. Bill
