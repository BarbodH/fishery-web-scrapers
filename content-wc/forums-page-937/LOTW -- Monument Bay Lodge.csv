We are interested in a combination walleye and smallmouth trip. Any comments or recommendations will be appreciated. Thanks, Jacksalmon."

The lodge is located perfectly in this area for lots of opportunities with walleyes, smallies, pike, and of course muskies. We hit the smallies right on the head a couple years ago in mid-june. We boated well over 100 smallies a day with plenty big girls to boot right in Monument Bay. All these fish were released. Walleyes were moving to the reefs from the sand points and shorelines. July has been our best month for big walleyes though. If you have never been in this area before, it is beautiful country. We have never stayed at the Bay Lodge there though. Sorry I do not have any info there for you.Good Luck and have fun."
