521290,Guest,2002-07-11 20:39:00,0,Fished Lac Des Mille Lacs several times this year with pretty good luck. Lots of rain one trip (three days straight). Last trip it got really hot especially on 27th of June. Stayed at Seine River Resort. Not happy with last trip at that particular resort. Could anyone send me the address and/or phone number for Lac De Mille Lacs resort you mentioned. Do they have a website? Thanks for any help. Have had great times on that flowage over the years.Please email and I will watch this forum[email protected]

521282,Guest,2002-06-10 13:39:00,0,"Hi Fellow fisherman, I am wondering if anyone has been fishing this lake recently. I will be headed that way in a couple of weeks and would like a report. Any hot spots or tactics that worked for those elusive walleyes? I just love the sport of fishing and can't wait to get there. Any advice would be appreciated. Rich"
521283,tracker,2002-06-11 08:57:00,91,"Was on Lac on Sunday. Due to the weather system that moved in fishing was a little slow. Heavy rains at times and high winds from the east sure slowed the fisherman down. Only seen two boats out from Sawmill Bay to hook Island. Majority of fish caught were in deep water with jigs tipped with minnows. Picked up a few trolling raps, but not nice when the waves were starting to come over the bow."

521286,Drake,2002-06-18 08:05:00,37,"Rich I got back from Lac Des Mille Lac Lodge Saturday the 16th, my 22nd year of fishing out of this lodge. Fishing was very good numerous 3 to 4 lb walleyes which we released. Fished around Bull Island /Honneken Narrows and Blind bay area most of the week. Found walleyes holding in 10 to 12 foot of water, wherever there was mud was the most productive with a 1/8 oz jig and minnow. Good luck the rain Monday raised the lake but didnt slow the fishing down."
521287,Guest,2002-06-18 13:38:00,0,"Thanks, Drake I will be headed up there in a couple of weeks. I will be sure to try some of your locations. Thanks again and if anyone else has a report on the fishing at this lake, please post it. Keep your lines wet and your shorts dry, Rich"

521293,Guest,2002-07-07 06:47:00,0,"Hi All, Just got back yesterday....Had a great time...Weather was a little warm and the mosquitoes were swarming. Those army worms and flies were around, but they didn't create much of a problem. Caught tons of walleyes on crawler harnesses. Flashy gold blades worked the best. My wife out fished me by a ratio of 4 to 1. I had to control the boat and take off the fish. We caught most of our fish in the Honkeken Narrows. Pardon the spelling, trying to use my failing memory. Also caught a few and the biggest around the little island north of Owl Island. Worms out fished minnows this time up. The last day we fished for northerns with mepps spinners in Maze Bay. What a blast. Caught tons of hammer-handles and again the wife caught the biggest one of her fishing life. When the wife is happy, I am happy! Good fishing and practice C&R, Rich"
