522370,Bryan,2002-07-15 22:34:00,244,Dan:What part of the lake ar you going to be fishing? The lake is all but full this year and the bite is starting to pick up now. West end near Sask. Landing is still a bit stained from the inflow from the river but should be O.K. next week. I'm heading over there next week myself for vacation with the family and to prefish for the Landing tournament which is on July 27 and 28.
