We haven't made any plans for next year yet. We were thinking of going up towards chamberlain narrows to get closer to the better muskie waters and still have the walleye. Mahkwa is a great place to be since great fishing is right around the corner.I may book a trip there and take 2 of my sons with, we'll see.You been out on Erie since you got back? I have hardly been out. Was invited up to Mille Lacs this weekend but that didn't even appeal to me after the Seul trip.Take care,Dave"

Was not sad to see the trip end though. It was hard enough just standing up let alone reel in some fish. Did manage a couple of Steelhead in the short time we were out. Another Fact Finding trip out on the big pond coming up Thursday morn. Wednesday nite its the Indians - Twins game. Tonight I make my sign for Bert to Circle me!Spike"
