522419,Guest,2002-07-12 10:17:00,0,I will be going up there in a week or so and I am just curious if anyone has ever fished for walleyes with planer boards and stick baits? Anyone had any success with this method? just trying to find out if it is worth wile hauling all that extra gear up there. Thanks for the input!
522420,Reels,2002-07-12 10:40:00,2876,"Yep, works great this time of year up by big sand.Rapala's seem to be the local favorite.<{{}}><"
522421,iamwalleye1,2002-07-12 14:01:00,1589,"I would not leave home without them! I have found that rapala's pearl white #9 work great. Also clown in the #9. We troll every night for about an hour or two and get some very nice fish 21"" -25"". We land about 6 to 10 fish a night. Good luck"
522422,Guest,2002-07-12 14:36:00,0,"Thanks guys for the input! Looks like I will be bringing it up. Any suggestions on the area I should fish? Depth? Im guessing try to find some humps or rock bars out there huh? Also I have lots of Bomber Long A lures that I troll with out in Lake Superior. Do you think these will work same as rapalas? They are the 4 1/2"" verity and dive about 7 feet when trolled. Thanks for the help! Remember Catch and Release! Tight lined and bent rods!"
522423,iamwalleye1,2002-07-12 14:43:00,1589,I have found them up in big sand lake! Look for the schools of bait fish on your graph. Try 75'-100' back off you boards. You can troll in a triangle from green to burnt then towards the humps. You might try your other baits but always bring a pearl white#9!
522425,Guest,2002-07-12 20:10:00,0,"We go up to Minaki every year in late July and/or early August. We also spend that last couple of hours of each evening trolling up in Big Sand. The fish you will be after are suspended between 30' and 10' in 75' to 100' feet of water.There will plenty of boats doing the same, but it's a huge area and the traffic is not a problem. If you have a marine radio you can tune in and listen to everyone share info and brag about their current catch. ""Fish On"" will be followed shortly the the length of the catch and what lure it was caught on. It really can become quite a show.Some years the deep running lures (Reef Runners, Thundersticks etc.) seem to work better, other years more shallow running lures seem to work best. I would say that the #9 rapala seems to consistantly be a favorite. Last year our best lure was a Mann's Stretch 15+ Grey Ghost.Also, some years planer boards seem to help, but others it doesn't. We have had consistantly good luck using this method for the last 4 or 5 year's now. We have also used the same technique early in the morning with good success, especially after a hot evening bite.We go up this year the last week in July. Hope you have good luck and be sure and post how you do. I'll be anxious for a report about the time you get back."
522426,Guest,2002-07-14 08:24:00,0,"More ? about trolling.#9 Rapala's are 3 1/2 inches long.Seems kind of small to us musky fisherman.With 75 to 100' of line out,how deep do they go?Will wally come up a long ways for them?Do you use the floaters or supenders?or deep divers?Are low light conditions pretty much the only time they hit?Is mid day a waste of time?I'll be there aug 16-26.Thanks"
522427,Guest,2002-07-14 12:01:00,0,"Some people spend most of their day trolling, but most seem to do like us, bottom bounce during the day and troll in the evening (and sometimes early morning.) During the daylight hours I don't see people trolling the deep water for suspended fish, but sometimes I see people trolling the humps in 20-40 ft surrounded by the 100 foot depths. I can't say how well this works because we have never given it a try. If you've never been to Minaki before, I would strongly recommend that you get some type of a contour map of the lake to help you locate some of the many humps up in the big lake. Many will have boats sitting on them by mid-morning, but there are plenty that don't often get fished. Like most people that have been there before, we've got our favorites that we tend to return to year after year. A GPS unit sure helps us to locate the humps we've marked in previous years.We spend the rest of our time bottom bouncing, usually with leeches or nightcrawlers, using about 1 oz. of lead and a 4-5 foot leader off the bouncer. This seems to be our most productive method of fishing the often snaggy humps up in big sand.I don't have my precision trolling book handy, but I would guess that the #9 shad raps get down around 15 feet, maybe a little deeper if you use fireline (or whiplash which I prefer.) Depth doesn't seem to be real critical when fishing these suspended fish, you just figure out a pattern or lure that works well and it will most likely be the same the rest of the week. We usually have at least 3 people in our boat and all start off with different types of lures then everyone tends to gravitate toward what seems to be working best.We also like to spend at least 1/2 - 1 day casting for northerns up in the bays off the river channel. Last year we got two 37's and a 34, plus lots of 20-28 inchers in less than a days outing. We often do this if the wind kicks up really hard and we don't want to fight the waves up on Big Sand. Hot-N-Tots (1/2 oz size) work real well for this. We've never tried for muskie, but a lot of people do and claim to catch them.Hope this helps. Good luck and leave a few for us!"

522428,Reels,2002-07-15 15:16:00,2876,"Sometimes you can get them durring the day, but they really turn on in the evening.The fish will come up and hit #7's. I have run deep divers and even downriggers to get to 30'+ but didnt seem to make that big of a difference.<{{}}><"
