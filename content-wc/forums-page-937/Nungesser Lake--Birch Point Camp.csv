Boats and motors clean and dependable. We caught lots of walleye on jigs and minnows with most being 15-17 inches, but lots a lot bigger. Several days of dozens of fish three to seven pounds. Lots of pike with three over 24lbs last year. Looking forward to next Spring already.LOLGary B"

When I was there 4 and 5 years ago Nungesser Lake Lodge looked to be the newer of the 2 with newer boats and motors. Really liked the Lake, August is supposed to be prime topwater and big northern season according to the owners.. I was there at an unusual time, opening week May 15 and it was 100 degrees out and water was 70 degrees, also early June with Hot weather. Both times fishing was decent, but not as good as a normal weather pattern would have brought.. The Lake can get rough at times and Birch Point and Nungesser are located on the east end. To venture into new water you may have to cross some wavy open water to get there.. Be careful and have fun.. Did you know Nungesser has produced some of the Largest pike in Ontario?? Good Luck and let me know how you do and like facilities I am considering August of 2003."

521618,2746,2002-07-16 12:34:00,3206,"Fished there several years up to about 5 years ago when I began going with a different group and thus a different lake. George and Connie Green (assume they still own the camp) run a good camp and they built it themselves years ago when they first got started. Son is involved with them now (or at least was 5 years ago) Good walleye lake and great for pike. The time of year youe going is when we were usually there and walleys will be schooled up in 10-15 feet of water off most rocky points. Basic tactics of jigs and minnows or spiiners worked well for us. Had not started trolling cranks at that time but expect that would work to.Relatively shallow lake with lots of Islands and points and not particullarly hard to fish. Have given all my maps away but if you had one I could mark from memory, E-mail [email protected]George knows the lake well but not a big talker...may have to work on him to get help. Son would be much more open...might even go out with you one day to help find locations. A pretty boat ride into camp and,in my opinion, you've chosen the best camp on Nungesser. Feel free to contact me for more specific info."
