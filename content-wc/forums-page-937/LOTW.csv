522457,GrandPops_IA,2002-07-14 19:28:00,7,"7/14/02 Just got back from LOTW yesterday. Even though the water is very high we had GREAT fishing. Caught alot of fish every time we went out. Alot of 1-2 pounders. My wife got a 5 pounder and Father-in-law got a 4 pounder. Fished Sabaskong Bay area reefs and made a couple trips up to Firebag. Wife has a 5 year old drunk driving charge and we had no problem getting into Canada. I was driving. Just got asked the standard questions and told to have a good time and we were on our way. We crossed at Baudette, Minnesota.Keep Your Rod Bent !!GrandPopsKeep Your Rod Bent !!GrandPops"

Going to a boat-in resort 25 miles NW of Morson (just North of Big Island), but we have fished as far East as Firebag before. Are the fish on the shallow reefs that top out 8-10'? Did you fish any deep reefs or shoreline? Live bait, or cranks? Any further info or areas near Firebag to try would be appreciated. Thanks again.Fuzz"
522459,GrandPops_IA,2002-07-15 07:33:00,7,We fished the shallow reefs. Some topped out at 6 ft.Used leeches mostly. Caught some on minnows but best was the leeches. Used red jigs. Fish seemed to be in the 8-15 ft range. Got most on the drop after going over the top of the reef. The fish were bitting short so you may want to use a stinger.Keep Your Rod Bent !!GrandPops
