I've noticed that we will usually catch fish during 3 to 5 ish pm and there will be next to no action at other times. Comments/Suggestions?? Thanks!"
522107,tracker,2002-07-03 07:42:00,91,"I find that every lake has it's own time that the fish will feed, some lakes the fish will bite all day. Water clarity definetely plays a key part in their feeding times. Weather can also turn the feed on or off quickly. I suggest if you are a beginner to buy your self a good walleye book (not a fishing magazine) and read it a few times."
522108,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-05 08:34:00,6,You might also want to check out the video stores for instructional videos on fishing. There are many factors that contribute to catching fish and time of the day is in my estimation way down the list on success ratings.
522109,BD,2002-07-07 13:06:00,739,"Sorry to disagree with you Wacker but the time of day does matter. Fish can be caught at any time of the day but the bite changes with the clock. I didn't believe the Solunar Tables etc. at first but kept track of the bluegill and crapie bite on the small lake behind the farm and the eye bite on Bago, LOW etc. The tables can give you a very good idea of when the fishing will be the best. Field and Stream has the Solunar Tables every two months (check the upcoming Aug issue) and there is a similar system in Outdoor Life that I haven't compared to the Solunar Tables. Casio also makes a best fishing times watch that appears to be accurate. ""The year 1935 will go down in history. For the first time a civilized nation has full gun registration.

522110,cowenc,2002-07-09 06:24:00,3,"Correct me if I am wrong as I am a beginner. I read couple of books and both indicated morning and late afternoon is usually the best time for fishing (most active anyways). I tried a few lakes -> Simcoe, Chemong, and sealee's bay in Kingston. The best time is usually 8 to 11, and 3 to 5. I guess that's the best fishing time for beginners like me!"
522112,Guest,2002-07-09 18:58:00,0,"A few years ago while fishing in a lake in Quebec, a couple of guests went out each evening at sundown and fished walleye at night. They'd evidently read in some book that walleye were nocturnal feeders. Or maybe that's the way they did it back home. They ended up catching half as many fish (and drinking twice as much beer) as everyone else in camp. The moral of the story is that, while walleye do have certain tendancies, the successful angler will experiment. As for time of day: You'll only catch fish if your bait's in the water. Some of our best bites have come at midday under bright sun when other fishermen were back at the shack watching Oprah."
522111,BD,2002-07-14 23:55:00,739,"There are four periods each day in which the fish are more active. The times change each day the same way the tides do with changes in the position of the sun and moon. I have sat and watched a bobber for over an hour without a nibble. Then had a hard time keeping it in the water when the gills started up right on the Solunar Tables schedule. I caught my biggest eye (13 3/4 lbs) before I knew about the Tables, but when I checked back, the eyes I caught that night on the lake was right in step with the best times prediction. Check out the next issue of Field and Stream and compare the bite with the Tables. You may be suprised. Weather changes, changes in clarity etc. also have a great deal of influence on fish behavior but it's hard to predict a cold front two months or more in advance."
522113,retire55,2002-07-15 05:11:00,1029,"Hi Beginner:Our group just returned home from a weeks walleye fishing. Our experience this year, regarding best fishing times, coincided with our experience in past years (same lake). That being that the walleye bite was more predominate sometime during early morning (5 to 9 AM) and sometime during the end of daylight period (7 to 10 PM). Of course, we have caught walleyes at other times but the predominate bite was when I stated.And I concur with other respondents here about how weather impacts fishing. We just experienced another impact last week, that being the late Mayfly hatch. Consequently, many walleyes were suspended anywhere between 8 and 16 feet in water approximately 20 feet deep. Neither trolling crankbaits off line counter reels or slip bobbering could entice these walleyes. I also concur with the advice to experiment. There are no hard and fast rules and one has to remain flexible to optimize one's success. Jay"
