522433,Guest,2002-07-13 11:02:00,0,One case per person or one liter of liquor per person
522434,Stillwater,2002-07-13 12:25:00,87,"Ross,Hugh is right, 1 case or 1 Liter per (adult)person. That is duty free. If you want to take more across, you can. You just have to pay the fee. The fee is based on how much the case cost you stateside, so if you do decide to take more, save your receipt, Customs will ask you how much it cost. I always take across 1 extra case of beer and tell Customs it was 12.00 and they charge me 7.00 duty (which is about right). The other option is to make another stop on the other side of the border and buy a case of beer which cost about 21.00 (roughly), so I have found it's cheaper to take across my own personal preference and save 1 stop. You never know if the people in the cabin next door to you are going to run out (and offer you $) or who you are going to run into on the lake and invite back to the cabin for a beer. It's nice to have a little extra. Also, I have had resort owners offer to take it off my hands when we were leaving (and deduct $25.00) dollars from my bill. Worst case is, if you don't drink it, bring it back with you, anything you brought in with you, you can bring back. Just don't be shortsighted."
522435,Guest,2002-07-14 07:03:00,0,"StillwaterI'd check on that bringing back beer into the states. We tried to bring back about a 12 pack between two of us once and were told by customs that each person is allowed 1 liter of alcholic beverage. Period. Doesn't matter if its 1 liter of whiskey or 1 liter of beer. This was a few years ago and we quit bringing anything back. Darn, we had to drink it all up there. Maybe things have changed but I'd check with customs first."
522436,Stillwater,2002-07-14 08:29:00,87,"MK,I know how it is having to drink it all, it's tough, BUT, someone has to do it.Seriously, if the brew you are bringing back is Pabst or Miller or Bud. U.S. Customs knows you purchased it in the states. I hang onto my receipt from canadian customs to prove that I brought it in, and paid the duty on it.I have only had to show Canadian customs a receipt 1 time in the last 15 years to show purchase price, #####, they know what a case of Pabst cost, so you can't BS them. My understanding is that when coming back through U.S.Customs they are asking about any beer/liquor (or anything else) ""purchased"" in canada. And even then, you are allowed 1 case or 1 liter/quart. I have crossed from Minnesota to Canada, and back, at I-Falls, Pigeon River and Warroad in the past 3 years and it's pretty easy."
522437,Jigger1,2002-07-14 09:11:00,234,Crossed the border on July 3rd. Four guys in my truck = four cases of beer for me ... love my Crystal!
522438,Guest,2002-07-14 10:04:00,0,"Common sense would dictate that if we can take one liter or one case north, we should be able to do the same coming south, but there is one customs agent in Int. Falls that believes otherwise. When he asked us about alcohol, we said we had 10 or 12 cans in the cooler. He made us count the cans left in the cooler and let us know in no uncertain terms that the law states: One liter of alcoholic beverage. One liter of Bud or one liter of pure grain alcohol (his words). Didn't matter to him. We offered to throw away the excess, offending cans but he said he would let us by that day. What a nice guy. He risked his job for us and our surplus 6 pack.However insane it sounds, what he said seems to be supported in the customs regs: http://www.customs.ustreas.gov/travel/travel.htmMost people have probably not encountered our buddy, the border patrol version of Barney Fife, but don't be suprised is sometime you do. We have no plans to travel north this year but if someone else does, maybe they should ask to be sure. Or, just drink it all and not worry about it, our standard operating procedure in the future."
