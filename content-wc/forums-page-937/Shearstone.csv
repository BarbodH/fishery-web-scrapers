Rick"
521988,WillieB,2002-06-29 13:25:00,292,"Rick Please send me an e-mail and fill me in. Those folks (Canadian Fly-InFishing with Lac Seul Airways/Amik Outposts are near the top of my short list for next year, and I came REAL close to booking Shearstone ""What dreams are made of"" with them this year. I'd truly appreciate it."
521989,Guest,2002-06-29 16:28:00,0,I also would like to know what caused the poor fishing conditions.Did the weather condition have an effect on the fishing? We were also thinking of going to Shearstone. We have gone with Amik in past years and have been very pleased.
521990,Guest,2002-06-30 05:24:00,0,"the weather was just fine 3days of 80 degrees, the lake is mostly about 7 feet deep all over with the exeption of a few deep spots we only found 1 sunken island and thats were we caught the bulk of our fish, we were happy with the outfitter as far as being prompt with the flights and the cabin was in great shape but i would not go back to that lake again rick"
521991,WillieB,2002-06-30 08:46:00,292,"Doesn't quite sound like the ""What dreams are made of"" promtional flier that they sent out with their brochure this year. Seems to have fallen a bit short of the test harvest reports stated. Would've thought results would've been better for a virgin, untapped lake.Sorry to hear about your disappointment, and many thanks for the heads-up."
521992,Guest,2002-06-30 13:06:00,0,"forgot to mention that we caught 2 taged fish the tag # were 816 and 817 we thought that was kind of odd. also I, am not trying to run down down the otfitter just making a honest report of what we did thanks Rick"
521993,phishfearme,2002-07-15 08:17:00,1242,"ric - your report was really disturbing. my group spent 10 days fishing shearstone in 2000 - portaging up from brownstone lake everyday - before the cabin was built - and had the best walleye and pike fishing ever - and we've been going to different places for over 25 years. it really was what dreams are made of. we wondered, though, what the impact would be of being fished everyday since the lake is so shallow and relatively small. sorry to hear about your poor time. another friend of mine was up at shearstone two weeks ago and i get a report from him and post it.phish"
