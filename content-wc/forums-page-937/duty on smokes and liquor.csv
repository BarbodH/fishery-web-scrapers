522252,Guest,2002-07-07 13:30:00,0,does anyone know what the duty would be on a bottle of booze and an extra carton of smokes. Is it still better to pay the duty or buy it in Canada. thanks for any info.
522253,Guest,2002-07-07 18:45:00,0,Bring your own smokes and buy the Canadian booze. Its better than the US stuff and a lot stronger. The dollars figure is close to the same. Canadians like Americans who support the local economy.
522254,phishfearme,2002-07-15 08:09:00,1242,duty is based on a percentage of what you paid for the stuff. bring a receipt. the duty is nominal but the delay is not usually worth it.
