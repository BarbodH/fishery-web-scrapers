Rotatilled the garden June 1 and slipped 2 disks in the old back, have been bed ridden for 6 weeks but on the mend. I called the lodge and they have openings mid August to mid Sept. and will reschedule in that time frame upon doctors ok. I would appreciate information and advice from anyone who has been there. The lodge claims the 68 miles of dirt road out of Sennetere is good, any first hand info would help the old back! With the help of pain pills,celebrex and theraphy I'll make this fishing trip and post a report when I get back.Thanks in advanceJerry"

This may help make the road easier. i cannot think of the name of this product, but can get it for you when I go to work tommorow. As far as the road, I havent been down the penetration road for a few years. My recolection is that the first third was a big wide logging road. There was a bit of washboard but not bad. The last third was not bad either, not real wide but reasonable. The middle third was not so good, but at the show this spring they told me this section is new and tracks south of the original road. I'm glad to hear they rescheduled you. Again, heal quickly, Rich"
