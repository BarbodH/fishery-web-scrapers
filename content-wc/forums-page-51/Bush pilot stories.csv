6647796,vteye3,2022-04-14 07:21:00,496,"I have about 26 bush flights so far and 10 transports by boat. I will share a favorite of each. My first trip in what was then called Northwest territories of Canada (Baffin Island) now called Nunavut involved a 50 mile journey via a 22 foot freighter canoe between Pangnirtung and Clearwater Fiord in a WNW direction. It was last week in July 1984 and sea ice was late in clearing out. Our first nation guide zig zagged around ice for 50 miles. My most recent trip departing the Mulchatna river in AK (third week in August) found unusually low water levels. Typically August is the wet season and rivers refill after dropping throughout the summer. Our pilot arrived and was not happy about low water levels. He said the river was down 2 feet from his last visit. He predicted we were going to get stuck. WTH I don't pilots whom are not 3 c's: cool, calm, collective. Sure enough we immediately got stuck. We departed the plane mid river and pushed while on full throttle. Ever been outside in a hurricane? We moved the plane only to get stuck again. Second time i was holding both 200 pound rafts in knee deep water as my son and cousin pushed. My cousin lifted the tail and plane broke free. The final attempt allowed us to break free after some serious pucker factor."

About 10 minutes into the 30-minute flight we noticed the right wing propeller stopped spinning. After exchanging panicked expressions we saw the pilot was mildly busy. He feathered the prop, chatted a few words on the radio he turned around to us and calmly mentioned, “Lost an engine, eh?” We scrambled in our seats for a few minutes packing swiss army knives, lighters and whatever survival gear we could reach. After an uneventful 10 minutes of staring at the immobile prop, we nodded off.We calmed down until we approached Winnipeg International airport. The runway was lined with emergency vehicles – just like in the movies. Fear resumed. Meh – the pilot landed the plane as smoothly as can be. No biggie. Gotta love those bush pilots."
6648246,@Lunker,2022-04-15 16:22:00,835,"Gotta be some 25 years ago, four of us were headed out of Armstrong to Wabikimi. Our pilot was a fetching young lady in her 20s. I drew the co-pilot’s seat. As she took her seat, she tossed a topo map in my lap and said “Here, you keep track of where we are.”I’m sure my eyes got a bit bigger as I puckered a bit and thought “SAY WHAT?!?!” My confidence in her was momentarily in question until she explained that she had to fly an unplanned serpentine route because there were so many forest fires and wanted a back-up keeping track of our location. We even had to land on a lake enroute and wait a bit for the smoke to clear. Dang if she didn’t hit the bullseye without any help from me. And my finger arrived at the destination on the map just as she began her final descent. We both knew where we were. Parenthetically, we were never directly in danger from any of the fires. But every afternoon during our stay, about 2:00 or so, the sky would get hazy and it would begin lightly snowing ash around us."
6648252,sheepman,2022-04-15 17:19:00,98,"My first trip was from Red lake to bull moose camp in 1983, never been on a bush plane and no concept of how long we would be in the air. A young man in ripped up tennis shoes was helping us load and after we were loaded up jumped into the plane and started it. I thought GREAT he is warming it up for the pilot, NO! he jumped in and WAS the pilot! We taxi out to the middle of the lake in dense fog and have the engines going at full tilt and plane not moving!!! I asked what was going on and he replied he had to roughen up the water before we took off or the pontoons would be sucked under, needless to say I am now wondering why I came on this trip! We finally took off and I didn't know if we would clear the forest but we did, rose above the fog and were cruising, how long I didn't know, after quite awhile he started pawing around and asked if I could find him the map!!!! I did and thought we were dead! Eventually we started to descend and broke through the clouds to find us over the lake and camp within sight!!! Whew!!! Not over yet last night myself and another decided to help a group from Minnesota polish off a bottle of Windsor, next day on flight out between turbulance, garbage and diesel stench thought I was going to lose it until my partner in crime grabbed my boots and buried his head in them, snapped me out of it! He on the other hand was so sick he could not stand on the dock had to lay on the ground. That is my first rip experience, been back many times, good memories!!!"
6648256,Eckohlt,2022-04-15 17:32:00,3685,"Could have been worse,she could have said you take wheel."
6648258,maddogg,2022-04-15 17:42:00,178,"We were fishing on Mascara lake when a plane landed and taxied near our dock. The pilot got on the pontoon and yelled ""Is this tully Lake?""We told him no it was Mascara. He said OK and left. We all wondered if his passengers were worried about his ability find them in a week. We all had a good laugh.Well he only missed be 23 miles."
6648308,dschiebel,2022-04-16 02:33:00,85,"I think I can beat that. First fly in trip, I get the co pilot seat, 2 brothers and a friend are in the back. Pilot is pretty old 70ish. We have to fly about 1hour and 15 mins to the cabin. About 1/2 hour in the pilot reaches in his jacket and pulls out a pint of dark whiskey, turns his head away from me, and takes a huge gulp. I was stunned, and just sat there staring out the side window. The pilot does this 3 or 4 more times, no longer hiding it from me. I look over at him and his head is kinda of slumped to side and appears to be having trouble staying awake. I cant take it anymore, so I tap his leg and said I don't think drinking is a good idea while flying, is so loud in the **** pit, but I finally thought I heard him say he has developed fear of heights a few years ago and booze helps him calm down. I look in back and see everybody just enjoying the flight. So I kinda yell that the pilot is drinking and appears drunk. They just ignore me. I hear a noise from the pilot and I thought he was snoring but his hand appears over his mouth and I think he going to throw up. He keeps turning his head away from me and I can see he has a throw up bag up to his mouth. I see his false teeth fly out of his mouth into the throw up bag and he keeps gagging. I yell towards the back that I think the pilot is sick. They just ignore me and appear to just enjoying the flight. I am so scared I almost crapped myself. The pilot is trying to put his teeth back in his mouth but is having a very hard time. The pilot then downs what ever whiskey was left in the pint. I then look in back and yell as loud as I can the pilot is fuc--- drunk and were all going to crash. They all look at me like I am crazy and then break into a hysterical laugh. I look at the pilot and he is laughing so hard his teeth fell out again. Well as you can guess it was all a set up diet coke in the whiskey bottle everybody in on the joke. Everybody is laughing so hard they are crying. When we land the pilot said he almost pissed himself during the stunt looking at me, and trying not to laugh. Well all I can say is payback is a bitc--"
6648310,Juls,2022-04-16 03:01:00,13414,OMG....I think I would have reacted exactly like you did! Glad it was all a prank though. Thanks for sharing your funny story.
6648336,pjshorthorn,2022-04-16 06:03:00,5654,You still on speaking terms with those fellas.... Great story. PjShorthorn
6648340,That Minnesota guy,2022-04-16 06:12:00,8293,One of the highlights of my life was my first float plane ride. Landing on a river in Alaska at a Salmon fishing camp. The memory will be with me forever.
6648346,Eckohlt,2022-04-16 06:25:00,3685,Did ya catch any?
6648354,pjshorthorn,2022-04-16 07:00:00,5654,"Flew into Lake Athabasca from the Stony Rapids float plane base. Was flown into the lodge by the owner at the time. Cliff was 81 years young at that time and sharp as could be. He flew us into another remote lake for a day of fishing. 4 flights with him were flawless. I just hope I'm upright at 81. The only hiccup during the trip is that Cliff had to fly down to Saskatoon for a doctor's appt. The night he left we had a huge blow come through and it knocked out all the power in camp. Thankfully, we had guests with engineering backgrounds ( Chemical, Mechanical and a Chief Engineer from the Navy.....what could go wrong ? Right? ) . In the morning everyone pitched in, found where a conduit stand pipe had rubbed through the power line and shorted out, fixed the standpipe, wrapped the power line and fired up the back up generator. Camp was back up and running and everyone had a hearty breakfast in the lodge . Best pike fishing trip I have ever been on and maybe will ever be on. Too many 40+ pike to remember what we caught as a group, let alone all guests combined. The largest that week was a 47 beast. PjShorthorn"
6649002,vteye3,2022-04-18 17:09:00,496,"Eck - I wasn't there but happy to answer. They caught a lot of fish, probably 5 species maybe double that. Fishing a remote Alaskan salmon river is ""bucket list"". We were picked up by a 20 year pilot on the Lower ""Tal"" an hour from Anchorage after an incredible float trip. Pilot pointed out a bunch of spruce just above the river bed. He said we are going to come real close to hitting that tree due to a severe cross wind. Sure enough he built up a lot of speed near the river prior to popping outta there into the crosswind. It felt like he was playing chicken"
6649014,Eckohlt,2022-04-18 17:42:00,3685,"Sounds like some great fishing,coming close to hitting some trees WELL that's another story."
6648326,ukats18,2022-04-16 05:35:00,4,"Ok, We are going to an outpost in Manitoba with myself, my Dad, his brother and son and 2 other fathers and their sons. Loaded with gear and a great deal of beer we start to take off. We go for a good bit at a speed that is steady but doesn’t seem to be enough to get off the water.The approaching shorelines and trees caused me to think, OK, we are going to have to go back to the dock and unload some beer.The pilot looks back at us and screams, “when I say when, lean forward!”, and then yells, “Now!”. We all go forward, and he yanks the stick to the right, and he gets 1 pontoon up, yanks it back to the left and the other comes up and we barely make it over the trees.He looks back and laughs with a thumbs up, while we were white as ghosts!Dave"
