6647754,pjshorthorn,2022-04-14 04:55:00,5654,Looks like seagull catching is not all that rare. Add me to that list too....he was a nasty bugger. PjShorthorn
6648002,bigwalleye1,2022-04-14 19:23:00,2632,Gulls seem to have a rather unpleasant way of showing their appreciation for you efforts in trying to free them. All I can say is be sure to hold them over the side of the boat.....
6648008,prov1800,2022-04-14 19:35:00,5010,Never seen a seagull that had a problem taking ƒèump period
6648128,Billswest,2022-04-15 09:15:00,32,"Many years ago while fishing from my canoe on a lake (?) not far from Rouyn, Quebec I made a long cast to the edge of a weed bed. As I started to reel in my large surface plug, Pikie Minnow, as I recall, an osprey swooped down and hit it. I watched her take off with the treble hook stuck in he talons. Once I came to my senses and realized she was hooked up I cut my line and off she flew. Never saw that bird again and long wondered how she made out. Most interesting ""catch"" I've ever made......."
6648144,Eckohlt,2022-04-15 09:54:00,3685,"I'm sure she's ok,but probably pissed off at you though,good thinking to cut the line as she probably would have spooled ya."
6648216,last chance,2022-04-15 13:34:00,3262,"I was salmon fishing at Manistee lake in Manistee Michigan. I was using a bit nut for weight about 5"" above my baited hook. someone in the boat yelled fish on. so the rest of us reeled our lines in so we wouldn't get tangled with his 20+# fish. I was fishing near shore near some weeds. as I reeled my nut and hook in it didn't feel right. as I got it close to the boat I noticed I had a nice 4 or 5-pound walleye on my hook. I got it in and the walleye had engulfed my sinker and hook."
6648226,Eckohlt,2022-04-15 14:37:00,3685,Wonder if it broke a tooth chewing on that sinker?
6648390,last chance,2022-04-16 08:07:00,3262,"I'm not sure, LOL. but the nut was flipping side to side and making a gurgling sound and action which i think triggered the strike."
6648432,PRO-V16,2022-04-16 10:30:00,454,We were fishing the south shore of LotW about a mile out and my buddy caught the plastic rear bumper cover from an SUV.
6649248,Rock Hound,2022-04-19 14:21:00,51,"I have caught bottles, cans, and of course tree branches, but the oddest catch I ever made was a Seagull! I cast a minnow out on a Lindy rig, and the Seagull came down and snatched the minnow in its mouth before my bait hit the water. I pulled back on my line, and although the minnow (and hook) pulled out of it's beak, the hook snagged the Seagull in the leg mid air and pulled it down to the water. I had to reel in the Seagull backwards! I thought it would try to beak the heck out of me when it got to the boat, but he seemed to be thankful and just let me unhook him and let him go!"
6647546,last chance,2022-04-13 10:32:00,3262,"I was fishing the Intracoastal under a bridge for grouper and drum in ft pierce fl when I caught a complete bicycle. I've caught many strange items in my 70 yrs including a snake, a frog, and a duck. Pelikan and many more things but the bicycle were the most memorable."
6647568,jambi,2022-04-13 11:53:00,504,"We've caught a few pike that have bit us off before, recovering our lost jigs. A couple times we've caught them with other peoples jigs in their mouths - rare chance on a flyout lake. But hey, thanks for the free gear."
6647580,Eckohlt,2022-04-13 12:36:00,3685,"Those pike never learn,anything that wiggles gets attacked,even if there mouth is already full of hardware."
6647588,Pooch,2022-04-13 12:45:00,4618,^^yes^^ Lose a jig to a bite off? Keep fishing same spot and odds are good you might get it back. Happens every year. Pooch
6647634,Stickman8474,2022-04-13 14:36:00,39,Gotcha. Will do.
6647638,Stickman8474,2022-04-13 14:37:00,39,"Threw them back, they were too small..."
6647652,Eckohlt,2022-04-13 16:04:00,3685,"Maybe some kid will catch them,might fit him."
6647656,Luckydawg13,2022-04-13 16:14:00,363,Fishing for salmon casting spoons from shore had a seagull hit my spoon I reeled it in like a kite was able to get the hook out of him
6647718,phishfearme,2022-04-13 19:32:00,1242,My boat buddy Vito and i were trolling for pike on North Caribou Lake and he felt something weird on his line - reeled in a 3 inch sculpin. See photos. ULTRA strange. phish
6647738,h8go4s,2022-04-13 21:02:00,1673,"Fishing the beach on the Texas gulf coast, I've caught two stingrays. They aren't fast, just a strong, bulldogging fight. They'll sit on the bottom and you just have to keep pressure on them until they decide to swim again. Beach 'em and cut the line. I'm not getting too close to them. This winter I reeled in a 7-1/2 foot spinning rig. The reel was corroded so bad it wouldn't crank, but I salvaged the rod. I also had a seagull fly into my line and get its wing tangled. Reeled it in, had my wife hold the rod, grabbed it by the back of the head, cut the line and let it go, apparently no worse for wear."
6647322,Stickman8474,2022-04-12 15:26:00,39,"Last year on a fly in out of Nakina I caught a ""pair of socks"" on a Mepps Long Cast #5. Oddest catch I can recall. Got me wondering what other unusual things have been caught?"
6647332,Pooch,2022-04-12 15:40:00,4618,There was a thread on this subject a year or two ago. Was a pretty interesting time killer. Try searching he different forums.Pooch

6647342,Old Timer,2022-04-12 16:12:00,255,I caught a loon. Really.
6647376,Bill Krejca,2022-04-12 19:40:00,6107,"As Gary indicated, lots of posts on the subject. I do remember catching 2 snappers during one LOW trip, as a kid. They really fight strange, after catching one, it is fairly easy to identify what is on the line after that. Bill"
6647444,eyecatcher1,2022-04-13 06:24:00,323,I caught a pretty new net on Abram Lake a few years ago. They have a strange fight too.
6647482,Larry S,2022-04-13 08:41:00,665,I posted this in 2014. On my sisters first fly in trip she caught an XXL Green Bay Packers Hooded Sweatshirt When I was 13 On a yearly family vacation in Minnesota a seagull swooped down and grabbed my minnow I was casting on a bobber Larry S
6647494,maddogg,2022-04-13 09:11:00,178,Not exactly a catch. On a fly in my buddy put a stick of butter on the deck railing to soften up. A seagull landed and gulped it down. That was the highlight of the week.
6647530,Eckohlt,2022-04-13 10:16:00,3685,Bet that seagull didn't have any problem taking a dump!
