6644862,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-04-01 11:51:00,240,"And I am sorry for that. As I mentioned earlier, I never intended to hijack your thread by commiserating about a trip I can no longer take. I wish so much that I could go with you guys. Good luck getting your group together. Can I ask what your outfitter is saying? Lots of outfitters are allowing smaller groups to book trips, given the realities of everything. But I sure understand their desire to fill as many plane seats as is possible. Again, I hope you guys get some interest, and I hope your trip is great. As an aside, anyone wondering about how great this trip would be can look at Mike Borger's trip review of a few years back. Another guy on this site who does a lot of blogging/trip reviews also speaks glowingly of Root Bay."
6644864,Eckohlt,2022-04-01 11:51:00,3685,"I'm already doing 4 flyin trips this year a 5th might make me a single man,I better not pull the trigger on root sry.Eight days will be nice for ya,but if I was going it would have been the award winning French toast that would have iced it for me for sure!!"
6644866,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-04-01 11:53:00,240,'Northern Jacks' is another guy who has given Root Bay and Slate Falls a very nice review.
6644870,Eckohlt,2022-04-01 11:57:00,3685,"I will be up there the same week as you,pickerel arm camps,wapesi lake,you picked a good week that's when the big girls like play."
6644874,SweetD,2022-04-01 12:08:00,243,Mich Walleye Guy. I was messing. I will be honest that’s what makes these forums and threads so much fun! To be honest the first thing I do d was go check out Larus Lake when I read that initial post &#x1f602;Thanks again for keeping the thread alive. Surely there is a few guys out there looking for a high quality trip with two super fantastic dudes that would rival even the most decorated pro walleye fisherman:……..not too mention the award winning French Toast!!?
6644920,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-04-01 13:43:00,240,"The longer this thread stays up here, the more I am intrigued. My boundary waters trip is a solo, and the thought of fishing with that outfitter is something I sure want to do. Throwing in with some fellow WC guys sounds like a ton of fun. I will need to take the wife out for dinner, and run this trip up the flagpole. I am already booked for outpost trips in May and in June, but not having gone in the past two years, I think I can justify another. Dave, does Slate Falls give any indication as to whether they might accommodate a slightly smaller group? Or is a group size of 8 written in stone?"
6644022,SweetD,2022-03-29 09:49:00,243,"Slate Falls Outpost. Fly-in Friday morning 7/15 and out on Saturday morning 7/23. The struggles continue to put together a group for our trip North (traditionally have had 6-10 regulars). At any rate weddings, un-vaccinated and kids in sports creating conflicts.With that said there are 2 that remain in our group. We are both from Iowa (Des Moines & Cedar Rapids). We are both middle-aged easy going dudes. Would love to add 2-4 guys to make a group of 4-6. With that said probably have capacity to go as high as 8. If you are interested in joining up feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. Dave Duelingemail: [email protected]phone: 515-577-2566 (call or text is fine)"
6644058,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-03-29 11:37:00,240,"I'd go in a minute, but I am going to be in the boundary waters, July 10-17. Root Bay--that lake and that outpost have been on my radar for a while now. I know what you mean about struggles putting a group together. I was part of a group of 6 that flew into Larus Lake every late May/June for 16 years. Then, 4 of the group decided that they were getting too old/too expensive, etc. So, we lost that slot, forever I am sure. I have been on several other outpost trips with the same outfitter, and have also flown with a few other outfitters, but nothing will ever compare to that lake, not even close. Good luck with your trip. Hope it happens, and hope it is great."
6644088,jambi,2022-03-29 13:56:00,504,My normal group of 8 plus a few maybe's is down to only 2 of us. Appreciate you guys offering up spots; I've met some lifelong friends after a few phone calls and joining groups meeting at Intl Falls for a week in the bush. The NW Ontario fellowship is pretty tight.
6644096,Old Timer,2022-03-29 14:47:00,255,"Walleye Guy: I too fished Larus many times, with my first trip in the late 70s. It's a special Lake. I'm not going anymore for the same reasons. Too bad, but it happens."
6644452,Eckohlt,2022-03-31 05:00:00,3685,"Had my eye on larus for a few years from reading your report,but every time I see the price my eyes go shut,just to much for me.If I went once a year I would be in for sure."
6644754,bthomas3333,2022-03-31 21:07:00,465,Is this the same lake through Nestor Falls outposts? Just checking bc the price looked pretty standard for a remote outpost. Brett
6644760,Eckohlt,2022-04-01 04:10:00,3685,"That's the one,that's alittle above standard I would say."
6644764,Eckohlt,2022-04-01 04:56:00,3685,"Longer flight for them so that's probably why there rate is what it is,the cabin looks nicer than what I live in.lol"
6644786,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-04-01 06:50:00,240,"Yeah, the flight from Nestor Falls to Larus Lake is over 180 miles. The Larus Beach outpost is a very, very nice cabin. Rebuilt in 2010, it narrowly escaped a few fires, both in 2011 and last year. You are about 10 minutes away by boat from the inlet river, which is just a fish factory in late May/early June. Only problem is that there is another cabin on the lake (same outfitter) and a moose hunter's cabin on an island in the middle of the lake, which sometimes is occupied in the summer. So there can be a bit of competition for the prime spots. Anyway, I did not mean for my comments on Larus to hijack this thread. I sure hope the guys are finding some takers on the Root Bay outpost. Mike Borger's trip review on this outpost a few years ago had my head spinning; you've got inlet river fishing, access to the Moose Crossing fish factory, and tons of great pike fishing. If I was not going to be in the boundary waters in July, I would be very, very likely to be joining this group. Good luck, guys."
6644816,SweetD,2022-04-01 08:25:00,243,My Root Bay “looking for fisherman” thread had turned into a Larus Lake is the best lake ever thread &#x1f60e;The good news I suppose is it keeps the thread at the top. The bad news is anyone looking for a trip to Root Bay is probably saying heck with that and I should be looking forva trip to Larus!!!!Let’s go WC dudes………you won’t be sorry you junped on boatd this trip to Root Bay! Worse case is you get to experience my award winning (self appointed award winning) French Toast during the week!
