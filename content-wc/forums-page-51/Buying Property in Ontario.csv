6649172,rpbadger,2022-04-19 10:04:00,22,"Has anyone seen the new measure passed by Trudeau to restrict non Canadians from buying property in Canada for the next two years? Also, if you were to buy property in Ontario before this restriction, there is a 20% tax imposed on the sale. This is all in an effort to keep property costs down for Canadians. Seems to me that this will impact Lodge owners that are trying to sell after 2 years of the pandemic and also real estate agents selling lake properties to Americans. This is an effort to bring down property values in Vancouver and Toronto but will negatively affect NW Ontario."

I think this might be language intended to exempt areas that rely on foreign investment (cottages / resorts) to keep the economy going. But that's just my guess."
