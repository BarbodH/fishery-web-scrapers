6645970,PhilTickelson,2022-04-06 22:43:00,84,"Just got back from another trip to Five Lakes Lodge on GullRock Lake, my very first ice fishing adventure in Canada! I'm a bit tired, so I'm not going to do any sort of day by day report, but wanted to just post a few tid-bits. We mainly chased Pike around the five lakes system, just running tip-ups and arctic warriors. To say we caught some nice pike would be a bit of an understatement. We had a group of three and we had LOTS of fish over 40"". I'll try to attach a few pictures to illustrate, but man, what a great fishery and lake system! You know the fishing is good when someone pulls in a 37"" pike and you immediately say, ""Ah, it's just another little one"". On top of that, Ian at Five Lakes Lodge continues to impress every time I'm in camp. They run such a great operation up there, you really can't go wrong staying there. Whether you like catching lots of walleyes, or big walleyes, or big northern, it's a great place to be. I know that a lot of lodges are having trouble filling their books with all the border/COVID stuff, so if you're looking for a place to stay this summer I give FLL my wholehearted recommendation. I'll be going back twice this summer and already re-booked for ice fishing next year! And just in case you were wondering, our biggest fish was 45.75""!!! We even caught a couple silver pike, which I wasn't familiar with before, pretty cool!"

6646006,HeHooksHimself,2022-04-07 07:38:00,725,Is that the silver pike on the upper left? I would have thought it was a muskie if I caught it. Never experienced silver pike. Is it unique to Gullrock? Hooks
6646008,Bill Krejca,2022-04-07 07:44:00,6107,Nice fish!!!! Bill
6646064,maddogg,2022-04-07 09:15:00,178,I take it the guy with the Striker jacket didn't want his wife or girl friend he was fishing.Nice bunch of fish Phil.
6646104,PhilTickelson,2022-04-07 11:29:00,84,"Yeah! We checked and they had 5 pores under their jaw, which I think is a sure fire pike. https://freemap.ca/member/blog/silver-pike/Apparently they don’t get as big as normal pike? But we caught a 41” silver one, pretty cool!"
6646616,HeHooksHimself,2022-04-09 08:04:00,725,"Thanks for the article, the one you caught seems to be a lunker! Reminds me of the first few blue walleye we caught. We had to look those up! Now it seems it is not too unusual, especially in the east. Fish On! Hooks"
6646760,johnboat,2022-04-10 07:59:00,2014,"Nice report. I'm glad to see another satisfied Five Lakes Lodge guest. Everyone that I have recommended FLL to and went there, has never been disappointed.I've got a fishing partner up there right now and his report sounds much the same.Ian will certainly see to it that you have success. So far, along with great fishing, he's helped me tag 1 Bear, 2 Wolves, a truck full of Grouse, and this Fall we're going after a Moose.I'll see you this Spring."
