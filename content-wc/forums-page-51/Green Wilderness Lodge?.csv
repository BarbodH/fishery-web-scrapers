6648950,Fisherman1792,2022-04-18 13:56:00,927,"Glad it all worked out, I still have not heard back from them so I will imagine they are booked. BTW that is one long lake your fishing on, not wide but long. Rich, I work in a gold mine in between Wawa and White river, camp mine to be more precise. I work 14 days in 14 days out. I'm not a miner just an underground surveyor, laser ape we are called. Lol Geologists are called rock lickers and others have certain names that I wont mention. Its a family site! The mine is installing new fans underground for ventilation at the moment so I am very limited to where I can go. You say you work on mining equipment? what brand? Fisherman 1792"
6648956,prov1800,2022-04-18 14:14:00,5010,Mg son is a diamond driller in Red Lake does 14 in and 7 out.

6649016,Eckohlt,2022-04-18 17:47:00,3685,"Rich any chance you can get me a few big nuggets?Im not looking for anything huge,maybe a cpl about 14 ounces each,I'll spring for a flyin for ya,on my nickle or I should say on my gold."
6649036,RichA$1970,2022-04-18 18:29:00,1159,"Eck,I heading to Thailand for 3 weeks Sunday so I will see if there are any core samples lying around the factory, if not Bangkok has tons of gold shops all over if you want 24k. Yea Not sure how how much down time I will get but might go fishing for Mekong Cats and Arapaimas unless I get distracted by the local scenery"
6649046,Eckohlt,2022-04-18 18:45:00,3685,"Oh I'm sure you will get sidetrack by the locals,you might not even leave your hotel room,don't forget to buy a fishing license there and probably a flat of crawlers hahaha.You'll be doing lots of fishing there,But not for fish,make sure and wrap it."
6649102,RichA$1970,2022-04-18 21:24:00,1159,"Eck, you could be a diplomat but spot on. My sons spent there high school years in Thailand and they called it Soi (means alley) Fishing. College parties in the states have not wowed them. I will be sure to return fit for duty to deploy to Hornby Lake June 4."
6649114,Eckohlt,2022-04-19 03:58:00,3685,Ok my friend go get'em
6648624,Fisherman1792,2022-04-17 10:51:00,927,I sent them an email for sh*** and giggles yesterday and have not heard back yet. Maybe they changed their email address? Fisherman 1792
6648628,Eckohlt,2022-04-17 10:56:00,3685,"Wonder why they would respond to fisherman Ted and no one else,You would think they would respond back if you had a deposit with them,I'm 100% sure Ted has no deposit with them."
6648640,Fisherman1792,2022-04-17 11:21:00,927,"He did say he texted them, I only sent an email so maybe they only check their emails (whenever) or they changed it and didn't update it on their website. Fisherman 1792 P.S. The only reason I did it was for something to do. I'm at work and have not done anything for the past five days as the mine is done for maintenance. Bored, bored, bored."
6648642,Eckohlt,2022-04-17 11:40:00,3685,Gotcha!
6648652,prov1800,2022-04-17 11:58:00,5010,Get the right phone # from Ted and text them.

6648904,Old Timer,2022-04-18 11:51:00,255,"The issue of deposits is popping up with more regularity this past year, especially Canada fishing being shut down for the better part of the past two years. Perhaps the Northern Ontario Tourism Organization (NOTO) should adopt a deposit policy for its members. Maybe not enforceable, but a policy would be helpful for both the outfitters and those making reservations."
6648918,Fisherman Ted,2022-04-18 12:15:00,461,Interesting. However not possible. Every lodge is different. A standard deposit policy across the industry is not going to happen. For example some high end lodges require 100% payment up-front. They aren't going to decrease that while at the same time those that take a token deposit likely won't want to increase their requirements. -FT
6648940,RichA$1970,2022-04-18 13:01:00,1159,What kind of mine you work in Ted? I work on underground hard rock mining equipment along with surface mining Load & Haul.
6648944,Seanik,2022-04-18 13:43:00,218,"Green Wilderness Lodge finally contacted me through email, Linda, one of the owners, blamed the problem on the internet providers. The deposit and reservation are all good. Thank you to all who posted, much relieved. We are a group of 65+ guys and have in the past done long drives to fly in destinations in Western Ontario. Those days are past we are fortunate to have the health and desire to do short drive in fishing trips. GWL is 10hrs total and we overnight in Sudbury. Thanks again, good health and fishing to all. Jerry Erie Pa"
6647496,Seanik,2022-04-13 09:14:00,218,"I have been trying to contact Green Wilderness Lodge near Gagoma for the past 2 weeks with no response from them. I have a deposit from last year and want to rebook for this year. They do not answer messages on the phone or response to emails. I would appreciate any information and am wondering if they are still in business, their website is still up. Jerry in Erie Pa"
6648400,Seanik,2022-04-16 08:50:00,218,"As in my original post I have been trying to contact Green Wilderness lodge near Gogoma for the past 2 weeks. Still No response to my phone calls or emails. I have a deposit with them from last year and want to rebook this year July 2022. It appears the Thibideau's have either gone bankrupt or traveled off to a distant land and don't care about their customers. I am requesting any information on GWL, if they are gone I will need to book with another outfitter/lodge soon."
6648428,walleyecheek,2022-04-16 10:10:00,2231,I would rebook NOW ! Sounds like another one bit the dust !
6648430,Eckohlt,2022-04-16 10:23:00,3685,"There probably sitting on a tropical beach,having a cool drink on ya."
6648480,bellbuoy,2022-04-16 15:27:00,490,"I’d contact the Northern Ontario Tourism group, maybe they would know whether it’s still operatinghttps://destinationnorthernontario.ca/contact-us/"
6648488,RichA$1970,2022-04-16 16:03:00,1159,"Well if the went under and you lost the deposit, sucks but probably worse for them. There’s a couple more snakes still out there not responding or kept deposits"
6648508,Eckohlt,2022-04-16 17:16:00,3685,Those dam snakes will jump up n bite ya for sure.
6648536,Outdoorfool,2022-04-16 19:34:00,9,Been to that place years ago once If it were me.. I'd call northern walleye lodge in missinabe ontario and once I got the male owner on the phone I'd ask what happened too his brother . Just saying.
6648538,Outdoorfool,2022-04-16 19:35:00,9,I'm sure not on a tropical beach but guaranteed they are drinking!
6648576,Fisherman Ted,2022-04-17 06:55:00,461,I texted them and they responded saying they were indeed open this summer. -FT
