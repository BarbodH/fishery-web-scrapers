6648958,prov1800,2022-04-18 14:16:00,5010,Not sure yet.either Lakers or crappies.ill figure it out in the morning.
6648484,prov1800,2022-04-16 15:56:00,5010,Not a lot of open water around yet but where there is current there is.Good to see water flowing.
6648486,That Minnesota guy,2022-04-16 16:01:00,8293,Open water is always a good thing.
6648496,NARDA 1,2022-04-16 16:34:00,636,Did the Dam get fixed? Last I heard it was stuck.
6648498,prov1800,2022-04-16 16:40:00,5010,Havnt heard of any problems Narda. They might of slowed flow due to low water last year.
6648582,NARDA 1,2022-04-17 07:13:00,636,When I was up there in the fall it was stuck in the open position.
6648586,prov1800,2022-04-17 07:30:00,5010,That sounds strange.
6648804,Bill Krejca,2022-04-18 06:56:00,6107,"I fished one day in the river while visiting friends at Eagle River, back in the 1950's. Caught a few pike from a rented boat. Long time ago, as a kid, time marches on. Bill"
6648808,prov1800,2022-04-18 07:18:00,5010,I moose hunted the Wabigoon river from hwy#105 east toward dryden a number of years and would come up the Eagle River also.Both rivers hold walleye and pike.From Clay Lake up the river toward the rail road bridge holds a ton of fish.Spring time if you know how to go throufh the 2 rapids is walleye heaven.Its to bad the Dryden paper polluted those waters as the fishing through that system is about as good as it gets.Still guide on on Clay Lake onxe in a while.dont eat the fish.Some guys do and don't think its harmful with couple of meals during the week.28 miles of some good fishing.
6648888,Eckohlt,2022-04-18 11:21:00,3685,"John by the looks of the long range forecast up there you could be making ice every night,hope that's not the case."
6648914,prov1800,2022-04-18 12:14:00,5010,Just might be. Usually this time of the year it gets iffy to go on the ice.Especially with shorelines.The shoreline at Edward Lake bit weak as I busted through again this morning when I went and got some freebie minnows for tomorrow's ice fishing.
