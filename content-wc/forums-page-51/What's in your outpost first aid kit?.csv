6643186,SJC305,2022-03-25 15:14:00,154,X2 on that. I forgot that I had a half dozen 30min road flares sealed up for emergency.
6646776,Laketripper,2022-04-10 09:19:00,103,"After reading some of these posts put out in various threads by the WC crowd I would recommend: Aed Defibrillator because of some of the meal planning. A fresh Smokie/co2 detector because of some of the dated fossil fuel burning appliances found in some camps. Ice auger for maintaining body hydration because of a late ""ice-out""."
6641622,Eckohlt,2022-03-20 07:26:00,3685,Guided the most important item on your list is duct tape.lol
6641624,guidedfishing,2022-03-20 07:30:00,531,I did not mention what I consider to be normal maintenance or what should be in your own ditty bag. Sun Screen Imodium Tums / Antacid Necessary supply of personal medication plus a few days extra Lip Balm Hand cream/lotion sun glasses and a hat long sleeve sun shirt Wet wipes/anti bacterial wipes
6641632,Hillbiehle,2022-03-20 07:44:00,66,"My wife is a nurse practitioner and is in charge of the emergency pack. I pretty much stay out of her way and she packs what she is comfortable with. One member of our group has had heart issues and few other issues and the other has a history of blood clots and is on major blood thinner. As a result, her pack has most things in the original post but has her stethoscope and couple of other items that I can't think of. I suspect the trip that she wouldn't take it would be the trip that there'd be an issue. Likely the biggest concern will always be the simple things, slipping when getting in/out of the boat, hook in the hand, splitting wood, etc..."
6641636,Eckohlt,2022-03-20 07:48:00,3685,"And last but not least,make sure you have a doctor in your group,probably a brain surgeon for the guys I go with."
6641640,RichA$1970,2022-03-20 07:57:00,1159,"Looking at some of these packing lists & meeting weight limits, I think not just a brain surgeon in these groups but probably a couple of rocket scientists and why not a media journalist to report the facts of the record size lunkers."
6641668,Eckohlt,2022-03-20 09:01:00,3685,"I feel alittle inadequate with just bandaids n duct tape,but if somebody gets beat up pretty bad it's nice to have the right stuff to patch him or her up,have to be careful out there when your ride to the hospital is a floatplane,takes awhile to get to you in emergency."
6641866,guidedfishing,2022-03-21 06:10:00,531,"LoL, yeah it may seem like a lot but the entire kit fits in a 8X10 inch sealed packer. And when your in the middle of no where its pretty darn handy when someone gashes themselves good, or any of the the many things that happen with a group of people when you are in a remote site when at best you maybe 2-3 hours from even a clinic. It fits nicely in one of the front compartments of the boat. Its saved more than one trip."
6642068,SJC305,2022-03-22 06:21:00,154,"A lot of what is listed, plus:Celox (blood clotter) (Large and small)Steri-stripsMedical glovesWrapable gauzeTactical sheersBetadine wipesCloth arm braceFinger splintsAloeHad to use the bigger items a few years back after a Pike got a buddy badly. Got a finger nearly to the bone and severed a vein. Still had to make a long drive to the ER the next day due to open tissue and bleeding that persisted over night.Prepare for the worst and hope for the best."
6642310,SweetD,2022-03-22 20:05:00,243,Satellite phone for a real emergency! Not trying to be funny but if something really severe band aids and neosporin not going to cut it!!!!
6642844,AsianAngler,2022-03-24 18:24:00,67,"I carry most of that stuff, but as a highly allergic person, still somewhat surprised at all of the allergy medication being packed. I also pack small emergency cold/heat pack, VetWrap, sometimes works better than regular bandages, thread, NewSkin, and finger cots (bandaids always seem to fall off when fishing.) One trip, my husband was on a short course of blood thinners at the time, I hardly had enough band-aids. He cut himself using a fire starter and you would have thought someone had been murdered looking at his clothes and the gear! Stay safe out there."
6641464,NM_Trout,2022-03-19 12:55:00,1094,"By now, most of you who know my posts know that I am OCD for maintenance and also safety stuff. I'm starting my pre-pack to get gear set up, and we bring a pretty comprehensive first aid kit with us to our outpost. Here's what I bring. It fits into a small packing cube pretty easy, as we clearly don't need an entire bottle of each med, except that the prescription stuff stays in the prescription bottle. The rest of the stuff I vacuum pack into small plastic packs. The whole kit, not including the saline, weighs 28 ounces and is 10x8x4 inches. What does your first aid kit have?

6641488,prov1800,2022-03-19 16:13:00,5010,When the muskie I caught in Oct torn my thumb up my kit was empty.lol.But had paper towels and electrical tape to fix myself up.My wife put a new one together for up coming season.As far as getting hooks out from some guests I've had I just yank them out with fairly clean plyers and tell them it won't hurt.
