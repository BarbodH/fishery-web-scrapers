6645968,SweetD,2022-04-06 21:30:00,243,Agreed. Things are not getting any cheaper on these trips for sure! Have not been to Anisinabi but sounds like I may need to keep on my radar and costs seem reasonable. I have made trips with Clarks but not to this particular lake and they do offer a good value for an outpost fly in with generally good fishing. We are always looking to try different lakes and outfitters. We had a tremendous trip with Slate Falls last Fall to Arc and looking forward to our time on Root Bay this summer.Still have a few soots to fill so reach out if interested.Good fishing to all regardless of where you end up this coming season!
6646028,prov1800,2022-04-07 08:15:00,5010,Have a great trip and enjoy your stay.Thats what it's all about.Fishing on fly outs is always good and very peacefull
6645718,prov1800,2022-04-05 15:40:00,5010,I see posts where some parties have gotten smaller and tough to find a spot for just couple of fisherman.Check this 2 person cabin out at Anishinabi Lake.My wife and i have stayed there a few times and its a great little cabin.Can have coffee on the deck and see the smallie s swimming around in the clear water.Fantastic fishing and the most comfortable boats around.17.5 Crestliner with a 25 4 stroke.There are also 3 other larger cabins all spread apart on the island.15 minute flight from Cedar Lake.If you want more remote thères the Williams narrow cabin.

6645732,prov1800,2022-04-05 17:32:00,5010,Very good.Main Lake has lots of lake trout and some huge pike and smallmouth and 5 walleye lakes you get to by atv.Couple of walk to walleye and another trout portage. Wont be bored there.very peacefully.
