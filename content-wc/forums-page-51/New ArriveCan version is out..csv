6646764,Andre (wallyandre),2022-04-10 08:30:00,2274,A friend of mine croos yesterday to a different port of entry and it took 1 minute; smooth as a silk
6646904,guidedfishing,2022-04-11 05:50:00,531,Does it matter? just because you have a prearrival test does it change whether you draw a random test at the border. I don't think they are going to care one way or the other if you went above and beyond. I think you still fall into the same que for drawing a random test. Through the end of March they were running at about a 20% get random test. I am sure if getting a pre arrival test made a difference many would go that route just not to have to deal with the random test.
6646290,Andre (wallyandre),2022-04-07 18:55:00,2274,"Lake Champlain is within the 5 best lake in North Amaerica. Bass fishing is fantastic, catching 30-40 lakers in the summer jigging is not unusual, landlock salmon use to be excellent but it's more difficult the last 3-4 years; walleyes are coming back, a lot of pikes."
6646386,guidedfishing,2022-04-08 06:25:00,531,good fishing. Was looking at the current stats for % of tests given to fully vaccinated travelers at land border crossing and as of March it looks like they are running at 18-20% of travelers are winning the prize... You cross enough times you are going to get whacked... oh joy.
6646390,Eckohlt,2022-04-08 06:40:00,3685,"My mom told me to never whack anyone,maybe I'll call the border n tell them the whacking needs to stop!"
6646514,Old Timer,2022-04-08 15:11:00,255,With the 72-hour test eliminated on 4/1/2022 I wouldn't be surprised if more random tests are conducted. The government will be tracking the percentage of infected travelers actually crossing over. If the percentage is too high we may see the 72-hour test being reinstated. Given my lengthy delay because of four random tests last August I'd rather handle the inconvenience of the 72-hour test than risking more random tests at the border.
6646572,kettyspanky,2022-04-09 04:32:00,271,I'm with you Old Timer. I would rather do the 72 hr. test instead of the random. We have no cell service just before the border and beyond it. I would have to do it at our resort on his phone. Which isn't terrible but I can do the 72 hr. test close to home and have the results before I leave. I guess we will see how it plays out. Hopefully the numbers go down and the random testing goes away.
6646578,Eckohlt,2022-04-09 06:12:00,3685,Spot on Ketty!!
6646592,maddogg,2022-04-09 07:16:00,178,What border crossing did you use?
6646646,kettyspanky,2022-04-09 10:12:00,271,Pigeon River.
6646650,Old Timer,2022-04-09 10:27:00,255,"In August we crossed at Baudette. We did the random just north of the customs station. We were heading to a remote location where cell service wasn't available. I had no interest in the risk of a bogie jeopardizing our future crossings if we failed to fully comply with the random requirement. Their country, their rules."
6646674,Andre (wallyandre),2022-04-09 13:24:00,2274,"Next time I cross the vorder, it will be April 29th. I'm gettint the test in the US within the 72hrs."
6645568,guidedfishing,2022-04-05 06:46:00,531,"I guess I am not sure what you are seeing. The Canada.gov site is very specific.https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/tr...ntering-canada To qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller to Canada, you must: have received at least 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine accepted for travel, a mix of 2 accepted vaccines or at least 1 dose of the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine have received your second dose at least 14 calendar days before you enter Canada In ArriveCan, as soon as you select J&J as your received vaccination it did not give me the option to enter a 2nd shot record. Full disclosure, I do not have J&J, I have one of the two jab versions, that I entered with last summer, but as soon as I changed out my first jab to J&J this morning, the second option to enter the shot type and date went away? I am assuming your ""little Quiz"" is the arrive can App."
6645586,ahawki10,2022-04-05 07:54:00,5,"Thank you for your response, the 'quiz' for lack of a better word I was referring to, is the one called 'find out if you can enter Canada"" - link below.... You check the J and J box it then says you fully qualify but then the next 'mandatory' question asks if your second shot was before the 14 days. So if you say no, since you didn't have a second shot, it says you don't get in. I guess we are to just assume and answer the second shot as yes , even though it was only one first shot. Not sure why they don't have 2 questions there for the J and J situation? I am glad to hear that on the Arrivecan it sends you on after checking the J and J box. Thanks againhttps://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/tr...s/wizard-start"
6645594,lawson2343,2022-04-05 08:00:00,459,"I too have had only 1 J&J shot. Just to confirm what @guidedfishing said, I just went through the Arrive Can app and selected the J&J and was able to upload my vax card. It did not ask me for a second shot."
6645598,ahawki10,2022-04-05 08:03:00,5,"I too have had only 1 J&J shot. Just to confirm what @guidedfishing said, I just went through the Arrive Can app and selected the J&J and was able to upload my vax card. It did not ask me for a second shot. OK sounds great, appreciate the feedback."
6645600,guidedfishing,2022-04-05 08:09:00,531,"Your good, I would not give the website quiz any thought. The rules are clear and the ArriveCan backs that up. You don't need any other validation."
6646240,ackvil,2022-04-07 17:28:00,177,"I had the older version and my iPhone updated to the new version. However, most of the info I had filled out disappeared for a while but mysteriously appeared again."
6646254,Andre (wallyandre),2022-04-07 17:48:00,2274,"Went fishing yesterday on lake Champlain in Vermont coming from Montreal. 3 retired guys in the truck, all triple vaccinated, ArrivCan fill-up; arrive at the gate, answered the usual questions then he gave us the box for the test, so 3 in the truck and we just won the lot! And for the cherry on the cake: pull over then 3 officers to do a full search of boat and vehicle.Did the test online this morning. Incredible!"
6646262,Eckohlt,2022-04-07 17:54:00,3685,"You guys must have looked guilty about something,anything unusual about any of you guys?"
6646274,Andre (wallyandre),2022-04-07 18:07:00,2274,3 70 years old guys no record no nothing On a normal year I cross the broder 30-40 times and I'm getting those searchs at least 3-4 times a year. Easier for us Canadian to cross in the US then coming back to our country. Thats the way it is! And on top of that the 3 boxes of test!! By the way we had a super nice day on the water caught 15 lakers netween 20 and 10 ft kept 3 for my friends father.
6646284,Eckohlt,2022-04-07 18:16:00,3685,Well all is not lost you got some fish at least.
6644836,guidedfishing,2022-04-01 09:30:00,531,"Ok, it took a little bit of probing but the new version of ArriveCan is available for update.Version V2.27.2Which you can see at the bottom of the settings tab in ArriveCan no longer contains the question on do you have a pre-arrival test complete.There is a statement in the Covid testing requirements page that says ""Travelers who are fully vacinated are no longer required to produce proof of a Covid 19 test.""good deal."
6644838,kettyspanky,2022-04-01 10:06:00,271,Good to know. Thanks for the update. I think I'll update mine today.
6644842,Andre (wallyandre),2022-04-01 10:57:00,2274,I did mine earlier; I'm on Apple but my friend on Android can't
6644856,SJC305,2022-04-01 11:39:00,154,"Notes highlight: - Marine travellers are now required to enter their Date and Time of Embarkation from their country of origin, which must be done no earlier than 72 hours prior to departure. - Marine travellers are able to make arriveCAN submissions 30 days prior to arrival. - Removal of testing information and questions for fully vaccinated travellers."
6645128,hoppy63,2022-04-02 14:08:00,367,Mine says v2.27.2 already. Does the app automatically update on your phone?
6645214,Habitual Eyer,2022-04-03 07:14:00,144,For land border crossing...still the 72hr window to register on Arrivecan ??
6645346,guidedfishing,2022-04-04 06:19:00,531,"Hoppy depends on your phone settings, it should, but always good to check. You are all set. Yes still 72hrs is the soonest you can complete your arrive can before entry, but with the negative test no longer a thing, its really a moot point. Just have all your info stored, and change the date and submit when your in the window."
6645454,ahawki10,2022-04-04 13:38:00,5,"Perhaps a dumb question, but Canada's official sight is confusing when going through the process to see if you qualify to cross into Canada when you have only had the one J & J shot. If a person has had the J and J shot, it says under Canada regulations that they are considered fully vaccinated, so therefore should be allowed into the country. However when doing the little quiz, it will not let you continue unless you check that you have had 2 shots. I realize that is for the other vaccinations, however it says one thing but then doesn't allow you to go on unless you checked the box with 2 shots. Anyone else find this part confusing? I am assuming one shot of J and J is all that is needed, even if it was a year ago? Very odd to me. Has anyone crossed the border with only one J and J shot even if the shot was last year etc? Thanks."
6645524,hoppy63,2022-04-04 20:29:00,367,Thanks for your response.
