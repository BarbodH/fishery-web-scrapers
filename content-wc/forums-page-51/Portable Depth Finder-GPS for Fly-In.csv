6643126,Hook_settr,2022-03-25 11:54:00,127,Anything but the Hook 2. I had one. Didn’t last a year. Crapped out on me with two days left on my LOTW trip. BTW-Lowrance customer service was some of the worst customer service I’ve experienced.
6643136,prov1800,2022-03-25 12:25:00,5010,sometimes you end up with a lemon.Have had my hds gen 1 for 15 years still going strong and my hook 7 been through rough trips for 3 years..I guide from camp boats and all have helix and most of them don't work.So always bring my hook.
6643140,Eckohlt,2022-03-25 12:51:00,3685,"Guides must be hard on those helix,no issue with mine so far,great unit if you know to read them."
6643206,prov1800,2022-03-25 17:18:00,5010,Like I said they all do the same thing.Menus are different.Maybe they get used to much.
6643212,jaym,2022-03-25 18:11:00,89,"I take a helix 7 with side imaging, you find more structure you didn't know was there unless you pass right over it. Also use autochart."
6646324,tmramrod91,2022-04-07 20:12:00,15,Any recommendations on battery size? Doing a 5 day fly in with Helix 8 GPS SI.
6646344,prov1800,2022-04-07 21:42:00,5010,Get a lithiùm.i bought a markum battery with a charger.Itcwill last a couple of days on my hook 7.You should have a generator iam sure to recharge at your outpost
6646436,Hillbiehle,2022-04-08 08:48:00,66,"I'm sure you're aware of this, but make sure to drop the brightness down on your Helix 8. It will significantly extend the batter life. I was forgetting this obvious and battery way drained by mid afternoon."
6646462,pnnylfr,2022-04-08 11:48:00,114,Power draw comparison by model Helix 5.....615 ma Helix 7.....800 ma Helix 8.....2.4 A Helix 9.....2.4 A Approximate run time/hours Helix 8 6 AH battery.....2.7 hrs. 12 AH battery....5.3 hrs. 18 AH battery....8 hrs there is more info available here https://ampedoutdoors.com/pages/humminbird%C2%AE I have not personally dealt with them yet. Hope this helps
6642976,55walleyes,2022-03-25 06:51:00,131,Which one of these do you suggest? Lowrance HOOK2 4X Bullet GPS Plotter Fishfinder Garmin Striker 4 Portable Fishfinder and GPS Plotter Humminbird Helix 5 Chirp GPS G2 PT Fishfinder The HB does cost more but I believe it can take a chip.
6642978,kettyspanky,2022-03-25 06:53:00,271,I have the garmin striker 4 in 2 of my boats. I love it. Easy to use and works great.
6642996,Hillbiehle,2022-03-25 08:36:00,66,"I can't comment on the other two, but I like my Helix. In addition, I added the Auto Chart chip which was alot fun creating a map of an unmapped lake. Backtrolling and fishing various reefs over and over finetuned the map continuously for future trips. Anytime I was running under 5mph or so it was mapping and recording. I found a couple of reefs by accident doing this and that information is saved for future trips. PS: Not that it matters but I should mention that I have the Helix 9 from my boat, I purchased the portable ice bundle and portable transducer for $250 or so."
6643004,JDP,2022-03-25 08:44:00,1457,I concur with Hillbielhe. Get a Helix 5 or 7 Sonar/GPS combo. The Autochart feature will be fun and productive. Also recommend a lithium battery both for less weight and run time.
6643020,Eckohlt,2022-03-25 09:00:00,3685,"Spot on,can't go wrong with what you mentioned."
6643052,prov1800,2022-03-25 09:48:00,5010,"It's what ever you get used to when you buy one.All about learning the menu.I have 9"" lowrance in my boat and have had my hook 7 for 3 years now.Both awesome.I guide a lot in other boats and iam clueless with the other units.They work fine.My hook 7 goes on my trips in camp boats and private boats and the fly outs I do."
6643068,tadler,2022-03-25 10:10:00,43,"I have been looking for a Canada locator also. I came across this website last night.https://capporr.com/collections/fishing-gear All name brand, high end locators priced in the $75 - $80 price range supposedly new with free shipping. Has anyone come across this site? It's got to be a phishing site isn't it? Tom"
6643078,prov1800,2022-03-25 10:20:00,5010,Order one and let us know the end result.
6643088,Eckohlt,2022-03-25 10:27:00,3685,"For 80 bucks it probably won't do to much for you,just guessing."
6643112,tadler,2022-03-25 11:22:00,43,I'm thinking hard about ordering one but fear of the unknown. Just figuring out how much damage they can do if I pay with PayPal. I have been hacked thru PayPal in the past and it's a pain.I mean really this:GARMIN ECHOMAP ULTRA 106SV WITH GT54UHD-TM TRANSDUCER AND PANOPTIX LIVESCOPE SYSTEM ECHOMAP ULTRA 106SV WITH GT54UHD-TM TRANSDUCER AND PANOPTIX BUNDLEFor $77.99 The Panoptix is $1200 minimum. I know it's what the bad guys do but sure looks real. Only thing is no location or information that I can find on the company. Ya think that's a problem - duh. I found an email address so sent one. We'll see if I get a response.
