6646932,KRobins,2022-04-11 07:33:00,34,prevailing NW winds always pile up what’s left for ice up along the NE shoreline. Makes it always a crap shoot for us to get up to our camp in Chamberlain Narrows. Other parts of the lake will be open but that stretch for us is a *****. Agreed the upcoming temps are not helping and this dump of snow will for sure have me loading up my sled for my Early May trip up.
6647010,prov1800,2022-04-11 12:23:00,5010,You can still get in off the vermilion rd right if you have to.
6646782,KRobins,2022-04-10 09:32:00,34,I break ice between Taylor and Bear every year well into May not often the lake is ice free early May but this year hard to say if all the snow will effect the melt. I know first week of March Chamberlain Narrows showing lower than normal water level reguardless of where it was in the fall
6646788,prov1800,2022-04-10 10:10:00,5010,Let's give it another 3 weeks.Lots Will happen or not.Only a foot of junk on top of ice right.Not a lot of warm weaþher in the forecast so that sucks.Need 0c overnights to do anything and that's not on the horizon yet.Plus up to 40 cm of snow possible wed/thurs.Winter is hanging in this year.

6587748,pjshorthorn,2021-08-07 17:29:00,5654,"LSO is an awesome place. Stayed there 6 or 7 times with two being solo trips in late September. I have fished that entire area since 1996 and holds a lot of memories for me. One year, in late fall, I was the only person in camp for 5 straight days until the moose hunters got to camp. That was an awesome experience. PjShorthorn"
6587794,Yellowfin123,2021-08-07 20:04:00,2182,"dang solo thats dedication!! yea i've gota see that place, half the appeal is the fantastic fishing in the middle of no where and stay about 20 feet behind the camp boat goin in"

6646772,PikeSlayer1967,2022-04-10 08:55:00,23,Does anyone know the lake level. Is it going to low this spring?

6587418,David Anderson,2021-08-06 11:40:00,2073,"There's a number of resorts on the Sioux Lookout side, Lac Seul Outfitters is on Chamberlain Narrows and you are right in the middle of nowhere! Anderson's Lodge has a few outpost cabins in that same area that are pretty nice. Of course with a houseboat you can basically pick a number of central locations to fish out of."
6587556,LoDo,2021-08-06 22:48:00,721,"I fished Lac Seul for a number of years and stated at Evergreen Lodge, Fishermans Cove, Lac Seul Lodge and Onaway. Give me Onaway's location, staff, hospitality, boats, and cabin every time. Can't go wrong with any of those camps, but give me Onaway Lodge every time! Good luck getting in there though. Its repeat business on the annual. In June I'm a MacKenzie Bay guy. Its a boat ride, but the fishing is outstanding. Take a trip down to Manitoba Pt, Broad Lake, etc... too. The river/creek from Lac Seul to Broad Lake and Sun Light Lake is fun. Theres an outpost on Sunlight Lake which I'd love to stay. I think Lac Seul Lodge has it, but certainly triple check. That outpost might be the best location anywhere on Lac Seul. The rock pile in the middle of Broad Lake holds huge 'eyes!"

6587624,prov1800,2021-08-07 07:11:00,5010,Broad/sunlight great trip. there is a outpost in McKenzie bay to think scout lake lodge owns it.way back in there.Plus a private cabin near Turkey creek
6587704,fergiefish,2021-08-07 12:48:00,197,"We have fished both the East end in the early spring opener, and then on the west end during the summer. The East end is fabulous for the opener if you can get lodging. I have not fished this area in June. On the West end, we have stayed at Gold Pines Camp for 15 plus years now and can't say enough about the owners and their camp. In earlier June you can find fish close to camp on points, the river mouth of the Wenesaga River, or back in Sawmill Bay. Later in June when we go we move down the lake to Steamboat and eventually down to McKenzie Bay. McKenzie is about a 30 mile ride, but the ride is worth it as the fishing is usually fantastic and the average size of the fish seems to be bigger in the bay. A variety of fishing structure produces good catches of quality fish. Island rock humps, sand shore, and weed beds all produce walleye and northers. Earlier in June you will find fish in 3 to 15 feet of water. later in June and early July you can find the fish in 6 to 20 feet of water depending on conditions. We use spinner rigs and crawlers for our June trip and mix it up with jigs and crank baits. We will be going up for two weeks straight in late June and first week of July with a potential for a second trip in early August. Love the lake and can't wat to get back next year. My suggestion is that if you want to find a place on Lac Seul next year, you should be trying to book now as many of the lodges are honoring previous reservations for Covid reasons and you may have trouble finding a place. Good luck in your search."
6587710,Ronr81!,2021-08-07 14:16:00,15,"Thank you, I had not considered the east end"
6587712,Ronr81!,2021-08-07 14:18:00,15,Thank you good information
6587714,Ronr81!,2021-08-07 14:18:00,15,That is good to know.....thank you
6587728,pjshorthorn,2021-08-07 15:11:00,5654,"Take a look at the NE end as has been suggested. Hands down, that has been one of my top three favorite areas in all of Canada. Lots of water to explore with a lot of bays to hide in if a blow does come up. Lac Seul is a huge body of water, but it isn't as scary as folks can make it out to be.....just respect it at all times and make smart decisions. I hope to get back there sooner than later. PjShorthorn"
6587740,prov1800,2021-08-07 16:09:00,5010,PJ I don't think there is a bad area on Lac Suel.I find it the easiest lake to put fish in the boat consistently.Its to bad that the muskie population is poor on the west side allthough there are some.but the pike are huge with very few fisherman targeting them.
6587172,Ronr81!,2021-08-05 18:46:00,15,"Assuming we have an open border in 2022, I’m considering a June trip to Lac Seul. We have fished LOTW several times but are considering new water. I’m a sponge for information at this point. Thoughts on Lac Seul in June, good resorts, is one part of the lake better, comments on Walleye fishing, any general information appreciated. Thank you"
6587188,prov1800,2021-08-05 19:25:00,5010,Having fished the diff sections of the 110 mi long lake id say fishing is about par no matter if your on the west side or the east side by Sioux lookout.Most spring fishing on the lake at that time seems to have fair run times to the really good fishing spots like 15-20 mi but worth the rides. .It takes till water temps reach 70 f on the mid lake before you start to get fish on humps.So fishing points and bays and shorelines till that happens.But fishing there is fantastic. I basically fish out of the scout Bay area on the west end and 20 mi south of earfalls. I usually guide for Onaway Lodge a few times a year and that camp cant get any better.So definatly you need to take a look at it.There in a great area and have fishing very close to the lodge.
6587304,Riding high,2021-08-06 05:43:00,69,"I fished lac seul for 18 years before I decided to explore more of Ontario. I fished around Earfalls, scout bay area and sioux lookout area. I like Earfalls and Scout bay area the best. We fished in June and August every year. We've fished LOW the last 8 years. The biggest difference I see In walleye fishing is the percentage of fish are bigger on lac seul. We've caught alot of big fish (25""+) both lakes but more on lac seul. Good luck and have a great trip."
6587314,MN_Moose,2021-08-06 06:16:00,964,"fished Lac Seul once and on the East Side up near Bear Narrows. Incredible scenery. Very desolate. One thing to keep in mind, no alive fish in the boat. i.e. no culling. you have to snap their necks / cut the gills."
6587316,eyecatcher1,2021-08-06 06:21:00,323,"I've been fishing Lac Seul since 1994, usually two or three times a year. I've fished it from opening day until early October. I'm always on the east end of the lake by Sioux Lookout. Amazing fishing there!"
6587326,prov1800,2021-08-06 06:56:00,5010,Thx for mentioning that.Bring a cooler with ice to keep fish cold.East side by Sioux Lookout has no camps on the lake except Lost Island Lodge in Hudson.Otherwise have to trailer a boat to Deception Bay. The west side and in Earfalls have quite a few camps to choice From.Near Scout bay there are 4 camps also within close distance to the Bay of islands which has very good fishing.Plan was/is to go there today but weatger is looking gloomy
6587328,JDP,2021-08-06 07:06:00,1457,"Do a search for ""Lac Seul"" on the Canada Forum. Tons of info. You will get a great knowledge base. Ask specific questions later."
6587366,stumcfar,2021-08-06 08:02:00,451,"I enjoy the Ear Falls area early in the year. Good fishing without having to travel many miles. IF you are bringing your own boats check out Gawley's Little Beaver. Other camps we have used in the Ear Falls area, are Golden Eagle Resort, Goose Bay and Gold Pines. All have been great and treated us well. You can't go wrong with any of those choices that time of year. PM me if you want any more info on the camps or possible fishing spots."
