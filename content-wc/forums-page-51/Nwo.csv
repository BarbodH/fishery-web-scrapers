6647848,KRobins,2022-04-14 09:31:00,34,I can get access to camp via an old unmaintained logging road. 4x4 and a shovel at the best of times and some beaver dam wash outs. Usually just use a quad as a truck can easily get stuck. No matter on when ice out camp needs to have staff in and regular stuff done. If there is enough snow left to get a truck stuck there is enough to use a sled
6647866,Skywagon,2022-04-14 10:06:00,1106,Taken out the front window earlier this morning
6647870,prov1800,2022-04-14 10:08:00,5010,Now ain't that lovely.lol.Nice pic
6647784,Eckohlt,2022-04-14 06:55:00,3685,Probably making ice today rather than melting it.late ice out this year
6647794,walleyecheek,2022-04-14 07:20:00,2231,If it's 3 feet thick it won't be out by opener !
6647800,Skywagon,2022-04-14 07:25:00,1106,"I just heard the TransCanada highway is closed from Thunder Bay to the Manitoba border because of the snow, that is over 500 km (310 miles). That effectively shuts down all traffic between those points in Canada, there are no alternatives."
6647804,prov1800,2022-04-14 07:31:00,5010,Just like xmas out Sky.
6647806,Eckohlt,2022-04-14 07:38:00,3685,Could be nerve racking for people booked for opener.
6647808,prov1800,2022-04-14 07:39:00,5010,Think it's -7 Here this morning and rest of week and next week all below temps at night.Not much happens in those situation.Going to need some sun and warm daytime temps to melt our new snow.So yes that's a set back.A year ago today I fished the ice shack area in a boat.
6647810,Eckohlt,2022-04-14 07:41:00,3685,So it looks like ice out is many weeks behind compared to that picture?
6647814,prov1800,2022-04-14 07:53:00,5010,Starting to look like it.Would of been awesome to have another spring like last year.Doesnt happen very often.Did have snow overnight as you can see.
6647834,KRobins,2022-04-14 09:11:00,34,No way I’m not loading up my sled expecting to be able to get up Lac Seul first weekend in May. This last dump uncalled for lol lol! That pic April 1 last year. 4 feet of snow this year a month later
6647840,prov1800,2022-04-14 09:18:00,5010,Got to melt a ft of snow again to get to ice surface now.
6647528,Yellowfin123,2022-04-13 10:12:00,2182,i thought you guys needed the extra water to get the lakes up anyway?
6647532,prov1800,2022-04-13 10:17:00,5010,Think we have enough.Good to get a soaking in the bush so hopefully we don't have fires like last year.
6647536,prov1800,2022-04-13 10:20:00,5010,It's 0c today but next few days dipping down around -10c so it won't be to wet.Wet heavy stuff bad.Lots of trees go down and power outages.Sucks.Have a generator just in case.
6647600,Skywagon,2022-04-13 13:09:00,1106,"To answer your earlier question, crappie bite has not been up to par for this time of year. I topped off the tank on the generator yesterday and have 20 gallons in reserve, if we get the amount of wet snow they are talking about, the trees will be taking down power lines (lets hope for the fluffy stuff). Trails could be a mess to clean up for the second time this season."
6647616,prov1800,2022-04-13 13:35:00,5010,Have heard crappies where tough on both Goon and Dinorwic so far this year.I have gone once and that was with you.Was hoping to get on Cedar soon with no snow to leave tracks to my secret spots.mhhh.Just shoveled my deck so far only a inch but it is wet.Generator is full and have 10 gallons in reserve.Walleye season about over but lots of ice for trout and crappie for few weeks.Your shacks still out
6647650,Luckydawg13,2022-04-13 15:58:00,363,Had my boat on the foxriver no walleye only crappie all plate size
6647710,7 Mag,2022-04-13 19:13:00,1887,"I purchased a generator about 15 years ago probably the best investment I've ever made, hope you don't need it."
6647732,prov1800,2022-04-13 20:20:00,5010,Sweet
6647772,Eckohlt,2022-04-14 06:30:00,3685,"Your probably inside today just drinking coffee,full blown winter out."
6647780,prov1800,2022-04-14 06:47:00,5010,"Yes it's coffee time.10"" overnight.Depressing.lol.Still snowing lightly.3+"" today.Then some more next few days.Put some wood in my stove and needed rubber boots.Will plow sometime this morning.Never a dull moment here."
6647436,prov1800,2022-04-13 06:05:00,5010,"We have had it all this year.Allthough we have metric here i don't use it much when figuring fish lengths.2.5 cm=1"""
6647438,Skywagon,2022-04-13 06:12:00,1106,"Just giving you a hard time. Walleye bite was great Saturday, couldn't buy one on Sunday."
6647446,Eckohlt,2022-04-13 06:24:00,3685,"Good thing opener is a week ahead this year,still might not be enough."
6647460,prov1800,2022-04-13 06:54:00,5010,How is crappie bite.
6647468,prov1800,2022-04-13 07:42:00,5010,When is opener.???.3 rd Sat in May right.mhhh.
6647470,Eckohlt,2022-04-13 07:52:00,3685,"Right,may 21"
6647480,prov1800,2022-04-13 08:35:00,5010,So not opening any earlier.Just normal.6 weeks to melt everything.All week not warm enoufh to melt anything.so need 5 warm weeks.lol.With this storm next couple of days doubt I'll gèt out for last of walleye now but will see what it looks lije tomorrow you never know.
6647510,7 Mag,2022-04-13 09:52:00,1887,"Looks like the channel on Cutfoot Sioux lake in Minn. is starting to open up, maybe it won't be long for NWO as well.http://www.williamsnarrows.com/webcam/live/?cam=3"
6647516,prov1800,2022-04-13 10:00:00,5010,Be a while this spring yet.Had 2 ft of ice yesterday and 10 inches frozen slush.With potentiàl blanket of 50 cm of snow coming and cooler weather all next week will put it behind schedule.Snowing now and 60-80 km winds.Just plain ugly.
6647526,7 Mag,2022-04-13 10:10:00,1887,That's miserable weather with a lot of snow especially if it's the heavy wet stuff!
6647324,prov1800,2022-04-12 15:27:00,5010,"Everything was coming alone nicely up here.Was seeing some grass and snow banks were going down and most of the surface snow on the lakes was almost.This apparently is going to change tomorrow with a pretty bad system coming from south of the border and the prairies in the West.Could get up to 50 cm(25"")With some nasty winds."
6647330,Luckydawg13,2022-04-12 15:39:00,363,Thanks for reminding me that things can always be worse we had a dusting of snow last weekend but have had open water for about a month
6647336,That Minnesota guy,2022-04-12 15:40:00,8293,I would feel sorry for you but we have our own issues South of the border.
6647338,pjshorthorn,2022-04-12 15:41:00,5654,The gift that keeps on giving.. PjShorthorn
6647346,prov1800,2022-04-12 16:58:00,5010,Can do without that gift.We got this gift starting last Nov.
6647348,prov1800,2022-04-12 17:00:00,5010,You might get some of it maybe.
6647352,prov1800,2022-04-12 17:02:00,5010,Where you at
6647354,Luckydawg13,2022-04-12 17:18:00,363,Northern Illinois
6647364,prov1800,2022-04-12 19:05:00,5010,Ok I can see that.have a buddy in South by Joliet and they had bad ice to no ice he said.We havè solid 2 ft yet.
6647428,Skywagon,2022-04-13 05:31:00,1106,"John, thanks to this post you have brightened up my life! I have been depressed for several years, why has it been so difficult to catch those 30"" walleye, could it be me? Now I can clearly see that it is not my fishing skills, but instead a faulty metric conversion chart. It hit me when you calculated for us that 50 cm = 25"" of snow, I knew then the chart I was using was defective, mine only showed 19.68"". After doing some quick re-calculations I saw that all those 60cm walleye I had been catching were actually the fish of my dreams, I just didn't realize it at the time. The kicker in that good news is the pile of snow they are forecasting will be damp and hard to move, the kind where a snowblower will not work. The ice is still up to the handles on the auger, at this rate it is shaping up to be a late ice-out, fine with me, I like fishing on the hard stuff."
