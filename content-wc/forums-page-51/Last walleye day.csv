6648680,walleyecheek,2022-04-17 14:00:00,2231,I dont know why anybody would want to kill a sturgeon just to smoke it ? I would rather eat smoked carp than smoked sturgeon !
6648698,Eckohlt,2022-04-17 15:10:00,3685,"Best smoked fish I've ever had was a sturgeon from ice fishing lotw,it was a smaller sturgeon."
6647990,prov1800,2022-04-14 18:33:00,5010,Woke up to a foot of snow this morning.No power outages so that's a bonus and no broken trees.Plowed my yard out a bit and took off for the shack on Edward.Drove out on lake at the launch and broke through but climbed back up on some good ice..Deep snow on the lake..One hole was open and had a few minnows in shack from weekend.Caught 2 right awày and then Wayne came by and he broke through with his plow truck so after and bit of them and breaking a few tow straps we got him out so back to fishing and 2 more quick fish.Wayne left and I caught a few more and took off myself.No problem going through water on shore.Been a great ice fishing season at the shack with many awesome fish all released for some other lucky fisherman to catch this summer.Will be after some lake trout now and will try to get out for some crappies on Cedar Lake.Seems like we will have some ice for a while with a week of cold weather coming and not a lot of melting goung to happen.
6648000,7 Mag,2022-04-14 19:11:00,1887,No one can ever accuse you of not being dedicated to fishing John. If I broke through with my truck I would of headed home and drank a few cold ones!
6648006,prov1800,2022-04-14 19:31:00,5010,"We get a lot of that toward spring so used to it.lol.its pretty shallow there so knowing that it's not to bad.Lets hope it warms up and starts melting.There calling for another 5 "" tonight.ughhh"

6648148,Eckohlt,2022-04-15 09:58:00,3685,You might have to set up a spear shack for your first guests that want northerns.
6648168,prov1800,2022-04-15 10:19:00,5010,I have places that can be fished from shore.Actually very good fishing be cheap on gas.
6648172,Eckohlt,2022-04-15 10:27:00,3685,Fishing from shore the only gas might be from the body n no gas can required.
6648322,Bill Krejca,2022-04-16 05:01:00,6107,"Thanks for the update!! Brother-in-law heading up second week after opening, I keep giving him reports. Bill"

6648362,prov1800,2022-04-16 07:12:00,5010,That would be kinda illegal here in Ontario
