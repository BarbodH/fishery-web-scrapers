6646278,gordy28,2022-04-07 18:08:00,437,Over the years I have shared the boat bank or dock with quite a few people It got me thinking about peoples fishing styles and I wrote up a funny (I hope) but also realistic view on some of the common ones I was raised by a Soaker and taught to fish by a whisperer but I am not quite sure what I am I am sure there are lots of others that this group can call out https://www.northernjacks.com/post/fishing-styles Cheers Andrew
6646342,HeHooksHimself,2022-04-07 21:36:00,725,"Andrew, that is a classic article. No one could read that without thinking of their own group and naming each one. I am all of those at some time or another but usually a soaker. Sometimes it depends what my boat partner is doing. Perhaps I am in the category of Monkey See Monkey Do. If my partner is getting bit more than me I usually inspect his tackle box! Keep up the good stuff, brother! Hooks"
6646350,SweetD,2022-04-07 22:12:00,243,"Nice work Andrew! Fish whisperer here but I do waiver at times and might lean towards soaker at times. My Pops (no longer with us) would sit back in his chair, drop his fake leech on a jig towards the bottom…….that “towards the bottom” is key because he never really paid any attention to where his bait was. He would have a cigarette hanging from his lip and would sip on coffee while his lure wandered around out in la la land. I would remind him he isn’t going to catch any walleye on a jig dragging only a foot below the surface. Inevitably he would hook up on a walleye almost always within minutes of my comment that he wouldn’t catch a fish. I’m not sure he ever set the hook……generally it was just a fish jumping on and then him navigating the cig, his cup of coffee and the fish at the end of the line. He would always use the “fish grabbers” I had gotten him 20 years earlier. Never in a hurry and casually he would land his fish……..remember cig, coffee cup, fish grabber and fishing pole.Not sure what you call that but I might suggest “The Lollygagger”!!!Miss you Pops!!!!"
6646388,nitroman,2022-04-08 06:30:00,368,great article! I am most likely the soaker/greener/whisperer type. Depends on the day and fishing partner and the level/intensity of the conversation. we have no here for the beer guy. One additional category would be the follower. They follow the whisperer/soaker from spot to spot and are successful with little to no effort on their own asking what your using and how you are fishing it!

6646450,gordy28,2022-04-08 09:55:00,437,"Glad you guys enjoyed - definitely more to be named I almost had one which is probably my biggest fault - the memory lane guy He spends his day going from spot to spot based on past successes on the lake or a similar lake saying things like ""One time I hit this weedbed with a rapala and smoked em"" but fails to mention that was in June and it is now September I have also fished w a ""Are we there yet"" - instead of worrying about getting there this person is always asking ""where are the fish, shouldnt we be catching fish, is this the right lure/depth/structure"""
6646490,Pooch,2022-04-08 13:28:00,4618,"All of us, at one time or another are a memory lane guy. Fishing with one all day can be mind numbing especially when they are driving the boat. God love 'em, but there are no fish here today just does not register until the best part of the morning or evening is lost. I think like others, I'm a Mut... As I can be about any of the above mentioned types, though I tend to move a lot. A spot gets a quick once over and if no marks and no hidden fish belly on the bottom acting interested then my boat is moving and gone. Occasionally if I ""just feel"" there are fish down there then I will linger in the area really probing into every corner with a jig or trolling over the area for reaction strikes. Good article. Thanks for sharing. Mut aka Pooch"
6646522,Fishquest,2022-04-08 16:48:00,89,"Thanks for another good read and i've fished with them all. Hmmm Fannys , yes we stop there sometimes for the wings as well..........."
6646938,Walleye2242,2022-04-11 08:03:00,263,Can I be a Combo guy? I am now a combo of the whisper and grass is greener guy. Maybe because i am the fish whisper guy. I use to be the soaker guy as a kid because my dad was for sure. We would troll a shore line for hours because it looked good with a rapala. So as a kid...i didnt know better...thoughts that how it was.
