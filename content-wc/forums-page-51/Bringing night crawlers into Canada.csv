6647938,Spartan1,2022-04-14 14:18:00,46,You should be able to purchase bait in Geraldton or Longlac. I googled bait stores in Greenstone area and there are at least two still operating.
6647942,Jdconins,2022-04-14 14:39:00,62,"Hey thanks Spartan my good man, I guess I could of done that but thought maybe some were better than others meaning maybe some bad experiences some of the fisherman have had on this board. I know Ill get an honest answer here. Thanks"
6648042,Spartan1,2022-04-15 06:27:00,46,I did some further research. Not sure what their prices are but it there are two bait shops most commonly mentioned. Skinners in Longlac 807-876-2245 and Joel's Bait Shop in Geraldton 807-853-1436. I will be traveling to Nakina in early August and plan to reach out to these places well in advance to reserve the bait we want. Hope this helps and best of luck.

If we have them shipped from Canada and have the receipt would that work? Or do we just fish artificials"
6648136,prov1800,2022-04-15 09:44:00,5010,Iam sure there is a camp there you could get bait from.That or go to shore and dig some up.
6648142,Eckohlt,2022-04-15 09:51:00,3685,Every camp should have a back hoe there so the clients can dig up worms.

6647774,staker1875,2022-04-14 06:33:00,13,"It seems clear that we can no longer cross the border with bait of any kind. My question is, with the new BMZs are you able to cross from one to another with Crawlers? All I can find is related to baitfish. We cross at the Soo and drive up to White River which is in a different BMZ than the Soo and cannot tell if we need to buy them in Wawa or if it is ok to buy in the Soo."

The area we fish does not have much for reliable bait shops and precovid, we took our own crawlers. One of the guys tried to call to clarify but the govt agents on the phone could not clarify what the current rules actually are. Does anyone have any current information on if crawlers are allowed to be taken into Canada?"
