Assuming fishing action is good and they are hitting on leeches, how many dozen would you bring per guy per day? Same thing with minnows? We were thinking 3 dozen leeches per day and or the same equivelent with minnows. Sound about right? Ivy"
534044,Guest,2003-08-01 16:06:00,0,For a 7 day trip we go with one lb. of leeches/man + a kicker lb. because it is a fly-in.

534057,dlhomes,2003-08-02 04:58:00,62,Leeches will be petering out so you will need crawlers and minnows. I would think 1-2 doz ea. per day would be plenty. Lots of guys use twisters & cranks. Good luck- Dennis.
