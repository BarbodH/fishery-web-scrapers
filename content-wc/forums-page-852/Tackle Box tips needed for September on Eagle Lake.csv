Looking at my tackle box, I'm not confident I have an arsenal right for Walleyes and Northerns in September. Right now I have mainly jigs for walleyes - Daredevil spoons and dead bait bobber fishing riggings for Northerns (shallow bays in May). For September, where are they hanging out and what are they looking for? I need some ""Go To"" tackle and presentation advice from the ""September"" experts out there. My tackle box thanks you."

Both lakes I fish pike the same as in spring BUT, you may need to fish out a bit further in the bays due to weed growth, AND maybe a bit shallower due to the same weed growth. I like to cast so that is the way I fish and I really haven't noticed much difference in the numbers of fish I have caught in spring vs fall. Silver Red-Eyes (the smaller ones mostly but at times the mid size one) w/upgraded Daiichi hooks to match the size of the original hooks work the best. You can catch HUNDREDS of fish on the Daiichi's and they still stay sharp and don't bend!! They actually are less expensive AND you catch more fish (because they are sharper) when you figure it on a per fish basis."
