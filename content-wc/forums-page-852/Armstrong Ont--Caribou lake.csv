534074,ktfdp05,2003-08-03 06:35:00,1,We are thinking of planning a trip to this area next June. If anybody has any information about quality of fishing and the availability of a camp ground in the area that you don't mind sharing it would be appreciated. Thanks

Here is a link to the place I stayed at : http://www.forrestlodge.com/accommodations.html They have new owners now than when I stayed there but the cabins are clean and cozy. Lots of good walleye and pike spots, lake trout closes mid Sept. and make sure you have a GPS if you want to venture far as it is very easy to get turned around with all the islands and such and you don't see many people at all."
