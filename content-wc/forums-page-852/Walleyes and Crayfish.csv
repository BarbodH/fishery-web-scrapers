533925,Guest,2003-07-29 16:25:00,0,At LOTW last week we had a few days we caught dozens of crayfish with jigs and minnows fishing the mid-lake humps. Crayfish grab the minnow and then hang on while getting reeled in. Some pretty big crayfish too and out in 20+ feet of water surrounded by hundreds of yards of deeper water. Seemed like when we started catching crayfish the walleye would slow down or stop entirely. I've caught a few crayfish before but last week we could have made etouffee for everyone in camp. Has anyone experienced this and what is the relationship between walleye and crayfish? Thanks for any info.

534047,Guest,2003-08-01 17:27:00,0,I've been guiding out of Morson everyday for the last two weeks and about half the walleyes I clean have crayfish in them. The best fishing seems to be on reefs eight to twelve feet. I think the walleyes are eating crayfish on those rocks.
534050,Guest,2003-08-01 18:26:00,0,"Thanks for the reply Richard, I really enjoy reading your online journal. Do you often pull the crayfish up when they hang onto your bait? We caught dozens of them on the reefs in 20-26 feet off of Rubber Island. And it seemed that when we started catching crayfish the walleye slowed way down."
534053,Guest,2003-08-01 21:17:00,0,I haven't caught any crayfish on a hook but that may be because I use a 3/4 oz jig with a large minnow. The crayfish I've found are in the stomachs of the walleye. I flew north about a week ago and found the walleyes there had no snap to their bite compared to the ones I've been catching on Lake of the Woods. I think it's because the ones here are chasing crayfish.
534055,PJM,2003-08-01 23:58:00,3516,Rgate Do the fish have more snap or zap like Fank Zappa?
534064,Guest,2003-08-02 16:36:00,0,"Richard, why a 3/4 oz. jig and large minnow? Do the bigger eyes go for that over a 1/4 oz. jig and average minnow?"
534067,Guest,2003-08-02 19:27:00,0,It works great. We've used heavy jigs in shallow water for the last two or three years. It keeps the lines under the boat when its windy and guests can feel the bottom and the walleyes love them. We are catching more big walleyes here than ever.
