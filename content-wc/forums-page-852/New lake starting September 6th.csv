We had numerous fishing spots for every kind of weather, however, some of the guys in our group wanted more adventure so we're going to Carroll lake in early September. Basically I was hoping some one out there has fished this lake before and wouldn't mind sharing some good starting points and/or might be able to help with some basic patterns for finding schools of Walleye and Big Pike. Also, was wondering which is better, minnow or worm on a jig? Thanks for any help, Jeff (Rookie)"
