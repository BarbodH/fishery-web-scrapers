533968,Guest,2003-07-30 15:11:00,0,Anyone know approx. wait time for Sat. morning border crossings ie: 8 to 11 am at the Thousand Island/Rte. 81 bridge going into Canada? The next bridge is about 30 miles away (Ogdensburg) but would be worth the drive if the wait is over an hour. Thanks in advance for the help!
534024,Guest,2003-07-31 20:50:00,0,Just went thru last two saturday mornngs - wait was much longer coming back to USA in the evening- going into canada- about a 5-10 min wait max both times- coming back - 20 to 30 minutes both times hope this helps.

We did, however, get searched and x-rayed by Cnadian immigration. Upon our return (July 5) we re-entered the USA through Ogdensburg. Early afternoon. No traffic. Three questions by the immigration officer. We were home. The year before, we re-entered via Hill Island (The T.I. Bridge) and it took us nearly an hour."

534043,Guest,2003-08-01 16:05:00,0,Thanks for the link to the border wait times. We're going next Saturday and will be crossing @ 5 in the morning. I expect traffic to be extremely light then.
