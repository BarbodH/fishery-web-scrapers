534063,Guest,2003-08-02 14:41:00,0,The Place and lake have a great reputation and the owner also has a great reputation. All species including huge muskie. They have a good website and herbie will answer you back. Would love to go there sometime but currently go to a private camp on the lower Manitou about an hour below Eagle. Eric
534081,fishmaster,2003-08-03 11:29:00,209,Like he said Eagle Lake has a great reputation for some great fishing and some very large fish. Vermilion Bay Lodge is a great place to stay and is on the north end of the lake. Gord will make your trip a good one. Check out his site at www.vermilionbaylodge.com Family run camp that is housekeeping and on Sunday night Gord has a fish fry for all in camp.
