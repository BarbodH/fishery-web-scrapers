It is in Wabakimi Provential Park. If you haven't been to this lake, but have been to a lake close by, what is working and what is the water level like? I have been reading much about the Mayfly hatch. Will this effect fishing on this lake? I have been to this lake twice before and did great, but I am always looking for more. Would appreciate any additional insight. thanks,"
