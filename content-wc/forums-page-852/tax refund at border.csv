534103,Ivy,2003-08-04 08:04:00,556,"Last year when we paid our bill at a camp which included taxes, we received a tax refund at the border. Is that program in effect this year? Ivy"
534110,E_Fish_N_See,2003-08-04 11:45:00,26,"Yep, they are still doing that and if you come over the border (at least the one near Plattsburg, NY) they have a special on cases of Canadian, beer, $5 off on Fridays and Saturdays!"
534111,Ivy,2003-08-04 11:47:00,556,Was that per case with no limit? Ivy
534113,E_Fish_N_See,2003-08-04 11:51:00,26,I don't remember whether there was a limit but you are only allowed to bring one case in per person to the US.
534117,Thumper,2003-08-04 13:14:00,133,"Ivy, Yes, you can still get a part of your General Sales Tax (GST) refunded to you at many border crossings, usually at the Duty Free Stores that are near most crossings. Or, you can mail in a form afterwards if that's more convenient. Something that started, I believe, last year is that if you make your camp reservations in advance, and pay at least 20% down as deposit, then your outfitter/lodge operator doesn't have to charge you for the portion that you'g get rebated anyways. It's sort of a pre-rebate. My outfitter did that for us this year and we didn't have to stop at the duty free store (which I find usually isn't that great a bargain anyways). And don't forget that the accomodations portion of your bill is exampt from Ontario Sales Tax (PST)! :) - Rick"
534118,E_Fish_N_See,2003-08-04 13:25:00,26,"Ivy, Rick reminded me of something. When you get your itemized receipt from the outfitter (assuming that you are staying with one), make sure that they annotate the amount take you paid that proportional to the lodging versus meals (if you also take meals with the outfitter). The outfitter should show 60% of the tax being the amount of the lodging. Otherwise, the people at the boarder are only going to give you 50%. Where are you going fishing? Mark"
534120,Ivy,2003-08-04 14:19:00,556,"Mark, Rick, Thanks for the info. We put down over 20% when we made our deposit so that could apply to us. We are bringing our own food so breaking things out won't be an issue We are flying out with Kay-Air in Ear Falls. And heading to one of his outpost lakes. We did a day trip with him last year when we were staying at a resort on Lac Suel. We liked his service and attitude. And when he said he would fly in our beer ahead of time to save on the weight, I said, ""You got your self a customer""! Only a few days left to go. Ivy"
534121,Guest,2003-08-04 14:33:00,0,"Ivy, for the last few years the outfitter I use has refunded my GST/PST at the lodge as a credit on my bill. I haven't had to stop at the border for a refund in about 4 or 5 years. You might ask if your outfitter does that. Have a great trip."
534122,E_Fish_N_See,2003-08-04 14:46:00,26,"Did he say, fly it in for free or would there be an additional charge? Watch out for those little sneaky things."
534124,Ivy,2003-08-04 15:03:00,556,"I hear ya. Said there would be no charge. I thought about it since then and I suspect he has to be there anyway to check up on the group that would be coming out when we are comng in. Figured he would drop it off then. We have 7 guys going. Bringing 70 doz. minnows, 3 lbs of leeches and some worms. Hope that covers the live bait situation. Ivy"
