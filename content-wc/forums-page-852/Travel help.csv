534005,Guest,2003-07-31 09:33:00,0,Travel north of Vermillion Bay in a few weeks. What is the quicker/easier route going from I Falls. Route 71 near Kenora or route 502 thru Dryden? Thanks in advance
534006,Guest,2003-07-31 10:03:00,0,502 will likely be faster and easier
534009,jeffster,2003-07-31 10:49:00,163,For a smoother and safer ride if you are pulling a boat take 71 For a shorter and a little crazy ride take 502 jeffster
534012,Guest,2003-07-31 11:25:00,0,502 is 23 miles shorter but has a lot more hills and curves. Also if you have a breakdown there is nothing between hwy 11 and Dryden. Hwy 71 is a better road with some communities and camps along the way.

As I remember the higway arround LOTW as longer but easier to drive with wider shoulders and more opportunites to pass or pull off the road. Highway 502 shoulders are quite narrow-almost nonexistent in places. If you get behind a log truck on 502, you will be behind for quite awhile. Also the highway along LOTW has places to stop for a bite to eat and to buy ""needed fishing tackle."" As you can see my preference is the route along LOTW."
