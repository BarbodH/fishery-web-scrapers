Remember to bring your old card,the agent can swipe your old card to access all the info & speed up the whole process."
4856633,NP4ME,2016-05-20 18:05:00,378,"Thank you, gentlemen. And thank you, Shellback, for the link. Much appreciated."
4856721,pjshorthorn,2016-05-20 18:30:00,5654,"I just renewed my outdoors card and new license online through the link that Shellback provided. If you input your outdoors card number, everything populates automatically. All you have to do is update any information,choose you license choice and then pay with a credit card. The process is very easy and the prompts walk you right through what to do. PjShorthorn."

4857385,jdan9,2016-05-21 06:26:00,5,What's an outdoor card?
4857409,pjshorthorn,2016-05-21 06:33:00,5654,"The outdoors card is a fee that all sportsmen must pay to hunt or fish in Canada. The card is good for 3 years,costs $9.00 in Canadian funds, and the dollars are used to support the Department of Ministry's efforts to maintain a quality hunting and fishing program in Canada. PjShorthorn."
4857441,wallydave,2016-05-21 06:50:00,2151,"You need the card to buy your license, the link above is easy to use. The process takes minutes, you can print out your license, the card is mailed in a couple weeks. My wife says I'm a card carrying Hoser now eh!"
4858657,Oldschool,2016-05-21 14:28:00,163,"If for some reason you do not know your card number, as in having misplaced it, then the web will not work. At that point, one must call the agency, but with four tries to date, no-one will ever answer. Must be my punishment for having lost the card. Oh well, I will just have to stop when I get to Canada, and maybe even spend a few bucks on extra tackle, bait, or whatever"
