4849737,Shellback,2016-05-18 12:22:00,8083,What other routes are available from Niagara Falls to 400 N?
4850129,northernbite,2016-05-18 14:22:00,1186,"This is true, I travel it all the time so until something changes I'll keep on using it. Or take QEW to 427, 401 to 400. You won't like it.Paul"
4850345,Bobby Winds,2016-05-18 15:45:00,10817,"That depends on where you are going in Ontario............but I believe if you are going thru NF you have the best route to cross into Canada......the Peace Bridge can be a nightmare most days....not saying you will have a Sunday drive into Canada.........but for me, the Rainbow Bridge is the way to go on almost any day or night compared to the other options."
4850393,FrankLeigh,2016-05-18 15:51:00,80,"From the Falls take QEW to Hwy 427 (just before Toronto), North to Hwy 401 East and then to Hwy 400. It used to be the only real option, but now it depends on the time of day, as others have said. There is also a Bass Pro just a couple of miles up the 400. Good Luck FrankLeigh"
4850817,chris.brock,2016-05-18 19:11:00,112,"If this is the case, take the 407 for sure, keep left as you come towards Burlington and take it for 30 minutes to the 400. The 407 goldmine was sold to a foreign company, so please everybody screw them as best as you can."
4852561,Wawajake,2016-05-19 10:22:00,413,"Highway 401 is the busiest highway in North America thru Toronto, so you want to avoid it unless it is after 7pm and before 6am or Sunday. So taking the 407 is best option to avoid parking lot 401. In your case since they can't trace your plate it will be a free ride...lucky guy!"
4852809,Shellback,2016-05-19 11:30:00,8083,Alrighty! That makes it sound better.
4848177,Shellback,2016-05-18 05:19:00,8083,"I may be traveling through the Toronto area in July.Do all the toll roads accept cash? We have some here in the states that require Ezpass only, as there are no attendants."
4848209,martinbns,2016-05-18 05:35:00,1520,"The only toll road to my knowledge is the 407 and it's all electronic. They will mail you a bill, if you are renting a car the bill will be padded by the rental car company."
4848217,martinbns,2016-05-18 05:35:00,1520,"I would also say, depending on where you are going it's pretty easy to avoid it if you are concerned about it."
4848241,northernbite,2016-05-18 05:51:00,1186,PM sent Shellback
4848409,Bobby Winds,2016-05-18 06:53:00,10817,Avoid the 407 ETR at all cost if you can.........it's about $1 per mile plus a $3 surcharge if you don't rent one of their transponders.
4848697,Seanik,2016-05-18 08:10:00,218,"I see you are from Pennsylvania, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania refuses to share it's license plate data with Ontario. It goes back to issues about sharing data when possible tolls for Interstate 80 in Pa. Without the license plate data the 407 doesn't know where to send your bill. Our neighboring states, Mich. Ohio and NY. share their license data with Ontario and the 407. Seanik"
4849153,Bobby Winds,2016-05-18 09:50:00,10817,Well if that is TRUE use the 407ETR to avoid Toronto traffic.....almost no traffic on the 407 because of the cost....
4849585,adempsey,2016-05-18 11:42:00,963,"The 407 ETR is the only toll road at the moment. The 407 is great when there is bad traffic. Whether or not it's worth the cost is subjective. I use it often when I am traveling through Toronto, but I have a transponder. You can calculate the cost here:https://www.407etr.com/en/tolls/toll...alculator.htmlIf you're going to be in Toronto during prime rush hour (4pm to 7pm weekdays), it's worth serious consideration."
4849673,acplumber,2016-05-18 11:55:00,80,"Every time I use it, it's about 30$ a pop If going through Toronto try to not be going at 630-10am and 330-7pm"
4849713,Shellback,2016-05-18 12:17:00,8083,"$30.00? I'll have a boat trailer also. Just did a trip to VA, and went through the Fort McHenry tunnel in Baltimore. $24.00 going south, and $12.00 going north. Can't figure that out. Was Ezpass so I'm waiting on a reply. Sounds like if I have a PA plate, they can't send me a bill in Toronto. Rather not take the chance and get a fine and toll at a later date. I take it there's no toll collectors."
