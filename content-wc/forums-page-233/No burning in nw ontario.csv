4845001,Bakefish,2016-05-17 06:55:00,1077,"If I'm reading this right it says that if you rent a cabin you can charcoal grill. Anyone else translate it this way? I'm not a smart man, but I do know what love is."
4846273,MN_Moose,2016-05-17 12:01:00,964,"Agree. That's how I read it. Charcoal You can use a charcoal installation in a restricted zone, only if you are at a location where you own or legally occupy (e.g., rent a cabin) the building. Your installation must: be within 100 metres of the building be at least 1 metre from any flammable material be completely extinguished safely dispose of all ashes and coals before installation is moved or left unattended"
4847073,pikeman14,2016-05-17 16:28:00,144,Thanks for the updated info fellas...it's much appreciatd
4819850,Walleye_Guru,2016-05-09 19:54:00,62,"NW Ontario is under a burning ban. No fires at all! They called and advised us to inform our guests. I don't know about other areas, but the Nipigon region is REALLY dry and water levels low. Be careful and good fishing."
4820098,prov1800,2016-05-09 20:45:00,5010,Same here in the vermilion bay area right to the manitoba border where there are fires hoing on now.rain forcasted for wed/thurs/fri.hope there right.water levels are very low especially lac seul.somewherecaround 6-7 ft low.or more.
4820202,falkopat,2016-05-09 21:13:00,44,"1800 prov you have stated the water is very low on lac suel multiple times, but when I compare data on the lac suel watershed website it shows it right where it was last year. Maybe .5 ft lower than last may/April start. Yes it is 7 feet lower than September but that seems normal every year. Is the website wrong.thanks for any info."
4820282,prov1800,2016-05-09 21:33:00,5010,Not sure.i dont keep track of statistics. Just live in the area and keep people informed on what i see.as far as lac seul is concerned its lower than normal.yes its usually low.the sioux lookout area is also lower than normal which will effect the NW side of the lake.someone pisted puctures of the deception bay landing you should find them and look at them.not sure if you have been there but those pictures are really something else.and this spring or opening season will be lower than some people are used to.
4823050,bushead11,2016-05-10 15:05:00,151,so i assume this means no wood camp fires at our outpost cabin? Is this something that could be lifted before we leave next Thursday?
4823474,Skywagon,2016-05-10 16:59:00,1106,"I can't imagine the burning ban changing too soon, it has been a dry spring to date. Here is a news blurb from the CKDR website http://www.ckdr.net/news/1152482591/...es-well-others"
4825602,123chadder,2016-05-11 08:55:00,429,is this in effect in the white river area?
4825978,Obabikon,2016-05-11 10:29:00,2370,It was in effect on Lake of the Woods too... but we did get quite a bit of rain last night. I'm not sure if they lifted it or not.
4830834,prov1800,2016-05-12 21:18:00,5010,Hope they keep it on.
4833370,Obabikon,2016-05-13 16:46:00,2370,"Rained more yesterday and snowed today on LOTW. I saw a sign for a fire ban, but I can't imagine them keeping it on much longer. The ground is very wet in our area now."
