This will be her first trip to Canada since she was around 5 and will be her first ""fishing"" trip as opposed to playing on the beach, etc. My goal for the trip is to just put her on a lot of fish, regardless of species, while also having some variety mixed in for pike, bass, walleye and maybe a muskie along the way. I have never ben to this part of LOTW before so I would be curious what to expect. Obviously I plan to take full advantage of their guiding opportunities, however, for that time of year I would like to hear from people who fish that area to get a better idea of what to expect. Thanks in advance for your replies. Take care, Ruddiger"

I imagine the fishing isn't much different than in July. I could tell you to look for the usual places and you should find fish, but more importantly, take full advantage of their fishing program. Witch Bay will provide you with staff that will put you on fish. There is a nice weedline right off the dock. Our last night there we fished from the dock and caught Northern, Walleye, Crappie and Perch."
