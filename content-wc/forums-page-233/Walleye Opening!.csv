4842393,bones82,2016-05-16 11:56:00,121,You will be coming in right after us Jim. We will try to leave a few in Scotty and Dumpy. Water levels have dropped over a foot in the last week though.
4843657,Jimmy Mac,2016-05-16 18:27:00,96,"I have a friend who has a place north of Ignace where we have been going for the last 9 years on the opener. We fish a number of lakes and always do great getting walleyes and lakers. I haven't been able to sleep because I'm so excited! As my buddy always says; ""Life is good in the bush, eh?"" Jimmy Mac"

4858169,wallydave,2016-05-21 10:54:00,2151,Good luck to all starting the Walleye opener! Tell us how you did!
4858505,Obabikon,2016-05-21 12:50:00,2370,"Fishing seemed like it was pretty good this morning. Guides and guests all came in with plenty of fish to eat. I don't think anyone was breaking records, but everyone caught plenty to eat. Lots of 16"" walleyes, and several over 20"" that were released."
4860961,bthomas3333,2016-05-22 14:47:00,465,Fishing Hawk Lake. Got my 30 for the opener! B-

4822834,Golden Eagle,2016-05-10 14:14:00,2642,"Yep, gonna bend my heavy rods with huge pike and maybe even stretch 65# PowerPro line. Hope to run across a couple of 26"" pike the first week. In past years have had a tough time getting a lunch under the slot. Anything bigger than 26"" won't slime my boat. Appreciate the heads up though. It's good to let others know."
4823522,Bigstorm,2016-05-10 17:09:00,799,I'll be up there the last week of June
4823554,Skywagon,2016-05-10 17:11:00,1106,"I just made a quick trip south to check the roads out for you Golden Eagle. From exit 212 on I57 to the north end of 502 is clear sailing, road construction is minimal. Welcome home!"
4824234,Golden Eagle,2016-05-10 20:21:00,2642,Thanks. Is everything in the ground?
4825274,Skywagon,2016-05-11 07:30:00,1106,"Half done, they are waiting on dry weather. Was a quick trip to take care of some business and pick up necessities. Always nice to go down south this time of year, that way I get to see spring come twice."
4826522,Knoxabilly,2016-05-11 12:51:00,225,Come say Hi- I think we would get along!
4827746,Rich B,2016-05-11 20:45:00,1081,"Next Thursday 2 of my fellow ""Buckeyes"" and I head north to my nephew's home outside of Milwaukee, and then ""dark-thirty"" Friday we head north to Vermilion Bay and Cedar Point Resort. Our group has fished the Cedar chain about 8 or so years now, and enjoy the various bays, etc to fish.....Ray & Kathi run a great camp, and have become good friends. It will be hard to get a good night's sleep next Weds evening (ha).....that's not all bad though, as if you can't get excited about fishing the Ontario Spring Opener, well, then it's time to find another sport to enjoy. Faith, Family, Friends......and fishing.... Rich B"

4819842,Golden Eagle,2016-05-09 19:53:00,2642,For me it's the 32nd consecutive walleye opener on the same lake. Had to wait a couple of times for ice to blow away from camp so we could touch down. Has never been less than great. Fishing during time of change is rewarding. Going in May 14 for 2 weeks.
