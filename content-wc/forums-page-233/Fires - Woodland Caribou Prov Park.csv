Several camps in Woodland Caribou Prov Park are not yet able to open due to flights.Anyone use Showalters on Hammerhead or Carroll Lakes?"
4864409,saikk,2016-05-23 14:32:00,14,"Check with your outfitter. One of the fires took a good run in the park yesterday with the big winds. Liaised a rescue with a couple that was on a canoe trip and got burnt out. They told us they only had time to grab their paddles and life jackets and jump in their canoe, everything else got burnt. Lucky they had their personal locator beacon or if would have been a long trip out. 55 km SW of Red Lake. Was talking to a MNR helicopter pilot who was going to do the flight, he said several MNR fire crews got burnt out as well. the fire is too big so they are only doing some strategic control on some of the boundaries and value protection. You can google fires / MNR and find a link where they display where the fires are."
