The closer to nakina the fly-in, the lower the $. Basic cabins, but well maintained. Most of all, chad will always do whatever he can to accomadate your group"

Osullivan lake outfitters have really good rates aswell,http://www.osullivanlakeoutfitters.c...ing_lodge.htmlMike Borger did a report with these guys. Abamasagi is on my list to try out. And they offer the option to boat in for a cheaper option. TLO rates are really good to as Matt had said. And they have a ton of lakes"

They area mostly adventure fishing meaning that you drive to a lake each day and throw smaller tinny's around. There are some limited options for bigger boats. Many lakes have lots of walleye. One day last September, we had a 120 walleye day for 2 guys. The norm for us is 30-40 a day depending on the lake and weather.PM If you're interested in more details. I have been going in September for the last 15 years."
