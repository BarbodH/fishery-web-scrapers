Looks pretty normal for this time of year. I can remember getting on the house boat one year in the 1st or 2nd week of June at Hudson and the water was so low we had load our gear on to the roof and carry it down the ladder!! Pelican narrows and rags shortcut was not passable in a houseboat! Now that was low water conditions! If I recall correctly usually we didn't try the rags shortcut in the houseboat unless the water was at 1168ft. We might have squeeked by +/- a foot but it was tight!

4852729,tv4fish,2016-05-19 11:00:00,2694,Holy crap!!! If the water gets any lower - they can just extend that concrete cribbing to the other shore and then we can access the lake from 2 spots..................
4852865,prov1800,2016-05-19 11:50:00,5010,When they put it in water must of been lower.it still goes a long way under that water.and there is two ramps.real nice.
4788138,Bob/MN,2016-04-30 09:45:00,178,Are there any reports of ice out around Deception Bay?
4788794,prov1800,2016-04-30 14:48:00,5010,Iam sure its open.most lakes are open.eagle is and i know abram is to.
4788994,redryder,2016-04-30 15:51:00,33,"Deception Bay is ice free as far as you can see from the boat launch, but I'm betting you can't get up past Deception light just yet. Maybe another week. Water is waaay low right now."
4789050,prov1800,2016-04-30 16:01:00,5010,Iwife stays on abram and she said the dock at the house is laying on the rocks where normally there is 6-7 ft there.
4789146,redryder,2016-04-30 16:32:00,33,"I live on Abram Lake and my little bay just went ice free today. Still big stretches of ice on the main lake, but it will go fast. Lake is low but water is coming up fast. Not as low as last year but still low. Still dry weather in the forecast. Need rain to bring Lac Seul up"
4807122,redryder,2016-05-05 13:01:00,33,Deception Boat Launch at noon on May 5th. Low water levels.
4807154,tv4fish,2016-05-05 13:12:00,2694,Yup --- That IS low - darn low. Is there even any water running under the road (culvert) that is east of there???From the Red Pine Web cam (Abrams/Minnitaki Lake) just southwest of Sioux Lookout:http://www.fishredpine.com/webcam.html
4807202,bigwalleye1,2016-05-05 13:28:00,2632,We need a rain dance up there. Badly.
4807482,Guest,2016-05-05 14:57:00,0,The Lake level has been a lot lower than that. At least a foot or 2. It will just make it easier to catch
4842737,BenBeattie,2016-05-16 14:19:00,232,"The first completely ice free day on Lac Seul this year was May 5th. The last part to go out is in the centre islands, in the biggest water on the lake, between Manitoba Point and Eagle Island. The water is low, yes, but that is completely normal. I've seen much lower."
