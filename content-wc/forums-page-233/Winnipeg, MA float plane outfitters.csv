4835594,LoDo,2016-05-14 12:41:00,721,Anyone on this site know of an outfitter out of Winnipeg that will fly a small group to a private camp? The camp is located in the Woodland Caribou Pro Park. Thank you
4836274,zeebee,2016-05-14 18:40:00,1144,Im sure these fellows can arrange transposition from Wpg airport to their base....presuming that is what you are seeking. Their float plane dock at Silver Falls is directly on path between Wpg and Caribou Park.http://www.bluewateraviation.ca/air-charter/
4836482,AMPHIB206,2016-05-14 19:53:00,191,Northway Aviation also does charters out of St Andrews airport. They fly new amphib Cessna Caravans. http://www.northwayav.com
4836698,zeebee,2016-05-14 21:32:00,1144,"You need at least 10+ on board to cover the cost of a Caravan. OP refers to a small group,"
4837314,LoDo,2016-05-15 07:03:00,721,"Our usual trip is a flight from Denver to Minneapolis, 10-11hr drive to Red Lake, hotel and a float flight from Chimo Air west to a private camp in Woodland Caribou Prov Park. Our six from Denver are willing to a pay a few hundred more to minimize the long drive. The float place from Winnipeg or Int Falls into our camp is best case scenario. Me personally, I don't mind the drive as its always been part of the trip, time to catch up with our midwest friends that we usually meet in Minny, making a few stops at our regular spots, etc...."
4837362,AMPHIB206,2016-05-15 07:16:00,191,"Ok. I didn't have the exact number of passengers. But to have 10+ passengers on a Caravan to break even? They only have seats for 9 (and 1 for a pilot). That's a violation of CARS. If 1 person wanted to charter a Caravan; he could, as long as he wants to pay the going rate. You don't have to overbook a flight to make money. I hope the OP finds a company and enjoys his time up in God's country. Cheers!"
4837522,bthomas3333,2016-05-15 07:52:00,465,"I looked into chartering a flight for our group from Winnipeg to Woodland PP a couple of years ago. There was a 2-3 person option/ 6-8 option/ 8+ person option. If I remember correctly, it was in the neighborhood of 1000 pp rt on the smaller size and 600-800 pp rt on the larger size. The issue was that some of the guys were 100% for spending that kind of money to cutout the 6-7 hour drive each way plus car rental to red lake and the extra overnight in RL others weren't willing to spend the extra $$$. To me the car rental was pretty high and the hotel added a hundred so it wasn't that bad of value. In the end only 2 guys wanted to do it and for 1000 we passed.I guess the point is you are talking about quite a bit more than a few hundred extra to eliminate the drive.B-"
4837826,campchick,2016-05-15 08:45:00,96,"This is a good thread. People are always shocked at the price of chartering planes and it doesn't hurt to remember the reality outfitters have to live with. Maybe the ""high prices"" fly in outfitters charge are justified after all. A good portion goes straight to the airlines."
4838322,Mike Borger,2016-05-15 10:38:00,1554,That was going to be my answer too. They also have complimentary passenger van service from the Winnipeg Airport to St. Andrews. It's only 10-15 minutes from Winnipeg airport.
4847473,zeebee,2016-05-17 18:36:00,1144,"My bad, I recalled Caravans as seating 14. Flew one out of St Andrews some 20 years ago to Bolton Lake. Fast and comfortable."
