4844985,Aaron-IN,2016-05-17 06:53:00,500,"""game changer""? really?"
4845009,Bakefish,2016-05-17 06:56:00,1077,"OK, menu changer."
4841042,Bakefish,2016-05-16 06:56:00,1077,Just received an email from a camp owner stating that the open fire ban includes charcoal grilling. This is a big game changer for my group.
4841074,Gary Korsgaden,2016-05-16 07:10:00,4090,Sorry about the notice but as a Minnesota Forest land owner it is just a good precaution many fires are caused by missed glowing embers caused by campfires and charcoal grills expensive to put out not forgetting timber cost loss. From my vantage point good idea
4841098,Redline,2016-05-16 07:14:00,73,Where is this open fire ban taking place? We'll be in Sioux Narrows in a month and I checked the Ontario website but can't find anything.
4841482,johnboat,2016-05-16 08:39:00,2014,"Easy fix. Strap a gas grill in the box of the truck and go. If it's an annual trip, buy an inexpensive one and leave it at your cabin. It will be there for years to come. Keep your eyes open on your way up, you'll see a handful of guys hauling up gas grills."
4841538,Bakefish,2016-05-16 08:46:00,1077,"This was in the Ear Falls area, Woman River to be exact."
4841594,martinbns,2016-05-16 08:56:00,1520,"All across NW Ontario, it's crazy dry up here."
4841810,bfish,2016-05-16 09:35:00,1096,"Does the ban apply to on the water? I have anchored up and used a small charcoal grill in the boat many a times. Takes some logistic planning to go smoothly, but very doable. However, for most of my fishing trips, I much prefer bring pre-cooked/frozen food. Rather spend my time fishing than cooking."
4841874,camp chef,2016-05-16 09:41:00,915,Maybe I have just spent too much time in the wilderness with clumsy fishing partners but I am eating a cold sandwich well before lighting a charcoal grill in the boat.
4841954,Obabikon,2016-05-16 09:52:00,2370,"It has rained (or snowed) 3 straight days on Lake of the Woods. So, starting a fire would be difficult anyways. I would assume that they lifted our ban, but I haven't heard."
4842969,Shorelunch,2016-05-16 15:20:00,554,Good! It was dry up in Morson two weekends ago.
