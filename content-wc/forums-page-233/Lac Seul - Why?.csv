4795378,Bakefish,2016-05-02 12:49:00,1077,"First off let me say that I am not criticizing at all. I'm just curious. I've read on here that Lac Seul is a tremendous fishery for very large walleye. I have also read many negative things about the lake from people who continue to fish there. I've read the story about crowded conditions and belligerent guides. I've read the stories about big scary water and long rides to fishing spots every day. In fact, I think I've read more bad stories about this particular body of water than any other.So my questions is, why do people keep returning to this lake? Is the fishing that good? Good enough to offset the bad things I've read? Are the bad stories just sour grapes? Again, I'm not criticizing and I hope no one takes it as such, just wondering."
4795450,Ranger319,2016-05-02 13:21:00,166,"You obviously are not reading enough if you are finding more negative things to LS than positive. Yes you will have crowded spots and ignorant guides, as well as other fishermen, but you can have that anywhere. The thing is, on LS you can ALWAYS go somewhere and catch wall eyes all by yourself. It's a matter of putting in the time to find some extra spots. People travel LONG distances because they want too. Deception is a popular ramp and people will make 60-120+ Minute boat rides to go catch fish. Been there, done that, will continue to do that. All that being said, I can also go 20 minutes from the ramp and catch fish. Some days the close spots will be dynamite other times the far away spots will be better. A lot of people get to a ramp, go a little ways and start fishing. The farther you go, in theory, the less fishing pressure you should find. LS is a big drink of water. With big water comes big waves. Know your body of water, know your conditions, know your boat and most importantly, know YOUR skills and you have nothing to worry about.For me, I doubt I will go anywhere else to fish unless it is a fly-in trophy place. Are there other lakes that are just as good, probably, and probably some that are even better. BUt I know LS, I know tons of spots, and I am comfortable there."
4795474,Carnhzkr,2016-05-02 13:29:00,964,"I've fished all over NW Ontario and most of Manitoba. I started going to LS about 7 years ago and it's the best overall walleye fishing lake I've found, in terms of quantity and quality. I've fished areas where I've caught bigger fish, and I've fished areas where I've had better numbers, but for the consistent combination of both numbers and size, LS is the best I've come across. I've had seven trips on LS and I've never had a poor week. That's why I've been coming back. One of the reason's I like LS is it's an easy lake to fish in mid-summer (windy conditions aside). You know where the fish are going to be - you just need to find a mid-lake hump. You can motor across the middle of the lake and watch your depth. You'll be in 60 feet of water and when the bottom starts rising and levels off at about 20 feet, there will be walleyes there. That said, it's not the perfect lake. I do tend to motor a long ways on LS, but you really don't have to. I get hit by the ""fishing's better on the other side of the lake"" syndrome. I have a good buddy that seldom leaves Scout Bay and he probably does better than I do travelling across the lake to Mckenzie Bay. And you're right about it being a big lake and all the drawbacks inherent with the shear size of the water - it can get difficult to fish or even just get back to camp when the wind picks up. To me, another drawback you hadn't mentioned is it's not the most scenic of the Ontario lakes. I'm not saying it's ugly, but since it's a reservoir, you don't see the granite cliffs and rapids/waterfalls you do on some other bodies of water. There is quite a bit of boat traffic on LS too. I don't mean people are always fishing on top of you, but you might think you're all by yourself and you look around and you'll see five or six other boats in the distance. I at least like to feel like I'm fishing in the wilderness when I drive 750 miles to fish."
4795482,tv4fish,2016-05-02 13:30:00,2694,"We keep returning because it IS a great walleye lake. Yes, the fishing IS that good. Bad things ??? Have you ever gone on a week fishing trip where the weather WAS perfect every day - the fish all but jumped in the boat?? For those of us in the ""lower 48"" - it also is a great chance for a ""get away"" and new experiences. My group WILL continue to go back for as long as we can."
4795586,bigwalleye1,2016-05-02 13:54:00,2632,"I would add that fishing LS for a week makes fishing anywhere at home seem like an effort. Every lake has some downside. I wish more of you would find the downside of LS. If you did, more of you would stay home = less crowded water for me. Seriously, I think it's one of the best drive-to lakes in Ontario with a paved road leading right to it. It's all about location, but it's one of the few places where you are the fishing pressure. You can be as alone as you want. I've had very few boats other than locals motor in on me. There's still the knuckleheads, but they're a lot farther apart than at home."
4795658,BreezyPoint,2016-05-02 14:18:00,1581,"Long and short is fishing is very good on Lac Seul. That is the reason why. As to long boat rides, it's completely unnecessary. I fish the end near Ear Falls in late summer. Everyone says you have to go to MacKenzie Bay to catch fish at that time. This is completely untrue. I fish most of the time within site or very close to where I stay and catch a ton of fish and some really nice ones too. I troll crank baits in shallow water to catch my biggest fish at that time. The bonus is I NEVER deal with the rat race, rude boaters and rude guides because they are all down in MacKenzie Bay.Frank"

4797642,SinOrSwim,2016-05-03 06:21:00,1528,"I understand what the OP is getting at. We are not going to LS this year after being there for about 5 or 6 years previously. Some of that is the drive to fishing spots. Our group is getting older and a few of the older guys don't have any interesting making the 40 to 60 min drive to where we like to fish. Don't drive that far? Okay, makes sense. But, when half your group makes the drive and half doesn't and upon return you see the people that did caught a lot of fish and a lot of 20 to 24"" fish, it's hard not to. Not saying there isn't good fishing close to where we stay. There is. But, when we fish 4 or 5 days once a year and that fishing is spotty close to camp but pretty darn consistent far away, it's hard to NOT go far away. We have also been told by the lodge people and two guides the numbers of fish over 28 inches just isn't there anymore. Not that there aren't very good fish in there, because there are. They all said the exact same thing. Years ago you had a legit shot at a 30 or bigger. Now, you might get one but 28 seems to be about the tops for the most part. We have been going there about 5 or 6 years and 27 I think is our biggest and has been each year. We have had a lot of fish in that 22 to 25 inch range though. We fish in the fall so don't have much issue with rude fisherman or taking spots etc We are trying a much smaller lake this year. We went from flying in to LS so this will be our first attempt at a smaller lake that isn't a remote fly in. Hopefully it goes well. I think it will."
4797834,emma17,2016-05-03 07:02:00,436,"Excellent post Sin or Swim. I hope your new lake proves to be very fruitful. I understand the perspective of the OP. Our first trip to Canada was at Andersons and we put in at Deception Bay. We experienced the guide issue and we experienced the long boat rides. It's funny because I remember my sons looking at all the beautiful water and spots we drove past. All we could think of jokingly was ""what's wrong with that place, or that place or that place."" I chose LS over LOW because I was sure LOW was loaded w pressure- not where we go. Anyway, I know there are good numbers and good size in LS, but I understand the OP."
4809746,rnnonmt,2016-05-06 08:16:00,992,Love Lac Seul! Been making annual trips there since 1982. Ive missed a few years in between the last 30 + years of going but it just makes the next trip that more exciting.
4847913,musicman,2016-05-17 21:30:00,33,"Like the above, our group has been going to LS since the 1980's. We always go with Sioux Lookout Floating Lodges on a houseboat on the NE side, usually going up past Chamberlain Narrows. Why do we go? First, I have hated the years I missed the trip. It is a ""soul restorer"" trip for me, not just a fishing trip. LS lacked the beauty of other natural lakes initially but as years have gone by, I have appreciated her for what she has to offer more and more. In general, we have seen the fishing improve in size every year, although, even now after all these years, our group has not caught one 30"" walleye. I hold the record at 29 1/2"".When the fishing is hot, and the conditions just right (often during a squall), you can't keep the big eyes out of the boat. Doubles every drift of over slots.We have had slow years too, but that just makes us want to come back next year and find some new spots. We have fallen into a habit of checking out ALL our old spots every year before we explore new ones. May change that a bit more this year.Going back to staring at my large scale wall map of LS here in my den in AZ."

4852409,eyedrvm,2016-05-19 09:42:00,48,This will be our first trip to lac suel. Lost island lodge is our destination. Sounds like pretty long runs are the norm. Anyone know if the fishing is good closer to the resort? Wouldnt mind fishing smallys or northerns a day also. Have never made the 20-30 mile one way runs they are talking about.
4852481,pjshorthorn,2016-05-19 09:57:00,5654,IMO you don't need to make long runs (20-30 miles) from Lost Island Lodge to find good fishing. The lodge will have good suggestions on fishing spots and you can always hire a guide for a day to acclimate you to the area. Give the lodge a call and inquire on whether Colin Gosse is available to guide while you are there. You will love fishing this part of Lac Seul. I've made many trips there over the last 30+ years and enjoy it every time I go. Have a great time. PjShorthorn.

4798306,Pooch,2016-05-03 08:17:00,4619,"2008 was my first year on LS with a group of regulars to LS. So I was the new guy on that trip. I've been back eleven times since and find the lake sometimes a challenge. It fishes differently than the Shield lakes we also fish. I wasn't used to fishing so much sand until I fished LS. That took some getting used to and still can befuddle me many times.The past few years I've fished with ""Skywagon"" (from WC) and his buddies and have started to sort of ""get the hang"" of fishing areas that on other lakes I would ignore. Early summer still makes me earn my fish by hunting more. Fall is pretty much dialed in and we do really well then.If you break the lake down into smaller sections, ti's easier to learn it. Otherwise it is just too massive and overwhelming to a new person. LS is still new to me and I find it a fascinating fishery.I've not experienced crowding that others sometimes talk about as I tend to avoid other boats. If someone is fishing where I wanted to fish I go looking for new fish. Which is what I enjoy almost as much as actually catching fish.I get to fish LS mid June out of Lac Seul Lodge for a week, Lake Savant for two weeks late July and a week out of Mahkwa on the middle east end of LS late August. Those three trips could not be different. Different parts of the LS and a totally Shield lake (Savant). Very different fishing each trip. Keeps it interesting.Don't be put off when guys growl about LS. There's room for everyone.Pooch"
4798426,prov1800,2016-05-03 08:37:00,5010,"Lac seul can be a beast.fishing there is definately on th great side.i have been fishing her since 1980 (whow).and still am.have fished it all from earfalls to sioux lookout and up to chamberlain.fished for both pleasure and have guided also.times change.used to go camp in brood lake with my wife and then later with my kids all in a 14 ft naden and a 15 hp mariner.experienced some unforgettable trips.so running there now in my big boat is a joke.people make the long runs cause they feel the need to.myself i dont go far and catch all the fish i need along with some big ones.definatly have noticed a decline in larger fish.by that i mean the numbers per day we would catch on a guide day.around ten years ago i had spotswhere we could catch 1-10 30""walleyes.those days hacve since disappeared.once in a while one will show up but big fish now are 28"".waterlevels effect this.bad spawing on shorelines.but general fishing is still fantastic.definatly a lot busier and people travelling farther due to all the electronics and bigger boats.so far this year with the water being very low and weather so far being dry has the lake pretty close to more than 6-7ft.low.so anybody that isnt to familiar with the lake better be carefull.i also noticed a couple of pists talk about rude guides.iam a guide and can get rude but need a reason first.ill just leave it at that.iam sure you get the picture."

4805042,muskyroller,2016-05-04 19:44:00,56,"Love Lac Seul. The only time people get too close (and that's only been a handful of times) over the last 13 years, it's always the same thing... ""What's your deal, lake not big enough?"" Inevitably it's always two responses... 1. Motor starts up and they leave 2. ""I didn't know I needed a reservation."" Which gets met with...""I didn't drive all this way to fish in your boat."" Usually they leave after that. Usually. We obviously don't do this. If we see someone fishing a spot we were headed to, we regroup, look at the map, and find a new spot. I guess that's the beauty of LS...there's always a ""new spot."" It's taken quite a few years to get a milk run of spots, but we feel pretty good about what we have mapped up and are always finding new ones to add! We got caught off guard a few years back in regards to the big water...learned a big lesson and how to handle the big water, especially out of the Onaway camp boat. I learned a ton! Fishing is tremendous. Several 20-26"" walleyes on a daily basis. I'll agree about 30"". In 13 years out there we've never got one over 29"". Usually 3 or 4 around 28"" in six days fishing. So, that's a little frustrating. But seriously, that's my ONLY complaint. Plus, as you can tell by the screenname...walleyes aren't really my favorite ""game in town."" So, when I'm up there, I cast a bunch for bigger jacks and smallmouth. Wish like crazy there were muskies on the west end, but oh well! I am usually the only one in camp throwing those ""funny looking"" lures...you should see the looks I get with my ""smaller"" musky lures when I pull into the dock. In those regards, I never see another boat casting. I just wish there were more BIG cabbage beds that held more and bigger jacks..."

The water is big, brutish, and, yes, dangerous. However, there are moments, several of 'em during a week of fishing, where it isn't possible to have better fishing. Just can't be better. Size and quantity almost jumpin' in the boat. When the 3 of us hit those runs, we all throw the smile at each other which says, ""Lac Seul rules again"""
4797882,Lake Wisconsin,2016-05-03 07:14:00,1960,"I will throw in my $0.02. Last fall was my first time to LS. I was actually up there for a hunting trip, but that was a bust, so we just fished. Now I will say I chase walleye almost exclusively and know what I am doing, but for my 1st time on LS, I had it figured out pretty good. Our 1st spot I fished (after looking at 2 or 3 other spots and did not mark the # of fish I thought was good) we hammered the eyes. Between me and my partner we ran out of 6 doz minnows in the 1st afternoon. 100 fish in the 4 hours we were there might be on the high end, but it was way more than 50. That same location picked up a 29-3/4"" fish. We did run, but it was because we choose to, not that we had to. Every spot that we thought had the right conditions for a good walleye spot, we caught fish. So you don't need to be a great walleye fisherman IMHO to do well on this lake."
