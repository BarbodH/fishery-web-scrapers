We have taken other fly in trips but never to this outpost. We mainly fish walleyes( jig tipped with salted minnow, crawler, or leech), but my son enjoys trolling for norts.Any advice/hot tips? The pressure is always on ""Dad"" to put Momma and son on the fish.Thank you in advance."

I've fished Donald annually for the past 11 years. We always try and book 2nd week of June but last year and this year we are fishing 3rd week of Aug. A few in our group have been pregnant and new borns and wives take precedence. South Rapids isn't too far from Donald Lake in the Woodland Caribou Prov Park. In June all fish are in the shallows in the warmer water. By July fish will move to deeper 15-18'. Last Aug multiple 22"" walleyes were caught in 30'. I think the largest was 27"". Surprisingly large northerns were caught in deeper water too. You'll have to jig between 10-25' would be my guess in July. Have fun!!"

You have the option of the upper lake (two boats up top). An easy 30 yard walk up the side of the rapids. Below the rapids we had good luck around the LARGE rock at the base of the rapids. I pulled a 26 inch walleye there within 2 minutes of dropping my first jig on the trip. Play the wind for Walleye. Test depths on the wind blown side of islands and bays, and you should have success. Lots of bays to troll for Pike. You also are within boating distance of Eddie's Cochrane and Sandy Beach cabins. We pulled a few northern and walleye in the bay to the left of the cabin. Your son is going to LOVE the ""Arcade"". Looking out to the left from the cabin there is a long channel about a 1/2 mile from the cabin loaded with Pike. Most every cast we would pull a 24 + pike. My nephew dubbed it the Arcade since it was like putting in a quarter and pulling out a Pike."
