Any and all info on camp and lake would be greatly appreciated. I'm pretty sure there trip is planned for around June 10th. He is primarily fishing for walleye and big pike. I'm hoping to get him a jump start on where to concentrate his efforts to get his Dad on some fish. Thanks in advance."
4843601,strength22,2016-05-16 18:18:00,49,Well lee is awesome and will help you out. He will even take you on the lake. Great camp and best location for a camp on the lake. The fishing will be great. The usual spots...the point right by camp we call it thumb. The shoreline by bobs rock by Ethel island. We call them hot rocks. Burnt island....a lot places have fish...ask lee....he will dial you in.

Heck, we had a respectable afternoon fishing off the dock once. Lee will do a great job of marking a map. I'm sure if you emailed Lee he would send a map with some recommendations on it."
4847593,tackleman,2016-05-17 19:13:00,444,"i'm not surprised you cant find ethel island on a map. most groups have their own names for fishing spots, the boot for instance is called the wall, by some, some call it johns point, some call it the instep. just look for where the boats are stacked up and go and join the crowd, opening day will be hectic at the mouth of the river where it comes into gullrock and down by the sanctuary going into ranger (at the north end of the lake). good luck, have fun and remember it isn't the number of fish you catch, it's the good time you have trying that is important."

If there is anywhere on earth I would go with elderly father, it would be Wrights. Easy to put him on fish all day, and Lee will make sure he is taken care of. Great camp, great people. Great time !!!"
