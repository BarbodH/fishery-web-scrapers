Also caught a perch (that we also ate) on a rattle trap. I was fishing with a husband and wife... she caught a beautiful (but a little beat up) 40"" (or there about) musky. We of course immediately released it. Anyhow... the part of my day that was disappointing was that I saw no fewer than 8 boats jigging for walleye. You can argue that they could have been crappie fishing... but that would be a lie. They were in obvious walleye spots, not spring crappie spots. They were all vertical jigging or slow trolling. I know that opener is late this year, but seriously... one more day isn't going to kill you. They were blatant too. One was jigging off of Rabbit Point. One of the most traveled spots in our area. If I hadn't had guests in the boat, I would have been taking down license numbers. Just wait one day please! Aside from that, it was a beautiful day on the water. Lots of fun and fish slime!"

On the other hand I'm amazed you have the luxury to be fishing the day before opening. Apparently my ""finishing things at the last minute"" philosophy trumps having any fun. Congratulations on getting your sh#t done on time.........."
