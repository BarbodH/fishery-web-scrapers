4859425,Moondog,2016-05-21 21:23:00,362,"Ok..........Obabikon.........your math is mysterious. VBAY Gord..........you are right on so many levels. I understand that tax is the way of the land, ours and yours, and people are in bizz to make money. Just sayin'......If you were spending 2 months at a camp in Canada and you had the choice of whether to spend $6.50 (new price decline) US per gallon plus 13% HST= $7.34 US per gallon vs. buying at another vendor for $2.95 US which includes HST.......what would you do??? This is all converted to US dollars based on todays exchange rate, tax is tax. No hard math. Most folks come here with a weeks worth of US gas in their boats and never fill up at camp. Most not all. Depends on the lake, personal preference etc. Those of us that are potentially a captured audience get a little peeved about the freight. We love it here, we love to fish here.......we are blessed that we have the money to spend and be here. No question. Sometimes it does not suck to be us! I just don't want anyone to say ""are you really *****ing because you pay $3.40 more per gallon at camp then town???"" Thats a lot of minnows, brothers!"
4859505,Kartman35,2016-05-21 22:10:00,245,"I mean...in ontario roughly 1/3 of the pump price of gas IS sales tax....Do outfitters actually charge sales tax on top of that? Are they supposed to? I admit to not being knowledgeable in sales tax legalities but it seems weird to be charged sales tax for gas...I went to an outfitter in Quebec who quoted me a price for gas that was higher than what I would pay at the service station in Parent (about an hour and a half of rough gravel away), but I didn't get charged sales tax for it (maybe it was because I paid in cash...I won't name the outfitter incase he was actually supposed to charge me tax for it). Maybe an outfitter can set me straight on this one."
4860033,Obabikon,2016-05-22 07:50:00,2370,"Moondog, I think we'd discussed this last fall. Your camp is a drive to, and they seriously charge 6.50? I charge less than that, and I have to hire a licensed barge to deliver fuel 10 miles out to the lake. As far as tax... you always pay the tax. Most places have the tax included at their pump price, for simplicity. However, everyone pays it. The only thing the operator gets back is the road tax."
4860073,octanehi5,2016-05-22 08:06:00,1104,"If your outfitter lists his or her prices in US $ then you will pay the Tax in US$, If The list in CAN$ Then you get the Can$ rate.Now that being said What you get for your money is in what the outfitter sells you and supplies you with. Most Canadian fishing spots are remote,not may gas stations.If its not in your contract to burn all the gas you need,Its a cost to the outfitter to transport Gas to that location.And should charge a fee to do so.Tax is Tax no matter what country. I have been flying into Quebec Lakes for more than 25 yrs. In most of my experiances,Everything Has been included,Plane,Cabin,boats, motors ,Gas,Propane,includes 110lbs per person in gear and food,anything over that is charged to fly in by the lb. at .75Can $. I would suggest if your outfitter is nickel and diming you to death. Change to a better outfitter,There are hundreds of good ones.The key is to ask your ?s before you make a deposit."
4861977,Moondog,2016-05-22 21:06:00,362,"yes, you are right......we did discuss this last fall. Guess it still irritates me and I know the best idea is to go someplace else. $6.50 US plus tax and yes this is a drive in camp. Solved the problem. We are going to buy fuel from another camp owner or go to town or not stay here. Life is too short to be a piss-ant, eh??"
4862033,Kartman35,2016-05-22 21:58:00,245,"The more convinced I am that you're being ripped off in a way that's probably not legal. As I said in my earlier post, about one third of whatever is being charged (in this case 6.50$/gal) is already tax. If they're putting this on your bill and charging you HST on the gas, there's something wrong. . If there's an outfitter out there that wants to explain why I'm wrong I'm all ears. If I was you I'd report this to the Ontario consumer protection office. https://www.ontario.ca/page/consumer-protection-ontario If you go to any gas station and buy gas and other stuff and put it on the same bill, the stuff will have HST added, but not the gas. I see no reason why an outfitter should operate differently."
4862073,alanexpup,2016-05-22 23:48:00,278,HI. you can bet if the Canadian dollor was higher the resorts would be charging in that currency. we go where they charge in Canadian dollors. look at the rate. it almost 20% now. with a credit card the bank makes all the adjustments. the places that want US are owned by US citazens.
4862209,Obabikon,2016-05-23 05:01:00,2370,"Oh, I was just trying to make sure I remembered the entire situation. I would completely agree that he's fleecing you. My only opinion would be if it is irritating you enough to have a negative effect on your trip... its time to move on."
4851009,Moondog,2016-05-18 21:30:00,362,"VBG, So my question is............ I pay my camp owner in US funds for everything.......camping, wharfage, souvenirs, bait. Then I am charged Canadian HST for the grand total in US dollars. Should I not be charged for what the total is converted to CAD dollars??? I spend a lot of dollars in Canada because I love to fish here. And I fish here for many weeks......buying goods in town etc. I do resent being charged in US dollars for CAD tax. I have Obamacare so I also have FREE HEALTH CARE NOT. The exchange rate is not my fault and with the current rate my camp owner, who pays bill in CAD, is making out pretty well. The absolute last thing I want is to deny a person what is due but ............really??? charging 13% HST for CAD tax on US funds without converting to CAD seems like a rip off. Waiting to be told that I am wrong."
4851041,v-bay gord,2016-05-18 21:52:00,3168,"So what I think you are saying is your bill is in U.S. $ but the HST charged is in Canadian $? I guess that works as long as it is equivalent to 13 % of what you paid. That would have to factor in the exchange rate. If they are charging the tax based on the bill as being in Canadian $, then they are ripping off the government, and the rest of us poor tax payers. Another reason I like to charge in Canadian $, it's a lot simpler from my end."
4851049,v-bay gord,2016-05-18 21:57:00,3168,After re-reading your question....the bottom line is the tax charged needs to be 13% of the bill.......so in U.S$ or Canadian it doesn't matter. When they submit it in U.S. the Canadian government will do the conversion. It should work.
4851081,martinbns,2016-05-18 22:26:00,1520,"When I go there, I pay full freight and full tax with no rebate. If I spend money in the US and pay state tax I can apply the same way. It's call tax reciprocity, kind of a foundational element of integrated economies."
4851121,Terwalleye,2016-05-18 23:27:00,166,"The program that employs a ""few"" Canadians is called Tourism. We're giving our dollars (Canadian or US, already.) Thousands of them. Were employing. already...thousands of them. I'm just saying make it less complicated to give the CA Gov't our money Not more complicated."
4851377,Obabikon,2016-05-19 04:55:00,2370,"Moondog... if they are charging you 13% of a bill paid in US, but asking you to pay the tax part in Canadian... then they are undercharging you. If they are charging you 13% of your US bill... its the exact same as if they were charging 13% of a Canadian bill. Math.... we make it more complicated than it needs, but if you don't get it... don't be quick to point fingers. Current exchange rate is 1.31 $100 (US) * 1.13 (13% tax) = $113 US That is what you would pay in US for something worth $100 US $131 (Canadian) * 1.13 (13% tax) = $1.48 Canadian That is what you would pay in Canadian for something worth $100 US $113 US = $148 Canadian The two bills with tax have the exact same value at the bank. 148/113 = 1.31.... if you divide the two, you actually get the current exchange rate."
4852361,phishfearme,2016-05-19 09:31:00,1242,some operators do indeed only charge half of the HST at the time of payment - it's MUCH easier for us clients but no doubt a pit pf a pain for the outfitter. Ask your next outfitter if he can only charge you half of the HST at the time of purchase and report back as to what the response is. I've heard from one outfitter that he doesn't want to risk losing the 6.5% - sounds lame to me. others I use just charge the 6.5% and that's the end of it. there's a number of threads on this topic - do a search. phish
4852745,v-bay gord,2016-05-19 11:13:00,3168,I can report back on what my response will be. I will fill out the form for you and mail it in but I will not rebate you myself.
4853289,phishfearme,2016-05-19 13:55:00,1242,why not?
4853481,v-bay gord,2016-05-19 14:59:00,3168,"People call me all the time to ask about fishing, cabins, boats etc. Nobody ever calls me to discuss taxes, or if they get any back and in what form. For me to rebate the tax makes me have to change the way I operate with deposits, and inevitably I am on the hook for money I refund should the program change, or a refund is later rejected. I'm not on for that. I'm happy to fill the form and submit it for my guests. If someone doesn't feel that is good enough customer service then I'm a bit puzzled about their priorities."
4847457,heritage2008,2016-05-17 18:33:00,92,"Heading to Pickerel River in June. Lodge is charging me in US dollars but wants to add the GST % in US. Well, my thought is how is this possible since I'm paying US $$$$. Shouldn't they be charging on the value of what the Canadian dollar is set at? I have been to camps where they try to charge for items that ""were not included"" yet I paid the entire bill upfront. I won't name the Lodge/Camp today because I'd like to see responses. I did hear from a past visitor to this camp that they charge for a ""Dock Boy""--what the heck do I need a dock boy for. I really don't see how a camp in Canada is even allowed to charge only in US funds anyway?"
4847513,martinbns,2016-05-17 18:48:00,1520,"Same difference, $1,000 US dollars is worth $1298.70 Cdn. GST is 5%, either $50 US or $64.94 cdn. When he files his returns with the Canadian Government, he has to convert your US dollars to Cdn for Tax purposes, both Income and GST."
4847521,martinbns,2016-05-17 18:50:00,1520,"Missed your little comment, they can charge in whatever currency they want. A huge percentage of guests are American, most Canucks are too cheap to pay the price you guys do. Secondly most Americans don't like paying in anything except greenbacks."
4847529,3M TA3,2016-05-17 18:51:00,2846,GST. What is that 6.5 %. 6.5% Canadian or US doesn't matter does it? 6.5% US or Canadian works out to the same amount. Unless of course you're getting hosed on the exchange rate. Are you?
4847577,3M TA3,2016-05-17 19:07:00,2846,Looked it up. It appears that the 13% HST includes the GST which is 5% for Ontario.
4847745,martinbns,2016-05-17 20:13:00,1520,"Some provinces have combined provincial sales tax and GST into HST, some charge two taxes. Really 6 of one half a dozen..."
4848465,Obabikon,2016-05-18 07:11:00,2370,"On the other hand... if you're applying for the tax rebate, make sure they print off a receipt for the Canadian costs. That way you get your full refund."
4849553,phishfearme,2016-05-18 11:39:00,1242,"or you can just make sure that the receipt you provide for the HST rebate clearly says that you paid in US$ (marking this on the application helps too) - the rebate people will do the conversion and you will get a check in Canadian $$ - which is an expensive pain to cash in US banks (most charge a fee and/or conversion costs). best to send it to your outfitter for partial deposit payment on next year's trip. if the receipt says nothing, it will be assumed that you paid in Canadian $$ and you will get check for the amount you paid (in US$) in Canadian$. phish"
4850697,Terwalleye,2016-05-18 18:18:00,166,"And thanks all for the insight. Our group was crying to each other last year about just this. Paid a few hundred $ tax in US. Get half of it back in CA. Then Bank takes a chunk for their fee. I don't get the whole refund process anyhow. Just a hose job either way. If I get half back; just charge me half and don't pay folks a salary to process the returns? Oh I know some folks don't file so they keep the ""extra"" Hence the hose job comment."
4850921,v-bay gord,2016-05-18 20:33:00,3168,"I don't think it's a hose job. It's a government run program I suppose to encourage tourism. You get half the tax back which is better than nothing. If the program employs a few Canadians then I'm all for it. Plus your contribution helps to pay for our ""FREE HEATH CARE""......... The real crime in your comments is the U.S. banks gouging to cash a check from Canada. A government check. I cash U.S. checks all the time with our Canadian banks. You just let them get away with it........no excuse for it."
