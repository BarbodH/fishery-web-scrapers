4849409,Fisher-man,2016-05-18 10:46:00,422,Haven't been to Lac Seul in a few years. Heading up there in September. Just read that there are no reliable lake maps for the Humminbird or other electronics? Is that accurate?
4849537,Bstar,2016-05-18 11:34:00,564,Check out the Navionics chip/ app. Lac Seul is on there and seems pretty accurate at least for the west end
4850273,bigwillies,2016-05-18 15:15:00,515,Yes. Navionics hot maps is pretty good. Shows the green and red buoys on the main channel. Shows lots of reefs. Still need to be careful though.
4850713,rnnonmt,2016-05-18 18:22:00,992,Navionics is ok. This is what I have but there are plenty of hazards not marked. Its not an HD contour either. This lake has not been surveyed in HD so unless you can find someone that has plotted it in HD or buy the navionics that allows you to share other consumers maps..... It basically wont let you get lost but don't get a over sense of security thinking all the hazards are marked. Good luck/be safe!
4851265,Lmbkiller,2016-05-19 02:09:00,639,"I would say the navionics is simply a background map. Very little, if anything, that is underwater, is marked accurately. I have hundreds of way points that are hazards that I've marked over the last 15yrs"
4851921,worthsr,2016-05-19 07:44:00,52,I forgot to pack the Navionics map chip last year and I'll tell you I missed it a lot. It's a huge body of water and even after fishing there for 25 years I felt uncomfortable without the map on my GPS/Locator. I won't go up again without it.
4856153,CamoHunter,2016-05-20 14:37:00,363,"I would echo Lmbkiller's comment. The Navionics map is good for a shoreline map/background map, that is all. Don't trust the depths. They're highly inaccurate, and are not detailed. As mentioned, it hasn't been surveyed by any company yet. I made my own with AutoChart, and adding to it for a few years now. It has all the shoreline/background map, and any area that we've boated across, now has accurate depth data. Been going there for 15 years now. Wish we had data collected for all those years, but glad we can create our own maps now at least.If anyone fishes around Mahkwa, and wants to share data with each other, let me know."
