Next Tuesday it is looking like a front is moving in with an east wind and much cooler temps for the following 3 days. I know the basics of what to do for a cold front, ie fish deeper water, slower presentations. What do all of you like to do when a cold front hits? Any advice on how to locate fish and what pattern they will be running would be great. I know it is tough to predict where they will be or what they will want, but what is your go to in these conditions? Thanks!"

Next day, air temp around 30. Winds E/NE. Depth between days didn't really matter, but time and location did. Fish started biting steadily by 11AM. Locations were exact opposite of previous day, working shores and points where the wind was blowing into them. Basic stuff. Work the lines where the wind is blowing into. Give it time. Not a day to be the first one of the dock. Let those walleyes adjust is my motto. Eventually they eat."

That week, we were catching our walleyes in about six feet of water, near where a tributary emptied into the lake. A massive cold front arrived mid-week. I found the walleyes in about twenty feet of water, in front of where we had been catching them. We had to fish them very slowly, but we still caught fish. The walleyes returned shallow when the wind switch signaled the return of a warm front. It seemed to me that the fish wanted stable water temperatures, and did not want to have deal with cold water becoming even colder. I fished the same lake several years ago during August. I had been catching my walleyes in about 24 fow, on main lake structure. Another massive cold front hit us late in our first week of fishing. The walleyes did not move at all from what I could decipher. They were in the same places that we had been catching them, but belly to the bottom. We had to present our baits super-slowly to get them to bite, as their strike zone was near zero. It was as if we had to force feed them by plopping our lures on their noses. They key thing is that we caught fish when many others were not. It seemed to me that the walleyes were not bothered by changing water temperatures, as they were already fairly deep. It might have been a situation where the fish were bothered by changing light, barometric pressure, or who knows what. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
