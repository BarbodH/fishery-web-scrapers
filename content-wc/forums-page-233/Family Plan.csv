Used to go to Canada frequently when growing up, and mainly fished the Ottawa River near Westmeath Ontario. We got into walleye occasionally, but not many. I have no been to Canada in 15 years, and have been dying to get back ever since I left. Now that I have my own family and young ones, I am interested in taking them on the Grand Canadian Adventure like I experienced as a boy. I am having a hard time finding a specific lodge that would meet all of my family's requirements, only because there are so many. Although I'm familiar with the Ottawa River, I'd prefer to fish a lake/lake system, due to my concerns of safety with the river and my small children. I've been doing most of my research in the Maniwaki area, but am open to other suggestions. The main features we are looking for in an outfitter are: Clean, comfortable cabin with indoor shower/toilet Safe, Comfortable and reliable boat/motor Meal plan available I would prefer to be within 3-4 hours of the 1000 Islands Bridge or 4-5 hours of Niagara Falls A lake that we could fish for walleye and have a good chance to catch many in a day, and some to eat. Despite their young age, My children are avid anglers, and are very familiar with trolling, or dragging bait rigs and can detect bites and fish very independently. They aren't yet capable of spending long hours safely and capably casting and retrieving lures, so we would mainly be trolling, drifting with harnesses, or vertical jigging. Any recommendations that you may have would be greatly appreciated. I know from reading these message boards that there is innumerable knowledge and experience of Canadian lodges/lakes, and I thank you all in advance for all of your assistance! Jon"

The Quebec government is now placing slot limits most everywhere in the province and that should help. Check out this link, it has a ton of outfitters on the Quebec side. I suppose it depends what you are looking for. I do know if you go a bit further up the highway that the fishing is better at the Cabonga and Dozois reservoirs than it is on the Baskatong. Probably not much difference in driving time either as the place you are talking about is on the other side of the baskatong so you'd have to drive all the way around."

4846737,mickr,2016-05-17 14:36:00,74,"what you want to do with this site is zero in on the map and then click individual locations on the map, that will take you to a ""details"" type pop up about the outfitter and from there you can link to the outfitters website. Most of the website can switch back and forth between English / French"
