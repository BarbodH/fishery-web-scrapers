We have been using a camp that ""could"" support 10 of us. I book the minimum and add on with note to outfitter a week before departure. Not once have I received any lip when extras guys arrive paying full share per man. I've had 15 give me the verbal yes a month before I request deposits and end up with 5 deposits. Rule of thump is date deposit received."
6467452,RichA$1970,2020-07-24 09:25:00,1159,I do the same as Ogoki as the fly ins we go to have a minimum of 4 but can hold 6. We put deposits down for the minimum and the 3 weeks out call the outfitter saying we have 6 and can the plane handle it. It works well as he drops the rate and doesnâ€™t lock us in.
6467082,Ogoki,2020-07-23 12:32:00,291,"Since the late 1980's i have been the trip planner. Booked trips ,collect deposits . Early on I had two very good friends that had emergencies come up roughly 3 weeks before our trip. First thing got said was "" will i loose my deposit"" . I said unless I get a full in. Luckily my cousin and his buddy ,both retired ,we're called and went . Since then I have booked for the minimum number required for the camp i booked and informed outfitter ,there may be more . So if a cabin held 4 to 8 ,with minimum being 4 ,I send in deposits for 4. The rest of the deposits being 2 or 4 more ,I would deposit into my checking . A week or so before leaving i give the outfitters exact number we will have . NEVER had one refuse the 2 or 4 extra people . I tell guys you pay deposit you are booked . But if an unforseen issue comes up . Everyone is covered and no one looses any money."
6467086,v-bay gord,2020-07-23 12:37:00,3168,"Can't speak for anyone else, but if you booked for 4 people you would likely be put in a cabin for 4 people. Phoning a few weeks before arriving and saying there will be more would basically mean you are s.o.l. Glad it has worked for you though."
6467094,Ogoki,2020-07-23 12:54:00,291,"Sorry about that that Gord , I should have been clearer on that . I am speaking of an 8 main outpost camp ,that has a 4-8 man capacity ,on a fly in . I understand full well if i was booking at a camp that had numerous cabins ,then this would not be fair to outfitter or us. Sorry for not being more specific in my original post . Enjoy reading what you have to say on this forum. You are one of the good guys !!"
6467096,v-bay gord,2020-07-23 12:57:00,3168,"That makes sense now. And yes, I do wear a ""white"" mask..."
6467134,jambi,2020-07-23 13:56:00,504,We do pretty much the same as Ogoki. Confirm trip with deposits on 4 or 6 and hope to get to 8. Advise outfitter several weeks in advance of our departure as to our final number. This is also for flyout outpost.
6467182,pike50plus,2020-07-23 16:29:00,584,"If however someone backs out and you can't get their position back from the camp, that should not fall on you? If the camp could carry it over for them and your group the next year that would help the delima?"
6467192,eyecatcher1,2020-07-23 16:40:00,323,"I used to organize fishing trip where I worked. The plant employed close to 2,000 people. In September I would ask who wanted to go. I'd usually have 200 to 300 interested. In January I'd ask for about a $100 deposit. I'd have to work really hard to find 10 guys to come up with the money."
6467200,Obabikon,2020-07-23 16:52:00,2370,"It is interesting that outpost resorts do it that way. I charge $2300 for our outpost, and ask for a $500 deposit. It sleeps up to 8 people. I don't care if there's 3 of you or 8 of you... the price and deposit is the same."
6467240,MikeF,2020-07-23 17:46:00,895,"I found that somewhat interesting myself. I would have thought there would be a set deposit price. Since I have never rented an outpost before, I just figured that is the way they handle it up north."
6467288,pike50plus,2020-07-23 20:04:00,584,Especially for 6-8. And you would have not left them high and dry from this year!!
