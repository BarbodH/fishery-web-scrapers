Here’s my attempt at an uplifting story from a long ago Canada trip to cleanse your pallet.Most of my old Canada stories begin with the phrase “my dad got it into his head”. I’m guessing it was 1975 when “my dad got it into his head” that he wanted to fish the Churchill River in far northern Manitoba. When I tell this story in person, it’s at this point that I unfold my Manitoba road map and begin to trace my finger along our route to illustrate just how far of a road trip this was. We drove to Winnipeg, I explain while tracing my finger, then got on Hwy 6 and went north and kept going north and kept going north through Grand Rapids. Then we kept going north all the way through Thompson, then continued on to Leaf Rapids and just north of Leaf Rapids runs the Churchill River. If you’ve never seen a Manitoba road map, trust me, they’re much longer north to south than they are wide, east to west. It’s a long ways north.On the way up north, we started noticing a lot of dead snakes along the road and the further we drove the more snakes we saw. Soon, each boulder along the side of the road had one or two dead snakes and the entire highway was literally covered in smashed snake goo. I have since read that there’s a garter snake migration that takes place annually along Lake Winnipeg. I’m not sure if the snakes are moving to the water or from the water but we must have missed the migration by a week or two. On our drive home, it was along this stretch of garter snake grave yard that our pickup decided to overheat. Pulled off to the side of the road with the hood up, my dad assessed that the water pump went out. We were about 35 miles north of Grand Rapids, the only town for many miles along this desolate stretch of road. A man driving a commercial truck noticed our hood up and stopped to see if he could be of any help. My dad quickly took him up on his offer. Since the trucker was driving south to Winnipeg, he agreed to give my dad a ride to Grand Rapids. The plan was for dad to pray that he’d be able to find a water pump then thumb a ride back to my mom and me while we stayed behind with the rig.Now, my mom has been a farm girl / farm wife for her entire 88 years so the number of things she is afraid of makes up a small list but right at the top would be snakes, so she opted to wait in the safety of our tiny pickup camper while I stood guard outside to make sure no dead snakes got in. We waited and waited for an eternity until my mom eventually realized she could hold it no longer and she had to pee. There wasn’t any kind of toilet in that old camper, so she mustered up the courage and asked me to go with her as she stepped through the snake mine field to the back side of a bush and I was to once again stand guard to make sure no dead snakes would attack her. I doubt there is a 14 year old boy alive that could resist an opportunity like that, so of course I had to rustle the bushes and make hissing snake noises. I’m not certain, but after nearly 45 years, I don’t think she’s put me back in her will yet.Eventually, we saw the same truck that took the two men to Grand Rapids heading back toward us. The trucker had made the 35 mile return trip and helped my dad install the new pump. That is, they tried to install the new pump until they realized the pump they had was the wrong pump. So 35 miles back to Grand Rapids they went. Again, the trucker brought my dad back to us and this time they successfully installed the water pump. After 140 miles and the better part of a day, they got the truck started and water was pumping. Hands were shook, backs were patted, and money was offered and turned down. We made it home safely a day and a half later. I don’t know who he was, but that act of kindness has always stuck with me and I try my best to help out stranded motorists whenever I can. I’ve pulled out more than my share of cars from snow banks and jumped more than my share of batteries for strangers over the years and when I do those motorists thank me, but they should really be thanking that anonymous Canadian that help us that day.If you’ve read this far, thank you, now we can all go back to trying to destroy fishing lodges we don’t like."

The 6 of us I was oldest at 13 in a 16 footer camper. We left our home in MA and before we left the state on MA turnpike our first of many breakdowns occurred in Pittsfield MA. Highlights of that trip were the state an national parks:Badlands, Custer, Yellowstone, Grand Teton (dad climbed it), swimming in Salt Lake, Utah, Grand canyon and of course the breakdowns. Back then the fishing in Yellowstone for beautiful Cutthroat Trout was incredible now replaced with lake trout. My sister caught a big one and refusing to touch the fish dragged it to the campsite. We are a close family and many memories of that trip start with- do you remember breaking down in Reno, or how about overheating in CO or major repairs in..."

6464376,Bill Krejca,2020-07-16 14:33:00,6107,"Short story = Got really lost in downtown Winnipeg back in 1970 in early morning, Dad and my uncle were with, heading toward Mirond Lake in Sask. Stopped at an open cafe and began asking how to get back on the heading west/north missing highway. A local feller said he was about done with his breakfast and although it wasn't the way he was going, he'd just start out driving and we could follow him to the highway. I don't know how far he went out of his way, but after about 10 minutes, he took us right to where we wanted to be. I really appreciated his friendliness and have always commented on the nice Manitoba folks. On the other hand, same town, on the way back from a great fishing trip, stopped to spend the night in a motel, and was woken by someone keying the door lock, and in walked a not-so-nice feller. I yelled, and he quickly spun around, while saying he had the wrong room, he closed the door. Interesting that the room was directly across from the motel desk. Moral of the stories - There are good and not so good folks just about anywhere, but I prefer telling the first story, as I feel most Manitoban's are great folks. Bill"

We limped it to a shop in Basset to be fixed, it was going to take serval days for the mechanic to get it fixed. With this he loaned us his truck to use while he fixed ours, we were able to set up camp an a river just outside of town and fish while we waited. I can not recall his name but I do recall at some point in his life he was on the Canadian Olympic pistol team, very nice guy.On another trip we were north of Grand Rapids and broke a leaf spring on our boat trailer. For some reason I cannot recall the trailer must not of had fenders and our fiberglass boat sat down on the tire when this happened and burnt a hole right through it. After switching out the spring we headed into the next town up the road and inquired about someone fixing the hole. Soon one person called another and soon enough a guy was putting a patch on our boat so we could proceed. As I recall he would not accept payment either. Great people live north."
