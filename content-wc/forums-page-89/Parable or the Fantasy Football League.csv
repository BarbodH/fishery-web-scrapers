Dick is one of those guys that constantly tries my patience to the point that he makes me question why I continue to run the league. You know the type, he argues over every rule, always looks for ways to get around league rules (no, you can't put your team defense on IR, you can only put individual players on IR), he sends out emails to the other members when things don't go his way, that sort of thing. A few years ago, after a typical barrage of emails trying to convince other league members that we should be doing things his way I had a talk with him. I told him that the only reason I've been running the league for so many years is because I enjoy it, but lately he's been taking all the fun out of it for me. So I plainly explained that if he didn't knock it off I'd replace him. He apologized, but it wasn't long before he went back to his old ways of irritating the heck out of me. After that season, I told Dick to take a hike and I gave his spot to Kevin Swartz, another friend of mine, and I've enjoyed running the league ever since. So what's the point of this story? I guess the point is, be a Kevin, don't be a Dick."

6465560,BrianinVA,2020-07-19 19:34:00,160,I like the parable but I have one follow up question. When the fantasy football season ends is the prize pool rightfully distributed to the players who earned it or do you tell everyone you’ve had a rough season and keep the money for yourself?
6465804,Carnhzkr,2020-07-20 11:30:00,964,"It's fairly distributed, however if the season is not played this year due to COVID, I'm keeping everyone's entry fee."
6465828,BrianinVA,2020-07-20 12:10:00,160,Good call. I'm sure if you keep the money 60% of them will probably still sign up to play next year.
6465860,johnboat,2020-07-20 13:08:00,2014,"I thought the moral was going to be; never talk football with a Cornshucker!&#x1f92a;Just kidding! We're probably not going to get the chance to heckle each other this year, so I thought I'd get one in while I can.Stand your ground, running a league is a lot of work."

6466092,MN_Moose,2020-07-21 07:20:00,964,"You mean this guy?https://cbs2iowa.com/news/local/iowa...-jacobson-dies Richard ""Dick"" Jacobson, a native of Belmond, went to the University of Iowa to study business. In 1968, he founded Jacobson Companies, which grew into one of the largest privately owned warehouse companies in the U.S. You're in an elite circle of friends."
6466196,Carnhzkr,2020-07-21 11:18:00,964,"No, not that Dick. I'll come clean. It's a made up story, as most parables are. I was just trying to make a point. I have actually managed a FFL since '95 and there is this one particular guy that always tries to get under my skin, but he's still in the league. There is no real Dick Jacobson or Kevin Swartz, at least none that I know. I was just trying to make a point that the mods that run WC seem to be dealing with their share of Dicks at the moment and I'm sure that takes most of the enjoyment out of being a moderator."
