6465402,tv4fish,2020-07-19 10:51:00,2694,WELLLLLLLLLLLL - NOW all the rest of us KNOW who to blame this mess on (You know I am just kidding here)...............

6465622,turkeyriver,2020-07-20 05:36:00,80,Thanks for the reminder to cancel our rooms. I HOPE I would have remembered anyway!!
6465646,HeHooksHimself,2020-07-20 07:04:00,725,"Sounds easy enough...and you're welcome. If it is of any consequence, I have enjoyed this thread, so that's worth something, right? Hooks"
6465670,stumcfar,2020-07-20 07:46:00,451,"I certainly would explain the situation and see what she says, how can it hurt. If she says no, at least you tried. I have little sympathy for motels as 6 people can be lined up to pay for the same room and pay 6 different prices. I guarantee they weren't full and didn't need to sell your room to someone else. Good luck!"
6465680,johnboat,2020-07-20 07:53:00,2014,"It's on you.I personally feel any lesson that costs less than $200.00, is a cheap lesson!""Breathe In, Breath Out, Move On""!"
6465700,Lovetofish,2020-07-20 08:12:00,458,LMAO. That's funny right there. Made my morning.
6466434,Aspencreek,2020-07-21 21:22:00,2911,"As someone who stays in motels on average 12 nights a month, DING DING DING, your a winner! Also as someone who has, made a reservation and forgot to cancel, gone to the wrong motel, and multitude of other things, Dumber stuff has been done, but again, we don't talk about it on a public forum....It's a subject to laugh about next year (if there is one). Why I don't frequent Marriotts anymore......made a reservation to watch my son play baseball at the old Humpty Dump in Mpls several years ago, 1 night, it was going to be myself and my grandson. I woke up to find my son never got on the bus to go to the game because he came down with the REGULAR flu, and so did my grandson. So I called the hotel and cancelled, at 9am. When I got my CC bill I found the hotel had charged me the $189.00 for the room anyway because I didn't give them 24hr notice. I called the hotel to talk to the manager, and this guy was what you would expect, uncaring, unsympathetic, tight behind, upitty, little snot nosed #$@#$. Now I used to stay at this fine establishment several times a year, was a Marriott gold member, et al. I sent a nicely worded letter to Marriott explaining the circumstances, and what I got back was a short note basically saying.....too bad. I don't stay at Marriotts anymore, and their beds are the best."
6465298,Juls,2020-07-19 07:58:00,13414,"Really? SMH Now, you have put Michelle in a bad spot, because you....forgot. Don't be mad when she say's, ""Sorry, that's now how it works"". It's not her, or their, responsibility to take care of your organizational skills...or, lack thereof."

6465310,Net_Man,2020-07-19 08:08:00,580,"Not to one up you but....... I once arrived at a hotel in Grand Rapids and I thought oddly that they did not have record of my reservation for the one night. They had vacancies so we were good to go. The next morning after obtaining my original reservation confirmation print out that I left in the car I realized I went to the wrong motel. On my behalf the motel names were similar........I called the other motel and explained my stupidity and they stated that they were not full so they stated that they would not charge me. I feel your pain. Normally I am not the trip organizer but this year I took the reins. I picked a very bad year to step up. Surely not every one has the authority to issue credits in a organization. There is nothing wrong with asking to talk to a manager, explaining your mistake nicely and see what happens."
6465312,pike50plus,2020-07-19 08:11:00,584,"Good one, hoping even a better one gets posted we heed a little laughter here lately!"

6465322,Juls,2020-07-19 08:27:00,13414,I think I would like her.
6465358,Pooch,2020-07-19 09:04:00,4618,"The motel would not know ""why"" you didn't show up. They would not know if you were a business traveler or fisherman or anyone else who was effected by the border closure. I'd still go back and stay there, it's not their fault.We've all screwed up (or forgot) something similar. Don't stew on it.Pooch"
6465238,HeHooksHimself,2020-07-19 06:03:00,725,"I am an idiot. I am sure many of you who have read my posts would agree. Having waded through our own troubles, probably similar to yours - schedule, postpone, reschedule, oops border still closed, September trip on, oops no it isn't, rollover to next year, etc. etc. You know it, being the one that seems to be, by default, the trip organizer I slipped up and forgot to cancel our two rooms at the I-Falls Americas Best Inn for our June 27 rescheduled trip, which was of course cancelled, Now, its not going to break me, but it is about $150 charged to me for which we received nothing. I realize this is, in Jimmy Buffet's words, ""my own da*n fault."" However I called up there when I saw it on my credit card statement to ask if we could split it or roll a portion over to next year since we have booked rooms and stayed up there twice a year for many years. Seems like no one can make a decision except ""Michelle"" who, apparently, is seldom there. Request for an informal poll. Do I have a case? Should I just leave it or should I pursue it. Again, I know I am an idiot, so it is not necessary to remind me of that, but you can if it makes you feel better, go ahead. And....GO! Hooks"

6465242,Bstar,2020-07-19 06:22:00,564,It's worth a try and you have nothing to lose. If Michelle can't help you try going up the chain of command to see if someone else can help you out. Sometimes the squeaky wheel gets the grease but you really don't have a leg to stand on other than your loyalty to the hotel in the past. Good Luck!
6465246,stjoeguy,2020-07-19 06:33:00,979,"Yes, it's your fault, but.... With the border closed I doubt that the motel was 100% occupied, with only your room left vacant. If you ever get a chance to talk with Michelle, request some type of discount. If none is offered you can decide next year if you feel guilty enough to accept your penalty or bring your business elsewhere."
6465268,Golden Eagle,2020-07-19 07:16:00,2642,"When I do things like that, I don't tell anyone."

I've probably thought about it a dozen times, but then life would happen and I'd forget to actually make the call. Thanks for doing something so stupid and posting about it!"
