Mod -2nd pm -Maybe you need to do a tad more reading!! (https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...ad.php?t=27439)Might want to pay particular attention to this one: (I'll end this with the usual ""We don't allow personal vendettas, slamming or any trouble makers on this website"")The info in that old thread needs to be included in the rules since that can't be accessed from your rule tad, if it is to be applied I would think?I'm only frustrated since the mods message does not match the posted rules, IMHOI have never denied any requested information for a poster on this board and have helped many as I have been too.So if I'm nuked the posters can still email me for help!It appears there is more here than is visible?"

But, when you go into a mob mentality, saying ""go to their facebook page and write a bad review"" or ""boycott them!"" ""Go to the sport shows and stand at their booth to let others know""....Then, we have a problem with that, and you, (and, whoever else was ganging up). That is what is not allowed. That is the part you're missing. We can still see the deleted posts, so you can't say you never did that. We can see you did. Please stop now. Thank you."
