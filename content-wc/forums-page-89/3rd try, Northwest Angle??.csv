It's been explained many times that when a thread has to be babysat, we won't let it stay. Scott built this site in 1995, and i've been a moderator here since 1999. The others have been here a long time too, so after years and years of experience, we know what works and what doesn't to keep this site what it is meant to be. Gotta go fishing now....have a great day!"
6466202,pike50plus,2020-07-21 11:31:00,584,"https://www.canada.ca/en/border-serv...-holidays.html Unless exempt, boaters cannot currently enter Canadian waters (territorial sea and internal waters) or boundary waters for discretionary reasons. These reasons include: touring, sightseeing and pleasure fishing. Read more Information for foreign boaters. The CBSA has temporarily suspended or reduced service at certain small vessel reporting sites, small airports of entry, ferry terminals and to the Remote Area Border Crossing program. Travellers should review the list of CBSA locations that remain open during this temporary service suspension."

6466288,pike50plus,2020-07-21 14:47:00,584,thinking about me 24 hours a day??
6465172,pike50plus,2020-07-18 20:10:00,584,Is border crossing allowed to go through to US camps on us soil in the Angle? This has nothing to do with Clarks so don't delete it!
6465184,tandm,2020-07-18 20:33:00,679,No. You can only reach the Northwest Angle by water if you are a U.S. citizen.
6465186,Net_Man,2020-07-18 20:33:00,580,No for customers and I doubt it for resorts owners. You will need to cross the main basin by boat from the south to access the northwest angle.I have been both to Flag Island Resort as well as Oak Island Resort and I found both to be enjoyable places. We typically fish the Canadian waters which is not allowed currently but the Minnesota section of this area is still some of the best walleye fishing that Minnesota has to offer.

6465216,Juls,2020-07-19 02:33:00,13414,"You don't have any previous posts/threads about the NW Angle. We can see all the deleted threads/posts too, and this is the only one where you are asking about the NW Angle."
6465424,pike50plus,2020-07-19 11:39:00,584,"The other 2 thread request were not titled NW Angle, after the two posts I found out that is what it is referred to. I think I used cross into canada back into <MN? There were 2."

6465470,pike50plus,2020-07-19 13:18:00,584,"that is one of themAlso looks like a normal thread so don't know what got it deleted either?On one I asked for a canadian government site that would have the exact details, but at that time it was saying you could cross and had to check back in when crossing back to US, sounds like from the new posts here that is not the case anymore. Thanks for the help!!"
6465476,Juls,2020-07-19 13:34:00,13414,That one wasn't deleted. It's still there. The others got deleted for the usual reasons.
6465516,pike50plus,2020-07-19 15:26:00,584,For your help and patience! Is it not possible on the plateform here just to delete the post and not the whole thread? I know on similar platforms it is??
