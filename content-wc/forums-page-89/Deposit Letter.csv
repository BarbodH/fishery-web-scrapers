I realized that there is precisely nothing that I can do to mitigate risk of acquiring the disease while traveling to the fishing lodge, other than hope that nobody on the airplanes or near me in the hotels, airports, taxis or restaurants has the disease. Three people in our group of twelve elected to not travel to Alaska in view of the risks and enormous consequences of acquiring the disease while in Alaska. Kindest regards...."

Read, read read!!!I will post back any that would have covered this soonHere is Geoblue. I am checking the one Ganglers offers, it may cover this case?https://www.insuremytrip.com/quote-c...3#vlist,tsmartShopping tool for plans From Ganglers - Please note that all payments are non-refundable.

They are still operating (they have domestic customers) and said they plan on keeping outposts open til mid October. If the border closure continues to extend, they offered 50% of my deposit to 2021 and then 50% to 2022 (if I want to switch outposts that’s fine with them). They will also hold the price for 2021. Those were the options as they can’t do refunds but I guess it’s better than some other camps I have read about. I think the lesson learned is to negotiate the deposit as between fires, pandemics or other unplanned acts, you have better leverage."

6464222,fsz,2020-07-16 08:35:00,144,"Not aware of any law or regulation that they ""can't"" do refunds. Its kinda like ordering a rare steak and having the restaurant tell you they ""can't"". They can, its just their ""policy"" that they won't. In my mind ""can't"" implies a legal prohibition. Better for the merchant to say ""our policy is..."" Something is better than nothing. If it were me, I might try to bump up the number of people on the trip and see if I could get full credit for 2021. That would seem like a better compromise if it works on your end. Two years to wait for a deposit to be returned or applied seems a little long"
6464232,RichA$1970,2020-07-16 08:42:00,1159,We put deposits down for 4 but now we have 6 so that’s a good idea to sweeten the pot. Either way so be it as it locks in my September for the next 2 years.

Not knowing much about this at all, would trip insurance cover the loss of a deposit, such as what we are talking about here? What might the cost of trip insurance be? Just wondering...... Thanks!"

6464872,BornToFish,2020-07-18 04:54:00,1224,"Greetings, I was to leave on a trip to Alaska in about ten days. I pre-paid the trip. The lodge owners encourages all guests to purchase trip insurance as they do not refund monies paid. My trip insurance policy has an exclusion for losses associated with epidemics. It appears this is standard practice in the insurance industry. The trip insurance policy has precisely zero value to me. I recently cancelled the trip insurance policy and am now hoping/waiting for a refund. Kindest regards...."
