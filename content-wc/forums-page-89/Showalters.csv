6466532,turkeyriver,2020-07-22 08:26:00,80,I sent you a PM also. Did it show up?
6466542,pike50plus,2020-07-22 08:58:00,584,No?
6465528,pike50plus,2020-07-19 17:07:00,584,Anyone fish Cherrington or Cleveland lakes? Other suggestion welcome for them too. Thanks
6465554,bthomas3333,2020-07-19 19:08:00,465,I know it only based on reputation. I have heard Cherrington has above average walleyes. Big water. Sorry that's all I've got.I usually fish the Viking Outpost lakes if I am flying out of Red Lake. They have a couple of outposts that are also 100 miles North of Red Lake right in the same area.Brett
6465556,pike50plus,2020-07-19 19:11:00,584,Any good size and numbers? Thanks
6465570,bthomas3333,2020-07-19 20:07:00,465,"Hey,Size is subjective but in my opinion I see the Viking lakes as number lakes/stained. I have not fished McInnes which is the biggest water and might have the bigger walleyes. It is often hard to find fish under the slot of 18. It is very common to see a lot of 18-23 in. A bad day is around 20 and a good day is well over 100. I have gotten a couple of 26s over the years and a 27 but never anything bigger. If you want more specific Viking outpost info let me know. In general the cabins are clean and very functional.Brett"
6465576,pike50plus,2020-07-19 20:21:00,584,Appreciated
6465698,Net_Man,2020-07-20 08:10:00,580,It has been quite some time but I had visited a couple of lakes through Showalter's but neither of these 2. I have some limited experience with Severn and Action lake which I could share if desired. Action lake has some portage lakes attached to it. During our exploration we traveled off the map that was provided through these portage lakes. This surely is not the only time for this and we will keep our fingers crossed that we will continue our streak of no problems when we do this in the future!
6465984,kona77,2020-07-20 20:10:00,236,Pike- Our group fished Cherrington 6 times when Loon Haunt had the outpost.. I sent you a PM..
6465988,pike50plus,2020-07-20 20:19:00,584,"Please resend pm, my stuff is disappearing?"
6465992,kona77,2020-07-20 20:37:00,236,PIKE- I just sent the PM again..
6465994,bthomas3333,2020-07-20 20:39:00,465,I'd be curious to hear the information too. I am wondering if the rumored bigger than average walleye are in there. If you need to send a PM that's fine too.B
