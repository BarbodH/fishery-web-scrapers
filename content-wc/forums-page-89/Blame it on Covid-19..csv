I had a good friend that frequently traveled to South Korea. He is an avid angler. He took a traveler's spinning rod with him on one of his many trips. Over a weekend, he and his business contacts went to a lake such that he could fish from shore. His first catch was a large mouth bass. He found out that the fish were planted there shortly after the Korean War to provide a food source for local people. Maybe they are in China? Kindest Regards...."
