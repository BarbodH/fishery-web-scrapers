Her duties include telling me where we are fishing next, how fast to troll, and when it is time to move to a new spot. Hope to take my parents again, they are running out of years."

6467270,billy bob,2020-07-23 19:30:00,13,I second Greg Bruetsch on Eagle Lake. My 3 daughters and I fish with Greg every summer. Great teacher-very patient and he really knows Eagle! I have fished with quite a few guides and he is the best!!!

I have learned so much from him that I can't even begin to quantify it. Additionally, he's great with kids, beginners, etc. I can't say enough about the man. Take care, Ruddiger"
6467476,IaDave14,2020-07-24 10:25:00,99,Basil at Lost Island Lodge not sure if he is still there. We had him 2 days and he kept us entertained. Really enjoyed his stories of Babe Winkleman when he was there filming a show.
6467832,mctbone,2020-07-25 13:25:00,26,Second Russ Warye at Witch Bay Camp. Fished with him twice and he taught me so much about boat control. Also a real nice guy to spend a day with.

6466258,eyecatcher1,2020-07-21 13:28:00,323,I liked Greg Marino. When I used him years ago he was at Anderson's Lodge in Sioux Lookout. He now is at Moosehorn Lodge. I see him on the water now and then.

6466402,rockpt,2020-07-21 19:35:00,589,Francis McQuabbie out of Sturgeon Falls on Nipissing. Taught me how to catch walleye and was the most entertaining fishing partner. RIP Francis.
6466408,BornToFish,2020-07-21 19:47:00,1224,"Greetings,The best fisherman and guide that I have ever met is Mike Parentau. Mike the Guide now guides from Stormer Lake Lodge. It has always been an absolute pleasure to be in the same boat as Mike. I can't help but learn something when fishing, or just talking about fishing, with Mike. Mike's knowledge about fishing lakes on the Canada Shield and decades of experience are truly amazing. Mike is very willing to share his insights with his customers and others at the lodge that have an interest.Kindest regards...."
6466436,Aspencreek,2020-07-21 21:35:00,2911,"He was an elderly First Nations citizen who used to guide out of Onaway on Lac Seul. For the life of me I can't remember his name anymore, just went by his first name. He has since passed. But that man knew the lake, knew where to fish, how to fish and why, and was not afraid to tell you. All you had to do was ask. He was a man of few words, but when he spoke everyone listened, because what he said was ""golden"". His talks about fishing at the end of the day on the pier were priceless, at least to me. Because he reminded us that it wasn't called catching, it was called fishing. It has been almost 18 yrs now since I saw him for the last time, but when on Lac Seul, I still use his kind words of instruction to find fish. If anyone knows who I'm talking about, please remind me of his name, Thanks"
6466458,BornToFish,2020-07-22 05:08:00,1224,"Greetings, Aspen: I do not know the guide that you described in your post. But, I completely understand what you mean when you described your guide as being a man of few words. Every now and again, you meet someone that is a man (woman) of few words. They say something of importance, but with few words and often in a whisper. You just have to hope that you are paying attention so that you can appreciate the wisdom expressed in those few words. The guide that I mentioned in my earlier post on this thread (Mike the Guide) is a man of few words. He often does not say much in terms of number of words, but you want to be listening when he does speak. The world would likely be a much better place if more people went fishing with guides that are men (women) of few words. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6466530,Bill Krejca,2020-07-22 08:21:00,6107,"The guide which I knew best never guided for me. His name was Oscar Brusven, from Morson, and he managed the once camp which was located at Turtle Portage, LOW. I grew up spending 2 weeks around him for years and years. Evenings were spent in his cabin, listening to the myriad of stories he had accumulated while living the north woods life as a guide, trapper, and camp manager. He was a gentle man, whom I respected, and who seemed bigger than life to me, both while I was a youngster, and later while staying at the camp as an adult. Bill"
6466908,Wall-i-Lama,2020-07-23 07:54:00,1524,"Carl Williams out of Green Island Lodge on Matinou Lake in Ontario. He lived in Dryden and guided on many lakes. Never spoke a lot but could put us on fish all day long. Cooked a shore lunch that was amazing. Have not experienced anything like his lunch since that time. The first time I went with him, I asked him how long he had been guiding and he responded ""18"". I replied that after 18 years you must really know this lake! He smiled a bit and said nothing else. My uncle told me later hat he been guiding since he was 18 years old. At the time he was 65! So I guess after 47 years, he really knew the lake. He was one of the old guides that never fished, just made sure you were on the fish 100% of the time. We would not book the trip unless Carl was available to guide."
