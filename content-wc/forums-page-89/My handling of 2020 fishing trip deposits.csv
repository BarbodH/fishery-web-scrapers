I used to frequent a good Italian restaurant in Hamilton, Ohio, but the kids fall far short of what their parents produced back around 1975. Whopper imports some of his ingredients from upstate New York. It's stuff that Kroger and Walmart don't know about."

6465566,Golden Eagle,2020-07-19 19:59:00,2642,"March 7, my outfitter and his spouse stopped by in Tennessee on their way home from Florida. I gave him deposit checks for my party of 6 for the May 16 week and checks for my party of 14 for the July 18 week.We have not been in touch since. We'll settle up when the border opens. My outfitter knows the border is closed. I know the border is closed and my guys all know the border is closed. We'll go fishing. Later.My guys have not been bugging me.We'll be staying home tending to what we can control.We're all healthy and happy."

6465582,Golden Eagle,2020-07-19 20:52:00,2642,"As I wrote, tending to what I can control. No more whistles or striped shirts to rob me of my fun. I was supposed to be above the 51st, eating cake and blowing out candles this Thursday."
6465712,Mojo-NC,2020-07-20 08:44:00,1929,"Same here. We have two groups of guys that schedule independently at the same lodge because of travel logistics. We all had to cancel our scheduled June trip. Four of of the 6 guys in our half of the group rescheduled for August, and the other 2 guys joined up with our other group and canceled this year completely and went ahead and rescheduled for next May. The remaining 4 of us are trying to reschedule for next year now that our August trip has also been canceled. The lodge was okay with rolling over all of our deposits. Bottom line for me is it will be great if we are able to reschedule. However, if we had to give up our deposits for this year it would not upset me. They have had a terrible year and I've wasted money on a lot worse. Heck, I've been paying $800 a month for an apartment in TN for my son in graduate school that he hasn't even used since late March because the entire school went online due to COVID."

6465978,Golden Eagle,2020-07-20 20:04:00,2642,"I haven't been cheated. I've had lots of 2 and 3 annual fishing trips to Ontario, one for 7 weeks and made 6 weeks/5 trips to NW Onrytario in 2005. Every trip was as exciting as the first."
