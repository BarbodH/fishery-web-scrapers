My friend has been researching the lake and says that most the bay has an average depth of like 35 feet. probably a big difference compared to Lac Seul I'd greatly appreciate any suggestions as to what kind of bait & lures are most productive on Lake of the Woods. We are going in later part of August and my guess is that live bat spinners with crawlers are the most popular bait. Thanks in advance!"
6464982,Net_Man,2020-07-18 10:55:00,580,We usually fish early August and the common way to fish is out in the main basin. Trolling with crank baits from down riggers or on lead core is the preferred presentation. You will see some people pulling spinners as well. Spinners will surely catch you fish but it is hard to compete against crank baits in the main basin this time of year. There surely are fish on the reefs and shore line structure also. And you surely can head north by Garden Island and further. Typical walleye presentations will work in these areas. I am not sure how late this main basin crank bait bite goes on. Your local resort should be able to assist you better with information.
6465124,The tank,2020-07-18 18:16:00,340,We've fished LOW for years and for us nothing's better than bottom bouncer and spinners. Gold or pink or rainbow colors work the best. We do troll cranks sometimes but found for us worm or salted minnow behind a spinning works best. We fish mostly mud flats. We have found big pods of fish and stopped and jigged and caught good numbers.
