6462708,Obabikon,2020-07-12 11:00:00,2370,"Just to be clear... you're mad because they raised the price of the trip when they took over. Would you have been mad had they made your trip $740 US (which is right about $1000 Canadian)? There are certainly owners out there that jack up their prices, and use a currency switch to hide what they're doing. In my opinion, that isn't very ethical. If you want to raise your prices by 30-35%... just do it. It is your business, and you have the right to charge what you want. Don't try to sneak it past your guests (who will be upset when it comes to light). Just be upfront and honest. If a resort raises their pricing too much, people will go elsewhere."
6462710,walleyecheek,2020-07-12 11:16:00,2231,$740 is better than $1000.....wouldn't you say ?

6462742,Wall-i-Lama,2020-07-12 12:37:00,1524,"I don't have a big problem with resorts charging in US or CDN. I do have a problem with resorts charging US and Canadian visitors different ""effective"" rates. For example, had a resort charge me (US Citizen) $1000 USD for a cabin and charge a Canadian citizen $1000 CDN for the same exact cabin. They accomplished this by publishing a ""rate"" without specifying if it was USD or CDN. Not only an equity issue, but against Canadian human rights law (discrimination based on national origin). To make it worse, they refused to even accept Canadian funds from US citizens. The website and brochure have now been changed, but I'm sure the ""sweetheart"" deal still exists there. My advice is to make sure you know what currency rates are quoted in (for everyone) and to investigate a bit about who is paying what! Don't be naive to enough just to write it off as everyone is paying the same in both USD and CDN, because that is not the case everywhere. My preference would be to have Canadian resorts publish rates and charge in CAD only. Same cabin, same rate, same currency. Like anything else, let the buyer beware!"

I never fixated solely on how long it would take me to get somewhere, but rather the entire experience of where I chose to spend my money. I've never regretted traveling further to have a wonderful trip. I might be in the minority on this thought process. PjShorthorn"
6462468,bigdaddyguns,2020-07-11 08:41:00,608,"This scenario could be made worse on the supply side if a percentage of camps can't open in 2021 due to financial reasons. That would lead to fewer camps, perhaps more demand, and potentially higher market prices in the future. Will have to wait until spring 2021 to see how this all shakes out and where the longer term directions and trends are headed."
6462530,3M TA3,2020-07-11 12:01:00,2846,"Precisely, which brings me back to my original question. If your business currently depends on the Canadian market would you not want to serve that market? Is it really that hard to change the price to a Canadian Price? I'm assuming that you believe there are many facilities that just won't accept Canadian money in Canada. Even in these trying times. I suppose that's assuming too much though."
6462536,walleyecheek,2020-07-11 12:08:00,2231,Hey i cant figure it out either ? The old boy that owned the resort i used to go to for 30 year charged in Canadian. The new owners take over charge in American......go figure ? Down here at my small town grocery store they dont charge in Canadian or any other currency ? You know why ? Because the store is in the US !!!!!!
6462546,Camoclad,2020-07-11 12:51:00,628,"I am firmly in the camp of I don't think I would prepay a trip with the uncertainty we have now over the border opening and such even a year out. That said, we had a trip planned for this year and had prepaid a significant amount toward it to keep from having to bring so much cash. When the pandemic hit our dates rolled into next year along with the deposits and additional payments which we have been told none of which are refundable (the deposit I understood, the additional payments toward the trip I disagree with). If we get the trip in next year all will be fine, nothing lost, if we don't get to go each of our group has about $1400 we stand to loose. I am not saying it's right or wrong on the additional payments, just that I will never prepay a trip again. As far as the camps charging in USD or CAD, it makes no difference to me, and have been to places that charge in USD and CAD and never had any issues. Truthfully, I kind of like dealing with camps that charge in CAD, give me an opportunity to learn more about the exchange rates and processes. If the camp accepts a credit card, even better, the exchange is all done by the card company, small service fee applied, done deal. I am a little surprised that all camps in Canada don't advertise/charge in CAD. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"

6462284,Shellback,2020-07-10 14:34:00,8083,"Thinking outside the box. Would it be practical for camp owners to sell prepaid trips for 2021? Figure what you need to survive this year, then offer 2021 trips at a discounted rate if prepaid now for next year? Say you sell half of spots for 2021 now, but still hold on to the other half that you can sell at full price next year. Could it be the difference between surviving or having to go bankrupt?"
6462300,emma17,2020-07-10 15:13:00,436,It's an honorable idea but I don't think I'd take the chance of losing the full pre-paid amount. Imo the help and risk should come from the Canadian government.
6462304,bthomas3333,2020-07-10 15:20:00,465,Hey - For what it is worth I have contacted my three outfitters and offered to pay in full my 2020 trips that have pushed to 2021. One said yes that would be great. Two others said no thanks. I didn't expect a discount or anything. They did offer to hold the 2020 price for 2021 when I prepaid in full.The idea of offering a discount if they could get a 2021 trip prepaided might work but I would be a bit concerned about the outfitters financial viability if they were pushing this approach. Do you think the ones offering this might be so close to bankruptcy that you might get no trip in 2021?I don't know I have tried to help my guys that I know and trust.Brett
6462330,v-bay gord,2020-07-10 16:13:00,3168,Most camps would have had a banner year this year....now that most are moving their reservations to 2021 I think many camps will not have a lot of vacancy to offer a pre-paid package. If you aren't on the books for somewhere this year you may be out of luck next year.....
6462332,Obabikon,2020-07-10 16:27:00,2370,"I have had several guests offer to do that as a way of ""helping"". It's a very kind gesture. I have not taken anyone up on the offer yet, but time will tell. It is simply borrowing from next year to get through this year. It feels great to have guests who are emotionally invested, and willing to be financially invested (if needed) in the well being of our resort. I would suggest to do whatever makes you feel comfortable."
6462374,RichA$1970,2020-07-10 18:23:00,1159,"I would be leery of prepaying anything the way the border is acting so scared, 2021 could be a wash based on the craziness. Also, most camps are rolling over 2020 guest so they are probably half full already for 2021. I would think they would change their marketing for a more balanced client portfolio targeting domestic customers as this is similar of the tariff wars with China. Invest your capital in Chinese factories and then a 25% tariff to level the playing field, 95% American clients that now can’t cross the border."
6462402,v-bay gord,2020-07-10 20:18:00,3168,When your rates are in US dollars you can forget about targeting domestic customers.
6462408,3M TA3,2020-07-10 20:27:00,2846,Is it that difficult to change the rate from US $ to Canadian $. Or are you suggesting that Canadians pay a different price for the same services?
6462452,v-bay gord,2020-07-11 07:26:00,3168,"A better question might be ""Why would I frequent a business that wants to charge me in a foreign currency in my own country?"""
6462456,Obabikon,2020-07-11 07:49:00,2370,"That's just not true at all. It certainly might bother a few people, but most don't care one way or the other. Location is a much bigger factor when determining if you can get Canadian guests. People from Winnipeg are 2 hours from Kenora and fishing Lake of the Woods. However, they're 5 hours from Morson... to also fish Lake of the Woods. That's a pretty hard sell."
