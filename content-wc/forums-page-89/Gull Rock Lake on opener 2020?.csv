I have gone up to Five Lakes Lodge for the last two years with my wife over the 4th of July and we absolutely love it up there! We have things fairly well figured out for that time of year, and are anxious to get back. I wrote up reports each year and posted them here. year 1: https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=684044year 2: https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=696126That said, I convinced a group of buddies to go up to FLL next summer as well. Ian is already pretty well booked up, but we were able to book for the opener week, May 15th - 21st or so. Anyone have any experience fishing Gull Rock that early in the year? I think the earliest I've been in Canada for fishing is the first week of June, so I know weather will be a big question mark. I am excited to try for some big pike, as that seems like a good time for them, but I'm curious how people are fishing walleye that time of year. Assuming they will be really shallow, will it be more of a numbers and eaters type of fishing? Pitching jigs/cranks? Shallow Bays? Thanks for any insight, I'm happy to share some spots/tips from my July timeframe in exchange."

We stayed at 5 lakes lodge and Ian was a great host. he filled my boat with gas from jerry cans , none of the lodges had ordered their gas at that point of time because they had no customers and didn't need the expense of a couple hundred gallons of gas sitting in their tanks. hopefully the fishing will pick up and june is usually a great time to fish gullrock, last year was a crazy year and now i guess the trend will continue."
