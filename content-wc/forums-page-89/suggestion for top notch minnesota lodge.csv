6464500,Guest,2020-07-17 06:14:00,0,"Depends on what you define as top notch resort, are you looking for a decent cabin on the lake or looking for a resort that provides meals and caters to you? If you are looking for a cabin on the lake close to Canada, try the Thunderbird Lodge on Rainy Lake, you cant get any closer to Canada without being in Canada. The cabins work fine for us, we do or own cooking but there is a bar/restaurant there as well."
