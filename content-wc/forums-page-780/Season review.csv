544565,Guest,2004-12-16 07:53:00,0,"My Brother Guides on a large lake in Ontario. I asked him if he would share with us a re cap of his season. He keeps track of all Walleye caught with a counter and charts all fish over 24"". His results are as follows. 97 Days on water total fish caught 11,931 123 per day 31"" 5 30"" 14 29"" 37 28"" 104 27"" 119 26"" 264 25"" 409 24"" 971 Total revenue for year not including tips $48,500 Profit for year $20,079 $207 per day. I know by the time he cleans fish, readys his boat for next day and shuts down for the day he spends about 12 hours a day. Hourly wage of $17.25. He drives an 18 wheeler the rest of the year and his wife teachs school. He sure doesent Guide for the money, its because he loves to fish and enjoys his customers. I have seen years that he had major boat repairs and his profit approached minumum wage. The most interesting thing about having a Brother as a Guiide is hearing him talk about why he fishs the spots he fishs and how he breaks down the seasonal patterns of the Lake. Wind, water depth, water color, water temp and structure are words he lives by. Its a job and a science and for him a way of life. I even pay him when I fish with him, not as much as most but I cover his expenses. I thought this information might be good for those of us who fish with Guides and for those of us who think a Guide is a waste of time."

544569,Guest,2004-12-16 09:02:00,0,"Great numbers, its interesting to see how one can do if they fish all season. Question though, would those numbers be better if he took his clients to his ""good"" holes? Also, as your brother, does he take you to his ""good"" holes, and would he let you bring a GPS? Nobody argues that guides are great, but people just get sick of the attitudes that some of them have....see other thread. Thanks again for the numbers!"

544571,Guest,2004-12-16 09:54:00,0,"Bill W. Actually I think his ""Good"" holes change has the season and the conditions change. It is a large lake and I know that he Guides for one purpose and one purpose only...CATCH FISH, which makes him fish only spots that he thinks will be hot. I believe he fishs where ever he thinks is best for that day. He moves around a lot if a spot is slow and on many trips with him we will go back to a slow spot later in the day in hopes that it has improved and that seems to an effective method. One day last year we went to a spot first thing in the morning and picked up a couple of fish but it was too slow for him. We finished the day on that same spot in the afternoon and picked up 50 to 60 nice fish in a little over an hour. I know he believes the Walleye is very nomadic and that tendency makes moving when it is slow an important tactic. I have never heard him complain about customers coming back to his spots and I dont know if any of his customers GPS his spots. I really think that once he figures out what pattern is best for that time of year it wouldnt make any difference if somebody marks his spots because there are so many spots he can find that will fall into the pattern."

544630,Guest,2004-12-16 10:55:00,0,"brother, thanks for info. your brother is obviously a great fisherman and guide. i like his style. i spoke in favor of gps on the other thread, but only as a means of marking a map in general. i also fish a large lake. lac seul in july. i have over the years found 4-5 honey holes, but they average about 1/2 mile long and several hundred yards wide. i'm not familiar with the concept of being ""spot on spot"" to catch fish. so many variables impact how a ""hole"" will perform at any given moment. and yes, i agree that a dead hole in the morning can be hotter than a firecracker in the afternoon. thanks again."
544672,Guest,2004-12-18 07:31:00,0,"I want to fish that lake!!! At 123 avg. fish a day figuring in 90mins. of travel /lunch time they are catching a walleye every 3 minutes or so(8hr day). 2000 eyes over 24"" in 97 days is great. He had to have a couple days where he STRUGGLED and only boated 50 or so, so there must have been days they avg. a fish every minute or so!! It also must be large lake and your brother is a heck of a fisherman! Also he must only catch eyes and never fishes for or catches any other species,to spend 15 minutes accidentally catching 2 pike would really screw up the average, there just is not time for it. He must do unbelievable on tips!!! Dennis"
544678,Guest,2004-12-18 14:29:00,0,"Thats only 6 fish per person per hour. Thats not unrealistic, at the camp we go to we hit spots where you can catch 40-50 hr., not everyday, but alot of days. When you do that you only need to average 3 per person per hour to catch 125 per day. We don't even take a guide anymore. We went two years fully guided and learned the spots, now we just do unguided and fish the same spots."
544694,Guest,2004-12-20 08:13:00,0,"Called my Brother and asked him what the best and worst day he had last year was. He said that the best day he had with two and him in the boat was 400 Walleye. He said it was in Late June and they stayed out a little extra on that day to get #400. The worst day was 18 Walleyes on a windy, rainy early June day that they only stayed out three hours because he had a Father and his 16 year old Daughter with him and they wanted to come in. He also mentioned that in August and September the numbers go down because most of his fisherman want to fish for bigger fish and they spend a lot of time in deep water fishing ledges and old river and creek channels. He also said that at that time of year he uses 4""+ minnows and they do pick up some nice Pike in the deep water pattern."
544708,Guest,2004-12-20 22:24:00,0,"Brother, What lake does your Brother guide on? How do you get a hold of him to book a trip?"
544710,Guest,2004-12-21 08:16:00,0,"Archie, Thanks for asking. My Brother Guides on Lac Seul. He has been there for nine years and he is always booked up a year in advance. He has a lot of repeat business and he works with a couple of Resorts to book his fill ins. He also does not want to use this site as advertising so he asked me not to use his name."
544715,Guest,2004-12-21 15:15:00,0,"I can tell you from several yearly reviews on Lac Seul (approximately 100 days on the water) that these numbers are very, ery comparable. In fact, without knowing, I would venture a guess your brother guides on Lac Seul! The numbers you gave are almost bang on what I have seen. As well, the tactics you have shared are very applicable to the Lac Seul walleye fishery."
544717,Guest,2004-12-21 15:51:00,0,SOUNDS LIKE SOME OF THE LAKES AROUND HERE BUT NOT AS BIG AND NOT AS MANY BIG FISH
544679,orchard frank,2004-12-18 15:04:00,1900,"I've been making a trip or two a year to Lac Seul for the last 12 yrs. I appreciate your brothers honesty. In camp many talk about all the ""30 inchers"" they released. I have found the same pattern as your numbers suggest, BIG drop off over 27 or so. Careful measurement will turn those 30's into 27's in a hurry. On one of the ""greatest days ever"" my wife and I had, we caught 21 fish over 27"" by 11AM. NONE of them was a true 30, 29 3/4 was the best. But still, what a day!!! Thanks again for an interesting post."
