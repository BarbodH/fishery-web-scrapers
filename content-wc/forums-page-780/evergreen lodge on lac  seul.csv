544723,2 DOGS,2004-12-21 20:12:00,361,Can't say much for the guests.
544725,2 DOGS,2004-12-21 20:45:00,361,"Seriously, it's a neat camp and well-maintained. Great hosts, watch out for the card-playing mother. She'll whip you in euker and show you absolutely no mercy. Get the reservations made like yesterday, because they fill up fast."

544763,2 DOGS,2004-12-24 08:07:00,361,"Gary & Patty will give you a map with places marked where the action is fastest at that particular time. The map also has hazards marked so pay attention to those also. You won't have to go far from camp to see some action. The area around Goose Island is always an excellant place to start. Talk to other guests, people are always willing to help. I suggest to 1st timers that they get a guide for at least a day the beginning of a trip. If for nothing else, just to get familiar with a small part of the lake, what presentations are working, and a few spots to return to the next day. Good Luck and remember to put the big ones back."
