We'd fished the area for 20+ years and everything just fell in place. As an investment I'm sure it's more than doubled in that time. It's in a group of about 15 cottages on the southeast shore, in a great location. My neighbor two places down has his for sale, about $225K cnd. Shoe89 I've never been into Wine Lake, Wabaskang has everthing we need and as you know it's a big lake, I do enjoy the smaller lakes off the timber roads as well, espiecally when its windy."

You may not want to even use a canoe!! I realize all of this is water level dependant, as this year it was MEGA HIGH, (but not the norm.)I dont live there but am very familiar with the whole area."

544566,Guest,2004-12-16 08:05:00,0,Eyesore I like your name just going thru 2 catarack sp. surgies and have been having some trouble with my eyes. This past year early to mid June--to late in my opinion--took my 18ft. with Johnson 75 up the Pipe. It is close to maybe 20 milels up the river and then up into the lake to where those other waters come into the pipe. You are very correct about the rocks and I have 2 props to prove your correctness. I am not much of a sailor and I have a difficult time getting back off of the lake always going up those other parts thinking I am in the river. Have a gps but never learned how to run it. If you have the time I would very much enjoy hearing your tales of the area. [email protected] In 2002 we went up to the end of the road and had a coffee with Gary and his wife. He said that was going to be the last year for them up there. Saw all of the vehicles in his yard where the folks came down the winter roads to get out of there. Plan on going back up this spring. On the first trip we stayed on an island up in the lake and that saved coming back down the river everyday. I have taken 2 older fellas with me up there on the Pipestone that being the only drive in lake I go to--saying drive in it is the same distance as going to Florida as I am in cen. Michigan anyway they told me we never catch any fish we will put the curse on you for catching fish. A good day for them down here in Mi.for eyes was 2 or 3 on a good day if tlhat. You can search on my other posts on here about the Pipestone and see what we did. But you know what it is as you know the area. Hoping to hear from you. len in michigan

544693,Guest,2004-12-20 06:29:00,0,shoe89 You mention Ghost Lake - is that a fly in trip out of Savant? If so we have camped on Ghost and on Raphael the past several years and have really enjoyed the area. No big Eyes but plenty of them. Looking at two trips to the area next summer.
544595,Guest,2004-12-14 09:35:00,0,Thankyou for starting this topic. This is where my interest lies but have been told that I am just plain cheap by others on this board in the past. May be a little frugal but that isn't the reason that I and a few treasured friends like to fish small VERY secluded lakes. We are fishing north of Terrace Bay on smaller lakes where we drive over 100 miles on gravel and then ride quads a few miles to get to river lake systems where we keep a stash of 12 and 14 footers. We have never seen other fishermen or the proof that others have been there from trip to trip. Also fishing a drive to lake north of the village of Pickle Lake it is a 1100 mile one way trip for us here in michigan. This is on the Pipestone River system and a mighty fine section of water. We camp out in tents--if my wife goes I take the Lance camper. We don't use giudes. Over the years we have become friends with some very fine Canadians--our great neighbors to the north. These friendships have put us on some very water. We eat a few fish at camp and very rairly bring a fish home. If my wife doesn't go on a particuar trip I will sometimes bring her a fish as she enjoys them. We leave our camp sites clean and also haul out any junk left by others on the few lakes where others come to fish and explore. We are more explores than fishermen and are always looking at the maps to find other lakes over the next hill and large boulders. If you do this you know that going from one lake to another even if only a mile or so that it can be very difficult work with all of the blowdowns etc. Hope to hear from other explorers. Turning 60 in Jan. working to keep myself in shape to continue these trips. Take younger fellas with me and I provide the new truck boats and motors etc. Thanks for starting this thread. len i michigan

I would like to try Wabaskang sometime but the week I'm at Wine we have plenty of places without going up to Wabaskang. Any advice if it is worth my trip backup to Wabaskang? Shoe89

544496,Guest,2004-12-11 06:46:00,0,"Most of the subjects on this site are about large lakes like LOTW and Lac Suel. What are some of your favorite smaller lakes or portage lakes? Why do you like these lakes and resorts. Some of my favorites are tipover, mudd, and ghost. Good luck finding these on a map. These are some remote lakes that are small with good walleye fishing and you will never see anybody else in them unless they are from the same resort you are staying at. That is why I like them. Also you catch a lot of fish."
544497,Trailerguy,2004-12-11 07:37:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]You're entirly right about the small lakes. Fishing is great with a lot less people, the bad thing is they are more fragile. A meat hog can ruin a small lake for many years."
544504,Guest,2004-12-11 19:19:00,0,"Trailerguy I was just curious as to what part of Iowa you are from since I grew up in north cenral Iowa. The lakes I'm talking about you can't take anything over 18"" everything else is returned. So you return a lot of fish. Shoe89"
544505,Guest,2004-12-11 22:41:00,0,"we fish kukukus.It is not small but the resort has only 6 boats on it.You can launch your own boat but it was not very easy.Fishing never was bad,if we saw more then 3 other boats we were lucky."
544512,Guest,2004-12-13 09:43:00,0,Thats what's nice about living in northern Ontario. You have such a variety. You can fish all those little lakes that are full of specks and go over the hill and fish walleye. Or if you like fish the big water (St. Marys River) and catch what ever species you want as well as some big eyes.
