This location came to our attention during a moose hunt and we'd like to get more information from anyone who has been there. Thanks in advance.

I have found the principals ( Mary & Kelly Culhane ) to be great and have always had good trips. The fishing has not always been spectacular but we have had enough great trips to realize that mother nature is not always co-operative. I have been to Easy Lake during the 2nd week of September but it was very cold with snow and the fishing was slow. In reading the camp log the fishing is good in the spring and early fall. We stayed at the easy Island camp but if I were to go to this lake again I would choose the Easy Point location as it does not have the 39 steps up the hill to the cabin. One of the best trips I had recently with Hawk was the Duffy Lake location and I will always remember catching Walleye off the dock in the early morning and evening. Regards, SJB."

Good camps, boats, motors and, occasionally, excellant fishing. No complaints-we're using them again this year."
