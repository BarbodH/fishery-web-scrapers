Then, if you get pulled over by a police officer, you can watch him throw it to the ground and smash it. :-) There is a thread on the general discussion board, though about them...you might want to check there...

I had a uniden radar detector for two years, it seemed to work great on the wide open highways in Manitoba where I live, I only paid $160 Can. for it. I lost it when I was driving in NW ontario, it didn't go off until the cop came around the corner and it was too late, he caught me going 20 clicks over the limit and asked for my radar detector when he stopped me. Did he see it or did he have a detector detector? I have no idea, all I know is it cost me $110 for speeding, $170 for using a radar detector and he took it away from me. Total loss that day was $340. Sure, it may have saved me more than $340 in tickets, but you end up driving faster, you get more paranoid, and they will nail you eventually. Good luck with your purchase."

I was stopped for 20 KPH over (I honestly didn't see the speed reduced zone) and it cost me $350 ($220 American at the time). I guess they hit non-residents a little harder, or maybe I just caught this guy on a bad day? Two days later (I had already mailed the check) I received a love letter from the OPP stating that a warrant would be issued for my arrest if payment was not recieved within 7 (?) days. I sure was wishing I sent that check next day air express at that point! I had a radar detector on my visor once while crossing the border (into Canada). The gentleman in the booth asked me to put it under the seat and leave it there. His request was enough to keep it there for the rest of the trip! Tim"

They will tear your car apart looking for it if it hits on your car. THey will take the detector from you and issue tickets. In the years we have gone up to Lac Seul and Minaki, two times we had animals run in front of our cars and cause abrupt stops.. It is not worth it to speed up there."
