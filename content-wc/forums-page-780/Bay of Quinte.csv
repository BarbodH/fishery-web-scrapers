544719,haybaylarry,2004-12-21 16:29:00,55,"Quinte is a great walleye area. The weather can change dramatically day to day. There are many launch ramps that are protected. Yes you will need a srvival suit, there is no better way to go! Many walleye in the area summer or fall. Ice fishing can be very good as well. I am a resident and love the area....Haybay larry"

544727,Atlanta Dave,2004-12-22 05:27:00,323,What lures do you use in Quinte and what are the best colors. I am in the midst of stocking my tackle box. Thanks Atlanta Dave
544728,bigfish1965,2004-12-22 09:02:00,3210,"The principal forage this time of year is shad. Guys do well with an assortment of lures, but the killer seems to the Manns Dr Death....oddly enough. Rebel Fastracs, Husky Jerks and jigs also do very well."
544731,Atlanta Dave,2004-12-22 11:14:00,323,Bigfish What colors work best. Also I couldnt find a Dr. Death made by manns does cabelas carry them? We are thinking of going ;up ;the end of nov next fall. Atlanta Dave
544735,bigfish1965,2004-12-22 17:20:00,3210,Sorry...Dr Death is a colour..

544450,Atlanta Dave,2004-12-08 18:25:00,323,"Looking for information on a trip to Quinte the first half of Nov 2005. We would like to bring our boats. Probably staying for a week. Would we need a guide for a day or so, or is it possible to do on ones own. One of our boat owners is an extremely accomplished walleyed fisherman from Ohio Please any info on where to stay, fish and what to use. Thanks in advance for any help. Atlanta Dave"

544454,Superdad,2004-12-08 21:21:00,64,That's the place to start. Read the posts for the last couple months and check out the advertisers to the website. Bay of Quinte - World's BEST Walleye Trophy Fishing - imho David Delcloo aka Superdad
544456,bigfish1965,2004-12-08 22:47:00,3210,"What SuperDad said! Also try http://www.ontariofishing.net/cgi/me...l?board=board1 since quite a few guides hang there,too. We went last November and while the wind beat us up bad, teh fishing was still great."
544465,Atlanta Dave,2004-12-09 07:54:00,323,duh Thanks for the site looks to be a wealth of info. Atlanta Dave

544473,Atlanta Dave,2004-12-09 17:00:00,323,Which part of the bay is the most productive? I keep hearing the picton area. Is this not a more protected area from the wind? Thanks Atlanta Dave
544493,bigfish1965,2004-12-10 19:48:00,3210,Picton in November..you will get wet...survival suits are an absolute necessity. It's worth it!!!
