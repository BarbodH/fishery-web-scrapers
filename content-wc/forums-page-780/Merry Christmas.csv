544741,Guest,2004-12-23 07:13:00,0,"I will have to ditto that. I think we tend to take for granted the experience we look forward to in our stays in Canada. The Canadian people have been gracious enough to allow us to fish their waters and enjoy their beautiful country and are not recognised nearly enough. In my stays in Ontario I have always found the people as gracious, helpful hosts and my wife and I have also developed several great friendships with our neighbors in the North. Merry Christmas to you all. Steve"

544747,Guest,2004-12-23 10:57:00,0,Republicans can still say Merry Christmas. It is the Democrats that say Happy Holiday.

544779,Guest,2004-12-25 08:29:00,0,"MOST of us in Ontario say Merry Christmas, except in that scumhole Toronto. They call the Christmas tree a ""Holiday"" tree, politicians buying votes is what I call it!!! Anyways, to our American friends a big MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! Especially to those families with members fighting in the Middle East. Peace Merry Christmas & Happy New Year Jim"
