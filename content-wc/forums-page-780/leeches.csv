I havent used any (except ice fishing, minnows) for years and always end up catching my fair share of walleyes. My Dad and I fish out of the same boat, he uses live bait, I dont and generally out fish him."

544766,Guest,2004-12-24 11:57:00,0,Just wanting to know what evryone thinks about the new law for this year. No leeches permitted crossing the border.
544767,Guest,2004-12-24 12:10:00,0,It has been the law in Ontario for about 4 years already. Have you been taking leeches across all this time?
544768,Guest,2004-12-24 12:21:00,0,"They passed the law 4 years ago, but it comes into effect this year Jan.1 2005. They let them come across last year but they wont this year. I live on the canadian side of Lake of the Woods, so no I havent brought any across, just wondering how you guys feel about it."
544772,Guest,2004-12-24 12:59:00,0,"They for years have allowed only worms packed in bedding. No leeches or minnows, and they specifically ask. If you get the leeches early in the season, they are big. In August Canada bait shops I have been to seem to have pretty small ones. For about $24 to $29 per pound, it is worth buying them over the border rather that the hassel of the transport. Lot cheaper than buying minnows in Canada."
544782,retire55,2004-12-26 08:54:00,1029,"Individual recreational fishermen have not been able to ""legally"" transport leeches into Ontario for a while now. The new law effective Jan 05 will prohibit baiters (those with bait licences) from legally importing leeches into Ontario. Past records indicate that approximately 70% of all leeches sold in Ontario have been imported from the US. Prohibiting that activity before ensuring that Ontario's supply of leeches is assured from within will only encourage ridiculously higher leech prices and illegal transportation of leeches across borders. Consequently, in response to your question of what do I think of the new law - it sucks and it respresents more evidence of government beaurocrats out of touch with reality. No such law exists or is anticipated for the neighbouring province of Quebec. I'm unaware of Manitoba's posture on this topic."

The ban on individual fishermen importing was necessary to protect from viral infestations. This latest move was probably the result of lobbying...or some very subtle softwood lumber retaliation... :D"

I wonder if there is a place in Canada that I can order them from and have them shipped to our lodge? Any input would be greatly appreciated."
