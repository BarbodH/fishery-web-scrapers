544667,Guest,2004-12-17 19:17:00,0,There are general rules and Lake Specific Rules. You also have to ensure that the Lake you are fishing has no rules specific to that lake. On Lac Des Mille Lacs where I fish a lot you can have no Walleye under 13in. Be real careful in generalizing rules. Read your regs and if in doubt phone OMNR. They are very helpful.
544668,Guest,2004-12-17 22:16:00,0,"fishinmagician...get your facts straight please before shouting that the ""sky is falling'. The regs for the majority of North Western Ontario remain unchanged. It is North Eastern Ontario that has had the recent change. In any case the change is for the better....the point being the ability to CATCH fish..not KEEP fish is the ultimate goal. Or should we follow the Wisconsin model and just keep stocking fish to keep up with the freezer filling crowd...I think you see my point. For the group of 10 (in the other post) who decided to not come to the Wpg River because of new regs...well there are many other nearby places with unchanged regs. If you can't see the point in making changes to a fishery under stress then you should fish elsewhere. I don't think your going to get much sympathy."
544670,jerry bark,2004-12-18 06:13:00,822,"goord, i think you are off base, fishnmagicn is happy that the regs have been eased up, in the area we fish the regs had been a slot between 16 and 22 with one fish over. the only difference to me will be the ability to keep one 16 or 17 inch fish for dinner instead of cleaning 2 or 3 smaller. its probably great for some, no big deal to me since i only keep what i plan to eat that night, and don't take much walleye home, i will take home whitefish but they are not pressured like the walleye. cheers jerry"

544684,Guest,2004-12-19 10:12:00,0,"MNR, is trying to streamline the reg book. We have somewhere around 400,000 lakes. The book would be 3' thick if you had a different slot for each lake. I personally don't agree. Some lakes, do need specific slot sizes. Thickness of the reg book should not override the needs of the fishery. We cover a huge geographic area, with many types of lakes. Each large lake is unique. Depending on pressure, different regs may be needed."

544650,Guest,2004-12-17 13:22:00,0,"So there is no slot fish anymore? >JUST FOR CLAIFICATION PURPOSES ONLY, THE NEW REGULATIONS FOR >NORTHER ONTARIO WALLEYE SIZE AND LIMITS ARE AS FOLLOWS. > >4 FISH UNDER 18"" OR >3 FISH UNDER 18"" AND ONE OVER > >THIS IS THE NEW LAW EFFECTIVE NEXT YEAR!!!!!!!"

544655,phishfearme,2004-12-17 14:35:00,1242,there must be a dozen different regions in northern ontario each with (historically) different regs. are you saying that the regs are now consistent among regions? how about for a conservation license? - phish
544657,jerry bark,2004-12-17 14:56:00,822,"the owner of the lodge i fish told me that this regulation was ""in the works, but likely"" has it been made official? cheers jerry"
544658,Guest,2004-12-17 15:20:00,0,IT IS OFFICIAL!!!!
544659,Guest,2004-12-17 16:02:00,0,"The following was released from NOTO in November: November 10, 2004 Walleye Size Limits No Longer in most of Northeastern Ontario Today the Ministry of Natural Resources posted an information notice on the environmental registry (http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/envregistry/024118ex.htm) outlining changes to walleye sport fishing regulations in northeastern Ontario. The regulation will change the walleye size and catch limit regulations in northeastern Ontario to be consistent with those in northwestern Ontario, commencing January 1, 2005, as follows: Walleye (and sauger) Sport Fishing Licence: Limit of four in one day Conservation Licence: Limit of two in one day Of which only one may be greater than 46 cm (18.1 inches) in length. These changes will occur in Divisions 14, 18, 19, 25, 26, and 28. The limits in Division 27 (Lake Nipissing) were not changed in 2002 and will remain unchanged. NOTO is supportive of the size limit approach that is currently in place as it protects the quality of the resource while maintaining opportunity in the fishery. NOTO feels that this recent decision to eliminate the size limit approach defies all science and will have a profound effect on the state of the fishery resource here in northeastern Ontario. We have indicated our significant displeasure with this decision to selected MNR staff and we will keep you posted on any further developments."
544660,Guest,2004-12-17 17:16:00,0,"fishnmagician, the area you keep referring to on this board as northern ontario is really northeastern ontario on tha dnr maps. most of the posters here fish northwestern ontario and manitoba. just because the regs have changed in northeastern ontario, it does not necessarily follow that they will change in nwo. there are 34 or 35 districts in ontario alone and some of the larger lakes are their own district. many have slightly different regs. what has happened in northeastern ontario is probably a result of pressure on the dnr by some interest group and is definately a bad idea overall imo. regs need to be drastically tightened over there to allow that overfished area to recover. again, just my opinion."
544661,Trailerguy,2004-12-17 17:43:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]One fish over 46cm (18.1"")in a limit of 4 fish on a sport license, has been in effect for a number of years now in Div. 22a. It certinaly has improved fishing on the lakes I fish. I can't imagine anyone staying home because they're going hungry."
544662,Dano,2004-12-17 17:45:00,83,"As always, you should read and fully understand the Regs. for the area or zone that you will be fishing in. Remember, ignorance is NO excuse!"
