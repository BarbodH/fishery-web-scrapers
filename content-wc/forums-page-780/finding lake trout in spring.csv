544567,Guest,2004-12-16 08:13:00,0,"Each lake will be different, and the water temp will play a major roll in the depth of lake trout. The number one tactic I would start with is long line trolling. With cold water temps, they are likely to be high in the water column, which is good for most anglers, but will be spread out. Thats why long line trolling is a good tactic. You will need to cover some water, and don't limit yourself to shallow water only. I have seen them at the surface in 100 ft of water. They tend to do a lot of roaming in the spring. There are some specific areas to look for lake trout, and get a starting point... look for waters flowing into the lake... streams, rivers, etc. That is always a good attraction area. Points that stretch out into the water. Saddle areas, or narrows. Use minnow type lures that have a tighter wiggle to them. Original Rapala's or Husky jerks are good choices. For colors I have had the best luck in metallic colors, silvers, blues, bronze, etc. Or the standard spoon in silver. If you find an area holding fish then switch to casting. If you are there early in the season, and the ice is still on the lake, but there is open water along the shorelines, put a boat in the water and work the ice edges. Fish will sometimes hang along those ice edges. Good luck, lakers can be a real blast early in the season. All the best."

544570,Guest,2004-12-16 09:03:00,0,agate It seems rather rare when someone explains how to do a certain thing fishing etc. that the reader agrees with everything written. But agate hit everything I know about trout fishing 100% PLUS. I fish trout and pike lakes in Ontario every year. In the spring and late fall meaning late Sept. it is like shooting fish in a barrel. My wife goes up with me in July August and we catch them the same way except the numbers are not near the same as they are deeper. My bait of choice is the Rattle-trap and Thunderstick and using agates colors. Very fine write agate--it was a joy to read. len in michigan

544631,Guest,2004-12-16 11:57:00,0,"Thanks Len, appreciate the kind words. The 2005 season will be our second in which we are open for business. It has been a great learning experience. Until we opened our lodge, I had never fished for lake trout. They are certainly a fun fish to catch, and really shake rattle and roll their way to the boat. I won't even get into how tasty they are on the dinner table. If you fish them in summer, obviously go deep, they will hang in the 55-60 ft depths... usually. A downrigger is the best way to fish them but not everyone is in to that. If the wind is down, slowly drift with a heavy jig. Tip with a minnow, and bulk it with a larger plastic body. Every once in awhile jig it aggresively up, then let it settle down. If it stops before you think it should... set the hook. All the best."
544635,Guest,2004-12-16 15:26:00,0,Like Agate we long line them in early June with a spinner and minnow and we fish in 10-15 feet of water. The place I fish for them is a large sand bar and we pick them up on a regular basis
544640,jerry bark,2004-12-17 04:57:00,822,"Thanks guys, this gives me some good starting information. i can allready think of a few likely spots: there's a point just up from one of the inlets, a nice narrow section right at the west end fo the deepest section of the lake and another deep hole that i know which adjoins lots of structure in the 10-15 fot deep range. those spots seem like they might work out, i have the lures metioned in my tackle bag allready so I sould be good. cheers jerry"

The sand absorbs and retains heat from the suns rays, and in very early spring this translates into slightly warmer water temperatures than the rest of the lake. This attracts baitfish and hungry lakers like flies."
