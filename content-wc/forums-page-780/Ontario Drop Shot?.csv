544778,TomPGrouse,2004-12-25 06:46:00,124,Is it legal to fish a jig and another hook on a drop shot rig in Ontario? Thanks
544780,Guest,2004-12-25 12:25:00,0,"As I understand it, one line, with up to three hooks. So to answer your question yes it is. This is as of 2004. I have not heard if there are any changes in this regulation for 2005."
544820,MN_Moose,2004-12-29 20:01:00,965,"Careful! I think there is a rule requiring the hooks to be no farther than X. Not positive what exact dim. is. But, I think the rule outlaws the technique described above. Many would call that a ""Dubuque rig""."

544821,Guest,2004-12-29 20:57:00,0,"Here is text from the Ontario fishing regs for 2005. Hooks and Lines  An angler may use only one line, unless otherwise stated in the Regulations. Two lines may be used when angling from a boat in parts of the Great Lakes (see Exceptions to the General Regulations) and for ice fishing in many areas (see Ice Fishing, page 5). A fishing line must not have more than four hooks attached. Where an artificial lure is used, each double or treble hook attached to it is considered to be one hook. In all other situations, a double hook counts as two hooks; and a treble hook counts as three hooks.
