544675,Guest,2004-12-18 08:55:00,0,"They said the guy made a few remarks like ""how is your little war going"". I said he was full of it because he is a BS'er, but I asked his dad (who is about the most respectable guy I know and a WW II Vet) and he was mad that the guy was dissing the war. THe dad also said he was saying things like you guys come up here and think you do not follow the rules. If he did not care about the origin of the men, he should not have brought it up. I would believe what the dad said. I personally have been stopped on two canadian lakes. In Minaki under the bridge a few times in a week, and on Lac Seul. I had beer in my boat every time and they said nothing. I also rarely keep walleye unless they are heading right to the fryer and had the conservation limit license and had an empty ""Deadwell"" each time, and never had a problem. I think they liked that we had the ""Good"" License."
544677,Guest,2004-12-18 13:44:00,0,any and all border water's in manitoba/ontario share the same limit read the reg's the guy is a liar badmouthing manitoba
544680,JimH,2004-12-18 20:52:00,320,"I've been going to Canada for almost 20 years and have never had any of the experiences of what has been posted here. The customs people have always been polite, courteous, and nice. They ask questions, I give them truthful answers, and I'm on my way. When stopped by the OPP on the water, they ask to see our licenses, we show them. They check our boat out, we let them look. They thank us, tell us to have a nice day...and we're back to fishing. I've actually had one tell us about a great walleye spot that we were close to. I think the most important thing to remember is that you are a GUEST in their country. It's not the 51st state, although we sometimes think it is. Treat them with courtesy, follow the rules and regs like you should here in the States, and you'll have a great time up there. I've never had a bad experience, on the contrary, I've found the people up in NW Ontario to be very happy to see us up there. Locals and resort owners. Me and my family look forward to going up there each summer. Now if the US and Canada could only add about 20 more lanes to cross the border at Ft. Francis/Int'l Falls..lol"
544686,Guest,2004-12-19 10:49:00,0,"When I cross the border into Minnesota to fish the Brainerd area, I make very sure I know the proper limits and type of equipment allowed. Some of you Americans seem to think because you are on vacation in Canada that our laws don't apply to you .Over 70% of Canadians don't like your war in Iraq ,so understand our differences."
544689,rebelrn2001,2004-12-19 20:06:00,1563,I agree with the border crossing at FF/IF's. What a screwed up mess (at times). Not really designed for high volume that's for sure.
544705,Guest,2004-12-20 20:24:00,0,"This past August on Minaki, there was an Officer sitting under the bridge stopping people. He stopped us twice in the week and was very funny. Lots of current makes it hard and at times comical to sit next to another boat. We were using the phone at one of the Paradise Cove resorts (the one with a little grocery store) and saw the Officer was in a very bad mood and followed a group of guys from the dock to their cabin and searched it. They were over on walleyes, and I think they had a small musky. A guy from the same cabin but not in the same boat told me that the Officer told the guys that were caught that they cannot fish any more. I do not know if he was able to revoke their license on the spot, or if they were afraid to go out again."
544712,jigman 2003,2004-12-21 14:14:00,981,"This thread kind of confuses me. If the guys you are going with cannot read the regulations for your area and follow the rules, then I wouldn't be going with them. I learned a long time ago that there were a lot of people who I didn't want to hunt or fish with, it sounds like these guys would fit my definition of someone like that. The rules aren't that difficult to understand. If they need to know what the real penalties are, then let them find out the hard way. I have no sympathy for someone who is ticketed for being over on their possession limit, or who keeps too large or small a fish. Greedy Americans, that is how Canadians view those of us who have to come to THEIR country and rob THEIR resources. We've ruined the fishing in our country, now we have to go somewhere else to have a quality fishing experience. How about if we learn from our mistake here and hope that the Canadians are gracious enough to keep putting up with us?"
544750,Guest,2004-12-23 16:10:00,0,Must be American Beer they sunk. Beer cans and bottles when full float. Alcohol is lighter than water. You could never sink a Canadian Beer.
544632,rebelrunner,2004-12-16 13:57:00,20,"I'll be taking some ""first timers"" fishing on Canadian waters in 2005. I'd like to relay to them the pain that occur in their pocketbook should they boast a need to, for example, crack open a beer on the water or possess even one additional fish over the limit. That ought to keep them in line. Please share your ""on good authority"" knowledge of the violation and the resulting fine (in US dollars) I'd like to assemble a list, bring it along on the drive up, and enlighten the group to some cold hard cash reality. Thanks."
544633,Guest,2004-12-16 14:30:00,0,12 years ago when I was a meathunter our group of six was stopped along HWY 11 with 38 walleye when we were allowed 36 as a group. MNR conviscated eight fish and one guy volunteered to take the fall and got about a $100 fine. End of story. I do not believe that I have traveled a Canadian highway with a walleye in tow since.
544634,Guest,2004-12-16 15:14:00,0,"We had a few beers on the water and had a couple Walleyes over our limit when the ""MAN"" pulled up and checked us out. Each Beer in the boat could have cost us $200 CDN and each Walleye a $100 CDN. So we decided to try to make a get away. We quickly found out that a 25 HP wont out run a 150 HP. I have been looking for cakes with hacksaws in them every since that day. Oh yeah they took our vehicles and fishing equipment and we were banned from Canada for life. All these things are bad ....and can happen if you choose to ignore the law."
544636,Guest,2004-12-16 16:17:00,0,I check out this site every week. Some pretty stiff fines. Read awhile back some wardens thought they seen people drinking in the boat and when they approached the fishermen there was no beer. The wardens marked the spot with a GPS and returned with some divers. Found beer cans at the spot and fined them. Also paid for the expense of the divers. http://www.ocoa.ca/Pages_MNRnews/main.htm
544643,Guest,2004-12-17 07:48:00,0,"I had a friend on a fly-in where most of the lake system is in Ontario, but part of it carries over into Manitoba. It was their first day and they were keeping small ones for the fryer. They had done all of their fishing in Ontario side, and moved about fifty yards (meters in Canada I guess) past a sign that showed the Manitoba border. A float plane came down and stopped them. In Ontario the limit was 4, and in Manitoba it was 2. They had 6 walleye and two men in the boat so they were over in Manitoba and had to pay $75 per fish over. They argued that they had caught everything in Ontario, but the Manitoba DNR did not care. They even went back to the cabin to search it. I did not believe him and felt that it was made up and he was really over the bigger limit. His dad was with him and verified the story. They both swear they will never go back to Canada. They advised that the Officer's first question was where are you guys from. Chicago was the wrong answer."
544652,Guest,2004-12-17 14:15:00,0,"They advised that the Officer's first question was where are you guys from. Chicago was the wrong answer. Are you saying that because they were from the USA, they received ""different"" treatment from the CO's ? If they had been using a gps they would have known they were in Manitoba, but then again they didn't have a guide........."
544654,Guest,2004-12-17 14:29:00,0,"I know of about 100 stories about violators, however one sticks out in particular. Some americans where fishing a northern lake and tried to bring two coolers of fish fillets across the boarder. The CO's asked them if they had any fish and they said no. So they got their fish smelling dogs and they found the coolers of fish. They lost everything including truck boat and I believe they did some jail time. It doesn't pay. If you have some beer in the boat that is a criminal offence and CO's usually have Ontario provincal police with them. That is a bad situation because the fines are stiffer and you will have to go to court."
544656,timeout,2004-12-17 14:38:00,28,". In Ontario the limit was 4, and in Manitoba >it was 2. They had 6 walleye and two men in the boat so they >were over in Manitoba and had to pay $75 per fish over. They >argued that they had caught everything in Ontario, but the >Manitoba DNR did not care. They even went back to the cabin >to search it. Something not quite right about this story. In manitoba the limit varies between 4 and 6 dependent on location and regular vs conservation license. Also the search of a residence in another jurisdiction without a warrant seems unlikely. In their own jurisdiction maybe but what is described is like a state trooper crossing a state line to exercise his rights. Highly unlikely. To respond to the original question however, in manitoba using barbed hooks $50, fishing without a license $230, over limit base of $100 plus up dependent on numbers, failure to carry your license $130. the source of this is manitoba licensing guide page 10. It also states that the fines may be higher based on severity and/or frequency of the infractions. Open liquor is another kettle of fish. Believe it starts around $130 for open liquor in a motor vehicle and seeing as a power boat is a motor vehicle you also open yourself up to impaired driving charges which get a lot more expensive. While I do not totally discount the diver story from another post, if they catch you throwing the liquor overboard, you will be ticketed for littering, and a heads up for some, canned beer is neutrally bouyant, chucking it overboard doesn't work. Follow the rules and no problems Think you can do whatever you want, be prepared to pay the price. Being in a remote location may also give a false sense of security. However I have been checked 25 miles from the nearest road, they are out there. I do not think that your state or location of origin is a factor in either enforcement or sentencing. The courts up here are pretty screwed up though with little sense. Get caught with a little weed, you MAY end up with a conditional or absolute discharge. Open liquor you get a ticket. With the new proposed law you will get a ticket just like liquor just more expensive. Inconsistencies in sentencing exists, so if it is a ticketable offense, just pay the ticket as you never know what will happen if you roll the dice. Best advice, follow the rules, have a good time and yall come back now you hear LOL"
544671,Guest,2004-12-18 07:19:00,0,"This is their story (I was not there)and the guys made several comments that were anti-American during the whole exchange. Stuff like ""You guys come up here and think you can do whatever you want"". That type of thing. So yes, they think that they were discriminated because they were American. The guy also made some anti-war comments. These guys could not spell GPS let alone use one, plus there were no thin-skinned guides in the area that would be put off by a little technology because it was a fly-in."

A previous poster put up a very good link to the OCOA (Ontario Conservation Officers Association) website (http://ocoa.ca/Pages_MNRnews/index.htm ) That is an excelletn source of info for the fate of violators."
