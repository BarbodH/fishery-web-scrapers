544770,Dano,2004-12-24 12:45:00,83,"Sorry baitbucket, trout-perch are not game fish. Trout are, perch are, but not trout-perch. Percopsis omiscomaycus, trout-perch, as the name suggests, share characteristics of both the salmons and perches. Size up to 5 inches."
544771,Guest,2004-12-24 12:53:00,0,"okay, my mistake, thought you were reffering to trout and perch"
544729,Guest,2004-12-22 09:34:00,0,"I'm hoping someone can help me. I'm going to Canada in May for pike fishing. I'm trying to find whole sardines for dead bait fishing. I'm located in Green Bay, WI. I called a local seafood dealer in town and they had no idea where to get them. We fished a lodge last year and did quite well with chubs, but someone else was using sardines and seemed to be catching many more. Anyone have any suggestions? Don't have a problem ordering them from out of state. Thanks Adam"

544738,Guest,2004-12-23 05:23:00,0,"Interesting idea. I have used chubs, shiners, etc., but never sardines. Has anyone had success with this method?"
544739,Catman59,2004-12-23 05:32:00,345,"I was thinking of taking a bag of frozen Smelt up next year , anyone have any thoughts on using them ?"
544740,Trailerguy,2004-12-23 07:05:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Because smelt eggs are very hardy and can establish an invasive population, Ontario and most of Canada bans thier use as bait."
544746,Catman59,2004-12-23 10:31:00,345,"Even the frozen ones ? I knew you couldnt have live ones , but didnt know it to be true for frozen ones. Apparently thats why the camp uses frozen Herring. Thanks"
544760,Mr Ranger,2004-12-24 06:31:00,272,"Is it legal to use frozen sardines or smelt? Also, how do you rig and fish these? Merry Christmas"

544762,Dano,2004-12-24 07:36:00,83,"From the Ontario MNR site... In most areas of Ontario, only the following fish may be used as bait-fish: Mudminnow family; Sucker family; Stickleback family; Lake herring of the whitefish family; Darter subfamily; Trout-perch family; Sculpin family; Minnow family except carp and goldfish; Crayfish."
544764,Guest,2004-12-24 11:26:00,0,"As far as your list, it looks good except the trout-perch family, in Ontario they are cosidered game fish and there fore against the law to use gamefish for bait"
