4890865,walleyeduran,2016-06-01 19:22:00,286,Let me know a little more about your trip. e-mail me @ [email protected]. Been interested in fishing St. Joe for a few years.
4914833,bernmaster44,2016-06-09 20:56:00,256,"Hi, I'm looking for a lake to drive my boat to. I live in Minnesota (Twin Cities) and would love to know from one of you guys if Pickle lake is worth the drive (about 13 hours). It would be just my wife and I and we both love to fish. There are many many lakes and I want to make this trip special. Details about the fishing, accommodations, etc. would be nice. We would probably love to leave in about a week or two but, can wait. Thanking you in advance."
4916857,stjoeguy,2016-06-10 17:33:00,979,"I've never been to Pickle Lake, so I can't help you with that, but I've made the trip to Lake St. Joseph 15 times, so I think it's worth the long drive and that the fishing is special. Check with Dick Mansfield at 807-737-1829 to see if he has any openings at the Winoga Lodge outpost cabin that we go to. Other boat to spots on the lake are Camp Lake St. Joseph (fairly rustic) http://www.lakestjoseph.com and The Old Post (american plan available) http://www.oldpost.com. Slate Falls has fly-in cabins on the lake: http://slatefallsoutposts.com"
4845129,stjoeguy,2016-05-17 07:18:00,979,"A guy just canceled for our trip to Lake St. Joseph on 6/24 - 7/2. If you're interested in a trip to one of the best walleye and northern lakes in Canada, let me know and I'll fill in the details. The lake is outstanding and the cabin is great. I think the fishing is better on St. Joe than on Lac Seul, but I'm biased and have fished St. Joe for 15 years and only fished Lac Seul 2 years. The lakes are similar, however, with great walleye fishing and a lot of structure (rocks). Fishing St. Joe is like fishing Lac Seul but with no other boats around. It's a boat-in trip, with fly-in quality fishing, to the only cabin within a 25 mile radius. The total cost, including tax, gas, groceries, etc for 8 nights, 7 days of fishing is about $1,300. The group is ""mature"". Let's just say we all remember black & white TV, telephone party lines and Sputnik. Let me know if you're interested in joining us. In the mean time I'll be recontacting my list of ""maybe"" and ""one of these days"" guys."
4846001,Lovetofish,2016-05-17 10:47:00,458,"You can put me on your ""someday"" list Stjoeguy."
4847033,stjoeguy,2016-05-17 15:59:00,979,You've got a spot on the list. I hope you can come with us someday. Thanks for the recent email. Hope all goes well this summer so you and your family can make it to Canada!
4848945,ftfarms,2016-05-18 09:05:00,444,I would love too but don't think I would get away with taking another trip to canada this year. I would have too agree what you said about st Jose and lac suel. Both are awsome walleye fishieres.
4852857,Guest,2016-05-19 11:48:00,0,A golden opportunity to fish a great lake with a great crew. stay at one of the better cabins in NW Ontario. Please join us.
4854257,Carnhzkr,2016-05-19 19:08:00,964,I would love to go to St Jo and if I weren't already committed I'd tag along. I wouldn't mind fishing with a group of 90 year olds
4854849,Stringbean,2016-05-20 05:07:00,279,I'm probably in that same age range. You forgot to mention the old 3 holer out back in your memories section.
4855745,Guest,2016-05-20 11:11:00,0,"No need, there is a one holer behind the cabin, in case there is an issue with the modern plumbing inside."
4866393,stjoeguy,2016-05-24 08:02:00,979,"As Maxwell Smart would say: ""Missed it by that much"" That's Don Adams, not Steve Carrell --- another age reference.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBlhrTpi69E Over the years I've met some good guys through Walleye Central and fished with several of them. A fellow Lake St. Joe devotee and W/C member contacted me and it looked like we were going to get together on this trip, but his work schedule wouldn't let him go this year. We've shared fishing spots via email and I was looking forward to fishing with him. So the spot remains open. No Lake St. Joe experience required. We'll show you the fishing spots and tracks to avoid ""most"" of the rocks. You might even get to look into ""The Abyss"""
4866681,Fishoil,2016-05-24 09:23:00,1277,It sounds like it would be a great time. If I wasn't fishing just south of there 2 weeks earlier and then going on vacation with my wife the following week I'd probably take you up on it.
