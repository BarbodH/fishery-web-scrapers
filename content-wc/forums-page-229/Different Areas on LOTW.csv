4832418,lassh,2016-05-13 11:45:00,553,Crow Rock is in a great area but they don't give much of a discount if you bring your own boat.
4834122,Lmbkiller,2016-05-13 21:17:00,639,"Hate to say it but if u and your family can't stand 5-8mi boat rides then I don't get why u fish rainy lk and then u want to change to low. Both are enormous and a higher level of uncertainty. U guys sound like u need a lk around 8000acres, staind water, and high densities of smaller fish."
4834330,briggs12,2016-05-14 04:51:00,5,"That's why we aren't fishing Rainy anymore. We fish L Michigan just about every weekend and they get sick of trolling. I just need a place where I can ride a mile or 2 and reef fish for walleyes. Sounds like LOTW offers that. Plus, I think coming back to camp for lunch would help their attitudes. If you make an 8 mile run, thats not an option. Its a different situation when its adults, little ones can be tough and I want them to have fun not just tolerate it. Im all ears if you have a different lake suggestion. Obabikon was full during my requested time, but witch bay has an opening. Well be there this summer. Thanks everyone for your help."
4834810,Obabikon,2016-05-14 07:44:00,2370,"Comparing LOTW's to Rainy is a bit of a stretch. The only place on LOTW's that you need to go for long boat rides is Sioux Narrows. Maybe parts of Nestor (just to get away from traffic). For the most part though, the lake is very fishable... no matter where you are."
4918113,MistyMoon,2016-06-11 15:01:00,2,"I'm with obabikon on this one. Particularly if you go to one of the island resorts/outposts. If you want to go 8 miles you can, but you will be boating past an awful lot of fish! If you are staying on one of the islands, you can see your first fishing hole from the dock. When I fish up there, I will go farther than 2 miles, but it's ONLY because I am looking for a change of pace not because I can't find fish closer!"
4918217,3 Z's,2016-06-11 16:23:00,133,"I have only been to Witch Bay Camp, with my family, so I can not comment on the other locations. When we first went my kids were older than yours, early teens, but have been in camp when family's with younger children are there. We continue to go back to Witch Bay each year, very happy with it. One thing to consider about the island camps, with young kids one never knows when a run into town might be necessary. I've never been to Kenora but it is only 30-45 minutes from Witch Bay I'm told. If you had a foul weather day or the kids needed a break from the fishing that might be a trip you could make."
4830074,briggs12,2016-05-12 16:23:00,5,"I'm searching for some info on LOTW. I've spent a lot of time and obtained a lot of great info on LOTW on this site. Ultimately, I'm on the hunt for a new spot to take my young family. We have been going to the US side of Rainy for the past 4 years and love the lake. The big downfall is the long boat ride we take every day to get to the east side of the lake. I'd like to find a place where I only need to drive a few miles to get to great fishing(not 5-8 like on Rainy). Since LOTW isn't much further of a car ride I thought it would be a good new spot for us to try. I have my own boat, and was wondering if there are any differences in terms of fishing and proximity to good walleye fishing spots. On my short list are Young's wilderness camp, obabikon, and witchbay. My kids are too young to hold bottom bouncer rods, but they do like to jig so reef fishing would be ideal if possible. Morson area is a closer car ride than witch bay, but if I can make up the difference in boat riding every day it would be worth it for me. Thanks all!!"
4830218,mt hook,2016-05-12 17:29:00,65,"It's all about the time of year you are going. You did not say.Spring time, out of morson. Duck Bay Camp or Young's. Summer time, out to Obabikon and Obabikon Lake for northerns. That will keep the kids on fish."
4830234,emma17,2016-05-12 17:32:00,436,I've been to Witch Bay and Obabikon and love them both- they are different though. Both are American Plan and serve excellent food and both go out of their way to provide excellent service. Fishing has been excellent at both. Obabikon is a boat-to island. If you want hiking or playing in water it will be tough. Witch Bay is more family oriented with lots of space. God willing I'll visit both again this year. Best of luck.
4830290,briggs12,2016-05-12 17:53:00,5,"Thanks for the quick replies. Mid to late summer is my plan. I probably waited to long to plan this, but just got the wife's approval today. She'll kill me if we have to take long boat rides everyday.."
4830306,Obabikon,2016-05-12 18:08:00,2370,"You will not be disappointed in any of the three choices. Obabikon has miles bay 1/2 mile away.... which is one of the best walleye bays in all of lake of the woods. Obabikon lake for pike is a 5 minute boat ride straight north of the camp. Almost all of our fishing is done within 10-15 minutes from the resort. On a side note... Steve and Perry both run great camps. They both have very nice resorts, and are short boat rides from great fishing."
4830498,muskyman73,2016-05-12 18:58:00,402,"I gotta say I am partial to Obabikon, walleye fishing is awesome right there, I don't even start the big engine, I love the remote location that it is and the good fishing all around it. We will be there in 51 days !!!! wahooooooo !!!!!!"
4831282,Thompmd,2016-05-13 06:09:00,320,"Let me start by saying I've been to LOTW for 10yrs and decided on a different camp this year and we are going there the first time in early July so no first hand experience yet. We chose Crow Rock. They are on an island 16 miles from Kenora. The 16 miles only ""slightly"" concerns me only because I've never stayed on an island and you lose the flexibility of going to town for a change of pace. I will make the 16mile trip once each way. What I love about them and among the reasons I chose them is their reputation as a lodge(been in the same family for 40yrs) but they have quite a variety from full American plan or housekeeping on a couple private islands a mile from the main lodge which is where we are staying. They offer the flexibility of occasionally eating a meal at the lodge if you choose. They have exclusive access to 8 private remote lakes which is very attractive to me. They are pretty remote and from the people I've spoken to the area has excellent close fishing although I too am taking my boat. The other attractive thing about LOTW is the islands always offer some protection from the winds but also give a feeling of even more remoteness. Let us know what you choose. Good Luck"
4831986,deadhead1,2016-05-13 09:00:00,193,"Thompmd--I don't believe Crow Rock has ""exclusive"" rights to those remote lakes. I believe anyone can fish them but Crow Rock has exclusive outfitters rights to them. Also you would have to know how to get into them and carry your own boat or canoe in or fish from shore. One nice thing about LOW is that there is usually good walleye within a few miles of almost any part of the lake. It might take a day or so to find them but they are there. We mostly jig fish and have very good results. Crow Rock is a very good outfitter as are all the ones mentioned in this thread and they are good about helping you locate fish if you are self guiding."
4832098,briggs12,2016-05-13 09:38:00,5,Sounds like I can't lose....My kids (6 & 8 yrs old) are starting to lose interest in fishing. They've been on too many trolling trips. My youngest had his first canadian fishing trip when he was 6 weeks old.....Appreciate all your help. Looks like there are many options for close to camp fishing at LOTW.
4832234,Ver88,2016-05-13 10:38:00,114,"I know it is not on your list, but I would avoid the Sioux narrows area. The best fishing around Sioux narrows for walleye often means a long boat ride. I think it is some of the best fishing on the lake if you don't mind the commute. There are plenty of walleyes to catch closer to town, but not the numbers that you can get after a 20 mile boat ride."
