Who do you guys use to go in with, Lunenbergers? Also has anyone taken over TLO old camp up in the other body of water than Lunenbergers camp?"

4855713,Travis Schallock,2016-05-20 10:49:00,37,"Very low. I've never seen it this low in the spring, right now would be low for mid summer. I was up at my camp a couple days ago and its a good 4-5ft low from a normal spring up there."
4882209,1K1MOA,2016-05-30 16:24:00,90,Reviving thread...heading up Friday...how is the water level on Nakina area lakes? We have a couple of favorites that have may get crossed off if water level too low... Thanks
4883273,Mike Borger,2016-05-31 03:28:00,1554,A friend just returned from Ara Lake and he said it was crazy low water.
4883417,gmattbruin,2016-05-31 05:20:00,174,"Hey Mike, its been awhile, hope you have a great season. My group is head into Abamasagi again...i know, its our go to lake, love it. Ive heard 3-5' lower for water. With tht said its gonna be interesting to see if we will even be able to get up into those upper NE bodies of water. As you know those ""cuts"" out of the arm are darn low anyways"
4883609,1K1MOA,2016-05-31 06:30:00,90,"Thanks Mike and all for the insight, we trailer all over the area to various lakes and this does help me plan accordingly."

All the lakes we drove by in Longlac, Geraldton, and Nakina looked to be crazy low. All of the lakes we flew over on our flight in and out of Washi were all very low."
4914785,Berner9,2016-06-09 20:45:00,8,Been in longlac all week. Water levels and all launches seemed just fine.
4921233,Guest,2016-06-12 19:45:00,0,Just updating to see if anyone else had been in the Nakina area and had seen very low waterlevels leaving for the area in two weeks
4921265,oleJoe,2016-06-12 20:00:00,114,You should be ok now. Was there 2 weeks ago and water was low but it rained for 5 days and we saw the water rise close to a foot. One of the guys stayed another week and got back Sat.. He said it rained most of the week and water continued to rise to near normal levels. It was cold also. Have a good trip.
