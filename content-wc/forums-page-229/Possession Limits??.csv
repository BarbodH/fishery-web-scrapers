4912329,Lmbkiller,2016-06-08 21:28:00,639,"Fishermen 1 is correct. Bigwillies, re read regs. I just read them, possession limit is 6 walleyes or sauger or combination of"
4912577,Obabikon,2016-06-09 05:17:00,2370,"Don't take bad advice. Stay at 4. Unless you're fishing zone 13, 14 or 17... (I believe those were the only ones over 4). If you have a fish frozen, that is in your possession. Doesn't matter where you caught it, when your actively fishing a zone that has a limit of 4... keeping more is illegal. Whatever C/O officer explained that to fisherman1 was incorrect or misspoke. You would need to prove you caught 6 walleyes in zone 14. That's the only way to legally have 6 walleyes."
4912649,Lmbkiller,2016-06-09 05:58:00,639,"It's black and white to me, read the 2016 regs pg 10. Ontario provincial possession walleye limit is 6. Sport lisence daily bag is 4 in zone 4. Sport license daily bag in zone 5 is 4. Prove in the regulations that the ontario possession limit isn't 6 and I'll believe u. We have basically the same thing goin on in wi now in the ceded territory walleye lks. Daily bag limit is 3 on any ceded territory walleye lk. However, wi state daily bag limit is 5. So I can go to lk X and harvest 3 walleye, then jump to lk Y and harvest 2 more for my wi state daily bag limit of 5 walleye. I would leave my fish from lk X in vehicle while out on lk Y. Our co's are well aware of this and have no problem with it at all"
4912817,bigwillies,2016-06-09 07:01:00,515,Just did read the regs and you are correct. My bad
4912945,Guest,2016-06-09 07:59:00,0,"I did send an e-mail to MNR on this issue, but haven't heard back yet. I appreciate your input. In regards to proving where we caught them I feel like the only option would be honest, and mark any bagged fish with the zone where they were caught. It's really not about the extra 2 walleyes. I'm just making sure I understand the regulations properly. Thanks"
4914729,Obabikon,2016-06-09 20:20:00,2370,"You are correct, it is black and white. Possession limit is 4. If the walleye are still in your car, they are still in your possession. So, you have 4... no matter where you caught them, you can't have more than 4 if the possession limit where you are fishing is only 4."
4915017,Lmbkiller,2016-06-09 23:40:00,639,"It does matter where u caught them (different zones), and your ok. If u don't exceed daily bag limit in the zone your in, hop to another zone, your ok. That's how the regulation booklet reads, black and white"
4915289,Bill Krejca,2016-06-10 06:49:00,6107,"In the end, the bottom line is how the officer inspecting you interprets the regulations, and... maybe, to a much lesser extent, how you explain when/how you got the fish. If you feel the 2 extra fish are worth the potential long drawn-out efforts over a period of time that might arise upon the confrontation, that is the choice that can be made. It would be certainly of interest to read/hear of some first hand on-the-water/at the landing experiences with officials on this subject. I look forward to seeing further sharing on th subject. Bill"
4915321,BornToFish,2016-06-10 06:56:00,1224,"There is some wisdom to Bill's comments in the previous post. It could come down to the type of day that the warden is having. If so, how much effort, time and money are two additional walleyes worth?"
4911089,Guest,2016-06-08 12:50:00,0,"Where we fish in Canada we are very close to the border of two separate fishing zones. We fish lakes/rivers in both zones throughout the week. Each zone has a 4 walleyes/person limit. Under the provincial limits I see that we can possess 6 walleyes. Is it accurate to say that we can catch our 4 walleyes/person limit in one zone and then go to the other zone and continue to fish and keep 2 walleyes? If I'm understanding this correctly we could bring back a total of 6 walleyes (4 from one zone and 2 from the other, or whatever combination as long as it isn't over 6). Just want to ensure I'm understanding this correctly! Thanks"
4911233,Bill Krejca,2016-06-08 13:42:00,6107,"Good question, but my WAG is that this kind of situation would be extremely difficult to explain to an officer checking you. I wouldn't bet on consistently winning this case, wouldn't be worth it experimenting to find out for me. Bill"
4911353,bigwalleye1,2016-06-08 14:24:00,2632,"I'd suggest a call to the MNR, or an email, with a response from either in writing with the name of the officer, and carry that for verification purposes."
4911385,Bowtech84,2016-06-08 15:09:00,572,Guilty until proven innocent? It would be the officers job to prove that he did something illegal and from what he described it sounds like it's perfectly legal.
4911417,Juls,2016-06-08 15:22:00,13414,It would be whatever the possession limit is at the launch site you use.
4911697,Obabikon,2016-06-08 16:58:00,2370,"You can only keep 4 walleyes. Since it is illegal to possess more than 4 walleyes in EITHER of those zones, and the MNR can't prove (and don't care) where they were caught. If at any time you are fishing in one of those two zones with more than 4 walleyes, you are breaking the law. I'm on Lake of the Woods, and it is illegal for a fisherman to catch 6 walleyes in MN and cross the border to fish for muskies with those walleyes still in a cooler."
4911817,retire55,2016-06-08 17:46:00,1029,"Even though the provincial walleye possession limit is 6, the daily catch limit is only 4."
4911905,bigwillies,2016-06-08 18:24:00,515,What province? Possession limit in Ontario is 4.
4911993,Bowtech84,2016-06-08 19:04:00,572,If the op fished in two different zones I don't see why he/she could not do what he is asking legally. The catch limit for each zone is 4. The possession limit is 6. As long as he doesn't possess more than 4 fish in each zone or a total of more than 6 for the day it would be perfectly legal according to what he described. The catch limit is 6 were I fish in Manitoba.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
4912033,fisherman 1,2016-06-08 19:17:00,39,Yes you are correct. I was informed of this last year. There are people I know that live near the area 4 and area 5 boarder in NWO. They told me that they can do exactly what you said. I met a conservation officer one day and questioned him on it and why Ontario has a provincial limit of 6 Walleye. He said that they don't like to advertise this but you can possess 6 Walleye as long as you can prove they were caught in two different zones. He explained that in Southern Ontario on some of the great lakes there is still a possession limit of 6. Because of this the provincial limit must be set at 6. Therefore it is legal to keep 4 walleyes from one are and two from another on a Sport fishing license. I suppose the key thing would be how to prove where your fish were caught.
