Water temps were higher than normal, running between 57.3-64. We thought fish may have started to go deeper, but that was not to be had. They were in shallow water, as shallow as 1 1/2'. We tossed jig and minnow to shore, jigging it back. We had a great week, not as good as some years, but above average. Our biggest was 26 1/2"", but we did not catch as many large fish as in years past. We have 5 in our group and caught 702 walleye for the week. We did not catch as many northern, smallies, and muskies as normal years. We did well on crappies also, everyone that went for them seemed to do well. We tried all depths, looking for more large fish, but only found a few here and there. The mosquitos were getting bad as we left, and the mayfly hatch was starting also. We have never had bugs that bad this early. Hope this helps some guys going up. Tight lines."

We have been going to Ear Falls to fish LS the last few years but decided to try a smaller lake. Any new updates on the bite? Any other tips or suggestions? Look forward to Canada fishing every year!"
4915985,1jigfish2,2016-06-10 11:20:00,110,"I had friends return last weekend. They stated that the fish went just a little deeper, still real shallow. I would expect them to be in the shallows, try real shallow points and tops of drop offs. We had warmer weather for opening week, than they have had up there since. Good luck and tight lines."
4918097,Walleye_Wrangler,2016-06-11 14:42:00,138,Six of us are heading up on the 18th. Save a few for us .
4918225,revitup,2016-06-11 16:24:00,140,I'm also curious how fishing is this week. I'm usually up there this week but this year not until September. However family members are up there and I'm wondering if there is any evidence of mayfly activity yet. Any news about mayfly in the area?
