4910753,Ver88,2016-06-08 10:42:00,114,"I agree with redline, If your looking for only walleye, west of yellow girl is usually the best area to fish. There are plenty of walleyes in yellow girl and in long bay as well, it jut isn't quite as good as sunset channel and to the north. Whitefish bay also has some excellent walleye fishing, but it is harder to fish. I look for dirty water in whitefish bay and can usually catch some walleyes, but not the numbers I get to the north."
4910761,Redline,2016-06-08 10:48:00,73,I've only been down in Whitefish bay twice and it was for Muskie in Knickerbocker and an attempt at Lake Trout by Sisters Islands. I don't know that area well and it seems even more rocky than other parts of the lake.

4915721,LOW1,2016-06-10 08:50:00,2828,I agree with the recommendations for the Sunset Channel and Deadbroke Channel areas. Here is a digital map for you to play with until you actually get there.http://lakeofthewoodsmn.com/map.html
