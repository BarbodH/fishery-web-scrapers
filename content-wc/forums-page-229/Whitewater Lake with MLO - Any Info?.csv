4914689,Eric.hallagan,2016-06-09 19:37:00,32,Looks like they are lifted- A week out brother! Any fishing report info? havent heard of any news.
4914697,pikeman14,2016-06-09 19:44:00,144,I haven't heard much about a fishing report. The water levels were a bit low a couple weeks ago. I'm almost packed and already checked out of work mentally. See you up there!! Mike
4915193,jveri,2016-06-10 06:19:00,70,Low water levels have always made the fishing a bit better for our group. We are heading up there June 30 with 18 guys. Last year when we were up there the water was up probably 6' or more. Good luck!
4915241,pikeman14,2016-06-10 06:33:00,144,I'll post any information when we return.
3228481,Pikeslayer8,2014-10-07 20:49:00,1460,"Huh, I don't know what you're talkin about? I just had this craving to go up to Whitewater for some popcorn....... But hey, so you're saying we get a bonus report on Apisabigo Lake. Nice And congrats on your feature on float fishing for steelhead in this months issue of Ontario Out Of Doors. Way to go Bud!"
3228729,Mike Borger,2014-10-08 03:55:00,1554,Thanks Bill!
3228929,jveri,2014-10-08 06:53:00,70,Wow!! Beauty fish Mike!!
3343777,Pikeslayer8,2014-12-03 15:11:00,1460,So I get a holiday's Seasons Greetings email from Mattice Lake Outfitters today and look who is featured. http://us3.campaign-archive1.com/?u=...a&e=97e78ca700
3344337,Mike Borger,2014-12-03 19:22:00,1554,Hopefully my ugly mug doesn't scare people away.
3344793,RickOnt,2014-12-04 07:30:00,217,Now! That is a great Season's Greeting e-mail The more I read about Mattice Lake Air. The more I want to experience one of their outpost camps
3345426,Pikeslayer8,2014-12-04 12:43:00,1460,"I know, right! I stopped by their airbase in Armstrong when I was there a few years ago. Great setup they got there in Armstrong. Yup, if I were looking for a new outfitter......."
3763849,pikeman14,2015-04-13 20:41:00,144,Our group is booked for June 2016 at whitewater. This thread has been a great source for information. Thanks for sharing. I hope that whitewater isn't too much water to figure out in a weeks stay. It's going to be a long wait.
3763953,Mike Borger,2015-04-13 21:05:00,1554,Drop me a line I can likely help with locations.
4871697,pikeman14,2016-05-25 19:27:00,144,Does anyone know of any concerns with the wildfires up near Armstrong station/whitewater lake area? As of today I see there is a fire ban in ontario.
3161561,Mike Borger,2014-09-08 17:38:00,1554,That's fantastic! If it's even halfways accurate that helped a LOT at least as far as the walleye fishing goes.
3163393,pitbull,2014-09-09 10:33:00,45,"Was there in Aug. 96, caught some nice pike, we had to really hunt for walleye, caught nice ones when we got into them. Visiting the Cabin was a great look at for that how it was built."
3165401,pitbull,2014-09-10 07:14:00,45,"Hi Mike, Was there in Aug. 96', Nice cabins, had to really hunt for walleye, got some nice Pike, remember last day lost a monster in McKinley Bay, never got to see it as it stayed down, fought 20-25min. pole and line broke. When head shook you just new it was huge. Ken"
3165417,jveri,2014-09-10 07:18:00,70,"Mckinley bay produces for our group every year. I caught my pb pike there 4 years ago a 40"" and then two casts later into the same weed bed got a 23"" pickerel lol. When we were there this summer the river flowing into mckinley produced quite a few pickerel each night for us. One thing we noticed this year is that the walleye were very current oriented and that the usual open lake spots/islands didnt produce near as well for us."
3165761,Mike Borger,2014-09-10 08:40:00,1554,"Thanks guys! I remember paddling through Mckinley Bay enroute to Mckinley lake, will be nice to finally fish it after all these years."
3167673,chris.brock,2014-09-11 01:40:00,112,"I would suggest, if the fishing is a little tough, get some tips from the guys in the other boat"
3167777,Mike Borger,2014-09-11 04:37:00,1554,Ahh... the talking bush has chimed in.Should be a fun trip bud.
3228241,Pikeslayer8,2014-10-07 19:06:00,1460,
3228321,Whopper,2014-10-07 19:27:00,340,I've been waiting for this also. Read on another site the Whitewater report is forthcoming and it's supposed to be a dandy.
3228353,Mike Borger,2014-10-07 19:36:00,1554,Stop pressuring me LOL! I got back from Whitewater then two days later left for Wawa. Been pretty busy the last little while. I should have a full report up within a week. Needless to say Whitewater was amazing. Top shelf accommodations and lots of fish including some true giants.
3156185,Mike Borger,2014-09-06 06:51:00,1554,"I'm headed up to Whitewater next week with Mattice Lake Outfitters. Does anyone have any info on the lake that might help with my planning?I paddled through Whitewater many years ago, but have never fished it properly from a boat.As usual we'll primarily be targetting large pike with a bit of walleye fishing on the side. Thanks guys!"
3156913,Crede,2014-09-06 12:29:00,134,"I have never been there, but if you go to wilderness north's homepage and click on ""feature stories"" there is an update from September 4 which talks about recent pike activity and spots on Whitewater. Already looking forward to your report."
3156985,Mike Borger,2014-09-06 13:59:00,1554,"Thanks, had a look it sounds promising!Will be fun trying to figure things out in mid Sept, I expect the larger pike should be pretty aggressive."
3158041,Redear,2014-09-07 06:33:00,40,Mike pm Ogoki I think that's his home waters over the years. Fred
3159977,adempsey,2014-09-08 07:49:00,963,I have a bathy map. Let me know if you want me to post it up.Have a good trip. I love autumn fishing.
3160409,Mike Borger,2014-09-08 10:26:00,1554,"You bet Adam, thanks!!!!!"
3160697,Pikeslayer8,2014-09-08 11:46:00,1460,Are ya planning to see the Beckwith cabins on Best Island? Ogoki Lodge would be fun to see as well.http://albinger.me/tag/whitewater-lake/
3160857,jveri,2014-09-08 12:36:00,70,The beckwith cabins are in rough shape after this years winter. Unfortunate to see it fall apart every time I have been to whitewater. As you can imagine getting funding and manpower to maintain this landmark has been difficult from what the locals told us.
3160985,Mike Borger,2014-09-08 13:04:00,1554,Will check out both! I have dozens of photos in an album from my previous visit to Beckwith's cabins when I paddled through the lake 19 years ago. Will be interesting to see how much its changed.
