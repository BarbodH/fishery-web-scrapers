This question might be for those that do fly-ins as often times the boats are smaller and not as updated as many of the drive in camps."
4922537,BornToFish,2016-06-13 09:05:00,1224,"I will offer a few suggestions: Install my own electronics. I have my unit configured so that I can remove the boat's unit and install my own unit within a few minutes. Snub the anchor off on a cleat so that it can't roll around in rough water and break rod tips. Put my own anchor in a storage compartment, so that I have a second anchor should I need one. Put my drift anchor in a storage compartment, so that I can slow my drift in rough water. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4922857,labsrus,2016-06-13 10:17:00,557,"I made a mounting board that I bungee cord to the middle seat for my electronics, it has the Ram ball mounted on it already Spot on board to hold the needle nose pliers and to hold down the portable 12 volt battery. I use the suction cup mount to hold the transducer in the water. This set up has gone on a few fly ins and has worked pretty good"
4923673,dstar49,2016-06-13 14:08:00,33,I bought a Sully transducer mount that clamps to the transom and has up and down adjustment. Found that the suction cups sometimes don't stay secure and if not careful have seen transducer get cut off by prop. plus easier to adjust to get good readings at high speeds.
4923833,BornToFish,2016-06-13 14:54:00,1224,"Greetings, I agree with the previous poster. I wasn't too thrilled with the suction cup for the transducer that I had been using for years. Thus, I bought a transducer bracket from Cabela's, that I believe is from Sully's. I substituted stainless steel hardware in place of the zinc coated hardware that came with the bracket. Assembly was fairly straightforward in spite of the instructions. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4923865,BornToFish,2016-06-13 15:01:00,1224,"Greetings again, Consider taking along a milk crate and a dry bag. I use the milk crate to hold fishing tackle in Plano plastic boxes, marker buoys, flashlights, bug-spray and the like - things that can get wet. I mount a strip of swimmer's noodle along one edge of the crate to hold fishing lures that are not in use. My milk crate holds a lot of gear and keeps it organized in rough water. I use a dry bag to hold extra clothes, maps, cameras and the like - things that are better kept dry. The storage compartments in most boats are notoriously prone to getting things wet in rough water or rain. Best wishes....."
