2605058,Tennesee_Jed,2014-03-28 07:23:00,1,"I have a felony arrest for drugs whilst in college that was adjudicated to a stay of imposition in the early 70's. After crossing the border for many years & even having a Remote Border Crossing Permit, I was stopped @ the border, going into Ca & questioned about it 4 yrs ago. They let me pass thru but asked me to retrieve the court records and probation report if I planned on returning to Canada, aye.As I live within 2 hrs of the MN/ONT border and I was planning on returning, I sent off for the paperwork requested and rode my MC to the border to see if all was fine one afternoon. After approx 1 hr. of questions of the exact dates of those events, of which I could not remember, (35 yrs ago? really?), I was told that it's all good. Crossing back into MN, when asked my reason for visiting Ca, I gave a brief recap of my decades old bust and had just crossed to see if I had satisfied the canucks as far as my FBI arrest record was concerned. After looking @ my passport I was told have a safe ride home.I now have crossed a dozen times since then and have had 0 issues. That's my story and I'm sticking to it."

I don't ever remember any rude behavior on either side. The US Customs is (sometimes) full of themselves. But it may be their training - pretend to be tough. Canadians are always very polite - though professional.My only gripe was a return to the USA about 6-8 years ago... They put me, my friend, my truck and boat into their X-Ray quonset. If they want to search me, that's their business. But I don't think I should be subjected to X-Rays without permission. I don't care what they do to the truck/boat. Just leave me out of those X-Rays. I get enought of them as it is."
