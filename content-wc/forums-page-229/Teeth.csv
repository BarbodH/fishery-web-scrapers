I've never been cut of by a walleye or a lake trout but pickerel (states variety) and pike or a rare musky, have claimed many lures. I've found safety in using a very fine wire leader in waters that hold the toothy pike species, (ever catch a redfin, looks just like a baby musky). I don't know what pound test fluro would be safe to use. What do you guys use?"
4916913,BreezyPoint,2016-06-10 17:59:00,1581,"I use wire leaders whenever in northern or musky country. Pike teeth are very different than walleye and other fish as they are serrated on the sides. The line just needs to slide along a tooth to get cut. Walleye teeth are smooth on the sides. The only way for a walleye to cut your line would be to get it directly between the points of two teeth, virtually impossible as the teeth do not meet point to point. The serration can be seen under magnification. This picture, although fuzzy, shows the rough edge of the teeth:http://urbanflyfisher.com/wp-content...9/p9070019.jpgFrank"
4918153,Obabikon,2016-06-11 15:41:00,2370,Pike's teeth are sharp on the sides while walleye's are cone shaped... its like comparing a double bladed knife to a nail. They're both pointy... but only one cuts.
4918185,zeebee,2016-06-11 15:56:00,1144,"Nothing shy of 80 lbs fluoro will prevent a biteoff and that doesnt work if targeting walleye.When I troll for fall Musky I use 130 lbs but the lures are 10-14"" so action is not impeded by the thickness of the line.As others have mentioned, thin wire leaders are your best defense against biteoff when targeting eyes.Its not just the sharpness of the teeth...they both have sharp teeth...its the pressure exerted by the fish....a 10 lbs object hanging from a string overa knife will cut quicker than a 1 lbs object. To then state the obvious, pike on average are heavier than walleye."
