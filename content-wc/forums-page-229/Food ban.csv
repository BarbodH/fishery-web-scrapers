4918785,btyreprich,2016-06-12 04:17:00,1067,I know this subject has been covered extensively what with the poultry ban from last year. Am wondering if anyone has been able to cross the border with eggs. I read the Canadian government web site which states that eggs from Indiana are prohibited. I'm in the process now of reviewing my grocery list and need to know whether or not the border guards are allowing eggs over the border. Thanks

Eggs are permitted as long as not from Indiana. The only suggestion that was given to me was that the commercial packaging your eggs are in must list the state in which the eggs are produced.

Will go ahead and make sure any eggs I do buy for the trip are not from Indiana and are clearly marked where they are from. Case in point - local grocery store chain here had a dozen eggs for $0.50!! In looking at the egg container, no where can I see what state are these eggs Fromm. Would bet that these eggs could be rejected for entry into Canada."
