4918769,Andyeye,2016-06-12 04:04:00,179,Does anyone know if I can cash my GST tax refund at Border Bob's? The only place I can cash it here is the main bank. The branch near my house won't and the main bank is a big pain in the neck due to road construction and limited parking. The banks in Fort Francis are not open on Saturdays. If not Border Bob's would the Wal- Mart in Dryden do it? Thanks
