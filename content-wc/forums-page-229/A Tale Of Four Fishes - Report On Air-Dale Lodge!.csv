My son and traveled to Hawk Junction, Ontario to visit Air-Dale Lodge (formerly Totomenai Lodge) on Whitefish and Manitowik lake's. We had an ambitious plan with only 4 days of fishing with different species of fish on tap. Brook trout, lake trout, splake and walleye.The brook trout and splake were in nearby back lakes, the lakers and walleye we fished on the main lake.It really was a great success. I was somewhat surprised at the quality of the fishing especially being a drive-to lodge in NE Ontario. If you're at all curious you can read the full story here, as always lots of photos and video!http://www.canadafishingguide.net/a-...ir-dale-lodge/Cheers, Mike"

Brendan is already a fanatic, he's definitely caught the bug!I'm leaving for Gangler's in Manitoba this morning and the kid is having fits cause he can't go. I can't bring him on every trip, but I still feel terrible right now. He does get on plenty of trips though.Any dad can relate - this is what it's all about!"

4895857,Wawajake,2016-06-03 11:07:00,413,"Aw brings back memories , fishing a bit down from the sanctuary where the Shikumkwa River enters Whitefish Lake. (from your movie). I used to take my 9.9 merc up those rapids under the logging bridge when water was high......a thrill at best a prop hit at worst. Also looks like you found where another stream enters the lake ...did you snag my anchor I lost there back in 2007 . (next to the one car sized boulder just exposed in your movie!) Nice to hear Totonomei is still thriving and now under new management . Us locals camp owners used to call ""two too many"" ...smile"
