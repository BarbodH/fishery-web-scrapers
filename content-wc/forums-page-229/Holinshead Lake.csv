4916673,Bobwanni,2016-06-10 16:05:00,14,We are going back to Holinshead in July this year. We normally go a little later in year but thought we'd try July this time. Has anyone been up yet this year or can tell me their experience in July. Usually use live or dead minnows furnished but have saved some Jumbo Leeches for the trip (couple pounds) thinking of trying some crawlers this year also. Love to hear some feed back.
