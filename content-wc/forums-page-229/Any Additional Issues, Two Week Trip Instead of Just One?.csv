4346857,itsme,2015-11-28 19:42:00,31,"Strange things happen... My wife and I decided we wanted two weeks... We fly in from Red lake. So we were up the morning the ""camp"" was to fly out...Went to a couple of our good fishing holes caught all sizes of Walleye best being 26"". Anyhow the wind seemed to be picking up; we had our walleye for lunch and so we headed back to camp. It continued to blow harder and we were in some rough water. We were about 1/4 mile out and surprise all the people who were to fly out were still there. Shara Metzner (owner) had cooked up lots of eggs etc to feed the 30 or so folks. Low overhead clouds stopped the planes from arriving. We got the biggest laugh since most were quite late getting back to Red Lake. We did go out fishing after lunch and had a good catch that whole day for that matter the whole two weeks . So it payed off big time for us to do the two weeks."
4347249,port1042,2015-11-29 08:18:00,509,"I do two separate weeks. I think the planning and anticipation of the trip is part of the fun. I could save some money by going once for 2 weeks, but I'd lose the chance to fish both the spring and fall bite. They are two very different experiences even though we fish the same lake from the same lodge. One other concern. We go Saturday to Saturday. Usually by Thursday we've had enough of one another. We get through it and go back again happily a few months later. But if I had to live with Bob for two weeks one of us might not survive!"
4353153,MrSimon,2015-12-02 15:07:00,922,"Man I'd love a two week (or more) trip ... but three young kids, a wife, and a job means it will be a while. When the kids are out of the house I plan to do a three or four week trip to a place with massive amounts of water and bush lakes to explore. That's my idea of heaven! In terms of preparing for a longer trip, I think more food, drink, and tackle/bait is all you need ... especially if you'll be at a drive-to lodge."

4918369,Sportdog,2016-06-11 18:10:00,6735,Two weeks is the way to go for sure!

4919353,phishfearme,2016-06-12 09:42:00,1242,"two weeks at a smaller lake can result in boredom - make sure there's portage lakes or go to a larger lake - or, two different lakes one week each is a great idea - but if it's a flyin that could run up some bucks. we've compromised on 9-10 day trips - a nice balance and most flyin outfitters now permit it. the only issue we had with longer trips (to fly in ""rent-a-lake"" housekeeping) is that the fridge is REALLY crowded the first few days - plan accordingly. phish"
4343369,adempsey,2015-11-26 17:15:00,963,"If it were me, I'd consider trying out two different fishing camps. Two weeks on the same lake would be great, but less fun than on two different lakes.The only other issue I can think of is the fishing license. I don't recall how it works for non-residents."
4343585,Pooch,2015-11-26 20:45:00,4619,"Buy a year fishing license. Gives one an excuse to make multiple trips to maximize the value of the license. Makes sense to me. ""Well since I have a full year to use it, I might as well make more than one trip, otherwise it's wasted..."" I think that is perfectly logical and efficient use of one's time and expenditure. When we buy a fishing license it (also) gives us license to legitimize about anything if we as fishermen can convince ourselves into making lots of trips a year. It's in the really, really fine print on the license. :-)Pooch"
4344329,LOW1,2015-11-27 10:28:00,2828,"At the risk of being declared a heathen, if I was going for two weeks I would want a Plan B which involves something other than fishing for a few days."
4344481,Pooch,2015-11-27 12:24:00,4619,"Plan ""B"" is a nap or two or three. :-)Pooch"

4346193,3M TA3,2015-11-28 13:13:00,2846,This is why the 3 year makes more sense.

4346257,Golden Eagle,2015-11-28 14:15:00,2642,"A two week trip is 3 times more rewarding than a 1 week trip. I've done a bunch of them, but never gave it much thought. Just did it. Usually an outfitter will provide a nice price break on the second week if there's air travel included."
4346321,Downrigger,2015-11-28 15:03:00,60,"We started with one week. Went by too fast. Then two weeks. Then retired. Travel of 1200 miles one way took too many days even from a two week trip. Found a location offering a nice 2 bedroom house keeping cabin for 2 people for $1400 US per MONTH!! This includes docking with electricity. When comparing price with a 2 week cabin stay with docking/electricity, it is equal or less. Also for those who make multiple trips, only have cost for trip up and back once. Plenty of water to explore with multi specie available. Enough time to accommodate those raining/windy days and close enough (35 miles) to other entertainment venues, if desired. Not promoting. Just found what works well for me and wife. Relaxing, not rushed, taking one day at a time. PM if interested in info."
4346353,LOW1,2015-11-28 15:14:00,2828,Don't worry. As far as I am concerned g _ _ f is just like ice fishing but with all the fun removed.
4341881,Sportdog,2015-11-25 18:22:00,6735,My fishing partner and I have decided to make it a two week Canadian fishing trip instead of our normal one week. I don't think that would present any added logistical issues but since I've never done it I thought I would ask those who have done both. We are taking our own boat to a drive to camp and just renting the cabin. Other than more food and some more clothes am I missing something? Thanks Guys!
4341905,ftfarms,2015-11-25 18:35:00,444,When we go more than one week we just take more food and worms. Maybe more booze. None of us are big drinkers but a couple of drinks before bed. Never wear half the clothes so for me that's the same. More bottled water and pop. Two weeks is awesome. Good luck.
4341921,Mike Borger,2015-11-25 18:37:00,1554,"How can twice as much fishing pose any kind of problem? Lucky you, have fun!"
4341985,WalleyeMatt,2015-11-25 19:30:00,93,You will need to get two returning home gifts for the wife. Just so you can figure this into the budget. Also have twice as much fun. Matt
4342001,That Minnesota guy,2015-11-25 19:36:00,8293,"Two weeks doubles the chance of bad weather. Also it means more evenings and down time. Be sure you have things to do by yourself. Books, magazines ect. Long days in the boat, at some point you will need some ""me"" time. As far as a gift ............maybe your wife will give you a gift for going a extra week!! She probably likes her time as much as you like yours."
4342041,GBS,2015-11-25 19:56:00,2271,"Plan in some ""walking around"" time. Two weeks can give you a very serious case of ""boat butt""!"
4342137,Sportdog,2015-11-25 20:56:00,6735,"The ""boat butt"" and bad weather time are great tips. The twice the fun is the reason for the 2X trip. The gift for the wife? Don't need that. She liked time away from me so much she divorced me! Lol!!! (Don't blame her ) But....... my lady friend will require something I'm sure. Her father was a professional hockey player from Alberta so she likes Canada but hates fishing sooooooo. Yeah, I'm on the hook for a good gift. Taking ideas for that now too!"
4342201,Pooch,2015-11-26 03:13:00,4619,"Our Savant group has been making two week trips for years. Won't be doing it this year as guys have other commitments. Other wise it is great.Our logic for two weeks was this:We have a short two day drive each way from Illinois, so that's over three solid days on the road for a seven day trip. Makes more sense to just stay an extra week since we are already there. Efficiency!! At least that's how we justify it to ourselves.Whether you stay one week or two you will obviously hit some bad weather and some good. With a two week trip the odds are doubled for both so that is a wash. In the two weeks in camp we always have numerous banner days.If in camp for two weeks you are more inclined to set back and enjoy the time. With a one week I feel rushed to get out on the water and at the end of the week are beat up tired. Not so with a two week stay.We just enjoy the more laid back trip two weeks offers. There is no pressure to ""maximize"" time on the water. If we get cold we come in. If the weather starts to not be cooperative we come in. If it goes hot and flat we come in. If we feel like a nap we come in. No pressure.I'm sure the rest of our group will miss the two weeks together, but sometimes circumstance dictates. This year circumstance won.....Go for it. Slow down a notch and enjoy the trip more. It pains me to not make the two week trip this year. Gonna be a long summer without it.Pooch"
4342265,WalleyeMatt,2015-11-26 05:28:00,93,"My wife has so many Canada sweat shirts and t-shirts now that she told me to stop bringing those, although some of the first ones are now wore out. Also have quite a few coffee cups which she claims are for me anyway because she does not drink coffee. I could use some new ideas also. Matt"
4342505,Pooch,2015-11-26 08:08:00,4619,"Things that sparkle used to work, but now it takes trips to Cabo or Eleuthera to work for me....... Probably should not figure that into the overall cost of a Canadian trip though. Cabo works great for me, too. The sacrifices we have to make in order to go fishing...Camp sweatshirts only work so long. Maybe ten or fifteen minutes tops.... Good luck with that one!Boat butt? I'll risk it.............Pooch"
