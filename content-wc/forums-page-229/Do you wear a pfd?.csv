4877433,Huntindave,2016-05-28 09:22:00,2194,Cabelas usually runs a sale on these at least twice a year. Right around a 100 dollars each. Buy two this year and two next year.
4880873,youngknight,2016-05-30 08:12:00,228,"PFDs certainly buys you time...in very cold water that time is less but much more than what most people think. Even someone going through the ice has likely 45 minutes or more before hypothermia kills them...if they don't drown first. They only have 3-5 minutes where they have strength and dexterity to try to self rescue. In my most recent search and rescue experience, there were 3 different agencies with boats in the water in the vicinity within 30 minutes of the call coming in, if the individual had a PFD on, chances were very good he would have been found and gotten to medical attention and ultimately survived. No PFD=drowning in that situation, LONG before any help could arrive. But, on that fly in trip, remote lake, near opening day, PFD an absolute must, but need to be extra mindful of rough water, underwater hazards, standing up relieving yourself overboard...simple things that can be fatal when water is cold and no one around to help. That must have been a horrible experience to find a fellow human being like that..and yes, although the individual died, it is a huge relief to family in order to find the remains of their loved ones."
4885017,REW,2016-05-31 11:15:00,40083,"Young knight. It is always best to wear your lift jacket. If for no other reason if you slip and fall in ice cold water and the boat gets away, it will be much easier for the search folks to find your body for the comfort of your loved ones and their closure. ---------- I recall the story of a Musky fisherman fishing alone on his boat on Mille Lacs during one cold October night. His boat was found drifting the next day. The searchers followed his gps track back to the point where the gps point became erratic and was the probably point of his going overboard. It appeared as if he had caught a Musky and was in the process of releasing it when he went overboard in heavy winter clothing. The search continued until ice out. The sheriff reported that often in the case of very cold water drownings, that due to the cold water, the body does not gas up and rise as is the case with warm water drownings. A couple of weeks after ice out, a person was walking the shore, and found the body tangled in weeds off shore. The water had warmed, the body had gassed up and had floated to the nearest shore. Finally after 6 months of wondering the family finally had closure. By the way, there are a lot of male bodies that are found with their flies down and zippers open. Apparently answering natures call over the side of the boat when a wave caught the boat and flipped them out of the boat. Do not answer natures call over the side, no matter how save you think the process. Rather, use a jog or bottle to do it on board and then rinse out the container to be able to close your zipper and get back to doing what you are doing. Be safe"
4888241,rockape,2016-06-01 07:35:00,215,"I bought a BPS PFD maybe 8 years ago. Too many wicked rocks that appear out of nowhere up in NW Ontario to take the chance. I'm a big muscular guy so people won't make fun of me wearing one. I ended up in the drink once, but it was right next to a floating dock. 40+ MPH winds and 4 footers and trying to get the Lund back to the dock. We got close and I was the rope man up front. Took a leap for the dock, and as soon as I was in the air, I knew I wouldn't make it. Grabbed the dock and got out quick, but **** that water was cold. Had the PFD on so no worries. I wear it when traveling. I take it off as soon as we get to the spot. And put it back on when we move. Not worth the risk. I never fish alone and 95% of my fishing buddies are pretty **** strong. Just remember...THE WATER IS REALLY COLD!!! You don't have long to get out of it."

4918417,GWC,2016-06-11 19:00:00,1021,I just bought an inflatable Mustang for my next trip to Canada. I also plan to wear it when fishing locally. We see too many people drown each year in our area lakes.
4855265,youngknight,2016-05-20 07:57:00,228,"Obviously, an inflatable belt is a HUGE improvement over nothing at all but are vastly inferior to the horse collar arrangement that keeps your head out of the water when you become too weak in cold water (i.e. becoming hypothermic) or if you are...or become unconscious when in the water. In Canada anyhow, such a device would almost certainly not be a legally acceptable flotation device...certainly the old foam belts are not. Still, better than nothing of course."
4855377,Golden Eagle,2016-05-20 08:34:00,2642,Put mine on when I got into the boat yesterday and took it off around 9:00 p.m.

4856241,Carnhzkr,2016-05-20 15:30:00,964,"I'm ashamed to admit that I rarely wear a PFD. I realize I'm opening myself up for all sorts of shaming and ridicule by admitting that, and I know there are 10,000 reasons why I should, but the truth is that I don't. I've been wanting to take the plunge and buy four of the Cabela's inflatables, but at $250 a pop, that's a deep plunge. I know, I know, ""what's a life worth?"", I can hear you muttering as you read that last sentence.Of course, I have plenty of the cheapo old-style vests and always have them hanging over the back of the seat to be legal, but they're uncomfortable and hot for more than a few minutes, so they remain as a backrest (I hear more muttering). I guess I'm a lot like my old man. He hates to wear seatbelts even though I tell him ""just put it on, you won't even notice it"". But he's a stubborn old farmer. Maybe Pooch can relate to that."
4862057,46Harley,2016-05-22 23:08:00,149,"A horse collar pops out of the belt when you pull the cord, just pull it over your head. They are USCG Type III approved. They are on sale now at Cabela's."
4862561,youngknight,2016-05-23 07:31:00,228,"Really? Never seen or heard of them before. Still not ideal since if you get knocked immobile in some way coming out of the boat you would float maybe face down, but if not, you have your vest with you as opposed to on the back of your seat or in a compartment. Wonder how awkward it is to get into the collar part."
4875929,deadhead1,2016-05-27 11:45:00,193,I wear my self inflate all the time. I had unfortunate experience of finding a guy floating a number of years ago and I can tell you it changes your perspective. In his case he was wearing a life jacket but water was very cold so I expect he died quickly. Either way at least he was found as they never found the canoe he was in.
4875977,brad34,2016-05-27 12:11:00,892,"Just wore my Cabela's Tournament 3500 auto inflate for the first time last weekend. Forgot I was wearing it only a few minutes after putting it on. I equate PFD's to seat belts. You'll probably never need one, but if you do, it may very well save your life. $100 is very cheap for something that could save your life."
4876353,drew59,2016-05-27 16:04:00,87,We wear the old fashioned kind when moving from spot to spot but not when trolling or casting. Do you wear inflatables over your outermost layer? I'm just wondering if you have to take it off when it warms up and vice versa.
4876857,brad34,2016-05-27 22:16:00,892,"Yes, you must wear inflatables on top of all other clothing."

4838186,prov1800,2016-05-15 10:10:00,5010,I mentioned in a earlier post that i dont wear one.i lied last week i went fishing and forgot my rain gear to cut the wind and cold weather.i ended up wearing my very old life jacket for some warmth which did help.getting back to my life jacket.i found it on the hwy 105 many years ago and have used it for water sking and such.works great.i was check by the OPP and had to produce a life jacket and gave it to one of the officers and was told he was going to give me a ticket due to the fact it wasnt a canadian coast gaurd approved vest.it was a US Coast gaurd approved one my guests at that time were wearing canadian vests that i have for them in my boat.we were all kinda shaking our heads with that comment.i told the ifficer i would see him in court over that deal.he never did give me the ticket.would have been a interesting day in court. As iam sure every fisherman from the states has a US approved vest.i still wear it to this day and not planning on replacing it.

I also installed a fold down ladder on the stern of the boat. As I fish alone I would need help getting back in.

4829426,MrSimon,2016-05-12 11:53:00,922,"I'll be the cynical SOB in this thread and say that PFDs are a great idea, but even more important is to avoid alcohol in the boat, driving too fast, being out in weather you shouldn't, not paying attention, or just plain ol screwing around in a boat. Not being an idiot will go a lot further in saving your life than wearing a PFD."
4829474,youngknight,2016-05-12 12:10:00,228,"Good point MrSimon. those things certainly will contribute to the incident happening where the PFD really may come into action - and of course should be avoided. I would rather not do an either-or...i.e. first alcohol and driving a boat simply don't mix - legally in Ontario that means zero alcohol on board (don't wish to open another discussion on that one, there have been others), but if guys choose to ignore it and have a couple of beer in a cooler - legal or not - I'm not going to condemn them...however, excessive alcohol there is simply no place for that. However, even when folks are ""behaving"" stuff has a way of happening...submerged log or unseen shoal, or simply taking a leak overboard (as has been said already, many a drowned angler has been found with their zipper open - but not if they had a PFD on). I would suggest the PFD is important anytime and anywhere - however, on a northern Ontario lake in May or June...the water simply is dang cold...most cold water victims don't eventually drown after suffering from hypothermia - they drown pretty quickly - shock of falling in, panicking and sucking in very cold water...BTW, an angler with a PFD can be in very cold water for at least 45 minutes before hypothermia becomes a threat to their life...they may lose strength and coordination within 5 minutes or so, but with a PFD on, they will at least be alive for a period of time where they can be rescued - or, can rescue themselves in the first couple of minutes by getting up on the boat or back into the boat."
4829562,MrSimon,2016-05-12 12:58:00,922,"Good points. I guess how risky it is to not wear one depends a lot on conditions. The vast majority of my fishing is done locally on small, electric only lakes. It's usually nice weather, warm water, I'm fishing with friends, and generally no more than 50 yards from shore. That's a whole lot different than fishing 20 miles out in a Canadian shield lake in rough conditions over 40 degree water .... or being on a fly-in lake in an early June snowstorm."
4829634,Wenty,2016-05-12 13:30:00,15,"Bought one of these several years ago. Have one for each family member. Despite what some might think they're actually quite comfortable to fish out of. Candidly they are ideal in Canada (or anywhere up north) from the Canadian opener well into June. Even on a hot day they are comfortable when boating. I wear mine always when I'm traveling and fishing rough waters. When its really hot I opt for the Mustang vest. I fish with a lot of large groups and am still amazed that a vast majority neglect wearing any kind of PDF, traveling or fishing. I was probably the same way once but having a family that you are responsible for changes all that."

I was also a lifeguard for years as well as a swimming instructor.The only time I wear one is when it is cold enough in the water to be a problem, or very rough weather.I've capsized in a canoe in 45 degree water, swam fully clothed with boots on, and climbed into boats from deep water. I know that this doesn't mean I won't have a problem at some point, but for where I spend my time, I don't believe it's necessary.Sent from my VS986 using Tapatalk"

I've looked at Mustang brand auto inflate pfd's and for my family and me it would be about $1,000. We could wear our traditional pfd's but, well it's cumbersome. When we fish there are usually no less than three of us on the boat, and I think it would be a rare case where all of us would end up overboard. I believe there is safety in numbers. Perhaps over time I'll purchase the Mustang type pfd's."

I like my Onyx and I'm 5' 9"", one of my fishing partners is 6' 8"" and finds the Mustangs less comfortable than the Onyx.

I've seen guys slip and fall on docks early or late in season when there is snow or frost on docks. Granite most times there is help at docks if one fell in, but if you fell and came unconscious it may help. Same with when your fishing even if big motor is not in gear I feel it will be easier if something happened wearing it all times vs only when Main motor is in gear. I wear the onyx auto/ manual one. In the heat of summer I can barely tell it is on. Only issue I have had is the humidity in Iowa seems to play with them. I have had them go off multiple times. I emailed the company and they said if it is really humid that sometimes they get activated. They scare the bajeepers out of one when they do go."
4826722,Lovetofish,2016-05-11 14:35:00,458,I fish with my family in Canada. We put our jackets on in the cabin each morning and bring them in each night. The rule is if the boat is moving your jacket is on. Our trip is during the summer so if we are drifting or trolling and it's warm out we may take them off until we move again. When we portage I use mine as a seat cushion. Those bench seats on the portage boats are too hard on my behind. Plus I figure I'm not going to get into too much trouble with my 3hp motor.

Perhaps this is not so much a question as a strong suggestion. I am guilty of not always wearing a PFD but in the spring when water is particularly numbing and especially under power, the PFD under the seat or in the bag or in the compartment is pretty much useless. With the inflatable ones being light and comfortable, why not put it on? Certainly I would not wear a PFD in the middle of summer when slowly trolling or jigging...unless conditions were rough or the boat was really small...but a 14 foot boat, moving under power to your fishing spot 2 weeks after ice out...likely nothing bad will happen, but when it does...? Am I being self righteous...maybe...but I recently participated in a search for an angler for whom it ultimately was the dive team that found his body. Wearing a life jacket...99% chance he would have been found alive...hypothermic yes, but alive. Instead, floating unused PFDs were found near the boat. I appreciate some of the fishing shows now - Fishing Canada, Reel Fishing with Bob Izumi where they regularly always wear their PFDs. Be safe fellas."

4822714,youngknight,2016-05-10 13:53:00,228,"Although it is sometimes said as almost a joke, or at least a light-hearted comment...it is amazing how many drowning victims...usually fishermen, who have been found with their zipper undone...for exactly that reason. In reality, there is no humor, just a family who has lost a loved one."
4822730,MikeG1,2016-05-10 13:57:00,434,...I have a Mustang HIT automatic inflatable and I love it. I don't even know it's on. I'm to the point I feel uncomfortable if I don't have it on.
4822874,SinOrSwim,2016-05-10 14:22:00,1528,"I never used to. When, I took my youngest with me a few years ago I decided I needed to invest in the auto inflatable ones. I did and now I wear it at all times whether I'm with my kids or on our guys trip. Even when it's hot, it's not uncomfortable."
4822938,kzoofisher,2016-05-10 14:40:00,5144,"Started wearing an inflatable all the time after I insisted my son wear a PFD all the time. So comfortable it isn't unusual for me to still have it on as I pull the boat up the ramp, comes off in the tie down lane as we pack everything away. I've seen a lot of injuries at work and they almost never happen when the situation appears dangerous. Normal operation and complacency is what gets you hurt."
4822962,andersaki,2016-05-10 14:43:00,1426,"I used to wear a PFD only in rough weather. Last year I bought a self inflating one from Cabelas and honestly after awhile I forget that it is on, even when it's warm. Besides wearing it I'm trying to make a habit of hooking up to the tether switch. I would guess the worst case scenario would be getting bucked out of the boat and hitting your head on something like maybe the windshield. The combination of the two will not only prevent a drowning, but also maybe getting run over by your own boat. andersaki"

I have an inflatable pfd that I have used for 7 years. How often do you change the cartridge even if it still shows green. Instructions say to test it in a pool. Seems rather silly, you have no way to be certain the new cartridge is installed correctly until you need it."
4823394,bigwalleye1,2016-05-10 16:39:00,2632,"After a 4x fatal a couple years ago, I think on Erie, I bought two of the best inflatables fro Cabelas and they are on if the big motor is running above idle. I thought I'd get cr@p from one boat partner in particular, but he never said a word about it. They are so comfortable, I've gotten up and started fishing before I realized I'm still wearing the thing."
