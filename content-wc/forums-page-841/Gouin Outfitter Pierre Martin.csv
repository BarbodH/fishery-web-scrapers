Does anyone out there have a way to contact this outfitter? Better yet, has anybody out there have any experience with this fellow that they'd be willing to share? My buddy loved his trip with this outfitter but , like many of us, retained nothing but the memorys of a great time -w- plenty of fish. Any help greatly appreciated!"

I've never stayed at his spot but am reasonably familiar with the area. On a personal level I have shared a pop or two with Pierre at different shows and he's one heck of a great guy."

535502,Guest,2003-10-26 19:08:00,0,hi- i have been to martins 4 times and it is a good camp- very nice people. the only drawback is they are 8-10 miles from the main body of the gouin and sometimes you must go out there for the best fishing- always had plenty of fish near the camp and would not let that stop you. you wont go wrong with them- good luck
