It seems like both lakes would be great places to fish. I was hoping that someone out there could give some info that would help me decide between the two . . . maybe a big fish story or something . . . anything about either of these lakes that might be interesting. I'm not looking for fishing techniques or anything, just some fun information. Any negative comments would be helpful too. Thanks, Simon"

Depending on where you are travelling from, I would suggest looking at the Gouin Reservoir as your destination, as there was no comparison in the quality of fishing in my eyes. From the Ottawa area both were about 8 hr drives, although the route to the Gouin has much more dirt road to it. Although Brad and Ginny Mullens, the owners of Lake Ogascanan Lodge, are top notch hosts and do their best to make your trip enjoyable, for similar $$$ and travel time, I would choose the Gouin every time. If you want any further info/opinions, email me at [email protected] My 2 cents, PK"

For what it's worth, Wally Mullins, the host at Sasseginaga, is an absolute comic. Seriously, he could put many ""professional"" comedians to shame. Take a few minutes and relax with a beverage with this guy and you're guaranteed a laugh or two. Good topics to get him started: Rookie fisherman....American Beer.....night life in Valdour...."" I wanna be a resort owner""......he really made our trip one to remember."
