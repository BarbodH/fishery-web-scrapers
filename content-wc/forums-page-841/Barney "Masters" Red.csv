535375,Ivy,2003-10-14 13:54:00,556,I drank to much beer. And lost a few of the good brain cells. How did it go? Ivy
535376,Guest,2003-10-14 15:12:00,0,"When wolves approach the buffalo herd, the buffalo herd runs. The slowest, weakest buffalo are caught and killed by the wolves, thereby affectively culling the herd so that only the strongest, smartest, and healthiest buffalo live to reproduce. This insures the health of the herd. It's like when you drink alcohol. Everyone knows alcohol kills brain cells and of course, it would be the oldest and weakest brain cells that die....so that is why you feel smarter when you drink beer. Or something like that???"
535379,Guest,2003-10-14 17:31:00,0,"Yankee, Are you like a College Professor or something like that? Your last post was deep man. If Barney ever gives me up I would like to ride Buffalos with you."
535381,Guest,2003-10-14 18:59:00,0,"Just trying to remember what Cliffy said. But hey.. you got the beer... I know where there are some buffs. You ride first, eh?"
535382,timeout,2003-10-15 11:27:00,28,"Glad you had a good time, but seriously how was fishing? Were you one of the lucky few who had good fishing or did you do like most people I see and catch a lot of sauger with the occasional greenback."
535385,Guest,2003-10-15 13:13:00,0,"Once in a while a Greenback would attack us but few and far between...little Sauger and Bullheads nibbled away our salty supply. Six days...Three fisherman...1 28"" Greenback, 6 20"" Greenbacks"
535387,timeout,2003-10-15 13:58:00,28,"Thank you for the report. It is consistent with our results and that of some other locals. I am somewhat of a local and as such am not prepared to write the run off just yet, but it does look like another bad year. Obviously from this board and others there is a lot of debate as to the quality and quantity of fish. I appreciate the unadorned truth. We(the wife and kids) were out 9 days in a row. Fished all day twice and even pulled the kids out of school to fish in the afternoon until dark. We fished from shore 4x and 5x we fished in the boat between Selkirk bridge and Doc Reids. We have seen some big ones come out, but not by us. I have access to a private cabin on what the province calls a remote lake, where the fishing is better, yet we still keep on working the red. The reason is quite simple, if I want more fish I will go somewhere else, if I want a chance at my own personal best or even the new provincial record I will fish the red. Having said that I hope to get out a few more times before hard water gets here. Thanks again for the report."
535388,Guest,2003-10-15 15:02:00,0,"Timeout, You are 100% right. The Red may be slow fishing but you never know when ""Old Gramma Walleye"" is going to give you a shot. Good Luck"
535336,Guest,2003-10-13 08:06:00,0,"While others struggled to catch Greenbacks on the Red last week Barney just kept reeling them in. While fishing with two lesser fisherman in the boat with him Barney hooked Greenback after Greenback and released Master Angler fish one after another. The only time Barney would take a break was to sign autographs and drink a Coke while eating black cookies to keep his strength up. Many boats stopped to just watch Barney display his awesome Greenback catching ability or to just catch a glimpse of the Master fishing. ABC will be airing a show entitled ""Greenbacks With Barney"" on the Saturday before the Super Bowl."
535345,Guest,2003-10-13 14:50:00,0,I got to spend some time with Barney last week on the Red. He is truly a great fisherman and very handsome. He spent extra time with me showing me his special techniques. We sipped on Merlout at the end of each day and ate smoked Salmon on these cute little crackers.
535346,Guest,2003-10-13 15:15:00,0,"What is merlout? Maybe something like gas-ex or white out? After consuming, does it expel ""merl""? What is ""merl"", in that case. What flavour is it? Go cubs!"
535354,Guest,2003-10-13 17:30:00,0,"Yankee, Merlot is a dry red wine made from a grape widely grown in Bordeaux and California. Barney used to drink Ripple but now that he is a legend among Walleye Fisherman he has chosen to sip the nectar of the ""Yuppie""."
535355,Reels,2003-10-13 17:39:00,2876,It's Dajavue all over again! Didn't this go around last year? Too funny. <{{}}><
535366,Guest,2003-10-14 09:34:00,0,"Yes, I know what Merlot is. Frazier and Niles drink it. But, what is merlout? LOL! Go Cubs"
535371,Guest,2003-10-14 12:21:00,0,Merlout is what the Cubs will drink if they lose their next two games....GO MARLINS
535372,Ivy,2003-10-14 12:40:00,556,Marlins are a fish. A cub is a bear. Bears eat fish. Cubs eat Marlins. A merlot grape makes merlot wine. Not all merlot wines are made up of 100% merlot grapes. To be considered a Merlot Wine you must have at least 80% of the Merlot grape When did I turn into Cliff at Cheers? Ivy
535373,Guest,2003-10-14 13:15:00,0,"Cliff / Ivy, Actually Im a Cub fan just because Barney is ....so I hope the Cubs do eat the Marlins. If so we can all have a glass of Merlot....or a quart of Ripple."
535374,Guest,2003-10-14 13:25:00,0,Thanks. Now how did Cliffy's buffalo theorum go? Hah..Remember that!
