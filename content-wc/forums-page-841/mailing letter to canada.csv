I think you should take a chill pill before you go running off your big mouth. Has your mother never told you to keep quiet before lipping off?"
535473,Guest,2003-10-24 11:18:00,0,"Actually lets be aware that both the American and Canadian Postal systems are extremely automated , no one stands there and individually looks to see if correct stamp and type is in place. it is very quickly read and only a random audit catches those letters not having the correct stampage. The Canadian system was tested by a a media outlet as a joke a coupe,of years ago where they put Kids stickers or Cigarette package seals that were roughly the same size , or 6 cent stamps on the envelopes instead of correct stamps and 95% got to their destination. Its even to much paperwork for the walking letter carrier to notice it and return it back to depot so they ignore if they notice most times. (My sister inlaw is in postal service) So be prepared though that random audit might find your letter without postage and send it back with your cheque to the outfitter you planned so carefully. jake"

Just ask the posties...they will tell ya."
535251,Guest,2003-10-06 13:56:00,0,"I wonder if it cost anymore to mail a letter from the US to Canada, or does standard 37 cent stamp work."
535252,Trailerguy,2003-10-06 14:33:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Canada not being part of the states, requires international postage as does any foreign country. The last letter I posted to Ontario cost me 60 cents when weighed and stamped at the USPS. :)"
535254,Guest,2003-10-06 19:18:00,0,I thought postage to Canada was $0.45. I just sent in our deposit for our fishing vacation to Ontario. Was just a short note and check.
535256,Guest,2003-10-06 21:07:00,0,Being in the mailing business a first class letter to Canada will cost you .60 at any US Post Office. It is considered foreign mail. .60 is for anything under an ounce.
535260,Guest,2003-10-07 11:15:00,0,If I was supposed to have $0.60 postage but only had $0.45 postage what happens to the letter? Does it still go to Canada and the recipiant pay the difference or is the letter returned to me?
535262,Guest,2003-10-07 11:55:00,0,"I am pretty sure it will come back to you, after it sits at the border for QUITE A WHILE. That is what happened tp me."
535266,Reels,2003-10-07 16:55:00,2876,"Never thought about it before, but when I send up my deposits in the past, I only put the standard postage on it. Guess I'll have to make sure I put more on next time and consider myself lucky. <{{}}><"
535267,Guest,2003-10-07 16:59:00,0,Today I sent my deposit up to Dryden for our spring '04 trip. I put on 2 US Postage stamps based on this post. That should be ok shouldn't it??? I don't remember stopping at the USPS to get a Canadian stamp in the past. Thanks.
535305,Guest,2003-10-11 20:36:00,0,"I have seen some letters go through on two US postage stamps, but it is best to just take it to the Post Office and let them take care of it."
535459,Guest,2003-10-23 12:22:00,0,"I can't believe that a thread like this would even exist. My 6-year old can mail a letter for heaven's sake. But perhaps the difference between my 6-year old and some of you is that he recognizes that Ontario and Canada are not a part of the United States...not yet anyway. But as an avid historian, the words ""Manifest Destiny"" are still something to be feared. But until Manifest Destiny occurs, Canada still remains a separate country, with separate laws, currency, politicians...and yes, even a separate Postal Service. Might I suggest a crash geography lesson for the fellas who astoundingly think of Canada as that big state up in the north...you know, the big state with all the igloos. Cheers."
