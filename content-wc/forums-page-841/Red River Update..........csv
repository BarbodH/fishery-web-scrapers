535290,Guest,2003-10-09 07:53:00,0,"I refuse to sit here and argue with you but Bobby's father-in-law is one of the guys I buy my bait from. He's tells me that there's loads of shiners in the river which is indeed the case. The problem is from his perspective is they're on the small side. This doesn't sit well if you're in the business of selling minnows to the public.......... Fish ""HARD"" Forever!"
535292,Guest,2003-10-09 13:08:00,0,That is fairly awesome...sizewise. Good going!
535293,Guest,2003-10-09 14:07:00,0,"I am originally from Sioux City and my parents live there now. I am heading up to the red with my father this weekend. Wondering where to put in or where the best boat landing is located near the ""Miracle Mile"". This will be our first trip up there. Also, what color of jigs/size? 3/8 Fireball?"
535295,Guest,2003-10-09 18:47:00,0,How many guys and how many days? Or was this one day? Jigging or Trolling?
535296,Backwater Eddy,2003-10-10 05:11:00,3871,"I think what many may be missing here, or possibly overlooking, is what they chose for a presentation. Most everyone is jigging shiners, or trolling. The Iowegians went with a tip from Stu's guides and used crawlers on jigs and it paid off. Adapt and persivier..Eh. My point is subtle changes in a presentation often may make all the difference. The low flows on the Red may make the night crawler scent more appealing then shiners for some odd reason only known to the greenbacks? With the water temps in the low 50's crawlers are not that unusual of a choice really. During the spring we wouldn't think twice about worms as a walleye bait option. It is just that we are conditioned to think minnows both salted or live in the fall is all. Food for thought....er..Ah...food for greenbacks maybe? ;) Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ><,sUMo,>"
535384,WalleyeGod,2003-10-15 12:25:00,4,"Was up to the Red last Thurs. afternoon until Sunday noon. Here are the numbers. Thurs. 3 Greenbacks-biggest 23 1/2 , Friday 5 greenbacks- Two between 8 and 9 lbs, Saturday 19 greenbacks-biggest 8 1/2 lbs several in the 17-23"" range and a couple at 25 1/2"". Sunday 8 greenbacks-biggest 10 1/4 lbs with the others up to 23 1/2"" . Two boats, four guys. Jig fishing with salties and using crankbaits. Crankbaits had the edge. Two other boats up there I knew reported slow but each day had one between 8 and 10 lbs. I saw a few other big ones caught in that 5-8 lb range and heard of a couple other 28-29"" fish caught. Good Luck,"
535263,Guest,2003-10-07 12:55:00,0,"Just another quick update for the Red...... One of my guides produced a couple a beauties this morning for the clients. The largest weighed in at 12.6 lbs. followed by a 9.2 lbs.! They also caught a 24"" and a couple of smaller 16""er's as well. No doubt about it, things are getting very interesting once again here on the Red. Over the past few days there's been some hawg's caught. The largest was caught by a guy from Sioux City, the fish weighed ""14"" plus! We can only hope that the trend continues and that the Red will keep producing, for when she gets hot, she can take your breath away! For the record...those 'eyes that were caught this morning with my guide were ""all"" released! Fish ""HARD"" Forever!"
535265,Todd_NE,2003-10-07 13:09:00,1330,"Stu, If we come over from Pine Falls, how would we get some 21' boats in? Is your facility in good shape yet? Any comments on whether the good fish are coming from North or south of the Selkirk park? Thanks for the report Stu, mucho appreciated. Todd Yup, got her... oh yeah... feel that head shake!"
535268,Guest,2003-10-07 17:19:00,0,"I've got a 2150 baron and i've benn there twice. once when the water was high two weeks ago,and last tuhrs. when itwas as low as i've ever seen it. i hade no problem either time. I'll be there this weekend. good luck fishing maybe i'll see you there B.K."
535271,Guest,2003-10-08 05:43:00,0,Stu Where is the hot spot? I know of 3 groups that went up last weekend and landed a total of 3 greenbacks. The biggest was 3 pounds. This is 3 days of fishing. Lots of baby sauger. One group went to Pine Falls and it was just as bad. These are guys that have been there several times. They all say don't waste your time. Give it a couple weeks.
535272,Guest,2003-10-08 06:35:00,0,"I guess if you follow the operative words, ""give it time"" then in my opinion that time is here! I fully agree that it's been off to a very slow start to this years run, but things are changing and as is the case with the Red, changing fast. Over the past few days the numbers or catch rate of trophy 'eyes has been on the incline. The more folks that I've had the opportunity to communicate with, the more fish I'm finding out about...... I've been saying all along that this year has all the makings for a decent run, simply because of the shiner population in the system. It now appears that my hunches are panning out. Let's hope that this current trend continues and that more and more 'eyes will make their way into the Red. Don't be too suprised if without warning the action at Pine Falls takes off. Let's hope that this will be the case and that overall we enjoy a brilliant fall. For what it's worth, walleye are being caught within a half mile of the dam and as far north as Netley. Fish ""HARD"" Forever!"
535275,Todd_NE,2003-10-08 09:00:00,1330,"Where did you put in Bob?? Thanks Todd Yup, got her... oh yeah... feel that head shake!"
535283,Guest,2003-10-08 17:47:00,0,We were out yesterday and got one 6 pounds talked to lots of anglers that got zero!!! one fish here and one there with the amount of boats on the river does't consitute a run. Read Bobbys post on his father in law not catching any minnows through the system(father in law is local bait Supplier) Just my thoughts Seems like you are the only one that has any positive reports!
535284,Guest,2003-10-08 19:36:00,0,"we are the group from sioux city \6 guys 1- 14 ,1 13-10,1- 12-5,1- 11-10 ,1- 10-8, 2- 10, 3- 9, 6- 8 ,several 3-5s plus some eaters.today was the dead sea but tommorow is another day.jig jig jig jig"
535286,Northern Manitoban,2003-10-08 22:28:00,195,"It does look like things are starting to pick up on the Red,But for the drive and cost for me to come i want things to be a little more promising.I have been fishing a river system in Northern Manitoba and things are slow also have caught one nice walleye 8 pounds last week and will try again this weekend,its been to warm everywhere.Nights are getting cooler so i'm hoping by the weekend things will improve,seems the pike are active but slow on the walleyes.Would really like to see the Red of old,i would definetly take the time for that.NM"
535287,Backwater Eddy,2003-10-09 05:36:00,3871,"Posted by coyote on 10/8/2003, 8:32 pm Just got back and had some fun on a beautiful day. We caught 6 greenbacks with the biggest at 26"" and smallest at 19""(no masters today). We did see multiple masters being caught all around us and one of the outfitters landed 3 in the 8 to 9 pound range. We did have one big one right at the boat and hook popped off.....hate when that happens. Met 3 nice guys up from Iowa that landed their biggest ever at 28.5"". We also had about 30 plus saugers as everyone was landing them throughout the day. We were using only salted shiners but there was the odd boat using crawlers as well including the Iowa guys. Some caught on both. Hope you guys all had a good outing as well. Posted by timeout on 10/8/2003, 11:22 pm, ""Red River drift fished around steam plant,jigged salties and crawlers 1 walleye between 13:30 and 19:00. I don't know about the greenbacks right now but we had triple headers of sauger. Way too many sauger to even guesstimate. 1 shore angler by the bridge had 3 walleye 21"" largest. Rest on the stretch where we drifted and threw the 12'er in had 0 walleye with out even much sauger. 2 Americans who have been trolling the same stretch we drift for the last 3 days reported 2 masters released in am and of course sauger. If those things were larger I would say what an incredible fishery it is, because the numbers are amazing. As far as I can tell the run is pretty disappointing so far. The numbers just aren't here yet. The Americans I talk to are shrugging their shoulders. Won't be able to get out for a while, hoping the colder weather coming will bring them up, because the current flow isn't likely to change much soon. As to forage, lots of sauger are just meal sized for the greenbacks I want to catch. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I guess it all depends on when and where you go. Don't shoot the messenger for delivering the reports at hand. So far what I see in sifting through the reports from many sources is the Red is better then the Falls so far. Some folks hit it, others do not. The numbers are not in so thick that all you need to do is show up and they to jump in the net. The ""Pluggers"" keep at it and score is what I see and hear. I still suspect the warm weather has the bait and the greenbacks lurking around the marsh and shallow. With no real flow they have no incentive to stay in the channel or run the current edges to hunt. Speculation on my part and I hope to check it our real soon and see if it pays off in green gold.
