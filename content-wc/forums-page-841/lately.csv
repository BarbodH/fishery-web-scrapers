535322,Trailerguy,2003-10-13 06:08:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I just returned from closing up the cottage last night. The weather was beautiful last week, low 40's at night to mid 80's days. The orange to gold leaves peaked about Thursday. Then rain moved in Sat. and they were all on the ground. Eye's were biting in summer patterns on the warm days, but got lock jaw when the rain/cool temps came. Bass were hitting good but pike didn't bother us all week. By Saturday there was a moose hunter behind every bush; time to stay out of the woods. :)"
