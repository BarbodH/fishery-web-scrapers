535380,Hawgeye,2003-10-14 18:27:00,1355,I reviewed the tournament results from last weekend to see that the fishing obviously is still terrible. The winning team had over 40lbs for two days and the second place team was around 32lbs. Most were under 10lbs total! I did in the 20lb range for two days when I was there a couple weeks ago so it has not improved much. Has anyone had any better luck? Is it picking up at all? Any information would be greatly appreciated.
