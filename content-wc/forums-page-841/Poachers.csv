Local News Anglers Fined For Overlimits Tb News Source Web Posted: 10/23/2003 8:17:48 PM The province's coffers are richer by nearly $13 000 as a result of fines levied against 23 American and one Canadian angler in the Geraldton district. M.N.R. Conservation Officers charged different parties after conducting checks on the road and from the air. In one of the more significant cases eight Wisconsin men were fined $3200 and had all their fishing equipment confiscated for having an overlimit of walleye.
