535241,Guest,2003-10-04 15:50:00,0,Anybody ever fished Holly Lake thru Northern Wilderness outfitters?? We fly in this Friday day for a Moose hunt and hopfully some fishing! Would be great if anybody knows this lake. Also will post our thoughts on the outfitter as I know someone had posted about using them next year. I have talked to guy that used them last year and they were very happy. Thanks- Dennis

Let me know what you think and how the fishing was. Any tips & spots would be appreciated. Hunt safe. JerryK"

The whole crew from NWO were great, the cabin is nice, fishing was good. We fished 1-2 hours a day and seemed to get eyes on any point we tried. Hard to get on plastics as minnows were preferred. also got some trolling cranks. Lots of northern, 1 @ 37"" eyes ran 13-18"". Nice size lake approx. 2000 acres. Summer fishing should be even better. Bring a depth finder if possible! Good luck- Dennis"
