535470,Guest,2003-10-24 05:11:00,0,Besides the poor catch rate of minnows I have noticed the size in the tubs I'm buying. They are really small...unfortunately the tiny minnows are all you can buy. Checked the store yesterday at Powerview...the locally caught minnows in there tubs are also very small. Hopefully can get some nice sized ones into the bait shops for ice fishing.

535480,Guest,2003-10-24 14:39:00,0,Thanks...will give them a try
535277,Guest,2003-10-08 11:28:00,0,"After ""Walleyes"" and ""Papa's"" rotten fishing report on the Red this last week-end that was posted on the 6th & 7th., it didn't take very long for a resort owner to brighten up the report. Just wondering???"
535278,Guest,2003-10-08 11:49:00,0,"Same M.O. as last year. Place your trust on those reports from folks ""just like you"" who have invested vacation time and money for the trip. I made frequent posts last year regarding Red and Wiinipeg reports that steered one into believing the bite is on or ""just around the corner."" In all sincerity, I cannot wait til the year arrives when fishing there returns to it ""hay day""."
535285,Guest,2003-10-08 19:42:00,0,dont be so hard on stu you cant catch greenbacks if you arent on the water.every day is a new day you gotta be out there to catch them
535308,Guest,2003-10-12 06:51:00,0,"It's unfortunate that you guys were here a little early this year, for the action this past week on the Red has been on a huge up-swing! No doubt the first few weeks were painfully slow, but it now appears that the bite is on.......... As for those comments on ""resort owner"", I've said it all along, I tell it how is, if the action's hot you'll hear about it and if it's not I won't give false or misleading reports. If you recall postings I made way back in August regarding my opinion on how the ""fall-run"" would unfold this year. It was my gut feeling at the time that because of the vast numbers of emerald shiner in the system that it had all the makings for a strong showing of greenbacks. Well it appears that it's all coming to a head. Just keep reading the posts and I think you'll find that a lot of guys are now enjoying success, obviously some more than others, but that's seems to be the case no matter where we fish. As for Pine Falls, it's still not doing much, it's still very disappointing, but like the Red, things can change in a heartbeat. Hopefully that will be the case soon and those that frequently fish the 'Peg will start to reep the rewards. Fish ""HARD"" Forever!"
535334,Guest,2003-10-13 07:28:00,0,"Just returned from a week on the Red. It was very slow for us and everybody we talked to simply shrugged their head and mumbled ""Awful slow"". We did hear some storys about guys doing well but we didnt see the results. We could have used some sun screen a couple of days and the south wind prevailed. We still had a great time just because we were fishing."
535335,Guest,2003-10-13 07:53:00,0,Fished all day Sunday from Netley to the Fort. No greebacks just sauger and goldeye. Talked to a lot of boats and only a very few had caught any greenbacks. For the huge number of boats on the river I would say the fishing is poor.
535347,Guest,2003-10-13 15:19:00,0,"Well, from what I can tell, Barney was there and him and another guy got the merl out. (last I heard)."
535349,Guest,2003-10-13 15:39:00,0,"I fished all day Sunday from Netley to the Fort and then up to the mouth, caught one 13 inch green back and heard of a few boats doing the same, but mainly getting anything but Green Backs. With the amount of boats around and never seeing the nets go out too often, I would say the run isn't on just yet. Is it to early or have the commerial and sport fisherman over fished and we are now reaping the low fish numbers.?"
535383,WalleyeGod,2003-10-15 12:08:00,4,"Was up to the Red last Thurs. afternoon until Sunday noon. Here are the numbers. Thurs. 3 Greenbacks-biggest 23 1/2 , Friday 5 greenbacks- Two between 8 and 9 lbs, Saturday 19 greenbacks-biggest 8 1/2 lbs several in the 17-23"" range and a couple at 25 1/2"". Sunday 8 greenbacks-biggest 10 1/4 lbs with the others up to 23 1/2"" . Two boats, four guys. Jig fishing with salties and using crankbaits. Crankbaits had the edge. Two other boats up there I knew reported slow but each day had one between 8 and 10 lbs. I saw a few other big ones caught in that 5-8 lb range and heard of a couple other 28-29"" fish caught. Good Luck, WG"
535467,Bobby,2003-10-23 21:40:00,211,"Had posted a while back about shiner minnows on the Red, that my father-in-law (a local commercial bait fisherman) had been having tough luck this fall catching minnows. He could get no minnows on the Red. A scarce few greenbacks were being caught in Netley Creek. This also happened to be the only place he got a few tubs of minnows. He couldn't get them in the river nor along miles and miles of the shore of the big lake. Well, the last week or so has been improving quite a bit for him. This has, apparently, coincided with somewhat better walleye catches on the river... A few years ago he had a fantastic fall with the minnows. Last year though was probably his worst fall ever. This fall was shaping up to be another bad one however the shiners have suddenly turned on as I'd mentioned. Let's just hope the shiner run keeps holding up, the water temps keep dropping bit by bit, the ice stays off the water, and the walleye run keeps improving. Last year, I think we set a record in Manitoba for lowest temperature for the whole month of October - it was miserable and lots of guys had their boats put away by now. With the poor weather and fishing, everyone had good reason to give up. Hopefully this fall there's still lots of days left on the river and the fishing keeps getting better. Still hoping to land a hog! ""Hold on to the boat, boys, she's gonna ram us!"""
