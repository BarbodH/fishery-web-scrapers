535490,Bryan,2003-10-25 22:19:00,244,"Call ""Rauer Electronics"" in Vancouver at 604-985-3355. I bought my X-19 from them last year over the phone. They were a couple hundred bucks less than anywhere else I could find and the service was excellent. Had the unit on the bus the same day as I ordered it and was exactly what I paid for. They also carry parts and do service and warranty work on Lowrance equipment."
