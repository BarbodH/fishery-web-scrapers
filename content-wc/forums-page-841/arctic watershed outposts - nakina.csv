535486,Guest,2003-10-25 09:53:00,0,"I also agree that AWO is a good deal, Remi and Chrisine will take good care of you. AWO contracts out the actual flying to Nakina Air or Luennbergers but Remi will fly in to check on you and take care of anything you need. Kapatongwa is great with the best fishing on the 7 mile lake about a Par 5 from the dock Melchett is also very good and you can take the Kap river between these two lakes Don't go to Wayner, its no good at all!"
