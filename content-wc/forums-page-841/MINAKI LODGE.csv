535177,Guest,2003-09-25 21:58:00,0,"Bobby, What does what Archer did 15 years ago have to do with fishing?? They are worlds apart!!! Further more - do you know all the facts? I swear I can't fiqure out why everyone is against the Lodge. Archer is the ONLY one who had the guts to buy the place! Does anybody want to see reciepts for the donations he has made to Children's Miracle Network? The Canadian Cancer Institute? The land he donated at Minaki for the Air Ambulance pad? He has put his heart into Minaki and for what? This stuff? You seem to be doing alot of homework on Phil - Why?? Nothing else to do? Wife out of town? Just go fish - enjoy life!! We are!! Aghhh-Hawaii is great this time of the year! We already have several bookings for next year - and yes some of them know the history of the Lodge and it's owner - Who cares????"
535184,Guest,2003-09-26 09:38:00,0,now can we put a end to this soap opera and start talking about fishing . i think thats what this web page is about???? so shut up and fish..
535192,Bobby,2003-09-26 15:21:00,211,"Eeeeouch! Hammered by the guest user! I only posted a couple of links with the comment ""make up your own minds."" Turbo, what crawled up your...? Here's some of your comments from your previous post and how DUMB they are: 1) ""What does what Archer did 15 years ago have to do with fishing?? They are worlds apart!!!"" First, he OWNS a LODGE with BOATS and GUIDES. Doesn't that mean that HE and HIS lodge have something to do with fishing? 2) ""You seem to be doing alot of homework on Phil."" Hey, I queried his name ONCE and posted TWO links with a comment about which people can make up their own minds. For those of us with a mind, this 'homework' takes all of about five minutes. Hardly homework, for those of us who've actually ever had homework. I could go on, but I won't. Anyhow, it's great that you've got bookings next year. It's nice that people have a place to work, jobs are created, etc. Minaki Lodge isn't for me and I don't have to go there. Nor do my friends, co-workers, or whomever else that decides they don't want to go there. I've read your comments since this post started. Its a lost cause... give it up Turbo. I suppose I must let you in on this little fact... I hope you realize that this specific post about Minaki Lodge has just become a place where we can post our little barbs to make you mad. It has been fun...! EVERYONE on this board knows that you're only trying to salvage your own job. We can't blame you however its kind of sad. You're like a walking advertisement trying to put out the little fires that have spread (the negativity surrounding the lodge.) Good luck, Turbo, keep at it. Yes, I will be returning to fishing and also the fishing posts. This particular post is done, just like the lodge. ""Hold on to the boat, boys, she's gonna ram us!"""
535194,Reels,2003-09-26 15:30:00,2876,"Turbo, I think everyone wants to see the lodge do great, heck, I loved my martini's this year, and hope to have more. You have a PR problem though. The lodge is being slammed about very poor management and for treating employees like moose dung. I have no idea if true or not, but it dosen't matter in this business. What matters is your reputation. You guys got to fix that. Who knows, maybe local establishments feel threatend. Either way, your getting slammed. Gotta go on a PR campain and make wrongs right.

535200,Guest,2003-09-26 21:08:00,0,"Ever since Minaki opened they (some of their staff/management whoever) tried to make this message board their own little posting area for the lodges information during the summer. Fishing reports etc..Like almost daily. Should have put that on the site instead. Strange to see that really. Now all of this garbage. 1-So Minaki Lodge is closed. To me, that is not surprising as I know some of the history of the place. It was a Government hide out for many years, too much money has been put into the place by various firms not to mention Government funds, write offs etc in the past and it just might be too large to make it work even to this day. 2-If the hotel chain that operated it, could not make it work, what makes you think the Archer Group can?? 3-I understand why the natives could not make it work. Look at the history of native operations. Not many succeed without a truck load of Government funding. 4-Maybe the Archer Group will open next year, maybe too they will succeed. I only follow the history of the place, and it has been a White Elephant for many years. The only saviour for the place might be a Casino permit. But when I even look at that, who in their right mind would go gambling at the place in -40 below weather in the winter?? Every lodge/resort/campground is for sale at the right price. Everyone should know that one. Is Minaki Lodge worth $7--8 million. I doubt if that shows on paper. Good Luck. Seeing is believing."

The rest of the names you quoted were not management. I'd be interested in hearing your opinion on why I left. As a guide I worked from May 5 to May 30 with zero guiding days and no real promises for the future, that was a good reason to leave. You proved my point by listing all of Minaki's guides in your previous post. BTW, it was me that approached you and introduced myself, not that it matters."
534936,Guest,2003-09-12 01:07:00,0,"I am going by your previous post - my, my you have sure changed your tune!!! Thats fine, Eric!! You had a great summer - thats all that matters. At least you weren't near that old dump called Minaki Lodge. Your expertise would have saved the whole place!!! I'm glad for you, you got the #### out. Great Manager? Who might you be talking about?????? Mike??? How did you get along with him in May????? RTMG? Anyone - wanna back this up?? Eric, do everyone a favour, and post factual info here!!!!"
534937,Bobby,2003-09-12 01:49:00,211,"I had called the day before it closed and I asked about room availability. I was told there were lots of rooms available and asked if I wanted to book one, $169 for the next night. I advised I would talk it over with my wife first. I was then told that in a few days (Sept 4th) a $99 special that included golf was being offered and I should consider booking for then. I stated we weren't looking to book for that time, just for the next day and would call back. The next morning we tried to call and book for that evening. No answer. Found out a few hours later it was ""closed for the day"" and they were, when asked, unsure when it would open again. Good thing I didn't book the day ahead and even better yet that I didn't consider booking the $99 'special' a few days down the road! Yeah, it sure would have been special! Anyhow, I won't consider booking next year or any other year. I think Minaki Lodge will have a hard time A) booking any guests or B) selling the place, after this fiasco.

I would like to believe your statements about the Lodge reopenning, but how can you be so sure? Are you one of the owners & financial backers? As far as who I am and why I am curious about the credibility of your claims. I am a fisherman who has been coming to Minaki the last 11 years with a group of fishermen. I really like the area and I hope all the resorts do well. Our fishing group is loyal to a different resort, however for 2004 I am thinking of making an extra trip with my family. I will be coming for the fishing, but my youngest boy and wife need additional entertainment like a golf course, so I though the Minaki Lodge may be a good fit. Right now from comments from Eric, Bobby and others, I'm having second thoughts. (might be wise to wait until 2005) IaCraig"
534950,River_eye,2003-09-12 12:21:00,1486,"Rod, I hardly ever saw you when I was there, so I would not really expect you to know much about my situation. You probably heard a rumor about me, but you said so yourself, don't believe everything you hear or read. I would have still been working at the lodge when they closed it a short while ago had I not been given a better job somwhere else. Minaki simply rubbed me the wrong way so I'm not that bitter like some of the people that got totally screwed. I would love to see that lodge run, as I have memories of the place from when I was a child, but from what I've seen, I'm not getting my hopes up."

Regarding your 2005 comment, it is very premature to know what to expect for next season. We know we have a spectacular property - as in previous post we acknowledge we did things right and wrong at the Lodge this summer. Our first priority is to let things calm down right now, get our debt taken care of and search for a proper manager. We have a great core of people - we already know the staff that will be coming back next season which we are greatful for."

Eric, try telling the truth about why you were not at Minaki Lodge guiding. I personally came up to you while we were walking up to the lodge and welcomed you on board and we discussed some of your posting regarding the airport. As far as the comments about having no one who knew anything about fishing - I would like to take a moment to thank Mike, Larry, Josh, Jamie, George - and even RTMG for a GREAT summer. Our photo albums are full of many great people enjoying thier fishing trips at Minaki Lodge. I can't wait until next year. We learnt alot of valuble things this year and we will carry everyone of them over to next. RTMG knows what I am talking about."

No, they had not travelled from 16 hours away. We had one person ask us to make alternative arrangements for him - which we did in Kenora. The rest were honestly fine with it - they had spent the previous days with us and understood we had some serious issues with service and management. They are all being addressed - I wish i could tell you more. In case you didn't know, our service wasn't the best. We will be back stronger than ever - let the dust settle - you'll see! We are committed to making Minaki Lodge a success. Sale of the Lodge? - every piece of real estate we own is for sale for the right price. However, we are not into giving it away.

534784,Bobby,2003-09-03 10:45:00,211,"After getting married Sunday we thought about a brief honeymoon before I head back to work and my wife heads back to University. We planned to go to Minaki for a night or two and, later this winter, go for a real honeymoon. We called the other night and Minaki Lodge told us they would have lots of rooms. Accordingly, I didn't bother to reserve yet and told my wife we would book the morning we would leave. Well, we left for Minaki Lodge yesterday morning and couldn't get through on the phone. After getting about 20 minutes down the road, I finally connected with someone. They advised they were closed for the day. I couldn't understand how that would be so I asked the person to clarify. I was told as well that they didn't know when it would reopen! I asked for a time frame and was told not for a VERY long time. It was then that it clicked in - Minaki Lodge is closed down yet again. We quickly turned around and headed for home. Good thing, I suppose, as we'll save our money for a real honeymoon. Besides, I've ALWAYS said that the fishing here at home in Manitoba is WAAAY better!!! Here's a newspaper story for your curiosity...http://www.canoe.ca/WinnipegNews/ws.ws-09-03-0005.html ""Hold on to the boat, boys, she's gonna ram us!"""
534785,woods,2003-09-03 12:05:00,646,Pretty sad. Some in our fishing group looked at the condos this summer. We thought they might make it this time. Hate to see such a pretty place close again.
534790,Guest,2003-09-03 13:39:00,0,I wonder what the Vegas Odds are on the lodge really reopening in May of 04 as the news article quoted someone? And who in their right mind would book there after this little episode. Someone needs to show those clowns how to run a business.
534796,Reels,2003-09-03 15:40:00,2876,"I only know this from what Paridise Cove personel told me. Earlier in the year, the owner fired the managers due to things being slow. I suspect this might be what happened to RMTG. Rob, please correct me if I am wrong. This was two weeks ago. He was hated by alot of people that changed their lives to have a job at the lodge. Minaki almost had a pulse again. Too bad that it comes down to money with no respect for peoples livelyhood. No wonder people rioted at the lodge. There has to be a lot of anger there. <{{}}><"
534797,Vitreum,2003-09-03 16:04:00,221,"sounds lika a nice place, but you have to put a lot of butts in boats to retire a $8 million debt. i cannot see how it can be done. i just loved this quote from the piece in the paper ""Wharram said he gave the guests notice Monday morning that they would be asked to leave that day. Wharram said none were upset."" now, i know that if i had driven 12-16 hours and were told to get out after 1-2 days, i wouldn't be upset. i'll bet that some of the guests were rioting too. this is really a bush league operator and he can reorganize all he wants. some people will never be back."
534798,Reels,2003-09-03 16:14:00,2876,The place was hopping the last week despite the fire. We stopped at Dockside and had Martini's and the cooks were wearing chef hats. Alot of upscale people there from Winnepeg I suspect. Lots of families. Looked very nice. I Even hacked away at the nine hole golf coarse.

534803,Vitreum,2003-09-03 17:52:00,221,"when big boys ""reorganize"", it usually means that little guys get screwed. that's the way it happens here in the states; probably canada also. all of their vendors are probably going to get stuck holding the empty bag. i would guess that the abrupt closing was as a result of vendors cutting them off because they weren't paying their earlier bills. that's the way it generally happens. big guys skate--little guys get screwed."
534804,River_eye,2003-09-03 17:54:00,1486,"I was hired there as a guide this spring, and worked a month with no guiding days before I decided to get the #### out. Luckily I found a better guiding job elsewhere. The manager is a very smart and hardworking man, but I think it would have taken sombody with the powers of super man to get the place running. Having worked in the fishing lodge business for 6 years, I can tell you that Minaki was not trying to be one. There was only one guy on the whole management team that had fishing resort experience and he was given virtually no power. The target marketing group were Canadians, and we all know that Canadian customers do not make fishing lodges run. Minaki has been run as a ""wilderness resort"" but there's just not enough of a market for that, you can't really blame the managers, it's the people that built the place that screwed up, I think. I can tell you one thing though, the place that I'm at right now is a very high profile successfull fishing resort and they got that way by treating their guides well and in turn they have a guiding staff of exceptional quality. The top management at Minaki treated me like I was no more important than the guy who cleaned the washrooms and that I should be happy just to have a job there, even if it was six days of maintainance work to every guiding day. Oh well."
