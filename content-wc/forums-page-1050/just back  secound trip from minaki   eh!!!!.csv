It come from the north east one day then the south the next, then north again. It made for some tough fishing and the high temps were no higher than 40 to 45. The waves were 2 to 3 footers everyday. We found some walleyes in 60 to 70 feet. one guy in are group used his down rigger and got 8 nice fish around 5 lbs each. The northern fishing was good. The biggest was 39.5 many fish 5 to 10 lbs. The muskies were moving we had a lot of lookers but only 3 taker. In all I would say it was a ok week, but very cold with snow a little on wen. Well till next year. thanks bill"
