509866,dlhomes,2000-09-23 09:58:00,62,I am heading up on 10/5 for a short trip to close up the cabin. Has anybody got any info on the grouse hunting? Lots of birds this year? I won't have time to fish- and it's killing me so I thought I might do some ground swatting instead. Have any of the regs. for bringing a gun across changed since last year? Any info would be helpful. Thanks!!
