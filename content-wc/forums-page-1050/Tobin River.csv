509849,Guest,2000-09-21 10:16:00,0,I am wondering if anyone has heard if the fishing has pick up yet. I am leaving for the river Sept 30th just after the Vanity Cup. I am also wondering about Leeches. Has anyone been able to find good leeches in Nipawin or the surounding areas.

Also did catch a dozen or so 2-3 pders. I don't think you need to bother with the leaches though. I think the leach bite is all but over. They pulled reaf runners in all colors, and thundersticks in 16-20 ft. tight lineschadps. use good and heavy lines. they had several big fish break off, probably just northerns, but would be fun. You never know what you can catch there or how big."
