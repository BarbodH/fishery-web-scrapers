509742,Ron,2000-09-19 22:16:00,387,I don't know if this helps: <#####://www.fishontario.com/best-spots/index.html> I go to Nippising in the winter a few times a year to fish the EYES through the ice. We seem to have our best luck by the Manitou Islands. Keep in mind the biggest walleye we have caught there is about 4 - 4 1/2 lbs. Good luck on your trip. . Tight lines Ron.

In 30 - 50 feet of water or so.Vertical jigging and casting jigs. Pretty heavy jigs - 3/8 to about 1/2 oz, white or chartreuse - tipped with minnows. Consider a ML spinning outfit, 6 - 6 1/2 ft, equipped with 6 - 8 lb line. ""Bites"" are light as a Love-Bird's peck on the cheek, so line watching is in order. XT Solar line works well.Tight lines,Ed."
509744,Guest,2000-09-21 10:07:00,0,"I have been fishing the west arm of lake nippising for about 6 years in october and we have almost always used lead jigs and minnows, like another post said the hits are very weak, you have to have a lot of attention to your rod and feel, we have hauled out many when boats beside us catch nothing on the same tackle and bait, use fairly small minnows, we have never had luck on large minnows. Watch the new rules for size up there(imposed last year) cannot remember what they are of hand. Our biggest catches are 8 pound, ten pound. Good luck!"
