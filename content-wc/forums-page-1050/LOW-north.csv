509824,Guest,2000-09-18 22:25:00,0,Has anybody been fishing the north end of LOW lately? I haven't been out for 3 weeks. Fishing for walleyes was still great then as was the whole summer. I am going back this week-end 23/08 and was wondering if anyone had any info on this area. I'm talking Keewatin Channel to Scotties Island area. Thanks
