509818,Guest,2000-09-18 07:46:00,0,"Just got back from fishing lake Tobin last week. Have seen many people lately asking about it so I thought I'd share our experience.Fished Tobin on Friday September 8th. Hired Curtis Lockwood from Twin Marine as our guide (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!). We fished from 8:00am to 5:00pm and the weather was 65 degrees and sunny. Had 6 guys in our group plus Curtis. We caught one 10lb walleye and one 8 lb walleye between us. The other fish were surprisingly very small. Most of the fish we caught were 10-12 inches in length. We probably caught 30 in this range. We kept 7 fish that were 15-17 inches. We used mostly used leaches and tried plugs for a while.Twin Marine was very hospitable and their service was great. Curtis thought the big fish bite would be better end of September, but there is a big walleye tournament there at that time with a $50k (Can) 1st prize.Let me know if you have any other questions.ChuckPS - yes, we released both of the big fish!"
509819,Guest,2000-09-18 16:43:00,0,How did they taste? I have heard that Tobin is polluted.
509822,Guest,2000-09-18 16:49:00,0,sounds like you caught a few.What were they biting on? Did the big ones bite leeches or the plugs? How much for the guide? thanks for the info
509820,Guest,2000-09-19 11:47:00,0,"tasted fine, never heard of Tobin being polluted."
509823,Guest,2000-09-19 11:55:00,0,Caught all but one of our keepers on a lindy-rig with a leech. One 15 inch walleye while trolling a shad rap. Both large fish were on the leeches. Curtis' fees were $285 Cananadian for 8 hours (about $200 US). That included 3 guys in his boat (he did not fish) and our other boat tagged along with 3 others in it. Ate breakfast and lunch at his bait shop which was extra. Hope this is helpful.Chuck
