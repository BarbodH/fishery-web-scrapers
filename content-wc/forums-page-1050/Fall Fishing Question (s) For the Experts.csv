We would be approximately 100 miles north of Ottawa, app. 80 miles northeast of the Maniwaki, at a lodge off the Clova Road. We have fished this lake successfully for six years albeit in June each year. The lodge owner has told us that September walley fishing is tough but we wonder if they simply don't have much experience with fishing that time of year as their clientele is likely moose hunters? Any insight on this (yes/no?, depths/structure to target, etc.) from you experts would be greatly appreciated!! We would love to go if it would be worth time and money. Thx in advance."

I'm not at all familiar with the lake you mentioned but my experiance has been that fishing is just great that time of year. It's the best time I can think of for laying into a wall hanger. The only thing that I could think of is that perhaps there might be a migration out of the lake to another lake, river, whatever.Fishing is never a sure thing all the time that's what makes it so much fun. The pattern that I look for in fall is deep reefs. Be prepared to go looking 3 times deeper than where you found them in June. In early spring we fish as little as 2 feet of water. In fall we are looking at 22 to 35 feet. The bait of choice is usually a good sized chub although I'm sure there are fish out there that will make a lier out of me.My two cents worth. Let me know how you made out and I'll do the same."
509667,Guest,2000-09-14 20:06:00,0,I go up in that area quite often and had good luck around the end of August. We fished the river from shore using jigs. Hope this helps.
509666,GregK,2000-09-18 12:33:00,113,Well just about the time you figure you have it all down pat - Went up to Ontario the last two weeks and fishing was just great. Any other time we get our fish in 20 to 25 feet of water. This year they showed up in 4 to 9 feet. I think this is because the whole summer was cool and rainey causing the water to never really warm up.In any case we used 63 dozen minnows between the three of us over two weeks. That kind of says it all. Most important was that the fish were coming out in the 3 to 4 pound range like a cookie cutter. We had some smaller eaters for shore lunch and the rest went back. I thank God every day for letting me experiance this place.
509668,Guest,2000-09-19 23:32:00,0,"I go on my fall trip every year by timmins which is in the same area as your going.I use the same bait i use in the spring up there ,the only differance is my jigs are bigger , the plastic grubs are bigger and the water is deeper.im out the door in 2 days for 2 weeks, burrrr the tents will be cold . hope this is helpfull good luck"
509669,Guest,2000-09-23 12:09:00,0,"Bruce: Could you share the name of the lake and lodge you are referring to and your experience catching walleyes there in June.As for September fishing, our group just returned from 4 days in Lake Ogascanan, Quebec (13-17 Sept). The lake holds walleyes, lake trout and pike and is located 60 miles Northeast of Temiscaming, Quebec. All marked fish were between 35 and 60 feet. Eight guys caught 14 walleyes and 2 lake trout. However, we were weathered out - no thunderstorms but overcast, cold (45 F), high winds and waves (3-4 feet) every day. It was our first trip into this lake and it would be unfair to rate this lake under the conditions we experienced. Jay"
