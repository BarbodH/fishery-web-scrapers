509804,Terry,2000-09-14 22:30:00,63,"Where are you looking to fish? Manitoba has 100,000 lakes and Ontario has even more. The majority of these are free. Huge number are drive to lakes not fly-in. Where are you finding the leased lakes?"

Many of the other lakes around are owned/leased by outfitters. I was trying to find some areas where a guy could go in, camp and fish without the expense of the outfitters or the parks."
