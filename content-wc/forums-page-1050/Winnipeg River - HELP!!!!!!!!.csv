509781,iamwalleye1,2000-09-14 15:25:00,1589,"hello haasI am leaving in the morning for 8 days. I will be staying @ barbers . It is in gun lake, a little north of where you are going. I was up two weeks ago and we killed em, they almost were jumping in the boat . I use spinners almost all the time. They seem to work the best. copper blades with gren beeds, or char. good luck I will post how we do when I return. CPR THANKS BILL"

Several 30"" fish in 2 days with a mess of nice fish to keep you busy. Wind has pushed the fish in the river and some were out farther on bars, but rough going in the open they said!I may hear more from them tonight.Backwater Eddy.............><,,>"
509783,Guest,2000-09-20 14:28:00,0,Did you hear more from your friends on the Winnipeg river? Any other tips would be great - We will heading up from Chicago on the 23rd.

The current in strong but fishing was good for the boys last weekend and it should be great when you get there. Sounds a bit cold, dress warm!Hot colers in jigs were the best. That is about all I heard.BE........><,,>"
