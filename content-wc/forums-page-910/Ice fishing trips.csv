Contact the Perch Patrol Guide Service and you can get details. www.perchpatrol.net/express.htmPerch Patrol Guide Service1223 14th Street West Lot 48Devils Lake, ND 58301(701) DL1-FISHor (701) 351-3474This season the sumo perch, walleye, and the pike bite at DL has been better then the last few years. Historical February and March will see some of the best SUMO perch action.I guide, but not up on DL. I just know those boys do a good job and have a wide network of guides who know where the fish are on or not on the bite.Johnnie Candle would be another great one to hook up with if he is not on the road going Pro-Mo stuff.Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson...><sUMo>"
