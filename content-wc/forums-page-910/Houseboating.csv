526224,Guest,2003-01-04 22:06:00,0,My friends and myself are considering a houseboat trip next summer to either LOTW or Rainy Lake. We are interested in a boat that will accomodate 6 to 8 men comfortably. Can anyone recommend a vendor that may accomodate our needs? Could you also state how you liked your houseboating and fishing expereince. Thanks.

You might want to look into a resort instead. Not to sure how things are going out there.

I do have several guy's I work with at St. Croix Rods that have done HB trips and they all had great experiences. The one big recommendation they had for me was not to crap in the toilet on the HB if you don't have to. Apparently it gets a bit stinky as the week goes on. Hope it works out for ya.Jason B.St. Croix Rods"

A 52' boat will hold 9 guys (nine bunks). Some of the bunks are double but we prefer not to double up."
