If, you truly believe that there IS a gun problem and then want to FIX that problem. I am reminded about a statement that Author, Tom Clancy made when pointing out the illogical position that the Anti-Nuclear lobby was making when they thought the nuclear problem would be fixed if they could just reduce the Nukes in 1/2.Paraphrasing Clancy; If I take my Beretta 9mm with a full 12 shot clip and stick it into your chest, you would feel threatened. Now, if I take out 6 bullets from that clip and then stick the same gun back into your chest, do you feel any safer? If I pull the trigger, you're still dead.If the Anti's want to feel totally safe, they will ""have"" to take away all guns. Which I believe is their end game, ultimately.Ivy"
