525775,Guest,2002-12-17 06:16:00,0,"I have been coming north to Golden Hook Camp for 32 years, first as a teenager, now with my teenagers. We make two trips a year, a guys trip in the Spring and one with the entire family, usually in August. The walleye and northern fishing are second to none any time of the year.The facilities are fantastic and getting better each year, as improvements are constantly being made (the girls love it!). The owners (Bill and Maureen) are wonderful hosts and extremely helpful to those visiting Gullrock Lake for the first time.People ask me why I keep coming back to the same place every year. I have had 32 years to consider other places. The combination of the wonderful facilities, friendly owners, the beauty of ""Sunset Country"", and the best walleye fishing I have found in North America make the decision an easy one."
525776,Thumper,2003-01-06 13:11:00,133,"Gull Rock lake is great. I've stayed at McEwen's Northern Shore camp on Two Island lake, jsut a half-mile via the Chakuni river. Always over Memorial Day week.The South bay of Gull Rock, where Golden Hook is, has a clay bank on the North sore that always seems loaded with eatin' sized walleye. There's always some 'eyes sitting off some of the islands on the SE side of the main lake, too. We catch tons in Ranger lake as soon as it opens (it's a spawning protected area). The water is very stained, I call it black. I found it very eerie the first time I saw it. You can't see 1 foot below the boat. Chartreuse jigs for 'eyes and Black/Silver F18 Rapalas for Northerns.In the middle of the North half of the lake is a submerged granite ""table"" that is usually 1 or 2 inches below the water. It can be very hard to see unless there are Seagulls standing on it (thus the name: Gull Rock). It's a pretty long piece of granite.Have a lot of fun up there! The fishing's great and the resort owners are WONDERFUL!- Rick"
525777,Guest,2003-01-06 22:43:00,0,"We have been going up to Goldenhook for 3 years, prior that we had been fishing Packwash/Bruce for nearly 25 years. The fishing is much/much better on the Gullrock chain. Our crew focuses more on the Pike, and we have done pretty well. This past June I released a 44'+, a 38, a 35, and a 32 incher.(go check out my pic on their site! I am wearing the green raincoat and have a young guy standing behind me) And the fishing off the docks at sunset is great too. Just toss out a crawler, or a cisco and you'll catch nice walleyes till you get sick of the mosquitos!The cabins are nice, the central shower/bathrooms are well kept also. I would recommend it."
525763,Goldfish,2002-12-06 17:42:00,6,I am planning a trip to Golden Hook on Gullrock.I plan a spring trip in late June with my wife and a fall trip with the guys.Anyone stayed at Golden Hook? Is the fishing good?
525764,Guest,2002-12-07 08:14:00,0,"I have never stayed at Golden Hook, but have fished Gullrock for 14 years. I stay at Weavers. I normally go the last week in June or first of August. Walleye fishing is great."
525766,Guest,2002-12-07 12:00:00,0,My buddies and I have fished at Golden Hook Camp over the past few years at different times of the season and the fishing has always been great! The camp itself has also changed over the past years as the owners have really done a lot of improvements with a new shower house and beautiful new cabins. My wife really enjoys the modern facilities they have also. Hope you have a great time!
525767,Guest,2002-12-07 21:50:00,0,"Have been fishing Gull Rock for aprox 20 years both in the spring and fall. Each is a bit different in presentations and locations. Spring fishing can be excellent in the bay of Golden Hook Camp although by late June the majority of the fish may have moved into the main lake. Up in Ranger Bay may also be excellent as well as the clay banks. The fall fishing will involve finding active fish as they will be scattered all over the lake. There are numerous areas which year in and year out tend to draw the most fish although every year we always seem to find two or three new spots. Bill at Golden Hook will be glad to help you he is very helpful with lots of good advice. You will like Gull Rock as it is a very fishable lake. In bad weather one can fish around the many islands and in good weather just look for where the boats are congreated.Golden Hook Camp is very nice. Excellent cabins, good location. The sunsets are beautiful. Don't forget your camera. Get a panaramic one as well. Beautiful as it is don't forget that you are in a wilderness setting. Be respectful and careful. Enjoy!!!"
525768,Guest,2002-12-08 09:30:00,0,I have fished Gullrock for 25 years. Golden Hook Camp keeps improving .The fishin good any time that I have been there. Great place to fish.
525769,Guest,2002-12-08 18:04:00,0,"I've been fishing Gullrock for 38 years, mainly in the month of June. The Walleye fishing has always been excellent. We have stayed at what is now called Golden Hook Camp most of the years. The current owners have had it approximately 10 years and have done an excellent job upgrading the camp. The facilities are clean and well maintained. If you like to Walleye fish, you should do well there!"
525765,Guest,2002-12-09 08:10:00,0,"For anyone planning A trip to Golden Hook Camp next season, just a note that I spent a week at Golden Hook last August and found it very enjoyable. The cabins are phenomenal and I found the owners very helpful. The fishing is as good as you'll find anywhere with trophy size northern and walleye. The owners have built new cabins and a shower/Laundry facility. If your planning a trip to the Northwest, this is as good a camp as you will find anywhere."

525771,Guest,2002-12-11 08:24:00,0,We have fished in June for 20-22 years and have stayed at Golden Hook each year. The fishing is great. The people who own the camp are really good people to know and stay with. We have never fished in the fall. Hope you have a great time. We will this coming June.
