526199,GLO,2003-01-02 15:52:00,318,"Want to go north with wife and kids, two daughters ages 10 and 6, not ready for wilderness camping, probably not ready for 5 days of nothing but fishing. Any suggestions on some ""compromise"" type lodges with good fishing, but maybe some extras? Gunflint Lodge in BWCA looks great but one night there costs about the same as one week at some pretty nice fishing only lodges further north on better lakes. Looking for walleyes, of course, but some northern also. Thanks, trying to focus on Ontario, have exhausted the various web sites, checking here hoping for some more specific information or personal experiences. GLO"

Check out www.AspenMN.com or www.norwaypoint.com. Looked like a great place for kids, fishing is mostly panfish and smallmouth from what I've heard, but there are decent walleye lakes in the area. Good Luck"
526201,Guest,2003-01-02 20:37:00,0,"Your situtation reminds me of my brother, sister-in-law, and three of their daughters trip 5 or 6 years ago. They went to Camp Wenasaga on Lake Wenasaga-about an eight mile lake fed by the Wenasaga River and empties into Lac Seul. They rent out for 6 days, provide a boat with a 15 HP electric start motor and supply a couple dozen minnows a day. You need to email or call for current family rates. (I think they are comparable to other resorts offering the same amenities.) This is a housekeeping resort and the only one on the lake. Ear Falls is 10 to 15 miles away. You can do your laundry, go to the library, get a Pizza.Walleyes were many-not too large-but were easily caught still fishing with minnows by my then youngest niece, age 10. (You can go through a lot of bait fishing for Walleyes. Another party from Iowa went through 100 dozen nightcrawlers during their stay.) If you feel rich enough you could fly in and fish or just have a pilot take you up for a short flight. I'm guessing a short flight would cost $100 to $150. If you feel like walking there are lakes near Wenasaga that you can walk into and use boats and motors supplied by the resort owner. I don't know what the charge is for the use of the equipment on other lakes."

As a matter of fact my brother and nieces often read in the boat. Helps pass the time if you are tired of fishing or if the fishing is slow."
526203,Guest,2003-01-03 07:45:00,0,If you are interested in family fun mixed in with fishing excitement for walleye and northern action try either of these two places at ear Falls: Goldpines camp - they have camping sites as well as house keeping cabins; or Evergreen lodge - they also have the American plan.
526204,bbakes,2003-01-03 07:57:00,121,"GLO,Gunflint Lodge is very nice, I have guided for them in the past. If the price concerns you try Gunflint Pines Resort just down the road. gunflintpines.com ( I must disclaim that my brother owns this place and I guide for him now!) Same lakes and activities, lower prices. Both of these lodges offer a lot for your family. I would suggest for both yourself and your family to try the following. At least a couple of days of guided fishing on Saganaga,horseback riding, swimming on one of the sand beaches, renting a pontoon with the whole family, hiking, and whatever else keeps your family happy. If you have any specific questions, I would be glad to help."
526205,Guest,2003-01-03 13:14:00,0,Try Buena Vista on Lake of the Woods. There's no pool but the kids swim off the dock all day and Lake of the Woods is a great fishing lake. There's a very good dinning room - no cooking for your wife. Look at buenavistaresort.com
526206,Vitreum,2003-01-03 15:42:00,221,"in my opinion, you need to stay near a town so the girls can go in and get away from the fishing for a while. lac seul will give you and the girls an opportunity to get lots and lots of fish. try the ear falls area. pretty nice little town and great wilderness fishing nearby. some of the local resorts (don't remember which ones) have sand beaches for swimming and sun bathing. many have family discount packages. i would also suggest the july-august timeframe. most likely to have good stable weather during that period. remember, you only have one shot at this to get this right. if they have fun and get hooked on fishing, you can pull this scam on them over and over and get to go fishing under the guise of having a family vacation. my first try at pulling this about 25 years ago went badly and i have never been able to get her back. good luck."
526207,Guest,2003-01-08 00:13:00,0,Try Buena Vista Resort on Lake of the Woods. The website is buenavistaresort.com
