Accomodations don't need to be fancy, just comfortable so the better half can be OK with it. A place where a guy can catch numbers would be best, with the opportunity to yank a big one. Also, not looking to pull a ""Lewis and Clark"" in order to get to the fishing. I know Lake of the Woods has some great Laker fishing, but I haven't a clue where to go. Would like to go on someones reference, not a blind shot in the dark. Thanks, and a HAPPY NEW YEAR to all!"
526112,dlhomes,2002-12-28 06:47:00,62,I beleive season opens Jan. 1 on LOTW at Siuox Narrows. It's approx. 1.5-2 hrs north of International Falls. There are a few camps open all year and a motel in town. I beleive they fish them just east of the bridge in town and also in Whitefish bay. Easy to find a spot just pull up to an area where someone else has been. Fish are generally shallow and easy to catch!??Thats why you can't use live bait or barbs! Good luck.
526113,eyewitness,2002-12-28 09:06:00,680,Since when can't you use live bait or barbs in Ontario? Never heard that one before. Is that strictly for fishing lakers?
526115,Thumper,2002-12-28 13:08:00,133,Browns Clearwater West. Near Atikokan. Good fishing and accomodations. I've fished there and we did well.
526116,walleyedude,2002-12-28 20:05:00,34,"Crow lake,AKA Kakagi lake between Nestor Falls and Sioux Narrows, has some of the best laker fishing that is road accessible.The barbless/no live bait retrictions on LOTW do not apply here.I stay at a friend,s place in Sioux,but I have heard good things about Allen's Resort on the lake.But if you want to try something really different,head to the North shore of Lake Superior,between Thunder Bay and Nipigon.I grew up in T.Bay and we have caught plenty of big lakers,as well as whities and coasters, in Silver Harbour,Cloud bay,Little Trout bay and Nipgon Bay.There are a lot of inland lakes in the area as well,loaded with lakers, splake and speckled trout.Good luck!"

I believe from Regina west thru Whitefish Bay- no live bait no barbs!(only certain time of year)We learned the hard way- set up tip ups for eyes in Whitefish and found out from a MNR guy doing a creel survey. Made it hard to locate eyes but I guess lakers are too easy to get this time of year!??
