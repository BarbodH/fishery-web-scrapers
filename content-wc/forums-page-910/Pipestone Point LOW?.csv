Can someone give me some pointer on the musky action we will be there the week of july 19 2003, I have fished Minaki for years and this will be a fish on LOW. Alos if you have any info on th resort would be nice. You can email if you want [email protected]"

They post reports on a weekly basis during the season, so you'll have the most up-to-the-minute news on what's going on. Have a blast! LOW is an incredible place to fish. Lunk"
526220,Guest,2003-01-05 10:11:00,0,"Actually,You would do well to change your trip to Witch Bay. They are about 6-8 miles away from Pipestone by water. There is a fishing staff there that puts you on Muskies for free. It's your choice to fish with them or have them mark your map. Pipestone has a nice bar but that is the only advantage. Witch Bay has better docking, cabins with AC, service at the dock,...Good luck,Mike"
526221,Guest,2003-01-05 12:29:00,0,Only problem with Witch Bay is they NEVER have a slow down in fishing- read their reports! Would like a more accurate report!? Have never been there but does sound like a good place!!!!
526222,Lunker,2003-01-06 11:36:00,27,"Well, two things, dl. One, it's not Witch Bay that never has a slow-down. LOW simply offers a fabulous fishery; it's a consensus opinion, regardless of WHO you bunk with. This is not, however, to say that one's success doesn't take a hit every now and then just like on every other body of water - cold fronts, changing water levels, mayfly hatches, etc. But secondly, as Mike notes, they have a fishing program staffed by knowledgable pros that'll help you figure out the bite a lot faster, whatever species you target... and it's all included in your base price. I can attest to the fact that the fishing reports, even tho they sound too good to be true, are accurate. After all, why would Witch Bay, or any other place for that matter, take the chance of blowing smoke and being found out only to ruin hard work (and expense)at establishing a reputation? And as for iamwalleye, or anyone else for that matter, consider taking a brief run down to Witch Bay while you're up there and look the place over. After all, you can fish all the way there and back. Have fun. Lunk"
