Or have any comments on Viking Outposts?-T"
526266,Guest,2003-01-06 14:25:00,0,"i have been to Telescope two times. Never been to Optic. Telescope is a clear lake with walleye, northern and lake trout. Hugh and Craig are very nice to deal with. They check on you every couple of days. They will fly in beer when ever you want and give you ice each time they fly in. We had good luck both times at Telecope with most luck coming at the portage lake (Georges). If you have any questions e-mail me.Good LuckGary"
526267,Thumper,2003-01-06 20:41:00,133,"Good to hear that, Gary. Optic is just a bit downstream (West) from Telescope. According to Viking's literature they share the same clear water.I met Rosie and Craig 1-1/2 years ago on another trip to to the Red Lake area. They both seemed like great people.I've got lots of questions, if you've got the patience for them! :)What time of year were you there?This seems like a kind of gateway to the park. Did you ever get any canoers or kayakers passing though? I can see by looking at the maps that this chain of lakes is connected by a seriese of portages. I wonder if it's as busy as the BWCA can get in some places.Was George lake a clear water lake, too? I'm kind of concerned about fishing the clear water. I've never fished the clear water lakes, except for some trout when I was a kid (and didn't have any luck). Red Lake and it's downstream neighbors on the Chukuni River are darkly stained waters, and I've done pretty well there. I wonder what made George lake better than Telescope?Did you bring a water filter or purifier or anything?- ThumperSend me your e-mail address to [email protected] or leave it in the thread."
