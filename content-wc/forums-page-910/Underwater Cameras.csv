We set it up perfectly so we could put the rod in the holder and watch the screen. We could perfectly see the way the fish where reacting to our bait. We adjusted takle accordingly and caught more fish.I wanted to put the question out there. How do other anglers use an underwater viewing system? Setup's, tricks etc. Also how do other anglers feel about thses cameras? Pros, Cons..etc.?"
