525450,Rick,2002-11-15 09:29:00,226,"Was wondering if anyone had any info on whether FRS/GMRS radios are allowed in Canada? Is licensing similar to US, that is, no license for FRS and license req'd for GMRS? These are the small radios, Motorola Talkabout for example, that are handy for boat-cabin and boat-boat use fishing. Thanks."
525451,retire55,2002-11-15 14:22:00,1029,Rick:Identical in Canada. Jay
525452,Rick,2002-11-16 12:28:00,226,Thanks. I doubt that it matters much out in the bush on fly-ins but its nice to know its legal.
525453,Thumper,2003-01-06 13:39:00,133,"In 2000 Canada allowed FRS radio use. There are other stipulations regarding GMRS in Canada - I think it's supposed to only be for commercial use, but I'n not an expert.I DO know that Garmin delayed their RINO (GPS and Radio combo unit) partially to disable GMRS in their Canadian units, and that if using one of those units in Canada, you are strongly advised NOT to use the GRMS frequencies.BTW - the Rino 120 is a Great unit, for any one interested in a first hand opinion.-T"
525454,Rick,2003-01-07 07:16:00,226,"Thanks for the info.Regarding the Rino units, I was looking at getting a pair of those since I'll be taking my 11 yr.old son for the first time this year. Might be handy if he wanders off."
525455,Thumper,2003-01-07 08:13:00,133,"The Rhino's are great. They're a little bit thicker than a normal e-trex GPS, and about twice the size of a normal FRS/GMRS radio. If you disable WAAS, the GPS portion runs quite a while on the 3-AA batteries, all day plus most of the next. I suppose that that might be reduced depending on how much you use the radio.I have a Motorola Talk About and never liked the controls. The Rhino makes configuring simple - everything is like using MS-Windows or Apple Sys10, just point and click.Because of the great feature of beaming your position to your buddies, you can also play games with your Rhino 120 - though most of the games are splat-ball-esque where you run around and try to outposition your fellow players. There's an oportunity for future software upgrades to include more sedentary games that might appeal more to your kids.My critisisms of the Rhino 120s are: 1. click stick is a little too sensitive, takes some getting used to; 2. games could include more network options; the battery compartment is difficult to open with the clip stud attached in the back;3. MapSource Topo is one of the worst topo titles n the market (though that's not really a Rhno issue); 4. and even if you've got it set to vibrate alert/encrypted transmission, those annoying page-tones from other (non-Rhino 120) units can still chime in.Those are constructive critisisms. I still love my unit! :)- T"
525456,retire55,2003-01-07 12:36:00,1029,"Rick:I owe you an apology. My first response (my understanding at the time) to your post was in error. After I read Thumper's reply, I did some more research. Official information was difficult to find. Consequently, I emailed the appropriate government office and their response is copied below:""In Canada, FRS radios are legal and do not require licensing. However, GMRS radios cannot be used in Canada, with or without a license. Industry Canada's policy with respect to FRS radios was set out in Spectrum Policy document SP-462 MHz, which is available on the web at http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/pics/sf/sp462.pdf . You may place a reference to this document with the poster. Unfortunately, we have no document specifically addressing Industry Canada's policy on GMRS radios.Please contact me should you have any further questions.Sincerely,Michael TremblaySpectrum Engineering BranchIndustry Canada [email protected]I regret my error and any inconvenience caused. Jay"
525457,Boots,2003-01-07 14:37:00,19,I believe you must have a license in the USA if you use a GMRS radio.
525458,Rick,2003-01-09 06:56:00,226,Thanks for the research and the info. I haven't bought any radios yet but will get something before June. I'll probably stick with the FRS since the GMRS require license in the states and not allowed in Canada.
