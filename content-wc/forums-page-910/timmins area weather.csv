526212,Guest,2003-01-04 12:56:00,0,"We fished Gowgonda, 30 miles south of Timmins in mid Sept. this year. Had some rain every day. One day too cold and wet to fish. We had a great time, had every lake to ourselves. Caught more bass, eye and pike than we could eat. We plan to go back again next year, in spite of the weather."
