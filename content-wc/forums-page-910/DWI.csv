They know about everything there is to know about you, so if you do not BS them you generally do not get hastled. Know what you can and can't have with you, answer the questions directly, and honestly, and your in and out without a fuss.2002 was not nearly as bad as I suspected it would be. I had all my documentation handy and it was a snap. The border guards were easy enough to get along with and appeared to me to do their jobs well. Expect your campers and RVs to get a real hard look, they searched them all each time I was in line.Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson...><sUMo>""Backwater Guiding"""

525755,Guest,2002-12-11 15:31:00,0,"Did not even get asked about DWI this year. Had more trouble getting back into the states because we had some home-canned rainbow trout in a mason jar...unopened, that had not been ""exported"" out of the states..then ""imported"" into Canada..then ""exported"" back out of Canada.I told the (American) agent...""hey I have some saltines.. let's open the jar and eat it (a pint jar) and enjoy! That didn't fly."
525756,Thumper,2002-12-12 05:17:00,133,Some Canadian and American border guards and come to think of it...all countries are cut from the same bolt of cloth. They uphold their countries laws no matter how trivial. A small thing or a large infraction is all the same....do not pass go and do not collect $200.
525757,Finaddict,2002-12-14 08:03:00,136,I've got a question. Is it procedure for borders any borders to have access to peoples records. Is there some kind of world wide computer base that were on. I'm not trying to be funny I'm just puzzled and curios I suppose it does'nt violate right to privacy policies because your record is public. Just makes me wonder! Can Bin Laden pull up my record and see my speeding ticket???

525759,Guest,2003-01-06 15:35:00,0,This will be the last year i have to worry about crossing with an old dui....as next year will be over 10 yrs.
