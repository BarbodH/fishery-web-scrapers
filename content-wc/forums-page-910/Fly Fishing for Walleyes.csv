This is a pre-spawn situation, and it is strictly catch and release, as some biggies (females) are caught. The same technique could probably be fairly successful later in the year as the fish move into the shallows after dark.Good luckBill K"

526091,Cat Eye Outfitter,2002-12-27 15:12:00,9,"I find two patterns that I'll often turn to are either clousers or marabou streamers. Weighting options include bead chain in various sizes and color (nickel, brass) or weighting (lead) the streamer with a view to the water (eg. depth cover, structure) I'll be working. Colors will depend upon water clarity and local ""walleye"" preferences but generally I'll usually go with a darker pattern and a lighter pattern with materials tied in from light (bottom) to dark (top -- of course a clouser will require a reversal because of hook orientation)--- this is an idea that Stu shared with me that has been quite successful. Generally when fly fishing for walleye I'm using an intermediate sink line type II or III and leaders/tippet in fluorocarbon. Floating line can be effectiveduring the summer's mayfly hatch. Just a couple of ideas. Certainly if you have a view to the hatch or common forage in a body of water patterns becomes a bit easier to develop/perfect. Some of my favourite bodies of water to fly fish for walleye in Manitoba are: The Valley river (lake Dauphin), The Red river just below the locks at Lockport, the English river upstream from Grassy narrows I.R. up towards Ball Lake, Lake of the prairies in the Shell river (Spring), and up north two of my favorite areas are the Laurie River from Eager to Laurie lake as well as Reindeer lake (either Paskawchi bay or Whitesand bay). I'll have to admit that fly fishing for walleyes has cerainly raised the ""bar"" of challenge for me in certain waters, but any walleye caught any ""way"" is just plain enjoyment."

526092,Guest,2003-01-07 00:40:00,0,"Dahl 2 (Jeff?)it's all about finding conditions that concentrate the fish.flyfishing is inefficient at prospecting water.find a concentration of fish, and you know they can be caught on flies. pattern is not likely to be the issue. size/flash and depth will be the keys. fly fishing for walleyes has not become popular because walleyes are much more pelagic than bass or northern pike. use your spinning rod to zero in on a concentration of responsive eyes, and convince yourself to take a chance with the fly rod. be brave. good luck.bob"
