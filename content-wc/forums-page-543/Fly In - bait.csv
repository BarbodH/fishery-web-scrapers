1191944,LoDo,2010-04-21 15:17:00,721,I'm doing a fly in this July out of Ear Falls and headed to the Caribou Prov Park. The camp we are staying at doesn't provide minnows and we'll be freezing minnows and flying them in.Would you say 3-4 dozen per person per day is enough?
1192089,Bigfishhunter,2010-04-22 06:25:00,803,"All I have ever needed at any fly-in camp that I have been to is a 3"" twister tail, power bait or el cheapo, didn't matter, white, chartreuse, orange, etc. Bring the minnows for tough bites, but bring the gulp and power bait grubs."
1192094,Pooch,2010-04-22 06:40:00,4619,"Search frozen minnows or salted minnows on this website. Frozen minnows don't hold up all that well and shelf life out of the freezer doesn't exist. Freezing minnows without dehydrating them expands the moisture in them and they turn to mush when thawed. Lots of discussion on the subject offering alternative ways to preserve bait. Seems like I remember ""Twenty Mule Team Borox"" was an alternative for removing moisture and preserving them.If trip is in warm weather and if they are allowed in that area consider taking in live leeches. Easier to care for than most live bait. You can also buy preserved minnows from the Farm & Fleet type stores that are approved and labeled. Crawlers need to be kept cool.Good luck and have great trip.Pooch"

1192160,SSH,2010-04-22 10:06:00,526,"For the guys in our group that need the confidence of some meat on their jigs, we salt/sugar minnows that we purchase in bulk (either half or full gallon). Just put 1/3 cup salt and 1/3 cup sugar in quart ziplock along with 1 1/2 cups of minnows. Close ziplock and shake to mix the salt and sugar around in the ziplock. Then, freeze them. Then, take a bag or two each outing. These work well when trolling spinner rigs, too.The sugar helps minimize the salt's drying of the hands. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...c/progress.gif"
1192207,LoDo,2010-04-22 12:34:00,721,"I should've been more specific. We'll be using salt, sugar, borax, etc.. to keep the minnows from turning to mush. I just figured I'd ask how many minnows will a guy go through day to day. My guess was 3-4 doz.Thanks everyone,"
