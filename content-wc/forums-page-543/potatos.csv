1192137,davenathe,2010-04-22 08:21:00,113,"We would also have to stop at grocery stop once we got to Canada as usually forgot something and spuds would be on the list. Trying to keep carbs out of my diet as it seems to be the only way I can maintain or lose weight!!! But note when on Canadian fishing trip, fried spuds and fish are the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1192146,PRD1,2010-04-22 09:04:00,458,"Thanks a lot, I will be shopping for our trip next week!"
1192192,Pakwash Lake Camp,2010-04-22 11:52:00,17,I wonder if the custom reps were tired of eating all the potatoes they stockpiled all the years past? Good to hear they changed something to make it easier to come to Canada.
1192285,brwhite,2010-04-22 17:57:00,41,Can onions be brought across?Is that 10lbs per car? per person? per group?
1192376,Bill Krejca,2010-04-23 05:57:00,6107,"Probably 10 pounds per person, and then you'll just have to buy the rest you'll need for the week up there! Bill Krejca"
1192842,JDP,2010-04-24 16:17:00,1457,Has anyone seen an announcement from the Government?Thanks.
1192866,Pakwash Lake Camp,2010-04-24 17:59:00,17,http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/...pome.shtml#dirI couldn't make much of it so I called and they also confirmed 10 lbs of packaged potatoes are allowed.
1192046,Rayburn36,2010-04-21 21:35:00,17,not sure if anyone cares... went thru canadian customs today and they allow potatos into the country woo hoo!!
1192051,bpetersen,2010-04-21 21:54:00,251,"Amazing, I wonder why they are allowing them? Our dirt isn't any cleaner."
1192052,bpetersen,2010-04-21 22:10:00,251,Maybe you just got lucky. I just went to the Canadian Government website on travel and it said potatoes are still prohibited. Where did you cross? Maybe we will have others try taking some across and will report back.
1192057,Nimstug,2010-04-21 23:01:00,2605,Did they ask if you had whole spuds and how did you respond?
1192067,Rayburn36,2010-04-22 03:59:00,17,crossed in fort frances yesterday. had groceries told them I had no potatoes officer said the were OK to bring across now
1192091,v-bay gord,2010-04-22 06:34:00,3168,I was also told by a border official at the Fort Francis crossing that potatoes were once again allowed. They need to be commercially packaged.
1192099,troutaholic,2010-04-22 06:57:00,827,"My canadian friends will be very happy!!! I can trade homegrown potatoes pound-for-pound for fish fillets!!! They love the Kennebec's and Carola's that I grow. Of course, a shore lunch with fingerling potaotes is out of this world......they are usually gone before the 'eye fillets!!!!"
1192105,PRD1,2010-04-22 07:06:00,458,"That is interesting, as another post mentioned the Canadian Border Services Agency still has this on their web site: Food Products Canada has complex requirements, restrictions and limits on the importation of meat, eggs, dairy products, honey, fresh fruits and vegetables, and other food from around the world. For example, the importation of root crops may be regulated and that of potatoes is prohibited. You can avoid problems by not bringing these kinds of goods into Canada.http://cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/...eng.html#s2x12"
1192112,PRD1,2010-04-22 07:19:00,458,It appears the potato restriction may now be limited to British Columbia based on other info found on the Border Services web site?
1192118,retire55,2010-04-22 07:34:00,1029,I telephoned the the toll free number for Eastern Canada 1-877-493-0468 this morning and verified that up to 4 kilograms (10 pounds) of commercially packaged potatoes can be taken into Canada for personal use. Loose potatoes in a paper bag could still be rejected.
