1190905,tackleman,2010-04-18 15:39:00,444,"there's no fish below the ear falls dam but i've been told there are fish directly downstream it in the water that flows out of it. Come on Bud, you still got red lake to fish out, then gullrock, let ear falls have some fun tooIf you give me a call, i'll show you where they are on gullrocklet us know when you're coming up, gullrock is open and ready to fish. (opened april 16)"
1190925,Guest,2010-04-18 16:57:00,0,"Well Tackleman, I heard you fished out Gullrock years ago and you know the walleyes are small and got worms there haha!! I'll just sit on my dock in Mcbay and catch all the eyes I want. Buuut if you want to buy my map with all the hot spot on Gullrock I'm auctioning it off on ebay. got a friend who's going to be fishing the English river down stream from the dam and was looking for some input"
1191022,Moondog,2010-04-18 20:29:00,362,I thought Gull Rock was closed until May 15th?
1191047,tackleman,2010-04-18 22:04:00,444,"oh yea, it's closed for walleye but the big pike should be spawning now and they are open year round. may 15 is the walleye start date."

We would fish Lac Seul during the day and after supper we would put the boat in the river and fish there for a few hours. If the water was rushing through the dam, the fishing was quite good. We would anchor up near the ropes and catch numerous walleyes, and usually pretty good size. In fact, the two years we did that, our biggest walleyes of the trip came from below the dam. This was in mid-June."
