1189689,youngcanadianguide,2010-04-14 19:18:00,60,"Hi Everyone,I know it's been a while since my last post, but my mother hemorrhaged her vocal cord. NO it wasn't after yelling at me, my brother or my dad. The Dr. in Timmins said that it was from lack of rest and long hours. My dad says my mom is the women in charge. I can tell you that both my mom and dad work long and hard trying to make sure everyone is having good time. Since my mom wasn't able to talk I stepped up to the plate and was helping more with the camp for my parents. It was a lot of fun helping with the bear baiting and hunts with my dad. Also, I pick up more guiding jobs so my dad could spend more time at the camp answering the phone for mom. My Mom went through a lot of paper writing notes to us and the guest at the camp. The funniest thing the Dr. said to my dad at the office was that in time he would learn some sign language that could make him mad. My mom voice is back after some speech therapy, but it is still weak and when she get tired she starts to loose her voice again.School went great and so did basketball this year. It's nice to be back with my friends but I'm looking soooo forward in getting back on the water. This year my parents bought me a nice fly rod. My goal this year is to learn to catch whitefish, pike and bass on a fly rod. It looks like we'll be leaving in less than 2 weeks for the camp. So I look forward to posting about the fishing and the weather in our area once we get up north. Our season is looking very good this year; we have only 6 openings out of 190 available this year. So looks good for me keeping busy for the season this year.Youngcanadianguide"
1189712,Rich B,2010-04-14 20:00:00,1081,That's good news that your Mom will be OK.....doc was funny about the sign language (ha). Keep the posts coming this Spring and summer....you do a nice job providing good info. All the best to you and your family for the upcoming season. Rich B

Instead of yelling, your mom will be whispering for you to clean the fish house.I bet you have no problem getting a couple of your friends to visit you for a week or so during the season.You'll soon be answering questions about water temperature, lure selection and bug status.Have a great year."
1189903,Fishing Traveler,2010-04-15 12:16:00,19,It is great to hear that your camp is pretty much full for the year. Can you say which camp your family owns? Chris Fishing Traveler
1190044,lawdoer,2010-04-15 19:31:00,8,I am glad to hear from someone in the Chapleau area. I have fished the Ignace area for 20+ years and this year we are heading to the NE and fishing the Chapleau River just out of Chapleau. Nice to hear comments from guides in that area!
1190422,northsky99,2010-04-17 04:46:00,41,Glad to here your mom is doing better. We are going to Moose horn Lodge near Chapleau the last week of May they offer the option to take boats to different lakes in the area. Any suggestion on any lakes to fish would be very helpful. Thanks alot fISH ON
1192000,youngcanadianguide,2010-04-21 18:43:00,60,"Hey all,Thanks for giving me a warm welcome back to the board. I have 7 days till I head back to the great north. So far what I can tell you is most of the lakes ice out was the first week of April. My Dad had a conference call with some of the other camp owners The report is that water levels are low. Some of the camps docks are high and dry right now. The nights are pretty cool and the bait minnows haven't even spawned yet. Northsky99 one lake that I know is Sideburn. Roxanne sends her guests to there sometimes. A lot of the locals fish there. Roxanne should be able to give you more info about it. There is a boatlaunch at his camp for a small fee and it's right off of highway 101. Try the walleye fishing in the evening with live bait on a jig.(minnows work best but make sure when you hook them you do it from the bottom part of the mouth and between the nostils so they have plenty of action) There is a lot of standing trees and stumps in the shallow water from when they damed it up. On a different note I shot a tom 18 lbs. 9 3/4 inch beard and 3/4 in spurs. I had a great guide (my Dad) I sat down at at 6:30 and I shot him 8 yards away at 6:42. (this was a wild hunt) I give lots of credit to my Dad. He has put me on a turkey 2 years in a row.Thanks Youngcanadianguide God put us on this Earth only so long why not spend some of that time fishing"

1192928,halfmoon007,2010-04-24 21:37:00,121,HiBeen fishing Ramsey lake in the Biscotasing area (Rayscamps.com ) in August for the last 20 years and were doing a second trip this year to Borden lake ( chapleau lodge ) Last week of May. we won the trip at a outdoor expo here in Michigan on a drawing. Were strictly walleye guys so is Borden lake any good ? also don't have a clue on post spawn walleye fishing . Any comment would be appreciated...thanks Moon
1193020,youngcanadianguide,2010-04-25 08:23:00,60,"Hey Halfmoon007,The lake you are fishing in May is a deep lake. Compared to the lake I fish, the lake you are fishing is a little deeper on average. Where you are going, it has less walleye but they tend to be bigger. Be prepared for smaller numbers than your previous lake that you have been going to for 20 years. Remember going to a new lake is always harder to fish in the beginning. We talked to the Chapleau biologist and he said the spawn is starting right now. Most of the fish at the end of May are in the 15 ft. range by structure and live bait is the best for catching them. I prefer minnows with a 1/4 oz jighead. One thing that is different than your Aug. fishing trip is the black flies and mosquitos. I think that a thermacell would be a great addition to your fishing gear. Congratulations on winning a fishing trip. Its always nice to win a free trip. My family did that once, we won a walleye charter on Lake Erie. Unfortunately the fishing was horrible. We caught 3 fish in 6 hours. They were a Catfish, Smallmouth Bass, and a White Perch. We never saw a Walleye, but I had lots of fun talking to the captain and being with the family. A bad day of fishing is better than a good day at school. It's really all about the fishing not the catching, the fish are a bonus. When you are back send me a pm about your trip."
