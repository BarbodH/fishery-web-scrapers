525484,Guest,2002-11-20 10:20:00,0,Hello LoboGood to hear from you I saw your name after I poked a little fun at those lodge fisherman. Your flyin trips even make mine look sisssy.My wife wants to go up north of Pickle will go in the summer--not sure I can catch eyes when they aren't all in the area under the water falls waiting for the females.Do some fishing in the bush north of Terrace Bay pike and lake trout and fish some lakes out of Missanabie in the game preserve.Always looking for something new.Met a fella on the web maybe here or the other Canadian fishing web who has his own canoe flown in to lakes that he and his wife fish he is from Ohio he is a nice fella but hoping his football team if he is a fan doesn't have a fun day this Sat. hoping the wolverines eat those buckeyes;take care Lobolen
525485,lobo1,2002-11-20 18:06:00,734,"Len,We're going north of Armstrong next spring - a new place to us. The place I really wanted to go to required 6 guys and I came up 2 guys short. Hopefully the fishing is decent at the place we're headed to - it's called Whitewater Lake and is pretty big water.I'd like to try a trip the way you do it but would would probably have to tag along with someone more experinced the first time. You come up short one guy sometime - let me know. I can't see my wife in Pickle Lake but I suppose you pretty much just pass through anyhow. I still envision the drunken locals eyeballing our gear and especially the one that THOUGHT she could help herself to our beer !lobo"
525486,WillieB,2002-11-20 18:16:00,292,"Lobo1, By any chance are you going in to Whitewater thru Mattice Lake Outfitters?"
525487,lobo1,2002-11-20 18:25:00,734,"Willie B,as a matter of fact I am. plz don't tell me that the fishing sucks !!lobo"
525489,Guest,2002-11-20 18:59:00,0,"Contrary to the other opinions on this thread, I love this place. Every year the fishing gets better. Been there 4 times. The slot, which is in place for walleye in all of Northeastern Ontario is 16.1-22inches. The majority of our fish were 16 inches. Perfect for eating. Not sure what size these other guys are looking for. I'd rather catch a crapload of 1.5-2.5 pounders then one 5-7 pounder. If you aren't catching fish on Bisco, you're doing something wrong.By the way, Grey Owl is overpriced compared to others in the area."
525488,WillieB,2002-11-21 06:14:00,292,"Don't worry, lobo1...you're gonna have an excellent time and the fishing should be 1st class.Don and Annette are GREAT folks to deal with. Whitewater is a big body of water 25 miles or so, and I'm sure that they and their camp managers will turn you on to all the good spots.They're on the short list for me next year (they were runner-up last year), probably to one of their one cabin on the lake outposts like Vick or Pringle Lake.I think at Whitewater you've got electricity from generators and a camp caretaker...you'll be well taken care of!"
525490,Guest,2002-11-21 07:08:00,0,"OK, in the interest of accuracy, let me re-phrase my first reply. We also caught numerous 12-14' walleyes and several 15-22"" pike. However, this is not what I'd call ""catching fish"". I know, I'll catch flak over that comment. Had we known the fishing quality in the lake, number one, we wouldn't have gone, or number two, we would have taken our ultra-light rigs and maybe had some fun. Driving 14 hours to catch 1 lb. fish on 6 1/2' medium and medium-heavy rods with 8-10lb. line is not exactly what we had in mind. Not much of a challenge. My comment on the worst trip north, for catching fish as I define it, stands, though. Still, good cabin, equipment, good friends, and plenty of beer, it wasn't a complete waste but Bisco won't be in our future plans and I certainly would not recommend it to others."
525491,Tracy,2002-12-22 18:30:00,376,"I do not know much about Bisco, but heard it was a tough place to find the fish. We went to Ramsey this past summer (the lake dammed up south of Bisco). Part of the Spanish River. 1st time there. Caught mostly slot fish, 1 over and saw 1 other over the slot all week. We found and caught fish each day and averaged about 20 mixed pike and eyes a day. We did not really get on a pattern until our last day there. That day we found a large school 1/4 of a mile from the lodge in 15' of water, busted em good on jigs and minnows until dark. We did not get much help from the owners on locations to fish, just generalizations like: rocky points, wind blown shorelines and points, drops and timber, fish deep and slow. Funny we caught all of our fish in 15' of water or less, most in 5-8' fishing aggressively. We slow trolled and rip-jigged 1/8 once jigs and tails for most our fish. I would never go back there without minnows again.I was told Ramsey had better fishing than Biscotasing. Nice lodge, great price, all the food you can eat.... it is a great Canadian Vacation where you can fish, but not a great Canadian Fishing Vacation.Tracy"
1192946,halfmoon007,2010-04-24 22:58:00,121,Well its 2010 and i been going to Rayscamps.com for 20 years. And if your any kind of a fisher its always been very very good walleye fishing. You don't go to a lake for 20 years if its not.We travel 10 hrs. out of southern mi. and tear up the walleye. The slot was the greatest thing canada ever did for its fishery. some days we had a hard time cathing a fish small enough to eat. seen days on ramsey our arms got tired catching 18-19 ich walleye's. Have never used a minnow in fact the last 3 years we have abandondond the night crawler for mister twister sassy shad plastic grubs. Yes some days / years you have to think out of the box thats walleye fishing. Find that 10 foot hump the size of a school bus in 35 ft. of water and stop and check it daily and move on. 90% of people dont have a clue its there. A 100 $ graph is all you need. Forget marking fish just fish the contour of the bottom. I thank god my Brothers taught me how to walleye fish or I would sound like all these other posts sound. Going to fish ramsey email me at halfmoon007 at aol.com. and Ill tell ya like it is....Halfmoon
1193035,polaris-pete,2010-04-25 08:57:00,343,"I have fished Bisco and Ramsey for many years and like others have said, keep looking. I heard that Grey Owl Camps are up for sale. This lake used to be a gret lake to fish but has gone downhill drastically since then. If you want really good fishing in Ontario, you got to head West. What lodge are you planning to saty at? If you are definitely going, PM me and I will tell you some good spots where we used to do really well with the fish."
525474,Rick,2002-11-16 18:19:00,226,"Have a June trip planned to Lake Biscotasing- north of Sudbury-Spanish River area. Anybody else been there, fishing tips? Thanks."
525475,WillieB,2002-11-16 20:51:00,292,"try posting your question on www.ontariofishing.netA lot of folks from eastern Ontario...the North Bay, Timmins, Cochrane area."
525476,Guest,2002-11-17 16:36:00,0,yes been there 3 times it has a slot limit only for guest.We will never go back.
525477,Guest,2002-11-17 16:59:00,0,"If we're talking about the same place, about 4 hours north/northeast of the Soo, do yourself a favor and run like a scalded dog from this place. Worst fishing out of over 20 trips north. Was there 2 years ago and booked through Grey Owl Camps. Nice people, decent cabin and boats. Terrible fishing. The lake had a no-keep slot of about 15-20"" and thats all we caught. And we didn't catch many of those."
525478,Guest,2002-11-17 17:54:00,0,"mk,same place it was a joke."
525479,Guest,2002-11-18 08:00:00,0,"Last year party of 7 caught none over the slot, a few in the slot, and many under, around 12-14 inches. I'd give this place a few years and maybe some will grow up. Unless you like catching lots of small fish, I'd go elsewhere."
525480,Guest,2002-11-18 11:09:00,0,"i read somewhere that biscotasing had little or no baitfish in it, so the walleye, perch and northern have to eat one another. the following is from an article by mike willems of lac seul silver water wheel lodge that pretty well explains the situation at bisco.....""For years fisherman visiting Canada were puzzled as to why some lakes were jam packed with small walleyes and virtually no big fish, when another nearby body of water, sometimes even connected, consistently produced a good mix of small and big fish. The cause for the difference in size structure can often be attributed to the presence of a single specie of baitfish. Biologists have determined that one of the key forage required to consistently produce big walleyes on the Canadian shield is the Ciscoe. This high fat content bait fish is the ""Bacon Double Cheeseburger and Strawberry Shake"" of the walleye diet. Without them, walleyes have a difficult time exceeding the 5 LB mark, regardless of how long they live."""
525481,lobo1,2002-11-19 16:36:00,734,"MAN - that sucks !!!Plan yourself a trip and hear that it's a crappy place. Hopefully u can get your deposit back and look around for a camp with fish.Sounds like you could fish in your bath tub and do just as well as this place.good luck,lobo"
525482,lenray,2002-11-19 17:35:00,467,Where are the real adventure fisherman---you people always looking for those camps---what about buying a map meeting some of the folks who live in these areas make some relationships. Get a bushknife and hack your way into a secluded lake haul a canoe in and go from lake to lake by river then go overland with an inflatable and really do some fishing and cook your own meal and sleep with a tarp over you.Everyone looking for some easy to get to camp where you drive in with your big lund---each his or her own
525483,Guest,2002-11-19 17:52:00,0,"Len,What do you have in the pipeline for next year ? going back to the pickle area ? Do you still do some wawa area trips the same year you go west ?lobo"
