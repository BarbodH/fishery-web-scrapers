All of Rob's cabins and equipment are top notch and I have no doubt that you'd have a fantastic day.We think Pakwash is a good lake - or we wouldn't keep going back - and you shouldn't have much trouble finding some Walleyes. Not sure about fishing spots the last week of June since we go the first week of June. But Pakwash is probably like most lakes - keep an eye out for ""the fleet"" and you'll get an idea of the structure they're on at the time. There are two good sized rivers coming into the north end of the lake - and you won't be too far off if you fish likely looking structure where the wind has been blowing in.Just give Rob and Nancy a call - or check out their web site - www.snakefalls.com"

We were thinking Pakwash based on some of the discussions on this site. However, we don't know much about it. We also read that Snakefalls does 1 day fly in's to other lakes? Has anyone tried this? How was it and what was the cost?Thanks!!"
1192421,davenathe,2010-04-23 08:15:00,113,"Why go anywhere else, Lac Seul is huge you can fish a different location just on Lac Seul the rest of your life. Seriously, I have found trips more enjoyable with less moving around, different location, loading and unloading the boat, gear, etc... Unless of course you are taking a two week trip. Good luck Deacon"

Last year my family of four took one in late July and had our best day of fishing ever - and that includes trips onmulti-day fly in lakes through other outfitters.Most walleyes I've ever caught in a day and size too - multiple 26"" walleyes. My mom also caught a 41"" northern and I caught two 15+ pound northern on successive casts.Also had similar, but not quite as good luck a couple of years earlier."
