Hayden tickled a few bellies His eyes were wide open at the size of a few One of them had to be 15 lbs at least. I was out watching the pike spawn last week made me start itching to catch some of those monster size pike. I have 3 ""new"" weeks now due to the ice being out so early I didn't book any groups until may 23rd after the late ice outs in 08 and 09 so I'm offering those new weeks at 40% off So if your flexible and want to chase some big pike now is the time?"
