I'm not sure it is possible to predict much as far as how the fishing will be, due to so many ever changing weather patterns. For example, warmer weather might mean faster weed growth, except with the water levels being down, due to lack of moisture, some root systems may be high and dry, so there could be fewer weeds to fish in. Throw in a few sustaining cold fronts, a tropical downpour or two, and everything can change. Its a never changing guessing game. Bill Krejca"
