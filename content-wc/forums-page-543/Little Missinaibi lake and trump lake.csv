Where to fish, what tackle and so on. None of us have ever been to this lake before but I've been to Mosambik lake which is in the area. We are going opening week this may and would love some input please.Nick"

1189661,Skwire,2010-04-14 18:04:00,7,"RedwingfanWe flew into Little Miss with Airdale in early June '08. Beautiful lake, with great fishing. Hawk Air's camp is in the western basin, but the guys that were there when we were up seemed to always fish in the eastern basin, where we were fishing. A hot spot for us for walleye were the indian pictograph near the centre of the lake, and ""peckerhead bay"" (look at a map, you'll see why it's called that! ) a little further in the north east arm. One one particular overcast day, I was trolling along the edge of some reeds and caught at least 20 walleye in less than an hour, in only 4 feet of water, using bottom bouncers, spinner rigs and leeches.Same tactics at the pictographs. My fishing partner used a black/silver J7 Rapala with good success as well.We went into Trump Lake for lakers one afternoon, but had no luck. The boat ride into there though, is quite the experience! A few guys in our group did well with large northerns in the bay just before the portage into Trump.Email me if you need more info.Marc"

Other then that one big one I rember most the rest 1 to 2 lbs about it and not that many at that at least not compared to what we were used to doing in Mannitoba. I remember seeing sevral moose while out fishing."
1190310,Redwingfan8714,2010-04-16 15:16:00,8,"Awesome, what did you get the big guy on? Did you go to the Lake trout lake at all?"
1190354,jWN,2010-04-16 18:19:00,62,"Caught the big one on a white hair jig with a pink head, I rember we were right off one of the Islands. No as I rember they the outfiter never said anything about another lake."
1191160,Redwingfan8714,2010-04-19 10:11:00,8,"Awesome, very nice! Well Ill be hoping to get one myself. But it sounds like most of the fish there are of the eater variety."
