562405,Guest,2006-12-22 10:01:00,0,RatherbeFishing: My gang has been to several Ontario/Quebec destinations in the area you're looking to go to. Just do a Search using my name in this Canada Forum and you'll see several of my fishing reports. I'd be glad to share any additional info you may want. Welcome Home!
562406,ratherbefishin,2006-12-22 13:50:00,11,"Guys, Thanks for the info. I'll pass this on to the rest of my group. I think my group is trying to plan a trip for the May-June timeframe, about a month or so after I get home. Once again thanks. Rather-be-Fishin"
562408,Guest,2006-12-22 14:55:00,0,"RatherbeFishing: Guess I misunderstood....you're still over there and making plans for when you do return. Thank you for serving,, on behalf of all Walleye Fishermen. I'll bet this website means more to you than any of us can imagine. Is there anything you need over there that an old walleye fisherman could send you??? My thoughts are with you, and I hope for a safe return and one great Fishing trip with your buddies when you get home. Merry Christmas!"

You don't go to a lake for 20 years if its not.We travel 10 hrs. out of southern mi. and tear up the walleye. The slot was the greatest thing canada ever did for its fishery (sorry to se it go ). some days we had a hard time cathing a fish small enough to eat. seen days on ramsey our arms got tired catching 18-19 ich walleye's. Have never used a minnow in fact the last 3 years we have abandondond the night crawler for mister twister sassy shad plastic grubs. Yes some days / years you have to think out of the box thats walleye fishing. Find that 10 foot hump the size of a school bus in 35 ft. of water and stop and check it daily and move on. 90% of people dont have a clue its there. A 100 $ graph is all you need. Forget marking fish just fish the contour of the bottom. I thank god my Brothers taught me how to walleye fish or I would sound like all these other posts sound. Going to fish ramsey email me at halfmoon007 at aol.com. and Ill tell ya like it is....Halfmoon
562313,ratherbefishin,2006-12-14 13:15:00,11,"Just wanted to know if anybody had has been to 'Rays Camps' on Ramsey lake in Biscotasing? The last trip that my group went on was to Lady Evelyn Lake, unfortunately the fishing was bad and the service at the camp was lacking. We are looking for a new place to go to either in Ontario or Quebec. (I am returning to the states after a year long all-inclusive Iraq vacation, courtesy of Uncle Sam.) Any info would be appreciated. Thanks guys."

562315,ratherbefishin,2006-12-14 14:58:00,11,"In Ontario any where in the James Bay Frontier, Algoma Country, Rainbow Country, Near North and Ontario East. In Quebec any where in Abitibi, Laurentians, Lac Saint Jean and the southern portion of the Far North. We are after walleye and pike, and if there is bass in the area great. Since some members of the group are getting up years we like to keep the driving between 600-800 miles."
562320,jigman 2003,2006-12-15 08:01:00,981,"I can't help you out on those areas, but I'm sure someone else here can. Suggestions guys?"
562336,phishfearme,2006-12-17 13:38:00,1242,"rbf - my group fished at rays back in the 70's and early 80's and watched the walleye fishing change for the better (when ray opened his camp, there were only pike and he's guarantee 100 pounds of pike a day or your stay was free) when walleye were stocked from bisco lake. then we watched it deteriorate as 1, people drove more and more roads in and 2, hydro let the water level fluctuate so wildly that spawning was frequently killed. we havn't been back since 1986 when we saw waterskiers. i think you may be able to find some good outfitters - both flyin and drive in - in the wawa, white river area. look at:http://northtoadventure.com andhttp://www.ontariowilderness.com i havn't been to these places personnally but when i researched them i got some good feedback. BUT, we can get MUCH larger, less fished lakes with consistently bigger fish in NW ontario and we bite the bullet and do the drive to get it. good luck, phish"
562348,ratherbefishin,2006-12-18 06:53:00,11,"Phish, Thanks for the info, I'll pass it on to my group. If you dont mind, where in NW Ontario do you and your group fish, and what type of drive are we talking about."
562349,phishfearme,2006-12-18 08:14:00,1242,"you can see my report from last summer at:https://walleyecentral.com/dc/dcboard...2922&mode=full there's lots and lots of outfitters to choose from in what ontario calls sunset country. we pretty much go to different lakes every year - flyin housekeeping - but the bow lake deal was too good to pass up so we did a second trip there last july. spend some time reading some recent posts by jigman to get some additional options. we drive from pittsburgh - a solid two days to places like armstrong, pickle lake or ear falls/red lake - but like i said before we can get hugh lakes all to ourselves here - no way in eastern ontario or quebec - so we do 10 day trips and the drive is just part of the two weeks. good luck, phish"
562354,Guest,2006-12-18 12:52:00,0,If a fly in interests you then look at Nakina area of Ontario. Best fishing for the $$$ in Ontario. We use AWO out of Nakina. www.awonakina.com. If I can help e-mail [email protected].
562359,guyzumi,2006-12-18 17:00:00,79,"The owners (Thea Ritchie) are sticklers for details!! They have purchased Yamaha outboards for their fleet and they are very particular on how they want thing done!! I have not been to their place but from what I hear everything is done to exceed your expectations. Rays Camps is about 2 hours north of Sudbury, Ontario. don't know if this helps but thought I could give insite to the people you would be dealing with!! have fun, Guy"
562396,beagle22b07,2006-12-21 09:34:00,34,"rather Look into Lac Poutrincourt. This has been by far the finest walleye destination we've been to. It's a solid 12 hr drive from the Thousand Islands crossing crossing. A few bucks more thatn other outfitters, but again worth the money. If you want more info, e-mail me and I'll get back to you. Larry"
