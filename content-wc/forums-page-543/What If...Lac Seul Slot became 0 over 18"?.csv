1101432,Mike Kansas,2009-04-30 12:35:00,1463,"One interesting thing about Lac Seul is that during the last 10 years or so the Smallmouth fishing has become very good. When we first started going to LS 20 years ago we hardly ever caught any Smallmouth. Then we started picking up a few while jigging Eyes and now we actually fish for them part of the time and have had some days that a boat with two guys catch 50 or so in an afternoon. We have caught some in the 22"" range but the majority are in the 15""/17"" range. I have heard that Smallies love to eat eggs and could cause some problems with consumption of Walleye eggs but I have no proof of that or what I would call a reliable source of information. Does anyone else know of that situation? Mike Kansas"
1101449,Guest,2009-04-30 13:12:00,0,"Hey Mike, Your observations of the bass fishing is consistent with the known increase in the population. We are getting off the thread's topic, but your question of whether bass being introduced and growing in population affects the walleye fishery, is one which has been heavily debated and studied in fishery management circles for years. There is a ton (arguably too much) of anecdotal observations, and relatively less science. And because such effects require a long period of measurement, it is more difficult to make empirical-based conclusions. This topic was just rekindled on Thunder Bay Fishing a couple months ago, as the MNR is conducting open houses to gather information on proposed changes to FMZ6--which includes raising the bass limit to 'encourage anglers to harvest more bass and less walleye'.....it's a lot of reading debate if you have time:http://fishingboard.thunderbayfishin...showtopic=4708http://fishingboard.thunderbayfishin...showtopic=4697http://fishingboard.thunderbayfishin...showtopic=4668 As I said there, I prefer to overview the science from many sources to form my opinion.

Secondly a email to the DNR there got the response that the existing limits are to keep the fish levels as they are.So if you decide to keep a over 18""r, your not the devil incarnate, your just doing that the DNR says you have a right too, and they are ok with that.With that, I've kept a few over in the 30 years I've been going to Canada, usually 19-21"" usually to make the shore lunch or supper when needed, never kept one to hang on the wall though and don't intend to.Now if the DNR says the fish levels are dropping from over fishing, lets change all that, how about we stop fishing entirerly for say..3 or 4 years and let the fish recover, that is what anybody who isn't thinking about their livihood or self centerness should say.Hard to have your cake and eat it too...Would I stop going if the limits were changed, probably not, but it'd be a cold day when a guide tells me he making up rules as he see's fit.If there really is a problem contact your DNR. imhoAl"

1101814,eyefanatic,2009-05-01 18:42:00,25,"I undertand that different anglers enjoy targeting different spieceies of fish. This is just my perspective but if I want to catch bass I can go out my back door and catch small mouth bass. I can fly down to florida or texas and catch bass. Don't get me wrong, I am not digging on anyone that enjoyes catching small mouth bass. Personally I don't mind a little diversity when fishing. However, if the managment of lac seul's fishery decided that they wanted to tailor the fishery to broaden the spieceies available I would not be a happy camper. Of course, I believe that the slot limit is in place to provide safety to the spawning population. My worry is that the fishery is getting to much fishing preasure and not allowing enough fish to grow up to, and past the slot limit. The target harvest fish is anything below 18"". Mature fish that have already past the slot size can only live X years before they eventually die. With the amount of slot fish being caught, gut hooked, taken for shore lunch, or dieing from old age I begin to wonder... are there enough fish under the slot limit to provide consistant fishing 5-7 year form now? I am sure that this idea has been addressed more than just once. Personally I would like to see the slot limit adjusted every so often to let a year class of fish make it through the target area of 16""-18"". I think that this would help maintain the health of the fishery by ensuring that the spawning population is replenished. Personally, I believe that certain year classes of fish need more protection than others. Since Lac Seul is not a lake, fluctuations in water level also make it difficult for different year classes of fish to survive but this is a whole different topic. Do I believe that 0 over 18"" a good thing? Some could argue no however I say yes. Its atleast a start but its not an answer."
1101855,orchard frank,2009-05-01 22:15:00,1900,"Not sure how many studies have been conducted on Shield waters concerning the issue of delayed mortality from catch and release fishing. Certainly, large fish fought to exhaustion on light tackle are very prone to injury or death from lactic acid production. What percentage, who knows. Deep water, warm temps, hook injuries all increase the odds of mortality. Even smaller fish suffer some loss, poor handling, deep hooking (feeding line on a lindy rig bite will cause a lot of deep injuries), cutting the line to leave the hook in etc. Post tournament studies range from almost 0 to 30%, but there are other factors in tourneys, especially livewell time. I think it would be a safe guess, that there is loss associated with C&R, catch 100 fish, you may be killing 5 or 10, maybe more, maybe less. I don't think it will ever be a regulatory issue, just something to consider in the overall picture of fish populations in regards to fishing pressure."

1151650,Steve of Madison,2009-12-03 08:39:00,230,"Mike...in my opinion your estimates are very high.My experience is not that drastic, I will have maybe 1 bleeder a week and I try to keep them if I can. I backtroll about half the time, with my own handtied rigs, jig about 25% and slipbobber 25%. I don't use stingers. But I think the reason I don't have any deeply hooked (bleeders) when I backtroll is because of the hooks I use when pulling a minnow. #2 Tru turn, corner of the mouth everytime. When I am pulling a worm rig I tie with a circle hook, #4, again rarely deeply hooked. But I set the hook at the slightlest tap when jigging and watch that bobber closely."
1151685,Steve Ediger,2009-12-03 11:06:00,97,"Mike,I find it hard to believe that any walleye fisherman on Lac Seul that is a good enough fisherman to catch 40 walleyes a day would be so slow on the hook set to end up with 10% of the fish bleeding. I honestly don't think our boat ends up with three bleeders a week, and one of us is a teenager."
1151696,Mike Kansas,2009-12-03 11:55:00,1463,Thanks for your opinions men. You guys have some very good points and partially have answered my question. Maybe my estimate of bleeders is high.

1152740,AllenW,2009-12-07 16:44:00,11482,"Might be a bit high I think too, but what I'd like to know is, what percentage of the people that fish Canada are either on this forum or expert in the ways of hooking fish?I don't know, but I'm willing to bet the average fisherman from southern lakes is used to the longer time before hookset when fishing with live bait ??That would mean the chance of more gut hooking.Al"
1153168,Mike Kansas,2009-12-09 13:56:00,1463,I go on a couple trips a year to Canada and one of the trips has guys who have fished Canada for 20+ years. They do a good job of fast hook sets and it results in less bleeders. However the trip we take wives and kids on has more slow sets and it does result in more bleeders and gut hooks. In those two groups together we have 18 or so people every year with 5 to 6 slow setters so our groups % would be about 30% slow setters plus some of the self proclaimed experts being guilty of the slow set syndrome on occasion too. (Myself Included) While this may supply food for the Eagles and Gulls it still pains me to throw back a damaged fish. Mike Kansas
1168425,Guest,2010-02-12 14:20:00,0,"I've been fishing Canada for more than 25 years. I'm only 35 so I guess I consider myself spoiled. We have had years where we were lucky to catch enough walleyes to make a meal and we've had years where they were practically jumping into the boat. The last few years we've been fishing Lac Seul and I think the fishing is excellent compared to past experience. I like to eat walleye and during the weeklong trip to Canada every year I hope to eat walleye for every evening meal. It isn't about taking a limit home although I make sure I do. In fact, last year I took my 5 and 6 year old son along and bought them licenses so we could take their limit home as well. Is it because I'm greedy? I don't think it's anyone else's place to judge. My wife enjoys it as well and this way we can have a few meals of walleye in between. We catch plenty in the 15 to 17 inch range to eat and we also catch plenty within and over the slot. People talk about getting replicas done and that this is what everyone is doing now days. Well that isn't necessarily the case. I am close friends with a taxidermist who takes in tons of fish every year and I would say that less than 5% of those fish are replicas. I, myself, in 25 years of fishing Canada have never caught a walleye over 27"". I've got several in the 25 and 26"" range and have let them all go. My grandpa, after fishing Canada for about 40 years or so caught a 29"" walleye about 5 years ago. We kept that fish and I had it mounted for him because it was the biggest by far that he has ever caught in his life. I dont care for replicas. No matter how good your measurements I don't consider it the same fish. You may as well just take a picture and hang it on your wall. I'm not knocking the idea completely but I'm just saying there is some sense of pleasure by having that same fish on your wall. I think if the same person caught several that big and kept them all that would be a bit much but it is such a rarity in my experience that catching and keeping one doesn't hurt anything. If I catch one that's 30"" I'm keeping it. If I catch another over 30 after that they'll be going back in the water. Another thing is that although the price isn't real drastic, do you realize that getting a replica mount done costs almost twice as much as a real mount? I think it makes more sense to increase the slot limit. 18""-28"" would be a good place to start. I highly doubt too many people are keeping fish in that range anyways so I think the discussion in and of itself is a mute point. I find it hard to believe that this issue has much to do with there being a lack of fish over 30"". There are places on Lac Seul where we can catch 22 to 25"" fish all day long. Is this argument any different than the one with people telling deer hunters to let the little ones go so they can shoot and see more big bucks? I enjoy fishing in canada whether I'm catching 16 incher after 16 incher or if I'm catching bigger fish. Sure it would be nice to catch a 30 incher just like it would be nice to shoot a 180 inch whitetail. Outside of poaching or taking over your limit of fish I think people should be allowed to keep what they want. If people use common sense and are responsible I don't think any of those lakes are going to suffer all that much. I know people will argue all day long with me on that but restrictions are tougher now than they've ever been and there are more people taking less fish than ever before and letting bigger ones go than ever before and I don't see that much of an improvement from 20 years ago. One more point...several years ago they did a study on big Musky's in Wisconsin. They caught several big muskies and tagged them with some gps deal so they could keep track of where they went. The majority of those fish died after being released. Granted these are Muskies and not Walleyes, but how much handling is going to go into a 30"" plus walleye after it is caught? The pictures, the measuring, the holding, I mean just because the fish swims off doesn't mean thta fish isn't going to be floating at the top a few hours later. anyways, I'm done with my argument. Everyone just needs to stop worrying about what everyone else is doing all the time and telling everyone else how a fisherman is supposed to act."
1168551,Skywagon,2010-02-13 06:36:00,1106,"""The last few years we've been fishing Lac Seul and I think the fishing is excellent compared to past experience.""jgt, I think you just gave the whole point to why slot limits and keep and kill are working. Thankfully most people understand this concept and are operating differently from the mind set of old. I don't think nearly as many people are taking fish home any more, they are throwing the trophies back for others to catch and the conservation licenses are getting more popular for good reason. I know it is easy to think that it is just a few fish, no big deal, but there are other people that want to enjoy a quality fishing experience also. Maybe even your children in the future?"
1168973,bpetersen,2010-02-14 19:46:00,251,"SeulAreaWalleye, It would not stop me from going to Lac Seul. I don't take any over 17.5 anyway. I do have a question for the more well studied members. Why is the upper end of the slot at 21 inches? It can't be to protect the best spawners. Aren't the better spawners bigger than that? I was just wondering why 21 inches is the magic number. I am sure there has to be some kind of scientific reason that escapes me. By the way, love the thread."
1169149,Obabikon,2010-02-15 12:56:00,2370,"Just adding my 2 cents in here... even though my Resort is on Lake of the Woods. You have to be careful about changes based on trends. Sometimes removing larger fish (in a controlled manner) will actually improve the fishery. There's a bunch of things that could result from a change like this... while I believe it would be positive, honestly nobody knows for sure. Look at Red Lake in Minnesota. The walleye fishing has completely rebounded, but I've heard the crappie fishing has almost disappeared. I'm not saying that's definately the cause, I'm just saying that walleye aren't the only fish in the lake. AND, if they were, the lake wouldn't survive. Let's leave the decision making to the actual scientist, who have an amazing amount of resources at their disposal. Fishermen just need to obey the law, and enjoy their trip. Balanced fisheries are difficult to keep, but if a lake has one, the last thing you want to do is change the rules."
1169517,cspierings,2010-02-16 14:47:00,230,"I have fished Lac Seul at least one week for the last 19 years. So that means my comments are based on one week maybe two over the course of those years. I love catching those slot fish they are healthy and they all go back. In the years fishing LS I cannot recall ever hooking a walleye so badly it couldn't be released. I am not saying it hasn't happened I just don't remember it being a common occurence. I tend to jig fish as much as I can and cast crankbaits if that doesn't work. Trolling is a last resort for me. What I want to share is what I have witnesses within the group of guys who stay where we do around the same weeks. Overall the fishing crew is getting older but the fishing methods they use aren't changing. THey troll from the time they get up until its time for dinner. Every walleye is flipped into the floor of boat and then they work on unhooking it. Sometimes if it is a big fish it is netted. Even the big ones get bounced off the floor. It is disgusting the way most of those guys handle the fish. I would bet the mortality rate on those fish is very high when they are in the slot and promptly released after being stepped on to hold while ripping the hook out. Those same guys look at the limit as what they will be taking home. That includes a fish above the slot whether it is a trophy or not. I am about to paint with a rather broad brush but I truly believe some of this is a generational thing. I fish with my father, son and uncle we do eat fish at night when we can but we treat the fish in Canada the same way we do at home. The smaller ones are kept for frying up. We put a couple of the nicer ones on the low side of the slot in the freezer to take home and the big girls go back in the lake. I don't feel it is ethical to take them at home in the US why do it in Canada even if it is legal as your above the slot fish. If the research supported it I would love to see the ""trophy"" end of the slot raised to 28"". I haven't caught a walleye near that big on Lac Seul in at least a decade. In fact the only one that comes to mind was two years ago, I was fortunate to go back in the fall and my Dad caught the ugliest walleye I have ever seen. Grey, skinny and almost 32"" long but that is the biggest fish in terms of length we have seen in years. I don't have a walleye on the wall. I have only ever caught two that I felt were trophies and both were caught in the US. Lake Bemidji and Devils Lake ND. Several close on the Fox by DePere. All were released. The one in MN was 32"" but she was caught while fishing for other fish and Walleye wasn't open yet. I have to tell you that I am not a fan of having to kill the fish right away. I know the arguments for it and given the way those guys I referred to operate I think it is better for the fishery in the long run. What about the folks who kill any fish they catch that isn't a walleye? Over they years I have gotten to know a couple folks in Ear Falls and have fished with them (only once after witnessing what I am about to describe)and I can still think of two guys who anytime they catch a Northern pike it gets clubbed and dumped back in the water or if it is a snake clubbed on the gunwale and tossed as far as the guy can throw it. Why????? Again guys in there 60s and 70s. The view expressed by one of the fellas is that Northern are trash fish. LS is a special place to me for its memories but I am finding that when it comes to catching fish over 25"" I am having more luck in places closer to home and with more consistency. I am able to stay within 8 hours of home and catch the bigger ones the cost for the trips is less overall and I don't have to fool around with the boarder. I almost believe that the slot is driving people to take that one fish over the slot even if its not a trophy and the high end is suffering in terms of population. Having written all this if I went out with a guide and caught my trophy and it was legal to keep I would severely disappointed if I wasn't permitted one for the wall due to some personal rule of the guide's. The fish are a great resource and also a source of some folks livelihood at least in part. Given the continuing economic woes I would think some common ground on this issue would be critical. If there truly is a problem I hope the MNR will look at the lake and develop a sensible plan that permits my friends in Canada to still host folks like me and provide a fishery and scenery that will keep me coming back. My experiences the last few years have me questioning the fishery, the view is still incredible. This year though may be my swan song for Lac Seul. I am bringing the whole family two adults, four kids and the costs are considerable. My son likes the place since he has been already. This will be the first time for the girls and one is already talking about how she wants to get a big fish so she can take a picture to show her friends ( she is 10). She wants it to be bigger than her biggest fish so far a 7 lb channel cat. If she succeeds there is a chance for two more families coming back to Ontario when they kids are older."
1169747,SeulAreaWalleye,2010-02-17 09:10:00,100,"According to the MNR when they first introduced this slot of 18-21"", their biologists claim that those fish are in ""their prime"", and produce the most amount of healthy eggs...etc. I am not sure why they capped it at 21"", I would have liked to see it higher. Over 21"" is meant for a trophy....but I believe that it should be over 28"". In my time, the results of this slot so far have been amazing for the numbers increase in Lac Seul and connecting waters. I know the people that were conducting the study(Creel) on our end last summer(Minnitaki, Abram, Pelican, and Botsford). I was told that almost every angler interviewed had great success on numbers and big fish - everyday, everywhere. I do hope to see the study results one day soon. If anybody has ever been to the English River santuary on Minnitaki, they know how many young walleyes are in this system, honestly you can catch endless 12 inchers in the rapids sometimes even on a bare jig.....it is teaming, and is a novelty which gets boring for me quick because it is just too easy(and no big fish...lol). Great place to bring kids. My personal reflection is that any lake with natural reproduction that is looking to increase their population should implement this slot....it definetly works. The big fish are still here and if you've fished this area(east end) in May, early June, you know that monster walleyes are plentiful and common. The majority of spawning areas are here. My guest released a 33"" fish in May last year, and for Lac Seul that is one OLD fish. With the season's overall cooler water temps, I saw more than normal released over 28"", and a few more over 30"", many of those being heathy looking fish. I released a tagged 28"" last August, and when I filled out the tagged release form, the information that was sent back to me was astonishing... the results were close TEN years for that fish to grow about 5 inches!!! Maybe no change is needed here, and with the high numbers of walleye, but slow growth rate, maybe time will show the increase of monster fish once again. Keep letting those big fish go."
1173633,wtw_fisherman,2010-03-02 10:13:00,13,I am 60 years old and have fished Canada for almost 40 years. I think the total release of fish over the limit is the best thing any lake could do for the fish. The resort owners would have to stress the need to have at least one camera on board at all times. Just do it.
1191354,davenathe,2010-04-19 20:32:00,113,"Yep, release everything over 18"". I think a 14-15"" fish is the best to eat and if I do not bring any fish home if is no big deal. I go to catch as many fish as possible and love being able to catch 100 walleye on a good day. As long as the lake has feed to support the population. Deacon"
1191456,AllenW,2010-04-20 07:08:00,11482,"X2Good post. After fishing Canada for over 40 years I wouldn't even consider myself qualified enough to make them kind of decisions.I've posted this before but evidently people just ignore it, the MNR says they are happy with regs as they stand.Some keep fish, some don't, but unless you can convince the MNR that a lake is actually stressed enough to warrant more studies on fish population, I'm not so sure your accomplishing anything other than widening the gap between C&R and those that keep fish.Here's one for ya, I think if the fish population is indeed in jeopardy on LS, eliminate all live bait, that ought to slow them down a bit. Al"
1168852,go dart,2010-02-14 11:09:00,77,"Can't agree with this post. Kansas is a ""put and take"" walleye fishery. The natural recruitment is spotty at best and lets face it not native to our man made reseviors. If not for the milking of females for eggs during the spawn and mixing with milt, then sent to hatcherys until ready to stock, we wouldn't produce enough fish to sustain a walleye fishery. Lac Suel is a whole nother story where fish may cycle but natural recruitment will sustain the fishery. I'll easily keep a 21"" fish from one of our local lakes Why not? Corp of engineers opens those spillway gates and dump more walleyes down the river then we'll ever catch but I wouldn't plan to keep one on a Canadian lake because that fish is simply more important to that lakes future."
1168874,Flip Silverlake,2010-02-14 13:26:00,645,"If there is netting going on it is pointless to limit sport fishing to 18 inch max due to the fact that the method that is used in netting kills just about everything over 13 inches. The folks netting for there own use find that the 17 inch fish are the most deserible for selling where I find the term ""own use"" rather funny. The nets that are used do not retain walleyes under 13 inches and everything that is caught in the nets are dead when the nets are pulled. You can alway find the boats retreving the nets due to the gulls and pelicans following them. I have attached a photo taken on the Lake of The Woods of a netting operation this summer. Be sure to check out the birds feeding on eveything that is not kept by the netters. SO until I see some action with reguard to this kind of activity you will be hard pressed to get my support for any more regulation of sport fishing. By the way, I spend all summer on Lake Of The Woods and only keep and eat 14 to 16 inch fish. The reason for the edit was that the date on the photo is todays date due to having to reduce it's size so it could be up loaded. The picture was taken in June of 2009 near Scottys Island."
1168886,JDP,2010-02-14 14:06:00,1457,While speaking with a Lac Seul resort owner at a Sport Show a few weeks ago he mentioned that the Ontario MNR apparently is planning to do test netting/ walleye population assessment in the near future. Hopefully they will be able to use the data from the 1996 population survey and the 2010 survey data and to make the proper adjustments to regulations.
1150036,Guest,2009-11-24 16:20:00,0,I just wanted to add that the reason for less trophy walleye these days is that When they started the slot limit you would be lucky to catch a walleye of size to eat.This was causing the very small or very large fish to be left at the time the law was enforced.This is the reason for the dragon fish phase.The lake only needs time to grow enough older fish so that we can begin to catch them again.
1150271,Guest,2009-11-25 16:27:00,0,"How bout 18-28inches for the slot, I think that would be better for the fishery. And put a santurary on Broad and Sunlight, Jun 15th, these two get way too much pressure, this would help out alot."
1150325,rather-be-fishin,2009-11-25 23:35:00,429,"I have been fishing LacSeul for several years. We do not keep any Walleyes over 18"" and support catch & release. However, we do enjoy 1-2 meals of fresh fish while in Canada and do bring a limit of eaters home. I think a 18-28"" slot limit is also a good idea, to prevent the few people who still keep one over 21"" from doing so. I also support replicas of a trophy, but have kept one 28"" that died after releasing it for a wall mount. Three - five years ago we had trouble catching enough ""eaters"" <18"" and started to think that the ""eaters"" had been fished out. However, last year we were happy to see that we caught many smaller walleyes 10-14"" in addition to many slot and over the slot walleyes. We found this reassuring that there is a new class of smaller walleyes coming up. To me there already is a ""No fish over 18"" rule"" so I would still go the Lac Seul, because it is the best walleye lake I have ever been too for numbers and size of walleyes. Regarding the netting issue - 2 years ago I did see nets on McKenzie Bay/Bay of Islands in late July. Regarding the Bass fishing issue ~ if it is going to impact or hurt the walleye fishing I am against promoting it and would encourage any measures to stop it. You can catch Bass pretty much anywhere! Let's keep Lac Seul the premier walleye lake that it is and improve it for even better walleye fishing for many years to come! 8 Months and counting down ~ back to Awesome Lac Seul!"
1150406,tackleman,2009-11-26 10:12:00,444,"As Larrym says, here on gullrock, the campowners enforce the no fish over 18 in their camps and the fishing is great. In Red Lake, they don't and even though the fishing is good on Red Lake, it is probably the locals that break the regulations more often.I know of several people who go fishing only to bring home the big ones. I've been SO impressed with the sportsmanship of the anglers I meet on gullrock with their eagerness to release larger fish and be happy with a picture of the trophy.It showes the lake can improve after a number of years of size restriction."
1150411,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-11-26 10:51:00,100,"I had forwarded this thread to the Local MNR, and everyone up here is impressed with all of the conservation minded anglers out there. The thought that locals keep more big walleyes is probably correct, and I hope that one day that will change. The smallmouth issue urgently needs to be addressed, just as the Whitefish and sucker population needs to be controlled...these are in high numbers here as well, and I personally don't feel that the Bass should have a slot, and maybe the limit should increase on these. I encourage my guests to take smallies, if they are taking walleyes, to at least even things out. Most of the anglers I know don't keep Bass. This past season showed myself and guests many healthy, huge walleyes released(over 28""), so maybe the slot should be left where it is.I would love to here how everyone else on this end did with releasing Big walleyes this year. This past summer's study of MAPB lakes here had some very impressive results, and I'm sure that we will learn more about that soon. I hope that they conduct the same one for Lac Seul next year.Thanks again for the overwhelming response to this thread, and keep letting them go!Feel free to PM me anytime to discuss Lac Seul(EAST!), and other area waters."
1151430,Mike Kansas,2009-12-02 09:53:00,1463,"Been on Lac Seul for over 20 years and most of the time 2 or 3 times a season. The exisiting slot limit on Lac Seul has played a major part in Lac Seul being a Walleye factory. A new slot of nothing over 18"" might even make it better and if it would I'm all for it. The question I have is would barbless hooks be a good choice? Have fished in Manitoba barbless and don't feel that we lost many fish because of it. Would barbless help the survival rate of those caught and released? I think it would...what do you think? Mike Kansas"
1151445,Steve Ediger,2009-12-02 10:56:00,97,I have fished Lac Seul for quite a few years - 2 - 3 weeks a year and over that time I have seen very few fish floating that were killled by deep hook sets and released.
1151477,Aaron-IN,2009-12-02 13:25:00,500,"I might have to start going to LS for smallmouth from now on Honestly, I myself never keep a smallmouth bass to eat, I only keep walleye but I target smallmouth ( I know this isn't the norm up there). However, my father has always kept the 12-14 inch bass to eat and I have to admit they are not a bad eating fish at all."
1151565,Guest,2009-12-02 19:14:00,0,"Well Steve, do you think the reason why you don't see fish floating is because the gulls or the eagles clean them up pretty fast? And if you don't believe me, konk a walleye over the head and see how long it takes for it to disappear!!"
1151633,Mike Kansas,2009-12-03 07:48:00,1463,"GOOD POINT....So what do people think about Barbless Hooks? I have always heard and think it may be true that bleeders have a very low survival rate. For this reason I keep the bleeders I can. I do believe that barbless would stop a lot of the bleeders and maybe save some fish for the next generation. Is this POSSIBLE? 1000 fisherman a day on Lac Seul...each catchs 40 Walleye...10% are bleeders....50% of the bleeders don't make it....thats 2000 fish a day which equals a Conservation license for each of the 1000 fisherman.....hypothetical...what do you think. Best Regards, Mike Kansas"
1150027,Guest,2009-11-24 16:00:00,0,"Let me start by saying I have been going to and also own a fishing cabin on lac suel.I think that when it went from 6 to 4 fish it was good when it went from no slot to slot for walleye it was better.Then they put a slot on pike too.This allowed me as of late to experience the best walleye and pike fishing I have ever had.I myself keep the 1 over 21 and so do the other members of my party every trip.I am very strict when it comes to watching over my guests as they catch,release and keep.This is the law and It has done nothing but improved our lake.I thank guests such as yourselves for leaving everything in the lake but I do nt think it is needed. I have a better idea to fix the problems of fishing lovers and fish lovers.let the limit be 0 to 20 inches and only 1 over 29 inches.This would in fact be a more aggresive slot limit bringing more spawn and allowing the fish lovers to have a bigger and larger scale to eat from and establishes the 1 over for trophy fish in its essence.After all how many fish over 29 have we cuaght or will we catch even with a slot. Let me end this by saying that I have let go every fish that was a trophy I have ever cuaght.The pike limit works better becuase the size is more forgiving to both sides.THE REAL PROBLEM THAT MOST SHOULD ANSWER FOR IS THE SMALLMOUTH POPULATION AND WHAT THAT DOES TO PIKE AND WALLEYE.HEED THAT WARNING AND WATCH ALL FISHING GO DOWN WHILE SMALLMOUTHS GROW IN NUMBERS BECUASE THE MINISTRY IS BACKING THE INTRODUCTION AND REINFORCING THE SPAWNING OF THESE SPAWN SUCKING FISH. FUN TO CATCH BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE WALLEYE AND NORTHERN PIKE."
1100509,stevensinks,2009-04-27 13:26:00,330,At home in Kansas or in Canada I never keep a fish that I dont plan to eat that day and those small ones eat much better than the big ones. Like Joeman I sure wish kansas would go to a slot and stop killing or spawners.
1100736,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-04-28 07:45:00,100,"I am very impressed to see everyone's positive reactions to this post. I believe the days of the ""Old School"" meat hunters have finally come to an end. This will be dicussed further, and pushed for, like never before....but like it was said on here...It's up to the biologists.I think that we should all be proud of ourselves for being conservation minded, and just with that attitude alone, our great grandchildren will still see awesome fishing!Although the walleyes numbers have improved over the years of the current slot, the fishermen have increased as well. I personally don't believe that there aren't as many big fish in the lake as there once were. We all know how many monsters there are when they spawn, and many of those places are now sanctuaries, so we don't even see the big fish.My personal belief is that the big girls are just deeper now, than most of us prefer to fish, feeding on cisco's and herring. I'm sure that we've all seen accidental big catches by fishing too deep. They don't fair to well, and most of us won't fish deeper than 40 feet. The forage is incredible, smelt are in huge numbers(and protected here???), so I'm pretty sure that more big walleyes would not starve to death. Afterall, the whitefish and perch are the biggest numbers in the lake, with no slot and barely sought after by anglers.The slot way south(kansas) sounds a bit ridiculous to me, you are right...killing all the breeders, who thought up that one?The suggested slot of 18-26"" for this area, is a good one as well.Thank you to everyone on here for your excellent comments on this, and I wish you all an incredible trip here this season.Let's hope that one day the MNR/DNR will listen better to the people that spend the most time on the water."
1100749,Jimmy Jig,2009-04-28 08:23:00,1905,"I see no need to change the law, no one ever keeps a walleye over 18"" now! As long as none are being kept no need........"
1100798,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-04-28 12:15:00,138,"OK, here are my two cents. First who keeps a 23"" fish for a trophy? If the ""one fish over"" is so you can keep a trophy make it 28"" or higher. I agree with most on here that a replica is a better option. Second is the 4 fish limit. My group likes to eat walleye but, 6 guys X 4 fish each is too many to eat in a day. I would buy the conservation licenses but i want enough fish for a meal with my wife and kids when i get home. What I would like to see is a 2 fish per day limit with a possession limit 6-8. This would reduce the number of fish being taken over a week yet allow you to share with the folks back home the wonderful eating we experience. What do you guys think?"
1100800,Guest,2009-04-28 12:19:00,0,"Have never been to Lake Seul but my only question would be: ""Is there netting taking place on the lake?"" If so, I would keep and eat anything allowed by law. Unless forced to by regs, I have no intention of releasing a large fish just so the netters can kill it. Otherwise, I keep enough 14-16"" fish to eat and throw the rest back. Haven't brought back a fish from Canada in 15 years. But I have eaten a 26"" walleye for supper on a lake with nets and it didn't (and still doesn't) bother me a bit. A reasonable slot is a good idea but a waste of time if the lake is full of nets."
1100825,Guest,2009-04-28 14:34:00,0,"Yes there is netting going on, but not sure what species is being caught. I've seen white gallon jugs in Steamboat and Mackenize in the deepest part of the lake, 60-90 FOW. Usually in late August or early September. Can they harvest walleyes or are they after whitefish? Would like to know!"
1100863,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-04-28 16:27:00,100,"The netting is for whitefish, on Lac Seul and Big Vermillion, in very deep water, in the fall for a few weeks. There do get, and are allowed a very small amount of walleye in their catch. I feel that it is a good thing, seeing as the entire system is over run with whitefish...somebody's got to keep their numbers down.The locals native do net close to the reserve, but I have never witnessed any abuse on their part, and they are just mainly netting for a feast.I have never seen much for netting on the East end, just the MNR and their studies, a few times."
1100878,eyefanatic,2009-04-28 17:23:00,25,Walleye Wrangler - well put!
1101338,Guest,2009-04-30 08:54:00,0,I hear this every year on this message board. All the left tree huggers want everyone to use barbless hooks and give the fish a kiss before returning them. Hey if ya catch the fish you should be able to eat it. Ok I agree with the one over 21 rule but lets not get crazy. Next you people will want to just take pictures but limit them to 4 and none over 21. Give me a break
1101376,JDP,2009-04-30 10:14:00,1457,"I believe the last MNR survey of Lac Seul was around 1995 or 1996. The purpose as I recall was to evaulate the impact of the slot implemented in 1991 (18"" -21"", not so much the impact of one fish over 21"" since that implemented in June 1993 I believe). I would hope that the MNR would survey Lac Seul and connected waters, study the data, then seek input from folks such as SeulAreaGuide and others before making any changes. Has Lac Seul been surveyed since the mid-1990's? I know surveys are expensive and the MNR is pulled in many directions. Perhaps the resort, lodges, etc. could find a way to raise funding/or otherwise assist in a survey. (I believe they assisted in the last MNR survey). I agree with the position that almost all of the walleyes over 21"" are currently being released. Thus, the impact of a change to ""Nothing over 21"" will most likely not be significant. But, perhaps if a survey was completed other population issues and solutions could be considered as well. I would rather see the MNR make the decisons based upon science and experienced user input than each resort/lodge owner establish rules for their respective resort guests. JDP"
1100346,LIKEWALLEYE,2009-04-26 19:52:00,70,"With all the great electronics out there and all the top of the line fishing rods, all the quality fishing line and walleye sites like this. We learn every day how to better your self on catching fish. Imho we become very advanced with all the great products. We need to give back to nature to balance out the sucess rate. I love to eat walleye myself, and not totally shutting down walleye consumption . Im all for catch and release in any form. Every little bit helps. I would love it if i can still catch walleyes when i retire. Good luck walleye fisherman"
1100384,Raybob,2009-04-27 06:03:00,3661,"I agree, but make sure that the Bio-Guys keep tabs on the Eyes, so it doesn't become a stunted/small eye area down the road... enjoy those shore lunches"

Since the slot limit was put in place in NW Ontario, the fishing has gotten better every year on most systems or at least the ones I have fished. However I would like to see a one fish ""over"" (for the week) for mounting purposes only. Most of the replicas I have seen just don't look realistic to me..."
1100399,granddrifter,2009-04-27 07:13:00,23,"I think the 18"" slot limit is a great idea as long as it is supported by science and not emotion. The group I have been going to Lac Seul with hasn't kept a fish over 18"" for years and generally just keep a two fish limit for dinning at camp or shore lunch."
1100406,stumcfar,2009-04-27 07:42:00,451,"In around 10 years of fishing on Lac Seul, I don't believe we have ever kept a fish over the slot. Maybe that says we are poor fisherman, because nobody has caught one big enough to be tempted to keep it to mount!!! To keep one over the slot to eat is just plain ridiculous. We do like those 16"" for shore lunch each day though. It wouldn't deter our group if they changed the regs."
1100430,Guest,2009-04-27 09:01:00,0,"Hey Colin, I was going to post yesterday but figured instead to wait and let the non-residents speak first. Not once in years of guiding on Seul did anybody in my boat take a single fish over 18"", NEVER, nor would I have allowed them to do so. This point has been belaboured on this board for years (I think they've limited the archives, but I said the same thing as you at least a dozen times from 2002-2005), and promoted, if not enforced already, by many of the lodges on the lake. To that extent, it would be a relatively simple change in the regs, however, I don't think it would make much of a difference. There are so few large fish taken these days (thankfully, it took years for the older generation to accept the finer points of conservation), that it's almost a mute point. Furthermore, if MNR was to make such a change, they probably would have done it in the recently completed overhaul of the regs. With the support eluded to above, they would have implemented the change if they felt it would be significantly beneficial (they've been hearing about this very point for years, on Seul and elsewhere). So I would obviously agree with the change, having enforced it as such for years, but it may not make a difference from a fisheries management perspective. An observation that you would be keenly familiar with, is that with more than 10 years now of the slot being enforced on Seul, there are far fewer trophy fish (29"" or 30"" plus) than there was 5,6,7 years ago. That is perhaps where the debate should centre these days, focusing on explaining that difference. For example, some have argued the slot allowed for such a significant number of healthy, mature walleyes to develop (20""-24""), that it caused the older lunkers to be out-competed and to die off. As 'big fish' numbers started going south in 2004, the number of large ""Dragon Fish"" (old, soft fish on their death beds) being caught was increasing in proportion. Now the dragon fish are largely gone and so are many of the 30""+ trophy 'eyes. That's just an example. MNR officials will neither support nor outright reject such a supposition, probably because they are not certain either. One certainty is that MNR has nobody that spends near as much time on Seul as the hundreds of guides on there. The Lac Seul Advisory Committee needs more guides talking with MNR bio's, and far less owner/operators talking with policy wonks. NWO Fishing Bum"
1100438,Guest,2009-04-27 09:27:00,0,I wonder if there would be any interest in a 18 to 26 slot with one over 26 as trophy only?
1100457,Mike Kansas,2009-04-27 10:32:00,1463,"Been on LS for 20 years and I would love to see the slot changed to ""0 over 18"". It would be interesting to see a Biologist study on it's affect. I also think that some restriction on Broad & Sunlight could be made."
1100462,Hump,2009-04-27 10:40:00,578,"Our group never keeps anything over 18"". The more fish thrown back, the better it will be."
1100478,Obabikon,2009-04-27 11:32:00,2370,"That would probably be the most logical... in my eyes. There's definately a need to keep an ""eye"" on the breeding. Even a lake can get over populated... and having a TON of huge walleyes will have an affect on the lake. (it's not always positive) All in all, I think if they have conservation on the mind, and watch the lake carefully... this should be a good idea."
1100227,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-04-26 11:21:00,100,"I have recently heard some thoughts on changing the slot size for walleye on Lac Seul, and MAPB lakes to NONE over 18""As a guide of 15 years, I have seen a change in my guests; 60% keep their limits to bring home, and 40% only eat shorelunch, and release everything else. I try my best to discourage taking one over 21, unless it is badly hooked. I know some lodges/fishermen never take 1 over, and some always do.The one over 21"" was implemented for the chance of harvesting a trophy for the wall, but in this day and age, Replicas are better...and there really is no need for it. Imagine the fishing if ALL of the big walleyes stayed in this already great lake!I would like to see everyone's opinions on this.1. Would this regulation make anyone out there stop coming to this area?"
1100237,twobearlake,2009-04-26 12:05:00,379,It would not deter me from heading up there. More big walleye on that huge body of water sounds good to me. TB
1100271,Fred_G,2009-04-26 14:27:00,908,We've been doing it for years on St. Joe. The fishing gets better every year.

1100279,Guest,2009-04-26 15:21:00,0,"I think that would be a great idea. I remember Lac Seul pre slot days, pretty bleak. Along with that I think they should make Broad lake and Sunlight lake a sanctuary in the spring. These two lakes get way too pressure. Open them up the 2nd weekend of June. Lac Seul is getting alot pressure latetly, and I've noticed not as many big fish being caught."

The further north you go the more fragile the fishery. Look how some MN fisheries all but collapsed years ago and are still struggling to get back after over harvest. Pooch"
1100303,joeman79,2009-04-26 17:11:00,417,"Come to Kansas and see how it ruined our Lakes. They just implemented a 18"" Minimum on Glen Elder my home Lake. I asked the Biologist why and he said it was the states decision not mine.. I just shake my head and dream of my week in Canada. Ks and Nebraska are home to the biggest fish hogs in the world. Our lake is finally on the comeback basically cause nobody fishes it anymore and they put on a 18"" Minimum Length Limit. KILL THE BROODERS!! Makes sense KDWP"

1100323,lassh,2009-04-26 18:35:00,553,I'm all for releasing all of the big walleyes and pike. Its made a big difference on the fly in lakes. Leaving the big fish in the gene pool is good for the sport.
1100341,2746,2009-04-26 19:31:00,3206,"We make 2 or 3 trips annually to Canada, always to Lac Suel or Gullrock. I can't remember the last time anyone in our group has kept a walleye over 18"".... It has to be 10 years ago or more. Along with many others, we've also experienced the quality of fishing in Gullrock due to the camp association's limit of nothing over 18 unless it's a trophy for mounting. We fish out of Five Lakes Lodge and I can't remember ever seeing anyone taking up the offer of keeping a trophy, although I'm sure there have been some. I think a regulation like the one you describe would be widely accepted."
