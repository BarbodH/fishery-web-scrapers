1193172,pikeandtina,2010-04-25 15:18:00,145,I appreciate everyone's advice and offers to help. We ended up going to Bear Lake Wilderness Camp in Espanola and had a great time and caught lots of fish! Loved it so much we are going back June again. Thanks again!
1078926,pikeandtina,2009-02-05 21:40:00,145,Can anyone give info about this outfitter? How is the fishing? How about staying aboard the houseboats? Thanks in advance!
1078933,phishfearme,2009-02-05 22:18:00,1242,"my group was among the first groups to fish at ray's back in the early 70's and we went there for almost 20 years straight. so, my info is dated but i can give you some history. when ramsey lake first opened there were no walleye (they're not native to the spanish river area for some reason) and we would easily catch 50-100 pike a day without problems with many 15-20 pounders. ray would guarantee 100pounds per person per day and as far as i know no one ever complained. in the late 70's early 80's, the MNR netted tons of walleye from bisco lake below the dams in the spring and coptered them up to ramsey - after a failed stocking or two, the walleye finally took and within a few years the pike practically dissappeared and the walleye were everywhere. i tell you this because once the walleye became so numerous, so did fishermen and illegal roads into the lake. previous owner's dynamited the roads but to no avail. our last year there (1992) we actually saw some people water skiing up in cat bay. we've never been back since '92. and the walleye fishing the last few years was poor. pete and thea riche sold the camp last year i believe and the new owner is almost gauranteed to be better. we've used house boats (very cramped and very little worked on them but it did provide isolation) but it is MUCH more comfortable at the main lodge - in either of the two upstairs cabins. the lake is hugh and it's easy to get lost. the full plan is a deal - you cook but they provide the food. ask the new owner for referrences of people who were there the previous year around the time of year you're planning and you should be able to get more recent fish reports. i know from one of the previous owner's that fishing took a dip a number of years ago because ontario hydro let the level fluctuate wildly - yes, this is a reservior - not a lake - and spawning was impacted. i've seen afoot of water going over the one dam and i've also seen the shore in front of the cabin so far away that it was a long walk out to the boats. hope this helps aliitle, phish"
1078983,northernbite,2009-02-06 08:19:00,1186,I have been going to this lake off and on for 20 years. We tent camp on the differant islands and always enjoy our selves. One year the fishing can be great and then the next year you think it is fished out. I live in Pa. and it is a nice 10 hour drive for us. Big pike are scarce and walleye can be small. I think it depends on the weather and the number of people coming in. Some years you don't see anybody and then something changes. I'll be going this summer again. As I tell people I know it has a mistic about it that keeps me coming back.Paul
1079180,pikeandtina,2009-02-07 08:44:00,145,"Phish and Ramsay,Thank you both for the informative and helpful replies. We were intrigued by the pantry and outpost/houseboat. However we wanted some isolation and decent fishing as well. I am the ony one in the group who has fished Canada and I really want this to be a good experience for the others.We are also considering Bear Lake Wilderness Camp as well.Thanks again,pikeandtina"
1079928,northernbite,2009-02-10 11:39:00,1186,In the area where that house boat is moared I don't think you will see many boats or people. I'm talking maybe 2 or 3 depending when you go. Don't go the first of July or Labor Day. The walleye fishing can be really good some years. 2 years ago my partner and I had a 100+ day.Last year the best day was 50.Paul
1081116,gary2242,2009-02-14 18:12:00,49,"HiDon't gamble with your only fishing vacation. There are tons of camps with awesome pike and walleye fishing or other species. I manage the web sites for over 200 lodges here in Ontario so if you tell me exacly what you want in regards to fishing, accommodations, distance, price etc...etc.., I'll give you the addresses of a few lodges that meet your specification. My email is [email protected]Never go to a lodge that is within 30 miles east of a big mining operation unless they are on a lake with a high flow river system. Acid rain from mining has killed quit a few lakes. The prevailing wind comes from the west in Ontario thus pollution heads eastGary"
1132974,IRISHATTACK,2009-09-01 05:09:00,44,"The new owners are great. I have been there 4 times over the last few years. The cabins or living quarters are just fine, very warm and a good hot shower. The food plan is well worth the money. However, the fishing is not that great. Walleyes are small and can be hard to find, i bought a really nice fish finder and only marked a few fish. Now, with that being said weather plays a huge roll on how many you are going to catch. We have always caught fish, ate fish and took fish home. I think a tighter slot limit would help, and yes there are the great days of 20-50 fish, just not many. As for pike, i personally know a guy whom has never caught anything over 30 inches in 20 years. The big ones are there, however very, very hard to find. If the owner would go to no pike taken out for 5 years that place would be great. I recommend this place to anyone looking to have a great and easy vacation. People who want big fish and more fish need to go somewhere else..."
1192949,halfmoon007,2010-04-24 23:28:00,121,Well its 2010 and i been going to Rayscamps.com for 20 years. And if your any kind of a fisher its always been very very good walleye fishing. You don't go to a lake for 20 years if its not.We travel 10 hrs. out of southern mi. and tear up the walleye. The slot was the greatest thing canada ever did for its fishery (sorry to se it go ). some days we had a hard time cathing a fish small enough to eat. seen days on ramsey our arms got tired catching 18-19 ich walleye's. Have never used a minnow in fact the last 3 years we have abandon the night crawler for mister twister sassy shad plastic grubs. Yes some days / years you have to think out of the box thats walleye fishing. Find that 10 foot hump the size of a school bus in 35 ft. of water and stop and check it daily and move on. 90% of people dont have a clue its there. A 100 $ graph is all you need. Forget marking fish just fish the contour of the bottom. I thank god my Brothers taught me how to walleye fish or I would sound like all these other posts sound. Going to fish ramsey email me at halfmoon007 at aol.com. and Ill tell ya like it is....Halfmoon
1193025,polaris-pete,2010-04-25 08:40:00,343,"I have fished Rays when the original owner had it and then when Pete and Thea had it.I was there every year for 9 years straight and caught lots of walleye and many large pike.It USED to be a great lake to fish but had gotten to the point where if I was looking, it sure would not be this place.The last time we were there the fishing was terrible and lets just say the owners were just as bad. Hopefully the new owners treat you better. The barge ride from Bisco and scenery are unique and when we fished it access to the lake was hard to get but there are numerous logging roads in that area now and all the locals fish it heavily. Hopefully where ever you do go you have a great trip.I have fished Ontario for 37 years and if you need anymore info just let me know and I will see if I can help you."
1193133,PIKEMAN330,2010-04-25 13:07:00,101,"Well lets see, thats 5 no's and 1 yes. With all the thousands of lakes in Canada why go to a so so lake, unless you just want to relax.Do more research and find yourself a really good lake.Dont be afraid to drive a little farther.It can be well worth it.Just my opinion.
