We have had very little rain this spring and the area is seeing fire restriction already. Fishing Season Opens up May 15th for walleye fishing."

Or water levels are down 1.5 feet on Pakwash Lake compaired to Normal spring levels and compaired to the last two flood years it's very low. Lake of the Woods Water Control Board has the entire outflow for the region at an unusual low for this time of year waiting for Spring rains. The last two years June and July were very wet months. Mother nature has control."
