I know for the last few years bringing leeches into Canada was a no-no, But this leech bedding seems to say it may be OK if the leeches are not in water but in Bedding like Crawlers. Has anyone done this, I have some very tasty jumbo's that I have personally trained to entice willing walleyes, I would like to bring along. But will pass if a hassle. Thanks Spike"
