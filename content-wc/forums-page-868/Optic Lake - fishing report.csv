531992,Thumper,2003-06-05 12:00:00,133,"Just got back from my first fly-in fishing trip. Oh boy, _that_ could become a habit!! We used Viking Outposts to fly into Optic Lake in Woodland Caribou Provincial Park in NW Ontario, about 30 miles West of Red Lake.The cabin is newly rebuilt after having had a fire there a couple years ago. Very nice cedar cabin, 3 bedrooms, sleeps 6. Tounge & groove paneling with a 55-inch spread moose rack. Cabin located on a thin penninsula with a dock on the sheltered side. Great view but they outfiters should have cleaned up the remains of the old cabin, there are plenty of boards with nails strewn around the camp that pose a safety issue, and piles of ruble that decrease from the aesthetics.The outfitter claims that the best fishing is off the dock. We tried off the dock and the bay that it faces frequently, and in varying conditions. Not a nibble. The bay is fed by a channel where we say a few small northerns and walleye, but they were hard to catch and we only landed a few there.Optic Lake (North and South) never yielded the pike action I hoped for. Mostly small ones in the 20-25 inch range. We were right at the end of the spawn, with at least 1 fish milting after we caught it, so there _should_ still have been some larger females in the shallows, but we never caught any. I'm not an expert, but I'd assume that the lake doesn't hold an abundance of big northern.There were numereous slot-sized walleye. Most fish coming in from 5-10 FOW caught while trolling Rapala minnows and shadraps. Blue or Black backs were good performers depending on sky conditions with some coming on firetiger or perch, also. Jigging with minnows, worms or plastics in the areas that were producing trolled walleye was very slow. Largest walleye was 28 1/2"" taken on a black-back Floating YoZuri Crystal Minnow 4 1/2 "".The portage of Glenn Lake produced more consistently with the Northern, though there were still not any significant size. There did appear to be more Pike breeding habitat there. Also, a 50-incher was taken and released by an angler a few days before we arrived. also produced numbers of walleye in and above the slot.Bottom line - if you want numbers this is a decent trip.- RT"

532080,Thumper,2003-06-09 07:29:00,133,"There did seem to be some lakers in Optic. While fishing the shallows for Pike we had numereous times that the lakers would follow the bait up to the boat. Then while dangling the bait at the end of the retrieve they'd usually just swim past the lure. It took a couple passes before we realized what they were, not being used to seeing trout swimming where the Northerns should be mating. Our group only had 1 taker. A 3lber taken on a YoZuri Crystal Minnow along the base of a cliff while trolling. Trip pictures are at:http://www.torgerud.com/Photos/Photo...ing/Canada2003http://www.torgerud.com/Photos/Photo...anada2003Garry I have to alternate vacations with the family, so can only get up there every other year. I'm greatly looking forward to 2005! - RT"
532090,phishfearme,2003-06-09 13:51:00,1242,"rick - cool photos on a great website. by the way, how did your preserved minnows work? i just did a mess using your recipe and decided to only put a few into the freezer and the others in the ice box. i think the freeze/thaw cycle just weakens them alot. thanks, - phish"
532178,Thumper,2003-06-11 10:25:00,133,"Aww, shucks... Thanks! I didn't catch anything off the preserved minnows up there. I only tried them once, though. At the pool at the base of Edgar Falls (beautiful) I tried both the minnows and the nightcrawlers and didn't have any luck (or with anything else I tried there). However, the crankbait/floating-minnow bite on the rest of the lake was so good that I hardly used any jigs at all. I should have taken out some of the big shiners to use on a quick-strike rig for pike but never got around to it. I also should have used the preserved fathead minnows and jigs for walleye after dark, but there's not a lot of dark up there in May/June, is there? ;-) Even though they were frozen, the couple I did use seemed to hold up pretty well. Let me know how the frozen vs. 'fridged experiment turns out. The bear that ripped into our freezer didn't seem to care much for them - he passed right over them to get to our frozen pizzas. But who can blame him - I never order anchovies on my pizzas, either! ;-) Just 2 more weeks 'till Bow Lake, eh? Have lots of fun up there!!! I'd like to hear how you do. - Rick"
