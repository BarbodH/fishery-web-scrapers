Can you make it through the trees by the camp with the low water, and is it generally safe getting around the lake with the water levels?"
531987,Guest,2003-06-05 14:22:00,0,"Eyedude, here's an email I received from Spike. When are you going? We'll be in Dryden(visiting Melissa @ Hubers for diner & cocktails) on the 21st and @ Mahkwa 22-26.MikeHello Fishing Pals, First Let me tell you all that Spike Makes His Bass Tourney Debut Sat June 7th In the Gander Pro-Am Circuit, Check Gandermountan.com for results, (Its My Birthday the 7th) Just got off the phone with Mahkwa lodge, The water has been slowly rising, but is still very low. Boats can get into the lodge bay Now? The docks are in place and chained out so boat parking is fine. Landing the boats at Archie's landing is also being done with no problems at this time. The fishing as always is very good right now and it is possible that the bay fishing we have had the last few years may be off this year as fish may be out in deeper water, but I'm not betting on that. Can't wait for Huber's and the dancing monkey!!!!! Lets hope its cooler this year. Spike"
532056,Guest,2003-06-08 16:31:00,0,"We'll be there the 14 -21st. You won't even be able to read my report. I'm suprised no one else has posted. Got a lot of info last year from here, and Pierre never seems to return my calls or emails. So how about it guys, anybody been up there? Anyway thanks Mike, and I don't know who Melissa is and never been to Huber's. Are you recommending we should check it out?"
532062,Guest,2003-06-08 19:22:00,0,"Eyedude, yes Hubers is in my opinion (an opinion shared by the other 12 members of our group)the finest eating and drinking establishment the Dryden area has to offer. The last few times we have been there we have been treated to one of the nicest & friendliest hostest/waitresses I have ever encountered in my travels by the name of Melissa (not to mention that she's cute too!) and this is before a week in the bush. Hubers is on Wabigoon Lake East of Dryden almost to Dinorwic. 800-665-2257 for reservations Mike"
532094,whitetip1,2003-06-09 14:55:00,53,"Eyedue, If Spike and his crew recommend it, it must be good. I've had the pleasure of meeting some of them at Mahkwa last year and from the looks of it they know what they are talking about when it come to food and drink!!! Spike bass fishing!! Next thing you know he will get rid of the Warrior and buy some fancy metal flake boat made for worm pitchers. Have fun at Mahkwa...the fishing is awesome but that ride on the dirt road sucks. Dave"
532120,Guest,2003-06-10 10:27:00,0,"Just got back from Mahkwa. The sand bar in the bay will give big boats a little trouble, but you can get through. The stumps just before the bay are no problem. The water is 3-4 feet down, no way is it the 8 feet I have seen reported. That is nuts. Maybe 8 feet from the all time highest water, but 3-4 feet from last year at most. The back bays are not producing the big girls anymore, but we did great on eyes up to 27.5 and gators to 37.5 (a 40.75 was caught on the main lake). Pierre I dont believe is with them anymore. The dock situation is ok at best, there are not enough docks for the number of boats. We pulled up on the backside of camp, and that worked great. If you decide to try that, there is a TERRIBLE rock off the point in that bay. Swing VERY wide or you will be very sorry. Percy almost hit the thing as he forgot about it. They are going through 1 prop per day on their rental boats, that about says it all. We never touched a rock, but we know the lake pretty good as we have been going up there a long time. Anything else, let me know. Oh, Archies gas is $4.25 a gallon and I dunno if he sells leeches, we never used them. I stopped using minnows after the first day and only used a twister tail and before long my whole party was doing the same. The fastest fishing we had?? 61 walleyes boated in 2 hours between 2 guys, and if I do say so myself, my partner was lagging behind my rate. All in all a great trip to a great place."
532157,Guest,2003-06-10 22:20:00,0,"Hi Guys, Geez good thing I turned this darn thing on once in a while its good to my fishing pals haven't forgot about me. Day Off tomorrow Pre fishing for the Krauss/Anderson Walleye Tourney this weekend on Bemidji, Not Fishing in it just providing a decoy boat to lead pack chasers astray, You know fish dead holes while the buddies home in on the hot spots, You know me If anyone can find a patch of dead water its me. Less than 2 weeks to go. Mike, are you meeting jolly roger on the way? Coming up through Bemidji? Maybe I catch a ride with ya and Nickster. Bust some jams and all that. I need to win that reel of mine that Dad donated for me as prize for the big eye. Don't really need it but causes me pain to think of any of the lesser talented in the group having such a pretty reel. Whitetip1, where are you off to this year? Where ever i'm sure the eyes are in for a serious workout. Talk to you all soon, Spike"
532166,whitetip1,2003-06-11 07:21:00,53,"Spike, Going to still be on Lac Seul, going up to Chamberlain Narrows the last weekend of June - July 3rd. Going to concentrate on some Muskie along with the baitfish (waldo's). Was up at Cass last weekend and one of my boys nailed a 46"" on his 3rd cast. It was awesome!! How's the new store going? I will be up at Cass again in July, maybe I will stop in and see you if you are working. Take care and be easy on poor Melissa. Dave"
532171,Guest,2003-06-11 08:19:00,0,"Whitetip1, The store is doing well and soon I will be able to enjoy life in the northland a bit. 3rd Cast! He should have gone to town and picked up a lottery ticket for all of you! The muskie fishing has been a little slow with the cool weather, lots of follows but only a feew fish landed being reported. Big and Plantan, have been pretty active But a lot of boats out on Bemidji Lately, Pretty much walleye tourney boats but that will be over shortly, This weekend should bring some warm weather and spur some action. Have a great Trip to Chamberlain Narrows, A group of guys from Gander Goes every year and they do extremely well. est of luck, Let me know how you do. Spike"
