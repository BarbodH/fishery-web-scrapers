532006,Guest,2003-06-07 06:35:00,0,Always used good ol' Trilene XL 6lb. test for jiggin' walleyes and 12lb. test Trilene Sensation on m trolling rig.

Perfect for jigging--no stretch--quick hookset. Perfect for trolling cranks--fish hook themselves. Same with lindy rigs. Don't set the hook to hard. With virtually no stretch, and 14 ld test, it's easy to rip the hook right out of the mouth. In gin clear water, I would use Berkley Vanish florocarbon or similar line. 6 lb for jigging and 8 to 10 lb for all other applications."
