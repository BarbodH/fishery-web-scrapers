532191,TomPGrouse,2003-06-11 14:14:00,124,What is the price for a liter of gas Fort Francis? Thanks
532195,Guest,2003-06-11 16:54:00,0,"I'm not SURE, but I think it was about 79.9. I stopped at that bait shop/gas station on the north side of 11 a few miles outside of Ft Frances on the way to 502 on the way back down. I wanted to see if they had a lure I've been looking for (the didn't). So I got gas w/the rest of my Canadian money."
