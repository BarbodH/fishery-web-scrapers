However someone told me that Canada is almost exclusively Digital so I'd like to know if I upgrade to a digital phone (via Verizon), would I get a signal I could use from the middle of Big Sand lake? (or anywhere there abouts?) IaCraig"

532142,iamwalleye1,2003-06-10 16:31:00,1589,Last year we found Verizon worked around Minaki. I don't know if it would work up on Big sand!
532169,Guest,2003-06-11 08:03:00,0,Craig.......I have an AT&T cell phone and have never gotten service up on Big Sand. I have gotten service up on the hill by the marina boat yard in Minaki but never on the lakes.
