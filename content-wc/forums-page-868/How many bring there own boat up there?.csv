My father and i have been going for about 5 years now and we end up bringing our boat up. mind you it is not a 1850 with a 90 or anything that big, just our 14' aluamcraft with our trusty 25h.p. We travel to alot of lakes when we are up there and rarely fish the lake we are located on(Sturgeon). So my next question is how many of you travel to different lakes while your up there or do you just hang out on the lake the resort is on. Thanks for the input,Bryan"
531984,phishfearme,2003-06-05 09:20:00,1242,"bryan - this is only personal preference but i just wouldn't travel as far a i do into canada only to find that there's a ""crowd"" on the water. ""crowd"" by my groups standards is anybody other than us so we always fly-in or portage-in and rent boats/motors. - phish"
531985,VMS,2003-06-05 09:32:00,1103,"Every year we go, we pull our own rigs. We stay on an island 17 miles out on the lake to get away from people and be in contact with the really good fishing.Granted, pulling your own rig puts a bit of stress on equipment..especially if you have to go down dirt roads, but it is well worth it when some places have poorly maintained equipment.It also allows us to save on costs. for our group of 10 this year, a 10 night stay, with two nights in a hotel due to travel is only $300..less if you use your own boat, truck, etc. It would be nice to NOT use my rig in a sense though...saves on prep time and is less to take along...but where we go, you cannot rely on their equipment, and..the pricing just keeps going up every year.steve"

I like to fish a big area so can cover more territory with a 60 hp than a 9.9 to 25 HP camp boat, much faster. We used to haul portable fish finders, trolling motors, and batteries with us but now, all of those are mounted in my boat."
532136,IaCraig,2003-06-10 15:00:00,434,"I have always brought my own boat. I am familiar with my motors, my electronics, I have more storage and I can cover more area more quickly. Also on those rare occasions when we fish with 4 people, my 19 foot boat works out pretty good. If I figure in the extra gas to tow it, and the extra gas my boat burns, I doubt if it is much of a savings though. (especially if you divide the cost of rental 2 or 3 ways). IaCraig"
