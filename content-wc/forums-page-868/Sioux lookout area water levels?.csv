532108,Guest,2003-06-10 06:27:00,0,"Just got back on Sunday. Abram and Pelican are down at least 2 feet (maybe a little more), Minnitaki is down at least 6 feet, Vermillion is near normal and Lac Seul is down about 8 feet (according to those that fished there, I didn't). The chute is passable if you keep your speed up. I went upstream at 40 mph with no problem but coming back down I was talked into taking it slow and nudged a rock (only cosmetic skeg damage). Weather was warm and calm putting the fish deeper than I expected. Moose Bay was hot when we got there but had died after a couple of days. Alcona had also slowed right down as the water warmed. Best fishing for us were the points beyond the railroad bridge on pelican and Botsford Lake."
