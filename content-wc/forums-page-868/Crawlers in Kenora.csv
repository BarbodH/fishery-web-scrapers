532113,tjsker,2003-06-10 07:57:00,301,I'm deciding if I should bring crawlers up with me or buy them from a bait shop in Kenora. Can anybody give me the names of baitshops in the Kenora area to call for prices. I'd much rather buy my crawlers up in Canada and forget about the hassle of transporting them. FYI - I'm buying crawlers for three group of fishermen.

They also have a decent selection of tackle as well. Or if you are coming into Kenora from hwy 17, then Redden's by Longbow also carries bait. They have always had quality live minnows. Hope this helps. Fish ON!!"
