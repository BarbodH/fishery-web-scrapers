532103,Guest,2003-06-09 19:54:00,0,"I need help, and soon! My future brother-in-law has just agreed to join us for our annual fishing trip to the Clearwater lake chain, and he brought something to my attention that I need help with. Hopefully anybody out there with similar situation will advise..... It seems that about 20 years ago he was busted with a 1/2 pound of weed and got a felony conviction for ""intent to deliver"". He has been an outstanding citizen since then, but my question is will this affect our crossing into Canada? I know I have seen a million threads on DWI's, but does anyone have any feedback on this particular situation? Any input would be greatly appreciated. Baxman"
532104,Guest,2003-06-09 20:51:00,0,"If he isn't driving the vehicle and the vehicle isn't his, they won't know who he is. I don't know the specifics on what that conviction will do but I would certainly not try and do anything to raise the suspicions of the guards. Answer them truthfully and look them in the eye. I'm sure they are well trained to look for a 'lying eye'. I crossed the border the other day and had left my boat in Canada as I am coming back in 1 week. I heard you aren't supposed to do that and if they know they would have made me drive back to get it (3 hrs each way!) so I made sure I left my sun glasses OFF and answered all her questions appropriately and truthfully. Every vehicle that crosses the border will have the license plate entered into the data base and any problems with the vehicle owner will come up. At least that is what I've been told. Don't try and be smart and sneak any bait in or too much alcohol etc. I have crossed the border many times but it has always been w/my wife. This Friday I will be with my cousin. I don't know if they automatically will give a closer look to 2 males vs a male/female. Good luck."
532105,eyedoktr,2003-06-10 05:25:00,2426,"Why not just call customs and ask them? You don't need to give names or locations of where you're crossing, or when. If it was me, I wouldn't take the chance of having the trip ruined by being turned back. I want to know ahead of time that there will or won't be any problems. My guess is that with that small offense being 20 years ago, the crossing will be approved. BUT....that's just my guess. (I have a Canadian buddy who wasn't allowed into the states for years because of a similar offense but can now travel freely)."
532109,Trailerguy,2003-06-10 06:40:00,1407,"Canada veiws felons as undesirable guests, so they turn them around and send them home. That said, rebelrn, gave you good advice."
532111,VMS,2003-06-10 07:29:00,1103,"I would call the border patrol and get some information on felony convictions and what he would need to do in order to be considered O.K. to cross. I would NOT take the chance of being in the passenger seat, or back seat because at times, the border patrol will do spot ID checks. A few years ago, our whole group had our ID's checked with a delay of about an hour. They check the ID and it will be a guarantee of a turn-back situation, and probably a tear down of your rig which will ruin a trip for the group. Cover your bases before hand, do as what they need you to do in order to make all things legal. Hopefully you have some time to get things straightened out before the trip, if there are any glitches. Steve"
532112,Guest,2003-06-10 07:44:00,0,I believe your brother in law won't be allowed in. 1/2 pound of weed is a very serious offence here in Canada. He will need a waiver to legally enter. He might make it thru customs without being asked but if you get stopped by the police for whatever and they do a check or even a fishing liscense check he could be thrown in jail for awhile.
532117,bigfish1965,2003-06-10 09:36:00,3210,"Why wouldn't your brother-in-law get a pardon after all these years? Seems like if he's been a good boy all this time, it would be easy to get."
532118,Limiter,2003-06-10 10:19:00,6,mmm
532119,Guest,2003-06-10 10:27:00,0,He has about as much chance of getting into Canada as anybody with a drug conviction has at getting into your country. He should get a pardon and then go there. I understand you can't get pardons for drug convictions in your country and you are also disenfranchised for a felony conviction.
532126,Guest,2003-06-10 11:42:00,0,You mentioned a license plate scanning. Some states don't require a front plate. do they scan the rear plate?
