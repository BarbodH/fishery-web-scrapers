Throw in about 200 Smallmouth a couple big Pike and Lakers and it was great trip. We were fishing in the Whitefish Bay, Sunset Channel area. Jig and Minnow in 20-40 ft water all day long."
532093,Stevie B,2003-06-09 14:27:00,157,"I will be up at LOTW this weekend. What where the smallies biting on? Where did you find the northern (weeds, rocks, etc.)? Sounds like you had a great trip. Looking foward to the weekend!! Fish ON!!"
532101,bronzeback77,2003-06-09 19:28:00,97,"Smallmouth were hitting on Pumpkin and Watermelon Grubs, and Crome and Black Jerkbaits. I caught 60 bass in about an hour and a half off of three boat docks over about a 60 yard area, on the grubs. Caught Pike in the Weeds and on the rocks, bigger fish were holding to the wind blown sides of reefs in about 15ft. Caught several over 35 inches. Of course I am sure the water temp has risen and the Bass are probably either spawning now or just finshing up, Pike probably still in the same areas maybe a little deeper. I caught all of my big Pike on 12 inch soft Jerk baits in Black and Shad color. And several other nice fish on the Crome and Black Jerkbait while fishing for Bass. Where are you going to be staying and fishing at on LOTW. Hope you are into catch and release I want those fish to be there next year. FYI-The water was about 3 feet low when we left last weekend, I don't know if there has been much rain but be carefull not to hit anything."
532106,Stevie B,2003-06-10 06:14:00,157,"Thanks for the info. Hopefully we can still get into the bass. Yes I am a ""catch and release"" fisherman. Except for the few odd walleye for the pan in the evening. But who doesn't do that???? I will be staying on Longbow Lake just east of Kenora. It is a smaller lake that connects to LOTW. It works out really good for me. If the it is really windy and I don't want to be on LOTW than I can fish Longbow all day and not worry about not being able to get back to camp. Fish ON!!"
532107,bronzeback77,2003-06-10 06:24:00,97,"Good Luck, I caught most of my Bass around Timber, Anne abd Bell Islands, that would be a pretty long haul from Kenora, but I am sure there are great areas up that way as well."
