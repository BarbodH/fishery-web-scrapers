532087,Guest,2003-06-09 11:56:00,0,Well just returned from outstanding fishing up in northwest Ontario. The weather was in the 60's and 70's and sunny all week except for 20 minutes of rain one afternoon. No BUGS !!!!!! Just out of this world compared to the normal. Lakes were in little low but didn't seem to change anything! Two of us caught so many fish it just seemed you had to stop to take a break. It was unreal. We had 32 pike over 35 inches and 12 walleye over 25 inches for the big boys but the numbers under them were off the scale. Hope everyone has a great time this year up there. Thing I caught a new world record Pike in length. It measures 56 inches. Had a 16 inch pike on and half way in a 40 inch pike took a bite around the head and gets hooked up also. Equals total length of 16 + 40 = 56 inches. Has to take pictures of that one.

532135,phishfearme,2003-06-10 14:13:00,1242,"w.c. - yah, i hear you about way north. we were there a number of years ago when kevin and debbie opened the place. what a great set of lakes. did you get to setting net? i ain't seen better pike and walleye than that lake has. also, we really objected to having that darn electric generator running from 7am to midnight and we were in cabin 1 right next to it. did they finally do something about that? and, we just couldn't seem to get a boat to fish south trout and when we finally did, we caught a ton of lakers and a 30"" eye!! those were our only complaints. - phish"
