We always find them in 14+ feet of water, off of the edge of weedy island slopes or mainlake points that drop down into the mainlake. I woulds start there. With fall fast approaching(Or already there) in NW Ontario, it would be worth a shot going a little shallower up but concentrate most of your efforts on the deeper weedeges."
