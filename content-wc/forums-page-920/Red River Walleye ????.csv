524344,Guest,2002-10-02 05:54:00,0,"Was on the red for three days. yesterday was by far our best day. two of us caught 14 walleye in about 7 hours and one was 28"". caught them all on salted minnows. we fished a lot of spots but close to bank with some rock worked the best. wish we were still there after a decent bite the last day."
524345,Guest,2002-10-02 16:47:00,0,"Was on the Red today and pretty slow all around, saw a few 20+ Green Backs get landed and had a 24 put in our boat by the partner. Only action was up by suger Island.MTF"
524332,Eye Catcher,2002-09-23 10:36:00,85,"Glad to hear the someone finally stuck their finger in the leak and the sewage dump has stopped. Coming from the Milwaukee, WI area I can tell you that the Sewage Distric in Milwaukee has dumped that much sewage into Lake michigan Several times a year for the last few years. The effects on fishing seem to be negligible but it has played havoc on the bacteria levels on area beaches. Speaking from a little experience, I would not let the spill stop me from going fishing on the RED. Uh wait did I say that. Let me try that again. I wouldn't advise fishing the Red this fall. The fishing will probably suck up there any way. Stay away. Especially Oct 11-20.Good LuckEye Catcher"
524334,srj,2002-09-23 14:38:00,971,"Eddy, my duck buddy and I are thinking of taking a day to fish cats the week of Oct 14-18. Without a boat on our hunting trip we are thinking of hiring a guide. Any recommendations?Thanks."
524335,Guest,2002-09-26 09:40:00,0,"Went to end of main and didn't to to well. Got 5 greenbacks and the biggest on was 22 inches. This last week has been very cool at night. In the tournament on Sunday on the Red River, and I will let you know how the fishing was.Good Luck!!!!!!"
524336,Guest,2002-09-26 09:49:00,0,"Is there a tournament this weekend on the Red, and out of where?Thank you"

524338,Guest,2002-09-27 06:11:00,0,"Picked up 7 greenbacks yesterday morning. Biggest was 28"". looks like the wheather is only going to get colder and the fishing only better."

524340,Guest,2002-09-27 07:43:00,0,"Big Eyes, Didnt take any pictures. Waiting for the Big Girls to move in for that Kodak moment. They should be running hot and heavy in the next two weeks."
524341,Backwater Eddy,2002-09-30 18:19:00,3871,"Well you didn't miss too much if you were not up on the Red River at Selkirk this weekend, it was a slow bits. We had fun but the fishing could have been much better. The weather was too darn nice and the wind switched from N to S on Saterday, the Red then fell 3-4' in one day, thats a bad deal Eh.Pine Falls had some good action on Friday and Saterday, I have had no word on the bite after Saterday. Some big fish were caught on jigs way out on the bay. Cooler temps would help and a GOOD N wind too.Water temp was 51 when we left this morning.Ed CarlsonBackwater Eddy...><sUMo>"
524342,Big Eyes,2002-10-01 08:20:00,1,Does anyone know where I can find the results for the walleye tournament held on Sunday on the Red in the Selkirk area? Thanks
524319,Guest,2002-09-17 15:05:00,0,"Todd-NE, Thanks for the fishing tips. I will trust your judgement and give them a shot. Have you heard about the sewage spill in Winnipeg? If so do you think this will be a problem. By the way Im bringing my BIG Sister for your BIG Brother. She is 6-8 weighs about 325 (In the Buff) can bench press 500lbs and was the biggest Navy Seal to ever put on the flippers. But tell your Brother she has a nice personality and three of her original teeth."
524324,Backwater Eddy,2002-09-17 15:43:00,3871,A WEEK!They better get a freaking plug in it faster then that....EH!!!!What the #%#$#$%!Do they have one valve on the whole system or what?They better contain it fast or risk a very bad situation with all that raw sewage under the ice on the lake unable to breakdown properly in the winter months. That could be a huge environmental disaster for the lake!They better decide to treat it as a hazardous waist spill and contain it FAST!:(Backwater Eddy...><sUMo>
524325,Dan,2002-09-17 15:56:00,325,"I'm amazed that they don't have a back-up system or some place in Winnipeg to contain the gushing 'leak' in the meantime.This has got to have quite an effect on the fishery. I wonder if we're going to see an honest assessment of the damage done or if all we'll get are casual comments like ""... a high flow upstream will help dilute the sewage.""Dan"

524327,kevin,2002-09-18 13:28:00,74,Picked up a few Sauger yesterday and one Greenback about 6lbs. Saw some other Walleye being caught in other boats. Should pick up in a couple weeks.

524329,Backwater Eddy,2002-09-20 03:30:00,3871,"Lockport Canada [email protected] Thursday September 19, 2002 07:28:52 PM Latest on the trials and tibulations of the Red! As of approximately 5:00 am this morning, they stopped the flow of sewage from entering into the Red. ( Prayers answered)! Lets see what type of penalty will be handed out too the city for this outrageous and incompetent act! I only hope that the powers too be act in the best interest of this incrible resource. There has too be a strong,clear message sent that this type of negligence will not and cannot be tolerated. No exceptions please! On a more positive note: (fishing update) Fished for 'eyes late this afternoon from 5:30 til 7:50 pm. There were two of us and together we managed eight walleye, twelve sauger and three large kitties. All fish were taken on 3/8 oz. orange jigs tipped with a salty. We fished just north of channel marker 38. Depth was twelve feet. In a nutshell, the event that has just taken place hasn't seemed to have any negative effect, (thus far)! Another foot note: The cats are absolutely nuts! I mean they are spanking any kind of quality cutbait such as goldeye or tulibee. We're finding them in shallow aswell as deep water. One angler claims to have caught seventeen cats on corks near the eastside rock pile below the dam. He claims that he was only there less than an hour before his bait (goldeye) was depleted. Til next time, Stu McKay ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Howdy Stu Great news on the spill being stopped Stu! Lets hope they lean from this and get the system set so no more leaks EVER happen again. The Red is a tough girl, she will outlive us all, if we treat her well. Eh...by the way Stu...the cats are going nuts here too. Been fun working jigs and frogs, they ""THUMP"" them hard like a hungry pike. It is fun watching the cats at night chase the frogs and jigs right up onto the shore to hit them, like teasing a cat with a ball of yarn....EH. God I love fall! See ya soon.

524313,Guest,2002-09-17 07:14:00,0,Heading for the Red in a couple of weeks and was in hopes that some of the local Walleye fisherman might have a update on the Greenbacks....thanks
524314,Todd_NE,2002-09-17 08:06:00,1330,"Todd,I'd appreciate it if you would register a name or indicate something more with your name since we share the same given name :) Some people, particularly when talking about the Red/Winnipeg might get us confused. Especially if you are a big overgrown Oly looking camoflage wearing ""you all"" with a suburban and a FX18. (quit laughing Rob)Don't misunderstand, I'm not telling you what to do just asking you to consider this in the future.Have a good one. The fishing there can be incredible!Todd_NE"
524320,Guest,2002-09-17 08:24:00,0,"There are walleyes in the river, caught some as early as mid August. As of now I've been told lots of sauger, and at the locks the 'eyes have been caught. Most figure by the end of the month things should pick up."
524321,Guest,2002-09-17 08:31:00,0,For up to date reports on what's happening on the Red have a look at the fishing Manitoba page: http://members3.boardhost.com/fishmanitoba/A lot of local guys are posting reports all the time.
524315,Guest,2002-09-17 09:19:00,0,"This is a real problem. Imagine our Mothers both naming us Todd. Seems to be only one way to settle this. I will be at the ""RED DOG SALOON"" in Selkirk on Oct 6th at 7 pm with my Shimano tied on...man on man...only room for one Todd on this site....Go Penn State"

524323,Guest,2002-09-17 13:43:00,0,"Dan, Thats kind of a s---- deal. Hope they get that fixed quick and the Walleyes go by sight not smell."
524318,Todd_NE,2002-09-17 14:44:00,1330,"If you keep a stringer of 15 pound greenbacks.... you'll already be dead by someone elses hand by the time I get there :)Besides, I'm the small one in the family. My brother got the ""big"" DNA. He makes a 14# walleye in his hands look like a #9 Shad Rap.Best of Luck. Don't forget prop and rattlin' jigs when fishing the Red. Glow and Chrt/Org or Green seem to be good with Pink up there some days. As has been said many times, if the jigging gets slow don't be afraid to pull some shad raps or wally divers upstream. It's best to dig bottom occasionally but not so hard as to lose a lure every 50 yards.T"
