524626,Guest,2002-09-29 14:23:00,0,"Was in Pine Falls and Traverse Bay Sat the 28 of Sep, launched at 7am came back in at 6pm, caught one 17inch Wally. Was very slow going talked with some boats that had nothing all day. Wait your two weeks and it should have cooled down abit.Mike"
524627,Hawgeye,2002-09-29 14:42:00,1355,"I just got home. I was there from Thursday afternoon through Sunday.(sept 26 - 29) I fished for 4 hours on Thursday afternoon from 1-5 and got one 20"" walleye and a couple of drums. Friday was prime time...my boat caught 40 walleyes that day running cranks in Traverse bay with the biggest being 29 1/4"", 27.5"", 27"" and 26"". Only 3 of those fish caught were under 17"", the rest from 18""-23"". On Saturday fishing was a little slower but still steady on Traverse bay. Picked up 20 fish all day and they ranged from 18""-23"" with only 3 under 18"". One HAWG broke off at the boat, it was surfaced and I am sure it was 30""+. Did not fish Sunday (today) since I will be heading back up on Thursday. They are definately going some on the bay...the river is not. We found a pattern and others did not. I would say of the 100+ boats out on the Bay, 30% were successful. Can't wait for piggy piggy next weekend!!"
524628,Hawgeye,2002-09-29 14:44:00,1355,PS. Water temp was 58F on Thursday and down to 56F on Saturday.

524630,gms,2002-09-29 18:49:00,91,"Fished Traverse Bay Saturday (Sept 28) (Trolling Cranks and Jigging) and only caught a handful of smaller greenbacks and a little sauger. All were jigging with salted minnows.Did witness a number of big walleyes getting taken on cranks Saturday but watching the 80+ boats in the bay, I did not see too many landing nets coming out. Been to Pine Falls enough to know what a good day and a slow day looks like and I would rate this as slow.Regardless of it being a slow day the weather was great and there was barely a ripple on Traverse Bay early in the morning. Nice just to be out enjoying the sport.Watch out for the nets at the river mouth (50'37.696"" North, 096'19.050 West) and the one just north of the Traverse Bay rock pile (50'38.844"" North, 096'21.846 West)Only disturbing thing of the day was watching a group filleting a load of large greenbacks (definetly over 4-5lbs) in the parking lot, there were a number of gentleman and kids around so I'll assume that everyone in the pack took out a 22inch plus fish.....unfortunately I could not prove they were poaching otherwise I would have call the TIPS (Turn in Poachers) line and turned them in!"
524631,Hawgeye,2002-09-29 20:27:00,1355,"As much as I am in agreement about not taking the bigger fish, I cannot fault someone if they are legal. Of the total limit of 12 fish that my party took home, only one was over 22"" and it was 23"". I do not make it a practice to keep fish over 20 and most of my fish kept were between 18 and 21. Since only 4 fish are aloud, keeping a few at 22 is not an issue. For those who take children with so they can fill their limit with 5+ pound fish, they should be ashamed. In response to Slickster, we ran around 2.3 GPS ground speed and pulled the cranks at about 65'-75' back on 10# fireline running the new sunfish colored #9 Shad Rap. Pearl also caught a fair share and even picked up a few only running 40' back on the Bomber Long A. There were some buddies that did all right on taildancers too."

524635,fishcop,2002-10-01 08:01:00,11,"GMS, and any other angler observing a possible violation;if you think that a vilolation has or is occuring, please call the TIP line or the district office (in your angling guide). Let us be the ones to decide that an offence is or isn't occuring. It's easier to check at the time it is happening, rather than 2-3 days when we get told that someone saw another angler keep an overlimit (believe me it happens lots, however it is usually too late to do anything) Remember, the fishery resource is everyone's to enjoy-lets ensure there is always fish to catch, game to hunt!"
