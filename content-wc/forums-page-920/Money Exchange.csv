Also, when you go to the beer or liquor store, you can buy your beer and liquor with your ATM card and also ask for cash back. That way you can purchase beer and liquor and ask for $100 cash as well. The transaction gets debited from your account immediately at your bank's exchange rate and you kill two birds with one stone."
524655,River_eye,2002-10-02 10:19:00,1486,"Credit cards still charge you a fee. There is no way to actually get the real exchange rate, unless you work at a bank and the fees are waved."
524647,Guest,2002-09-30 15:18:00,0,Going across the border at Pembina N.D.where should I exchange money? Probably go across around 6PM.thanks
524648,Guest,2002-09-30 19:43:00,0,"Exit to the right just before you cross the border, there is a gas station, they also sell liquor,beer etc. and they exchange money. They give a fair rate of exchange, just crossed there 3 weeks ago and the exchange was 1.52. , almost as good as you would get in a bank. Make sure you get enough to get you through, because every store has its own set of rates, one may give you 1.35, the next 1.40."
524649,Guest,2002-10-01 06:36:00,0,You should be able to exchange at your local bank - saves you a stop once you're on the road plus you get the best rate
524650,jason,2002-10-01 07:10:00,12,I would agree to go to local bank and use credit card whenever possible. Have a good trip.
524651,fishnut,2002-10-01 09:31:00,46,"I tried something new last week when I went through Fort Francis. Went to an ATM at the bank there and used my cash withdrawel card from my local bank. Worked fine I withdrew $100, Canadian of course, and when I got back my bank statement showed a charge of $64.21 which is equiv to almost 1.56 which is better than my local bank direct. I had checked prior to leaving and the bank wanted to charge me $5 handling.I also agree to use credit cards as then you get the actual exchange."
524652,Guest,2002-10-01 10:01:00,0,"The best, easiest and fairest way is to bring along your ATM card and make the withdrawl at any bank machine, which are found virtually everywhere - gas stations, liquor and beer stores, smoke shops,shopping malls, grocery stores etc...If you want an even easier way, when making a purchase, use your ATM card and it'll be debited right from your account. The exchange rate will be on your next bill...which will be the bank's rate."
524653,Guest,2002-10-01 15:01:00,0,"I think the last time I went across the exchange at the gas stations in Pembina was better than my bank. Could that be so? I think that I also paid a fee to have money exchanged at the bank, by exchanging at the gas station is there a fee? I plan on fueling up there any way so making a stop is no big deal. It has been awhile since I went across so need some help...."
524654,Guest,2002-10-01 21:46:00,0,"The current rate of exchange has been bouncing from 1.57 to 1.58 and back for about the last week, so if they give you say 1.52 then that is their fee, all of the above posts are good, whichever way you choose."
524656,BD,2002-10-01 22:30:00,739,Make sure you have a Visa card along. A Master Charge card isn't accepted everywhere. Many places off the main roads can't take them because they have radio telephone service and Master Charge needs to be entered into the system via a land line in order to validate your purchase. Visa doesn't need the instant validation. I learned this the hard way. I had to drive all the way back into town to get cash to pay my resort bill.
