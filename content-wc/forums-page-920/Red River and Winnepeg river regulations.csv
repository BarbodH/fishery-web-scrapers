(Though why would you want to keep one that big, it wont taste good) but is it true that you can only keep one walleye a day over 22 inches?Is there any other special regs for these rivers that I need to know about?Thanks"
524645,Guest,2002-09-30 14:40:00,0,The regulations I have allow for four walleyes per day ( conservation Licence). One can be over 28 inches for the season. I do not recall a minimum or maximum slot in addition for the Red river. There is a slot limit for the Winnipeg river in the Pine Falls area. Page 14 of the regulations discuss some exceptions. So its important to get a set of regulations. Good luck will be going up 12th through the 16th of October.
524646,Guest,2002-09-30 15:09:00,0,"You may keep 4 fish per day with only one being over 22"". You may keep one over 28"" that would be your fish over 22"" and you must mark your lisence. Of the 4 fish per day, your total possesion is the same so if you keep 4 fish and don't eat them, you are done."
