We head out to Traverse Bay and fish the reef with the rest of the boats. When the fish are in, it's great, when they move off the reef, which they seen to do for no reason, we don't do too well.Where do they go when the move off the reef? Does anyone fish out past the nets? I seldom see boats out there.Any tips on fishing the river? I don't want your hot spots but would like to know what kind of structure and depths you look for. Sunken islands? Off Points?Any ideas would be appreciated."

They probably move cause the ##### is turned on/off & the current is affected! You gotta take the weather into effect as well! If a cold front comes through you're best bet is took look for shallow points with deep water close by & jig them vertiaclly (don't troll)! There is a great spot in the river (just before you enter the bay!) As you head out there is a point to your left where a number of 25in.+ came up last year & has always been a hot spot for me! If you're looking for the monsters stay in the bay & work the flats with raps by both rock piles! If you want quantity rather than quality stay in the river & find yourself a nice hidden rock pile! There are ton that come up to about 10ft. (even 8 some places) & jig the crap out of them! I've been doing well every year for the past 6 but you got be constantly changing your presentation!!! REMEMBER TO CRIMP YOUR BARBS DOWN!!!! $50 PER HOOK & A RAP WITH SIX HOOKS COULD BE SPENDY!!!!
