524477,Guest,2002-09-27 08:04:00,0,Our group from Michigan has flown seven times with Leuenberger's to six different lakes. Have had great service good cabins and boats and great fishing every time. I do not hesitate to recommend them.

524479,Buckeye Twister,2002-09-29 17:43:00,0,"Have used their services for the past 5 years at Kayedon/Ogoki Lakes (connected). Their camp is on Kayedon. They only have one cabin there. It will sleep up to twelve, but 6-8 is best. Nice porch and view, screened fish cleaning house, and a good bit of room on the inside of the cabin to stretch out. Three bedrooms with two bunk beds each. It has solar lighting which tends to be dim, a propane fridge, and stove and best of all a hot shower!!! I usually go the latter part of June. Depending on the mayfly hatch, fishing can be sensational to fair. There is a slot limit for fishing. Species are mostly walleyes, and pike, but there are also brook trout and whitefish and some perch. Always see moose, and an occasional bear. New motors on the boats this year, and the boats are Lunds. River is shallow and tends to have big goonie rocks in expected and unexpected places. Always need to run with the motor on tip up. Boats, usually need some repair. It is a good idea to bring along some type of silicone patch or weld that is easily applied and will remain water tight for your stay. Any more questions, feel free to ask."

524481,Guest,2002-09-30 05:29:00,0,"Never fished Jemar, but fished Samuelson 15 years ago. It had an older cabin back then but I see that they have totally rebuilt this 5 or so years ago. Now it is one of their more deluxe accomodations so I am sure it is nice. When we fished there it was our first trip to Ontario and we were walleye fishing rookies (I had only caught one walleye in my life prior to that trip). No depth finders, never tried jigging before and we only new how to troll with crawler harnesses. Nonetheless, I remember the fishing being good for walleye and very good for pike. We landed several northern in the mid-thirty inch range and the biggest was 39"". The lake had several large moderately shallow bays that were good for casting. That's about all I remember."
