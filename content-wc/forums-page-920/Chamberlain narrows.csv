524210,fishnut,2002-09-26 08:54:00,46,"I thought I posted this yesterday but I don't see it. If it gets posted twice, sorry.Just returned from Chanberlain, tough weather, lots of wind rain sleet and ice on the boats in the morning.Lots of fish, the last day my boat 90 W.E other boat 80 but not much size. Only maybe 10 fish over 18"" and the largest, a 27 was caught by my son-in-law while fishing the rapids coming into Scaler Lake casting for Pike with a twin blade bass spinner in 4 ft of water???One nice Pike 38"" caught in China Lake. Most eyes caught in 15-20 ft of water in main channels. Most days you couldn't fish where you wanted, only in protected areas. Went into Wapesi with no luck.I ""found"" the rock on the left as you enter Scaler lake, good to have a second prop to take me through the rest of the trip.Except for the weather it was a great trip, lots of fish, good walleye dinners, great fellowship. (Thats what its all about)Regarding the road situation we went up 71 by L.O.W. and came back 502. I clocked 65 mi farther up but better roads. 502 wasn't bad only a couple of areas where they were replacing the guard posts and crews had you stopped for short periods for one way trafic.Anyone else going up before they close drop a line to let me know how you do.The Fishnut"

524212,Guest,2002-09-29 17:58:00,0,"Gee, must be nice to have exclusive rights to Lac Seul....."
524213,Guest,2002-09-30 19:24:00,0,Its against the law to hunt Moose out of boats unless the boat is at anchor and the motor is out of the water in Ontario. Do you guys obey this rule on Lac Seul or what?
524214,livewire,2002-10-01 09:46:00,10,well got back saturday found the water temp at 64 when we went in and 53 when we left had a great trip and 12 1/2 lb'er walleye being the biggest and a 45 lb musky what a great time as in the the other post it was windy but still found the fish off the rocks and reefs in 25 -15 feet of water. last day was 75 just a beatiful day enough too make us want to stay... until next year thanks for all the reports...

524215,fishnut,2002-10-01 18:49:00,46,"Hey Livewire, where did you fish??Fishnut"
524216,Guest,2002-10-03 22:13:00,0,Where did you pull the 12er from???
524199,Guest,2002-09-11 13:07:00,0,Going up to Camp the last week in September just wondering if anyone has any walleye reports for that area Thanks Livewire
524200,eyewitness,2002-09-11 15:58:00,680,"Fish Scaler Lake....24-30'flat on the east/ SE side of the island. Also, fish the east side of the narrows just as you enter China Lake and all the way into China for big pike. They're up in 3-8 ft of water amongst the stumps and weeds, and they're everywhere...bigguns' too! Also fish the 24-30' deep flat off the west end of the big island splitting Wapezi Bay. Find the deep break line and work or anchor and jig/minnow fish it. Plenty of nice eyes there. Lots of 18-24's plus the occasional piggy. Was just there a couple weeks ago. Have a blast...sure wish I was going back this year...."
524201,Guest,2002-09-12 17:53:00,0,Thanks for the info we always take one day for scaler..... did you fish too the south at all? and how high is the water and the road conditions on the way up ??? 502 thu the night.... NO MOOSEY's wanted. thanks again for the responce
524203,fishnut,2002-09-13 09:30:00,46,"I'm also going back next week. I'm familliar with both Wapesi and Scaler lake but haven't heard of China lake. None of my maps have it named. Can you give me directions/dist from camp or locate near some more well known spot?We've also caught some smallmouth (and Eyes) where the Vermillion river come into Scaler.Thanks, Fishnut"
524202,eyewitness,2002-09-15 23:20:00,680,We drove 71 up this time and I think it will be my road of choice till 502 is completed. Nice drive and about a 1/2 hour longer only. Water was up earlier this season but is back to normal now. We only fished by the island in scaler as we spent most of our time in China lake. Good luck!
524204,eyewitness,2002-09-15 23:23:00,680,China Lake is through Scaler all the way to the south down the narrows. Stay in the middle and there's nothing to hit. Watch for deadheads of course.....
524205,Guest,2002-09-16 08:11:00,0,So 71 was a nicer road to go... Is there much road construction on 502 ????
524206,eyewitness,2002-09-16 08:41:00,680,"About 10 miles worth of gravel I guess. The delays aren't huge, but they put this stuff on the gravel portion to keep the dust down and when it gets wet it is really hard to clean off your truck and boat. I'd rather drive the extra 1/2 hour then spend it cleaning....Also, the scenery on 71 and 17 to Dryden is beautiful. Just watch your speeds in the posted areas as the OPP is out and about...."
524207,Guest,2002-09-16 14:31:00,0,"Hey Eyewhitness,Are you saying that driving route 71 instead of 502 is only 1/2 hour longer? I always thought that it was more like 2 hours longer. I only did it once and that was my memory. Let me know please.Thanks!Milfish"
524208,eyewitness,2002-09-16 17:49:00,680,"It is only 35 miles longer in distance than 502. You can verify this on mapquest. Although there are are a couple spots to slow down to 40 MPH, most of the driving is at 60 MPH and 65-70 MPH on Queens highway #17 to Dryden. 502 is really a 40-50 MPH drive on average, and the construction will slow you down even more. The difference in time isn't that bad really. The payoff is that 71 and 17 are really nice roads with no worrys at all. If you hit that gravel on 502 after it's rained or after they watered it down to keep the dust down, you'll be spending a lot more time cleaning up your rigs than extra driving time. The calcium silicate they put on the gravel is he!! to get off your truck and boat. If you've ever experienced it, you won't even want to go there....trust me."
