524659,BD,2002-09-30 20:38:00,739,"We stayed at Finlayson Resort and Campground about 12 miles north of Atikokan.Monday --- We had time to fish for only a short time after we arrived. We fished Finlayson and picked up enough eating size eyes for supper. Jig and minnow was the bait used.Tuesday and Wednesday --- We fished Marmion for northerns. They were really hungery. We released all of them over 27"" except one 39"" that was hooked to badly to survive. While fishing for the northerns we picked up a 10 lb. eye and several smallmouth in the 3 to 5 lb. range. Mirrolure 111MR-21 plugs (best) and Rapala Magnums were the baits used.Thursday --- We fished the Seine River for eyes. We caught plenty of eyes and smallmouths but none could be considered piggys. Jig and minnow was the bait used.Friday --- Back to Marmion for northerns. It was a repete of Tuesday and Wednesday with a lot of big northerns and some nice smallmouth. We were able to release all of them successfully.Saturday --- We waited for a storm to end before going out on Dashua. I picked up a 24"" laker and some northerns on a Mirrolure OOM-RT jointed crankbait. The lakers were just starting to move to the shallows. We had to quit early and pack for the trip home.Sunday --- Home again. I'm tired of eating fish after having them six days in a row. My wife had different ideas and I had fish for supper again. Good thing I didn't bring very many home."

Seems like every post I look into has your kind of garbage added to it. All I can figure is that you don't know how to handle your jealousy. I know I'm jealous of his trip but didn't feel the need to post trash.thanks for adding to my blood pressure today.lobo1"
