This post would likely only interest fellow Manitobans anyhow...In regards to an earlier post of mine this past June (""Manitoba Taxidermist""), concerning rates for replica fish mounts. Pricing for Hawkins Taxidermy of Winnipeg was mentioned. I went to their store last week to confirm pricing of their replica mounts for a Pike I caught in June. Their replicas ARE now being done in the USA and it is ten American dollars per inch. Quite a bit more than I can afford. I didn't get into duty or taxes, I just left. Their skin mounts did seem competitively priced though. Further, Telesky had much cheaper replica prices, although I can't recall the rate, other than it was a few bucks an inch cheaper. I've yet to check out Starodub's (spelling?)"

They are horrible!!As w/ everything you get what you pay for! Now my concern is with my 30"" walleye do I get skin mount or a GOOD replica? Of course by the time I catch one replicas could be much improved!! I guess I'll worry about it when or if I get one."
