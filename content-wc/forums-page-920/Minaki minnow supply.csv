524482,Guest,2002-09-27 07:48:00,0,I'm leaving for Minaki on Oct 4th and I've just heard that good sized minnows are in short supply at area bait shops. Any suggestions on where to look preferably between Kenora and Minaki? We'll buy in bulk and keep in an aerated coolers if needed.Thanks in advance!
