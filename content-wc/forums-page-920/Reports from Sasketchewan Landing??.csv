524475,Guest,2002-09-27 05:45:00,0,Will be up near Sask. Landing north of Swift Current hunting for waterfowl in 2 weeks. Usually wet a line in the river from Sask. landing. Anyone have any reports from this area recently on the walleye/sauger and rainbows? Last we heard fish had moved upstream from the dam and were likely in this area? Thanks for the help.
