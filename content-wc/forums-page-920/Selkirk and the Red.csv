524664,mhumpal,2002-10-01 20:25:00,19,Bad news for me some partners backed out on a trip because of work. Good news I am looking for someone to take a couple of rooms off my hands. Two Queen beds in each room. Rather than just cancel I thought In would offer them to someone that would like to go fish for large green backs. These rooms are at the Daerwood emailme by Thursday at [email protected] or [email protected] and we can make some arrangments to get these rooms in your name. I am not looking for any money just someone thats looking for a place top stay in Selkirk if you have been there you know that rooms can be scarce.
