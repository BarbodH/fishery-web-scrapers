Are the greenbacks moving into the mouth of the river yet? Would hope this latest cold front would push them in with fall rapidly approaching. What has been most effective for the presentation, crank bait or live bait? Jigging or spinners with lindy rigs? Can a person get salted minnows in a larger size and if so where? Water tempeture would also be nice to know in order to determine effective bait presentation. We will be staying in Pine Falls.Promise to post results of our trip upon our return to the states. Hope this will be an encouragement and an honest approach to helping others enjoy the pleasure of fishing.Thank You for your time and honesty in responding to this message.Engineer-1"

Without even knowing the water temp, don't let it hold you back from trying any presentation. Looks like you guys will even get a freeze at night this week.Clarks Corner just south of Pine Falls near the Papertown Motor Inn sells bait, licenses, and a pretty decent breakfast, etc. I hope you have a great trip and look forward to the report.Just remember to be ready for that fish of a lifetime so you can get her back to water quickly!Todd"
524431,Guest,2002-09-23 14:38:00,0,"Todd-Curious as to your suggestion for live bait on the Winnipeg.Engineer-Looking forward to your posting upon your return. My crew will be up there 10/5 thru 10/9. Will you be trying the Red as well? Hope you are enjoying the Warrior; I miss it a lot. However, I am back in business with a Crestliner Tournament Series.....not glass but seems like a good craft!Jeff"
524432,Todd_NE,2002-09-23 14:53:00,1330,"I think you have a different Todd in mind, I run a Fisher. Local lore and my fishing experience sez livebait at Pine, salties at Selkirk, just the way it works.I'll be up 18-23 @ Pine, don't plan to fish the Red this year.T"
524433,Guest,2002-10-01 16:26:00,0,"Pine Falls fishing update. We fished Thursday evening 9/26/02 with very little success. Few small fish but no great bite for the evening.Fished Friday all day with better success. Several fish in the 20-24"" range with some smaller also. No large fish. Many boats on the water and did not see any 28"" or larger fish caught. Visited with one party that had caught three over 28"" earlier in the week largest being 11 Lbs+ on Tuesday or Wednesday. There may well have been some caught Friday but it was the exception. Water temp was 58 Degree Farenheit morning warming to 60 Degree in afternoon. Most everyone pulling crank baits off the reef to east southeast. Those fishing rock piles gave good reports jigging also. I beleive if there were bigger fish caught this would be the locations.Saturday we fished all day at Pine falls. Beautiful day on the water. Again we caught numerous smaller fish jigging in the mouth of traverse bay with the largest 26"". Still looking for the keeper over 28"". Tried pulling crank bait but did not seem to be working and the boat traffic was very heavy. Needed some one to direct traffic in the lake. Boats going in every direction. Primary pull was to the east from the reef. Sunday we also fished all day but no big fish. Jigging again proved to catch fish they were just not the lunkers we had hoped for. Wind was strong out of the south and the river and lake dropped in elevation substantially. One rock pile we drover over Friday caused our boat to get hung up on Sunday. In that wind it was a little scary. Even when you have coordinates for them you can be caught in a difficult situation. Fortunately no damage to boat was able to trim up motor and drift off. The bait fish from the river must have flushed out into traverse bay because the clutter on our electronics was unbeivable to see. We commented on several ocassions that it would take a determined walleye to find our crank baits in the middle of all the live bait swimming around. The main channel coming out into the lake was the primary location for the bait fish. Just adjacent to were the crank baits are normally pulled.Incidentally geeting the boat out of the water when the channel has dropped substantially from the south wind is a real challenge. The trailer had to be off the end of the concrete ramp to load and with a heavy fiberglass boat it was a challege to not damage the trailer and the lower unit of the boat moter while loading. Wore out my partner cranking the boat up on the trailer. Why don't they lengthen these ramps? I wouldn't mind paying more for a license if I could be assured that I could safely get my boat back out of the water at the end of the day. Sunday afternoon we went to the Red at Selkirk since things had slowed substantially for our boat on Sunday. That was a big mistake as we did not catch anything worth mentioning Sunday evening or Monday morning. Left for home Monday at noon.All in all I enjoyed the trip once again. Would love to go back in couple weeks but with busy work schedule probably will not happen. The true large numbers of greenbacks I beleive are still in the big Lake. Will most likely change very soon as the water temp drops and the days continue to get shorter.Hawgeye: Sorry we did not connect. Our resevations for the Papertown motor in some how got messed up and we ended up staying at the Manito Lodge. Not knowing your real name I felt it would be difficult if not impossible to connect.Wishing all who read this the greatest success and hope that you can land that fish of a lifetime.Engineer-1"

I am not looking for any ones hot spots, just any dangers (rock piles, shallow area's or other hazards) as I have not been there before and as you mentioned there are some hazards to be aware of.Thanks, BD"
524435,Hawgeye,2002-10-02 07:05:00,1355,"Engineer 1,Sounds like you had moderate success. We did manage a few big fish but it is still not going like it can. I looked for you and probably fished around you on the lake. Hey, see ya next year? Goood Fishin!"
