First day apparently is a guided day trip out of the Moose Horn Lodge. Then were on our own for two more days. Looking forward to the 5 day trip with my 17 year old son. He's putting down his guitar and his dreams of being the next Bon Jovi to go, so that's nice. Maybe he can spark up his guitar at the bonfire. I'm assuming a shallow rubber bite, does anyone have any experience at this time of year on these waters ? Leeches,minnows,worms ? Favourite jig colour ? Favourite Rapala colour ? Thanks"
3814785,ftfarms,2015-04-27 05:38:00,444,We fished out of moose horn a few years back. As always gold is my favorite color for jigs and minnow color for rapala for walleyes (early anyway). So I would say minnow are the best that time of year but we use a lot of worms also.
3815121,pjshorthorn,2015-04-27 06:49:00,5654,"First off, I'm envious of your trip to Moosehorn Lodge. It looks like a great place with awesome fishing. Please post a report on how the trip turned out. Over the years of fishing the NE section of Lac Seul, I have been partial to jigs, vs cranks or spinners. My confidence color has primarily been chartreuse, but we have done well on orange, pink, white ( with a plain black eye) and blended colors of blue/white, orange/black, pink /white, green/chartruese. I'm sure there are some color schemes I've forgotten. I have a number of other jig colors like gold, glow white, red, glitter patterns, etc. but never really spent much time using them as the confidence colors have kept me entertained well enough not to use others. As far as the time of year you're going, minnows have been the primary choice with crawlers next and then leeches. This is just our preference and , again, have had enough success to be satisfied. I'm sure others have crushed fish on crawlers or leeches. Attached is a picture of some of the jig colors I like. PjShorthorn."
3815417,Knoxabilly,2015-04-27 08:00:00,225,"1/8 and 1/4 jigs. I like red, red/black/, orange, gold, chartreuse- bright colors! If the bite is good I usually use a bright 3"" curly tail tipped with a minnow. If they're sluggish I lose the tail. Minnows are #1 and leeches are #2- I've never used crawlers up there, though I'm sure they work. 18 days till opener!!!!"
3815449,castnblast,2015-04-27 08:04:00,111,"Definitely have your son bring an acoustic guitar. My kids pack the guitars before they grab the rods for a fishing trip. Soo fun, Have a great time!"
3816113,rockrunner,2015-04-27 10:47:00,205,"Thanks for the tips and taking the time to respond. We're first timers up there and we are really keeping our fingers crossed that the weather is on our side. I know we are packing for it all snow,rain,hot and cold. I will definetly report back and maybe even some pictures or video would be cool. Thanks again."
