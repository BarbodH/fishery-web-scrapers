3836377,kzoofisher,2015-05-04 07:13:00,5144,"I've got the 8th in the afternoon, may be too late. I'm having fun watching it anyway."
3836897,adempsey,2015-05-04 09:54:00,963,I am going to be WAY off. Looks like 2 days of ice left at most.
3836977,Mike Borger,2015-05-04 10:22:00,1554,They made one very large mistake when launching this contest - they didn't mention a cut off date for entries. Soooo....in theory one could monitor the situation then throw their hat in the ring right at the 11th hour. Just saying...
3837297,adempsey,2015-05-04 11:45:00,963,"Oh, I thought they did. Regardless, they can do whatever they want really."
3839193,Mike Borger,2015-05-05 03:37:00,1554,Who picked May 5th?https://www.facebook.com/pages/Brace...47981611920988
3845161,wallydave,2015-05-06 15:08:00,2151,"You called it Mike! Sad to say it was a different Dave that won, those are the breaks! The Facebook announcement mentioned other contests, who knows what can happen next!"
3845353,kzoofisher,2015-05-06 16:16:00,5144,"""Missed it by that much"" Maxwell Smart"
3845785,pitbull,2015-05-06 18:27:00,45,They announced a winner this morning.
3846473,Hawkfan,2015-05-06 21:57:00,237,"I said May 5th, but 2pm wasn't close enough I guess. Can't believe I was that close!"
3846657,Mike Borger,2015-05-07 03:26:00,1554,"Holy smokes, can't believe you didn't win!!!"
3825337,Mike Borger,2015-04-29 16:52:00,1554,"Thought this was worth posting. Brace Lake is running a contest - in fact they just launched it - to win a free fly in trip during the 2015 season. They're asking people to guess when a lure they have lying on the ice completely falls through. Very few people have entered and it won't be long before the ice goes, so pretty decent odds. https://www.facebook.com/pages/Brace...nf&pnref=story"
3825977,adempsey,2015-04-29 19:57:00,963,Cool thanks! Come on May12th!
3826225,Knoxabilly,2015-04-29 20:59:00,225,Thanks Mike- I threw my name in the hat!
3826417,forgop,2015-04-29 22:15:00,880,The odds are better when you don't get several hundred people from here signing up Mike. Duh! LOL
3826554,Mike Borger,2015-04-30 04:50:00,1554,"What do I care? LOL! But yeah I see your point. Regardless the guy just launched this promotion a few days ago and it won't be that long before the ice breaks. It might be your best chance ever to win a trip. FWIW Brace is always the first lake in the region to be ice free. Even last year, they were the only outfitter north of Nakina who flew in on the opener. Had to fly from Geraldton because Cordingly Lake was still frozen.Keep that in mind if you're making a guess."
3826737,bigwalleye1,2015-04-30 06:32:00,2632,NOW ya tell me....
3829137,wallydave,2015-05-01 03:27:00,2151,"If Brace goes early, maybe my May 7th guess will be close!"
3829153,octanehi5,2015-05-01 04:05:00,1104,"Brace is only 50 degrees north, my guess is May 8th"
3835961,kzoofisher,2015-05-04 03:05:00,5144,"ice is down to 6"" and melting fast. Early bird is going to get the worm."
3836025,octanehi5,2015-05-04 05:03:00,1104,I'm going to be close?
