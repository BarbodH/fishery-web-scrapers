3824017,bobbylfishermon,2015-04-29 08:02:00,241,"Hey, Big willies, I don't really know, I saw the video years ago on a fishing show ( Infisherman??) at that time they said it would have been a world record but to verify it, the fish would have to be killed, they didn't want to kill the fish so they measured it and released it, It was a true giant!!!!!"
3824145,bobbylfishermon,2015-04-29 08:23:00,241,"I have 2 complaints about shad raps, if you hook a larger pike or musky(5lbs) or above and they give a good account of themselves, they will pull the rear hook eyelet (wire) through the top or bottom of the tail of the rap,(since they are made of Balsa wood) cracking the tail of the rap all to heck, and now you have a $8.00 leaking piece of junk, my other complaint, Rapala has put a premium price on them, you can buy 2 flicker shads for the same money, and they fish just as well (if not better) than shad raps, just my opinion....."
3824481,ziggyzag,2015-04-29 10:52:00,125,I have been fishing NWO for over 30 years and my go to lure for searching is a Rapala CD #7 in silver & black. Also very good to try the perch/firetiger/clown all in CD#7 I have caught 1000's of walleye and pike trolling these in the spring. Note: I don't think they make the Clown in CD version any longer and that's a shame!!!!
3825297,bigwillies,2015-04-29 16:37:00,515,think thats the one.it is a giant! it's about as big around as a telephone pole.
3826193,1K1MOA,2015-04-29 20:51:00,90,"First on leader question...I use high E guitar strings (.009) and cut them into thirds. They have incredible tensile strength and are incredibly cheap by the 12 pack. They are super flexible (think Santana bending it playing a riff) and extremely thin. They also are extremely resistant to kinking. I think I got my last 12 pack for $5. I use them in Canada and FL keys. I have caught a 250# bull shark on them and nothing has ever cut one, despite how thin. Add a very small ball bearing swivel where the line attaches and a ball bearing snap at the bait side, and you have a great leader rig. If you want more action on lure, attach lure directly and make a small 1/4"" circle and wrap the wire around itself 5 or 6 times. this is very easy to do if you hold the loop with a pliers and just use your thumb to push the wire around in a tight wrap. The size of loop on the package picture below is a little big, make your loop smaller so the bait doesn't move so much it catches the leader when casting.For shallow water Walleye I love Bomber Mini A and Model A's in crawfish and firetiger. The mini's run a couple feet down and the model A's about 4 - 8, depending on retrieve speed. These are floating baits that really let you work a shoreline."

3827473,RapShad,2015-04-30 10:33:00,76,"After all of my experience in LS in June, you have to be ready to fish for walleye in varying depths of water this particular time of the year has a HUGE impact on June. Shad raps #7 firetiger are my go to, Lac Seul has a ""tea stained"" color due to it's sandy bottom, so using bright colors are a good option in depths where walleye are in less than 10 feet. If they are in particularly shallow water and in the weeds I have found X Raps are a good option although I usually tie them on to my pike rig because pike love to target schools of walleye in the shallows. If they're down deep I'm trolling wally divers, although to be honest I'm usually bottom bouncing in this situation."
3842633,TomSnout333,2015-05-05 21:50:00,2,"Besides the obvious minnow/jig combo which works well most of the time, I'm huge on the Storm Thin Fins. Troll em' in about 10 feet of water early morning or night. 3"", Silver with blue back or silver with black back You can't go wrong."
3818457,Jwendt15,2015-04-27 19:33:00,72,"We are heading to Onaway Lodge on June 12 for a week this year. We did a week earlier last year out of Evergreen. Honestly, never felt the need to throw anything other than a jighead and minnow off the points. The occasional spinner or stickbait to go for the bigger pike. I don't really have a huge collection of crankbaits though. If the jigging ever happens to get slow, what size/color crankbaits should I be bringing if I brought a half dozen or so? Anyone have their go-to patters/type around that time of year?"
3818577,bthomas3333,2015-04-27 19:48:00,465,I've caught a good number of walleye on the old fashion gold/black and silver/black Shad raps #5. I tend to troll over the same spots I would jig at a pretty good clip. I've never seen as good results as straight up jigging with minnow as you mentioned. It does work and is good for covering water.B-

3819729,orchard frank,2015-04-28 06:45:00,1900,"Spent a lot of time on LS, always had great luck with Hot N Tots, especially gold/orange and gold/pink. Can cast them a mile, bounce off rocks, trolling, fast or slow. Everything in the lake will eat them. I'm sure other stuff works great too, but the tots worked so well for me that I never experimented much. First time using them was anchored on a reef on a windy day, wanted to cover some water without moving. I think I caught walleyes on the first 6 casts or something, was convinced. Good Luck"
3819929,bobbylfishermon,2015-04-28 07:31:00,241,"I troll or cast Berkley flicker shads, #5 or #6;s in perch , slick sunset, or black&red bellied, they run true out of the package, trolled or casted and they are half the price of shad raps, world record muskie was caught some years ago on a shad rap, by a guy casting for wallys, they recorded the whole deal and took a girth & length and that fish was released, don't quote me , but I think the fish went over 70 lbs., those guys were amazing to release that fish back into LS...."
3820569,benn,2015-04-28 10:17:00,48,"We've had good luck with 5 SR in less then 10' of water on wind blown shorelines. Don't forget the 5 SSR's in 4 - 5' of water or over weeds either! Colors vary, but perch is a go to color. Some days crawfish or firetiger work too. Gold/black is good too. The reason we like shad raps? Because they are easy to troll fast with!"
3821041,Jwendt15,2015-04-28 12:42:00,72,Thanks for all of the info guys. Looks like I'll be getting some SR's and Hot N Tots from Bass Pro on the way up. Are any of you running leaders on these?
3821105,bthomas3333,2015-04-28 12:59:00,465,"Re: Leaders - Are you a gambler? IMHO if you tie the crank on directly you will catch more walleyes. The downside is the pike. One small pike can cost you a 6 buck lure and if you tie into a large pike there is a very good chance it is game over. If I am specifically fishing a walleye spot I will go without the leader and accept the risk, but honestly I think it is probably a lot smarter to use the leader.I haven't seen a recent thread on leaders but I have transitioned over to all Titanium leaders. I used to get 5-10 pikes per cheap wire leader before it was all kinked up from the strikes. With Titanium you can fish all day on one leader. I think it is worth the 10 bucks each to avoid all the re-tying and lures not running true.B-"
3821649,CanoeHead,2015-04-28 16:14:00,22,"I almost always have braid and then some sort of flouro leader, 10lb-20lb. If pike are very likely then I use a tieable wire leader material 10lb-20lb). Subtle lures will still have good action. I've also used heavy flouro 40,60,80lb test on fly-ins but that will deaden the action on a lot of standard walleye lures."
3822105,jaximus,2015-04-28 18:14:00,117,"i like husky jerks and xraps for casting. both suspend and can be worked slow if the water is cold. if you are going to troll, hot n tots and taildancers are my go to. the madflash/glow/UV hot n tots are hard to beat when trolling."
