3810289,Guest,2015-04-25 18:09:00,0,HI. its been 10 years since we fished Canada around lake of the woods and lac saul. then we used a green or yellow fire wire. are those still good lines to use or is there something better? cant wait for june.

I've switched most of my reels over to PowerPro original, in the moss green color. It is much more limp than fire line, casts easier and farther, and is tough as nails."
3811001,clearis,2015-04-25 21:18:00,47,I've moved to Power Pro as well with a 6' flurocarbon leader tied on with the double uni knot. Can also use a small swivel between the lines and reduce line twist.
3811041,Baseline,2015-04-25 21:28:00,3207,I've always used mono Trilene and Gamma which is a mono hybrid.
3812233,pale ryder,2015-04-26 09:26:00,1937,"10 lb. Power-Pro or Suffix 832 in red or yellow. Soft, easy casting, tough.I haven't yet needed a fluorocarbon leader. I just tie the jig or lure right to the Power-Pro.I also carry extra spools with 6 or 8 lb mono. which I rarely use."
3830969,reconssd,2015-05-01 18:20:00,147,"Powerpro. Whether I'm fishing in the lower 48, or in Canada, Powerpro does not disappoint."
3831105,brochet,2015-05-01 18:55:00,88,"look at all the lines available today.the monos are most commonly between 2 to 20lb. ,the braids commonly between 10 to 50 even in a k mart or wall mart.in areas like were I live where there is only a few small lakes .. ill let you guys figure what that tells you."
3831737,octanehi5,2015-05-02 03:29:00,1104,"Suffix 832 Is one of the top braids and happens to be my favorite among whats out there. power pro would be my second choice. I use 6lb for jigging and 10lb for anything else. Tie your jigs directly to the braid no need for leader. I usually get two yrs. out of a spooled line on a reel, after the first yr attach and pull off your line then go to the most used end of line tie back on reel load the reel now your useing the line to its full extent. Braids are expencive get every $ back"
