That would be over two weeks ahead of last year. Last year the opener was interesting, but that made it memorable. Our group caught the most BIG walleyes that we ever caught, despite having to fish from shore the first day.http://yournorthernconnection.com/ca...eather-reports"

3838865,1jigfish2,2015-05-04 20:40:00,110,"Nitroman, things will be a little different than last year. This should put the walleye back on about their normal areas. They should be done spawning or close to it in a few days. Good luck up there, and tight lines."
3842129,Terwalleye,2015-05-05 19:14:00,166,Just talked to Wayne tonight. Says he's been flying with the floats on for a few weeks already. Sounded like they were able to get a lot more done this year than last before the opener. He sounded pretty relieved about that fact.So you opener folks have a great time; catch a bunch and lets seem those reports and pics. We got 5 weeks of waiting to go and your reports are going to have to tie us over.Tightlines

Taking my father in law and 3 of his retired friends up for their first trip to Canada this year so they can scratch it off the bucket list. Should be some good times just hope the fush and weather ars cooperative!
