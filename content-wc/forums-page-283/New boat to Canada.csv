3846425,Jesse-WI,2015-05-06 21:27:00,534,"I found the following for Iowa: Purchase by private sale: In order to register a vessel purchased in a private sale, you must have a registration, bill of sale and title(if it is titled). You must be able to provide these documents to the county recorder for transfer. If the seller doesn't provide you with either of these things, you cannot register the vessel without going through the bonding process (this is outlined below). Otherwise, the purchaser of a vessel with a valid registration from the selling party may operate it for 30 days immediately following the purchase without having completed a transfer of registration."
3847201,bus33,2015-05-07 07:37:00,289,I know the Iowa regs. I have everything but the title....still waiting for sellers bank to send. I'm within the 30 days. I was just wondering how the border agents would react to a boat that isn't in my name.
3847905,Jesse-WI,2015-05-07 09:48:00,534,If you are legal in the your state of resident to operate your boat there should be no issues with Canada. I would have all available documents possible to assist them in understanding you are legal should they actually ask.
3840273,bus33,2015-05-05 08:59:00,289,I bought a new to me boat and there has been a delay with the title coming from the sellers bank. If I have proof of sale will there be an issue at the border? I don't want to get up there and have issues. Thanks
3840353,Shellback,2015-05-05 09:23:00,8083,I've never been asked about the ownership of my boat crossing the border either way. Of course there's a chance they know more about me than I'm aware of. What are you using for registration numbers and current year stickers?
3840377,btyreprich,2015-05-05 09:31:00,1067,"All the years we owned our boat, not once were we asked for proof of ownership. Obviously make sure you have proof of insurance. This too was never requested. Enjoy the maiden voyage!!"
3840385,bus33,2015-05-05 09:36:00,289,It has current registration and numbers from the previous owner. I will have proof of sale and the trailer will be registered since trailers don't require titles in Iowa. Thanks for the replies.
3840465,LOW1,2015-05-05 10:00:00,2828,"I had a similar experience with taking a new vehicle across the border. The officer was extremely interested and asked to see the bill of sale with VIN number and documentation of title being applied for. (I think that Ontario wants to deter vehicles (and boats) from being purchased in the US by Ontario residents who wish to avoid licensing and by US residents who ""stash"" US registered vehicles/boats in Ontario) Once he saw the paperwork he had no issues and sent me on the way. As long as you have paperwork which has a VIN number which matches the boat I think you will be OK - I would make sure if you can that you have a number and not just a generic description such as ""18 foot metal boat with outboard."" Copies of any application for title, etc would be helpful as well."
3840473,ftfarms,2015-05-05 10:06:00,444,I took my boat up 2 years ago when it was brand new with no sticker or numbers on it. Did not have a plate on the trailer. Illinois gives you a paper one and it fell of after a couple of times putting the boat in. I had all the paper work with but know one asked about the boat or trailer.
3841161,MrSimon,2015-05-05 14:05:00,922,"As always, if you have the right paperwork and act normal and polite, you'll have zero border issues. I've taken my boat over numerous times and have never been asked to show any paperwork. Usually they just ask who owns the boat and send us on our way."
3841313,Lovetofish,2015-05-05 14:35:00,458,I was once asked if it was my boat and if I was bringing it back with me. They never asked for the registration but I do carry it with me.
3845313,alanexpup,2015-05-06 15:51:00,278,HI. we checked into this and you can leave a vehicle in Canada for up 3 months with no problem but that was a while ago. we had to have an engine replaced years ago and it was up there for 2 months. no problem.
3845321,Ndstallmann,2015-05-06 16:05:00,549,"Went to Canada with my boat behind my buddies pickup, and they asked who's boat it was cause didn't match pickup owners license."
