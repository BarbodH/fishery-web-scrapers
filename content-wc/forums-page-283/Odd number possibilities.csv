3807753,michigan walleye guy,2015-04-24 19:30:00,95,"odd numbers are a common occurrence on our trips, due to one guy or another not being able to make it, or another guy wanting to join in, creating an odd number. I always volunteer to man the ""solo boat,"" it allows me to fish for a few hours before breakfast, or fish for a few hours after dinner. I fish 12-14 hours a day at least, if I can. My job in camp is to clean the dinner fish and prepare the shore lunch, which allows me to hit the morning bite or fish the evening bite without feeling guilty. Like a few have already stated, all that is necessary is to put some weight in the front of the boat, and to make sure that the other guys know where I'll be fishing. After a few days, there is usually at least one guy who wants to hang around camp, so I don't have to fish alone as much as you might think. But I love fishing alone. Always have. Have had some scary weather situations, but that's another story."
3808041,roscoe33,2015-04-24 21:31:00,653,"If you are going to cover any amount of water, like 6 or 10 miles, opt for the 2 boats. Trying to run WOT on plane with 3 guys, gear, and a 25 is wishful thinking, and the driver is getting wet from bow spray. Otherwise, no problem with 3 in a boat. When we troll, its mostly back troll, one off each side near the bow, me in the back by the kicker. no problems."
3809273,bushead11,2015-04-25 11:19:00,151,My brother in law was the additional guy last year. My regular boat partner added him to our boat but we opted to get the upgraded 18ft boat with a 50hp tiller for an additional $250. Divided by the three of us the additional features on the upgrade outweighed the price. We actually got a slight reduction to our week rate for fishing 3 that also help offset the price of the upgrade. Fishing wasnt hard with fron and rear casting decks and one guy always jigging for walleyes. It worked well for us and the conversation was never dull and there were always hand to help land fish or get snags freed.
3809817,ILScott,2015-04-25 15:26:00,139,"Please Hooks do not cave in and bring a red boat as a partner. They will over run the secret spots. On another note have you checked with the owners to see if another group has an odd number? I probably could find one of my retired friends who has all the secret spots on this lake to go. The sad thing is he won't even show me the spots unless I give him a little Gin. Also, we have fished in those boats with three and it is not bad. We have even trolled for lakers with three in the boat in the narrows with no problems."
3816649,HeHooksHimself,2015-04-27 12:43:00,725,"On point with the red boats, but I have had that discussion before. Search ""red boats"" and you will see. A few people got a little testy with me, but it ended up with a lot of love. Even Ann says, ""we don't own the lake."" She is the one that suggested that someone might even pay for the opportunity for Ole Hooks to show them how to fish WLC if another group has an odd number! We have a possibility of our rookie's son to join us and that would be great. In any case, Doc's deposit is here and if that would persuade you or another vet to join us at the last minute, let's talk! We are going in Friday afternoon(first group of the year benefit) and so we are leaving Valparaiso around noon on Thursday."
3816673,HeHooksHimself,2015-04-27 12:52:00,725,"This is the thread where the red boat controversy began. BTW, I don't really want to resurrect this issue, just showing Scott where it began. Wabaskang, Canyon Lake or"
3845633,derek204,2015-05-06 17:36:00,56,"funny, I went out to Kingfisher on Wabaskang a few years back. Full intentions to fish alone as this was my first ""solo"" vacation. I did fish alone for days, enjoyed myself but having an extra hand in the boat is helpful at times. I had the opportunity to go out with another fellow who's son couldn't make camp. He had spent many trips on Wabaskang and showed me a few things and a few spots which was an added More to the point I had a blast fishing with him and am glad I took advantage of the opportunity to fish with a complete stranger, but fishing alone has it's challenges too. My advice if you can upgrade to a 18ft... do it. If its a 16ft with three benches it's tight but it's nice to be with friends. trolling stay disciplined, driver straight back, other rods straight out the sides, choose different lengths and reel in accordingly when fish is on. If your out Wabaskang Lake way, I'm there may 16-23 maybe see ya out there"
3847353,HeHooksHimself,2015-05-07 07:52:00,725,"We go in the afternoon of Friday, May 22, so we might pass you if you fish at the weedy narrows. We will be sure to nod and slow down for you. As it turns out it is definitely just the three of us- Ole Hooks, my son ""Trophy Netter"" and an old friend of mine from years ago who has never done the Canada thing, we'll call him ""The Rook"" We are opting for two boats, but might fish three to a boat on occasion. In any case we will probably stay together most of the time. it will cost us a few bucks more but we think it is worth it. Thanks to all of the WC friends for their conversation and advice. BTW, we do not have the option to upgrade to anything above a 16' Lund with a 25hp Yamaha. It is what it is. We intend to have a blast! 13 days until departure, not that anyone is counting. Also, 123 days until Century Lodge, a new place for us. Hopefully Doc's wife will be better by then and Doc can hit the water with me. Believe me, he will be ready! Fish On! Hooks"
3802817,Joek3,2015-04-23 12:34:00,244,"If you do 3 guys, I hope you are all experienced. 1 ""rookie"" and things can get tough. Trolling for 3 is out.A few days with 3 is fun. An entire week (IMO) is not fun. I would have that 2nd boat paid for and ready."
3802929,JayM5209,2015-04-23 13:04:00,1050,"Just my personal opinion, but . . . . . in 35+ years of trips to NW Ontario with a group that's usually 6 but occasionally 5, none of our group has ever fished with more than two in a 14' camp boat or any of the 16 footers we take along. Depending on where guys want to fish for the day, it's common for one or two of our group to fish solo for a day. Personally, I would not fish with three in a boat, regardless of size. Pay for the 2nd boat, even if a day or two you want to put three in one boat and leave one tied at the dock.I love the guys in our group, like fishing with all of them, and we always have a great week, but a day or two solo is a joy. Just me . . . . . ."
3802961,smallcal,2015-04-23 13:13:00,119,"We might be in the same 'boat' this summer as well, down from 6 to 5. We have been offered a 16' boat as well but I really don't like the idea.You didn't mention what type of fishing you do - casting, jigging, trolling? We mostly troll with bottom bouncers or cranks so 3 in a boat is next to impossible the way I see it. If I have to go solo, not an issue, means I go where I want and don't have to share my beer!The other side note for you, if you are going from two boats to one, depending on the lake, that could be an issue. If you're running quite a few miles out and have a problem, there is no second boat to go for help or to climb into if things get really bad. Just something to think about."
3803089,tuiflies,2015-04-23 13:45:00,158,"I troll with 3 in my 14' boat all the time. I stay in the center and the other two keep their lines as far out to each side as they can. (If we back troll, the guy in the bow stays in the center.) When we cast, the guy in the middle is pretty much limited to overhand casts straight out the sides but otherwise, it's no big deal. If someone is really new and requires more room when casting, he goes to the bow. Three experienced guys should have no problems."
3803153,Old Timer,2015-04-23 13:58:00,255,"Some of these answers are coming from right field. I've fished for Arctic char with four in a 14 foot boat for a week. And many, many time times for walleyes with three in a 14 or 16 foot boat. Then many Canadian portage, fly-in and river trips with with four in a boat or three in a canoe or Grumman sport boat. Is it ideal? Not exactly, but it has never interfered with catching plenty fish and having a good time. We never have one guy running the boat and two fishing. We all fish all the time. Once in a great while you might get two lines tangled, but not very often. Mostly we jig. Once in a while we pull a spinner with meat. By the way, when you fish with a guide on most Canadian lakes, it's the a guide and two sports in a 16 foot boat. And sometimes three sports and a guide in an 18 foot boat. More often than not, the guide fishes too. My advice? Fish three in a boat and have a good time. I wouldn't have a second thought."
3803169,HeHooksHimself,2015-04-23 14:03:00,725,"Folks, Thanks a lot for your input. For those that say minimize and go with three- I think we might try that for a day or two, as Jay suggested, but we will probably get the other boat just for room and ease of fishing. I like to have a few snacks, some liquid (water, of course), layers of clothing which tend to come off during the day, some hardware (pliers, jaw spreader, lip grip, etc.) a cooler for the catch and some basic tackle. That probably seems like ""the house"" to some of you, but these are the basics to me. If three guys all have that, seems like the boat is crowded. not too bad for jigging, but when the trout are shallow we like to troll and cast occasionally. thanks for the suggestions for weighting down the boat, but isn't there and adjustment on the motor to adjust for single occupants? The suggestion for the fourth person, yeah, that would be great. However at this moment, Doc is ""unsure."" It's pretty hard to convince a guy to wait and see until maybe only a few days before departure. We are already under a month. No matter what we decide to do, it will be hands down better than what I am doing today, which is dreaming on WC rather than doing what I should be doing.....back to work!"
3804673,ftfarms,2015-04-23 20:48:00,444,You bring this up makes me laugh. Not that you are faced with 3 and not 4 guys but we faced that same problem two years ago. So we took my new boat 17' with a 115 optimax all the toys. A boat come with the cabin (boat motor gas minnows ). So we decide to go two in mine one in camp boat. So Steve and Rich draw cards to see who goes by there self for the first three days. Rich lost he goes his three days not a problem. Now Steve goes out in the morning and that was it he was back in my boat and we fished three in my boat the next three days not a big deal but was funny he couldn't go by himself but Rich did just fine. He said he had no one to talk too. Sorry it just makes me laugh. Good luck and god bless.
3805377,UKBDM,2015-04-24 06:29:00,178,HHH ... do you need me to come and show you Wine Lake guys how to fish? Seriously ... have a great time. You guys always do!
3805537,HeHooksHimself,2015-04-24 07:06:00,725,"UK, we have some feelers out, but you know how hard it is to be the guy that might get to go in 26 days. Not many people have that level of flexibility. If you are serious, we should talk. However, I hate to get you Wabby guys too familiar with the bounty available across the portage, otherwise the weekly red boat invasion would turn into an armada and you guys would be camping all over our shore lunch spots! ha ha. And, as I said, we are going to have a great time no matter what happens. Thanks for the love. Hooks"
3806193,Golden Eagle,2015-04-24 09:43:00,2642,is one (1). I do it most Octobers. And it works. Every time. Being the only fisherman on a lake is a great way to say goodbye to the present season and to store memories that carry me to the next season.
3801849,HeHooksHimself,2015-04-23 08:59:00,725,"This year, it appears our group of four may dwindle to 3 because of one of our stalwart's wife having some health issues. While we hope that the situation may change in the next 27 days, we may be left with only three. We only use camp boats which are 16' Lunds with 25 hp Yamaha four strokes. While we have never resorted to three in a boat, I have seen boats with three and I can't imagine trying to stuff three guys into the camp boat for a week. My sense is that it might be okay for jigging but trolling and casting might be a problem. I have checked with our lodge and they will let us have a second boat for an extra charge. My questions are this: When faced with odd numbers, what were your challenges and how did you address them. Did you have one boat for the single fisherman and stay together throughout the day. Did you find a way to make three in a boat reasonable? Any other ideas- what would you do? We are 27 days away from departure and I am just fishing for ideas (cuz that's how I roll). Your input please. Fish On! Hooks"
3801857,MrSimon,2015-04-23 09:04:00,922,"3 guys in a 16' boat with a 25HP motor is no problem at all. We've done it tons of times, even in 14' boats. We find it's actually more fun to have 3 guys in the boat. More fish are pulled in and conversation is usually more lively."
3801945,oldfart,2015-04-23 09:29:00,21,"Done it both ways...the only problem with 3 in a boat is that the poor guy running the motor if you are trolling/backtrolling might have his fishing time severely limited by having to handle the boat when the other two have fish on (which happens quite a bit). I and another in the group I go with actually enjoy fishing alone...just communicate plans, etc. or stay in view of each other. Also, if on a Fly-in take 3 collapsible 5 gallon jugs to fill with water and use as ballast in the boat with one man."
3801977,adempsey,2015-04-23 09:36:00,963,"I've fished solo in boats like that many times. It's not a big deal. Just make sure you have something heavy at the bow so it's easier to plane.I often fish with a group of three and we normally all go in the same boat, but these boats always have three seats. I think you'll be fine in a 16' Lund. Worst case, get the second boat, but at an outpost camp I'd fish within visible distance of one another. Some type of two-way radio might be worthwhile as well, but they do have limited functionality.Or find a new fourth"
3802049,Carnhzkr,2015-04-23 09:42:00,964,"Agreed. Faced with that dilemma, I'd opt for 3 guys in a single boat - assuming the outfitter can add a third comfy seat. Three guys = more fish & more fun, but also more snags."
3802273,JCsGoneFishin,2015-04-23 10:26:00,34,I like this suggestion of collapsible water jugs. We normally load rocks in the front of our 14' boats on our fly in...
3802329,NathanH,2015-04-23 10:55:00,697,For sure 3 guys to a boat. Could you upgrade to an 18ft? If not 16ft is fine. Just limit the gear to one Plano 3600 box per man in the boat. Limit the number of rods to no more the two per man. Just be organized half the time I see guys out in boat it looks like they packed their house and its so full of clutter they cannot move. By limiting gear to what your targeting you can save a lot of space. I doubt your going far in a 25 HP 16ft boat any way you can always stop off at camp and switch up your gear.
3802481,oldfart,2015-04-23 11:16:00,21,"On a fly-in upgrading boats is not an option...3 in a 14 footer is crowded, to say the least. If upgrading is an option, and you go 3 to a boat, in my experience the ""driver"" usually ends up taking on the ""guide"" duties, and fishing time gets limited."
3802681,MrSimon,2015-04-23 12:06:00,922,"With three in a boat ... when trolling, the driver doesn't fish .... but we switch up every few fish. The comment above about keeping gear limited and staying organized is spot on!"
3802801,Bill Krejca,2015-04-23 12:27:00,6107,"2 boats, 3 guys, 2 are running the motor, so less fishing for 2 of them compared to 3 in a boat, one running motor. Switch off with motor with 3 in boat .I have fished 3 in a 12 ft boat in a portage into lake, just have to be careful watching where the back cast is. Some folks may prefer to run the motor - there are some certain advantages if you understand them. An old saying of mine ""You never see a skinny cook"". Bill"
