I like rivers and moving water, we like the multispecies aspect, its not completely remote and number of decent resorts. My wife and I have been to a few more remote places in canada on dedicated walleye trips our kids never have been and I would like a place where we can have some action on a few different types of fish. We catch a lot of walleye around home, but would love to be able to have them cast for pike bass & muskie. I have searched alot of threads about it but would like input from people who have been there. Not looking for fishing spots, just would like to know how busy is the area, how is the fishing in general, how does it compare to lac seul, LOTW or other places. We will be bringing our ranger and are not scared to cover water to fish. We have a family member who has been to paradise cove and highly recommended it."

However--make sure you have a good lake chart and preferably a GPS with the correct chip. Lots of rocks to hit and you can get lost out there. It is not like a typical river where you can see both shores, it is more like a maze of islands."

You do have alot of options depending on what species you are going after and what month you will be fishing. In my opinion its propably one of the best lessor known smallmouth/Muskie fisheries in the area. That system isn't as nearly busy as it was 20 years ago."
