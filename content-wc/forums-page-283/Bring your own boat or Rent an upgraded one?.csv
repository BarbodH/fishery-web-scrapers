3837161,Carnhzkr,2015-05-04 11:21:00,964,"Depends on the lodge. At Lac Seul Lodge, for example, you can pay for an optional insurance policy for $25 or $35 (can't remember which) that covers the LU. It does not cover the prop. You're on the hook if you smash a prop, but for $25, I always signed up for the LU insurance. I've rented boats at other lodges and inquired about that, but have never had the insurance option other than at LSL. This will be my first year pulling my own rig and I'm really looking forward to it. It is certainly easier and less hassle and worry free if you use a lodge boat, but I've always wanted my own with my electronics and comforts."
3837593,Carnhzkr,2015-05-04 13:38:00,964,"The worst thing about using lodge boats, rather than pulling your own is you might miss out on great stories you can talk about at family gatherings for the rest of your life, like this one.Three years ago, I was going to drive my mom and dad up to one of our favorite spots in remote Manitoba. When I got to their Nebraska farm, my dad explained that because we’d had a flat on the trailer the year before, he’d just replaced both trailer tires and as an even further precaution, along with the spare mounted to the trailer, he’d thrown in a second spare – just in case. I figured that was complete overkill. How cautious can you be? But since it’s his rig, if he wants to unnecessarily haul around a redundant spare, so be it.Our second day driving north, I heard a loud boom and saw the trailer limping. I pulled to the side of the road and inspected what was left of one of his brand new tires. I quickly put on the primary spare and away we went. I’m thinking “maybe this old farmer knew what he was doing after all”. No further issues until the way home. When leaving the lodge, the first ten miles to the main road is extremely treacherous. It was on this first stretch that I again noticed the trailer limping and upon inspection, saw what looked to be a large puncture wound in the tire I’d replaced on our way up. It could have been made by any the hundreds of sharp rocks we’d driven over. Now I’m glad this old boy knew what he was doing when he tossed in that second spare.If you try to guess what happened next, you’ll probably be correct. It was about three hours later, driving on a highway in remote MB. I happened to glance at one of the rearview mirrors just as I heard the boom and saw a cloud of black, rubber shrapnel fly into the air. At that point, I knew we were in the middle of another story that would become family lore. Pulling to the side of the road, I saw how much damage a blowout can do to a steel fender. The flapping tire tread had doubled the fender under itself to the point that, even if we’d had a third spare, we wouldn’t be able to put it on without first performing a lot of metal work on the fender to make room.We saw a small farmhouse not too far and decided if we could leave the boat there, we could drive the 30 miles to Winnipeg and spend the night. We’d then pick up another tire in the morning and away we’d go, safe and sound back to Nebraska. We pulled into the driveway and approached the house, along the way, I couldn’t help but notice the “livestock” they were raising. I saw miniature horses and donkeys on one side of the lane, on the other, there were a couple of old corn cribs that had been converted into aviaries housing various types of exotic birds. I saw golden and red pheasants with beautiful long feathers and some other types of colorful birds I didn’t recognize. A horde of kittens and dogs greeted me, along with waddling ducks and geese, as I approached the farmhouse door. A window was open and I could hear a male voice from inside, so I knocked but no answer. I knocked several times and finally yelled into the open window, “hello, is anyone home”. Eventually, I heard “Brian, someone’s at the door”. Shawn, a smallish guy with bare feet and no shirt, wearing only pajama bottoms greeted me. I explained our plight and asked if he’d mind us leaving the boat so we could head in to Winnipeg. Brian, who I assumed to be the husband in this scenario, came to the door and in the most helpful fashion drew us a map of how to get to town and the best place to go for a hotel and new tire. After thankful handshakes, we unhooked the boat and away we went. On our way to town, it occurred to me that one of the flats was a puncture. That could happen to any tire, but the other two were blowouts. Pretty coincidental to have two blowouts like that, I figured.I asked my dad how much air he’d put in those new tires. “Sixty, sixty-five”, he answered, “I always put in a little extra so they ride better”. In typical farmer fashion, if a little is good, more is always better, or so it seems.The next morning, we found a Goodyear store and explained what had happened. The guy behind the counter took a look at the specs of the tire we wanted to replace and asked if we were sure that’s what we want to put on the trailer. “Well, that’s what was on it”, I answered. He told us that’s a passenger car tire, and not a trailer tire. Trailer tires are much heavier and built for higher loads. That was our “ah, hah” moment. The fact that we had over-inflated passenger car tires on the trailer, and probably my heavy foot, all led to the two booms.With a new tire in hand and newly gained knowledge about trailer tires and loads, we proceeded back to Brian and Shawn and the Island of Dr. Moreau. When we arrived, Brian had been at work on our trailer and had managed to reshape the fender almost back to its pre-blowout status. He’d done a really nice job on it. We changed the tire, shook hands, and took a mini tour of the farm and animals. My dad tried to give them some money for their trouble, but they would have none of that, so off we went.Driving out from the lane toward the highway, with the innocence of an 80 year old Nebraska farmer, my dad asks me “do you think those guys are homosexuals”? “Well, let’s see”, I began “two guys living together on a farm in Manitoba raising miniature horses and exotic birds? Anybody’s guess”.That’s one in the ever-growing library of family stories my mom tells when we get together. “Do you remember the time when we were in Canada and”… Yes Mom, I remember."
3837641,port1042,2015-05-04 13:54:00,509,"Yes, if you ""smoke a lower unit"" on a camp boat it's your problem financially. But not your problem to get it fixed. I would expect the camp would give you another. Smoke your own lower unit and it's your problem all the way around."
3837729,stumcfar,2015-05-04 14:23:00,451,"After reading carnhzkr's story, I don't feel comfortable with people talking about smoking lower units!"
3837745,wallydave,2015-05-04 14:28:00,2151,First you have to dry it before you can light it.
3837833,ftfarms,2015-05-04 15:05:00,444,If you take the lower unit off on your own boat it's your insurance company's problem. I've haven't done it yet but seen it happen to a couple from wisconson. Thay were down for less than a day. Thay took there boat to red lake and got it fixed.
3837865,pjshorthorn,2015-05-04 15:30:00,5654,YIKES !!!!
3837873,pjshorthorn,2015-05-04 15:35:00,5654,"Great story. The beauty is that your Dad and Mom had that true innocence in them during the past trips, current and future trips. One day you can write your own book. I laughed out loud at your Dad's question. PjShorthorn"
3838209,P&y only,2015-05-04 17:10:00,133,"We used to pull our own boat up. But after doing the math, it just wasn't worth the headaches for us. It's so much less stress to just hop in the truck and go. I suppose some people really don't mind dragging a boat. But for me , I'm always waiting for the wheel bearing to go or trouble changing lanes when I need to. It's just too easy to drive up and hop in the upgrade."
3847641,rnnonmt,2015-05-07 08:32:00,992,"If the rental is was an ""upgrade"" to my boat I would rent the upgrade too. Before owning my own boat I had no choice but to rent. They were 16 footers with 20-25hp Hondas and Mercs. They would take forever to get around the fishing areas at Lac Seul. Put 3 guys in one and you were maybe hitting 18mph. Some had flat floors some were v bottom floors, and all of them had bench seats. Since buying my first boat in 2012 I have been hauling it to Lac Seul which is no short jaunt. I drive a 37ft RV that has an 8.1 Gasser dragging my 19 ft boat over 4000 miles round trip from Phoenix to Lac Seul and back. I do the trailer bearings before I leave PHX then usually one more time half way through the drive. There is a TON of preparation & preventative maintenance that I go through that is absolutely necessary to reduce the amount of potential trouble along the way. Tires, filters, fluids, tools, belts, hoses, spare parts... it goes on and on. Our drive consists of 4 overnights on the way up and 4 on the way back. Plenty of opportunity to look over the RV and boat trailer and hopefully catch any issues before they become big problems. One year I had made the mistake of having close to a full tank of gas (38 gallons) in the boat and as someone said earlier try not to overload your boat trailer capacity with gear and gas because it just makes it harder on the tires and bearings. I ended up having to replace a set of bearings after 1800 miles as the extra weight caused too much heat plus I had crappy trailer tires at the time. Good luck with your decision and have a safe/fun trip!!"
3838513,gloomiseye31,2015-05-04 18:52:00,387,"We always take our own and wouldn't have it any other way. The camp boats are small and slow and not very comfortable. Best spot is over 30 miles away would sure make a long ride in one of those. We also stay at a private cabin so it makes a lot more sense to have our own boat. Always make sure you have a kicker motor. The week long trips up there are the most our boats get used all year, would feel like a real waste to even own them if they didn't make that trip. Personally i don't know how people can spend a whole week fishing in those camp boats. Going through the border is a non issue."
3839353,btyreprich,2015-05-05 05:02:00,1067,"Couldn't agree more about trailer in your boat being a non issue. As there are 4 people in our group and we go housekeeping, the boat is also our ""trailer"" where we place our fishing gear and coolers full of frozen food. Clothes, electronics, & refrigerated food items are in the car with us. Fishing camps have significantly upgraded their boats and motors since I started fishing back in 1977. Yet I could not imagine owning a nice boat and not bringing up to Canada."
3839657,big popi,2015-05-05 06:46:00,635,"I always have took up my own boat. The Camp boats are decent enough - 14ft Nadens or Lunds with 15hp Yammies, good setups. But I really like having the boat setup the way I like it. Even though I have had numerous ""adventures"" throughout the years with my own rig - trailer stolen one year while out fishing, coil pack gave up the ghost on the last day one year, took out the lower unit of my 98 Tyee the 2nd day of the trip - I still like taking my own rig, it's what I bought it for. If you take a little time & effort to prep the boat & trailer properly you can minimize the ""adventures"" happening."
3839713,bushead11,2015-05-05 06:58:00,151,No question. If I had a really nice boat i would by all means take it up. My original question was based around the uncertaintity of a boat that is new to me that i havnt had a full season to learn all the little tips and tricks with it... Second. The upgraded camp boat (18ft with 50hp tiller) would be a slight upgrade over what id be hauling...
3839873,MrSimon,2015-05-05 07:12:00,922,"Spending 2,000 miles checking your mirrors every two minutes for smoke, sparks, or things flapping and flying out is stressful. Unless you have complete confidence that your boat/trailer/motor are well maintained and reliable, then it's a good idea to just rent the camp boat. Like many of you, I've dealt with bad wiring, flat tires, seized bearings, and finicky outboards more times than I can count. It does make for good stories, but it's a big pain in the butt. On the flip side ... nowadays, I have good equipment that gives me no problems ... and I wouldn't trade my boat for any camp boat on the planet. If it's at all practical for me to take my own boat, I do."
3841593,drew59,2015-05-05 16:14:00,87,IMO you have an easy decision. If the camp boat is an upgrade over your own that's the way to go. Less stress on the drive up and while you are there. It's all about relaxation. Have a great trip no matter what you decide!
3841601,pale ryder,2015-05-05 16:17:00,1937,"Be very careful when using your boat to haul other gear, coolers, etc.., many boat trailers are very near the max trailer capacity hauling the boat and adding extra can put you over the weight limit of the axle and/or tires."
3841609,pale ryder,2015-05-05 16:19:00,1937,"If the rental boat is as good or better than your boat, I would rent."
3843465,northernbite,2015-05-06 07:32:00,1186,"Thanks for picture, you'll be fine in that rig. My cousin has a rig like that only tiller, the StarCraft I mean. and we go way up north and it is a very safe boat. We don't stay at lodges to begin with. We have a truck camper and are self contained. I always believe in playing with my own toys. Paul"
3846121,Guest,2015-05-06 20:00:00,0,"I've trailered my own boat for 20 years and wouldn't do it any other way. I love having all my stuff and a safe, comfortable ride. In all those trips, I've one flat tire that really wasn't a big problem. I spend a lot of time doing general maintenance and making sure everything is ready for the drive, but I enjoy that part, too."
3838225,drew59,2015-05-04 17:20:00,87,"I used to take my own boat. It wasn't a large, fancy rig but was better than most camp boats. One year I had a bearing issue that I didn't notice until it was BAD. How the tire didn't catch fire is still a mystery. I followed the boat (which was on a flat bed) from Pigeon River back to Grand Marais. Six hours later we were back on our way.On the way to camp I started doing the math. Thirty years ago you got break by taking your own boat. Then camps started charging the same if you brought your own boat but included ""free"" launching and docking. (That's not a complaint, just an observation). I realized that with the extra gas I burned towing my boat and forgoing the fuel that is included in a camp boat it was costing me EXTRA to take my own. I sold it the next year and never looked back. The drive up is WAY more relaxing without a trailer and I know that if I have a motor problem the camp will take care of it. If I take out a lower unit it would have happened with my boat as well so that's a non issue.I bought a very nice portable locator and electric motor that I take with me. I also take a portable down rigger. Works out greatP.S. I admit that if I had a REALLY nice BIG boat I would take it."
3835337,bushead11,2015-05-03 19:22:00,151,"Trying to figure out what most guys on WC do....I just got a new boat which is a 1985 StarCraft with a 70hp Evinrude. It was the first boat I ever fished in and was given to my father from his best friends dad who recently passed away. Its great to fish out of with 2-3 guys and would be much better than the camp boats. In past years we have paid the $200-$300 bucks for an upgraded rental for the week. Typically something that's a v-bottom walk through with casting decks and 50hp tiller. Question is: Is it more of a hassle with gas, border regulations, potential of something going wrong to bring your own vs spending the $100 bucks per guy for the week to just rent one?Ready go....!"
3835377,nitroman,2015-05-03 19:44:00,368,Own boat for sure! I would fish out of a inner tube if i had too just to go nut given the choice i love my boat and its no hassle really to pill it up there. Just prepare correctly and all will be good!
3835497,dutchboy,2015-05-03 20:09:00,5717,"Make sure the tires are good on the trailer, make sure you do new bearings on the trailer. If the trailer breaks down the whole group will blame you instead of upgrading to the camp boat. For $100 bucks I'm upgrading."
3835969,Pooch,2015-05-04 03:07:00,4619,"We do both our own boats and in remote camps we use camp boats.When it comes to bringing your own boat there is no problem at the border or anywhere else. Boat security overnight when traveling is always a concern. There are a lot of toe sucking thieves out there anymore. That said, we never have had a problem. Park wisely at night when traveling.When it comes to traveling and fishing with your own boat, ""you make your own luck"" is the rule. Eliminate all the possible breakdowns that could occur before you leave home. Bearings always get repacked each season and checked every time we stop. Old trailer wiring is grief waiting to happen. It takes an evening to pull new wire and add submersible LED lights to a trailer. Solder all connections and use shrink on them. Run grounds to everything. Don't depend on using the trailer frame for a good ground 'casue it isn't and sooner or later will cause you grief. I can't count how many times I've watched guys dinking around with trailer lights in camp or along the road. It's as predictable as guys setting along 502 with one wheel off the boat while they go back to Fort Francis for bearings or a spindle.Carry a few spare parts in the boat. Prop and hardware to change it, including the right tools. Know how to do it before you leave home.Like the others have said, I too, would rather fish out of my boat than a rental, even though some rental boats are better boats than my old Lund. I'm used to my boat and I know that everything works properly.Pooch"
3836089,fishinnut 3446,2015-05-04 05:25:00,638,"The place we go of course includes boat, but an upgrade is $200, If I bring my own boat they knock off $200 and I have to foot the bill for gas so it's a wash, and a camp boat can't carry everything in my boat."
3836161,BornToFish,2015-05-04 06:01:00,1224,"I would go with a boat with a tiller motor over a steering console - be it a private boat or camp boat. Boat control can be that important. I happen to rent an upgrade boat from the fishing lodge. It's nice laying in bed when it's storming out, rather than getting up to put my boat on the trailer. The lodge owner can worry about his boats getting beat, rather than me worrying about my boat. You might want to have proof of ownership with you when you cross the border. It's known that thieves in the US take stolen rigs across the border to sell for cash. You will want proof of ownership with you should the border crossing agent happen to be looking for a rig like yours."
3836217,port1042,2015-05-04 06:21:00,509,"I can't figure out why people drag their own boat north. Each year I see 1 or 2 along the highway, a hassle I don't need. Fuel cost goes up. If you have mechanical problems or ding a prop or lower unit, it's your problem. The camp boat is always ready to go, gassed up, clean, and in working order. I'm also happy to pay for the upgrade ($300 for the week) for the peace of mind and comfort. My boat will wait for me at home and won't miss the trip at all."
3836353,ftfarms,2015-05-04 07:02:00,444,Port1042. Really I wouldn't fish out of anything but my boat. To many toys to mention that makes life easier.
3836601,Ranger319,2015-05-04 08:08:00,166,"Correct me if i am wrong but if you smoke a lower unit, aren't you on the hook for that? I have never rented a boat so I could be wrong. The places I fish, a camp boat isn't going to cut it. I am not going to ride for 2-3+ hours to my spots then have to do the same thing coming back. Its easy to put gas in, keep it clean and ready to go. The stuff on my boat will allow me to comfortably fsh in conditions most won't consider going out in with a camp boat.i don't have to worry about space, my storage keeps everything away and dry,it rides better, fishes better ( for my style) and my electronics are better. And my boat is 20years old this year. And definitely not top of the line . The positives waaaaaay outweigh the negatives."
