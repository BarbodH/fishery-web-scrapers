3829961,leachmin&worm,2015-05-01 10:45:00,32,My daughter inquired about what type of rod and reel set-up to purchase for a trip to Minnisota. Her boyfriend suggested a fast rod. I told her a medium action would be ok. She's looking to spend some money (about $200 for the combo). Any ideas and advice?thanks guys
3830073,oleJoe,2015-05-01 11:27:00,114,I like the Bass pro shops extreme rod. Med with a fast tip would be fine. (for me anyway) and paired with a abu-garcia reel. Price wise its in the neighbor hood. Enjoy the trip

3830113,adempsey,2015-05-01 11:30:00,963,"My preference would be for whichever combination of Shimano spinning reel and St.Croix spinning rod makes up $200. Pflueger also make a good spinning reel in that price range.A 6'6"" M rod is a pretty standard all around rod. So, that's always a good place to start.Most of my own rod/reel combos are within a $200 range. St.Croix Premier 2 pc rods - 6'6"" and 7', both in M and ML. I prefer a 6'3"" to 6'6"" ML for jigging and the 7' M for other live bait rigs such drifting Lindy rigs, trolling harnesses and Slow death. All have Shimano Symetre reels - in sizes 2500 and 3000. The 3000 is only slight larger but doesn't weigh any more. Has a little bit larger handle as well, which I like. I typically use the larger reels for trolling and long line drifting applications.If you can't find either the Shimano Symetre or St.Croix Premier on sale, you might have to go with a less expensive Pflueger President or a Shimano Sahara reel; both are good. Alternatively, bump up the reel to a Symetre and get a lesser expensive St.Croix Triumph rod.Also, I am sure if you do some research you'll find some of the in-house brands like Cabelas, BPS, Gander etc... have some decent rods at good prices. I'd stick with a name brand reel though.For example, this combo looked good:http://www.cabelas.com/product/Fishi...Tz_stype%3DGNU"

3830905,jaximus,2015-05-01 18:03:00,117,"i like a medium action rod with a fast tip as an all purpose setup. i use a st croix triumph and pflueger president (size 35). i have 10lb sufix 832 on it. i use it for jigging and bring a nice trolling combo, but it can cover for trolling if my other rod breaks. very good all around setup and comes in right around $175 with line."
3831297,Guest,2015-05-01 19:56:00,0,"Medium ( med light, med, med heavy etc.. ) would be the rod power, not the action. moderate, fast or extra fast would be the rod action. So, I agree with others on the St croix eyecon or premier 6'3"" - 6'6"" rod. For a reel, I would pick a Shimano symetre 2500 or a Pflueger supreme in the 30 series ( if you can find one ). I will say, for $200.00 you have many options though. It all depends on what you will be using it for. Walleye ? Bass ? jigging ? casting cranks ? etc... Good Luck!"
