Your adrenilin level has alot to do with your drive.Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day, Teach a man to fish and he will sit in the boat and drink beer all day"
3843129,UKBDM,2015-05-06 06:16:00,178,"It's mostly mental for me. I can drive the entire 20 hours from home to camp without a yawn but can't even get to the border without being drowsy on the return trip. I am also the organizer/planner for our group(12-15) and have fished the lake the longest. I'm always thinking of ways and locations to put others on fish. That keeps my mind working which also keeps me awake. I think if I was just fishing the same spots and following others, I would be less engaged and lose focus. The only physical thing that frustrates me is that my hands get pretty tore up from handling fish, nets, rope, etc and from just being wet a lot."
3843385,last chance,2015-05-06 07:16:00,3262,"I think the biggest factor is just plane desire. I haven't fished but very little since my little brother died 3 yrs ago. I made a trip to fl this past feb to visit my sister and brother n law, and do a little fishing, and get some warm weather. my brother n law use to be a die hard fisherman and so was I. we are both 63 and counting. for some reason after we got started fishing I was fired up. I wanted to fish every day that I could. and my brother n law would just have to make me quit. we were getting up at 4 or 5 in the morning and would take an hour or 2 to get going. I was sun burnt and hurt like crap and so bad out of shape it wasn't funny. but I wanted to feel that tug on the other end of the line. we would go fish in the open fl sun for about 3 or 4 hrs just to catch some bait fish. then we would move to the bridges and fish until about 5:00. after about 3 weeks of doing this my brother n law told my wife he didn't know how I kept going I was killing him. it must to have been good for me because I lost about 20 lbs in the 6 weeks I was there. we did take a few days off for weather or just to let him rest and if we needed to do something else. but I only went fishing by myself one time. so he was hurting but he stayed with me most of the time. so no I don't believe its how good of shape your in or how the sun drains you or how you dress. tho these can be contributing factors. but the main factor is just how bad you want that next fish."
3847505,Hewhocookstomuch,2015-05-07 08:15:00,66,"No matter if I have great sunglasses on at the end of sunny day eyestrain can bother me greatly. I try to clean off water spots on the lens. Also on bright days must wear light weight gloves, because I once had sun poison on the back of my hands. Sun block does not stop the burning feeling. Overall dressing in layers, expect the worst. A wide brim hat is a must. Sixty-nine years, the wind bothers my ears, so I also carry foam ear plugs. I might be a wreck, but by God I love walleye fishing."
3847617,MrSimon,2015-05-07 08:29:00,922,I finally broke down and bought a wide brim hat this year. I've gotten sick and tired of burning my ears on the first day and dealing with the throbbing all week.
3847713,Lovetofish,2015-05-07 08:41:00,458,Use plenty of sun screen and drink plenty of water and wear a hat. It helps.
3847809,last chance,2015-05-07 09:17:00,3262,"I do wear a wide brimmed ventilated hat and a light weight fishing shirt from cabelas or bps, and my glasses are transition lenses. so I have most things covered. and when I was fishing in florida we made sure to have plenty of gatoraid and water. you can always use plenty of liquids. but the desire to feel that next fish is what kept me going day after day. we are already planning out trip to fl next year. but I would really like to stay a little longer next year, LOL."
3841401,MrSimon,2015-05-05 14:56:00,922,"Did you ever notice how some guys get ridiculously tired after fishing for a few days? I have a few buddies who are in good physical shape, but can't keep their eyes open after two full days of fishing. I'm definitely in worse shape than them, but I can fish all day for a week straight and feel great. Is there such thing as being in fishing shape?"
3841465,ablack86,2015-05-05 15:17:00,17,"Absolutely, it is much like being in shape for bowling. The strength in your throwing/casting arm, the ability to eat delicious bar food / fish, and the tolerance to drink an entire keg of beer."
3841721,Mike Borger,2015-05-05 17:24:00,1554,Personally I think it boils down to desire and will more than anything else. If you've got the fire in your belly you tend to fish harder and longer.
3841761,Juls,2015-05-05 17:30:00,13414,"If they don't spend a lot of time outdoors, just the fresh air and elements can wear them down faster than someone like yourself that fishes a lot. I'm sure after a week or two of outdoor activities, their ability to stay awake would increase too."

3841881,Draco1206,2015-05-05 18:06:00,175,"I think it's a combination of several things that have been mentioned here. Using different muscle groups that you don't normally use, the desire, willpower, and fire you have to go all day and the elements definately play a roll in how tired you are at the end of the day. One thing I would add is the type of fishing you do will play a roll also in how you feel. If you are anchoring and jigging or sitting and trolling all day you certainly won't be as tired as the guy that stands and is making 100-150 casts per hour, thousands of casts in a 14-16 hour day. I'm a die hard, power fishing nut and there's not too many guys I know (except for maybe my son and a couple of his friends) that can keep up with me and I'm 57 years old. I know that at the end of a 16 hour day of standing and casting, my back aches, my feet hurt, my right shoulder is sore from casting and my left shoulder hurts from operating the tiller all day. But I take a couple Aleve, and a few shots of Crown and I'm back up at 5:30am the next morning to do it all over again. And I hope to do that until I die."

3842337,Ndstallmann,2015-05-05 20:06:00,549,Or could it be not enough protective clothing from the sun.
3842857,kzoofisher,2015-05-06 03:49:00,5144,"Agree, not dressing right in general is a big factor. Keep your body from fighting to warm up or cool down, cover yourself from the sun because it will suck the energy out of you, stay hydrated and protect your eyes from strain. Setting a sleep schedule is huge, too. If you are getting up much earlier than usual it will take you days to adjust. Start setting your alarm to fishing time the week before and enjoy the sunrises."
3842905,btyreprich,2015-05-06 04:19:00,1067,"X2 on wearing the ""right"" clothes for the weather and wearing sunglasses. My experience has taught me to dress in layers as you can add or take off clothes as the weather changes."
