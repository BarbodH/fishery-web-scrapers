Stupid sharp hooks, very durable paint jobs as well and because the paint is tough the eyes are already opened...they guarantee it. Better known under the name Jig A Jo.I have jigs I bought from them about 6 years ago... and use them alot, they look as new as when I bought them."

After nocking the paint off jigs for years fishing the bedrock bottom lakes in north eastern Ontario i hooked up on the web with Jason crawfords jigs he personly makes. he will makem any way you want. has a couple different hook selections, all different weights including his latest its 3/16 oz and has a bait holder on the top and bottom of the tail of the lead, it holds our plastic on for meany more catches. the weight being between 1/8 and 1/4 is perfect for a good presentatin in up to about 20 FOW. The eyelets are always open Probably bought 500 to 600 from him in 4 years. i recommend you go to his website then call him and personally and communicate what you want. This fellow has great products with great service Halfmoon"
