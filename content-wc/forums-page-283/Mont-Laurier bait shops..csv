3825161,a3dad,2015-04-29 15:35:00,115,Thanks for the info Freytown. Any idea if they'll take US dollars or credit cards?
3826049,canyon,2015-04-29 20:14:00,37,Also the gas station in Parent has worms and leeches for sale if you find yourself passing through there.
3826185,Andre (wallyandre),2015-04-29 20:50:00,2274,There is no prblem with you're US green $$ but for youre credit card it's not the store the problem; you need to advise youre credit card company that you are going to travel in Canada between a certain date. Enjoy youre trip in our nice country!
3826577,Freytown,2015-04-30 04:57:00,770,"I don't know...give them a call. I exchange US$$ when crossing the border for misc purchases. Given the current exchange rate they'll take your US$$, lol"
3826593,octanehi5,2015-04-30 05:11:00,1104,"My crew and I have found the best way to buy things, in any country, stop at your boarder crossing duty free shops and exchange your US dollars for Canadian dollars, Exchange rate is at 20% right now. That means $80 US will get you 100$ canadian, Sometimes up in the back country credit cards are not taken. Most places will swap you Dollar for dollar but your losing big time"
3828601,TheDFP,2015-04-30 18:51:00,39,"We used to get worms in Clova at the train station/gas station/restaurant/grocery/bait store. They were expensive. Started to get a flat at the 1000 islands bait store in Clayton, NY, right before we cross the 1000 islands bridge. Great price and you can get across the border no problem with them."
3828673,a3dad,2015-04-30 19:14:00,115,"When I travel to Europe, I often use an ATM to get the local currency. Anyone ever do this in Canada? Or perhaps get cash back at a grocery store? Gotta stop and get beer and eggs anyway!"
3828689,DeBo,2015-04-30 19:25:00,211,Just check with your bank that your ATM card will work in Canada. On a work trip in BC my debit card didn't (wells Fargo) and my coworker's (US Bank) did. I usually just use my CC for everything when I can. Every place dings you on a transaction fee no matter how you convert. In Mont Laurier we went to the bank in town and got cash there. Their fees are the lowest but there is some paperwork and they run your passport. I don't know anything about bait in ML but the microbrasserie next to the quality inn is a great place. 20+ beers on tap and some very tasty food. The Faim Gourmet (sp) next to the one hotel on the south side of the road by st Hubert's has AWESOME breakfast. Miss that place. Only place in town that didn't take credit cards was the Chinese buffet across(ish) from Hubert's.
3833441,mickr,2015-05-03 05:49:00,74,"Pretty much any business in Canada is going to take credit or debit cards. Definitely any gas station. In Canada we have a highly regulated banking system with 6 major banks and a few big credit unions which between them have > 99% of all Canadian banking. All of these institutions operate globally. My understanding south of the border is that there are many many different banks. Some big, some small, some national, some local. A lot of these smaller and more local banks are not necessarily tapped in to the global banking system. Look on the back of your credit or debit card - if it has a ""interact"" logo or a ""plus"" logo, your card will work anywhere in Canada. If your card does not have one of these symbols, it likely doesn't work in Canada."
