3843937,zman8701,2015-05-06 09:19:00,100,"Thanks Skywagon... now maybe we can put an end to this thread. So now I have to add eggs to my list in Canada along with your beer and rye bread. Who knows maybe your eggs will taste better than ours, I know the other two items do."
3844185,wallydave,2015-05-06 10:10:00,2151,"We have always stopped in Dryden to get the fresh food supplies on our way to Goose Bay Camp on the NW end of Lac Seul, last trip there the x-large eggs we all double yoked! Made for some good omletes! With the echange rate a little better now, some ""local"" shopping isn't all that bad!Heck we usually need to stretch our legs and need to take care of some coffee anyway!"
3845033,Skywagon,2015-05-06 14:31:00,1106,"For what it's worth, Walmart in Dryden has just become a Super store. I have not been there since the expanded grocery section opened, but my wife says they have the best produce in town. Also for those that missed it, the IGA on highway 17 is closed now, so there is one less option, but there is still Safeway and Extra Foods."
3837265,bkw67,2015-05-04 11:44:00,70,"I haven't seen anything specifically allowing them. In my opinion (which means spit), pasteurized does not constitute 'Cooked'So unless I were to see something specifically allowing them, I would assume they are banned as well. Where the Canadian agency responsible for the ban, and more importantly; the particular boarder guard you end up with when crossing, interprets the ban and how ""Egg Beaters"" fit into the ""Raw - Cooked"" spectrum is anyone's guess at this point.I have sent an email to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency asking the question.. I'll let you know IF they reply."
3838785,BornToFish,2015-05-04 20:17:00,1224,"I crossed the border at International Falls last week. I had some time at the border and specifically asked about Egg Beaters (eggs in a box). The border services officer said they are NOT allowed. There is a dumpster at the far end of the parking lot that is specifically for eggs. I watched several deposits made into this dumpster. The agent said that cooked poultry is allowed into Canada at this time. He also said this could change at any time, and that I should call ahead for our summer trip. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3839297,btyreprich,2015-05-05 04:55:00,1067,You mentioned calling ahead before the next border crossing into Ontario. Do you have the phone number of the border guard facility so I can call them before our trip? Thanks
3839385,BornToFish,2015-05-05 05:17:00,1224,"I googled the border crossing at Fort Frances several years ago and found this telephone number: 807-274-3655. I'm pretty sure that this is the phone number that I have used when calling the border with previous questions. If you have a choice, you might need to ask for ""customs"" rather than ""immigration"".Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3839393,octanehi5,2015-05-05 05:18:00,1104,"What part of Uncooked or raw Poultry,Don't some of you guys get, They are not going to grant anyone special dispensation, Buy your eggs and poultry in Canada. Taking a chance on spreading this disease,is just crazy. thinking you can fly under the radar,is not a good way to go. The guys on here have posted some very valuable info. Ive bin going to Canada more than 25 yrs. when thay say certain things are not aloud over the boarder, they mean it. Or hard boil your eggs and have a good trip."
3839761,TIGHTLINER,2015-05-05 07:02:00,223,Just got off the phone with a canadian customs agent at sault st maria canada. I ask about chicken eggs and egg beaters. He said he knows of no restrictions of bringing poultry or eggs or egg beaters. Us citizens are restricted as to how much poultry meat can be brought in. Did not mention anything about eggs or egg beaters.. This happened to us about 5 yrs ago when everyone was talking about bringing potatoes into canada. We had them and they ask we were told as long as they were in the purchased container there is no problem. We are getting two different stories on this maybe canadian officials need to make sure they are all on the same page with this present band on poultry. I am not doubting any ones word on this just trying to clear it up. Number at the soo is 1-705-941-3063 or 1-705-942-4345. Just to be on safe side i might call the day before we are to depart .
3839921,pjshorthorn,2015-05-05 07:30:00,5654,"Apparently that customs agent didn't get the memo. The restrictions are on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency website and it is pretty clear that raw eggs, egg whites, albumen are not allowed. Uncooked poultry is not allowed. Pet food with chicken products/byproducts is not allowed. Fully cooked poultry or canned poultry products are allowed.An easy way to mitigate any confusion at the border is to print the restrictions/allowances from the CFIA website, highlight any allowances you want to transport and hand it to the agent if it is questioned. The latest update is as of 4/15/15.www.inspection.gc.caThere is a scrolling banner at the top of the webpage that has an Avain Flu update. Click on it and then choose the import tab on the lefthand menu.What crossed the Canadian border first? The chicken or the egg ? PjShorthorn"
3840017,LOW1,2015-05-05 07:52:00,2828,"It seems to me that taking eggs or poulty across the border until there has been an official lifting of the ban is asking for delay, border searches, and other difficulties. No guaranty that the person you talk to on the phone knows Canada's official position and it is almost certain that this person will not be the person who will be asking you questions at the border. And there is very good reason to support any efforts to curtail the avian flu situation. Common sense is to buy your poultry and eggs in Canada."
3840081,Blue Lk,2015-05-05 08:13:00,269,"My biggest concern would be,having your name put on ""a list"" which could cause you border issues for years. A friend of mine had a bag of dog food taken away a few years ago & had long delays at the border for a number of subsequent visits Imo it's just no worth the risk."
3840489,TIGHTLINER,2015-05-05 10:11:00,223,"After reading some of the posts and reading the web site from canada i decided to call the customs agent back at the soo. I did not speak to the same agent but did have a nice chat with another agent and he did take the time and was very pleasant in explaining the restrictions on poultry and poultry products to me. So at the present time the egg beaters will be staying at home. I want to explain that i was not trying to start a war on wc just the difference between what others were told and read and what i was told the first time i called, this is a great web site and a lot of good info gets passed around on it."
3800081,bkw67,2015-04-22 21:04:00,70,"I would gladly pay the tolls to cross back and forth to have eggs and Chicken on the trip.Last year, we crossed at 5:45am. As we had to be in Atikokan at 8:00am. So a store opening at 7:00am wouldn't have helped us.We will have to see what our flying time is."
3806945,strength22,2015-04-24 13:44:00,49,If the stores have eggs then I will get them if they do not then I wont. Pretty simple issue really...either way I will be fishing for walleye in Canada. Not too worried about eggs and a chicken really. Will bake walleye for breakfast and get my omega 3's and good fats in that way...taste better anyway.

3808233,Skywagon,2015-04-25 04:56:00,1106,"Suggesting to take a chance in spreading a disease to another country? The bird flu is serious, it's ramifications are huge, entire populations of birds are destroyed in infected operations. The producer, their employees, suppliers, farmers, truckers, processers and the cost of the product in the grocery stores to ALL CONSUMERS are affected by this disease. You're food does not just magically appear on grocery store shelves, it has to be produced first. They did their best to keep Ebola out of our countries, why should we do any less for any disease?"
3808249,pjshorthorn,2015-04-25 05:06:00,5654,"I agree completely. Unfortunately, according to the CFIA the Avian Influenza disease is already in Onatrio. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't take the necessary precautions to keep it from spreading further especially if it were to be a different strain in the US. PjShorthorn"

3833689,v-bay gord,2015-05-03 07:43:00,3168,"I know this has been talked about already but after a recent meeting where a border rep again reminded us to tell our guests ""No raw poultry or eggs can be brought across the border"" I thought it would be worth bringing it back to page one. Although there are some states that these products are deemed safe, the onus to prove to the border people by way of receipts, etc. is likely going to be more of a hassle than it's worth.....and if there's any doubt, your stuff will end up in the dumpster. An example is that you have the receipt, but the eggs have no indication of their origin on the packaging...off to the dumpster. Bottom line, buy your eggs up here, or arrange for your operator to have some on hand for you if you can't make it to a store. By the way, cooked poultry is fine....."

3795089,bkw67,2015-04-21 19:31:00,70,"This may cause us to stay in Fort Fancies as apposed to International Falls this year. We usually have to be in Antikokan before 10:00am for our flight, so we cross before 7:00am. That gives me an idea... can you bring chicken and eggs from Canada to the US? If so, maybe I could check into the hotel.. cross to Canada, buy the Chicken and Eggs, then cross back to the U.S. and spend the night.. The next morning, cross into Canada with the receipt showing they were purchased in Canada."
3795537,Aspencreek,2015-04-21 21:56:00,2911,"I'm still a bit confused as to why. The chickens are dead, and the eggs come in their own container. Nobody is releasing them back into the wild and I don't think I will be exposing the live population to the ones I purchase and I plan on consuming what I bring or buy within 6 days. I understand the avian flu outbreak is BAD news to the farms that contract it, can someone please explain. All of my meat is frozen solid for the trip, doesn't that take care of the flu."
3795785,octanehi5,2015-04-22 05:05:00,1104,Are they checking for eggs at the border?We usually buy our dairy products in canada may just have to add eggs to the list
3795961,TIGHTLINER,2015-04-22 06:04:00,223,Just bought egg beaters yesterday for our trip in may. Egg beaters are pasteurized. Will try to take them if they take them we can stop and buy them at local grocery store. Most egg beaters have a shelf life of almost 60 days if kept cold.
3796033,CI_Guy,2015-04-22 06:24:00,2118,"The egg shells you throw in the garbage still have uncooked egg white in them and wild birds could feed on them in landfills. Freezing causes bacteria and viruses to go dormant until they thaw out, it doesn't kill them. Food restrictions have been used at borders for as long as I can remember and change constantly because things like the avian flu come and go. Since food is available for sale in Canada I feel it is a minor inconvenience."
3797209,dkrusin,2015-04-22 09:49:00,97,Where are you getting this ban information on eggs. There is no mention of it on the customs website.

I mean every single vehicle going to a housekeeping cabin is going to be looking for eggs. I hope the stores will be ready for us.
3793425,LOW1,2015-04-21 13:46:00,2828,"I am not worried, but I also am planning to stop at a larger grocery stores rather than relying on the more convenient but less well-stocked smaller stores. My prediction is that eggs/poultry will be available but expensive. People may want to plan their border crossing for a time when the larger stores are open and to have an empty cooler available."
3793449,Aspencreek,2015-04-21 13:51:00,2911,"There is always Eggbeaters! It's not exactly the same (read not even close here) but in a pinch.
