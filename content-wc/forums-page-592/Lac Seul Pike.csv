I suppose that is mostly a spring tatic? But did not know if it would work in August in evenings in Narrows areas? And what kind of water are the Smallmouths in that time of year? Or any other advice of on catching Pike or Small Mouths that time of year, besides catching a few while Walleye fishing."
1072636,orchard frank,2009-01-09 08:23:00,1900,"Many of the big northerns we caught at Lac Seul were caught while fishing walleye. In August, most of the walleye fishing will target bars, reefs, and reef edges, primarily in the 20-28' range. I'm convinced that the bigger pike cruise these deep edges, raising up or down according to their activity level. On August days when we did target pike, we had good luck trolling these edges with deep diving cranks, keeping in the 26-32' range. Super Shad Raps were probably best, although other baits had their day (my wife had a favorite lure that looked exactly like a baby pike, not sure of the name, but it put some dandies in the boat). There were some guys who did well jigging big plastics in the same type areas. Casting deep weed edges (in August) with spinnerbaits or Johnson Spoons will put some serious numbers in the boat at times, but the size (in my experience) will usually top out about 28"", with most in the 20-24"" range. We caught a ton of them a few times trolling the edges just west of the Webster Bay bridge with big Hot-N-Tots, including some decent ones. With a west wind, the outflow area of that same culvert can be hot too. Too many places, too many species, not enough time."

We've always picked up walleye there with the occational pike, but we go in early June and fish up a little more shallow. Somewhat of a hit of miss spot. Never really fished any of the shore beyond that between the bridge and webster bay, seemed like too steep a drop to produce."
1072860,orchard frank,2009-01-10 09:42:00,1900,"We've usually done better on the north side for whatever reason, although the points south of the cove you mention have been good too. The times we have fished there, tended to just keep going, a deep slot just before you enter into Webster Bay itself has produced. In August, we have caught bigger pike relating to deeper water. Troll fast, zig-zag, bang bottom with the Tots, cut back out. We've never really put a lot of effort into pike fishing, but that whole area, before and after the bridge has been productive. On a September trip, the sand bar area where the run to Websters first starts to narrow after Frenchmans Head, was just LOADED with nice pike. It was cold and blowing hard thru there, we dropped the anchor and cast. Nothing real big, but several in the 12# range, a few pushing 15."
