1070555,Babamel2,2008-12-29 10:43:00,414,Our group is looking for a place to have lunch in Dryden when heading up to camp. We have always stopped at the Huskie Truck Stop and are looking for a new place. Any suggestions. preferably not McDonalds or Subway
1070570,Fred_G,2008-12-29 13:36:00,908,My wife and I enjoy stopping at the local Dairy Queen on our way through Dryden. They even have a big enough parking lot for a boat.
1070628,tackleman,2008-12-29 17:45:00,444,"you gotta try the PI (patricia inn). It is at the stop lights on the way to walmart on the left hand side heading east. there is lots of room to park a boat in tow and the food is great. Try the PI burger, lots of food on the plate and reasonably priced. When my wife and I go down to Dryden we have lunch there most of the time."

They have a couple of BBQ's set up there. We just pack a small cooler with some dogs/brats, buns, condiments and a small bag of self start charcoal. Throw the bag in light it, cook the dogs, eat and are back on the road within an hour (about the same as stopping at the cafe). It works out well because everyone is ready to stretch there legs by then. I know there is a park across the bridge from the paper maill also that probably has BBQ pits. Good Luck."
1071846,Babamel2,2009-01-06 07:05:00,414,Thanks for all your responses. For our group I think the Patricia Inn may be a good option. Hope all of you have a Happy New Year and great fishing.
