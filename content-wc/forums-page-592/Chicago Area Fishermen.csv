Definately our camps favorite... seems even when there aren't a ton of people, the people there are looking to book... which helps a lot."
1071264,Obabikon,2009-01-02 18:55:00,2370,"Come and check out the All Canada show at Pheasant Run starting next Thursday the 8th and going until the 12th! Some of the best resorts in all of Canada will be present... plus, you can enjoy a nice cold Blue while getting pumped up for the summer trip!"
1071597,alanb,2009-01-04 19:45:00,56,"We'll see you there Thursday night! At least three of us will be coming to say hi along with signing advanced copies of our upcoming book ""How to Nearly Kill Yourself on Opening Weekend of LOTW 2008 without Trying"". Alan"
1071689,Bill Krejca,2009-01-05 10:16:00,6107,"Alan, you must be part of the party that Jared did the ""catch and keep"" rescue out of Miles Bay last year? Bill Krejca"
1071781,alanb,2009-01-05 17:16:00,56,"Bill, Yep, that was us getting 3 people wet and 4 boats in various states of beached/sunk on that super windy day before the opener in May. The relatives have been making this yearly fishing trip in the spring for the last 10+ years, and coming up on about 30 years total of a yearly trip to LOTW with friends from church. The only thing we can figure is God wasn't ready for all us at once! This year we are being smart and using a shuttle service with Jared from the Morson Marina to the family place on Bottle Bay. And I can rent a nice electric start boat with a fishfinder to use for our trip from him. We sent two Hummingbird fishfinders to the bottom last year with a new Rapala fillet knife and 5 cases of Alexander's Keiths Red! Alan"
1071805,Obabikon,2009-01-05 19:49:00,2370,"By the end of the day Alan, I think everyone was wet. Not just the three swimmers! With the sport shows starting, I bet I tell that story 100 times before summer! I'm still shaking my head... thank goodness we're all ok. The funniest part was finding the engine in three feet of water with the gas tank acting like a bobber."
1071853,Bill Krejca,2009-01-06 07:42:00,6107,"Alan, Yeah, its tough to lose the beer! Bill Krejca"
1071871,alanb,2009-01-06 09:31:00,56,"Jared, I thought the engine looked like a dog straining on its leash trying to run away! If it hadn't broke free of the boat right at the shoreline and landed on that ledge, it would still be at the bottom. Did you dead lift that motor out of the water? Also, we found our styrofoam cooler with our turkeys that were to be dinner that night along with all of our bacon. It floated along and beached itself on the southside of that little island about 400' feet east of where we found the the motor. And that bacon was well traveled. We bought bacon made in Canada at the Costco in Illinois, took it back to Canada, it floated around on the lake, and then we took about 1/2 of it back to Illinois and finally finished it over the 4th of July weekend in Michigan! Alan"
1071957,Obabikon,2009-01-06 15:38:00,2370,"Yeah, I lifted it, but it's lighter in the water. Once I got it up to the surface, Daryl did the rest. Man that water was cold! That's some well traveled bacon! imported, exported, imported, exported..."
1072938,Obabikon,2009-01-10 19:39:00,2370,"The show has been good so far! Tomorrow's the last day, hope some more people will be coming out despite the football games!"
1073000,Guest,2009-01-11 07:44:00,0,I think the turnout may have been a little off yesterday at the show was due to the snow. Hopefully you will get a better attendance today. Best of luck to you.
