About a 7 mile boat ride from ramp to camp. There is also a camp right next to the C.N. dock, but I can't remember the name for sure-maybe Labelles?I have the Canadian published map at home at will post the map number this evening.Fished out of Camp Narrows twice. Send me a pm if you need more info.Nimstug Many men go fishing all their lives without knowing it is not fish they are after.H.D. Thoreau"

We used both maps these past two years. If you do most of your fishing in Northwest Bay you can get by with just 6106. You can check out all of the maps for LOTW and Rainy on page 39 of the following document. The maps are about $20 each.http://www.gov.mb.ca/conservation/ca...pCatalogue.pdf If you attend any of the All-Canada shows a representative from Canada Map Sales will have the Rainy maps on hand for sale. I purchase my newer waterproof maps at the show in St Charles, Illinois two years ago to replace the old paper maps I purchased years ago. If you have a GPS unit for your boat I would consider the Lakemaster LOTW map. I purchased the Navionics LOTW + 2K map two years ago and used both chips last year. The Lakemaster map was much more detailed. Both maps include all of Rainy. Good Luck Like2Fish"
