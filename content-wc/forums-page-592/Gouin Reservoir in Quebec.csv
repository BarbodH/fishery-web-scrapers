1071735,slug72,2009-01-05 13:35:00,34,"I had to pull out of going to northwest Ontario due to some budget issues that I am hitting this coming year and the distance of the trip 25 hours+ from PA didn't help. I'm disapointed but starting to get excited about the possibility of a trip to Gouin Reservoir. I've narrowed down my choices to two camps that both have an excellent affordable family packages in August, Walleye Point Outfitter and Nemio Outfitters. Both seem like quality outfitters, as I've thoroughly searched the past reports on this forum. But I have a very specific question. Based on the fact that quantity is more important to me than quality (for my two sons), do either of these locations have an advantage over the other for producing during the second week of August? I read one report that made August sound pretty good at Walleye Point. Nemio sounds like it is on a river that may be better earlier in the season. From what I can research, more people have stayed at Nemio and everyone seems real pleased with this camp. So, I am a bit torn and need some input. Maybe I'm just overthinking things too much. Thanks, Chris"
1071742,retire55,2009-01-05 14:07:00,1029,"Hi Chris: My fishing partner and myself spent a week fishing the Gouin Reservoir at Nemios in mid Aug of 2005. While we endured 3 thunderstorms during the week and we were never on the water before 0930 hrs nor after 1630 hrs, we caught lots of walleye and a few northerns (untargetted). We ate walleye 3 or 4 times during the week and we each took a limit home to share with family members. While Nemio's is located on the Nemio River, its a 15 minute camp boat ride to Baie du Nord (only other access to Baie du Nord is by air). I can not comment on Walleye Point Outfitter as I have never fished at that location. And if you enjoy wild blueberries, the Gouin Reservoir is a great location in early to mid Aug."
1071744,phishfearme,2009-01-05 14:09:00,1242,"chris - i live in PA also and researched the gouin area extensively to try to find what we consider a quality trip - quality for us is isolation in an true wilderness setting (ie: rent a lake) and excellent fishing - 25 walleye per day min with a good average size and the chance to catch jumbos, and with a good pike population also. anyway, we gave up on the gouin - a couple of reasons: 1 - it's a reservoir and the level fluctuates significantly. do a search and you'll find years when there's no water in front of some camps - they had to close, 2 - the walleyes size average is pretty small (there used to be two guys - alsis and mcq - on this board who were experts on the gouin - they seem to have dissappeared though - and made numerous comments about the avg size) and 3 - there's no less than 29 outfitters on that lake each with many cabins and/or lodges. true, it's a hugh lake but there's also a hugh number of cabins and outfitters - we just couldn't find what we considered an isolated cabin. also, depending on where in PA you live, the drive ain't all that much shorter than going to NW ontario. i calculated 19-20 hrs from the PIT area vs 23-24 hours for pickle lake/red lake/armstrong area. when i looked at this area, the roads in were also really bad but i think they've improved. so, we ruled out the gouin and are continuing to do the arduous drive to pickle lake but stay there 10 days now. i think we're glad we did. this is just our opinions and although we ruled out the lake, it may suit you just fine - there's LOTS of people that go there and are happy with their experience. you won't find too many on this board though - it seems to specialize in NW ontario - but ask your outfitter for names of people who were there last year - at the same time you're planning to be there - and get some better data. and if you go there, please post a report. best of luck phish"
1071760,Seanik,2009-01-05 15:24:00,218,"Chris, We fished at Walleye Point, 2007, 2005 and 2004, didn't go last year because of some health issues with some of the group. We are all retired and health and age sometimes dictates our trips. I recommend Walleye Point especially in August, The fish are not big but 14""-16"" are plentiful and close by the camp (3-5 miles max run). Roger runs a great camp, comfortable cabins and if you go with the meal plan great food. The 160 mile gravel road is usually in good shape and a 50 mph average is easily possible. When you get to camp roger has copies of map with the fish spots marked and you don't have to be concerned about rocks, it's mostly sand. We are not going this year because we want a change of scenery and will try out a different outfitter, MOOSE TERRITORY LODGE about 100 miles East of North Bay in Quebec. They advertised Lake Trout, blue and yellow walleyes and Aurora trout in 40+ Lakes in their exclusive Territory and the best part it is only a 540 mile trip from Erie Pa for us. Hope this helps in your decision. I took my 14 yr old grandson in 2007 and he had a super great time, from catching walleye non-stop to running the 15 hp motor."
1071849,McQ,2009-01-06 07:29:00,615,"As some of you know I have fished the Gouin for the past 25 years or so. It is a huge body of water that provides many different fishing challenges. It was a pleasure for me to be involved in the development of the Pointe a Dore (Walleye Club) on the south bay and I had many a memorable day on that section of the Gouin. Over the years I also had the opportunity to fish the entire Gouin Reservoir section by section and found many unique flavors to each area. With only a couple of exceptions every trip produced outstanding results. In my experience there is very little territorial overlap from each of the outfitters and other than returning to the base camp have encountered little traffic on the water - this area is one of the truly great Canadian fishing destinations. After all these years I have settled into an August routine out of NEMIO, I have discovered that the opportunities of this particular area exceed all others at this time of year. As mentioned earlier, the river fishery is an early season spectacular but come late summer the open water holds significant numbers of good fish and produces size as well. Accessing the Gouin is easy but you will have to drive a couple of hundred kilometers on well maintained gravel roads with final access to your camp being on outfitter maintained roads (some of which are a challenge) but the end result is well worth it. There are reasons for my picking Nemio for August, some mentioned above but overall it is a well maintained operation which offers full facilities - great hosts and access is the easiest for my purposes. I fish western and central Quebec extensively throughout the summer and do get to enjoy other areas as well but August will always find me at NEMIO. retire55 and I have had the pleasure of attending a few very attractive destinations over the past few years and each has a special flavor from opening day through all the seasonal changes that Quebec has to offer - the one constant is the more effort put into ""the getting there"" the better the fishing. I don't have any business interest in the NEMIO operation, just really like everything about the place and I emphasize there are many other destinations in Quebec (over 700 outfitters in total) that cover the spectrum of great fishing.

1072164,Seanik,2009-01-07 13:30:00,218,"Hi MQ, I am a fan of the Gouin Reservoir but this year we want a change of scenery. Our group is looking at Moose Territory Lodge near Rapides Des Joachims, Quebec. They have exclusive rights to 65 sq. miles with 45 lakes and 2 species of trout (Lake and Aurora trout). I have been trying to get information about this place but after internet searches and searches here didn't get anything. Anything you know about This lodge will be appreciated, their brochure says they have been in business for over 45 years. Thanks and great seeing your post after a layoff."
1072167,McQ,2009-01-07 13:44:00,615,"Hey Seanik i did respond to your original post - here's a modified cut & paste It's been at least 20 years since I last flew into Moose Territory. The roads then were very questionable and the Beaver was the best way to access. I have a few fond memories of the time on Lake Marion, Lakers up to 12 lbs and Northerns of the hammerhandle variety but a ton of them. Never did fish any of the surrounding lakes so can't provide any further info. I'm sure much has changed with the passage of time. I would suggest you check out Club Trout Lake which is above the Kipawa accessed through Ville Marie & Belleterre - only 25 miles of gravel and the options are many. My fishing buddy retire55 arranged this trip and we elected to portage into Bay Lake which is accessed by RR portage. The lodge staff looked after the bullwork and the six of us enjoyed a very interesting week of big fish compettition. This remote location provided us with the seclusion we all seek and the variety of water to explore kept us on the go all week.http://www.clubtroutlake.com/"
1072687,pike50plus,2009-01-09 12:31:00,584,www.bushlandadventures.com They have other camps too with multi-species. I have booked Evans Kirk island camp for July4 after going to Mb last year as a change up. have fished 3 of the lakes offered. All trophy places! Sam
