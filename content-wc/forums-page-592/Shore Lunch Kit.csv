1070039,Babamel2,2008-12-24 11:16:00,414,"We did so many shore lunches where we forgot something, (mixing spoon, matches, etc.) I developed a check list. Each day as we pack for the shore lunch we check off each item as we pack it. That way we know what all is needed and have it packed. dont forget the stuff needed for cleaning up."
1070106,Guest,2008-12-24 20:24:00,0,I agree with the previous suggestions. A good container that will hold most of your shore lunch equipment will make for an easier time on shore. I have a heavy duty plastic container with snap closed lid. I think I got it at a resturant supply store. We have found carrying charcoal lighter fluid to be a hassel. Check out this WEB site for an option to carrying a container of fuel in the boat.http://www.oldjimbo.com/survival/adrien13.html This guy has a lot of good info on everything from how to pick a camp ax/hatchet to making a survial kit.http://www.oldjimbo.com

1070436,maverick,2008-12-28 12:23:00,24,"I use this Coleman Skillet. It packs in the boat very nicely, cleans up nice and frys fish perfectly. Using 1 l cylinders is easy too. Go to this website to see one. Got mine at walmart.http://www.coleman.com/coleman/colem...ategoryid=2010 Jim"
1070441,Golden Eagle,2008-12-28 12:51:00,2642,"I've done only one shore lunch in about my last 75 days of fishing. Big pike are on the prowl betweent 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. and I don't want to lose valuable fishing time. I usually have a cold walleye sandwich while on the move between fishing locations. Shore lunches are great, but catching big pike is better."
1071125,lobo1,2009-01-02 06:06:00,734,"Golden Eagle, I am with you on this one - but it depends on who I am with. When I go with my fishing nut friends - it's fish all day and at night fry extra fish for a sandwich on the run for tomorrow (maybe a cold baked tater too). BUT.......when I take one of my kids or even last year I talked my wife into going one time! we then make the shore lunch as a break in the day so that I don't burn anyone out. When my dad comes alone he can go either way.......and sometimes prefers to drink his lunch"

When we used to go as three or four boats it was easy, each boat carried a bit of stuff, but what we dragged along would be way to much for one boat, room is the key here.Al"
1071163,Golden Eagle,2009-01-02 10:31:00,2642,"lobo1, are you calling me a fishing nut? If so, you're bang on.Six of us had one shore lunch on our 8 day trip last summer. We had three guys, two wives and one daughter. It was okay with me because the pike bite was off a bit. We enjoyed the best summer walleye bite I've ever experienced on two major reefs. All this talk is getting me wound up for May 15. Actually I'm a self starter."
1069269,joeman79,2008-12-19 10:12:00,417,"I am in the process of putting together a shore lunch kit. And I am looking for suggestions on what kind of stove or burner would be the most practical. We are going to Lac Seul and may be fishing an hour away from the cabin, and would like to do our own shore lunch. I have a 2 burner coleman pump up gas stove and a big ole propane fish cooker. But think that would be way to big and cumbersome in boat. And I do not know if you can legally have an open fire, plus I do not have much expierence cookin over an open fire. I have a great big skillet like I want but am looking for you WC'ers suggestions and tips. Also other things I should have in the kit, besides food. Tongs spatulas etc. Or tips on cooking over an open flame. Merry Christmas Everyone. Thank you. Joe"
1069304,Guest,2008-12-19 13:07:00,0,"Keep it simple..thats what makes the best shore lunches. I keep a small plastic tub and all the goods go in there. We always cook over an open fire. We carry pot, frying pan and a small grill to go over the fire. Start the fire and let it get some coals. It takes a little while but thats when we relax and have a few brews. Cook over the coals. Some of the guys bring charcoal briquettes. Good luck."
1069306,Golden Eagle,2008-12-19 13:13:00,2642,"Many camp owners supply a shore lunch kit. It's worth checking. A word of advice though, check the stove and be sure the fuel tank is full. By checking, I mean light it and let it burn a couple of minutes before leaving the dock. Don't forget ice cream."
1069322,Larry Mac,2008-12-19 15:39:00,530,"Hi Joeman79, like many guys, we to enjoy our shore lunches, everyday if possible. We have experienced Campfire, Coleman gas and propane stoves and fish cookers. They all have their place. After many years we have narrowed it down to utilizing the shore lunch kits and stoves provided by the camps (inspected of course). We will keep them with us all week and clean and pack them every night before each outing. They usually use a rubber tote box which holds everything inside; we just add the food items. One of our guys brings a Coleman Guide Series 3 burner propane camp stove. Certainly not necessary but really out performs the gas stoves, especially for the fish. Still love the fire, we make sure to have a folding saw and small ax with us for processing the dead firewood. The Shore Lunch experience is the highlight of many Canadian trips and also the topic of many threads and discussions. It is a tradition that will remain on our trips indefinitely.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1069323,Bill Krejca,2008-12-19 15:42:00,6107,"Well, you'll need several skillets - one for the fish and one for the spuds. If you want to heat beans, another pan will maybe be needed, or pliers if the can is used as a pan, as well as maybe another small one burner stove, in addition to the 2 burner. Matches/lighter for the stove. Don't forget the can opener. If stoves are not used and a fire is lit, a grill is mighty handy. Add fire starter - paper,etc. Several bags to store the pans and dirty utensils. Also oil, mix, possibly egg or milk to make the mix stick, tongs, maybe some kind of pan to put the fish in as it is cooked. Paper towels, a container to put the used oil in, maybe with a funnel, a good hot pad, plastic bag to shake the mix, seasoning for the spuds and fish, several spoons for the beans and spuds. Oh yeah, don't forget the fish, spuds, onions and beans. Have a filleting knife and possibly a cutting/filleting board. Also maybe bread, butter, paper or whatever plates, forks, etc. That should give you a good start, if your folks like side dishes, chips, etc, add them. To be honest, as my friends and I continue to mature (read getting older), we have found that although eating out on the lake is real fun, trying to remember all the above stuff gets to be a sotra hastle, and we may just do the ""shore lunch"" right next to the cabin, where if we forget something, it is only a 20 ft journey to get it. Anyway, hope some of the above is useful, Bill Krejca"
1069399,Obabikon,2008-12-20 08:08:00,2370,"Many people are worried about cooking over an open fire. While it's more work, I think it's worth it. The hotter the flame the better... Just heat your oil up to the point a small chunk bubbles really well, and then cook. My opinion, the fire is more even if you lay the logs all in the same direction. Just ask the camp owners to mark a couple shore lunch spots in the area you're going to be fising! There's something about cooking a meal that you just caught in a natural setting with natural tools that perfects the experience."
1069964,SinOrSwim,2008-12-24 05:35:00,1528,"Cook over whatever you want. Open fire, gas, you name it. **********take a thermometer with you*********** One of those long thermometers that you would put in a turkey cooker pot. It doesn't matter what you cook over but if you have some sort of idea what the temp is you will avoid either burning the outside of the fish or having soggy oil soaked fish. Temperature control is key and it's a $3.00 tool that solves it all.Have fun!"
1069982,bogey,2008-12-24 07:03:00,87,"One other item that we have found invaluable is a pair of heavy leather gloves, (I borrowed a pair of welding gloves from a friend). They make gathering firewood and dealing with the smokin hot pans a bit less painfull.Bogey"
1070011,tackleman,2008-12-24 08:51:00,444,"One thing to remember is to check the fire danger with your lodge owner, there may be ""restricted fire regulations"" in place that will prevent you from having a campfire. Be prepared and have a cookstove with you.Don't forget, if you have a campfire, DROWN it when leaving and mix the entire fire site to ensure it is out completely, I know it sounds like common sense but I have found roaring campfires abandoned on our lake.Throw in a box of batter mix and add a beer to make the batter. It makes a great shore lunch."
1070018,Ogoki,2008-12-24 09:09:00,291,"Do a search and look up ""york pack"" . They make 2 sizes . Go with the smaller of the two . Waterproof and it floats . I have used this on numerous canoe trips also . Add to it one single burner Coleman stove along with a bottle of white gas . Campmor makes a red bottle just for fuel and it has a built in pout spout. Also I have two coated alumium skillets with fold up handles . DO NOT buy the steel stove as it will let the fish stick, even the caoted ones . I have a small kit that has utinsels , salt , pepper , small bottle of Olive oil or your choice of oil, paper plates with plastic plate holder , paper towels . Also I add a couple cans of ""porkbeans "" couple cans of fruit or pudding . I sometimes boils potatoes and take them along in pop cooler as they brownup quicker than frying raw potatoes . The York Pack is packed full at home and then at camp you can remove ethe extra canned food and ""stuff"" not needed in the boat . This system has received many compliments over the years . If it rains , nothing gets wet either ."
