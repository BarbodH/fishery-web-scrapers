Yes, we did get into North Channel this past summer and it did not let us down, probably the best fishing we had all week. In addition to the hog smallmouth we caught, we caught several very nice walleye. We even got a wild hair and portaged into the last lake (at that point it became very clear that I wasn't 25 years old anymore)."

Which fishing area do you feel my son and i could have the most success at northerns and smallies? We would like to go first or second week of june, would like to have decent fishing and the canadian experience versus crowds etc, i know its picky but want him to enjoy the experience, thanks. Looks like we can get Full american plans for what rough rock had for housekeeping rates??"

I wanna go someday in June and fish smallies. Thier fishng program really interest me. Always wanting to learn more."
1071751,Guest,2009-01-05 14:27:00,0,"You definately would not have to deal with ""crowds"" on Rough Rock (or that system for that matter), although I'm not sure you would be real happy with the pike fishing, the smallmouth can be outstanding the second week of June on that system."
1071753,wolverine fan,2009-01-05 14:36:00,71,"thanks Aaron-in, I actually spent quite a bit of time searching for your name in this register as I remembered you fished this system alot but didn't remember that you posted under guest status, anyway last time up to that sytem we really had a great time with the smallies!! weather wasnt the best and waves scary in the big water but man it was worth it. As you have seen, my other posts have been asking about boat rentals etc. i was wondering if you knew anyone/place that had that typer of trolling motor set up in minaki?? im reaching for straws I would love to go to roughrock but this economy isnt being knid right now to say the least!! anyway any help appreciated and maybe i'll see you up there this year, good fishin!! p.s. did u ever take that trip you threatened to do on the north channel???"

1072029,Bigfishhunter,2009-01-06 20:35:00,803,"Witch Bay is a great place to fish. I had a friend who worked there years ago, I went up to visit and I had a ball with the fishing. Great facilities. They have a nice fleet of boats and easy access for you to bring in your own if you so like. Anything you want is there, Musky, Pike, Walleye, Bass, and my favorite - Lakers. Although you have to do some travel from Witch Bay to find the Lakers. When I was there I did mostly walleye fishing and pike fishing. Caught three musky by accident in the weeds fishing for northerns with spoons. Caught lots of walleyes in the 4-6lb range. Awsome fishing for me."
