1071555,lassh,2009-01-04 14:30:00,553,For mono I like McCoy green line. For super lines I use Power Pro for heavier tests and Fireline for under 20# test.
1071559,bob oh,2009-01-04 15:52:00,3936,Been using Fireline for jigging and rigging; power pro for trolling but thinking of going all power pro.
1072037,Bigfishhunter,2009-01-06 20:46:00,803,"Power pro for me, it is better than fireline in my opinion, more supple and doesn't fray as easily. If I ever need a more stealthy approach that mono gives I just attach a length of mono onto the PP as a leader. All my rigs have PP on them."
1070961,brwhite,2008-12-31 19:39:00,41,"I'm planning on getting new line for all my reels and I'm wondering what everyone's favorite choice of line is and why. I want to see if I should be switchingI usually have 4 rod/reels in the boat:Trolling: Berkley® Trilene XT® Extra Tough LineJigging: P-Line® Floroclear Fishing LineLight Lures: (such as super rooster or a small storm):SpiderWire® Stealth Braided Fishing LineHeavy Lures: (such as a lucky craft 100 DD): SpiderWire® Stealth Braided Fishing LineEvery once in a while I'll bring a ""muskie"" rod to toss giant baits that I use the berkley on too."
1070973,Moondog,2008-12-31 23:53:00,362,We are hooked on Power Pro........small diameter line for larger diameter power. No stretch so you can feel the bites. Got turned onto it by flats fishermen in Florida............can load more on the spool preventing getting spooled out. Used it in Canada.......wonderful. mj
1070993,Fred_G,2009-01-01 08:05:00,908,"Trolling: Berkley XT 10 lbsJigging: Fireline (Flame Green) 6 lbsCasting: Power Pro 30 Braid, WhiteI am cahanging all of my casting reels to Power Pro because it stays round. The Spiderwire tends to flatten out over time, which I believe makes it bury into itself when a backlash occurs. Just my $0.02."
1071069,Guest,2009-01-01 17:02:00,0,Berkley fireline crystal or power pro
1071074,guidedfishing,2009-01-01 17:19:00,531,"All the Jigging and rigging rods all have either Power Pro or Fire Line, I like them both. All the slip bobber rods have mono, and the downrigger and planer board rods all have 20 or 30lb big game mono. I have a couple of musky rods with Fireline and a couple with mono. The fireline has alittle more bulk then Power pro and does not cut into the spool a much. If I'm in ultra clear water I will put a barrel swivel on and 20 - 25 in's for floro carbon leader. Most of the time I can not detect a difference with power pro of fireline tied directly to the jig. good luck GF"

1071123,lobo1,2009-01-02 05:55:00,734,"I have the big filler spool of PowerPro in the 50# = I use this on my heavy pike rods as well as my summer dipsey diver salmon rods. I have the big filler spool of 10#XT that go on all my big water walleye trolling rods (which I dont even take to canada). My medium spinning rods have a spools of 10 # Powerpro on them but I also keep spools of 8# XT and 6# Cajun Red. Powerpro, to me, is every bit as good as the Spiderwire but cheaper and comes in the big spools, that I can get wholesale!! lobo1"
1071135,bassface44,2009-01-02 07:44:00,96,Chalk another up for power pro. I have tried a lot of braids and it is by far the best. I also have some stren magnathin on some rods.
1071138,AllenW,2009-01-02 08:05:00,11482,"The old timer in me still uses Cortland for muskies and northerns, Stren blue for pan fish and for some of my walleye rods, as in some cases I like the bit of stretch it offers.I also have a few of the bass and walleye rigs set up with Power Pro, seems to work well but I don't like that type of line well enough to string all my rods with it.Seems each line has its good and bad points, and personal preference probably plays a big part in what kind of line to use.Al"
1071200,Pooch,2009-01-02 14:07:00,4619,"Over the last few years I've migrated to Power-Pro on everything except one jigging rod. On it I still enjoy jigging with mono. Still sometimes use braided when jigging as it has tremendous feedback, but mono is my jigging pick day in and day out. If I can get a way with 6# test I will. Otherwise I have to go with 8# for the rocky Canadian lakes. Power-Pro (15#) for trolling, bottom bouncing, casting plugs or anything else you can do with a baitcaster. I also have power-pro on a couple of spinning reels for throwing plugs that are too light for a bait caster. Pooch"
