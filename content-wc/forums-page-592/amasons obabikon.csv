The camp is at a great location; you will enjoy your stay. The crappie fishing is outstanding in the fall. Email me for more details. Bill Krejca"

I've heard the fall fishing is great around Obabikon Bay - we go in the spring so I can't comment directly on the fishing - but I can certainly comment on the camp. All I can say is you picked a great place to go.The cabins were clean and comfortable, they have a great cook and the ladies do a great job with the little details. Everyone is very friendly and personable. You can tell they enjoy working there. Jared has excellent equipment and I noticed him being very attentive to his guests. He even fillet's your fish for you and will cook up your shore lunch on the Weber. He gave us several spots to fish within 5 minutes of the camp. Enjoy your trip! Alan"
