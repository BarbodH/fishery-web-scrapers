1071153,wolverine fan,2009-01-02 09:04:00,71,"Thanks for all the help on my thread about help with my trip with my son. We are looking at the Minaki area but need help finding/renting a boat rental with a bow mounted trolling motor. That is the way i know how to fish, working the banks etc but it doesnt seem they are available in that area? Does anyone know of anyone in the area that would rent/lease their boat for five/six days in june? Any help appreciated and by the way happy new year!!"

1071210,JDP,2009-01-02 14:44:00,1457,Give Pat's Marine in Kenora a call. I remember a couple of groups that rented boats for their stay at a resort on Lac Seul. I know they are (at least were) a Lund/Mercury dealer.http://ontariomarinas.notjustfishing...tsmarine.shtml
1071223,wolverine fan,2009-01-02 16:11:00,71,Thanks for the info i will look into both options.thanks.
1071267,Moondog,2009-01-02 19:13:00,362,Rough Rock is a GREAT place but now very expensive. We went there twice in the '90's when previously owned by John and Gloria Haslett and you could pick some different options. Not now....out of my price bracket.
1071317,wolverine fan,2009-01-03 08:42:00,71,"Have to agree it looks very pricey especially with a 13 yr old who's learning to fish, thanks."
1071358,Larry Mac,2009-01-03 11:54:00,530,"Hi Wolverine fan, I also have to agree, I never used this camp, only seen they were in Minaki and rented the type of boat you required. I also have a 13 yr old son (youngest of three) and he has been to Canada 9 times. We always utilize Father and Son fishing packages and there are some nice ones out there. We always use the camp boats. We are going in June and the camp package is Saturday to Saturday ($725.00) total for the both of us ($605.00) if you go in July and August. We are going to a more remote camp we like in August. This one is ($1,237.00) for the both of us Saturday to Saturday, of course bait and taxes are extra. Lots of wildlife, waterfalls and portage lakes and my son can catch 15"" to 20"" walleye from the dock. Unfortunately they do not have the Bow mount trolling motor boats you like. My sons and I have been fortunate enough to experience many 100 to 175 fish per boat per day over the years and I believe they will remember these trips the rest of their lives. Wherever you and your son go have the time of your life and I hope it is the first of many.Thank you,Larry Mac"

I know its silly that I like to fish this way but its really the best way for me to fish and see whats ahead or beneath me, there are some dandy boulders in some of these places and after paying for one lower unit i find my comfort level is greatly increased by being up front and watching as i motor and fish along. I appreciate the info and give you credit for taking the kids with you!! PM me if you dont mind the type of camps/areas you have found that the kids like to fish, thanks."
