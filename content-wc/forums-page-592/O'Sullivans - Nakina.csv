You will find the fishing very good for a drive-to, and the owners friendly and happy to have you with them. We mainly target walleyes, so haven't spent much time on pike or trout. Using little live bait, and mostly Gulp minnows, last year the largest was a 30"" followed by 28"", 27"",and several 25"", and a bunch 20 - 25"". Plus many smaller for eating. A neat feature of the lake is that you don't have to travel very far to get into the fish, say a mile or so. Another neat feature of the camp is that it is affordable. We go in July so that we can take our boats, when were you thinking about going? You can email me for more details, pictures if you wish. Happy fishing, Bill Krejca"
1071851,Mr Ranger,2009-01-06 07:35:00,272,If you love catching walleye and lake trout you would love OS. We have been up five times and the fishing gets better every time. Have had good luck with the lake trout as well. The lake is huge and Superb is a pretty long boat ride from camp with the rental boats. We have caught fish there but have always done better on the main lake. Hopefully Big fish Bill will respond as well here as he also has become the OS KING of catching up there. I live in Wausau WI and would be happy to talk to you if you wanted to call. Bob and Shelly Richard live up in Tripoli WI and are great people. They and their two teenage kids bought the camp several years ago. They have worked hard at constant upgrades and keeping the prices affordable. We are going back the end of June this year as I had to pass last year and cannot wait. Good luck with your decision and if you wish give Bob a call and tell him Jerry from Wausau gave you the number. It is 715-564-2248. Good Fishing
