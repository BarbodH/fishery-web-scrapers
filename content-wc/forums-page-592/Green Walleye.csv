1071625,fishncamp,2009-01-04 23:22:00,49,If you are refering to greenbacks they are in Lake Winnipeg and Lake Manitoba. The limestone in the lakes give them the emerald green color and yes they are delicious.

You have to see one in person. On the Red River here in MB right now, anglers are pulling up 32 inchers on a regular basis. (hundreds in the 22-29 inch range) These walleye are fat, as the forage on shiners that are in the river system. There is a local website here that will show you a lot of the greenbacks being pulled out of the river through the ice. I don't feel its appropriate to post the link of this website, but googling manitoba anglers would make you a believer. Keep your rod tip up!"
