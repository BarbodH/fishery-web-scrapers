1073503,wolverine fan,2009-01-13 13:40:00,71,"He's 13 and never really fished other than panfish, but i know i owe it to him like my dad did and we had so much fun, actually take my dad as much as i can also."
1073512,Golden Eagle,2009-01-13 14:04:00,2642,"Wolverine fan, one of my guys lost his job several years ago and worked part time for several months at a lower salary. For sure there was no money for a fishing trip, but he squirreled away enough funds to handle a 7 day fly-in. Told his wife he won a free trip in the camp drawing that he had entered the year before. We had a great week of fishing. Don't think it would work more than one time though.Their marriage is still going strong.Ask yoursef, what would Bo do?"
1073517,wolverine fan,2009-01-13 14:20:00,71,"HHaaa I love it!!!! Though i dont condone it, he had bigger stones, if i may, than me!!! Our area just layed off 200 people and 3 large business have just closed their doors so i am trying to keep my head up about the economy but i dont want to fool myself (or my wife lol) but as for Bo, he would stay home with the TEAM THE TEAM THE TEAM!!!!! I hope i look back at this thread 4 months from now and see the light!!!!"
1073536,Nimstug,2009-01-13 15:52:00,2605,"W.F.Don't give up all together. I know you were looking at a June trip, but you could consider an August trip, right before school starts up. Maybe the extra 2 months could help with the situation.Keep the phone numbers of a couple of likely places in your ""back pocket"" and if things work out, give them a call. Nimstug"
1073538,Golden Eagle,2009-01-13 16:02:00,2642,"Bo would have righted the Tigers, sooner, if he'd been given a fair shot."
1073583,wolverine fan,2009-01-13 19:46:00,71,"Yea and he couldnt have stood by and watched the lions debacle happen either, even his three runs and a cloud of dust would have better to watch than the last seven or so years. Man don't get me started!!! After Illitch bought the tigers and became successful I knew that it took ownership that was involved in the success to win, anyway off task here, thank you to everyone who has given me ideas, support and enlightenment in this time, thanks"
1073271,Babamel2,2009-01-12 13:59:00,414,How is the economy affecting your fishing trip plans for this year?
1073273,cowboyd,2009-01-12 14:08:00,33,personally it won't affect mine or my groups but I would not be surprised in the least that after the fall circuit of shows leaves a lot more openings at the camps you might be able to get some pretty good deals.I was surprised how many camps raised prices and got pretty defensive when asked about why when fuel costs and the exchange rates were so drastically different this year.jmhoDick
1073355,Golden Eagle,2009-01-12 20:12:00,2642,Campowners were blindsided by cost increases during the 2008 fishing season. Rates were established before the big jump in costs. I want my outfitter to make a profit so he can continue his operation and provide me with good equipment. I'll not be complaining.I'll not be sitting out a season either.
1073362,TheGunShow,2009-01-12 20:45:00,3,"I'm still hoping that we'll be getting our two trips in this year...but the economy is crushing my business and I've had to pick up a second job. It might very well be that I'm going to have to pare it down to one this year. My wife is Canadian and really looks forward to these trips, but it is what it is. I don't want to find myself at this point next year, with a deepening recession, gnashing my teeth and wondering why I spent the money for two trips when I might need it to put food on the table."
1073369,Moondog,2009-01-12 22:12:00,362,"We drive to Gull Rock in our motor home pulling our Lund. Last year the diesel rates almost killed us but what the heck!!! 3 House payments later we get there! Great lake, fun, family, friends and oh did I mention lots of fish??? Still planning to go again next summer for 5 weeks. We stay at South Bay on Gull Rock Lake because the fishing is great and our motor home spot is just about the best you can get."
1073410,Guest,2009-01-13 07:41:00,0,Could the exchange rate have hurt those lodges that charge in U.S. funds? The lodge I go to just sent their newsletter and they have held the rates steady. They normally would have a small increase most years. For us the trip looks like it will be cheaper. Lower gas prices and a better exchange rate and so far we all still have jobs.
1073418,PIKEMAN330,2009-01-13 08:12:00,101,NO!
1073470,Obabikon,2009-01-13 11:23:00,2370,"The exchange rate hurt camps last summer... however, this summer it will help them. Resorts that charge in US funds take that risk..."
1073471,Obabikon,2009-01-13 11:25:00,2370,"On the topic of the economy, I think it'll be ok. Some of the top end places might see a decline. I had several conversations with guests that usually go to one of the Totem resorts... That tells me that people who usually spend 2-3k or more on their trip, are looking to save some."
1073487,wolverine fan,2009-01-13 12:30:00,71,"Can't lie, I told my son i would love to take him to canada fishing but i cant book now like i have done in the past due to the economy. I own my own business and owe myself and my employees to not spend any money until we really see what this year holds. I know when they see me not booking my fishing trip early they know its serious this year. Hope in a couple months i am scrambling for a camp to let me in but for now im planning a 2 day lake erie trip, good luck to all of you this year."
