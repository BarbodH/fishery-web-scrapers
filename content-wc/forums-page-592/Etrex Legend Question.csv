1071128,bassface44,2009-01-02 07:15:00,96,Does anyone here know for sure if you can get garmin's blue chart for Lake of the Woods on disc and download it to this GPS unit. I know the unit doesn't have removable memory so the chip is out. Just wondering. And if you can download it can you download it to several units? Thanks for your help as always.

Refer to the compatibility box on the right side of this page:http://www8.garmin.com/cartography/m...rtAmericas.jspThe discontinued Hot Spots v4 has L.O.W. Maybe you can find it on E-Bay?http://www8.garmin.com/cartography/m...Reg.html#reg15From what I can see of the Minnesota Lakemaster map, it looks like they only cover part of the notch of L.O.W.https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?...00#coverageTabMaybe shoot Garmin an e-mail to see what they have.
