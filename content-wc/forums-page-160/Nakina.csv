How have you found Red Lake in comparison to the Nakina lakes?CheersWW"
6081169,onetimedave,2018-03-23 16:23:00,502,Talked to Jason owner of Boreal Forest Outposts last eve. He relayed that ground is still covered with snow and no sign of thaw. Jason and wife Sue did many upgrades to Melchett Lake camp and are many of the same being done to Kayedon Lake this spring. One great one is solar at both camps. Melchett is sold out for year but just a few weeks available for Kayedon. Our group is going to Kayedon and flying June 8. Can't wait and June can't come soon enough.
6086153,hoppy63,2018-03-25 20:41:00,367,I will be at kayedon the 23rd with another outfit. Will definitely go check updates at bfo cabin. Stayed there few years back. Do you or anyone have any experience with na kina cabins? Will be staying night there this year and have no idea of what they are like.

6086689,vteye3,2018-03-26 06:58:00,496,Hoppy are you asking about the camp at Kayedon? Glad to provide you details.

6089377,hoppy63,2018-03-27 04:10:00,367,"No sir...asking about place to stay the night before we fly out. R&D, pennocks were booked. Believe the name of this place is Nakina cabins . Just looking for some info on them. But I will also gladly take any info on kayedon...."
6089393,Namegosikaa,2018-03-27 04:41:00,61,"Cordinley lake cabins is a very nice establishment, if they have vacancy you will be happy with it. Nakina air also has a overnight cabin by the air base which I've heard nothing but great things about, besides that the only other one I can think of is the whiskey jack b&b that the Mackie' s have on cordinley lake road. Also a nice cabin that sleeps 8."
6089921,hoppy63,2018-03-27 08:40:00,367,"Yes, thank you. It is cordingly lake cabin. Said he was located near leuenbergers, who we are flying in with this trip. I am glad to hear they are nice. Thanks again for replying."

6102474,hoppy63,2018-04-01 15:08:00,367,"Walleye Wanderer.....kind of blast from the past for me. You gave me info on Kap several years back, and then we met the next year I believe when your crew went to Beteau, and I believe a couple of your crew did not fair so well on flight, if memory serves me correct! At any rate thanks for info and good to hear from you. We have basically been bouncing back and forth between red lake and nakina. Cant wait to get back!"
