6201386,prov1800,2018-05-29 09:38:00,5010,Took 4 guys out of Clarke's northern lights on Sunday.hot and sunny like its been and a slight breeze.main catch was walleye so we concentrated on showing them some spots as we made our way down the lake.pretty much each spot we caught walleyes some spots shallow like 2-3 ft and others had fish down to 15 ft.so no real pattern but active fish on all spots.around 1:30 we headed to peephole.very busy in there and crappies not very aggressive even with the 74 f water temps.left there for another spot and hit the mother load.took us around 1 he to put 60 in the boat.headed back to Clarke's after that with 4 pretty happy fisherman.weather going to remain warm but some stormy weather showing up on the weather app.all in all looks like a good beginning. I'll be on lac suel next week and give a report for that.

6202386,prov1800,2018-05-31 06:59:00,5010,here are 2 happy fisherman that followed me on a guide day out of clarkes on cedar lake.water temps were 74 f at this particular crappie spot.there was apost that cedar lake was struggling I beg to differ.i would say fisherman struggle not lakes.
6202394,prov1800,2018-05-31 07:24:00,5010,Every time I go on walleye central I have to log in even though I tick the stay logged in box.i always end up at the enhanced page to.which I can't figure out how to post there.so I exit that to go to regular page.tried to post pics and they don't show up.????.anybody else have this problem.this would be using my cell phone.no problems on my laptop.
6202956,rockape,2018-06-01 10:07:00,215,"I did say that Cedar sucked in 2016 when I was there. 2014 and 2015 were two of the best fishing trips I have ever had with walleyes to 30 and muskies to 54. I must have left my A game at home. Only bad year I have ever had out of 15. Pretty bad when you have to eat smallmouth because the walleyes weren't biting! I would fish Cedar again without hesitation. Great lake. My roots are Lac Seul and Minnitaki though. My main beef with Cedar is the lack of big pike. The muskies must dominate and thin out the pike population. I just might have not found the right pike spots spending 3 weeks looking for them. Was pike fishing when I stuck the 54 inch musky. Walleye fishing suddenly shut off which usually means a gator has entered the area. Put the jigging rig down and cast the big stuff to catch the pike so I can get back to walleye fishing. Well, it ended up being the fish of a lifetime on my 3rd cast. I didn't care about walleyes after that!"
