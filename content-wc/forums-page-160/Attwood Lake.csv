6200640,Guest,2018-05-27 12:22:00,0,Can anyone comment on Attwood Lake West for this year or last. Curious as to the accommodations if one needs to travel afar to find fish. Thank YOu. Bob

6202018,SterlingArcher,2018-05-30 12:15:00,92,"Lots and lots of points and bays on the lake. The best shorthand guide is to (surprise surprise) fish the windblown points and cover water til you find fish. It has been some years since I have been there, but I bet it's still a pretty simple lake to pattern like it was 10 years ago. Start shallow and work out from there. Many of the narrows areas have bad rocks, so be careful navigating through those til you are comfortable with the track you need to follow. Good luck!"
6202054,Guest,2018-05-30 13:19:00,0,Thank you Mr. SterlingArcher it is really appreciated! The rocks make me a little nervous seeing we have fished Mojikit the last five years but it does look very interesting as Mojikit could get really windy real fast. Have a safe & great year fishing in Canada. Don't see a lot of posts on here about this lake.
