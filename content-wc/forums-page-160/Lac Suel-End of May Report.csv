We selected Lost Island Lodge for 5 days of fishing. The boat ramp was about ¼ mile from a paved road and the lodge and cabins were on an island a 5 minute boat ride from the ramp. Car storage was in a fenced area away from the boat ramp. The staff was very helpful and carried out luggage from the car to the boat and to the cabin and back which was very nice as we are both in our 60's. We selected the guided all meals plan so that we could enjoy more worry free time. The resort has options available for those who want to bring their own boat and be their own guide or cook some or all of their meals. We fished with guides Basil and Sam and picked up a few new tricks from both of these talented guides. I can count on one hand the people I have fished with over the years who could compare to these two guys. The food was excellent. Ribs, chicken, pork and steaks. Tasty dessert if you still had room. The fishing was the outstanding. My wife and I went thru 7 dozen minnows the first day and increased it to 10 dozen the next day and 14 dozen each day thereafter and still ran short or ended up cutting our minnows into thirds. We lost count of the totals but I am sure it was over 100 walleyes each day for my wife and me. The biggest walleye I caught was just over 27. My wife caught a fat 42 northern on a jig and a minnow. It made so many runs it is a miracle it made in into the boat. Lots and lots of slot plus walleyes. We fished in the rocks in 5-8 feet and in soft bottoms of 3-8 feet. The soft bottom between two points produced more and bigger walleyes. All of the fish were on pink and white or green and yellow and white ¼ or 3/8 jigs. The majority of the time there were no other boats fishing within sight and only a few who roared by. The area is full of history and several islands have small monuments to local pilots who died in WWII with flags flying by each. A local WFW post produced a nice full sized fishing map of the SE section of the lake and information about the monuments on the other side for a small donation. The only downside is that the fiberglass reproduction for my wife of the northern will be expensive ..but it will provide a great memory and have her ready to go back next time."
6202624,IaDave14,2018-05-31 15:19:00,99,I have been there once and hope to get back again. We fished with Basil for 2 days and had a blast as he has a unique humor and personality. If I remember his wife cooks and they are from Labrador. Did he tell you about the time they hosted Babe Winkleman? He is a master at the shore lunch and got us on fish even though the conditions were tough- Upper 80's and no wind or clouds. This was around Labor Day. It was one of my favorite trips.

He did my 45.5 pike and 54"" musky. Let me try to attach pics. A lot of taxidermists SUCK at pike replicas because the white spots don't look real at all. Not the case with Joe! Yeah, it is expensive, but it takes him close to a year to get it done due to his backlog because he is THAT GOOD!"
6202894,SterlingArcher,2018-06-01 08:25:00,92,"That's some good fishing - thanks for a great report! I'm kinda curious about why you went through so many minnows, though. I've had 150+ fish days on Lake Savant, and not used more than 3 dozen minnows for my boat. Maybe I am just too stubborn in sticking with raggedy minnow scraps to conserve them"

Never went anywhere else for the next 14-15 yrs, often twice a season. The Hayes family, Basil and Vivian, other staff, location, accommodations, etc., all top notch. In Florida now, but if we ever decided to travel to the North Country again, it would be to Lost Island. Here is a little secret---if you are standing on the docks, learn to fish the 3 little islands to your right, 3 minutes from camp."
