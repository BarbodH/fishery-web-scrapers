Will there be anyone else reading this that will be on the water in this area during these dates? My fishing partner and I are planning on putting in at Deception landing and putting the miles in to get up to Bear Narrows areas, etc... of course will end up fishing some areas closer to the landing as well.If you will be there, feel free to reply, or PM me. Perhaps we could share contact info and hook up while on the water or off. I will be in a red Skeeter WX2060 with an Etec 250 G2. If you see me, stop by if you'd like."
6202990,Slim03,2018-06-01 11:42:00,159,I won’t be up there till the 30th. Be careful there’s lots of hazards but excellent fishing.
6203054,PRO-V16,2018-06-01 13:52:00,454,If my medical procedure works I will be there the 15th - 23rd or 24th. Stay at my buddies outpost cabin west of Taylor Island. Hard to say if fish will be around Bear Narrows then in numbers. Sometimes they are and sometimes they are starting to hit the reefs. Lot's of possibilities up there.

Most of them would be east or northeast of the Narrows, but only another 5-10 minutes once you clear the narrows. Also include your email address and I'll send you a lengthy email chain that I have pasted together over the last few years for a lot of other fellas on this forum. Having a map to look at while reading the email makes it easier to understand the spots that are marked on the map.You'll have a blast on your trip. By far this lake is my favorite and the section you are going to is classic Canadian Shield with big walleye, pike and musky.PjShorthorn"
