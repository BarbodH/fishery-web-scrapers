In that spirit, one of our guys had this logo designed for the group. I thought it was pretty cool. We will be flying into International Falls this Friday, June 1, crossing the border and driving up to Dryden that afternoon. On Saturday morning, June 2, we'll finish our drive to Ear Falls and will be returning the following Friday, June 8. If any of you see one of us wearing a shirt with this logo, please introduce yourself and say hello."

We now have polo shirts, t-shirts, hats, fishing jackets, winter jackets, drink coasters, pint glasses, rocks glasses, luggage tags, business cards, flags, banners and a few more things I'm probably forgeting!"

Looking forward to escaping this Indiana heat and humidity with some fresh Canadian air. Looks like the cool down is coming...
