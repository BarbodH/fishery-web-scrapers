That'll give you water height levels at several spots, including Lac Seul.The maps are printed, and the target elevation for the lake in 1167 ft. at that point, or slightly below, the Rags should be passable for about any boat, including houseboats.We're at 1165.6 feet as of yesterday, and it's expected to rise 4-8 inches over the next week."

For the past three days I've been running them wide open, trimmed high. 2.6 ft is currently the lowest in the rags. Shortcut is 3-4ish. Most people are putting through. I just know the exact stump free path to be on. It's rising daily, lots of floating timber through the lake on calm mornings."
6200828,tv4fish,2018-05-28 05:31:00,2694,"Colin: I am surprised to read that - with the low water level, I wouldn't think that any wood on the shorelines would end up out in the water this year?? One thing I do know is that if there is a lot of floating timber and it is windy (and you can't see that wood) - it is NOT a pleasant experience to hit that stuff going 40 mph !!"
6201256,David Anderson,2018-05-28 22:12:00,2073,Last Monday we came through the Rags. Idled through as the last part (heading back to deception bay) as it was 1.5 feet. Made it OK but we went slow. You'll be fine just watch the depth as it was the last 100 yard that was tight. Of course that was a week ago.

6201494,pjshorthorn,2018-05-29 12:46:00,5654,"Been through that stretch many a time in my personal boat and navigating a houseboat. That is a prop eating machine if you don't know how to navigate it. Low water conditions may actually be easier as you would see more of the deadheads sticking out of the water and be able to see the channel more clearly defined. The other stretch of water that has a similar navigational challenge is the channel in and out of Scaler Lake. Seen a bunch of guys on the wrong side of the stumps bouncing around there too. With experience comes confidence,but those two areas still make me pucker up a bit. PjShorthorn"
