A slow warm up so far,Fish should be on the shallow side with the cold water temps.I have 6 true jiggers this yr,looking to set a new 7 day record on Hebert. Good luck to all heading North"
6202954,Doublelung76,2018-06-01 10:05:00,42,"save a few for my son and me Octane!we'll be up the week after your group I believe,good luck to u and your crew"
6200224,Freytown,2018-05-26 05:12:00,770,I will put this to rest until next Spring. It took about one week longer this year to clear the ice....winter just held on it seems. Good fish and please post the fishing reports. FT
6200352,tweedrules,2018-05-26 13:32:00,107,Just got an email from Norman at Air Mt Laurier. We are going to Lac du Male 7/1. He said the Gouin is down 4 feet from last year.
6200488,kyle870,2018-05-27 05:41:00,26,Anyone that was at the gouin give a water level report heard anywhere from 2-5 ft lower than 2017
6200500,tshea,2018-05-27 06:28:00,36,two feet lower than last year and about 4-5 feet lower than all time high mark. I have been up here for 10 days - water level appears to be going up about and 1/2 an inch a day 59 degrees at the surface and about 51 degrees 6 feet down. Fishing is slow.
6200508,tshea,2018-05-27 06:37:00,36,Black line is the all time high White line is the normal level - if there is such a thing ha ha Pictures were taken yesterday.
6200574,Freytown,2018-05-27 08:54:00,770,Thxs for the update tshea.
6200580,kyle870,2018-05-27 09:26:00,26,Thanks can't beat that live report with pictures! Going the 8th be dodging some of the old rocks from the past ha! One yr we thought we knew the place well and there's a seagull standing on one leg sleeping out in the abyss it was a mountain under him ignorance breeds confidence. Thanks again
6200608,Buckmaster6532,2018-05-27 10:55:00,8,"We leave this coming Friday for 2 weeks at Baie du Nord, so this information is very much appreciated. I have been told from several sources that the water level is rising and, with the forecast, the water temp will certainly be rising as well. Thanks for all the updates."
6200704,tshea,2018-05-27 18:46:00,36,So the fish finally woke up today - good fishing everywhere - have fun folks we are heading back home tomorrow.
6200906,kyle870,2018-05-28 09:46:00,26,"What part of the gouin are you at? Seems to take us about 3to4 days to get our mojo going really need 2wks. Bucket list, to stay for a whole season fish the full cycle bet some interesting things could be found."
6197296,Freytown,2018-05-20 13:33:00,770,Both the Gouin and Hebert are slowly going ice free. Good news! FT
6197874,octanehi5,2018-05-21 16:18:00,1104,"spoke to air tam today,Gouin is still not ice out,Hebert may not be ready for this weekend opener sold ice"
6198192,Freytown,2018-05-22 07:31:00,770,"Hebert still has a lot of ice while the Gouin is clearing up fast. The northern areas of the Gouin are usually the last to open. Baieâ€™s Adolphe Poisson; Hanotaux; Mattawa; Saraana; Plamondon; South & East all open and ready to fish. IMO, Hebert should be close to ice free by 5/26 opener. Cloud cover the next few days will hamper any clear satellite images. FT"
6198418,Freytown,2018-05-22 14:24:00,770,"Temps 74F in Clova today, the ice goes quickly. Cloud cover over Hebert block ice cover view but the Gouin has lost a lot of ice in 1 day. FT"
6199008,Freytown,2018-05-23 12:41:00,770,"It looks like Hebert should be fine for saturday opener, most ice gone. Good fishing for all going in 5/26. FT"
6199098,octanehi5,2018-05-23 15:40:00,1104,"I think they flew in to Hebert today,to get the camps ready,thats one late ice out"
6199292,Buckmaster6532,2018-05-24 04:28:00,8,Any word on the current Gouin water level?
6199352,Freytown,2018-05-24 06:46:00,770,"Some pic's I have seen on Facebook, it appears to be down 4-5 feet from full pool. The last two years the opener had very high water. Maybe those who fished early will chime in on their experience. FT"
6199460,tshea,2018-05-24 09:21:00,36,I am up at gouin now - water level is down about 5 feet from high water mark. Not terrible but realistically down 2 feet from last year at this time. Ice on Mattawa Bay went out friday night. Lots of wind and sun the last few days so I suspect most of the south ice should be out by now. Fishing is slow - water is very cold - not sure if fish are even spawning yet.
6199474,Buckmaster6532,2018-05-24 09:53:00,8,Thank you for your information. Down 2 feet from last year's high water at this time does not sound too bad but the COLD water can really make catching fish difficult.
