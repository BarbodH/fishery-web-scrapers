6202938,rockape,2018-06-01 09:38:00,215,"I buy my fishing license in the states before I leave. I catch enough walleye and pike to keep my belly full for the week! Walleyes are like $13 each with the license price! We bring almost all of our food from the states. Venison, turkey, anything we have shot. I also bring a ton of bacon and sausage from my annual pig. Now one thing you have to buy in Canada is their RYE BREAD!!! They have this down, and it's all we use for all of the sandwiches we make for the boat. We buy all of the condiments and meat in the states. Maybe some eggs in Canada if my buddy's chickens don't get killed by a yotee. Man, you must think we are country bumpkins! I'm a big city boy from Chicago that now lives in Indy! Now who has run out of food in Canada? We have!! Had a couple of teens with us that ate everything they could chew. Tough couple of days eating nothing but fish!"
6202102,BlueJayBert,2018-05-30 14:53:00,15,Heading to Perreault Lake June 22. We usually buy our groceries in Fargo and stay the night in Winnipeg. Any ideas if it would be better or cheaper to buy the groceries in Kenora?? Thanks for any ideas/suggestions.
6202132,x4flatfish,2018-05-30 16:09:00,319,"Have you ever bought groceries in Canada? Groceries are way more expensive there, even with the current exchange rate. Buy in Fargo unless hauling them is a problem. No question in my mind."
6202160,martinbns,2018-05-30 17:15:00,1520,More expensive in Canada and no where near the selection you will be used to. If I was buying said groceries in Canada though I would be shopping in Winnipeg. Kenora grocery stores are smaller again than what you are used to. Where do you stay in Winnipeg?
6202180,btyreprich,2018-05-30 17:59:00,1067,"i love Canada and everything it has to offer - except for the prices on things like gas and groceries! We used to pick up a few items at the Walmart in Dryden and I was absolutely shocked at the prices on staple items: bread, milk, eggs, etc. It didn't take long for us to realize that our group should buy another cooler and buy some of these items in our home state. The cost of the cooler was recouped quickly based on the lower costs of these items in the US. Better selection of grocery items in your home state as well."
6202182,Walleye2242,2018-05-30 18:00:00,263,For me...and my thoughts only...but in kenora. For me... i buy all my groceries in red lake when we go to Gullrock. Just dont like to haul them up. I also like to support the area we are going to and buy local groceries up there. Just easier for us and our opinion only.
6202228,Bill Krejca,2018-05-30 19:28:00,6107,"I buy local, but do pick up perishables such as eggs, spuds, milk, and bread,etc., in Canada. I purchase meat on sale locally and freeze, getting the groceries includes multiple trips to the store, but I enjoy the planning, etc. I always look forward to eating the Canadian bread, U.S. bakeries do not have the formula for anything which resembles great Canadian bread. I try to get the bread from a larger store, my experience had been that wilderness stores may not always have as fresh of bread. Bill"
6202262,martinbns,2018-05-30 20:23:00,1520,"Either way make sure you stop for coffee at the bakery on the north side of the Trans Canada in Vermillion Bay. They do individual french press coffees for about $3, fantastic."
6202400,CreteHusker,2018-05-31 07:35:00,20,We buy perishables in the states and non-perishables in Kenora. We've found over the years that we buy too much food and end up bringing a lot back. We also buy bottled water in Kenora due to its weight. We are considering stopping in Steinbach for groceries this year. We figure to avoid Winny and get our food at the same time. 15 days.
6202422,bigwalleye1,2018-05-31 08:04:00,2632,"If I can freeze it or cook it ahead of time at home I do so. Frozen food substitutes for ice in the cooler. The eggs, milk, bread, fresh veggies are bought in Sioux Lookout."
6202652,ackermannsacre,2018-05-31 16:31:00,196,I don't remember seeing anything other than a concession trailer open in Vermillion Bay when we were up there two years ago.
