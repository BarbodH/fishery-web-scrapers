6201334,LoDo,2018-05-29 07:42:00,721,Last year there was some energy on this board with the amount of minnows that can cross the border from US to Canada. I apologize in advance if this topic has been covered this year and I missed it. Is there is per person cap on how many minnows can come across the border? Does it have to do with minnows that are alive compared to borax'd / frozen?
6201342,pjshorthorn,2018-05-29 07:59:00,5654,"10 dozen salted minnows per angler can be transported into Canada. No live minnows are allowed.Having said that, that was for last year. It may have changed for this season. Check out the regs to be sure.PjShorthorn"
6201380,LoDo,2018-05-29 09:23:00,721,I dug a little more and found the answer. 10 doz per angler is correct. Doesn't look like there is a limit on crawlers assuming they're packed correctly. 10 doz per angler makes the coordination of traveling a bit of an ordeal for a few of us as this is fly in trip. Two of the eight drive through Int Falls and catch the flight in from Chimo Air in Red Lake. The other six fly from Denver to Winnipeg and direct into camp. We'll figure it out.
6201384,5thsuit,2018-05-29 09:33:00,54,"We have the same issue, 3 out of 6 flying into Winnipeg from California, I usually bring all the salted minnows from Wisconsin and we meet in Minnesota. Hopefully they don't look to closely this year? Two years ago they were tough, last year not so much? No live bait allowed on our lake."
6201642,Baseline,2018-05-29 17:37:00,3207,Check the regs.....last year at the Fort Francis border station there was a sign advising those crossing that preserved minnows must be in a sealed package and be from an approved bait packer.
6201722,LoDo,2018-05-29 20:31:00,721,"The six coming from Denver are going to salt and freeze 10 doz per person a few nights before our flight, checked luggage with a yeti and push forward. Not a deal breaker, just a small hiccup in the itinerary."
6201796,CI_Guy,2018-05-30 06:11:00,2118,"I've had much better luck with salted minnows that have not been frozen. Frozen ones always seem to get mushy when they thaw, lose color and don't stay on the hook as well as ones that have never been frozen. I've kept minnows I cured in canning salt and borax for over 2 months in a fridge or cooler without spoilage."
6202272,nitroman,2018-05-30 20:35:00,368,"Could you bring them up alive, release them into the water on the Minnesota side, and have them meet younin Canada? Would take some planning and training to gain their trust but......."
6202610,PRO-V16,2018-05-31 14:51:00,454,You could but it's illegal to release minnows into the lake in Minnesota...
