6201310,SteveZ,2018-05-29 06:52:00,271,Unfortunately JR (Jim Armstrong) passed away opening weekend. Those folks who have reservations have been notified that refund checks will be sent out soon. I have had the pleasure of staying at JR's for a week in June for the last 10 years. He made lots of improvements to the camp in Ear Falls. Hopefully someone will take over and continue what JR was striving to do. Tight lines my friend!
