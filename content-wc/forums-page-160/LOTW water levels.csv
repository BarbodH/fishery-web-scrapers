6202932,Obabikon,2018-06-01 09:29:00,2370,"Water levels are still low, but nothing like they were 3-4 weeks ago. Water has been steadily on the rise. I would say a foot and a half down compared to normal pool. Here's an interesting graff....https://www.lwcb.ca/pdf/LakeoftheWoo...2018.05.31.pdf They have the outflow completely shut down still, so they're adding water to the lake relatively quickly. I'm going to guess it will be back to normal in 3 weeks."
6202934,Obabikon,2018-06-01 09:33:00,2370,Looking a little closer at the link I sent you... Current mean elevation right now is 1058.5 feet... the average for this time of year is 1059.5 So... 1 foot low.
