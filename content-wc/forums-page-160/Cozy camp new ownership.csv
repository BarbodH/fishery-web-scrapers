6200392,northerneyes,2018-05-26 16:20:00,72,I was wondering if anyone can give any feedback on the service at Cozy Camp since new owners have taken over. Previous owners were great. Thanks
6201984,NorthernExposure,2018-05-30 10:50:00,6,Can you give me some info on how cozy camp was under the old ownership? I plan on taking my 10 year for his first Canadian trip next year and am leaning toward this camp. Any info on the fishing would be appreciated.

Good location for people who want the safety of smaller waters but you can out go into bigger waters. Good northern in the smaller lakes that are all along the river. Good walleye fishing near the rapids at Talking Falls and on the other side of the portage. We had best luck with various spinners with nightcrawlers. Also good walleye at the rapids between Barrel Lake and Press lake.some good places along the river also. Good opportunity to see moose and bear. We have been there four times and always see them. Hope this helps, ask if you have specific questions."
6202088,NorthernExposure,2018-05-30 14:26:00,6,"Thanks for the info, are there a lot of hazards in the water or do they have it pretty well marked. I have hit my share of Canadian rocks in lakes! It would be a long drive up to Barrell if you had to do it at 5 mph. I only have a 15 hp motor so I won't be like I am flying up there. But don't want to spend 4+ hours a day in boat travel."

Using the boats and motors provided by Cozy Camp it normally took 35-45 minutes to reach Barrel. Lots of submerged rocks in the pool ahead of the rapids going into Press Lake, just be careful there. You will catch walleyes there. I think the previous owner supplied 15 hp motors for two persons per boat and 20 hp for three people per boat. I think the boats were different sizes too but not certain."
