6194628,BornToFish,2018-05-15 16:26:00,1224,"Greetings,I heard today that a fire ban is now in place in NW Ontario that likely encompasses Red Lake, Kenora and Dryden areas - maybe more or less. You might want to consult with you lodge owner if you plan to have a shore lunch.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6195470,Bakefish,2018-05-17 07:00:00,1077,Does that include outdoor grills?
6195484,martinbns,2018-05-17 07:14:00,1520,"Not gas or propane, I don't know about charcoal."
6195500,prov1900,2018-05-17 07:34:00,544,"According to my weather source, Sioux Lookout is projected to get a couple inches of rain in the next 48 hours. That should help with a lot of things."
6195618,Obabikon,2018-05-17 10:37:00,2370,I was getting some supplies and checking the mail yesterday. They were at the border handing out fire ban fliers.
6199040,jvoigt,2018-05-23 13:47:00,1,Keep an eye on this fire ban in NW Ontario. Anglers Kingdom on Nungesser lost buildings to fire this week and it looks like there is an uncontrolled fire burning at Borel Lake (Howey Bay outpost?). I wouldn't want to be the fisherman that causes one of these.
6202690,bigdaddyguns,2018-05-31 18:26:00,608,The fire ban has been lifted according to cbc http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunde...fted-1.4682333 How have the lake levels responded to the recent rains?
6202948,Fisherman Ted,2018-06-01 09:58:00,461,Daytime burning is still not allowed.
