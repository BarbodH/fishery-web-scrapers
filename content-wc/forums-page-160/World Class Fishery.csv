6202358,Fishingframes,2018-05-31 05:54:00,33,Lake Simcoe in southern Ontario is a gem of a fishery. Close to Toronto and we're targeting whitefish - big whitefish. A fish that's gained popularity in the last decade for their size and quality eats. I was fortunate to fish with guide Peter and captured the day. https://youtu.be/PQ8Sro8ZvIo
