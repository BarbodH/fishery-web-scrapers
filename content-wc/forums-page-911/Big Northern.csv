523460,Guest,2003-01-05 02:03:00,0,"I took the sum of the square root of the ages of the four kids in the picture divided it by the 2 x 4 width of 3.49999 inches multiplied it by the digital measurement from the pikes eye to the gill plate converted the answer to metric added the GST and then converted back to inches multiplied by 8.5 (the width of the both hands) and came up with 70"" exactly (well almost 69.999"" I rounded up).Whatever the measurement its a big Pike boys...."
523461,Guest,2003-01-06 07:50:00,0,Sarge.....Good job....would you start measuring my fish?? Did you compensate for light refraction when you did your calculation???
523449,Northern Manitoban,2002-09-13 13:45:00,195,"Hey Eddie,glad you did well wow alot of trophys!i had a great year lots of nice fish.Winter is on its way so not many boat days left.was suppose to be going to Reed lake this weekend for Lakers and walleye's but my partner got sick,so i'm stuck home! oh well.take care."
523450,Guest,2002-09-20 14:52:00,0,">http://www.hunting-pictures.com/memb...20Northern.jpg Big Fish,no doubt about it ! but 70 inches no way. maybe mid 50's. Just mesure the hands against the fish, average man has 4 inch hands across. check out www.BushmanOutfitters.com , some 50 + inch pike pictures there, you tell me if that pike is 70 inches. my friend caught one on Lake Evans in Quebec 53"" and the 70 incher wasn't much bigger looking than his."
523451,Northern Manitoban,2002-09-20 21:11:00,195,"Pike hunter.No doubt those are nice fish also.But look at that first picture,how far is this guy holding it away from him,one arm is almost straight.The Native fellow has this monster on his lap,with all his kids besides him.Read the article.I believe the results they got from scanning the picture is pretty accurate.I fish alot in Canada,guide also,and i believe fish like this is possible.FISH ON."
523452,Guest,2002-09-21 05:24:00,0,"No doubt, that is a Big Fish. but it looks like the Native guy is sitting, and the pike is overhanging his knees. but it is still BIG, but 70 inches ??tight lines and fish on , thanks ! be safe."
523453,bobnalong,2002-11-15 09:28:00,10,"big fish, yes.but well under 60 inches.holding fish in front of body increases apparent size in inverse proportion to distance from camera.i watched unedited promotional film from start-up resort in which anglers were coached on how to hold fish to make them appear bigger than they actually were. very effective.angling legends are very similar to ""urban legends"". repeat the same story often enough and it becomes fact. eyewitnesses even appear to an event that never happened. when i was younger, i heard several people attest to knowledge of the 103 lb. muskie shocked/netted by the wisconsin dnr out of lake amnicon in douglas county. an article, authored by the wi dnr, on the possibility of a muskie exceeding louis spray's record of 69 lb 15 oz coming out of wisc waters mentioned this myth, and several others.the dnr denied all the supermuskie stories, and opined that a 70 lber was possible but unlikely. i realize i am convincing a very few individuals. believe what you wish. but next time you want to convince reasonably knowledgeable anglers of a record fish, present more evidence than a photo and a sensational headline.specifically, a tapemeasure and a scale would ""hold water"".bob"
523454,Guest,2002-11-16 08:11:00,0,"You simply need to scale the fish based on something the same distance as the fish- the fishermans hands, or even if not his hands the hands that can be seen under the fish.I put it in my autocad program and scaled it to One fist=4"" and it is 12 fists long. Given the size of the guy holding it, about my size, maybe I'm a little bigger, the closed hand would be about 4 inches. Let's give him 5"" hands for giggles. 12*5 is 60""Big fish, but not 70 inches in my opinion. Measure your hand and make your decisions."
523455,Steve,2002-11-19 07:35:00,259,"First of all, let me state fully that this is definitely a great catch that should(and did) deserve recognition. I used the 2x4 in behind him (using 3-1/2) as a reference, and measured the fish on the screen at 8-1/2 inches long. Granted, a very rough measurement shows 68 inches, and the fish is well in front of the 2x4. So..I took the man's hand at 4.5 inches (4 inches for a fist, a little wider for more open hands) and again, a rough measurement of the hand in the picture showed 3/4 inch. calculating in this mannner I found the fish to be right around 51 inches.A nice fish nonetheless, but it is definitely NOT 70 inches as the article stated. The article even stated they used the 2x4 as a reference, which creates the innaccuracy due to distance in front of the camera. The actual meausrement will never be known, but it is still a great fish, and his family was well fed (which is what really counts here....for his family to be nourished)Steve"
523456,TomPGrouse,2002-11-20 13:37:00,124,The way I measured it (comparing hands to fish) comes out at 56 inches for a four inch hand and 70 inches for a five inch hand. His hand is hard to see as far as whether or not his thumb is showing in the picture. I think it is. It is possible he has a fish approaching 60-70 inches. A 4.5 inch hand would make this a 63 inch fish. Whatever the size it is a big one.
523457,Guest,2003-01-02 11:58:00,0,"Another good way of figuring the length of the fish is to compare the length of the fish to the width of the guys head. The distance from ear to ear varies only a little from person to person. Say 5.5 inches (check it yourself). Then see how many times greater the length of the fish is than the width of the guys head. I figure the pike is about 10.35 times as wide as the guys head. That works out to 59 inches. However, you have to figure that the fish is at least a foot away from the man's body (after all there is a kid in between him and the fish) and you have to account for a magnification effect from the fish being closer. Even if the photographer was ten feet away, that would be at least 3 or 4 inches. So the fish is, at best, 55 inches from nose to wrist. In fact, it is probably less. Great fish, by any measure though."
523458,Guest,2003-01-02 13:00:00,0,"Nick, You wouldn't happen to be an engineer by any chance would you? I will have to take your word on measuring ones head. I tried to measure my own head but it's still hurts from News Years Eve.Ivy"
523440,Guest,2002-08-16 08:28:00,0,Got to agree with the Dragon - there is no way that fish is 5'8'' long. If the child in the front is even 12 inches across (which would be large for a 4 or 5 year old) the fish measures in under 60 inches. Still a huge 'jack'.
523441,Guest,2002-08-16 09:52:00,0,If you open the link from the original messgae you will read the newspaper article which states they used a fixed length objext in the background to confirm the length. To read the article requires Adobe (most of you have it) and you changing the zoom so it is big enough to read.Brett
523442,Guest,2002-08-16 12:34:00,0,Yeah it says they used a 2X4. Now if you stand 5 feet in front of a 2x4 the measurement will make the fish bigger than it is.
523443,Tom,2002-08-16 13:34:00,1063,Its a big fish thats all thats for sure
523444,Guest,2002-08-16 14:38:00,0,"Definitely a big fish but I doubt it was caught rod n' reel. The natives in northern Manitoba are humble but if it meant getting extra money for a legit. caught fish, he would be definitely advertising this as a rod n' reel hooked fish. Look at the fish tubs to the right side of the picture. Native commercial fishermen use these for hauling in their netted catch. But if someone can prove it, that's very freakin' cool. And like the other post stated, did the guy who was referencing the fish to the 2x4 take into account that the fish is at least a couple of feet closer to the camera? And take into account the true dimensions of a 2x4 (1.5"" x 3.5"")?When I used my Photoshop and referenced the 2 x 4 with these measurements, BUT didn't take into account that the fish is closer to the camera, I got the measurement of 59"". So the fish is at the most this long. Depending on the camera that took the picture you would have to know the Zoom setting and do some trigonometry of the distance from the 2x4 to get an even better estimate.And doesn't a camera add 10 lbs. anyway? Ha ha.This sure would've felt good at the end of 30lb test line regardless."
523445,Guest,2002-08-21 08:45:00,0,"i rarely post a reply or ask a question on these sites beacause of all the negative responses. why does it seem every time a person sends in a picture of a large northern,musky,walleye,buck, etc. that all the arm chair experts come out of the woodwork to dispove it. i'd find it really refreshing for once to see more positive input than negative."
523446,Guest,2002-08-21 09:00:00,0,"AFRO,We're not saying that it's not a huge fish. And if it were caught with rod and reel it's a real trophy. What we're saying is that it is not as big as the paper is claiming. I'm sure there are some 70inch Pike up there and if the Fishing Gods are willing, Maybe I'll catch one next week. But, all we're saying is this fish is not 70"" thats all. - DRAGONFISH"
523447,Guest,2002-08-21 09:52:00,0,"The thing that excites me after looking at that picture, doesn't matter 60 or 70 thats one FAT jack , he's been gulping down 5 pound walleye just for a snack. It just shows that there is a few more possible world or provincial records out there yet to be caught, hopefully by angling, so you never know what may be staring at your lure or bait, and that my friends is what fishing is about, among many other things."

I actually made it up to Cranberry again on a spur of the moment. We did really well . Our group managed to catch 23 Master angler Northerns and 1 master walleye. was a great trip again...thanks for your help and info.."

I haven't heard anything about it being a fake, but I suppose you could question the measurements since it is just a calculated estimate.As a sidenote, and you can contact the lodge owners and the C.O.'s in the area to confirm this(they saw it too) - a few weeks ago, a freshly cleaned walleye carcass was found at the local dump up there - it was intact minus the fillets, with no broken vertebrae...it measured 40 3/8"" (to all the skeptics - yes it was a walleye)....That's one big mother walleye, but it doesn't count for anything now!!!chrism"
523435,Guest,2002-08-15 18:02:00,0,"40 3/8 inch walleye, I bet the picture they took weighed an easy 7 or 8 pounds eh?"
523436,Northern Manitoban,2002-08-15 21:57:00,195,"The story was never proven to be a fake.There are fish this size and bigger that i'm sure are netted every year or so you and would be lucky to hear about it,to these natives it don't mean nothing its a way of life.Ever heard of the 100 pound laker netted years ago out of Athabasca yes its a true story.As for this big pike i don't see why it should be so hard to believe.Chrism tell me more what you know about this walleye i live in the Thompson area.Thanks.FISH ON."
523437,Guest,2002-08-16 07:56:00,0,"I'm not saying it's fake. What I'm saying that there is no way that thing is 70"". It's huge but not a 70 like I said maybe 55"". Look at the kids and his hands, unless the kids, who look to be under5 years old, are over 60"" tall theres no way it's that big. Any picts. of the over 40"" walleye?"
523438,chrism,2002-08-16 08:06:00,429,"I have no pics - I believe the CO's have a couple, and the lodge owner may have the carcass. I will take one of it the next time I am there!keep ya postedcm"
