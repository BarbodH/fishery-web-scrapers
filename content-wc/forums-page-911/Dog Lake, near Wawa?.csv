526013,Ohio fisherman,2002-12-18 15:46:00,989,"Hi Guys. Sincere thanks to everyone who has suggested places to go in Ontario. I am interested in Dog Lake which I understand is about 2 hours out of Wawa. There are a few lodges on the lake. What is the word on the fishing? How are the numbers? How about size? What is the word on the remote ""portage in"" lakes? If you have ever visited that lake where did you stay and what was your experience? Thanks, Ohio fisherman"
526014,lenray,2002-12-18 19:17:00,467,I have fished this lake and other lakes in the area it is a beautiful area with the game perserve being there also have caught some nice fish in some lakes out in the bush. Dog Lake is a large lake and I think the ones who know it and fish it know where to fish.As you are in Ohio that distance would be somewhat up North--I am in cen. michigan and for me going another 500-700 from Wawa is where I find some VERY excellent fishing. Just my opinion.

I would not call it fantastic but I've caught some nice fish (Walley and Northern). It also has some non-native Smallies but they're few and far between. There are some surrounding lakes as well. A few in the ""back"" are portage-in. And you can drive to a few more nice lakes (we take a little aluminum boat for those lakes). Ernie's son can take you to a couple of remote lakes that are just great. His fee is reasonable, too. I live in Northern Indiana so it's a good long drive (about 12 - 13 hrs). All-in-all, it's a good trip for us--nice scenery, good people, etc. But with the new restrictions in Ontario, last year was not the greatest. Contact me if you'd like further info. Trout"

526016,Guest,2002-12-24 10:43:00,0,"you mentioned new restrictions in ontario.....would you care to mention them?looking ahead ,it just might be cost prohibitive to spend all that money for a legal limit,or no fish at all.catch and release is okayexcept that for the cost per pound sure sky rockets :-)estimate 4 people is $2,500.00 to $6,000.00 and i don't get to bring fish home....i can go to erie!!!!and hire free byrd and stay 1st class and keep fish and fill tackle boxes and have beer money,and keep fish..i'm sure one or more of our northern friends will tell me to stay the h*** home...and that's part of it also....example;folks in USA don't tell them to stay away or fly pirate flags...i guess i'm just tired of fishing types not relly being fishing types..i always thought fishin' types took care of each other as in THE GOLDEN RULE.LOL, maybe i'm just trying to stir the pot also and having a little fun."
526017,Guest,2002-12-27 06:11:00,0,"There were new restrictions put into place last year. We did not find out about them until we got there. It's a slot limit. I can't remember exactly but it seems like it was 17"" to 20"" or something like that. You can keep three fish (I believe) under the slot and one over. Similar deal with Northern but I can't recall the specifics. They're just trying to preserve the fisheries, which I support. It was just the surprise that bothered us last year. Hey the way i look at it... we eat Walley every day and still have a few to bring back home. By the time you keep a couple Trout, some Pike and a few Wallies, it's a pretty good take. Any way, Erie is great, too. But there's nothing like Canada for a fantastic getaway. For what it's worth, Trout"
