It is striking how similar the accomodations have been in each place we've gone to....it would seem that the state of the accomodations are dictated by the Provinces.... is this true? As well, do the individual lodge owners lease their territories from the Government? It's hard to believe otherwise, how could a small seasonal business afford to own that much land and water? If these people do lease their territories, how does the system work? Does the province publish a list and solicit bids on lakes and parcels of land? Thanks for any feed back!"

526045,Guest,2002-12-23 19:36:00,0,"I own a lodge that is on a lake 14,000 acres. I have title to the grounds 5.4 acres, surrounded by Crown Land. There are many other occupancy agreements depending upon the past. My lodge was started in 1949 and the ground was issued a title with a legal description just like here in the US. I have 2 Land Use Permits (permits isssued by the MNR for use of Crown Land) One for my parking lot and one for a guide cabin that was built on Crown Land a few feet past my boundaries. I pay an annual rental fee for those permits. Some lodges are totally on LUP's and some are long term leases. I am in Ontario so can't comment on other provinces but the purchase of Crown Land is pretty much like trying to buy National Park Land (not available for sale). I don't own the lake and have no controls of who can fish there etc....but as remote as I am (boat-in) we hardly ever see anyone except our guests and occassionally a Canadian resident from town will come out for a day of Lake Trout fishing."

526047,Guest,2002-12-23 23:39:00,0,Most Ontario fly in operations and or lodges that have outpost camps are secured thru the MNR via a LUP (LAND USE PERMIT) which containsconditional clauses as to size of camp/use etc. Some operatore have long term leases and other may own the lands outright
