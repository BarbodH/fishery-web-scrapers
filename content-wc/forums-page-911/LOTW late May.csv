Yellow Girl has some nice shallow soft bottom areas that are good when the water's still trying to warm up. If you get a good wind blowing in there from the west, go all the way back to the east end and cast husky jerks in 2-6 feet of water. Dragging a 1/16 ounce jig with a leech also works good in that shallow water. We had a fantastic day in there casting Ratl-Traps in 4 feet of water. The walleyes, smallies, and northerns were all in the same area. Key in on shorelines that have a nice gradual taper to them, and also look for round rocks, rather than the sharp broken granite. Good luck!"
