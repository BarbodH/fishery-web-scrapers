They were talking about perch fishing on the flats a couple miles out. I was woundering if there was anybody that could verify this. I was debating going out there in the near future."
526182,walleyedude,2002-12-31 16:10:00,34,"It's been absolutly HOT!!! We have been out there twice this year and caught 200 perch each time,averaging 10"".Also a few bonus walleye and burbot to boot.We have been fishing about 2 miles out from St Laurent."
526183,gofish,2003-01-02 09:05:00,24,"I also read the article and was pleased to see Lake Manitoba make it on the list. Is the fishing that good? Yes....it can be if you happen to hit it right. Massive schools of perch roam the southern basin following schools of shiner minnows. The trick is to keep moving until you find a major bite happening. Recent snow has reduced access around the lake somewhat, unless you have a 4x4 or snowmobile. I was there with my boys before Christmas and did alright. However, I think they stretched the story about ""Perch up to 13 inches."". This body of water has not historically been known as a jumbo perch factory. A 12 inch perch would be very, very respectable for this portion of the lake. Good numbers, yes.....Real jumbos, no."
526184,Stevie B,2003-01-02 09:11:00,157,"Thanks for the info!What has been working for you, small jigs and live minnows? Most perch that I have been going for on the local lakes are too finicky to take a whole minnow and we have been chopping them up. I have a 4x4, what are ice conditions? How are the pressure ridges?ThanksKeep on Fishin'"
526185,gofish,2003-01-02 09:16:00,24,"No need to worry about live minnows. Salted, frozen shiners which are sold locally will do just fine. Bring an assortment of small jigs in various colours & a couple of flash lures, just in case. Half a minnow on the jig works perfectly. I have found that these perch are not all that finicky. If you find 'em, you'll catch some. It's really that simple."
526186,walleyedude,2003-01-02 11:44:00,34,"We have'nt even been using minnows,just a small Berkley Power Wiggler on a small jighead or small jigging spoon.You are right on about the size;most of the ones we have been catching were 9 or 10 inches,with a few making 11,but nothing bigger.We have found that by following the pressure cracks we shortened the time it took to find them.This we learned on Don Lamont's show,apparently the cracks attract the shiners which in turn attracts the perch."
