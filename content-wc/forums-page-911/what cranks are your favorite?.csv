525041,Backwater Eddy,2002-11-05 05:40:00,3871,"I have caught a bunch of sumo walleye on 6-8"" minnow bait style cranks. In high-pressured lakes at night big cranks can be the best deal going. Long line trolling over weed beds at night has been a very good choice on those lakes that are full of pesky water toys all day long in the summer.Big minnow baits after dark in the fall have produced my biggest walleyes to date. Many muskie fishermen get big walleye when chucking even bigger plugs then that at night.Walleye have been proven to attempt to eat forage up to 40% of their own size, they are not always shy about eating big.

525042,Guest,2002-11-05 08:29:00,0,"Interesting....I have caught a ton of Walleye on Shad Raps. Normally trolling #5/7/9s. Ocational if one spot produces 2-3 I will stop and cast with some success. Usually if I fish a soft bottom bay for walleye I can catch more faster on jigs. Last year early I caught a couple of 25""s in a soft bottom bay not deeper than 5 feet.Very interesting. I carry some big floaters for down-rigger/Lakers so I will tie one on for next year. By the way. The comment on pissing off the 'mate' because of net duty. I bring my son for the same purposes. Or so he says...Bob"

525045,nubbinbuck,2002-11-14 13:09:00,101,"For the 3 years I have been going to Canada, the lure that has produced the most fish (both eyes and lakers) has been the Smithwick Suspending Rouge. Either Clown, Black/Silver or Blue/Silver. The people I have fished with have tried numerous other cranks and stickbaits, and this one ALWAYS outfishes it.Also, I got my largest walleye this year (27.25"", be kind) on a Black/Silver Rouge."

525049,stratman,2002-12-30 06:13:00,16,"Considering most species of fish the two crankbaits that I have the most confidence in would be a #7 shad rap in shad color, and a 4"" cisco kid in about any color."

525039,Guest,2002-11-04 23:26:00,0,Ok....I have to hear this story. It sounds like you guys are saying you killed the Walleyes on a 7' altered floating Rapala. I have got to hear this. I have had success working weed lines with small shad raps but never anything but Northerns on big Floating Raps.Bob
525040,Guest,2002-11-05 04:21:00,0,"The story goes like this. My wife and I were fishing Red Pine Bay in Minnitaki Lake,Ontario. She was using a jighead tipped with a minnow. I knew the bay had big pike in it so I rigged up with a steel leader and a Rapala #18. Never caught that first pike, too busy catching Walleye. Most were in the 4# to 5# range. Caught one that was 6.3#. My wife was getting p.o.ed cause she didn't have time to fish because she was netting fish for me. And they say walleye are finiky fish, ha!"
525024,Backwater Eddy,2002-10-21 21:04:00,3871,"Good choice. Cotton Cordell makes some more good stuff, like the #7 & #8 Wally Minnow. Some very cool color options in the new line. I also like the shallow Smithwick Suspending Rouges. For me the Bomber Long A's are also a staple for walleye spring and fall. I have become a big fan of the Salmo line of lures. The Bullhead is a great river walleye crank bait, as is the Salmo Sting.Backwater Eddy...><sUMo>Backwater Guiding""Ed on the RED"""

Just didn't wobble the same anywmore. It was a sad day. Learned this year that if you have a big wind you can do well drift -trolling the things.
