524935,Guest,2002-12-25 15:55:00,0,"Have been going to NW Ontario for the last 15 years I started with 4 guys and it has worked up to 16 guys this year (2002). Fished Perrault, Wabuskang, Cedar, Cliff, Aerobus, LOTW and this year Lac Seul. Best fishing ever was at Lac Seul (end of June). Biggest Walleye was 27"", Northern 37"", but lots of each. Stayed at Mahkwa Lodge (housekeeping). Rate cabins 6, clean but rugged. Rate service ?, all we needed from them was cabin and some bait. Rate fishing 9+, if 10 there would not be room improve. As for the cabins they were clean and dry. If you want carpet, TV, DVD, micro, go elseware. We go to fish & see the wilderness not lay around the cabin drinking, playing cards, watching movies, etc. We can do that at home, don't have to drive 900 miles for that! We knew before-hand that there was just mattresses, no bedding and also no toliet paper. That could have been a BIG surprise. You don't want to leave food (candy, peanuts, etc.) in boat overnite as the camp dogs will have it for a snack! We liked it so well there will be 18 guys going this year! This trip cost us less than $500.00 per man total."

524937,Babamel,2002-12-26 12:16:00,0,"Went to Canada twice last year. I have been going for 15 yrs to a camp near Dryden. The main lake was really tough to fish this year, however we trailered our boats about 15 miles and could limit out on walleye in a little over an hour.By now the people who run the camp are like family, and it wouldn't seem right to not go up each year. I go North for vacation -- time in the open, away from phones, away from crowds, and while I'm up there I spend my time fishing. It's just great."
524938,Guest,2002-12-26 16:24:00,0,did a fly in out of armstrong-outpost camp-no red carpet but totally comfortable-probably 25 miles of lake system with only the 8 of us there-fishing outstanding or better-would rate at least 10 -all around quality outdoor experience-have some openings for 2003 -first 2 weeks of june-interested contact [email protected]-=thanks
524939,daveaz,2002-12-27 11:31:00,16,"Bigfoot,Can you tell me more about this trip, How can it rate ""at least"" a 10isnt 10 the highest rating possable? What kind/size fish did yopu catch? accomadations? sounds interestingthanks"
524940,Guest,2002-12-30 12:26:00,0,"My party of 5 have fished out of the Fisheries Resort the last two years. The cabins (house keeping only) are very nice/clean. Fireplace, AC, Cable (if you really want to). This Resort is on the East Arm of Rainy. Last July (as year before), fishing great. Caught many smallies (up to 5 lbs), many large Walleye (up to 29""), but not as many Northerns (as year before). Largest pike 41 and 45"".Pathfinder"
524941,Guest,2002-12-31 11:20:00,0,"Fished Lac Seul the first week of June. Stayed at Anderson's Lodge and used the guide service. Accomodations, Food and Service rated a 10. Fishing...first 2 days a 6, last 3 days a 10. Problem with first couple days was that we did not locate any significant numbers of fish. Last three days we used bigger boats and went about 25 miles from camp. Caught 100's of walleye and several northerns. Biggest walleye was 28.5"" (released for another day). Biggest northern was 39"". All in all, a great trip. Our party has already booked for 2003 and can hardly wait to return. Can't say enough good things about Anderson's Lodge other than book early!"
524925,Guest,2002-12-02 21:10:00,0,Thanks for the heads up on the BAD LODGE. We have never got stuck ...but we ask for guests names that have been there the same week for the last three years...that way we get our choice of referalls not the Lodges...it works ....
524926,Guest,2002-12-02 22:08:00,0,"kevin, you might wanna reserve judgement on the ""bad lodge"" until you read the lodge owner's post under the thread ""CAMP NARROWS LODGE ON RAINY LAKE"""
524927,Guest,2002-12-03 07:28:00,0,"Whit.....Sorry I was not judging the Lodge. I was over zealous in assuming the guest was correct. I read the Owners report and it sounds to me as if both partys could have been more accomadating. You are right ...I should not have used the term ""Bad Lodge""....I apologize to you and the Lodge Owner."
524928,Guest,2002-12-03 15:05:00,0,"The last week in Sep was my first trip to Ontario. We did a flyin to Big Canon Lake Lodge north of Vermilion Bay with full American Plan. I caught 9 muskies in 5 hours on a portage lake, all 34-38"". Caught tons of pike anywhere from 12-40"". The smallmouth and walleye were smaller than I had hoped for. The lake trout were down deep, but we caught many in the 3-6# range. the boats, motors and food were great.I was nice to be able to fish for at least five species and fish big lake, small lake and river systems.Bill"
524932,roscoe,2002-12-03 18:34:00,38,"My wife and I fished Border Lake which is a fly-in outpost camp belonging to Northern Lights Lodge out of Lynn Lake, Manitoba. This was our 2nd year there and I would rate it a 9 out of 10. There is only one outpost camp on this lake and the cabin was excellent and they had just painted the inside the week before we got there( 2nd week in July). The first walleye that my wife caught the first day was a 28 1/2 incher(Manitoba Master Angler) and throughout the week she never did catch any less than 22 inches. That was left for me. We also caught lake trout 6 to 8 lbs and northern pike. Most of our fishing was for walleye and we had a excellent week doing so. We had a bear in camp 3 of the 7 nites we were there.They had forest fires there earlier in the spring on the N side of the lake which we feel caused the bears to be moving around. The bears were not a bother. The lake is about 6-7 miles long and about 1 mile at the widest. Boats, motors and equipment were in excellent shape. Cabin and buildings were on a sandy beach out of any wind. They also have a shower and sauna situated in one of the buildings. Propane hot water heater. Cabin has propane stove and lights. There are also 2 portage lakes off of Border that have boats and motors. The Frank family who run Northern Lights Lodge are great people and very accommodating. I highly reccommend them and we are going again. To add to our trip this year, we flew Calm Air from Lynn Lake to Winnepeg and as we were taking off from Thompson, just as the pilot started to lift off, he jambed it back unto the runway and all the alarms were going off. The sensors in the luggage compartment detected a fire (heat) and we were forced to evacuate on the runway. Run to the side of the runway while the firetrucks came. Opened the luggage compartment and no fire. After 3 hours, not sure what it was and we were again on our way. We had a great week of weather and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. John."
524933,Guest,2002-12-23 12:51:00,0,"Mahkwa Lodge on Lac Suel the last week in July. Overall rating is a 7 because of the condition of the cottages (bad) but the fishing was great. Hundreds of Walleye and 3 Northern between 15-20 lbs; 2 being caught on surface lures. Its a great lake.Hope to return next year but to a different resort.Merry Xmas,Dave"
524929,daveaz,2002-12-23 16:11:00,16,"Hello Bill,Anything else you can tell me about this lake? I went to their web site and it looks nice? Reasonable rates also.I am trying to plan a trip for 6-03Thanks DavePhx, AZ"
524930,ackermannsacre,2002-12-23 17:14:00,196,"Dave,It was my first trip to Canada, so I don't know what to gauge it on, but I was very pleased. The owners Bill & Steve work very hard to make it a very pleasant experience. They are up well before the fisherman getting everything ready for the day. Each pair of fisherman will have 2 Lund boats with 25 hp 4-stroke Yamahas assigned to them. One on the lake at the lodge and one on the river. If you wish to fish the river they take you and your gear there by truck and trailer, about 1/2 mile and pick you up in the evening. We caught most of our walleye and northerns in the river, the walleye were mostly pretty small. We caught smallmouth and lakers in the main lake. It is a long 4 part portage to get to the best musky lake (No Name) but really worth it. You have to portage a outboard and gas with you, I believe they have had trouble with natives stealing the outboards on some of their portage lakes. I think my final bill came to about $1250US including beer and minnows. They have beer and minnows and licenses at the lodge. We didn't use any of the guides but they run about $120 a day I think.Bill"
524931,daveaz,2002-12-23 19:07:00,16,"Thanks for the info Bill, It sounds like the right place .Dave"
524934,Guest,2002-12-23 19:11:00,0,"Went to Quetico again with 3 other loonies in early June. Hit the record rainfall, starting on the way in. The last portage into Cirrus was turned into a mini-Colorado River in a matter of hours. We didn't fish much, and then only caught 4 fish the rest of the week. Was a cold, windy bugger with really nice whitecaps! Two other buddies on another part of Cirrus got unceremoniously dumped into the foaming swells, and darn near died of hypothermia. No joke. On the way out, the last portage into Unamed Lake near Atikokan was totally washed out. What a treat for bad knees. We holed up at the Atikokan Hotel, and were treated very nicely - I recommend the place to anyone. They were great. Yes, we'll be back. You Canadians are so blessed to have a place like the Quetico. Please guard it well. We'll help."
524915,Guest,2002-10-15 11:22:00,0,"All,I have noticed this board being very stagnet the last two weeks so I thought I would ask same question that asked this time last year. For those of you who went to Canada how was it? Where did you go? How was the fishing? How was the lodge? Did you drive in or fly in? Please rate your trip based on this criteria from 1 to 10 with 10 being the best. Share any intersting stories. Hopefully by doing this we can help others with trip selection in 2003 and it makes for good reading. Take care.Tyler"
524916,DaveIN,2002-10-15 12:01:00,191,"First of all, let me mention that I have done several fly-ins and was very satisfied but have since changed to driving to a remote campground.I am doing this because with buying a new pickup, camper and boat, I could not justify to the wife that I leave them at home and fly-in.Having said this, wife and I drove to Separation Rapids Campground near Kenora on the English River and spent the last week of August there.Very remote for a drive-in campgrounds. That particular week, only 4 campsites were occupied and so you pretty much have the lake and river to your self.Late in the season like that gets rid of most of the bug problem and that is nice. Weather was almost perfect, fishing was very very good.Wife caught the biggest walleye, 7 lbs. and I bent a prop, only drawbacks to the entire vacation.I would rate it an 8 out of 10."

524918,Guest,2002-10-20 17:18:00,0,"We stayed at Eversons lodge on Kabinakagami Lake the second week of september, We had a great trip. The weather was warmer than ive seen that time of year. Caught several pike in the 6-8 pound range and caught some very nice perch.The walleye bite was good as usual, hard not to catch them there. All in all a very good trip, all but the hassle getting in to canada at the border."
524919,Seanik,2002-10-21 07:02:00,218,"We went to Berthelot Lake in Quebec last August. Great food, good fishing and excellent facilities, but at 1000.00 Us with Van rental and an overnite a bit pricey. I am in the process of buying a small motorhome and will tow my old 16 ft Crestliner to new adventures in Ontario's Northwest. Being retired I plan on 2 or 3 week trips and the previous post about Separation Rapids Campground sure sounds good.I would appreciate any suggestions and advice."
524920,Ryan,2002-10-21 10:18:00,135,"We went to Longlegged Lake, near Ear Falls. We were there in late August. It is a pain to get to the lake. It is about a hour and half drive down a dirt road once north far enough. Fishing was good. The numbers of walleye aren't what we would see at lac seul, but the size was nice. The largest walleye was 27 inches, with 3 29's caught in camp. We had a great trip because the Lake trout were very prevalent and easy to catch. We caught several nice fish in the 8 pound range, which is a lot of fun. The lake is cold and clear so they seemed to survive just fine upon release. Beautiful camp too. 8 out of 10 for us."
524921,stumcfar,2002-11-30 08:52:00,451,"Went to Lac Seaul the first week of July. We stayed at Goosebay Camp. I have done a lot of fishing, but have never had fishing as terrific as what we experienced. We travelled to McKenzie Bay and found a couple of spots that our host had not marked on our map. Not a lot of big fish, but you could put anything in the water and catch 18"" to 22"" walleys. We will definately be back next year."
524922,Guest,2002-11-30 09:57:00,0,"Had a nice family trip to LOTW this August. No big eyes, and SM bass for me was kind of slow, but the numbers on eyes were incredible. Stayed at Red Indian Lodge. Lots of things for kids to do, beach, bikes, mini-golf, game room, etc. Staff was friendly and accomodations/food decent. My wife enjoyed not having to cook all week. Will go back if funds permit next year."
