526003,Guest,2002-12-18 11:37:00,0,"This lake is a maze! This early they may be in the bays so you will be way back in the boonies. I would recommend a GPS, a good map and a guide the first day. Mark waypoints on your gps when you are out with the guide where you find fish. Oh yeah, mark one where your camp is too!I think weather is the biggest unknown this time of year. We were there last year at this time and had 3 good days and 3 bad. Caught my biggest walleye to date too.Wish I was going with you..."
525995,kingfish,2002-12-18 15:09:00,36,I have stayed at Whitewing Resort and a couple of the other resorts in Ear Falls area and Whitewing is the nicest resort I have visited. So be good to your girlfreid and take her to Whitewing. I usually fish last part of May to first part of June. We fish flooded stumps this time of year. Ive seen 10s and one 12.5 lbs Walleye takin from this spot. The 12.5lb was released. Goodluck in finding what your looking for.

526004,fishguy,2002-12-20 19:57:00,94,Where are you from? you could cut that list in haldf simply by fishing at night.Something is fishy around here.
526005,the badger,2003-01-01 13:46:00,0,My only question is where does someone only 26 years old get to spend that much time fishing?
526006,daveaz,2003-01-01 18:02:00,16,I figure hes 66 and shes 26 and in that case who cares about the damm fish.
526007,Guest,2003-01-03 09:01:00,0,You can try Goldpines at Ear Falls. If their cabins are full they have ample camping facilities for you.
525991,BJ,2002-12-17 11:37:00,29,"This winter I came to the decsion that I would catch my first walleye over ten lbs. and I believe my scheduled fishing agenda will increase my chances. I will begin my season with a trip to the rainy river in late march. Followed by pilgramage to ""Mecca"" Lake Erie in april. Mille Laces ""my stomping grounds"" whenever I not testing new waters. THe gunflint over memorial weekend and finally the Fishery I know little about Lac Seul.I will be Traveling to Lac Seul by automobile with a 18' Lund Fisherman June 11-15 tenative.First, is this a good time of year to catch walleyes compared to july and august.Second where are some good resorts to stay at keep in mind i'm bringing my girlfriend. we are both 26 yrs.old and can handle pretty much any accomadations. all we need is gas a roof over our head. however, it would be nice if she had running water.THird, I would like to fish some flooded timber. i tried it on devils lake last spring and had a blast but i don't know if the fish are in the timber that time of year or what part of the lake has flooded timber.Fourth, what part of the lake is most productive in mid june. should i hire a guide or can a first timer have 75 fish days.Thanks for any help in my quest and good luck in yours.BJ"
525992,Guest,2002-12-17 13:57:00,0,"BJThree of us first timers went to Lac Seul last year during that same time in June. We fished out of Goose Bay Resort and had a great trip.We caught around 100 fish a day without much trouble. Mostly nice walleyes from 15"" to 26"". We also spent some time chasing pike and had a blast with them also. Goose Bay was a nice place with clean cabins and a great place to clean fish. Nothing fancy but it sounds like it would be what you are looking for. I have also heard good things about Evergreen Lodge but I have not been there.If the lake is high finding flooded timber is easy to find along most shorelines. Our resort owner was great about telling us where to fish.Bringing your girlfriend? Sounds better than sharing a cabin with the two guys I go up there with."
525993,BJ,2002-12-17 14:54:00,29,do they have a website for goose bay resort
525996,2 DOGS,2002-12-17 14:58:00,361,"Forgot to login, so forgive me but I'm not a lodge owner. If it's the northwest end of Lac Seul you're interested in, you've already heard of Evergreen and Goose Bay, there are several others in that vicinity that may be able to help you. Golden Eagle, Gold Pines, Golden Fawn, Timberlane, and a few others farther away from Ear Falls. Most if not all of these have websites but you may have a tough time getting reservations for that time of year if you wait to long. That seems to be a very popular time."
525997,stratman,2002-12-17 16:33:00,16,"There will be a full moon on the 14th of june, have fun"
525994,Guest,2002-12-17 19:27:00,0,"Try this site>> http://www.lacseul.com/June is probally out unless there is a cancellation or you plan to camp. Further down the lake there is Whitewing resort, Lac Suel Lodge, Fisherman's cove, Timberlane resort and a few other's that slip my mind.Really don't think it matters when you go to LS for eye's. The patterns change with the water temp and forage. Have done May, June, July and Sept. Mid June and early Sept are my prefered times. Usually the temps are decent and Sept is not as crowded (an added bonus).Guide??> Depends on how well you can navigate new waters and locate fish. It's a BIG lake with MANY underwater hazards with minimal amount of navigational markers. There are about 10 spots on that end of the lake that most locals and returning fishermen frequent that produce GOOD numbers of eyes."
525998,Guest,2002-12-17 19:31:00,0,If you see a Pirate Flag Flying on a Boat STAY AWAY FROM IT!!!
525999,Boots,2002-12-17 19:44:00,19,Hey LOCAL is that you Bill? Remember me? I was the one who was going to hire a guide but cancelled the guide cause you said you were a locol and knew all the hot spots? Will be looking for the pirate flag.
526000,Guest,2002-12-17 19:53:00,0,LOL BOOTS............. How did you know my name?? I never mentioned it here did I ?Too Funny!Hey..... let me know when your coming up..... we need to have a brew together :)
526001,Boots,2002-12-17 22:17:00,19,Oh now you want a brew with me? Last time you said if I got close you would bring out the cannon. You the same Bill? We will be staying at Gold Pines last week of July. Just joking about hiring a guide. Been to Canada many times but never hired a guide. This will be our first time to Lac Seul. Will have a group of about 10 or 12. Would be glad to have a brew with you so long as you leave your cannon home.
