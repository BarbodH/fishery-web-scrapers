526197,Guest,2003-01-02 11:13:00,0,"Just thought I should mention this for anyone considering fishing Lake of the Woods this summer, especially Shoal Lake.As many know Shoal Lake has been closed for walleye fishing for many many years.The Ministry of Natural Resources rules and regulations when it comes to this body of water are very straight forward. It is illegal - period - to fish for Walleye in Shoal Lake even if you ""ARE Catch and Release."" You cannot intentionally fish for this species period...You are asking for a fine, the loss of your equipment (including boat,motor,and vehicle.) Not to mention a Criminal Record which now would probably mean no more coming into Canada.Any resort, lodge, camp, guide service that allows you to fish this body of water is asking you to break the law.What I would really like to see happen with Shoal Lake, Shoal Lake Narrows, and anything below the Rapids (Ash Rapids) to make it Barbless. No barbs on anything especially those large magnum plugs.I know there are super size northern and musky down their and I know people using these ruddy plugs and really harming the fish due to lack of knowledge removing the hooks.Thank you for your time.Ron"
