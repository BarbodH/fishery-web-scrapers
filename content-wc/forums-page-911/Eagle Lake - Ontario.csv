I was up there 5 or 6 years ago, and I am planning to take my dad again this year. Here are a few questions...1) Where on the lake did you have your best fishing? 2) How did you fish?3) Live bait or lures?4) Where did you stay? We will be at Cedar Point Lodge.I appreciate any responses."

This year the fish ran bigger than in past cause of the late ice out(I guess).The walleye's were lot of fun and the lake trout fishing was great, only thing was that cause of the late ice out the perch(JUMBO) fishing was some what slower than in past years. Last few years we would fill up in a couple of hours this year AM perch were slow but after lunch as the sun warmed the water the perch fishing picked up, the reason I tell you about this is that the perch are JUMBO in size.Walleye fishing is best using spinner rigs and jigs tippped with minnows. Lake trout fishing we use spoons and hot n tots, blue and silver work best. Some of the Lake trout are large up to 12 lbs easy but most being the eater size 2-3 lbs.Like i said the walleye fishing was better this year May with many large only down fall to going this early you never know on the weather one day we were getting sun burn and the next day we were fishing in snow suits in near BLIZZARD conditions with the snow coming down side ways.If i can help you more feel free to e-mail at [email protected]and i will try to help out as much as possible.I have been fishing Eagle Lake for 20 years now and have caught many nice muskies there also in the summer, to me this is one of the best lakes around.Happy HolidaysKurt"
