526246,Seanik,2003-01-05 09:58:00,218,"We fished at Berthelot Lake Lodge the third week of August of last year. The cabins, boats & motors are excellent. We opted for the meals and at 680.00 Can. for everything for the week its a great value. The food was absolutely 5 star,you will gain many pounds if you are not careful. We had a 16 Lund which handled the water great. The fishing at that time of year was steady and the lodge puts you on the right spots. Our largest pike was a 39 incher with some 32's and 36's mixed in. The walleye action was steady but the fish are on the small side, 12-14 inches was common our biggest was 19 inches.The 70 mile drive on gravel road to the lodge can be an adventure, there are many dips,curves and hills but few potholes since they grade quite often.We only fished about 25% of the available water, there are 4 rivers emptying into Berthelot, the Whitegoose and Mesacaine Rivers produced well for us.I am in the process of buying a small motorhome to hook up with my 16 Crestliner and am planning a month long trip to western Ontario. I will also book a week late June,early July at Berthelot.Seanik"
526247,jale6666,2003-01-05 17:27:00,14,thanks for the info. do you have any other experiences on any lakes or lodges in this area?
526248,Seanik,2003-01-05 19:39:00,218,"Berthelot Lake is the only Place we fished in this area in recent years. The gravel road out of Senneterre is called Plantation Rd and there are about 4 or 5 other lodges off of it. I think the fishing would be similar at these other lodges since stained water and river systems seems to be the norm. The only disappointment at Berthelot was the small size of the walleyes although they were numerous and easy to catch. As a bonus, Berthelot has sturgeon and we saw many come to the surface but no hook ups. If you go to Berthelot I would suggest a guide for at least one day. The price was reasonable, (100.00 Can. + his gas)up to 3 adults and you go in the guides 19 ft Lund with 50hp Honda."
