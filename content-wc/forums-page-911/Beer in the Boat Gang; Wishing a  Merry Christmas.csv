I have learned a lot this year by reading the threads on W.C.. There is a vast amount of information and knowledge that the people on the web site have. And at times there is a vast amount of fun and bravado. And at times there are disagreements. But one thing we all have in common is the enjoyment and desire to fish. So, if your Christmas wish is for a new rod and reel or just the time to go fishing with the people you care the most about, here is the hope that your Christmas wishes come true.Peace & Joy,Ivy""It's a monster Dad. Get the net. And by the way, Thanks for getting me fishing!...... Er and hurry with that net, she a beauty,..eh! """
