526178,Guest,2002-12-30 18:16:00,0,"""Question""What type of punishment would you impose on those who you caught vandalizing your ice house?When I arrived at my ice house today, it quickly became apparent that some low-life(s), had broken into the structure. who ever was responsible for this senseless act, never removed anything from the shelter. So obviously theft wasn't the motive. They did cause considereable damage to the door post, as well they broke the padlock. I put some thought and considseration into the design and construction of this shelter. The material alone cost close to $1000.00. Then there's the labor, which I supplied!I only wish that I could catch someone in the act, while committing this type of vandalism. After he wakes up, he would then be left with the task of having to solve how to remove my boot, which I left deeply imbedded up his sorry #####!Sadly, ice shelter vandalism is quite common up here, what's it like in your region(s)?Fish Hard Forever!"

Can you say cut bait? ;)I know guys in high risk areas will not leave anything in their shack, they also leave them unlocked to limit break in damage.I wouldn't be so quick to blame it all on kids, often when caught, they are adults. Thieves are thieves and vandals are idiots, they all suck. If possible leave as little as passable in a shack and leave the windows clear so they can see this. Nothing to steal in sight limits their willingness to waist their time.As sportsman we need to look out for the other guy too. Suspicious activity should be noted and reported. The guys who do this crap are NOT the usual sportsman, so they tend to stick out."
