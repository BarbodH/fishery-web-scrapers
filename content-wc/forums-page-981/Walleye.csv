516702,Guest,2002-01-28 20:20:00,0,"Where are you located????? If you are in Minnesota, Mill Lacs and any of the lakes around Vermillion are good. If you are in Wisconsin, Lake Winnebago is one of the finest fisheries around during May and June but gets tough in July and August."

516705,Guest,2002-01-29 11:59:00,0,"As you are in Red Lake, I would try Lac Seul or Lake of the Woods. Both are fine fisheries (LOW has made a comeback during the late 90's ... it had been overfished by commecial netters for a long time but the fishing is great now). Get a navigational map of whichever one you will fish or you will lose a lower unit easily (I have seen it happen twice on Lake of the Woods). I have fished both lakes and done well. A locator is a necessity, of course.If you are interested in saving money, I would look into camping on these lakes. I know people who fish and camp on LOW and they save a bundle by doing it. Personally, as my wife is my fishing partner and she does not care to cook (nor eat MY cooking) after a long day on the water, we stay at a fishing camp. Witch Bay Camp on LOW is our choice ... done it every year since 1993. Good folks!!!!!!!"

Everything is taken care of from the bait in your boat to your meala and maid service daily you really feal like you are at a first class resort. The Lodge is on Pipestone lake and it's great because it's a 28 mile boat ride to the lake and you don't have the fishing presure like you would have on Lake of the Woods. The landing is also on ly 45 min from International Falls MN. Oh ya the fishing is second to none. If you get a guide ask for Percy or Morgan. Have a great trip were ever you go!"
516707,Guest,2002-01-29 16:33:00,0,I have relatives that fish Gullrock and catch TONS of nice walleyes. They say the fish average much larger there than other places they have fished.
