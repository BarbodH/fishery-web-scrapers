The best way to find out about a lake or maybe even the camp you are going to is to search the web for their fishing report as well as checking out message boards on Walleye Central. If you were going to Lake of the Woods for example. Search Lake of the Woods fishing reports. Bookmark the ones you find and start reading them. If they go back to last year, so much the better. You will find how the folks did, what they used, what they caught during your time frame, a whole bunch of good stuff. Try it."
