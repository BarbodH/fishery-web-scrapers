I've seen many talk about favorite baits and lures, but we cannot take a boat full of lures. What are 'must have' walleye lures and baits? What would you not leave home without?Thanks"
517209,Reels,2002-02-14 20:24:00,2876,"If I could only fish with one bait, it would be a jig. But I know several people who fish for walleyes just fine with a splitshot and a small hook. The best guides I have ever hired, have a takle box on quarter the size of one of mine... it always makes me wonder why I carry so much stuff!Very simple, but it will catch fish in any condition.<{{}}><"
517210,JN,2002-02-14 21:22:00,47,"Jigs are a must, I get tired of jigging thou and always end up trolling. I've had my best luck with a yellow with red spot lazy ike. A close second would be a thunder stick, and the a hot and tot. It depends when your going as to the depth of lure you want I always go early june when there still in under 15 ft. Just my .02"
517212,SWeed,2002-02-14 22:41:00,66,"Jigs & twisters if I could only have one bait. You mentioned family trip, If you have youngsters it may be easier to backtroll spinner rigs. Little joes use a barrel sinker 1/8 - 1/4 and snap (not Snap swivel) then attach little joe or similar spinner rig. Good luck and enjoy... Sweed"
517211,BD,2002-02-15 04:08:00,739,"When the eyes can be found shallow I like to troll also. Lazy Ikes and T-sticks are good but I prefer L&S Mirrolures and River Runts. Trolling Mepps spinners with a crawler on behind is great for smallmouth. With the kids though I would go with slip bobber rigs and jigs besides backtrolling spinners. In June the best fishing I've had on LOTW was long-lining the shallow structure. Later on when the fish are deep you can't beat a jig with live bait unless the eyes are suspended, then trolling spinners behind an in-line sinker can really put you into some nice fish.What to take minimum;2 or 3 shallow (0 to 8 ft.) running plugs such as the floating River Runts or size OOM Mirrolures;2 or 3 medium/deep (10 to 20 ft.) running plugs such as the various T-sticks etc;2 or 3 Mepps Elix spinners or equiv.;A Daredevil (copper) or two just for fun;6 spinner / live bait rigs;Some bottom bouncers, in-line sinkers and a few Lindy sinkers;Slip bobbers and split shot and maybe a hook or 2;A good selection of jigs both lead head and floating;A good sense of humor and a lot of patience are also a must! Have fun!"
517214,RANGER,2002-02-15 05:03:00,4341,"My first choice is my harnesses; second is diffenitely jigs and tails; and, third, my cranks.The choice of the harnesses is due to the abilitiy to troll them, drift them or dead-stick 'em and are my GO TO bait whenever the situation calls for it from ""high pressure"" dead bite to a feeding frenzy."
517216,Guest,2002-02-15 06:17:00,0,"Let's not forget the lowly hook and splitshot, or simple lindy rigging. Meat is still deadly."
517215,chrism,2002-02-15 06:34:00,429,"I'm with Ranger's choice, however I would throw in a couple of big spoons and some big monster plugs for the Northerns (don't forget the wire leaders!)."
517213,DarrenB,2002-02-15 07:37:00,28,"I second the spinner rig. Particularly those with chartreuse blades, as it has outfished every other color in our times out. Drop it over the side with the proper amount of weight and a minnow and you are all set."
517217,Tim P.,2002-02-15 16:27:00,8,"Spinner for a buck or less wins hands down. Mostly troll, but have been known to pitch 'em. Live bait mostly, but plastics work if the fish are hungry."
