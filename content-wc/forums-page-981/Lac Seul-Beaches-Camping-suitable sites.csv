517095,Guest,2002-02-13 15:01:00,0,"I hope you bring outriggers. There is some big water between Ear Falls and Hudson. Expect stiff winds just about everyday and waves in the 2 - 3 foot class. On a regular basis you can expect 4 footers once you get past MacKenzie Bay and start running down the lake. Sounds like a nice trip, but you will be challenged to make that type of mileage in 9 - 10 days on Lac Suel. Camping spots are all over the place. So are the fish. TGG"
517096,Guest,2002-02-13 15:18:00,0,One other note. In late May and early June Lac Suel can blow up with hurricane type wind. Over the years we have had to spend many days beached because of bad weather. Be careful. TGG
517097,Guest,2002-02-13 17:12:00,0,"There is a public launching area about 15 miles south of Ear Falls that you might try and head for ""Bay of Islands"" that way if you encounter some stiff winds you can find an island to hide behind rather easily and you'll be much closer to Manitoba point mentioned in the previous post."
517098,Guest,2002-02-14 07:31:00,0,"The Great Guide & 2DOGS,Thanks for the insight. I knew Seul could blow up something serious, but it sounds like it's ""normally"" rather windy and choppy. Indeed, I'm now officially frightened. Seriously! That's the problem with solo canoeing; one shouldn't take foolish chances when one's all alone. 2DOGS, which Lodge turnoff/road marker is closest to the landing you spoke of, 15 miles south of Ear Falls? I've never noticed a Public Launch sign before on the way up to EF. Perhaps I'll paddle in from this landing and just fish for a week in that area, rather than have ""not-much-fun"" paddlin' to Hudson. Of course one could ingress in the Hudson area (more sheltered, I'd assume), but would run into problems camping NW of there, I guess (Indian Reserve lands)?Thanks for the help,Joe"
517099,Guest,2002-02-14 11:50:00,0,The public launching area would be just past Fisherman's Cove Resort on the right about 100 yards as you head north towards Ear Falls. I'd suggest you have a good map of the lake. Good fishin!
517100,Guest,2002-02-14 18:02:00,0,"I don't know the west end like I do the east end, but you could cut down through grassy lake area where it's more protected on your way to Hudson and save a fair amount of miles to your trip. Just a thought"
517101,Guest,2002-02-16 11:41:00,0,"JABS and others,Is it permissible to camp on/travel through Indian Reserve 28, which encompasses Grassy Lake, Grassy Bay, etc, to and from Hudson.And can anyone comment on whether the current at Manitou Rapids (North of Sioux Lookout) is a significant hazard/problem for canoeists? Perhaps it's just a long run of swifter water?Are there many suitable camping spots in the waters north of Hudson? Is the fishing as good here?Thanks,Joe"
517102,Guest,2002-02-16 19:15:00,0,"Wind....Darn near blows all the time on LS. Early morning and late evening the wind is usually fairly calm. Of all the years on LS, I can only think a a handfull-maybe two-that were what I would consider canoe days. Seen some BIG BIG chop on that pond! Last two trips got caught in 5'-6' rollers in Steamboat bay. Shoot can't even think what Mckenzie Bay-Manatoba Pt areas would of been like!Sands Island is about 5-6 miles from the Dam. Close to light house to the north of Steamboat narrows."
517085,Guest,2002-02-10 19:49:00,0,"Hello All,Can anyone indicate to me the location of any beaches/sites suitable for camping in the centre and western sections of Lac Seul. I guess water level may affect viability of some sand stretches; for those with a LOT of experience of the lake, how variable IS the water level, anyway?Thanks,Joe[email protected]"
517086,lundboy wi,2002-02-10 19:58:00,3,camping on la seul is not allowed unless your at a resort that has camping.
517087,Guest,2002-02-10 20:18:00,0,"Camping on Lac Seul is permitted if you are Canadian. If you are not a resident of Canada, camping is not allowed on Lac Seul."
517092,Guest,2002-02-10 20:52:00,0,"I guess I should have made clear that I'm Canadian, and have camped many times on Crown Land on solo canoe trips over the years. Joe (from Winnipeg)kinda clear from my e-mail addresss, though ... :)"
517088,eyewitness,2002-02-10 21:33:00,680,"Been goin' to Lac Seul for a while now and know folks who have business' there. Am about 99.99% positive that camping is NOT allowed on this lake unless it is at a resort that is licensed by the MNR, regardless if you're Canadian or not."
517089,Guest,2002-02-11 09:27:00,0,"Hey Eyewitness.On the off chance that you're wrong (an infinitesimal .01% chance, I know :) ), can you point out some likely spots you've noticed on your travels? I've canoed in the Manitou system, and plan to do the same in Lake St. Joseph, which both have similar non-resident camping restrictions; indeed, they're more restrictive than the usual rules. As for Lac Seul, it's part of an MNR canoe route; without an overnight (or more) that's a heck of a day paddle!Thanks,Joe"
517090,eyewitness,2002-02-11 09:57:00,680,"Resident or non resident, some areas like Lac are off limits to camping. If they weren't I'd be up there half the summer. Best thing to do is call a couple of resorts out of Hudson,On. and ask if they would know any resorts that allow you to camp on their land. I think you're gonna have a tough time of it though. Good luck"
517091,Guest,2002-02-11 10:09:00,0,"Sorry Eyewitness, you are wrong. Camping is allowed by Canadians on Lake Seul. I have witnessed this many times and have talked with the people who have their tents up at their campsites. MNR patrols the area regularly and nothing is said to them. I've seen this many times over the years in the middle and other parts of Lac Seul. The latest was last summer. If they happen to be camping illegally, where do you get your source of information from?"
517093,Guest,2002-02-12 18:40:00,0,"You will find many beaches providing the water isn't as high as it was last year. Last year darn near all the beaches were gone. Still, if one was camping there are many great sites to pitch a tent. One of the best streaches of beach is on the north/west side of Matatoba Point. Probally 1/4 mile! Also see many people camping on the south side of Sands Island. Ghost Narrows would be another decent area. Don't think you will have to really worry about a good camping spot.Water fluctuations > lake is big enough that major changes aren't a worry. Wind is another story!"
517094,Guest,2002-02-12 20:39:00,0,"Thanks, FlyinOnH20, for the info. Like you say, water levels are always the big variable, but boy, that's a lot of water (+/-) necessary to influence a lake the size of Seul. As for the wind, I know it's a huge lake, but is it a problem most of the time, or just when the wind is up significantly? Some lakes blow up bigtime all the time (orientation, depth, etc), and some have better resistance (elevation/depression, treeline). In the centre-west sections of the lake, the ortho (satellite) images show a LOT of small islets that appear to have decent sand strips/spits, but the trick is getting that far into the lake, if the wind/chop/swell is bad. I'm considering an 8-9 day solo paddle from Ear Falls to Hudson in late May/early June to recce some sites for a two or three week boat trip in August. I'd almost prefer to see a bunch of the lake at slow ""canoe speed"" before ""zorching"" around in a big Deep V, X-15 or not! How's that for justification for a canoe trip?Where's Sand's Island?Anyone else with any tips??Thanks,Joe"
