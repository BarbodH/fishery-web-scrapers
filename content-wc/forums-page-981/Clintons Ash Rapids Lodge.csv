517284,Big Laker,2002-02-18 11:50:00,53,"Two years ago our group went there. First the bad news...The rental boat and motor was a piece of junk. It had a leak, the bilge pump didnt work, and the livewell leaked into the boat and the motor didn't run very good. Both of the boats we rented had problems and they didn't offer replacements (my guess is all boats were in the same bad shape) The guides we hired were no more than boat drivers. They didn't provide anything, they didn't tell us what bait or presentation to use, didn't really seem to know of any good spots to try and they had no electronics on their boats. Bottom line, we didn't really find the fish until we lost the guides. they simply sat in the back, cussed a lot, drove the boat and then crashed into a rock. The cabins were ok, except our septic system had a leak and it ran down the side of the hill so you had to walk through crap each day to get down to the dock.Now the good news...The fishing was great, hot spots for walleye, pike, smallmouth and muskie all within a short boat ride.The main lodge building and restaurant is beautiful and has great food. People drive from over an hour away to eat at the lodge. I would definitely recommend the area, but I don't think there are any other resorts in the area. So if you go there, make sure you discuss these things with them before they become problems....email me if you want any more information...."
