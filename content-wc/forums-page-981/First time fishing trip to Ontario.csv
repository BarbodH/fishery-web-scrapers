Anyone have experience there or have suggestions for our first trip?Should we use a fly-in outpost for first trip or would we be better off fishing a drive-in destination? We are a fishing family, but have no experience in Canada.Thanks :)"

516552,Pooch,2002-01-24 07:49:00,4619,"This is an open ended question. Have you fished for Walleye, Northern Pike, etc. before? If not, really brush up on fishing in Canada. My first trip was just short of a disaster. I filled in for another guy on a few days notice and went really unprepared for fishing up north. All but froze to death. Ran out of anything that would catch fish. Worms died within days. Didn't have any idea on how to fish those waters. Oh brother! Fly-in trips will usually be better fishing but not always. Drive-ins are nice because if someone gets hurt or wants/needs to leave early you can. More people at the drive-in camps. That's good and bad. Our group makes a couple trips a year and have lost track of how many trips over the border now. Like many others on this board, we have really got it down to a system. We now have a letter that is about three or four pages long that we give to anyone who is joining us for the first time. It helps them avoid what happened to us on our first trip. I guess my answer would be try the fly-in if you are pretty much self reliant and have some outdoor experience. But, if you are unsure, and with your family (especially if they are young) I might lean towards a drive-in camp. Both the fly-in and drive-in camps have good and not so good camps. My wife goes with me every year to a fly-in camp and we have noticed that over the years more wives are joining thier husbands in these more remote trips. If you really like each others company then a fly-in together is really a great way to get caught up on each others lives. Do your home work and listen to the fellows on this board. These guys are pretty straight up. All camp owners pump up thier place so keep an open mind and seperate the wheat from the chaff when listening to them. If you would like a copy of our letter for first timers email me. It is in Word format. Good luck.Pooch in central Illinois[email protected]"
516553,sdyer,2002-01-24 08:30:00,34,"Pooch makes some great points. Not all fly ins are outposts style where you are left on your own. The place i go to has a small lodge with a dinning room where your meals can be made for you or you can cook in the cabins as they have full kitchens. They also have a satellite phone for emergencies and a float plane in camp at all times. Most fly ins like the one i go to have special rates for families and i have seen families there often. But most importanly for me the fishing is spectacular for trophy pike, walleye, and lake trout. Check out the full american plan fly ins. It's like being at a drive in lodge with better fishing. Good luck.Duffy"
516554,Guest,2002-01-24 15:28:00,0,First-timerTake note of Pooch's and sdyer comments - very sound advise. I fished Hilltop about 15 years ago thru Ignace Airways. They had an excellent cabin on a huge sandy beach - it was very nice. Fishing was good. The main walleye concentration was large reef - hump about a mile out from that beach. Largest fish was about 4 lbs. There were also some very good weed beds for the pike. Directly behind the cabin was a small portage lake they called Two lake. One buddy took a 17lb pike and another took about a 5 lb eye. It was a decent trip for numbers. The outfitter is topnotch.

516556,rainy,2002-02-17 23:05:00,21,want to try a private cottage on rainy lake guides are available and fishing is great you can check out several flyins that are minn from cottage thanks rainy
516557,Guest,2002-02-18 10:12:00,0,"Hiltop is a good lake. I fished it with ""Rusty Myers Flying Service"". They did build one of their new super outpost's, in place of the other.I think the lake has become catch and release for the most part. There is good potentially for big fish there. Our largest fish was about 9 1/2 lbs.I wouldn't hesitate to go back.Jeff"
