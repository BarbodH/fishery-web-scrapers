Give them a call and see if you can bring your own boat. It's a long trip up (28 miles) but I am sure they would be more than happy to give you a boat to follow and help you up with your stuff or directions."

515929,Guest,2002-01-27 12:19:00,0,"Hi Paul,I have fished Lac Seul in late July. I have fished LOW in June, July, and August. I think both lakes would be fine during August. I prefer mid-to-late July myself because it is the earliest that the humps are both predictable and active and my wife and I like to fish that kind of structure. However, August is fine too ... it is just that we have found the weather to be less stable and therefore the fishing less predictable. If you do fish in late August and have some cooler weather, you will find that the fish move to deeper shelves and behave more like autumn bites than typical summer bites. The thing is, this move may be permanent or not ... which is why my feeling is that the bite can be less predictable.Good luck in whatever you choose!!!"

515924,DanL,2002-01-07 23:41:00,262,"We have gone up to Lake Minnitaki the last 4 years. We travel up there the 2nd. week of August and the walleye fishing has been very good for numbers and we catch quite a few fish from 22"" - 27"". They have a slot on Minnitaki. Every walleye between 18 - 21 inches must be released and you can keep one over 21 inches. Everything you keep must be killed as soon as you decide to keep it. You are not allowed any live fish in the boat. Minnitaki is located about 20 minutes before you get to Sioux Lookout."

515925,Guest,2002-01-11 19:23:00,0,"Fish in August is my favorite time, I have guided in NW ontario for 8 years around Kenora, If you want big Walleye's go to Pipestone Lake they are big it's the only place I have fished that produces a consistent anount of big walleyes on a regular basis and Auguest is the best, fish are in there patterns and stable. The lake is 40min from International Falls MN. and very remote. The place that looks the best up there and what people seem to recomend is Happy Landing Lodge check it out at www.happylandingfishing.com have a great trip."

515921,Jim,2002-01-16 11:11:00,238,"I have a trip planned for Lake St. Joes for Aug 3-8. This will be my 4th time there. You can't beat the fishing for consistently catching fish. Try asking a resort owner when the best time to fish on his lake is and he will say spring or fall. Ask people on St. Joes and they will say ""anytime"". I have found this to be the case. The lake will not turn off during the summer or after a cold front/storm like some do. All my previous trips have been in July and have not regretted any of them. This past July, all my fishing was done in 2-8 feet of water. I actually saw walleyes hit my jig. The best part is you don't need live bait. Jigs and twisters is all you need to bring. Have a great time."

515917,Guest,2002-01-04 11:35:00,0,"Planning a trip in August. Wondering what part of August is best (early or late)?. Our picks so far are Gullrock, Lac Suel, Bluffy or Lake of the Woods (we're bringing our own rig). Mostly interested in walleye fishing. A decent number of sizable fish would be nice (3 to 5 lbs or better), rather than hundreds of 13 to 17"" fish. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated."

515918,Guest,2002-01-04 14:57:00,0,"Taking your own rig pretty well leaves out Bluffy. Depending where you're coming from Gullrock would probably be the farthest, but allows you access to several other good walleye lakes as well. Lac Seul is a tremendous fishery but grows big rocks, so if you decide to go there get a good map and use caution. All of the lakes you mention are good for walleye and would produce throughout August. My preference would be early part. LOW has a wider variety of fish. Good fishin!!"

515920,The_Great_Guide,2002-01-04 22:31:00,24,"I generally schedule a trip to somewhere in Ontario during the last two weeks of August. Weather conditions are still stable and usually warm and the fish are still stuck to summer structure. I would recommed the east end of Lac Suel. I've been to Chamberlin Narrows several times with great success. Ojibway Outfitters in Souix Lookout runs a boat-in camp there. We have also had good success on Deception Bay, but there is a lot of traffic moving around. I've also fished the western basin in August out of Ear Falls. We gennerally had to run 15 to 20 miles for the best fishing either into Steamboat or McKenzie Bays. GPS for McKenzie is a good idea until you get to know your way around. There are several resorts in Ear Falls. I've stayed at Goose, Golden Fawn and Evergreen. I would recommed any of them. I've also been to LOW in early August and mid-September out of Nestor Falls and Morson. Morson seemed to have the best access to prime walleye fishing. I've stayed at Crawford's, & C&C Motel in Nestor. In Morson I've been to Red Wing, Buena Vista and Hidden Island. I'd stay at any of them except for C&C. This year we are going to go to Lake St. Joeseph. It comes highly recommed by many people who post on this site. TGG"

Good numbers of eaters and very respectable size with 3-5# and an odd 8-9# just for good measure. I would go (and will be) the middle of Aug. out of Souix Narrows. LOL Doc"
