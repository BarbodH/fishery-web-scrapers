You know move some brush and stones and set up a tent and aren't afraid to put some or many scratches on the truck to get you back into a staging area where you can take a river lake system then go overland etc. This is the way we fish no fly-in no lodge no nothing except what we carry in on our backs.We caught pike over 40 inches last summer-released -and eyes to eat. We don't bring fish out as why carry extra weight and after eating fresh fish in the bush we aren't hungary for any frozen ones back here in the states also we get into trout lakes where fishing them is like shooting fish in a barrel.For you guys who don't like this and have your own personal taste that is fine and good--wouldn't want all of you on these very private waters anyway.

I prefer to fish out of a 14ft with a 9.9 on our small lakes. I have done the canoe thing and as I get older find it not as comfortable as when I was a wet behind the ears youngster. We carry larger tents now and army cots. This is a great way to ""rough it"". We catch Walleye to 10lbs pretty much every year and Pike over 20lbs. We camp at the same lakes and it is not crowded. We are seeing fewer and fewer people camping like this. Most have elaborate motor homes and will not stray off the beaten path."

The longest portages we've done are from a quarter to one half mile, but they are usually less than 100 yards from the logging roads. We've caught a lot of northern (biggest 42"") and walleye (biggest 28"") in these smaller lakes.We use both electric (for the short portages because the batteries are so heavy) and small gas motors (long portages). We have found some great lakes doing this, and its nice knowing that we will have a lake all to ourselves for a day. We also have found that about two-thirds of the new lakes we try don't produce much of anything. So be prepared to waste an afternoon. In the area we fish, there is also usually a reasonable trail down to any good walleye lake, and the strictly pike lates are much less disturbed. On a long weekend, our general rule is to fish a couple of lakes we know that are good and explore one or two new ones.On our best lake, we have even left a 12' boat along the shore. Gone several years after and its still there (I notice that the Canadiens do this too)."

517202,Guest,2002-02-18 06:00:00,0,"Len, good guess on the TC origin. I agree that finding a way to the lake is almost as much fun as fishing it. We've had a couple that we're like searching for the holy grail. Thank god for topo maps, GPS and friendly locals, including the MNR."
