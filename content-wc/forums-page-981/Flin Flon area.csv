517166,PWaldow123,2002-02-12 19:43:00,198,"Eyesore,I used to fish up there for years. There's a nice campground on Jan Lake. This lake is located about 45 minutes North and slightly west. Fabulous walleye and pike fishing. If you would like more info, or decide to go e-mail me and I can help you out. [email protected]"
517167,Peanut,2002-02-13 09:57:00,929,"There is also a lake nearby called Amisk or Beaver Lake (it's not that I don't know, it's called both). Very nice lake, great walleye and pike fishing. I don't know what there is for a campground, but as stated, Northern Manitoban should be able to help.derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"
517168,VMS,2002-02-14 09:45:00,1103,"Years ago, I was at the campground at Simonhouse. Very nice place at the time. Nice fish cleaning and there were nice northerns as well. Nice thing is you could quickly load up and head anywhere. We went to Isquasum (spelling?) and Locke lake and had a blast with walleyes and northerns there as well. Put in at Grassy Narrows Park....I think.You could also head North east of Cranberry portage and head into Kississing lake campground (just out of sheridan). the park has a tar road, but getting there can be a bit rough. The road is rough and definitely tough on boat trailers. Two years ago, our crew had an axle bolt break. 6 hours later, they finally made it in.Steve"

517171,Guest,2002-02-16 09:52:00,0,Cormorant Lake is 110 miles south of Flin Flon.or 50 miles north of The Pas. You might also want to consider Clearwater Lake for Large Lake Trout. It is between The Pas and Cormorant Lake
