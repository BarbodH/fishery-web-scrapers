515748,Guest,2002-02-13 20:43:00,0,"Hi Dave;Been going to Wabaskang for 14 yrs, this one will make 15. Have not stayed at KF. We always stay at www.tallpinescamp.com and it's only a stone's throw from you. Get your license at Dutchies, 1/2 miles from you. When do you plan to be there? I missed getting back to ""FRED"" earlier, would like to answer any questions you have too.Sincerely, Paul"
515749,Dave,2002-02-14 09:05:00,258,Will be there first week of July. How has the fishing been the past fifteen years?
515750,Guest,2002-02-14 11:44:00,0,"Any info that you can give me on the walleye fishing would be appreciated. Bait, etc Trolling, bouncing jigs, minnows, crawlers? I was also told that there is great jumbo perch fishing too. ????"
515751,Guest,2002-02-14 14:36:00,0,For 14 years it has been very good! Expect the same this year. My favorite approach is light jig and minnow. Nothing fancy with this but I do use 1/16 oz. jig w/1/0 hook and 6lb. Fireline. (black and yellow). I like to fish the bottom of the outside edge of most weed lines and drop offs from say 6' to 15'. Don't pass up the reed lines in the evenings. Happy to help any time.Paulemail [email protected]web page www.geocities.com/wrightkeenls
515752,Fred_G,2002-02-15 13:23:00,908,"Hi Paul! I'm going to Tall Pine the first week of July. Pete tells me this will be about the time of the annual may fly hatch. Any suggestions? I've always thought moving deeper would be best. Am I correct? Any hazard areas that I should avoid? I know I'm probably missing some things, just can't think right now. Thanks!Fred"
515753,Guest,2002-02-15 17:23:00,0,"Hi Fred;Sorry I misssed your post earlier in the year. You may have to go a little deeper in July, it depends on weather and rain fall. If it stays cool in the evenings and water temp doesn't go up to high, you should still catch fish in 15' or so. If you want to call me, you can get my phone number from the web sight listed above. I'd be happy to help anyone if I can.SincerelyPaul Wright"
515737,Dave,2001-12-19 12:27:00,258,Anyone ever been to Wabaskang Lake or stay at Kingfisher lodge?If so any Information about the lake and the fishing there would be appreciated.
515738,Guest,2001-12-22 19:34:00,0,"We have been to Wabaskang for the past 14 years. It is a very nice lake. Lots of fish and wildlife. We have always stayed at www.tallpinescamp.com. Check out the web sight, it includes a lake map. Give Pete a call and he will answer any question you might have."
515740,Guest,2001-12-24 07:48:00,0,Fished it many times several years ago. Heard last year was very good. Suggest you take a drive a few more miles north and east of Ear Falls to South Bay Lodge on Confederation Lake for big Pike and Lakers. Walleye fishing there is very good but since they fish small lakes surrounding Confederation Lake they catch and release most walleye (but big ones). Good Luck!
515741,Matt D,2002-01-04 14:44:00,262,"Never fished Wabaskang, but we did used to boat through down to Wine (same river system). Got frustrated with the spotty fishing and decided to try something new so guess where we went ... that's right, South Bay Lodge on Confederation. The lake is big (14,000 acres) and so are the pike! We went for the trout; not huge (avg ~28"") but they're getting bigger and there's lots of 'em. PIKER summed up the walleye fishing for the most part -- there's none to speak of in Confederation, but the lodge has exclusive rights to five adjoining lakes which can produce some lunkers. Liked it so much the first year we went back the next (normally we only go every 3-4). We just booked for another trip last week! Last but certainly not least, Roger and Kay are GREAT hosts. Heck, Roger bailed me out with a jumpstart in the Bass Pro parking lot (they're from Springfield, MO) on his way to taking Kay out for their anniversary dinner! They don't come much nicer.Their website: www.southbaylodge.com(It's about another hour's drive from Wabaskang)"
515739,Fred_G,2002-01-06 18:32:00,908,"PKW,My wife and I just booked a trip to Tall Pines for the first week of July. What can you tell me about the lake? What's the best presentation? Feel free to e-mail me if you like. Thanks!Fred"
515742,Guest,2002-02-10 14:27:00,0,"We have booked the third week in aug at the Kingfisher. Any info that you would care to share would be appreciated. Such as. Bait used, the fishing sucess etc. Even though their boat etc comes with the package, I'm hauling my own rig. I would also like to know where to get a better map than they provide. Thanks for the help."
515744,Guest,2002-02-10 16:04:00,0,"I own a cottage on the SE shore of Wabaskang Lake. We've fished the Lakes in that area for 25 years, so 2 years ago a we found our retirement home. The lake is great, 5 resorts are on the lake. They wouldn't be there if the fishing was bad. Walleye, pike, trout, whitefish, smallmouth bass, and perch, it's all part of the Cedar River watershed. The narrows west of Tallpines is just one of the hotspots. You can follow the river flow to the north all the way toGowlly Bay for Walleye or go West to Mc Leod bay for the deep water and the trout. Keystone Lake to the sw has great walleye too or just catch smallies around the numerous islands. For muskies you need to go into Perrault Lake, which feeds Wabaskang. It doesn't get better than that. If you rough it a little there are many small lakes on the timber roads that are lucky to get a couple of limits pulled out every year."
515743,Scott,2002-02-10 20:01:00,385,"Rollie,I will be going to Tall Pines Camp the second week of May. I sent an email to the owners about topographical maps of Wabaskang. I received a reply that Dutchies' Store, which is about a mile from Kingfisher and Tall Pines Camp has the topo maps of Wabaskang. Hope this helps you out."
515747,Dave,2002-02-11 09:30:00,258,Will be at the Kingfisher the first week of July--any info about the lake or phone numbers where to get a good map would be appreciated.Any return customers of the Kingfisher lodge out there?
515745,Guest,2002-02-13 15:29:00,0,"Thanks a lot Scott. We will be going up there the week of the 17 of Aug. Do you have any advice as to what to use for bait, and the walleye tricks? :) I was there once before but that was about 25 years ago. I was in a canoe with a little kicker motor so didn't stray too far."
