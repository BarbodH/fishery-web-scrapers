541588,bellbuoy,2004-07-11 20:01:00,490,I'm heading to Witch Bay late next month. I know that the buoy numbering sytem on LOTW has been changed in the past couple of years. Do I need to buy a new map or is there a website that has the new buoy numbers that I can copy on to my old maps? Bellbuoy

They're much nicer than the old paper version, and have the updates. I think Gail sells them right at Camp for $15, or you can just borrow mine and update your paper map. I'll be there from July 16-25."

Although we like to fish for a little bit of everything, we will be hitting the muskies pretty hard. At least we hope to be. I noticed on the Witch Bay board you indicated you are sharpening hooks. I was doing the same last night while watching the Cubs/Cards game. I'll look forward to talking muskies with you in a few days. Dave Brown"
