The weather was a bit cold early in the week, but things picked up later in the week. Some nice bass, and some decent walleyes. Nothing huge, 26' was the largest. We were fishing 3-12 for bass, and about 35-10ft for walleyes. Deep to shallow seemed to work the best for the 3-way spinner. For our first trip to Rainy, we were happy. I'm sure that we will go back. Good Luck! Go_Fish"
