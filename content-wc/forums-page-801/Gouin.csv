Saw a 12 # walleye this week Last night while checking 6 anglers one of them had a huge northern, 44 inches long but one of the widest body I ever saw at the Gouin, he caught it on a yellow jig with a worm and a 8# test line, took him half an hour to get it out. Yeah, you can fish near the Oasis, if you feel like going far, I might find time to give you a sightseeing tour of thew Gouin Have to go back up tomorrow, keep safe"
541442,Atlanta Dave,2004-07-06 07:00:00,323,Alces How should the bugs be in two weeks at the Oasis Du Gouin? Atlanta Dave
541450,McQ,2004-07-06 09:11:00,615,"Dave, I just returned from Lake Opemiska which is a 80 miles further north than your destination at the Gouin. The black flies were abundant and hungry - just before leaving for Chapais I received some of the White Mountain product and it WORKS. I've got a bottle reserved for you. I am terribly affected by black fly bites and have been searching for an effective product for years. Thought I had a solution with the Watkins product but this White Mountain stuff is the real deal. The black flies don't come near you. I got bit twice before I applied the repellent and immediately after there were no more. This is the first trip to the far north that I can truly say was bug free."
541471,Atlanta Dave,2004-07-06 14:52:00,323,"McQ Great I will get that stuff from you, dont like black flies myself at all. Tried skin so soft many years ago and they feasted on me. Did you get the pics I sent to you by email? Hopefully the flies didnt bother you in the boat with the wind. Looking forward to meeting you. Atlanta Dave"
541475,McQ,2004-07-06 15:58:00,615,"Yep, got the picture - geez you're as ugly as I am. I'll be the guy under the sign with your name on it, in the arrivals area. Have a safe trip and I'm looking forward to meeting you in person too."
541481,Atlanta Dave,2004-07-06 17:17:00,323,MQ Sorry about the ugly we all got to get old. I am hoping to match those pike at the Gouin. Tell me it is so. See Ya . Atlanta Dave
541483,VANT,2004-07-06 17:37:00,68,What's this White Mountain stuff and where does one get it? Thanks.
541489,McQ,2004-07-06 20:06:00,615,Check it out herehttp://www.whitemountaininsectrepellent.com/about.html There's also a thread running in the General Discussion Forum. This stuff is great.
541497,Alces,2004-07-07 05:14:00,35,"Not too bad, they are feasting right now but their activity will have slowed down in mid july, only the deer flies left....you know the kind that take a chunk of your arm and goes on a tree stump to chew on it!!!!. As of last week the fishing was very very good, some good size walleye and some nice northern are starting to show up in the little bays around the Oasis. By the sound of your conversation, you and McQ, are you guys dating??? I might not be as ugly as McQ, but I take more room sizewise. Have a good trip"
541511,Atlanta Dave,2004-07-07 14:18:00,323,Alces What are the sizes of the better Walleye you are seeing or hearing about? Lighten up on MQ and I we are only talking fishing. Thanks for the info. Atlanta Dave
541536,Atlanta Dave,2004-07-08 15:41:00,323,Alces Still looking for some size reports on the walleye and pike. Are you saying you dont have to go far from camp at the oasis to get into fish? That would be great I would rather fish than boat ride. I have a map marked up by MQ I hope he is a trust worthy source. Thanks in advance maybe see you in a week . Atlanta dave
