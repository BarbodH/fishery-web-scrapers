541601,Guest,2004-07-12 08:26:00,0,Someone told me you cannot bring nightcrawlers into Canada without proof they have been in worm bedding for 7 days. We have taken worms we catch for the last 12 years in bedding. The 2004 Ontario regulations make no mention of this. Anybody been up lately and know what is going on? Thanks!
541603,Guest,2004-07-12 09:00:00,0,"I am not to sure what the actual written reg. is, however, we have taken a few flats of crawlers into Canada, stored in worm bedding. We declared them at the border, and there were no issues. Just make sure you tell them they're in worm bedding, you'll be alright."

Canada's restrictions regarding importation of earthworms stems from its concern about potential diseases carried in soil, including the soil ingested by worms and still carried within them. Thus, the requirement for a 15 day cleansing period. The regulations can be read at the following web reference: http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/...4e.shtml#scope Import requirements are: 3.3 Shipments from the Continental U.S. 1. A Permit to Import under the Plant Protection Regulation is not required. 2. The shipment must be free of soil unless originating from a state not regulated for soil pests. Directive D-95-26 outlines the phytosanitary requirements for soil from the U.S. For shipments originating from areas in U.S. states where soil is prohibited from entry into Canada, the worms must be subjected to a cleansing period for at least 15 days before shipment to Canada. The cleansing period may be carried out by maintaining the worms in a soil-free and pathogen free substrate (e.g. shredded paper, pasteurized vegetables). 3. Shipment to Canada must take place in clean new containers filled with fresh artificial bedding. No government issued certificate is required. From the D-95-26 document: The importation of soil and related matter, alone or in association with plants, is prohibited from the golden nematode quarantine areas, from sudden oak death areas of California and Oregon (D-01-01) into all provinces and from the Columbia root-knot nematode quarantine areas of continental U.S. into all provinces. Importations of soil in bulk (without plants) from the U.S. is prohibited unless it is imported for the purpose of scientific research, education, processing, industrial or exhibition purposes. Appendix 1 provides the states and the specific counties within those states from which the importation of earthworms must go through the 15 day cleansing period. Appendix 1 is available at: http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/...26e.shtml#app1 Sorry about the bureaucratic aspect of this post but that's all I could get from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency."
