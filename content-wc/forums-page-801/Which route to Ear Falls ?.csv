541704,Guest,2004-07-14 20:33:00,0,"I am going to Ear Falls from Southern Michigan. I have previously travelled via the u.p. of Michigan, across Wisconsin and then up through Minnesota.According to the auto club it's two hours shorter crossing over to Canada at S.S.Marie and going around Lake Superior on the Canadian side through Thunder Bay. Besides the gas being more expensive in Canada, Is there any other reasons not to go this route ?"
