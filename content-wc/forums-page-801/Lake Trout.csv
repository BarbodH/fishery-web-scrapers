How deep do you think the fish will be this time of year? I figured that they would be deep, but heard the weather has been a little cold this spring. Where would you start? Any tips would be appreciated. Thanks in advance, Newby"

We were laker fishing 2 weeks ago and the lakers were holding about 60 feet in approx 100 feet of water. We were in Quebec and water temperatures were no doubt warmer. However, if sonar units are not an option, have each guy in your group fish different sections of the water column until the the depth of the lakers is ascertained."

541630,Andre M,2004-07-12 18:42:00,86,Went on Lake Champlain (NY) Saturday. Fish from 8.30 till 11.30. Caught 9 lakers between 6-12pds. in 105ft. water temp was 44deg. Yo-zurri 2 3/4in. mauve. were the most productive.
