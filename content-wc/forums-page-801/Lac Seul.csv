541621,Guest,2004-07-12 14:24:00,0,"Water is good level. When we were there two weeks ago the water was a liitle cool yet and the fish were scatterd. We hoped that they would have transistioned to main lake but they had not. By now they may have made it .We were fishing the Ear Falls area and still caught fish . Four of us caught 600 Walleyes and a 31 1/2"" and a 28""."
541622,Guest,2004-07-12 15:17:00,0,Ear falls area are up a couple of feet from normal or 6-8 feet from last season. Water temp last week was 62-63 in most spots. Large numbers of fish were holding on the rock reefs in shallow from 7 to 10 feet. Larger fish were found were weeds were starting to show. Good luck and have a great trip.
