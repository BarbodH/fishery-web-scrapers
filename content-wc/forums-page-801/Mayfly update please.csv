541626,Guest,2004-07-12 18:09:00,0,"excuse my ignorance. what does it mean to catch a ""limit"" of walleye?"
541628,Trailerguy,2004-07-12 18:21:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]In division 22a which Wabaskang is located the daily possesion ""limit"" on a ""sport"" lic. is 4 walleye with 1 that may be over 18.1"". Limits vary by Lake and division."
541629,Guest,2004-07-12 18:29:00,0,"so, i guess that means that fishing was really lousy as a result of the hatch and calm winds combined."
541631,Trailerguy,2004-07-12 19:42:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]No, the fishing was below normal, far from lousy. I can live with bad days if there are some good evenings. We usually went out after 4 pm and if there was a chop we'd catch our fish in 1-2 hours. Often the lake would lay flat again by 8:30 or so which makes it easy to get them in the fry pan. I usually don't like to fish all day every day anyway, there's always some chore to do around the cottage. :)"

541306,Mo Fisher,2004-07-02 14:54:00,21,"My group will be heading to Pakwash Lake near Ear Falls in two weeks and was wanting to get an update on the mayfly hatch. Has it occured yet, is it occurring now or is it still to come? I was there last year at the same time and the hatch had happened two / three weeks prior. Just wondering if it might be later this year due to the cool spring. We will be staying at Pakuni Lodge at the south end of the lake and would appreciate any reports - old or new. Thanks, Brad"

541494,Guest,2004-07-06 22:40:00,0,Can anyone answer the above post? I will be fishing the same area about the same time - so am also interested. Thanks deb
541501,MTJ,2004-07-07 08:05:00,106,I cannot speak for the Ear Falls area but I was on LOTW last weekend and there were Mayflys everywhere. It didn't seem to be as bas as years before. Could have been the weather.
541538,Guest,2004-07-08 15:58:00,0,IT'S A GOOD BET THAT IF THE MAYFLIES AIN'T FLYIN SOMETHING ELSE WILL BE. IT'S A VACATION DON'T WORRY ABOUT THINGS BEFORE YOU GET THERE. BRING LOTS OF BEER AND FISH BATTER EVERYTHING ELSE WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF. HAPPY FISHING AND VACATIONING.
541539,Guest,2004-07-08 16:02:00,0,"2 years ago, my son and i had a 100 walleye day on lac seul right in the middle of a hatch. don't worry; be happy."
541545,rpieske,2004-07-08 22:41:00,1276,The hatch is just about over here on LOTW if that helps. Less than in years past.
541598,Guest,2004-07-12 06:22:00,0,We were at Eagle lake this past week and the mayfly hatch was going on BIG TIME. Getting a walleye to bite was tough!
541608,Guest,2004-07-12 11:40:00,0,Just returned from Lac Seul on Saturday & the mayfly hatch was stong on tuesday & wednesday. Wednesday was a tough day to fish. Every walleye we caught were spitting up mayfly larvae.
541613,Guest,2004-07-12 12:14:00,0,"Not sure what stage the Hatch was in but I spent the past week on the North East side of LOTW and it was going really good. Mayflies were everywhere, in fact we caught several Smallmouths that were so engorged with them that there mouths were still full of them and they STILL wanted our lures. I do not believe it slowed the bite down a whole lot, since we still caught a ton of fish everyday (probably 50-100 fish day per person). And By the way... last year the Hatch happened about 3 weeks earlier then this year so the cooler water temps did slow the hatch. All in All though, fishing was VERY good and in fact better then last year!"
