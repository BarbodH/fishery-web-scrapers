541468,DaveIN,2004-07-06 14:01:00,191,We will be arriving at Separation Rapids Campground on July 18. What will be the status of Mayfly Hatch? I have always gone up the last week of August and have never been there in July. Also what about driving through Duluth on Highway 53 this year? Is the construction still going on?

Border was clear sailing into Canada but line into U.S. at 4 p.m. was about 1/2 mile, UGLY ! We got close to Seperation (Redditt area) and did well, have a good trip ! JJ"

Accomodations, boats, personal etc? Any information >is appreciated!! >Thanks I stay at Separation Rapids Campground, which is where you will park and the water taxi will take you to the lodge. That is 7 miles from the lodge. I usually fish the river right at the campgrounds in late August and do very well for big walleye. Our wedding annv. usually occurs while we are there and we eat at the lodge for supper that night. Food is very good. I have not been in any of the cabins, so I can't speak on them. Boats and equipment are first rate, Crestliners and Yamaha. Everyone that I have delt with have been very pleasant. I usually fish crawlers on bottom bouncer rigs in the current but notice the guides all seem to use minnows at the lodge. E-mail me if there is anything else you want to know. 4 more days and I head up there. DaveIN"
