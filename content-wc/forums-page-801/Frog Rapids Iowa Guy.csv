541578,Guest,2004-07-11 10:34:00,0,"Hello, The water got up to 65 degrees on the 7th of July. It didn't help the fishing much. The weather did warm up also. I quess you can get a slow trip once in a while. I,ve fished the area for 12 years and this was by far the worse fishing. I'm booked back next year. Sounded like you probably would not return next year because of the 4th of July?"
541579,Guest,2004-07-11 13:30:00,0,"Haven't seen any tournament results yet. I talked to a guy who was on the lake that day and he said the waves were big. ""This thing is over, get the net""."
541587,hawkeye,2004-07-11 18:56:00,112,"Three of us stayed at frog Rapids last week in June. when we arrived they said fishing was really off. It rained,wind blew, and never got much obove 63 degrees all week.But we found the Walleye fishing to be very good. 88 the first day, 380 in five days of fishing. Fellows next to us even better up in bear narrows. We fished Sen Bay one day and North of Deception Light rest of week. Most were caught jigging with lead heads with a chartuese Mr. twister, tipped with large minnows in 21 feet of water and aways following that depth on a shallow to deep drop off. Bass and northern were out deep. The temperature at the shore line was to cold yet for them. Never seen this condition in 24 years of Fishing there."
541633,Otts,2004-07-12 21:38:00,119,Thanks for the reply. We still had a good time our numbers were just down a little bit. We did not get back in for next year and will be staying at Tikinoken(sp). Good luck fishing. Otts
541634,Otts,2004-07-12 21:39:00,119,I heard a boat went down also. They were down rigging and a ball caught on the bottom and pulled the boat down on that side and then a wave hit it and it was all over. Did you hear anything about that? For those of you who read this I believe this happened on Lake of the Woods. Otts
541635,Otts,2004-07-12 21:43:00,119,"hawkeye, How was the fishing in Sen Bay? We went there in early June and did OK. Big fish but no real numbers. On the last trip we fished almost entirely north of the Deception Bay light. We head north past the three islands and then west for about a mile and then head into a big bay to fish. The bay was OK but the ""gap"" leading into it was the best. A friend's wife took home a 28 inch. She was sure happy. Good luck to you, Otts"
