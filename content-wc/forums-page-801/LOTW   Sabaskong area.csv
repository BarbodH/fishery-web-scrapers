541595,PJM,2004-07-11 23:07:00,3516,Scott791 The Lake has been running a little behind because of the cold spring. Insted of going to Miles bay go up by Boomstick & Rubber island or any of the reefs south of Painted rock. Check out this site up updateds on fishing from Buena Vista Resort www.livejournal.com/users/buenavista/

I've been picking up some walleyes while casting for muskies on small lures. Water levels have dropped slightly from their high this year and water temps yesterday were 74 degrees. It's another nice day today and temps probably will go up some more. Clarity is still good, with bloom just barely starting. Summer looks like it has finally arrived...or maybe this is really our spring finally arriving. Good luck."

541614,Guest,2004-07-12 12:27:00,0,"Hey DaveB We just came back from Witch bay and had another terrific time. Fishing was awesome for us. Walleyes were easy to catch... just find the weedlines and drops using 1/8oz jigs and 4 inch grubs worked REAL slow and also bolder areas using deep diver cranks that can get down enough to bang the bottom. When we were in camp we asked about the mid lake reef bite and was told it was slow so we tried for ourselves.... the Walleyes are a easy catch on the edges of the humps from 25-30 foot bottom bouncing with Crawlers. They are even deeper but really not a good idea bringing Walleyes up from any deeper then 30' if you plan to release them. Smallmouth were doing very good (caught more then last year) and the Northern Pike bite was better then I have ever seen it. I caught 6 Pike OVER 30"" in one day! I raised 3 Musky's while there... and I wasnt even fishing for them. That bite will get better from now till the end of sept. Also if you like Walleyes don't forget about the lake next door... our smallest there was a 21"". Leeches worked real good there. Man do I wish I was still there! UGH"
