561243,Guest,2006-09-18 01:36:00,0,"Have a great time in Toronto, I'll try an shop your boat around to a few regulars at the 529 and see if anybody's got an interest. Just finished a little guide service at Minaki and boy was Wisky Island ever hot for big fish. Had 3 novices in the boat and did they ever get some thrills. Big musky wouldn't leave one of the walleyes alone hit this 17 incher 3 times beside the boat before we could get it out of the water. Then he sat right beside the boat like a dam seagull waiting for us to throw the thing back. Funniest thing I ever saw. The client was from Australia and he couldn't believe what he just witnessed. lol Great walleye as well one over and two lost beside the boat great action. And thank You everybody for the info I'll have lots of shad's #8&9 all styles in the box for Pine Falls"
561157,Guest,2006-09-12 23:21:00,0,"I have a secret lure that I can't tell you about but honestly, I have #9 and #8's in about every color and use T'sticks as well not to mention reef runners and have success on different days on different colors and lures. Firetiger, blue/chrome and baby bass have been good producers. Just depends on the sky...ie, high sun, clouds etc... Overall, I would say speed and depth tend to be more important than color. Brighter colors do better than dark colors. Here we come!"

561160,Guest,2006-09-13 06:46:00,0,Don't go to traverse bay without a #9 clown.
561162,Guest,2006-09-13 09:32:00,0,Hi danny Fished with cranks up there lots.Caught fish over 13 .5 on cranks.Tourney fishin with cranks can be one day on one day off.#9 shads work very well.We can talk at the red river tourny.Are u going to the rules meetingsat night.
561165,Guest,2006-09-13 10:40:00,0,"really depends on my partner, if I'm at the meeting. If I fish with my 7 year old daughter then probably not if I fish with my wifes best friend then for sure she a wine rep and has some of the labels in town. Going out to minaki this weekend for some fun. Talked to Rob the other day he said your heading out early to Pine Falls I was thinking of taking that week off mabye we can hook up. For sure I'm out there on the Monday. Stop by 529 I'll buy you a beer mabye make some arrangements."
561166,Burr,2006-09-13 10:45:00,8612,"I've done best on #8 Shad Raps, #9's next, and #5 JSR's. Be prepared to fish the river on blow days. It doesn't take much of a wind from the north to make some considerable waves on the south end of lake winnipeg. Blue Chrome, Clown, and all the pearls. Although I'm not a big believer in color having a great deal to do with success. I'd be prepared with different vibration patterns more than color - but to each his own. Color is, to me, the least important part of the presentation puzzle. To me, some of the lures your considering run a little deep for the bay. The water generally is not that deep. I usually bounce mine off the clay bottom - there have been times I had to be bouncing off the bottom to get bit. Plan on fishing depths of 7-12 feet. All that being said - for years I made the trip exclusively for the cranking. I've had much better success since I started putting a jig on and dropping anchor. Don't get me wrong, I still do both - but I've salvaged days with jigs more than once. Buy some salty's. Good advice about pinching the barbs - I've been checked every year I've been there - don't slight that advise - just do it."
561180,Guest,2006-09-13 17:48:00,0,Is there a gps chip available that covers traverse bay?
561191,Guest,2006-09-14 08:25:00,0,No there is not a chip available
561055,lund115,2006-09-12 16:52:00,698,"Yea, we have 4 guys in the boat. So we have 4 lines out. If you have 3 guys, you can have the one in the middle with rattles and the 2 outside ones without. Speaking or regulations, make sure you pinch all of your barbs on your crankbaits. I believe the fine is $50 per barb that is not pinched. Do the math $50 x 6 barbs/crankbait= $300. Take the extra time to make sure each barb is completely flat."

561056,walley250,2006-09-12 17:42:00,161,Do you find it nessesary to be right on the bottom or will it work to be a little way off the bottom.

561057,Guest,2006-09-12 18:08:00,0,"I've had them work anywhere from 4' to 10' above the bottom, but that kinda depends on the aggresiveness of the gbacks. If I see them suspended near baitfish in deeper water, I try to run them thru the baitfish most of the time. chuck"

561040,Danny61,2006-09-12 10:50:00,42,I've been redaing alot about the bifferent cranbaits that the pros run in the bay. Everyone is talking about running Shadraps #7-#9 but not talking about the pattern they like to run. Saw a segment on in-fisherman with Larry Snow and he was running Firetigers. Myself I was thinking of running deep diving greyghost by reefrunner. Anyone have a favorite that they run out thery're? I'm sure gonna try alot of different colors and styles anyway. Ive never tried the deep diving tail dancers. Mabye they're tiger might work well.

561043,lund115,2006-09-12 11:05:00,698,"It seems like anything with Pearl works well. Firetiger is always a go to color, and seems to work well up there. Basically anything with color. I have read up on some articles about trolling up there, and have read about using some with rattles in them, and putting some sent on the lures. The article said that they would have 2 inside poles with rattles on it, and the outside ones with regular cranks. They always seemed to catch 75% of fish on the regular cranks compared to rattles, but when they switched to all with no rattles, the over all number of fish caught went down. So the fish may be drawn in by the noice, and then take the lure with no rattles. Might want to have one pole on the inside with rattles on it all the time....just a thought, something I will try this year. You may have one lure that draws fish in by its sound or color, and because of that, they will hit your other crankbaits."

Sometimes perch colored will be hotter, but the other two work better 8 days out of 10. I prefer #9 raps, but will switch to #7 or even #5, depending on the flat or schools of baitfish. Chuck"

561053,Guest,2006-09-12 16:26:00,0,"In Manitoba, in open water, you're allowed to fish with one rod per fisherman only. So unless you've got 4 in the boat, there will be no inside and outside rods. Shad raps in pearl or firetiger or chartreuse have worked best for me. Traverse Bay is shallow, a deep running crankbait will be in the mud."
