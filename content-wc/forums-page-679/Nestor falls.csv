561163,Guest,2006-09-13 10:11:00,0,Check with Phil Haggeburg at the Anglers bait shop and he should be able to let you know if the crappies have moved in yet. We have also had a pretty good smorgasboard at Green's on Sunday evenings. We stay in June at Canadian Haven in N/Falls. Good luck and let us know how it goes.
