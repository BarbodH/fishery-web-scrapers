560873,Fred_G,2006-09-05 15:55:00,908,I'm heading up to Wabby this weekend and wondered if anyone had any new reports. What's the smallie fishing like this time of year? Thanks!
560886,Trailerguy,2006-09-05 19:20:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I just got home from Wabby over the long weekend. There's been an algie bloom, probably due to the LOW water level, the weeds have turned ""sour"" so there didn't seem to be any Perch action. Walleyes were deep and suspended in the big lake, action also around the 2nd narrows just before dark. Beautyful blue bird weather, around 80* in afternoon and no wind, was hitting 48* at night, great sleeping weather. Caught some Big pike on rock piles and rocky shorelines. I didn't really look for smallies, but we caught a few anyway. We mostly fished evenings, it was so bright and clear with no wind. It was just great with few bugs for non-fishing activitys. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

The fishing for walleye was excellent, with the ususl places producing. Devils point, Doe island etc. The northern and perch fishing were good. Can't give you any specifics on those(don't know them). For walleye, minnows and jigs worked well. Where are you staying?"
