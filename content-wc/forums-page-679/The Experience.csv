Those are however guided camps, so the guest would have had to first argue with the guide, and would knowingly be going back to camp having broken the rules, so they would expect it. Having said that, it has never happened! For those who still haven't figured it out, the qualities of a good mount is that it looks good, lasts a long time, and is affordable. Todays replicas look better, last longer AND cost less. Take a picture, get a measurement, and carefully release that trophy fish, then get yourself a replica, and watch somebody else get the great thrill of catching that fish in the future (or one of the many thousands that big female could reproduce each year).

561033,Guest,2006-09-12 09:36:00,0,"Not to add fuel to this fire...but I have read and heard numerous biologist state that once the ""brood"" fish hits a certain age (length/weight), the productivity and quality of its eggs degrade to the point where it is no longer providing ""value"" to the gene pool. Myself, I am a CPR enthusiast as anyone who has ever been in my boat can attest, but if I was fortunate enough (or good enough) to net a 30"" hog walleye, I'd be hard pressed not to bring it in and have a mount done. That said, if the Association guidelines state the resort guest can keep 1 fish over 18 inches designated for trophy mounting, than the Resort owners need to adhere to these guidelines or change them and let everyone know. My guess is the guests were tossed for more reasons than the one 28"" walleye, but that's conjecture on my part. Craig"

561035,Mohleye,2006-09-12 09:56:00,368,"I'd let the biologists debate that one. The fact still remains that if you handle that fish carefully and release it, someone else may have the chance to catch the fish of a lifetime. Plus you don't have to worry about handling it for the taxidermist, freezing it properly, transporting it home, etc. As NWO says,a replica is better in all respects, anyway. My buddy caught the only 30""er ever landed in our group a few years ago, and his replica looks great. No way you can tell it from the real thing. From my Gullrock days, the campowners were very stringent on releasing bigger fish. They instituted their own slot system years before the Ontario MNR, and it's pretty hard to argue with the results. Don't know that I could picture either of the camp owners I knew actually kicking anyone out for killing a 28"" fish, but I'm sure they would never have allowed them back."

561036,Guest,2006-09-12 10:05:00,0,"If a camp owner wants to have rules that are more restictive than the regulations then you adhere to the camp rules or go elsewhere. I stay at a camp that does not allow the over slot fish. I do not see the problem with that. They were up front with it when I first booked. If someone got mad and did not want to come back, then the resort really would not have a hard time going to their waiting list and filling that spot."

Quite simply it is a quality/quantity thing. The fish in the 15-25 inch range are the most prolific spawners (adjust the numbers for location). They will release the most viable eggs. Therefore their value is in the volume. The second is proven genetic traits. 30"" fish generally come from 30"" parents. The value here is in the genes. 30"" fish manage to survive tough winters, food shortages, predation, viruses, fungi, temperature changes and more. They also have the genetic abiltiy to grow to larger sizes. But their egg viability is greatly reduced. It isn't gone, just reduced. So in order to ensure not only a healthy population of fish in terms of numbers, but also in terms of big fish as well, slot limits with restrictions on bigger fish are put in place. The lodges with these policies understand this very well. I've caught many 30"" fish (I am blessed by proximity to Lake Ontario) and it is actually pretty easy to let them go. I did kill one when it mangd to completely inhale a 6"" Rebel and it is on my wall. But I have released dozens of 30 inchers and there is no better feeling."
561039,Guest,2006-09-12 10:40:00,0,100% of the Walleye that you fillet die....the majority of the Walleye you release live to fight again and reproduce. I too have read that the bigger fish display strong Genetics and their offspring will also have strong Genetics. Kind of like well antlered Bucks ...their offspring are normally well antelered and become Trophy Deer.

561050,Guest,2006-09-12 14:02:00,0,"The person that everyone is referring to on Gullrock knows the rules of the camp that he was staying at. He had been there many times in the past and like the camp owners do with every guest....they are informed of the camp rules (no fish over 18"")when they first arrive! This person totally disregarded the rules and brought in a 28"" walleye. How does a camp owner handle an individual like this who brings in a big walleye when the other 40 plus guests at camp are releasing the big ones back to be caught another day....by another eager and thankful angler!?! Their (other guests) thoughts are most likely going to be....""if he can bring in a big one....why can't I"". Or maybe they will silently refer to the guy as being an idiot. I'm really not sure but would bet on the first statement to be the most common. I say if you catch a big one.....look at it, admire it, take a picture, thank the fishing gods, and go get a replica done. The camp owners on Gullrock have done an excellent job trying to maintain their fishery for many years to come. I thank them for their efforts."

Different story if he was carving one up to eat it.
