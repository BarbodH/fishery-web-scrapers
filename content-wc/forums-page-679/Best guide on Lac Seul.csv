I too have fished out of Lost Island Lodge (Basil); Evergreen (Shawn); and Silver Water Wheel (leaving in 6 days). If you choose Basil, Shawn or any of the guides at SWWL you won't be disappointed. Nor will you be disappointed by any of the lodges. Remember that Evergreen is housekeeping only while the other two offer American Plan. I'm just passing along my personal experience. I've not stayed at any of the other Lac Seul fishing lodges. However, I've also had great reports from many others. Good luck. Have a great time."
561201,Mike Kansas,2006-09-14 15:05:00,1463,"tlars, Wish I could get that good of support at home....JUST KIDDING DEAR...Glad to hear that you are heading North. We leave tomorrow morning for Ear Falls. We will be fishing at Little Canada Camp below the Dam. Been a great spot for us the last couple years. Hope you have a big fish trip. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
561202,Mike Kansas,2006-09-14 15:09:00,1463,"By the way tlars. My wife thinks I'm the second best Guide on Lac Seul. She has only fished with one other one so I probably shouldn't get to excited about her opinion. But you have to take your applause when you get it. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
561221,7thCrowWing,2006-09-15 15:21:00,132,"Was at lac seul for the 1st time this week, stayed at evergreen, great resort. We didnt hire a guide and had no trouble finding fish. We caught most of our fish less than 1/2 mile from camp."
561228,Guest,2006-09-15 19:15:00,0,Stan gets my vote as well. He is VERY courtious and sincere. Knows tha lake exceptionally well and will show you where and how. You have to catch them!
561229,tly,2006-09-15 19:54:00,1900,"Are you looking for a Musky guide or what? For most other species follow the basics you use at home. Most outposts or lodges have a standard map marked up. Using your own guiles you can improvise. But to have a walleye guide is a luxury that is not needed if you have advice from your host. It is tough not catching fish. Having said that, we have maybe been lucky the last 25 years or so. TLY"

561169,Guest,2006-09-13 14:03:00,0,Who is the best Guide on Lac Seul and how can I reach him. Why do you think he is the best???
561170,Guest,2006-09-13 14:23:00,0,"There are many great guides on Lac Seul! I'll be the first to say that nobody exists who would be in a position to definitively say 'this guy is the best.' You're talking several lodges, totalling probably close to one hundred guides, not to mention those who guide independently on Seul. There are people who have fished several places on Seul and been out with many different guides, who could share their personal preferences (like ""Mike Kansas""), but that leads to another question of what you consider ""the best"" means. The same guide is not the perfect guide for all guests/groups. A good operator knows this, and spends significant time in the off-season trying to pair guests with the most appropriate/preferred guide. Several qualities are mandatory for good guiding, but some qualities may only be best when guiding a family with young children, vs. a group of experienced older fishermen, vs. a group of tournament anglers.

561171,Guest,2006-09-13 14:40:00,0,"OK NWO, There will be two adults fishing and we would like to just catch some fish."
561172,Guest,2006-09-13 14:47:00,0,This is big lake what part of it are you staying on? Are you staying at a camp/resort?
561173,Guest,2006-09-13 15:05:00,0,Haven't picked a Resort yet. Looking for Guide recommendations first and hopefully find Resort that is associated with a Guide. Want to try to get my name in somebodys hat now in hopes that I can get a reservation early for next year. I know it is tough to get in most Lac Seul Resorts because of repeat business but I'm trying.
561177,Guest,2006-09-13 17:18:00,0,"I believe I would be more concerned about getting a cabin reserved than choosing a guide. Quite a few of the camps have a waiting list. I know, I've been on more than one."
561181,Mike Kansas,2006-09-13 17:54:00,1463,"I have fished out of two Resorts on Lac Seul that I have utilized Guides at. They are Silver Water Wheel and Lost Island Lodge. Both of these Resorts are top of the line Resorts and have excellent Guides. However both will be difficult to get reservations at because of their repeat business. Silver Water Wheel I believe has 8 to 10 Guides or maybe more. They are very well versed with how to catch fish on Lac Seul and if you are able to get in at SWWL you will have a great time fishing and eat like a King. The Guides meet every night after supper and discuss their days results and exchange the information required to put their guests on fish the next day. FIVE STAR RESORT Lost Island Lodge has at least three Guides and last year was our first year there. Four of us had our wives there for a week and I had never fished that part of the lake. We decided to hire a Guide so we could be reasonably assured that we would be on fish. That is when we met our Guide. His name is Basil. The wives all fell in love with him because of his gentle ways and his patience and his delicious shore lunch. But most of all they liked Basil because he put us on fish every day...FIVE STAR RESORT These are the only two experiences I have with Guides on Lac Seul. But I have stayed at Evergreen Resort and Lac Seul Lodge. They both have Guides avaliable and if the Guides are as good as the Resorts are you wont go wrong at Evergreen or Lac Seul Lodge..FIVE STAR RESORTS Lac Seul is a great fishery and it has many quality Resorts and many Great Guides. I believe that almost any Guide on Lac Seul can put you on fish. I base this on the fact that I make several un guided trips every year to Lac Seul to areas that I have fished previously and we ALWAYS catch more fish than the good Lord should allow. Its because we know the places to fish and any Guide worth his salt will also. I also believe the key to getting a good Guide is find a well ran Resort that insists on excellent customer service. You find that Resort and you will find a Guide that you will enjoy fishing with and it will be productive. The resorts I have named will all meet your expectations. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
561184,Guest,2006-09-13 21:40:00,0,"I stayed at Goose Bay Resort 4 miles south of Ear Falls. We were there the first week of July. The guide that the camp owner Andrea gave us was a Native who has lived there all his life. His name is Stan. He put us on the fish. Covered water all the way to McKenzie Bay. Cabins are housekeeping and reasonable. Guide was $125.00 for the day. Rental boat and fuel is extra, or if you have your own boat he will take you in that. I have to agree that booking your cabin now is and should be your first priority. BOOK NOW! If you have your own boat, GPS will be the key to mark all your spots and travels. There are many hidden hazards on Lac Seul. If you rent a boat it would be wise to purchase a handheld GPS. Only thing you can't predict is weather. You will catch fish! Good Luck! Riveratz"
561185,Guest,2006-09-13 21:48:00,0,Evergreen Lodge still has openings as of 2 weeks ago. They have a couple guys that can put you on fish. Shawn is a great guy and Gary may be able to take you out also. You may not need a guide. Gary is tuned in and will mark up a map for you and if you have problems they will help you out with spots and technique. They are good folks. Give them a call.
561188,180FH,2006-09-13 22:10:00,444,this has to be one of the most ridiculous and just plain arrogant posts I have ever seen....
