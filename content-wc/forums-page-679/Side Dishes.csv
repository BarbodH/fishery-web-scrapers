560847,Guest,2006-09-04 20:01:00,0,"Well the standard of course is potatoes, usually fried in oil but not always. You can cube them and put them in a pot of hot oil, or slice them and cook them in a pan as ""silver dollar"" potatoes. Actually, I'm sure you could have potatoes pretty much any way you want. I pre-cook all potatoes half-way and then cube them into bite-size pieces before going out on the water, so shore lunch will go faster not having to wait on potatoes, which always take longer than fish. Now, cooking potatoes in oil over an open fire is a skilled trade, and takes some practice to get right (or the way that you like them). Here are a couple pointers for people trying to get potatoes right. First of all, open fire is almost always the best heat source. Potatoes require much more heat than other things you will cook. Your fire should be long, having a hotter end and a cooler end. If there is a breeze, you should build your fire accordingly to take advantage of wind fanning the heat to one end, and use that for your taters. Oil temperature is the key!! Moreover, the ability to quickly change the amount of heat (and thus the oil temperature), is very important. That is why an open fire is best . . . you can lower heat quickly by putting water on the fire or closing up th draw (of air), or raise the temperature quickly by opening up the draw or spooning some of the oil onto the fire, adding wood, etc. So, after adding the pot of oil to a hot fire, the next mistake people make is putting the taters in at the wrong time. It's not really how long to wait, as in a time, but rather having the proper temperature. Add one or two chunks of potato to the oil to monitor the temperature. As the oil heats up, the tater will rise to the top and then slowly start bubbling around the edges. This is how you want the taters to act when you add them, so let it heat up a bit more, because remember when you add the bag of taters, you will cool down the oil. If you put them in too early (oil too cold), you taters will be soft and mushy, and some may break apart. If you put them in too late (too hot), you will have burnt, blackened potatoes, still uncooked in the middle. As you cook your taters, try to keep the right amount of 'bubbling'. Again, this takes some experience to know what that right amount is (hard to describe too), and use spoonfuls of oil to keep that temperature. More often people make mistakes by cooking them too cold than they do too hot. If you want to add diced onions to your taters, which many people enjoy, the proper time to add them is just when a good majority of the taters start to brown. This will ensure that your onions are cooked but don't look like bacon bits. As the taters continue to brown they are nearing completion, and you should give them a couple big bursts of heat. This will give your taters that little-bit-crunchy outside, but still soft and tasty on the inside. Drain the oil and add seasonings of your choice, and you should have some good taters. Another choice is wild rice. I actually cook that dish with half wild rice, half white rice, again pre-cooked to speed up shorelunch. First, sautee some onions, celery, and canned mushrooms in a bit of margarine, then add the rice combo, maybe some french onion, teriyaki sauce, lemon juice, assorted seasonings, and just a touch of water to take some of the grease off the rice. I have some others, but we'll see what other people have. NWO Fishing Bum"

Dried soup mix works good in noodles Mac and cheese, Zatarans rice of any flavor. Dried spuds of any flavor and they make good potato cakes also. Go to the super market sometime and just walk up and down the iles. When you have to watch the weight on a fly in dried food is the way to go."
