561018,sifty,2006-09-11 17:51:00,46,Just returned from second 2006 trip to Gullrock on sat. Best fishing that I've seen in the last 6 years. Weather was great and the lake was producing. Caught most in the shallow/weed flats. One morning caught over 15 fish 20inches or bigger. Had a hard time finding slot size that morning. Little joes and a crawler was working the best. silver or gold blade.
