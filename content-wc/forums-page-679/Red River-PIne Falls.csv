561194,Guest,2006-09-14 09:14:00,0,"I am just curios to see when every one is planning on going up to the Red River/Pine Falls to fish this year. Are there any specific reasons why you like to go during a certain time period? Our group had reservations at Selkirk for October 4-7. We always go on the first week of October, I guess it is just tradition, been going for 8 years now. Now, some members in my group aren't going, so looking to go at a different time. In the last few years it seems like we have been just a little too early for the fall run. What factors play a big role in your decision to go up? Weather, water temp, river flow, or just pick a week and go with tradition."
561195,lund115,2006-09-14 09:54:00,698,"I would love to be able to decide a few weeks in advance on when we would go up. With everyone in our group having full time jobs and having families, we have to make our plans a few months in advance. I wish we had the luxury of being able to pack things up and being up there with in a weeks notice. We have been going the 3rd week of October the past few years. I would rather be a little late than a little early for the fall run. At least there will be a few greenbacks in there for us if we are a little late!! If you are early, you may not have any greenbacks in the system yet. We would like to have the water temp in the 53-49 degree range. I have learned that a lot of people are tight lipped on how the fishing really is up there. (Don't blame them) So if you can leave with in a weeks notice, I would go when you hear people are catching a few big ones here and there ..usually means fishing is going pretty good. Our biggest problem each year is whether to go to Pine Falls or the Red. Always catch more fish in the bay, but always hear that a higher percentage of bigger walleyes come out of the Red. Can anyone justify this theory with their own experience?"
561196,Guest,2006-09-14 10:08:00,0,"I am heading up on the 23rd... just to have a look around. It's still early so I am not expecting much. Since I'm from Winnipeg, it's easy for me to do so. Traditionally, I always base myself on water temperature. Low 50's is what I look for, when that happens all depends on what kind of fall we have. I guide on the Winnipeg river... The section from Pointe du bois to the Ontario border. The water temperature last weekend was 67F. Marine weather is indicating 64F at Pine Falls now (http://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/marine...e_e.html?45140). We are starting to get some cooler night time temperatures which will help get the water temp down. http://www.theweathernetwork.com/wea...s/CAMB0157.htm The last cpl years, have seen larger fish come from the Red. I dont fish the Red much as I cannot stand the volume of traffic. I prefer to fish Pine Falls. I might not get as many big ones but they are there. Seen many 30""+ weighed in during the tourneys. Mid to end October is my preference at Pine falls. Roger"
561209,manitobawalleye,2006-09-14 21:19:00,885,"mid oct to mid nov is my preference nothing like jigging up big fish at treaty rocks last year last day was dec 4th i believe heading up on the 30th then the 5th,6th,7th,8th nice winds tonight but still to warm manitoba .... a 100,000 lakes how many walleyes ???? i will never have enough time...."
561210,Guest,2006-09-14 23:32:00,0,did you hear that they are charging $20.00 launching fee? A one time charge for the rest of the season. Its for repairs to the launch I really think thats a great idea. Good launches I think are very important.
561212,Guest,2006-09-15 08:38:00,0,"I agree that fishing the Red River is crowded to say the least at times. There is a reason there are so many boats there. I believe your odds increase for a bigger fish on the Red. The number of bites to big fish caught is better at the Red compared to Pine Falls. All of my buddies would agree with me on this. I do factor fewer boats at Pine Fall due to the need of having a bigger boat to handle the waves, and some people do not want to put up with the waves out on the bay. My 4 biggest greenbacks have been from the Red (ranging from 14-15.8) I admit, I fish the Red 90% of the time now. So some people might say ""No wonder your biggest fish are from the Red, you hardly fish Pine Falls"" In fact, Back in the day when I could take the pounding waves. I would fish more times at Pine Falls than the Red. After numerous years fishing both places and keeping a personal journal. My conclusion is that you will catch more fish at Pine Falls on most days. With a lot of 18-24 inchers, and a few masters mixed in. On the Red, if the saugers are not biting like crazy, you will catch fewer fish on a given day, but I would say 30% of the greenbacks caught will be over 7 lbs (Better odds for a big one). I do like the serine beauty at Pine Falls and will still go there when I know it will be a calmer day. I prefer Pine Falls for the simple fact that I do not have to deal with a lot of boats I fish this these water systems from early October- late November. So I have had great luck spread out over these two months. You can not put dates on when is the best time is. It all depends on the specific year. I would agree with Lund115, Water temp. is the most important thing, and is better to be a little late than early. People do tend to be tight lipped in these parts. So if you hear fishing is good, you better drop everything and get up here. Good luck to all & have a safe fall."
561215,Guest,2006-09-15 09:13:00,0,I am coming up the first week in October and I'm a little worried about the warm weather and the big fish not being in yet. I'd love to hear water temps if anyone has them. Also the status of shiners in the Red. Thanks.
