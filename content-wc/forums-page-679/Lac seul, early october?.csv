How is the fishing? We have mostly fished by chamberlain narrows in June-Aug so I am a complete amateur for october fishing. We have also fished around deception up to Senn. Any comments would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! RMK"

Hope this helps: ""Yes, I have been out there until the middle (2nd, 3rd week of October). The volume of fish on later-season spots starts to drop-off in October, but they are there. I've found fish holding more often to rocky or rock-sand structure that late, and mega-sand structure has much lower volume than in July through September. For the most part, fish are in 22'-40'. From my Bay of Quinte days in S. Ontario as a kid, the walleyes come back up fairly shallow, especially at night, cruising along the deep edges of dying weedbeds in October. I haven't seen this as much on Seul. I've tried a myriad of such places in late-September-October, and it's been very hit and miss. You're best bet is probably exposed windward points or shorelines, offering rock and rock-sand transition in the 20'-40' range, and close to deep water (minimum 50'+). I'm not sure which part of the lake you're headed to, but it's starting to get mighty cold and very quiet out there, particularly if you're in the more-isolated, central part of the lake. Go prepared for the conditions possible at that time of year!"" NWO Fishing Bum"

JUST A TERRIFIC TRIP YEAR AFTER YEAR. I'M GOING AGAIN THE 30TH THRU OCTOBER 6 THIS YEAR. AWESOME WALLEYE AND MUSKY ACTION. USUALLY THE FISH ARE FAIRLY DEEP, (15' TO 35') BUT FALL PREY TO VERTICAL JIGGING LARGE (3-5 INCH) DACE OR SUCCERS ON 1/4 TO 1/2 OZ JIGS. BRIGHT COLORS OR BETTER YET CHROME OR GOLD PLATED STROBE JIGS WORK WELL FOR ME. BIGGER FISH YEAR AFTER YEAR. WE DO SOME THROWING FOR MUSKIES AND SOME TROLLING FOR SKIS' AND EYES. DEEP DIVING BRIGHT COLORS OR FIRE/TIGER PATTERNS HAVE PRODUCED FOR US. 18 DAYS AND COUNTING."
