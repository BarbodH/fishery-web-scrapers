561091,jazzman,2006-09-11 08:36:00,13,Just got back from LOW. I was in Obabicon yesterday. Water in entrance is low but was able to get through using my bowmount with big motor raised. Crappie bite has started in the elbow.Good luck.
561025,Bill Krejca,2006-09-11 20:59:00,6107,"Thanks for the input. My concern is to have to fight an oncoming current when leaving. It sounds like the water is low enough that you couldn't run your big motor, which indicates a potential tussle if the wind pulls the water out, then it returns as one wants to leave. It is good to hear that the crappie are starting, assume the water temperature had dropped, due to the cool nights."

My 20 foot Lund had trouble and the crappie fishing was poor. There was a lot damage done to the Obabikon, Miles Bay and Hay Island last year due to netting and it will show this year."

561154,jazzman,2006-09-12 19:44:00,13,Sorry to hear you didn't do as well in Obabicon.I was in there last Saturday and the crappies were active in the elbow. I caught several and kept 10 in about an hour for a great fish dinner for my wife and I. I started fishing with a jig and minnow and did not do very well until I changed to a simple hook and minnow with a sinker about 2 feet above the hook. A lot of times I would get bit on the drop on the way to the bottom. As far as getting in to Obabicon I agree it is not advisable for a larger boat. I have a 17 ft. Lund Pro V and got though against the current going full power with the bow mount electric and my main motor off and raised. The water level reminded me of several years ago when I had similar if not lower water level issues.

561158,PJM,2006-09-12 23:55:00,3516,"jazzman Doing well is a matter of opinion. We caught a lot crappies, but don't keep them under 11 inches and they were hard to find."

560858,Bill Krejca,2006-09-05 10:06:00,6107,"OK, here's my annual LOW water level question. Heading up in a week and a half, interested in getting in and out, especially out, of Obabikon Lake. What is the level now, compared to 2003, and has anyone had any excruciating experiences this year getting out of Obab due to the water flowing back into it after a windy day on the big water? I realize there is a Board chart for reading water levels, but I'm afraid I need a Chart 101 Class on reading it. Also, how's the crappie fishing been, if at all, between Stevens Bay, Hay Island, and Obab? Water temp? Thanks,"
560875,MTJ,2006-09-05 16:32:00,106,I don't remember exactly what the water level was like in 03 but I do know that my cousin was up in OB Lake in July fishing Northerns. He said it was no trouble getting in with the bowmount and equally easy getting out. Hope we can get in and out this year.
560878,rpieske,2006-09-05 17:07:00,1276,"The water is about 8""-10"" higher than in 2003. A few weeks ago you could still get in and out. Should still be able."
560882,Guest,2006-09-05 17:58:00,0,"Hi Bill, You would not be basing out of Tomahawk resort by chance?? doing one of thier houseboat renatls?? I seem to remember a Bill 3 years ago from Wis. that was up there the same time as my party was from Denver."
560891,Bill Krejca,2006-09-05 20:48:00,6107,"Sorry, wrong Bill. I'm staying at Young's in Stevens Bay. The reason for the '03 reference is because the level that fall was very low, and my friends had a difficult time getting out of the lake in the late afternoon, due to the current coming back in after a windy day, north or west wind, I assume."
560897,Guest,2006-09-06 09:14:00,0,"Bill, How long is the trip from Young's to Obabikon? Just curious, I usually stay near Miles Bay but have considered Young's Camp. TL"
560899,rpieske,2006-09-06 10:10:00,1276,If you go out through Burrow Bay the trip should be about 20-25 miles.
560902,Bill Krejca,2006-09-06 10:58:00,6107,"Yeah, that's the way I go. It can be a lot smoother ride than going around Rabbit Point."
560910,Guest,2006-09-06 13:48:00,0,"We are heading up tomorrow. Hope to shoot a lot of ducks and get some nice walleyes. My buddy did very well last week up in Miles Bay. Dragging jigs and minnows along shorelines. Give me a call on ch. 14 (Baitmaker). We are at Mylie's Place, Morson."
