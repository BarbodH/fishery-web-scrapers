560986,retire55,2006-09-10 11:40:00,1029,"Just returned from a week (2-9 Sep 06) on Lake Kipawa. The catching was slow by any standard. Not once during the week did we think we had found a school or even a decent sized pod of walleye. Our experience was that the walleye were very scattered. We did a lot of searching, both shallow and deep. Most walleye marked or caught were (belly to the bottom) in 25 to 35 feet of water. Leeches were more productive than crawlers. Lake trout were somewhat more cooperative. We've also fished Lake Ogascanane (Sep 2000). Unfortunately, we had 4 days of inclement weather (wind, more wind, rain and cold temps). There's few places there to fish during such weather - the only drawback."

560993,FET,2006-09-10 17:59:00,5,"There is 2 camps on the lake with 10 or so cabins each. This is the first yr at Bear Skin Lodge for us as we usually stay at Charlton Lake Camp. The Lake is obviously named Charlton Lake. Both have websites but the focus is more on portage' trips in the adjacent Provincial Park. The fishing isn't always a ""gimme"" but with hard fishing we generally figure out the fish after a couple days. Charlton Lake Camp has the better rental boats. They use 14ft Lunds with 15 hp Johnsons, Bear Skin has the steel boats with 9.9 on them. The reason we are staying with BS this yr is b/c new owners jacked up the prices. Same trip would cost us 2400 Candian. I can give you the full report when we get back but if it's bass your after you better go soon. The lakes are going to turn-over soon. When are you looking to go?"

560907,Ohio fisherman,2006-09-06 11:42:00,989,We are heading up to Kipawa on 9/15 and wonder if anyone has any current reports? We hope to do some catching in addition to fishing. thanks and best wishes.
560935,PIKEMAN1,2006-09-07 10:31:00,14,"I have been to Ontario and Quebec about thirty times,to Kipawa once. Kipawa was the worst fishing I have ever had in Canada period. My advice would be go somewhere else.Sorry"
560936,Ohio fisherman,2006-09-07 11:00:00,989,"Thanks for the report. When did you go to Kipawa? They all say fishing is good. I do not want to waste my vacation and expenses. Not sure what to do. Thanks, O F"
560942,Mondo_OH,2006-09-07 16:08:00,58,"Ohio, havent really read much good on here about Kipawa over the years, do a search on it. I would suggest also doing a search for O'Sullivan Lac Lodge if you want to go to Quebec. Some great information on here from guys that have gone there. I have gone past Kipawa over the years but never fished there, just never really impressed me much. I,like you, hate to waste a good fishing vacation on a so-so place. Good luck!!"
560943,Guest,2006-09-07 19:18:00,0,I have fished this lake several years. The fishing has significantly declined each of the last three years. To sum things up the quality of the fishing is a big reason why we choose to visit any lake. We have decided not to return next year. The lake is very scenic and most of the outfitters are very accomodating. This just isn't enough to get us to come back.
560952,Ohio fisherman,2006-09-08 11:32:00,989,"Thanks for the info. The prospects do not sound too good. Maybe we should look elsewhere. Any suggestions? best wishes, O F"
560955,PIKEMAN1,2006-09-08 13:47:00,14,"ohio fisherman---I was there in May and a friend of mine was there this past July.Nice lake,nice camps, but no fish.Check out Ogascanan.com ,it is about the same area and has some fish.Good luck."
560962,Guest,2006-09-08 17:49:00,0,"Wow, another negative report. It seems that most reports show lots of fishing and very little catching. I must find somewhere to go. I checked out Ogascanan and they are iffy about taking on someone that late, it sounds like they are trying to close down for the season. thanks for the info."
