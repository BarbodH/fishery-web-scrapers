560995,Guest,2006-09-10 18:43:00,0,"I've been going to Minaki since 1970. I love that place! The newly built Paradise park on Holtz Point has great cabins with all that was mentioned,air conditioning, satellite t.v., screened in porch,overlooking beautiful Gunn Lake. The problem is that the fishing has not been that excellent for the past few years. This past summer when in Minaki I stayed at Paradise Cove 2. I couldn't believe how much of a Ghost Town it reminded me of. This was the first year that I've seen it so dead. I know Duane the owner has always promoted catch and release, especially the breeders. I also know why his business is way down. It definitely isn't the 2 fish limit. It's because the Canadian experience has lost it's luster due to the fact that the system has been depleted and people don't want to spend their money and time in Canada catching only a few fish here and there. I know this has been a topic on WC. While I was there this past July 15 thru 22,I towed my boat up to the English River, an hours drive from Minaki to the dam (power plant) at Caribou Falls. The walleye fishing was far superior than that at Minaki. Of course the year before I hired a guide from Halley's camp there and GPS'd all the spots we fished at. It was worth the $$$! Expensive, but worth it. I hired the guide through River Air in Minaki 800-465-3325. It is a family business that runs a camp in Caribou Falls and has many fly-in outpost camps. We caught some fish in Minaki but is was the same old run here and run there for only a few fish. Finally, I spent a week in Lac Seul out of Ear Falls. And yes, it definitely is the Canadian Experience that fisherman wait and plan for all year long. It was like the old Minaki in the 70's and 80's. Of course since this was my first Lac Seul experience, meaning I don't know this system at all (and it's huge) I highly recommend getting a guide the first day. The guide will put you on fish and navigate you through unknown waters with tons of hazards that are unmarked. Have the guide show you as many spots as possible all the way to McKenzie Bay, and GPS everything including your routes to avoid hazards. If you don't have GPS buy a hand held one. It's more important, or just as important, anywhwhere on any system as your fishing pole. I will be giving Minaki a rest for the next few years and have already booked a week at Halley's camp on the English River and a week in Lac Seul (Goose Bay Camp)out of Ear Falls for 2007. When I take my kids fishing in Canada I want them as well as myself to have a true Canadian experience and that is catching a ton of fish. Not running here and running there for just a few fish. Lastly, Duane needs to spruce up Paradise Cove 2. It seems to be neglected for the past few years. C'mon some fresh paint, modernize the fish house, weekly clean all the spider webs by the stairs and cabins by the docks, etc etc. Since business is way down it's time to be proactive and do something about the overall look of the place. Just my opinon as something I see that should be done to help promote his camp. Because it sure hasn't been the fishing or as I would say (The Canadian Experience). GOOD LUCK! Good luck!"

561013,balsl6,2006-09-11 13:16:00,426,I would check out the Northwest angle of Minnesota on Lake of the woods. There are a lot of nice places and they are pretty reasonably priced. I think this website gives you a list of all the resorts? lakeofthewoodsresorts.com Here are few of my recomendations these are all on islands that give a special expeirence to the trip. All of these places are good and the people are great. Flag Island Resort Angle inn Lodge Baystore Southpaws sunset lodge (will be brand new due to fire) Sportmans Lodge on Oak island

560898,Guest,2006-09-06 09:30:00,0,Our family of 8 is wanting to go to Ontario next summer. We would like to go to a resort that we can catch some fish at and is reasonably priced. My Wife and I and our 4 kids and two nephews. the kids are all between 12 and 16 except for the 7 yr old. Im in hopes that I can find someplace that we can keep the Resort cost under $2000 for a week. Any help with suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
560901,Guest,2006-09-06 10:42:00,0,family 8 We stay in Nestor Falls on Lake of the Woods at Canadian Haven. Brian/Kathy do a great job. Canadianhaven.com
560913,Guest,2006-09-06 15:21:00,0,"Check with Goldpines camp. Prices are very reasonable, only problem, you may wind up on a waiting list. Check out www.goldpines.com or call and find out."
560916,rpieske,2006-09-06 17:44:00,1276,I'll second the Canadian Haven Resort in Nestor Falls. Brian and Kathy are great people and have a very family friendly resort. Check out their website. I live in Nestor FAlls all summer and know them well. You will not be disappointed.http://www.canadianhaven.com/
560917,Guest,2006-09-06 17:45:00,0,Check out Golden Hook Camp on Gullrock. Beautiful place and awesome fishing. Bill & Maureen are excellent hosts.
560918,DanL,2006-09-06 18:00:00,262,Donnelly's Minnitaki Lodge. Nice people and nice docking. The lake is preety easy to navigate and you don't have to travel far for walleyes or pike. I think they are in your price range also.
560938,Mohleye,2006-09-07 14:09:00,368,"I think it would be hard to beat one of the camps on Gull Rock in your situation. I think most of them still offer family rates for July and August. Good fishing, easy safe navigation, close to town."
560941,Lund 2025,2006-09-07 15:40:00,130,"I would recommend Coppen's Resort on Rainy Lake. It's just over the border and about 25 miles from Fort Frances. They have a trailer home we stayed in this year that may well accomodate all of you and is within your budget. If you have your own boat they have good docking facilities and, if not, there rental equipment looked good. The owners are also good people and are ""johnny on the spot"" if you have any needs or concerns. We found good fishing very close to the resort. E-mail me at [email protected] if you have any additional questions."
560944,Mr. Walleye,2006-09-07 19:59:00,74,"Check out Wine Lake Camp at www.winelakecamp.com. Boat in 23 miles by water to only resort on the lake. Not a great walleye lake, but the kids would catch tons of northerns. Very well run camp with very clean accomodations. Great place for kids! Reasonably priced."
560950,Guest,2006-09-08 10:11:00,0,Check out paradisecoveminaki.com Great location and the fishing is excellent. Cabins on Holts Point are new and have air conditioning and cable.
