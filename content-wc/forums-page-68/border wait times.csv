6588372,Hillbiehle,2021-08-09 17:18:00,66,Looks like the wait dropped from 7 hours to 2hrs and 30 minutes. Interested to see what it is tomorrow.
6588384,hoppy63,2021-08-09 17:36:00,367,"From what I read you can hit the ""Start over"" button and redo anything"
6588386,hoppy63,2021-08-09 17:41:00,367,I think I did not look close enough at the wait times link. I was looking at the commercial flow not the traveller's flow. I assume there is a difference??
6588392,reddemon2,2021-08-09 18:06:00,255,Down to 15mins now at FF
6588396,stjoeguy,2021-08-09 18:09:00,979,"Yeah, i just saw that. Unbelievable!!"
6588410,C182P,2021-08-09 18:55:00,59,At about 5 a friend in the falls told me there was maybe 50 cars in line. Barely down the highway to the west. I think the mad rush to get their first is over
6588422,Golden Eagle,2021-08-09 19:20:00,2642,It seems that half of the world showed up at midnight so they could beat the crowd. We'll see how it goes Friday and Saturday.
6588442,MN_Moose,2021-08-09 20:10:00,964,Just like the senior special at Denny's. Dinner at 5 to beat the rush.

6588500,v-bay gord,2021-08-10 06:08:00,3168,I wouldn't walk in the tall grass with bare feet anytime soon........
6586588,phishfearme,2021-08-04 11:27:00,1242,"as a reminder, you can check border crossing wait times at:https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/bwt-taf/menu-eng.html i plan on watching these after the 11th and plan our trip accordingly. phish"
6586676,reddemon2,2021-08-04 16:31:00,255,I wonder why Baudette and Grand Portage is not listed on the page
6586928,phishfearme,2021-08-05 09:11:00,1242,good question! here's another crossing times web site that also does not include those two. possibly they are just not busy enough to monitor and post updates?? phishhttps://bwt.cbp.gov/details/03380301/POV
6586932,wmd,2021-08-05 09:17:00,388,"This is coming back into US not going into Canada,just so there is no confusion."
6587138,phishfearme,2021-08-05 16:47:00,1242,"yah - excellent point. the previous link is for going into Canada. thanks, phish"

6587540,port1042,2021-08-06 19:48:00,509,"With ""ArriveCan"" is there a way to change my mind at the last minute and head for Baudette rather than International Falls?"
6587566,BuckeyeATC,2021-08-07 04:09:00,88,Tentative deal reached for Border Patrol. https://blackburnnews.com/windsor/wi...APpHrHDDiWu8FM
6587680,mms3rd,2021-08-07 10:34:00,148,Near the top of the page it refers to 26 busiest points of entry. The list has 26 points.
6588100,hoppy63,2021-08-09 06:31:00,367,"According to website International Falls has 6 hour wait time. By reading posts from guys in line sounds like it may be even longer.....hang in there, it will be worth it! I also see many points of entry with no wait. Hopefully it smooths out."
