6588110,hoppy63,2021-08-09 06:43:00,367,I know more than submitted my last post and opened my ArrivCan app again and there it tells me that there IS an update and recommends updating. Am going to do so now.
6588120,warhawk07,2021-08-09 06:58:00,33,For everybody’s info...I crossed this am at 5 in baudette. I did nott download a new app. As far as I could tell there wasn’t one on the App Store. Waited about 30 min with 12 cars or so ahead of me. Handed the guard hard copies of vax card and test result plus passport . He asked me the standard 5 questions and let me go. Took about a minute for me but I am alone. Good luck
6588122,Twodogs,2021-08-09 07:00:00,115,"It keeps telling me to update my ArriveCan App, tried hitting the update button, nothing happens.. ..I uninstalled it...re installed it and same message pops up...hopefully the bugs get worked out soon for you guys leaving shortly. I have another month of waiting.."
6587928,reddemon2,2021-08-08 13:14:00,255,My bad. Strange that it's not showing any updated version on the Canada Border page
6587936,BreezyPoint,2021-08-08 14:33:00,1581,"Ok, here are some notes: 1. I tried the app today. It, in its current incarnation will NOT work on a iPhone SE generation 1. It will work on Gen 2.2. If you are scanning a Nexus card, you must scan the back of the card.3. You cannot logout and return to where you have left off. We'll see if this is fixed to tonight.4. I will download the new app and see if any of these issues are fixed.I received an email from ArriveCan today. Read this carefully. It is very ambiguous.https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/202...66061cbce6.jpgFrank"
6587940,Jimmy Mac,2021-08-08 14:41:00,96,Thanks for passing this info along. You likely saved me and my techno challenged friends a lot of angst.

6587946,Eckohlt,2021-08-08 15:15:00,3685,And don't have your reels your poles!
6587950,walleyecheek,2021-08-08 15:32:00,2231,And if you do ! By no means have any line on them !&#x1f923;
6587956,Eckohlt,2021-08-08 16:02:00,3685,"Good point,that line could contain alittle COVID"
6588076,Bstar,2021-08-09 05:19:00,564,I'm not seeing any updates to the ArriveCan app.
6588096,BreezyPoint,2021-08-09 06:30:00,1581,"Update there is a new version of the ArriveCan app.Here are some notes:1. Your results are now saved if you don't finish.2. Usability is improved.3. On most pages you will need to scroll down to complete the entire form on that page. This is not always obvious as the continue arrow will be visible. On the vaccination page, it appears that everything is complete and pressing the continue arrow will result in you are not eligible to enter Canada'. That is because you needed to scroll down to enter vaccination proof.I will be testing the process at 12:30 today.Frank"

When I typed in ArrivCan in the search the same app came up and my option was to open it. Do I need to Uninstaller and re-install??? Also in the app (ArrivCan) that I downloaded last week allowed me to put in my information and save it."
6587856,Fisherman Ted,2021-08-08 07:48:00,461,Guys I have just learned that a new version of the ArriveCan app is dropping at midnight tonight. And it is very likely you will need to use THIS new version to cross. So if you have already downloaded the app and filled it out for crossing in the next few days you will need to get the update and do it again (re-submit). Just a heads up -FT
6587866,reddemon2,2021-08-08 08:27:00,255,Looks nice
6587882,mms3rd,2021-08-08 09:23:00,148,"I am so thankful that I'm not going up until late September......the first wave can do a memo with charts and graphs on how to succeed.....it seems like a lot of this will be based upon individual border agents and how they choose to enforce the rules.....just like how conservation officers/""game wardens"" can be reasonable and others strict as heck."
6587886,Skywagon,2021-08-08 10:11:00,1106,"What is your source for needing this new version? Just curious as I have friends on the road right now headed to International Falls to cross in the morning, I would like to alert them if this is a consideration. Thank you"
6587888,reddemon2,2021-08-08 10:17:00,255,"There is not a new version, Not sure what Ted is talking about, If you go in the app store on your phone you can check for updates but as far as removing and re-downloading the app that's false info"
6587890,manfishing,2021-08-08 10:24:00,131,The new version starts August 9th at 12:01 AM
6587892,reddemon2,2021-08-08 10:33:00,255,Where are you seeing this info????
6587900,pjshorthorn,2021-08-08 11:09:00,5654,Here ya go.......it is stated under the heading....The Americans are Coming.https://apple.news/ABOaohobxRfS8Q4TNLGbB9w PjShorthorn
6587902,BuckeyeATC,2021-08-08 11:15:00,88,"It is about halfway down this page. States: ""A new version of ArriveCAN will be released on August 9, 2021 at 12:01 a.m. EDT. Importantly, individuals travelling on or after August 9 should submit their information after this time.""https://www.canada.ca/en/border-serv...1lgl-PbIxMFPsk"
6587904,MikeF,2021-08-08 11:28:00,895,"Maybe the new version will have a simplified land crossing section, seperate from sea and air. One can only hope. Good luck to the first wave."
