6588842,troutwater,2021-08-10 17:56:00,299,"He did ask...twice. First was for any live or dead bait, and then asked about crawlers when I said no. Also asked the normal stuff....firearms, alcohol, etc. Last question was if we had a fever now or recently. The exchange was very pleasant"
6588844,Eckohlt,2021-08-10 17:58:00,3685,"If you get the random test,bring along a bear suit and have one of your guys put it on,then video the bear going through the truck and that bear ate your test kit,go fishin"
6589086,Prairieboy43,2021-08-11 11:24:00,38,"Wow impressive. Airport in Toronto takes 8 hours. Two hours sitting on the plane, and six hours in line. ðŸ¥ƒðŸ¥ƒðŸ¥ƒðŸ¥ƒðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬https://youtu.be/LpTeMB_j_PE"
6588292,Eckohlt,2021-08-09 13:47:00,3685,I think I knew about that crossing back in the 60's
6588294,Eckohlt,2021-08-09 13:48:00,3685,It is a nice drive for sure!
6588408,BreezyPoint,2021-08-09 18:51:00,1581,"About30 minutes for me at 1:00 pm today, 8/9/2021Frank"
6588508,troutwater,2021-08-10 06:27:00,299,"I'm crossing at Baudette/Rainy River this evening. The lines at IF yesterday have me spooked, so I figured I'd go here instead. I'll report back with how it goes."
6588538,1shooter,2021-08-10 07:21:00,1493,Just looked at I Falls and appears the initial mad rush to cross is over and there in no wait times.
6588798,troutwater,2021-08-10 16:40:00,299,Just crossed at Baudette. There were literally no cars and drove right up to the booth. Total exchange took max 3 minutes
6588802,Wallychowder,2021-08-10 16:45:00,1567,did they ask if you had crawlers ?
6588832,Eckohlt,2021-08-10 17:40:00,3685,Chow you going up this fall?
6588836,walleyecheek,2021-08-10 17:50:00,2231,I'm not sure yet ? I'm going to wait and see if all the nonsense calms down at the border. I really dont want to do any facetime with Justin. Oh Shi] I cant anyway i have a flipper !
6588840,Eckohlt,2021-08-10 17:55:00,3685,"If you go I can leave you my crawlers,if I have some leftover."
6588146,Guest,2021-08-09 07:41:00,0,Does anyone have information about the line at Baudette?
6588178,Golden Eagle,2021-08-09 08:34:00,2642,Phone: (218) 634-2803 for information
6588256,AMPHIB206,2021-08-09 11:38:00,191,https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/bwt-taf/menu-eng.html#s1 Welcome back to Canada! It's been a long ride for both countries!
6588258,Golden Eagle,2021-08-09 11:46:00,2642,Thanks for the welcome. I can't find a site for wait time at Pigeon River and Baudette. Will cross border August 20 and will make a call to Pigeon River in case the wait time at International Falls doesn't become more friendly.
6588260,1shooter,2021-08-09 11:48:00,1493,I bet it will get better every day.
6588264,phishfearme,2021-08-09 12:06:00,1242,crossing times at these two spots have been historically so low that these are not monitored. we use pidgeon river all the time and avoid IF like the plague. phish
6588274,MN_Moose,2021-08-09 12:37:00,964,It's been so long since I visited Canada that an entirely new bridge has been completed. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMyy6ntpFkY
6588278,mms3rd,2021-08-09 12:44:00,148,"For years, I went up from Kansas City up I-35 through the Cities and on through to I. Falls. I'm now a little south of St. Louis, close to 55 and 64. I'm planning to go up through Toma, WI, the Cities and on to I. Falls. Thoughts about directions, more importantly, border crossing. One year, went through Pembina/N. Dakota.... that particular time, worse than I. Falls and only time got pulled over on way in."
6588280,Golden Eagle,2021-08-09 12:46:00,2642,"It's longer, but well worth it due to scenery alone the north shore of Lake Superios, plus Grand Marais is a great spot for a meal or overnight stay. You and I may be doing one of those ""there goes the neighborhood"" by sharing our favorite crossing point."
6588288,7 Mag,2021-08-09 13:39:00,1887,"I would go 55-39-90-94 & 53 in Eau Claire, you will avoid the major cities. 53 is in good shape, there's some road construction in Superior but nothing major to deal with."
