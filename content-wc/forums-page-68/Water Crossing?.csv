We will have our passports, vaccine cards, will plan to have the Can Arrive App filled out, and neg test at the border crossing at Sprague. So we've been checked by Canadian customs. Can we, as in 2019 and prior, just enter Canadian waters (without setting foot on Canandian soil) and fish for the day? Thank you! This group has been a wealth of information, and help in getting this planned."

The RABC program is also suspended at this time so that is not an option. I will be on Oak Island Labor Day weekend so I am in the same situation asking the same questions as you. My other concern is getting back home. Technically the ""vaccinated exemption"" is for land port of entries. This I am guessing does not include the remote reporting stations at Jim's corner or Youngs Bay. At least as the rules are written, to cross back into Canada for the drive home you will need to go through the whole process again and present another negative Covid test which we all know we cant get up there. Suppose there might be some sort of exception if you were doing a day trip and stayed within the 72 hour window of the initial test that got you up there, but the rules as listed would require you to present a test again. I am hoping this is just one of those odd issues that still needs to be addressed but it is concerning. Pretty sure figured out travelers to the Angle is a relatively low priority. My guess is you will make that call and they will tell you to drive straight through to Warroad without stopping but just not sure yet. Good luck fishing!!"
