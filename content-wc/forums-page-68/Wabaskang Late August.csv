6586294,TMF89,2021-08-03 17:39:00,77,"So our annual fly-in trip fell through, but we still wanted to get into Canada somehow. Found an open cabin at Tall Pines Camp on Wabaskang. The lake seems to get a lot of good reviews overall, and looks like it should be a good time. Guessing our best bet for eyes will be jigging/spinners on deep points/reefs/humps/neck-downs this time of year? Should we be expecting navigational issues with the dry summer we've been having? It does look like there are a few fairly shallow parts between the various lake bodies, and we'll be bringing our boat along for the trip. 17' Lund with a 115hp on the back. Thanks for the information/advice as always!"

6586442,HeHooksHimself,2021-08-04 06:05:00,725,We cross Wabby to get to paradise. Careful as there are some unmarked shallow spots. Plenty of boat traffic so you should be able to determine good routes. Good luck and it will great to be in Canada. Fish On! Hooks
6586574,jsmyers,2021-08-04 11:06:00,198,"I've fished Wabaskang many times, though not in August since the 90s or much for walleyes. (We targeted pike.) I too will be crossing it to get to ""paradise"" (Wine Lake) in September. Its pretty cool to re-live our Wabaskang memories while heading to new adventures off the grid.I went to Sleepy Dog in June 2019, this trip report might be helpful: https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=695976(I'm sure I'll be back to Wabaskang in future years too.)I've been reading the Tall Pines blog. It seems like they'll be able to put you on fish better than I could. One tip: there is a large bed of cabbage right in front on Tall Pines. It has produced a number of nice pike for us over the years (including August).If you want any other tips for Pike, let me know."
6586866,UKBDM,2021-08-05 06:59:00,178,I have heard that the various narrows are still navigable but proceed with caution. Our camp (Jim and Julie's) will not be opening due to the low water level in the shallow bay where they are located. Can't get the dock in the water.
6586904,jsmyers,2021-08-05 08:16:00,198,"You may also want to search this forum for ""Wabaskang"" or ""Wabby."" I know I learned a lot about the lake over the years this way.This other forum is pretty quite now, but there is a 19-year old thread that might help: https://www.lake-link.com/forums/can...ontario/11934/"
6587730,TMF89,2021-08-07 15:22:00,77,"Thanks for all the advice guys! I've done a fair bit of reading on this forum and others, that's what helped me choose the lake. I'm mainly concerned about the channels heading to the east/west, and north of ""2nd Lake"" on the Tall Pines map. https://www.tallpinescamp.com/lake-mapUKBDM, I very well may have emailed you asking about availabilities at your camp. I believe you told me the same thing then, that you guys aren't open this year due to low water conditions. Are you located in the same bay as Tall Pines? I specifically mentioned the low water concerns to them, since I can see how much skinny water will be needed to be traveled upon each day, as well as the fact that their boat ramp looks like it's fairly shallow. They seemed to think it wouldn't be an issue, so fingers crossed, I know how to throttle down and trim up, but it'd be great to know of any potential minefields ahead of time!"
6588116,jsmyers,2021-08-09 06:51:00,198,"You'll probably need to worry more about the narrows between 1st and 2nd lake. Its narrower than that between 2nd and 3rd (Big) Lake. The system picks up a fair amount of water between those two narrows, with significant inflows from Florence Creek, Aerobus, and Keynote Lakes. If going between Gawley's Bay and 5th (Mean) Lake, use the north-most gap, and take it easy. Its not super-shallow, but there is a lot of shallow water sticking out from shore. The south-most ""gap"" is only a couple of inches deep in normal water conditions, it will be dry. The middle gap is normally navigable, but it is VERY small. I've seen people take it at speed to disastrous results. You may also need to watch it heading into Gawley's Bay from the south. My memory is that there are some rocks in there too.Getting into Ruby Lake or Keynote Lake (south of that map) may be out of the question, thought I haven't been into Ruby Lake for at least 25 years, so I don't remember what that narrows is like. The good news is that small shallow bays are usually the best spots late in the year. I suspect that you'll be careful in the narrows, I think the bigger concern is finding a shallow reef that is usually a safe depth down, but suddenly turns into a shallow hazard. This might help you get an idea of where the known hazards are (look for the ""+"" on the map): https://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/toporama/e...383.0781619119"
6588300,UKBDM,2021-08-09 14:12:00,178,"Jim and Julie's, the camp I usually go to, is the farthest south of the camps on Wabaskang and not in same area as Tall Pines."
