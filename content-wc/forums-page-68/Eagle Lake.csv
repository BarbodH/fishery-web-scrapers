6588610,prov1800,2021-08-10 09:48:00,5010,Bit of a cloudy start on Eagle the other day but did clear up.Weather has cooled down but was 90+ for most of the summer so far.Heres a few more Eagle pics.Scenery wise its the mist beautifull lake around
6588618,7 Mag,2021-08-10 10:06:00,1887,"Thanks for the pictures John, it does look like a beautiful lake!"
6588622,Eckohlt,2021-08-10 10:10:00,3685,"That because the border is putting people through the ringer,lucky if a person even makes it to 105,be like hitting the lottery."
6588630,prov1800,2021-08-10 10:25:00,5010,It's Lots getting through.Clarks had guys there early for flyouts so they must have been near front of line.% of traffic is just low I would of though it would be busier but then lots are putting trip off till next year or have done trips already.Every camp has openings.
6588638,v-bay gord,2021-08-10 10:31:00,3168,"I think it's the other way around. All the people who ""had to be first"" and lined up hours before crossing kind of put the border through the ringer. My hat goes off to the border people who were courteous and professional through what could only have been a sheet show."
6588642,prov1800,2021-08-10 10:34:00,5010,Think your right.Gord.Think it will be smoother sailing now.Heard there were huge lineups. Long shifts for border personal.
