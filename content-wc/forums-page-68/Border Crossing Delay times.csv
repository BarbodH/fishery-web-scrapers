6588320,Hillbiehle,2021-08-09 15:53:00,66,Since other areas of Ontario entry points seem painless and minimal weight time; is the Fort Francis 7 hour delay part of the strike or simply overwhelming amount of people trying to get there today? It's hard to decipher if this is by design or they are simply understaffed.

6588334,walleyecheek,2021-08-09 16:11:00,2231,"One would think that if they have 4 lanes ? That they all would be open ! Unless of course they are playing the ""No contract game"" (work to rule)"
6588336,pjshorthorn,2021-08-09 16:13:00,5654,"IFalls has always been a high volume border crossing. I've waited almost two hours, back 20 years ago, just to get back into the US. Less than five years ago, we arrived at the border to find the wait to cross into Canada to be at least 1-2 hrs. In this case we drove to Baudette and crossed in 15 minutes or so. It is not surprising to me that the wait times are lengthy based on the new requirements and potential staffing issues on day 1. In my opinion, if things aren't more efficient in the next couple of weeks, they won't be for quite a long time. PjShorthorn"
6588342,Skywagon,2021-08-09 16:15:00,1106,"Look at the lakes (area) that most people that post on Walleye Central fish, then consider how many of those people come from MN, Wisconsin and Illinois. Rt 53 is the logical corridor for most to travel, it ends up in International Falls. Pigeon River and Baudette are an option, but for many these crossings are somewhat out of the way."
6588344,reddemon2,2021-08-09 16:18:00,255,"I falls/FF needs a whole new crossing, This crossing is outdated with the amount of traffic that comes thru."
6588360,Wallychowder,2021-08-09 16:42:00,1567,No ! They just need to open all the lanes !
