6588672,stumcfar,2021-08-10 12:05:00,451,Anyone fished Little Savant Lake with Troy and Penny Sawyer. We hopefully will be flying in next June after 2 years of cancellations. Just wondering what to expect from the lake?

As far as Canadian lakes go its about 1300 acres, relatively shallow, probably 40 feet at the deepest. Not at all familiar with it. take a look on Canada's Fish On-Line site. Walleye and Northern Lake."

I would expect decent walleye and northern fishing on Little Savant. All of the sawyers a great folk, Troy and Penny will take good care of you."
