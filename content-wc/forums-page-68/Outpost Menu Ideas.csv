6588088,Bigtaproot,2021-08-09 06:04:00,900,Be very careful using this technique. The best way is to let the water cool down to about 125° drop the steaks in and put in a heavily insulated cooler. If you cook the steaks in water that is near the boiling point you will end up with shoe leather.
6588150,adempsey2.0,2021-08-09 07:46:00,611,"Yes, thanks! No intention of using boiling water, just whatever temp that is normally used (was going to look it up). The cooler idea is good suggestion!"
3659538,DeBo,2015-03-17 10:43:00,211,I make stir-fry a few times a week when we go. I even go so far as to bring my own wok. Usually just use frozen vegetables but I like to take the time to chop fresh veggies as well. Depending how/where you fish there is downtime at some point during the day. Fresh light and tasty.Don't really have any other set recipes but I will be bringing frozen chilli this year and maybe a casserole of some type. Otherwise just plenty of grilled meats with potatoes/rice and plenty of veggies on the side.

My wife make a very, very good spaghetti sauce which we place in freezer bags and then place in the freezer. Like a previous poster said, the frozen sauce acts like an ice block for the drive up to Canada. The above mean is rather a ""cheap"" way to feed the group compared to a meal of steaks and roasts."

Menu planning, for me, is one of the best parts of the trip. I got so much good info. out of this thread 6 years ago. Lobster Mac/Cheese, Precooked Prime Rib with the Mushroom Cream Sauce, Fish Tacos, have all made the cut over the years, and my crew just loves every bit of it. Like to plan a different menu each year. My favorite meal of all is what we call 'Fishing Camp Breakfast.' Consists of scrambled eggs with jack cheese and wild rice, hash browns, pan fried walleye, and english muffins. For years, never bothered with breakfast, but now, we love to make this breakfast at least 2-3 times on a 6-day trip. Many of you guys will recognize your old posts. Hopefully, we are all either going to Canada this year, or are looking forward to 2022."
6586982,SweetD,2021-08-05 11:26:00,243,"French Toast with patty sausage. Eggs, Vanilla, Cinnamon. Mix all together.I use Texas Toast and dip both sides in mixture and cook low and slow in pan or on griddle. I just use PAM to prevent sticking. Sprinkle with powdered sugar then add butter, syrup and BOOM French Toast!!!!This has become a group favorite and generally have at least twice during a 7 day trip!"
6587010,Bigtaproot,2021-08-05 12:26:00,900,"how about instead of just ribeye since it seems you guys like meat substituting skirt steak with chimmichuri sauce that you make before the trip. I would also add a soup such as lentil or something to get a break from heavy meat every night. How about bbq. go to costco and pick up ribs or burnt ends that are prepackaged, combine with slaw and beans and you are rockin. Old lady gets pork neck bones cheap and those a re good in a red sauce B"
6587036,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2021-08-05 13:35:00,240,"Probably my girls' favorite breakfast! Would be a good idea for an outpost breakfast, too--thanks!"
6587126,btyreprich,2021-08-05 16:32:00,1067,"When I had a smoker, I'd prepare a pork shoulder at home and then bring up the pulled pork in a plastic tub. The pork can be placed on a bun - I usually just eat it off the plate. Add fresh locally grown sweet corn and watermelon chunks. We have from time to time, made fresh garlic bread to add onto the menu."
6587910,gordy28,2021-08-08 11:57:00,437,"One of favourites is jambalaya We preamble the base, freeze it and then when in camp chunk up 2 to 3 walleye filets and add. Our base proteins are shrimp and sausage Another one we tried last trip was a simple stir fry. Udon noodles, chicken thighs, a jar of peanut sauce and a pack of frozen stir fry veg. Again super easy, boil noodles, bbq chicken, sautÃ© veggies and then throw all together w the sauce Cheers Andrew"
6587914,adempsey2.0,2021-08-08 12:10:00,611,"It sounds like we are trying ""Sous Vide"" beef this year. Pre-packaged beef that will get tossed into the hot water that was used to boil baby potatoes. Reverse sear it once it is done. I have never done it before, but should be easy enough."

Most years it comes home with us.We have mixed in over the years ribs, polish sausage, chili, pulled pork, pork tenderloin and blackened fish."
3655042,camp chef,2015-03-16 09:50:00,915,Grilled Gourmet Venison Burgers two nights. We cook a whole pork loin the first night in camp and use the leftovers for sandwiches during the week.
3655106,Lovetofish,2015-03-16 10:39:00,458,The last couple trips I've brought along smoked baby back ribs made prior wrapped in foil and froze in zip bags. Let them thaw in the camp fridge a day then add your favorite sauce and re-heat in the oven or on the grill while having your favorite beverage. I also bake a ham at home then slice and freeze for sandwich meat and ham and eggs for breakfast. A couple simple items that take little time to make in camp.
3655234,Algoma Guy,2015-03-16 11:40:00,48,I think you mentioned that your group doesn't do many breakfasts. Why not do breakfast for dinner? Eggs and bacon travel and keep fairly well. Don't be afraid to add some walleye fillets also. To me walleye and eggs is just as tasty as steak and eggs. Plan it for mid week and any potato dish you have left over can usually be manipulated into something edible. Comes in handy too if your group gets a little boomed up one night and skips breakfast.
3655290,bigwalleye1,2015-03-16 12:06:00,2632,"Spaghetti sauce freezes well, functions as an ice block until it thaws, and tasted great. Same for chili. I'm late to the party, but another vote for smoked ribs/pulled pork made ahead and reheated. Also, a pork loin dusted in ginger and black pepper and garlic, srapped in bacon, packed in brown sugar, and put on the grill in a covered foil pan to a 160* internal temp, then sliced and drizzled with the glaxe in the pan."
3655338,SinOrSwim,2015-03-16 12:25:00,1528,"We try to do as much with the walleye as possible. Like someone else said, I can eat all that other stuff at home. Having fresh walleye like that can't be done. We have fried walleye with every single dinner no matter what. Most dinners have walleye incorporated somehow though. The food is one of our favorite parts of the trip. We aren't the type that fish 10 to 15 hours per day."

3657530,michigan walleye guy,2015-03-16 20:29:00,95,"Thanks! Great menu ideas. I'm definitely adding the seafood pasta to the menu this year. Also going to bring a pre-cooked prime rib roast, from Sam's Club or one of Sysco-type vendors that deliver to the local supper clubs. Working this stuff out long in advance is one of the favorite parts of the trip for me. I go once in May and again in June, so it's nice to add some variety to the menu, and you guys sure helped me with that. Thanks a million!!"

3659410,imafishslayer,2015-03-17 10:18:00,64,"The hardest part is getting the group organized with the supplies so that you have enough meals but minimize duplicates. We usually just assign a set # of meals for each family and they decided what to bring. This always ends up with multiple meals of steak and chicken. I like your idea of publishing a menu so that you can get the groceries and supplies right. Of course with us, the schedule depends on the fishing so we may think we have time for a roast but end up staying out to long to cook it. Happens every time..."

Someone had a little fun with presentation this year, but the recipes really aren't complex. I'm pretty sure every one of these was done on a fly in and we might change one meal from year to year until we came to what you see in the report. Hard to take any away. The cheesecake was new this year, but was made at home and frozen to take with . https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=385369"
3654594,MrSimon,2015-03-16 07:17:00,922,"We always make homemade meals ahead of time and take them up frozen. Just pop them on the oven - super easy. Favorites are: Enchiladas Chili Lasagna Chicken/Rice/Mushroom Casserole Honestly, most of us have our wives make it. We use aluminum foil baking pans and freeze everything solid. It works great as ice in the coolers for the trip up and the foil pans scrunch down to nothing for packing out."
3654626,SinOrSwim,2015-03-16 07:21:00,1528,"If you go to that post, picture one and picture 3 are EASILY my favorite meals. The cajun walleye/seafood pasta with a blackened walleye on top and the Walleye/seafood chimis are simply amazing. Like Hawkfan said, not that hard either."

It is pretty much common in SD,ND,MN and FL (just to name few I have experienced) to bring your daily catch to lodge/restaurant and they will prepare for you (for a fee). It is a win/win for them as in addition to a fee for preparing fish, people will spent money on drinks etc. Last place I stayed on Eagle Lake, few years back, when asked owners of lodge if they could prepare my daily catch for dinner, they mumbled something about conservation officer may stop by and they would be in trouble..."

3654810,KSjim,2015-03-16 08:18:00,88,On steak night our group likes to boil some walleye in crab boil. Serve with some melted butter and lemon juice. Our version of surf and turf.

We freeze them for the trip up. Pour on some chicken stock and heat up in the oven. Quick easy and good. Usually serve with a tray of cheesy potatoes, and a steamed veg. We also do the ham early in the week and use it for sammies as the week goes on. We try to vacuum seal or foil tray everything before hand. Casseroles are great...aka Beef Stroganoff......or Swedish meatballs. Lasagna also works good. Buys some time for the cook when you just throw stuff (good stuff )in the oven. Easy clean up as well."
3654874,walleye22,2015-03-16 08:52:00,59,"we bring minimum food. maybe steaks for a night and a pork tenderloin to smoke and cut up for sandwiches the rest of the week. Other than that we eat fresh walleye from the lake various ways. I can eat all that other crap at home all year, which we all do, I cant eat fresh walleye out of a cold Canada lake all year so I do for the time I am up there. We use to take all the groceries and crap and boxes of can foods and was just a pain in the arse but that's how the olfer fella's did it. when they passed on we simplified it. We could literally pack in about 30 minutes now and roll. We buy fresh stuff up in Canada, fruits, veggies and such. We are going there so might as well give back to their economy a little. I am so glad we do not make such a big deal about food anymore up there. was such a hassle. god we use to freeze chili and marinara sauce and stews....such a pain. packing it all and keeping ice on it. Good god man..i do not miss those days at all!!! Can pack our meat in a little cooler these days and we eat fish different ways."
3653234,michigan walleye guy,2015-03-15 17:01:00,95,"I'm in the process of putting together menus for our outpost trips this year. Looking for some different perspective. I always seem to end up with the following: ribeyes, chicken breast, chops, pasties, brats, and ribeyes again. (I could eat steak all 6 nights). Usually have sides such as wild rice, salad, potato salad for the brats, etc. If you were in charge of one meal for the week, what would be your signature meal, complete with sides? We do have a fish fry once a day, and we hardly ever eat breakfast. Don't know why, our group just functions better with the shore lunch and then the BBQ steaks, chicken, chops, brats, etc. after the evening bite. Again, just looking for a different perspective--if you were in charge for one meal during the week, what would it be? Thanks!!"

Normally would put it in the oven at noonish so it was ready in enough time to get back out for the evening bite. Au Grautin potatoes, corn, salad and bread to round out the meal. I just read somewhere that chicken may be an issue transporting into Canada this year due to some concerns with potential disease found in certain US states. May want to check into that if you are planning on chicken for meals. I'll see if I can find the information I read on the subject. PjShorthorn."
