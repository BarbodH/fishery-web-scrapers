6587012,Bigtaproot,2021-08-05 12:30:00,900,good fishing and even better people. They have a cook named Don who is the best cook i have ever met. I think he has cooked for famous people and owned many restaurants
6587044,prov1800,2021-08-05 13:59:00,5010,Looks like everything will line up.What dates you looking at coming.
6587372,10point,2021-08-06 08:33:00,102,Week starting June 4
6588128,Medy,2021-08-09 07:05:00,40,I would seriously look at renting a boat. A small boat with a 10hp is very under gunned for that section of Eagle in my opinion
6588162,10point,2021-08-09 08:02:00,102,I did reserve a boat. One with a 40 horse.
6584814,10point,2021-07-30 12:46:00,102,"All, I have been going to the lessor known fishing area of Ontario east of Lake superior rather than going up through MN. I normally go in June and have now missed the last two years due to Covid. Went to Lake Vermillion last year in MN and didn't do very well. The fishing where I have gone in the past is more smallmouth than walleye. The past few years it has just been my father and I who will turn 81 this fall. Where we have gone in the past we ended up fishing at other lakes a lot and having to trailer the boat around which quickly becomes a hassle. I am looking for somewhere where we can launch the boat and not have to move for a week or at least not more than a few times. I would prefer to take my boat but it is not all that big and only has a 10 horse but I have good electronics and an i pilot trolling motor. There is an option to bring my fathers boat and he has a little bigger boat with a 40 horse. Looking mainly for walleye and smallmouth. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I am thinking somewhere around the Dryden area might be good."
6584826,NARDA 1,2021-07-30 13:21:00,636,Contact Marcel at Birch Dale lodge on Eagle Lake 807-227-5262 Birchdalelodge.com located 25 miles West of Dryden right off the Trans Canada Highway (17) They have their own boat ramp. My group will be heading up in September for our 32nd year there.
6584830,stumcfar,2021-07-30 13:28:00,451,"Not near Dryden but up towards Ear Falls, Gawleys Little Beaver is a nice camp for people with their own boats. Reasonably priced and they will put your boat in and out for you. If you are planning on a June trip you won't have to travel too far to find walleyes, but if you are looking for smallmouth, maybe not a good choice."
6584834,CiscoKid,2021-07-30 13:32:00,28,"I'm headed ot Branch's Seine River Lodge near Antikokan in August, my second time going. 90 miles from Fort Frances, you can use your boat or theirs. Plenty of water to fish - 4 lakes connected without need for portage, very doable with a 10 hp boat. Smallmouth fishing is excellent. Plenty of eatter walleye and smaller pike. I think the walleye fishing could be good too, but if i am honest, we ran into terrible weather and were only able to fish 1.5 days the last time I was there (wind/heavy rain) so cannot attest. Camp owners are great and have plenty of smaller lakes you can trailer to if that is your thing."
6584866,Mrxlh,2021-07-30 16:21:00,210,Bonny Bay camp is a great camp.
6584868,Skywagon,2021-07-30 16:33:00,1106,"Eagle lake would fit in your perimeters, try Vermillion Bay Lodge. The owner posts on here frequently."
6584870,Eckohlt,2021-07-30 16:45:00,3685,"Pick a smaller lake if you have a small boat,you don't want to get blown off the water if the wind blows everyday,a big lake and wind not a good combo for a small boat."
6584882,prov1800,2021-07-30 17:17:00,5010,"Checkout www.clarksresorts.comThere northern lights resort gas cabins right in front if your dock.Easy walking about 50 yds.18 ft Kodiak crestliners with sonar and trolling motors and all the free bait you will need on Cedar Lake.Great fishing for all species walleye,smallmouth,pike and muskie and perch and crappies.Smaller lake 17 mi.

6586480,10point,2021-08-04 07:20:00,102,Thanks for all the responses. It was tough finding an opening for June but I got a week starting June 4 at Vermilion Bay Lodge on Eagle Lake.
6586494,pjshorthorn,2021-08-04 08:16:00,5654,"If you want , PM me your email address and I can give you tips on how to work Gord over a bit during your visit. You will have a fun and relaxing time there. Lots of places to explore when searching for that hot bite. I love the lake as it has so many different species to pursue. If all the border moons align I'll be there this fall. PjShorthorn"
