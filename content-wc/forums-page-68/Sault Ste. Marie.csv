6588810,hoppy63,2021-08-10 16:51:00,367,Not one???
6588824,Windermere,2021-08-10 17:29:00,23,"Hoppy, Wait times have varied from 45 minutes to 4 hours. Guests that arrived today said the crossing was 2 1/2 hours. Everyone that has crossed coming to our camp said that everything went VERY smooth. All of our guest has shared with us that it was well worth making the trip even though it is a short trip for this week. Fishing reports from everyone is really good! Hope this helps and have a safe trip!"
6588858,hoppy63,2021-08-10 18:42:00,367,I appreciate the response. Did many or any get random? We are 30 hours out.....can't wait! Like others asked...if two people are traveling together do they both take test or is random by person as opposed to vehicle?
6588876,Windermere,2021-08-10 19:27:00,23,"Hoppy, Sorry, no one this week at our camp was chosen for the random test. After reading about some of the long wait times on the phone, all I can say is that we were very relieved especially since some our guests started with a short week to begin with. In closing, I do want to share HOW much I do appreciate the guests that did make the trip this week even though some could only stay 5 days of their week. Were hopeful that we will be able to give them an extra day next year just to show them some of our appreciation for there commitment of coming even for the shorten week!!"
