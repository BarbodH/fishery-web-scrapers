6588482,JAY221,2021-08-10 05:32:00,877,"Five in the box. I want to thank you for telling us about your experience at the crossing. Later, Jay"
6588492,djk50164,2021-08-10 05:52:00,370,Well I'm glad I didn't go yesterday! Looks like clear sailing today. Will see what it brings over the weekend. Thanks for all who shared there story and it looks like that test can be a pain in the butt.
6588494,pjshorthorn,2021-08-10 06:03:00,5654,"Right On !!! I would imagine that all of the stress of normal day life and crossing the border ,this year, just washed away when the US was in your rear view mirror. I look forward to that same feeling this fall. PjShorthorn"
6588546,ogilville,2021-08-10 07:43:00,262,Nice Picture!
6588956,Freytown,2021-08-11 06:21:00,770,Thanks for all the info posted on 72 hour testing. FT
6589082,Prairieboy43,2021-08-11 11:16:00,38,Update on border crossing fiasco. Good report from True North Reporter Candace Malcolm. Chaos at airports. Summary‚Ä¶ Work to rule unions members slowing everything down. Expect long waits 4+ hours. https://youtu.be/LpTeMB_j_PEhttps://youtu.be/LpTeMB_j_PE
6589100,phishfearme,2021-08-11 11:52:00,1242,you may want to hear what you want to hear - but the land crossing wait times are essentially back to normal. see:https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/bwt-taf/menu-eng.html this person is reporting old news - it may be accurate for monday but not now. biggest potential delay now is getting the random test but even that's getting to a reasonable time. phish
6589110,hoppy63,2021-08-11 12:44:00,367,Cheers üçª
6589118,Prairieboy43,2021-08-11 12:53:00,38,Good to hear. Now go Fishing.
6588330,djk50164,2021-08-09 16:09:00,370,I'm thinking that wait times are now incorrect. Using google maps with traffic and this morning and afternoon the line was backed up to rainer now it does not look that bad. I guess the only way we would know if someone was there.
6588332,reddemon2,2021-08-09 16:11:00,255,"Still showing 7+hrs on Canada border site, Updated at 15:57"
6588340,walleyecheek,2021-08-09 16:15:00,2231,"yeah my ""pee jug"" stand has been busy too !"
6588346,reddemon2,2021-08-09 16:20:00,255,"Who has the ""Honey Bucket"" stand?"
6588348,Skywagon,2021-08-09 16:20:00,1106,"I had friends that sat in line from 5:30 am and made it through at around 2:00 pm. Talked to someone in the bait shop this late morning, they sat in line from 12:00 last night until after 6:00 this morning. It was that bad."
6588350,djk50164,2021-08-09 16:22:00,370,Totally agree with you guys but in the last couple of hours the traffic has changed. Only someone there in line can verify my opinion. The boarder was so busy because many got in line way before it was going to open so instead of normal rush traffic it seen a 4 hour head start with people waiting in line. Also the MN dept of transportation do not show vehicles by rainer anymore.
6588358,Wallychowder,2021-08-09 16:37:00,1567,I think That Minnesota guy does ?
6588394,Eckohlt,2021-08-09 18:06:00,3685,"You making lemonade out of that?no real lemons but something with the same color,shame on you chow!!"
6588406,five in the box,2021-08-09 18:47:00,17,Totally worth the wait boys and girls! Not much questioning on Covid just basically if you feel ill. My test results were about or just expired and they didn‚Äôt question that.
6588424,BreezyPoint,2021-08-09 19:25:00,1581,So you would like to punish people who are not crossing the border. What a gentleman!Frank
6588222,C182P,2021-08-09 10:20:00,59,what was the line of questioning? Lots of COVID stuff? any foods they said you can't have? Potates? eggs? citrus?
6588224,walleyecheek,2021-08-09 10:21:00,2231,Crawlers ?
6588228,CiscoKid,2021-08-09 10:26:00,28,"I'm selling the idea to them as more time on the water fishing. I'm also going to pick up the tab on the duty free store! I'm fairly notorious for bad luck, so chances are i wouldn't be able to find a cab and I would have a 7 mile walk from the airport to the border bridge."
6588236,bbheli,2021-08-09 10:35:00,1387,"Someone posted a video on social media while driving and filming, it's crazy, the line is over 2 miles long and 7 in 10 vehicles have boats attached. When spoke to someone that has already waited 8 hours."
6588272,Guest,2021-08-09 12:30:00,0,Anyone try to cross at Baudette? The website listing crossing times does not include Baudette. Thanks.
6588284,valley366,2021-08-09 13:14:00,193,Trying to find the actual site with the guidance but I believe no bait is allowed this year. Live or otherwise.
6588302,Thunder Bay Walleye,2021-08-09 14:13:00,56,Video herehttps://www.tbnewswatch.com/local-ne...ossing-4204552
6588308,stjoeguy,2021-08-09 14:37:00,979,That video is depressing.
6588312,Wallychowder,2021-08-09 14:51:00,1567,Yeah i dont understand why there lined up on the shoulder ? Line up right on the highway i say !!!!
6588324,reddemon2,2021-08-09 15:57:00,255,My Lemonade stand has been very busy
6588190,C182P,2021-08-09 09:08:00,59,Those blue lagoons must be overflowing by now!
6588196,CiscoKid,2021-08-09 09:19:00,28,"Anyone have any information on if you can walk across the border in Fort Frances now (previous to COVID you were allowed to). I have this crazy idea as I am flying in on Saturday, but the rest of my party is driving. Instead of waiting for me at the airport, they could get in line, cross, then wait for me as I get a cab to drop me off at the border and I walk across on the other side. Could be disasterous if they are not allowing walk across crossing."
6588198,MikeAnkeny,2021-08-09 09:21:00,67,https://lb.511mn.org/mnlb/cameras/ca...textOnly=false Does one get in line east of town (International Falls)? Or can you get in line from the west side?
6588202,C182P,2021-08-09 09:25:00,59,East - towards Ranier
6588204,MikeAnkeny,2021-08-09 09:34:00,67,Thanks - only once before have I did that during the 4 PM hour on Saturday. Otherwise crossing 6 am or 8 pm is barely a wait in other years.
6588208,walleyecheek,2021-08-09 09:39:00,2231,Looks like they're backed up clear back to Orr MN.
6588212,C182P,2021-08-09 09:46:00,59,Sure hope this dies down in the next 24 hours. Can't imagine it lasting for much longer than that. If it does I'm rethinking going on Wednesday. a 7 plus hour wait doesn't interest me. Still waiting for someone to post what actual at the window time is and if they are handing out the random test kits.
6588214,bbheli,2021-08-09 10:00:00,1387,Privileged are awe ? get in the car and wait and pay the dues like your bro's! LOL
6588216,five in the box,2021-08-09 10:02:00,17,We just crossed. Total weight 7 hrs. Taking 5-8 min per vehicle. No COVID test given to us or sent with us.
6588218,MikeAnkeny,2021-08-09 10:13:00,67,Nohttps://lb.511mn.org/mnlb/cameras/ca...textOnly=false
6588082,RichA$1970,2021-08-09 05:54:00,1159,"It would be good to know how many have been turned around due to failure to comply- after the wait that would be a kick in the nuts. Good to know in case someone plans on catching a float plane to allow 6 hours additional for travel. Hopefully everyday they get more efficient, the mad rush settles down and they open up all 4 lanes vs. just 2."
6588084,bus33,2021-08-09 05:57:00,289,I‚Äôve probably seen 4 boats pulled back to US like they got turned around.
6588106,Guest,2021-08-09 06:37:00,0,"Does anyone know if they will accept a negative COVID test result that has expired while you were in line? Thanks. We expect to go Tuesday, have allowed 4 hrs in line, hope that's enough!"
6588130,JAY221,2021-08-09 07:11:00,877,How are you holding up bus33?
6588138,five in the box,2021-08-09 07:27:00,17,We‚Äôve been in line at FF since 3:35 am. Very slow moving line. I can almost see the toll shack for the bridge.
6588148,bbheli,2021-08-09 07:41:00,1387,News outlets in real time are not reporting 7+ hours to cross at Ft Francis.
6588152,'Taterguy,2021-08-09 07:47:00,33,LEG BAG! Thanks for all the updates. I don't cross until September. Many thanks to the intrepid travelers who are blazing the path and sharing their experiences. Good luck to all.
6588154,walleyecheek,2021-08-09 07:47:00,2231,dont forget there still working without a contract !
6588156,walleyecheek,2021-08-09 07:56:00,2231,I wonder if anyone thought about setting up porta potties along the parade route ?
6588168,five in the box,2021-08-09 08:12:00,17,They do have a couple porta potties along the way in FF. Lot of people peeing between the paper trailers too. The gas stations are #1 in the #2 business though.
6588050,bus33,2021-08-09 03:53:00,289,Update‚Ä¶..4 1/2 hours in line and I would say 4 to go. The Canada border wait time website says 4‚Ä¶that‚Äôs not accurate. I-Falls
6588052,djk50164,2021-08-09 03:58:00,370,thanks for the updates sounds like a place I would not like to be right now.
6588056,troutwater,2021-08-09 04:18:00,299,The wait time is currently listed at 6 hours at Fort Frances.....bring a jug to pee into lol
6588060,JAY221,2021-08-09 04:37:00,877,"I wish I was in line with you guys! Thanks for reporting. Later, Jay"
6588062,BCNeal,2021-08-09 04:39:00,19,Ouch!
6588064,Skywagon,2021-08-09 04:40:00,1106,"Buss33: What is your current physical location? I just talked to a friend who is just getting ready to leave his motel (in I Falls) to get in line, thanks to your update I told him to prepare, including Troutwater's suggestion of the pee jug."
6588068,bus33,2021-08-09 04:50:00,289,"We just paid our toll. I heard from a truck that went through that there are only 2 of 4 check stations open. It is 5:49 AM now‚Ä¶going on 6 hours in line. There are people in line whose 72 hour covid test window ran out.For those of you headed up in the future, I would schedule your covid test as close to your arrival time as you can. I don‚Äôt know if the line will always be this bad but allow for the line and any potential breakdowns. You don‚Äôt want to be in line and have your 72 hour window run out."
6588070,mswope13,2021-08-09 04:53:00,73,"Been in line at I-Falls since 3:30. From walking up to the bridge, looks like an 8 hour wait to get up to the agents. Move 100‚Äô in 30 minutes."
6588072,Bstar,2021-08-09 05:09:00,564,Border Wait Times is showing FF at 6 hours! That's crazy! Hopefully this is an initial inrush that will relax over time. Hope it calms down by Thursday afternoon. I wonder how Grand Portage or Baudette are?
6588078,JAY221,2021-08-09 05:38:00,877,"Remember it is NOT just us fishermen but people that get to go see family and friends for the first time in a long time. I don‚Äôt know if you could tell but has anybody seen or been denied entry? Later, Jay"
6587898,MN_Moose,2021-08-08 11:06:00,964,Who's going to be the first to cross the Canada border? report your experience and recommendations
6587906,bus33,2021-08-08 11:42:00,289,Leaving home is 2 hours ..will be there at midnight God help me!
6587908,MikeAnkeny,2021-08-08 11:51:00,67,"D-day! Never was so much owed by so many to so few. Thanks first wave, we will come after you secure the beach."
6587912,lassh,2021-08-08 12:06:00,553,Good Luck and have a great trip!
6587916,JAY221,2021-08-08 12:17:00,877,"Please post a short report of your experience crossing. I wish you the best of luck. I will follow in less than 2 weeks!! Later, Jay"
6587918,hoppy63,2021-08-08 12:31:00,367,Good luck. We are about 84 hours away.
6587920,hoppy63,2021-08-08 12:35:00,367,Which crossing will you be using? Any and all info will be appreciated. We will be crossing at the soo. Will report our experience asap once across.....I hope!
6587938,BreezyPoint,2021-08-08 14:40:00,1581,Crossing in Baudette at noon tomorrow. Will post about experience.Frank
6587948,troutwater,2021-08-08 15:32:00,299,"I'm not in the first wave, but I'm crossing Tuesday afternoon/evening"
6588036,bus33,2021-08-08 23:59:00,289,Got in in line at International Falls at 11pm‚Ä¶..line is at least a mile long. We are advancing one car length every 10 minutes. At this rate I will get across at day break‚Ä¶.maybe.
