Also I read somewhere where it tells you to not bring anything that will require you to have to go in to pay duty....in my case, beer. Has this caused anyone heartaches since the border re-opened that may have brought anything in that would require you to have to pay duty?? Thanks in advance for any replies."
6589068,Wallychowder,2021-08-11 10:34:00,1567,"your still allowed 5 cases per person, and yes you will have to go in and pay the extra duty on 4 of them . The first day they were recommending not coming in the office."
