1470837,DaBullz,2012-08-05 12:45:00,12,"I have fished Lac Seul several times so I am familiar with traveling to Canada. The camp I stay at isn't geared to host a family; it is truly a fishing-only camp (which I love about it.)I am taking my family to Lake Wabaskang. The camp has some land, a swing, a beach, kayaks and so on. We should have a great time as a family - we won't be intensely fishing day in/day out.However, we will fish daily. So, if anyone has any tips on fishing Wabaskang, I'd appreciate it. We will fish primarily for walleye. Yet my one son in particular is hungry to catch as many species as he can so he'd like to spend some time fishing for lake trout, muskie, and smallies.Thanks!"
1470840,shortmag,2012-08-05 12:52:00,70,Was there 2 weeks ago. We concluded that 1/8 oz orange and chartruese jigs with a minnow was the most successful. Walleyes were in cabbage and mid-lake humps 14-16 fow. Listen to the owner for update. Good Luck!
1470846,go dart,2012-08-05 13:08:00,77,Thats a great lake and people on this board really like the lodges. I do not believe they have Muskie in it though.
1471473,Guest,2012-08-06 19:40:00,0,Incorrect statement about Musky in the Wabby. I have a 51 inch 37 pound reproduction on the wall from a trip in 2010. Caught it at the base of Perrault Falls in front of Gawleys casting for smallmouth bass. Truly the catch of a lifetime. I stay at the same camp the original post is going to stay at.

We fish the east tip and troll counter-clockwise to the north end. Especially when the sun sets and the shadows fall onto the water. Peffley's has the best lake map available: http://www.peffleyscamp.com/images/wabaskanglakemap.pdf. In the summer we have caught lakers fishing with frozen ciscoes on the bottom in Aerobus bay. The narrows by Sleepy Dog is a good place for smallies. Good luck - Stu"
