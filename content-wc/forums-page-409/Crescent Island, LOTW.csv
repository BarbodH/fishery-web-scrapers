1475032,stillangling,2012-08-15 05:48:00,149,His name is Brager. John Brager I believe. He has another place on the lake that is close by...not quite as opulent though. It sure looks like someone bit off more than they can chew!

We have never ventured up by Crescent Island. Next time up I want to just to take a look at that place, plus fish new water."

I did hear the logs may have been shipped from B.C., I'm thinking g they would have $500k(at least) into the boat house, cabin at te point it's at maybe $4m?? The logs on the bottom that make up part of the deck have benches carved into them and eagle heads carved into the end of that log. It's unreal, I walked around te whole place but can't get a peek inside, I have to see the inside!! It's too cool. Dclhomes"

The huge boat house sits unfinished! I walked around the cabin the log work is unreal. Anybody know what happened? It's been like this now for 3 years! Thanks, dclhomes"

1474524,TinmanDon,2012-08-13 20:23:00,194,"Either way it's a beautiful cabin and a real shame that no one uses it, I would sure love to use it"

1474586,Guest,2012-08-14 05:53:00,0,"It is west of Yellow Girl bay, almost to Wileys point. So it is midlake or just above."
1474755,MN_Moose,2012-08-14 12:20:00,964,I was told by a local guide it was owned and being built by a contractor from Nebraska. As the construction economy constricted he reduced his spend. It's quite a place. Spectacular view of the south west.
1474758,cbprov,2012-08-14 12:27:00,1010,"I drove bye that place on the way fishing on saturday ,all i can say is wow it is nice ,you would think any body that had that much $ to build the place could finish it ,it is almost done by the looks of it ,anybody looked inside house through windows"
1474760,cbprov,2012-08-14 12:33:00,1010,"here is a picture ,boat house is large and matching look as cabin"
