Used to be Verne with Slate Falls Outposts and now it is John. Both did a nice job. We stayed on-site at the bunkhouse before they flew us out.Also, have now been to Onaway Lodge on Lac Seul. I can't say I have ever seen nicer cabins. He has been replacing them over the last few years and they are gorgeous. Great fish cleaning facility and docks. Ice machine etc. We used their boats and were very pleased. Very comfortable big padded swivel seats, flat floors and nice motors. We could do about 26mph via GPS. We had been struggling ot get 4 or so guys for a fly-in last year so we tried the drive in camp at Onaway. We got 10 guys and this year have 12 and almost had 16 people liked it so much and told the others who had gone in the past. Have fun. Oh, and this site is great for information because a website isn't always accurate."
1474241,sdhusker,2012-08-13 09:35:00,187,"I'm just starting to do some groundwork toward putting together a trip up north next year. The farthest I have been is the NW Angle of LOTW, so this is a whole new ball game for me and I don't know where to begin. I'd like to take my father-in-law and brothers-in-law on a great fishing trip, and I thought I would seek advice from the experts. We're probably not ready to do a fly-in just yet, but I've done boat-in trips before that were pretty great. I'd like to be somewhere with decent cabins and boats that we can use so I don't have to tow mine up there. I think we would pack food and try to do our own cooking to save on expense. Primary species we would be looking for is walleye, but I like to spend some time going after smallmouth. Any recommendations come to mind?"
1474244,Hump,2012-08-13 09:45:00,578,"Good walleye, not many smallies. The camp is very nice and clean, great facilities. The boats are outstanding, 18.5 and wide with electric start 60 horse engines."
1474249,Gregking,2012-08-13 09:54:00,2658,"I just got back last night from my second trip this year to witchbay camps. They have great cabins with ac and heaters. They have a ton of camp boats, 17 ft i believe (i bring my own). They nicest people I have ever dealt with. Example: My brother and I broke both our brand new digital scales trying to weigh a 42"" northern my dad caught. We went in for lunch and told them our experience. By supper I had a new scale sitting on my plate when I walked in. I said put it on my bill. They said if you don't want it we will keep it ourselves. I told them this was perfect. They have guides as part of the camp program that will take you out to fish or can mark on a map what ever you are hunting for.They do however cook meals for you so you can spend more time on the water.Everyone there is so nice, you do however find a$$holes fishing guys who have to blame their lack of fishing on the bait the dock boys got for you. There is no need for nonsense like that.They have internet and cable TV at the community building if you need that.I caught a ton of bass last week while fishing for walleyes. They also have Northern and Muskie if you are wanting that. You also get your own reserved dock so you can put tackle or rods on the dock that you won't use that day. I hope you look into it as this is one of those places that is literally set up for you to fish as much as possible. Also they will set you up with shore lunch or sandwiches if you choose. If you want to make you own sandwiches to cut down of $ I would talk with Gail, she is wonderful to work with. I also believe there is a 10% discount if you book after like Aug 26th but I am not 100% sure on that date.Hope this helpshttp://www.witchbay.com/"
1474250,mroyle,2012-08-13 09:56:00,74,"Ghost River Camp....boat in. Nice cabins, boats, & several lakes to fish. Lotsa Walleye. They offer housekeeping as well as American Plan."
1474268,tv4fish,2012-08-13 10:31:00,2694,I have to recommend Red Pine Lodge (located just south of Sioux Lookout). You would have walleye and smallmouth fishing right on Minnitaki and Abram lakes with access to Lac Seul (if you want to boat a little ways). Very nice modern and reasonable cabins. We do the housekeeping plan as well. Must be a reason why we've been going there since 1985. You will be treated well.
1474285,NARDA 1,2012-08-13 11:09:00,636,"Check out www.birchdalelodge.com they have what you are looking for. You can call the owners, Cheryl & Marcel Pinette at 807-227-5262 with any questions. There are also several posts here on Walleye Central about Birch Dale. You can also send me a personal message if you like. Terry"
1474286,wallydave,2012-08-13 11:09:00,2151,"www.lacseul.comCheck out Goose Bay, nice boat upgrades, cabins and service! I have fished out of this camp since the late 90's, each year you can see the improvements to the docks, cabins and I really like the 17.5 Lund outfitters!"
1474287,Steve Ediger,2012-08-13 11:11:00,97,"Give Rod & Lorita a Call at Lac Seul Lodge. The camp is very comfortable and clean. They have housekeeping cabins for 2 to 10 people and they also have two outpost camps if you are interested. The walleye fishing is great and at the right time of year you can catch a lot of 16"" - 20"" smallies. All their boats are Lunds with Yamaha motors. I think you would enjoy your stay."
1474323,Bitinlight,2012-08-13 12:25:00,95,It's worth looking at www.lacseuloutposts.com
1474328,Mike Kansas,2012-08-13 12:43:00,1463,Steve said it all. Great place to go. been going there 28 yrs and this year our group of 8 caught 2700 Walleye in 5 days and a bunch of nice Smallies. Go before the middle of June and Smallies will be on the banks. Mike Kansas
