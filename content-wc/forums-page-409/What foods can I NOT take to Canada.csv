1475105,MrSimon,2012-08-15 08:36:00,922,"Thank you, this was prefect. I love to ""buy local"", and do it all the time. But, Canada isn't local to me. I'd much rather support MY local farmers and take that stuff with me on my trip. From reading the link, it looks like I can't take potatoes over. It also looks like we are limited to 50 cigars, one case of beer, and 40oz of liquor .... duty taxes get charged on any overages. No problem, we'll just stop up there and get potatoes and booze."
1475157,SinOrSwim,2012-08-15 10:45:00,1528,"Pay the tax/duty on the booze and take it with you. Over the years we have found this to be cheaper. In addition, their BEER Stores have very unfriendly hours. Wouldn't want to get there and the store is closed. Not like the states where you can buy all that stuff at a convenience store.Just take it across, declare to them what you have and pay the tax.Just my 2 cents"
1475294,MorganMan,2012-08-15 17:25:00,341,"I do believe you can take a case of beer (#24 12oz cans) OR a liter of booze per person, not both?"
1475303,Bill Krejca,2012-08-15 17:44:00,6107,"So..... Now we are again here on the ""Potato Standard"" rule, that is, after several years, supposedly, of being able to again bring in the spuds, it is once more forbidden? It seems there have been more WC posts on this subject than favorite bait, twisted line, I-Pilot, et al. Can we? Can't we? Maybe? Bill Krejca"
1475332,retire55,2012-08-15 18:52:00,1029,"I was just trying to address the question ""Are there any food items that are not allowed into Canada?"" by providing the reference. On the content of the reference - I made no comments."
1475465,Guest,2012-08-16 07:40:00,0,No you can't bring marijuana even if you have a medical card. Most guides can hook you up though!
1475470,geareng,2012-08-16 07:49:00,335,Regarding potatoes........ I called the boarder control before going up to LOTW this year and this is what I was told. Each individual is allowed to bring a max of 10# of potatoes. The catch is they have to be in the original packaging from the store that lists the state of origin on it. You cannot just take a bag of potatoes in a paper sack.
1475472,Bill Krejca,2012-08-16 07:52:00,6107,"Sorry if I sounded ungrateful for the info, I'm also heading back up in a month, and I was quite surprised with the apparent turnabout in the potato rule. Those of us going up are appreciative of the news that we still cannot, or cannot again bring in potatoes. I'll just plan on buying them in Ontario. Thanks for the latest. Bill Krejca"

1474648,MrSimon,2012-08-14 08:02:00,922,We leave for Ontario in less than two weeks. Are there any food items that are not allowed into Canada?
1474654,TIGHTLINER,2012-08-14 08:21:00,223,WE ARE ALWAYS ASK ABOUT CITRUS FRUITS AND THEY HAVE TAKEN ORANGES AND LIMES FROM US. APPLES WERE OK THIS LAST TIME WE WENT OVER THE BORDER SEVERAL YEARS AGO THEY TOOK THOSE. THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH TALK OF TATERS. THE LAST TIME I WENT ACROSS THEY SAID THEY WERE OK HOWEVER SEVERAL YEARS AGO ALSO NO UNLESS THEY WERE IN THE ORIGINAL BAG YOU BOUGHT THEM IN. DO A SEARCH FOR POSTS ON WC THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF POSTS ON YOUR SUBJECT.
1474680,Radnine,2012-08-14 09:29:00,141,Would you carry coal to Newcastle? NO!Buy local! Farmers markets are in full swing.Jim
1474689,LOW1,2012-08-14 09:56:00,2828,"Jim's right re produce. Last week we bought superb produce at several farmer's markets. Especially good were cool weather crops such as radishes and cucumbers which are out of season in the midwest. And because of the drought Ontario sweet corn was better than Iowa sweet corn. I never thought I would see that.Bring up staples such as oil, ketchup, butter, pasta, potatoes, onions, cheese, seasonings, beef, hot dogs, brats, milk, etc.If you drive through Cook MN stop at Zup's Supermarket for deli meats."
1474696,retire55,2012-08-14 10:10:00,1029,Official information on what foods you can bring into Canada can be found at http://www.canadawelcomesyou.net/faq.html
1474881,MorganMan,2012-08-14 16:59:00,341,"I don't think most of us would argue buying local, but it's more about packing and making as few stops as possible in our case. For many in our group, it's quite a long trip (2 days) to even get up there and anything that can be gotten ahead of time is greatly appreciated by them. What a drag it was to have everything you needed and had to stop for a flippin bag of potatoes when you are flying in. Only my opinion.....but I do love some good corn!"
1474936,Golden Eagle,2012-08-14 19:17:00,2642,"I went up alone in October 2009 and bought 5 dozen ears of the best sweetcorn I've ever eaten. Got it 8 miles south of International Falls from a farming operation. I was the only fisherman in camp that week. The camp owner, his son and I enjoyed plenty of fried walleyes and boiled sweetcorn. Haven't seen any corn for sale since then. Farmers are making better money putting corn in gasoline tanks.At the border I've never been asked if I had potatoes."
1474978,wallydave,2012-08-14 21:11:00,2151,It would not be illegal but it might cause an international incident if you tried to bring in some frozen fishsticks??!!
1475088,SinOrSwim,2012-08-15 07:57:00,1528,You can not bring in the leafy vegetable known as Cannabis. Or is a dried spice like basil?????Either way you can't take it.
1475093,jimirjr,2012-08-15 08:10:00,1149,"Brings up the QUESTION? What if You have a ""medicinal marijuana card"" from the U.S.? Will Canadian customs allow You In?Has anyone ever tried this?"
