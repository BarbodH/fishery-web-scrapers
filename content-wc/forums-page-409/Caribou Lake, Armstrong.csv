Have studied a map, but the map gives no information regarding depth. Would be interested in any information about fishing this lake in August. I presume that I will be best off looking in 20+ feet of water for the walleyes."
1474492,drew59,2012-08-13 19:29:00,87,We go to Forrest Lodge in June and September. Last year we found most of our walleyes in 30 - 50 feet during the latter part of Sept.. Use your locator to look for fish and MOVE if you don't see them. For trout we jig 1 oz jigs and troll Rapala Tail Dancer's that dive to 30' with super line ($10 a piece. Ouch!). Caibou is a great lake because it is remote but you can drive to it. Have fun! Give me a report when you return. This year we will be there the first week of Sept..
