We have always fished East of Soiux Lookout in the past, but want to complete a bucket list item of fishing Lac Seul.We will probably find the walleyes deep and Northerns close by, maybe even get lucky with a musky or two. After forty five years in a boat its about time to hit Lac Seul.There will be a full report posted for our members upon our return the 28th fo Aug."

1474081,go dart,2012-08-12 21:37:00,77,Hey Limey what depth are you fishing this time of year?
1474150,Limeyangler,2012-08-13 06:39:00,563,"Deep for me. 25' _40'. But that's just my preference. I'd say they can be found at most depths this time of year......I do equally well on some windswept shorelines in 15'-8' row.......I need to expand my repetoire of presentations but do good on jigs with minnows, I rarely try anything different."
1474489,Mudpuippy,2012-08-13 19:22:00,23,"Limeangler, We like to experiment to find out what is working, homemade spinner riggs, floating jigs and walking sinkers, traditional jigs, three way riggs with crank baits ect.ect.We are really looking for big northerns, few eater wlleyes, a musky maybe. Spent 40 years chasing muskies in wisconsin (boated over 300), enjoy other fishing lately, especially big pike. June is reserved for big walleyes.Loking forward to NE Lac Seul.Mudpuippy"
