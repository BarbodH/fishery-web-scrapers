I am wondering which is better: jigging in current areas or deeper open water reefs? Does either of these areas tend to produce more numbers or bigger fish? I haven't jigged the deeper reefs much mainly due to LOTS of wind the past few years and the guys I go with are soft. That and boat control for me is much easier out of the 3-5 foot waves. I am not looking for specific spots, but what do you guys look for on maps when targeting September walleyes? I have been mainly focusing on neck down areas with current and deeper (25-35 feet) water. Thanks for your advice.Bones"

I mostly fish Ptarmigan Bay all the way east to the main lake south of Kenora as far south as Wiley Point. I very seldom jig unless I find very active fish holding tight to a reef or drop off. What I mostly do is pull bottom bouncers with either spinners (Tommy Harris blades) with leeches, grub tails or even swim baits. I also pull crawlers on a crawler harness with blades or spin n glow. Another very effective technique is slow death with plastic worms, pink to be exact. Walleyes on LOTW love pink. These techniques allow you to cover more water in an effort to locate active fish. Pulling cranks is also an effective method. Jigging for me is often a last resort."
