At the end of the week I am going on a trip to the north end LaVerendrye Park. I will be driving up through Ottawa, 105 etc. Is there anyplace where on can buy bulk leeches along this route? Any help is greatly appreciated. If anyone has a fishing report from up there that would be great also.Great forum!"
1116056,Seanik,2009-06-24 09:16:00,218,"Dbldeuce, We usually get our leeches by the pound at this bait shop in Gatineau, it's 7 miles 1 way off Rt.105 but worth the time. Atelier du Pecher phone (819) 669-8700 on LaBrossee Blvd has been our best buy at around 42.00 per lb. It's best to call ahead and place an order, there is also a bank near the bait shop thats a good place to exchange US dollars for Canadian. At the North end of Maniwaki there is a gas station that sells bait, leeches were 4.25 per dozen last time through. We will be at a Lake 65 miles Northeast of Senneterre the 2nd week of Aug. Good luck and I hope this helps, Seanik"
1116088,dbldeuce,2009-06-24 11:22:00,4,Thank you for the quick responce! It is greatly appreciated. I was hoping to find them in bulk. Now to see if I can shift my driving schedule to be in Ottawa during buisness hours. Do you happen to know what their hours are?Thanks again!
1119955,waterlily,2009-07-10 10:46:00,1,I thought it was illegal to fish with leeches in Quebec?? Is this why the reservoirs in La Verendrye seem leeche infested? because of fishing?
1119968,McQ,2009-07-10 11:56:00,615,"The information in above post is not up to date. L'Atelier de Pecheur has been closed for 2 years now and the bank has moved. Your best bet for leeches in the Ottawa/Gatineau area is: Rendez-vous du Pecheur 1071 Jacques Cartier Gatineau, Quebec Ph (819) 561-4276 0r 2275 The shop is on the Ottawa river and is also accessible from Hwy 50."
