We have arranged for a guide for the first day but any advice you can offer concerning Perrault Lake and early fall walleyes would be appreciated."
1474532,go dart,2012-08-13 20:50:00,77,Hey Port I'm going to Perrault next week and will be happy to post how we did. We're not staying at Montauk but the lakes the same. I'm sure we'll spend a fair amount of time in Cedar also. Good luck.
1474615,bigdaddyguns,2012-08-14 07:11:00,608,"Port, We were up at Perrault two weeks ago and the walleyes were on a typical summer pattern holding on mid-lake humps/reefs and main lake points. We also found fish shallow 8-10 feet of water at cabbage weed edges of some wind-blown shorelines. Our most productive presentation was a jig and leech though we did catch a fair number on bottom bouncer/spinner rigs tipped with a leech. Crankbaits like shad raps and salmos also took fish. Perch, gold, and copper/bronze were the more effective color patterns. Speedwise, jig/leech combo was best at 0.3-0.5 MPH, spinner rigs 0.7-1.2MPH and crankbaits 1.5-2.2 MPH. The lake has an abundant population of smallmouth and we caught many. We found the smallmouth to be just on top of the walleyes. If we were catching them we would work a bit deeper and get back into walleye. If you want to target smallies try fishing tubes or drop shotting a 4-5"" plastic worm for plenty of action. Targeted northern pike a few times but did not catch anything of size. The one 30"" slot pike we caught was on a jig and leech fishing for walleye in 35' of water. The remainder were in the low-mid 20 inch range. The bigger pike were probably down deep feeding on the deeper water forage base but did not have time to try there. Finally talk with the guide and lodge owner, they should know what locations are holding/producing fish at that time. Have a great trip."
