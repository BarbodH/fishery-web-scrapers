1475020,IA JOE,2012-08-15 04:51:00,35,My father Purchased the Elite-5 DSI Gold and it has a 2GB Nav. SD Card w/ 125 Canada Lakes. It isn't set up yet. Is Lac Seul on that SC Card? With th 30 pages of manuals it looks complexe to operate. Any idea on how well this unit works? On auto? All input is welcome.
