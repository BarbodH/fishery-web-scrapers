Very good walleye and pike fishing with an occasional laker, perch or whitefish. There are MONSTER pike in the lake (along with the hammer handles). We fished O'Sullivan for 7 years in a row before switching to a fly in lake. We always stayed at O'Sullivan Lake Outfitters and not O'Sullivan Rainbow. The first time we went to book the lake we tried with Rainbow...but they were booked full. We never went back...stayed with O'Sullivan Outfitters. The lodge is not as convenient to the lake...about 1 mile up the river from the lake. Howard and Elsie Meshake run that lodge and not sure you will find any nicer people. One advantage of being up the river was the ability to fish on real windy days and the proximity to the river mouth that nearly always produced the largest eyes for the week. Another benefit with staying with O'Sullivan Lake Outfitters is the ability to go to Hanover lake, a lake that they have boats and motors on for some awesome pike fishing. It is a 15 minute drive (by car) for some great pike fishing. Good Luck and good fishing."

1474988,Guest,2012-08-14 21:35:00,0,"I fished O'Sullivan's for several years. Bob and Shelley are good people and run an excellent operation. Fishing has always been good with wide variety available depending on conditions and time of year. reasonably priced, and a good value. Pierce B"
1136817,Guest,2009-09-18 19:21:00,0,Has anyone very fished O'Sullivans Rainbow lodge. looking for a lodge in the Nakina area thats is a drive in and semi private. I know fly-in lakes are better but I enjoy my own boat too much. O'Sullivan looks very nice with alot of islands. Any advice would be appreciated.

1140434,birddogger,2009-10-06 13:05:00,43,"Great place to go, nice owners, fishing is awesome was up there in August with a group of 20 guys, caught nice size walleye, northern, alot of islands. Has 9 cabins, this is the only resort on the lake. Even has an outpost cabin that sleeps 8.. alot of fun!!"
1146836,celticbass1,2009-11-06 18:58:00,67,O'Sullivans Rainbow Lodge is absolutely top notch. The owners are VERY friendly and customer oriented. If you are looking for seclusion the only cabin they have is Dunn's Island and it is full for the 2010 season. The cabins at the main lodge are MUCH nicer there is running water in them and they are much better maintained than Dunn's Island but we really enjoyed the Island. The fishing was INCREDIBLE when we were there in the second week of July 2008with many 4 and 5 pound walleye caught every day. We had a group of four guys so two boats and each boat had two seperate 100 fish days. It's true that there is only one resort on the lake but there is a resort called O'Sullivan Lake Outfitters on a river that feed in to the lake so it's not like you will be alone on the water but understand that this is a HUGE body of water and I would be surprised if we saw more than two or three boats each day we were out and they were never in our way. I would highly recommend this body of water and we are going back this year. Hope this info helps if you need any additional info send me a message.
1147086,Mr Ranger,2009-11-08 19:37:00,272,I agree with all. Great spot. Have been up five years and every year is better than the previous year. Love the lake trout option. You would not be disappointed. Have seen lots of guys brining their own boats. Good luck
1210181,Putzer5,2010-06-14 21:12:00,11,Going to O'Sullivans Rainbow 7/24/2010. We have been going there for 17 years. Would appreciate any reports prior to our trip. I am very familiar with the lake and would be willing to share information with anyone new to the lake.
1210912,dhead,2010-06-17 06:24:00,2,Donny said you said 19 years. Guess he can't read either. I'm ready to go fishingDhead
1211935,IRISHATTACK,2010-06-21 04:27:00,44,"Any big pike in this lake, or just the occasional hook up??"
1211981,Bill Krejca,2010-06-21 07:54:00,6107,"We have never targeted pike. I can't remember hooking any large ones, would venture to say there are better lakes nearby for pike trophies. This is not all bad, as you experience very few bite-offs while pulling in the nice walleyes, I hardly ever use a leader. Bill Krejca"
1212026,dhead,2010-06-21 09:25:00,2,I'm also going the same time you are. Be sure to bring enough lighters !!dhead
