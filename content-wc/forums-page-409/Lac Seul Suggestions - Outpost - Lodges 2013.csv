Considering different lodges or preferably outpost. More familiar with the south east and north east sections of the lake. We are used to being on our own, whether doing a fly-in or the houseboat. Considering Lac Seul Outposts, but again would probably prefer a smaller camp, or singular outpost. Any thoughts / suggestions? Thanks."
1474733,Mike Kansas,2012-08-14 11:36:00,1463,Check with Lac Seul Lodge. They have two great Outposts. Black Bay & Sunlight. We have been going to Black Bay for 28 years and this year 8 of us boated 2700 Walleye there in 5 1/2 days.
1474748,SinOrSwim,2012-08-14 12:06:00,1528,"We went into Sunlight last year and am unsure of water levels as it was our first trip to LS. But, it was not easy getting back in there. If the water levels are down, it might be impossible? We were going through mud a couple times. We followed a guide who had already been booked. They said there was a big drop off or sink hole of sorts. We criss crossed that thing for a long time and never found it? We had okay luck but nothing great."
1474775,Mike Kansas,2012-08-14 13:37:00,1463,What time of year did you go to Sunlight?
1474781,SinOrSwim,2012-08-14 13:46:00,1528,"We were there the very end of September. They said all the big ones head to Sunlight in the fall???? Then, again the guide didn't stay there long. LOL We a cool drive back in there though and had a good shore lunch. Very end of September and hotter than a %&*$^%^$*$!!!! yowza!"
1474809,Mike Kansas,2012-08-14 14:41:00,1463,"Sunlight is a heavy spawning area. It as always produced the best the first three weeks of the season. I have heard that ""THE BIG ONES"" are there in the fall but I have nothing to back that up other than rumor. I can attest to some great early season fishing because I have been in Sunlight when it happened. Lac Seuls Black Bay Outpost has been a great producer for us for 28 years. There is enough varied depths and structure in that area to allow fish to hold the entire season. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1474884,WalleyeWally28,2012-08-14 17:15:00,298,If you would still prefer a houseboat you might check with Whitewing Resort. They have two houseboats that are piloted to and tied up in the Altimeter Creek area. That puts you right in the middle of the best fishing areas in the NW and SW sections of Lac Seul.www.whitewingresort.com
