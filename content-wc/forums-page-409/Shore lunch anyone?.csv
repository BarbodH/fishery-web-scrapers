1473702,micropterus,2012-08-11 18:45:00,450,A Must
1473802,Sidge61,2012-08-12 07:35:00,59,I like it simple but yummy!!!!
1474883,MorganMan,2012-08-14 17:02:00,341,"Sidge61, are those deep fried potatoes??"
1474938,Glenman12,2012-08-14 19:30:00,762,there you go Sidge..thats exactly how I want my plate to look up in Canada..when Im home at a restaurant I want it to look like Limey's
1474939,Glenman12,2012-08-14 19:33:00,762,not sure if they are but we deep fry ours for about 5 mins before they go into the skillet with the onions..double the cholesterol!!..j/k..it just speeds up the frying process..
1475083,Sidge61,2012-08-15 07:52:00,59,Those were canned whole white potatoes (sliced) I fried in lard with onions. Funny no one has said what the tarter sauce resembles. I was not done on purpose but a friend noticed it.
1475295,MorganMan,2012-08-15 17:33:00,341,LOLOLOL.....nice work
1470833,Limeyangler,2012-08-05 12:36:00,563,"Hi All,Just thought i'd throw this suggestion out there as i thought it might be a nice change/variation/addition to traditional shore lunch since the ingredients would be easy to pack. I have been experimenting with variations on Walleye tacos and have found a combination of ingredients and way to fry my fish that i'm happy with. Fresh walleye, thinly sliced, coated in my own breading mix. My wife makes a fresh basil bruschetta salsa and we add a variety of toppings including, Fresh Italian parsley, Capers, Black Olives, Shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano, Taco Sauce, Sour Cream, Red Peppers, Lettuce, Avocados(sliced thin), Red Onions, Greek Pepperoncini and fresh lemon and lime wedges for juice.Of course you can add what you like but here is a picture of the ones I made last week for our fishfry."
1470834,rnnonmt,2012-08-05 12:42:00,992,"That looks way too nice to eat! I'll be up in June of next year.... Do you have a luch special Menu? By the way, nice video that you posted of your boy fishing. It puts a big smile on a Dad's face I'm sure. Been taking my older boy to Lac Seul for 4 years in a row now. My younger boy (6) has a couple years to go before I know that he can stay in a boat all day without vapor locking. Take care"
1470891,octanehi5,2012-08-05 15:13:00,1104,"It sounds like a great shore lunch for a drive to fishing spot . way to many things for a restricked weight fly in. 100 lbs per is not alot of food and gear.Shore lunch at my camp is beer battered walleye cooked in hot peanut oil,along with home fries, And Blue"
1471464,MorganMan,2012-08-06 19:26:00,341,"Wow, that is quite the presentation. Looks like a great option, lot of ingredients though. Plus, I will need your wife's salsa sent to us! I'm sure it was as good as it looks."
1471521,Glenman12,2012-08-06 21:08:00,762,"no offense intended cause that looks great..but when I have shorelunch in Canada I want it to look like shore lunch..fillets, fried potatoes and onions and some baked beans..JMHO.. but that is something I might try when I got back.."
1471545,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-06 22:58:00,235,Looks tasty minus the olives (I'm not an olive fan). I might suggest experimenting with the sauce I mentioned in the walleye tacos thread. I found it online and it is a perfect combination of tangy meets spicy. But I will try this one some time. Can you share your breading mixture?
1471547,Limeyangler,2012-08-06 23:13:00,563,Sure can share my breading mixture.........http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66svEf3n_gA
1471988,MorganMan,2012-08-07 19:18:00,341,"That was fun to watch, thanks!"
1472113,ohiojmj,2012-08-08 06:18:00,1262,"Wow, nice looking meal. In my ""simple is better"" approach, my shore visit on Canada trips consists of a 12"" cold cut sub sandwich, a couple cold ones, and a few feet of TP. We fry our fish in the cabin."
1472121,MrSimon,2012-08-08 06:40:00,922,"That looks DELICIOUS .... and something I would totally order .... at a fancy restaurant But for my group of crusty dudes who love to fish, this is about as good as it gets."
