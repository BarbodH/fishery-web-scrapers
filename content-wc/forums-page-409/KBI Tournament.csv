Morson has 3 of the top 8 boats in the tournament. Good luck out there! The Gustafsons had a MONSTER 20 LB bag yesterday, which vaulted them to the #1 position."

BUT... they have very nice high quality vids of fishing exploits on Uncut Angling. Apparently when saying a word on accepting first place at the KBI their message to the kids and following their dreams was that you don't need a fancy boat to enter big tournaments."
