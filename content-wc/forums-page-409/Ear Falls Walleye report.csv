The bite was on every day and we mainly focused on the 15'-23' foot range. Water temps averaged 73 degrees. 1/4-3/8 oz. jigs tipped with minnows. We've never caught as many Pike as we did this trip fishing for eyes. Released all fish 18"" and up and there were plenty of them!No broken props, never ran out of gas, shore lunches were fatening, and NO computers or cell phones, cards at night, life is good.Retirement can't come soon enough, too bad I have another 20 years"

1474467,mswope13,2012-08-13 18:30:00,73,We stayed at Evergreen Lodge with Pat and Gary. What great hospitality and incredible facilities. Cabins are neat and clean and the boats are 2nd to none. We had our best luck in the Steamboat area just a 30 minute boat ride SE of the lodge.
