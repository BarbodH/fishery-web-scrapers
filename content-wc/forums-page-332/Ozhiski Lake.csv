523884,Eric,2002-08-29 12:51:00,114,Our group has been flying to Oshiski from Pickle Lake Outposts the past couple of years. We stay in tents and fly 14 ft v-bottom cartop boats in with our motors and gas.Last trip we saw a couple of boats in the distance and since there are not supposed to be outposts on the lake we wondered where they came from. The lake is so large someone could have an outpost on it and we have not seen it. Anyone have info on this??? We have done real well on large walleye but would like to fish there and be able to stay in a cabin as a couple of the fellows are getting older and the tenting is hard on them. Ozhiski Lake is about 80 miles east of Pickle Lake. Thank you for any help!!
