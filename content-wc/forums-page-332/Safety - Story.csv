2768249,WalleyeWally28,2014-05-07 12:44:00,298,We use Berkley Big Game Fish Lip Grip and hang them over the edge of the boat while removing the hook. We never bring one into the boat.
2768265,tooski,2014-05-07 12:48:00,393,"Barbless-- It's already required in many areas. In five years most places will have complied. It is easier on the fish and much, much, much easier on the fisherman. Is it a macho thing with you guys? Just try it on one trip. you'll be hooked (so to say)..."
2768321,JayM5209,2014-05-07 13:01:00,1050,"Brett, this is pretty much how I do it. If you net the northern and let the fish stay in the water while you use a lip grip, the weight of the fish will not cause injury like it may if you use the lip grip to ""hang"" the fish vertically. The lip grip really does allow you to control the fish and eliminate almost all the movement.A very good alternative to the cost of a Boga grip, or the less expensive Berkley grip that I use, is the $13.99 Fish Grip Fish Holder available at Cabela's and BPS. They work just as well."
2768625,bthomas3333,2014-05-07 14:30:00,465,Thanks for the tip. That's what those plastic gripers are for!!! Seriously I find quite often the pike has the stick bait hooked fairly deep. Seems like I would need to hang the fish to get those out. The other issue would be getting the fish to open its mouth fair enough for the griper to fit. I get the concept. I will invest the 10-30 bucks whatever to trying it on one of my trips but I still think a good 40-50% of the time it will be tricky to get a stick bait out while the fish is in the water. I'll give it the try this season. THANKS!

2775281,roscoe33,2014-05-09 00:20:00,653,"Our boat has a lot of freeboard, can't reach the water from inside without hanging off the edge. No way you're going to unhook a northern that way.We net 'em. Jaw spreaders if needed, and 8 or 10"" forceps.WE, and many friends and relatives had been going to Canada for over 50 years.No hooked flesh as far as any of us can remember.A few years back, I bought 2 Knipex bolt cutters for our 2 boats, and we needed to use them the first week.Incident 1, fellow camper put a stick bait in his thigh.Incident 2, the resort owners golden retriever dove in after a lure being tossed from the dock by his 9 year old granddaughter.Now, as recommended by another member (v bay gord ?), I also carry a Knipex cable cutter, as the bolt cutter can be a bit difficult to use one handed, and my luck would have me putting a hook into my forearm.We carry a pretty extensive first aid kit, but don't carry any antibiotics."
2775545,BornToFish,2014-05-09 06:36:00,1224,"I've had several close calls of being hooked to a fish, but have never been hooked in such a manner. This situation is simply living a nightmare. Common links between these close calls has been ""small"" northern pikes and lures with multiple hooks. There are several excellent suggestions previously presented to deal with such situations. I can offer two more suggestions. First, most of my fishing for northern pike is with lures having a single hook (either a treble or a single hook). This way, I avoid being a hooked to a lure outside of the fish's mouth. Examples of such lures are spoons or in-line spinnerbaits (e.g. bucktails). Second, I use a protective glove when handling fish that appear to be problematic. I believe the gloves that I use most often are from Lindy. The point of a hook may make it through the glove and into my hand, but the gloves will certainly slow the hook down. The gloves also help with gill rakers. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
2767641,bthomas3333,2014-05-07 11:05:00,465,"Last year for the first time in 30+ years of fishing in Canada we had two people drive trebles through their fingers while unhooking small northerns. Seems like these stories all involve small northerns. The main problem occurred near a river outlet from a medium size lake. The boat driver was casting a 6in (3 treble) stick bait and hooked a 20in northern (**** late ice out). He was controlling the boat to maintain casting distance while fishing a short distance from the rapids falling out of the lake and had the boat idling. He quickly retrieved the northern and reached for the Northern with his left hand while reaching for the large bait with his right hand. When he touched the NP with his left hand it flopped and drove the top treble almost through his finger tip. Maybe 1/16 of an inch of the hook was sticking out the other side of his finger. This made him drop the NP with his left hand and the third treble unfortunately hooked the indoor/outdoor carpet on the bottom of the boat. So...flopping fish / right hand are all connected to the floor of the boat while the boat slowly idles to the rapids exiting the lake fast. Sooo he had to forget the fish and prioritize the problems. One get the boat away from the rapids. Two get rid of the #@@@% northern. Three get he lure off the line. Remove the 2nd hood connected to the floor. Four see if he can get the hook all the way through or drive the 30-45 mins back to camp. We managed to push the hook through but our pilers weren't strong enough to cut the hook off the shank so back to camp we go with the hook still in his finger. We went back to camp found better wire cutters and removed the hook. Next step was to clean the two holes. We had triple antibiotic ointment. Then cover the wounds. Then we started a broad based oral antibiotic one of the guys had with him. When we returned home he went to the urgent care to see what the Dr thought. Was it healing ok etc. His questions were: Did you clean it good? Check Did you cover it? Yes. Did you put anything on it? Antibiotic cream. Perfect We started an oral antibiotic. Which one? ""That would've been my first choice"" Wow he didn't yell at us for over using antibotics! Have you had a tetanus shot in the last 5-10 years? NO. ""Let's get you one"" So the safety lessons: When faced with an emergency in remote places. Handle the NP carefully. The biggest danger are the free trebles Prioritize the problems when you have an emergency Bring a reasonable amount of emergency meds. Everyone going to a remote locations like this really ought to have a tetanus shot. Thanks for reading."
2767697,Simple Man,2014-05-07 11:11:00,92,What was the brand of the cream and oral antibiotic? Just curious....
2767721,v-bay gord,2014-05-07 11:14:00,3168,"All good thoughts and preparations. I would add consider flattening the barbs on a select few lures that you know you'll be catching pike on (or any fish for that matter). Really doesn't affect the catching, but it could prevent you from going down in the rapids....."
2767769,SinOrSwim,2014-05-07 11:22:00,1528,"Grab yourself a tube of Neosporin/triple antibitoic ointment. That will serve you just fine. As for oral antibiotics there are many. Keflex/Cephalexin is a good one for skin infections. But, you have to be careful if you are giving someone else a medication intended for you. What are their drug allergies etc. We have several pharmacists on our trip so I would be comfortable giving somebody something. However, if I wasn't, I'm not sure I'd want the liability if I gave someone a drug that was prescribed to me and they had some sort of adverse reaction?"
2767801,Simple Man,2014-05-07 11:26:00,92,"The guys in my group have ""liquor pickled"" organs so they should be just fine. LOL. Thanks for the tips...."
2767921,SinOrSwim,2014-05-07 11:52:00,1528,"Sounds like our group? When we flew in I always asked my Dr. to give me a prescription for a few days worth of Keflex or samples of something. They don't really have samples anymore. He knew I would only use them if the need arose but if you explain you will be in the middle of nowhere, many times they will give you a prescription. Can go a long way if you have a hook or something dental etc. I had a year where I started getting bronchitis. I had a Zpak with me and I think it made the difference between a miserable trip to a tolerable trip."
2767937,Simple Man,2014-05-07 11:57:00,92,Zpaks are amazing! Great idea on the Keflex prescription fro the trip.
2767993,JayM5209,2014-05-07 12:07:00,1050,"Great story, and good safety reminder.Having removed treble hooks from someone's hand or finger on three occasions, may I add a few thoughts?1) Each time the person got hooked while bare handing a northern caught on a two or three treble lure. I have two related rules for my boat: a) a northern pike never comes into my boat, and b) if someone in my boat tries to grab a hooked northern with their hand, they immediately get dropped off on the closest shore, no excuses, no exceptions. If it's too far to hike back to camp, I'll pick them up at the end of the day.2) Spend the $30 and buy a pair of small Knipex bolt cutters. They'll cut any hook up to a 14/0 shark hook. I used to carry a cheap pair of 8"" cutters from a big box store but folks on WC convinced me that this is a place where quality counts. If I'm fishing, the Knipex are within reach - not buried somewhere in a tackle bag or boat compartment.3) If you do not know the hook removal technique using a piece of very strong line (better yet, a boot lace), learn how to do it before the next trip. Make sure someone else in the group knows it, too, just in case you're the one that gets hooked. In most cases if it is a single hook or one barb of a treble that is in the flesh, it does not have to be pushed through and cut to remove it.4) Use your Knipex to cut the lure from the embedded hook before trying removal. Would be a bummer to bury a 2nd hook while fiddling around trying to figure out what to do next.Fish safely. And, when you run into one of those hot-shot, big name, TV show fisherman who consistently bare hands northern and large walleyes to bring them into the boat and remove the hook/lure, call them out on the bad example they're setting for others. (End of rant!)"
2768041,bthomas3333,2014-05-07 12:19:00,465,Guys - I have heard this idea of never bring a northern into the boat. How do you remove a treble from the throat of a northern while it is swimming in the lake (in the net). Short of cutting off the $10 Rapala. I have fished A LOT and count myself pretty good with needle nose but removing trebles from a fish while swimming either breaks the hook or is really difficult. Tell me a trick. I'd love to hear it. Brett
2768201,thyme to fish,2014-05-07 12:37:00,307,"that's simple, first hold fishing rod with right hand, left hand hold the fish, right leg on tiller, left leg twisted behind you with pliers, say 3 hal Mary's.....goose the throttle, ....all this while talking to your wife on the phone,,,,easy,,,,until you get doubles..... on a serious note,,,, I smash most barbs down,,,,any bates with 3 trebles, I take middle one off..... I don't get my boat anywhere near waterfalls,,,,,,,between my luck, karma, mechanical failure,,,,,id be sunk"
