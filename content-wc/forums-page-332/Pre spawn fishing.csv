2787153,stillangling,2014-05-12 17:33:00,149,"Like every year, walleye will be spawning at 8C or 46 F. The vast majority of NW Ontario will not even get close to that by the weekend. We are looking at temps below freezing on two nights this week. If the lake you will be going to has a smaller creek where walleye are spawning they may be going. The earliest sites tend to have slow meandering sections upstream - gives the water time to warm up. The bigger river sites and main lake shoal spots will not even have started. The Winnipeg River in Kenora is siting at 4 C today. I normally fish on the Winnipeg River at least one day opening weekend. I expect fish to be in back eddies or hiding on the downstream side of humps between 12 and 22' of water. Late springs make for awesome fishing on the river but it has taken me a few years to dial the spots in. There is a current spot on Lake of the Woods that I will also make it to before the weekend is over. Less velocity than the Winnipeg River and the fish tend to congregate on the upstream side of the narrowest portion of the channel. That spot tends to be a little deeper than the river but generally less than 25' in depth. Charging batteries and starting to get excited!!"
2788057,btmbncr,2014-05-12 20:22:00,492,"I've caught males prespawn in holes in tributary mouths below what I assumed were shallow spawning areas.They'd ""milk"" when you handled them.I've never been really successful on big prespawn females.A couple of times we found them in deep water,staging areas, spots close to those shallow spawning areas.The prespawn bite,for males, always seemed to be better for me in rivers than lakes.Bill"
2782617,LoDo,2014-05-11 17:32:00,721,"I think its safe to say several fishing in late May will be fishing pre spawn conditions. Myself included. What should we expect? I'd guess fishing spawning areas waiting for males/females to arrive, shallow, warmest temps we can find, big females, less numbers, etc Did I answer my own question or am I completely off?"
2782705,BenBeattie,2014-05-11 18:19:00,232,"Current areas and pockets of warm water in shallow areas for sure. I've also caught pre-spawn walleye on opener on late ice out years in 20 - 40 feet of water. If it's really pre-spawn they may still be spread out all over the place. I'm guessing most will be staging near or in spawning areas though, but definitely pre-spawn fish. All the more reason to let the big ladies go so they can do their thing."
2782953,LoDo,2014-05-11 19:14:00,721,"Completely agree with letting the big gals go. We get the opportunity to fish a lake that doesn't get fished much. I'd bet less than 500 people fish this lake per year. This year the owners of camp established the ""no walleyes leave camp rule"". Some may frown, however most of us agree. Often times people take fish home and they sit in the deep freeze for months/years. Know way, IMO, do those walleyes that sit in the deep freeze taste even remotely as good as the day of the catch.If walleye is on the menu for the evening each guy keeps one 17.5 - 18"". Combine the two fillets with the sides and you have a nice dinner."
2783129,campchick,2014-05-11 19:49:00,96,"Walleyes spawn just as the ice is going out. So, they are/will be spawning right now or in the next few days. By late May they will be finished, although you probably will catch a few males that will make a mess of your boat."
2783201,JayM5209,2014-05-11 20:21:00,1050,"LoDo, it may not apply to the lake you'll be on, but check the 2014 regs for any bays or inlet/outlet rivers that may be designated fish sanctuaries. I'll be in NW Ontario the same time you will (year 36) and two of the lakes I fish regularly have sanctuaries. One has a large meandering bay, the other lake has an outlet creek that are sanctuaries. I mention it because a change this year moves the opening of the sanctuaries to June 15, two weeks later than it has been.Hope your crew has a great trip. I'll be looking for a comprehensive post-trip report."
2784785,camp chef,2014-05-12 09:30:00,915,Agree...Spawn will be done (for the most part) by the end of the month
2785489,LoDo,2014-05-12 11:48:00,721,"We have several spawning areas throughout the lake. Several little inlets/outlets, good current, shallow, etc... None of which are restricted due to ""spawning areas""."
2785625,bones82,2014-05-12 12:13:00,121,"Us too, but always release any fish with eggs regardless of size."
2785689,prov1800,2014-05-12 12:24:00,5010,Ive had females make a mess in my boat many times.lol.
2785705,bones82,2014-05-12 12:25:00,121,Me too...Males too. I still have dried eggs on my cooler from last year.
