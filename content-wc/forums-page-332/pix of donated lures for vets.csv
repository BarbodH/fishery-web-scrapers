2754041,tooski,2014-05-03 09:43:00,393,"Finally received the picture from the local paper that was supposed to be in the CBC News posting. We were not able to get permission to use the photo in time for the CBC article. Anyhow, I'm the guy in the Canada shirt. Ronnie Leeth is the totally blind vet in the photo with me. The other vet, Wayne Comstock, was late as the busload of vets from the Sandusky VA home was a bit late.."

2777649,JAY221,2014-05-09 15:59:00,877,"I hope it alright to post this. I received a nice letter of appreciation today from Wayne Comstock for the donation of lures. I hope they all have the trip of a lifetime. I know I have NEVER had a bad time fishing in Canada. Later, Jay"
2777993,reconssd,2014-05-09 18:49:00,147,"I second that Jay 221. I received a very nice letter from Wayne Comstock thanking me for the lures. I can't believe he is thanking me when the sacrifices he has made for our country far out weigh any donated lures. As a veteran, I can't thank Tooski enough for making this trip happen. I know these guys will appreciate it forever and will never forget this trip."
2667633,tooski,2014-04-11 17:30:00,393,"Received another gift today from Ed (ED08walleye). Surprisingly Ed lives a few miles away in Wakeman Ohio and he may be able to come up and join us at the Vet's benefit dinner on the 26th of April. That would be great ... Anyhow on top of some nice lures he sent two fish counters to keep the lies under control. He must have me confused with Bob Kerr. On a side note- John ( the disabled vet in the wheelchair) is not going to be able to make the trip. I have feelers out to three different vet support groups to find a replacement. I'm saying this in case someone knows a qualifying disabled vet. My only criteria is it should be someone who would probably never do a fly-in without our help. I don't care what category of war, sex, race, or religion they fall under. Prefer someone within 3 hour drive of northeastern Ohio. Again my e-mail is [email protected]. Thanks... Joe T"
2674569,phishfearme,2014-04-13 18:50:00,1242,I actually tried to order fish counters from a company based in Cleveland - they had two models: one that could only count to 3 and the other could only count to 7. phish
2693970,tooski,2014-04-18 09:04:00,393,Today I received easily the most unique lure package for the veterans to date. Bill Bess crafts his own lures and he made three special ones for the vet trip. Each lure has the vets name and date of trip so they will always have a keepsake of this trip. I included a pix of his letter and I certainly agree with his take on the Walleye Central members. Thanks a ton Bill ( I don't have your WC member name). A week from this Saturday is the fundraiser and I will post pix of the vets in this thread.. .
2694634,BuckeyeBill,2014-04-18 12:30:00,76,"Joe, my handle on WalleyeCentral is BuckeyeBill. So glad you liked the lures."
2738026,tooski,2014-04-29 14:29:00,393,"The fundraiser went very well. The Sandusky veterans home bussed 14 vets to the dinner, among them 3 WW2 vets and 4 in wheelchairs. It was great talking with them. Unfortunately our ""video"" man neglected to bring a regular camera and took all the footage with a video camera. I am still trying to figure out how to capture a frame so I can post some photo's here. I was contacted by CBC news out of Thunder Bay to do an interview, which I agreed to, but as I said unfortunately we had no photos of the vets. Heather Kitching insisted on some photos so I sent her the only recent ones I had. Yes, I am a dork. I believe she picked up the AP feed from our local papers that did a nice spread. Anyhow here is the link....Thanks again to all from Walleye Central.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunde...trip-1.2625572"
2738082,phishfearme,2014-04-29 14:33:00,1242,I can't believe you didn't send in the photos of you in a steeler's jersey! phish
2738242,tooski,2014-04-29 14:56:00,393,"You have the only copy of that pittspuke porn. I destroyed all other evidence, including Pullmypoploose's jersey."
2738578,Larry S,2014-04-29 15:52:00,665,"Joe, I saw your picture in the CBC article, you kinda look like Coach Ditka, so I will send you a Bears Jersey with the coaches number 89 on it to wear on your trip. Then you won't have to soil your skin with a Pittsburgh Jersey."
2738674,tooski,2014-04-29 16:13:00,393,"Great Larry, You send it I'll wear it. My skin is still crawling from that Stoolers jersey and it was 2 years ago. I'm not quite Ditka's size but I'm certainly closing the gap..."
2740450,BuckeyeBill,2014-04-30 06:04:00,76,Nice article Joe. I have some disturbing news for you though. This Buckeye fan is also a huge Steeler fan. Living only 60 miles from Pittsburgh there is a huge following of Pittsburgh fans in eastern Ohio. Right now I am sporting my Penguin playoff beard....though not much of one.
2579457,tooski,2014-03-21 15:48:00,393,Got these beauties from Jay221 today. Plus he initialed them so I don't have to . What a guy....
2580209,JAY221,2014-03-21 19:41:00,877,"And the USPS got it to you a day earlier than they predicted! Thanks for doing what you are to help these guys. Later, Jay"
2580729,Terwalleye,2014-03-21 22:04:00,166,You got a paypal account?The Society would love to donate some beer money For on shore of course.
2581217,tooski,2014-03-22 07:17:00,393,"Terwalleye, A generous offer indeed, and although the Society is widely recognized for it's philanthropic donations we will decline. Prefer not to get involved in any financial gifts. Thanks so much for the offer though.."
2581385,octanehi5,2014-03-22 07:53:00,1104,"Great Idea, For the vets"
2608186,tooski,2014-03-28 17:16:00,393,"First off let me apologize- I have been putting the newer photos in the thread Phish started on contributions. So the photos of lures from Ifish, Terwalleye and Jambi are in the wrong thread. Maybe the threads can be merged? Or less likely I can figure out how to move them...Anyhow more donations. Today from Mark Komo--Wow, probably over 40 cranks. Second picture is some of those lures waiting to get their barbs ground off..."
2610202,tooski,2014-03-29 08:23:00,393,"A batch from Sirmanski Lures. My favorite because they have great color but also because he made a couple of custom ""Polish Walleye"" lures for my personal use....My photo skills don't do the colors justice.."
2614242,tooski,2014-03-30 09:00:00,393,Terwalleye donated a $100.00 Gander gift certificate with instructions to buy what was needed for the vets. I purchased these tackle bags and boxes. Thanks Mark....
2616410,Mike Kansas,2014-03-30 18:22:00,1463,"Tooski, Thanks for what you are doing for the vets. I'm glad that we could be a small part of it. Mike Kansas"
2628753,tooski,2014-04-02 12:01:00,393,Well Dave (Reconssd) said he liked to fish for the big mamas and it showed in this absolute pile of lures he sent. Most are still in the original packs. I had trouble getting it all into one picture. Maybe should have done two so you could see the scope of this package...Hard to tell from the photo but most of these are well over 6 inches...
2576177,tooski,2014-03-20 17:26:00,393,"Thanks to Larry S for this mother lode of lures for the vet trip. The postage alone was over $13.00... Raps, Mepps, jigs, BB's, spoons, etc. Shows not to believe the gloom and doom newspapers, there are many more good people around than bad. Thanks a ton Larry, from the vets."
2576265,Sportdog,2014-03-20 17:44:00,6735,That is awesome. You guys are special.
2576393,Larry S,2014-03-20 18:14:00,665,"No, THANK YOU TOOSKI for taking the time to take these Vets on a special fishing trip."

(then again, probably not!) phish"
2578193,Larry S,2014-03-21 10:09:00,665,"Hey, Phish the gear sent to Joe T is just the tip of the iceberg. I have a ton more stuff still in garage You can have whatever you want out of my tackle box."
