2779953,Paul H,2014-05-10 16:34:00,1232,"Prices are all on the US Site = there is a charge for expediting, another charge for expedited mailing of your passport and docs. back to you. Off hand it seems like it was another $50 or so. Don't forget when you apply what you need. You are way ahead to have it filled out before you go. Need copies of your ID's front & back,I think you also need copies of your birth cert. and the 2 photos."
2779969,Guest,2014-05-10 16:38:00,0,Just follow all of the information in the link: http://www.independenttraveler.com/t...ational-travel Never had a problem yet.
2780913,BornToFish,2014-05-11 06:36:00,1224,"First, I ask my auto insurance provider for a ""yellow"" card as proof of insurance. I understand that this card is not required for entry into Canada, but will be immensely helpful to you should you need to provide proof of insurance (i.e. you have a mishap). The card is entitled ""Canada NON-RESIDENT Inter-Province Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance Card"". There is no fee for this card from my auto insurer. Second, I believe that you may want to have with you proof of ownership (not just registration) of your boat/trailer. We have been asked to provide such documentation when transporting snow machines across the border. I wouldn't be surprised if fellows are asked for such documentation from time to time for their boats/rigs. The officers are looking for stolen rigs that are transported into Canada for sale within Canada. The thieves are looking to turn their stolen rigs into easy cash. Third, I have with me a document showing that I completed a boater safety course from the DNR in my home state. This document satisfies requirements in Ontario for boater safety certification. I purchased this document for $3.00 from a DNR license outlet. You may want to go on-line and purchase your Outdoors Card and fishing license in advance of your trip. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

Include telephone numbers for the parents to be reached and the name, social security number and birthdate of the child in the letter. And don't forget receipts showing the cost of alcohol and other things that you may have to pay duty/tax on."
2784913,FishFry2012,2014-05-12 10:01:00,27,How soon are you going up there?
2785209,SinOrSwim,2014-05-12 10:51:00,1528,Do they call that a DD drivers license then?
2779713,KM1,2014-05-10 15:05:00,374,"I know there is a post on here coming from Canada to U.S. regarding what you need. However, I am coming from the U.S. and crossing the border at International Falls into Canada. I would like to know if someone could tell me exactly what is needed for identification to cross the border without any issues. It's been about 14 years since I've been (yes...way to long...I LOVE Canada)...and am not sure what is appropriate I.D. anymore. Drivers license enough? Do I need birth certificate too or something else? Proof of boat and vehicle ownership (or would insurance cards for both be enough)? So...anyone know exactly what I need to cross?"
2779729,thyme to fish,2014-05-10 15:17:00,307,"not sure what is required,,,,,i bring driv lic,,,passport,,,,reg to car and boat...insurance card for car and boat,,,,, ive always had an easy time going back and forth"
2779753,Shellback,2014-05-10 15:20:00,8083,"I just hand them my US passport, and answer any questions asked. You do realize that you will be required to present a US passport upon your return to the states? The passport rule was put in place by the US, not Canada."
2779761,CI_Guy,2014-05-10 15:21:00,2118,"If you want to return to the US without a long delay and a lot of questions you need one of the following: Passport, Passport Card or Enhanced Drivers License. This winter one person in our party didn't have any problem getting into Canada with his license & birth certificate but he didn't have a passport, card or enhanced license and it took an extra 1hr 45min to get through US customs. Luckily he wasn't in my truck so we waited in a bar in Warroad while he was grilled. I've never been asked for registration or proof of insurance for the boat but they are always in the truck."
2779777,Jimmy Jig,2014-05-10 15:21:00,1905,"Get a Passport or a Passport Card. You willl need it to return to the USA. A regristration for the boat, and the vehiclek. And a proof of vehicle insurance card is required in Iowa so that just rides along on the trip."
2779785,KM1,2014-05-10 15:23:00,374,How long does that take...I don't have a passport???
2779793,thyme to fish,2014-05-10 15:26:00,307,"I think 4-6 weeks,,,,,but you can expidite as soon as I think 3-5 days...$$$"
2779801,CI_Guy,2014-05-10 15:30:00,2118,"This winter it took a friend 3 weeks. I think it varies depending how busy they are. I see you're from Ill., I know people who have driven from Minneapolis to Chicago because the office there can do expedited passports for a fee in 24 hours."
2779817,KM1,2014-05-10 15:33:00,374,"Ok...I can get one at our post office in my town. They do it there. I have to find out if they will expedite the process or I have to go somewhere else to do that. Not sure what THAT is going to cost. If I understand correctly, for best travel without issue, I will need: 1. Drivers Liscense 2. U.S. Passport 3. Vehicle registration card 4. Insurance card for vehicle and trailer/boat 5. Boat registration (which is on the boat) Is that correct???"
2779841,CI_Guy,2014-05-10 15:44:00,2118,Looks good.
