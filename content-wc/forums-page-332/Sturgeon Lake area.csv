If we can't get out on Sturgeon is there any smaller lakes around there someone would suggest. We've never been anywhere, but Sturgeon and some outpost lakes further north on Sturgeon. Any help would be appreciated.Chris"

Based on the reports I have heard from locals on the lake, it is unlikely that the main lake will be free of ice for the opener. Some of the bays may be open but access could be an issue. Are you going to be south, middle or north end, there are lakes along that 599 west side. I would suggest you stop into the Silver dollar talk to Marty and he will point you in what ever direction may have some open water. good luck GF"
2774545,haldo44,2014-05-08 19:43:00,3,yeah sorry I wasn't more specific. We will be in the south end. Typically have Sturgeon Lake Lodge run us up to the outpost lakes about halfway up. We will be staying at main camp hoping the ice can go off early the following week so we can still get up there. Just never fished anywhere besides the outpost lakes.
2775745,JJJMN,2014-05-09 07:52:00,153,We stay at Trappers Point Camp at the very north end. I think our bay will be open. Just hope it's open in the legal fishing area. Our camp is in the Walleye sanctuary. Camp owners say they have several smaller lakes they can get us into if Sturgeon is still frozen. They have some pictures posted of current conditions but haven't updated them in a few days. The web cam at Sweet Water Cruise's at Sioux Lookout is just west of Sturgeon and is a close indication of ice in the area.
