Author, environmentalist, outspoken advocate for a variety of good causes, he will be missed. If you aren't familiar with his many books, look for some at your local library or download a few to your Kindle.http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-27319545"

I'll have to get some of his other books in remembrance. ""conquered peoples never forget - no matter how much their conquerors want them to."" thanks, phish"
