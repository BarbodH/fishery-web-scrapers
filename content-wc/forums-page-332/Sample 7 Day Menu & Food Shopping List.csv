2780233,bushead11,2014-05-10 18:40:00,151,Love the menu! Fell like I have to make one now...
2780713,forgop,2014-05-11 00:06:00,880,"I'm a Purdue alum, so we have to have something going for us having the last placed football and basketball teams in the conference, right? That said, I still have yet to make this recipe although I've wanted to several tiems. Just far too many ingredients to take with us and I'm of the opinion we'll take a Shore Lunch dry mix to make up there. Certainly not as good, but the weight difference is HUGE."
2491114,123chadder,2014-02-26 07:48:00,429,"god no,i use it to keep ice in solid form.......read my post carefully....not my first rodeo....."
2491522,Simple Man,2014-02-26 09:13:00,92,That Hobo Stew sounds AMAZING! I wrote down the recipe. Thanks!
2697034,adempsey,2014-04-18 22:40:00,963,"I made this last month and again tonight (although, I started with dry beans and used San Marzano tomatoes). I have to say this is the BEST CHILI I have ever had. You have to try it!!! Thanks for the recipe! Just awesome."
2697722,packpro,2014-04-19 08:41:00,695,"If you have a June trip, one of the best times to go to the store is a few days before Memorial Day. That is considered a BBQ holiday. Steaks, Chops, burgers, brats, condiments etc... all on sale. You will find much of the meat on your menu on sale. Also the precooked Costco/Sams chicken can't be beat for price, convenience, flavor. I piece them out and vacuum seal them. We buy 4-5 for 12 guys. Just heat them up in a foil pan (turkey pan works great) with a little broth. You can use the oven, stove top, or BBQ/ $20-$25 feeds 12 guys. Pretty easy on the wallet. Fast and easy clean up. Leftovers make great Sandwiches.We try to precook and freeze anything we can to keep the meals convenient with easy clean up. Vacuum sealing the meals, or precooking them in aluminum catering trays makes them easy to pack and easy to serve, clean up.Anything cooked the night before that can be turned into sandwiches the next day saves time."
2697898,bones82,2014-04-19 09:33:00,121,"One that hasn't been mentioned is chili dogs. We buy some cans of stags chili with chucks of hamburger in it and do this a couple times. It's easy to do over an open fire too. We mainly cook over an open fire but also bring a smoker up and have smoked ribs, pork chops, and fish."
2700826,10lbeye,2014-04-20 07:32:00,61,"Bushead: Your menu looks great, but allow me to suggest 2 variations of the ""beans"" that are easy and different. One is a simple tomato and bean salad (served cold/room tempature). Take 2 cans of canellini beans (drained), about 1 pint sliced grape or cherry tomatoes, 2 T olive oil and 1 T fresh lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. 2nd is corn and black bean salsa (served cold/room temp). 1 can black beans drained/rinsed. 1 small bag frozen corn defrosted/drained. 1 chopped red pepper. chopped scallions or half a red onion. 1 sprig chopped cilantro leaves (optional--I love it but it is an acquired taste). Juice of 1 lime and 2/3 T of red wine vinegar (to taste). 2 tsp Penzey's Salsa Seasoning (or inferior substitute--Penzey's is the best!) Drizzle a little olive oil/salt pepper to taste. Both introduce veggies into the bean equation, and are very versatile. Can be served as a side dish and the black bean salsa is wonderful as an appetizer w/ tortilla chips. Both can be made ahead of time and easily transported in ziplock bags, and will also keep for weeks in the frig. Enjoy! 59 days and counting for me...."
2701290,port1042,2014-04-20 09:04:00,509,"We do a couple of things a little different and we're at a drive-in camp so weight is not a problem. First, we like to start fishing fairly early in the morning (6am). I like to eat something first, but Bob just wants coffee. I bring several microwave breakfasts and in 2 minutes I have either french toast and sausage, pancakes and sausage, or scrambled eggs and sausage without any mess. Maple Farms makes a decent microwave breakfast and they are often on sale for a buck each. Usually we'll fish until about 11am then head back to camp for a good lunch and hit the lake again about 3pm. However, in the boat I have a soft side cooler that contains a loaf of bread, a jar of mayo, several cheese slices, and a package of sliced ham and turkey. Also in the package are 4 Lunchables. We may or may not use any of that stuff, but if the fish are biting and we're really having fun, or we're further away than normal, we will eat or snack on that stuff rather than go in for lunch. Usually by the end of the week we have used up that package. The Lunchables make a great snack and are good to share if we stop to share advice with another boat. A good lunch at the cabin most often is a big breakfast. We don't do shore lunches, but if invited to join in by others, we'll help out anyway we can! The dinner menu for 7 nights: Brats (2 nights); Steak (1 night); Walleye, Northern, or Perch (3 nights); Pizza (1 night at a local tavern). Tater Tots, baked beans, corned beef hash, eggs, shore lunch, and a couple cans of soup along with the necessary condiments always find their way into the grocery box. For the 2 of us a case of beer (generally a light beer - we're not particular) and a liter of brandy provide adequate libation. We seldom have any left over and don't find it necessary to stop at the duty free for extra booze. We drink water/soda in the boat."
2778945,bushead11,2014-05-10 07:59:00,151,13.5 days till we hit the road. I'm sure I'm not alone. Any last minute suggestions that have not been mentioned. I think our group has things dialed in pretty well thanks to a bunch of forum members... Hope the ice is out for the opener and that everyone has the chance to make some great memories this season... FISH ON!
2780177,Live to jig,2014-05-10 18:27:00,159,Here is our Menu for 2 and shopping list.....ya I love to cook but every meal is prepped and planned to prepare quickly. Second to fishing up there I look forward to the eating!

2487777,123chadder,2014-02-25 12:26:00,429,oh and thanx to SinOrSwim Hawkfan and MorganMan for getting me the walleye chimichenga recipe.....it will be amazing!
2487793,123chadder,2014-02-25 12:30:00,429,"Shore lunch. Take some tortillas with you and make wraps with your fish or tacos. take a bag of shredded lettuce, some chopped tomato, some bacon crumbles and a bottle or ranch or tartar. spice it up with some hotwing sauce with the ranch. Take some buns and make a fish sandwich. Fresh walleye fried up on a bun with some lettuce and tartar.....mmmmmm. Fry the tortilla to make a crunchy taco. use sour cream blended with some adobo sauce/peppers for a spicy baja sauce. wedge of lime...good to go. yes!walleye on a bun!use panko bread crumbs for reaaly crispy fish,serve on a toasted chiabata bun with bacon,montery jack,lettuce,tomato,roasted red pepper and lemon zest mayo....sooo very good,serve with homemade walleye macaroni salad"
2487905,Lovetofish,2014-02-25 12:54:00,458,I bring frozen smoked brisket and smoked baby back ribs. That's two evening meals. Heat the brisket in a pan and have along a package of good buns. The 1/2 rack of ribs are wrapped in foil before freezing. When thawed I open the foil and add BBQ sauce and re-wrap them and put in the oven at 225-250 for an hour of beer consumption. The side orders can be just about anything but for me nothing difficult. All the other evening meals are fish and fried potatoes with frozen sweet corn or canned veggies. My wife always makes a pail of cookies before we go and another simple desert is Snack Pack Pudding.
2488089,bushead11,2014-02-25 13:28:00,151,"This is gonna be a 10 page thread by the end of the week! I already changed most of the meals for my group. The nice thing about the feedback is that it looks like everyone does things pretty much the same but a few tweaks to the ingredients or preparation make all the difference. Now, I'm a Wisconsin Badger fan through and through but the hands down best recipe for chili that I've come across is ironically called Boilermaker Chili in spirit of Purdue football tailgating. I've made this recipe over a dozen times and always comes out awesome and not to spicy for those that can't handle the heat. I personally add a ton of red pepper and franks red hot to my bowl!http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Boilermaker-Tailgate-Chili/(3262) 5 star reviews can't be wrong either 86 days and counting..."
2489201,adempsey,2014-02-25 18:12:00,963,That chilli sounds awesome. Gonna make it sometime this week!
2489449,forgop,2014-02-25 18:59:00,880,"I have only been once, but here are some of my tips and takeaways for a group of 4 for planning/packing purposes:1) Freeze bottled water-no need to add ice to your cooler on your trip up. It may be plenty to keep everything cold that can wait til you get to the cabin fridge. Plus you know you'll have the some halfway decent water compared to what water source you may be pulling from up there. 2) Forecast your daily beer allotment and multiply that by 2 for what you really need.3) I smoked pork butts at home and packaged in 2# vacuum sealed bags. Place in a pot of water over the stove and you'll have delicious pulled pork in just a few minutes. Very little mess/clean up and much better than just standard lunch meats or PBJ. 4) 15# of taters was a perfect amount for the week-served fried with our fish5) Pancakes were a good quick and easy clean up for breakfast over eggs/meats/etc. 6) 1.25 gallon of cooking oil from Costco was enough for the whole week and then some. We strained, added as needed, and went with fresh mid-week. 7) See #2. Multiple by 2 again. Whether you're on the boat, in the cabin, or just exploring the area, you can drink a LOT more beer in 16 (or more) waking hours a day than you think when you drink so few in your normal work life. I took in a 30 pack of Labatt's and a case of Coors and saw by the end of day 2 I would have to ration or run out just over halfway into our trip8) If taking steaks, pre season at home and vacuum seal. 9) Chili is a must. I prepared our pot up there from scratch, but will likely make at home to reheat up there. I would recommend preparing everything in advance that can be done just to simplify things up there. Keep in mind you won't have the same access to blenders, choppers, cooking utensils, etc, and doing much more by hand up there."
2489537,forgop,2014-02-25 19:16:00,880,"My cousin prepared something that he called hobo stew. He foiled walleye with butter, garclic, and I think taters (you can obviously add whatever other fillers you want like corn, tomatoes, etc) and cooked it on the grill. Good paired with some nice 20 oz NY strips off the grill."
2490634,123chadder,2014-02-26 06:33:00,429,"here is a tip for ice the whole week.......use dry ice.i line the bottom of a medium cooler with 2-3"" of dry ice,put down an inch piece of plywood and put 4 blocks in....those blocks wont lose a drop of water.great for camping too....i always have lots of ice all week with dry ice....you run out of ice,freeze more....yes fill some bottles up with water and they will freeze"

2484761,misanthrope,2014-02-24 18:06:00,43,"All meats for meals are repackaged and vacuum sealed. Toss steaks, chops, etc. into a vacuum bag with the marinade. When you vacuum seal it, the marinade gets sucked into the meat. Freeze and pull out in the morning before you hit the water.Last year, one of the boys brought up a Soda Stream. Big hit with the kids, carbonated soda using filtered water with minimal weight."

2487617,Simple Man,2014-02-25 11:55:00,92,"We had 4 in our group. We threw in Pike as well, as we are Musky fisherman and one of the guys in our group stumbled on a Trout while casting for Musky. The Pike was still great in the recipe but the one trout we cooked was even better. Trout is just hard for us to come by given that we are casting for Musky all day."

2487729,Simple Man,2014-02-25 12:17:00,92,"I just got to looking closer at the grocery lists in this thread and have come to the conclusion that the other guys in my group may be alcoholics. Of course, I am not one of them at all! We were in an outpost last year and went through the 10 cases of beer we boated in with and ran out with a day left so we had to resort to buying a case of warm Blue Light in cans from the main camp.....and that got consumed as well. I may have to host an intervention this year at our cabin for the rest of our crew....you guys are more than welcome to attend but be sure to come with at least a case of beer. LOL!"
2487737,Simple Man,2014-02-25 12:18:00,92,Wow! That sounds Great! I just copied it to our list for this years trip!
2482361,bushead11,2014-02-24 08:01:00,151,My understanding is that open containers are illegal but you can transport closed containers. If you couldn't transport beer via boat I don't know that anyone would ever do an outpost trip
2482369,SinOrSwim,2014-02-24 08:02:00,1528,"We take beer for beer batter. It's in a tote vs in a cooler. We have been told while beer in the boat is illegal, the intent is toward drinking vs an ingredient in beer batter. I'll take the risk. Batter with water just isn't the same"
2482833,tv4fish,2014-02-24 09:28:00,2694,"AGREED - In fact we have even been told that if you have unopened beer in your boat for shore lunch (like - one apiece) and you are stopped/checked, you PROBABLY still would be OK. It is going to depend on the ""mood"" of whoever stops you, I guess. Like they say - you pays your money and you takes your chances......"
2483113,MrSimon,2014-02-24 10:33:00,922,"This stuff gets covered a ton ... but what the heck, its February ... what else do we have to discuss This year we are going to focus a lot on preparing meals ahead of time and freezing them in disposable containers. Serves as ice in the coolerPacks easilyIs WAY better than taking individual ingredients and having to prepare meals at campAt camp, just dump in pot, heat, and eat. Super simple.Next to no clean up after dinnerMeals tend to be healthier and tastier when prepared in advance in a real kitchen (often times by our wives, and not us)"
2483281,CI_Guy,2014-02-24 11:22:00,2118,"Several years ago we were checked by a CO and told that if you were bring supplies into your camp or bringing left overs out of your camp at the end of your trip you were OK. One can of beer per boat for fish batter for shore lunch (preferably warm) was a gray area he would have no problem with. Any beer to be consumed with shore lunch or any place on the lake besides your base camp was illegal. The fine was quite stiff and was per can or bottle of beer or ml of alcohol. We had our 1 can of beer for batter with us when we were checked and he told us to have it in the box we had our batter mix and other can goods in next time rather than in a cooler like ours was. We stopped doing shore lunch because of the time and the amount of work involved, but I know there are people that it is one of the highlights of their trip."
2483441,Knoxabilly,2014-02-24 12:19:00,225,"Great thread- I'm think I'm gunna come up with a menu this year! Been wanting to try the walleye tacos, definitely will this year"

I've never had too much leftover and never over weight. Nobody is ever left hungry either.If my group was bigger I'd probably bring up a fresh pie and probably pre-make and freeze some type of curry or stew-type meal."
2480065,roscoe33,2014-02-23 15:47:00,653,"Lots of great ideas here, but it sounds more like you are all going on a cooking retreat than a fishing trip. We try to keep cook time and cleanup time to a minimum. Bacon is loved, but sliced ham warms up fast and makes less mess. A pork roast and a beef roast provides sandwich meat. Spaghetti is a fall back meal incase we are kept off the water by bad storms. A large kettle of soup or chili is made on day one, and used to supplement other meals. A couple heads of romaine lettuce seems to keep better than other types. Eggs are easy, and if needed, can be cracked ahead of time, even frozen. Question for you all, where are you buying your meats? Technically, it still can't be taken across the border, and last year they confiscated our Dinty Moore stew, specifically saying because it contained meat. We buy all our fresh groceries after we cross the border, but never gave the canned stew in my boats emergency kit a thought."
2480401,JDP,2014-02-23 16:58:00,1457,"You can bring meat and poultry into Canada:I have been being beef, chicken, etc. in to Ontario for over 30 years.Here is a link that covers what can be brought over:http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/inf.../1389648516990"
2480681,Pikeslayer8,2014-02-23 18:02:00,1460,"Boat-in outpost sounds very fun, probably don't have to skimp on weight as ya would for a fly-in. Very cool. Just looking at your menu, wondering what you had in mind for your Cajun Walleye Tacos? I've been formulating a new Walleye Taco recipe and I think yours might be close."
2480705,roscoe33,2014-02-23 18:04:00,653,"Yes, really. They said they would supply documentation if I wanted it. I played nice and said no thank you, as I didn't want to upset the man. Pigeon Falls (Thunder Bay) Those web sites are very misleading. 2 years ago, they took the 2 apples from the truck. And 8? years ago, they took our tomatoes. Both of which are ""ok"" according to the web links. There are several other sites out there, with conflicting info about amount and origin of the foods. We have always done the grocery stop, simply for for our convenience, as sometimes we are one the road for days before crossing the border. Easier to keep everything cold if we buy it an hour before heading into camp."
2480849,btyreprich,2014-02-23 18:30:00,1067,WOW!Our group has been doing housekeeping plan for the past 12+ years and never have we had any problems crossing the border in terms of groceries.I always have all receipts with us and know not to bring vegetables out of our garden. I think the transfer of dirt / soil is the issue here.Given how much we spend on groceries plus what it costs in Canada - even at the Walmart in Dryden - having some items taken away from you could be a problem both financially and in lost time.
2481161,JDP,2014-02-23 19:33:00,1457,"IMHO....I agree there is a lot of misleading , conflicting information on the internet. It is everyone's responsibility to seek out the facts, rules, laws, etc.The U.S. also has rules for what food may be brought in from Canada.Enjoy your trip this year."
2481977,SinOrSwim,2014-02-24 06:22:00,1528,"Ours is both. A cooking retreat and a fishing retreat. Also a relaxing and drinking retreat along with a gambling retreat. To each their own but we have people that have gone with us making comments one of the big reasons they go is the food. We have some simple stuff and we have some more difficult things to make. My favorite meal in Canada are the Walleye Chimichangas. They take some time to make but they are awesome. But, we all like to cook so that is part of the fun. You can make a lot of things ahead of the trip. Last year was the first year we had tried freezing breakfast burritos and it worked great! Bacon can be cooked and crumbled and put in ziplock bags prior to going. Things like that can save on cooking and cleanup. But, it is no more difficult to clean a pot that has made our filling for the chimis than it is to clean a pot that you heated your jarred spaghetti sauce in."

2482081,SinOrSwim,2014-02-24 07:03:00,1528,"Send a PM to MorganMan or Hawkfan. They are the two that do the filling for the chimis. I am usually cooking fish and then frying the chimis when they are all rolled and ready to go. Off top of my head they have shrimp, scallops, walleye, green chili enchilada sauce, pepperjack cheese etc. All rolled in a tortilla and deep fried. Served on shredded lettuce with black olives and a white cheese sauce. And rice. Great, now I'm really hungry. I know some people want easy and quick but I think the food adds to the whole experience. I have tried many times to do a shorelunch at home and it can't be done. It is just not the same. There is just something about having a walleye shorelunch that can't be duplicated. We had a guide a few days last year. He cooked his fish and we cooked ours too. We had 14 guys so he obviously wasn't going to cook for 14. He said he took offense his fish didn't get eaten as quickly until he tasted what we do. He absolutely loved it and said he was going to incorporate some of what we do to his shorelunches. That said, we learned a few things from him too. Was alot of fun."
2482177,CI_Guy,2014-02-24 07:31:00,2118,Lasagna with garlic bread is one of my favorite meals on our trip. I bake a couple of pans of lasagna then freeze it for the trip then let it thaw while we fish and just reheat it that night. We also precook our bacon to cut down on breakfast prep time and cleanup. I noticed you had beer on your shore lunch menu. Just curious how you plan on getting it there since it is illegal to have it in your boat in Ontario.
2473881,bushead11,2014-02-21 16:26:00,151,Guys-Been searching the board for sample menus and camp routines. Found some great information but not exactly what I was looking for... Decided to inventory what I purchased for a 2012 trip. 6 guys on a boat-in outpost trip for 7 days... Attached is the menu and shopping list. I wanted to see if anyone had something similar that they use that has been tried and tested over the years. We are getting ready to go back the last week of May 2014 and I wanted to get a jump start on the food situation. Any thoughts and recommendations would be great. Excited to see what the experienced vets on WC have to say...Thank!~Ryan
2473945,btyreprich,2014-02-21 16:48:00,1067,"Many times what is on the dinner menu will be based on what I was able to buy on sale! Living outside of Chicago does have advantages in that there are many grocery stores competing for business. This means I can ""cherry pick"" their sales to build our dinner menu. With that said, we have two meals of pork - pork chops one night and seasoned pork tenderloin on another night. An inexpensive meal can be spaghetti, meat balls, & garlic bread. We do treat ourselves to steak one night. The whole tenderloin is often on sale for around $6.00 a pound. It makes two meals for us: steak one night and fajitas a second night. Used to make beer can chicken. Tasty and fairly inexpensive, but takes about an hour and half to cook."

Your breakfasts are strictly eggs/bacon and pancakes/cereal which is fine but I don't think you got near enough eggs and bacon on your list. I would add another dozen eggs to the list and some sausage to mix it up a bit. We like to go with a yogurt/fresh fruit/granola breakfast at least one day later in the trip. It's quick/easy and after all the fried foods, easy on the ole constitution. Of course your pancake/cereal is as well. Remember to be flexible with your shore lunches. May need to have them back at camp if Mother Nature doesn't cooperate and I'm guessing that all the ham sandwiches are to eat on the water. Do you plan on fishing far from camp most of the time? If not, a quick meal of brats or burgers hits the spot on those days you're not having shore lunch. Your plan shows 4 meals with beans, I would prepare all 8 of your listed cans on Sunday night's meal and then split out 3 portions into ziplock bags for ease of preparation when needed. When initially cooking your beans, dice an onion or two, dice a jalapeno or two, throw some bacon and brown sugar in der to kick em up a bit. I would also make all of your pasta salad on Sunday as well and portion in ziplocks. Kick that up with some green onions, shredded cheese and maybe some parmesan and chopped green pepper. I would be remiss if I didn't recommend that you have Walleye Chowder one day especially if you have a cold front you're dealing with. Your dinner plans look fine though I would switch out chili night with steak night. As far as the list, more onions, less potatoes, more bacon and eggs. Have a great trip Ryan. Where ya going?"
2475769,bushead11,2014-02-22 08:53:00,151,"thanks for the feedback guys! Pikeslayer8- Were going to Woman River Camp north of Ear Falls. We are staying at their outpost which is about 15 miles from camp or half way up the river system. Great combo of pike, smallies and walleyes. Gonna try for lakers this year as well. We had been there twice before with a different outfitter. Excited to have a different experience. Looking forward to the portage lakes and the bite this time of year. We have never gone this early. So some of the meal ideas are assuming its gonna be a little colder out i.e chili. I would love for someone to send me a pm or post a recipie for Walleye Chowder. Keep the suggestions coming boys. Man i love this message board!"

2476105,camp chef,2014-02-22 10:23:00,915,When we have a group of 4 or more we play soup roulette for one lunch. As an accompaniment to sandwiches of some kind. Every one brings a can of soup with the labels removed and we mix it all together for a pot of Roulette Soup. Everyone looks forward to Soup day. The laughter and conversation always trumps the taste.

2477961,SinOrSwim,2014-02-22 22:27:00,1528,"soup roulette sounds disgusting, I have to be honest. Yuk! Pikeslayer has some very good ideas. There are ways to make an ordinary meal very very good. You can still keep it basic. Shore lunch. Take some tortillas with you and make wraps with your fish or tacos. take a bag of shredded lettuce, some chopped tomato, some bacon crumbles and a bottle or ranch or tartar. spice it up with some hotwing sauce with the ranch. Take some buns and make a fish sandwich. Fresh walleye fried up on a bun with some lettuce and tartar.....mmmmmm. Fry the tortilla to make a crunchy taco. use sour cream blended with some adobo sauce/peppers for a spicy baja sauce. wedge of lime...good to go.Dinner. Instead of regular spaghetti. Do linguine, use a white sauce and add your fish. Get some shrimp and scallops. Maybe some cajun seasoning. Cajun seafood pasta with some bread. Steaks. Take a larger cut of meat like a strip loin. Basically a NY strip but in one big hunk. Cook it like you would a prime rib and then slcie it. We do that and add a horseradish mushroom sauce to it. Oh my. There are a lot of ways to fancy up stuff without making it expensive. We only plan for 1 or 2 breakfasts inside. Just in case it rains. Last year we made a bunch of breakfast burritos and froze them, wrapped in foil and took up. Heated them up on the way down to the dock. I stuck it in my bag. Heading out on a perfectly calm morning, fog coming off the water and eating a piping hot breakfast burrito. AWESOME!I know many people fish fish fish. We like to enjoy the food part too. Fresh walleye for lunch or dinner is absolutely awesome if done right."
