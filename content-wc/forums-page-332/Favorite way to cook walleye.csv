2774153,tigerwoods,2014-05-08 18:16:00,2,simply the best i have ever tasted
2774177,lassh,2014-05-08 18:23:00,553,"Coat with a little olive oil or butter, a dash of season salt, and quickly grill over hot grill till the fillets just start to curl and a little brown around the edges- clean, non-greasy and a delicious alternative to frying. Don't over cook or they will crumble throughout the grates."
2776265,prov1800,2014-05-09 09:32:00,5010,"Well sounds like you guys enjoy cooking your fish.I have to most days do shorelunches and the novelty has worn off.lol.think you can understand.love the fishing part but could do without the shorelunch.I dont eat any of it during the week, but my family still likes it so at home I will indulge myself.tigerwoods uses the andies absolute good stuff the regular and the hot.another great batter we discovered in florida at a bass pro shop.its called uncle bucks that stuff is awesome to and came with a recipe on the can.nothing special just dip it in vinegar and then in the batter.it has a great new flavor that I really enjoy."
2770401,Knoxabilly,2014-05-07 20:50:00,225,We've really been digging the Uncle Buck original fish batter mix. Shore lunch is a good staple but the Uncle Buck has a little kick to it. Throw a little Franks hot sauce on it and you got a great meal!
2770641,Limeyangler,2014-05-08 02:21:00,563,"I have tried lots of different ways, but it has to be my own take on the traditional deep fried. I basically use a milk eggwash with my own coating made from all purpose flour, cornmeal, panko crumbs, knorr vegetable bullion, lemon pepper seasoning, garlic seasoning. Throw in some double fried fresh homemade chips and you have a feast, can't beat it in my opinion."
2771217,bigwalleye1,2014-05-08 07:26:00,2632,"My ""wet batter"" favorite is ""Don's Chuckwagon"", made with beer or 7 up or super el-cheapo chmpagne and deep fried. It's very good with water, but it's the bomb with bubbles. The finer the bubbles, the better the result. I usually mix it a little on the thin side, the coating is lighter. Dry coating mix favorite depends on the day. I have my own flour-based ""shore lunch mix style"" flour based, but I have used and do like the Andy's cornmeal, Andy's Red, Frying Magic, Corn Flake crumbs. The cool part is going for a week and having something different each day. I just got the Uncle Buck, and I'll be looking for the Zatarains. Don't know if I've actually helped much. I like 'em all!!!!"
2771385,grapestomper,2014-05-08 07:52:00,41,"We make our own batter. 1 beer, 1 cup flour, garlic powder, red pepper, pepper, 1 teaspoon baking powder. Dry the fillets, coat with a little seasoned flower, shake the excess flower off. Dip in batter and fry up. Can't beat it. Very light batter. Don't be afraid of adding to much seasoning. More is better."
2771673,micropterus,2014-05-08 08:36:00,450,"Mother Nature prefers that you don""t gunkup one of her finest creations Dusting of Bisquick and into the frypan, butter or your favorite oil."
2771761,Lovetofish,2014-05-08 08:49:00,458,....and I add salt and pepper. Prefer to use our big shore lunch pans with butter over a low heat fire.
2772129,Pikeslayer8,2014-05-08 09:57:00,1460,"Pay special attention to this recipe, it comes from a man providing for his brood on the Goon. A man who has proven himself over and over of his kitchen prowness. A man with the walleyes swimming under his toes all day. The great and most powerful Limeyangler!!!!!!!!!!! Lol. You are the man! I think between the both of us, we got some ""kitchen cred"" on here.I gotta agree here with Limey and look ya all right in the eye in sayin...... Panko is your new best friend in walleye batter. We go with our wet batter consisting of flour, club soda, tobassco and lemon pepper with a hit of baking soda....stir till thin enough for proper coverage and then roll in panko and fry it in peanut oil and it comes out so crisp and and the walleye flavor is spectacular. Perfect for Walleye Tacos!!!"
2772489,Simple Man,2014-05-08 11:24:00,92,"1) Typically we deep fry most of the time.....cant ever go wrong with it that way!2) Foil Wrapped with tons of Butter and Lemon Pepper as previously stated. 3) Also, last year we got a recipe for ""Poor Man's Lobster"" before we left last year. I believe the recipe was intended for Lake Trout but we used it for everything and enjoyed it quite a bit. 4) I wrote down a recipe from someone here this winter called ""Hobo Stew"" that we are looking forward to trying this year.Hobo Stew:foiled walleye with butter, garclic, peppers, onions, and taters (add anything else like mushrooms, veggies etc as desired)you can obviously add whatever other fillers you want like corn, tomatoes, etc) cooked the grill in foil wrap."
2773537,Limeyangler,2014-05-08 16:02:00,563,"Thanks Pikeslayer .. OK walleye tacos are good too, made some a couple of years ago and took a pic, i think the pic is almost as good as it tasted!http://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...IMG_2405-1.jpg"
2773841,needtofish,2014-05-08 17:21:00,6,"90% of the time we use the bread crumb parmesan cheese recipe, but for the times when we think we want something different and want to eat a little healthier. We soak alder grilling planks for several hours while out fishing. Lay fillets on well soaked planks, with butter and lemon pepper. Keep an eye on them as they still can catch on fire. It is expensive to use these as they are a one time use, but good for a change."
2767561,labsrus,2014-05-07 10:48:00,557,"We do the traditional fish fry method Roll in pnacake batter Dip in egg Roll in regular bread crumbs We will sub Panko instead of Bread crumbs, little more crispy Secret is to keep the oil a temperature. Second secret is cold beer to go along with it. Been experimenting that last few years with IPA's So far I like em all The go to is Molson Candien."
2768537,bullhockey,2014-05-07 14:01:00,41,only way is to pan fry. by my son Steve
2768817,Blue Lk,2014-05-07 15:01:00,269,"My top 3 favorites.#1 Beer Batter#2 Beer Batter#3 Beer BatterIf it's not broke,don't fix it.I do prefer a bull bodied beer over regular brew,makes a tastier batter imho"
2768849,SinOrSwim,2014-05-07 15:10:00,1528,We use Zatarains Seasoned Fish Fri. You can buy it on-linehttp://www.mccormick.com/Zatarains/P...soned-Fish-FriHas to be this particular one though. We have tried some of the others and didn't like them. We have been taking this stuff up for 20 years and for the last 10 or so we have taken a couple other batters/mixes up with us to test against. The group as a whole always comes to the same conclusion. We like this one the best. It's usually not even close. We have had a few that were okay and some of those were mentioned in this thread. You can use it dry but we like to mix with beer.
2768865,Fishin Fun,2014-05-07 15:11:00,218,Rocky Madsen's Fish Crisp deep fried in peanut oil. Otherwise on the grill with butter and Lowry's season salt. Love it.
2769737,The Donger,2014-05-07 18:34:00,48,Pan fried in a touch of butter and just a bit of salt and pepper. Too me all that beer batter and other stuff hides the taste of a quality fish. That's just me though. You eat em how you like em and God bless you. Seven days in camp and seven meals of fish. Holy cow!
2770105,drew59,2014-05-07 19:44:00,87,A few years ago someone here mentioned Fryin Magic. My family has never looked back. Great stuff.
2770233,Yarhcaz,2014-05-07 20:15:00,1389,"I have tried almost everything and Fryin Magic is very very difficult to beat. Sometimes I might add one of the following Panko, Parmesan, or crushed Doritos but mostly just plain old fryin magic. If people just break down and try it I would be surprised if they didnt like it. I also broil, grill in foil, pan fry in butter, and bake it from time to time. I fish a lot so we eat Walleye at least once a week from Feb through November"
2770297,bigtimeelectric,2014-05-07 20:26:00,174,Absolutly Fryin magic is excellent stuff I also add corn flake crumbs. I shake the fillets dry.
2770393,Moondog,2014-05-07 20:49:00,362,If you can't fry it don't bother. and if you need to dip it. Worth the time and effort............http://www.food.com/recipe/tartar-sa...-oh-yes-170190
2765961,btmbncr,2014-05-06 23:46:00,492,"My wife and I agree,our favorite way is n to cook walleye is in Schilling Beer Batter Mix.Egg,milk and cracker crumbs,we like walleye as much this way as we like Cornflake crumbs.eggs/milk .Next then is pancake mix,beer and egg/milk wash.I love Cajun Blackened walleye but was unable to get a frying pan hot enough last trip to do this""right"".That was totally my fault but I have corrected that for our next trip.Tuffy,Cinders and Hanna love fresh fried walleye..Several people have said to me if reincarnation was real they want to come back to life as my/our dogs.Bill know known as Backtroller Billy"
2766385,Gregking,2014-05-07 06:57:00,2658,Shore lunch I like a batter mix with bud light Home I like to bake it in foil with butter and lemon pepper. Maybe a touch of lowerys salt depending on how long they have been frozen
2766433,Aaron-IN,2014-05-07 07:02:00,500,Deep fried in Lard.
2766777,Mike Kansas,2014-05-07 08:00:00,1463,ditto
2766857,Guest,2014-05-07 08:11:00,0,"Butter or olive oil, cover with lemon pepper or any other spice you crave, wrap the fillet in bacon and put on the grill. Be careful turning as it can fall apart. Wash down with an ice cold Blue and thank me later."
2766913,phishfearme,2014-05-07 08:16:00,1242,"place fillets on a grilling basket made for fish, spread some butter on both sides (or spray margarine) sprinkle each side with lemon pepper seasoning (NOT the seasoning with salt) and grill over a hot grill. make sure you spray the baskets with ""PAM for grilling"" to make cleanup easier. phish"
2767041,LoDo,2014-05-07 08:37:00,721,"We are usually Shore Lunch Cajun style! Def not opposed to try something different this trip. Keep the ideas coming. And as always a good Labatts to wash it down. A few of my guys prefer a good warm Schmidt. It's a long story, ongoing joke."
2767049,JayM5209,2014-05-07 08:38:00,1050,Salt and lemon/pepper the fillets -> dust with flour -> dreg thru egg/milk wash -> coat with Panko bread crumbs to which you've added Italian seasoning mix -> sautee using oil of your choice (the least amount you can get away with).My son adds a healthy dose of Parmesian cheese to the Panko crumbs. It works well but not being a big cheese person I skip it.P.S. #2: You really do need a Shiner bock with it!
2767089,oldfart,2014-05-07 08:44:00,21,"Andy's Red Fish Breading-deepfried in peanut oil-we take peanut oil on the fly-ins-it holds up better than veg oil(doesn't turn dark as fast) so cuts down on the ""oil changes"""
2767137,Lovetofish,2014-05-07 08:54:00,458,Fry a pound of bacon in that lard first.
