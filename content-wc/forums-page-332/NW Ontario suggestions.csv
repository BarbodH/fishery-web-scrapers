I know there's lots of choices so I figured I'd see what you all recomend. I'm a walleye, pike and lake trout guy having never fished musky or bass but they're on my list."
2774497,prov1800,2014-05-08 19:33:00,5010,"Well I can give you some lakes to go in the vermilon bay area.the species your looking for are all in eagle lake and cliff lake.theres also cedar lake which doesnt have lake trout but can launch into cliff lake which is across the the hwy #105.lac seul is just a 1/2 hr up the road from there with the best walleye and pike fishing you'll ever find.plus it has a good bass population.not sure when your planning to be up but muskie doesn't open till the third Saturday in june.do you want AP or housekeeping, expensive or mid range.there's a ton of places to stay.let me know.."

I'm in winnipeg working until end of sept on a 17 and 4 shift, so my days off I'll be spending out there fishing. All I need is something mid price range no AP, I can look after myself. I think eagle is on my hit list as is lac Seoul and or LOTW. I like the variety of fish they offer."

2774841,prov1800,2014-05-08 20:56:00,5010,"Lotw is a hour closer than VB, as narda mentioned is a good place as is sportsmans lodge and vermilion lodge. Check out clarkes northern lights on cedar lake, excellent fall fishing, lund outfitters with 50 hp and free bait and gas. Lost bay resort on cliff lake.real peacefull great lake trout, bass, muskie, good walleye but need to know how to get them, very clear water. I find the smaller lakes in the fall easier to fish as you dont have to travelling as far as the big lakes and you get the same results."
