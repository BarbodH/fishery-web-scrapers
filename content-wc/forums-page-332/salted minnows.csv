2770081,Ten Horse Johnson,2014-05-07 19:38:00,235,"My experience with salted minnows on Canadian fly in trips has shown that they are absolutely worth it and for us they have worked at least as well as live minnows. I say this as someone who has done 9 outpost fly ins, and the first three were with live minnows only, the the next two we had both live and salted and the rest after that were with salted minnows only. On the trips where we brought both, I would always use live while we still had some and then one day I was getting outfished by my buddy who was using salties. I switched over and started catching fish after not getting a bite for a while. Not saying that is totally scientific, but it had an impact on me. The biggest advantage of salties is that they don't die off, and they last longer as you can often catch multiple fish one them. Cost is huge too. We found that fatheads are the best type of minnow to salt, much better than shiners. They have more of a head that you can hook into and were just a bit more durable. I'm sure our lodge owner probably misses the three figure live bait sale we used to give him each trip, but whatever. The group I go with has been loyal to him for nearly 30 years going every year. On Canadian lakes, I actually prefer to use soft plastics anyhow now."
2770609,sek2691,2014-05-07 23:08:00,15,I used salted minnows last year for Walleyes and did awesome. We caught one after another just like the years we have used live ones. Here is a article about how to do your own. http://www.midwestoutdoors.com/magaz...alted-Minnows/

I read it somewhere on line, I think on WC which quoted the official laws. The last rule for Saskatchewan that I am familiar with (it has been a while) stated that remains after cleaning (offal) were legal for bait. Bill"
2763641,prov1800,2014-05-06 10:55:00,5010,"Totally legal, but not sure if were on the same wave length about were the gullet is located.its in the bottom of the mouth and you dont cut it into strips it comes out looking like a pork rind with two tails.been using them for years.legally."
2763657,prov1800,2014-05-06 10:59:00,5010,Suckers dont have a gullet like a walleye.

2763745,Jack77,2014-05-06 11:42:00,168,"The part I was talking about was the strip along the belly after you fillet a walleye. I have been told multiple times by different people that using any part of the walleye was illegal. My intention wasn't to get on you about it just to make you aware of what I had been told. I could be wrong, personaly I hope that I am."

2765201,phishfearme,2014-05-06 18:39:00,1242,"[QUOTE=NWwalleye;2765081]NO YOUR WRONG !!!!! I finally was able to dig out my letter from the MNR concerning the use of belly meat. the letter is from David Ballak, Biologist from the Chapleau District and is dated 2/11/1997 - I would post the entire letter but my scanner is on the blink. he states: ""The question of using belly meat to dress a lure. This practice is illegal in Ontario. No part of a game fish can be used as bait."" I recall other discussions with an Officer Maw concerning this when he ""visited"" our cabin and he confirmed this is not legal. that was at least 10 years ago. I asked him if it's ok to use the belly from filleted fish and he said ""how am I supposed to know that?"" I guess it makes sense. so, did the laws change? maybe - I'm not much of a historian but I can see arguments for and against either way. phish"
2765241,NWwalleye,2014-05-06 19:06:00,223,.prov1800 stated at least 10 years ago.. That would make it 2004 or so.You say your letter is from 1997 .. That's about 17 years ago. RIGHT ..The post in the other thread stated 2012 ..I would have to believe that the laws have changed ..
2765289,phishfearme,2014-05-06 19:18:00,1242,"the laws may have indeed changed - however, I will bet if you continue to ask this question of various MNR personnel you will continue to get different answers. look at the salted minnow thread - different answers as to weather you can bring them up from the US or not. we used belly meat for years - it's deadly - I think more for pike than walleye but deadly none the less. while at ray's lake in the 80's I was asked by the owner to help out a group who had been there for 3 days and only had caught a handful of fish. I spent a day with them casting belly meat and did quite well. I saw them the next day hacking on a small pike they had just caught to get the belly meat then thru the pike into the bush. that's when I started asking about the legality of using belly meat. so, if you kill and fillet a walleye for dinner then use the belly meat from the fish for bait, that's legal? to quote CO Donnie Maw ""how is he supposed to know (that you didn't just kill a fish for the belly meat)? phish"
2767297,law57,2014-05-07 09:33:00,1147,"I just use the minnows I get at the camp. They are fresh and lively. They are flown in on a little Piper Cub by the minnow trapper - and kept in a clean, cold stream.Yes - they seem expensive. But 2-3 dozen lasts me a day. I don't remember but I think that's abour $20. I don't keep track of it - it's part of the trip. The place I go isn't cheap - but I catch big walleye. I've taken some friends and they don't come back - too expensive. It's probabaly ~$200 more than where they used to go or where they go now. And the fish are much bigger.If you consider minnows just part of the cost of the trip - who cares if you spend another $100 once each year. And, you're supporting the camp owner.A quick story - 40 years ago I was fishing with a friend at one of the nuke plants on the WI side of Lake Michigan. We had brought some frozen spawn bags. But the fish wanted smelt. $12/dozen for 5-6"" smelt. That was a lot of money back then. I think I was making $5/hour.Some guys, from the twin cities, were near us and I heard one of them say: ""It will be a cold day in **** before I spend $12 for a dozen smelt"". We caught fish - they didn't. They drove 300 miles, rented motel rooms, stood out in the cold, catching nothing - because they were too cheap to spend another few dollars.How much do we spend on trips, boats, trucks, etc.? If the fish want live minnows - I give them live minnows. Do you want another story - about illegal bait? I don't want to bore everyone."
2761145,yoopertrout,2014-05-05 17:40:00,1172,"Now that we know that salted minnows are allowed in Canada, I thought I'd pass along the name of the company I just ordered from:http://minnesotabaitandtackle.com/ I ordered 1 gallon of salted fatheads, which should be roughly 1200 minnows. The price was $45 plus $15 for shipping. If I bought as many live ones from the owner of the lodge we are going to, it would have cost me $700. I wonder if it's worth buying any live ones? Thoughts?"
2761193,btyreprich,2014-05-05 17:51:00,1067,"I have always fished with live minnows from the lodge or just a plastic twister tail so I'd be very interested in hearing how these salted minnows work for you. If you can, try comparing the salted minnows to live minnows on your trip. I agree with you, the minnows you get from the lodges are very expensive."
2761209,yoopertrout,2014-05-05 17:56:00,1172,I will probably buy some live minnows just to experiment. I'll let you know.
2762545,Bigstorm,2014-05-06 05:53:00,799,"We have always taken salted minnows with us, but we also get a couple dozen live ones each day at the lodge. So far, we havent seen anything showing that salted works beeter than live (or the other way around). The nice thing about the salted minnows, they tend to last longer on the jig than a live minnow"
2762553,phishfearme,2014-05-06 05:55:00,1242,"let me provide a somewhat contrarian view to the use of salted minnows. I have salted my own (and froze them also - fatheads, shiners and creek chubs - using recipe's from this board) and also bought them for use in fly ins numerous times and have had poor results - or mixed results at best. placing one of these stiff little dead fish on a jig just doesn't cut it. jigging them up and down doesn't really resemble a real minnow and neither does trolling/casting them as they simply stay straight or twirl. I guess they do smell like the real thing - but the smell is mixed with salt and other chemicals. many times the belly breaks open - especially for the ones I've frozen, I think the freeze/thaw cycle weakens the belly. live minnows are indeed very expensive and also hard to keep alive - although I think that dead ones work better on a jig than the salted stiffies or frozen ones. when using live bait, we've gone to crawlers - much cheaper and much easier to keep and nearly as effective as live minnows - but let's face it, live minnows are the best. summary of my opinion based on lots of experience; best - live minnows next - crawlers next - live leeches next - dead but not salted or frozen minnows next - salted minnows phish P.S - by the way, if you still want to salt your own, get to know the bigger minnow dealers in your area, they will usually give you their dead ones."
2762881,tooski,2014-05-06 07:20:00,393,"Agree with the Phishman on all but the last line. I don't bother salting dead minnows. Never seems to work out. I live near Lake Erie and have my own 200 gallon tank for shiners (perch fishing). I salt a lot of minnows for my Canada trips and I always use live minnows. They definitely stay ""minnowish"" longer on the hook."
2763249,prov1800,2014-05-06 08:48:00,5010,"As far as live bait goes you cant beat it.but early jigging season rubber will work fine or trolling and casting plastic cranks.my favourite bait to use in the jigging season is a walleye gullet I always use a 3"" hollow body in a shad color topped with a gullet for smell and taste.the only way your going to loose that gullet is if you get hung up or a pike bites you of.when I clean w alleyes I always freeze the gullets and use them after or fresh caught.I wouldnt worry about screwing with salted minnows one gullet will last you all week if you dont use.but when it comes to the mid summer hump bite nothing beats a 4"" daze minnow no matter what it costs you.no use cheaping out on the most important item on your trip.go see a bait dealer and buy by the gallonmuch cheaper and bettet quality bait to then what some camps sell to there guests.if your on your way up hwy 105, stop in at clarkes northetn lights camp they have the best bait in the whole area.or in earfalls gary at evergreen lodge has some good bait to."
2763401,NathanH,2014-05-06 09:37:00,697,"I agree with the other folks. Give them a try but I think their more trouble then they are worth. I would use crawlers for the same price you would get about 500. I opted for Crawlers on my last trip we went the opening weekend and we caught a lot of fish using crawlers they even out did minnows most of the time...which seemed odd, but I now have more confidence in crawlers on a jig, which is great because minnows are expensive and a pain to keep alive for long periods."

Maybe it would be better to use ""sucker"" gullet. Other than that all the things provo said about using gullet is true. Catches just as many fish using gullet as minnows and the gullet will not come off. Cut into long thin strips about 3"" long, you can even get fancy and split the tail end of it for a little more action."
