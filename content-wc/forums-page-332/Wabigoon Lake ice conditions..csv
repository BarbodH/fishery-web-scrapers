2778001,115 optimax,2014-05-09 18:49:00,650,Can't watch the video because you have music on there that You Tube is saying something about copy right infringement.
2778289,prov1800,2014-05-09 20:11:00,5010,Same here.
2778361,Travis Schallock,2014-05-09 20:42:00,37,log out of youtube and it should work
2778649,Limeyangler,2014-05-10 03:52:00,563,Thanks Travis.Did Travis's suggestion work guys?
2778745,NWwalleye,2014-05-10 06:04:00,223,works fine for me ...Went and took a look at Clay Lake last night .. ice is off on most of the lake ..
2778793,Limeyangler,2014-05-10 06:20:00,563,That's awesome! Is that because of the current from the Wabigoon river flowing in?
2778801,NWwalleye,2014-05-10 06:23:00,223,I would have to think so ... The river is flowing over the banks.. All the warmer water and current must help out the earlier than most lakes ice out ..Will give Carmon a chance to try out his new boat early ...
2778873,Limeyangler,2014-05-10 07:31:00,563,"Lol ..yeah, he needs all the practice he can get!"
2749513,Limeyangler,2014-05-01 22:05:00,563,"Hi all,Just a quick update on the ice conditions up here in Dryden. I live on Lake Wabigoon and went down this evening (Thursday 1st May) to check the conditions. There was 2'4"" of ice off my skidoo tracks. Some areas were one foot of water with one foot of clear ice. Its gonna be close this yearâ€¦.i'm not too sure it will all be gone in 2 weeks. Here is the video and pics i took out front this evening.1st Mayhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmdu9qKJM4I7th Mayhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1ZEe9I8a3g8th Mayhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-8DLc1DgSUMay 10th updatehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmBC2s3IeQ8"

2750121,Limeyangler,2014-05-02 07:13:00,563,"Thanks Prov, Optimax inspired me to do it, he was asking for some pics the other day on another post."
2750145,Limeyangler,2014-05-02 07:16:00,563,"Thanks Gord, yup a week should be the proof of the pudding so to speak, but it's looking like we will be watching out for opener icebergs!The pike fishing in front of my house should be awesome though! Some years get some really big ones doing their thang right off the shore here , giant sucker minnows and slip bobbers usually get them!"
