1081394,Mikep007,2009-02-16 06:15:00,77,"Lobo,I welcome your viewpoint. I think I was talking specifically about walleyes in August -- I've been to two main locations (river and lakes) for four years in mid-August and all the lodge owners say the walleyes are tougher because they migrate or go deep. I've done great for them in Ontario (D'Alton Lake with Wilderness North and Beattie/Oswald with Air Ivanhoe) but those trips were early June. Other species (bass and pike) were just fine in August. If anyone has had different experience (tons of walleye) at this time of year, would love to know about it. It's also tough to read the subjective postings about various experiences (not being critical) -- when someone says ""it's bad"" does that mean 2 fish a day or 25? I think some people hear about the great wilderness experience and expect them to jump in the boat all day. For example, our last trip to Pickerel River in August, we averaged about 10 fish a day fishing about 12 hours a day, mostly 12 - 20"" bass and 18""-26"" pike (one was 28"")...rained for an hour once a day and the water was generally higher than normal. I'd like more but is that a realistic experience? Appreciate any feedback!"
1081399,lobo1,2009-02-16 06:44:00,734,"I understand Mike and I am not trying to slam the east side - I'd much rather save 1200 miles of driving to NW Ontario and fish somewhere near Wawa or Chapleau but in ""my experiences"" and many of others that I know - the two just don't compare on any level - with the exception of maybe the scenery. You pick any of the better fisheries in NW Ontario and go to a fairly non pressured area of that lake and on most AUGUST days, fishing as you described 12 hours a day etc, I would expect to catch at LEAST 50 fish myself -- if not a hundred or more WALLEYES on jigs....this is no BS or propaganda - just fact. There is no way I would drive 1100-1200 miles each way of the fishing wasn't unbelievable. I am not promoting any one lake or camp - purposely - but there are tons of places to go that can provide fishing that is really indescribable - some people just dont want to believe it. If you want specific examples please leave me your email or maybe look into some of the better fisheries in the NW and read the countless posts. I am sure you can narrow the threads down to the month of august or maybe befriend one of the many guides or camp owners or regular fishermen that post repeatedly about these areas. This is not exaggerated fishing numbers. We almost always catch 50-100+ fish before shore lunch sometimes many more. If we are hunting trophy pike our numbers go down but overall pounds of fish probably stays somewhere near the same. I am sure there is some good fishing on the east side but I like to catch a lot of fish with a ""virtual"" guarantee that it will happen - not a maybe - so I drive a long ways and then sometimes still get into a plane and go further north yet! To me it's well worth the drive - Like I said - I can catch a couple limits of walleyes here at home most any day of the year - I am looking for something else when I go to NW Ontario. I don't keep track but I am sure I put over a 1000 hours a year on the water - most of it great lakes - -when I go to Ontario - I don't want to ""fish"" - I want to ""catch"".........I fish here all year long. GOOD LUCK!"
1081432,walleycrazed,2009-02-16 08:17:00,13,Mike It sounds like your goingLet us know what happensI have had some friends go there and want to hear your honest assessment and what you tried. Just curious why you decided to head there?Good luck!
1081689,Mikep007,2009-02-17 06:37:00,77,"Lobo,Though I have never traveled to the NW, it's certainly something I'm open to doing. We had a blast with Wilderness North out of Armstrong at D'Alton Lake and caught the kind of fish you describe (though it's more north than NW). Our main challenge is the drive (I'm in Columbus Ohio) and even going up East there for us is 12 hour drive one way. Appreciate the tip and will figure out a way to head that direction!Walleye,We picked Dog this year because we had spent 5 years on the Pickerel (loved it) and wanted to explore a new area to us. Plus it's roughly within our 12 mile drive limit, the facilities looked good on the web and we spoke with Dave the owner several times. We also like the option of trout and whitefish and the portage lakes as well. This board is a great source of information and I'd just like to see more ""review"" like comments to help all of us make better fishing and lodging decisions -- Lobo's NW input is great, for example. On the Air Ivanhoe board, I ended up posting our weekly catch by day, with weather and fish sizes -- I think that helps us compare locations and trips. Every year we spend hours discussing whether this trip was better than that, only to discover we really didn't keep track very well!! LOL"
1081690,Mikep007,2009-02-17 06:39:00,77,"Lobo, my email is [email protected]. Happy to get ideas from you and exchange stories, always good to get the veteran view! If anyone wants feedback on Totomenai (Whitefish Lake), Wanikewin (Pickerel), Wilderness North or Air Ivanhoe, let me know!"
1082845,Mikep007,2009-02-22 12:21:00,77,Still trying to find someone that has been to Dog Lake near Missanabie. Anyone?
1082896,joeman79,2009-02-22 17:10:00,417,"If I could only catch 10 walleye a day in Canada in August I would NEVER GO!! I love August fishing in Canada. The wallaye will be stacked up on the deeper drop-offs, and you can slam them on a jig and crawler, or drift with a spinner and worm or minnow. Granted a guy may have a bad day due to the weather but if I was going somewhere and spending that much money, I would go somewhere you know is gonna be good. I would not go where it might be good. To many good places to fish to go to a maybe."
1082927,Mikep007,2009-02-22 19:33:00,77,"I guess I just suck as a fisherman, then! There have been spots where I can go to pull in 80 largemouth less than 15"" by lunch but I'm not counting that. I'm looking for a nice balance of quality and quantity. Aside from Lobo's good advice to go far afield to more remote lakes, does anyone have anything concrete to say about NE Ontario lakes and rivers other than ""I catch millions by 1 pm""? Where do you go in August in NE Ontario and what kind of numbers/quality do you bring in? All the lodge owners tell me come before end of June or after September 15, which is fine advice.In any case, the scenery is gorgeous, there's no cell phone or computers, and it's still a great time, even if I only do 10 a day."
1082950,lobo1,2009-02-22 23:09:00,734,I'll see if I can get Lenray to chime in here - I know he has been thru this area quite a bit. also have you searched the archives under Dog Lake and Missinabie? maybe read the old threads that wawajake used to post here he fished regularly in that area but maybe not on Dog Lake
1083025,Mikep007,2009-02-23 09:34:00,77,"Hey Steve, much appreciated there. Yes, there are few postings but nothing really substantive. The lodge owner Dave is getting us some references from folks but wanted to get other points of view as well. Hey, if no one has been in years, then maybe we'll nail them this year! This is the first time of used this board and it's a great way of getting advice. Thanks for the help and all the advice."
1070200,phidelt157,2008-12-25 19:47:00,191,"We are considering a drive in to Dog Lake near Missanabie (not Thunder Bay) in July of 09. In particular, we were looking at Fox's Den Lodge. Does anyone have any information on either the lake, the portage lakes, or this outfitter? Thanks in advance, 157"
1070256,Guest,2008-12-26 14:24:00,0,"Two of us went to Dog Lake and stayed at Foxs Den Lodge. The facilities were OK but we received very little attention from the camp manager. We found the fishing to be very poor on Dog Lake. My fishing partner in a week did not catch a single fish on that lake (he is a very experinced Canada fisherman), I only caught a few fish and they were very small. We caught almost all our fish in portage lakes and then it was very slow. As you can tell I cannot reccomend this lake or lodge. It appears you live in Indianapolis area, I live in Carmel if you would like to contact me on this subject."
1070264,lenray,2008-12-26 15:22:00,467,The lake has the correct name. Guys who really know the lake can catch fish. We fish smaller outlying lakes that we use a quad to get into. Some are 5-15 miles out in the bush from Dogger. It is a nice area with the game preserve coming right up to the town limits with many bear and moose to be seen. Maybe look at Ash Lake out a few miles. If ya really want the fish go up into NW ontario and go up the rivers like we do and portage and camp 25 miles from where ya leave your truck and catch until your arms hurt. We left Dogger behind 10-12 years ago.
1070299,fishergirlz,2008-12-26 20:50:00,1,"My friends and I stayed at Fox's Den on two occasions. The first time we went was at the end of July, the weather was hot perfect for Pike fishing! We caught lots of nice Pike in the day and some nice Walleye at sunset. The next visit was late Aug. again good fishing, especially in the portage lakes. The cabin was clean and the lodge, meals, and scenery were great!"
1070361,lobo1,2008-12-27 15:17:00,734,"We tried this area one year - about ten years ago and did not fare too well for numbers of fish or size. Also I did NOT use the outfit you are asking about and am not ripping them in particular. Maybe if you hit it just right........at ice out - peak moon phase - prestorm etc. I would consider this an area of ""pressured fishing"" and plan accordingly with subtle live bait presentations etc. good luck lobo1"
1070370,lenray,2008-12-27 17:21:00,467,Listen very closely to what lobo1 says and has written. I have seen pics of this man's fishing and he knows what he is doing with a pole line and bait. Read between the lines or just plain read the lines--if 777 things line up perfectly including the sun and all of the planets and all of their moons you might not have to eat all of the fish sticks you brought up with you. BUT DO BRING FROZEN MRS. PAULS WITH YOU.
1070506,lobo1,2008-12-29 04:05:00,734,"Not sure about all that Len but I am quite sure that I have learned to enjoy the journey a ""little"" further down the road to where most people haven't been yet.....rewards for the patience of the trip (miles)always have paid off - as you know very well! take care - steve"
1071202,pike50plus,2009-01-02 14:13:00,584,"Much better fishing lakes in that area, that would be a no chioce for me!"
1081349,Mikep007,2009-02-15 20:15:00,77,"I've been fishing in Canada for 8 years now, once to twice a year with two fly-ins. I've been to Totomenai at Whitefish Lake, Wanikewin on the Pickerel River and fly-ins with Wilderness North and Air Ivanhoe. I've travelled with guys that have fished Ontario for 30 years.I've booked with Fox's Den for June 21 and am willing to give them a try. I can't believe a 14,000 acre Ontario Lake with seven portage lakes contains no fish (judging from these posts). I think if you're going to answer phidelt197's question, you at least need to state more details.The fact is walleye fishing generally is poor in Ontario in August (hot summer months), unless you're close to the great lakes or go downrigger deep. The last three years I've fished Ontario in August and caught exactly three walleye (but killed on perch, bass and pike). Any given week can just plain suck as well -- all fishermen know it's about weather and location on the water and none of you (naybe fishergirlz) have really talked about the timing, water conditions or weather patterns. Can anyone that's been to Dog Lake give us timing, reasonable stats on fishing and more details on their experience?"
1081376,lobo1,2009-02-16 03:07:00,734,"I really don't like to flat out disagree but your statement that fishing is generally poor in Ontario in august is not accurate. Many a 100 fish days are had in august on quality waters if you choose to fish them.....and this can still be done with light tackle and jigs - not riggers etc. This area described in this thread can make for a good vacation - I would certainly go there again but now I would know going in - to NOT expect great fishing - at any time of the year. Catching a ton of fish or a shot at a trophy CPR may not be what everybody wants in a vacation - just keep in mind to bring some groceries and you will be all set. This is not to say that there wont be any good fishing - because there will be - but FOR ME - I would have in my brain that the fishing will be slow - then I might be pleasantly surprised. This theory is totally opposite for where I fish now. Cold front, heat wave, T-storms, may, june, july, august - I am catching fish - period - and lots of them. If I don't catch a ton a fish - then I would be very disappointed - but this hasn't happened yet. It's just a choice in how you want to spend your personal time and how you want to spend your vacation dollars - I like to catch a ton a fish and get an occasional trophy (picture) and not have to work real hard at it. If I want to catch a handful of fish each day I can happily do that at home. This is not a ding on this area - as long as those that go are prepared for what is there - they can still have a great time - without disappointment. lobo1"
