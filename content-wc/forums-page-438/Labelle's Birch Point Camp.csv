1435918,drew59,2012-05-15 19:04:00,87,"My wife and I were there a couple of years ago in the fall. Nice people and adequate accomodations. We caught lots of walleyes but most were over the size limit. Nice pike were plentiful. You MUST have ""the chip"" to find the rock piles. We wouldn't have caught squat without it. We weren't fond of the one fish per day limit."
1436074,Shotgun,2012-05-16 06:12:00,759,"Have fished there about four times the most recent three years ago. Accomodations are ok, staff nice people, fishing produced more pike than anything. At that time boats were the nicest camp boats of any place I've been. Large Prince Crafts with 40 hp 4s mercurys. Nice places to have shore lunches. If you have trouble walking difficult path to walk to boat dock. Would go there again if wanting to catch more pike than walleye."
1436083,NathanH,2012-05-16 06:25:00,697,Yikes I am going to the same area different lodge in 3 days. Not the report I wanted to see on the area. I will be sure to let you know what it was like and what worked or didnt work for us.
1436216,Shotgun,2012-05-16 11:01:00,759,"Fish an area they call the Three Sisters, which are islands. Around the islands always produced a few fish. As I recall three to four miles from the lodge. Around north of the lodge is a good place also for northern, fish along the weed beds. Good luck."
