1436404,adempsey,2012-05-16 15:48:00,963,"I labeled my most productive fishing spots on the Anglers Atlas map.I have been to Lady Evelyn in late June/early July and mid-August.We typically fish for walleye in 8 - 14 FOW in the mornings and evenings. Biggest fish were in those depths are near a nice drop off to 20+ FOW. Smaller eater-sized fish in the bays.Island saddles and mid-lake humps are always good too.For pike we just pitched to weeds along the shoreline. Didn't have a lot of success though, but they're around.Smallmouth are in the rock piles/shoals.There are plenty of deadheads around as well, but never fished them too much.The lodge owners should be able to help you out with tips."
1399842,Nanuk,2012-02-27 10:27:00,6,"Hi, I am looking at fishing Lady Evelyn Lake, any suggestions on which camp to stay at?"
1399850,micropterus,2012-02-27 10:42:00,450,"Prefer GardenIsland because of the location. Janice died so I don't know who will run the kitchen at Red Pine, but they are all good people."
1399870,adempsey,2012-02-27 11:38:00,963,"That's sad news about Janice. Although I never stayed at Red Pine, I had talked to her a few times at various outdoor shows and have been interested in staying at the lodge one day. I wish them all the best.As for the original question, I would stay at any one of them. They all have relatively good reputations.Ellen Island is the only viable option for housekeeping, although I am still curious about the camp near the dam. Not sure if that is operating or what. For American Plan, any of the other three are good. Island 10, Garden Island and Red Pine Wilderness Lodge are all excellent choices. Island 10 is the least expensive, but you wouldn't know it based on their lodgings, meals and equipment. Garden Island does have a great location on the lake. Red Pine offers your own personal dock and I believe each cabin is a complete housekeeping cabin with full kitchen."
1399902,doubleheader,2012-02-27 12:37:00,2652,"I booked a scouting mission (3 days) to Ellen Island Camp on Lady Lake Evelyn in June. Can't wait, if it's anything like what I've researched I'll book 2 weeks for 2013. There are only 4 lodges on the entire lake, with Island 10 being the only lodge on the west end and the others on the east end are Red Pine, Ellen Island, and Garden Island. All but Ellen Island specialize in the American plan. I've read nothing but good reviews on all of them. I've met James, the owner of Red Pine, as as was mentioned his wife died tragically last year. He gave me every indication that they would still be offering the American plan this year. I've also met Jeff and jane the owners of Ellen Island, they seem like they will be great hosts. We just don't care for the American Plan, going for 2 weeks it gets too pricey for some in our group."

1400221,Nanuk,2012-02-28 11:03:00,6,"Thanks to all, I am looking for housekeeping so Ellen Island is the place to be. Their cottages and boats look nice."
1400261,Redear,2012-02-28 11:55:00,40,"White Pine is the camp before you go up to the lakeat the dam.There housekeeping and have good prices and boats.Great if you want to fish the river and only go up to the lake a few times.you have to pay to have the boat portaged or trailered up the hill 100yrds and put in Lady Evelyn was 14 bucks in 2004 now ?,Nice owners and took great care of everything when we were there.Ps we went from there to Franks Falls other end of the lake for the day on one tank of gas with 2 big boys in it with a 15 yama 4 stroke.Fred"
1414035,willy123,2012-03-30 13:50:00,1,"Have been to Lady E. past two summers, both times mid June. Last year at Island 10, very good accomodations, equipment, staff, and location but mediocre food. Our group of 5 agreed we would not go back. Previous year at Ellen Island, outstanding staff, equipment, accomodations and owners. If you are looking for housekeeping, it gets a very high recommendation from our group."
1414042,micropterus,2012-03-30 14:10:00,450,Chef Michael will be at Garden Island again this year. This is a very good thing.
