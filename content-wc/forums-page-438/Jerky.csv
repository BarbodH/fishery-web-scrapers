1436149,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-05-16 08:36:00,138,"Time to make jerky for the trip. What is your favorite recipe? Here is mine: 1 1/2 to 2 pounds of lean critter meat 2/3 cup Worcestershire sauce 2/3 cup soy sauce 2 teaspoons ground black pepper 2 teaspoons onion powder 1 teaspoon liquid smoke 2 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 tablespoon honeyCut back on the red pepper flacks if you don't like it hot. Slice the meat with the grain about 1/4 inch strips. Mix brine ingredients in a gallon ziploc bag. Place meat strips in brine. Move the meat around so the marinade is evenly distributed around it. Seal bag, working out as much air as possible. Lay bag flat and refrigerate for 3 to 6 hours. Drain the strips and place on drying racks. Place racks in front of box fan in a cool place and dry for 12 to 15 hours. It's ready when the strips crack when you bend them.I don't use heat when drying. Just a couple of box fans and drying racks. Even on low heat it melts the fat and really changes the taste.I got this recipe from Alton Brown's Good Eats show."

My next batch I'm going to put into Bradly Digital smoker with only about 1 hour of hickory smoke at 180deg and continue heat until dry. This makes me hungry, have to start batch tonight."
1436358,fishinnut 3446,2012-05-16 14:40:00,638,"Walleye_Wrangler,When you say no heat,does it give it a bad taste?As JJJMN, I also have a Bradley smoker,and was thinking the same thing about smoking it alittle before?"
1436477,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-05-16 18:43:00,138,"No, it doesn't taste bad. Just tastes different. Fat starts to renders at about 100-115F. When you use heat to dry the jerky it renders the fat in the meat and you get a different flavor. You can really tell the difference. It even looks different.I'm going to try and use real smoke at low temperature. I just haven't came up with a good way of doing it ."

1436923,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-17 15:15:00,235,"My recipe: pick some up at the gas station for the drive up. Once at camp, diet switches to fish and potatoes for several days."
