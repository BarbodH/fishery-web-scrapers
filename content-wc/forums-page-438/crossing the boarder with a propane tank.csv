1436107,TexasMike,2012-05-16 07:30:00,7,I am wondering if I can cross the boarder with a propane tank for my fish fryer or not???
1436121,JJJMN,2012-05-16 07:56:00,153,Been doing it for 20 years without a problem.
1436134,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-05-16 08:12:00,138,We bring one every year. No problems
1436177,LOW1,2012-05-16 09:20:00,2828,I do it at least once a year and never had a problem. The cost of a refill in the states (if you shop around) is half the cost it is in Canada.
1436208,Catman59,2012-05-16 10:50:00,345,x2 never a problem
1436302,Shellback,2012-05-16 13:24:00,8083,I found it cheap to refill in Canada.
1436313,LOW1,2012-05-16 13:43:00,2828,I must go to the wrong places. It was $25 cdn where I went last summer and locally here its $13 at the bulk distributor.
1436446,TexasMike,2012-05-16 17:35:00,7,Thanks for the help. Last year we took an electric fish fryer and it took a long time to heat up and then get hot again after every batch of fish.
