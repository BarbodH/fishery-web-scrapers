1420695,v-bay gord,2012-04-13 16:11:00,3168,"Back in ""the day""....30 years ago....if it was a cold spring you could pretty much count on fishing the Bear Narrows, Rice Bay area of Eagle (if you were staying on the east end). A normal spring might have the fish further north such as Long Island, Frog-Head Bay areas. A year like this year (unless it remains cold for the next month) I would bet on the fish being in Mukluk Bay, and Stanton Bay, Stanton Island areas....perhaps even into Spring Bay. That doesn't mean you couldn't head a bit west from where you are to fish the Meridian Bay, Muskeg Bay section. Surely you will get some advice from where you are staying. Minnows on Little Joe spinners, Lindy rigs or trolling some cranks would all work. We used to fish some really shallow water back then, on that end which is much different than on the VBay end of Eagle....of course the water is clearer here."
1420788,tackleman,2012-04-13 20:22:00,444,"hi vbay gord, i'm going to vbay tomorrow to drop off my boat top for repair at garry parkes, i'm going to try and meet you at your lodge, maybe i'll bring my map so you can mark a few spots for me. we always fish the west arm in the spring and haven't been past the entrance to clearwater lake so any thing that you could mark would be new water to me."
1420807,v-bay gord,2012-04-13 21:13:00,3168,I should be here......look forward to your visit.!
1421605,Danbear,2012-04-16 09:44:00,72,"Wrangler only fished your side of Eagle once, I have been fishing the West Arm since and won't go back to the other side. When we did fish your side in 2005 we had luck on the southwest side of Net Island, drifting the humps off the west end of Schroeder Island and casting the weeds in Eldorado Bay. It was our first Canada trip and we had miserable weather the first full week of June, howling winds, side ways rain and temps in the 40's. The weather finally changed our last 2 days temps shot into the 70's and we caught more fish in one day than we did all week. Good Luck."
1421726,fishinnut 3446,2012-04-16 14:07:00,638,"Danbear,you went that far?I have been looking to do a little more scouting but don't know if I want to venture that far,how long did it take you?And I would'nt want to get caught in that crap we did in Sept.if I was to go down there."
1421791,Danbear,2012-04-16 16:08:00,72,"I think I made it down to Eldorado Bay in an hour or less, having GPS on my new locator makes it alot easier and quicker, don't have to stop and look at the map all the time. I don't think its worth the ride as I keep finding good spots in the West Arm, far as we go now is the narrows at the bottom of Portage Bay. Haven't made it to the west end of west arm yet, maybe this will be the year and I agree I don't want to be out in that weather we were out in last Septemeber either, but at least we can say we went out.Down to 116 days till we leave. Hope we can hook up again some year.Take CareDan"
1436406,swany_jd,2012-05-16 15:53:00,9,"I'm also headed to Eagle Lake this year for the first time after exclusively fishing Lac Seul. Spent the last 5 years fishing in the Sioux Lookout area with my buddies, but my brother and I are taking my Dad up for his 60th birthday to hopefully show him some good fishing on Eagle. I appreciate all the info provided in the thread. Just curious if it's possible to land on any perch in Eagle too? Mostly targeted walleye & pike up in Lac Seul, but wanted to try and find some tasty perch this year if possible. We're staying at Big Eagle the 2nd week of June. Any general advice on Eagle Lake on top of previous posts is definitely welcome. 3+ weeks and counting!"
1419037,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-04-10 10:14:00,138,We are heading to Eagle Lake for the first time. We have fished out of Sioux Lookout for 15 years and decided to try something new. I would love some advice and or a couple of hot spots to look for. We are staying near where the Eagle River comes out of the lake. Thanks in advance.
1419137,Sutsgold,2012-04-10 12:57:00,219,"Walleye wrangler, what time of year are you headed up?"
1419149,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-04-10 13:17:00,138,June 1st
1420144,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-04-12 13:07:00,138,Doesn't anyone fish Eagle lake? Bluff asks about Wabakimi and he gets 9 pages of responses! I'm feeling a little neglected.
1420175,Guest,2012-04-12 14:02:00,0,"The Walleye fishing just gets better and better and the Musky fishing in the Fall is outstanding. Now, having said that, I would caution anyone new to the lake to understand that Eagle is a huge lake. Wind and wind direction can be a big factor in determining where to fish. I have been lucky enough to fish Eagle lake in May, July and September and the fishing has been very good each of those times. The slot limit has been a big factor in the increasing walleye numbers. We fish out of Temple Bay Lodge. Good Luck"
1420473,v-bay gord,2012-04-13 07:56:00,3168,"I fish Eagle Lake all the time but closer to Vermilion Bay. I did guide for years out of North Shore Lodge which is close to where I think you are staying (Fin & Feather?) but that was 20 years ago. For what it's worth, in early June I probably would be fishing Rice Bay, Mukluk Bay, Spring Bay and Stanton Bay......and areas in between. You need to be concerned about getting to these areas without hitting a rock.....there are many in that area of Eagle Lake......some marked, some not. If you are near Vermilion Bay and have an hour to kill I would be happy to go over a map with you. Better yet, next time stay closer to V-Bay ()"
1420568,NARDA 1,2012-04-13 11:06:00,636,I've fished Eagle yearly for 23 years but am not very familiar with that part of the lake and have fished mostly in the fall. Which is why I didn't respond. I fish mostly in the Vermillion Bay area.
1420627,Sutsgold,2012-04-13 13:02:00,219,"Wrangler, we fish eagle in late may. We usually focus on shorelines and around islands. Best luck for both walleye and bass have been small to medium yellow, chartruse, and perch colored crankbaits. We have never had just a spot, and every year through this tech we find the ""spot"" for that particular years weather, water depth, and wind."
1420643,fishinnut 3446,2012-04-13 14:17:00,638,"Wrangler,I did'nt respond because I also fish the Vermillion Bay area,but always go down to Portage Bay very good area but still looks like a hike from where you are?"
1420682,Limeyangler,2012-04-13 15:45:00,563,"Hey WR,I have been fishing the area that V-Bay Gord has mentioned(ie....Rice bay and beyond)Only problem is i do not Fish Eagle in spring....ironically i head to where you normally go....Lac Seul!"
