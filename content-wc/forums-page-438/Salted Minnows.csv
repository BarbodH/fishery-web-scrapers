We have a group of 10, I buy 1/2 gallon of minnows and freeze them in bags with salt(about 25-30 minnows each bag) enough salt to cover all minnows. I have about 15-17 bags and go through about 4-5 quarts of salt. Then I freeze them in zip lock bags then I vacuum seal them(We camp so vacuum seal prevents water getting to them)"

1435936,Rippin Bite,2012-05-15 19:35:00,726,no difference from what i can see
1436002,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-15 21:08:00,235,"There are several threads on this you can find with a search, but I will say that we have stopped bringing live minnows on our fly in trips after having equal success with salted minnows. Recommend fatheads over shiners."
1436005,Guest,2012-05-15 21:20:00,0,"We went to canada two years ago, Alot of our minnows did not survive a 1 hour trip from bait store to resort, to many in a bag I think, anyway, we salted them , froze them, and used later in the week, Caught just as many fish with the frozen ones. Try a little garlic salt also."
1436087,Bigstorm,2012-05-16 06:35:00,799,Agreed
1436094,new hips,2012-05-16 07:03:00,498,"Tried them last year, we had brought crawlers, but someone left about 6 dozen in the camp freezer. My opinion, they seemed to work better, these were shiners about 4-5 long. They had about 15-20 in each container, just keep them frozen and take a couple containers with you for a days fishing. Easier then keeping the crawlers cold all day. Usually the bigger ones worked better then the small ones."

I have always used salt minnows. I get them at a bait shop in Fond du Lac, WI for about $1 a dozen...three inch fatheads. I get them for a different trip in mid-June and then keep them cool in my basement until I leave for Press Lake. No problem. I have not had any problem catching LOTS of walleyes on salt minnows. If I think I may not be doing as well as I should, I will buy a couple of dozen live ones at the camp and see if there is any difference. I don't think I have ever seen any significant change. The other bait I use, primarily for trolling, is a part of a nightcrawler on a little joe spinner with a beaded trolling sinker 36"" above the hook/spinner. Do NOT use more than 1/2 a crawler or the little walleyes will simply have a free lunch on you. Crawlers also work on jigs...same deal, use only 1/2 and thread them on the hook. You will be there earlier than I, so maybe the crawlers will not be necessary, but they are cheap and easy to keep, so it may be worth it to take a few along. I have fished right next to boats where one is fishing minnows and the other crawlers and the crawlers are outfishing minnows (live or salt) about 6 to 1. But, as I mentioned, the time of year may be the catalyst. When I'm there, if the weather is anywhere near normal, the walleyes are on the reefs...moving up and down from 30' to 3 or 4' on mid lake humps. Could be very different in mid June...you likely already know that...I just didn't know if this was your first trip to Press, so I may have over-explained (us ex-teachers are all alike). BTW: I love Press Lake. I have fished 20 lakes in nothern Ontario over the years and have now narrowed it down to two: Press and Pashkokogan (near Pickle Lake). Owners are great, Barb and Gerry and I really enjoy their son, who is now in college. OK I will shut up."
1436373,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-05-16 14:54:00,84,"This is probably going to be a stupid question. If you buy minnows that are already salted in a package, like at Bass Pro, will these work as well? Is it better to make you own? How much salt do you put on them? I have never tried anything like this before and kind of feel like a rookie asking these questions. If anybody could give me some direction I would appreciate it."
1436379,cuamb,2012-05-16 15:00:00,203,I drain the water from the minnow bucket and pour the minnows in a large freezer bag. Add enough Borax soap to cover them and then I top them off with a little garlic salt. Throw them in the freezer until you are ready to use them. Borax soap does not dry them out as much as salt.
1436395,camp chef,2012-05-16 15:24:00,915,preserved minnows from Magic products in Amherst Wisc. come in a 1#ag and require no refrigeration.They work great and stay on the hook like minnow jerky. You can find them online.
