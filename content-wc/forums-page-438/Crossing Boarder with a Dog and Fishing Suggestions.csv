Our Abby, a Llewellin Setter would drive you crazy in the boat when she was young but great fishing partner now. We also take our cat Gizmo with us on our trip to Canada. Our other cat Turbo who is gone now actually like being on our boat and would go fishing with us. She would walk around on the gunnels while we fished. I think that having a ""friendly"" dog in a vehicle crossing the border tends to soften the attitude of the border officers. BOB"

1436418,Blue Lk,2012-05-16 16:28:00,269,http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/.../1331876307796Good Luck keeping that Lab from trying to retieve your lures every cast.LOL
1436451,Rivratz,2012-05-16 17:47:00,105,"Did you check with the outfitter first if a dog is allowed. I'm pretty sure customs will want to see all current vaccination documents only. Especially rabies. Better check first. I would love to bring my lab, he would be in dog heaven. But, I would never bring him because he would just be a pain in the rear to accommodate his needs. A thousand and change miles drive each way, plus the constant care when you get there. No thank you! I'd rather bring my wife! Not!!! Sorry, the dog would go! This is my vacation, not hiis, or hers! He's got it easier than me all year. So does she!"
1436453,Jimmy Jig,2012-05-16 17:49:00,1905,The only thing needed is a record of the rabies shot......My dog goes every year.
1436639,pegasis0066,2012-05-17 05:37:00,64,Outfitter is fine with dogs. And she might be a PITA this time (she is a 7 month old lab) but want to get her accustom to trips like this.
1436684,81Saluki,2012-05-17 07:07:00,97,"We take our dogs every time (2-3x per year). The border people rarely ask to see vaccination records, but you better have them. Yes, dogs can be a PITA but we would never leave them behind. They love to ""hunt"" and swim and go fishing. As Blue Lk alluded to, watch those hooks and lures!! If they get tangled in a loose line, they can panic causing the hook/lure to whip around. We've had some close calls but, thankfully, no embedded hooks. Also, if you let your dog off-leash, beware of porcupines. We've had to make 2 trips to the vet over the years to get quills removed from their mouths! Oh, and skunks too. It's not fun letting the dog out right before bedtime so they can go potty and have them come back smelling like well, you know. Despite all this, we take them with us. They are, after all, ""family"". Attached is a pic of one of our dogs (RIP) in the boat. She REALLY wanted that fish in the live well! And here's a link to a video of her in the boathouse. At only 7 months old, maybe you can teach your Lab what's OK and what's not. Good luck and have fun with your new fishing buddy!! 81Saluki"
1436906,rms0528,2012-05-17 14:41:00,18,"In 2009 the wife and I were headed up the canada for a week in August with the dog. Having been to Canada 1-3 times per year for the previous 10 years, we knew the drill about having the certification. We were a block away from the Pigeon River border, when my wife looks at me and asked, ""did you bring the dog's papers?"" My answer, ""No, you usually pack those along with the passports."" We had the passports, but no rabies cert. Never been asked for it before so we felt comfortable we'd be okay without it. Wrong. The customs official asked for the rabies cert. We didn't have it; the dog had the tag on the collar, but that wasn't good enough. Since we were driving in on a Saturday afternoon at 3pm, the vet was closed by the time we were back in cell phone coverage territory; we ended up driving all the way back home in Minneapolis to get the cert. We lost a day of fishing and spent an extra $200 in gas to get back to the border the second time with the cert in hand and they never asked for it. In case you can't tell, it still irks me. Most everyone thinks about a 7mo old retriever going to retrieve lures when casting, but my problem was with the dog trying to retrieve released fish. It happened four times in a row in a matter of 30 minutes. It was funny and I laughed the first time and told her no. Not so funny the second and I sternly told her no. Irritating the third and I gave her a small swat on the butt. Lost my temper on the fourth and let her swim for 10-15 minutes before not so gently hauling her rear-end into the boat this last time. She got the message, and never had a problem since. Now the wife comes fishing sometimes, but the dog goes every time."
1436926,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-17 15:18:00,235,"My thought on dogs is that they are fun to have around camp, but a pain to have in the boat. Even worse in a canoe."
1436964,pegasis0066,2012-05-17 17:12:00,64,"Thanks for the advice and stories - laughed at them all. Getting the rabies cert and crossing the fingers on the experience being positive. I am sure it will, but not without its challenges."
1436990,Ogoki,2012-05-17 19:13:00,291,"My wife and I have three female chocolate labs . We take two with us every fly-in trip . They are well behaved and not a problem in camp or in our boat either . Have taken them with us since they were very young . I take one with me on service calls when it is not hot weather . Whichever one i take with me will just sit in the truck and watch me work . They learn patience that way . I think them being with me much of the time makes a better behaved dog . We don't have kids so if my dog can't go I don't go . They are fun to have with us . As for the canoe , they pile up on top of the packs and gear and go to sleep ."
