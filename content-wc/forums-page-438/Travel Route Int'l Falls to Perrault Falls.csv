1436514,packpro,2012-05-16 19:56:00,695,"Our group has about 15 years of trips utilizing 502. All of the information above is very accurate. We hit 502 around midnight on Friday. One precaution at that time- you can get stuck behind a long line of other outdoorsman with boats. With the blind curves and hills you'll have to be patient to get past them safely. Still, it is our preferred, faster, route."
1436549,115 optimax,2012-05-16 20:44:00,650,"Take the 502 just don't do it at night or drive slow tons of MOOSE.When your on the 105 samething except you will have alot of chip trucks to contend with.We have 3 chippers running in the Ear falls area with 26 trucks running back and forth to Dryden 24hrs a day.Try not to stop and veiw wild life in bad spots on the Hwy.I drive a chip truck and came around corners before with people stopped in the middle of the lane taking pictures of wildlife and barely missing them,it's kind of hard stopping a 120,000 pound truck on a dime.Have a safe trip and catch lots of fish."
1436802,Beagle_Nut,2012-05-17 09:58:00,52,"Haven't taken the 502 route for a long time because we've settled in on LOTW as our destination of choice. I always go with my wife and the one problem we had on the 502 route was there was literally only one place to stop the entire way with bathroom, a conveience store about half way up. Last year on 71 they'd built a couple nice rest areas, have they built any on 502? If not the female travellers probably need to carefully plan their liquid intake before that trip."
1437062,trapper_john,2012-05-17 21:26:00,83,We usually stop in Dryden for supplys. If we come in from the West where do Y'all stop for supplys? We are heading up to Wabbie.
1437132,v-bay gord,2012-05-18 06:27:00,3168,If you come from the west you could pick up supplies at the Co-op in Vermilion Bay......just turn south off the highway at Bobby's Corner......
1437185,Oldschool,2012-05-18 08:01:00,163,"All of the above responses are quite accurate. I will throw my hat in for the 71 route on the west. It is far more scenic and safer. Having been been stuck behind a very slow boat and subsequent caravan on 501 in the past, I simply cannot go that way any longer. No road rage myself, but it was painful watching others taking chances with their safety that bordered on insanity. At any rate, we really like 71 and the scenery. If it takes longer, it certainly does not seem so given the great scenery. Several times we have opted to go into Kenora to look around. We probably won't do that any longer as it seems to have gone downhill. Maybe not, but it seems so. At any rate, as you can tell, there is no 'right' way to go, just the one that you like the best."
1437198,fishnutbob,2012-05-18 08:37:00,633,Ive traveled all those roads heading to Ear Falls and Red lake the wider the road at night the better for me. Moose really ruin a trip. Good luck
1435677,bigdaddyguns,2012-05-15 10:08:00,608,"I am heading up to Perrault Falls this summer and am wondering the best route from Int'l Falls. Google maps suggests Rt. 11, Rt 502, Rt 17, to Rt 105. That route is 180 miles long and Google Maps shows 4.9hrs of travel time which I think is too long. That time translates into 37 miles/hr rate which seems slow. My first question, is that rate/time accurate for those segments of road? If not what speeds or times should I expect for that route? My second question has to do with an alternate route 17 to the west of Int'l Falls. That route is 30 miles longer but I don't see any advantage vs. 502? Is my assumption correct or is there a good reason for taking 17? This is our first trip into Canada so I will appreciate any feedback or comments on these routes from experienced travelers through this region. Thanks."
1435687,Glenman12,2012-05-15 10:33:00,762,"the west rt would be 71..the only advatage is you go thru two towns, Nestor Falls and Sioux Narrows..if you go up 502 there are no towns at all til you get to Dryden.. For years now we take 502..it cuts off some time and miles..also if you zoom in on Google Maps south of Dryden you'll 594..the snakes thru the north side of Eagle Lake..it cuts off about 30-35 mins for us and brings you to 17 maybe 10 miles west of 105..only drawback is that several sections of the road are gravel and its very bumpy so you can go to fast in some stretches.."
1435697,Terwalleye,2012-05-15 10:54:00,166,"Hey BigdaddyGlenman is right about the 502 route saving some time. We went up one way and back the other last year. Only other comment I would make about the Hwy 71/17 route is that it is more of a traditional 2 lane highway. Meaning there shoulders are cut back further. From a safety standpoint, it is nice to have a little more visibility if there are any critters near the shoulder. The other positive, IMHO; of the Hwy 71 route is that it is more scenic too. Most of Hwy 502 is literally carved out of rock and the woods and that is what you see the most of. Hwy 71 goes around Lake of Woods and is much more ""open."""
1435711,bigdaddyguns,2012-05-15 11:17:00,608,Thanks for the advice on the routes Glenman and Terwalleye. Do you recall your travel speeds on 502 and 71? Sounds like 71 is suited (safety wise) for higher speed travel? Also for daytime driving how active or frequent are critters on or around the roads? Any different than northern WIS/MIN?
1435719,bergsh,2012-05-15 11:27:00,183,Just drove 502 this weekend. Speeds are posted to be about 50 mph converted. We usually run it at 60-65. Very little traffic. We usually take the cutoff road by eagle lake. At times this road can be washboarded and really rough on the car. Night driving is dangerous up there. We missed a moose at midnight by about 3 feet. We stopped and slept then until sunrise. Not worth it to smack one of those things again.
1435724,JayM5209,2012-05-15 11:31:00,1050,"BigDaddy, go up 502. After three or four years of doing the western route, in about 1982 or so we started usaing 502 and have never gone back west. The Google time estimate is way off. Without doing much adding in my head, I'd say 3 hours is plenty to get you from Intl. Falls thru Dryden to Vermilion Bay. After your stop at Bobbie's in V. Bay, 30 minutes will get you to Perrault Falls.Two things to remember on 502 - - - 1) the speed limit is 50 mph +/-. Don't be tempted, as many are, to let the speed creep up, especially if towing a boat. Lots of blind curves and crests of hills. And, as mentioned before, NO shoulders to give you any maneuvering/recovery room. It's not a bad drive at all. Just control the urge to get there and go fishing. I've seen too many 502 accidents over the years that were caused by drowsiness or excess speed. 2) 502 puts you in the heart of moose country and they roam at night. If you're traveling at night, be on double dose moose alert. They just appear in the middle of the road, as if from nowhere.Fort Francis east on 11 to 502 - 17-18 miles.Hwy. 502 north to Dryden - 100 +/- 5 miles (NO services of any kind!).Dryden to Vermilion Bay - 24 miles.V. Bay to Perrault Falls - 30-32 miles.Have a great trip!"
1435741,jiggster,2012-05-15 11:50:00,183,"I believe 17 is 21 miles farther. I have traveled 17 most of the time. We went 502 once. Then went back to 17. 17 is a little farther, we like stopping at sport shops. If we have any trouble I won't be stuck out with no services."
1435743,bigdaddyguns,2012-05-15 11:54:00,608,"I was figuring 50-60MPH on the roads up there would be ok, thanks for the info. Just taking a look at google streetview I see what you mean about no shoulder and cut right thru the woods. not much margin for error. We will take a pass on the 594w eagle lake cutoff. We will probably stop in Dryden and pick up some perishable foods and stick to paved roads. Definitely no plans for night driving up there especially after watching the car vs. moose mythbuster episode! Could ruin more than a fishing trip."
1435796,wallydave,2012-05-15 14:04:00,2151,"We nearly always take the 502 17 105 route, it is scenic with the granite hills and lakes. Last year the roads were in good shape with no construction issues, lets hope the mild winter was kind to the roads!! One year we returned on 71, bad idea, several speed traps set up to catch fishermen returning home! I have heard from guys at camp that 71 still has speed traps. No thanks we will keep on our roads of choice!!"
1435934,Fishin Fun,2012-05-15 19:34:00,218,"We used to take 502 but 71 was a better road. We've had a few close calls on 502 with moose and low shoulders. Especially at night. My understanding is that 502 is much better than it used to be but we still continue to use 71 because it goes thru more towns in case we need to stop. It is longer, but it seems to be a safer road. Just my opinion."
