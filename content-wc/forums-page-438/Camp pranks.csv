Might hide the speaker in the trees right outside the cabin. Were also trying to figure out if we could get someone from the camp to dress in a Sasquatch costume and walk by as we were all standing on the deck. LOL The costumes are expensive though.Good stuff! You guys definitely have fun in camp! My guess is that you will have MorgonMan to dress up in the monkey suit! ************************************************** ******************* We don't do just a whole lot of prankin but one that comes to mind was when I was 10 or 11. My dad went to the lake and got naked and was taking a bath. He was standing about knee deep in the water facing away. Well I just got my new camera for takin pictures up there so I snapped off a couple of my Dad and his naked backside. He didn't even know that I took them. When I got back, I had my mother take the film in to be developed at our little sporting goods store in small town Iowa. The couple who owned that store were known around town as being a bit risque. (She was the town nympho) When the pictures were ready, they called for pickup and my Dad and I went to pick them up. The lady handed us the pictures and told my Dad that he had a nice backside, kinda white. My Dad was only mad for a little bit, but it was quite a few years before the story was eligible to be told. That is one of the stories you have to grow into to fully appreciate."
1435858,Fish_Heads,2012-05-15 16:44:00,154,"I had an aunt & uncle that came along one year. Our cabin had great northern Canadian well water, but they insisted on bringing along some large bulky reverse osmosis water filter system that they rigged to the sink faucet. It held a couple gallons of water once it cycled through.They insisted that our water just had to be ""purified"" before we could use it. Whenever we needed to wash dishes or use the sink we had to unhook & move it out of the way & it was starting to be a real PIA by the third day or so. My brother told me that whenever the aunt & uncle were away fishing for the day, he dumped the ""purified"" water down the sink & refilled the unit with lake water from the dock. All week long the aunt & uncle just raved about how good their water was !We never did tell them .................Fish"
1435452,nitroman,2012-05-14 21:07:00,368,I got a buddy that's a self employed contractor/handyman. Had a girl from work call him posing as a Iowa public television employee that was looking for local contractors to spotlight. Told him it would run in conjunction with the hometime series. She said they would send out a film crew to follow him for two days and they would edit a 5 miniute segment that would air before hometime did on saturdays. Had him hook line and sinker then she told him the available film dates they had that just happened to fall on the days we were in Canada. When he asked if they could try the week before she said he would need to talk to her manager so she put me on the line. That was just priceless!

1435588,BrianinVA,2012-05-15 07:56:00,160,"Every group seems to have that one boat that likes to get a head start in the morning to beat everyone to their favorite honey hole. One of our favorite pranks is to engage these guys on where they are going to fish after breakfast. Wherever it might be, hint that you were thinking of fishing there as well. Of course, as breakfast wraps up these guys will be hurrying to the docks to beat you out. Give them a good 3 minute head start so they think they can lay their claim to the prime fishing grounds. Of course, you've pulled their fuel lines earlier in the morning so they get 100 yards before their little Johnson gives out on them. Unless they've had this gag pulled on them before, they won't think it's the fuel line and will be fiddling with the motor as you fly by with a wave. One year we had a youngster who liked to run up the stairs to the loft and jump and dive into his bed. After several days of witnessing this we swapped the mattress and box spring and hilarity ensued. Needless to say, he did not jump into bed again that week."
1435678,rsiminski,2012-05-15 10:09:00,53,Be very careful with this one and only use it as a payback. Because if you try this one out one someone they will hate you for a long time. While on a fly-in trip to quebec we had a guy who went with us who I did not really care for. He was the type of guy who had to have the best equipment and brag about all of his million dollar gadgets he bought for the trip. The whole time he was ripping me apart for my cheapo rod's from Cabela's I brought with me on the fly-in. He told me that his G. Loomis rods were the only way to go and that he would catch more fish in one afternoon than I would catch all week. So after him running his mouth I got sick of him real quick. So on to the prank..... While I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth I noticed one of the younger guys had his shaving bag on the counter and there was a condom in there. So I asked him if I could have it. He said yes but I had to let him in on the prank so he didnt think I was missing my wife too much and decided to turn the fish camp into a prison shower party. So the night before we left I unwrapped the condom and placed it in his dirty laundry bag burried in his dirty clothes. When we got back home the guys wife did his laundry from the trip and found it. Needles to say I was fortunate enough to never worry about have him go fishing with me ever again. I just wish I could have been a fly on the wall when he explained that one to her.

1435781,reelobsession,2012-05-15 13:36:00,40,"I want to preface this by saying I do not intend to insult anyone in any way...it was just a joke...so please take it the way it was intended..thanksnow...a few years ago we headed up for an 8 hour drive with 8 guys in 2 vehicles. In our truck we had planned ahead and we knew the other group were driving a suburban. So we measured the tailgate and made up a sign with magnets that we stuck on at the last minute without there knowledge. We followed them for 4 hours and watched as any vehicle came to pass, looked at the sign pointed laughed then pulled up beside the driver pointed and laughed. The guy in the passenger seat got a kick out of everyone waving etc at them. We stopped for lunch and were able to take the sign off without them knowing. Got it back on when we left.So in traffic we got seperated, and just before Timmins they were rushing to catch up with us and got caught speeding going 145kmh in a 90 zone. The guys told us this later...The local police man was a pure ""redneck"". He got out of his car stopped at the back of the truck read the sign and then flipped..ordered them all out of the vehicle, took the drivers license and just put it in his pocket..told them they were being arrested for racing read them the riot act and called a tow truck to impound there vehicle. These guys didn't have a clue what was happening. After alot of talking the policeman takes them to read the sign. Lots of swearing name calling then they explained what had happened. An hour later the policeman let them go with a $350 fine. They caught up to us called us all kinds of names etc.The sign we had made was (I hope I can post this picture right).Anyway after we flew into camp and had a few beers everyone had a great laugh. I always check my vehicle anytime I am near these guys. I still live in fear of them getting even."

1435082,hommer23,2012-05-14 08:43:00,523,"pick up some furry cat toy's to put in the pockets or boots, it will suprize your buddy when he finds it. You can also take a rubber snake and tie some fishing line to it and do alot with it, tie it to the cooler lid so when it is opened the snake moves. If thing get real bad take a hot glue gun with you and glue boots to the floor, a small drop of hot glue on a zipper will prevent it from working until pulled off. The worst thing you can do though is fill pockets and boots with cheese whiz that is saved for the one guy that will not let up."
1435151,Fish_Heads,2012-05-14 11:26:00,154,Plastic wrap over the toilet bowl (under the seat of course ) is always a hit with the ladies ! Works great over a doorway about head high at nite too !

1435240,Rivratz,2012-05-14 14:50:00,105,If you're at a fly-in with an outhouse hide all the toilet paper! Or Just before you go out fishing set the other guys boat adrift for awhile. Blame one of them for the poor tie job. Just make sure it's not to windy that the boat isn't damaged if it drifts ashore. Or Replace the vodka with water or the whiskey with tea. Leave a little booze in for smell and flavor. Nothing that I know of with beer other than serving it real warm. Or Wash a few worms and add it to their spaghetti before serving it. If they eat one it won't hurt em! I have a few more but they're a little on the nasty side.

1435279,RapShad,2012-05-14 16:06:00,76,"Easily the best prank I had seen was when my buddy who at the time was about 15 or so fell asleep while holding his rod while we were trolling and our guide/friend have his rod a couple of solid HARD jerks. You should have seen my buddy jump and scream like he had Moby Dick on. We had to have been laughing for 10 minutes and our guide still tells that story to this day.NOTE: make sure the victim has their rod firmly in their hands, you don't want to be paying for a brand new $300 Loomis when you get back to the states"

Out of reflex all of us bail out of bed then set there for a second trying to clear our heads. Thinking ""what the..?"" probably the selling point besides to tones was the dispatchers familiar voice. Conditioned reflexes.Maybe you had to be there or be a firefighter to appreciate the humor. It was funny to us.With the group we go with it's kind of open season on anybody at any given moment. Nothing mean, just witty humor.Pooch"
