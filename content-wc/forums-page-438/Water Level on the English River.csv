1434803,fishwteeth,2012-05-13 14:29:00,10,I will be in the Ignace area (Cozy Camp) a week after you are there. Are the two areas close? My friend (who I am going with) talked to the camp owner a few days ago and he said things are great.
1434828,drlee,2012-05-13 16:00:00,409,Just north of cozy camp is press lake camp...the English runs in the south end of press lk (above barrel lk) and out the north end...the camp owner does a blog and said the water levels on press are quite high...looking good. Hope it is still ok when I get there in late July! Would love to hear about your experiences at cozy camp...as I drive by there a couple of times a year I have always thought it looked like a neat place to stay. Hope your trip is all you hope for!
