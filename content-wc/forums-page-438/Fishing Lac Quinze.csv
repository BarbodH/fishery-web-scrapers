1435956,heritage2008,2012-05-15 19:59:00,92,Making first trip to this Quebec lake. If anyone has fished it before I'd appreciate some advice. We are staying near Moffet at Outfiiter Domaine Lac Quinze--seems like nice clean cabins. Have been to Zec Dumoine for the past 16 years and needed a change. May also hit Lac Simard--any help? Is it legal to net minnows?

Each year we would pull the boat and launch in Lac Des Quinze and spend a day trolling and casting stump filled bays, rocky shorelines, and open water from Remigny to Anglers. This is a big dammed up lake that can get very choppy in afternoons and a bit too rough for the 16' boat that I had at that time. The lake can get murky for a while after a storm. Careful of rocky shoals by getting map chip for chartplotter or detailed map. For example, outlet of bay coming from Remigny to big open water has long strip of boulders across to raise havoc!Similar to Remigny, Quinze has plenty of smallmouth to be caught along rocky shores or or shoals. Back then we trolled bombers, williams wabler spoons, or casting cranks. We also targeted pike at dropoffs or weed beds trolling. Caught a far number of pike, but nothing to write home about, perhaps because we slayed pike in remigny and didn't know Quinze as well! We never targeted walleye back then, and now regret not running worm harnesses. In deep water we ran deep diving husky jerks or walleye divers. For one per year ventures we had limited success and thought remigny had better structure, weed beds, and pike quantity. Quinze had a lot of sandy shores that held little. Camp owner told us Q was better for walleye, but we were not good at catching them. Q is a very big lake and I'm sure in a week you will do well by finding good water to fish. Note that we were not jiggers and also didn't run worm harnesses. If I went back today, I might have much better luck!"
