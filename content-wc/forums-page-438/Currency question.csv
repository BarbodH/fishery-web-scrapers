1436473,maddogg,2012-05-16 18:34:00,178,You could get cash at an ATM. Just make sure you notify the CC company you will be in Canada.
1435883,trapper_john,2012-05-15 17:47:00,83,"We pretty much use our CC. That will give you the current rate of exchange. Whet ever change I get, Loonies, Twonies, I use them for ball markers when I play golf. **** I'm old. If I put down a dive I may not find it again. Twonies work well for that."
1435908,bigwalleye1,2012-05-15 18:46:00,2632,"We go past the falls and stop in Dryden. At the stoplight by the paper mill turn left, go 1 block and the bank is on your right. Turn right and pull to the curb. If you're headed for Sioux Lookout, leave the bank, turn left, go one block, left again and down the hill, along the river, up the hill and turn right at the light. Puts you on the main drag headed east out of town."
1435923,TIGHTLINER,2012-05-15 19:14:00,223,We go thru at the soo and we stop at the casino right after customs. We always did better there than at the banks or currency exchange ... Now with it being about par i guess you could go anywhere. I am talking when we were getting 10 to 50 %. Just posted for the guys going thru at the soo. Not sure if there is a casino at int falls.
1436179,Rivratz,2012-05-16 09:25:00,105,"My Chase CC has a transaction fee attached to every foreign purchase. I'm going to check again with them on how much? I do like the c card because of the miles that accrue. Other than that, not a fan of any type of service fees. Nothing compares to cash, and the camp owners love our Yankee dollars! Banks in Canada are excellent for exchanging A to C. The problem with banks are the conflicting hours of business. They're never open when you need them to be. The exchange rate fluctuates daily, so you can't check rates today if you leave in a month. Well you can, but... It's not like yesteryear when you got $1.50 for every $1.00. Lots of cases of Molson's were purchased with those favorable exchange rates."
1436180,LOW1,2012-05-16 09:27:00,2828,"A credit card is easier and cheaper than currency. Also, it's worth your while to call up your credit card company and tell them that you will be travelling to Canada. Otherwise their anti-fraud software may trigger if it detects an unusual-for-you ""foreign"" transaction.We also have an account at a Canadian credit union which has no fees if you keep a modest balance and gives favorable conversion rates."
1436305,Shellback,2012-05-16 13:27:00,8083,Looks like the Cabelas Visa card charges 1%. I guess it's a wash with the 1% they give you when you use it the purchase something. I usually just swap money with a Canadian friend. That way neither of us has to pay a transaction fee at the bank.
1436394,@Lunker,2012-05-16 15:23:00,835,"x2 re LOW1's comment.....when you're traveling to ANY foreign country, and perhaps even extensively within the US. They DO notice and have in fact called me to confirm that it's me spending all that money in different places."
1436405,adempsey,2012-05-16 15:52:00,963,I would use a CC and carry some American dollars just in case. You will be hard pressed to find anywhere in Canada that doesn't accept your money.
1436411,Walley Guide,2012-05-16 16:07:00,67,"Second the notion on Cap One credit card no exchange fees. Also....agree with calling your credit card company to inform them you are traveling to Canada, with all of the fraud problems many companies will ""freeze"" your account...had that happen a few years ago when we used our card a little more than in the past. I have no idea what the creates the system to kick out your card but I have found it works great by making a 5 minute call to your credit card company. Happy fishin' Walley"
1436420,Rivratz,2012-05-16 16:38:00,105,"Thanks for the reminder to call the credit card company to let them know that I will be making out of state and Canadian purchases. They would decline suspicious activity on my card without prior notification. Actually, it's good that they do that. The $100.00 purchases for fuel out of state would certainly alert their software security. Have a safe and prosperous trip!"
1435803,Guest,2012-05-15 14:19:00,0,Where is the best place to do a currency exchange near Int. Falls. We used to do it at the Canadian Tourism office right across the border but last year they stopped offering the service. We were forced downtown to a pawn shop and got hosed on the rate. Thanks
1435812,Ranger319,2012-05-15 14:38:00,166,"For this very reason we never exchange currency. Use credit cards for everything. The exchange rate can't be ""modified"" by some store clerk. One less stop you make too. If we do have to pay in cash, we us US currency and just take it in the shorts. Over the years, you collect a lot of loonies and toonies. Either keep them til next year or give to little kids. Its only a few bucks to me, but its like giving them a million dollars."
1435814,Fishin Fun,2012-05-15 14:42:00,218,We used to exchange at the Fisherman gas station on the south side of I-Falls. But the past few years we have not done any of that. Our resort wants american funds and we use credit cards for everything else. That seems to work well for us.
1435826,3M TA3,2012-05-15 15:28:00,2846,"I've been in Ontario 6 times so far this year. Every place I've gone so far has taken par...t i t 4 t a t. gas, food, bait. No lodging yet. Seems pretty good to me."
1435833,zman8701,2012-05-15 15:53:00,100,You can do currency exchange at Border Bob's right in Int. Falls.
1435835,upeyes,2012-05-15 16:00:00,11,"When you guys use the credit card in Canada, are you assessed an extra fee? Just curious, I was under the impretion that you are assessed a surcharge by your credit card company."
1435843,Guest,2012-05-15 16:18:00,0,I have never been charged a fee and I have used my card all over the globe
1435844,hommer23,2012-05-15 16:20:00,523,"Most bank's will exchange at the current rates. I go to my credit union and exchange what I think I will need plus a couple hundred extra, then if I have any left over, I return it at the same bank for U.S$."
1435852,3M TA3,2012-05-15 16:33:00,2846,Wow. What bank is that through? I would also like a card like that.
1435865,BrianinVA,2012-05-15 17:02:00,160,Capital One offers no foreign transaction fees. There is a pretty exhaustive list of credit cards and their respective foreign fees here.
