1437176,Pymbet,2012-05-18 07:49:00,42,"When we fish in Ontario it is usually two guys in a boat and two large tackle boxes. But after 25 years of fishing with my brother, we are finally getting to the point where we can say just one of us bring the tackle box. You have to be really trusting, but we almost never wish we had something that we left in the other box."
1437197,KevinSB,2012-05-18 08:35:00,73,"Pymbet, we're about the same. We had two big tackles boxes for three guys but this year combined gear. Mostly my jig box and a buddy's cranks, plus an assortment of slip bobbers. Plus I'll tie up spinner rigs most of the drive from IL to International Falls so the boat has a variety of options. Still too much stuff, but we're getting better. It's our third year Canadian fishing, and we're realizing we don't need as many crazy/desperation options as in years past. The fact that we can limit gear is certainly a testament to NW Ontario lakes!"
1437205,drlee,2012-05-18 09:05:00,409,"I don't fly in any more, since I have my own boat and just cannot talk myself into fishing in Ontario without it...so, I take my obese tackle box, but leave it in the back of my 4-runner where I can access it easily. Then, I have a smaller soft sider (it holds 4 max. of those plastic trays; which ones depends on the day and our plans) which goes in the boat with me. I also have a ""glove box"" back by my tiller and I keep extra jigs, soft plastics, pliers, line, etc. in there. Works well for me, and I don't have to lug that monstrosity back and forth to the boat where it takes up as much room as my grandson (well, almost). Also, on a rainy day, I can keep the smaller tackle box in a dry storage area and avoid a lot of wet tackle. So, another year, another month in northern Ontario. Life is good."
1437245,labsrus,2012-05-18 10:49:00,557,"I have an older three tray tackle box that holds most of the spoons and spinners that I take Also hold leaders and tools. I use a series of plano boxes, one for jigs and trailers, another one for crankbaits, another one for stickbaits and one for buzz bait and spinner baits. Nice thing is I would take the tackle box and a few of the planos in the boat depending on what I was going after that day Works well for me"
1436512,Fishin Fun,2012-05-16 19:53:00,218,I'm glad I'm not the only one. Man do I carry a lot of jigs. And every year I still have to go to Cabelas and see what's new and buy them too. But I think that's part of the fun. Getting ready and buying new jigs to try.
1436551,Terwalleye,2012-05-16 20:46:00,166,"Too funny to see this topic. You nailed the description of my bring the kitchen sink approach. This year our group is trying to expand our horizons a little. Each guy is going to pick a new lure type or technique and we'll side bet for best fish caught trying something ""new."" And by ""new"" I mean some stuff we have been carrying from cabin to boat and back and never got wet, yet."
1436688,lcwhit,2012-05-17 07:19:00,104,i cut mine back a lot this year and sorted out the stuff i never use. got a smaller bag. getting too old to lug all that junk around.
1436765,3M TA3,2012-05-17 08:48:00,2846,Great idea Bill. I think I'll give that a try for the next 6 or so outtings to see what I really use to catch those fish. Trouble I have now is I'm always thinking well 'what if' scenarios. I was a Tenderfoot for 7 years so I don't know why I'm always thinking about being prepared.
1436819,outdoorsron,2012-05-17 10:45:00,843,Hello: I too haul a bunch of tackle that I probably won't use but for me that is part of the trip thinking I will use this lure to catch these fish or I might need this tackle for these fish. I bring it because I would rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it. I would probably have to leave most of my tackle at the dock for a fly in. Good Luck this season O - R
1436835,Guest,2012-05-17 11:26:00,0,"i do a canoe/portage/camping trip to canada every year. last year my canoe weighed 56lbs, pack weighed 42, and of that 22 lbs was tackle. this year i cut back on clothes and tackle both. we do lots of trolling from the canoe and when jigging from a canoe you can get your snagged jigs 95% of the time. for our week long trip i trimmed my jigs down to 25 and cut the crank baits down as well... i do the same as bill, i bring the main box and then another little box. when i find what lure is hot, it stays in the small box that velcros to the canoe so its always there. then i pull out a couple others that are similar and try them. the hot lures stay in the small box and year in and year out its the same few sitting in that little box at the end of the trip. i probably could get by with 5 cranks but each year is different so the thermocline is at a different depth, different wind/light conditions and different temps. we cant use any live bait where we go and gulp/trigger x is just bear attractant, so we stick to unscented plastics and cranks. i always make sure i have a depth range from 3-25 feet, lenghts of 2.5"" to 6"", shad and minnow bodies, rattles/no rattles, and a decent color selection. its hard to cover that in just a few lures...."
1436865,Blue Fin,2012-05-17 12:26:00,47,"Agree on the strap being defective. When I took it back to Cabela's, the guys were very understanding and just gave me a new one....love that place. I may try to take a tray or two out of there so I can shove my rain gear in as well. I like that idea."
1436893,back357,2012-05-17 13:44:00,106,"I got everything in my tackle box down to 4 trays (jigs, cranks, spinners, fly fishing). Put the weights, hooks, and plastics in a worm binder. Put the worm binder in the extra space created without the extra three trays and still have enough room for the rain gear. Bag is stuffed, but everything is in one bag. makes life a lot easier."
1436930,Larry Mac,2012-05-17 15:26:00,530,"Hi BlueFin, I enjoy reading this thread as we all have been there LOL. We are blessed to go to Canada several times a year and weight is something we work very hard on. We camp, flyin, boat and portage in, along with drive in. We fish for Walleye, Northern, Smallmouth and Perch. Over the years I have refined my tackle box (Cabelas Storm Proof Large Bag) to 11 lbs and that supplies two of us for the week and we want for nothing. We jig, cast, bobber fish, troll, back troll and drift. We still do not use everything in that bag. have a great yearhttp://www.cabelas.com/tackle-bags-cabelas-advanced-angler-storm-proof-8482-series-bags-2.shtmlThank you,Larry Mac"
1437034,gfish,2012-05-17 20:29:00,23,"I love this topic - I constantly get a ribbing from my fishing buddies for ""nesting"" with my giant Cabela's soft side in the front of the boat. At least I'm not alone, my strap just hasn't broke yet.The idea for side bets for catching fish with a new lure is great, and I'm going to suggest that our group tries it as well - sure to expand our thinking, and who knows what we'll end up with?"
1436282,NARDA 1,2012-05-16 13:02:00,636,I basically fish once a year in canada (unless we do a charter on Lake Michigan) and I have a Musky box and a Cabela's soft sided bag that has 4 of the plastic boxes in it. One of which is filled with my jiggin tackle for walleye and that is the box that is out of the bag 90% of the time. The great thing is that the lodge allows me to store all my tackle at the lodge so I don't have to haul it back and forth.
1436306,NathanH,2012-05-16 13:29:00,697,Thank you for this post. It makes me feel better! I really ramped up my fishing gear over the last 1 1/2 and as I packed for Canada and realized I have way too much stuff! But I dont want to miss out on something thats hot. How one would even figure out which of the 100's of baits they brought will work I dont know. But hope springs eternal for this fool and I feel great that I am ready for anything.
1436333,fishinnut 3446,2012-05-16 14:10:00,638,"Terry,Since were going up before you,you won't mind if I use some of your tackle will you?2 years ago before we left I double check everything,thought I had everything possibly amaginable yeh right,11-12 hr. drive later when we get to the Lodge is when I found out I left the Musky tacklebox at homeNeedless to say I had to buy a couple,and they were not cheap."
1436335,Lovetofish,2012-05-16 14:13:00,458,"I certainly try to keep a good handle on the tackle, but it's not easy to do. Just last week I stopped to pick up a few things I needed for spinner rigs. Came home with that plus some swim baits, steel leaders, more slip weights, and a new reel. So I guess we have to watch our tounges when we look in our wives shoe closet. lol"
1436436,NARDA 1,2012-05-16 17:19:00,636,"Not a problem, just pay my bar tab for the week I'm up there and we're good."
1436441,bigwalleye1,2012-05-16 17:30:00,2632,"Ranger and Bluefin, I think you're looking at this the wrong way. Seems to me if the strap roke, it's not an issue of too much tackle, it's a Cabela's warranty issue. They wouldn't make the box that big if they didn't expect you to fill it up... That said, this HAS prompted me to see if I can reduce quantity myself. I'd like to see if I can get my tackle and my rainsuit in the same boat bag."
1436447,octanehi5,2012-05-16 17:39:00,1104,"At 40 lbs you are getting away light. I have a rhino tough bag weatherproof,I carry the gear for one boat,Jigs,hooks bottom boncers, lures, rod holders gulp alive, trigger X, pliers, hook out pl,metal stringer,drift sockone fishfinder with acid batt, it weighs in at about 56 lbs, thats not rods, reels. We never make fly in weight and do not even try any more. and use 90% of what I bring. but the pilot of the plane always looks at me at loading time??"
1436450,drew59,2012-05-16 17:40:00,87,"I finally realized that I was using 5% of what I had in the box. We decided to scale back and have never regretted it. We use jigs for walleyes 99% of the time. 3"" twister tail with a piece of meat. We troll, cast, and jig them. I have spinner rigs just in case. For pike we use nothing but large Johnson Silver Minnows with a twin twister tail attached making it about 7 inches long. No problems catching fish and I am VERY relaxed."
1436457,trapper_john,2012-05-16 17:56:00,83,40 lbs pf Jigs... that would be me.
1436476,Rivratz,2012-05-16 18:36:00,105,Bring it! That's why you bought it! A no brainer!
1436186,Blue Fin,2012-05-16 09:49:00,47,"I am not sure if anyone else has this issue, but every year I tell myself that I am going to downsize how much I bring up to Canada. Oddly enough, my soft sided tackle box gets heavier and heavier. This is really the only time I get to go fishing each year, so I want to use what I have. I know that the time I leave my tray of raps home, I would have wished I had them up there. Does anyone else face this same issue and do you have any suggestions?Thanks"
1436192,JDMN,2012-05-16 10:10:00,34,"Honestly no. I actually end up using dozens of different crankbaits and swimbaits throughout the course of a week. I always think that I won't bring all that tackle, but I figure I didn't buy it to leave it at home. I always make sure that I have at least 2 of particularly successful crankbaits. I may be the oddball, but out boat probably only spends 10% of our time jigging/rigging the rest is spent casting."
1436196,Ranger319,2012-05-16 10:14:00,166,"I have the magnum Cabelas soft sided tackle bag. Last year I was carrying it from the house to the boat, and the strap broke...so I feel like I can speak intelligently on this topic.I too have had the "" I wish I had this one crankbait that I left at home because the other 75 I have with me just won't work"" thoughts go through my head while up there fishing. So here is what I did the other day. I took every piece of tackle out of the boat and divided it up based on what species I would target with that bait. I then made 3 piles. Must take, maybe will take, have never used this in the 14 years I've been going.What I found is I took up A LOT of extra plastic and lures that I would never think of using. I went through each tackle box and looked at every lure and thought...have you ever thrown this type of lure for walleyes/smallies/pike...if not, I took them out. It takes some extra time but holy cow did I free up some room. So much I can go pick up a few more lures to take! I am also the type of person who likes to go through my tackle so that made it enjoyable for me. It really helped me organize my tackle too. Before all my bass and crappie tackle filled my tackle bag, after this, I can now fit all my walleye trolling, jigging, rigging tackle and all my smallie tackle in my bag. Have to take along a large 4"" deep box for my pike/musky stuff. I know I could go through it all again and probably take out another 20lbs of tackle but that would just be silly!"
1436203,tv4fish,2012-05-16 10:42:00,2694,"I take 2 tackle boxes - 1 is for Walleyes/Smallmouth and the other is for Northerns/Muskies. I don't think either one is close to 40 lbs. The Northern/Muskie one is much lighter, however, since it doesn't have any lead in it like the Walleye one has."
1436206,Blue Fin,2012-05-16 10:47:00,47,"Ha. My strap broke as well last year. Same soft sided Cabela's box. I started going through it the other night and saw my broken strap, which was something I had forgotten about. And here I am asking my superiors for advice. I like taking everything out and sorting. I may just do that this weekend."
1436214,jambi,2012-05-16 10:57:00,504,"I did pretty much the same thing a few weeks ago. We do multiple portages almost every day and lugging the gear was wearing me out. If we cant catch everything we want on 25% of what I brought last year, they just aren't biting! If we didn't have the portages, I would bring more stuff!"
1436227,wallydave,2012-05-16 11:25:00,2151,Yea I take more stuff than I need!! We like our drive in camp so we don't have to worry about weight limits. Each year conditions change. We don't always get the same week so you don't know what the conditions will be. Last year was this first year I tried pink jigs that was the hot color. Before it had been green and sunburst. You guys buying that excuse??
1436247,Bill Krejca,2012-05-16 12:08:00,6107,"I have a reminder of what I used each trip by the stuff I throw in a spare box after using (so I don't have to dig out again when I decide I really should have left it on anyway). It is interesting that, on most trips north, at the end of the week, the contents of that box would fit in a medium(or small) zip lock. It has been my observation that new tackle gets accumulated based on the visualization at the store of needing it for a particular purpose/ at a particular spot/ in a particular situation. *To that end, the new bait is added to the tackle box and then promptly forgotten about, only to surface later to be maybe removed ""because I never use that anyway."" A sub series of the above scenario is the pre-trip look-through of my previously stored tackle when I decide I really need to include these Mistic Marvels in my box. This look-through action is repeated every week or so before the trip, thinking I may have forgotten something I'll really need. See * above. In spite of all, or because of, the above, I still take way too much stuff with me. Bill"
1436251,Blue Fin,2012-05-16 12:24:00,47,"That is one of things I struggle with. I have spent hundreds of dollars on different types of tackle for certain situations. Yet, I seem to stay with the standby's and not try the ""other"" gear anyway. So why do I bring it? What is the worry? Maybe I am just a tackle pack rat. And I agree that if they aren't biting on a jig and minnow or live bait rig, they probably are not be biting at all."
1436266,Cash,2012-05-16 12:45:00,73,^ this I have 3-4 northern lures I use and rarely anything but a jig and minnow for walleyes in my 40# tackle box. LOL
