1436129,Golden Eagle,2012-05-16 08:06:00,2642,"Spent Saturday night, on the ground, at Veteran's Campground, near Eveleth, MN. Stayed in my outfitter's office in Red Lake, Ontario Sunday night. It's good to have access to the key. All meals on the 1500 mile ride came from my ice chest. Life is pretty darned good. Heading back out on Little Vermilion Lake in a few.Pike went crazy yesteday, in less than 2 fow."
1436168,trapper_john,2012-05-16 09:00:00,83,Thank y'all for the info. We have a res for the Hill top on the 29 of June.
1436174,tilldawg,2012-05-16 09:10:00,55,Been staying at the Tee Pee motel for years. Just what you are looking for.
1436382,cuamb,2012-05-16 15:05:00,203,I agree with Narda 1 as far as staying in Ft. Frances. There are several motels there.
1435886,trapper_john,2012-05-15 18:02:00,83,"Heading up in about 45 days and need some feed back on a nice quiet, clean Motel in International Falls. Not looking for a $100 a night sleep. Wife and I. Just comfortable Clean and quiet."
1435889,NARDA 1,2012-05-15 18:14:00,636,My advice would be to cross into Canada and maybe avoid a line at the border and stay at La Place Rendezvous. www.rendezvoushotel.com Nice hotel with a good resturant and bar with a great veiw of the lake. I haven't stayed there in a while so I'm not sure about the rates.
1435894,Mark R,2012-05-15 18:23:00,1538,we will be staying at the Falls Motel for the 3rd year this year
1435935,zman8701,2012-05-15 19:35:00,100,"Trapper_john We stay at the Adventure Inn in FF. Good luck trying to find lodging on short notice. Most book rooms early in the year. Give them a call 1-807-274-1161, 1-800-991-9197 Toll Free"
1435943,chevtow,2012-05-15 19:45:00,691,"Yeah I've called 4 months ahead of time and had no luck. Now I try to do it in Jan. By the way the places I've stayed at are usually around 80-100 a night, and some of them have been pretty crappy. I have kids so now I try and stay at a chain with a pool so we can really relax after the long part of the drive."
1435944,Rich B,2012-05-15 19:46:00,1081,"Our group has stayed several times at the ""Hill Top"" hotel...very clean, reasonable and they have free coffee and danish for everyone in the early am.

1435947,2746,2012-05-15 19:50:00,3206,"Hilltop Motel 218-283-2505. w side of highway just down a few blocks from the DQ. Older but all remodeled, clean and each room is fixed up quaint. (that's what my wife called it) Last time we were there is was in the $60 - 70 range. They serve a few muffins/rolls and coffee in the morning out on the picnic table. We to used to cross and stay at Le R. but you'll leave over a $100 there. Nice view of the lake and a good resturante but I think you were asking for more affordable"
1436093,wallydave,2012-05-16 06:56:00,2151,"http://www.rainbowmotel.ca/Give the Rainbow a try, crossing the border Friday night can save you some time, the Rainbow is small, our room last year had been remodeled, very nice and clean. The rates for two, last year, was about $70 US. I have stayed at a place in downtown FF once, it was ok, maybe not a place I would take my wife to, but it had a diner and breakfast was decent. Sorry I can't remember the name, maybe some one else can help. This year we plan at stopping at Boston Pizza Friday night for pizza and winds, and Sat am Walmart for a few groceries and a quick breakfast at the Macdonalds, then on to Goose Bay Camp!!"
1436115,Jig Man,2012-05-16 07:44:00,95,I second NARDA. Get the border over with and stay at La Place Rendezvous. Good food and bar overlooking Rainy Lake. $110 a night. Just booked it online. The Adventure Inn if you are up for an 'Adventure.' Interesting Locals and I beleive they have Late Night Entertainment on Thursdays (at least they did 2 summers ago).
1436128,camp chef,2012-05-16 08:03:00,915,We stay at the Thunderbird resort on Rainy just a few miles outside IF. right on the water. Great food and drink.
