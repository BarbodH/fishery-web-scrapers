Walleye bite was great on Round (bottom bouncers or spinner rigs trolled with leaches or crawlers), but most were small in size (15"" or so).Fish were bigger but fewer in Crooked, same methods as above worked, along with vertical jigging with crawlers. Minnows were the least effective on both lakes. Most fish caught in 6-9 feet of water, occasionally as deep as 12, sometimes as shallow as 5.Bottom weed growth is getting heavy, making it important to keep your hooks from dragging the bottom. By the end of the week, in shallow water, we ran spinner rigs without any weight attached.If anyone wants more info., just ask in a reply post."
