He also said humps in large bays should be good and walleyes should be in 8' to 12' of water in late June and early July.Hope you get some responses because I'm headed to Pakwash in two weeks. My first time on the lake, but my brother-in-law has fished it for years and usually does very well. Please post a report when you get back."

We were fishing for smallmouth but got into a nice school of walleye off a point going south toward the Chukuni River. We did not catch a lot of smallmouth but did catch some nice ones. We stayed at Cianci's and he put us on the fish. We will be heading up the 2nd week of July and usuallyfish for Smallmouth for 2 days before going over to Lac Suel. Let me know how you do, may try Pakwash again. Anyone Know a good smallmouth lake around Perrault Falls/Ear Falls? Have fished Pakwash and Perrault. Thanks"
