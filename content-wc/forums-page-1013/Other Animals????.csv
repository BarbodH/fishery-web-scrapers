We are flying out of Sioux Lookout about 80 miles north. My question is what other kinds of animals might we see while fishing? Here where I live sometimes we see, gators, deer, wild turkeys, you get the point. I find it quite enjoyable to get to be lucky enough to see them, it makes fishing that much more enjoyable.Thanks for your time, and I hope this post hasnt offended anyone.Just relax.-Rod in one hand and living life in the other."

Take a pair of binoculars! Sorry no southern gators.... do have northern gators! Northern and muskie.Have fun!"

A moose can ruin your whole trip- We've seen one on every trip, i.e., crossing the road- it's like hitting a beef steer. We had the neatest bear experience on Dogtooth Lake this year- 4 of us in two boats fishing a remote bay ~ 100' from shore, heard the most god awful commotion about 30 feet into the brush- load growling - breaking branches & trees and bellowing , followed by gurgling noises then dead silence. We look at each other (""someting just died"") probably a baby moose or deer. About 45 minutes later there are two bear cubs up a tree almost on the spot the noise came from. Move closer w/ the boat to get better pictures of the cubs, hear load grunting and popping/snapping of jaws. Needless to say, I put the troller in high speed reverse. ~ 45 minutes later momma brings the cubs out for a drink- way cool. But these bears are not cuddly and shouldn't be triffled with. They are awsome creatures. To a select few of them you may even look like dinner. Don't ever throw scrap food, fish guts, etc out by your cabin. Take it out to an island or remote shoreline where the birds & bears will take care of it. Hold the noise down & have your camera ready- Canada is an awsome experience.Catch'em & Let'em Go!><))))*>"

Mink so curious they look at you like a hungry cat, and - greatest fun - Otters...Plus beavers,grouse by the ton, Loons and more loons - strings of merganser families, porkies.Seen everything in the above post in 15 years except lynyx..or wolves - hear them - but never see them. Take a spotting scope if you have it and photo gear...The scenery IS as much fun as the fishing."
