513045,Guest,2001-06-05 15:50:00,0,"I took 502 for 12 years. Winding, scenic, potholes that will eat you up, no stops, curvy. took 71 last year. Not as scenic, longer to Vermillion, but a great road. Made the same tie as 502"
513046,Guest,2001-06-05 15:53:00,0,We used 71 because 502 is under construction.Just came through this way 3 weeks ago.There a couple spots that is being repaved on71 but it is a better road then 502. Lesscurves and you can make better time. We foundthis out on our way up and back.Good luck fishing.Theo
513047,Guest,2001-06-06 09:46:00,0,Came down 502 6/2 No construction that I saw just lots of nasty potholes on south bound side. Take 502 north & watch oncoming to see if you want to come back that way or not.
513048,Guest,2001-06-06 15:35:00,0,"Came down 502 this past monday. There is some road work going on but nothing to hold a person up for long. There are three areas in 502 that are rough, especially the south bound side. I took 71 on a previous trip, about two weeks ago, and there is also road construction. Drove on gravel for probably 10 or so miles. We were on our way to Sioux Lookout and going via 71 took alot longer, however, 71 is smoother. Going to Vermillion, I would recommend 71."
513049,Guest,2001-06-18 18:41:00,0,"I thought I should give a road report, since I just got back on Saturday. I did take 71 to 17 and was happy that I did. The repaving on 71 is coming along fast. There was at least one layer of blacktop on the road. There was some construction on 17 for a couple of miles by the intersection, but nothing serious.Fritz"
