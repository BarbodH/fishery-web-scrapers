Many friends own cottages and trailers up this way. Excellent salmon fishing all summer long. If you want a nice side trip, go up to the Provincial park called Cypress. Beautiful walking trails, and dont forget to stop and have a whitefish dinner, there is nothing finer!"

I dont know what would be faster, through the falls or Port Huron. I believe you are looking at about 5 hours from the falls. Have a good trip.P.S. those whitefish dinners are a must! and cypress is beautiful."
