513296,Guest,2001-06-15 08:25:00,0,Has anyone been to RedPine and/or Lady Evelyn this spring/early summer. I'm headed there the end of the month and wanted to know how the fishing has been and if anyone has any hotspots they would be willing to share. Also how is RedPine as a place to stay.Sam
513297,Guest,2001-06-15 10:16:00,0,"Just got back last Saturday. Stayed at Garden Island Lodge. Unfortunately, it was not a good week. We had cold weather with a North wind for the entire week. Thursday and Friday were sunny but still cold. This is the first year that no one posted a fish on the large fish board (Walleye over 24"", Northern Pike over 36""). Noticed they had several the week before, both Walley and Pike.We did catch fish, mostly small Walleye and some decent Pike (20"" to 28""). My brother caught a 34"" Pike on Thursday and that was about it. Everyone else I talked to had the same problem. I haven't stayed at Red Pine, so can't say how the lodge is. I prefer fishing the lower, Southern section of the lake (where Garden Island is located). It's deeper and has more varied structure. Caught the Pike in and around Walsh Bay at the very southern end of the lake. One of the guests caught a 10 lb. Walley on the last day in Willow Island Lake but I don't know where on the lake. (And, of course, he wasn't talking.)Tom Kadlec((º>`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.. ><((((º>`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸><((((º>><((((º>`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸.·´¯`·...¸><((((º>¸¸.·´¯`·. ¸.`·.. ><((((º>`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸><((((º>¸¸.·´¯`·.¸."

James and Janet will provide a good week for your group, and they will put you on the fish.You'll want to take up some ""lighter"" walleye tackle (i.e. 1/16thand 1/8th) jigs. My 15 year old son caught and released a 27"" walleye off the island in front of the lodge by himself out of 30'(off the far side of the island)on a 1/8th Whisler jig on 4 lb test (I'd suggest you take up some of these Whisler jigs).....as well as smaller twister tails, etc....(my son brought in the fish for a ""photo op"" so we know it's measurements). There is a ""stump field"" just past the lodge that is great foran evening bite (just cast out 1/8th twister tails and slowlybring back....the walleye slam them like a bass hit).The food is good and accommodations decent. You should have anice week up north. Good Luck and enjoy, as if you've never beenon Lady Evelyn Lake, you're in for a treat....beautiful country.Tyee"
