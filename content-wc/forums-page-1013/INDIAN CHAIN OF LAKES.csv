In late June the cabins can get hot so take along a fan.Wayne and Karla (plus the rest of the staff) always have been enjoyable to be around and helpful.I consider it more of a numbers body of water than a big fish place. Last year we did not catch a walleye over 20"". But we ate fresh fish every day.I normally use jigs and live bait. Clark's have the best live bait around - they supply it to the whole region. You can catch fish on cranks, but there are lots of snags and I don't feel bad about breaking off a jig.Edward Lake is good. There was one boat that never got out of sight of the dock, and they probably caught as many fish as the rest of us. But I enjoy exploring. We have not caught a lot of fish on the clearer lakes. The stained ones are easier to fish.First thing you should do is ask Wayne, Karla or one of the staff where the fish are biting and on what. My guess is by the end of June you will be fishing deeper reefs, weed beds and wood.Good luck,Fritz"

Wayne and Karla sold the bait business, they still have minnows available but did not have leeches at the camp.Fishing was similiar to last year. Our biggest walleye was just over 20 inches. We ate fish every day and brought home a couple of meals. The walleyes were still relatively shallow. Majority of our fish were caught in less than 8 ft of water.The biggest walleye caught in camp for the week was 28+ inches by a youngster fishing by the white bouy just out from the docks. One of these years I am going to start fishing closer to camp!Good luck,Fritz"
