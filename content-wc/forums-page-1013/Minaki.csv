I live in Nebraska and consider Rob a fishing buddy and true friend. There's no way you could do better than a day with Rob on the water, especially on Minaki. If you don't believe me, ask Gary Roach himself.todd consbruck"

513013,Guest,2001-06-11 20:32:00,0,"I just got back from Minaki and the fishing was awsomethere was lots of big ones caught this weekend, the biggest that I saw was a 31 incher. I caught plenty in the 20in rangeand my biggest was 27 1/2. Bottom bouncers and leeches are a must but jigs seem to do the trick also. Wildedge is the place to go right now but that will change soon , the eyes are on the go back to there summer hiding places. 25-30 foot range. Have fun..."

Anyone have any information on where to fish walleye third week of June? Or, if you have the name of a good guide in the area that would help too. Thanks in advance!"

512998,Guest,2001-06-05 09:48:00,0,"Lot of good fishing between Minaki and Silver Point on the Winnipeg, that's the stretch I'm the most familiar with. Larry Snow would be a good guide, he can be contacted at Black Sturgeon Camp I believe."

513002,mrfish,2001-06-09 06:24:00,6,The real part? Rough Rock?? :-)
513003,Guest,2001-06-09 08:02:00,0,"WRD fishes the ""Manitoba"" side of the river system. Eagle Nest lake to be precise. He CLAIMS that the fishing on the Mb side is better. I'd agree that the fishing at Pine Falls in Oct can be awsome BUT for overall size & consistancy anywhere on the Wpg River System, from the White Dog dam all the way to LOW the fishing is better. Just my honest opinion & yes I have fished the entire system from Pine Falls to LOW.Good FishenRob"
