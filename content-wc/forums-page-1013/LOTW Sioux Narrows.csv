Heard the water level is 2-3 ft. higher than normal and would like to know if it has affected the fishing any. Fished Yellow Girl and Sunset Channel area last year and had a very good time. Thanks in advance.Tight lines, Gill"

Have been up 3 times so far this year and the high water hasn't seemed to effect my fishing. Just be sure to keep a sharp lookout for floating debris. Good Luck on your trip, I don't think I will be able to make it up there again until the end of July :("
