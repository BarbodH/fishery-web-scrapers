513267,PWaldow123,2001-06-14 17:24:00,198,"3 feet would be a more realistic number. Yes, the water is very high, and yes, you definately need to keep your eyes open for floating debris. Would hate to hit a section of somebodys dock doing 40 :)Paul"
513268,DeeZee,2001-06-15 02:56:00,21,"JT,We have been fishing the Morson area for about 10 years now. At the time you are going, the smallies should be ready to go. If you get a chance, go through Turlte Lake and portage your boat into Whitefish Bay. Just inside Whitefish we have experienced some of the best smallie and pike fishing we have ever seen. Look to the shallow weed/rock areas and you shall eventually come upon the smallies. The pike are using the new cabbage weedsand can be caught very easily with some big ones to boot. East side of Sabaskong Bay has some good areas for smallies as well.Good Luck"

Plan to be careful around the points.Fish are running Large (nice problem)many over the 19"" possession limit. Looking forward to our usual shore lunch feasts.Would like to hear cabbage growth and water temp, mayfly info from recent fish finders.Past exp. says that temps and weeds make all the differnce.JTGoodLuckJT >I'll be there next week, too. > Where are you staying? > I'm hearing water level >is 5' over normal. >Bill"
513270,Guest,2001-06-17 16:40:00,0,"Just returned yesterday from LOTW in the Morson area.Water temperatures are in the mid 60s on average. On Monday and tuesday surface temperature in the middle of the large bays was close or at 70 degrees In 10' of water the tops of cabage are about 5' below the surface. The deeper water reeds are beginning to show. Reeds in 3' of water or so are well up, but thin. Very few sandy areas were junk weeded in. Was a minimum mayfly hatch on Tuesday (last day of warm weather we had). Wind changed to the east on Wednesday a and a cold front came thru. Winds on Friday were running about 30 mph and shut down fishing for most-just too tough to fight it and most already had there walleye except for one and were hoping for a bigger fish. Some walleye anglers toughed it out and caught fish. Our party of three boats caught a lot of Northern Pike in the 25 -27"" range and a good number between 30-35"" No 40 inchers though. Lots of big walleye in the 6# range are being caught. Most of our walleye came in about 6' of water on crankbaits, some shallower. The walleye anglers reported walleye in the weeds and in 15' of water. We were primarily fishing for catch and release smallies with cranks, spinnerbaits and soft plastics, fishing shallow and down to about 8' deep. Numbers of fish caught in order were walleyes, northerns and smallies. The water is high. The resort owner says about 2' or more above normal. The floating dock comment is for real. In a Wednesday night storm the combination of high water and wind tore out a 50' dock. Some debris in the lake seen, not a lot though.Go to www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html for water level data on LOTW"
513271,Guest,2001-06-17 17:30:00,0,"Here's a site that you can see the water levels on LOW http://www.mvp-wc.usace.army.mil/imagemaps/Rainy.shtml.Looks to be a few deet high. Parents were in Morson area last week and did well on W'eyes in 8-10' with quite a few 22-25"" fish."
513272,AlwaysLearning,2001-06-17 17:44:00,13,"My friends and I returned from a LOTW trip today that began last Sunday. We rented a houseboat out of Morson and headed west and a bit north to the Firebag Island and Sandy Bay area. This is our fourth trip with the same vendor and to the same area. Like many have said before the water level is very high. Rocky shorelines and sandy beaches that were visible the past three years are under water today.Our group of seven concentrated on walleye's and smallmouth with some time spent fishing for northern. The fishing was good. Smallmouth were found along rocky (boulder)shorelines. Most of the bass were caught with tube jigs but many in our group experimented and caught bass on spinnerbaits and crankbaits. Our largest bass was just under 20 inches, most bass caught were in the 15 to 17 inch range.We found walleyes in a couple different areas. Some of our fish came from shoreline points and were caught using crankbaits. Most of our fish came from the transition area between rocky points and soft bottom and the same type of area with some off shore rocky humps. Bottom bouncers with crawlers and split shots with crawlers seemed to be the preferred presentations. Most fish were caught is the 6 to 12 foot depths with some coming shallower and a few in the 18 to 20 foot range. Our largest walleye went just under 8 lbs.The northerns were a bonus fish for us this year. For the past three years we have found the northern fishing to be slow. This year we spent some time fishing reed and cabbage areas with spinnerbaits and caught fish in the 3 to 5 foot depths. Our largest went 14 lbs.The weather was good most of the week with a pretty good storm that blew in late Thursday night and made fishing difficult on Friday. Water temps dropped from the high 60's with some 70 readings last Sunday to around 62 or 63 by Friday.We had a great time and will make the same trip again next year. Good luck and have a good time."
513273,PJM,2001-06-17 18:20:00,3516,"[font size=""1"" color=""#FF0000""]LAST EDITED ON Jun-17-01 AT 08:25PM (CST)[/font][p] I went up the this week from the 13th and came back 16th from Morson area and the weather was bad. According to the owners of Buena Vista the lake is the highest in 100 years. When I left Saturday morning all most all the docks at the resort were underwater and the boat house had 6inches of water in it. They were in jeopardy or loosing there docks and the wind was blowing 30 mph with gusts up to 40mph. With one front after another is was amazing we caught any fish. I hope your trip is better then mine. The weather just killed us but we did caught fish in Miles Bay and down by Rubber Island but we had to really work for them with the weather so bad. Good Luck it's a great lake....................."
513274,Guest,2001-06-17 19:28:00,0,I will be fishing the area The week of the 23rd.. IS the water still coming up? Or has it gone down a bit during the course of your stay? Is it as clear as your past trips or has the high water mudded it up? Also any idea what Gas is selling for on the water Morson Area? Sorry for all the question..getting excited.
