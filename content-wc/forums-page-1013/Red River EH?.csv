We are finding the cats have moved up into the tributary arms looking for spawning sites on the US end of the Red. Have the cats started to move to the marsh up on the Lake yet?Backwater Eddy...><,Go Piggy,>"

512474,Backwater Eddy,2001-05-13 03:37:00,3871,How is the river rolling up there guys? Is the cats on the bite & is the Selkirk Park up for use?Thank's!:)ED on the REd
512475,Guest,2001-05-14 06:46:00,0,"The government water resource branch's website listing water flow had the following info: At Lockport the flow this year on May 10 was 72,000 cfs [cubic feet per second], the upper highest average 10% flow is 63,000 cfs., and the long term median May 10 flow is 13,000 cfs. On Friday May 11 I visited both Selkirk park and End of Main, neither of which had their docks in due to high water and extreme current. I visited the Coast Guard in Selkirk and they STRONGLY advised against boating in the river. They stated that conditions should improve in 10-14 days. As for catfish I can't tell you anything until its safer to go on the river."

512477,Backwater Eddy,2001-05-17 23:59:00,3871,"The headwaters region of the Red river from Wahpeton ND to Fargo Moorhead has leveled off and the boat ramps are again usable in many areas. The remaining ramps will be cleaned up and ready for use very soon, this progression should fallow up the red to the border with most ramps ready to use by the end of next week, if we do not get any heavy rain fall before then.Walleye action has been fair to slow & will see a peak pre-summer bite as the river shiner run hits full swing in a week or so.The channel catfish action has been good and will be very good soon. Expect this to progress from the headwaters up the Red as conditions stabilize. Some of the best early season action is under way right now on the first 100 river miles of the Red.Good fishing.Backwater Eddy.....><,,>http://msnhomepages.talkcity.com/Res...wtr1/home.html"
512478,Northern Manitoban,2001-05-21 19:42:00,195,"Good catches at lockport last weekend 37 inchers being caught,i fished the floodway for 3 hours caught a couple small ones a nice 8 pound carp,seen 2 guys fight a couple cats for over 40 minutes only to lose them.Did see one around 10 pounds,going back in july fish lockport.FISH ON."
512479,Backwater Eddy,2001-05-24 05:20:00,3871,The Park open and usable at Selkirk yet? I heard the cats were starting to feed well in the diversion outlet area this week. May heard up in early June when I get a break here.Backwater Eddy
512480,chrism,2001-05-24 08:13:00,429,"BEI drove over the locks on the weekend to check it out - lots of current! There were 3 small boats out and it looked like a scarey situation. Docks were not in at the locks that I could see, but the boats must have launched somewhere...I'm heading to Selkirk in the next few days - I'll check out the park and get back to you. News is that the cats are starting to bite."
512481,Guest,2001-05-25 07:43:00,0,"I was out this morning,May 25. I tried to go to the ""End of Main"" first but the road was barricaded about 5 miles south of it and there was a sign stating the boat launch was closed.This is due to a severe storm last week with three days of strong north winds. I next tried Selkirk park. You have access to the launch site, but the docks are not in yet due to strong current. Since I was alone I didn't want to launch my boat and then hope it was still on shore after parking my truck. Hopefully the weather will improve soon."
512482,Backwater Eddy,2001-05-25 18:05:00,3871,"Thank's guys! Backwater Eddy.......><,,>"
512483,Guest,2001-06-08 12:31:00,0,"the cating is just starting still very slow because of the current. Was out last weekend and it was real slow, caught 25 over 2 days not that ##### hot. A couple of trophys. You might want to wait a bit before coming up, we were using 9 onces and we were still bouncing off bottom. the spillway sucked on floats. GOOD LUCK!!"
