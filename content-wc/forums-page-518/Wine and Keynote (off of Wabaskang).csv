Do they even exist?I've downloaded contour maps for many of the other lakes in the area from www.anglersatlas.com, but I can't find either of these lakes on the site.I'm wondering if it is even worth the hunt to find the other two.Regardless of the Keynote map, can somebody tell me how deep the lake is in general? When I fished it as a kid, we always stuck to the weedbeds on either end, and also fished the outlet creek into Wabaskang. I'll be at Wabby next may, and I'd like some idea of the depth in order to estimate how fast the water warms up down there."

The place warms up faster than anywhere else and is a great May/June spot to catch tons of walleye! If you are staying at Peffleys then I would just fish up there mainly in Gawleys Bay!

1229088,Guest,2010-08-19 15:18:00,0,Fished Keynote many years ago and caught quite of few walleyes just out of the channel leading to keynote where it starts to widen out. Maybe 8 to 12 fow. We anchored and then jigged. A few years later went back and did well northern fishing along the weed lines and just a little further out into open water.
