1229303,nitrodude,2010-08-20 10:36:00,60,The first time you hit a moose could easily be your last. It's not worth the risk as frequently they travel the roads after dark. Stick with daytime driving and you'll be glad you did.
1229308,tooski,2010-08-20 11:00:00,393,Not arguing with Nitro re: hitting a moose but--- 3 weeks ago my wife swerved to AVOID a moose at 4 in the morning. Totaled the van and we were lucky all the family survived. I spent three days in Geraldton hospital and the doctor there told me you are much better off to HIT the moose than lose control trying to avoid it. Apply brakes as hard as possible without losing control. Just a heads up to anyone traveling at nite. We never will again. As Nitro said- stick to daytime driving.
1229353,2746,2010-08-20 14:22:00,3206,Our group of six has been together for years. If we had an accident with a truck or boat the owner would expect to pick up the deductible tab but......the group would almost certainly insist it be split 6 ways. Just the kind of group it is. We've not been confronted with anything more than broken skegs or busted props but always the group has offered to pay.......and the boat owner has declined. Split 6 ways a $1000 deductible is only $150. I'd pay that in a heart beat in return for someone who had put his truck at risk for a group trip.Ditto on night time driving. Saw a picture of a nissan in a gas station in Dryden a few years back that had hit a moose on 502. Moose was intact with his rear end was on the hood and his head was on the trunk and the rest of his body laying in the car on the top seat backs. Once his legs were hit he had just crumpled on and into the car. Nasty!
1229538,jigman 2003,2010-08-21 17:16:00,981,"Also want to point out that depending on your insurance - swerving to avoid a moose may not be covered, however braking as hard as you safely can and ultimately hitting the moose will be covered under most insurance policies. Every bit of advice I've ever seen as far as hitting or attempting to swerve around suggests hitting is safer and more likely covered."
1228621,GOBIG,2010-08-18 04:03:00,126,"I read the post of hitting a deer. We have a group of 6-8, and usually rotate vehicles every year. What do you do if your buddy driving your truck hits the deer, or if you are driving their truck and hit a deer. Should the party help pay the deductible, or help pay for rental to get home. It has not happened to me, however, those roads are very dark and the moose blend in... Any thoughts."
1228627,Hawker,2010-08-18 05:02:00,3967,I think if your concerned about that being an issue it would be better to discuss with your group before it actually is an issue!
1228628,GOBIG,2010-08-18 05:16:00,126,We all get together in november. I was just wondering some other thoughts or ideas as to what would another group do. Thanks
1228630,SinOrSwim,2010-08-18 05:22:00,1528,"My thoughts are, if it's your truck then it's your deductible. If you don't want that risk then take your truck out of the rotation. I think accidents are much different than say a bad decision by someone who may cause damage. Then, that person should be responsible. But, and accident is a different story."
1228657,v-bay gord,2010-08-18 07:14:00,3168,I'ld be more concerned about walking away from the accident in one piece rather than who needs to pay. You could take it to the next level and worry about who picks up the tab for the casket should the moose scenario occur!!
1228660,tv4fish,2010-08-18 07:18:00,2694,"My advice --- don't drive ""up there"" in the dark Been there, done that (and won't do it again) --drive at night, that is. -- moose are STUPID !"
1228714,Steve of Madison,2010-08-18 09:44:00,230,"I couldn't agree more....leave the nightime driving to .....nobody!!!! Plan the trip so you don't drive at night. There are way to many nightime hazards, moose, deer, tire shreds, etc. etc to deal with when visibility is low. As far as sharing the expenses, our deal is, you did it you pay for it. I got a speeding ticket from the OPP, I paid for it. But, If someone else in my group is driving my truck responsibly and hits a deer or something, I still pay the deductable. If that was not OK, then I will just take my vehicle out of the rotation. But then again that's why I have the vehicle I do."
1228728,polaris-pete,2010-08-18 10:15:00,343,"Have everyone drive their own vehicle! That would end ANY problems ! Just kidding! To me, whoever decides to drive, should be covered under their own insurance.Myself, I would not ask anyone to chip in, same way my partners would never ask me to. Same thing in our boats. As stated earlier, moose and deer are all up North, especially at night. So if you don't need to travel then, don't. Our group does elcet to travel at night and so far in 37 years fishing Canada never had an accident. Close a few times but hoping it will last."
1228742,davenathe,2010-08-18 11:10:00,113,We always schedule our driving during the day. The damage a moose can do is serious.
1228838,lcwhit,2010-08-18 16:32:00,104,we drove up there one time at night. that was enough. ever seen a moose up close? those things are huge.
