The lodge was top notch as usual, tip-top cabins and boats (even though I bring my own).Walleyes were tough, minnows out fished crawlers and leeches. We caught numerous eyes in the 12"" to 14"" range, but the big ones were a tough bite. Previous years we caught many 18"" - 26"" fish, this year we put six in the boat in that slot.Musky were following - on the lazy side though. DCG, shallow invaders, medium bull dawgs and weighted suicks worked well for me. Others reported that bucher depth and shallow raiders were raising fish. I put a 38.5"" in the boat and missed a few others.Overall a great trip, water was high and surface temps were around 75 degrees. Hopefully going back next year, either earlier or later...tight-lines..."
1228899,shortmag,2010-08-18 20:38:00,70,Which resort? Understand they had an epic mayfly hatch. What causes a lake to turn off like it seemingly did much of the year(compared to most years)?
1229682,Guest,2010-08-22 13:08:00,0,I fished Canyon in June. I would say you might be pushing the envelope a little bit when you say 12-14 in. fish. Anywhere we went we caught 11 1/2 to 12 1/2 inchers. More than likely these will end up being gobbled up over the next few years by the over abundance of 28 to 35 inch muskie in the lake.

He posts a non-embellished fishing report.....gives some details.......and obviously enjoyed the experience (even though it wasn't a banner year for him) and is anxious to go back. On the other hand lazy eye seems to take issue with a 1/2 inch. Two possibilities......the fish have grown in over two months (seems logical), or Sammy was just a luckier fisherman (seems possible)."
1230005,plumberjoe,2010-08-23 17:07:00,54,Our group fished the same week as Sammy. We stayed at North Country and had a great time. We caught between 175 and 200 walleye and 75% were 14 to 15 inches. Our group was 2 adults and 2 kids. Our largest fish was 23.
1230103,Guest,2010-08-23 20:31:00,0,Gord yes it was a great report. I will not take that away from Sammy. It is a unique lake and a unique fishery. And quite possibly the fish have grown since the end of June. The fish we caught in June were all cut from the exact same year class and it looked like they spread the feed bag around fairly even. That being said-- there is also a huge year class that is(should be) in the 15-16 inch range that turned on last fall that no one can seem to find.
