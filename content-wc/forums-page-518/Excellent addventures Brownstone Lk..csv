1228914,Weby13,2010-08-18 21:37:00,57,Does anyone have info on Excellent Adventures (Ear falls) Brownstone Lake outpost. Im looking to book a fly in outpost and Ive heard some good things about this outfitter. I was just wondering about the lake!
1229008,phishfearme,2010-08-19 11:20:00,1242,"we were at brownstone in 2000 with faron and joyce and this may sound weird but brownstone lake was terrible fishing but we had one of the best trips ever. brownstone itself seemed like it was fished out with very few and very small fish - but the three portage options (to shearstone lake which i think is no longer an option as they lost the LUP for a boat stash there, down river and then to a smaller lake which was unnamed) were very good to incredible. at the time shearstone had essentially never been fished and produced and incredible array of nice sized walleye and trophy pike. the little portage lake also produced a hugh amount of small walleye and also a number of nice size pike. towards the middle of the week, we stopped wasting our time on brownstone and only portaged. we very much missed evening fishing but the portage lakes were incredible. this info is abit dated but i would be very careful here and ask faron for names of people who were there last year. the lake would concern me but the outfitter is excellent and will provide an excellent adventure for you - talk him into taking you to one of his boat cache lakes. phish"

When it was blowing most of the windward shores and islands produced fish. The six of us averaged about 20-30 walleyes a day (each), not good, compared to the other lakes we have fished with Joyce and Faron. We never really target the pike so can't really comment on them. We jigged leeches and minnows for most of the fish. Trolled red eye spoons did pick up a few eyes and pike. Enjoy"

The fishing was fair at best, the cabin was filthy and full of mice. Deckboards were rotten on both the deck and on the boat cradles - nothing like worrying about a broken leg in the middle of the night when nature calls. Speaking of nature calling - EA advertises this cabin as having an ""indoor flush toilet"". We thought - great, no stumbling around in the dark. Apparently an indoor flush toilet is a urinal (with no ""p"" trap to keep the stench of old urine from backing up). The water pump quit working on day 3 - tried using sat. phone they provided to contact them. No signal for 2 days - seemed kind of odd in that it was clear during that time and the lake was only a short 20 minute flight or so. I'm sure plenty of customers are happy with EA and to them I say - fantastic. I however am not one of them (nor were the other 3 guys) and will never even consider using their services again."
