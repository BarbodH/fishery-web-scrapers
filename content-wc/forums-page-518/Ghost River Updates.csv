1225192,Lenman,2010-08-04 19:53:00,19,"Got back on Sunday. This was my 4th trip to Ghost River Lodges and definitely my best - both in the number of fish and my biggest Northern yet. I nailed a 40"" in Clamshell Lake! Our slowest day was our last as we tromped around Marchington Lake and only caught 18 or 19 fish in total. To be fair we were fishing deep running plugs for big Northern and Walleye about 90% of the time. We caught fish everywhere we tried with only 2 exceptions! We had a few 50+ days and 1 over 75+. The biggest walleye the wife and I caught was 23"" (many in the 16"" ~ 21"" range). Great weather with only one rainy day and a few rainy evenings. 1 week, 2 people, 220 ~ 250 fish for 6 days of fishing. Overall this was my best outing in Canada. I hope we have $'s and time next year because we'll be back!!!!!!!!! You know it was a good week when your hands hurt from catching and releasing so many fish!"
1227843,Guest,2010-08-15 07:40:00,0,glad to here you had fun. No trip to Zarn? We always catch our biggest northerns in Stanzakimi. Who cares though you had fun! Your friend from the Hawk Town Iowa.
1227891,Tailfin,2010-08-15 10:26:00,9,We're heading up in 12 days. Hoping to find some Northern too! Was the water low enough to go thru the tunnel?
1227936,lcwhit,2010-08-15 14:35:00,104,believe it had to be if he went to clamshell
1229530,Lenman,2010-08-21 16:14:00,19,The water was high but it was low enough to get through the tunnel. I put a youtube video of the tunnel trip out there. Check out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bwxRVkHC8c for this. This was our best trip ever. Only one or two days with less than 50 fish. Hope all is just as good for you. Ask Daryl or Don to tell you where the fish are and you should have no problem!
1218812,Lenman,2010-07-13 19:41:00,19,"Going up in less than 2 weeks! Can't wait. Anyone just getting back? Any insight on conditions, water levels, hot spots, etc? Thinking of trying Zarn out for lakers."
1218855,1shooter,2010-07-13 21:37:00,1493,Hate to tell you but the area has been fished out.... You'll be lucky to catch a perch.
1218897,Lenman,2010-07-14 05:37:00,19,"Come on now ... let's be nice. This will be my 4th trip there and I know that Ghost River Lodge is a great place to fish, catch and stay. Many lakes and plenty of nice sized fish. I also know several people that have been there and have had great fishing! Unless of course you're speaking of Zarn Lake specifically, then I'd like to know about your experience that you draw on to base that statement... I haven't been in Zarn yet, but I want to go on this trip! Have you fished Zarn in the summer?"
1218924,Skyraptor,2010-07-14 06:25:00,291,My brother is there this week fishing with 5 other people. I will post a report once I talk to him. I was there 2 years ago and the whole lake chain area is NOT fished out. We had a great time and caught plenty of walleyes and northerns. They manage their fishery very well. Got to love posters who spew at the mouth and then never explain themselves. Guess that poster does not know how to fish. Have been going to Canada for 35 years and have visited many lodges and Ghost River is right up there with the best in all aspects.
1218937,Larry Mac,2010-07-14 07:04:00,530,"I must agree whole heartedly with Skyraptor. We have fished Ghost River many times and it is one of the best walleye fisheries we have found. We have experienced many 100+ fish days, several 200+ fish days, the owners and staff are great. Zarn is a tougher lake to get to and is noted for Lakers in the spring. Ghost River lodges is still my favorite “go to” lodge for easy, fast action walleye. Lenman have a great trip, we will talk later.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1219180,DoorCo,2010-07-14 18:02:00,14,I also have nothing but positive things to say about Ghost River. Have been there several times and always enjoyed the fishing and accomodations. In fact decided to try a moose hunt this fall. Anyone have any past experience hunting moose at Ghost River that can provide me with any tips??
1220104,Carl1,2010-07-17 16:28:00,3,Make sure to sign up with Tina to save the boat on Zarn.We use 2.5 oz bullet lures. Not sure you can get them anymore. The color to use is Blue. Blue and White. At the end of July fish are 60 to 80 ft deep. Leave early as it takes some time to get there. Bug spray for the walk from Rock Lake to Zarn.Your biggest suprise will be the water. Crystal clear to almost blue colored. Not the iron color of the main lakes.
1220105,Carl1,2010-07-17 16:36:00,3,"MoreMake sure to take a locator. Drive around the lake slowy. When you see the fish in the 60-80 foot range, stop and verticle jig. You will need heavy lures. You will also see your lures on the depth finder, so it is easy to keep track of the fish depth and your lure depth. It really is a simple thing to do.Big Northerns too."
1220132,nlar,2010-07-17 18:12:00,3,"Just got back late Thursday night, this was out first time there and in my 30 plus trips to Canada this rates toward the top. The weather was good, had moose swim in front of us on the lake and the fishing was outstanding (Don will put you on the fish). Being our first time we stayed on Marchington for this year, Don at Sturgeon river saved me 3-4 days of just looking for fish. We had good luck in the bays in 5-6' of water in the weeds, also the main lake reefs in 10-15' and also 20-25' around the reefs, this should tell you something on the number of fish in this system. The tunnel has now been renamed the ""Tunnel of terror"" ask Don about that, it was a ride to remember nothing happened but the water level is up enough and the current is moving that it was liked being sucked into a amusement park ride, got the heart pumping (I didn't hit either side on the way through!). Thanks for the tips Larry as we brought a bunch of perch home from Clamshell, (Don say's hi back at you) the only problem was it was tough to catch the perch because we couldn't keep the walleye off our hooks. We are going again next year for sure, I didn't keep track of the numbers but it was in excess of 300 for our trip. I have never caught so many 15-19' walleyes in my life, I did have a portable GPS/Sonar (Eagle Cuda 350s) that was worth its weight in gold. The morning we were leaving at about 0615 a bull moose was standing on the lawn in front of our cabin, I accused Don that he must have let it out of the pen just as we were leaving to stoke us up to come back. I would highly recommend this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1220143,Larry Mac,2010-07-17 19:36:00,530,"Hi nlar, I am so glad to hear you had a great trip to Ghost River. Sounds like you had one of those special trips. It is so great when everything comes together. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
