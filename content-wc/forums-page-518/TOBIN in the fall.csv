We generally try to plan our trip around the October full moon...this year the peak is Oct. 23rd, which is the day we arrive. Pull lots of big cranks like reef runners, deep taildancers and bomber long a's in the river at night. Also, don't miss out on the excellent fishing for big pike in the main lake."

We pull alot of bombers, tail dancers, manns, and deep thundersticks. We try and stay right on the channel edge between 18-25 ft."
