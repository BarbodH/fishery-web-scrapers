1229067,jka333,2010-08-19 13:55:00,14,the service is great and fishing excellent on the chain there. I've always stayed at Gawley's in PF......exceptional. everything works.... we always go in august.....always come back with the limit of perch for 4 guys.....as well as eyes and N's. that's after shore lunch every day when our eyes are bulging with fillets. all the PF outfitters are good. I've never left gawley's as he's always fulfilled our needs....both expected and unexpected. J from MSN

1222511,jsmyers,2010-07-26 14:41:00,198,"I think that everybody agrees that there isn't a bad one on the lake. It is a matter of what is important to you. For instance, is a really nice cabin, a really nice boat motor, or a really nice price important?There are few individuals who have stayed at more than one of the camps in order to offer a first hand comparison."
1222623,JAY221,2010-07-26 19:25:00,877,"I agree with jsmeyers. I have never hears anything bad about any camp on the lake. I have stayed @ Kingfishers twice, once with the previous owner & once with the current owner & this owner & crew is one of the best I have stayed with in Canada. We didn't want for anything. I have talked to people from other camps & never heard a complaint about any. Later, Jay"
1222791,warrior2090,2010-07-27 11:20:00,12,"I have been staying at Peffley's Camp since 1985 (When it was Morgans Camp). Hard to beat the isolation since it is the only camp on that part of the lake. A twelve mile boat ride from the road gets you into camp. Wabaskang is a great lake to fish and it seems like a lot of the boats from other camps make the long boat ride up to the area where Peffley's is at. Nice cabins, great service. Be happy answer any question you have. Send me an email if you want a call."

1223149,jsmyers,2010-07-28 14:21:00,198,"I'll be up there the week before. I'll probably post some kind of report when I get back, so if you read this board while you are up there, I might have some tips for you.But we'll mostly be targeting pike, so I don't know how much help that will be to you."
1223329,teddi,2010-07-29 06:15:00,349,glad to hear you booked at sleepy dog. first class place and tommy is a first class guy. you will be very happy with your choice.
1223549,Guest,2010-07-29 18:16:00,0,We'll probably see you there! You will not be disappointed with the accomodations.
1225920,Kevin R,2010-08-08 07:54:00,305,I would also say best central location.
1226206,jigmeister,2010-08-09 08:42:00,34,bk walker are you going to be up that week? would like to hear about the fishing that time of year.would love to do some ultralight perch fishing.we have cabin 3.looking forward to hearing from you.jig..
1221850,jigmeister,2010-07-23 12:55:00,34,"would like some info,input ,on the drive to resorts on wabaskang.we are definitely fishing wabby,and need reviews..positives and negatives of sleepy dog cabins,tall pines camp,kingfisher resort,and wabaskang resort.we will be fishing last week of may first week of june 2011.considerations being..location on lake,accomodations,boats and motors,and services offered from the camp.we are not novice fishermen,but new to this lake.fishing tips for this time of year will be welcomed as well.(especially for the perch).i have given my knowledgeable opinion on many subjects on this site and am now asking for yours.thanks in advance..jig goooone!!!"
1221860,teddi,2010-07-23 13:21:00,349,sleepy dog is by far your best bet. tommy can help you better than anyone else i know. he has lived on the lake all his life and knows it better than anyone else.
1221861,jsmyers,2010-07-23 13:26:00,198,"I just booked a group for May 21-28 on Wabaskang (Peffley's).I contacted all of the lodges, we where considering going in the 3 weeks after as well. Many of the camps had little or no vacancy during some of those weeks.I think you should make some calls or emails to see what your options are.I haven't fished the lake in 15 years, and I've only stayed at Gawleys then, so I might not be the best source for input on your questions. But I can say that I've never heard or read anything bad about any of the camps. I think it mostly depends on what is important to you. There seems to be some range in prices, services, and accommodations.As for perch in the early season. That is a good question that I'd also like to hear the answer too. I'd suspect you'd find them where mayfly nymphs are along with warm water and early weeds, but I have no experience with them at that time of year. They usually spawn about that time, right. How does that affect the fishing?"
1221864,jsmyers,2010-07-23 13:40:00,198,If you create a login at http://www.anglersatlas.com/ you can find and download two maps of the lake. (You can also purchase printed copies.)One map is a detailed topographic map of the entire area. The other is a slightly rough contour map of the lake. Search the archives of the board for a lot more fishing and navigation help.
1221877,Stu,2010-07-23 15:17:00,472,"Just got back from Wabby last week. Lots of perch were caught (but not by us). I've never been there that early, but a couple guys from work go and do really well on the 'eyes. Nobody in our group fishes for perch, at least not on purpose. We always stay at Tall Pines, but I've heard nothing but good things about all of the resorts there. Good luck - Stu"
1221879,Stu,2010-07-23 15:28:00,472,"Hey Teddi, where is Sleepy Dog? From their map, it looks like they are right next to the falls, but I thought that was Kingfisher?"
1221924,teddi,2010-07-23 18:32:00,349,sleepy dog is about 1\2 mile before you get to perrault falls on the right if you are heading north. tommy has lived there all his life. he also used to own wine lake camp before[his dad built it]. if you are talking to him tell him rod says to say hello.[may help]
1222028,Guest,2010-07-24 10:39:00,0,"You should really look at what you want for your experience. Do you want to be around a lot of other fisherman on the east side of the lake...Kingfishers, Gawleys or Sleepy Dog are all there. Jim & Julies and Pines cover the South East section of the lake. Pelfrey's is North West and further away than most of the boats from the East will travel and if you REALLY want to get away for people, Wine Lake. If you want access to town, supplies, etc., stay East and South. If you want seclusion, go North and West and bring in what you need for the week. Fishing is fishing...pressure lighter out Northwest."
1222033,teddi,2010-07-24 11:11:00,349,read the first post. he is looking for a drive to resort not a boat in
1222284,trapper_john,2010-07-25 19:00:00,83,This was our sixth year on Wabbie and we've always been very satisfied with KingFisher. The camp is very nice. Lester (dock hand) is really great for putting you on fish. We came back the eleventh of July and caught walleyes till we got tired of it. We've never stayed at any of the other camps because we were so pleased with the service and the way the camp was run. I would not even consider another camp.
