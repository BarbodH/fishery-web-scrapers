1227933,Tailfin,2010-08-15 14:24:00,9,A friend of says that coming in from the SW the road stops for construction and you have to go around by the mill. Anyone have any more info on that? Thanks
1227959,Uncle Fish,2010-08-15 16:24:00,32,I went thru on friday last week follow the short detour no problem.
1228061,Skywagon,2010-08-16 05:18:00,1106,"The detour is no big deal, it connects into highway 17 and goes past some business you may not normally see, while only taking a couple of minutes longer. Think of it as a way to see more of the workings of a pulp mill, plus the added benefit of driving right by a Dairy Queen."
1228156,fishingMN4eyes,2010-08-16 12:40:00,109,"Yep, it isn't a big deal at all. It's a breeze."
1228168,Golden Eagle,2010-08-16 13:11:00,2642,Detours are no big deal for a guy who drives a Cessna with floats.
1228235,Skywagon,2010-08-16 16:28:00,1106,"Yes, but it is a long walk from the lake to the Dairy Queen, though if this rainy weather doesn't quit, I may be able to land on 17."
1228242,Golden Eagle,2010-08-16 16:58:00,2642,"The Dairy Queen in Dryden is a welcome sight after a week or two or three in the bush, but they don't match my deep fried walleyes."
1228770,dogrodder,2010-08-18 12:15:00,400,"Go east till the road stops, turn left. Go north till the road stops, turn left. Go west till you get to the beer store, stop for necessary goods. Continue west till you come to the detour and turn north. The road goes under an overpass and hooks you back up with 17. Yes this route runs east of the mill and along the river. Have a great time up north."
