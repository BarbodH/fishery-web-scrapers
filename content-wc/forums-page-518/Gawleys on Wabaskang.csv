I am sure the other camps are nice also but for me I really like their camp and for the price you can't beat it."

The other thing is the number of people in the Gawley camp due to the campground. I go to Canada to #1 fish, but #2 is to get away from the ""masses"". Hard to do that in the falls area. Check out Peffley's...a good 35 minute cruise away from the falls and you can get to water where you won't see another boat all day if you want."
1206496,Kevin R,2010-06-03 04:51:00,305,That much less per person ? I think most camps range no more than about 100 per person in that area (some have meal plans that would be the main price increase) & if you want remote Wine lake or Aerobus lake have boat in or fly in camps in the same cost range.

I love the expansive water, the great perch, eye, northern, bass fishing on the chain. more than that, Ray and son and family are wonderful hosts. It's why I choose no other. I've heard many camps in the PF area are good. For me, it's hard to leave a guy who gives a great value and bends over backwards to meet your needs....expected and unexpected."
