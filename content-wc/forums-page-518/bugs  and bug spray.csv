1229300,nitrodude,2010-08-20 10:30:00,60,"When the bugs get bad we break out a Thermacell and put it in the middle of the boat and the bugs clear out fast. That and the highest Deet content spray (Muskoll, Buck's or the like) applied to the hat, sleeves and pant cuffs have worked great these past several years. A good cigar never hurts, too!"
1229426,bpetersen,2010-08-20 20:10:00,251,Thermocell if you can afford it and light a coil for your cabin. The coils really work well and not very expensive. We were invaded by no-see-ums that came through the cabin screens in June. They were biting little you know whats.
1229479,RANDY @ ORD,2010-08-21 09:41:00,13,"We used a Thermacell last year and it worked very good. Placed it in the fish cleaning house and came back 5 min. later and all the ""skeeters/flys/no seeums were gone. Works good on floor of boat however if you have a strong breeze or any kind of wind from boat movement you seem to loose the repellent ""fog"" and you need to wait for it to recover the area again. Kind of high $$ but you can get refills of both fuel and repellent pads. Cabels flyer shows them on sale now in a 2-pack."
1229533,bigtimeelectric,2010-08-21 16:27:00,174,ultrathon works great just got back from low and it really saved the lower legs in the boat
1229607,polaris-pete,2010-08-22 07:39:00,343,I saw this advertised ( Allterrain herbal lotion) awhile back and wanted to try some. I contacted the Company and got a few sample packs.There is no DEET in this and after using it up in Northwestern Ontario for a weeks fishing found it very effective on the balck flies and mosquitoes and better yet kept the biting horseflies off while in the woods.This stuff is nice smelling and its a lotion and non-sticky and does not harm plastic.It goes on as a lotion and quickly drys.It lasts for about 6 hours before needing more. Very pleased with this stuff and will be ordering more for our next trip.They also make a lot of other Outdoor insect stuff.
1229646,J-Man,2010-08-22 09:55:00,191,"Watkins Insect Repellent Lotion....Back in the days of gravel pit bonfires, I would come away unscathed during some of the worst skeeter infestations in history up here. Also worked wonders when having to go dig around in the woods looking for my errant tee shots in Manitoba back when I played a little golf in high school.28.5% deet. Smells like a stronger lotion. www.watkinsonline.com - is the website on the bottle. Between Manitoba and NW Ontario, I would have to say they are the two best places around to field test this kind of stuff!"
1228840,eyemike,2010-08-18 16:44:00,233,I also burn coils in the cabin which works great. I use Repel 29% deet and get along quite well. I also spray the screens in the cabins with Yard Guard to keep out the no-see-ums.
1228907,fish bookie,2010-08-18 21:07:00,53,looks like i will be taking more bug spray then fishing equip. ha ha ha that will never happen!!! with all these suggestions what kind of coils are you talking about the citrinilla ones or something else and i do agree that deet melts fishing equip. and when it gets on your hands the fish do not like it either in there mouths and bait dies its more for when we get back to camp you know the misquetos they just come and f...ing eat you alive thanks to everyone any other suggestions let me know i leave in 49 hours but whos counting i will try the s o s and the 28% deet stuff for sure thanks again the fish bookie
1228908,fish bookie,2010-08-18 21:12:00,53,"I love the sound of that cigar what is your flavor that you like ""the one that keeps the bugs away "" ha ha let me know i love a good cigar fish bookie"
1228943,fmck,2010-08-19 06:30:00,22,i was on lake erie last week on a dead calm day there were millions of gnats little green bugs and biting flies it was insane the guy i was with took out a little gadget called a Thermocell it lights and gets hot 20 min later all the bugs were gone dont know how it works but ive never seen anything work so well.ive fished in canada in may and tried everything even eating raw garlic that works a little but this thermocell is the best ive seen yet..
1228944,jmusso,2010-08-19 06:31:00,170,"I have not had luck with any product with less than 40% deet. I have also heard, but not tried yet, that if you can get Lavender spray, that is supposed to help great with flies and ok with mosquitos. Anyone else hear this?"
1228957,troutwater,2010-08-19 07:16:00,299,I've tried the clip on OFF bug repellant and it seemed to work alright the one night I tried it. Anyone else tried it? The 2 people I've heard from so far say it's wonderful.
1228997,Moondog,2010-08-19 10:01:00,362,Worked very well in the bottom of the boat for black flies. Not so hot otherwise. Sat on a picnic table on night talking with thing clipped to my belt and something crawled up my pants legs and bit me as high as my knee. AAARRRGH 100% DEET was the answer. You can get little spray bottles of it in the sports section at Wally World.

1229090,MorganMan,2010-08-19 15:19:00,341,It's another spray (cream/lotion too??) that is made by 3M. Supposed to last 8 or 12 hours and has DEET......don't know how much though.
1228637,fish bookie,2010-08-18 06:05:00,53,"has anyone had any sucess with a good bug spray in canada them lil baster?'s eat us up what works for you all ""off "" doesn't work for us at gullrock and pure extract vanilla works for knats but not misquetos any help is good help thanksthe fish bookie"
1228663,Bill Krejca,2010-08-18 07:30:00,6107,"If you are talking inside the cabin, I have found burning a coil very successful in killing bugs that have made it inside. Bill Krejca"
1228730,Blue Lk,2010-08-18 10:16:00,269,"I use Deep Woods Off or Muskol,works for me.The original stuff with Deet.On the deck in the evening I lite up my Off candle or my Thermocell."
1228749,JayM5209,2010-08-18 11:30:00,1050,"A really good cigar helps, too!!"
1228759,TIGHTLINER,2010-08-18 11:52:00,223,Try using avon skin so soft.. This is the bath and body not the stuff they came out with for bugs because i have tried that and it don't work.. A couple of sprays in the am about noon and in the evening should do it. Repels black flies and other bugs as well. Besides that makes you smell good but make sure you tell your wife you are using or it could get you in trouble. I buy the bottle with the spray head.. I have used it for years with no problems from the bugs..
1228771,leogunner,2010-08-18 12:16:00,18,Off Power Pad lanterns seem to work for us when outdoors
1228780,dudleydoright,2010-08-18 12:47:00,6,"used deep woods off 'sportsman' (98% deet) last week up in western quebec and did not get a bite, runs about $6.00 for one ounce spray bottle. stuff works great!!!!!!!"
1228798,octanehi5,2010-08-18 14:01:00,1104,"Do right you got it if the product you are using doesn't have 98% deet and you put this on your person,it will not work up nord, that deep woods off they think that stuff is gravy they dip the bread in it and then bite you"
1228799,jokerjim,2010-08-18 14:07:00,473,Be careful when using any product with alot of deet. They work great but alot of the plastic parts on your fishing equipment do not take kindly to any contact with deet.
1228829,Tylumps,2010-08-18 16:03:00,73,I have a video showing a bottle of skin so soft coated in blackflies. The stuff actually attracts the little nuggets. Deet is the magic ingredient for keeping off the black flies.
