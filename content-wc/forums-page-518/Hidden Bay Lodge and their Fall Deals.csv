Hidden Bay is offering some very good fly in fishing deals during the month of August.If you have been fishing with them in the past, I would love to hear your story before I decide to book one of their trips.Seems like some cheap fishing I can take advantage of.Thanks for your help"

Walleye numbers good and easy lakes to fish--not much in the 25"" plus category. Accomodations good. I'd try and check with somebody who has been there more recently as far as the accomodations are concerned."
1226355,Ryan Coke,2010-08-09 16:52:00,9,"Thanks Bitinlight!I've called up Hidden Bay and spoke with ""Shaggy"", yep that what they call him I guess.Shaggy was full of good information and was very friendly answering my questions.I'm 90% there to booking. This seems to good of a deal to pass up. 2 for 1 fishing, WOW!I would appreciate any other info that one of you could provide. Thanks!Ryan"
1226512,Bitinlight,2010-08-10 08:10:00,95,"We had some good fishing there during the six years we used them as our outfitter. Like I said before, great numbers, but no super-size. 25 "" plus fish were few and far between. Nothing over 25. Cabins Ok but sometimes lacked some small things--had to be innovative and make do. Boats only 14 footers with 9.9's, but big enough for those lakes(Armit and Gage). Boat seats were uncomfortable to fish all day. They took care of us pretty well as far as food. The last year we went, we were limited in weight because they were trying to cut back on fuel consumption due to increase in fuel costs. First couple years, they would always fly in about mid-trip to give us more ice or anything we needed, but they quit doing that, I'm sure because of the fuel costs. Standard bait--jig and crawler tip or jig and salted or preserved minnow. Plain plastic worked too when you got into them. I would assume that with the invention of Gulp, that would be good also. My buddy also had good luck with bottom bouncers and spinners. I'd still try to get some more current information. The lady who owns it is a super-nice woman, and I think she is still running the show. I'd find out who they are using to fly guests in or if they still are using their own."
1226698,55walleyes,2010-08-10 18:44:00,131,I have went to Hidden Bay for around 20 years. Shaggy is great to work with. Went to Highstone Lake on one of the specials in June. Fishing was OK not great but it was first trip to that lake. I have always gone to their Hooker Lake outpost in the past and fishing there is always great but some kind of problem with Canadian government closed that lake. Their food package is very good. Cabins and facilities are not super nice but more than adequate for an outpost. I would go if I was you.
1227802,Ryan Coke,2010-08-14 22:27:00,9,"Thanks Guys!I've got it booked. What a great deal! 2 for 1 including food. Leaving in a couple days.I'll submit a report when I get back, or even from the outpost it self. Shaggy tells me that they have internet out at the outpost cabin including a computer provided. How cool is that!!?Now the Question remains to Gulp or not Gulp? I'll get some minnows to.Happy Fishing!Ryan"

Here's our report!Just returned home from our 4 day fly in trip With Hidden Bay Lodge in Sioux Lookout Ontario.The 4 of us flew to their cabin on Miniss lake, and all I can say is ""WOW""The Fishing is fantastic! We Caught 2 - 30"" and 1 - 31"" Walleyes and 1 40"" Northern. The fishing was very steady. Good sizes and numbers. Never a dull moment.The folks at Hidden Bay Lodge were amazing! They are very hospitable, even called us a couple times over their outpost satellite internet phone to see how we were doing and if there was anything we needed on the check flight. That was a great to know they were looking out for us. The food provided package is the way to go. No need to worry and work on getting all your food together before your drive to Canada, only to have their customs take stuff away, like in years past. Hidden Bays food provisions was well stocked and we didn't go hungry. The BBQ Chickens were delicious, and dont get me started on the home made pies!Their 2 for 1 special is an amazing deal, I hope they will have them again next year. Regardless, We would pay full rate for their services and the fishing. Well done Hidden Bay!!!Ryan"
