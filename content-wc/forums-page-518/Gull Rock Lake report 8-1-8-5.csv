1227787,Pezman38,2010-08-14 21:02:00,3196,"The spinners we used had 1 bead before the clevis, and 6 after, size 3 or 4mm. Hook is a 2/0 or 3/0, put the hook in minnows mouth through gill and back through body. Use an interchangable clevis to swith colors and sizes. Bead colors vary, chart and red worked for us."
1227845,fish bookie,2010-08-15 07:48:00,53,thanks for the info i'll try it out the fish bookie
1227874,2746,2010-08-15 09:04:00,3206,The good thing about Gullrock is nearly anything will catch fish there. After fishing there for nearly 10 years we have gone almost exclusively to a plain snell with a colored hook and one or two beads. No spinner. Just enough weight (usually 3/8 oz sliding sinker) to make contact witht eh bottom. Makes for inexpensive tackle as we tie our own and we find they produce more consistantly than spinners. Just our experience.
1227875,Habitual Eyer,2010-08-15 09:07:00,144,"I would really rather discuss spinners, minnows, Gulp baits and other effective Gull Rock presentations but Frankill has posted some very damaging comments(that, by the way, are completely unrelated to the thread topic). Further discussion only gives these comments WAY more attention than they deserve. But I can't leave it alone......The Wrights try WAY too hard for these comments to be posted without the proper reply. Someone tags along on ONE trip and they feel they have a situation pinned down acurately enough to post on a public forum?? C'mon. Let me give a perception based on MANY trips as I feel the need to warn the public as well. The owners of Wrights are not ""soaks', or ""Lushes"". They will make you feel welcome and if invited, they will interact with you and may accept a beer if offered. After many trips to Wrights i have never had the owner 'ask"" me for a beer. He has offered many times though. Cause he's a great guy. Will he go door to door trying to drink everyones beer?? No......but he might join in an evening poker game, or a picknic table bull session. Be carefull though...he may accept a beer if offered. If you can't handle that, THEN DON""T OFFER. They work hard all day, then sometimes will socialize with their guests in the evening. Not like they walk around with a beer in their hand all day (as a typical lush would). Warning.....if the owners see your kids wondering around camp in the evening looking a little bored.....they may forget about the poker or picknic table's (or even their own ""off duty"" personal time) and offer to take them into town (along with their own great kids) for ice cream. Warning folks...the owners just might put in some extra effort to take care of the special needs some guests might have like making phone calls to gather information for a field trip off the lake (which sometimes is needed after two weeks of pounding walleyes). Warning folks...the owner will stop what he is doing and do everything in his power to get you on fish if he notices you are struggling. Warning folks...the dock boy might socialize with you in the evenings. These are usually very fine young men, who are many miles away from home and their families, for a full summer, and will set their beer down RIGHT NOW to take care of any need you might have in the off duty evening hours and even forget the evening socializing and play catch with your son. They will be on call all day and most of the time they will get you what you need before you even ask for it. So lets give these young men the credit they deserve and not tear them down because they drank a few of your beers. Warning folks....when you give the Wrights your money...you WILL get the following in return: -The cleanest, best equiped camp on the lake. -A camp that offers the best location as far as easy access to the best fishing spots on Gull Rock. -Owners who apreceate your buisness and stop to take the time to prove it. -Some of the best walleye fishing of any drive-to-camp anywhere. (Folks...Gull Rock is flat out loaded with fish). My wife and I have traversed NW Ontario for many years looking for that one lake and Camp that has it all. We believe we have found it on Gull Rock at Wrights. The owners are young, hard working, year round residents of the Red Lake area that are enjoying being part of the tourism industry and it truly shows in many ways. I am confident the warnings of a ""ONE TIME TAG ALONG"" like Frankill won't spoil the Wrights friendly attitude. There Frankill...we both have spoke, and done our civic duty to warn the public.....lets leave this alone now and keep this thread focused on Gull Rock baits."
1227895,Habitual Eyer,2010-08-15 10:48:00,144,"Fish Bookie, It is nice to change up once in a while and do something different. We have in the past pulled spinners during the mid-day when the fish scatter, move a little deeper, and don't have the feed bag on like they do in the morning or evening. Jig bite has been on fire for us the last couple of years that we found it hard to pull anything else out. As CSTALZER said, the ability to change blades with out changing harnesses (quick change clevises) is a big plus. Gold or hammered copper has also worked real well for us. Having a weight that will stay in contact with the bottom without getting hung up is key. We have found the Cabela's flex-o-sinker works very well. A four-five foot lead from the sinker to the spinner seems to help us as compared to shorter leads while not being so long a lead that you can't land fish. Blade size is important. We try to stay small. This enables us to go very slow yet still maintain a decent blade spin. Important to hook the minnow as CSTALZER stated. Trolling presentation like this requires a minnow, but not really a live one. So don't be afraid to push the hook as far down the minnow as possible as this will help hook up with some of the short biters. Most camp boats will back troll slowly enough to fish this way. I've seen many of the locals on Gull Rock simply bump around structure with a bottom bouncer as well (maybe one once?) with nothing more than an 18-24"" leader with a bare hook tipped with a minnow. This is a little more of a verticle presentation while still staying on the move targeting some of the deeper scattered fish. We have been very tempted to try targeting bigger fish using cranks. If we were to have noticed an area out in the deeper water showing suspended fish on the graph, then we would hammer the cranks. Only problem is it seems that everything you mark is hugging the bottom. Difficult to contour troll a crank that tight to the bottom without losing it fairly quick. Maybe others are better at this than I. Trolling spinners is sometimes a great way to find new hot spots and learn an area or lake as you spend alot of time looking at your graph as you cover different shorelines at different depths.."
1228084,Pezman38,2010-08-16 08:01:00,3196,"Habitual Eyer, I agree with everything you have stated about the camp and the wonderful folks that run it. I have only missed one year since Stephanie and Lee took over (I got married). They are excellent people and I enjoy seeing them each year. I will continue to drive 20hrs to stay with them as they make me feel at home each time. On to trolling cranks, We used to have really good luck with them in certain spots, however, I lost about 3 cranks in 15 mins one time and have since stopped trying. I think the best way to approach this would be to troll shallow minnow style baits like original Rapalas or Smithwick Rogues on either a 3-way rig, or a heavy bottom bouncer. Pay very close attention to your graph, on my HDS5 I can see very clearly if I am fishing a snag infested environment and would never consider a crank. However, some of the flats on gull rock provide a great opportunity for this style of fishing. I would prolly use some 50lb flourocarbon as a leader just incase a northern wants a Rapala."
1228476,fish bookie,2010-08-17 14:20:00,53,Hopefully we will be able to make it in no time this year have you heard of any construction in canada thus far from anyone
1228478,Pezman38,2010-08-17 14:28:00,3196,"Yes, several bridges are being fixed on the Kings highway and the 502. Expect very minimal delays, however, the bridge being fixed out of Ft Frances to the 502 is under construction for 3-4 miles and can cause a 30min or more delay. Heading up I-35 we experienced several single lane roads for a total of around 18 miles on two seperate occasions. We were slowed to around 30 a couple times due to the odd merging in MN, once the semis block a lane things went smoothly and delay was minimal."
1228589,fish bookie,2010-08-17 20:29:00,53,thanks for the road conditions buy the way does anyone use scents up here like essence of shad or any attractants like that if so or maybe a home brew its like i like to use wd 40 when i fish for catfish and it really does work 20 yrs of use and i love it i'm trying to maybe figure out something to take for pike or walleye any help would be great thanks the fish bookie
1228691,Habitual Eyer,2010-08-18 08:46:00,144,"Never put any effort into scents. Did pay attention to washing hands after handling fuel/oil, etc. to ensure we did not put an unwanted scent on our presentation. Gull Rock is usually great all day action once one learns the lake and how to fish it best. The need for any attractants like scents seem unnecessary (i think anyway)."
1229885,bryhardt,2010-08-23 09:35:00,11,"Just returned from the Gull Rock Lake after a 15 year hiatus. Just my wife and I made the trip. My wife had never really been fishing before. Just thought I would share the experience...Friday 8/13 - The adventure of getting there...My wife needed to work on Friday, so I packed up the car and headed out solo early in the morning from St. Louis. Our intentions were to meet at International Falls airport Saturday morning. I was spending the night at International Falls while she was flying up via Delta.As I am driving through Minneapolis at about 3pm, she calls and tells me that Delta emailed her and canceled the flight for Saturday morning. However, Delta booked her a flight arriving at International Falls Saturday Night. Since that wasn't very appealing, I pulled into a rest area and we started working on a better solution. We found a flight leaving St. Louis in a couple of hours that would get her to Minneapolis at 10:30pm on a different airline.Great, so I work on killing the next several hours in Minneapolis while I wait for her flight to arrive. Meanwhile I am thinking, this inconvenience at least will get us to the Gull Rock earlier on Saturday so we could get some fishing in on Saturday. (but what was I thinking)Then about 9pm I get a call from her that she is in Milwaukee and since here flight was late due to weather, she can't get on the connecting flight. The plane is on the ground at the jet-way, but they closed the door and won't let her on. Good grief now what are we going to do, I am in Minneapolis and she is stuck in Milwaukee. Then, an unaccompanied minor showed up at the gate late too. Since the airline had to let him on, they late her on too. Whew!Saturday 8/14 - The adventure continues...We arrived at International Falls at about 3am. We checked into the hotel (already had a nonrefundable room otherwise I wouldn't have stopped) to basically get a nap as I wanted to head out around 6am. We ended up getting out of the hotel around 7am and got across the border in about 15 minutes. Despite the travel problems the previous day, it seemed like we were finally going to make it.Then on the Canada 502, we ran into some stopped traffic. We sat there for over two hours due to a tractor trailer and vehicle collision that had the entire roadway blocked.Finally we arrived at the Gull Rock late Saturday afternoon. We got checked in and unpacked. Of course the weather was now just starting to act up as the temperature was dropping and rain was beginning.We took the boat out anyway for about an hour into the bay but couldn't find any Walleye for dinner that evening.Sunday - Monday 8/15-8/16 - The weather doesn't cooperate...Sunday consisted of more rain and colder temperatures. We took the boat just outside of the bay on Sunday and was able to catch a few small walleye, but didn't stay out very long. On Monday there were 30 mph gusts, with rain and even colder temperatures. We again tried to fish in a few parts of the bay, but were unsuccessful with catching any eyes. It was dinner in the town of Red Lake on Monday night.Tuesday 8/17 - Finally!!!Since it looked like the weather was going to break, we got up just at daybreak to hit the lake early to make up for some lost time. We bee lined to the boot and found us there all by ourselves. We started immediately catching fish and limited out pretty quickly only keeping about 16-18 inch fish. We threw back many under 15 inches. At about 10am more boats started showing up, but it seemed the bite for us was starting to slow down. We decided to go back to camp and eat some lunch. We went back out to boot in the evening and again caught some of the same size fish.Wednesday 8/18 - ShorelunchFor Wednesday, we decided we were going to try and catch some eyes for shore lunch. We got out on the lake a later in the day and went right back out to the boot. We caught some eaters for shore lunch pretty quickly. Since we were going to beach near the Three Sisters, I wanted to stop by there and see if we could catch anything. As we arrived at the Three Sisters, we were the only boat in the area. As soon as I shut off the outboard and started dropping the trolling motor in, my wife had a walleye. We caught a couple more eaters and then a storm cloud started kicking up the wind and waves. I was hungry and tired of fighting the waves keeping the boat over the fish so we headed to the beach for lunch.Shore lunch was great, except the boat got a little flooded by some larger waves that were kicked up by another storm cloud that came through. We had to bail water for about 20 minutes. After shore lunch it was back out to the boot where we caught a couple more eaters for dinner.Thursday - 8/19 More of the same...For Thursday, our goal was to complete our limit on Walleyes to take home. We headed out to the boot in the morning. I took the boat higher up on the toe side than I had previously. We caught the biggest Walleyes of the trip there. There seemed to be plenty of fish in that area, and we found ourselves to be the only boat in that area. There were many boats down from us alongside the bottom of the boot where I was previous days. Since we were drifting, I threw out a marker to indicate where I wanted to start the drift. Of course after the marker hit the water, a couple boats came by and literally circled the marker several times. They didn't catch anything and didn't see us catching fish one after another about 100 yards away from the maker on the drift. We did this several times, pulling up to the marker, drift, and reel em in.At lunch time I wanted a change of scenery so I thought we would go back to the Three Sisters. Again we were the only boat in the area. I trolled around three sisters looking for some fish on the depth finder and the depth I wanted. Once we were on it, I dropped the anchor and started working on lunch. We were pulling out Walleye's pretty regularly but they were all around 15 inch. I had gotten pretty lazy on checking my fire line after snags or catching a bunch of fish and I ended up breaking off one of these little guys off from a frayed line. So instead of retying, I thought I would just take a break and finish my lunch. A couple minutes later, my wife has a fish. I get the net and bring it up over the side of the boat. The fish thrashes in the net and something hard bounces off my chest. I look down and there was my jig I had just broken off. We caught the same fish twice and I had my jig back!!We hung around Three Sisters until I got a little bored catching the little guys, so I thought we would try a couple new spots and work our way back to camp. None of the ""new spots"" really paid off, although I could see plenty fish on the depth finder, we couldn't catch them.We had about an hour and a half left until we needed to be back at camp, so I decided to stop and try out my favorite Pike area. I gave my wife a weedless spoon and told her to try and cast towards the shore line, while I trolled and fished too. Of course most of her casts were well beyond the shore line, which is why she had the weedless spoon. After about 10 minutes she asked me, ""is there really any fish here?"". I replied, ""just keep casting"". Then just as her spoon reached the boat a pike hit and almost pulled the pole out of her hand.After that she couldn't get enough of the pike fishing. We caught a few more pike and it was time to go back to camp. Of course I have the ""one that got away"" story there as I had a trophy Pike get away at the boat. I still don't know how we could have gotten into the boat since the net was way to small (which is a whole other story).Friday 8/20 - Over to soon, time to go home...Friday we packed up and left for home, with our limit of Walleye and a couple of pike. The trip was great, although we had a couple bad weather days, and I wondered at times if we would ever get there. At least we got to finish on a couple solid last days of fishing. My wife will definitely go back, and I am making plans for next year. We primarily fished by jigging with jigs tipped with minnows and drifting with 6lb crystal fireline tied direct with no leader. I had some gulp minnows I tried occasionally when the bite was good and had no problems catching fish with them either. I tried to keep us fishing between 17 and 24 feet deep depending on the structure we were fishing by.On the way home we swung by Chicago and ate some good ole Chicago style pizza. Now its Monday, so I guess I better get back to work."
1229895,Moondog,2010-08-23 10:12:00,362,Where did you stay that was an hour and a half away from the 3 sisters??
1229907,bryhardt,2010-08-23 10:40:00,11,"Oops, we stayed at Golden Hook, obviously not an hour and a half away. We had an hour and a half until we needed to get back. I edited message above, thanks."
1229936,Moondog,2010-08-23 12:24:00,362,"Just curious. I thought to myself.......they either are rowing or staying somewhere in Red Lake!!! <HA> Fished Gull Rock in August twice (2007-8) and generally found fish on mid-lake humps or off islands/points with adjacent deep water......the boot, Round Island. As the month went on we picked up larger fish but think the big Mama's are deep during this period and not very active. Glad you had a great time!!!"
1230129,jkwildhunting,2010-08-23 21:41:00,361,"Same report as above. Water temp prior to gettin there was 75ish. By the time we took the boat out thursday afternoon it was 63-65ish!The weather def had those fish messed up a lil we caught enough for a fry every night that were all 16+ but just didnt get into the numbers like always! But that all the challenges of fishing if it always easy then its not as fun i like working for fish and this week was one of those weeks were you had to.As the week went on we found fish coming back into the normal areas we fished the following, Boot, Burnt Island, Red Marker, Stephson (sp) point, the beach which located next to the boot, fisherman point, round island, 3 sisters and just worked alot of the different islands.With the wind and all we pulled bottom bouncers/ spinners all week with strictly gulp. This is my 4 year i believe that i have yet to use livebait up there and its fun!We pike fished up by 3 sisters were i got my first walleye on a daredevil i have seen pictures of it done but i ws tickled to death when i got it in! Then headed over to 2 islands and fished channel going back into 2 islands caught plenty of pike back there but not many in our ""keeping"" .Even tho the fishing wasnt what we were use to i cant wait to get back up there next year for 2 trips."
1228092,fish bookie,2010-08-16 08:38:00,53,thanks fellas for the info we will be up on sat. fishing hope for good weather but i will try some new things that you suggest were in your mind has the hot spot been this year for you all and are there any good little spots that hold some nice fish we have found a couple sunken islands by clay banks but are there any other spots that we should look for thanks the fish bookie
1228146,Habitual Eyer,2010-08-16 12:11:00,144,"I have not been up this year...will be heading up in a couple weeks so I have no 2010 hot spots. If you target the mainland and Island structure off the deep water (the 50 ft water in the main lake) you should find nice pockets of fish almost everywhere. Find out what seems to be the ""magic"" depth from others fishing that week and focus on that. Gull Rock has an uncanny ability to produce nice numbers on leeward (calm) sides of islands in the area described. Goes against the normal walleye mentality of fishing the windblown structure but Gull Rock seems to be special in this way (not a first choice, but not to be overlooked either). Make sure you are throwing the right meat at them. I have fished Gull Rock these two weeks the last number of years and the guys getting away with crawlers/leeches in mid summer are finding it increasingly more difficult as we creep towards September. Minnows seem to be more critical as the summer progresses into fall (at least this seems to be the case). Hope this helps and good luck."
1228294,fish bookie,2010-08-16 20:45:00,53,Thanks eyeri will look for that occassion if it pops up for us were are you from i think i read that you drive 20 hrs we are about 15-16 hrs. In southeast iowa
1228337,Habitual Eyer,2010-08-17 05:59:00,144,"We are in North Western Indiana Bookie. About 950 Miles from Home to Gull Rock. We are forced to either go through Chicago, or around which can many times lead to a very poor start to a very long drive. 20-22 hrs most of the time. Gull Rock's worth it though."
1227362,Bigfish10702,2010-08-12 23:56:00,60,"I was at Goldenhook the week of June 19. We tried Gulp but had no luck with it. We would be on fish (jig and Minnow) so we knew they were there. Put on gulp 4"" minnow and nothing, go back to live minnow and bang, fish on. I tried jigging and bottom bouncing with spinner rigs with the Gulp, nada, not even a nibble. Put live minnow on, and hit them every time. I was disappointed, fishing Gulp would have saved some $$$$ on bait, but it just wasnt working. Had some luck with live leeches, but that was pretty slow."
1227382,Bill Krejca,2010-08-13 06:55:00,6107,"For me, Gulp works best when used with a jig head that is balanced to stay horizontal when vertically jigged. I like the bullet nosed ""worm"" heads best. I try to work out a ""wiggle pattern"" by watching what the bait does just under the water, and then replicating that action on the bottom. It doesn't take much rod movement to create a fishy action; somewhat dried bait loses some of its action 'til it gets re-saturated, may take some time. Bill Krejca"
1227411,Uncle Paul,2010-08-13 08:14:00,292,"Thanks guys for the tip about the crawlers I almost forgot about the bedding I've got lots of Gulp in the boat just not the New Penny color and they told me don't leave the states without it, would love to hear a report when you get back. Kind of funny most of responses are from guys from Iowa and Illinois and I live in N.Illinois and the guys I'm going with are from Iowa.Paul"
1227486,Habitual Eyer,2010-08-13 12:25:00,144,"See you up there Uncle Paul.....We will be arriving at Wrights the 28th as well. We are staying for two weeks. Fishing the Classic mid-trip. For me it's monnows. Live minnows PLEASE. Cost never really seemed to hurt that much...even after two weeks. Minnow bill creeps up there at 4+ dozen, but at the end of the trip it does not seem to add up like one thinks it would. Bill divided by a few people does not seem so painfull when compared to the overall trip cost. Ensuring we have 50 to 100 fish days (and live minnows always helped us acomplish that) is much bigger to us than saving a few bucks per man on bait."

Why would one comliment the owners by refering to them as ""Super People"" with ""one of the cleanest camps on the lake"", and then immediatly tear them down with a VERY personal attack. Very puzzling indeed. Many camps i will not go back to as the owners could care less about giving the guests the time of day. ""Super people"", and ""the cleanest camp on the lake"" don't seem to work real well in the same breath as ""Lushes"" and i am glad that the owners of Wrights are inteligent enough not to allow some idiotic unregistered post to change anything they do or how they do it !!!!!!!!!!!!

1226324,Pezman38,2010-08-09 15:10:00,3196,"Just returned from my trip to Gull Rock lake in Ontario. Stayed at Wrights Wilderness Camp and Lee and Stephanie treated us Excellent all week. Water temp was 74.5 degrees F the entire trip. We had mostly sunny skies every day with different winds and it rained in the evenings. Unbelievable week of walleye fishing, Jig and minnow in 16-22 foot of water was the ticket. We targeted wind blown shelfs, with wind blowing into them and hammered the walleye on Gull Rock and Keg Lake Monday - Wednesday. Hot colors were blue and white northland jigs in 3/8, 3/8 knuckleballs in chart/white, and XPS walleye angler jigs in chart/black. Thursday the wind picked up on Gull Rock. We only saw three boats all day due to conditions, but my Ranger handeled them well and we slayed the walleyes with wind roaring at 25-30mph gusts. To stay down we used minnow harnesses, blade color didn't seem to matter as we would have triples every pass. Used 3/4 ounce bead weights to keep on the bottom and drifted at around 1mph using the Terrova to stay in 18-22ft. Excellent trip, used 80 doz minnows between two boats and 6 guys. Many minnows were used for 2-4 fish, and the last two days we caught fish very well on Gulp Alive minnows. Didn't try worms or leeches but leeches seemed to work better in the past."
1226430,jkwildhunting,2010-08-09 21:58:00,361,Thanks for the Report..Headed up this friday for a week. Cant wait to get into them! What was your biggest eye over the trip? Last few years we have picked some of the trips biggest eyes out of shallow water say 10-14 fow. May try that tactic again as most reports i seen people are stayin out deeper would like to find the big girls!
1226482,REG,2010-08-10 06:49:00,445,Thanks for the update - I didn't know you were a Gull Rock guy. I'm getting a rare chance for a second trip up to Pakwash later next week. I stay at Snake Falls where Lee used to work before he got the resort on Gull Rock. Very nice guy. We always go the first week of June so we fish pretty shallow. Looks like I'll need to get some heavier jigs.
1226826,Pezman38,2010-08-11 08:11:00,3196,"Biggest walleye for the group was 24.5, taken by two guys, my best was a 22. We caught a lot of fish over 18 in 18-22 foot. Biggest northern was caught on a minnow harness and was 35 I think. We lost a bigger fish right next to the boat, bite through the line. I did hear from a couple guys at camp that they weren't catching numbers but each fish were 22-25 inches all in about 10-15 foot of water. It was their first year to the camp so I bet they had an excellent time. Yeah this was my seventh year in a row going to Wrights Camp, always have a great time. Sorry for the delayed response, I got home and work sent me to Mexico City :-)."

This is our 3rd year fishing gull rock we stay at 5 lakes my first ever trip to canada was on a fly in then we went to pakwash since my dad always went there as a kid he said the fishing is better at gull rock but then we had 2 women with us on that trip so all of our fishing was find a school of fish, anchor and jig not alot of fun and catching was rather slow.Cant wait to pull spinners with leeches n crawlers for a week!"
1226930,Pezman38,2010-08-11 14:22:00,3196,"I fish with a bunch of hard headed older guys, not saying anything bad, but they like to catch fish a certain way and that is it, jig or spinner. I think a 3 way rig/bouncer with a nice tail dancer/minnow rap/flicker shad/shad rap/ reef runner/ could be excellent on the bigger fish. I caught my biggest fish last year on a 10"" suick casting for northern so experimenting is worth it sometimes."
1227014,jkwildhunting,2010-08-11 19:02:00,361,Yup i have a few ideas.Tied up some spinners with double floats and double spinners thought it was something different if it works who knows guess there only one way to find out is to try.I then also picked up a bunch shallow running cranks and goin to use them in a 3 way setup!Also going to try trolling crankbaits around some windblow islandsYea its kind of amazing our first trip up there we met some guys like that they said all you need is a jig and minnow. After the first day we switched to spinners/crawlers and we were outfishing them.Do you or have you ever used gulp on gull rock?Is it friday yet?
1227138,Pezman38,2010-08-12 08:06:00,3196,"Well I would have to agree with them, all you really need is a jig and a minnow to catch fish. If you want to catch more fish though you need to be able to change a bit with a leeche, crawler, spinners etc. We like to troll spinners to find the active fish, then throw a marker when we hit a double/triple, and hit the fish in the face with jigs. Cranks have worked well for us in the past, we mostly flatlined them, but 3 way/bounder to avoid losing cranks is a much better method. Yeah I mentioned in my original post that gulp minnows were working well this year. They last more than 10 fish most the time too which is a bonus. I think they are more effective trolling them than jigging, fish have less of a chance to see what is going by."

Any problem with gas or find any good places to eat and is finding live bait a problem? Paul"
1227246,jkwildhunting,2010-08-12 13:56:00,361,"I use almost all Gulp in Canada i havent used live bait in over 4 years up there. I have it all from leeches, minnows, to crawlers its deadly when on a spinner.We have been up to canada in the summer when we wished we would of brought shorts and fans LOL.We also were up there last summer and wished we would of brought snow gear. 40degree rain, strong winds ARE COLD. We actually caught some sleet/snow but we were also 70 miles north of Red Lake on that tripWe mainly use spinners fishing for walleyes tipped with gulp, jig and minnow or crawler work fine but buying bait gets expensive. Talk to your group see if they are bringing live night crawlers if not get some put in Canada bedding will save you alot of money if you use them up there instead of buying them from camp. Wrights should have minnows and possibly crawlers/leeches they will sell you but i am guessin they will be around 5 bucks a dozen.Any other question fire away ill try to answer them and give you a report when i get back on the 21"
