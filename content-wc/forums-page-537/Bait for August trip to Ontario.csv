I assume crawlers in bedding, leeches are a NO-NO in any form, and salted minnows...? Is the timing right to fish minnows? Any recipes for salting our own minnows and freezing in packages to take along with us assuming it's ok/legal to bring our own minnows arcoss the border? Thanks for any advise!"

I told a cousin of mine that as he always went in mid-August and spoke of how slow the fishing was at times . He gets minnows now just to be safe . Experiences fisherman can usually catch fish without them but looks like the gosl here is for to kids to catch fish and have fun ...
