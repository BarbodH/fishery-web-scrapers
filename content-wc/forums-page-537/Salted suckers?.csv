1202652,lassh,2010-05-21 13:50:00,553,"I am thinking about bringing a few large frozen suckers on a fly in for quick strike rigs for pike. I was thinking about getting them locally, salting them, then freezing but don't know if they are too big for salting to be effective. I plan to use 10"" to 12"" suckers. Will salting help preserve them? Should I gut them or leave innards in? Any one have any experience with salted suckers or frozen ones for that matter. Also does anyone know of a convenient source for large frozen suckers by mail order or available in Kenora? Thanks in advance. LASSH"

They still remain very soft and hard to rig.Another option you may wish to look into is contact a commercial bait or fish dealer and arrange for Cisco / Tullibee. A favorite chow of big pike and should be more readily available in that region. As a dead bait presentation for big pike, they do very well in my experience."
