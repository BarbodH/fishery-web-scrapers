1203797,stevie,2010-05-25 10:32:00,21,"we will be posting reports for the eagle lake and vermilion bay area through the course of the season for those traveling or contemplating a trip to our area using info not only from our establishment but also other contacts from collegues,resorts,guides,and fishermen in the area. sun early am,all day/nite mon. rained with a lightning shows quitting just before daybreak,cloudy am mod winds breaking into sun and wind sw/w 20+ miday on. water temps were surface 60's ranging from low to high depending on main lake or bays,north or south sections,etc but avg mid 60's. on eagle water levels are just a bit low but in very good shape and maintaining well with timely periodic rain falls. walleyes are biting very good and aggressive when you get into them though scattered about in groups and on the move using many diff structures as they are in a seemingly mid june type of transition mode with the early spring,warm water temps. weed growth developing early. walleyes are using both emerging weed/grass/flats areas 6-12' and rocky points,rock/weed combos 8-18', and also showing up on some bars 17-24' that would be more typical late june early july patterns. first guests/guide dates went out sun,catches were good,both boats avgd 60-70 fish,the group fishing shallower primarily weeds/flats caught more eater fish 15-18"" with 1/3 slot and over fish and the group that concentrated more on rocky points,bars,and deeper 12-24' structures boated more bigger slot and over fish with 1/3 eater sized fish. 1/16-1/8 jigs and minnows ,blues,black,purples when it was cloudy chart. and plain shiny lead when the sun came out was primary presentation used though i was out same day marking rocks and tried a couple areas and caught fish trolling shad raps/flicker shads over flats and jigs/gulp on several humps. i'm sure fish would respond to jigs or spinner rigs with crawlers or leeches already as fish cleaned had alot of bugs in them besides minnows. mayflys should hatch soon and much earlier than normal this season as it is all water temp regulated so when you see the first head for the mud flats. basically if you got jigs,live bait and plastics,plain hook and shot or bullet weights,spinner rigs,some 6-12' cranks you will have what it takes to fish all patterns and activity levels,keep it simple,periodically check out diff patterns/depths,don't spend alot of time on spot if it isn't producing rather check several times daily as fish are really moving around alot following bait fish,what was dead am could be a mother lot a hr later and vice versa,play the windy structure when possible and you should be able to consistantly put walleyes in the boat daily. bass were not heavily on the beds in extreme west yet,several 3.5-5# caught deeper full of spawn fishing walleyes but will be very soon,getting it on in VB and south. UPDATE; AS OF YESTERDAY BIG BASS SHALLOW,MOVED IN QUICKLY,40+ CAUGHT YESTERDAY AFTERNOON,TUBES,X-RAPS flukes,tubes,jig/gulp,spinnerbaits and when you can see following but not biting go to a plain circle hook/shot and a minnow or leech will get it done. lots of small pike yet though some to caught to 36"" also with the walleyes. trout are moving into the staging holes already in portage bay and western arm,try 40-60' depths both on bottom and suspended depending on light and wind levels.the MNR is currently doing a tracking study on lake trout movements so if you catch a trout with a transmitter please release and report to your resort or MNR. lots of big muskys moving around in the shallows finishing up spawning.remember if you hook one to water release and do not intentially target till june 19,as they will be chasing hooked walleyes,bass,pike and taking smaller baits intended for other species as they recoup and start feeding again. of interesting note; fall of 2009 the MNR did a index netting study,last one was in 2000. the results proved what we have been saying the past 4-6 yrs years. eagle lakes walleye fishery is/has exploded with not only the big avg sized slot fish and over but huge numbers of recuitment fish 10-18"" of many diff year classes with the northern/western sections showing the biggest increases in pop.,putting eagle lakes pop. in the top 25% of nw ontario lakes,the number of eggs in mature females was a higher avg than nw ontario lakes showing the future of eagles fishery is a bright and strong one with the good ole days of walleye fishing on eagle not 15-20 yrs ago but now and coming. simply eagle lake is not the same walleye fishery now it was 15-20 yrs ago. the intelligent slot limits,possesion limits imposed by the MNR and voluntary release of by most of slot and over fish with most resorts requesting it of thier guests along with the incredible fertility and genetics is/has been doing it's job,not only here but many area lakes. good luck what ever section of the lake or lake you're fishing and let us know what you found,it's a 2 way street for everyone. steve herbeck AML"
