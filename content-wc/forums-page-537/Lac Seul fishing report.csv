1202060,Guest,2010-05-19 17:01:00,0,"Those are the same areas we fish - I assume by Turkey Creek, you are referring to the north McKenzie Bay areas - the shallows, little sand the Island - I wonder with this being post-spawn, if it makes any sense to go up into Broad Lake or Sunlight Lake - we are also there the week of May 29 to June 4; please email me if you get any good reports."
1202377,dawgpound820,2010-05-20 15:04:00,6,"Those are exactly the same places we fish. We don't plan on going into broad or sunlight this year but I bet it is still very good. We might check out south inlet this year. I also want to fish deer island, we have had good luck in past years. We really want to concentrate a little more on smallies as I'm sure you know are fun a **** to catch. We are staying at Lac Seul Lodge, where are you staying? I cannot wait to get up there this year it should be alot of fun as usual and thus far it looks like the weather is gonna be awesome. Last year we went same week and froze our asses off this year will be much better."
1203250,Guest,2010-05-23 19:21:00,0,We are staying at Scout Bay camp - I fish a 18 foot Alumacraft with a Evinrude tiller. Look for us in Mckinzie for sure - probably start with the Island (that's on the other side of Turkey creek - you are fishing the area we call the Outpost since that is Schreiners Remote cottage). The Island is the last piece of land in the shallow bay just west of the outpost area. It is always hot post spawn. We will spend time in South Bay too. I have not seen any reliable reports yet - you?
1203404,Guest,2010-05-24 08:17:00,0,Is Turkey Creek accessible from the Ear Falls end of the lake? We go as far as McKenzie bay but not sure what Island you are talking about that is hot for the post spawn time.
1203451,dawgpound820,2010-05-24 10:22:00,6,"I'm pretty sure you're talking about that entryway by the outpost cabin. Last year there were alot of stumps sticking out and if you wrap around it leads back to a small waterfall. If this is the area you're talking about we smacked em pretty good last year. We are in a Tracker Tundra (gold) with a Mercury 150 and a 10 horse kicker my name is Paul. Not sure when we will be up there probably Sunday or Monday, we tend to just fish rat bay and otter the first day as we don't check in until 2:00. I hope everyone has a good trip."
1203458,dawgpound820,2010-05-24 10:31:00,6,Also I have yet to see anything as far as fishing reports. It would be nice to see what some of these guys are catching this year and where. It is early in the season though. If you hear anything let me know. As far as access to Turkey from Ear Falls I think you would have to head through McKenzie and then shoot North to get there but not 100% sure. It seems to me I don't remember seeing access on the map.
1203930,Guest,2010-05-25 16:30:00,0,"Dawg, if you are in Rat Bay we may see you there on Saturday, that's the tradition. We fish an area in Rat Bay known as the junk yard - its a favorite area for Bullwinkles and all sorts of wild life - it also very close to the highway, you can hear the cars. It can get hot in there - one year we caught trophy after trophy walleye and two 40"" northerns to boot - all in one afternoon at the Junkyard. So every year, we go back on Saturday and fish it. I like to think it sets the tone for the trip since really you only get a couple good hours of fishing in an Saturday as they don't want us in camp until noon - but we need to catch fish to have a good trip so we fish it pretty hard. By the time you get boats in the water, etc. it's 2:00. Dinner is at 7:00... So Rat Bay is typically the call. I have not gone back past the stick ups near the outpost - I will this year as I think the Falls will be hot. Also the Falls in South Bay. Name is John, the boat is PT13 - you will know the boat from the blood in the water all around. Good fishing to you - have fun!"

1204129,dawgpound820,2010-05-26 09:47:00,6,I will probably be there Saturday also as we cannot ckeck in until 2:00 which means I'll be fishing by 2:05 lol. If I am correct the falls you are talking about are in Otter just outside of Rat Bay. We fish the heck out of that place. I have caught many large walleye and pike about 10-15 feet off the falls back there. It is always good. I will probably see ya. If not have a great trip. Nothing like being secluded for a week.
