1202888,wolverine fan,2010-05-22 13:36:00,71,"I just purchased a new travel rod from cabelas. This was due to last years debacle in which i paid an extra $80 to bring my oversized rod case, first time charged in ten years. Anyway to avoid that again i bought the 4 piece rod. Always have used a one piece baitcasting rod and wondered if there is any danger of throwing away a piece of my rod while casting? Is there any product you put on the ends to make them stay on better? and is there a product you put on the last day to loosen it back up? Any help appreciated."
1202901,BrianinVA,2010-05-22 14:39:00,160,"Did you purchase the Fish Eagle II spinning rod by chance? If so, the pieces stay together very well so you shouldn't have any issues. Getting them apart takes a bit of effort but with a little persistence and wiggle they'll budge.I bought this rod last year for the same reason you stated and it travels and fishes very well. The action is a little on the heavy side but I suppose it has to be since it's four pieces. Just be careful when securing your reel not over tighten as the cork on mine split a tiny bit."

Just rub the Male section of the ferrules over your nose..... works like a champ! I know If your Rods break down into two sections (less than 5 ft each) you will have no problems with the air carriers. If you have ""one piece"" 7 ft rods.... you will pay extra."

1202972,wolverine fan,2010-05-22 19:30:00,71,"Yea, thats the rod i purchased. Thanks for the input. The outfitters name was delta aka northwest airlines!!! the rod case was for a 6'6"" one piece rod that exceeded the new regs i guess. This year i have to pay $25 for the FIRST checked bag and whatever after, you better believe im making this trip on one bag and a carry on so be careful if youre fishing anywhere near me cause i can only afford to pack 2 pairs of underdraws!!!!!"
1203035,go dart,2010-05-23 06:20:00,77,Rod cases are usually classified as a special item. Delta charges as just another piece of luggage. I had to remind the counter person. Quality travel rods perform as well if not better than 1 piece. I found an excellent Browning 3 pc at Cabelas. They charge seperatly for the case but its perfect. Then shove the rod in the suitcase and now ya got more bait money.
1203059,Esoxchaser,2010-05-23 07:44:00,1576,"Make sure you mount a reel and fish with the rod a bit before taking it on a trip. I had two Fish Eagle baitcast travel rods, the reel seats were so cheap the locking ring would expand and slide right over the threads every time I put any pressure on the line. I ended up sending them back and getting St Croix Tidemaster travel rods. I like the Tidemasters so much one has taken up full time residence in the rod locker."
1203132,craigh,2010-05-23 12:33:00,6,"My fish eagle is adequate for a lighter weight pack rod.Look into Albright rods under their conventional line of rods (they mainly have fly gear) for medium weight rods. I like their surf casting rods for normal use. (Tarpon, Salmon, etc) Their fly gear is also stellar bang for the buck.For heavy gear, look at Okuma's Nomad line of rods. These are very impressive being that they are a 3 pc rod (with 2 different tip sections also!)I pack my Albright rods in my hardside suitcase. I pack ALL my reels in my carry-on (no hooks or terminal tackle attached). I brought 2 Okuma Nomad's and 2 fly rods carry-on as my personal item. That is how I outfit for a fishing trip now if I fly. Some of my 2-piece rods are somewhat mothballed since they won't be flying anymore. The pvc rod case that has been to Alaska 3 times will no longer fly without being classed ""oversize"" even though it weighed a whopping 19 lbs. last time the pricks charged me for it.If your destination is in US/Canada, look into shipping your stuff. I shipped all my lead, trolling gear, and heavy stuff in that Large Flat Rate box. I was able to make it weigh almost 30 lbs. $15 for that from MN to Florida - priceless. I personally wouldn't advise shipping anywhere in Central America/South America/Mexico."
