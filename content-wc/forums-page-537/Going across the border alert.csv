1204082,jigman2003,2010-05-26 06:59:00,15,"Good advice. I'd go even further and say ""don't start a conversation of any kind about any topic"". Pull up, have your hats off, sunglasses off, ID's ready, answer any questions asked truthfully, drive away.No ""beautiful day isn't it"" kind of crap."
1204086,Bill Krejca,2010-05-26 07:04:00,6107,"Interesting, I guess I haven't kept up on that problem. Would cooked meat be a risk? I honestly have never had the border folks ask about it. Bill Krejca"
1204089,camp chef,2010-05-26 07:16:00,915,Neither cooked venison nor raw venison will spread the disease. I have never been asked about wildgame either.
1202965,Mandownriver,2010-05-22 18:57:00,7,"Just returned from a fly-in for walleye in Canada, going into Canada no potato of any kind, Be sure you tell them of any wild game meat even if its just venison. They removed everything from a group of four traveling in another truck. They were real jerks and liked calling people liers and removing things and tossing them in the dumpster. Coming back be sure you package your fish as the regulations say. one fish per bag and label the fish. If you fishing for pike take some long thin bags. Plus they come on camp one day and four walleye in your possession even means fish in your frig that was cook the night before. One cabin got fines 325 per fish. Besides that we caught lot of fish and the weather was great. Just read and follow the regulations"
1203000,Pawchaser,2010-05-22 21:48:00,31,"Everything we are hearing is that ban was lifted. Do you think it is possible that they didn't have US grade #1 potatoes or that potatoes were not labeled?http://allcanadashow.blogspot.com/ Potatoes Cleared for Crossing Border Joel Prunty, media manager - When you drive across the Canadian border this summer on your fishing adventure you will not see a dumpster full of potatoes. It was always unclear as to the risk potatoes posed, but we have been notified by NOTO (Northern Ontario Tourist Outfitters' Association) that this summer American guests will NOT have to leave their potatoes at the border, nor register them when they come to fish in Canada. Here are the conditions by which potatoes may cross the Canadian border: * Guests are limited to 10 lbs or less per person * Potatoes must be commercially packaged (in the original package from the store) and the potatoes should be US grade No. 1. We have confirmed this through discussions with the Fort Frances border crossing (Canadian Border Services Agency CBSA) as well as the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). Enjoy that shorelunch with the potatoes of your choice!"
1203072,Moondog,2010-05-23 08:25:00,362,Our camp owner emailed all of us and said that the potato ban had been lifted and that we could bring 5# potatoes each in the sacks they came in. Came thru at Emerson on Tuesday and there were no food bans. Musta been something you said!!!
1203092,Mandownriver,2010-05-23 09:44:00,7,"Very interesting , Just got work from the group that got into camp Friday after we flew out that there potatoes were taken also. If it has changed they haven't communicated it to the border petrol guards yet. What can I say"
1203129,JayM5209,2010-05-23 12:27:00,1050,"From the Ontario MNR regs on catch and retain limits:""The catch limit is the number of fish you are allowed to catch and keep in one day, and includes fish that are retained for any period of time and any fish eaten or given away. The possession limit is the number you are allowed to have in your possession on hand, in cold storage, in transit or anywhere. Possession limits are the same as one day's catch limit except where otherwise specified.""Best to check the regs for the management zone in which you will be fishing. Although limits may vary from zone to zone, or in particular locations within a zone, as stated above the possession limit is uniformly the same as the daily catch limit, regardless of where stored or how handled since catching.Over the years we've seen several parties get hefty fines for bringing a limit back to camp when they already had fish in the freezer or fridge.Anyone wanting to review the recent long thread on potatoes can find it here - https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...light=potatoes"
1203134,515,2010-05-23 12:41:00,254,"Seems pretty simple to me. Your all on the internet so research things a bit before you go and you won't have any problems if you follow the rules. Here is a link to the potato problem. http://www.canadawelcomesyou.net/prohibited.html Here is a link to the Ministry of Natural Resources fishing page.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_163615.html I always find it funny when people call out others for doing there jobs, especially when there doing what there supposed to do and there in the wrong. Just because your camp owner says it's ok doesn't mean they know what there talking about."
1203695,Stu,2010-05-24 23:11:00,472,Is wild game prohibited now? We always take elk sausage and no one has ever asked about it.
1203794,Bill Krejca,2010-05-25 10:09:00,6107,"Stu, The rule generally is ""Don't bring up a subject at the border stop that you don't want to have a discussion on."" I've never had them ask about COOKED (or uncooked) wild game meat, not sure why they would, nor would I think that there would be anything in it damaging to the ecosystem by bringing it in. I also would guess that some kind of lab analysis would have to be done to determine the kind of animal that was processed. Bill Krejca"
1203836,Stu,2010-05-25 12:08:00,472,"Good point Bill, I'll keep my mouth shut."
1203868,Blackmacs,2010-05-25 13:42:00,2121,Actually they are worried about CWD.
