1204054,81Saluki,2010-05-26 05:25:00,97,It's still here but nobody has posted anything new ... so it's been bumped to the next page.
1204071,Glenman12,2010-05-26 06:18:00,762,I just bumped it back to the first page..
1204084,Blackmacs,2010-05-26 07:03:00,2121,The report I heard was that they do have a toll booth and some people are stopping and others aren't. The OPP is sitting close by but aren't doing anything unless there is a problem like a crash of some sorts.
