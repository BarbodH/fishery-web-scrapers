The fish are deep and some guys are fishing over 20 feet deep. Trolling is doing good but jigging with a minnow is the best. Light colored jigs are in with the fish this week. My first guiding trip of the season. We had an ok day. It was a hunt but we found them. They are not in their typical spring holding areas. Nothing huge and all of the fish were 21 inches and under. They were happy. I wish I could tell you that we caught lots of fish over 25 inches but it didn't happen. As for everyone in camp lots of nice fish have been caught but we haven't broke the 30 inch range. Maybe next week. The bugs aren't bad and the sun has even gotten to the black flies. Mosquitoes due to the dry spring we had their are very few of them so far. Dragonflies are starting to hatch so what few black flies are around won't be here long. The small brown mayflies (the early ones) are actually hatching in May. If the water temp. Continues to rise the big ones will be here soon. The whitefish are feeding on the surface because the brown mayflies and the large black carpenter ants queens and drones are flying everywhere.The water temp. is in the mid 60's. Next weeks forecast is saying 90's and hot, no rain as of now. If this continues the smallmouth will be in the shallows soon.THERE IS A FIRE BAN IN THE CHAPLEAU WAWA AREA. That hurts the wood sales. Another report is in order for next week. June 4th is the last day of school."
