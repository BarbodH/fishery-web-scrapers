1203371,stinkycat,2010-05-24 06:17:00,2018,Had two boats out on opening day and boated maybe 25 eyes. Pretty slow.
1203407,kgeary,2010-05-24 08:23:00,88,"weather has been great fishing has been outstanding for numbers and size. walleye in 2-15 feet had guys catching 25-28 inch walleye in 2 foot of water, mid day. everything is way ahead of schedule. some mid lakes humps already holding fish. the yellow butterflies are out, the dragon flies, the jack pine pollen is thick on the water the shiners are already spawning. fish are well away from spawning areas and very aggressive. many walleye are still thin I'm thinking they are having a hard time for themselves figuring out the where to look for food?? think mid june and you will do very well this week."
1203428,Peffley'sCamp,2010-05-24 09:24:00,37,"Fished last night for two hours and caught 22 walleyes and a handful of pike. Surface water temps for us on Wabaskang was 61 degrees. Backtrolled from 4-10 fow with 1/8 oz jigs and minnows. Released 2-20's, 4-19's, 1-18 1/2 and an 18"" in the mix.Otherwise I would say opening week numbers were very good. I have seen better openers, but I have seen fishing a lot slower in colder water too. Walleye are definitely aggressive right now."
1203442,Golden Eagle,2010-05-24 10:08:00,2642,"Pike are poaching walleyes. I'm sure that some of them are going over the 4 fish limit.For sure, both pike and walleyes are very, very agressive. Saw a pike take on two limits of walleyes on a stringer. Pike took my walleye and wouldn't turn loose even when in the net. Released the pike and she hit the walleye (mouth closed) several times, trying to get the walleye to play.Another pike took a walleye I was bringing in and had the walleye crosswise in her mouth when netted. Swallowed the walleye before I could get to her. Walleye was so far down that I couldn't pull it out by the tail with pliers. Both pike were good size fish.Sitting out any opener is a mistake. Fishing is always good no matter what kind of weather we experience. I'm still pinching myself over last weeks's weather. Wondering if it was a dream."
