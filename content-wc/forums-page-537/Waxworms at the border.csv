1203472,Fishoil,2010-05-24 10:59:00,1277,Does anyone know if it's legal to take waxworms into Ontario (International Falls crossing)? I can't seem to find any information in the regulations online about them.
1203636,El_Bombero,2010-05-24 19:47:00,18,No waxworms (insect larvae) allowed. Your best bet is to find a petshop or baitshop over the border on the way. I am heading up there in 3 days via Buffalo into Toronto and stopping at the BPS north of Toronto to purchase ours (we called and can get crawlers and waxies there).Good luck.
