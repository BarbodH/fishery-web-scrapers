1203921,camp chef,2010-05-25 16:02:00,915,I have a real good feeling about this year.The water was just like this in 07.Hardly any current and it allowed us to fish some place we couldn't with fast moving water.
1203924,Bluff,2010-05-25 16:07:00,152,"I agree with you... the last couple of years have been a little ""off"". This warm up, I think, along with hopefully a good water level will bring things back the way they should be. Of course, I'm always optimistic."
