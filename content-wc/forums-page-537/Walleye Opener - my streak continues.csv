1202584,Golden Eagle,2010-05-21 10:01:00,2642,"I arrived at Sportsman's Lodge on Little Vermilion Lake last Friday for another walleye opener. Little Vermilion is a short flight from Red Lake and I've fished the first or second week of walleye season on Little Vermilion for 27 consecutive years. Every day of it has been a blessing.5richards sent me a pike lure that's really a doozy. I gave it a workout the first couple of days and it delivered. It has action like nothing I've ever used. His friend makes them for him and I'll let 5richards tell you about the lure.My doc told me I need surgery on my casting shoulder before I left Tennessee to come up here and I'm convinced he's right. We have an uneven number in our cabin, so I'm fishing alone. Hurt the shoulder pretty bad pushing my boat off the sticks first thing Saturday morning. Can't cast so I've been jigging most of the week. Jigging has been good to me by producing several nice pike every day. Yesterday caught six in the mouth of Nungesser River, all coming on jigs in a little over an hour. One was 36"", but rest were upper 30""s and lower 40""s. Would be getting into bigger pike if I could throw 5richard's lure along with Suicks and JSM.Walleyes are everywhere. No bugs. Hot and sunny every day. Lots of people stayed home this week because of nasty weather the past two years. I won, they lost. It's not good to miss an opener."

1202600,camp chef,2010-05-21 11:31:00,915,Happy to hear your fishing was good Connie.
1202609,Whopper,2010-05-21 11:53:00,340,"Don't ya have another arm? You would have thought one of your buddies would have helped you out. I feel sorry for you, sounds rough"
1202614,reeltime84,2010-05-21 12:02:00,207,I guess you showed them though. Sounds like you caught some nice fish. Did they fair as well?
1202638,Gary from Iowa,2010-05-21 13:08:00,74,"I've looked at Sportsmen Lodge web page and it sounds like a nice lake. If I recall, the lodge provides 15 hp electric start engines. How much weight in gear and food can you take with you? Is there a minimum number of guests? Maybe someday my brother(s) can fly in, maybe in August or September. Have you fished Sportsmen in those months?Take it easy on the shoulder. Maybe you can troll as well as jig. in any event you can claim you were on the ""disabled list"" and your fish size and totals should be adjusted upwards when comparing same with your buddies.Gary"
1202668,Whopper,2010-05-21 14:55:00,340,"Gary from Iowa Sportsmans is a nice place, call Brett to get the particulars, he'll probably take what he can get if he has openings, he's a good guy and will work with you. His boats are nice 16 footers w/Honda four strokes. Little Vermilion is loaded with small to medium walleyes and has a good population of big pike, he does have a no kill policy for pike over 28"" , no need to keep any pike because of the tasty walleye that are in abundance."
1202678,Bill Krejca,2010-05-21 15:38:00,6107,"Sounds like a great trip, in spite of the pain. I remember one 1964 October LOW camping trip where I developed a continuous tooth ache the second day there. No way was I going to give up the fishing, went to bed (the ground) each night with an aspirin tucked into the tooth. Of such are memories made. Bill Krejca"
1202697,515,2010-05-21 17:26:00,254,"Glad to hear yoru catching some fish Connie. Your probably better off on your own in the boat, I'm sure if Phil was here he just be slowing you down."
1202731,Whopper,2010-05-21 20:30:00,340,Your probably right. I can only hope to be as good as shape when my time comes The bad part of him having a bum wing is we probably we'll be out some very nice pictures
