1198097,IowaDave,2010-05-08 11:41:00,69,Last year was my 3rd year going to Dryden on 502 and it's gotten better & better every year. Last year there were just a few spots that were in really poor shape & 'rumor had it' that they were going to try & fix those spots later last year. I'll know more in a little over a month!!
1198123,Glenman12,2010-05-08 12:49:00,762,"Actually the first year we went that route we did turn off at Ojibway Dr mistakenly, thinking it was 594.."
1198301,Blue Lk,2010-05-09 06:25:00,269,"I travelled 502 last week,it is in pretty good shape,the worst parts were fixed up in the last 2 yrs.I trucked my GF's horses to Fort Frances & never would have done that 2 yrs ago when the road was bad."
1198531,lunker99,2010-05-09 19:58:00,236,"Is the Ojibway Dr. route paved or gravel? We normally turn left at the T at the end of 502 and come out at Oxdrift, but that route seems to be getting pretty rough the last few years."
1198593,Glenman12,2010-05-10 05:52:00,762,As I recall there are portions that are paved and portions that are gravel..was 3 years ago so Im not positive about it.
1198695,2746,2010-05-10 09:32:00,3206,Don't know when the last time was you used 502 but with the work they have done on it recently it's much better than 2-3 years ago. Still some rough areas but much better overall.
1198769,2746,2010-05-10 12:44:00,3206,"Sorry Glenman, I mis read your post. thought you were referring to 502 sout of there. I'll read more carefully next time."
1204069,Glenman12,2010-05-26 06:17:00,762,any updates on the toll booth?..is it still there..how long is it taking to get thru it..anyone?
1204110,Outfitter17,2010-05-26 08:13:00,127,"Went throught yesterday at about 6:30pm, no traffic either way."
1204112,81Saluki,2010-05-26 08:24:00,97,"Per an article on the Fort Frances Times web site (http://www.fftimes.com/node/233738) ... The average delay Friday, when the toll booth first went up, was about 25 minutes for eastbound traffic at peak hours, said the OPP, while there was no delay for westbound traffic."
1196459,Pawchaser,2010-05-04 02:21:00,31,Fort Frances Times OnLine had an interesting article on 4/28/10 that some of you may find interesting reading. Since I don't know what I can or can't legally copy of the article I will just give the link below and say that the Couchiching First Nation announced its intention to set up a toll booth near the west end of the Noden Causeway as of May 21. Hopefully this will get resolved before it actually happens..... http://fftimes.com/node/233087
1196468,81Saluki,2010-05-04 04:53:00,97,"That would be a bummer! Depending on our mood and time of day, we take either the west route (through Sioux Narrows) or east route (through Dryden) to/from Vermilion Bay. If this happens, we'll probably take the west path from now on. Despite being 30 miles longer, the roads are better and we've encountered fewer critters (moose/deer/bear) in the middle of the road. And no extra tolls."
1196502,Outfitter17,2010-05-04 07:10:00,127,"From what I hear up here, it should be resolved before we get to the May 21 deadline."
1196832,geo1111,2010-05-05 06:14:00,8,"That brings up a question I've had for years.... Which way is fastest to Vermilion Bay? We always seem to take the east route but I don't think we've ever timed it to be certain. Thanks, George"
1196862,JDP,2010-05-05 07:17:00,1457,"Years ago I compared the two routes.I can't remember the exact time and distance figures.But I found that HWY 502 was shorter.(I think by 20-30 miles and about 30 minutes.)At the time of my comparison 502 was in fairly poor shapeand I was open to travelling a little farther, and a little longer to save wear and tear on my tow vehicle, trailer and boat.Hopefully someone else will chime in with the facts on distance for you."
1196873,Guest,2010-05-05 07:34:00,0,what next if they want a toll booth maybe they can buy there own health care and education and any other free stuff they get. Man I'm tired of my tax money going to them And no I'm Not Racisist Time to make your own way in the world Put on your big boy pants Or this crap will never end.
1196938,Glenman12,2010-05-05 10:25:00,762,"We started taking 502 about 3 years ago and checked to see what we saved in mileage and time and as I recall your numbers are pretty close to what we found..we dont go all the way up to Dryden...we cut off on 594 going back west along the north shore of Eagle Lake..when we finally come out on 17 I believe we are only 10-15 miles east of Vermillion Bay, if that.."
1197541,Steve of Madison,2010-05-06 21:15:00,230,"There actually is a short cut to 17 from the T on the north end of 502.At the T turn left go approx 1-2 miles to Adams Rd. Turn right on Adams and you come out on 17 at Oxdrift. Adams is maybe 5 mi of gravel but cuts a good 10-15min off the trip to Vermillion Bay, rather than going into Dryden or following 594 all the way to 17."
1197564,Blue Lk,2010-05-07 05:06:00,269,"You can also turn off 502 at Ojibway Dr a few miles before the 594 junction.You can follow Ojibway Dr & it connects to 594,then follow 594 thru Eagle River to 17 at Eagle Junction."
1197582,geo1111,2010-05-07 06:16:00,8,This is the route we've finally settled on after 10 years of going up to Red Lake from the Twin Cities. Good to know others have found the same experience. It's going to be a very different spring trip this year with the ice being gone so early. Not going to know what to do when we aren't fishing in ice flows! George
