I've tried doing as much research as possible but can't find much on these body of waters. If anyone can tell me more about the lakes and tackle to bring that would be great."
1203247,hoosiercanadian,2010-05-23 19:14:00,104,"I fish up the road from Leaf Rapids towards Lynn Lake, i use bottom bouncers and night crawler harneses for walleye, i bring my own crawlers, there aren't any for sale once you get north of winnipeg ,also twister tail jigs, the same things i use in northwestern ontario, the exception is the hooks are to be barbless, and no live minnows, there will be big pike where you're going, you will need some wire leaders, preferrably at least a foot long, and i use fireline, so bring your favorite pike lures and your normal walleye stuff and have fun. Let us know how you do."

1203663,alumalunker,2010-05-24 20:44:00,763,hey thanks hoosier. Couple more ques for you. Do you know are these lakes relatively deep/clear or stained and shallow for the most part? lastly do you think Northerns will be shallow still or will they be already setting up in their summer patterns? (Not sure when or if the ice is out yet)Thanks again
1203684,sptrix,2010-05-24 21:48:00,175,"Can't speak to the bodies of water you'll be fishing, but my understanding is that ice was off many lakes in that area around May 1, which is at least 2-3 weeks earlier than normal. I'd suspect the fish will be heading into their summer patterns earlier as a result.Have fun, and give us a report when you get back."

1203953,hoosiercanadian,2010-05-25 18:18:00,104,"Go to www.travelmanitoba they will send you a fishing package that lists manitoba master angler records and the lakes where they were caught, fun to look at, also they will send you a very good map of manitoba, it will show the size of the area that you are going to, you might also pull up the leaf rapids web site, pick out some phone numbers and make some calls, the local conservation officers could give you some info on the area, call them up. The town of Leaf rapids , the people who sell groceries and gas all want tourists to come up there, so they all should be very willing to give you some pointers."
