3647586,Ogoki,2015-03-13 19:45:00,291,"Obabikon, I live about 2 hours from Lake Erie. Have spent 4 days fishing there. Have spent over a year of my life fishing the wilds of Ontario. Its daylight and dark difference . I like how you compared it to marlin fishing . Bobing up and down in 5 ft waves with no scenery , other than other boats just not for me either . But to each their own. I have even said to locals here that tell me I don't need to go to Ontario to catch walleye. I just tell them I would rather spend a day on a wilderness Ontatio lake than a week on Erie. I just don't have enough space here to tell how much the Ontatio wilderness and the lakes up there , mean to me ."
3647634,michigan walleye guy,2015-03-13 20:21:00,95,"Another great thread! There are really dozens of reasons why I love Canada so much. I guess the biggest reason, for me, is the chance to live out those dreams spawned by reading the old Outdoor Life articles from the late '60's, early 70's, about fishing virgin waters and eating walleye fillets on the shoreline of some beautiful lake, knowing that it's all yours for the week. Guys like Bob Cary and Erwin Bauer were my heroes back then. I love the anticipation of the trip, the endless equipment lists and menus, constantly tweaked from one trip to the next. I love reading the Cabela's catalogs from cover to cover, each year adding some new items--(like I really need another fishing reel, but that new Verano reel looks great, and I should probably buy another XML rod to pair it with). I love haunting the online discussion boards like this one, further stoking the anxiety levels to even greater heights, reading and re-reading Mike Borger's trip reports and pics. I love spending hours sorting, cleaning, and otherwise fussing over the mountain of fishing tackle I already have. I absolutely love the drive from the U.P. through Duluth, the Iron Range, and finally through I-Falls, across the border to Nestor Falls. I love seeing Michelle and Dave again in Nestor Falls. I love ordering the exact same breakfast every year at the Lawg Caybun in Nestor Falls, prior to flying in to Larus Lake or Clear Lake. The first fish of the trip, the first shore lunch, the loons, the sunrises, the absolute stillness of a Canadian dawn, the camaraderie with the guys as the week flies by, the moose, the absolute best sleep I get all year, and just the knowledge that this is as good as it will get, ever. I love coming back to my family a completely new man after a week in the bush. Canada makes every single other unpleasantness that pops up during the rest of the year bearable, knowing that the real reason for living still exists up there, up north. I never ever feel as completely alive as I do when I'm up in Canada, and I absolutely am counting down the 46 days till I'm back on Larus Lake again."
3647706,LoDo,2015-03-13 20:55:00,721,"completely nailed it!!!!!!!!!!I'm going to add. First how far back do i need to go to think of the hype, excitement and months of packing i do in my head prior to the trip to the airport from Denver to Minneapolis. There are several happy hours, golf outings and get togethers with our group that take place months before our trip and not once is Canada not mentioned. This trip isn't another week on the beach, city skyline or romantic euro vacation. Its not the fancy suit and vegas dance clubs or dress down drunkin weekend in New Orleans. This trip is annual. This trip is on your schedule every year and never comes fast enough. Canada fishing is the ultimate bonding trip for every mans man. My trip kicks off two months prior to boarding my plane. The constant internet education with historic weather, maps, water temps, this blog, new gear, menus and what i'm going to do differently this year than last. The three trips to Cabelas and Bass Pro to let my mind wander and dream. The numerous lindy rigs I tie on the living room floor while my wife looks at me with strange curiosity. This is the only vacation where my mind is completely at ease. Im only thinking about the lake and everything it has to offer. No phones, internet, traffic, noise, etc... Best buddies, constant jokes, great food, laughter, love and most importantly freedom. I love this trip and thank my father more than he'll ever know for introducing me to this vacation. I'll never stop going and can't wait for my 6month old son to join me when he's old enough. Happy fishing boys!!"
3648018,alleycat19,2015-03-14 01:06:00,37,I am spoiled as I live in northeastern Ontario. That is why I fish Canada. lol. Like everyone else here I always look forward to our back lake excursions. Now we are not going to lodges but camping it out. Depending on snow and ice coverage we usually aim for first week in may. try to hit ice out as close as possible targeting brook and lake trout as walleye not open yet. Tenting it out in snow storms at times but its worth it. usually 50 miles in on logging roads. then unload the atv's and go another 20 before we hit our campsite. from there multiple lakes to fish reaching them by atv or portaging. it is cold so black flies aren't out yet which is a plus. literally lakes to yourself for a week. brook trout over 3 lbs common and 5lbers showing up often enough. lakers In the 2 to 6lb range as well. like other said though the fishing isn't everything. spending time with family friends andthe planning is most of the fun. the fish is a bonus.
3649754,Draco1206,2015-03-14 16:08:00,175,"It's funny to see that so many of us think alike. I too enjoy the planning and prep before the trip almost as much as the trip itself. Whenever my brothers, son, and nephew get together at a family function it's pretty much all we talk about. The wives, daughters,nieces, and those that don't fish make fun of us and wonder how we can talk so much about a trip that might still be 8 or 9 months away. I basically do two major trips each year. One U.P. bowhunting trip and one Canada fly in fishing trip. I have a pool table in my ""man cave"" and half the year it is piled high with hunting equipment and the other half of the year it's piled high with fishing equipment. I don't think anyone has played pool on that table for 5 or 6 years. We are constantly texting each other about new lakes, likely fishy looking areas on Google Earth, Flashearth, or Bing maps, menus, new lures, etc. It's good to know we're not the only ""obsessed"" ones out there."
3666690,Thumpr50,2015-03-19 08:17:00,139,"I go to Canada because:-you have the chance to see things you can't back home like a bear swimming out in the middle of nowhere, moose and other wildlife; because of the peace and beauty of the Canadian wilderness; because you can catch 75-100 walleyes a day, throw most all of them back and catch some more tomorrow; because the fish you eat are fresher and the beer colder there; because of all the memories and stories that are made. We have photo albums dedicated to Canada trips since 1995 and the collection is priceless!"
3666786,bigwalleye1,2015-03-19 08:26:00,2632,"Lots of reasons, but, like most folks, if I have to explain them..... The water's clearer, the folks are friendlier, there are more fish that want to commit suicide, the scenery is prettier, the rugged beauty, the ability to fish alone and have fish that do what you'd classicly expect them to do... The ability to decompress, separate myself from the day to day problems of life, reconnect with friends, the outdoors, and the life that's been going on up there since I left. It's like there's this little window in the Canadian bush I get to look through once or twice a year. I go home, but I know that little window to an alternate existence is there, waiting for me, and it keeps me sane until I can go again. Finally, with the exchange rate, the gas is 20% cheaper, the fish are 20% bigger, you can do more, go farther, and buy more bait for the same dollar, and I fully expect to have 20% more fun this year than last!!!"

Our huge growth came from 1945 to 1964, also known as the baby boom. Don't blame immigrants for how crowded our country is, blame all those WW2 vets who decided to have a bunch of kids. Also blame, or credit, those kids for the state the country is in today. The boomers (my generation) have been the dominant political force in this country for forty years."
3676802,LoDo,2015-03-21 21:53:00,721,"I'm not sure how old Kayak is but if he was born before 1950 then his statement regarding US population ""more than doubling"" is indeed correct. $150million in 1950. Over 300million today. I'm not going to stir the pot with the immigration comment. I'll just say since 1990 we've opened the flood gates."

Thus, similar to Non-Anglers, Anglers consider it important that a vacation creates lasting memories and enriches family relationships.

The 21 year old I have taken to Canada once . . . he is a very avid fisherman. My wife is a good fisherman and my 19 year old doesn't fish much, but I know we will get action and he will have a good time. Who knows what the future will bring with two adult boys, but I know this trip without other buddies, girlfriends, etc. might be the last time there will be just the four of us for a week, and Canada is the only place in the world I want to be with them!"

We became friends and the only time we would see each other was on that trip. It's now 15 years later. A couple of them have passed away but a few of us still get together, now on our own dime, every year for a week of relaxation. Sure I catch plenty of walleye south of the border but it is great to see some old friends."
3674194,kayakmatt,2015-03-20 20:37:00,105,"The basis of most all the comments is Canada's lack of population and massive land area combined with uncountable number of lakes. The population of the US has more than doubled in my lifetime, and it's simply way too crowded for us remote wilderness admirers. There really is no wilderness left in the eastern half of the US anymore. I miss the old days. I feel sorry for the future generations that will never know the wilderness (and probably not really care anyway). Thank you Canada for your brutal winters and not allowing unmitigated immigration to overrun your country, so someone like myself can boat 20 miles and fish all day and never see another person, boat, cabin, or no trespassing sign!"

Canada provides that adventure while for the most part offering very little chance we would kill ourselves. These trips for the most part are the closest any of us will get to roughing it, add in the beauty, the tranquility, the fishing and we get it. We all have the people in our lives who will say ""I don't get why you enjoy that."" Exactly, you don't get it."

3645178,HeHooksHimself,2015-03-13 07:51:00,725,"My wife will attest to this. For our group, it is a fever. Even during the week we are there we see the day out as ""looming."" On the way home, while we bask in the memories of the week, we start planning for the next year. During the long winter, we have a countdown going http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown...so=20150521T00 and we send emails with clever sayings to remind the others who are going how many days we have left. Ex. Indiana is a SICK STATE (68) When Doc and I call each other, we always answer the phone with something like, ""Canadian Fishing Adventures, Department of Anxiousness"" or ""Hello, Pikemaster speaking."" As much as my wife has other ideas, the annual budget revolves around our fishing trips, one in the spring, one in the fall. When she says something like, ""Maybe you could miss a year so we can buy new furniture,"" or some other silly notion, I remind her that fishing is a given, where else might we find a gap? Doc and I have committed that as long as we are able (we are in our mid-60s), we are going to go fishing in Canada. When we can no longer do what it takes to fish like we do now and if our kids won't get us there, well we will take the Temple Bay Lodge bus and they can wheel us right up to the boat. When one of us checks out the other will dedicate the next trip to the other but we promise not to skip it. There is so much more than the fish in our fishing trips, although my car is plastered with O.A.F.H. Angler Award trophy stickers recognizing trophy size catch and release toothy critters. Fishing in Canada is about escaping the place we must live and work to be in the place we really want to live, even if only a week at a time. We have a multitude of traditions from the time we depart from home until we arrive back. The utter joy we experience is one of the things that makes our lives worth the living. Here is to tight lines and fish on!"

3645874,Obabikon,2015-03-13 09:30:00,2370,"This is an interesting conversation. The odds are, none of us will ever catch a world record walleye, northern, musky, bass... any of them. Most of us go on trips for the overall experience, not with the goal of breaking a record. If someone's big walleye is 31"" and my biggest is 29""... who cares. When we die, we're both fish food! Lake Erie is probably the best spot to go for big walleye, but its more comparable to marlin fishing than to a Canadian Shield lake. My type of fishing is 3 guys in a 18 foot boat, without another soul in sight. I can't describe the feeling I get driving a 40 hp tiller across the lake on a cool morning, heading out to catch lunch. Wonderful memories, joys, sorrows, anticipation, relaxation, peace and serenity.... all balled up into one 10 minute boat ride. If your most important goals are to break records, you're missing out on the experience. It's nice when or if it happens, but has nothing to do with the reason I fish."

How about laying in bed listening to the Loons screaming back and forth to each other...

I go to Canada because it's all about the quality & quantity of catching BIG, THICK, FAT Walleyes (averaging 20-27 inches long) ALL DAY LONG!!! Getting tired & bored catching so many Walleyes! Then having the challenge of trying to catch & keep ""eater"" size Walleyes<18""..... Oh what problems to have LOL...Bringing ""newbies"" to Canada to fish & watch their excitement jumping up & down in the boat clapping their hands catching all those big Walleyes for the first time...Hooking into a BIG Northern Pike that gives you the thrill of the fight .... Or have one follow a a 16"" Walleye your reeling in & watch it grab it next to the boat & bite it off behind the gills....practicing C.P.R. (Catch Picture Release) & hearing people say ""I can't believe I am catching & releasing all these big fish""....The scenic long drive through the remote forest & the winding hills & rock cliffs and beautiful lakes....exploring miles & miles out on the lake finding new favorite fishing spots...taking a mid day break on an island having lunch in the peace & quiet enjoying the beautiful scenery & if hot enough a swim in the lake to cool off ... Enjoying the solitude of fishing all day without seeing or fishing near other boats....watching wildlife (Moose, Bears, Loons, Sea Gulls, Pelicans, Eagles, Ducks, Otters, Beavers, Deer, Fox).... Spending a week of fishing all day long, then relaxing in the evenings enjoying meals & beverages together, sharing fishing tales & visiting with other resort guests & playing games & going to bed totally exhausted from all the fresh air only to get up again the next morning to do it all over again....with great family & friends making fantastic memories to last a lifetime!!!Also, looking forward to our yealy trip helps get me through the long winter months!!!

Hardly a day goes by that I don't think about our trip. And, as someone else mentioned earlier, our trip is a tradition with my family and some dear friends. If I had to pick out one favorite part of our trips is doing a portage to the remote lakes. You're on a lake that not many people have experienced, fishing from an old leaky boat with a 3hp motor with my wife and kids along. It's priceless to me. And, your in the wilderness away from the busy life we all have back home. It's so relaxing. I could go on but I'll cut it short and say I hope to continue going to Canada as long as I'm able."
