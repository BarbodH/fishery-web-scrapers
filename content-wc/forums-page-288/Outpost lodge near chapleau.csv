3675778,acplumber,2015-03-21 14:25:00,80,"Had anyone stayed here before? Any info on their services? And fishing?Sounds like a nice place, they have a bunch of different species to fish for. Wondering if it's all from the same lake or if there is some portaging to be done to get to the trout lakes. The price seems right, especially with the American planThanks"

3676818,acplumber,2015-03-21 22:07:00,80,It doesn't say from what I can seeJust says it near thessalon
3677018,TIGHTLINER,2015-03-22 04:23:00,223,"There are several along hwy 129 and largest one that i can think of is 5 mile lodge, there is another closer to chapleau something sunset was run at one time by a guy named lee cole. I know nothing of either place other than seeing the ads along the road."
3677114,acplumber,2015-03-22 05:58:00,80,"The name of the place is ""the outpost lodge""Here's their websitehttp://www.outpostlodge.com/010~Home/Limberlost lodge is on the same lake"
3677290,kzoofisher,2015-03-22 07:39:00,5144,"Sure sounds like a good place to take a family if fishing is part of the plan but not the center of it. Prices are very reasonable and it's close enough to Thessalon and Lake Huron for some day trips. Here's a link to an old thread on it. The logging trucks would concern me the most, I'd have to know if the area was still logging heavily or if it has moved on in the last 17 years. If it is quiet it sounds like a great place for my brother; kids 6 and 3, wife who likes scenery but showers too and a relatively small lake that can be boated or canoe/kayaked. Would love to hear from someone with more recent experience. It's only three hours from my cabin which would break up his trip from Cincy nicely.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums.../t-173235.html"
3689098,BuckeyeBill,2015-03-24 23:46:00,76,"Have stayed here several times. It is a nice, quiet lodge. The cabins are ok but nothing special. The owners, Jim and Ann are great hosts and we consider them our friends. Jim is an excellent chef and the meals alone are worth the trip. Now for the bad news....the fishing has gone down hill. The lake the lodge is on, Jobam (for short), is a clear water lake with lake trout, smallmouth bass, a few pike and 1 billion stunted rock bass that drive you crazy. When targeting smallies you will catch 20 rockies to one smallmouth. We have moved on to northwestern ontario where the fishing is outstanding. Much longer trip from Ohio but well worth it. If anyone wants more info on the Outpost Lodge I would be glad to help."
3689226,kzoofisher,2015-03-25 04:23:00,5144,"Sounds like the lake needs a couple of things, more pike and lots of rock bass fish fries. Rockies are very tasty, a lot like bluegill but bigger. The fact that they are easy to catch makes it an attractive location for the parent who wants to get the kids hooked on fishing, too. Definitely going to put it in the file of places to recommend."
3696794,BuckeyeBill,2015-03-26 20:11:00,76,"kzoo, these rockies max out at about 4"". You could feed the entire province of Ontario and not dent the population."
