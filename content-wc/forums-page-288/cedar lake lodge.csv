The last two years that week would put you still in post spawn activity and fairly shallow. But this year, if the predictions for earlier ice out hold true, they could be starting to move deeper and I would certainly have available those types of lures, bait, etc. to be successful during a mayfly hatch."
2345210,Guest,2014-01-12 21:50:00,0,my buddy just returned from the all canada show in chicago and are thinking of visiting one of the lodges on cedar lake in mid september has anyone fished the lake along with a connecting perault lake;normally fishing 65% walleye and 34% northerns;can we reasonably expect to catch between 30-50 walleyes/man/day and is worth going to perault lake a few days?? any comments would be appreciated jim wolf chicago boys
2345306,ftfarms,2014-01-13 02:53:00,444,I like cedar lake for walleye and smallmouth. We don't spend much time fishing for northern so I'm not much help there. We do usually Muskie fish some and have raised some big ones on cedar. I've fished a lot of lakes in Ontario and cedar is one of my favorites not for numbers or size just the lake it self. We fish perualt usually one day for smallmouth. I like the east side of cedar the best. Done real well in Nelson lake but for use that's about as far as we go west Last mid July it was hot real hot in the after noon me and my wife caught over 400 walleyes and over 250 smallmouth We fished 5 1/2 days but not a lot of hours with it being that hot. The best day was 98 walleyes and 64 smallmouth. 27 1/2 inch walleye and 19 inch smallmouth all in all it was a good week. We stay at cedar point resort I like where it's located on the lake.
2345386,fishguide1800,2014-01-13 06:08:00,84,Definitely can't go wrong heading to cedar lake.real good walleye populations.fishing for northern pike will be alright and you will see more muskie chasing your baits.good smallmouth and some good perch fishing also.portrait is not as good as cedar lake is.except for muskie fishing I don't normally head there.very well laid out lake when it comes to nasty weather.you can always find a decent spot to get out of the wind.hope you checked out Clarke's northern lights camp at the show.I usually book my guests there.best boats on the lake.no upgrade charges and the best free bait.
