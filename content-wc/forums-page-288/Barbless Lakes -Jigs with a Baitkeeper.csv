3691634,KrazyKaiser,2015-03-25 16:03:00,2,I am going to fish a couple Barbless hook lakes in Ontario this spring. I was wondering if the baitkeeper tangs on certain Jig heads can be counted as a barb? For example the C&S H2O Jigs have a large keeper that is basically a barb. I just dont want to run into any trouble with a Co
3691682,Carnhzkr,2015-03-25 16:14:00,964,From the Rules Using Fishing Tackle page of the Ontario.ca website: Barbless hooka hook made without a barba hook with its barb completely removeda hook with its barb flattened against the shaft of the hook This addresses only the barb on the point of the hook and says nothing about the bait keeper which is on the shank. I can't imagine that would be an issue.
