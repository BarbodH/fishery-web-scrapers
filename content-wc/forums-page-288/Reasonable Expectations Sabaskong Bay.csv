What kind of numbers for walleyes are possible? The reason I ask is I just mentioned my trip to a friend and he had terrible luck a few years ago in this area. My personal best trip doesn't rival many of the stories I hear on this board, but I just need some reassurance that with my alittle bit better than average ability I'll be on the fish.Thx"
3714522,BornToFish,2015-03-31 11:31:00,1224,"I have been fishing another area lake for many years. I've observed that the walleye bite can be ""off"" for a day or two due to reasons such as weather, but rarely is ""off"" for an entire week. I've heard people say over the years that they didn't do at all well for their week fishing on the same lake that I fish. Their week could be just before our vacation, at the same time as our vacation or just after our vacation. They concluded the lake was a ""bad"" fishery, even though our vacations were terrific. On several occasions, I later found out that these folks did not adapt to the conditions on the lake at that time. For example, anglers that normally fish during the opening weeks of the season used their tried and true presentations/techniques developed for springtime fishing and fished their normal springtime spots. It didn't occur to them that they needed to adapt to fishing during August. Do you respect the ability of your friend as a fisherman, especially at the time of the season that you will be fishing? I encourage you to not let the comments from your friend deter you from your plans. You might consider hiring a local guide for a day early during your vacation to learn a handful of spots, but more importantly to learn proven techniques for that time of the season. At a minimum, spend some time with the lodge owner and make some friends at the dock. Chat with these folks each day during your vacation to make minor adjustments as may be needed. The worse thing that you can do is suffer in silence. I see no reason to believe that the fish are not there, you just need to catch them. Go make some memories!!"

3714634,Obabikon,2015-03-31 11:56:00,2370,"If fishing is slow, many people out of Nestor Falls boat to Miles Bay... long ride, but fishing is pretty darn good out there."
3715130,MikeinMN,2015-03-31 13:47:00,190,"If you have some musky tackle, take it with you to Sabaskong Bay. Our group was there a couple years ago, and we raised several musky and hooked one while fishing for walleye. I think the musky fishing there could be really good with some more appropriate tackle, even with limited musky experience. Our walleye fishing was not that great, but it was the first time any of us fished that area, and the weather was pretty bad the whole time we were there. Although our fishing was fair at best, I do think fishing in that area is usually very comparable to most of the well-known drive-to lakes within a couple hours of the US border."
