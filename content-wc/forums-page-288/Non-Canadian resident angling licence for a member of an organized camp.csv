3680386,1jigfish2,2015-03-22 22:33:00,110,"I am not clear on the question, but I will guess at what you are asking. If you are working at a camp for the summer, you would not be a legal resident of Ontario. I believe that you have to live there at least 6 months to qualify. With the status of non resident, you would have to get a yearly nonresident license, either conservation or sportsman. You can buy it on your way up there, or online through the Ministry. Hope this is what you were looking for, if not, please clarify the question."
3680434,adempsey,2015-03-22 23:18:00,963,My interpretation is that it's a license you can get if you are part of a group of 5 or more children under the age of 18. Probably for camps and such.
3680786,Obabikon,2015-03-23 05:37:00,2370,"I sent an email to the MNR asking for clarification, however all I have found.... Â• For non-Canadian resident groups of children (at least five people under the age of 18 years), there is a special licence for members of an organized camp. This licence is available from ServiceOntario/ Ministry of Natural Resources offices (see page 96)."
3683458,Guest,2015-03-23 17:31:00,0,"This is a license intended for groups like boy/girl scouts, official school outings, etc. You MUST present information in person at a local MNR office during office hours and get the licenses in person. In most cases, you need to make an appointment to visit a local MNR office these days. It is not for a group of parents travelling with a couple kids each."

I have switched positions for a little while and I had to track down the documentation on this. These licences are for non-residents who are under 18 years of age and a member of an approved organized camp such as Boy Scouts for example. The leader of the group applies for the licences and must apply for at least 5 members of the organized group. Organized camp is interpreted to mean a specialized group (examples include scouts, schools, church groups, group homes, and summer camps). If in doubt it is best to contact the local MNR district office or the Outdoors Card Centre. The sport fishing limits apply. Licence is valid for 21 consecutive days. The cost of each licence is $8.22. This includes taxes and the new service fee. If you have any questions let me know!
