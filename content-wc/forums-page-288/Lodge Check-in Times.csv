3698057,Timing,2015-03-27 06:51:00,95,Much of this true. On the bright side consider it best location on the lake and probably least cost for lodging.
3698169,NLpike,2015-03-27 07:03:00,28,True dat.
3699858,tv4fish,2015-03-27 12:32:00,2694,"You guys are to be commended for sticking it out that long then. That is just a shame that they have gone to the trouble of creating that camp and then letting it ""go to pot"". They need to get it in the hands of ""someone else"" that will take care of it. (And, yes, I know who the owners are)."
3700298,Bakefish,2015-03-27 14:02:00,1077,"$300/night for a cabin doesn't sound cheap for a place that's falling apart, especially when there are countless lodges on the lake."
3701138,Pooch,2015-03-27 17:44:00,4619,Mahkwa has been good about returning emails for our upcoming trip this fall. I still think they are really nice people and would hate to miss a trip there. I make three Canada trips a year to three different camps spending thirty days a year on the water in Canada and the Mahkwa fall trip is by far my favorite.The camp has character and in my opinion is located on the best part of the lake.Pooch
3706354,mickr,2015-03-29 09:14:00,74,"here is something that you might consider - your OP mentioned a lodge last year and a new lodge this year - there are advantages to being a repeat customer. I fully understand that lodge owners have limited resources to clean and prep all of the cabins. It's been my experience over the years that the repeat customers can arrive early and have their cabins clean and ready to go and the newbies tend to be the ones showing up at 3 and getting that ""last to be cleaned"" cabin. And that to me is fair game. The lodge owner certainly wants to keep everyone happy but from their perspective I am sure it is in their interests to ensure that their repeat business is accommodated first."
3694178,Timing,2015-03-26 09:03:00,95,"If it was my lodge it would be frustrating when people arrive early as check out check it day is very busy.That said, we arrive (9am-10am) early but do not check in, leave gear in truck and take our boat fishing. Get settled in cabin about 1pm, as noon is check in for us."
3694434,Carnhzkr,2015-03-26 09:44:00,964,"That's a thought. I could see about getting there early, launching the boat and parking my rig somewhere out of the way. Get back to camp about 4:00 for official check-in, unpack, and fry up some fresh caught walleye. For that matter, there's a public launch just across the bay from Fisherman's Cove."
3694994,HeHooksHimself,2015-03-26 12:05:00,725,"The camp we usually go to in the spring has a landing where we pick up our boats. Then a portage is involved and the owner generally likes to be there to supervise the groups over the portage. Usually we respect the 10:00 boat pickup time as best we can but it is frustrating to find that other groups have arrived significantly early and have picked the best boats and are off to the portage because they have done it before. When we do straggle into camp we find that others are already on the water and we have to unload and rig up. If everyone just followed the rules it would make everyone happy. My guess is that early arrivers have just been tolerated and suffer no consequences if they arrive early. One time when we went a little further north we did not time the trip as well and arrived a few hours early. Even though our cabin was ready, the camp operator just told us check in time was 3:00 and he would be sure to accommodate us at that time. We had a pretty boring time picking dandelions and smoking cigars, but we learned our lesson."
3695018,KevinSB,2015-03-26 12:13:00,73,"Our camp has a noon check-in time. Like many, we're always eager to arrive and used to arrrive a little earlier, unloading stuff but not heading to see the owners to officially check in until time. We justified this since the owners didn't seem to mind and since we leave a day early each year to avoid Saturday border crossing and to allow us to get back home by bedtime Friday to see our families. Anyway, our owners now actually block the entrance until noon, which strikes me as totally fair. This avoids the problem of some guests coming early and others respecting official check-in time.So we know now to arrive at noon and not before. Last year, our eager group made it at 12:01."
3695258,v-bay gord,2015-03-26 13:26:00,3168,"Just another observation and a comment on the folks that like to squeeze in an extra day of fishing. While I understand the eagerness it is somewhat unfair to the lodge owner to expect them to happily accommodate you.....especially since most figure it is going to be a ""freebie"". I can relate to the situation where it was tolerated till one year you find the road blocked till check-in time. It is even more problematic when camp boats are involved....and costs and charges are based on a later check in time."
3695738,P&y only,2015-03-26 15:59:00,133,"My camp owner and I get along great. He lets me show up early. My cabin wont be ready and the boats not cleaned yet. So I clean up the boat and then go fishing until it's check in time. But I've been there many, many times so he doesn't need to show me around."
3695802,Carnhzkr,2015-03-26 16:18:00,964,"I completely understand your point, Gord. I would never consider using a lodge boat earlier than expected. That's really no different than showing up early at Avis to rent a car and expecting to get a free half day. Personally, I like the idea of blocking the road until official check in time. I can see how some customers might not like that, but it's a sure way to keep everyone honest. I'd probably be in line outside the chain like penguins at the zoo waiting to be fed."
3696586,nitroman,2015-03-26 19:42:00,368,Gate is closed at our camp but our group is usually first in line! I am great friends with the camp owners but i will wait in line as i know they have a job to do and dont need distractions.
3697417,NLpike,2015-03-27 01:24:00,28,"I understand there are many conscientious camp owners out there. To you I say, keep up the good work. I have been going to Canada for 7 years at Mahkwa Lodge. The cabins are barely standing, let alone clean. Toilets falling through the floor, sketchy hot water, no heat. We don't go for the comfort or the cleanliness, we go for the fishing. We show up when we get there, usually early. There is no difference before or after their ""cleaning"" service, so no point in waiting. This is the first year we won't be going there due to the management being too incompetent or lazy to take a reservation. It's sad, because we have so many war stories about the place. They simply would not return emails, snail mail or phone calls. Probably for the best, as last year the floating dock was broken in two and very dangerous."
3697609,ogilville,2015-03-27 05:09:00,262,We have been going to the same camp for many years. Sometimes everything goes smooth on the trip up and we do arrive a little earlier than check in time. There really aren't many places to go or things to do on the way there anyway. We always tell the camp owner if the cabin isn't ready we can just hang out off to the side and stay out of the way until things are ready. The owner is very good about trying to get us checked in as soon as possible. I find if you are courteous and try to let them get things ready then they appreciate you and will do their best to make it a good week for you.
3686498,Carnhzkr,2015-03-24 11:12:00,964,"We stayed at Lac Seul Lodge last year. I had noticed that their website listed a check-in time of 3:00. Since I prefer to arrive mid-day, in time to unload and catch dinner, I called to see if it'd be okay to arrive at 1:00 or 2:00. I was told that they prefer their guests arrive at 3:00, so the cleaning crew has plenty of time to do a thorough job. I can certainly appreciate that, so we arrived at a little after 3:00 as they suggested. When we got there, it was apparent that we were probably the last group to arrive. I could see that the other cabins were already occupied and there were empty trailers hooked up to pickups parked by the cabins. This year we'll be staying at Fisherman's Cove, just because available dates worked out better for us at FC than at LSL. I see FC also lists a check-in time of 3:00, but I'll probably arrive an hour or two early. What's the worst that can happen? Maybe they'll tell us we're early and our cabin's not ready yet. If that's the case, we can always kill some time at Dutchies or the store at Rainbow Point. I'm just wondering if others abide by the ""rules"" and arrive at the designated check-in time, or cheat a bit and arrive an hour or two early?"
3686546,v-bay gord,2015-03-24 11:29:00,3168,"One time I had just got out of bed on Saturday morning (6 a.m.) to look out my kitchen window only to see three rigs pulled up in front of the lodge with one dude brushing his teeth. Now, I can barely talk to my wife before having a cup of coffee, so let's say I was in a bit of a funk for awhile. The moral of the story is there's ""pushing the limit"" and then there's starting off on the wrong foot. Best advice is to be upfront with the lodge, explain your situation, and see if they will accommodate you. For me I don't have too much of a problem as long as its something I know about ahead of time. Turn-over days are quite hectic and even having a conversation and a coffee can be problematic at times...... I set my check-in at 3:00, hoping nobody will show up before noon...."
3686674,Walleye_Guru,2015-03-24 12:02:00,62,"Speaking from the lodge owner prospective it's a balancing act. I want to bend over backwards to accommodate you, but at the same time have to do what's best for ALL the guests. It's important to remember most lodges are run by a small staff. They want to serve you, but human resources are limited and have to be used efficiently. When you arrive early, it does take away from the focus needed to get the lodge ready for the next guests. Inevitably conversations start, fishing reports are requested, people want to buys licenses, they'll want ice, bait, gas and the list goes on. Those things in and of themselves are not bad, but when the staff is trying to get ready for the influx of next week's guests, it detracts from the overall service for everyone. Best advice is be patient and arrive after the requested time. Doing so gives everyone a crack at great service, clean accommodations and a welcoming atmosphere. I realize this may not be the popular viewpoint, but it's the reason behind the request. Spoken or unspoken"
3686690,wallydave,2015-03-24 12:10:00,2151,"If you are going to arrive early, just give the lodge owner a heads up! Explain that you might be early, before the posted hour. Most of the time, if you give them notice well ahead of time, they will work with you. The outfitters I have stayed with have been willing to work with me on this. Treat them as you would want to be treated, most of the time thats all you need to do."
3686746,Carnhzkr,2015-03-24 12:30:00,964,"I completely understand the reasoning behind the designated check-in time. I know turnover day is the most hectic day of the week for lodge owners. My point was that last year I called in advance to see if I could arrive earlier than the posted check-in. I was told not to, so I didn't. When we got to the lodge it was apparent that we were the only people that follow the rules. I was just wondering if other folks take the check-in time as a suggestion or do like we did and stall around until 3:00 only to find out that I could have spent the last hour unloading my crap and getting ready, rather than looking at T-shirts and toy moose. I'm certainly not a lodge owner, but it would seem to me that it might be better if people arrived at staggered times (some at 1:00, some at 2:00, some at 3:00) rather than one large influx at 3:00."
3686826,Old Timer,2015-03-24 13:03:00,255,"Just call ahead the day before and see if your camp can accommodate you. If not, show up at the appointed time. Easy. I know this from experience."
3687146,Pooch,2015-03-24 14:24:00,4619,"Seems like common courtesy to try to get there about the appointed time. When we make trips for over two weeks we watch the camp turnover happen a couple times and it's a zoo for the folks running the camp. If I ran a camp I can see not wanting new guests arriving until I was sure the cabins were really ready for them. There is always something unexpected that comes up on turnover day. The one constant is that come turnover day, seems EVERYONE is gone at first light. Last year we were up early the last day and heck, the camp was a ghost town. We appeared to be the slackers pulling out around seven AM or close to it.That said, when arriving if I could get our boat in the water and just hang around or go out fishing for awhile then come back into camp and then move into the cabin that shouldn't hurt anyone. I wouldn't think anyway.We try to be very low maintenance while in camp.Good grief, it's a long time till our trips start! Go through this every year like a kid. Pooch"
3687162,SinOrSwim,2015-03-24 14:29:00,1528,"If you call and ask just tell them 3:00 for the cabin is perfectly fine. But, you were hoping to get the boat launched etc. See if that works."
3687218,packpro,2015-03-24 14:48:00,695,"Never realized how lucky we are. We get almost a 3/4 day of fishing in on the first day. Prior group is out of the camp usually at 7:30 AM. They go for breakfast. All the bags and totes are set out for pickup by the camp hands. They get them loaded onto a trailer. Now the cabins are clear and the staff starts in right away with cleaning. If we arrive early, say 9AM or so, we are allowed 1/2 hour access to the cabin, but our gear stays on the porch. While we start fishing the staff can finish the cabins. This is unusual and has only happen once in 17 years. The camp is usually ready when we arrive. Our unpacking occurs at the end of the day. It would be torment to have to wait until that late in the day to fish after the anticipation of the long drive. Maybe it is easier for the fly/boat ins. The hard departure time to catch transportation out of the camp insures the cabins are empty early."
3688242,Ranger319,2015-03-24 19:22:00,166,"No clue what our camps check in time is. We let them know every year that we will be there between 8-10am. We have ZERO expectation to get into our cabin before the, i'm guessing, 3pm checkin time. All we ask is for a spot to park the truck and boat trailer. Never had an issue and get an extra 1/2+ day of fishing."
