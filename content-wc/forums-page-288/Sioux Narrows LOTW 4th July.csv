3691578,LOW1,2015-03-25 15:49:00,2828,"http://www.maptown.com/canadiannauti...al-charts.htmlYou will want map numbers 6213 and 6212. A GPS with a map chip is also highly recommended. Most of the area tackle shops, etc sell the paper maps. The chips can be harder to locate so consider buying that in advance if you want one.In the meantime this will wet your appetite: http://lakeofthewoodsmn.com/map.html"

3695554,Ver88,2015-03-26 15:10:00,114,"The 4th of July is a great time to fish sioux narrows. The sunset channel area and yellow girl bay are great for numbers of nice walleye. The best part about that time of year is you can find fish just about anywhere. You can pick your preferred tactic and it will probably work. I like to cast jigs or cranks in the shallows, but you can also catch fish jigging on the humps, or trolling spinners and crawlers. Send me a pm if you would like to discuss specifics."

3709962,LOW1,2015-03-30 08:31:00,2828,Especially if the ice out is by a normal or earlier than normal date the deep water and nearby areas north of the Three Sisters islands incentral/northcentral Whitefish Bay will likely be popular for lake trout. Minnow harnesses with heavy weights are commonly used.
