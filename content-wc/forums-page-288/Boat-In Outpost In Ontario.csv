3661242,emma17,2015-03-17 18:24:00,436,"A group of 7 of us went to Obabikon last July and did really well. Musky, Good sized Northern, Perch and Walleye in numbers and size. Reasonable price on American Plan too. It's a boat in from Morson. http://www.obabikon.com/"
3698417,Pug1,2015-03-27 07:37:00,1,"There is another option. Several years ago we took the train to Allenwater Bridge. Took the train out of Sioux Lookout. Their website is www.allanwater.com. It has been a few years since we were there. I still get their flyer, so are still operating. Would go back, but have other places to go. The train ride was interesting."
3698561,stormerlake,2015-03-27 08:09:00,6,We would like to recommend Stormer Lake Lodge located north of Red Lake Ontario. It is the only drive-to lodge located on two World Class Walleye and Pike lakes. www.stormerlakelodge.com
3699090,SteveZ,2015-03-27 09:42:00,271,"Try JR's Portage Bay Camp. You can drive right to camp but it is pretty remote, or you can boat in from Ear Falls. Just as easy to drive to camp. Small camp, you have to do your own cooking, but clean and nice. Fishing is great on the English River or you can venture north onto Pacwash."
3566162,Cil,2015-02-20 20:59:00,10,Try Pipestone Lake only 7 hrs and your fishing couple good places Cedar Island Lodge with main lodge and 4 nice cabins or Gateway North super nice outpost no neighbours both are boat-ins
3566186,adempsey,2015-02-20 21:08:00,963,"I have a list of boat-in outposts, but that's all it is. I don't know much about any of them. You might consider a houseboat on Lac Seul as well.

3580586,Bill Krejca,2015-02-24 18:52:00,6107,"O'Sullivan's Rainbow, on O'Sullivan Lake near Nakina has a nice rustic outpost cabin 5 miles from the camp. It is located in a prime fishing area. It is on a small island, sandy beach, cool. Bill"
3581594,MrSimon,2015-02-25 06:44:00,922,"x2 on this. Their boat-in outpost cabin is superb. However, being from MN, you are closer to NWO, which has better fishing. Lac Seul all the way."
3582186,camp chef,2015-02-25 08:54:00,915,Take a look at Pipestone Lake Lodge. It is acool boat in They have a good website. I will go back again.
3582658,Carnhzkr,2015-02-25 11:04:00,964,"Camp Chef, I've seen you recommend Pipestone a few times. I've checked out their web site and I get the impression the lakes on this chain are better for bass and muskie than for walleye. Has that been your experience?"
3582946,camp chef,2015-02-25 12:00:00,915,It is a great lake for Big Walleyes but not really for numbers. It is clear and requires a whole different approach than we use on most Canadian shield lakes.......BUT... If I was looking for the elusive 30 plus inch Walleye this would be one of the places I could spend some time. They also have great lake trout fishing.
3584818,Baseline,2015-02-25 20:03:00,3207,"Its been awhile like 15 years, but we went to an outpost located in Basil Channel on Lake of the Woods. Went out of Morson Ontario Buena Vista Resort. We were out in the wild, cabin was great and the fishing was fantastic. Morson would be about 6 to 7 hours for you."
3586426,troutwater,2015-02-26 08:59:00,299,"I've been to Pipestone twice and really enjoyed both times(Art's Pipestone Lodge). True it's not known for numbers, but I do have my personal best from there and it's a very pretty lake. When I was there fishing pressure was very very low, but not sure how it is now since Cedar Island opened up. The Manitou is also a great boat in lake, but no walleye in the lake...at least a fishable population outside of one bay way up in the upper."
3660818,sgeisz,2015-03-17 16:00:00,15,We have been to Stokes Bay Resort the last two years and it was a remote outpost. The owner meets you at the Ash River Trail and you boat in or he picks you up in his boat. Great fishing we went in May and in July. Better in May. www.stokesbayresort.com
3565106,TMF89,2015-02-20 15:30:00,77,"Alright guys, so usually we do a fly-in each summer. This year it looks like the budget for that might not be in the cards, so we're looking at alternatives. We're doing either a drive-in or a boat-in, with a boat-in being ideal (especially to an outpost cabin, we're used to the solitude of fly-ins after all!). So I'm just wondering if anyone has any leads on outfitters/lodges that are either a boat-to location, or ones that have outposts that you can boat to. We have our own boats, and would prefer to bring them. However if that's not possible, we'd still be interested. Thanks guys!"
3565194,alberta bum,2015-02-20 15:59:00,312,what part of ontario are you looking at?
3565202,bthomas3333,2015-02-20 16:00:00,465,"Hi TMF,I can recommend Bow Narrows. It is a boat in and charges in CDN. They took really good care of me on a last minute trip last year when we got iced out of our normal May opener trip. Fishing is good. Their boats are nice (fantastic new 40hp outboards).Here is their website: http://www.bownarrows.comI know it isn't what you asked for but to me the price range is very similar for another fly-in out of Red Lake.http://www.vikingisland.caAnyway take a look at Bow Narrows.Good luck.Brett"
3565250,Mike Borger,2015-02-20 16:10:00,1554,"Need to know what region you're considering, how many people in your group and your max budget."
3565258,TMF89,2015-02-20 16:11:00,77,"Thanks Thomas, I'll check them out!We'd be most interested in NW Ontario, however Central or East would be a possibility as well. Basically we're from the Twin Cities in MN, and wouldn't want to drive more than 10-11 hours. Ideally the price would be less than $100 a day, or right around there. And we'll have two boats, three guys each. Probably."
3565338,bthomas3333,2015-02-20 16:18:00,465,I think if you bring your own food and prepare it yourself. Bow Narrows is like 760CAD which is like 600 USD so you are close.Check yourself but you will be close.B-
3565434,prov1800,2015-02-20 16:38:00,5010,Check out canada north lodge and uchi lake lodge.both are owned by the same owner.the canada north lodge has a great boat to outpost and you could use your own boats there.about a 12 mile run from the main camp.awesome fishing. For drive ins i recommend the canada nort lodge and clarkes northern lights camp..canada noryh is on the woman river system and clarkes would be on cedar lake.
3565546,123chadder,2015-02-20 17:16:00,429,happy day lodge
3565602,billy weaver,2015-02-20 17:26:00,470,"Check out Peffley's camp on Wabaskang Lake close to Ear Falls. You have to boat in 15 miles to camp or he picks you up in a big covered camp boat. It has eight cabins so its not like you are alone in the woods, but you can find plenty of water to fish. I take my own boat and my buddies use camp boats. With the smaller camp boats you can portage over an easy rapids and go for miles. Got lost one year, bought a hand held GPS the next. The price is right, check out his web-site."
3565850,stjoeguy,2015-02-20 18:53:00,979,"I'll add to the list. The Winoga Lodge outpost cabin on Lake St. Joseph is about as close as a boat-in cabin can come to a fly-in outpost cabin. It's a boat-in cabin 27 miles from the nearest cabin. Some people do fly in to it. It might be completely booked this summer, however, and is more than 100 per day. Winoga also has a boat-in cabin on Vaughn Lake near Sioux Lookout. Check with Dick Mansfield at Winoga Lodge. http://www.winoga.com Another spot on Lake St. Joseph is Camp Lake St. Joseph. It's a boat-to camp rather than outpost cabin, but the price is right in your range and the walleye fishing is great. Check with Merle Cameron or Doug & Shelley Earl. They'll be at the Northwest Sportshow in Minneapolis, 3/25/15 - 3/29/15. http://www.lakestjoseph.com/HOME.html I've stayed with both Winoga Lodge and Camp Lake St. Joseph and they're both great."
