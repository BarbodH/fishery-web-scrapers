3688618,Aspencreek,2015-03-24 20:27:00,2911,"Recommendation: Super 8 in Fort Francis, very nice big LIGHTED parking area, a Boston's next door for dinner, a pool and hot tub, very clean nice rooms, and a great selection for breakfast (waffels, eggs, baked goods) and good coffee."
3688818,wallydave,2015-03-24 21:00:00,2151,Boston has great pizza! Tim Hortons for breakfast is an option too!
3688906,muskyman73,2015-03-24 21:18:00,402,"I would cross at Baudette, less lines and best of all..........Alices Family Restaurant, the best friggin pancakes around !!!!!!!!"
3689186,btyreprich,2015-03-25 03:56:00,1067,"We cross the border at IF and have never considered Baudette. What is the mileage from IF to Baudette? What are the hotel & restaurant choices in Baudette? Now if we were to cross at Baudette, what is the best route to Ear Falls? Thanks in advance for any responses."
3690282,Babamel2,2015-03-25 09:21:00,414,"any of you ever stay at the Tee Pee in Ft. Francis? It's on 53, seems to have plenty of parking."
3690594,bkw67,2015-03-25 11:03:00,70,"Are you referring to the Tee Pee Motel in International Falls? If so, I have the last 4 times I have gone fishing in Canada. They have a couple of rooms with more than 2 beds. They also have additional rooms in the 'Annex' behind the main building (I've stayed in both). Nothing to write home over, but it is priced very reasonably and since I am flying to an outpost cabin the next night... I'm not looking for 3+ stars on the trip.Great location with the boarder just up the road. That reminds me, I need to call them and book our rooms!"
3693074,jaximus,2015-03-26 01:13:00,117,"great info so far, my group does a week long canoe trip through atikokan. we always have driven up through the night and cross the border around 4am with noone else around. we cross the border during the week though, as we try to avoid other groups/traffic as much as possible. weve talked about staying overnight near the border or in atikokan, but the little added cost, although small, would nearly double the per person cost of our trip so we avoided it. we havent seen much in the way of deer/moose crossing at night either, but that could be due to the noise of the 2 canoes on the roof, quite the whistle."

3682906,Jwendt15,2015-03-23 15:20:00,72,"Anyone have any recommendations for a lodge/hotel for a larger group of guys around International Falls? We have 8 this year and trying to find what our options are. Trying to avoid having to get 3-4 rooms in a hotel, but it might be our only option. Last year we drove through the night and had one too many close encounters with deer on the highway. Last thing I need is to start the trip off with a smashed rental..."
3683018,JDP,2015-03-23 15:53:00,1457,Falls Motel very reasonable in price.Located on HWY 53 as you drive in to town.http://www.fallsmotel.org/
3683026,camp chef,2015-03-23 15:53:00,915,Try the Thunderbird Lodge. Great food and bar on the water. Lots of rooms. We have stayed there many times on the way up.
3683362,Pooch,2015-03-23 17:23:00,4619,Book your rooms early. During the summer most all of the motels south of the border book up early. We now try to cross and spend the night in FF.Pooch
3684034,nitroman,2015-03-23 19:47:00,368,X2 on the thunderbird. They have cabins and house. 8 of us will be in the house for our friday this year!
3684090,Aspencreek,2015-03-23 19:54:00,2911,"If you are looking for a Friday nights stay, you need to start booking NOW, or you are going to find everything booked.I still can't understand why guys drive to I Falls and stay overnight, CROSS the border on Friday night and stay in FF, if you can still get a room(s). ELIMINATE the border wait on Saturday morning, it just makes no sense to me. But while you guys are waiting in line I'm already on the water anyway."
3684122,Ndstallmann,2015-03-23 19:56:00,549,"I like to say across the border in Fort Frances, that way you get through customs and don't have that hassle first thing in the morning."
3684170,wallydave,2015-03-23 20:00:00,2151,"After a couple of years, we started crossing Friday night and staying in Fort Frances. For a bigger group, the Adventure Inn or La Place Rendez-Vous. Have a great trip."
3684474,btyreprich,2015-03-23 20:45:00,1067,"I agree that it's best to make your hotel reservations as early as possible. I will try doing this the very minute we have our trip dates set for the following year. We have stayed in hotels in Virginia and while nice, we prefer International Falls. Wider selection of hotels and closer to the border. More restaurants too. Not arguing with anyone who stays in Fort France's, but we wake up early - like 6 am - grab breakfast at McDonalds and cross the border. Our group has not experienced any long lines at the border using this approach."
3685226,Jwendt15,2015-03-24 06:19:00,72,Thanks for the advice. I ran into that issue last year with everything being booked. Fortunately the lodge we are going to this year goes Friday to Friday so it should be a little easier to find a place on a Thursday night.
