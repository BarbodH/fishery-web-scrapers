3698865,red owl,2015-03-27 09:10:00,4,"If you want to keep a walleye or two for the trip/drive home. They will be ""on ice"" the day they got caught, the day driving back, the day they get cooked for dinner; so, 2 1/2-3 days. Is there a best way to handle them? Should they be left whole and put on ice? Gutted but not filleted or skinned- put on ice? Filleted and put on ice? If filleted...put fillets flesh to flesh and leave the skin on and have the skin in contact with ice.Or....method makes no difference."
3698929,camp chef,2015-03-27 09:14:00,915,"Fillet,skin and store in cold water. they will be fine for 3 days"
3701810,youngknight,2015-03-27 21:33:00,228,I agree that frozen in water his best BkUT if you are transporting fish you need to leave a patch of skin on for species I'd and be packed so that they can easily be counted if stopped by a game warden.
3704762,lassh,2015-03-28 20:06:00,553,How do you guys on Lac Seul do it? Don't you have to kill the fish immediately if you're going to keep it?
3704850,Blades-n-Beads,2015-03-28 20:32:00,484,"Lassh, on LacSuel yes they need to be killed if you are keeping, bleed them out and keep on ice until you can fillet them and put them back on ice."
3705586,wallydave,2015-03-29 06:11:00,2151,"You are correct! For take home fish, we bring good zip lock bags, and a black sharpy to put our names and how big and what type of fish. Fillet and leave patch of skin on, filled bag with water and freeze it overnight. We stop at Dutchies on the way home for dry ice, pack the cooler well and head for home. The rules don't call for all the info on the bags, but it's my way of letting the Canadiens know I'm playing by the rules and respecting the resources. Have a great trip!"
3706026,v-bay gord,2015-03-29 08:13:00,3168,What? The NHL cares about what you caught?
3706410,last chance,2015-03-29 09:28:00,3262,we fish erie in late july or late july early aug. we fillet our fish and put them in zip lock bags and cover with ice. we drain off water and add ice as needed. we have kept fish like this for a week at a time and never had fish to go bad.
3706690,Walleye_Guru,2015-03-29 10:42:00,62,"Personally I clean all the fish at the lake. I butterfly the fillets so they can be easily counted and packaged. I'll also remove 99% of the skin from the fillet, yet leave the complete skin in place. Once they are transported and ready to cook, it's as simple flick of the knife and the skin is gone. Fish have never spoiled like this, and they keep that desirable freshness if kept cold. Below is Ontario's requirements for transporting fish... somewhat off topic but important to know since you mentioned transporting the fishing home. 1. All fish must be packaged so that they can be easily counted and identified, not just those with limits. 2. To ensure fish can be easily counted, package each fish separately, or arrange fillets spread flat in a clear freezer bag. DO NOT freeze fillets in a milk carton, margarine tub or other container. A large lump of fillets frozen together in bags is also unacceptable. 3. Since anglers often transport or store various species of fish, it's their responsibility to ensure every fillet of their catch can be easily identified. Ensure you leave at least a large patch of skin on all fish fillets for identification purposes. Some species (e.g., lake whitefish or lake herring) may require additional identifying features such as the head. 4. Conservation officers may inspect your catch at any time. Always have your fish and your licence easily accessible, and place coolers of fish where they can be easily inspected. 5. If a conservation officer inspects the sport fish you're transporting and they are improperly packaged:  your catch may be seized for evidence  you could get a ticket and be fined  you may have to attend court, usually close to where the inspection took place, which may be far from where you live."
