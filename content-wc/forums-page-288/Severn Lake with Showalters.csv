3702482,GMANNN,2015-03-28 07:52:00,8,We have been doing fly-ins with Eddie and his family for the last 10 years. Our primary lake is Carroll. This year we are going to mix it up and go to Severn. I am looking for someone familiar with the lake that would be willing to help me mark up a map of spots to fish. I know Eddie will give us some however we like to mark up maps for each boat and laminate them before each trip. Please private message me and I will send you my email/contact info. Thanks!

Theres an outlet thats too risky (waterfall, rocks, current) to take to get from Donald to Carroll. Carroll looks big! Can you take Carroll to the Manitoba border? Are there narrows, inlets/outlets that you can take to get to Manitoba? Have you seen all of Carroll or are there areas you have yet to discover?It took 4-5 yrs to really get in and out of all the inlets/outlets Donald has to offer. I can say I've now seen the whole lake and there isn't anywhere within Donald i haven't laid eyes on or fished.Happy fishing!!"
