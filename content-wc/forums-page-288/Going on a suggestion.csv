This year with a suggestion that we fish LOTW's, I ventured back to the All-Canada show this year. Talked with an outfitter and signed up to visit his place. Tamarack Island Wilderness lodge, just west of Morson Canada in LOTW's. Just could use some advice. Big water, but also a trip of a lifetime for my boys."

This year we are moving to the Big narrows/Northwest angle area. Lots of water and lots of choices. We are going up the following week after you are. Be glad to share any tips for fishing the lake.....At that time, we usually are fishing mid-lake humps for walleye, rocky shores for SM and Muskie and Pike will be turning on as Muskie season opens around then.
