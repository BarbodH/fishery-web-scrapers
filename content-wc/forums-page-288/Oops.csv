3701242,kzoofisher,2015-03-27 18:22:00,5144,"Thanks for the answers, serious and otherwise. They're all good. I really like the sat phone idea. If I can get her to answer an unknown number she'll be very pleased. I'll have to enlist my other son as an accomplice. She really isn't very bothered by the trip at this point, my madness has been obvious for many many years and it pleases her that her son shares that madness. The fact that he is named for her grandfather and that she has very fond memories of fishing with Opa doesn't hurt either."
3698609,LOW1,2015-03-27 08:15:00,2828,"You are overanalyzing the situation. No matter what you do you are screwed. So the question becomes whether you should spend your time, creativity, money and emotions by coming up with a substitute. The problem is that the substitute will always be inadequate, regardless of what it is. And you will hear about it forever, or until you commit a greater transgression, whichever comes first. So go to Canada. Don't do anything else."
3698825,HeHooksHimself,2015-03-27 09:03:00,725,"you could tell her you arranged this trip especially for her and tell her she is going along. When she refuses, tell her that you are sorry you missed the mark and will make it up to her upon her return but now that you have invested in it you can't go back without a great financial loss. She might still tell you to take your ""ball shirt"" but you can play the victim....JMHO If she decides to go, wouldn't that be great! i would love to have my drop dead gorgeous wife that i took to the prom 45 years ago to go. Heck, I would love to clean fish and then return to have my dinner ready and edible!"
3699178,last chance,2015-03-27 09:58:00,3262,im sure she wouldn't want to spoil the trip with your son even on her 50th birthday.(I know my wife loves it when I do things with my sons). just do the nice things you mentioned and take her out some place special just the 2 of you. just my opinion.
3699458,MrSimon,2015-03-27 10:51:00,922,"I agree with this. Birthday's are special, but in my book not as special as trips to Canada with family. She'll understand."
3699482,Golden Eagle,2015-03-27 10:53:00,2642,"have you considered having your wife join you and your son? July 2014, I sniffed out a possible surprise 80th birthday party for me and escaped all that by taking my wife along for a week of fishing Little Vermilion Lake, a short flight past Red Lake. We had our best ever summer walleye fishing and I've done a bunch of them. Huge pike were hanging around walleyes and plenty of them volunteered to eat our lures. It was one of my best fishing trips to NW Ontario."
3700178,Coyoteman,2015-03-27 13:36:00,209,"That makes me laugh. I caught wind of a surprise 40th for me so on the Thursday before my Monday birthday I headed un announced to Wyoming for a weekend snowmobiling trip with the guys. We do that a lot when a storm hits out there. What I didn't know was they were in cahoots with her and foiled my plan. She had it all set up for the following weekend, knowing my stunts, and they never let me know. So to the OP throw her a party before you leave. Have flowers or something delivered to her on her birthday with a very very nice card."
3700346,Bakefish,2015-03-27 14:12:00,1077,"I did the same thing many years ago, forgot about her birthday when I made reservations. Arranged for flowers to be sent to her work. She forgave me. I never once considered cancelling and she never once considered asking me to cancel. However, now I am definitely aware of her birthday when making reservations. May 30th, really a crappy time for a birthday if you ask me."
3700370,Aspencreek,2015-03-27 14:22:00,2911,"Just a thought........she reminded you of her birthday, I'll bet this is NOT the first time that this has happened. So that being the case, some preplanning on your part goes a LOOOONG way. A nice dinner out before you go, flowers at her workplace makes her feel special in front of all of the co-workers, and a special gift, (read jewelry here), before and of course a NICER gift when you get back (NICER means, not a T-shirt or sweatshirt, but something from the area, wool blanket, craft, handmade item etc.) I started getting necklaces made from turquois, amber, other stones a few yrs ago, not that expensive, but jewelry, and unique to only her!I remind my wife that as you turn 50 and beyond, birthdays are not celebrated anymore, they are mourned. It is received with the typical looks, but you know your wife better than anyone, just a suggestion. For me, making arrangements for a Canada trip is hard enough, changing them at this point, all you are going to do is add the element of resentment."
3700386,RCDuck,2015-03-27 14:24:00,18,"I'm in a similar postion.... I'll have 2 of my kids on a fly-in in Ontario on my 20th wedding anniversary... I think I have it worked out ok.... my wife will have the other kids at the beach, and she thoughtfully/accidently lost the diamond out of her wedding ring the other day, giving me opportunity to replace it for a 20th anniversary gift."
3700658,Draco1206,2015-03-27 15:25:00,175,"I was thinking something along the same line. Postponing the trip would be out of the question and it might be time to trade in the 50 year old for two 25 year olds . On a more serious note (although I was serious about not canceling the trip). My wife's birthday almost always falls on the week we are on our fly-in trip the last week in May. It has not been a real big deal with us but only you know how your wife may react or what consequences you may face when you return. To make matters worse, my son (who goes on our trip with us) got married a few years ago on the same date as my wife's birthday, so we had to cancel our already scheduled trip that year. Just last year, my nephew( who also goes with us) had a baby girl on the same date, so he had to cancel his trip, though we carried on and took lots of pictures for him. And to top it off his sister, my niece was born on the same day. Needless to say this is starting to get out of hand and it looks like we may need to move the date a week later or so to avoid some wifely friction. One other thing I agree with another poster said is to rent a sat phone so you and your son can call home and wish her a happy birthday. I surprised my wife a few years ago when we were at Eddies Beteau Lake and he had a sat phone we were able to use. I think it will go a long way to easing those consequences on your return. If that fails there still is the two 25 year olds."
3696186,kzoofisher,2015-03-26 18:35:00,5144,"Yesterday my wife pointed out to me, surprisingly nicely, that this year I will be enjoying the beauty and wonders of Canada on her 50th birthday. I will have with me our youngest son and absolutely no way to call her. Should I have an extravagant celebration the week before? We don't normally do that sort of thing. Should I do something very personal, sweet and touching with her and the boys before we go? Any suggestions as to what that might be are welcome. Do I arrange for flowers, presents and food to be delivered to her work? Maybe I should just resign myself to another episode I'll never live down.In my defense I am missing the opening week of Detroit River jigging to take her to New Orleans and will also miss a good chunk of night time trophy brown trout fishing while the whole family goes to Europe. I'm not a completely selfish ba------. Shameful admission, I was completely aware it was her birthday but forgot it was the five oh. I told her that it slipped my mind because she still looks like the same drop dead gorgeous 18 year old I met at the Oktoberfest thirty two years ago. This line was received with considerable skepticism and a word that I can't put in my post, but it sounded kind of like pulpit.Any suggestions for an appropriate penance will be appreciated."
3697386,adempsey,2015-03-26 23:28:00,963,"Yes to the party.Yes to the more personal family gathering.Yes to sending her flowers at her work.Also, you have no defense.or rent a satellite phone and call her."
3697785,Richard B,2015-03-27 06:02:00,735,"I went to Canada on my 5th wedding anniversary! It was on a Tuesday so I put a anniversary card in the mail Friday night when I left, sent flowers to her work on Tuesday morning, and another set of flowers to the house that got there at 5:30. Took her out to a fantastic dinner when we got back. Must not have bothered her to much, we are still married after 28 years."
3697793,turkeyriver,2015-03-27 06:02:00,80,One word--JEWELRY!!
3697945,pjshorthorn,2015-03-27 06:41:00,5654,"Yikes!!!! Just an observation.....by sending this message out for comment I think you answered all of your questions already . As an alternative, cancel your trip to Canada and take her to Hawaii. It is the only place you'll be able to refer to her as being Five-O without getting in TOO MUCH trouble. Tell the son he is going to have to take one for the team this year. Best of luck on whatever you decide to do. Hopefully you are older than her as you know what they say about paybacks PjShorthorn"
3698001,tv4fish,2015-03-27 06:45:00,2694,"Nice try - BUT, that probably wasn't the best ploy for you to try. You sure as heck know her better than any of us do. Do what you know she enjoys. 'nuff said."
3698089,SinOrSwim,2015-03-27 06:54:00,1528,"I say send her flowers and all that stuff at work and take a sat phone with you and call her. She would NOT expect that. Then, she would get a call from you and her son on her birthday."
3698425,Hot Runr Guy,2015-03-27 07:37:00,16061,"Just posed this question to Mrs HRG, she said just give her the $$$ that the satellite phone would cost,,,,,,, HRG"
3698497,ftfarms,2015-03-27 07:53:00,444,I would change the date I was going to Canada. One way or another.
3698569,Skywagon,2015-03-27 08:10:00,1106,"If it becomes so serious that you need to postpone your trip, then it might be time to trade-up to a new model."
