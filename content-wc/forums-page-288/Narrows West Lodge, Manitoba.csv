3691898,5 of Diamonds,2015-03-25 17:31:00,151,I'm in need of whatever information I can get about early season walleye fishing and Spring bear hunting @ Narrows West Lodge in Manitoba. I understand that they harvest black bear of different phases (colors). You can PM me to if you wish. Thanks for any help.
