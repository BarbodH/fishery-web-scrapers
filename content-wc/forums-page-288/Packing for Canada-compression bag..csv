3703146,Pooch,2015-03-28 11:16:00,4619,Buddy of mine did that years ago on one of our trips and it was really impressive.Problem was when we went to leave camp he had no way of vac'ing the bags back down and had more stuff in physical size than on the trip in. It was pretty entertaining for the rest of us.Pooch

3703290,Joek3,2015-03-28 12:17:00,244,Border check......good point.
3703362,Carnhzkr,2015-03-28 12:45:00,964,I think this is a great way to save on packing space. You just need to bring a shop vac along with you for the return trip. Great tip!
3703698,pwbmlr,2015-03-28 14:49:00,37,"They make compression bags that compressed by straps. I use one and it is great. You can get them from cabelas for about $25.00. This size is about the size of a sleeping bag case and I can fit all my clothing for a week in there, including rain gear and jackets. If boarder checks you worst thing you have to do is repack if. Takes about 3 mins."

They have various sizes, and they have one way valves. put the items in, close it, force the air out by laying, sitting etc. and then seal the valve. I use one every week while traveling on business, and use them for my Canada trip as well. Highly recommended. as to the border ck, again, you simply let the air out again, and seal the valve. No vacuum needed. Tx. Jig Tyr"
