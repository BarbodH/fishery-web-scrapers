Also is Land of the Loon Festival in Virginia MN, which brings in thousands of visitors to both areas. That is why it's hard to find lodging.

3670682,Baseline,2015-03-19 21:29:00,3207,"If you are looking for a room in I Falls, rooms book up on Friday nights in June because there are lots of groups traveling to Canada for Saturday check in. They stay in I-Fall so they can get an early start before the line at the border gets too long -- can get 2-3 hours long. Rainy Lake is also going strong with smallmouth and walleye. Lots of Rainy fisherman stay in I-Falls."
