512911,Guest,2001-06-05 19:32:00,0,IF I HAD ONE LURE TO BRING TO CANADA THATS IT.
512912,Atlanta Dave,2001-06-06 16:37:00,323,"The 11/8 silverminnow with trailer tail has produced for me in Canada but I have had more success with the daredevil 1 oz lure the past 2 years and have caught pike up to 23lbs with them.We go the 14th of june so the weeds are not a problem as they havent reached the surface yet. Also you can't get too much further south than Atlanta and I find all the northern tackle I need at Bass pro or from Cabelas. Good luck in Canada. Atlanta Dave <"")))))))><"
512913,ET,2001-06-08 15:39:00,120,If you use a Leader get a premium Leader with a Ball Bearing Swivel. Also the Large Silver Minnow Hooks are extremely Dull. Often the chrome plating is on the Hookpoint Sharpen these UP!! ALso You can use Paint Pens or a Marker to Draw some Eyes or customize your Silver Minnow. It will make your fishin partner crazy if you outproduce him. Nice thing about these Lures is a Single Hook Makes for a Safer Release.

512915,Guest,2001-06-10 04:55:00,0,"Have I been living in the dark ages?? What is a ""Johnson Silver Minnow""? Is it a spoon? If not, where can you get them."

512900,Guest,2001-05-31 05:23:00,0,"I have been watching the posts, and nobody ever seems to mention the silver minnow as a good lure. I live in the south and the other spoon lures you guys always mention, just arent available here. Is the silver minnow a bad lure for pike? It comes in a variety of colors. Let me know what you think. And thanks.Chris"
512901,Hawgman,2001-05-31 05:55:00,18,"The Johnson Siver Minnow is an great lure for pike, especially when a large white or yellow twister tail is added."
512902,duffy,2001-05-31 07:19:00,49,The Johson silver minnow is awesome for pike especially in heavy canadian cabbage. It will not get snagged in the weeds. In addition to tipping it with a 3 inch power grug also put on a walleye gullet if it's legal in the waters you fish.
512903,Guest,2001-05-31 09:17:00,0,or put an Uncle Josh bass strip or ripple rind on there for a tail - last all day and even then you will have to cut it off.lobo
512904,Guest,2001-05-31 13:17:00,0,"My absolute favorite lure for pike!!!! The bass strip is a must. It makes the lure appear bigger to the pike and the action it delivers is irresistable to the toothy critters. One thing I must mention, however: an erratic retrieve produces more strikes but the pike will often swallow the lure while it has stopped and is falling. Therefore, I pinch the barb to reduce damage to the fish when removing the lure from what is often deep in the pike's throat. Keep a tight line and a proper drag setting and you should have no problem landing the fish. Another tip is to use an 8"" South Bend thin wire leader, as it allows for the lure to respond better upon retrieve. Lure color doesn't seem to be extremely critical. I'll use silver in clear water and gold in murky conditions, both with a yellow bass or musky strip. In Canada there's a lot of fallen timber on the shoreline and the Johnson slithers smoothly over cover which would normally hang up the slab spoons with treble hooks. One last thing: When it comes to a Johnson, size matters. 3/4 oz and 1/2oz are your best all 'round weapons. The Cabela's knockoffs are just as good as the original and they're cheaper but, if you buy the ones with painted finishes it will flake off sooner than the originals. Go get 'em."
512906,Guest,2001-05-31 16:42:00,0,"Spoons are great on northern. Bring your BIG flipin stick spooled with heavy line. I prefer the braded lines when fishing fer toothy critters with a steel leader. Usually get 1 - 1 1/2 ozspoons up there. Big spoons seem to get BIG fish. Have caught many over 40"" using bigger spoons with the biggest being 46"". Red eye wigglers are another good bet as well as some of the knock offs. I get a 1 eye spoon from a bait shop up there that works like a champ.Another great bait is Rattle Traps (3/4-1oz). Bright colors work best on the lake I fish. Those critters will kill a Trap! They are great for ripping through the cabbage too. Use a steel leader cause they will engulf em. Set the hook and hang on!Good luckP.S. A extra long needle nose pair of pliers are great for removing those hooks from them northerns."
512905,Guest,2001-05-31 17:10:00,0,I couldn't agree more. If I had just one lure to take with me it would be the Johnson Minnow. I prefer the silver 3/4 oz although I never tried the gold. If you want to to try another lure for Pike the #5 Mepps(or similar spinners) are very productive.
512908,Guest,2001-05-31 18:23:00,0,"Thanks for all the help. I must have just not seen any previous posts. I am heading to Canada the first week of July. I have been collecting up some tackle, i guess the silver minnows will be worth adding to the box.Thanks again,Chris"
512907,Guest,2001-05-31 18:27:00,0,"I don't know about the JSM in the smaller sizes, we strictly use the 1 1/8 oz size. If I had to pick one, of course, it would be silver but my fire tigers and red and white have really produced as well. Main thing is to hang something off the back - gullet, scented twister, pork rind etc (make it a big bait !).Most people say to spread the gap on the hook for better hook-ups.... be careful !! Some of those hooks just don't want to bend. Take it from me and back off on the pressure if the hook is not bending - or else..... I snapped the hook off a brand new 1 1/8 silver a couple days ago. I never have had problems with hook ups anyways - straight out of the box.lobo"
512909,duffy,2001-06-01 14:29:00,49,Make sure you sharpen the hook. They are very dull out of the package. good luck
