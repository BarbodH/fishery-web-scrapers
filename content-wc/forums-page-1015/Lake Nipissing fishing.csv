Mostly fished near Pickerel rock, and the Hardwoods; we got enough for a couple of Walleye meals (plus one or two to take home). For the five days, we kept (36) or so under the slot (smaller than 15.7in.) and I kept one over the slot (bigger than 23.6in.) ... released everything else. If interested, pictures are posted on our personal website at: www3.sympatico.ca/jchars/camp95.htmlWould be interested in hearing from others who fish the North West areas of Lake Nipissing (post or email me). thanks.P.S. we had some decent pike action, but nothing over 30"". Saw lots of good perch caught by others, concentrating on the 'high percentage areas for Perch ... like Big Baldy."
