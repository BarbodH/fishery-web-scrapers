513058,darcyfish,2001-06-06 04:34:00,15,"Regina bay itself is a small area and not alot of shallow areas for spring fish, you may want to try lobstick bay which is east of regina, it has bass,northern in it and more shallow water, also whitefish bay is very close to regina bay it has every thing in it, all youi need is a good navigation map and I'm sure you can ask around when you get their(tackle shops are you best bet for info)as people in the area are always helpful,good luck, I'm heading up on the 15th for musky opener."
513059,Guest,2001-06-06 11:47:00,0,We are going to Tomahawk in Regina Bay for the 1st time although I have fished it before. You didn't mention walleyes. Any spots in Regina or Lobstick that you know of? Thanks
513060,darcyfish,2001-06-06 12:49:00,15,"I have caught walleyes on occasion in regina bay but not on a consistant basis, usually the mouth to reed narrows has some, the dam area by the reserve, i do most of my walleye fishing up the lake towards yellowgirl and westard of there. Longbay does hold walleyes in early season in black river, berry creek.What time of year are you going i may be able to give you a more specific answer?"

513061,Guest,2001-06-07 05:27:00,0,We will be going up the last week of June. I have fished for walleyes a lot in yellowgirl and some in white fish but never in regina. We usually look for humps or reefs at a particular depth depending on the time of year for the walleyes. Thanks for the help.
