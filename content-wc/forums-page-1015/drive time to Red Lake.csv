512570,Guest,2001-05-25 06:47:00,0,"71 is great. Instead of staying in Dryden, we stay in Vermillion Bay. Better food. good motel. Drive time is about the same."
512567,Guest,2001-05-26 09:44:00,0,Just returned from Red Lake. Used 71 up to 17 then east toRed Lake Road. Hear there is a lot road construction on502. Chimo Lodge was our charter service to Rodrick Lake.Great facilities. Walleye action was great.
512578,duffy,2001-06-04 11:58:00,49,"Hop,I spoke to Kevin last night and he said that they are up to 350 northerns over 15lbs so far. The walleye bite has been very good but Sportsmans does not have to many big eyes. Lot's of eaters. Perfect place: catch lunch in the morning fish for gators all afternoon. I mentioned to Kevin that you would bring him a rain jacket and he said don't bother if it rains he's staying inside. LOL. Good luck and let me know how you do.Duffyp.s. Make Kevin cook shore lunch everyday. He loves to do it......NOT!"
512579,HOP,2001-06-10 19:16:00,48,"Thanks for the update! I'm on the countdown now. Sounds like the perfect lake to me also. Catch a few to eat for lunch and cast all day for big fish. I'm glad to hear he likes to cook shore lunchs sooo much. Father-in-law likes his unbreaded, brother-in-law will have it breaded regular and I'll go for the dry pan blackened. I'll make sure to bring my water-proof matches too, because we make shore lunches even in the rain.HOP"
512568,Guest,2001-05-15 11:16:00,0,"I go to Weavers, on Gull Rock. It takes me 5 hours(1 stop) and I am now taking Highway 71, not 502. I do drive fairly fast on the way home."
512571,HOP,2001-05-15 17:29:00,48,"Thanks for all of the info guys. I truly appreciate it.Duffy, I arrive at sportsman's on June 16th and last I knew Kevin's brother confirmed he would be there and he is slated to guide us for the first half of the week. I'll definitly pass your message on for you as I know my rain gear is ready!Thanks again,HOPP.S. I have always gone up to Canada in the LATE summer. What should I expect for weather in mid June, and how are the bugs?"
512565,Guest,2001-05-15 18:09:00,0,"Duffy, Please don't catch all the bif ones. We come in right behind you in fact we will probably be on the plane first thing in the morning that you will take out later that day.Do you know what the deal is about the portage for lemonade lake?How about setting net flight schedule?TRW"

That was very rare but it can be cold that time of year. Bring layers of clothing and a good rain suit for you and Kevin (can't resist). Good luck."
512566,duffy,2001-05-16 03:14:00,49,"Hooiser,Good to see you are going back. I didn't know that you were going. I spoke to Bob yesterday and he assured me that the plane will be in camp at all times to make the flight a bit more accessible. He also said that they cut a deal with the natives to keep way north boats on setting net and they moved one of them over this winter. No more carrying motors!!! I plan to fish Setting net at least twice and maybe three times this year. I did not speak to him regarding the Lemonade portage. I assume it will be much the same as last year."
512573,Guest,2001-05-18 04:59:00,0,"HOP,I will be going to Sportsman's Lodge June 2nd. I will definately let you know how we do as soon as we get back. Can you tell me when Kevin Geary is going to be there. I would love to try to get him to guide us. Have you guys ever fished the 1st week of June at Sportsman's Lodge? If so, where did you fish and what did you use. We are taking up a lot of salted suckers. I've heard they work very well on the pike.Adam"
512574,duffy,2001-05-18 06:56:00,49,AdamKevin is the camp manager now at sportsmans lodge. He will be there pretty much full time. He called last night to tell me that the first group of the year this week caught over 100 pike over 15lbs. If you e-mail me I can give you his phone number and you can call him. Good luck and please post a trip report when you get back.Duffy
512575,HOP,2001-05-18 20:41:00,48,"I'll definitly take some of that pike action mentioned above. I'm looking for that 48""er this year, plus some good walleye.Adam, I've never been to Sportsman's before and I've not bben to Canada this early in the year so I would take Duffy up on the number and give Kevin a call. I would give it to you but my brother-in-law is the keeper of the info and i do not have it with me at this time. Please give a report upon your return.Safe travel to all of those going up north this year,HOP"
512576,Guest,2001-05-22 11:56:00,0,"Duffy,When did Kevin start running Sportsman's Lodge? We were there back in 1997, and at that time Brett was running the Lodge but wasn't there that much.Do you also know where we might be able to get a lake map showing the depths of Little Vermilion? In 1997 all they gave you was an outline of the lake. I don't know if that's changed at all.Our plan of attack for the first week in June is to fish the mouth of the Rathouse River where it flows into Little Vermilion with jigs and salted suckers. We also might go to the two small lakes (can't remember their names) and fish the points of bays and islands.I will give you all the details when I get back.Adam"

I think Kevin is running the place becasue Brett can't always be in camp. I look forward to hearing from you when you bet back. Good luck.Duffy"
512555,HOP,2001-05-14 19:54:00,48,"Driving up to Red Lake soon and was wondering how long (hours) of a drive is it from International Falls/Fort Francis.Thanks,HOP"
512556,Guest,2001-05-15 03:22:00,0,takes us 8-9 hours dont let anyone talk you into taking the short cut unless you have extra time very pretty scenery but winding road
512558,Guest,2001-05-15 04:41:00,0,It takes us about 5 1/2 to 6 hours but the wait to get across International Falls maybe a hour or two
512560,Guest,2001-05-15 06:29:00,0,8-9 hours the short cuts not the best way to go in my opinion too curvy and winding just my opinion who are you using as an outfitter??
512561,HOP,2001-05-15 09:23:00,48,Going to sportsman's lodge on Little Vermillion. Looking forward to fishing with Kevin Geary for a few days.HOP
512557,HOP,2001-05-15 09:26:00,48,What is the shortcut? 502? I've been reading the other post on it and it looks like I'll probably avoid it on the way up as I am driving through the night.HOP
512562,duffy,2001-05-15 09:37:00,49,"Hop,I am good friends with Kevin. He is an awesome pike fisherman if you can convince him to guide you on that lake. I have heard mixed reviews about little vermillion but if Kevin guides you many a big pike will be caught. He grew up on that lake and knows it like the back of his hand. I am going to Kevin's old camp Way North Lodge becasue the fishing for big northerns has been great to me. Kevin has been trying to convince me to try sportsmans ever since he sold way north but I do not like that they keep trophy pike. I am a CPR guy. Well let us know how you do when you get back. If Kevin agrees to guide you make sure it's not raining because he will not fish in the rain. He is such a wimp. Tell him I said hello. Good luck.Sean Dyer"
512559,HOP,2001-05-15 10:12:00,48,"As a native of Indiana and an IU grad I have to inquire about your name. Plus, when you speak of your drive time are you using the infamous 502?HOP"
512563,HOP,2001-05-15 10:15:00,48,We are there for a week and booked Kevin for the first 3 days. If we don't know our way around after that we never will. Looking forward to learning a lot from him.HOP
512564,duffy,2001-05-15 11:10:00,49,"Hop,When are you going? I will be flying out to way north from red lake on June 8th for a week. Definately confirm with Kevin that he will be there and FORCE HIM TO FISH IN THE RAIN IF IT'S RAINING. LOL.Duffy"
