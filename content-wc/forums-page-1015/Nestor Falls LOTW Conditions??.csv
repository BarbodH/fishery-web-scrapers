513132,Guest,2001-06-09 19:30:00,0,WE JUST ARRIVED HOME FROM NESTER FALLS ABOUT 5:00 THIS AFTERNOON.WE SPENT A SUPER WEEK THERE AND DID REAL WELL ON WALLEYES.EVEN THO OR MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE HIGH WATER THE WALLEYES WERE ON THE REEFS AND NOT IN THE SAND BAYS OR IN THE WEEDS. CAUGHT LOTS OF FISH BUT NOT MANY LARGE OR SMALL ONES. MOST OF OUR WALLEYES RAN FROM 16 TO 19 IN. THE PIKE WERE FAIRLY ACTIVE AS WE CAUGHT THEM UP TO 37 INCHES WHILE RIGGING FOR EYES. LEECHES SEEMED TO BE THE THE HOTTEST BAIT EITHER WITH A JIG OR ON A LINDY RIG. PERHAPS AS THE WEEDS START TO SHOW THE EYES WILL MOVE IN AND GO ON A CRAWLER AND SPINNER BITE. GOOD LUCK & HOPE THIS HELPS CROSS SOME EYES DICK
