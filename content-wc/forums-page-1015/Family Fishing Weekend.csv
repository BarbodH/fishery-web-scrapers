For these two days, Manitobans and visitors to the province can enjoy our great fishery resources without having to buy a licence. All other angling rergulations apply.This has been an annual event since 1992 and the intent has been to encourage those who do not fish or those who seldom fish, to give angling a try. In addition, there is free entry to all Provincial Parks this weekend in support of the event.So this is the chance to introduce your friend or neighbour to this great family activity. If you are visiting - welcome to Friendly Manitoba. If you live in Manitoba, get out and enjoy your wealth of fishing.Be safe and have a great wekend.Carl WallAngling Program Manager"
