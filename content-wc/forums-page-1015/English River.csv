If you have white buzz baits, use them on the East side of Unexpected (left after you come thru the river into the lake) cast them right over the weed beds lots of big northerns we had a blast with them.Tell Steve and the crew Sharon says Hi.have fun and let me know how you did.Sharon[email protected]"
