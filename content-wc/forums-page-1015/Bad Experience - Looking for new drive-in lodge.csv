513029,Ketchenanny,2001-06-05 09:50:00,38,Just returned from Kaby Lodge and due to EXTRA bad service we have decided that it is time for a change. We have also decided that we no longer want to fly in. Looking for recommemdations on a drive-in lodge within 3 to 4 hours drive time from Sault Ste Marie in any direction. Will be driving from the Detroit area.
513030,Guest,2001-06-05 10:31:00,0,"Katch, what happened that you are not going back? I know there are a couple of other camps on that lake, one was bought by some guy from Columbus, recently. Other than the camp, how was the lake for fishing? I was checking out this lake a couple of yrs ago but have never gone there. You might want to look up Prairie Bee Camp/ Lake on the internet. It is a ""boat-in"" about an hour east of Wawa. Just a thouhgt! Good Luck"
513031,Atlanta Dave,2001-06-05 10:51:00,323,We fish a Lake Kippewa in Quebec. Have been there on and off for 20 years. I didn't go this year but the four guys who did had a reasonable year of walley fishing. Great accomadations. Call George Trudel summer 819-627-9858. Part of our group lives in Port Huron I think its about 10 hours of driving for them..Look on map northeast of the city of North Bay Just over the border into Quebec. Good luck and good fishing
513032,Brian,2001-06-05 13:24:00,140,"Kecthenanny,I would also like to hear why your trip was not up to expectations. We'll be flying into Kaby in a couple of weeks and would be interested in if the fishing was that slow, or was it the service at the lodge. If you have any advice on locations, lures, etc., it would be of great help. ThanksBrian"
513033,Ketchenanny,2001-06-06 05:27:00,38,"The fishing was great, probably the best in the eight years we were going there. Kaby has a new manager this year. Cathy who was the manager is no longer working for the family (that alone tells you something). Do not depend on flying in or out at your scheduled time. They now run a flying service that will pick you up and fly you in from anywhere. The day we were scheduled to fly in, we were scheduled and promised the first flight in at 7:00 a.m. as were three other groups. Because the plane was down in Michigan picking up a group, we did not get into Kaby untill late afternoon, losing all most a day of fishing but we had to pay for a full day. The hired staff are not happy with the new manager which reflected in the service. Don't be late for dinner, they no longer put out enough soup or appitisers, once they are gone, no refills. One execelent guide quit while we were there and rumor has it about four or five more of the staff are ready to quit. DO NOT UNDER ANY REASON GIVE YOUR TIPS TO THE MANAGER TO GIVE TO THE STAFF - IF THE STAFF DOES SEE IT - THEY WILL GET CANADIAN DOLLARS EVEN IF YOU GAVE U.S. DOLLARS - GIVE YOUR TIPS DIRECTLY TO THE STAFF. The quide that quit was not given his tip money that was owed to him and the manager even charged him to fly out. Because of bad weather groups were delaied a couple of days in getting out. Because you had to stay extra days they charged different groups different amounts for the extra days. One group was charged nothing, another group sixty dollars and yet another group sixty-seven dollars per person per day. The boat we had leaked a lot and the motor was very slow and they didn't have extras. Your boat and motor is inspected every day and you are required to pay for all damage - even if the prop is bent. They do tell you that all of the rocks that were marked in previous years may not be marked this year. THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR HAS REPLACED THE FINE SERVICE WE HAD IN THE PAST.Hot spots this year. The weed bed just down from the lunch site at drillers point in boot bay was by far the best for large fish with no dink's. My son and i caught over one hundred walleys one day alone. Orange and yellow 1/4 jig with just a minnow, don't use any plastic tails. Stay shallow near the weeds and or rocks.Beaver bay, rocks at end of alligator alley, Joe's island and Gil's island in Schist bay were all good but try Boot Bay weed beds first."
513034,Brian,2001-06-06 10:45:00,140,"Ketchenanny,Thanks for the clarification. You had me worried there for a while. We've never been to Kaby, but most reports are all positive on the quality and quantity of the walleye (and the pike) in Kaby. Actually, we could not get into Pine Portage, so we will be at Everson's. Perhaps in hindsite, that may not be such a bad thing. We hear that the weather has been unusually cool so far this spring. Hopefully that bodes well for the bug season. Anyway, thank you very much for the update and the advice----much appreciated.Brian"
513035,Ketchenanny,2001-06-06 11:35:00,38,"The weather was brutal, out of five days only one was warm. Had heavy frost a couple of days and even some snow.If you are staying at Everson's follow the shoreline west around Windy Point till you come to a large rock with a dirt road and a boat dock. Drift or troll from the dock back to just past the point. We picked you some nice size walleye and pike using the jig setup mentioned before. Try the N/E point of Birch Island around the rock and also off the rock pile by the Hiawatha Gold Mine. But for good numbers and size, Boot Bay, Joe's and Gil's island all the way to the top of Schist bay are your best bet.Good luck, remember, stay shallow.Post or e-mail your results when you get back.Ketchenanny"
513037,Guest,2001-06-06 11:52:00,0,"Try Lake Wabintongushi in late-June. Check it out on the web; either of these camps are good...you won't go wrong. Try www.camplochalsh.com OR www.lochisland.com. From Detroit, go up throught the Soo, north to Wawa on Hwy. 17. East on Rt. 101, then North on Rt. 651 to Missinnabie. You train in from there...about a 20 minute train ride to get to Camp Lochalsh. Loch Island Lodge permits you to drive in a a logging road with may better suit your needs.Hope this helps!!!"
513038,Guest,2001-06-06 13:50:00,0,My company represents over 120 outfitters throughtout the world including a great outfitter near Wawa that is not a fly in. Great lake. Great service. Great lodge.amail at [email protected] if you would like more info on this outfitter.Rich
513036,Brian,2001-06-08 03:27:00,140,"Ketch,Again, thanks so much for the info. We have a portable depth finder so we will definitely keep any eye on depth and take your advice to stay shallow. Hopefully, the weather will warm a bit in the next couple of weeks. I'll post our results probably in first week of July....keep fishin....Brian"
