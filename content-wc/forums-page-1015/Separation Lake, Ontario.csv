513148,Guest,2001-06-10 17:40:00,0,"pikelady, you're probably aware already that separation is part of the english river system. as such, it's really a flowage with slowing moving current throughout the system. i've fished adjoining lakes to separation the last few years and have had pretty good trips. with the cool late spring we've had, i'm not sure what pattern will be in place when you're up there next week. but generally speaking, if the water warmed up enough, then look for distinct current areas (narrows, falls, inlets, etc.) and you'll find walleyes concentrated there. throw your standard fare of walleye presentations (1/4 ounce jigs dressed with plastic and/or live bait, cranks, lindy with bait) and you'll catch your share. if the water is still cool, say below the low 60's, then i'd suggest trolling with spinner rigs or a bottom walker with a rapala following spring structure & depth (8-16' of water along points, sand bars, etc). hope you have a great trip. and please post a report afterwards as i'll be heading up there myself couple of weeks after you."
