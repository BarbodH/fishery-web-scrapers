512773,All Eyes,2001-06-03 17:19:00,43,Just bringing this back to the top.Anyone been up there yet?
512774,hoghunter,2001-06-04 04:23:00,159,"Hey Eyes, cya in Kilvert. Can't wait. I feel a ""wallhanger"" coming on."
512775,All Eyes,2001-06-04 19:00:00,43,See ya there. We are staying out on the island this year. I'll be calling Wayne tomorrow to find out if I need to bring anything special out there and asking how the action has been. What kind of boat will you be in? I've got a Lund Angler with a Yamaha 80hp 4-stroke on it.
512776,hoghunter,2001-06-05 03:37:00,159,"Hey Eyes. I have a 14ft, green crestliner angler with a 25 yamaha on it. I will be in Kilvert most of the time. We are staying at Luther Village, and will fish Lunker Bay towards evening for eaters. Will be looking for ya. Good Luck."
512777,All Eyes,2001-06-06 04:43:00,43,"I'll watch for you out there. We picked up some fish in Echo Bay last year. Which bays do you fish in Kilvert? If you want, send me an e-mail at [email protected] and I can give you more specifics."
512778,Guest,2001-06-08 12:06:00,0,"I,m headed up june 22nd. The ice was out around early may. I've heard from buddies that a 14# was pulled out last weekend which would have been june 2. I'm not all that familiar with the lake but they said south end. Which is weird you'd think they would be north, because it would warm faster but that not the case. That is The same pattern as May long, we found them in the south end of the lake. Different lake,same general area."
512779,Guest,2001-06-08 12:16:00,0,"I,m headed up June 22nd. The word is quite good on DOG. 14#caught last weekend in the south side. I'm not that familiar with lake so I hope that helps. But it sounds like the same pattern as may long. Usually you would think the north side, it warms up faster,but not so. May long we were in the Whiteshell, and the pattern was transitional spots just off spawning grounds in about 6-10 feet. Now they probably are moving to pre summer spots depending on temp. Although it was a different lake it was still a canadian shield lake(rocky). Good luck !!!!Please let me know how you guy's did.And maybe a few hot spots"
512780,hoghunter,2001-06-09 06:10:00,159,"Heading up tomorrow, Sunday. I think it will be good fishing, as the weather has seemed to stabilize. Will post when I return.....Adios."
512763,All Eyes,2001-05-25 10:22:00,43,Any reports on Dogtooth yet? I am headed there in two weeks. I had the resort send me a lake map and am trying to locate some spots where they may be hitting. Any tips would be appreciated. Thanks!
512764,hoghunter,2001-05-26 01:23:00,159,"[font size=""1"" color=""#FF0000""]LAST EDITED ON May-26-01 AT 03:26AM (CST)[/font][p] I would imagine that Jackfish bay would hold some fish at that time of year. Also, don't be afraid to go into Kilvert, great fishing in there as well. Talk with Wayne when you get up there, and I'm sure he can guide you in the right direction. I'm going up on June 10th. Would apreciate any info on how your trip went. I wish ya luck and a safe trip........."
512765,Guest,2001-05-26 15:24:00,0,"Hello Hoghunter, My name is Dale...my son, older brother and I are making our first trip to Dogtooth Resort. We will be fishing there from June 2nd thru the 9th. We are avid Walleye anglers, and we are hoping for plenty of eaters for our shore lunches, but are also hoping for a few pictures of a couple of ""Hogs.""We would appreciate any help or advice on what type of tackle, color, and presentation to try. Also any recommended locations (bays, narrows, points, river mouths, ect.) With this time of the year would you use leaches, minnows, crawlers, or even crankbaits? Previously, you have mentioned Jack Fish Bay and Kilvert. We are curious how far are they away from Dogtooth Resort? Thank you for your time, DALE"
512766,All Eyes,2001-05-26 18:38:00,43,Thanks for the info Hoghunter. Sounds like we will be there at the same time. Good luck to you also.
512767,hoghunter,2001-05-27 06:59:00,159,Hey all eyes. You ever been up there before?
512768,All Eyes,2001-05-28 17:03:00,43,I was up there last year and we did catch some near Jackfish but we were there earlier in the season than this year. I got a new map as the one we got from him last year got a bit beat up with the weather and all. I am trying to be better prepared this year. Were you up there last year? How did you do?
512769,hoghunter,2001-05-29 00:30:00,159,"I've been up every year since '95. Last year we did very well. Lot of bigger eaters also, right on the verge of being in the slot. many between 5-8. Hope you do well, and play the wind."
512771,Guest,2001-05-29 03:28:00,0,"Watch out going into Kilvert- Eat's prop's _ I will be on Dogtooth June 2-9th- Staying at Dogtooth Resort. ""big Cabin"". Red & Charcoal Skeeter SF150 w/ Johnson GT 150. Stop by for a ""Blue"".Anyone know how ice out was- Late??"
