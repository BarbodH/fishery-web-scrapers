5993865,chris.brock,2018-02-09 17:20:00,112,"that's probably wise, hermaphroditic fittings, just so nobody is offended these elected people making these changes actually think they are doing stuff we elected them to do?"
5994553,Bill Krejca,2018-02-10 07:03:00,6107,"Yeah, hermaphroditic, that's the word!! Bill"
5994561,pjshorthorn,2018-02-10 07:12:00,5654,If everything else in Canada has to conform to hermaphroditic criteria at least we will still be able to buy crawlers in Canada. What is everyone's opinion; if crawlers are bought in from the US will they have to be inspected at the border for hermaphroditic compliance ? The new Canadian anthem changes have now brought our fishing bait into question too ..... PjShorthorn
6000161,Aspencreek,2018-02-13 06:52:00,2911,Wait....WHAT? The guy from GA knows about the Landing Strip?? Just happens to be about 7 miles from our cabin. Was there about 3 weeks ago just to see what the local gossip is.
6000273,Ricky Spanish,2018-02-13 07:21:00,1298,"It's about 10 miles from my house. My wife or I get a wellness check via text from the bartender or DJ if we haven't been there for a bit. I was there with my wife and a couple coworkers about 3wks ago. One of the dancers latched onto my coworker and we had to practically pry her off him when it was time to leave. On a side note, the city PJ lives in will have to change its name if the PC thing continues. I bet he still giggles when he writes down his address. I know I would."
6000625,Aspencreek,2018-02-13 08:55:00,2911,"I think I know that one, Gave her a $20 just to go away!! I feel sorry for some of those girls tho, so I support them when I can. BTW do you do much trout fishing in the area, next time I'm in the area I will send you a note and we can discuss fishing at the Landing."
6000913,Ricky Spanish,2018-02-13 10:27:00,1298,"Our hunting cabin/land is just a 40 off a portion of the Waupaca River. There are numerous bridges and parking areas within a mile or so, but I've never given trout fishing a chance. I am sure it would become my next obsession to throw all my spare time and money at. This winter, I am attempting to reclaim a portion of my youth by taking up the guitar again."
5987441,Ricky Spanish,2018-02-06 10:49:00,1298,"Naturally, it will be changing from human to hupeople. Once the hardware store begins sanitizing, plumbing and electrical terms like conduit nipples and stopcocks will have to go. Then, it will be transgender adapters because the outer threaded fitting identifies itself as an inny. Slippery slope...if that term is still allowed."
5987465,Obabikon,2018-02-06 10:58:00,2370,"And not to mention ""male"" and ""female"" adapters... how do we know how that adapter identifies?"
5987521,Bill Krejca,2018-02-06 11:19:00,6107,"Perhaps the day is coming, if not already here, when all ""fittings""for everything will be constructed with dual intakes/outtakes such that either may be used as the user identifies. There may be other additional options, which I'm afraid to even think about. Bill"
5987529,Ricky Spanish,2018-02-06 11:22:00,1298,"I apologize for the derogatory comment. I am reminded that some are offended by the word moist, so slippery must be vulgar, as well. I will seek sensitivity training after I find a safe space to regroup."
5987689,vassago,2018-02-06 13:09:00,103,"Sexism (and racism, for that matter) is so embedded in our everyday lives and it unconsciously affects our views and attitudes without us realizing. The pendulum has been swaying against these common and historic discriminatory conventions for some time now (#MeToo, #BLACKLIVESMATTER, etc etc). Will there be cases when the pendulum seems to sway too far in favour of those groups that are marginalized and descriminated against? Of course there will!! Is this a bad thing? Of course not... Speaking as a white affluent (and Canadian) male with teenage daughters, this is how I look at it : A large moving object barreling down a certain path will require a disproportionate amount of force to have any affect in changing its path. These modern forces will ultimately result is a minor shift in direction that will yield a better path in the long term. For those of us who don't live with sex discrimination and honestly dont get every nuance of the #MeToo movement should just accept it and not be afraid to engage in open and honest dialogue on matters that that are best for our society as a whole. Changing the lyrics of our anthem for our old ladies and our daughters to make them feel less excluded is a small concession in my opinion. Not like it's going to cause us to go fishing any less at the end of the day. Sent from my SM-G950W using Tapatalk"
5987905,pjshorthorn,2018-02-06 15:07:00,5654,Just go to the Landing Strip. Everything will be okay. PjShorthorn
5988177,emma17,2018-02-06 16:35:00,436,"Or maybe the large object barreling down the path is heading in the right direction, thanks in part to the fact that many men and women paid their dues, faced the obstacles, persevered and didn't spend an inordinate amount of time looking for reasons they couldn't contribute and succeed."
5988209,v-bay gord,2018-02-06 17:07:00,3168,"Canadian politics is almost like going to a spa and doing hot yoga, compared to the dung flinging cage fight going on south of the border. Very moist indeed........"

5979778,Obabikon,2018-02-02 07:10:00,2370,"I'm sure the next step will be a change to the line ""God keep our land, glorious and free"""

5980026,Shellback,2018-02-02 08:43:00,8083,"Not sure about this, ""Command"" is pretty strong language. Maybe they should have changed that too! No offense to Our Canadian friends, The US is going bonkers also!"
5980130,mrwalleye5,2018-02-02 09:14:00,1922,Big ball of crap!
5980242,castnblast,2018-02-02 09:48:00,111,Can't wait for that change to our Anthem... great to see our decision makers spending time and resourrces on the things that really matter! Zzzz...
5987337,Shellback,2018-02-06 10:08:00,8083,"Looks like the word ""Mankind"" is out now too. The Prime Minister called out a woman for using ""mankind"". It's now ""peoplekind"". I guess next on the list is to do away with hardware terms such as male and female when describing plugs and fittings. When folks hear the word ""mankind"", do they picture a world of just men? I don't think so."
