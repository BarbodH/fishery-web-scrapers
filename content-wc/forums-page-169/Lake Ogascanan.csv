We will be staying at Smith pass outpost for the week, as recommended by Ginny, who is awesome! Since this is our first trip there I was hoping to get alittle insight on where to get bait, where to stay (most likely in Temiscaming) and where we would be able to grab some last minute necessities (food). We plan on leaving Albany around 5am on a saturday and I notice alot of Bait shops close early on Saturday and are not open on Sunday. I would really like to make sure that we are able to get our bait! Anyone who has any suggestions, they would be greatly appreciated!"

Quebec - unfortunately no web site Kipawa Bait and Tackle is also a reliable bait shop in the village of Kipawa - see http://kipawabaitandtackle.com/ You can reserve bait ahead of your trip and arrange a pick up time at both locations. As for accommodations, I have always stayed at the Auberge Canadienne - see http://www.aubergecanadienne.com/ Our group stayed at Smith Pass Outpost back in 2000 when we were there. Its a great location from which to explore the lake. Enjoy"

Also bought our fishing licenses here.The IGA in Temiscaming is great. New and modern.We stayed overnight in North Bay at the Comfort Inn on Lakeshore. There's also a Metro grocery store nearby.

6004265,youngknight,2018-02-14 20:53:00,228,So what local lake did u fish in Ada....ogascanan or one of the other local lakes? And how did u do? I fished kipawa a few years back and gorgeous water and scenery but fishing extremely disappointing.
