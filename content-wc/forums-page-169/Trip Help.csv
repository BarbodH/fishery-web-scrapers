5984770,FishermanTom81,2018-02-05 10:26:00,15,I love http://www.tamarackislandwildernesslodge.com/ in the Morson area of LOTW. My favorite times for walleye are may and September(You barely have try in May and you will catch fish) but the fishing is fantastic all year.

I consistently found that the walleye fishing for this drive-to lodge surpassed that for all of my fly-in fishing trips.
