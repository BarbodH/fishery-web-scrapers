4899361,heritage2008,2016-06-04 15:34:00,92,Heading to river the 18th and have not found any detailed maps for this river. Can anyone point me in the right direction so I can have some info going for the first time. Staying at Wanikewan Lodge for a week.

It's one place that will be very hard for you to get lost. Have fun and report back. Some of the biggest muskies I've seen were in the Pickerel."
4901465,FrankLeigh,2016-06-05 12:57:00,80,"The website for the lodge has a link to Google maps, so you could print a satellite view at whatever scale you want. Alternately, you can go to www.atlas.gc.ca/toporama. This is the Government of Canada website and you can enter any location in the country, zoom in or out, and download what you want. Good luck!

5999225,heritage2008,2018-02-12 15:44:00,92,"Hey Rich, Well first time on this system 2 years ago got me to come back this year. We are staying at Pine Grove Resort in the upper Pickerel more towards Nippising--just 10 miles west of Port Loring. We are due in camp 6/30 for 7 days. The stay at Wanikewin was nice. Cabins are clean and comfortable--well the mattresses were old and at 60 well let's say I had to take some aleve for comfort. Located right on granote and we had a nice river breeze--not 1 bug bite. There are new owners that we met in Columbus--seem like nice guys. I did ask them to post what you will be charged for each vehicle at the marina where they pick you up. I think it was like $60 for my Tacoma--don't know what it would be if you bring your own boat. Boats were ok--certainly taking my 07 Lowe 165FM next time for comfort and to have a front trolling motor. Fishing--up and down--typical for walleye fishing anywhere. We caught very few throw backs. Fish the weed bed edges--right in them too. We would return but the week we wanted--1 person rented the entire camp--****. Do you fish Mosquito? If you are in Dover I'm sure you get to Atwood and Piedmont. David"
