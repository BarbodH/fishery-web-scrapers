5978658,Bill Krejca,2018-02-01 14:49:00,6107,"In the clear water of O'Sullivan Lake, last July, we observed a number of walleyes taking mayflys off the surface. it was an evening thing, happened several evenings while we were there. I didn't have a fly rod along, darn! Bill"
5978714,pjshorthorn,2018-02-01 15:32:00,5654,"Many years ago we had a fairly heavy mayfly hatch on the NE section of Lac Seul. As we caught walleye early in the trip, we found the fish to be gorged on the mayflies. An uncle on the trip had brought his fly tying supplies on the trip and one evening he tied up a numb of flies to mimic a mayfly with the materials he had on hand. We used the flies as a submerged offering vs. a floating bait and caught a number of walleye on the flies. I don't use them anymore; they are just a momento of another interesting experience on a great trip to Canada. PjShorthorn"
5978810,yoopertrout,2018-02-01 17:10:00,1172,"That must have been really cool! Not even on the same level, but I remember a night on a local trout stream when the hatch was so heavy, I finally had to give up and just watch. There were big browns rising everywhere, and when I casted, the flies were so thick on the surface of the stream, I was hooking flies with my imitation. In the river bends, there was what looked like banks of foam, several inches thick and several feet wide piled against downed trees. It turned out that they were thick piles of dead mayflies. As the duns were coming of the water, there was a flight of spinners heading upstream that was so thick the buzzing sounded like an engine. It lookes like another about 15 feet above the real river, but running upstream. I don't think I caught a single fish, but it was a sight to see."
5987345,revitup,2018-02-06 10:12:00,140,Thanks for all the stories and suggestions guys. I appreciate them and have enjoyed them. PJ I have flies like that already and sinking line and will try to come up with a few streamers as well. I will also get some of those nymphs described. Would always be interested in more suggestions if anyone has them. Thanks again and hope all have great trips this year.
5987921,walleye22,2018-02-06 15:18:00,59,have done this as i love to fly fish for trout and always bring the fly rod to canada just in case. I usually do not fly fish up there but have during may fly hatch with some success at night...not great success but enough to have fun and of course the occasional Pike on a fly rod will get the ole ticker going a bit.
5974442,revitup,2018-01-30 11:30:00,140,"I know this goes against the grain of most thoughts on this board, but the thought of catching a nice walleye on an artificial fly with a fly rod during the mayfly hatch kind of intrigues me. Does anyone out there have suggestions on the best place to get the artificial flies for this and then also any suggestions on techniques for success? Thanks revitup"
5974546,Pooch,2018-01-30 11:59:00,4618,"Look in the panfish alley of your local tackle shop.Some guys I know throw very light tan jigs when there is a hatch that they can't outrun. The other night I ran across some floating panfish ""bugs"" that I forgot I even had and the first thing I thought of was ""these might be good with a tiny split shot a foot ahead of them for walleye"". Even if there were no hatch going on.You're not the first to consider this, but I think far more mayflies are eaten long before they make it to the surface than get hit on top. The ""slurping"" we see on occasion is just a tiny bit of what might be happening under the water.Just some unproven thoughts.Pooch"
5974618,GBS,2018-01-30 12:27:00,2271,"Best you start reading up on fly fishing, since it sounds like you may not have done it much. First order is to identify the kind of mayflies in the lake you will be going to, and then the depth you will be targeting. There are a huge number of sizes and color variations, it all depends on what is hatching when you are there. Walleye, that tend to hug the bottom, are mostly feeding there, and are far less likely to be surface feeding as trout tend to do. So I'd look for flies (nymphs) that are the same size, and roughly same color as what is in the lake. Then look at methods for getting that nymph down to where the walley are. Fishing in 3 ft. is SO much easier than fishing 30 ft with fly gear. Weighted nymphs, sinking tip fly lines, even weighted lines may have to called into play. While I'm sure it can be done, I wouldn't expect it to be fast and furious. There is a lot of easily available food down there, revealing itself all at once, so the odds are less that yours will be selected. Trout tend to intercept it as the nymph is going to the surface, or at the surface, - and react to the motion - so have to make a quick decision whether to get it or not. Walleye will have a more leisurely time to eye a nymph hanging out on the bottom, before it starts its journey up. Whether that makes them more picky, or not, would be the big unknown."
5974850,Bill Krejca,2018-01-30 15:36:00,6107,"Reminds me of a LOW experience from the 1970's. I was out in the middle of a slow evening mayfly hatch and broke out my fly rod and dry flies. I caught several crappie, no walleye, but succeeded in pulling in a rather nice bullhead on a dry fly, a first and a last for me! Bill"
5974866,bfish,2018-01-30 15:43:00,1096,"Miller, Light Cahill, and Blue Dun would be 3 solid patterns."
5974938,yoopertrout,2018-01-30 16:18:00,1172,"There are all kinds of different mayfly species, from tiny to huge. At least in Northern Wisconsin, when I hear people talking about the walleye fishing being off because of a mayfly hatch, they are talking about the Hexagenia Limbata, which is the biggest mayfly, at least around here. On trout streams in N. Wisconsin, that hatch happens from midish June to early July. Probably later as you go north. When you buy ""wigglers"" to fish for perch, you are buying the nymph of the Hexagenia Limbata, also known as ""The Hex."" It used to be called ""The Michigan Caddis"" by many people, but that was confusing, because it really is a mayfly, and not a caddis fly.This mayfly in the nymphal stage (the wiggler) lives in silty bottomed lakes and streams. When the time comes each year, the nymphs swim to the surface, and the winged adult, called the ""dun"" by fly fishermen and the ""subimago"" by scientists crawls out of the nymph, leaving behind a shuck. The dun then sits on the surface until the wings become dry enough for the bug to fly off.In a day or two, another winged insect crawls out of the husk of the dun, lays its eggs on the surface of the water, and then dies. This stage is called the ""spinner"" by fly fishermen and the ""imago"" by scientists.Only the nymph can feed. The dun and spinners have no mouths.So, if you want to catch a walleye on one, you'd have the option of fishing deep with a nymph pattern, or on the surface with a dry pattern. For this particular mayfly, there usually isn't a need to use different patterns for the dun and spinner. Both are usually on the water at the same time, and one pattern will work for both. The dun pattern is easier for the fisherman to see. The emergence of the dun, and the ""spinner fall"" (dying after egg laying) usually happens after dark. On very rare occasions, during a really cold June, I've seen a few hatching during the day on trout streams.Fly fishermen on trout streams tend to find that it's hard to hit this hatch just right. Some days there will be so few flies that the trout aren't feeding on them. Some days will be great. Some days there will be so many flies that the chance of a trout hitting your fly, no matter how much it looks like the natural, are tiny. Nights with modest hatches can be best. This can mean fishing toward the beginning or end of the period of time during which they hatch on any given body of water. On trout streams, the hatch usually lasts about two weeks.Here's a place you can buy flies: https://umpqua.com/hatch/hexageniaI'd recommend the Bear's Hex Nymph and the Hex Adult, although all of them from this seller look good.I suspect walleye feed heavily on the nymph, but on the adults, not so much, just because walleyes don't feed on the surface much. On the other hand, I've heard reports of it happening. For dry fly fishing, look for rising fish and cast near them. For nymph fishing, depending on the depth, either use a sinking fly line with a short leader (3') or a floating fly line with a long leader (10'), and twitch the fly from the bottom toward the surface. Good luck, and have fun!"
5977698,revitup,2018-02-01 09:16:00,140,"Thanks to Yooper, bfish and pooch. I appreciate the help. Bill--any fish on a flyrod is a good one!"
5977858,terrapin,2018-02-01 10:00:00,353,"I was fishing in a giant mayfly hatch in Minnesota a few years back (didn't know any better). Couldn't catch a fish. I saw a ton of surface activity in the middle of a 16 foot flat. Walleyes coming up everywhere and swimming along the surface with their mouths open straining bugs off the surface. They were in such a frenzy, that they ignored me and even bumped into the boat. At one point I saw a 30+ inch fish floating dead on its side. It was the biggest walleye I had ever seen, so I figured if it didn't smell to bad, I'd grab it and pull some measurements and a picture... it turns out when you grab the tail of a bloated walleye that is sleeping (?) on the surface, they get mad and swim away real fast. To this day, it was one of the strangest things I've seen on the water. I wish I could have videotaped the whole thing, it lasted about 30 minutes.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
5977898,fishron,2018-02-01 10:10:00,317,"I believe walleye can be taken on a fly rod with a mayfly imitation. I've taken a couple on buzzbaits which to me proves at times they're aggressive enough to adopt that feeding method. A couple of years ago, I observed pike sipping mayflies from the surface on lac Hebert on shoals that were experiencing a hatch. They weren't big fish but there were quite a few feeding. Didn't have my fly rod with me but they would hit a spinnerbait just fine. I think walleye would opportunistically feed the same way, (If the pike weren't around)!!!"
5978186,Walleye Fishing Guy,2018-02-01 11:16:00,12,"Yoopertrout guy nailed it pretty good. I have caught walleye using the hex nymph he talked about while in Canada using a sinking line. Good luck if you give it a go...as an alternative, bring along some big streamers and give them a try as well...don't imitate the ""mayflies"" but you can catch some nice eyes on them as well as a chance to entice a northern."
