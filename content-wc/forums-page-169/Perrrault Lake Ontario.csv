If you go to their site, and look at their production schedule for this spring, you will see it is coming up in late February or in March."
6009081,BornToFish,2018-02-17 09:55:00,1224,"Greetings,I spoke with the Swaffords at the All Canada Show in Green Bay. They gave me a heads-up about the shows on Linder's Fishing Edge. I got the impression that there would be two such television shows - but I am not certain about this.My wife happened upon one of the shows and set the dvr to it. I watched the show later in the weekend. It sure brought back some tremendous memories! Good fishing and tight lines!!"

5977714,kettyspanky,2018-02-01 09:21:00,271,Any opinions on this lake? I'm thinking about trying it this summer and looking to see what opinions anyone has on this lake. Let me know. Thanks
5978346,BornToFish,2018-02-01 12:30:00,1224,"Greetings,You might want to conduct a search under the Canada forum for Perrault Lake, as there are many threads on this lake. Here is an example:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...lt+Lake&page=3Perrault Lake has four lodges on it: Manotak Lodge, Rainbow, Perrault Lake Camp and Rocky Shores. It is a multi-species lake with the following species: musky, northern pike, small mouth bass, walleyes and perch.I am looking into coming out with the third edition of my book that is dedicated to fishing on this lake.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

5979226,Rich B,2018-02-01 19:33:00,1081,"While you are checking out Perrault Lake, you will also want to check out ""Cedar"" lake which is connected to Perrault lake. You should do a ""search"" on WC for both Cedar lake as well as Perrault lake, and I think you'll find enough information to make an informed decision. Both can be excellent lakes for Musky, SM Bass, Pike, walleye and crappie. I have fished the Cedar lake chain a number of times, and on occasion have fished Perrault. They are not so large that you get lost or get blown off due to windy weather. Good luck with your decision for this summer. Rich B"
5979394,nitroman,2018-02-01 20:17:00,368,Perrault is a wonderful fishery. So many great areas to fish that you will never have to leave it! Cedar is dried up and virtually unproductive. Just a bunch of tiny perch and walleye down there. The Ord river off of Perrault is where the action is!
5979674,walleye22,2018-02-02 06:14:00,59,drive right on past and head up to the red lake area. Not as crowded because of the drive but worth the drive because the fishing is better. fished the lakes and the areas for 35 years....drive to the red lake area. just my opinion an thoughts is all.
5980306,billy weaver,2018-02-02 10:03:00,470,"[QUOTE=wally28;5978674]Did any of you try Wabaskang Lake while at Perrault Falls? We are going there this June. Thanks, I'll be there June 16, staying at Peffley's on the north end of Wabaskang. This will be my 31st trip to this camp. I have only fished one other lake in the area so I can't compare. I have friends that fish Perrault Lake and like it. I like Wabaskang as it is easy to fish and not a lot of hazards. There are topo maps available, not the best but would give a good idea of the lake. Most of the camp operators can mark up a map and put you on fish."
6004433,kettyspanky,2018-02-15 04:37:00,271,Thanks for the input. I called rainbow point Lodge and trying to get a week hammered out. Hopefully things work out. Thinking about going the last week of July or first or second week of August.
6004921,BornToFish,2018-02-15 07:42:00,1224,"Greetings Jeff,Congratulations to having picked a target lake and fishing lodge. You mentioned in an earlier email that you will target walleyes, perch, crappies and northern pike.You will likely find by late July through mid-August that the walleyes and northern pike will be relating to off-shore rock humps. Your key to success may very well relate to you being able to find some rock humps to fish. Thus, consider hiring a guide for the first day of your trip, and at a minimum, make some friends at the dock!The biggest northern pike in the lake will be found on or near these rock humps. They will be just above the thermocline and making a short swim to the tops of the rock humps to feed on small mouth bass and walleyes. There will still be northern pike in and around weeds, but I would be looking for the super tankers by the rock humps.The walleyes and smallies will be around the rock humps. The bass will be nearer to the top of the rock humps, while the walleyes will be underneath the bass, likely along the sides of the rock humps. You might find the walleyes in the 15 fow range in late July, but they will almost certainly be heading progressively deeper during August. I used to fish Perrault Lake quite a bit in the first two weeks of August. I would start fishing them in around 18 fow or so, but be fishing 25+ fow by the middle of August.I encourage you to look for perch in weeds, wherever you can find them. Rainy Lake (a.k.a. Spadina) and Jackfish Bay are great places to look for them, especially if the water level in the lake is high (so there is current) and/or it's a cool water year. Just keep trying the weeds until you find them. You might bump into some crappies while looking for perch.The walleye bite is the classic early morning and just before dark type of bite. We fished the 'eyes from first light to about 8:00 a.m. or so, and then resumed again about ninety minutes before dark. We fished for the other species during the middle of the day.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6005025,BornToFish,2018-02-15 07:58:00,1224,"Greetings Jeff,I thought of one more thing for you to consider. Most people traveling to NW Ontario stay overnight somewhere near the border (Orr, MN to Dryden, ON) for the evening before they arrive at their fishing lodge. It's about 175 miles, 3.5 hours from the border to Perrault Lake. Staying near the border should put you at your fishing lodge about ""check in"" time.If you want to do this, don't wait as the hotels fill up!Good fishing and tight lines!!"
