Back then for walleyes, we fished pickerel bay. Can anyone offer suggestions to areas on the lake or nearby lakes to try out for walleyes, lakers, or northerns? Any assistance will be greatly appreciated. We are headed up June 9-16."
5986945,Bill Krejca,2018-02-06 06:55:00,6107,"I used to fish Mirond Lake, which is just over the Sask. line maybe 50 miles. Good fishing, haven't been there for maybe 25 years. Going the other way, I liked Tramping Lake in Manitoba, near Snow Lake, Reed Lake, many Master Angler Awards from Tramping. Bill"

5987225,eyegator,2018-02-06 09:25:00,29,"I have fished Amisk lake a few times with T&D amisk cabins. Very much a no frills resort- but is very reasonable priced. Can catch eyes on the river right in front of the resort- or on the river that feeds into amisk on the other side of the lake. It's a large lake, with many islands-- I have explored maybe 15% of it.Big pike in that lake in many different spots- we have caught up to 49 inchers there, and usually land a few over 40 each year. Very quiet location- rarely if ever see other boats at all. Has a bit of a fly in feel to it as it's very remote."
5987241,Riley1717,2018-02-06 09:27:00,5,I have heard so much about that lake! I think we are going to stay in Manitoba this time. I appreciate the information.

5987457,Riley1717,2018-02-06 10:54:00,5,"Yes, that is where we stayed in my younger years. This summer we are basing out of Viking Lodge on the Cranberry Lake chain. Have one day booked with John the guide that works out of Bakers Narrows."
5987505,Bill Krejca,2018-02-06 11:13:00,6107,"If I'm not mistaken, the water flows from Mirond to Corneille, down river to Amisk. Amisk was a great walleye fishery many years ago, sounds like it still is, road goes over part of it, so it is fairly accessible, if I remember correctly. Bill"
5998793,Fisher-man,2018-02-12 12:44:00,422,"We used to fish Kississing back 15 years ago. The walleye were everywhere, as were the pike, but finding big fish was the challenge. Seemed like you could hit any point or island or bay and get hooked up. Lots of 15-17"" walleye and 30-35"" pike. There are a couple challenging channels getting around on the lake. Back then it didn't get a lot of pressure, not sure what it's like today."
