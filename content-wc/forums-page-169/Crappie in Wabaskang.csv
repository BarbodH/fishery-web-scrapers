5987377,prov1800,2018-02-06 10:29:00,5010,There is no shortage of walleye to be caught in cedar just o have found they move around more. Many times the crappies have moved into those spots i fish and it seems the walleyes move out.if there both in the same area it seems you will catch crappies on your jig drop.hard getting to the bottom.dont get me wrong.love eating the crappies but find them spittle boring to catch.no fight to them even bigger one really just comes up.if I have walleye guests in my boat they do lime it when we get into them but need to leave after a bit as it's none stop.i do take guests out for crappies and they think there in crappie heaven.some people tell me there crappie fishing back home is fantastic.then we get into them and now there telling me that this is way better than at home and can't believe the numbers and the size were getting.
5990593,revitup,2018-02-08 07:49:00,140,I agree with Prov's assessment. Have fished cedar for many years now and fish almost exclusively for crappie in the states. But Cedar's crappie population has significantly affected the walleye catch rate for our group. We still get our trophy walleye each year but numbers are down significantly. Since I love Cedar as a walleye lake it is very disappointing to see so many crappie being caught and yes the numbers and size of crappie at Cedar are very impressive compared to the Illinois lakes I fish
5991233,prov1800,2018-02-08 13:26:00,5010,There are plenty of walleyes still.dont get me wrong you just have to be able to catch them when there under the crappies.jard to get a bait to the bottom.try this next summer.cast as far as you can away from crappie schools then bring your bait back to boat.the walleyes are normally near bottom and you'll get them as crappies normally take bait above them.i find this gets the walleye.i hate trolling but you can get walleyes bottom bouncing underneath crappie schools.still same amount of walleyes just need diff tactics to get them in certain spots.or fish west end.no crappies there.from cedar point resort to west end very few crappies except for carter(nelson)lake.havnt seen any change there.

5976018,prov1800,2018-01-31 09:05:00,5010,About 25 mi north of vermilion bay.come on up and get some.
5976074,bthomas3333,2018-01-31 09:41:00,465,"I am a walleye first guy too so hearing that Crappies are starting to dominate certain lakes is disappointing. Here is the thing and I am not saying this is a good thing, but in N Mississippi there is a rapidly growing crappie guiding business. Folks come from all over to catch the big White Crappies. 15s are about average. 17s are about 1/20 fish and up to 21s are caught every year. Some weekends there are 20+ guide boats taking folks out to catch big crappies not including the locals. I gave it a try one March and it was pretty fun. Long 9' pools and 4 rods per person. We had our limit of 15 by about 1:00. The bag of filets weighted around 12lbs. From a pure tourism stand point you could probably make a case the crappies can yield a similar economic impact.Back on topic the guys down there were saying they could grow a 12 in crappie min keeper size in ~3 years. So literally egg to keeper in about 30-36 months. I dont have the data to support it but I would guess a keeper size walleye in NW ONT would take at least twice that long. Add in the fact Crappies are one of if not the fastest reproducers out there. I was looking at putting them in a decent size farm pond (10+ Acres) and I was told they would need to be routinely culled or I couldn't add Bass or Gill.I guess all of this together says putting them in a health NW ONT lake could probably mess up the Walleye population pretty good between their faster growth and very high reproduction rate.Anyway just my two cents. The experts up there are probably already all over this.B-"
5976082,Pooch,2018-01-31 09:45:00,4618,"^^^Ditto, Ditto, DittoI can fish for crappy down here in Illinois. When I go north I want to fish for Walleye, Pike, lake trout and yes, even smallmouth. I think Smallies are an invasive in most lakes they have populated in Canada. Bucket stocker's are responsible from what I know of history.While Crappie are a great game fish IMO they pale in comparison to a walleye.Crappie are a prolific reproduction machine and will surely decimate walleye, pike (and probably even smallmouth) fry, but that is just my uneducated thinking. Here in Illinois I don't think you can hardly over fish a healthy crappie population as they rebound so quickly.Interesting subject.Pooch"
5976106,billy weaver,2018-01-31 10:06:00,470,"The thing is, they are there, so what are you going to do about it? If they are in a flowage headed north they will continue to spread on their own. Promote crappie fishing and remove limits is an option for population control, might help."
5976402,Wall-i-Lama,2018-01-31 13:01:00,1524,"I've not read any studies/reports that indicate that crappie hurt walleye population. I'd be interested in reading it if someone could provide it. I would think that crappie are just more prey for walleye. Perhaps it is just a hassle sometimes as they get in the way of hooking up on walleye? It's interesting, I always thought that when Muskie were introduced as invasive species, they would harm the walleye population, but don't dare say that on a Muskie board. They'll tell you all day long that Muskie don't eat walleye. This is an interesting topic. I'll see what I can do this summer to cut down the crappie population in Canada"
5976450,prov1800,2018-01-31 13:40:00,5010,"I imagine thete is some s scientific data.iam not into any of that cr*p.ive fished cedar for 30 years.back in the 80,s that was a tough gig.but through the camp owners pushing for conservation and finally the mnr helped out.i saw the lake come back and I would like to see it stay that way.cedar is a awesome mid sized lake to fish.nobody is really sure how they got into the lake.some say the bucket brigade,some say ducks brought them.either which way they are there.ive talked to many guests and other fisherman on the lake a d seems the walleye catch is down.i noticed it myself the last four of years.especially the east end of the lake.it is more fertile down in that end of the lake.water is also murkier down there.not much can be done now.we ice fish them and there are a lot of guys now coming from all over to fish them.they are so many of them it's so easy to catch them.in spring when there spawning I think there's more people crappie fishing than walleye.good for me I've got the lake to myself.haha.ive seen 50 boats in peephole bay just everyday iam out there.dont think we are putting a dent in there population.love to see a no limit.they will eat a lot of walleye fry.bas are in cedar but they seem to be about the same as the be always been and they don't interfere with the walleye fishing.yes they will provide good food for the other species.just hope our lakes don't suffer.id rather have walleye any day and iam sure so do the folks that come up here for years."
5976466,Pooch,2018-01-31 13:43:00,4618,"I agree with that. There really are no other apparent options.Like I said earlier, Crappie are fun fish to catch and good eating. Great for getting someone hooked on fishing. Get on a school and it's one fish after another. Take plenty of minnows.Like walleye they can be hard to locate on occasion as they go deep midsummer down here. With cooler water? Maybe not?I'm curious about being in colder water if that effects meat texture and or flavor? Maybe someone who fishes Rainy Lake could tell us about that or how it has effected walleye fishing.Pooch"
5984618,The tank,2018-02-05 09:12:00,340,crappie on rainy as far as texture and flavor compared to crappie from Wisconsin i dont see much difference. As far as walleye fishing on rainy its better now than ive ever known.
5986985,Bill Krejca,2018-02-06 07:06:00,6107,"The reason I started going to Cedar is for the crappie, when I want walleye, I go to another lake, usually O'Sullivan. I still get enough walleye in Cedar to keep me very happy, I get a bit of everything while crappie fishing. To see the effects of ""culling"", go to certain areas of LOW where no apparent restrictions apply for anything, very dead sea-ish. Bill"
5633866,billy weaver,2017-06-27 10:00:00,470,"Just returned from Wabaskang fishing out of Peffley's on the north end of the lake. I know in years past they have caught crappie at the south end of Wabaskang but in 30 years I never have seen crappie caught in the north. This year a couple of crappie were caught in the north end, will this be the new norm?"
5974538,wally28,2018-01-30 11:56:00,65,How was the walleye bite; I'm going there thie June 23. Thanks.
5974610,prov1800,2018-01-30 12:25:00,5010,Better hope they don't.they are already a nuisance in cedar.makes walleye fishing tougher.they need to get rid of the limit and open it up.there invasive and should be treated as such.but the mnr seems to have problems managing anything.
5974634,bearfvr13,2018-01-30 13:10:00,174,"How does it make the walleye fishing tougher? I will for sure target crappie to help cull the population of them!! We (my son and I) only take 4 walleye a year and eat them at camp (all around 17in). I'm allowed to come to Canada and for that I'm forever grateful,....so I will do whatever I can to help out the fishery. We always buy the more expensive license too, that way more dollars are going towards the fishing future. Now,...back to my original question,...I don't know a lot about crappie,...so why does it make walleye fishing tougher? ThanksChuck"
5974826,Bill Krejca,2018-01-30 15:28:00,6107,"I don't know about making the walleye fishing tougher, could be. I guess. Crappie were introduced to most of the water they now frequent in the NW part of Ontario, LOW being one of many waters, back in the 1920's. Same for small mouth. It does make the walleye catching a little more challenging, having to take those darn 14 inch crappie off, when a walleye could have just as well hit the bait! Crappie are the reason I go to Cedar, I realize other folk may have different prey/opinions in mind. Bill"
5974898,prov1800,2018-01-30 15:55:00,5010,Bill if you fish there you know what I mean iam sure.yes those crappies have taking over many walleye spots.and a guy has a hard time getting to wallleyes in some spots.just catch to many crappies.they will over run cedar yet even worse.cedar is a small lake and they will spread more yet now that they are really established with a lot of bigger crappies.east end is the worst the west end is a little to clear for them and the habitat is different at that end.there going to eat a lot of walleye fry.they weren't introduced either.that was the bucket brigade.there fun for sure but I'd rather have walleye to eat and catch any day.i find them kinda boring to catch.but that's just me. Most fisherman come for walleye to Canada.crappies shouldn't be in our waters here.lake of the woods is connected to rainy and there has always been crappies in there.wabigoon and dinorwic have crappies now to.we catch crappies like crazy now in the winter.catch our limit of 15 in 15 minutes.lol.
5974922,billy weaver,2018-01-30 16:10:00,470,"You don't realize how popular crappie fishing is in the lower 48. I know it may be better if they were not in Cedar Lake, but they are. If it is as easy to catch big crappie as you say, I would advertise it as a draw to the camps on the lake. Maybe heavier fishing pressure on crappie with no limit would thin them down. I guess I wonder why there is a limit on a invasive species."
5975146,prov1800,2018-01-30 18:03:00,5010,"I know how important they are to some people.i guide a lot on cedar and do take people out for them.they can't believe how many they catch in such a short time and 16 ""ers arent uncommon.i wouldike to at least see a no limit on them.iam a walleye guy at heart.hate to see all the conservation that's been done and have seen the lake come back only to be brought down by crappies.be sad."
5975234,billy weaver,2018-01-30 18:49:00,470,Be thankful that people at least like to fish for them. I belong to a fishing club that has a 200 acre lake that joins to the Mississippi River. The DNR did a study on Asian Carp in the lake. They had a commercial fisherman come and net the lake removing the Asian Carp. The fisherman removed 14000 lbs of Asian Carp. Some of the carp were up to 60 lbs. They are bottom feeders and you don't catch them on pole and line. They root up the bottom destroying the other fishes nests. I don't know how far north they will go but I hope it is not any further.
5975250,prov1800,2018-01-30 19:00:00,5010,Me neither.
