5984778,FishermanTom81,2018-02-05 10:29:00,15,7thCrowWing I sent you a message. In short I use a lot of Flicker Shads with a light (10lb) wire leader in front of them. While fishing for walleye and bass you will encounter a lot of accidental muskie and pike.
5986714,ecjte,2018-02-06 00:45:00,11,"Unfortunately, May is not an option, but it looks like we will be heading to LOTW for our trip. I don't mind the ""accidental"" pike as long as they are a reasonable size. Kids like catching anything. I presume there are some nice pike in LOTW?"
5993393,nicko,2018-02-09 13:37:00,508,"depending on where you are at, yes there are. What area will you be in? when are you going?"
6006025,Northpoint,2018-02-15 15:58:00,38,Call Silver Water Wheel Lodge on Lac Seul. If they have a opening the small mouth fishing in June can be great. I think it drops off significantly after that. Read the weekly fishing reports and you will see what I mean. They run a really great place. Some will say its too expensive.....but I personally have found it well worth it.
6008033,ecjte,2018-02-16 16:13:00,11,"Nicko, sorry for delay. Will be in Sioux Narrows area in mid-July. Any suggestions?"
5971482,ecjte,2018-01-28 21:22:00,11,"My first post. Coming from long distance (western Canada) with wife and kids to fish NW Ontario in Jul-Aug. I am considering several lakes (LOTW, Eagle, Cedar, Lac Seul, Wabaskang, and maybe Rainy) and have already researched some nice family-friendly resorts. My questions are about catchability of preferred species on different lakes. I realize this is a walleye forum, but we will target fish in this order: smallmouth, pike, walleye, and other (perch, musky, etc.). With the kids, numbers are preferred over trophies, but it never hurts to catch big ones. The species preference is also based on wife/kids in boat, along with the fact we can catch bundles of pike/walleye out west. I am interested in pros and cons on the fishing - not too worried about lodges, big water issues, rocks/reefs damage, etc. For example, after scouring this forum, Lac Seul is obviously a walleye hotspot, but seems light on smallies. Smallies aren't mentioned as often on Eagle Lake, but it seems promising from a multi-species perspective. Cedar is also highly thought of, but fishing reports in 2017 sounded weak (at least for walleye).Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated. And thanks to all for such a great forum!"
5971730,Obabikon,2018-01-29 06:51:00,2370,LOTW has some great small mouth fishing. Don't overlook that one. Depending on what drive you're taking... fishing out of the Kenora area might be your best choice. (unless you're going to cross the border and drive on the US side)
5971930,camp chef,2018-01-29 08:47:00,915,take a look at the Winnipeg river between Kenora and Minaki.Lots of Family friendly places and a wonderful fishery for what you are seeking.
5972442,prov1800,2018-01-29 13:10:00,5010,"I happen to guide a lot on the other lakes notyet mentioned so ill give you some info on those.eagle lake as you know is fairly big but the fishing is very good .it has all species your looking for in abundance.smallmouths are in great abundance just will be harder the fish for in july/aug.only because they will have gone a bit deeper as have pike.walleye will also be deeper but always much easier to fish.number of camps on eagle from one end to the other.around 65 mi long.check out north shore lodge.very fish friendly camp.cedar has 5 camps on it and has all species except for trout.very good bass population plus good walleye fishing and bonus crappies that are very easy to catch.be great to get on them with kids.checkout clarkes northern lights resort.best boats on the lake and all the bait you need for free.as far as lac suel you cant go wrong there either.just plain big and awesome.very good smallmouth fishing.reason you don't here much about it is because nobody fishes for them.pike fishing is really good also.again not a lot of people targeting them.bonus.another lake I would recommend is cliff lake.check out lost bay resort.this is a clear lake with trout,muskie,pike,walleye, and a large population of bass.hard to get walleye.great muskie and pike.you will catch more muskies than pike here.if you need more info just pm me."
5972866,vassago,2018-01-29 15:40:00,103,If you like smallies consider shoal lake ont. just keep in mind they don't call it shoal lake for nothing...The water is pristine which your family will love!! Walleye and bass are c&r. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
5973530,ecjte,2018-01-29 21:42:00,11,"Thanks for all the help everyone. I should have added one more question to my original post. Given the parameters already given, any suggestions on timing? Better smallies earlier? Again for us that would be early July. Or does it make no difference once we get to full-on summer season?"
5973890,Obabikon,2018-01-30 07:39:00,2370,"If you're coming post spawn (July), you're going to be best served fishing stained water... as the bass will hold up on the banks. It wouldn't make a huge difference unless you wait until late August. Anytime in July will hold a similar fishing pattern for smallmouth."
5975410,ecjte,2018-01-30 20:41:00,11,Thanks Obabikon!
5977058,FishermanTom81,2018-01-31 22:01:00,15,With what you want I would recommend May in the Morson area of LOTW. I stayed at Tamarack Island Wilderness Lodge last year and if we were not getting a fish on every third cast we moved. We never had to fish farther than a few miles from camp.
5984138,7thCrowWing,2018-02-04 22:50:00,132,"Tom can I ask what you were fishing for, going there to Tamarack the 1st week in June and will be my 8 year old sons 1st Canada trip just trying to get a feel for what we need to do to catch fish. Thanks!"
