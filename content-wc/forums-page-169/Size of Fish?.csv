5997457,Aspencreek,2018-02-11 18:20:00,2911,You have a PM I just sent you.
5994817,Jigger1,2018-02-10 09:49:00,234,"I've been tracking all eyes over 18"" since 2000 which is now over 7000 data points caught on Lac Seul. For our group 2017 was actually significantly better for overall size. What I like about looking at it this way is that it clearly calls out that walleyes over 27"" are not a given and should be valued as fish of a lifetime to the thread within the thread. I was lucky to get my first 30 in 2016, she was worth the wait and she swam away strongly. She was 1 of only 3 caught in our groups over the last 18 years. 2017 2000-2017 Slot 31.27% 41.31% 21 15.44% 16.54% 22 14.16% 12.80% 23 12.48% 8.71% 24 10.42% 8.18% 25 7.59% 6.05% 26 5.28% 3.81% 27 2.32% 1.65% 28 0.77% 0.63% 29 0.26% 0.28% 30+ 0.00% 0.04%"
5994897,stjoeguy,2018-02-10 10:38:00,979,"I can't imagine recording every fish over 18"", but I applaud you for your effort!"
5994921,Wall-i-Lama,2018-02-10 10:56:00,1524,"Most impressive and clearly shows that in 2017 a jump in the percent of 22"" to 26"" fish caught. Great piece of work. Takes a lot of dedication to do this! One question, how was 2017 for numbers compared to past years?"
5994961,Jigger1,2018-02-10 11:13:00,234,"The guides record it all I then transfer to my spreadsheet so I get to relive my trip as well as that of the rest of my group so it is actually fun. I pull it up a few times over the winter and play with the data. Volume was solid, I've only gone back a few years and looked at ave/day/fisherman over 18"". 2014 - 10.26, 2015 - 15.74, 2016 - 9.71, 2017 - 12.74"
5995105,David Anderson,2018-02-10 12:07:00,2073,"Well, to be honest it was my first year and my reference to ""Main Lake"" areas were south of what the guys called Lighthouse point, a long sandy point. I was the rookie so I mostly followed. I know we fished South Bay and never McKenzie. I have my deposit in for next August and plan on exploring on my own as my hosts are creatures of habit. I did find a nice tip of an underwater point I drove by and we really nailed them, much to the surprise of the guys. As with any place on Lac Seul, there is a lot of structure, a lot of places to catch fish if one is willing to spend a few minutes not rushing to ""that spot where we always have caught them"". Maybe it's because we are fishing these mid lake humps (25 - 30 feet) where possibly the larger fish hang out as opposed to the points (15 - 25 feet), which very well maybe the haunts of the smaller fish."
5995193,pjshorthorn,2018-02-10 13:30:00,5654,Do you fish out of Silver Water Wheel ? I know their guides keep maticulous notes on their client's catches. PjShorthorn
5995585,Jigger1,2018-02-10 17:06:00,234,"Yes this will my 19th year at SWWL, the countdown is on."
5995761,pjshorthorn,2018-02-10 19:04:00,5654,"Great that you are able to keep all those stats. It is impressive for sure. As you mentioned, I'm sure it is a great way to remember those big fish and awesome trips. PjShorthorn"
5995857,Aspencreek,2018-02-10 19:47:00,2911,"What camp are you fishing out of?? Your guys sound like alot of the groups we run into. They run to the same spots every year and fish maybe 4-6 spots all week, sometimes staying all day every day pounding the sand banks in McKenzie. I would have to shoot myself!!! We plan our days depending on wind, rain and weather. That determines where we go to make sure we can get out of the wind if we need to, or seek shelter, and still catch fish. The only time we really were stuck at the cabin was when we were smoked in from a forest fire a few years ago and that only lasted the morning. But I got to catch up on my sleep and make a few more spinners. Like I said before I like to find at least 4-6 new spots every year or at least learn whats underwater at a a few new spots that I haven't explored before. I have at least 5-10 spots to choose from, no matter what the wind or weather, you would be amazed at what you can find, if you just take the time to look."
5996993,David Anderson,2018-02-11 12:59:00,2073,"As stated earlier, we are going back to Fisherman's Cove, it's a very nice place, however I thought that we had to run around 15 - 20 miles a day to get to those choice areas. Not a problem with my rig but it seems like there should be good fishing less than 45 minutes away. Man, you have described my group to a tee, 4 - 6 spots all week staying there all day. I am not complaining, we throw in $20 bucks a piece and have 4 prizes, first fish, largest fish, 2nd largest fish, and most fish for the week with my brother and I being rookies, took 3 out of 4 and would have gotten the 4th if we would not have revealed our newly found hump to anyone. I am looking forward to going back as they were a good group of guys and is something different. Interesting that one of the guys met me last year at Lac Seul Outposts on opener. Time builds confidence and a year under the belt will definitely help. What I have found on Lac Seul is the time between noon and 2 can be pretty slow so a new spot may not reveal itself right away."
5983554,Walleye Fishing Guy,2018-02-04 14:39:00,12,"I love the cat comment...I have 2 and as much as I would love to have them eat some fish when I do, they always turn their noses up at the idea of eating fish...and, in case you're wondering, I have been told by many including my doctor that I am/must be an excellent cook. (I'll let you figure that out what that says about me!)Thanks for contributing to the conversation."
5983570,BornToFish,2018-02-04 15:16:00,1224,"Greetings,Many years ago, my wife boated her first 30+ inch long walleye. We were so thrilled we kept it in the livewell on the way back to the lodge. We wanted to show off the fish at the dock and get some pictures. Needless to say, that fish died on the boat ride to the dock. That fish is now mounted and displayed in our family room.Since then, we have had several replicas made for nice fish. These replicas look much better than the skin-mount walleye mentioned above.We learned some valuable lessons from the experience mentioned above. We now have ""minimums"" in mind for each species of fish that we target. In this way, we are not faced with the dilemma of ""should we keep it for mounting or should we put it back?"", meanwhile the fish dies while trying to resolve the dilemma.We now keep a tape measure in the boat so that we can get accurate measurements of a fish's length and girth. We have a camera in the boat so that we can get some quick, high-quality photographs of the fish. The fish is then returned to the water, resuscitated if needed and released. The only reason that we would not release a trophy fish is if it doesn't survive hook removal. Honestly, this doesn't happen very often as we are prepared to safely remove hooks.Everyone wants to catch lots of trophy fish. Nearly all of these fish can be safely released and commemorated with a high-quality replica, with a modest of amount of forethought and preparation.Each angler needs to decide for himself or herself whether they should keep or release trophy fish. My wife and I feel that we have taken our fishing to a much deeper and more personal level by making the decision to release all trophy fish. We release the fish and think ""wow, that was a nice fish"", and focus on catching another nice fish.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5983586,Freytown,2018-02-04 15:32:00,770,Good topic. Some folks have caught multiple 30+ inch walleye while others may have never caught one. To release or keep will have a different meaning to each group. Pretty easy for the multiple guys to release but not so much for the other group. It's all relative...it's all relative.
5984082,Aspencreek,2018-02-04 21:13:00,2911,"I understand the question is a dilema for some, but I have NEVER caught a 30""+ walleye, close but not yet, and when I do there will be the same urgency to take the pics, get it on the measuring board and back in the water as unharmed and quickly as possible. Then the whooping and hollering will take place. Like I said before I have several replica mounts with a couple more to go. They are remarkable and extremely lifelike, right down to the ""feel"" (they compress and spring back) without the slime. And the ability to say I returned it back to the water makes it just that more satisfying. We too had a 29"" die on us because of a deep hookset and WAY to many pictures, Both of us in the boat felt sick about it and vowed to try and never happen again. When we got back to camp we gave it to a young man (about 10) who was there with his father and mother who were struggling to catch anything. The look on his face and the smiles from his dad and mom were priceless. I assumed they mounted it, and I have the replica on the wall too."
5984722,Wall-i-Lama,2018-02-05 10:14:00,1524,"Agree with many here about not keeping big fish and making replica mounts. I have purchased 3 mounts for others that have fished with me and the mounts look great. Depending on who does it, real skin mounts look horrible after about 10 years and usually end up in the trash. We release every big fish, making sure to measure, take quick photos and take time to make sure the fish is swimming 100%. While it bothers me a lot to see others keep big fish, as long they are within the law, it's their call. Last fall, we saw a group routinely keep and eat 23""and 24"" fish. They had daily fish frys and had a big crew in camp. Not something I would do, but it's not my place to say anything directly. I may not like it, that's the way it is. I do however try to set an example in these situations. When groups like this ask me how we did, I make sure to point out that WE catch many larger fish, but release all of them. Usually show them pics and include some statement about that fish is out there for someone else to catch and release someday. I don't know if it works, but just doing my part."
5985842,David Anderson,2018-02-05 16:56:00,2073,"Interesting, I fish the Chamberlain Narrows area 3 times a year. Last year I went to the NW side, fishing out of Fisherman's Cove. My observations is that in the Chamberlain narrows area we get lots of fish but I would say 75% are under 16 inches. Last August out of Scout Bay into the main lake I would say that 75% of our walleyes were over 18"" with a lot of them over 22"". I think we catch more in CN but the size difference was noticeable. We did fish mostly main lake 20 foot + humps in August verses points in CN."
5986250,Wall-i-Lama,2018-02-05 18:54:00,1524,"David, what area do you consider main lake, McKenzie Bay Area? I've only fished NW above steamboat bay. Up there last fall it seemed like a mixed bag, but 75% seemed to bar in the 16"" and had under range."
5988409,Aspencreek,2018-02-06 18:28:00,2911,"Main Lake for us is anything east southeast of Shanty narrows/Bay of Islands all the way thru Manitoba and Windigo Pt. Personally I have been in McKenzie about a dozen times, way to many other boats for me, but for some guys that is the only place they go and will spend the whole week up there. I enjoy South Islet and being able to get out of the wind and the smaller points, bays down there. I have only been NW of Steamboat when we fished out of Goose Bay in 1999. Now we stay at Onaway so to go up there is really not worth it. Like I said earlier we have gotten alot better at determining where the bigger fish will be. Wind direction, water temps, air temps, fronts, rain and Structure are all determining factors, and knowing when to stay at it and when to move on. We jig, backtroll, slipbobber, and lindy rig (sort of), and even troll plugs (in our own special way). Last trip up in July of 2016 (couldn't go last year) my brother and I had a hard time catching our eaters, everything was in or over the slot. Now, our eaters must be between 16-17"" and I only keep 1 to eat per meal, and we average 30-40 fish per day per guy, some days are better than others depending on the weather and wind. BUT, putting the pieces to the puzzel together is the real fun thing for me, sitting looking at the map and picking a spot and having it be right is a satisfaction as good as anything"
5988553,Wall-i-Lama,2018-02-06 20:03:00,1524,Awesome! Good luck up there this year!
5988617,Aspencreek,2018-02-06 21:17:00,2911,"That is a great idea. Learn the structure, drops, points, weedlines, midlake humps, etc. and explore. I try and find at least 5-6 new spots each year (week trip). And the great thing is, you find a spot one year and it doesn't produce, but the next year it's the go too spot. And that is because the wind was in the right direction, or another spot because it's got a soft bottom with a weedline at 10' deep that drops to 20' (love those). Or any other sharp breaks around points, or deep drops on either side of a hump, or when the wind blows onto a shoreline for 2 straight days, finding and working them can be more fun than a guy should be allowed to have. Man I wish I could take a month, I'm jealous!!!"
5969050,Walleye Fishing Guy,2018-01-27 11:12:00,12,"Just wondering...I fished Lac Suel last summer for the first time in about 10 years. I noticed that the size of walleye caught was down from my last visit. We caught a lot of 16 - 18"" and while I had caught lots of 18 - 21 inchers on previous trips, the number again was way down. I used to get at least 3 or 4 a day over the slot, this time a 5 day trip yielded only 3 or 4 total over the slot. Has anyone else noticed this about Lac Suel or was it only a function of recent year classes?"
5969066,pjshorthorn,2018-01-27 11:17:00,5654,Where did you fish on Lac Seul? Big body of water. What presentation were you using ? PjShorthorn
5969082,Slim03,2018-01-27 11:25:00,159,I have been going for 5 years to Lac Seul and last year I actually thought the quality of fish was better. On one day last year one of the boats pulled in 25 over the slot. On another trip last year we tripled up and 2 were over the slot and one was a solid 20. I also had a couple days when high pressure rolled in where fishing became challenging and finding much over 16 was a battle. I did notice a lot more traffic than what I had seen in previous years and there were also a lot of boats getting checked.
5969762,rather-be-fishin,2018-01-27 21:46:00,429,"I would like to also know what area of Lac Seul you were fishing and what were the lures, bait & presentation you used? Also, what time of the season were you fishing? We have been fishing LS for 13 years and have always had excellent Walleye fishing. Average size has been fat 19-25 Walleyes & normally catch some 26-28 too. We have caught a Walleye 30 & 32. We find it a challenge to catch Walleye eaters/freezer fish 16-17 3/4 which makes it fun! Most days our group catches many 20-25 Walleyes. So, your experience last year is not what we have had on LS. We primarily use jigs or spinners with minnows & troll, drift or still fish. Occasionally we use crawlers. When we first were fishing LS we hired a guide for a day for a few years to learn the lake & good fishing spots that produce year after year. 6 months & count down is on to our return trip on Lac Seul! RBF"
5976730,Aspencreek,2018-01-31 17:27:00,2911,"I unfortunately missed last year but we have going up since 2000. The quality of the fish and size has been steadily going up. BUT, we have also gotten WAY better at identifying good spots and trends depending on water temps, air temps, hi/low pressures, and wind directions. Our tactics, bait, and strategy change. If you fish the same way, in the same spots, you will see ups and downs. Believe it or not, there are MULTIPLE ways to catch walleye on LS, try-em you'll like the results."
5977170,BornToFish,2018-02-01 05:51:00,1224,"Greetings,I don't fish Lac Seul, so didn't post on this thread earlier. The previous post by ApenCreek gave me food for thought.I fish a lake that isn't too far from Lac Seul. I've learned that this lake has places that tend to be ""big fish"" spots and places that tend to be ""nurseries"". These spots tend to emerge as the season progresses. We don't catch many little walleyes in the ""big fish"" spots. On the other hand, we sometimes catch big fish in the ""nurseries"". The only significant difference that I recognize between the ""big fish"" spots and ""nurseries"" is access to deep water. The ""big fish"" spots tend to drop into water that is 30+ feet deep, whereas the ""nurseries"" are in about twenty fow.I look forward to hearing the thoughts of others on this observation. There may very well be other explanations as well.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5978098,Walleye Fishing Guy,2018-02-01 10:59:00,12,"Thanks for the replies everyone. I was fishing the NE corner of the lake...Chamberlin Narrows area. Biggest change I noticed from prior years to the area was the increased boat traffic. When fishing areas that I had previously seen few if any boats, I was seeing 10 or more each day. Was thinking that pressure might be the cause of size decrease. I was there in early July, fished points, reefs and narrows...used jigs and plastics or minnows mostly but also pulled some crawlers on spinners. Again, to be clear...2 guys 75 - 100 walleye a day most between 16 and 18 inches. Most lakes around me at home I wouldn't catch that many in a month so numbers were not the issue...just concerned about drop off in size from prior trips. I'd like to go back again this year and was considering the other end of the lake as I have also fished there and had good luck. The Chamberlin area has special meaning for me though as it is where my dad and I each caught our biggest eyes...over 30"" fish. Thanks again for the responses."
5978210,prov1800,2018-02-01 11:34:00,5010,"Fortunately I live 45 min from scout bay and get to fish there for 5-6 months a year.i take friends there,My wife and I get to guide there.probably have been fishing it for 25 plus years.have fished her from earfalls to siouxlookout.been through every imaginable type of weather and missed the tornado by a day.thank God.it is by far a fantastic lake that offers a variety of fish and I spend certain amounts of time targeting them all.as of today the lake is awesome.i actually guided out on lac suel in2005/2006 and guided from my own boat.back then I was not unusual to put a 30"" walleye or two in the boat everyday I went out.always put them back carefully.these fish have slowly disappeared since then with only the odd one here and there.not even a lot of reports from other fisherman.i seem to catch a lot of 25-27"" pretty steady which is still pretty fantastic fishing anywhere you go.the lake still offers incredible numbers and good sized eaters.i have absolutely no negative thought of lac suel.strictly positive .I do have my spots I fish.some have been compromised but one thing I have learned over the years that there are schools of smaller Fish,medium fish and then some schools of big fish.this still holds true for me to this day.i hate fishing camp holes a lot of them I fished years ago now there to busy and k have moved on the other places normally where no one else fishes.yes there is places like that.haha.eaters and slot fish are everywhere and anytime of the year.fishing is more about having a great time and having good conservation.i would love to see mnr nust put a 4 under 18"" limit on all lakes.i have seen people taking home some big fish home which they are entitled to but just hate to see it."
5978954,Aspencreek,2018-02-01 17:55:00,2911,"Right on, The camp we go to has a camp rule that if you are going to keep an overslot fish, It gets cleaned for mounting ONLY, no eating it!! So that makes that fish your big fish for the week. I would much rather see 4 fish under 18"" No keepers over 18"". The advent of replica mounts fixes this problem. I have pics and measurements of every big fish and have now got 5 replica mounts on a stringer mount. And the best thing I say when people ask ""each one was released back into the water"". and the cat doesn't even look at them."
5983546,Walleye Fishing Guy,2018-02-04 14:36:00,12,Agree Prov1800...big fish - for me anything over the slot should be put back. No reason to take home a 23 + inch fish to prove how good a fisherman you are. dI mad the initial post just to check in with others about their observations on size. I appreciate your observations and hope others share the desire to keep the resource strong and release the big ones to be caught again.
