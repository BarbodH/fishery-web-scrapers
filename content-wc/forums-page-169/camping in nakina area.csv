Fished in Quebec for many years in the La Verendrye reserve and Val Dor area. Just looking for a campground where i can launch my boat from my campsite. Any help will be greatly appreciated."

Chads suggestion is a good one also with direct access to the lake. Lower twin lakes lodge also has a campground if you want to cut an hour off drive time. The municipality of greenstone has a camp ground on cordinley lake beside the air base, it's equipped with electricity, water and a shower house across the road, keep in mind it gets busy there with the air base and sleeping won't be an issue the float planes start early. Another option is just camp on crown land, there are lots of spots where you can camp in peace."
