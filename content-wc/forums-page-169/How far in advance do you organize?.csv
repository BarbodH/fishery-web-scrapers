5980322,stjoeguy,2018-02-02 10:07:00,979,"I've been the fishing trip organizer for the last 10 years or so and I enjoy it, but parts of the organization can be frustrating. Every year as we leave the camp on the last day of the trip I tell the camp owner to put us down for the same time next year. Then I don't think about it for another 6 months. After January 1st, I send in a deposit for 6 guys, the camp minimum. In the past I've just sent in the $600 and taken credit for it when we pay up. This year, for the first time, I actually collected deposits from 5 others and sent in 6 checks. Eight at the cabin is ideal and it can sleep up to 10, so I'm always looking for a few more guys. I realize that not everyone is as enthusiastic about fishing NW Ontario as I am and that it's a big time and dollar expense, but it's frustrating getting people to commit to the trip. Two year's ago a fellow dropped out a month before the trip and I scrambled to fill his spot. I try to get the trip list set by mid-March for our early June trip. This year there are 6 guys committed and 3 hanging on the fence, so far. So my questions are: How far in advance do you finalize your group? Is 3 months before the trip asking too much? Do you collect deposits from everyone in advance?"
5980378,jabecker,2018-02-02 10:28:00,118,"I also organize the entire trip for 8 people. I take care of everything. They just have to bring their clothes and personal items. We go in the middle of June and the cutoff for them to let me know is April 1. These are family members but if they cant go I have other members that want to go. This year my son in law doesnt know if he will have enough vacation time due to a new job. He has till April 1 or my grandson will go instead. It also gives me enough time to buy much of the food items when they are on sale. I also take inventory of all my fishing gear and if I need something I have enough time to purchase it. I also take care of the Outdoors Cards and if needed I can get them done ahead of time. I have a list of all the food for 8 people from 15 years. We have it broke down by days and meals. If the weather plays havoc for our longer days trips we can change the order around with no problem. We eat fish for 5 meals and 1 meal of fish for shore lunch. I also have some hot dogs and brats that are frozen in case fishing sucks and we dont get enough fish to eat. This has never happened, but better safe than sorry. One year I filleted some boneless northerns and the women didnt even notice the difference. It is a family outing that is well organized. I have been going to Canada for over 55 years and have the system down good."
5980386,BornToFish,2018-02-02 10:30:00,1224,"Greetings,Personally, I start preparing for my next trip on my way home from my current trip. I invariably lose something while fish (e.g. a lure), run out of something (e.g. a particular color of jig) or break something (e.g. a rod tip). I make a mental list of things that I need to purchase or do when I get home. Not too many days go by when I don't think about my next fishing trip.Most of my trips are with my wife or I fly solo. These trips are a breeze to organize.My good friend organizes a group of 16-18 for one of our trips. His method for planning the trip is simple. Anyone wanting to go needs to have their down payment ($250) to him by about Thanksgiving weekend, such that he can get the combined payment to the lodge owner well before Christmas. This is done to lock in the appropriate number of beds, cabins, and boats with the lodge owner in advance of the show circuit (e.g. All Canada Shows) in early January. He works with the lodge owner to ""max out"" the capacity of the cabins that we reserve each year.Our group remains pretty stable from year to year. Each year, it seems that someone needs to drop out from the group for special reasons. They know they may or may not get that spot back when they drop out.Our group understands that ""waffling"" is not tolerated. Either they have their deposit paid by about Thanksgiving weekend or they are out. Someone else may be offered that spot or the cabin given up.I wish the original poster all the best in organizing his trip. I sense organizing his current group is sort of like herding cats.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5980578,Mojo-NC,2018-02-02 11:30:00,1929,"I also coordinate a trip for 8 guys; this year we're also coordinating with another sub-group of 6 additional guys. I let them know everything I'm doing so they can make their plans accordingly. We book 1 year in advance to make sure we are able to get the appropriate number of cabins. Our trip requires airfare, so we book our flights as soon as the airline allows (270 days in advance I think). I reserve automobiles either from a dealership or from the rental agency at the INL airport. I book all of our rooms in Dryden, which is where we stay the night on Friday and finish the trip on Saturday morning. Our deposit is $150 apiece and we each cough up our share the first two weeks of December. If someone cancels, they lose their deposit if we are not able to find a replacement angler (that's never happened but is understood by all). One of the other guys plans the meals for the week, and puts together a grocery list to match. We stop and get everything we need in International Falls before we cross the border. We divide all of the expenses evenly, except everyone gets their own alcohol and souvenirs. The trip requires (not really) a couple of ""planning meetings"" and those meetings are held at a local watering hole where the waitresses wear orange. Sometimes more meetings are necessary. Ok, we don't really do any planning at these meetings, but we do talk about fishing while putting away a few beers and some Buffalo wings. It all seems to work out pretty well, and I like doing it because I want it to be done right!"
5980642,camp chef,2018-02-02 11:57:00,915,"i organize our trip. Small group of 4 and I send in the deposit around Christmas time. As we generally have dinner together at least once a week we have all winter to discuss details which really don't change much from year to year. We change camps every 4 or 5 years and that requires a little more recon and preparation for me but this year we are going back to a camp that 2 of us have been to 5 or 6 times so it is mostly a matter of digging out the old notes and menus and shopping lists.All my Canadian contacts and places we stop as well as notes from our trips as far back as the 90's are in one briefcase that travels with us on all our Canadian trips. It is affectionately known as ""The football"""
5980930,btyreprich,2018-02-02 15:10:00,1067,"Like most everyone else, our trip dates for next years trip are confirmed when we pay the bill for this years trip. I send in a few hundred dollar deposit for my son and I while my buddy does the same for he and his son. I try and send in a deposit before New Years Day. Hotel reservations for a Friday night stay in International Falls also happen before the holidays. (I'm too old to sleep in the car). I adjust our grocery list / menu on the ride home. This way everyone remembers what they liked for dinner or did not like to eat. Grocery list updated from my notes during Christmas break. With regards to collecting money to buy groceries, I like to start shopping a good two months ahead of the trip. This way I can take advantage of sales and buy specialty food items not close to my house- Yuenling Beer for example! I ask everyone to send me like $125.00 a person which is enough to cover the groceries. Any cash left over is just thrown in the gas kitty. I don't mind doing this - it's rather enjoyable. When one person handles the job, there's less of a chance something will be forgotten."
5981266,valley366,2018-02-02 18:32:00,193,"I have always been the trip organizer. 8 times to Canada in June with a group of -7. Couple Ice fishing trips to LOW. Even have organized a couple of NASCAR trips.Canada trips booked a year in advance and reserved when leaving camp the year before. Each person takes care of their own deposits straight to the camp. That way they have to negotiate with camp for a refund and not me. I book the hotel in Ft. Frances and buy all the food. They are responsible for any beverages they care to drink and any snacks they need.Planning usually started as soon as returned. We have s shorelunch kit and another tote of camp incidentals (dish soap, tin foil, garbage bags and so on). I would usually inventory the kit on return and place an index card in the top of it so when time came to top it off I could just grab the list.Meals we would do pretty much standard meals. Shorelunch each day and evenings a set meal list. Typical question each evening was ""what are you hungry for tomorrow"".That trip has now changed to just my boys and I for now. Same as above but smaller meal list. Hoping to increase people count in next couple years but intend on running the same way with deposits and such."
5981282,stjoeguy,2018-02-02 18:39:00,979,"Hey there, Mr Ziggy or is it Mr Zag? Thanks for joining us last year. We all had a good time. So far this year's St Joe trip is the same as last year minus you and Robert. Hope you have a great family trip this year. I can't imagine organizing a trip for 14. As BornToFish says, that would be like herding cats. As you saw last year, our group is pretty easy going and not at all cat-like."
5981322,clawman,2018-02-02 18:47:00,2078,Raise the price the closer it gets to the trip.
5981442,gullrockguy,2018-02-02 20:16:00,44,"I just sent an email to my buddy in Calgary as to who is buying what for our annual get together at his cabin on Eagle Lake, Even though it is just down the road from my house (2hrs) i still get excited about the trip. getting to be with your friends and enjoying the fishing experiences requires planning even in the winter. I start making a list and keeping it in a file on my desktop, that way i can add to it whenever i think of an item i want to take ."
5981602,ogilville,2018-02-03 05:29:00,262,"I have been going every year for many years. In my younger days when our group got home there were always a number of other guys that definitely wanted to go next year. You could count them in. Of course when it came time to actually make the plans the excuses started flowing. So, like many of you a non-refundable deposit is required when reservations are made. This seems to have the effect of weeding out the ones that want to talk about going and those that really want to go."
5981682,Mojo-NC,2018-02-03 06:52:00,1929,"We will be fishing in Canada 4 months from today. We had our first planning meeting yesterday over beer and wings. We didn't really do any planning, we're all just looking forward to the trip. One guy brought a bunch of new spoons that he had ordered online to show them to everyone. We already decided what we're doing next year."
5981754,Bill Krejca,2018-02-03 07:13:00,6107,"I have been organizing one or two trips a year since the 1960's, anywhere from 3 to 15 people. If they want to go, the deposit needs to be to me several weeks before the time the camp wants it. Additional people going after that means either sending in additional deposits, or paying upon arrival, depending on time, etc. Sometimes it make a difference which cabin is available, so the camp owners need to be aware of the total, within reason. Because i camped for years, going to a cabin simplifies matters greatly. I keep a running amount of non perishable leftover foods, to be stored, if canned, or frozen as applicable. Periodically, the items are pitched. I keep record of what I take, also ask at the end of the trip what they liked or didn't, and try to accommodate. One scenario which I learned to avoid, was for each person to bring a dish for one meal. Unless you plan these trips on a regular basis, it seems many folks don't have a clue as what constitutes a portion, and on those occasions we had way to much stuff left over. We don't do that any more. Planning starts on the way home, or even earlier, sometime I buy food for 2 trips, sale can be a very good thing. Bill"
5982018,Moosebunk,2018-02-03 08:53:00,211,"Organized a first group trip in 2004 and have been doing so annually since. Thing is, the groups have always been 8 or less and the past years the size has certainly shrunk, by choice. Every trip that's ever been booked has been a winner IMO but, not everyone always wants the same things out of a trip, so now and again myself or others have run into the odd bit of disappointment. I go to fish as it's a fishing trip, (and I fish hard for long days, as that's ""my"" joy) and those here who have organized trips for fishing in the past can surely understand the late payers, non committers, under and over prepared, slow pokes, freeloaders, lazy guys in camp, drunks, etc., can make the planning and execution difficult now and again. But as time has passed I've come to realize that people who do come along for any trip are none of these things above. They are themselves, and they are out to enjoy these times away, in their own way, same as anybody else. That it was my expectations as both the organizer and as a certain type of angler that needed to adapt better and find the people and experiences that work best for all, and myself. Therefor I don't chance much anymore but, instead tend to only do trips with the right partners along, trips which suit all of us involved and have the best chance of being great for everyone. Learning over the years what works for myself as the organizer and friends who trust me in that, makes each step from start to finish an easier process. Therefor planning can often come later. First big trip planned a group of 13 that got whittled down to 7 over the span of 30 months as, time and deposits left people behind. From Ontario we went to BC for a week of sturgeon fishing. Those who came along had a good time."
5985234,MrSimon,2018-02-05 14:25:00,922,"1) As early as possible, but February/March seems where we typically end up 2) Not at all!! Trips like this are BIG and require serious planning and attention. 3) Deposits are a great idea. They weed out the ""maybes"" from the ""definites"" As the organizer I keep a running list of trip options. I'm constantly researching, reading, making calls, and learning. It takes a LOT to match up a certain group of guys with the right kind of experience. But it's soooooo worth it when everyone has a great time."
5987033,Baseline,2018-02-06 07:25:00,3207,"For years I organized two larger trips each year. There were 2 of us who took the time to get the trip together, two guys would jump in and help a week or so before and 4 guys who were, for lack of a better description, guests. About 10 years ago I decided to have meeting at the end of one of our trips and told everyone that they needed to commit to the trip with cash at a final date. That everyone would participate in grocery shopping providing meals for the group and would take care of any incidentals they needed for transportation, boat and anything else they needed. The next year the deadline came and went and I had 4 deposits in hand. So I dropped the other 4 guys who were the guests. I called two other guys who expressed interest in going on the trip and collected their deposits. I sent out an email told everyone to come prepared to provide meals for the one full day for the group. I included day of departure and left it up to the others to take care of thier travel plans to get to the resort. I send out the email in October for both trips and the deadline is November. After I collect and mail the deposits I concern myself with arrangements for me and my fishing partner and leave it up to the other guys to take care of their planning. We still have a solid group of 6 guys and no one has any excessive planning duties."
5987137,wmd,2018-02-06 08:33:00,388,"Hi stjoeguy I organize the fall trip for our group. I send in the deposit for the group and the others reimburse me. I only send deposit for those that have committed usually 4-6 this year it will be 8. I don't like to try and fill spots after i have made reservations, but know why you need to have a minimum of 6 guys to St. Joe. I am glad you were short last year and I was able to join your group and am looking forward to this years trip. Over the years we have had only 1 cancellation because of an illness in the family so have not had issues there. My experience with the guys who sure would like to go but won't commit his they will never end up going so I don't waste my time with them. I have often wondered how some of these people ever were successful in their business careers when they can't make up their mind whether to go on fishing trip or not. I think I am there with you on the enjoyment of an Ontario fishing trip. wmd"
5992521,bigwalleye1,2018-02-09 06:59:00,2632,"You can't start organizing if you never stop....On the way home from a trip I'm already working on next year's list. What i needed that I didn't have, what I have that I don't need..."
5992833,btyreprich,2018-02-09 09:31:00,1067,I try doing the same as the whole trip is still fresh in everyone's mind.
5995129,kona77,2018-02-10 12:15:00,236,"I make trip notes during the week and then confirm on the way home.. Keep track of water temps and what lures/jig color etc worked the best. More importantly I document how the food allocation and misc. supplies lasted.. With weight restrictions it is important to not over-pack but on the other hand we do not want to run out of oil, bread, paper supplies etc."
5995769,DaBirdman,2018-02-10 19:05:00,164,"For my family's Canada trip, I have a 9-page spreadsheet for packing, shopping, etc that we use each year. Every year it gets modified slightly, but in general, I just print that out and it covers everything. On a good note, I'll need to develop a new one for the fly-in trip we're doing this year!"
5996033,stjoeguy,2018-02-10 21:53:00,979,"Thanks to everyone for their responses. You all sound more organized than I am. I have basically a three worksheet spreadsheet. The first worksheet is a list of people with names, emails, phone numbers etc. It includes everyone I may some day ask (or have asked) to go on a trip. Every year I add people that might be interested or delete those that will never go. I record when I ask them and if their response is yes, no, or maybe. There also is a column for notes that includes Walleye Central names. I've met a lot a great people through Walleye Central. Three of them are going on this year's trip. The second worksheet is a menu and the third worksheet is the shopping list. The strange thing is that I make the menu but hewhocookstomuch does most of the cooking. Oh well, we work well together. The two of us do the grocery shopping the day before the trip. Over the years I've managed to convince avikefan that he is the best fish and potato cook. Somebody else cleans the fish. Now that I think about it, I've got a pretty good thing going. Each year I copy the spreadsheet and change the dates. On the return trip we'll talk about what worked with the menu and then pretty much forget about everything for another six months. At this point I've sent in the deposit and have 6 guys to go on this year's trip, so we're good to go. In the next few days I hope to hear about the final maybe spots on the trip. If not, I'll start filling in the blanks and we'll go from there. Six is the minimum for the cabin, and I know that some are more comfortable with six, but I can't count on the same six every year, so I need to fill in the 6-10 range in order to simplify getting six guys in the future. Thanks for everyone's help."
5997065,Mr Ranger,2018-02-11 13:58:00,272,WOW cannot imagine organizing for such large groups. I do ours but it is just four people. All be it very high maintenance . I use the planning as a way to avoid having to go ice fishing and is my winter fix. It gets to the point that the trip itself is almost a let down as that trip is coming to an end. Always hope the good Lord allows me to go again next year. One major tip. DO NOT PEAK TO EARLY. We go the last week of June to O'sullivans in Nakina so keep the menu waiting till April or so. Enjoy everyone.
5985594,MonstBlitz,2018-02-05 15:52:00,16,"There's usually 3 - 4 that I know are definitely going early on. The rest of the group solidifies itself in between. Some end up ""Last Minute Larry's"" and that's ok. Quote: Is 3 months before the trip asking too much? No, not at all. Especially if you need a deposit from everyone or if you don't have a group yet that you know you can go regardless. For me I have 2 or 3 guys that I know will always go barring on surprise life issues, so I know trip is on regardless when you have those guys and the others can fall in whenever. I try not to put too much pressure on the maybes. People are going to do what they want to do. If they aren't willing to or can't afford the money for a trip like this, I don't want to make them feel bad about not going. Trips like this are supposed to be a week of joy, you shouldn't have to try hard to get people on board, and if you do get others in your group. I have good friends I wish would go with me on these trips, but I know fishing isn't their thing like it is for me so I don't try to force it.Quote: Do you collect deposits from everyone in advance? Only if I have to. For cheaper trips, like the ice fishing trip we are doing in a couple of weeks, I pay it and it's good to know I'm covered and pre-paid. For trips that require a deposit I can't cover like Canada fly in trip, if my father is going I get him to cover it because it's not an issue for him to pay it or carry it on his card and then we all just pay our share when we get there. Requires trust from your group that they don't flake out, but if you trust them it doesn't matter. My dad is the one that flakes out sometimes, so getting him to cover the deposit solves 2 problems!As for the question in your title, my trip planning starts on the prior year trip. What did I bring that I don't need next trip? What did I forget? I take notes like this during the trip in preparation for next trip. Then most prep happens slowly over the year, and ramps up 1 month before."
5980954,packpro,2018-02-02 15:16:00,695,"Took over organizing our trip about 1o years ago. We have had 4 guys and we have had 16. 8-10 is the usual number Our camp is different with most of the cabins holding 4 guys. One cabin holds 5 and one cabin holds two. That helps us with our number and gives us some flexibility. However we have to be fair to our outfitter and give him a chance to fill what we don't take. So, when we leave we provide a soft number commitment and a for sure start fo trip date. We have until January 1st to send the deposits. Each guy cuts a check for their deposit. We get together for a holiday luncheon in mid December and that is when the deposits are collected. Those making the deposit are locked in. Anyone on the fence may come in later but it is not for sure. If their is cabin space they can get in, if they are full....sorry. Our week in early June is usually full. Love our outfitter though. We have had family deaths that caused a few guys to miss the trip after committing to the deposit. Once he just rolled them in to everyone's bill as a discount, other times he rolled them into next years trip. More than fair."
5981098,Aspencreek,2018-02-02 16:54:00,2911,"Our trips are planned for me when we leave camp the year before. We go in groups of 6 and have a group of 4 every year, so filling the last 2 spots is not that difficult. BUT, it can be. we had 2 guys that were solid until a month and a half before leaving and both backed out. At that point we were left to scramble. So from that year forward, unless something unforseen happens (death, sickness, etc. Job related stuff is not unforseen, put in for your vacation time with your deposit) I collect a $200 deposit and it is NON-Refundable, unless it falls into the unforseen catagory. And I make sure that the deposit is paid to me, I pay the camp deposit, but it is due by Jan 1, this will ensure the fence sitters jump one way or the other. Each year we have 2-4 guys wanting to join us so the first ones in get in. I have tried to do the 8 man or 10 man trip but honestly it's a pain, way too many opinions, and ideas. And, this is a guy trip...no wives, no girlfriends, that is a hard and fast rule. We do things our way, if someone else wants to do something different or go someplace else, they are invited to plan their own trip, people have no idea how much time effort and work goes into putting this together, with very little gratitude. Lastly each one of us have a job to do around camp. Some cook, some do dishes, some clean all fish, some do other stuff. If you don't do your chores (and we have had a couple) you don't get invited back or invited NOT to come back. We had one guy who was new and when got to camp did nothing, and stated that HE was on vacation and cooking and cleaning was NOT something he did. It was a very long week for him."
5981114,ziggyzag,2018-02-02 17:14:00,125,"I am the trip organizer for our group, mostly family consisting of 10-14 people every other year. And as the trip organizer I will buy all the food and drink in advance and save the receipts which will be added all up and split among all attending the trip. We will gather all the deposits a year in advance and send to the outfitter. Once your deposit is in you will either attend the trip or you will need to fill your spot with someone of your choice and make arrangements with that person if he is receiving your credit for the deposit or he is refunding your deposit to you. Now lets say you have to back out at the last minute and I as the trip organizer need to scramble to fill your vacant spot you will not be receiving your deposit back and I will be offering your spot to the last minute person at a discounted price of your deposit to help off set the short notice. P.S. stjoeguy I have been on one of your trips and you do a great job with putting a great group of guys together and covering all the bases. And I hope to rejoin you group in one of the off years for our group soon, maybe in 2019?"
