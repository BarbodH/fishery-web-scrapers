We will fish at Eagle Lake again this year, for us it is more about having fun and catching fish. I switched to conservation license about 6 years ago. My uncle still buys the full license. We talked about the rule change with the conservation warden at the All Canada show in Green Bay, nice guy, our plans won't change this year."

5961178,Fisherman Ted,2018-01-22 14:44:00,461,"This just was pushed out to all Sunset Country Members in NW Ontario by Gerry Cariou, Executive Director. He definitely doesn't pull any punches: Tourism Really Does Matter - Except to the MNR The saying goes ""be silent and let your results do the talking"" and when it comes to the tourism industry in Sunset Country, this saying certainly applies. Year in and year out, the economic impact of tourist operators and in our towns, retail and services businesses, is apparent for all to see. Yet despite its economic impact, tourism still doesn't get the respect it deserves by many decision-makers and nowhere is this more apparent than those at the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. To politicians and MNR bureaucrats, tourists don't have a vote so that makes them an easy target and in a situation unique to Sunset Country, many tourism operators are themselves, American citizens, again with no vote and thus, of little concern to a politician's re-election chances. Unfortunately, these factors lead to bad policy in many cases and the recent decision by MNR to target only non-resident anglers in FMZ 5 with more restrictive regulations on walleye, amounts to throwing the baby out with the bath water. Let's be clear, everyone, including tourist outfitters, are in favor of conservation and protecting our fisheries for the long-term. If this regulation is necessary then it should be implemented. But only if the scientific data supports it and in the case of this new regulation in FMZ 5, the science (if it exists) is certainly questionable - or at least, the interpretation of that scientific data is questionable. We don't know either way since few if any recent fishery studies have been conducted. When it comes to the tourism industry their business depends on a healthy fishery. However, the recent decision by MNR to limit the daily walleye harvest in FMZ 5 for non-resident anglers only is neither good policy or, based on any recent scientific evidence. It is also a clear example of the lack of respect that MNR has for the tourism industry. When decisions like this are made, the decision-makers need to have evidence in support and they have to ensure they look at the whole picture - not just isolate one-user group while excluding all others and implement a punitive regulation that will have a negative impact on tourism. It is hard to believe the Ministry stating it's a ""conservation measure"" when the proposed regulation applies to one user group. The purported rationale for the new regulation coming out of MNR is based on data from 2013 that shows non-resident anglers account for 68% of fishing license sales in FMZ 5. From this data alone, and in absence of any recent scientific data e.g. creel surveys, population sampling of fish, etc.. the MNR makes the simplistic conclusion that non-resident anglers must account for 68% of the total harvest. As someone with a background in statistics, I can assure you implementing a regulation like this based solely on fishing license sales data is neither scientific nor academically acceptable. The old saying ""statistics don't lie but liars use statistics"" is definitely applicable here. Using the percentage of licenses sold does not consider other factors or gives us an accurate assessment of who is taking what. These include: Length of Stay: Looking only at the percentage of licenses sold to different user-groups does not take into account how long each non-resident angler is fishing in the region (on average 5 days per year) compared to resident anglers (who fish here all spring, summer, fall, and winter). You do the math, while there may be fewer licenses sold to residents, they fish many more times a year than non-residents do on a per capita basis, so their percentage of the total harvest on a per angler basis is higher and likely much higher than a non-resident. Angler Success: It also ignores ""angler-success"" - how successful each individual license holder is at actually harvesting fish. The logic here is that resident anglers, for the most part, live here all year-round and know the lakes much better than non-residents. As a result, it's plausible to conclude they are probably more successful than non-residents in finding and harvesting fish. Couple this with the fact that on a per angler basis, resident anglers fish significantly more days than non-residents, it is pretty easy to do the math and conclude that on a per capita basis, residents harvest more fish per angler and they harvest them more often. It's Not About ""Conservation"": It makes very little sense then if ""conservation"" is the reason this policy was introduced, why would only non-residents be targeted? While no one from MNR would ever admit it, the reason is because it is politically expedient to do so, as none of the voters are affected and (even though they have very little idea as to the true numbers of fish out there), being seen as doing something about the ""problem"" is all that really matters. Citing lousy or dated statistics to support the regulation only makes things worse, and reveals for all to see, the ""attack at all times"" philosophy the MNR has in regards to tourism. Unfortunately, what doesn't seem to matter to MNR is the potential negative impacts this has on our regional economy, specifically the fact that one group is treated differently than another and thus, is exempted from regulations that are being sold as a ""conservation measure"" and that is a bitter pill to swallow for the tourism industry. Again, the bottom line here is if it is about conservation, then the regulation should apply to all user groups - not just one that's easy to target. perhaps we should ask MNR why they exclude resident anglers and see what they say. The unfortunate truth is that MNR doesn't really have a handle on fish populations since they still cite creel survey data from 2005 and 2008 at the meetings I attend. Poor science and the misuse of statistical data has brought us to the point where we are now. We deserve better from MNR, yet the Ministry seems they have no problem using old data, bad statistics, and questionable ethics when they develop their policies. What makes it worse is the fact these regulations always seem to be targeted specifically at the tourism industry and their guests. It must be nice to sit in Ivory Towers and implement policies which affect the livelihood an entire industry. Tourism has been in a tough spot over the last decade and the MNR (and the CBSA) are two Government agencies which have made the situation much worse. Will this change? Not likely, in fact, I see the situation getting worse, not better. Until we demand proper science and accountable decision-making by those who work at MNR, the situation will likely stay the same - and that is truly shameful. If the science shows the need for the regulation then fine, implement it. However, this is a shot in the dark by MNR and they missed the target!"

5967386,MrSimon,2018-01-26 06:53:00,922,"I'm not convinced the ""eat 4 per day"" crowd is even that large. It's a lot of work to fillet and prepare fish TWICE per day. And as good as walleye is, who wants to eat it almost exclusively for a week straight?"
5967434,Obabikon,2018-01-26 07:30:00,2370,"I'm not sure that there's that many either, but I know that there are. There are also guys who only want to eat fish for lunch (no sides) and would eat 8 fillets for one meal. They will obviously be affected too."
5967514,prov1800,2018-01-26 08:43:00,5010,I do a number of weeks where they bring in a bus load of guys.(Not temple bay).ive seen some guys pound down fillets like there going out of style also.amazing.lol.we have BIG shorelunches at times with up to 30 + people.so each guide boat normally brings in two fish per person.that always seems to work out just fine.sometimes a couple of fillets left and sometimes not.these guys eat in the lodge at night so they don't need fish for supper.some might take fish home.some don't.they can all take sandwiches along and there are always days they do.and Fridays there are sandwiches as they have a early supper at camp before bus leaves.as a guide iam allowed 4 fish.so I can fry those up anytime also but there are also other species to catch and eat and I like frying up pike for guests cause it's amazing how many guys won't eat them due to the Y bones.those are easily taken out and are fantastic fish to eat also.lots of options for fisherman.there are no changes in zone 4.iam not sure why they didn't just do a province wide same rule.that would make more sense.but besides that fishing is great everywhere.eagle lakes walleye are really producing.the numbers of eating size fish is crazy as are a number of other lakes I vet to fish.evem though eagle and lac suel as well as cedar lake have commercial whitefish operations going on for as long as I can remember and there is some accidental catches going on fishing is stronger than ever.one lake however has had a crappie population somehow introduced somehow.???.they have exploded to the point I think it is affecting catching walleye.no these crappies are invasive in my book but yet they put a limit on them of 15 fish.you would think there shouldnt be a limit on them at all.just lime the rusty crayfish in eagle has trapping limits.so there conservation efforts are not all there cracked up to be.guys staying in zone 5 could (and I do take guys to zone 4)for a day of fishing at times and they are allowed 4 walleye there.so some contreversy could arise if wardens check freezers.
5967634,Wall-i-Lama,2018-01-26 09:31:00,1524,"So if I'm reading this right, since Lac Seul is in zone 4, they will be unaffected by this change. At Lac Seul, you can still keep 4 daily, with possession of 4?"

5969506,v-bay gord,2018-01-27 17:15:00,3168,"I've been away but spying on this thread. Interesting comments. Where to start? The crux of the matter is the regulation in question has been in effect along the border lakes for many years......but, as the MNR points out, they feel some lakes are still stressed. The solution to this dilemma? Host several years of consultations and then impose the same regulation (admittedly doesn't work worth a darn) on more of the NW region. Did the consultation suggest this alternative.....no. It was a top down decision. Political perhaps? Other agenda's that we don't know about? If it was truly a fisheries management decision then the science would back it up......whoops, there was only a one time fisheries monitoring survey done. The second round, which logically might show trends, or actual problems, hasn't been tabulated or interpreted. If one wanted an example of what does work, with plenty of MNR backed study and research, one would only have to look at Eagle Lake. What is truly confusing is the accusation that the non resident angler is responsible for the ""suggested"" problem.....hence the singling out of this user group. I don't agree with this approach. While the new regulation might put a damper on some of the worse meat hunters and resource exploiters (Prov's 30 man shore lunches come to mind....but they do eat sandwiches on Friday...) I'm not sure that this is the crux of the matter. No data of course to support this either. So, while I'm not disappointed that Tubby can't manage a shore lunch each day with a nice limit to take home I do see possible down sides as well. As has been pointed out keeping some bigger fish which would normally go back. On Eagle this would have to be a 23 plus inch fish. You would not get away with doing that more than once at pretty much any lodge on the lake. My ultimate concern is that the MNR (when I refer to MNR in this fashion, I mean the Toronto out of touch with reality crowd....I have a high regard for our local Districts, their personal, and commitment....but most often ignored) will continue with it's dumb down approach.....the broad brush theory.....and get rid of what is actually working in the region.......rather than actually looking at what is working and expand it. Tourism is vital to the NW region, and all lodge owners would support conservation efforts that work and are fair. After all, the experience is what is important, not a freezer full of stale fillets. Politics, you gotta love it........"
5969666,billy weaver,2018-01-27 19:03:00,470,"I was told that the daily catch limit is (2). You can't eat them and start over the same day even if the possession limit is (4). The same with a possession limit of (4) you can't eat them and start over the same day. Another thing for me as I usually take home a limit of (4) fish. My family who are not with me in Canada like a good mess of walleye. I usually try and take home a limit of fish (3) fish, 16 to 18 and one fish 21 or 22. This makes a nice dinner of fish at home for the family. It does seem that the DNR is saying to release the 22 and keep a 24 or larger. I follow the regulations and will continue to even if sometimes they don't make sense."
6002281,Guest,2018-02-13 21:45:00,0,"I think it is a good move to make the regulations more consistent from border waters and beyond. Regulations now are complex and vary so much, you need to be very careful to make sure to abide my the regulations. Further, and I know this may not be popular, I do not see a need for an individual to consume more than two fish a day. I will always favor erring on the side of conserving the resource."

5961682,Obabikon,2018-01-22 18:58:00,2370,"It has been this way for border lakes for a long time. So... there's not even any change for us.

They are also examples of how extremely low fishing pressure can lead to an aggressive and easy to catch fish population. If it were up to me, the rule would be ""eat 2 per day in camp under 18, but take NOTHING across the border"". Lots of guys would freak out at not being allowed to take fish home across the border, but can you imagine how good the fishing would get?"

5966570,fsz,2018-01-25 16:12:00,144,"It seems the lakes where walleye populations have crashed are those with commercial fishing of one form or another and/or heavy ice fishing use (Nippising comes to mind). My guess is the commercial harvest and ice fishing harvest (for walleye) are primarily and in most cases exclusively residents. So this rule confuses me. However, as a non-resident, I don't want to be responsible (for lack of a better term) for so-and-so lake having poor fishing because of non-resident pressure and harvest. So this rule I feel puts non-residents in a good position in that regard. From a public relations perspective, I do feel it just sends a message that us ""Yanks"" aren't really welcome by the MNR. I don't feel the average Canadian citizen feels that way however. Sometimes I don't understand the Ontario MNR. I've actually been to areas of Ontario where residents have ""No MNR"" signs on their property over other issues."
5967034,Obabikon,2018-01-25 20:11:00,2370,This rule really doesn't affect the take home guys. It does affect the guys who want to eat shore lunch and then fish again for dinner.

5967290,prov1800,2018-01-26 06:22:00,5010,If they are concerned about that why didn't they change the regs in zone 4 also.

I am a non-resident. I want to eat shore lunches every day, and take 4 fish home. How can this be accomplished? Day 1... I keep 2 fish. 1-18"" and 1-22"" fish. Legal. I am now going to eat the 22"" fish (because that is plenty to eat) and send the 18"" fish to the freezer. Day 2... I do the same thing. I can keep another 22"" fish, because I ate the first one. Day 3... I do the same thing. I can keep another 22"" fish, because I ate the big ones from the two previous days. Day 4... I now catch one 22"" fish in the morning, eat it, and then catch another 22"" fish in the afternoon. I have killed 5 large walleyes because it is against the rules for me to keep 2-3 small walleyes.

5945378,billy weaver,2018-01-13 19:14:00,470,I picked up some info on Eagle Lake last spring and a few friends and I were talking about a possible trip. Some questions that have been asked is the reduction in daily catch limits and no fish between 18 and 23 inches. It doesn't make any difference to me but it seems to make a difference to some. I wonder if this will impact any of the camps from a business stand point. I will be going to the QCCA Outdoor Show in Feb. and will ask one of the operators who is usually there what he thinks.
5945418,That Minnesota guy,2018-01-13 19:28:00,8293,"I'm a catch and release guy so the regulation change doesn't make any difference to me. But I have to ask, at what point does the lack of skill come into play? On some of these lakes in Canada it's nearly impossible not to catch a fish. Where does the hunt and skill come into play or don't guys care? Is it all about catching fish? Tightening the regulations will be good for the resource but at some point does it choke the lake with fish? I'm just curious."
5945866,Bill Krejca,2018-01-14 06:43:00,6107,Lakes that are choked with fish have a way of balancing the population. The net result is less fish. Bill
5946090,prov1800,2018-01-14 08:40:00,5010,"if you go to the fly outs that are catch and release seem to be doing fantastic.i would say those lakes are about as choked as you can get.i think those lakes regulate themselves pretty good.they all have good pike populations as well.nobody is going hungry.the larger lakes are so diverse that I don't think they will ever have a problem and the new regulations are just plain stupid and change nothing except confuse people.only thing I can see from the size limit that's causing a problem is most folks want a 17 1/2"" fish.seems hard to come up with those in most lakes as they are the most sought after.maybe those need to be protected."
5956474,Fisherman Ted,2018-01-20 04:28:00,461,The new regulations are a joke. Why in the world would you have different possession limits on the same body of water based on where you are from???? If you are truly trying to protect and manage a fishery you have the same rules for resident and non-resident anglers. So what does a lodge do when they have Canadians AND US residents fishing. They get to keep different numbers fishing at the same time? Baffling.
5956586,BornToFish,2018-01-20 06:50:00,1224,"Greetings,I was hoping that Fisherman Ted would respond to this thread as I was curious as to his thoughts on this matter. As I mentioned in my earlier post on this thread, I am quite confident that this recent change in regulations has very little (if anything) to do with management of the fisheries in Ontario. The MNR must have been hoping that American guests would accept the change in regulations as being driven by protecting the resource, when in reality this matter was very likely driven entirely by ""politics"".I would be scratching my head if I owned a fishing lodge in Ontario. The government of Canada/Ontario has a strange way of showing their love for owners of fishing lodges - a principle source of business - in NW Ontario. The government changes the regulations for possession limits, discontinues the HST rebate and leaves lodge owners to hear the complaints and deal with unhappy customers.Kindest regards...."
5956682,prov1800,2018-01-20 08:48:00,5010,Would not make much difference having a resident and no resident fisherman at a camp.how many fish would you like to bring in everyday.would you eat 4 fish per day.2 fish per person seems about right to me.the shorelunches I do are usually based on 2 per person and seems to work out good.if your looking to take 4 fish of each species home you are still able to do so.so nothing had changed there.as far as slot limits those have been in effect for ever and everybody I have talked to about are all for it.this new regulation only sounds bad and that's about it.a earlier post mentioned it would defer some day triplets crossing the border and taking fish back across the border.this might have something to do with it.i fish and guide on eagle lake and the guests I have had over the years really aren't going to care less.they eat a couple of shorelunches during the week and for the most part hardly any of them take fish home.i think it will be all good.

5957450,Guest,2018-01-20 18:23:00,0,In response to Big John at 1080 Provo. As an old guide from Eagle Lake area how can you in good conscience say that most buy conservation licenses and don't wish to take fish home. You worked at a camp where the buses came in and the fish were packed in dry ice in large quantities to go home. Almost no one bought conservation licenses. Almost all took home their Walleye limits and it was encouraged that the guides get fish limits for everyone to take home. As he said he prepares two fish per day per fisherman. I am there four days fishing. So if I eat my two fish per day I can't take any home unless I cheat and lie. So if I eat two at lunch and eat the evidence is anyone suggesting I catch one more after lunch and take one back to camp toward my 4 fish possession to take home? True sportsmen and women will abide by the rules but the Ministery makes it hard for the lodge owners to keep customers happy by making political decisions not based on the resource science..
5957490,prov1800,2018-01-20 18:55:00,5010,You must be talking 3 years ago when I Did some guiding for temple bay.yes that was a fish factory.i can't control what people want but even back then I had guests that didn't take fish home.i guide a number of weeks at north shore lodge.much calmer camp to work for and I don't have to punch a time clock.they do bus trips also.fishing is changing fast.lots of guys are more into conservation.some not.its up to individuals I guess.i just put people on fish.i can explain things to people and they can either except it or not.i just stick to the rules.if you needed to catch four fish a day you cam can still book a trip in zone 4.although in zone 5 you still do to take 4 home if you choose to do so..its a dumb reg I agree.but it's there so we just have to live with it.
5943802,billy weaver,2018-01-12 19:15:00,470,I have been fishing the same Canadian lake on the same week for thirty years. The fishing in the last ten years has been much better than it was the first ten years. I don't think the change would impact our group much. I usually spend a day or two fishing for other species other than walleye. I never have caught a 45 inch pike but keep trying and love a good mess of yellow perch fillets. I can still bring home a limit of four for the family keeping a limit of two on two days.
5943970,Baseline,2018-01-12 21:13:00,3207,"http://files.ontario.ca/environment-...-5-english.pdf This is the 2018 regs for Zone 5 and I see not general reduction of daily possession limit. There are lots of special regs, but I don't see anything specifically regulating non-residents except for Rainy. Maybe I overlooked it."

5944322,Guest,2018-01-13 08:31:00,0,Page 24 in Ontario Rule Book Non Resident page. Talked with resort owner Friday he already had 6 cancelations.
5944418,martinbns,2018-01-13 09:22:00,1520,"No change for residents, which is fine with me. My wife and I go pretty much every sunday, generally keep three fish in the 17"" range which is the right amount for us for a meal. At the end of the season I don't even have 8 in the freezer, just two meals in separate bags. We probably caught 800 walleye last year and kept maybe 30 over the summer. I think we only kept two fish over 18"" all year both in the 20"" range and those days it was the only fish we kept. We had our kids visit once where we kept our full limit and another day one of my co-workers wanted a meal for her family so we brought her 6 fish filleted with the skin on. Everyone needs to respect the resource and placing limits on non-residents that are lower is cool with me."
5944434,prov1800,2018-01-13 09:30:00,5010,Strange anyone cancelling.nothing much had changed except the daily limit to keep.you can still catch all the fish you want throughout the day.you still get to keep 4 at the end of the week.if you do shorelunch I would think 2 walleye would do per person.theres always other species to eat.if you do shorelunch then you just can't keep any more if you intend on having them for supper.like I said there's other fish to eat.i agree it's a dumb rule but in the end it's all good.meat hunters might be the ones that are frowing on this and might want to book in a zone where they can bring mote fish in daily to eat.
5944490,Golden Eagle,2018-01-13 09:45:00,2642,Better care walleyes when catching and releasing would help. Would help a lot.Improved catching success is happening. Not so with protecting caught and released fish. Fishermen need to be educated about handling released fish.Would also help if we could convince pike that whitefish are better tasting than walleyes.
5944586,prov1800,2018-01-13 10:44:00,5010,The catch and releasing properly would be good.its the deep fishing that's the worst.
5945090,Wall-i-Lama,2018-01-13 16:46:00,1524,"So here is what I think the meat hounds will do....let's say it's Sunday, first day out on their trip. They want a fish fry on Sunday evening. They used to be able to keep 4 nice eaters (15 to 17"") fish for fish fry. Now, they are limited to 2 fish. I'll bet their soulution will be to keep one over the slot, so they still have the same poundage for dinner. For myself, two small fish is more than enough for dinner. But for 30 years I've seen the meat hounds and two smaller walleye are not going to cut it, especially LOTW where the fish are on the skinny side. So question is, will it hurt the fishery more if these guys start pulling in fish from above the slot just to fill the skillet? Personally, I'd rather see them eat the small fish and leave those over the slot alone. But, I don't think that is going to happen."
5935754,runuts2,2018-01-08 10:51:00,25,The Dryden Observer had an article last week suggesting walleye limits will be reduced this year. Anyone heard anything?
5935802,v-bay gord,2018-01-08 11:01:00,3168,"In fisheries management zone 5 the daily limit is reduced from 4 to 2 for walleye. The possession limit remains 4. Lake trout daily limit goes from 2 to 1.......possession limit remains 2. Effective January 1, 2018."
5935818,Obabikon,2018-01-08 11:03:00,2370,They had been talking about doing this for quite a while. Basically making it the same as for border lakes.
5936522,yoopertrout,2018-01-08 17:54:00,1172,"If it's needed to keep the fishing good, it's fine with me. When I travel to Canada, it's all about the fun, and not much about getting food. We ate two meals last time we went up for a week, and I could easily live with catch and release. I think Ontario has done a nice job of remembering to appreciate what they have before it's gone."
5941610,prov1800,2018-01-11 14:20:00,5010,when I read this change my first thought was how is this going to do anything.i still think the same way.not going to help or make anything better.what a waste of paper work once again.I could see changing the take home limit to two but this change makes zero sense to me.most fisherman I deal with all seem to get the conservation license and a lot of them don't want to take any fish home.if they really want to save fish they need to look at stopping fisherman from fishing to deep and cutting back on shorelunches that's where all the damage is done.just my 2 cents.
5942514,Obabikon,2018-01-12 07:23:00,2370,I think a lot of things are done simply so they can say they did something.Most places in zone 5 right now are as good or better than they have ever been when considering walleye fishing. What are they trying to change?
5942594,BornToFish,2018-01-12 07:51:00,1224,"Greetings,I first heard about this rule change about two years ago. I don't have first hand information about this change in Ontario law, so there is always a chance that I have mis-information.I understand this change in law was initially implemented in the fish management zones adjacent to the US/Canada border. I understand the purpose of this law was to discourage ""day trippers"" from the US. This law seemed reasonable given that ""day trippers"" were taking home daily limits of walleyes (and other species of fish) without contributing anything meaningful to the economy of Ontario/Canada. Lakes near the border were seeing their walleye populations steadily being depleted, while Ontario was getting little to nothing in return.I understand that the expansion of this law into new regions of Ontario had virtually nothing to do with management of fisheries. My clear suspicion is that this change in law was driven purely by ""politics"". I suspect that a group of fishing lodge owners believed that the initial law was leaving them disadvantaged in business. If so, these lodge owners may have been seeing prospective guests going further ""north"" to have access to more liberal bag limits. If so, these lodge owners wanted a more level playing field. Thus, they were able to get the law changed.The above scenario seems reasonable to me. Again, the above is based on speculation on my part, without first-hand information.I doubt that the new change in law will make much difference to most American guests fishing at fishing lodge in Ontario. They might have to adjust their shore lunch schedule to accommodate the new possession limits. Guests wanting fish to take home can freeze two walleyes on Thursday, and another two walleyes on Friday, so they have their possession limit to take home with them on Saturday morning.I'm wondering how residents of Ontario will feel about this change in law. I'm thinking of a guy wanting to fish on his day off (e.g. Saturday) such that he can have a fish fry with his wife/family. I suspect that more residents of Ontario might be bothered by the change in law than American guests at fishing lodges.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5942610,prov1800,2018-01-12 07:52:00,5010,Exactly.if they want to make a change take the limit of crappies.there a invasive species over here by us.ive never heard of a limit on a invasive species.
5943722,Skywagon,2018-01-12 17:16:00,1106,"The new 2 walleye per day rule only applies to non-residents, Ontario residents are still allowed the 4 walleye daily limit. I personally don't think it makes a big difference anyway, eating two fish per day should be enough for most anyone while you are here."
5943778,Golden Eagle,2018-01-12 18:38:00,2642,Easy for you to say. Two of the size I catch won't fill a hungry fisherman.
