6602424,steve.a,2021-10-09 07:35:00,274,I was at Nestor Falls last week and decided not to go there because of the low water. Turns out we found the crappie closer to us. We kept everyone we caught regardless of size to get our limit because they would not survive as they were in 40 ft. of water. After our limit we did not fish there any more. Years ago we use to see a lot of floating crappies around places like Hay island area.
