5996073,cnsrtv308,2018-02-10 23:39:00,4,"I would absolutely check out out Tamarack Island Wilderness Lodge of LOTW. The fishing is top notch. Musky, pike, walleye, small mouth bass. Tamarack is truly in the heart of one of the greatest fisheries Canada has to offer. Tamarack is on an island, next closest camp is about 8 miles away. So you wake up and fish what others are still boating to. The island is about a 20/30 minute boat ride from Morson Ont, paved roads all the way to the marina. No gravel roads to deal with.Todd, the owner of the camp is a great guy and runs an awesome camp! The guy really goes out of his way to make sure your trip is great."
5996665,Obabikon,2018-02-11 09:57:00,2370,"Give Todd at Tamarack a try, but he is swamped. If you can't get in, check out.... Grassy Narrows Lodge Miles Bay Camp Both out of Morson, both great resorts run by awesome people!"
5996889,billy weaver,2018-02-11 11:59:00,470,"I can recommend Peffley's on Wabaskang. There are many camps in the Perrault Falls area and I have good reports on most of them. The only thing is booking a camp for a week in June. I like Wabaskang because it is a very easy lake to fish, with few hazards and good fishing."
5996929,vassago,2018-02-11 12:22:00,103,"I would suggest Ash Rapids Lodge on lotw.It's remote wilderness with a 20 min boat ride from clearwater Bay just east of kenora. you can use your own boat. The lodge is a perfect gateway to Shoal Lake which is one of the greatest bass, walleye and pike fisheries in North America at that time of the year. Folks are nice there, acccomation is very comfortable and upscale. restaurant serves the best fillet mignon you will find on the water anywhere. http://ashrapidslodge.caI don't stay there because I live 2 hrs away but go there regularly for fuel and bait when I'm fishing and camping in the area.According to google maps it's 13 hrs from Chicago Have a fun trip!!

5998305,The tank,2018-02-12 09:54:00,340,I second grassy narrows and miles bay camp. I have stayed at both. still go to miles bay twice a year.
6000145,Aspencreek,2018-02-13 06:43:00,2911,"You may be very limited to where you can go because of the time frame and it's mid Feb already. You guys need to start figuring this out sooner to get a better selection for camps that MIGHT even have openings at that time. I am also going to assume (I understand I shouldn't)that you are trying to drive it all in one leg, but consider driving from home to someplace between Duluth and or all the way to Ft Francis and then the rest of the trip the next day. We stay the night before in Ft Francis at the Super 8, it is then an easy drive up to our camp on Lac Seul. But from Chicago to Duluth is 8 hrs (depending on where you are in CHI) and not a stop sign until you get into Superior, easy drive, particularly if you have more than 1 driver. If that is too much of a drive divide it up again say Home to Eau Claire 6 hrs, EC to Ft Francis 5 to 6 hrs, and then into camp."
6000825,prov1800,2018-02-13 09:52:00,5010,Might as well checkout Clarke's northern lights resort on cedar lake.great camp all 17 ' boats with 50 hp and free bait.good lake to fish all species including some fantastic crappy to boot.easy to navigate all rocks are marked.
6002073,ElectricSlide19,2018-02-13 19:24:00,147,"Thanks to all for the suggestions. I gave heavy thought to booking at Tamarack and Todd was great at answering all my questions. unfortunately at the time we did not have the numbers he needed to book the big cabin at the lodge. So we actually booked a private cabin via Air BnB that is right across the bay from Gill's Marina. I hope to get a chance that week to stop and see Todd along with seeing Obabikon Bay camp for future endeavors in the Morson Area. Looks like the trip will be just over 11 hours for us driving so we will be doing it all in one day. Let the countdown begin! For anyone that has fished Morson, ON during that time frame any advice will be appreciated!"
5953090,ElectricSlide19,2018-01-17 20:15:00,147,Hello all! Had help last year finding a camp from suggestions from you all so I thought I would ask for advice again. Looking for a drive in or boat in lodge housekeeping bring your own boats for 5-6 guys. Have 2 older gentlemen in our group so we would like to limit the travel to 3 hours north of the border. Looking for walleye and pike fishery with a more remote feel to it. Please let me know what you all have in mind! Obviously we need to book something soon to avoid places already being booked! Thanks!
5953138,That Minnesota guy,2018-01-17 20:41:00,8293,"What did you find lacking in the camp you went to last year? That might help us recommend something. Also, where are you coming from?"
5953186,ElectricSlide19,2018-01-17 21:48:00,147,"We were at Anglers Kingdom on Nungesser Lake last year. Love the fishing there, but the drive is killer with older folks and we didn't get to use our own boats. So looking for same quality but with our own boats and less of a drive! Would be coming from Chicago, IL"
5953242,FishermanTom81,2018-01-18 00:09:00,15,"Check out Tamarack Island Wilderness Lodge on LOTW. It is a boat in lodge near Morson, On. I live in the SW suburbs of Chicago and it is about a 12 hour trip for me, only about 45min over the boarder. Since it is boat in not too many other resorts are nearby so you get the feel of a remote location without having to drive forever. As for the fishing, it is incredible! World class muskie, bass, and walleye, and very good pike. I go in a group of 2-3 and each of the last 4 years we have all gotten at least one pike over 40"" and countless walleye.http://www.tamarackislandwildernesslodge.com/In the picture below my Dad caught a 38"" pike on a jighead, if you look in the background you will see Tamarack. You do not have to go far for good fishing."
5953642,Mike Borger,2018-01-18 08:01:00,1554,"Holinshead Lake Camp if you can get a booking for that date. I would assume you can bring your own boats, it's a drive to camp and there's a launch there. But there's no mention of that on their website.http://www.holinshead.ca/"
5953994,The tank,2018-01-18 10:07:00,340,check out Labellas birch point camp on rainy lake.it a hour across the border. can't keep many on rainy but the walleye and pike fishing is really good and small mouth is stupid good.
5954010,cnsrtv308,2018-01-18 10:15:00,4,"I would highly recommend Tamarack Island Wilderness Lodge on LOTW. It's a boat-in camp out of Morson Ontario which is only about an hour drive from the boarder crossing over at Baudett Mn. My buddy and I have been going up there for well over ten years now and the fishing is fantastic! Todd the owner and his family run a great camp. Super friendly and very accommodating. The camp is about a twenty minute boat ride from Morson and there are no other camps within miles of him, so you don't have tons of pressure to deal with. I got my P/B pike there (43"") last year, lots of muskie, great walleye, pretty much everything you could want."
5963906,stumcfar,2018-01-24 08:27:00,451,"It probably won't get you the super remote feeling, but Gawley's Little Beaver Camp on Lac Seul is a very inexpensive way to go if you have your own boats. Not a lodge, but very adequate cabins and a small camp with only 3 cabins. We enjoyed our stay there last year."
5965738,Anglin Andy,2018-01-25 08:51:00,100,"I would also highly recommend Gawley's Little Beaver Lodge (Doug and Gayle) on Lac Seul near Ear Falls. They have a small resort which is very clean, great docks, electric hook up for charging your TM's, Great Fish Cleaning House, free ice (which is all included in your nightly fee per person of $70, not including tax). You will be fishing close in the Steamboat Narrows and/or Sawmill area along with the many islands and reefs nearby. I take two trips yearly to Gawley's and will also be there from June 27- July 1. Let me know if I can help in any way. Dave"
5966178,wally28,2018-01-25 11:57:00,65,How about Peffleys Camp of Wabaskang Lake out of Perrault Falls?
