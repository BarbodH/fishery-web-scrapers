6010889,pjshorthorn,2018-02-18 16:14:00,5654,I'm glad we don't have black flies down here in Georgia otherwise I may have had to cancel out on next month's camp out and fishing adventure.......knowing you would set a boat mate up with dead minnows under their seat and who knows where else. Bring that bug-a-salt with you just in case my karate moves don't work on the bears See you and Ace in a few weeks. PjShorthorn
6010905,pjshorthorn,2018-02-18 16:18:00,5654,We will see how friendly you are when I slap you in the face with the first walleye I catch in the boat. Oooohhhh.....the gauntlet has been thrown down now. PjShorthorn
6006137,TexFly,2018-02-15 16:40:00,23,"Camoclad, which outfitter are you fishing with on Wabakimi? We use Rusty Myers. We will be there July 24-30. Our group has fished there in mid June, but usually fish the 3rd week of July. Finding fish has never been a problem in 12-24' of water. The weather has already been covered, plan on at least a rain day. We have never had to endure a mayfly hatch. The mosquitos are usually there in the evening and biting flies on the lake during the day. I have been going to Wabakimi yearly since 2007. Most of our group has been going for 35+ yrs. The temps are always great for me, since I'm coming from S. Texas where it is usually over 100 deg with 90+% humidity. Good Luck"
6006353,Camoclad,2018-02-15 19:00:00,628,"Hi Tex, we will be there with PFO. Really looking forward to it. We have fished Kenoji, and Coles a couple times with PFO too. This is the latest we have gone, normally we have gone at the end of May first week of June. My brothers first trip to Canada was at Wabakimi and that is what got us all hooked when he came back telling about the trip and sharing his photos. We have a mixed bag in our group of 8 this year with about half of us that fish a lot throughout the year and the other half who this will be their first trip. We will definitely have the rain gear, And ready to fish just about any conditions (except storms or really high wind). Like you, we are coming from pretty warm weather here in Georgia so those cool nights are refreshing. Thanks for the input and I hope you have a great trip as well!"
6006409,billy weaver,2018-02-15 19:20:00,470,The fishing wasn't bad the two or three times I went in July but the deer flies about drove me crazy biting my ankles. Every time I would go to shore or near I would pick up another batch in the bottom of the boat. The darn things would bite my ankles through two pairs of socks. The second year I took a can of Yard Guard and would spray the bottom of the boat when I got out away from shore. I would then be good until I got to shore to pick up another load. Them little suckers can really bite.
6006417,TexFly,2018-02-15 19:25:00,23,"It doesn't take much wind to make the main body of the lake very rough. At least the PFO boats have the highest HP on the lake. There is lots of good fishing on the North end of the lake, even with a wind. I usually try to catch our walleye dinner first, then target Northerns on a fly."
6006705,Camoclad,2018-02-16 05:26:00,628,"That was one of the things my brother said after his first trip, how the wind could make the big water pretty rough. We fish a lot like you have described, we catch our dinner then decide if we want to target some pike, go exploring and fish in some areas that look good on the map, etc. I think the biggest change for us will be fishing a little deeper water. In early June the fish are often still shallow, 8ft or less most of the time. Of course we will all take more tackle than we need and will still try it shallow before we heed everyone's advice to target 10-20 ft! The best part of the whole trip is just being there. There is a calm that comes over me when the plane leaves that I have never been able to replicate anywhere in the world. Seven days with friends and family, no worries, no electronics is worth every penny even if we don't catch a thing. Can't wait, only 133 days (but who is counting)!"
6006713,Camoclad,2018-02-16 05:29:00,628,"We grew up in Clinton, so no stranger to the bugs on the river in summer, but the flies up north that bite through your clothes are tough to deal with! Thanks for the advice, we try to keep the boats as clean and dry as possible, the yard guard is a great suggestion for the packing list!"
6009585,7thCrowWing,2018-02-17 19:01:00,132,"so as long as everyone is on the bug topic what about a typical 1st week of June Tamarack Island LOTW, most every trip I have taken tom Canada has been fall = no bugs, never been in June."
6009785,fishmanric,2018-02-18 04:43:00,219,"We fished Lac Seul last year during the first week in July and will be doing so again this year. We had a huge Mayfly hatch last year that we didn't adjust to well early in the week. After much investigation, I have come to the conclusion, that finding the wind blown bays with a slower presentation might be the ticket. Most of our fish were caught in the 18-30 fow on offshore humps and breaks. Also caught many on flats in 20 fow. We didn't have any problem with bugs but some of our newbies got caught in those Canadian micro bursts that seem to pop up out of nowhere."
6010449,jkaup,2018-02-18 11:07:00,56,The black flies won't stand a chance with my bug-a-salt at hand! Iv'e been target practicing!I hear the best way to keep the flies off of you in the boat is to sneak a dead minnow under your fishing partners seat! They bit me through the woven front part of my tennis shoes. Then my foot itched to no end the rest of the day.
6010553,jkaup,2018-02-18 12:08:00,56,"It was really funny the first time my wife and I went to Wabakimi. The first 3 days the other camps were empty. Our camp owner had taken us out fishing and locked in on the fish. 16 ft deep was the only place we could get a bite. On the 4th day we saw other camp boat fishing on our way to our spot. I was of the understanding that folks on the water were happy and friendly. These old timers reminded me of the movie Grumpy old Men. They couldn't even bother to throw up even the slightest smile or wave of the hand. They had all the fancy gear. From the vest to the fish counter to the fish finder. You name it, they brought it. We went to our spot, back trolled, caught our lunch and left for some pike casting. The other boats had not even reeled in one fish. When we went to a different spot we boated close enough to see if they were still fishing. Of course they were right in the spot we left! We would have been happy to share any info with them. Like I said, I thought boaters/fishermen were friendly. Especially on a once in a lifetime trip to the Great White North! So, here is my point...don't try for days in the same spot that produced fish in years past. Gramps always said if you don't get a bite in 20 min. move, change it up. And for all those going the first week in July to Wabakimi, feel welcome to approach any of us in a PFO boat! We are all friendly fishing folk!"
5875353,Camoclad,2017-11-28 17:49:00,628,"We will be fishing July 1-7 on Wabakimi and was curious what others have experienced in terms of weather, fishing, bugs, etc. this time of the year. All of our previous trips were a month or so earlier and we usually had cool, rainy weather, the fish were pretty shallow and bugs were not too bad unless the air was still. We are looking forward to the trip and will deal with whatever conditions we encounter, just wanted to see what others have experienced in early July. Thanks!"
5875601,BornToFish,2017-11-28 19:47:00,1224,"Greetings,My wife and I have been fishing in Sunset Country the last few seasons during the first week of July. Fishing during this week for the last two seasons was quite different from each other.We fished for our walleyes during the first week of July in 2016 in 15-18 fow on rock humps that were fairly close to shore. The same week in 2017 saw us fishing in 24-28 fow on mid-lake rock humps. We caught good numbers and size of walleyes during both weeks, just in different places.I believe the single biggest factor for the different patterns was the weather in May/June of 2017. Ice-out came early, but then it just did not warm up. The walleyes moved deep, early on in 2017 and just chose to stay there throughout the season.I would rate the bugs as being the same in both 2016 and 2017. We caught the tail end of the black flies during both years. Mosquitoes were present, especially in the early morning and at dusk. I encourage you to bring a full can of your favorite bug spray.You will likely find that the weather during early July is starting to get as stable in NW Ontario as it will get. You will likely want a sweatshirt in the mornings, but may encounter exceptionally warm temperatures during the daytime. Raingear shouldn't be too far away. Wind can certainly be a factor.Some anglers comment that the may fly hatch in July can be problematic for them on certain bodies of water. Honestly, they haven't been a concern for me.I believe that you will find the fishing to be good during early July, assuming you had good fishing on this lake earlier in the season. You will almost certainly be encountering different patterns during July than what you are accustomed to fishing during early June. Be flexible in where and how you fish! You may find yourself struggling in July if you fish the same places and patterns as you do in early June - sort of like pounding a square peg into a round hole.Fish on the Canada Shield go through seasonal progressions. June is often a time of considerable change for the fish in view of (normally) steadily warming water temperature and emerging weeds. Since you don't have experience on this lake during early July, I encourage you to decipher as quickly as you can where the fish are in their seasonal progression. This understanding will allow you to focus on effective fishing techniques and presentations. For example, you might want to hire a guide for a day, or at least talk with the lodge owner or others at the dock.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5876169,MrSimon,2017-11-29 07:03:00,922,"BornToFish hit the nail on the head. Not too much to add really. I would emphasize what he said about the Spring conditions dictating where the fish are in early July. They won't be shallow, but they might not be all the way out into the main basin areas either. Water temp will be the most important thing to check when you arrive. Ask around in camp too. Once you find them, chances are you can set up on them all week and have a great time! The skeeters will be murder in the evening."
5876201,Camoclad,2017-11-29 07:08:00,628,Thank you for the detailed information. I appreciate it very much! We are looking forward to fishing and seeing some of these differences firsthand. We will definitely keep an eye on the early season conditions as we prepare for the trip. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
5876289,Bill Krejca,2017-11-29 07:49:00,6107,"Can be very good fishing, it all depends on the weather, as already stated. The bugs can be murderous on shore on windless day, evening campfires can be potentially masochistic to experience. Mayflies may be a factor, again, depending on weather, and water warming conditions, some folks feel this can be managed, I usually am not that fortunate, or maybe skillful(?) and prefer being there either before or after. Also heat can be a factor while on the water, be prepared for every possible scenario. Ala in all, if you are there, it still is better than being at work!! Bill"
5876473,Camoclad,2017-11-29 10:16:00,628,"For sure, much better than work! Maybe the Mayflies will spare us for this week too. Thanks for the response."
5877633,adempsey2.0,2017-11-29 19:50:00,612,"I go on a trip at that time every year for the past 10+ years. However, the closest I've been to Wabakimi at that time was when I went to Kagianagami.The Walleye were still migrating from their spawning locations. The odd few were in summer spots, but most of the fish were still coming in. The fishing at the rivers was amazing. The main lake, not so much. However, ice out was late that year. All you can do is prepare for it all. Almost every trip (although, most aren't that far north in July) I've hit Mayflies. Sometimes the Walleye were already in the summer spots, sometimes not. So, you won't get a definitive answer...it's basically impossible. Once ice out happens, you might have a better idea though."
5878017,Baseline,2017-11-30 06:40:00,3207,I think everyone has covered just about all the fishing possibilities. The only thing I don't like about fishing trips in late June - July and early August are the bugs. Especially when the mosquitoes fly in the early evening.
5878441,Camoclad,2017-11-30 10:25:00,628,"Thank you for the info, I realize we will have to wait and see what's up when the time gets here but these pieces of information that you and others have shared are helpful. We have encountered the Mayflies on a previous trip and while it didn't shut down the bite, it did become a bit more difficult to catch the numbers were were accustomed to. Toughest part of all will be the wait between now and then!"
5878465,Camoclad,2017-11-30 10:30:00,628,"I am sure the bugs will be a unique part of the experience...maybe we will get lucky and have some breezy afternoons and evenings. First guy that leaves the cabin door ajar is gonna catch heck though (unless it was me, then it was an accident of course)! Thanks for the feedback."
