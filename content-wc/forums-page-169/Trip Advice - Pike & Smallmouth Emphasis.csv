5970866,Finquest,2018-01-28 14:48:00,24,"Thank you for all of the great information.Our concern about Shoal Lake is the potential for big waves in the area where you caught the majority of your fish. The lodge doesn't offer up-graded boats; although, the guides do use bigger/better/faster boats. If you stray very far from sheltered water, its very hard to quickly get to safety with a 15 hp motor. Consequently, we will have to avoid the vast majority of this lake if there is even a hint of strong wind in the forecast. Given the openness of this lake it may not even take that strong of a wind to build dangerous wave conditions. We are wondering if there are enough relatively sheltered good fishing spots close to the lodge to satisfy the number of fishermen staying there???"
5971034,jackpotjohnny48,2018-01-28 16:18:00,153,"As far as wind / big waves are concerned - Yes, I understand your concern. When you look at a map of Shoal, it definitely is a big open basin (in certain areas / notably the southern portion), but we never had a problem with big waves (when we were actually fishing in Shoal).The big open water waves presented more of a problem as we were actually traveling into Shoal, but not after we arrived on the scene. Ash Rapids Camp is located at N 49 37.684 by W 94 45.649 Shoal Lake Lodge is located at N 49 34.766 by W 95 00.644. So Shoal Lake Lodge is about 12 miles (straight line distance) SW of Ash Rapids. The actual travel distance by water (accounting for turns around islands and peninsulas) is about 15 or 16 miles.Given that the prevailing wind direction is out of the west or southwest, you may face challenges on a windy day if you are trying to enter Shoal Lake from the Labyrinth Bay area of LOTW. When you get to the little island just north of Spike Point, you may be staring into some pretty big whitecaps for the final 5 to 7 miles of your journey toward Shoal Lake Lodge. However, we always found plenty of fishable and relatively calm water as we got closer to Shoal Lake Lodge.We mainly fished the areas from Matineau Island and Galt Island to Dominique Island, Stevens Island, and Cameron Island. There's nothing necessarily magical about those islands, because I think the entirety of Shoal Lake is absolutely loaded with fish.The reason we fished in the area listed above is because Shoal Lake is only charted in the northern half and the northeast side. The southern portion is uncharted. Given that we wanted to avoid hitting any rock reefs we didn't venture into any of the uncharted water. And even saying that, we still proceeded very slowly and with caution. I think rock reefs on Shoal pose far more of a hazard than wind does. I have only spent 5 days fishing on Shoal, and each time I had to travel from the Ash Rapids area down through Labyrinth Bay. As mentioned, the roughest portion of the trip was always from the island just north of Spike Point to about Martineau Island.Once you get to Martineau, you can troll your way through the maze of islands between Martineau and the Stevens / Dominique area.But you need to proceed slowly, no matter where you are on Shoal, because there are a ton of reefs that are hittable if you venture off of the main travel route.When traveling at speeds above 10 mph, we always retraced our exact steps via GPS, to make sure that we were never in danger of hitting a reef.When traveling ""off the beaten path"" we were always trolling at 2.8 to 3.8 mph, so the rock reefs didn't pose much of a challenge.So my opinion on Shoal is that the reefs are a much bigger threat than the wind.If you want to take wind mostly out of the equation, then your best bet would be to stay at Shoal Lake Lodge, to minimize your exposure to the SW winds that hit the Spike Point area pretty hard. If you're staying at Shoal Lake Lodge, you don't have to cross that open water on a daily basis.There's a bunch of water north of Shoal Lake Lodge (Bag Bay area) as well as west of Shoal Lake Lodge (Potato Island and Twin Lake area) where I think you would definitely find calm water on most days as well. To be honest though, we had such great fishing in the areas between and around Martinique to Dominque / Stevens, that we never ventured anywhere else.Given that we were traveling such a great distance to fish Shoal, our actual fishing time each day was a bit too limited to allow for a whole lot of exploration time. So we just continued to do what was working. If I ever fish Shoal again, I will most likely stay at Shoal Lake Lodge, because their location on the lake greatly eliminates most of your concerns about big wind.As I said, I never stayed there as a paying guest, but I just dropped in unannounced and asked the owner if he would give us a tour. He gave us about a 45 minute tour, and I was very impressed. It's absolutely beautiful! Absolutely looks like a first class operation. The stone walking path through the trees is alone worth the price of admission. The camp appears to be in immaculate condition.And as far as the fishing goes, it's a really special body of water."
5971106,Bill Krejca,2018-01-28 16:30:00,6107,"Obabikon Bay would be a good choice. You would have to contend with those darn crappies occasionally, tho!! Bill"
5982146,Finquest,2018-02-03 09:57:00,24,"Last chance for any more suggestions on where to go. We are meeting today to make our choice, so I have to finalize my research soon.I want to thank everyone for all of the responses so far. You've led me to some real good contenders."
5982786,robm_mb,2018-02-03 19:49:00,48,"Another vote for shoal as a premiere pike and smallie destination, whether you stay at Ash Rapids or Shoal Lake Lodge. One big thing I consider to be an advantage of Shoal over LOTW proper is the level of boat traffic on shoal - far less. Most days you might see a handful of boats throughout the day if you're lucky depending on what part of the lake you're on, I don't think the same can be said for many areas of LOTW."
5968138,bthomas3333,2018-01-26 14:19:00,465,I have fished Witch Bay. It was early June and we found the Smallie Fishing to be pretty strong. The fun part of Pike fishing is the occasional Muskie. They are also on a long arm of LOTW which allows you to feel like you are on a smaller lake. They have some new cabins which are REALLY nice. Food was decent and the staff was very nice.We enjoyed our stay.B
5968162,Finquest,2018-01-26 14:26:00,24,"I am hoping jigging for walleye is different from what we were doing this Fall. We were just holding the jig steady about 10 inches off the bottom in 22 feet of water and then waiting for an extremely light bite. After a long morning of trying to chase wipers around the lake it was hard to keep up the concentration needed to do this. One of us almost fell asleep, and he was the one catching the most fish. We definitely prefer fishing techniques that require more action on the part of the angler, so that kind of jigging would be a last resort."
5968218,Finquest,2018-01-26 14:40:00,24,"We don't want to drag our boats up there, especially since we don't know the waters. I understand the Canadian shield lakes have a fair amount of unseen rocks just waiting to wreck a lower unit or worse. I imagine the rentals at some of the camps have seen their share of scrapes and dents.Good to know about the holiday weekend on Aug. 6. I'll check out the Winnipeg river and Witch Bay camp. Thanks"
5968250,adempsey2.0,2018-01-26 15:21:00,612,"That screams Lake of the Woods to me. Take your pick of lodges, a lot great places. Obabikon Bay Camp is one.Eagle (e.g., Andy Myer's Lodge) and Shoal Lake (e.g. Ash Rapids Lodge) as well."
5968914,Ruddiger,2018-01-27 08:13:00,649,"Howdy, I have been to a lot of different lodges and resorts in Canada, including on lake of the woods. For what you are looking for I can't recommend Witch Bay Camp enough. Witch Bay is BY FAR the best ran fishing camp I have ever been to, and its not even close. This is not a slam on their competition, but more of a compliment to their extra efforts. It's really a great place. The guide program is a wonderful option to guests and their camp boats are really top notch. The owners, Gail and Steve, are great people and the food is excellent. I normally HATE American Plan but I have no problems with their meals at all. Neither does my 13 year old daughter who has been going there with me the last three years. As far as targeting Pike and Smallies go, I think you would be better served going closer to June if you can get in. By late July the pike are transitioned out of the shallows and the bass are starting to move out as well. Where as in June, they are all still shallow and accessible. Either way I'm sure you will enjoy your stay. Take care, Ruddiger"
5969410,yoopertrout,2018-01-27 16:24:00,1172,I think you'll find fishing jigs for walleye to be more varied and active than that.
5969546,Finquest,2018-01-27 17:59:00,24,Shoal Lake Lodge was at the Kansas City Sportshow last weekend and is on our radar. The main concern is the wind on such a large open lake. Is there really enough good relatively sheltered fishing close to the lodge to keep us going on windy days?
5969570,Finquest,2018-01-27 18:09:00,24,"Thanks for the help; that is good to know. It puts walleye jigging higher on our priority list. Our group has caught about everything that swims in the Missouri/Kansas area, but we are mainly largemouth bass fisherman. Consequently, I am guessing that we may be more comfortable casting for pike and smallmouth as our main method.I'd like to explore more on the topic of walleye jigging once we pick a place."
5970522,jackpotjohnny48,2018-01-28 10:24:00,153,"Go to Shoal Lake, off of Lake of the Woods.I have fished it a couple of times (long boat ride to get into there) while staying at other places. The last time I fished it, I was staying at Ash Rapids Camp, and just boated in there from the Ash Rapids area.However, I did stop in at Shoal Lake Lodge, and checked out the accommodations / took a tour of the island. It is absolutely beautiful. I would stay there in a heartbeat.Now, as far as the actual fishing on Shoal Lake....First off, you will catch about 100 or more accidental walleyes per day, and a lot of them will be huge. (28 - 32 inches). Unless things have changed, it is illegal to fish for walleyes, and all walleyes must be IMMEDIATELY released (you're not even allowed to take a photo). In fact, if you catch a walleye, I think you are required to move away and fish another spot. (That doesn't really solve the problem though, because the whole lake is LOADED with walleyes)Pike - We trolled musky baits, (Jointed depth raiders), and also trolled Rapala Magnum X rap 20s and Magnum X rap 30s in the silver color and did pretty well on the pike. The problem was that we kept catching so many walleyes that it was hard to keep our baits in the water long enough to catch the pike. One of the guides from Ash Rapids Camp referred to walleyes on Shoal as a ""nuisance fish"" But yes the pike fishing is good, if you can keep the walleyes off your bait long enough. Shoal has a good population of open water, suspended fish that are feeding on smelt. This is where we spent the majority of time fishing.Smallmouth - We didn't spend much time fishing smallmouth on Shoal, as most of our time was spent open water fishing. But on the few times we trolled shad raps or rebel crayfish on the shallow rock reefs, we successfully caught smallies... except for the fact that we were so often interrupted by accidental walleyes. No matter where we went, we couldn't keep the walleyes off our lines.But if I were going to do a smallmouth and pike trip, Shoal would definitely be my first choice. And I would probably stay at Shoal Lake Lodge due to its location. I enjoyed my time at Ash Rapids, but Shoal Lake Lodge is closer to the action if you want to fish Shoal specifically."
5970794,adempsey2.0,2018-01-28 13:50:00,612,"I hadn't realized Walleye were closed all season on Shoal Lake. The regulations state Shoal Lake above Ash Rapids, which I assume is pretty much the entire main section of the lake? What about the section near Ash Rapids where the camp is? The regs didn't provide any GPS coordinates."
5967490,Finquest,2018-01-26 08:21:00,24,"Five of us from the Kansas City area are planning a Canadian fishing trip for the last week of July or the first week of August. We are looking for advice about where to go.This might be an odd request on a forum titled ""Walleye Central,"" but I think our group would prefer to catch pike and smallmouth. Walleye, lake trout, and a shot at a possible musky are secondary targets. I say this because 3 of us were on a local hybrid (white bass/striper) trip last Fall that ended up with us vertical jigging for crappie. We were consistently putting crappie in the boat; however, we all agreed that this was far from our favorite method of fishing. I don't know how that compares to vertical jigging for walleye (please correct me if this is an unfair comparison.) A little time fishing that way would be fine; we just don't want to spend an entire week with this being our primary method.Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Again, I realize this is a walleye forum, but I am guessing your members have a lot of general knowledge about Canadian fishing. Please let me know if there is a better place to post this question."
5967522,MN_Moose,2018-01-26 08:46:00,964,You've come to the right place. Many (all?) of us enjoy multi species fishing especially when visiting Canada. I would say that Northern Pike will be deep at that time of year. Pulling crankbaits (trolling) would be a way to get down to the target zone (20 - 30 ft) Bottom bouncers with spinners would also be an option. Concentrate on steep break points and edges of reefs. If you can find weed growth that would also be a good option. For small mouth may not be as deep but won't be concentrated like they are earlier for spawning. Reefs with rocks hold warming fish. Also search out the crawfish then you'll find the small mouth.
5967546,Finquest,2018-01-26 08:56:00,24,"Thanks for the advice.Any suggestions about where to go? Our ideal would be a modified American plan (evening meal only). However, if the fishing is that much better, we could be talked into doing all of our own cooking or going with the full American plan."
5967586,prov1800,2018-01-26 09:12:00,5010,Mn moose has it right.lot of lakes here that have the fishing your looking for.cedar lake being one of them.17 no long lake that has good pike population and very good bass fishing.muskie and crappie also.cedar point resort is the only camp there that has the meal plan.nice camp in the center of the lake.access to perrault lake which also has a very bass population.lost bay resort on cliff lake would also be another lake you would have great success on bass.very clear water with muskie lake trout pike and hard to catch walleye.these lakes are about the same size and easy to get around on.eagle lake as well ad lac suel have very good bass also but much larger bodies of water.but the two I mentioned would be what your looking for.check out Clarke's northern lights resort also on cedar.no food but great camp.17 ft boats and free bait.
5967706,Finquest,2018-01-26 10:04:00,24,"I didn't understand what this meant, ""17 no long lake.""Thank you very much for the information. It gives me some places to check out."
5967738,MrSimon,2018-01-26 10:16:00,922,"Fly in or drive to? That's the first major variable you want to nail down. There are certainly good drive-to lodges with good pike fishing .... but personally I believe the fishing on remote fly-in lakes is truly on another level. You'll sacrifice on the lodging though and almost certainly have to take and make your own meals. Once you decide that, the guys on here will shower you with excellent options and enough info yo make your head swim."
5967754,prov1800,2018-01-26 10:20:00,5010,Sorry just mentioned the lake is 17 miles long.very easy to navigate.
5967930,yoopertrout,2018-01-26 11:27:00,1172,"I'm far from a jigging expert, but you might find jigging for walleye to be different than vertical jigging for crappie. I've found that not all jigging for walleye is vertical. I've had good luck casting out, and slowly reeling the jig along the bottom (with or without jigging motion.) Also, depending upon where you go, you might get some big walleyes, which make it exciting. Also, some of the biggest pike I've caught have been while jigging for walleye. I've had my best luck doing this in June. I did go to Canada a couple times in August, and found the walleyes much more scattered. Again, I'm far from an expert, and I've heard others say they've done very well for walleyes in Canada."
5968042,MN_Moose,2018-01-26 12:42:00,964,You might consider Witch Bay Camp. I've never been there. They have a guide program (no extra charge) where the guide fishes with you or you follow them to spots and he teaches good practices. They have American plan. Are you using your own boats? Keep in mind that Canada has a holiday weekend every month. August holiday (long weekend) is Aug 6. And would be busy anywhere you go. The Winnipeg river might be good for you to consider. A few camps along there. Not sure about American meal plan. Search on Walleye Central. There's always lots of discussion on which camp is good.
5968122,Finquest,2018-01-26 14:07:00,24,"I think we are leaning towards ""drive to"" unless someone comes up with a place and/or a deal so good that I can convince the others to spend the extra money for the flights and the extra time for the cooking, camp chores, etc."
