Further, a link is often provided to a website they are promoting. Perhaps these people could be banned from this board. As an example, Bassmanjc has repeatedly posted the EXACT same post to promote a lodge in NW Ontario. The posts are generally made by a person seeking a recommendation for a good drive to lodge. This fellow appears to 'cut-and-paste' the same response every time. Is there any way to clean up this trash? If you do a search of some of these 'guest users' you see the same post every time... One last comment - If we are lucky, this sneaky advertising trick backfires on them and NO ONE will want to go to their rip-off place! I hope our neighbours south of the border are wise to these posts and don't waste their hard earned dollars..."
