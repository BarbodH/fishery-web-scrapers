A buddy and myself go to Minaki each June and are looking for a one day fly in somewhere, preferrably for walleye and smallmouth. Could you email me with some details? Thanks!Brian[email protected]"

525979,John K,2002-12-17 10:35:00,334,"I have not been up to Crowduck lake in five plus years and,have a chance to go the end of May 03. I have heard that Bill now requires you to come in and leave on Fridays. I was wondering if this change has effected any of the great service of the past that I have experenced.Also has anything changed on the smallmouth and walleye fishing?Are the walleyes getting smaller and the smallmouths making a Come back, and is Horseshoe lake still the best bet for numbers of smallmouth? Thanks in advance for any information. John K...."
525980,Guest,2002-12-17 16:17:00,0,"Walleye are all 22""and very skinny,but very easy to catch.There are no bass,no pike.I think the walleye have eaten everything and are starving.It is very sad."
525981,River_eye,2002-12-17 16:59:00,1486,"Depends on what spot, but yes, walleyes are getting smaller, but there are lots. Not too many bass or pike, but they're there. Saw two master angler bass all year. One of them was a 19.5"" smallie out from the Side Sadle lake sign. Saw two master angler walleye, a really skinny 28"" and a healthy 31"" (That surprised me). I can show you pictures of all these fish, I'll just have to get them up on a website or somthing."
525982,red_river_fisher,2002-12-18 10:14:00,24,"was up there in August did very well with Walleyes (2 boats 6 guys) we caught about 400 in one day biggest was 26"" very skinny also caught a couple of pikes."
525983,Basser,2002-12-18 18:33:00,31,I have always heard Crowduck is an EXCELLENT bass lake. Has something changed? Was planning a trip there to fish smallmouth as well as walleye. Should I reconsider??
525984,River_eye,2002-12-19 11:41:00,1486,"If you're looking for Bass only and lots of them, fly to horseshoe lake, if you're looking for Great Bass, plus walleye and pike, head to eaglenest lake on the nearby winnipeg river system."
525985,Basser,2002-12-19 21:00:00,31,Thanks Eric - is this Horeshoe Lk a fly in or a portage in lake off Crowduck? I appreciate all the info everyone shares - only get away once a year and if Crowduck has really declined would hate to waste a trip.
525986,River_eye,2002-12-20 15:26:00,1486,"I do not know much about horseshoe, but I do know that whiteshell air flys there and has some boats there. The lodge neighbouring the one I have worked for also flys to both horseshoe and crowduck for day trips. You just look in the master angler book and lots of trophys come from there. Sombody told me you can portage in there, but I'll have to look at a map to see from where.I would not say that crowduck has declined, it's still an incredible walleye lake, with beautifully clear waters. The thing is, I don't believe the ecosystem in the lake is quite stable. If you have alot of big fish, they eat the small fish, so the large zooplankton thrive (nothing eating them) and they eat all the algae in the lake, making it so clear.The only real problem I have with the lake is when people staying at crowduck camp and the locals come and pull up right beside us if we're catching fish. Happens all the time.Where are you coming from? I can answer any of your questions about crowduck, or the winnipeg river."
