526356,Mr Twister 1,2003-01-12 09:45:00,5,"Have fished Melchett twice, both times Walleye opener week, first year was a very early spring and caught most 'eyes across lake from cabin #2. There is an old dock and storage tanks from an old mining operation. Just outside of this bay is a steep sloped dropoff and we did great here. Second year we had a much later spring and we caught almost all fish off mouth of Kaptongwa River. We also had three cases of hooked 'eye being attacked by big pike. One set was landed, pike didn't release his hold on 'eye till he hit the bottom of the boat. Three guys from Toronto were staying at Luenbergers place at Kap but came through river (only 5-10 minute trip)to fish for pike on Melchett and caught 7 at 40 inches or larger near islands off of Kap River mouth. These guys were targeting large pike and did very well. Our group was after 'eyes but I caught 7 pike in the slot by accident fishing for 'eyes. One guy in our group got a 42 1/2 pike on 3/8 oz. jig. all in all, you should have a great trip!"
