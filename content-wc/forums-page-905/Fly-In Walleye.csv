526430,Guest,2003-01-23 11:17:00,0,"We just booked an August Fly-out with Kay-Air out of Ear Falls. We can't wait. Since he is on Lac Seul, we are planning on hitting L.S. if we still want to fish after our Fly-Out. Variety is the spice of life. We did a day trip with Peter last September and were pleased. Also were happy to hear that he going to fly in the beer ahead of time. I was having a hard time with the 90lbs weight issue since that included beverages. I hate making decisions like Food or Beer, extra clothes or Beer, etc. IvyEmporer in good standing of B.I.G. ( Beer in the boat Gang )"
