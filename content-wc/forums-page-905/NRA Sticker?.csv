527168,Guest,2003-02-01 05:26:00,0,Not Urban Legend. Canadian Border guards confiscate huge amounts of guns every year from US visitors who don't know that handguns are illegal here without special permits and restrictions. The NRA is front and center in pushing gun rights................

I assured her that I did not, but she now wanted to see ID of everyone in the vehicle. Upon checking the IDs, she said "" Do you know why I'm checking you out? When I said "" no"", she pointed at the NRA sticker on my car that said "" I support the right to bare arms."" No big deal to me, but they must learn that NRA members are not gun carrying fanatics. I will return !"
