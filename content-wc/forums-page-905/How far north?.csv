I'm wondering, at that time of the year, how far north you have to go in Canada to fish shallow water walleyes (by that I mean under 20 feet). I know it is somewhat weather dependant, but do we need to be north of Dryden or further; is a fly-in the only possibility; or is it possible to do it at a drive-in camp. Its just a personal preference for me, but I'd rather fish for walleyes in shallower water (its easier, and more fun IMHO). I also understand that at that time of the year it may not be possible, but I'm curious.Thanks for the input.BillP.S. When I say ""fish for walleyes"", I mean ""catch walleyes"". I could fish for walleyes in my bathtub, but I'm probably not going to catch any."
526956,Guest,2003-01-28 12:42:00,0,"I'm reminded of a saying, At any given time, not all of the fish are doing the same thing in the same place. By mid-summer the most productive pattern on a lot of shield lakes is to fish deep water reefs or humps in water over 20'. But, there also will be some walleye in the weeds, other walleye will be in rocky areas in water less than 15', and some walleye will be in the flats. I suggest you go when you can and experiment. Bottom bouncing with Rapala's or plastics in water less than 12' will certainly produce some eyes in mid-summer. At LOTW, there are a lot of humps that rise up to less than 20' in deep water. Anchoring or drifting over these usually will produce in mid-summer, and it's a relaxing way to fish. Good luck."

526958,Trailerguy,2003-01-28 16:39:00,1407,"I have a cottage on Wabaskang, we have no problem catching walleyes in as little as 4' of water, until the daytime temperaturehits the high 80's. That usually is the 1 st of August or so. Early morning and late in the day, when the shoreline is in shade is the key."
526959,duffy,2003-01-29 07:26:00,49,"At the camp I go to we get lots of walleyes in less than 12 feet of water all summer on two of our lakes. the max depth on these lakes is 25 feet as they a part of a river system. As far as how far north? I am not sure but we are 140 air miles north of red lake, ontario. Good luck with your searchDuffy"
526960,Stevie B,2003-01-29 12:55:00,157,"Was up at Dogskin Lake one summer and caught walleye in 4 feet of water with the motor running! We had a hard time finding walleye deeper than 15' of water. Great fishing, great place. Check out their website:www.Dogskin.com"
526961,stewart,2003-01-29 14:19:00,100,"I guessing it depends on the weather, and the kind of lake. Darker water probably keeps the walleyes shallower, but in clear lakes they might be deeper."
526962,Guest,2003-01-30 18:41:00,0,Check out Pakwashlakecamp.com Pakwash is about one and half hours from Dryden on Hwy 105 going towards Red Lake. I think you will find what you are looking for.
526963,Guest,2003-02-01 00:03:00,0,we have going north for 20 years and the last five seem to be almost any time is good. We stopped going north at ear falls on lac saul. The fish conservation methods seem to really be paying off now. good luck
526964,Guest,2003-02-02 00:02:00,0,Hi trailerguy. i have been thinking about a cabin on LOTWs. Its hard to find anyone with a cabin. I would like to know your thoughts on being a owner.
