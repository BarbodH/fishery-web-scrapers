527094,Guest,2003-01-31 10:21:00,0,"Good comments by everyone. I agree that some people have no business bringing their dogs to camp because they leave the dog locked in the cabin all day, their dogs aren't properly trained, etc., and I can understand why some camp owners just ban all pets rather than have the hassle of dealing with a few bad ones. To a certain degree the same kind of reasoning goes for kids. I've been on a few trips where there were some kids in camp that had no manners or respect for other people or their gear, and the parents were about as bad. What are you gonna do? I'm a little surprised that most camps don't allow dogs because it seems that many fishermen have dogs and enjoy taking them on their trips. Also, most duck hunters have retrievers and bring them on their trips. I guess I'm lucky to have found a camp that welcomes me and my dog. By the way, she's a four year old Australian Cattle Dog mix - not the same as an Australian Shepherd - and she's been through advanced obedience training, and is a certified therapy dog, meaning she visits the sick and elderly in hospitals and nursing homes as a form of emotional therapy for them. Thanks for your comments."
527095,Guest,2003-02-02 10:34:00,0,This is a good spot to ask my question. I will be going to Alaska from Minnesota this spring. What papers will I need to bring with me so I can take my dog across the border?

527084,Guest,2003-01-30 11:22:00,0,Curious how many of you bring your dog with you on your trips. I had been to a camp on Nipissing over 25 times and had brought big groups and referred a lot of groups there. Then I got a dog and brought her with me. The new owner let her into that camp for that trip but told me they don't allow dogs and not to bring her back. I found a new camp at LOTW that allows dogs and I haven't been back to Nipissing since. I really enjoy having my dog with me on the trips and she loves it. What is your experience with dogs at camp?

Camp owner has a Bk Lab, they love to swim and run. Dog is in the boat all day fishing, only trouble is she's starting to out fish me?"
527086,Guest,2003-01-30 12:48:00,0,"We bring our dog with us fishing everywhere - we really enjoy it andso does the dog. You just have to spend extra-time searching around for outifitters, resorts and motel/hotels that allow pets. We've always found good places. The majority of places do not allow pets,but this is understandable with potential mess and damages. We make sure to do our part to clean up and ask neighboring people if theymind the dog of if there are people afraid etc. It helps build therelationship...a lot of people don't like to be surprised in thewoods or on a boat dock but a visiting dog looking for some fun.It's a two way street."

527088,Guest,2003-01-30 19:22:00,0,"You must understand why some outfitters don't allow dogs.Suppose you have a camp full of people that want to relax and fish. Suppose you just spent ? amount of dollars fixing up your cabins.Along comes someone with a dog. They leave the dog in the cabin all day while they go fishing. The dog is barking all day long disturbing other people. Now lets say the dog is one of the destructive types and scratches the heck out of the door and window panes, maybe chews on the furniture. The list could go on forever. As a camp owner you have no idea if the people coming are good dog owners or not. It is sometimes better to lose one customer rather than taking a chance of losing a whole camp full or trying to repair damages that are costly. As a dog owner myself I understand your dilema so please try to understand why most camps prefer not to have dogs."
527089,Vitreum,2003-01-30 19:47:00,221,"camp owner, i'm with you. i don't want anyone elses dogs around me in camp. i've got 2 dogs and care a lot for them. i would not, however, think of taking them on vacation. i just don't wanna be bothered with someone elses dogs while on vacation. don't wanna have them underfoot mooching food. don't wanna play with them. don't wanna have to dodge their piles in the lawn. and especially don't wanna have a minute of my sleep interrupted. i don't even like the camp owners' dogs around, though i know why they are there. furthermore, some of these breeds are entirely untrustworthy and just plain mean. and the owners always say ""oh, they won't hurt you. they don't bite"". ya, right. sorry guys, just don't want them around me."
527090,River Rat,2003-01-30 21:50:00,43,"It seems hard to find resorts that will allow dogs. If I don't take my dog on vacation, it costs me an exta $12/day. I'm familar with Frog Rapids Camp. Does anyone know of others?"
527091,Eric,2003-01-31 05:39:00,114,I would rather be around some peoples dogs than be around their owner. We clean up after our dog and keep her with us at all times and away from other people. Never had a problem yet. BUT we RESPECT other people as they should respect us. I can see the camp owners position as they have alot of people to keep happy and don't want their property chewed up and wet on. We go on remote fly-ins and don't have people around us. Have fun and respect others!!
527093,Guest,2003-01-31 09:12:00,0,"I'm a dog owner and lover. I've learned that the only one that truly loves my dog is me. When I travel with the family I usually bring the dog if the resort allows it. But, when I go with the guys I leave Molly home. I don't even ask if its OK. I've been on trips with the dogs and after awhile those labs and setters get really stinky and can get to be a royal pain. TGG"
