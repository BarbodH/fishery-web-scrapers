Myself and at least four others are planning a trip to ontario. could somebody explain the regulations to me.Also, we will be crossing at either fort frances or pigeon river from minneapolis. we are looking for a place where we can bring our own boats, however we may have to rent one if more people come. please help us find as awesome walleye fishery no more than 8 hrs. from minneapolis.we'd rather not fish lake of the woods or rainy lake. we'd like to fish a lake that has boat in access if possible. Our budget per man is $200. The trip dates are friday-monday memorial weekend. Please let me know if we are setting a realistic budget that includes bait, gas, camp, food and travel. Also, if anyone has a private cabin they can rent to us let me know.Thanks,BJ"
