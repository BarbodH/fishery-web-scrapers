526966,Guest,2003-01-28 19:37:00,0,"Looking at last years bill we paid:GST---6.95%PST---5.80%less--3.475%( rebate on 1/2 GST)total =9.275%2002 was the first year the lodge could ""rebate"" 1/2 the GST on your bill so you do not pay it at all. Always before we had to stop at the border shop & apply for a refund. Get cash on the spot & they charged you a fee. If you wanted a full refund you had to wait for the gov. to mail it to you. The new system is much better!"

526969,Guest,2003-01-30 10:33:00,0,Hey Canadian guyCan the lodge owner charge you the 7% & 8% tax on the beer he brings into camp before you arrive?
526970,Guest,2003-01-31 17:52:00,0,"Hey US Guy,You actually bring up an interesting point. There is already more tax in our beer than you want to know. Much like our gas which is now at $0.80 per litre.Technically speaking, the GST can be applied to just about any service being provided. I do believe the PST can be applied to the actual delivery service but not %100 sure. But, if the lodge owner is reselling the beer and the delivery is part of the cost of the beer, I believe the tax on liquor for PST purposes is 10% and the GST would apply at 7%. I found this link below. Have a read as you may be able to get some of this back when you leave.http://txt.2ontario.com/traveltips/txt_tips22.cfmThe reason the lodge owner would want to charge you these taxes, is when he buys supplies he can claim them as credits as the business is using the supplies in generating more GST and PST. Typically, the end consumer is the one who pays the GST and PST. That is you and me.Don't take my word as gospel when it comes to the PST. I have more experience dealing with the GST. They are two different taxes each with their own peculiarity and require a lifetime to understand all their differences and applications."
526971,Guest,2003-01-31 23:56:00,0,"The GST is referred to as the go south tax. Canadians go south accross the border to avoid paying it. As far as the canadian value Ithink its all hogwash. Most of the resorts are owned by americans that dont even bring up the value. They want only US funds. I talked with a personel manager at a big paper mill in dryden. I asked how people can afford to live up there. He explained that , now this was around 1990, that a laborer in the mill at time made about $23.00 and hour canadian. maybe that has something to do with there value. They pay a lot in wages and the goods are expensive too. Back then a 10 ounce can of pop, that right 10 ounces, in the grocery store not out of machine was a dollor canadian."
