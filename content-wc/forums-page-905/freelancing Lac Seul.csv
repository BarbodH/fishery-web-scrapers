526902,Guest,2003-01-24 22:18:00,0,"Thinking about a Late July/early August trip to Lac Seul...My work may not allow me to plan until the last minute..Here's my question..Has anyone out there had experience with staying in any of the Motels remotely close to Lac Seul and freelancing?? I have a Tracker Pro Deep V 17 with a 90 hp Merc, VHF and a bit of experience (Lake Erie, Lake st clair on decent days)..I know there is a very good landing up near ear falls and a couple little motels in town..However if you get a big gusty north wind blowing and you're down around the south inlet just how bad is it going to be to get back up there to the north end?? Looks to be a fair piece with a big chunk of exposed water..I spent a week on LS last year and rode some thumping big waves out in a 16' lund with a 25hp..For a half an hour I was flat scared..Wasn't worried about drowning, but freezing to death in the cold water before I could reach shore..Fortunately we made it to a protected shoreline and waited out the blow. I know there are several very nice motels in Dryden can you access the southern part of Lac Seul easily from there?? Or will you burn up too much run time. My other options so far are staying at Scout Lake Resort (ok place, nice people) or at the Evergreen lodge in early August..Really liked the correspondence I've had with the owner at Evergreen..But the same question arises there..Evergreen is on the North End and if you run very far south you have a huge amt of open water..Just how bad does LS get when it really blows??? Am I worrying about the big water needlessly?? I really like the looks of the SE section of the lake on the map..Looks much more protected and lots of Islands..Just looking for feedback..ThxLH"
526903,happy,2003-01-25 15:06:00,34,Look for motels in the Sioux Lookout area.Fairly close to Lac Seul southeast section.Go to www.siouxlookout.com
526904,csm,2003-01-25 17:15:00,0,"Two years ago on Lac Seul, we were caught out on the North Shore when a storm started to build to the west. We started for the South Shore and ran through some very big waves. Finally, the waves were too much and went into a beach. This was in a 19' Lund with a 80 hp Yamaha (so a good boat for the water).Point is LS builds very big waves in a hurry when the wind blows hard. While there are many protected bays and points, if you have to cross the main channel, in a bad wind your going to find some nasty waves. For such a big body of water, LS has long streches of fairly shallow water so wind can really start churning it.However, if your smart and go to shore when you should and wait it out, you should be fine. Remember to pack a emergecy kit with you (rain tarp, waterproof matches, some granola bars, etc) and if worse comes to worse, ride out the storm on shore, even overnight rather than be foolish and try to make it back to your landing. Nothing back in hotel is worth your life and everything back home is worth you life, so put it on shore when its really nasty. 9 times out of 10 in an hour, the wind and waves have calmed and you can make a run without fear of dumping or worse.LS is a great body of water, but it demands respect because, it like Erie, can hurt you the second the you think your tougher or smarter than Mother Nature."

If it's last minute planning, don't be afraid of the Trillium motel in Ear Falls. Nice clean motel and good adjoining restaurant. They are pretty busy also, so you could run into a problem without advance reservations. I stay on the NW end and it's a 30-35 minute ride to S. Inlet in a bigger boat than yours. I guess I would question why you'd want to make a long run like that, at least on a daily basis. Some awful good fishing spots alot closer to Ear Falls. Lac Seul can get awful lumpy, and in a big hurry, however the winds usually go down by evening."
526906,Guest,2003-01-25 18:49:00,0,"Thanks for the info guys..Dogs, we really enjoyed the scenery down there at the south inlet area and did not see any other boats..It was like we were on the lake alone until we started heading back and ran into the wave of boats heading to and from the many lodges at the North end on the main lake channel..I know it doesn't make ""economical"" sense, but it was the place we enjoyed most. We made a trip to Mckenzie bay and several of the Narrows north of there and it was the same thing, consistent boat traffic. Caught fish every where we went, but liked that south inlet area the best. I really like the Evergreen owners concept of how fishing should be and his thoughts on conservation..But again the Location is making me drag my feet. The wildlife was much more evident and easier to see down there, heck it was like a world of it's own. I do appreciate your information..Unless work throws a monkey wrench my plans we'll be on LS this summer..Really want to get my wife and son into numbers of fish..They'll have a blast..ThxLH"
526907,Jim,2003-01-26 14:39:00,238,Saw your post and am surprised no one discussed the Pickeral Arm area. This sounds like the idea area for you. It is SW of Sioux Lookout and offer ideal fishing and low exposure to the elements. The fishing in the Arm has been great the last few years and it is easy access to Minnitaki and the numourous area there. Two resorts you may want to investigate are Pickeral Arm Camp and Donnelleys. Both are very good. If you want to discuss further email me at [email protected]
526908,Guest,2003-01-27 11:20:00,0,"have freelanced out of Sioux Lookout for 5 years...Fish the Archer Lake area...haven't had too much problem with rollers. Its a long run to deception landing if something comes up, so you need to keep abreast of whats going on weather wise."
526909,Guest,2003-01-28 08:01:00,0,"I have freelanced out of Ear Falls and Sioux Lookout as well. Enjoyed it.Maybe a little more protected on Sioux Lookout side around Deception Bay. I liked that area better, but its all in the eyes of the beholder. Liked the Lamplighter and eating at Knobby's in Sioux Lookout. Gas is a lot cheaper that way as well."
