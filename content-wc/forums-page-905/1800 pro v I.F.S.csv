527185,Guest,2003-02-01 19:32:00,0,Just a question about H.P rating on this boat. Lund rates this boat for a 175 H.P but the canadian coast guard only rates this boat for a 130 H.P.[compliance plate]. I talked to lund and they told me it is safe with a 175 H.P. I was just wondering what an insurance company would do if I where to hurt or kill someone in an accident. I will be putting a 150 H.P. on this boat. Also the canadian coast guard told me it was not illegal to put a 150 on it. Do you guys run higher then a 130 in canada?
