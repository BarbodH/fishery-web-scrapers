526934,joepa,2003-01-27 09:40:00,366,I have been looking for outfitters/lodging on Grand Lake Victoria in Quebec to no avail. Can anyone help? Can you drive in?Thanks.
526935,nemio,2003-01-28 17:10:00,96,Yes you can drive-in. But why not just stopping on the Cabonga or the Dozois; there is very good outfitters and nice camping site and the fishing is as good as on the Victoria.
