516953,Wisconeye,2002-04-14 06:44:00,79,"I have owned two UGLY STICKS- and they named them correctly- UGLY for fishing purposes! I now have graduated to Gloomis GL2. I worked my way up to them via a St.Croix Premier. I love the St.Croix and GL2.You'll spend quite a bit more, but you'll love them forever and they'll improve your success.You'll get all kinds of opinions but I wouldn't buy anything that hadthe number of ""UGLY"" responses you've seen here. Some guys can use them and do catch a lot of fish with them...but I'm not that good I can take a chance with ole UGLY."
516954,Guest,2002-04-15 07:15:00,0,"Ugly Sticks are a lot of fun when you get a fish on, however, they are very ""whippy"" and you will catch many more fish with a graphite rod. The hook sets will also be better on a graphite rod."
516955,Guest,2002-04-15 13:10:00,0,Has anyone tried the new Shamino Compre series. They are running around the high $80. Seems like they compete with the low end St. Croix...B-
516944,Red Ruffandsore,2002-03-14 19:13:00,81,"Ugly Sticks are no longer made the same as the originals. I have an original as well as a later model Gorilla stick...but my Berkley Lightning Rod is my go to rod. It all depends on budget, use, and results."
516945,IaCraig,2002-03-15 09:46:00,434,"I am not ugly stick expert, however I have tried them. Maybe 6-7 years ago I bought a spinning Ugly Stik with a foam handle and I bought a Cabela's IM6 ProGuide rod with a cork handle. I took them both to Canada for a 1 week trip and where we Bottom Bouncing & jigging for Walleyes. By the middle of the week I was using the Cabela's IM6 ProGuide rod exclusively, because to me it was much more sensitive. Was it the cork handle??? Or was it Graphite Vs Ugly Stick??? I do not know, but today I own 6 graphite Walleye rods and 1 ugly stick. About the only time I use the ugly stick is occasionally for casting cranks & spinners, otherwise it is stuck in the back of my rod locker as a spare to lend to guests in my boat if their equipment fails.In closing, I must add that my brother in-law & his buddy are successful die-hard walleye men and they both love their Ugly Sticks for fishing heavy river currents."
516946,Guest,2002-03-15 11:24:00,0,"IMHOUgly Sticks have their place and I do own one, but not for walleye. Uglys are too heavy to hold all day and are to limber, not sensitive enough. BUT, they do have their place. I use them for any big game fish. Pike, Sturgeon, Salmon etc. Why buy a rod for every species when the trusty Ugly Stick will fit the bill? Nope, can't complain.Now, if you're looking for a good walleye rod, try these: Shakespeare Sigma Titanium...7'0"". The Rapala people have also entered the rod market and have a nice titanium-eyed rod for only $40 Cdn. Can't go wrong with either. And, I recommend the 7 footer...have to disagree with the rest of the boys on that point. Rods are big, long and cumbersome in the store, home and car, but suddenly shrink in the boat. Get the 7.tom"
516947,Guest,2002-03-15 12:18:00,0,I own one and use it for Salmon Fishing in The Nipigon when trolling with the rods in holders. Get a Fenwick HMX ...they are quaranteed against breakage for five years and are a relatively inexpensive good rod. However if your budget is really limited do what you have to do. Any rod is better than no rod.
516948,Piscatorian,2002-03-15 18:46:00,12,"Ugly sticks are really great if you don't want to feel the bite until the fish has swallowed it completely and started to swim away. Not a terrible crankbait rod, at least."
516949,bigfish1965,2002-03-15 19:31:00,3210,"I have a 22 yr old ugly stick. Reason number 1 to own one. They last forever. A decent all around rod. I have caught salmon, musky, walleye...damm near everything on that old rod. It's a good rod for tossing cranks and spoons."
516941,Guest,2002-04-11 19:40:00,0,hey just wondering about the rapala line up of rods has anyone tried them?
516950,Melonbob_ON,2002-04-13 04:54:00,61,"I think everyone has owned a stick in their lives, aren't they the biggest selling rod of all time? But the fact is, they are not a good walleye rod. My parents used their sticks for about 10 years, and nothing convinced them that anything was better, until my mother borrowed my fiancee's St.Croix. She couldn't believe the difference. Not only will you catch more fish with a good graphite rod, but your arm won't feel like it's going to fall off after a couple of hours. Now don't get me wrong, I'd take my 7' stick up against a 20lb pike any day of the week.....(:"
516951,Guest,2002-04-13 10:57:00,0,"I bought my first ugly stick last year primarily to fish for carp. For that purpose its a good rod, has lots of bend and lots of backbone for the 40 yard runs. I concur that it is definitely not a jigging rod though - too heavy and too soft in the tip. A couple of years ago I bought a berkley biceps powerbulge. Ridiculous name I know but a great rod for walleyes, very sensitive. I have'nt seen this rod in stores since. Has anyone else ever heard of it and what do they think?seasons nearly on us, Jim"
516952,Guest,2002-04-13 18:41:00,0,"midrange priced rods with everything you need???? bought a Cabelas FishEagle II several years back and still use it most of the time. It is a 6'6"" 2pc spinning rod that has yet to fail me.don't take my word on it, call Cabela's and ask to talk to a product specialist....they have not failed me either."
516933,Guest,2002-02-05 05:02:00,0,"HiI am planning on getting a new rod for walleye and pike - would anyone recommend the shakespeare ugly stick - I have heard they are good but I want to know from the people who have one.Also what type and length should I get - 6ft or 6'6"" - cork handle or foam?ThanksPaul"
516934,Guest,2002-02-05 05:35:00,0,"I had 2 of them. I gave them away. They are indeed ""tough"" as advertised. They are also HEAVY, INSENSITIVE, and SPINELESS.If you are looking for an inexpensive rod, try looking at some of the Shimanos or Quantums (I think both K-mart and Wal-mart carry some of these. I bought a Shimano at K-mart about 10 years ago that was pretty good).If you want to step up to about $60 look at St Croix Premier series. I think Shimano, Daiwa, and Lewis all have good rods in that price range also.If you live near a Cabela's or Gander Mountain, I would suggest you go in and talk to people in their fishing department and have them steer you. If not, call Cabela's and talk to their ""product experts"" ... just ask the customer service rep who answers the phone to steer you to one of their fishing ""product experts"" and ask them what works in the price range you are looking at. I found the Cabela's people to be very honest and pretty knowledgable.Good luck with your choice."
516935,Peanut,2002-02-05 08:27:00,929,"I agree. They would not be my first choice either, for the reasons listed above. There are many very good rods in the same price range I would prefer, some of which have been listed. I would also add the Berkeley Lightning Rod to that list. The Series One or Signature Series are more costly, but the basic Lightning Rod is very reasonably priced.As for your other questions - some people say foam is more comfortable than cork, but it is less sensitive. Personally, I would stick with cork.Length - if it is a multi-purpose rod - some jigging, casting, trolling, go with the 6'6"". If just for jigging, you can get away with the 6'.Good Luck. derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"
516936,Mike M (Sask),2002-02-05 09:06:00,374,I also agree with the others above. I have used the Ugly Sticks but found them insensitive and heavy. The Berkley Lightning Rod is a good overall rod for the value...light and sensitive. I have several of them and feel they are a good value for the Price. Just me 2 cents.Good Luck & Good Fish'nMike M (Sask)
516937,BIG AL,2002-02-05 09:36:00,93,"OK guys, I use a 6'6 1pc. ugly stik for jigging the last 4 yrs. and have out fished everyone on the boat with their expensive and pricey graphite rods almost every time. I have also caught and landed 2 30+ lb. musky with the same rod last season on 12#berkely trilene XT line. Not bragging, just my 2 cents. PS this is the same rod I caught in the Detroit River while jigging with another ugly stik I own(6' one pc.) TIGHT LINES AND STIFF RODS HOOK MORE FISH><> ><> ><> AL"
516938,Guest,2002-02-05 09:42:00,0,"I actually have a Lighting Rod - they are great.Has anyone ever tried the Shimano Series, I have heard these are also good."
516939,Guest,2002-02-05 09:46:00,0,"fish with a 1/4 metal dowel instead. seriously-the ugly is a little stiff for walleye. and the rods listed by other posters here are not bad. ive used a variety and i stumbled upon bass pros extreme rods and was lucky to buy a pair on sale which kept the price down to $50. and they were pretty good! but if you can go higher...what these guys are recommending should work for you. cork handles only-and the more eyes `for the eyes' the better! and forget the pike application. any 6'6"" quality rod should also handle pike. go for the walleye application first."
516940,Northern Manitoban,2002-02-05 15:05:00,195,"There is nothing wrong with the UGLY STICK rods,had a pro IM6 graphite which is the higher end rod bought at cabelas 5'5"" caught me many trophy fish.It did not have the soft tip the other models have.I do have a 7 footer with the soft tip and it was a good pike rod.But just to much bend for me.The lightning rod is a great rod and i do fish with one and i do love it,but to say better then my UGLY STICK pro i would say no way.Wish i could find another UGLY STICK pro model,dropped some gear on it and broke 3 inches off the tip.FISH ON."
516942,ggg,2002-02-06 19:16:00,115,I do believe the story about snagging an Ugly stick in the river. Your odds are pretty good because every lake and river probably has a few in their bottom ! Half of my old Ugly stick is in the lake and half is in the garage after being broken in half by a fish. And I imagine that a few litter bugs just threw them overboard to get rid of them. I was not sorry to see mine go.
516943,Guest,2002-02-08 07:52:00,0,You guys probably don't like ugly sticks cause your mammas beat you with them! Good rods in my opinion. B
