519252,Guest,2002-04-13 07:43:00,0,"I will be at Gullrock the last week in June. Will be my 14th year. Normally, the boot, Burnt Island, Keg Lake are consistent. We normally troll with spinners and Lindy rigs. I have gone back and forth between that week in June and the 1st of August. My only worry in late June are the mayflies."
519253,Guest,2002-04-13 11:17:00,0,"go to Gullrock every june I fish 1oo yrds. from camp catch all the eyes we want. Once a week we'll go to ranger alot of fish, no challenge just to easy gets boring. We catch fish all over the lakes. As far as what to use jig maybe a hammered brass spinner orange is a good color on the rock."
519254,Guest,2002-04-13 13:51:00,0,What camp do you stay at? Is this too far north for bass?
519256,Guest,2002-04-13 16:05:00,0,"We stay at mcewens, on two island, at times we have never had to go out of two island to catch fish, especially when it is too rough on Gullrock. Ranger at times is super easy to get a lot of fish, especially along that small island in ranger."
519255,Guest,2002-04-13 16:07:00,0,"yes, i think you read bass, instead of brass spinner, ive never caught bass in gullrock."
519257,Guest,2002-04-13 18:48:00,0,I stay at five lakes lodge and yes I have caught Bass on Gullrock about 1mi. from camp.I think Ranger lake is for the one a be walleye fishermen 100 fish a day that to easy but fun Have a good trip up there.
