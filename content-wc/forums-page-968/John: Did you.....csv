519287,redlaker,2002-04-16 12:26:00,0,"There is about 3ft. of ice but it isn't good, we got a good snow right after first ice. the ice just rose yesterday and turning a little gray it's still going to be along time till she off. As far fishing I did real good a little dry spell the 2nd week in Feb. but that only means I had time to drink a beer between bites."
