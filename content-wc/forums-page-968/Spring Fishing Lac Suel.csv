519297,Guest,2002-04-15 10:05:00,0,"I am not so sure about your destination ""sunrise lake"". Could you possibly mean ""Sun Light and Broad Lake"". Yes, those are good places to fish but Mckenzie Bay, Shanty Narrows, and Sawmill Bay are a lot closer. Besides, if you run into bad weather coming back, it can make for a long ride or possibly pulling up to an island and spending the night in the elements and that is not a lot of fun.Now if you are staying in the middle of the lake, then the aforementioned two lakes are quite feasible. But if you are on the west end, then the preceding paragraph applies."
