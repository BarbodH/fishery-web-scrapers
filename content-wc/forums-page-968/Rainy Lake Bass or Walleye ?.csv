519073,Guest,2002-04-08 11:20:00,0,"BobberI was there this past November (early), and we caught a ton of smallies thanks to my buddy who guided me all over his hot-spots. Over 40 smallies for the two of us in 2 short fishing days. So, theyare there in large numbers. As for walleye, we never hooked up with one, but that doesn't mean they're not there. My pals Aqua-View showed walleye stacked up on some of the same areas as we were catching smallies...they just chose not to bite.I'm probably not the best one to spew forth information on the populations, but that's my experience anyway. good lucktom"

We always stay at Camp Narrows Lodge on the north arm. Their specialty is catch and release smallmouth bass. www.campnarrows.ca , Good fishing and remember throw the big ones back."

No other lodge has better guides take my word for it, all the ones in the above reply dont spend nearly as much time on the water. 40 fish in two days, try 50 in one afternoon. Dean, Gordie, and Jason know thier fish! Go to Campfire you'll be glad you went.www.campfireisland.com"
