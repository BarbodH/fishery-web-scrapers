518211,Guest,2002-03-20 14:32:00,0,How far is Pigeon River from Ft Frances?
518205,Xplorer,2002-03-21 11:21:00,244,"Lax, Actually, downtown Thunder Bay is only 36 miles from the pigeon river border crossing and usually takes us about 45 minutes (watch for moose, we have seen several near Hwy 61 shortly after crossing the border). I have stayed at the Landmark hotel before but it is a bit more than you will need (indoor pool, etc) Should be able to find a good spot to stop by searching yellow pages online.There has been quite a bit of repaving of Hwy 61 along the Minn northshore the last few years and the drive can be awesome (or you can have lake-fog and not see much:-( ) there are some great overlooks of Lake Superior.Xplorer"
518212,Xplorer,2002-03-21 11:23:00,244,"Walleye One, It is about 260 miles from the pigeon river crossing to the fort francis crossing along Hwy's 61 and 11. Xplorer"
518206,Guest,2002-04-13 04:32:00,0,Lax- Try the Norwestern-It is right on 61 with a great eating place right across the street. Nice rooms-about 70.00. We do it every year-no problems. Have fun!
518197,Guest,2002-03-15 23:23:00,0,"I am going up to Ignace in late July. I plan on crossing the border around 5:00 p.m on Friday. Where is the best place to cross, International Falls or Thunder Bay?ThanksLax"
518198,docIN,2002-03-16 03:18:00,120,Where abouts do you fish in Ignace?I have crossed at both and Thunder Bay has been the easiest of the two. This has been some time ago. I now go through the middle of Michigan and stay away from Chicago. I live in Indiana and seems easier although not faster. I fish a lot of the smaller lakes around Sevant. Have you been going to this area for awhile?
518200,Arkie eye jerker,2002-03-16 05:06:00,228,"It may have been the time of day I went through Thunder Bay, but Thunder Bay was much faster to get through than International Falls, mostly because there was far less traffic. To the best of my memory I went through both around 4 or 5 pm.Ed Gray"
518201,TomPGrouse,2002-03-16 06:59:00,124,"Good Morning,First of all you can not cross the border at Thunder Bay since it is several hours north of the border. You will be crossing at Pigeon River. We go through Ignace every year and always go through Pigeon River. We have never had a problem or a delay. It is much smaller than International Falls. When you look at the map there is no really good way to get to Ignace. But going through Thunder Bay is the best. Roads are fine."
518199,Guest,2002-03-16 07:17:00,0,"docIN,We are going to Press Lake which is just east of Silver Dollar. When I had talked to the lodge owner she had suggested not crossing at International Falls. I was planning on crossing the border on Friday and getting a hotel room in Fort Frances, then getting an early start on Saturday morning. Her suggestion kind of threw me for a loop. I had never thought of going through Thunder Bay instead. This will be my first time fishing in this area! I am interested in hearing where you have you fished and what success you have had!Thanks for the help!Lax"
518202,Guest,2002-03-16 07:26:00,0,"TomPGrouse,You are right...it seems like you are going so far east to then travel back west to get to Ignace...no direct route to Ignace. I checked the mileage through mapquest and even though it might take longer going through Pigeon river, the total miles are almost the same(from Milwaukee). I would rather spend more time moving than standing in line! Do you know of any good hotels in Thunder Bay?Thanks for your help!Lax"
518207,bphunger,2002-03-16 07:53:00,28,Just a reminder that the new customs office in Ft. Frances is open and has four inspection lanes instead of the two at the old building. Going on to Ignace is a toss up from either place.
518209,Guest,2002-03-16 08:48:00,0,Go Thunder Bay. Never had more than a few cars in front of me at TB. Ft. Francis/International Falls sometimes 3-4 hours wait. The line sometimes is hundeds of cars stretching over a mile. New customs bldg. should reduce this but it could still take quite a while. Especially on Friday or Saturday.
518208,TomPGrouse,2002-03-16 08:51:00,124,We leave Green Bay at 3:30 am and get to Ignace about 5:00-6:00pm. This is pulling a boat and trailer and stopping to eat breakfast and lunch. I would guess it is about 625-650 miles to Ignace. As to hotels-the only recommendation I would make is to start calling as soon as you see my posting! Friday nights during the summer are hard to find.Good luck.
518210,Steve,2002-03-20 10:41:00,259,The north shore drive is great to see! Not much to see after you leave Duluth if you go to I.Falls. Road const. slowed us down going to I.Falls last year. New road surface with lots of small rocks and 3 chips in a new windshield of my truck!
