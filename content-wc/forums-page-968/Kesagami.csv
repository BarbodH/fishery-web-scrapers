I would really appreciate any first hand accounts of what I can expect, numbers and size of fish, baits etc. Thanks alot.Tight Lines,Chromer"
519316,Guest,2002-04-16 09:16:00,0,i think they have a website around. would be surprised if they didnt. from what i hear its the last eastern ontario hot spot. giant pike up to 25lbs. tons of walleyes. its totally catch and release. you must file off the barbs on the lures and only use single hooks. apparently its a rigorous c&r routine....cradles for catching and releasing pike etc. somewhere in the archives there was a group who complained about the management's fussiness about rules not just concerning c&r and this might be the place but dont quote me. even if it is its probably worth a one-timer just for the quality fishing. i hear their food is outstanding-5 star outstanding.have a good time.

Superb reports about Kesagami fishing, food, and lodging...but rumor has it they might be a tad zealous in re. catch and release. On the other hand, if you're blessed with some of the finest Eastern Ontario fishing available maybe you'd want to do all you could to preserve it. Strictly a top-shelf operation. We did a fly-in to one of their outpost lakes last year...excellent folks to deal with, great fishing and accomodations.tight lines"

Pike we did get (and biggest walleyes)were on large red & whites and 5 of diamonds. Walleye's mostly on tubes and other plastic. Everything must be single hook barbless so take the trebles off before you go, the lodge has single hooks if you don't. Also did some fly fishing for Pike on big streamers. Guides and other guests told us there were lot's of big pike to be had in June. Great accomodations, great guides, great food, great shore lunches. If you're not using a guide take a handheld GPS or a compass...it is a huge lake."
