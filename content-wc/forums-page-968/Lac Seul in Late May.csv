519011,Guest,2002-04-09 18:27:00,0,"Hey big tim: we are going to go to LAC SEUL LODGE in sept. In order to find walleye and northern are we going to have to go a long distance from the camp? In reading all the interesting answeres about lac seul, it sounds like everyone had to travel a long way across the lake to find fish. please tell me that there are spots closer to camp, say within a couple of miles. pepe"
519012,Walleye Wacker,2002-04-09 20:00:00,6,pepe....Take your GPS with you and put some miles on that boat. You may have to do some traveling but it will be worth it. Dan (Lodge Owner) will be happy to mark some trophy areas for you. Plan on shore lunchs and Hog Walleyes And Trophy Pike.....Good Luck
519013,Guest,2002-04-10 04:10:00,0,"I can't tell you what it's like in Sept. You can catch nice fish in the 3 bays that sepperate the lodge from the main lake( 3 miles to the big water). You probably will not have to go all the way to broad (20 miles or so), But do listen to Dan, He grew up on the lake & his interest is putting you on the fish, so you are happy & will come back. I agree with Wally Wacker. Get a GPS ( got mine for less than $100 on ebay). Don't worry about the miles, it's so beautiful up ther, you won't mind. If you are renting their boat, opt for the new 17' Lunds with 40 hp. 4 strokes. Fantastic gas mileage & So comfortable!"
519004,Guest,2002-04-10 19:59:00,0,"Zugbug, that spot is permanently etched in my mind.Mike"
519002,Guest,2002-04-10 20:05:00,0,"Nate, I'm Zugbug's fishing buddy, and the main reason we aren't going back to SLR is that it's too far of a boat ride to the good honey holes (at least the ones where we could find fish)Mike"
519014,Guest,2002-04-10 20:15:00,0,"thanks to both, walleye wacker and big tim. I will do as you have recommended. I""ll talk to dan and have him mark up a map. They do have maps there, i hope. I""m curious, why you guys don't rent the cabins that he has in sunlight lake. seems like you would be closer to all the hot action. I have talked to others that have fished there and they dont think that the northern fishing will be good there at that time of sept. Were going there on the 3rd week of sept. they say that the lake will be in the turn over stage. thanks again,...pepe"
519003,zugbug,2002-04-12 22:54:00,67,"Sorry Nate, I've been working so I can go and play in Port Clinton All Next week! The Waterfall or Rapids(?) (More of a small Waterfall I Guess)Is the Place I was Talking about.The Maps DO NOT show the Bar/Reef But It's There. As for Scout Bay Lodge The Lodge Was Terrific the Cabins Clean and Comfortable. When we were there last it was late July and about all we caught in the Bays/Lakes near camp were dinks. So we explored and drove our boats looking for spots, as this was our first trip there we were trying a lot of different structure. This is how we found our little piece of Heaven on earth. I believe that the walleye fishing near the camp would be best early. (May, June & Early July depending on the weather) Lately we have been trying the middle section of the lake. Short Boat ride to Mahkwa Lodge. Great fishing Right Near By and Easy Access to Vaughn Lake. Protected Parking Area, which may not seem important but after having my passenger and driver side windows shattered by Juvenile Delinquents at Deception Bay Access, And Driving 500+ Miles listening to flapping plastic and Duct tape, Protected Parking is a VERY good Thing.Tick the top of the weeds,Zugbug"
518997,Guest,2002-04-06 17:35:00,0,My Dad and myself are making our 1st trip to Canada the last week in May. We will be staying at the Scout Lake Resort. A lot of the posts I have read are for summer fishing. Would it be possible to get some opinions on early spring fishing for walleye and pike? We are trying toput together our tackle and would appreciate any experiences with the early spring fishing on Lac Seul. I read that the ice out could be a little late this year......what effect wil that have?Thanks in advance.dobe77
518998,zugbug,2002-04-07 21:32:00,67,"I have fished out of Scout Lake Camp and in late May, scout lake itself could be pretty good, The Island in the middle of the 2nd bay was good to us for Pike but we were there in July. Try the many small points in the channel on your way out to the big lake, and the points close to the channel on the big lake. If you are adventureous a trip to Broadcast or Sunlight(?) Lakes could be worth your while, just take it easy going up Altimater Creek. Please give my best to the gang at Scout Lake Camp. Especially The lovely Elizabeth."
519005,Big Tim,2002-04-08 05:26:00,63,"Last year was our first trip to Lac seul so I can relate to 1st time questions. We stayed at Lac Seul lodge, not too far from Scout. We were up the last week in May. We all brought a ton of tackle & of course used very little of it. Our first full day we had a guide & he took us up to Mckenzie Bay( It's a loooong trip & I would not try it without a guide) He only fished with spinner rigs with 3/8 weight, backtrolling, dragging a minnow about 50' behind the boat. Only two colors Chartreuse with any trim if the sun was out. Hammered copper or gold if cloudy. Stock up on single hook 2-3'long spinner rigs with #3 or 3-1/2 colorado blades in those colors for Sure. Borad lake was our best spot for lots & lots of Walleye. It too is a long ride, but easier to find than McKenzie. Altimiter creek is a bit ""bumpy"", just go slow or wait for someone else to head up & follow them thru. We did a lot of jigging in Broad. Again Chartreuce or Yellow were the best colors. I've never seen such a difference on color selection. My partner ran out of Chartreuse & tied on a red head--- no fish , after I had caught 6 more he finally accepted my offer of another Chartreuse & BINGO ! he started hitting ""em again. The only time we used lures were when we were targeting Pike. Again anthing Chartreuse / yellow /copper /gold. I had one Pike swirl on my trusty Rapala several times but no hit, took off the black &silver, tied on a size smaller yellow / black & WHAMM! a nice 34"" pike!My best advice for Walleye: get a guide the first day, tell him you want to fish Broad, take a GPS so you have no problems getting back & have a ball ! We caught the most Pike in the grassy bay in the ""big"" island. Sorry I can't give you better directions than that, but if you get a map & find where Lac Seul Lodge is , gust head due East & look for the largest Island, You should see agood sized bay on the west side. Also get some leeches they last 3-4 times as long as minnows & catch just as many & just as big Walleyes."
518999,NateW,2002-04-08 10:49:00,96,"Zug,Are you going there in July again this year? We'll be there July 6 - 13."
519006,Walleye Wacker,2002-04-08 16:44:00,6,You have already recieved the proper information. When you go to Broad Lake proceed across the Lake and go into Sunlight Lake and fish in front of the outpost camp on Sunlight. Another great spot on Sunlight is at the back of the Lake along the North bank. You will see plenty of structure there and it will yield you some nice eyes. Both Broad and Sunlight are full of spawning Walleye in May and some days its like fishing in a aquarium. Take plenty of Leechs in my experience they will out fish minnows and you can catch 3 to 4 Walleyes on one Leech. Catch and release...save the resource for the future....Good Luck
519000,zugbug,2002-04-08 17:52:00,67,"Nate, I'll be heading back from Lac Seul on the 6th of july back to Cleveland. This year fishing out of Mahkwa Lodge. Thought I'd let you know about a spot I found by accident down the south Inlet. The guy at the camp can tell you where the small creek that empties into The Inlet is. But here's the tip. In the Middle of the Bay North of the creek mouth is a reef or sunken Island. When I found it a small patch of cabbage was pushing the top. This was in mid july. Last day of trip, last couple of hours. I started throwing Spinnerbaits at the cabbage for Pike. My father Tossed out a slip bobber rig and stretched out to rest while I had my fun. You guessed it. on the drop off there must have been a couple of hundred(maybe a Thousand)walleyes. First one the old fart catches was 29.5"" then about 60 more down to 23"" Some times I lie in bed and think of that spot. This was before I had a GPS. Keep your eye on the Locator about 1/4 Mile from the creek mouth. Try the mouth area also it always holds fish but DEFINATELY look for the Reef,best of luck.ZugHey, Mike if your out there I bet you remember the spot."
519008,zugbug,2002-04-08 17:57:00,67,"Big Tim, Try dragging a #5 Chartruse with red eyes Wally diver. You can thank me later.tight linesZugbug"
519007,Big Tim,2002-04-09 06:06:00,63,"We caught a bunch in Sunlight, right in front of thr outpost too, I just wasn't gonna let on to ALL my favorite spots (We'll be there the last week of May again). didn't want too many people back there! Thanks for the tip about the north end, If it's too crowded, maybe we'll head back there."
519009,Guest,2002-04-09 06:07:00,0,"I've got a few of those, I'll try 'em & let you know."
519001,NateW,2002-04-09 10:32:00,96,"Zug,Is that the very, very southern spot on South Inlet where the waterfall is? Or does it empty into South Inlet from the west? I found the waterfall last time up, and just noticed the creek running in from the west while studying the map over the winter. Isn't it weired how you can look at a maps for years then suddenly see something you missed?I didn't see a reef on the map though must have been something else I missed....I'm going to look again when I get home tonight. Roland also recommended we try fishing around any of the island in Bay Of Islands, but we never did it because we had found other honey holes by then.Mind if I ask why you;re not going back to SLR?"
