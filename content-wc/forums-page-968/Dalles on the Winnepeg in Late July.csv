I have heard a lot about the walleye fishing by the Dalles on how good it is. I have also heard that there is a huge current that runs through there. I was wondering how you would fish that particular area meaning what lures and techniques would be the best. Also if you know some other good fishing areas near the Dalles and could give me some idea of where the area is in terms of the Dalles I would greatly appreciate it.Thanks Fellas,Schmeg"
