519163,Randy,2002-04-10 06:16:00,53,I know that the Walleye is King but I would like to try some Pike fishing on Lac Seul in early June. I would appreciate any information that could help me land some toothy critters. What type of structure..technique...lures that have worked will be greatly appreciated. We are going June 8-14....Thanks
519164,Guest,2002-04-10 10:19:00,0,"Randy,There are some real nice pike in Lac Suel and Muskie as well depending on the end of the lake you are fishing. Early June, particularly this year with a later ice out should still see some nice fish in shallower water. Look for bays and any cabbage weed and start in the back parts of the bays, weed line edges etc.. Any rock humps or reefs are also a good bet. Cabbage in 12-15 feet of water is an ideal spot. Watch the water temperatures, under 65-70 degree surface will have the larger pike in the bays and shallower water, over that range they move out and work the deeper areas of the lake.I have had the best luck in this lake with the good old Silver Minnow (1 1/8 oz) with a white rubber trailer or pork rind. Larger spinner baits are also a good lure as are the Floating and Husky Jerk Rapalas.Good luck.Paul"
519165,Big Tim,2002-04-10 11:47:00,63,"Above advice is right on the money. Concentrate on chartreuse if it's sunny. Hammered gold if it's overcast. Large is better. The pike up there get a lot bigger than we are used to in the states & they like BIG baits. Stick a trailer on to make your lure look bigger. You can also try frogs, as long as they are yellow or chartreuse. Make sure you bring a good net, last year we spent way too much time tying an old net back together after every Pike!"
519166,Randy,2002-04-10 17:32:00,53,"Thanks for the quick replys guys. Going out tomorrow and start buying your favorite lures. If its like all the rest of the ""stuff"" I buy I should be able to keep it under $200 Ha Ha. Im taking two 7 1/2 med/hvy rods with Garcia C4 reels. Im thinking about tieing on 20lb test easy cast Trilene and 6"" steel leader. Let me know if you think this is a good combo for Mr. Toothy....Thanks A Bunch"
519167,Guest,2002-04-11 07:34:00,0,"Sounds like a good approach but I would look at a 12"" leader vs the six. Problem is like Tim said above there are some big Pike and even bigger Muskies in that lake and if you get a 40"" pike and he pulls the lure in a ways the 6"" leader is not long enough to avoid the teeth and you will lose it. I now use Whiplash on most of my casting reels (stay with the 65# or 80# if you go this way) but have used the 20# trilene for years with good results.Have fun,Paul"
519168,Guest,2002-04-11 08:01:00,0,Thanks again guys...You all keep talking about MUSKIE. Are there some other lures I can spend my money on that will at least make me think I have a real Muskie lure on when Im beating the water up with casts???...Thanks
519169,Guest,2002-04-11 12:53:00,0,"Early in the year you do not need a monster bait. You can look at the magnum Rapalas (6"" to 8"" baits are fine), Bucher Shallow and Depth Raiders, Small Jakes and the same stuff you will be using for Pike. Early in the year the smaller baits are better in my view. Please note that Muskie season does not open on Lac Seul until the 3rd Saturday of June (6/15 this year). There is no closed season on Pike and Walleye season opens on the 3rd Sat. in May (5/18 this year)."
519170,Randy,2002-04-11 20:58:00,53,"Paul, Thanks for the info. Looking frward to having some fun with Toothy Fellas during Walleye down time."
519171,Guest,2002-04-12 10:06:00,0,My pleasure Randy and good luck. Don't forget to take a mouth spreader tool as it makes it easier on both the fisherman and fish.Paul
519172,zugbug,2002-04-12 22:26:00,67,"One Bait I can Vouch for is Northlands Bionic Bucktail Spinner Bait. Orange and Black colors. Basically a muskie sized Spinnerbait. I have also seen this lure take some very nice Walleye's also. Look Shallow this year. Don't be afraid to get it right up on the bank. Bait Cast reel and 6'6"" or 7' Med Heavy Rod. Would be good bets. Trusty Abu 5500 C3 or Shimano Castiac(for Style Points) Would do the trick."
