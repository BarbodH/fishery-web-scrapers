Previous trips have been in early June and we have done very well. We just want to try something different and escape the bugs! Hopefully the water temps. will be cool enough then that the pike will be in the shallows. If they are still in deep water, what is the best bait and presentation for deep water pike? Trying to gather as much information as we can for our anual father/son fishing trip. Hope you can relate past experiances. Thanks.Dave"
