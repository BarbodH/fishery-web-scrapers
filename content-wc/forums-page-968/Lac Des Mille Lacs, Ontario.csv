The Thunderbird Resort is on Cushing Lake on the north end of the LDML system. I am told we must travel 40 minutes SOUTH by boat to fish in the southern end of LDML. Can you give me some tips on where and what to fish for walleyes, pike and smallies? Any known boating hazards to steer clear of?"
519154,Wenty,2002-04-10 08:58:00,15,"pfg1,I doubt that you'll have to travel 40 miles to the south shores of LDML to catch fish. The spring and early summer weather will play a role in fish location in early July. For walleyes I would certainly expect Broad Point and the west side of Bull Island to be holding walleyes, especially if you get a chop out of the west. If it's calm, try the west side of Burnt Island (little island just off the north end of Broad Point). This area is loaded with structure and varying depths. I would also opt for Honkonen Narrows, NW of Broad Point and fish some of the holes in the 20-25' ranges. Along the weedlines you'll no doubt encounter the odd Northern. From there I'm up to Owl Island and fishing the north and west sides. To me the key in early July is to fish wind swept shorelines with adjacent deep water, or mid lake structures.The past couple of years, the gap west of Evertt's Point between the island on the way to the Blow-out has been vary good for walleyes. This area is prior to Broad Point and even closer to where you will be staying. Once through the Blow-out you have quick access to Fisherman's Island and the south side of the lake. I doubt that you'll even have to venture there. All the areas that I have described will hold both walleyes and pike, although Honkonen would be a good bet for pike.As for smallies, I've never caught one in LDML, and I've fished the lake since my childhood, but who knows maybe they do exist.As for rocks, they exist! I can mark a map and leave it with Carey at the T-bird if you like. I think the Ministries is working on a detailed map of LDML with GPS markings for water hazards, but I don't think that it will be ready until next this fall. You could take a lifetime to learn all of this lake. When I'm unsure of new waters, I go slooooooooow.Have fun and please practice Catch/Photo/and Release."
519155,PJM,2002-04-10 20:37:00,3516,Wenty You sure no a lot about the lake and I enjoy reading your post about the lake. As far as smallmouth bass the past three years we have caught quite a few and every year they are getting bigger. And what I mean by bigger the first year they were like 6 to 8 inches long and last year they were like 10 to 12 inches long. We have only caught them in one place on the lake and that is down by the Birch Narrows. Any question please post back.
519156,Wenty,2002-04-11 06:23:00,15,"PJM,I believe you on the smallies. Rumors of that fish being caught are exactly where you say, in Birch Narrows. I'll have to give it a shot.Thank you!"
519157,PJM,2002-04-11 07:41:00,3516,Wenty Do you know where Shopers Bay is down by the Birch Narrows?
519158,pfg1,2002-04-11 21:36:00,52,Wow. I wasn't expecting such a detailed response and a generous offer. Thanks for the great info. My son and I just got a 2001 map of LDML with depths. Can I mail it to you now for mark-up? Please email your mailing address to [email protected]
519159,PJM,2002-04-11 21:43:00,3516,pfg1 WHere did you get that map I have been looking for a new one.
519160,Guest,2002-04-14 06:46:00,0,"hey, pfg1 Where did you get a map with depths? I sure could use one. Thanks I'm going to Cushing Lake first week of July."
519161,pfg1,2002-04-14 19:19:00,52,"I have received a flood of email requests for map info on LDML. Here's what I know:Go to www.fishingmap.com and punch in Item Code 20138-c. That will get you the LDML map with depths shipped for $11.70US. I also got a lead to two bait shops on LDML with maps: Kay's SPort & Gift 807-986-2379; and LDML Bait Shop 807-986-2315.Fish On, DAP"
