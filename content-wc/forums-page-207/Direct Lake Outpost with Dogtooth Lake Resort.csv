5260186,JJLundo,2017-01-08 14:00:00,8,"Buckeye, you're talking about Dogtooth Lake, right? I'm wondering about their outpost on Direct Lake."
5260218,buckeye1,2017-01-08 14:33:00,269,Yes fished Dogtooth many times. We bring our own boats. The resort is right off the highway. You have to boat out to the outpost cabin.
