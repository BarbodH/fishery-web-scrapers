I noticed some advertisements for the Lindy Wally Talker, which seems to be patterned after the Lindy Perch Talker lure. The Wally Talker lure was primarily promoted when ice fishing for walleyes. What do you think of the prospects for this lure when vertical jigging for walleyes, say in mid-summer through autumn?Good fishing and tight lines!!"
