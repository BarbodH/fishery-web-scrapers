Here is the link to it on another site as i'm not sure how to rewrite it here and add all the pics in it. http://www.canadafishingguide.net/fo...owl-lake-2016/ Thanks for reading Mike

In the course of a week, it seems that being windbound at least one day is the norm. I can fish in just about any conditions, but I am very cautious about exposure to high winds in an outpost boat."
