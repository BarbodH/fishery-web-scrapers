What is a good estimate based on current gas prices for the cost of resort gasoline per liter this summer? I know that's tough to predict but give me a ball park. Also, do resorts charge for gas in Canadian or US dollars? I've taken just one Canadian trip in the last few years and can't remember. Question for those who fish the bigger lakes i.e. LOTW, Lac Seul, etc---how many gallons, or liters, of gas do you use for a week? I can remember a LOTW trip where my gas bill approached my cabin cost (split cabin cost with others)."

If it is an island camp, and they have to ship it out... it will be quite a bit more. That depends on how far out, how they ship it, and all the extra costs. I tell people that if you double what you're paying at the pump in the US, that is a good expectation to pay on the mainland. (so, if you're paying $2/gal at the pump, expect $4/gal at the lake in Canada) At least that's close. Both of those prices would be what you pay in USD. Right now, Fort Francis pump prices are right around $1.09 per litre (CAN)"
5254530,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-05 07:51:00,447,"If I recall correctly, I paid $1.04-$1.07 at a mainland resort the last time I was on LOTW which was 7 or 8 years ago. I think my gas bill was around $450 that year. I'm taking 2 trips north of the border this year and would be very happy at an estimated $1.40/liter."
5254666,bigwalleye1,2017-01-05 08:16:00,2632,"Seems like regardless of prices or exchange rate, in 15 years of going to Lac Seul, I don't think I've seen gas in Sioux Lookout much over $1.22 a liter, or much under $1.18 CDN. It's kind of the end of the road, not many choices. At least just south of town at the turnoff you can get non-ox boat gas as well as regular gas, but to get diesel, you have to go to town."
5254682,GBS,2017-01-05 08:20:00,2271,"Of course, how much you will use depends on a host of factors. As an example, my Alumacraft with an old 115 2 stroke can burn 3x the amount of gas a similar sized Lund Fisherman with a 115 Yamaha for the same amount of use. Hence why I am not allowed to bring my boat......."

5254722,pjshorthorn,2017-01-05 08:30:00,5654,We paid $1.29 CDN at the lodge last year. It was competitive with pump pricing in the area and very fair IMO. PjShorthorn.
5254770,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-05 08:46:00,447,"I love to explore and will drive past spots where I know I could catch fish just to find more spots where I can catch fish. I simply want to see what's around the next bend. That approach burns more gas but it's what I like so it's what I do. (Sometimes drives my boat partners crazy though, that's why I fish solo a lot) I'm curious about how much fuel others burn on a week trip to the bigger lakes. Do others explore when they could be fishing known spots?"
5254786,LOW1,2017-01-05 08:48:00,2828,"My guess is that this summer gas prices will be about US$3.50 - $4.00 at Canadian mainland marinas per US gallon, taking into consideration the exchange rate.You don't really need to go all over the lake to fish and you don't need to go all that fast. A little patience and common sense will make your trip safer and cheaper."
5254826,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-05 09:02:00,447,"LOL Oh but I do NEED to go all over the lake (see my post above) As for speed, there's no way I'm going to speed around when one of the biggest reasons I fish Canada is the scenery. I also value my hull and lower unit. Again, not looking to pinch pennies. After dropping money on a boat, a boat full of tackle, cabin cost, food cost, etc I'm not going to worry in the least about how much fuel I burn. It's a cost of doing business as they say. I guess I worded my OP poorly."
