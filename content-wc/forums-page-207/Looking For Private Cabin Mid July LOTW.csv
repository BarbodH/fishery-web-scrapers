Everyone had an unbelievable time and can't wait to get back this July. The last couple years I've been trying to find a private rental cabin to rent for a couple weeks. If anyone has a rental or knows of one, please contact me. We are looking at July 9th to 22nd. We usually stay on Sabaskong but, are open to other options. I've looked at some on different websites but nothings popped out yet. Any info or ideas would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to PM me. Thanks everyone"
