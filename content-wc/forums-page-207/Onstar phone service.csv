5262866,DanM57,2017-01-10 10:26:00,135,"I have no idea how it works. All I can attest to is Onstar works from the fish camp I go to and my Verizon cell phone, with an international plan, does not. DanM"
5263185,jimirjr,2017-01-10 14:20:00,1149,"Correct Me if I'm wrong, but... Doesn't ON STAR utilize a ""satellite reception, transmission"" system utilizing the small black antenna on the Roof of the vehicle? (Like SIRIUS XM Radio?) I know I can call from the middle of NOWHERE through ON STAR and get reception.."
5263377,prov1800,2017-01-10 15:31:00,5010,I had onstarr.it didnt work when i got to far away from a cell tower.onstarr works from cell towers only. but has a few more watts powering it from the truck rather then your cell phone.iam notvsure what you mean in the middle of no where.when i go tovthe middle of no where i use a small portable 12 volt cell booster.it gives me anither 15 miles off signal.i also bring one of those boosters with me in my boat when i know iam goingvto loose my signal.works awesome.
5263481,Skywagon,2017-01-10 16:17:00,1106,"Verizon does not work with all the cell companies up here, no matter what the plan. Cell service has improved greatly in the last two years, Bell Canada (for one) has put up a lot of new towers, unfortunately for many Americans, Verizon does not work on the Bell Canada system."
5261058,Shellback,2017-01-09 09:00:00,8083,"I have a new Chevy truck with Onstar service. Just got a call from them offering different services. One was phone service good in the US and Canada. They told me they use all available cell towers no matter who owns them. Anyhow it was a 300 minute deal good for 1 year and the ""introductory price was just $9.99 plus tax. As I'll be in Canada 3 different times this year for a total of 6 weeks, I figured for $9.99. what the heck! Anybody use the Onstar phone service and what was your experience? I was told my Bluetooth will still work tied into my regular cellphone, but if I don't have service with it, the Onstar should work. I have a new phone number just for it's use. I never asked about roaming fees, I guess I should have, but they said it was for the US and Canada."
5261154,Pooch,2017-01-09 10:05:00,4618,"A couple years ago we had OnStar phone in a new car. It was a joke in Canada. I had just as good cell service with my Verizon phone. I doubt it has gotten better. If you don't have regular cell service in an area, odds are really good that you won't have OnStar phone either.I had it in my mind that I would be able to call and receive anywhere like a satellite phone. My error back then. Just my experience. Maybe it has improved, but I'm betting against it. If the price is right and there are no hidden charges, heck try it. At worst you have to cancel it. (Keep your cell phone in your back pocket...)Pooch"
5261162,DanM57,2017-01-09 10:07:00,135,"I use Onstar to call home when I am in Canada fishing without a problem. I am calling from NW Ontario, about 15 miles west of Ear Falls. And the area I am in does not have cell phone signal. DanM57"
5261738,Paul H,2017-01-09 17:38:00,1232,"If it does not have cell phone signal, how are you calling? OnStar is just cell service/"
5261930,Pooch,2017-01-09 19:33:00,4618,"He might not have whatever cell signal is available, but OnStar is using any available tower. I have cell service near Ear Falls, but it's been a couple years since I was north of Ear Falls or near Red Lake.I have Verizon service and every year there is more and more signal availability in Ontario or at least on the main highways and towns. There was a recent (last six months) thread about cell coverage in Ontario on this Canada forum.Pooch"
5261962,Oldschool,2017-01-09 19:40:00,163,"OnStar does use cell service; however, it has signal strength 5 times that of a handheld phone. Thus it has better service capabilities than standard phones."
5262298,Bstar,2017-01-10 05:24:00,564,I used onstar a couple of times on a trip to Nakina in 2013. It worked ok. For $9.99 what do you have to lose? I've spent more than that on a glass of good bourbon!
5262346,Shellback,2017-01-10 05:46:00,8083,"I was told it does use cell towers, so I know I'll have to be within range of one. The plus I see is no roaming charges. For $9.99, it's a deal. I'll see what the re up fee is next year!"
5262362,Bstar,2017-01-10 05:54:00,564,FWIW in 2013 I was able to get a 3 month subscription to onstar for my trip. I believe they called it a summer vacation special. I don't remember what it cost but it wasn't expensive. I don't know if they still offer that but if you press the blue onstar button the rep will be able to tell you.
5262370,3M TA3,2017-01-10 06:08:00,2846,"I had it for a year in my Silverado for free, 1 year. Only came with a 100 minutes, good for a year. Worked pretty good. Renewal for second year will blow your socks off. In order to keep the phone active I also had to have ON STAR. BS is all I could say at the time."
