5251274,1/4 oz Jig,2017-01-03 13:07:00,90,Considering exploring new water this year. Was looking into Sabaskong bay area of LOTW. Will be targeting musky in the morning and evening and walleye during the day. How does the walleye fishing here compare to say Eagle or Cedar Lake? Probably looking at a mid July trip. On Eagle and cedar it was primarily jig/minnow. Would it be the same or am I looking at Lindy rigging or bottom bouncers? Another possibility was Indian Lake Chain but I've read mixed reviews on it as far as walleye fishing. Heard it is more known for numbers of musky. Thanks in advance.

We put in at morson and fish west and north. Don't fish sabaskong bay. I've always fished jigs till the summer months than we pull bottom bouncers and spinners. I like pink on LOW or gold. The big differance is the walleyes on low can and will be on the mud flats in the summer. Last summer for me a pink hair jig was deadly. I probably jig about 30% of the time in July and August.

You can catch them all season long, but as the summer goes on, many fishermen abandon the mud for rock humps... which mostly will be located west of Raspberry."
