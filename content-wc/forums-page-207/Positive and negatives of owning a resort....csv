5266481,Fisherman Ted,2017-01-12 09:51:00,461,"First off please don't use any of these posts as a decision maker for buying a lodge. You can have all the lists you want, but at the end of the day it is a lifestyle. Let me repeat. A life style. This is NOT a pizza business, or accounting firm or painting company. In nearly every case you do not look at the books or the Xs and Os to come to the decision this is the business for you.Yes, you look at the books to see if you can afford it and make it work. But you have to really love what you are doing, love the industry, be able to work with people (and I mean REALLY be able to work with all kinds of people in all kinds of conditions, not be good around the water cooler at your current job), and work like you have never worked before.During a quiet week I work 118 hours. Average. That's just standard run of the mill. Now, throw in weather issues. employee problems, guests, equipment issues and my relaxed week is out the window. So know this going in you will work harder in your life than ever before. But hold on you say, you are at a lodge and having fun and working with fishermen. That's not work.And you would be right. Its not work. It is actually HARDER than regular work. Why? Can't be true. Because you are now in the SERVICE INDUSTRY. Service means you are ALWAYS aware of your customer's needs. I fret, and do mean fret, when someone has a bad day on the water. Your success or failure is mine. So, when you have a tough time I am crushed. I want to make it better. Doesn't matter that a front came in and shut down the fishery, or you can't set a hook to save your life. Its on me. And I worry. After a 15 hour day I will have you jump in my personal boat and take you out on my time and dime. Why? Because this is service. And I want you to go away knowing that I (all of us) care more about your trip than sometimes you do.Service means you are always ON. Let that sink in. You don't relax after your 8 hours day, crack a beer, recharge and get ready for your next shift. That is a luxury you don't or will ever have. You are cheerful, helpful, kind, excited, accommodating and welcoming. To everyone. Even guests that think they know more than you. Even guests that think they are better than you. That complain about stuff you can't control. They complain when they find out someone else caught more fish than they did and somehow that's your problem. I had one guest cuss me out in the dining room once because he didn't get to fish a lake (we have 18 mind you) because someone else signed up for it. Yelling and screaming. After I had worked an all nighter with a bad storm coming in and trashing my docks and flooding my boats. Smile. Sir, how about you and I go fishing after dinner and see if we can't find a 30 for you. In my personal boat sir. Would love to take you out. Happens all the time.That's just ONE aspect of the lodge. And customer service is light years ahead of say someone working in a car dealership fixing your Audi. There are so many variables that affect your customer as compared to a blown out clutch. Then of course is your staff. Very, very tough. In my old life I managed 8 figure implementations with staff of 70+. And that was 10 times easier than a crew of 15. Why? Because the workforce is transient, young (think millennial) and not white collar. Your guide didn’t go to grad school at Princeton and intern at the Defense Department. They are young kids. And with this workforce comes its own set of fun times and problems. For the sake of time I will end that there.Then comes the infrastructure. You are in the bush. Something craps out you don’t run down to Walmart to grab a new fridge. You have to be able to learn on the fly, work under intense pressure, and at all times of the day or night. Challenge would be an understatement. I had a customer tell me he knows what I do as he owns a ski-house that he rents out. I nearly laughed out loud when he said that. I own 12 ski-houses. And 42 boats, 48 motors, my own septic system, my own water, 6 hot-tubs, 5 ATVs….I could go on. The infrastructure is complex, constantly aging, and getting hammered by the elements. We have a temperature swing of @ 140 degrees each year. Think what that does to roofs, pipes. Brutal.And the best of the best is the governmental agencies. I have at least 7 different agencies that can and do pop in to make sure I am compliant with the myriad of rules that are constantly changing. They can look at all from septic, water, fire codes, bait, liquor, health, cleanliness, gas storage, propane I could go on. And the inspectors are all over the map sometimes. Can be jerks or cool. Never know what you are going to get. One time the fire marshal came and said I had to replace all my doors in my cabins. They all had to be fire proof, self-closing, 1.75 inches solid doors, some with steel frames. And the smoke detectors were no good. All had to be inter connected. Just so you know you don’t run down and find those doors on the corner. All had to be special ordered and had to be carefully installed. That one visit (with other items) cost me $65,000. Septic 60k. Water 25k. Gas storage 15k. It never ends. Ready to buy a lodge?And the pros. That list is long too. I meet and have friends all over the world. I see grown men cry when they catch the biggest fish of their lives. I get to be part of some of the happiest times of someone’s life. Front and center. Heads of industry hugging me when they walk through my doors. Its Christmas for grown-ups. Really is. I am in arguably one of the prettiest places on earth. I live and breathe it. See storms roll in in all of their fury. New bear cubs and wolf litters each spring. The majestic eagles and ospreys hunting for dinner. Grandfathers teaching their grandsons how to fish, with tears in their eyes. A final dying man’s wish of fishing with his son one last time.I get Christmas cards every year from many of my guests. With heartfelt letters. Not many industries where the client sends YOU a gift. I get calls from guys all winter long wanting to talk about fishing. The excitement from his office palpable. I fall asleep to the smell of smoke wafting out of the fireplace and loons calling for their mates. And wake up to the mist on the water and seeing rising fish on the water as I sip my coffee and see a boat slip away into the dawns early light for someone that will remember this moment for the rest of their lives.I will never leave this place.-FT"
5266513,LOW1,2017-01-12 10:05:00,2828,"It's difficult to respond after FT's heartfelt thoughts. The only thing I would add is that buying a resort at a market price with borrowed money is unlikely to ever be financially sustainable.You would likely need a big downpayment, off-resort employment in the off season, and/or health insurance from somewhere else.It's great that there are resort owners who do what they do with what they have and that for them it's not just a business."
5266665,MrSimon,2017-01-12 11:44:00,922,"Here is my opinion .... and I only run one cottage with two boats.Lodge ownership isn't ""something to do in retirement""You will work ridiculously hard for not a lot of moneyYou must have an unexplainable and somewhat irrational drive and passion in order to be successful - you gotta LOVE it, and WANT it more than anything else""Wondering about the pros and cons"" means you don't have that drive and passionSorry if that sounds harsh, but you asked and that's my opinion."
5266705,Ricky Spanish,2017-01-12 12:06:00,1298,"What a great post. I envy you but I don't at the same time. I have two questions. Did anyone find the body yet, and what place do you run? It sounds like it would be worth looking into."
5270018,Shellback,2017-01-14 05:39:00,8083,"Forkhorn, I'm betting you are going to make 'peanuts"" while operating the camp, especially if carrying a mortgage. Best case scenario would be to cash in selling the lodge at retirement time. Financial rewards would be the last thing I would consider as a reason to buy and run a camp."
5270090,Obabikon,2017-01-14 06:37:00,2370,"The difficulty with buying a resort is pretty simple. You have a lot of different options to purchase, but what it comes down two is this... Option 1: Spend a ton of money on a ""key turn"" resort that is fully functional. Option 2: Spend much less money on a shut down resort, and build it from nothing. If you choose option 1, you need to be in for the long haul. Your mortgage payment will probably be spread out over a couple decades. You need to be very careful in looking at the books. Make sure that the business can afford to pay the mortgage and you a livable wage. Even if you won't be making much, you do have to live. Also, make sure you examine the last 7 years. For tax purposes, owners have to keep all those numbers. If they have more... that's even better. The risk here is that will a small recession cause you to lose the resort? If you choose option 2, you need to be ready to lose money for at least 3 years while you build up the business. It takes time to build a client base. You have to work incredibly hard on the few guests you have. Ensure that they become repeat guests, and do nothing but spread positive news about your place. This might sound simple, but it is a balance. You actually need to become honest friends. Forcing friendships isn't always easy. There is no easy way to do it. But, if you do it... it is worth it. It is a fantastic way to raise your kids. I do have to spend a lot of time away from them, but when I'm home... it is 100% with the family. At the resort, I get to have them with me except in the fall when they go to school. We have so much fun. My wife and I earn less annually right now than we did working when we were 24. However, as you improve the resort, and pay it off both... eventually there is a light at the end of the tunnel. (hopefully)"
5267257,GBS,2017-01-12 17:41:00,2271,"Fisherman Ted of course blew it away with his excellent description. Just need to clarify what Bobby Winds and I were comparing it to - owning a ""joint"" gives one a familiarity with the type of commitment Ted was talking about. Virtually everything Ted noted is true for both, except for the scale of some of the things he deals with. Both are full life commitments, with almost no prospect of earning more than ""getting by"". But if you can get a charge out of juggling 1000 things all the time, develop your employees into responsible adults, and make a customer's life a little better..... Failure at either will always take away everything you have. But if you are the kind that can pull it off, the non-monetary rewards are huge. Just don't expect to be able to go fishing on your own time, ever."
5267633,Fisherman Ted,2017-01-12 20:50:00,461,"Here is one of the best things I see/do each summer. After dinner the docks are bustling with activity with guests going out for the evening bite. Ahead of time I have identified a pair of fishermen that need some extra love. During happy hour each evening its easy to spot someone that had a rough day or is just dying to see a big fish up close. I then grab my boat stored around the corner at my private dock. This boat was one of Al Lindner's and on his TV show a few seasons ago. It has more electronics than an aircraft carrier and is autographed by all the Lindners. Very slick. I pull up to the guest dock and call to the pair of guys I previously identified. ""Hey guys, how about you and me head out and see if we can't find a trophy"" I say. You would have thought I just told them they won the lottery. The look on their faces is priceless. The grin from ear to ear is etched on my brain. We don't have to catch a single fish that evening. The fishing is secondary. To be able to bring joy to someone like that is the best part of my job. Hands down."

5267802,Mike Borger,2017-01-13 02:47:00,1554,Really great heartfelt post Ted.
5267970,HeHooksHimself,2017-01-13 07:04:00,725,"Fisherman Ted, I almost teared up reading your post. For me, just a week or two a year in paradise gets me through ""doing life"" the rest of the year. I so appreciate an owner that is like you and puts themselves in the shoes of their guests. I have had more than one owner treat me like I was a bother. And believe me, I am low maintenance. Salute to you, Ted. On topic, Herb, the former owner of the camp we go to regularly, used to say to me, ""If you like fishing, don't buy a camp because you will never have time to fish. But it is a pretty nice office, eh? I envy the owners but I would rather visit you than live in your shoes. Fish On! Hooks"
5268042,BornToFish,2017-01-13 07:47:00,1224,"Fisherman Ted,Many thanks for your excellent posts on this thread. I have very good friends that own fishing lodges in NW Ontario. I am sure they feel exactly the same way about their lodges and would completely support your comments and observations. Many people are very thankful that lodge owners somehow find enough joy to outweigh the grief that comes with their jobs. It must be time to get out when they no longer find enough joy to offset the grief, as the grief will be ever present.There are threads/posts from time to time on this forum where authors gripe about something or another about fishing lodges or lodge owners - price increases, lodge owners taking advantage of exchange rates, and on and on. I wish that such authors would reflect on Ted's heartfelt comments.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5269666,forkhorn,2017-01-13 19:39:00,10,Thank You all for your honest replies. Your input is valuable. Here is a little bit of my background and some of my rational for even thinking about such an endeavour. Currently late 30's and i am employed in the forestry industry. My current job has me running the operations for a fairly large and successful company. Being that the trees don't grow in the city I live out in a bush camp 5 nights a week. Usually go up sun-Fri. Job is extremely demanding and basically your on call 24 hrs a day. Seems like something goes wrong everyday and your needed. So basically I feel that I could handle the work load and the stress. That being said I would want all the hard work to pay off financially. I wouldn't want to give up a good paying job and make sacrifices to make peanuts. I have hunted and fished all my life and love to do it but my current career has cut that back. My wife is a teacher and is supportive of the idea. My thought process is that I am gone most of the year anyways. And if we did something like this her and the kids would help in the summer. This would equal more time as a family. Then in the winter I would be off when she is at work and could look after the household.... And maybe do a little late season archery hunting and ice fishing.
5269698,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-13 20:05:00,447,"Some kids love spending summers at a lake. Others hate being away from friends. Teenagers tend to be busy with jobs, summer sports, boyfriends/girlfriends, etc. It might be helpful to hear how resort owners handle raising kids. I'm just guessing but I think a lot of repairs/upgrades to infrastructure are done during the off season. Possibility of having to hit the sport shows in the winter to drum up business. Probably employee hiring, contract signing for gas, food, bait, etc, taxes, purchase of new boats and motors, and numerous other tasks. My guess is that there isn't much dead time in a resort owner's year but I suppose it depends on the resort. All those things are manageable but the family aspect is not one to be taken lightly."

Being a canadian and my wife being fully employed health coverage wouldn't be an issue as well. I am thinking I currently work for company which I don't have any ownership into. I could be working my butt off for myself instead of someone else. Don get me wrong I like my Job and I am good at it. But also take on a lot of responsibilities and time away from my own life for someone else's gain. I wouldn't work any other way. But I feel I am shorting myself out. I thought about other business also but they are year round and wouldn't offer the same family 'rewards'. I also know that I love the outdoors and work outside 90% of the time so being inside wouldn't work.

5266761,Obabikon,2017-01-12 12:32:00,2370,"Fantastic post FT. I agree with everything you said. Bailing boats at 3AM after a down pour, then waking up and working a normal day (17 hours)... it can be hard to say the least. I think that's the big difference in most businesses. You are literally on call 24 hours / 7 days for months on end. Not one day off during the season. You wake up working, and you fall asleep working. That make me think of the worst feeling I get as an owner... I'm awoken at night by a knocking on the door. From the time it takes me to put on some clothes, and then get to the door to see what's the matter... a million possibilities have run through my head. That's a gut wrenching feeling... most end up being something broken or so and so has had too much to drink or we have run out of alcohol... do you have any? But, we are responsible for people's safety. It can be scary. We had an emergency last summer. I did the 8 mile boat ride in the middle of the night, and then a friend raced him to the hospital. Everything was fine, nothing major... but man you can feel the stress."
5266817,prov1800,2017-01-12 12:53:00,5010,Your stories sound scary.but your still at it.i deal with a lot if camp owners and dont know any that want to get out.they all love itbut look forward to the quieter weeks in the fall.they all seem to do quite well in the financial dept also.but yes there are costs as with any business.
5266833,Fisherman Ted,2017-01-12 13:03:00,461,"Too funny. For me its this. Getting a phone call between 8-9 AM on my cell phone. This is when all of my fisherman are just arriving at their out-lakes way out in the bush and means there is likely a problem with a boat or motor. Or, getting a text between mid-night and 5 AM. I have to sleep with my phone next to my ear and always tell my friends if they call or text me in the summer in the middle of the night I will kill them as it nearly always means there is a problem."
5266841,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-12 13:03:00,447,"I was convinced I never want to own a resort...then I read the last part of FT's post. Ted, that entire post was well-written and engaging but your last paragraphs were inspiring. Well done."
5267025,Juls,2017-01-12 14:22:00,13414,Great post Fisherman Ted... Loved it! You could always make some extra money writing...that was spot on. 203 more days until we head north again....can't wait! I miss the Loons.
5267177,yoopertrout,2017-01-12 16:34:00,1172,"I've never owned a camp, so I'm guessing: Downsides 1. Long work hours during the fishing season. Probably don't get to fish much, and if you guide, you will be turning your hobby into a job. 2. The need to be a jack of all trades to keep expenses down (profit would dip every time you have to drive a motor a long way to town for repairs.) 3. I bet it isn't an easy way to get rich. In Ontario (where I've been) there is a lot of competition, and some of the best deals for resorts in Canada. There's got to be a lot of overhead - cabins, boats, fuel, food, employees etc. etc. 4. Being an entrepeneur is always risky. 5. Having to manage employees. Pluses 1. Being your own boss. 2. Working in a beautiful place. 3. Sense of accomplishment. 4. Busman's holidays - getting to fish in a great place when you do get to fish. If you do it, good luck."

The operations that would interest me most are the drive-to style operations. Thanks and please PM if you don't wanna post."

5265625,Guest,2017-01-11 19:37:00,0,Not knowing whether to charge U.S. or Canadian dollar. See posts below and think twice Also use walleye central to screen guests before you book them. lol
5265665,That Minnesota guy,2017-01-11 19:57:00,8293,Pro's being your own boss. Cons making a job out of a hobby. I think the biggest plus would be meeting some great guys who share the same things you like.
5265889,Pooch,2017-01-12 02:21:00,4618,"Lot more work than most think and you'll never get to fish as much as you probably do now. I thought long and hard about buying a camp we liked, but sure glad I didn't go that route. Being self employed I have a lot of empathy for folks that own and run camps. Looks easy when you are only there for a week or two a year and in the nice weather part of the year.Pooch"
5265897,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-12 03:42:00,447,"I had briefly considered buying a resort as a money making ""hobby"" when I retire in 5-6 years. Did a search here on WC and talked to my wife and we agreed it was too much work. Plus I want to explore new places when I retire, not be locked down to one lake or area. Good luck if you do pursue it."
5265929,Obabikon,2017-01-12 04:37:00,2370,"Without a doubt the worst part is a combination of the hours and stress. There are 1000 different things you're worried about 24 hours a day. (government, guests, boats, food, generator, income... just to name a few). There are times in the summer that my wife comes to me, grabs me by the hand and says... ""go lie down"". I know other resort owners who have ended up in the hospital because of lack of rest. There are a ton of positives about it though. You make some AMAZING friends in this business. Employees, competitors and guests alike... it is fantastic. I love being able to take my kids fishing off the dock for a few minutes everyday, or to load up as a family and go catch lunch to have them help cook. It is an unbelievable way to raise children. I love being my own boss too (or at least only reporting to my wife). I wake up in the middle of one of God's greatest creations every single day during the season. There are too many times I take that for granted."
