5152234,David Anderson,2016-10-13 14:01:00,2073,"Well one has to mention Lac Seul Outposts http://www.lacseuloutposts.com/ in Chamberlain Narrows. It is 37 miles from the landing and has nice accommodations and offers minnows, gas, beer, without having to go back into town. Deception Bay landing is about 10 miles northeast of Sioux Lookout and easy to drive to. It's a long way back there but you can follow the camp boats back in in the morning or get a Navionics map and follow the houseboat trails. It is secluded but still great fishing."
5152242,wooglin,2016-10-13 14:03:00,371,"Thanks David, that is a lodge that is on our list. It will be one we hit in the future. We've fished out of Sioux Lookout 4 times, and once out of Ear Falls - always a walleye trip though. I know the musky population on that side of the lake is better than everywhere else, so it's a place we want to hit someday."
5153090,milfish,2016-10-14 11:00:00,249,I agree with David. Can't beat Lac Seul Outposts. Read my post from last earlier this week about our trip last week. You can't go wrong. Can't speak about the musky fishing but we always have them on with one of our walleyes in their mouth. I have caught 3 trolling for walleyes in the past 20 years but have never targeted them. Seen some really big muskies and reports of 60+ fish being present. Of course the Jacobsen musky is from that water. Good luck!
5256602,fishmanric,2017-01-06 08:38:00,219,Probably some of the most fun I have ever had is boating to http://stokesbayresort.com/. Ash River Trail launching point from the Frontier Lodge heading to Kettle Falls and portaging over to Canadian side of Rainy Lake. Stokes Bay is definitely a fishing camp. Southern most outpost in Canada. Fishing is incredible as well.
5256938,Cil,2017-01-06 11:29:00,10,www.cedarislandlodge.com 1 hr from the border main lodge with only 4 cabins also has a super nice outpost 3 bedroom 2 bathroom flush toilets showers and generate to power lights and charge trolling batteries. Hope you find a great Canadian fishing vacation ðŸ˜Š
5257346,That Minnesota guy,2017-01-06 14:57:00,8293,I see their lodge boat on the Ash River Trail quite a bit. Might need to check them out sometime. How long a ride once you do the portage at Kettle Falls?
5257986,fishmanric,2017-01-06 21:36:00,219,"That Minnesota Guy, camp is about fifteen to twenty minutes from Kettle Falls. They have four cabins plus the Big House that they use and it's $50 a night if you bring your own boat."
5258410,packpro,2017-01-07 09:06:00,695,"Our group has taken trips to both Ghost River and Anglers Kingdom. Great fishing both places. Great camp owners both places. No issues with either camp. AK is walleye and pike. Ghost river is walleye, pike, and smallmouth. Both were great numbers lakes, and both had plenty of larger fish mixed in. We will definitely go back to either camp."
5149305,wooglin,2016-10-11 08:53:00,371,"Looking for recommendations for a boat-in outpost in Canada as we'd like to avoid the large 'resort-like feel' outfitters. We are a group of 4-6 guys with our own boats, geared up to target walleye and musky. American plan and housekeeping plans are both OK, but we prefer something more remote and less populated. We have fished Lac Seul out of Sioux Lookout and Ear Falls in the past, and also fished the Woman River system from the boat-in outpost cabin out of the Woman River Camp. Considering Century Lodge on Eagle Lake. We are coming from WI, so the Northwest Ontario region is preferred. Please share your recommendations and experiences. Thank you."
5149409,Bill Krejca,2016-10-11 10:35:00,6107,"O'Sullivan's Rainbow has an outpost cabin about 5 miles from the camp. It is on an island in the middle of 0ome of the best fishing in the lake. Nice dock, beach, outhouse, propane lights, no generator, but one could be brought in for battery charging. Very cool place. Bill"
5149417,adempsey2.0,2016-10-11 10:37:00,612,A few boat-in outposts that offer musky fishing and I had bookmarked:http://www.barkerbay.com/RangerBayOutpostCabins.phphttp://canadafishinghunting.com/acco...lake-outposts/http://www.sandlakeoutpost.com/index.htmhttp://www.ontariohuntingfishing.com...shing-camp.htmhttp://www.reddenscamp.com/outposts.phphttp://www.bellislandoutpost.ca/http://french.totemresorts.com/http://www.fishinglakeofthewoods.com/http://www.smithcamps.com/fishing-at...d-outpost.html

5151650,wooglin,2016-10-13 06:38:00,371,Which place are you referring to?

5151666,UpNorthGuy,2016-10-13 06:48:00,53,"Knotty Pine Lodge is a good boat in camp. Located on the English River down stream from Ear Falls. The main lodge is apartment style but new this year is separate cabins along the shore line. can be found here http://knottypineslodge.com/ Tell Norm hi from me English River in this area is great for all types of fishing. Walleye are the king, but plenty of areas to find Pike and Smallies. Good to great Muskie fishing for the experienced fisherman. You can even find some Laker's if Norm will share his spots."
5151682,Obabikon,2016-10-13 06:57:00,2370,"I have a very nice outpost about a mile north of our resort. It sleeps 6-8 guys, has two docks for parking boats, has a generator, propane fridge and stove. Really nice cabin with a steel roof, and a fantastic view of the narrows heading into Obabikon Lake. Also, just put 6 brand new mattresses in it. The cabin would be approximately a 9 mile boat ride from the nearest launching point."
5151698,tyeeguy,2016-10-13 07:13:00,111,I go to Whitefish Bay Camp on Lake of the Woods. It is an hour north of International Falls out of Nestor Falls. It is 5 miles from the boat landing on an island so it has a remote feel. It isn't the newest camp but has the necessities for a good fishing trip. They are at all the All-Canada shows and some of the Twin Cities fishing shows if you want to meet them in person.Http://whitefishbaycamp.com
5151714,Ricky Spanish,2016-10-13 07:23:00,1298,"We stayed at Eagle Lake Island Lodge, but it was the 1st year under the new owners. We were pretty much ignored, which had its benefits, but we ended up having to go to another lodge for minnows. They only had worms. Their prices were pretty reasonable, if I recall. We go a couple times a year to that other lodge, and it looks like Island Lodge has been spruced up quite nicely since we were there. South Shore Lodge is also a boat-to camp. http://www.eaglelakeislandlodge.ca/http://www.southshorelodge.com/ Oh, and I have caught many fish within sight of Century Lodge, so..."
