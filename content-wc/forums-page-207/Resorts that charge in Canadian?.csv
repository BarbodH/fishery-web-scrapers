How about any one Kardashian for Dan Aykroyd? You can't tell me you wouldn't make that trade. LOL Lighten up, we're all joking and wishing it was summer time! I'm sorry to continue with the hijacking of this thread. I really was meaning to stop."

So, we gut education, health care, protective services, and reward big donors. ok I will shut up now."

Out of the now 25 posts to his thread the OP has had only 5 that answered his question. The rest are about a bunch of BS that has no bearing on the original poster's question. C'mon guys take that crap and post it on the general discussion board! Just my opinion.

Despite it being the home of the Vikings, Minnesota is too nice a state to give away. All things considered, I think New York in exchange for the three above mentioned provinces would be a nice trade. Maybe throw in the upper peninsula of Michigan."
