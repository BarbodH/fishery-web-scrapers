5272874,Rich B,2017-01-15 21:18:00,1081,"Am looking for helpful links to smaller campgrounds on a northern lake (with decent fishing) where my wife and I can spend time in the upcoming summers, with seasonal camping. We would ideally like to ""park"" a camper unit at the camp site for the summer, and then store it nearby off season. We are 2 years away from my wife retiring (yes, she is younger and better looking), and we would like to check out campgrounds between now and then when we're traveling up north for a week or two this summer and again next summer. Have run several prior searches on WC and the net, though only found a handful that may fit what we were looking for, and thought I'd ask on WC. Ideally we are looking for a smaller resort or camp that has attached a family campground that offers seasonal campsites for trailers with hook-ups/etc as we're not looking for a large campground with the swimming pool, kids playground, etc. Even a northern Minnesota or northern Michigan campground would work, as long as it has that ""up north"" type location and is on a decent fishing lake. thanks, Rich B"

5273354,NARDA 1,2017-01-16 09:00:00,636,Check out www.birchdalelodge.com Give Marcel a call 807-227-5262 he might also be able to work something out for storage also.
5273394,LOW1,2017-01-16 09:20:00,2828,"Sioux Narrows Provincial Park has some seasonal sites on LOTW. It's just north of Sioux Narrows, ON. There are also seasonal spots on Caliper Lake at Caliper Lake Provincial Park, near Nestor Falls ON. There are marinas and resorts in the area which may be able to help you with off season storage.And perhaps a resort that has a campground would rent a seasonal space even if seasonal spaces are not advertised if the price was right, etc? Find a lake that you are interested in and call around. If that resort doesn't offer it, they probably know of someone who does."
5273850,Lazy Fisherman,2017-01-16 13:30:00,276,You might want to check out Lake of the Woods Houseboats and R.V. Park. Sounds like it might be what you are looking for.http://lowhouseboats.com/
5274394,Baseline,2017-01-16 17:42:00,3207,"The Landings, Redgut Bay Rainy Lake. You can store your unit right at the resort."
5274562,billy weaver,2017-01-16 19:12:00,470,"I have not ever stayed there but I motor past it every year on my way up lake. (Gawley's Parkview Camp). I looks nice and is close to the highway at Perrault Falls, Ontario. I don't know anything about rates etc. I always thought that maybe I would check it out some year. It is in a shielded area and close to Dutchie's General Store on HY#105. You might check out their web-site."
5274594,The tank,2017-01-16 19:31:00,340,I would second gawleys parkview camp. We stayed in there cabins several times. Brevin and Afton are awsome host.and dutchies being right at the end of the driveway is convenient.
