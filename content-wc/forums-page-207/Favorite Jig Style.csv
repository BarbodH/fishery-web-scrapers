5269538,kzoofisher,2017-01-13 18:46:00,5144,"Two favorites here: ball for vertical and darter head for casting. Mostly fish with plastics, usually heavier when casting than when vertical. 1/8 ad 1/4 see the most action with 1/16 and 3/8 filling in depending on conditions."
5264265,BornToFish,2017-01-11 07:00:00,1224,"Greetings,I thought I would throw out the following question during the season of winternet: What is your favorite style of jig when fishing for walleyes north of the border? As a follow-up question, how do you use this jig?I'm not referring to color or the weight of the jig, but that information wouldn't hurt either. My favorite style of jig is Do-It's Live Bait Jig tipped with a live or frozen/salted minnow. I normally make these jigs with #1 or #1/0 short shank hooks, but have recently switched to Gamakatsu's 604BN hook in size #2/0 or even #3/0. Most of my jigs are painted with gold glitter or chartreuse glitter powder paint. I use this jig for vertical jigging or pitching.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5264433,Fishoil,2017-01-11 08:22:00,1277,"I pour Do-it round head jigs with Eagle Claw #570 hooks by the hundreds and use them almost exclusively. Mostly 1/4 oz unless fishing deep water, current, or wind and usually orange/green. Generally I use a white twister tail and add a salted minnow if needed. I used to play around with lots of colors and jig styles more but have become less inclined to do so since the above combo catches plenty of fish for me."
5265225,MN_Moose,2017-01-11 15:46:00,964,"my favorite style of jig is a sharp one. Comes sharp, stays sharp and oh ya, paint isn't filling the eye. Other than that I'd fish about anything. I tend to stay away from the ""live bait"" collarless jigs."
5265361,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2017-01-11 17:14:00,240,"Hi--I'm very partial to Northland Tackle fireball and stand-up jigs. Great for jigging with leeches and minnows. If I use salted minnows, I always use a twister tail, to add some bulk to the presentation. I also have hundreds of their gum-drop floaters for lindy rigging. Not happy production has gone to China, though."
5265385,Pooch,2017-01-11 17:32:00,4618,"I haven't found a jig yet that won't catch a walleye. That said I still have my favorite style and it's a short shanked live bait jig. I've fished long shank and short and see no difference other than a traditional long shank is more versatile in how it can be used to hook a minnow, plastic and it holds more crawler than a live bait short shank. There is a reason it's called a ""live bait jig"".I'm not so sure the ""stand up"" jigs do actually stand up. I've got some of them also and (for me) don't see any advantage. MAYBE if you are fishing plastic and the plastic is buoyant they might help stand your presentation up. But to set there like I envision them advertised? Not buying it.Some of the pancake type jigs (don't see them much anymore) have an erratic drop and that could sometimes be of value.I'm betting that a traditional long shanked, collared, ball jig has caught more fish than anything else ever invented. Plus, way more guys fish with them than anything else. So it's a safe bet...It's just personal preference and how you are using the jig. Colors, size all matter, but the biggest factor is the guy ""driving"" the jig. We have one guy in our group who always puts more fish in the boat than anyone else. He is so in touch with his jig at all times. His brain or minds eye is on the bottom with his jig. He is catching fish when his boat mates are going ""bite less"" or so they think.Pooch"
5268322,HeHooksHimself,2017-01-13 09:44:00,725,"Every year I buy different kinds of jigs which adds plenty of weight to my tackle box which might be useful for anchoring, but I find when I run out of sunrise colored thumper jigs I begin to panic. Honestly, I think I am just going to quit pretending and rid my tackle box of every jig I probably won't use, which would be everything but my thumper jigs. There is just something about the flash that puts walleye in my boat. Now these things aren't cheap (about .75-$1/ea.), but they are worth it to me. Fish On! Hooks"
5268578,prov1800,2017-01-13 10:49:00,5010,My favourite jig is the one that catches fish.lol.most jigs will catch fish.i just happen to use tonny puccios (baitrigs.com) jigs.they are very well made and he uses mustad hooks.they also light up under water which is always good in stained water and no paint in the hole.plus the hole is big and very easy to get line through.also more money than cheap jigs.also has the jigs with the spinner blade attached.
5268626,JayM5209,2017-01-13 11:05:00,1050,"Ya nailed it! I've been lugging a ton of jigs around for years, all styles, colors, sizes, including some in my tackle trays/bags I know are 20 years old. You've given me the kick I need to give them away. I like to jig, but all I need are Road Runner jigs, chartreuse or white, chenille body, various sizes up to 1/4 oz. Tip with plastic and/or half of a crawler. Time to simplify, and to relieve my back!"
5268642,Ricky Spanish,2017-01-13 11:07:00,1298,"I generally use the Northland Gumball with the red, lighter wire, hook. I can get them out of a snag easier. Perch pattern seems to be my go to. I try to find the ones that aren't painted over the eye. I have been trying Slow-Fall jigs around woody cover and cribs this summer/fall. I think I have lost less jigs to snags, but I don't like the price difference. Less time tying on a jig probably equals more fish for me, though."
5268834,MikeG1,2017-01-13 13:12:00,434,"Hands down I like floaters. I use them with a lindy rig, regular slip sinker, or bottom bouncer. I tip them with a minnow, part of a crawler or even a twister tail. Often times I will add a stinger hook. Love the floaters!!!!!!"
