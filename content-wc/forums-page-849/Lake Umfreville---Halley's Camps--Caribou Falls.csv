534021,Guest,2003-07-31 18:20:00,0,Hasn't anyone who uses this site been up there in the last month?
534031,Guest,2003-08-01 09:29:00,0,We were up there the last week of May and water levels were normal. The current charts show very low outflow but normal levels.http://www.lwcb.ca/pdf/EnglishRivera...2003.07.31.pdf The fishing was great when we were there but of course that was an early spring pattern with the fish shallow. I have not fished there during the summer months. Paul

Here is a link to an article you should read before you go, the Indians are now charging $100cn toll to pass over there land, for us it was only $50cn so the rate seems to be varying. Oh, and the road through the reservation is as rough as ever.http://winnipeg.cbc.ca/regional/serv...emoong20030808 Other than that we had a great trip, fishing was good as usuall. Caught fish in Umphreville, Gibb, Twellnor, and One Man, but we had our best fishing in Gone Lake, caught tons of fish a lot of 22-25 inch walleye's, a few 27 and a 30. With the exception of Gone Lake it seemed as if the walleye were not really biting until after noon. The water level seems normal, the dam is not running at all. Hope you have a nice trip."

I plan on bringing up some leeches for my trip and using mostly Jigs , Does that sound ok or do you reccomend any other baits, I am familar with Twellner and Gibb . But it has been over Ten years since I last fished up there due to military life it has it's down falls, Flip"
