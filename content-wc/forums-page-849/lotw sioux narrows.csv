Their website has a lot of information written by their camp educators about what is working and what is not. Look under ""fishing reports"" in the main page. Hope this helps.www.witchbay.com"
534320,Guest,2003-08-12 12:03:00,0,"Just got back on Sunday. Fishing was slow. Temp dropped about 4degrees and some rain slowed them down. By Sat temp was back up and did good on humps in Yellow Girl. Bottom bouncer in 10-16' worked as it did 2 weeks before that. Had some slip bobber spots in Long Bay but they were really hit and miss. The kids did get 6- 18"" in 3 nights of bobber fishing. It's fun being outfished by a 3 yr. old!!! Good luck- Dennis"

534331,Guest,2003-08-12 17:19:00,0,"Did get one 16"" or so smallie. Caught more smallie that week than ever before, but most seem to be small 12-15"" but very fat bellies! Anytime I tried fishing shallower than 12' all I could get were smallies and northerns! Fun to catch but not what I was looking for.Dennis"

I'm new there and still learning the lake, but the fishing has been pretty good for me. The fish aren't everywhere like they were in the spring, but if you search hard you will be rewarded with some hot walleye fishing. I'm heading back out there tonight so we'll see what happens."
534419,Guest,2003-08-16 09:42:00,0,Hi just started going to LOTW 2 years ago. we were out to yellow girl bay but did not see any humps. where are you talking about? Had to go past the smiley face and then left toward sunset trail to find walleyes.
