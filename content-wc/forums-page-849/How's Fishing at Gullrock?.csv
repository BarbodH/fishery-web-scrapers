533855,Guest,2003-07-27 15:39:00,0,Where do you stay?
533858,Guest,2003-07-27 19:44:00,0,"Just spent last week up there..stayed at Golden Hook. We did pretty well on Walleyes considering the time of year. A few days we had to work at it...the water temperature has not been consistent. We also ran into a major lightning storm which messed things up for a day or so. Unfortunately, the walleyes are pretty spread out, so we did not hit a ""great hot spot"" really, but we did catch fish most places we went. Gullrock Island is probably the best place, if the wind isn't too bad. This is a good place to hit early in the morning or late in the evening. All around the island is a general flat that is mainly between 5-12 feet. Once you get out past that 12 foot area, it drops down to 40 feet. The West corner of Gullrock Island is the best. Troll up and down that drop off...we mainly concentrated between 20 and 30 feet. If you take a line west of the marker, drop some markers at about the 18 foot mark. You can go straight east until it really drops off then turn south and run the same ridge. Once in a while, be sure to jump up on the 10-12 foot flat to check that out as well. We caught some nice ones there too when they came up out of the deep to feed. Straight across the lake to the west there is an island and a point that are pretty good too. I don't know that it has a name, but we call it Sauger Island because seem to catch a good number of Saugers there. We caught a few nice big ones there off the point of that island, but it is mainly good for catching fish that are more of the 16 inch variety. We caught them mostly in 20-25 feet. A couple point south of there, at the heel of the boot, was not quite as good as in previous years. The toe of the boot was getting fished by a couple other boats in the morning, but we didn't try it. There is an island just to the SE of the boot that has a red marker on the south side. Fishing the south and west side of this produced some good fish. There are some rocks that will snag you up. We did pretty well at Roberts Island, which is in Keg Lake just south of where the river comes in. The south tip of this island is pretty rocky and snaggy, but it can produce some bigger fish. This is one you would want to do the first thing in the morning if you go. There are a couple other spots we hit, but I have rambled enough. I should also point out that we did very little jig fishing, which is what most people do. We typically tie our own spinners and fish by back trolling. This seems to work the best for us. It is tougher when the waves are bad enough to back troll into, and sometimes we have to motor up and drift back with the wind. We did very little Northern fishing. Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions and I will try to check back."
533859,Larry S,2003-07-27 20:22:00,666,"Bret,Thanks for the info. This will be our first time at Gullrock,staying at Five Lakes Lodge. I have a map of Gullrock,just where is Gullrock Island?,I found the other spots you talked about. I also tie my own spinners,did you do better with nightcrawlers,leeches or minnows?I like to use leeches or crawlers at this time of the year. Thanks again for the info Larry S"
533881,Guest,2003-07-28 10:36:00,0,"Larry We just resturned from Gullrock this past Saturday and stayed at Five Lakes Lodge. At the end of the trip I pointed out to Melinda our hot spots for the week. We also back trolled with spinners more than jigging this year. It was one of our best years with many fish in the 22-25"" range. Our biggest fish was 26-1/4 for the week. If you concentrate on the structure and once you find them target that area and you will do real well. Mention my mane to Melinda and ask her to show you on the maps where we caught fish. Thanks Jeff"
533900,Larry S,2003-07-28 19:18:00,666,"Thanks Jeff,will definatly find out from Melinda your hot spots. Did you use any leeches,or only minnows and crawlers? And also how deep were the fish? Will report how we did upon returning Thanks Again for all your help Jeff Larry S"
533912,Guest,2003-07-29 07:24:00,0,"Larry Our primary bait was minnows and half night crawlers. The spinners we use were chartruce or orange. Jigs were chartruce, orange, and blue(sunny days). I also had to use stinger hooks with the jigs they were biting light for us. Thanks Jeff"
534301,Guest,2003-08-11 20:04:00,0,"####o Larry Was wondering how the fishing was for you on the Gullrock. We were up the week of 7/19 and did extremely well for numbers and size, one of my best years ever. Jeff"
534309,Larry S,2003-08-12 07:13:00,666,"Hi Jeff, Just got back last night from Gullrock.Fishing for everyone at Five Lakes was slow most of the week. We did alright for the first time on Gullrock. Caught our fish on the Boot,Burnt Island,At gullrock point,the clay banks, and at the first island from camp. Jigging and trolling spinners with minnows and half a crawler. We did beston Thursday and Friday,caught mostly 15 to 18 inch wallies,with a half dozen from 20 to 25 inches.The 30 hp motors are nice and the camp is fine. Melinda and Bud are excellent hosts.Would have probibly done a lot better,but my friends son was acting up,and my friend is only a once a year fisherman who has a limited amount of patience Thanks again for your help Jeff Larry S"
534387,Renn,2003-08-14 06:48:00,87,"Jeff, I just got back Saturday from possibly the fishing week we have ever had on Gullrock in 26 years of going!! My wife, my 6 year old son, 4 year old daughter, and I caught and released 37 walleyes over 20 inches. We estimated that our party which consisted of my brother and mom and dad as well caught and released close to 80 walleyes over 20 inches. Our big fish were 27 1/2"", 27"", 25 1/2"", 24 1/2"" and 5 - 24"". We used up 12 dozen minnows, 1 lb. of jumbo leeches and 10 dozen crawlers for the week. It was unbelieveable. In addition to the fishing I had the opportunity to go a mile underground on a tour of the Gold Corp. gold mine in Balmertown. I didn't want to come back!!! :-) Have a great rest of the summer!!
