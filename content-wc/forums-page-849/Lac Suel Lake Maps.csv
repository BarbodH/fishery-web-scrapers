534170,Guest,2003-08-05 16:24:00,0,Go to this website http://www.awcoldstream.com/dmaps/ and check out their selection. Make sure you order the appropriate map for the area you will be fishing (there are 4 maps for Lac Seul). I ordered all 4 maps of Lac Seul about 3 weeks ago over the phone. The maps arrived 4 days after I ordered them to my home in Iowa.
