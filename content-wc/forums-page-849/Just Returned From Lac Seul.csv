Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."

Leeches just didn't produce that well this year. We also caught alot of smalleys for the first time. The Northerns were hard to come by due to low water but we did manage to hook into a 10.4 pounder in 30 feet of water while jigging for Walleyes. All in all it was still a good year of fishing. Already counting down the days til next year"

534377,tly,2003-08-13 20:33:00,1900,Don't know where you were but wasn't it great!!!!!!!! We found if it wasn't a minnow a little cleo killed them. I about bought Fleet Fard out of Power bairs but didn'd get maybe 10 small fish on them. At Eexpanse lake I emptied my tackle box of old stuff. Even passed stuff to other boat just to get rid of it. Probably got 100+ fish and here was the largest northerns also We feel after 20 + years thsi was our best trip. We are also older TLY
