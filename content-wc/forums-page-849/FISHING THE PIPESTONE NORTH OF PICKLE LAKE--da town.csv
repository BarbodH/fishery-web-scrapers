Also anyone know of Paul HOWARTH who works for the MNR out of Pickle Lake I met him a year ago last spring he was telling me about the big spec he caught and gave me his e-mail addy but was never able to contact him incorrect address. len at clare, michigan almost 1200 miles one way to this fishery and worth it every mile."
