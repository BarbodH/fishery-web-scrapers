534317,Guest,2003-08-12 11:07:00,0,"Hey guys...Whitetip, i was there when you were there. Group caught a ton of walleyes, some nice jacks, and I managed to boat two muskies, a 45"" and 47"". 47"" came on the last day with about four hours of fishing left! First time up to Chamberlain Narrows and absolutely loved it! the fishing was outstanding! If i got tired from throwing all day i would fish for walleyes, catch a few, then start flogging again!!! It's what Canada is all about, time with my dad and uncles, and catching a ton of fish!! The only thing I didn't like was seeing a bunch of houseboats...way too many for my taste."
534417,mrsserk,2003-08-15 22:56:00,4,"Just got back myself, wish I read you post before leaving. Was left 10 miles from deception bay for over 3 hours with a minor mechanical problem and no one came back for us and it was our first trip. Fishing was good, accomodations great, but overall attitude of camp operators was bad, felt like I was having to beg for everything that I expected to be provided. advertised internet access means 7:00am to 8:00am. Store hours of 4:00pm to 7:00pm means only if I feel like it. Most importent item is bring your own gas in 6 gallon containers because you will not enjoy the $8 a gallon charge."

533550,Guest,2003-07-16 19:14:00,0,question about lac seul outposts. are they pulling the bosts up on the beach or using docks. any problems taking crawlers of food across at int'l falls.
533559,whitetip1,2003-07-17 07:08:00,53,"Pulp, You will most likely pull your boat up on shore. They have a nice sandy beach that drops off fairly well so the boat will be fine. I tried to stay on the north side of the main dock as close to the dock as possible. Seemed to be deeper on that end. Bring a long ext. cord for charging as the outlets can be 50-75ft away depending on where you end up docking the boat. Whitetip1"
533713,Guest,2003-07-22 18:36:00,0,"whitetip, what's the name of the motel in sioux narrows. i need to book a room for the night before we go to the camp. thanks"
533726,eyewitness,2003-07-22 22:28:00,680,It's the Lamplighter Motel. Say hi to the pretty auburn haired girl behind the counter for me...:-)
534266,Guest,2003-08-10 13:30:00,0,"well, we had our week at lac seul outpost in chamberlain narrows. had great fishing for walleyes and pike. saw one muskie but no takers. weather was great. had no problems finding places to fish. just looked for the boats and put an icon on the gps. caught at least 100 or more per day. the camp was great as well. everybody was helpful and friendly. my only suggestiion to anyone going there is to get a good map of the area before you go. the camp maps are not of navigable quality. they don't show any detail. their are a lot of reefs just under the surface and i've got the bent prop to prove it. the kids had a good time as did my wife who isn't a reel fisherman. she went because i had been on a golfing trip with her earlier. she'd go back now. pf"
534279,Guest,2003-08-11 08:01:00,0,"Pulp, Were you north or south of camp? Off of reef's or points and islands?"
534286,Guest,2003-08-11 15:38:00,0,"We just returned from camp Aug. 8. It had been 10 years since I was there last and I can't say enough good things about the place. The store was a nice addition and the staff was very nice. I took my sons with me (9 &12) and they'll never forget it. In addition to the usual great walleye on jig, we caught several big walleye on white spinners in shallows while fishing for northerns! I read one of these messages griping about the guide being late to deception. The morning we went in, the fog was very thick. Also, the guide has to wait for the last and slowest boat coming out of camp. If you are in such a big hurry, maybe you shouldn't be on vacation to start with. I really didn't think that was a fair assesment of the place to give someone. ON the contrary, we got anything we asked for from the staff. We look forward to going back."
534293,Guest,2003-08-11 17:58:00,0,"jabs., looking at my map it appears we were fishing south of the narrows. we went out through bear narrows and then into the bigger water.we found fish on the reefs which are all over, off the points of islands, and in bays with 20 to 28 ft water. it was all on minnows and jigs. my son used a power bait twister tail with a minnow and consistantly caught much bigger fish than i did with just a minnow. we caught alot of walleyes in the 17 to 22 inch range. only a couple over 24. the biggest fish of the week was 31 which came off the dock at camp. hope this helps. pf"
532447,fishnut,2003-06-17 13:45:00,46,"Our group of ten just returned from Lac Seul, Chamberlain narrows, Objibway Outfitters. Like always great fishing. Hundreds of Walleyes, nothing big, Maybe 10-12 over the slot with our largest being 25 (Released). Largest Pike 41.(Released) Water temp varied from low 60 to almost 70 after two hot days. Most Eyes in 8-14ft. Three Sisters, Birch Narrows, Wapesi and just about anywhere near rocky points. Of course you probably could have caught as many right off the dock. Grandson would typically catch 20-30 in an evening. Great place, right in the mist of great fishing. Ken and Brenda run a nice setup there and now with the store right at camp makes it easy to pick up most items. Check out the Website http://www.lacseuloutposts.com/ Fishnut <'(((((<"
532539,whitetip1,2003-06-18 20:54:00,53,"Fishnut, Sounds like a great trip! I'm heading there for the first time on the 28th. Did you bring your own boat? How was the trip in? I am bringing my own boat and following the lodge boat in. Kinda curious with the water levels being reported to be 5' or more below ""normal"" what that experience was like. Any tips or comments would be welcome. Whitetip1"
532569,fishnut,2003-06-19 15:48:00,46,"Yes we had four boats of our own. No problems following the launch in. The only difference this year is you do not go through the ""Rags"" but go farther down the river around ""Devils Elbow"" before turning north. A lot more reefs showing this year, some are marked some not. Post your results. Fishnut"
532607,whitetip1,2003-06-20 11:47:00,53,Will do. Whitetip1
532610,Guest,2003-06-20 13:45:00,0,"Do not expect them to be on time to lead you in from Deception Bay and unless you piloting a big rig, do not expect them to wait for you on the way out. Have all the maps of the area and have your GPS for reference. :7"
533397,Guest,2003-07-10 14:15:00,0,"glad to hear the fishing at chamberlain narrows is good. i'm taking my wife and 20 year old daughter there for a week starting august 2. they are already talking about being bored. my daughter is more of a muskie girl having been to lotw a couple times with pretty good success. i've been trying to get maps and gps numbers, but everybody tells me they have them at the camp. i'm a little skeptical about the quality of camp maps. i've got a new lund 20 alaskan with a new 70 suzuki that i would like to keep off the rocks if possible. this is our first trip there. i'd be grateful for any map, gps # info and any tips on where to fish. i hear the walleye are about everywhere. true? thanks for any replies."
533398,whitetip1,2003-07-10 15:22:00,53,"Pulp, They have 2 types of map at the camp. One is a xerox copy if you will, and the other is a commercially available map that you can purchase before hand or by at camp. The copied map is not really helpful so I would suggest buying it from Brenda when you get there or if you can get one before hand to study a bit. I have only been there once (a couple of weeks ago) so my experience is limited. My observations are that muskie in that area are big, but not abundant. There are little to no weeds available so concentrate on rocky points and islands were walleyes and perch are present. The walleye fishing is second to none with many fish in the 15-21"" range. There are big ones there I have no doubt, we just didn't catch any. we concentrated on wind and islands/points and found the fish just about everywhere. Heck, you can catch your dinner off the end of the dock if you wanted with no problem!! For walleye we used plastics only. Twister tails on jigs and power worms behing spinner rigs with bottom bouncers. Muskie, for us, went after topwater. Two fish on jackpots and one on a Awacker. I was also nervous about rocks and such. The trip in and out you follow a guide boat, no problems there. Once you get to camp, they will point out some hazard areas to watch out for. I would suggest taking it slow until you feel comfortable navigating around. We did not have any problems but were extremely cautious the first day or so. After that I was very comfortable and had no problems opening her up. Bring a long ext cord for battery charging as with the low water it is a long way to the power source. You also have to travel thru sand to get your rig. I just got mine vaccumed out. Hope this helps. Have fun and give us a report when you get back. Whitetip1"
533407,Guest,2003-07-11 06:25:00,0,"whitecap1, thanks for the info. when i went to lotw we would typically run around the area going 20-30 miles a day just exploring on the map. can you do that at chamberlain narrows or are you on a big lake of water. also, i sold my trolling motor with my old boat. need a new one. can i get by with a stern unit or is the bow mount necessary or better. pf"
533408,whitetip1,2003-07-11 07:21:00,53,"Pulp, Plenty of room up there to explore. You can go north into Wapesi Bay or up to the pine island area and farther. To the south, there is a lot of lake to checkout. Lots of islands and such. Sounds like you can read a map and have some experience. Should be no problem for you. Obviously be prepared to spend $$ on gas. The camp sells it for around 6-7 bucks a gallon (US). Remember you have a 40 mile ride back at the end of the trip. I think you can get by without the bow mount. The bow mount in my opinion offers much better boat control in a wind and lends itself better to moving and casting. But a transom mount is better that nothing. Take care, Whitetip1"
533411,Guest,2003-07-11 09:14:00,0,"whitetip1, thanks again. i'll post our results when i get back to the states. pf"
