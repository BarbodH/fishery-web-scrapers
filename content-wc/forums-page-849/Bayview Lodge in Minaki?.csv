534237,IaCraig,2003-08-08 11:42:00,434,"I've never done the American Plan or stayed at Bayview, so I can not help you much there. I would advise you to do some price comparisons though, because prices around Minaki used to vary quite a bit. I'll be curious what responses you get from people who have stayed at BayView. As far as fishing goes, if you go back 1 or 2 pages on the Canada Forum you will see my fishing report from the Minaki area from last week. As a rule, most years I have had very good fishing around Minaki, however fish can turn off just as quickly there as anywhere else if mother nature throws a weather change at you. I have noticed the last 3 years that Minaki is becoming known for trophy muskie fishing as much as wallleyes. Have fun IaCraig"

I fished this system for 11 years in a row and always did better than the year before. I stayed at Bayview for 10 of those 11 years. The cabins are nice with improvements done every year. The food I can't comment on, since we always did the housekeeping plan. We always took our own boat but it always looked like Bryan had good boats and new motors. We never heard any complaints from other customers about the equipment or the food. The only complaints we ever heard was from rookie fisherman that couldn't catch fish ! Prices were always fair and it is quieter than staying in town. Hope this helps."
