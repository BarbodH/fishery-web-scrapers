Most of us will bring our own boats in the 18'-20' range, and we have been there before, so we know the drill. However, one of our party wants to rent a boat. He wants something bigger and with more capacity than the standard 16' camp boat with the 25 hp. He would like to get an 18' Alaskan or similar boat. Anyone know any place up there which would rent such a boat for a week? If it was in Morson, that would be perfect, but International Falls or Fort Francis would be fine, too, or even Duluth/Superior, because we will drive through each of those places. DS"

In particular, at Merkel's Camp, he has his boat available and it is a 17.5' w/70 hp Evinrude. I'd check w/your camp first."
