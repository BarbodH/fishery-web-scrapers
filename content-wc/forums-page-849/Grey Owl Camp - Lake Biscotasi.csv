516922,Guest,2002-02-03 15:05:00,0,Anyone have any information on Grey Owl camp on Lake Biscotasi. Thinking of booking a trip. I am from North Central PA and looking for a new place to go that is not too far.
516923,Guest,2002-02-04 06:19:00,0,"Save your time and money. Our group went last year. Worst fishing we have ever had. Plus a slot limit that you had to throw back basically every fish you catch. The slot was something like 15"" - 20"" had to go back, and of course, thats all we caught. Needless to say, we ended up eating some of these anyway. They didn't bother to mention this slot before we drove 14 hours. After we paid and was ready to leave the dock, they threw in this ""Oh, by the way... there's a slot limit in place...""They seemed like nice people but the fishing stunk."

The 1st time there we had fairly good luck for the week( 98) We haven!t been back since. Seems the slot size is only enforced for the non-resient fishermen! Met quite a few locals who had ONLY slot size fish in possession!! The last few years we have been going to Quebec and after the good fishing there, don!t know if we will fish Ontario again. Good Luck!"
516925,Guest,2002-02-05 08:57:00,0,thirds. i second and third what these two said. havent been to lake bis but my research found out the same thing. ontario waited way too long to slot and they are paying the price as folks look elsewhere. got a real nice driveable place in que but its a ways. driving time is worth the investment believe me. we had our greatest trip ever last year!
516926,Guest,2002-02-05 17:44:00,0,Walleyechieftain: I too have quit going to Ontario the last few years. I am looking for something better in Quebec. We are strictly Catch & Release walleye fishermen and have not brought back any fish in coolers on the way home for many years hoping to sustain what fisheries were left but its probably to late. Would you mind sharing with me the place you go in Quebec? A long ride is no problem for me anymore. Thanks. WF

534431,MK,2003-08-17 09:20:00,322,"When in Canada, do as the Canadians do. Like all of the locals we encountered, we kept a few to eat. I guess that makes me and most of the locals up there poachers. Oh well. Come to think of it, I distinctly remember drinking a beer or two in the boat and exceeding the speed limit on the way there. Where can I turn myself in? As far as Bisco being better off without me and my buddies, I hope it is. It's by far the most fished out lake I've seen and have no intentions of returning. So in a couple of years, it should be fine since our group won't be there cleaning it out. Make your reservations early. Let's see now, where did I put that t-shirt with the big red ""P"" on it? Keep digging around in the archives, you might find some other things that offend you. Or, you could just get a life."
534437,Chimo,2003-08-17 11:25:00,4,"Actually was doing a search on Bisco and found your admission. NIce come back with the ""Get a Life"" comment. The comment of the simple man. Or confessed poacher in your case. Does the Indiana DNR know about you? When in Rome, do as the Romans? No wonder fisheries become strained. Pathetic."
