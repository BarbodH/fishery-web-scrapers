We will not be pulling any rigs and will be 3 vehicles. Any problem with the roads that we are using? Thanks."

534447,Guest,2003-08-18 07:33:00,0,We took the same route up to Sioux Lookout. The only issue I saw (other than a few bumps in the road) were moose. Keep your eyes peeled for them - you may be traveling in two vehicles if you nail one of those suckers. Have a good trip.
