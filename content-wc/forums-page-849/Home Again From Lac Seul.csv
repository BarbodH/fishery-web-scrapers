We have spent the last 20+ years going there (Scaler Lake)(with a 3 yr gap to Ouahe) There has been a major change year by year. We started camping then camped with 'theatre' tickets, camped at outpostcampsites then we had to go to current stuff where you went to flyin or whatever. There is a logical expanation and I do not argue with the rationale. In summary, we are getting older, want more 'amenities' and convenience, and by way we want fish!! Our current solution was to go to xxxxxxx which fulfilled our needs One coment tho- Ken Robins (Ojibiway Outfiltters) was always there from our very first day in September 1983. I have used other 'outfitters' in the area but only once been disappointed. Try renting a houseboat in Hudson. What was really cool (but not good) was the 'copters sensing fire hotspots and dumping water or crews to fix it. Now, through with BS stuff, we caught most on minnows, power bait dit very very badly. That's sad because my budget said fleet farm power baits saved us. By the wat, we bought 53 doz minnows for 4 of us. Bottom line ofd this is DO NOT DISCOUT CANADA"
