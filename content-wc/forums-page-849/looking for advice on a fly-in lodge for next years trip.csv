533848,Guest,2003-07-27 06:32:00,0,have you considered a fly in outpost.if you enjoy the solitude-these camps offer up to 20 miles of lake system with no one else there.no red carpet service but very comfy camps and the fishing is anywhere from good to unbelieveable.myself and longtime partner have 2 weeks booked for next june and could use some fishermen to fill the camp.if of interest contact [email protected]
533869,phishfearme,2003-07-28 05:43:00,1242,try contacting lac seul/amik lodge outfitters. their shearstone lake and loree lake outposts provide excellent large pike and tons of walleye. you can do a search on this site to see more posts. - phish

533980,lobo1,2003-07-30 18:04:00,734,I had a recommendation listed here but then re-read your post and it said LODGE - I had listed a fly-in outpost cabin - so I deleted it. lobo
