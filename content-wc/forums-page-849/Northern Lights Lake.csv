I have been on this trip just once and do not care if I ever go back. Cabins = primative, noise (drunk campers) = high and not the fault of the lodge but water way down and had to push boats out 100+ ft before can drop motoer and go. Did I mention drunks? The trailer residents have alot of fun 24x7 it seems. But ignoring that fishing is OK. Smallies break the monotony between walleyes Be objective, you will like it. TLY"
