534278,Guest,2003-08-11 07:41:00,0,"Would you be willing to share some of your GPS coordinates? I've fished Little Sand and the South end of Big Sand for a couple of years, but haven't ventured out into the big lake as of yet. I'm looking for some new places to fish this year in that area, so any information you could give me would be greatly appreciated. Any good smallmouth areas?"
534284,Guest,2003-08-11 10:32:00,0,Post your email and someone could send you the cord! lol
534308,Guest,2003-08-12 06:22:00,0,"If anyone has GPS coordinates for areas of Big Sand, please drop me a note at [email protected] Thanks"
534340,Reels,2003-08-12 20:51:00,2876,"You wont need #'s. Once you get up to Big sand, you will see a boat on every common spot. Here are a few for refference. In Back of Burnt, there is a reef that does well. Green Island, just N NE there are two reefs marked on the map. Not hard to find, and you will see boats there. Rock Pile on North end. Long reef in front of it that is maybe 1 mile long. Beach- North shore, east side. Nice sany area that does well if wind has been banging in the south. There are many more, but this should keep you busy for a while. Tight Lines. <{{}}><"
534386,Guest,2003-08-14 06:48:00,0,"The Minaki Lodge web site has been down for a few days. What's up. Rumours in Kenora is that the facility is UP FOR SALE again. $8,000,000. I have always said that if that Hotel Chain that owned and tried to operate the place could not get it to pay off, then no one could. Looks like I might have been right."
534420,IaCraig,2003-08-16 10:08:00,434,"Iowa eye guy, Sorry being a jerk, but I do not give GPS coordinates to people I don't know.(especially non registered users on web sites) Besides, Reels is correct that you do not need GPS coordinates for Big Sand because there will be boats on most the common humps. And most the humps I fish are common ones. Reels has named some good areas, and the names are on the free maps the resorts hand out. However I'd buy a detailed map(the marina or Jacks Bait should have them), and find the humps myself some quiet afternoon instead of just moving in on people already fishing them. (I don't like to crowd people, and exploring is kind of fun). Some of the humps are large and there is room for many boats, other humps are pretty small and 2 boats are almost a crowd. Also the detailed maps are good for going places not on the resort maps, like up river to cast for pike. A couple more ideas, during summer small mouths (and perch) can be found jigging humps 17' or shallower, and walleyes 20' and deeper. If you are going mid summer, try trolling #9 deep running shad raps out in Big Sand over deep water in the evenings, early mornings or anytime it is windy and cloudy. I named Rapala Shad raps because most stores carry them, they are effective and usually they stay in tune. I also use Mann's stretch 15+ and 20+, reef runners, thundersticks, hot'n tots and God knows what else. If you are going in Spring try the shallower lakes like Gun or Little Sand because they warm sooner. Good Luck IaCraig"
534432,Reels,2003-08-17 09:42:00,2876,"I agree with IA Craig. Take your time to study the map. You will have a lot more fun not following the crowd. There are alot of hidden humps, reefs, eddies, etc. It is a huge body of water with a lot of fish. Naybe fish a common spot to learn what the pattern is, then take that pattern to spots off the beaten path. Good fishin. <{{}}><"
534434,Guest,2003-08-17 10:40:00,0,"IaCraig Thank you for your reply. I'm new at the GPS game, and I was just looking for some quick and easy points to look at. I have already ordered the detailed map from the marina, and I plan to look that over and get some ideas as to where to go before I get there. I should be able to get coordiates from the map. I appreciate your reluctance on sharing coordinates, and also your comments on exploring new areas after finding the pattern on spots that I know. I've not ventured into Big Sand very far yet, but I plan to do so this year, and check out some of the spots posted by you and Reels. Hopefully, Labor Day week will be productive, and I can learn more about the lake. Thanks again, Iowa eye guy"
534436,Guest,2003-08-17 10:53:00,0,"Reels: Thanks for your suggestions on where to go on Big Sand. I've found the two areas North of Green, and when you say the back of Burnt, I'm assuming that you are talking about the hump North of Burnt. I know there is a rock hump there, but I've always assumed that it is pretty small as the water seems to drop off pretty quickly to 100' around it. I've not been to the North end yet, but have seen those areas marked on the resort map. I am getting the detailed map, so that should also be helpful in finding them. Thanks again, I'll be exploring . . . . Iowa eye guy"
534439,Reels,2003-08-17 17:31:00,2876,"Iowa Guy, Yes, the one North of Burnt is were I was talking about. It seems small, but it is decieving. It is actually good size. Easy to fall off the edge, but if you mark the two sides east to west with a bouy, and stay north and south of them, you'll learn it pretty quick. When are you going? Shoot me an e-mail and I'll give you a few more spots to try. I might get to sneak up there Friday! Keeping my fingers crossed.[email protected] <{{}}><"
533926,Reels,2003-07-29 16:25:00,2876,"Just talked to a friend who just got back. Troll is on at Big Sand in the evening. 40 fish nights were normal with alot of 25"" and 26"" fish. Average 22"". Pearl Shad Rap was the hottest color, but they didnt seem that picky. Leadcore out produced boards. 5 Colors back with a 10' Mono leader. #7's or #9's, didn't seem to matter much. Tried the troll in the AM, started at 3am and fish bit till 8ish. Fish started as soon as the line hit the water. But died after the sun got high in the sky. Fish moved to the reefs and jigs worked 18-25'. Northern and Muskies were at islands with weeds and rocks, but a bit slow. Just the occasional smallie off the reefs. Didn't fish for them. Thanks to Steve Wanders for the report. <{{}}><"
534098,IaCraig,2003-08-03 23:06:00,434,"Well Reels, we just got back last night and I guess the cool weather seems to have slowed things down a little, but we did OK. I talked to some other boats leaving mid week, and they said too that up till 7/25 the fishing was hot. Admittedly with a 78 year old father and a 9 year old son in tow we did not start trolling Big Sand at 3:00 A.M. , however we did our share of trolling in the evenings. Basing my guess upon the chatter on the radio and other fishermen in camp I'd say most eveninings boats were picking up closer to 4 fish than 40 trolling Big Sand, with the possible exception of Friday 8/1. We did not have any bad days but we had to work for the fish we caught and the average fish was a bit larger than in the past. Luckily we seemed to be doing better than a lot of boats at both trolling and bottom bouncing, but it was a bit slower than most trips to Minaki we've had. This was my son's first trip to Canada and I am pleased to report that he will be smiling for a long time. He caught quite a few walleyes between 19 and 23 inches, 2 northerns over 27 inches and had a pretty large muskie inhale his hot'n tot and give him a great fight until the fish saw the net and cut the line above the 9 inch wire leader on that last hard run. My son learned the values of catch and release and actually smiled as he tossed back some the biggest walleyes he'd ever seen, much less caught. He saw loons, watched gulls inhale perch, saw many eagles, ate walleye every day for lunch and got to spend the whole week with Dad and Grandpa. He saw dad catch a 28 inch walleye and Grandpa catch two 24 inchers back to back. He swam, played on the north beach and barely touched that stupid Game Boy. No, the fishing wasn't the best ever, but the trip was fantastic. Thanks Ontario :7 IaCraig"
534101,Guest,2003-08-04 07:13:00,0,Just got back as well........pretty much the same results as Craig.....some big walleye caught on cranks. Glad to hear about other people catching and releasing the walleye up there. Craig........I think I passed you as I was leaving Minaki on Saturday morning.....do you have a Johnson motor?
534102,Guest,2003-08-04 07:51:00,0,"Hi Guys: When you did the bottom bouncing, what area of the flowage did the biggest fish come from. Any information would be helpful. Checking in on Aug. 10th for a week of good fishing. Thanks"
534119,IaCraig,2003-08-04 13:26:00,434,"Aaron_In, no I have a Maroon 19' Crestliner Phantom with a 150 E-rude Ficht and a 8 hp Yamaha kicker. The last 2 trips we stayed at the North Star Lodge (the petro stop by the RR bridge). How about yourself and where did you stay? Deisel, (or is it diesel?) - Summer time I almost exclusively fish Big Sand, and while that is a very generic answer it is about the best I can narrow it down because I did not catch any number of large fish on any single hump. I have about 20 humps & points marked on my GPS in Big Sand and I start by hitting the windy ones first until I mark fish then I bottom bounce for a while to see if they are active. If it is too windy for bottom bouncing it is probably cloudy too so trolling 15 - 25 foot deep cranks even mid afternoon should work. I think Aug 10th is the week before the Gary Roach Pro_Am Tourney Duane puts on, so expect to see lots of fancy rigs pre-fishing very seriously. Have fun IaCraig"
534126,iamwalleye1,2003-08-04 17:45:00,1589,The tournament ia the 15th and 16th. Lets hope for better weather on day two this year! You will see alot of boat on the spots up in big sand. http://www.paradisecoveminaki.com/garyroach.htm
534133,Guest,2003-08-04 20:13:00,0,"Craig.....my dad, brother and I own a couple of cabins on Harbour Island. That wasn't you I saw but I'm sure I saw you up on Big Sand one day. I get up there a couple of times a summer. Not a big Walley fisherman....mostly bass and pike...maybe a few small walleye for dinner one or two nights. I do like to trolling cranks for those big walleye on Big Sand though."
534142,IaCraig,2003-08-05 03:48:00,434,"Aaron - I am assuming you mean those A frames, or are there other cabins on Harbour Island too? I like the location of those A frames, were they a resort at one time? It would be nice to be that close to big sand, but I also like openning up the throttle for that 10 - 12 mile run back and forth to Minaki too. (kind of eats up the gas after a while but it is fun and scenic ride). If towards the end of the week you saw a boat with a maroon top up it was probably me. I felt like a nerd with it up, but what the heck at least we were dry nerds. :-) I got caught in the rain so often that I put up the maroon top and left it up. I don't use the top very often, but last week it sure came in handy. IaCraig"
534147,Guest,2003-08-05 06:46:00,0,Craig..........although there are several other cabins on Harbor Island we do own the two red A-frames with the red boat house at the South end of the bay. That use to be a German owned fishing camp. It's a great location for getting just about anywhere up there. What an unusual week of weather up there that week.....that front just kept sitting on top of us.
534260,iamwalleye1,2003-08-09 14:25:00,1589,ttt!
