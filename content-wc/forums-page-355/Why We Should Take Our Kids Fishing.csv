2107602,pjshorthorn,2013-09-16 19:47:00,5654,Davis:Thanks for sharing such special memories. I've always wondered where some of us would have ended up if we hadn't been exposed to such great experiences as a child with friends and family.PJ
2103577,pjshorthorn,2013-09-15 07:14:00,5654,"Howdy Folks:Here is one great reason we should take our kids, grandkids, nephews or nieces on a Canadian fishing trip.My son landed this 41"" northern on his ultralight fishing 8 lb test - no wire leader. This was his 3rd trip at age 13.We had experienced a couple of drag screaming runs one morning while reeling in some small wally dinks, but never saw what was causing the runs. My son was convinced there was a sea monster lurking around,but we never stayed hooked up long enough to find out. We decided to head in for lunch with a promise that I would bring him right back to the same spot and that he wouldn't say anything to anyone!!!! Came back out, anchored up and started picking up a few dinks again. As my son reeled in a small wally, I saw a northern come out from under some timber and BOOM......game on.All Dad could do was clear the decks, pull the anchor and allow the young lad to play ring around the rosie in the boat while the fish pulled us in every direction. I don't know who was more excited when he finally landed it with a 15"" walleye swallowed headfirst with just the tip of the tail hanging out. Memories of a liftime for a father and son. Priceless.Tight Lines,PJ"
2103993,nitrodude,2013-09-15 09:46:00,60,"My 13 YO caught his first citation Pike during this year's trip, too. Also on 8 lb. test using a light action buggy whip rod for walleye fishing. A 3/8 oz. jig head/curly tail was the only leader he had and anchored in the current above the falls, the fish ran him to death for over ten minutes, yet he managed to keep him hooked and got him boat side where all I did was slide the Boga Grip over the jaw and hand him his prize. (It bottomed out the Boga and stretched side to side of the boat!) This was his third trip up with ""the guys"" and entrenched the already ""hooked for life"" feeling he got with his first citation catch, a 21 5/8"" 6.25 lb. smallmouth, his very first year up. We are very lucky men to share these experiences with our sons and keep the legacy living on!"
2104073,pjshorthorn,2013-09-15 10:05:00,5654,Nice catch. Cool looking boat too!!! We need these young folks to get the fever and want to take us fishing one day. One of my proudest accomplishments was being able to have three generations in our boat for a few years in a row and pay my Dad's way every time he made the trip with his son and grandson.PJ
2104641,MT Walleye,2013-09-15 15:38:00,271,Great stories guys!! Thanks for sharing. I have two boys 6 and 1.5 years old. I hope to make many memories like this with them.
2105025,NY Walleye,2013-09-15 18:35:00,78,"Took my son for his first Canada trip. He had a trip of a lifetime. We landed hundreds of walleye, and he is asking everyday when he can go back. Pictures coming soon."
2105922,bcmss396,2013-09-16 08:23:00,296,"I've been dragging my kids to Canada for 7 years now and the memories are priceless. This year my son led the field with his 27"" plus Walleye. Great to get a nice pic and Watch him release the big girl himself.His sister isn't far behind with a nice 22"" eye that she released.It's great having kids that enjoy some of the passions of their parents. Can't wait for 2014!!!Blair"
2105954,davis,2013-09-16 08:52:00,18,"Everyone should take their kids to Canada. My folks did 60 some years ago. We took our kids and now share time with our daughter, her husband, and three of our grandchildren on an annual Canada trip. My cousin and I have often talked of our delight that our parents took us on the Canada fishing trips 60 some years ago. He has been going to Wabaskang for the duration and still continues to love it there. He thinks the Canada trip was his folks greatest gift to him as child. My parents broke with Wabaskang at some point (when someone built a cabin on our camping island), but took an adventure up 599 when it was little more than a logging road and stopped at the old Ennis Grocery and Fitchie Lake was suggested. We loved it there for a few years and after fishing other lakes on 599, now share Vista Lake with our family. The trips to Canada as a child are my favorite memories. As an adult, my Dad celebrated his 80th birthday at Hamilton Lake on 599. My Mother made potato salad, fried fresh walleye, set the camping table with a cloth, an aunt and uncle also camping there brought a bottle of wine and by the campfire we had a wonderful celebration. After dinner, a group of brothers from Wisconsin (I think) came walking to our camp fire with a Little Debbie with a candle and sang Dad happy birthday. Priceless. It started for me at about age three."

2107442,pjshorthorn,2013-09-16 19:27:00,5654,"You started him early and it sounds like he was up to catching more fish than most folks catch in their lifetime!!!!He is a lifer so keep saving enough each year to bring him along for quite some time!!!!Congrats,PJ"
2107498,pjshorthorn,2013-09-16 19:32:00,5654,"I love how the kids always outfish us older fellas. Is it newbie luck or devine intervention to make some ""hopeful guides"" smile more than they knew was possible ?Thanks for sharing,PJ"
