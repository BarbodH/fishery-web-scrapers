It states that this is 15 miles from Hwy 17. I'm wondering if this road is stable plus, is the fishing there something I should investigate. Thanks for any info."

She stated that you can't put it at her camp, but there is a public put in on the northern part of the lake. She wasn't sure of the condition of the road up there. Sounds like this lake is out for me. However, I do notice that Basket Lake connects to Flatrock on the eastern side. I currently fish Flatrock and may make an attempt to get in there, although who knows if the rocks will make that possible."
