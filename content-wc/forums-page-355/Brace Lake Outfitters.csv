2116538,Jack77,2013-09-20 16:15:00,168,I have been with Brace lake outfitters and we are signed up again for 2014. We have been with many different outfitters at many different lakes and Kyle and Terri run the best operation that we have ever been with. So much so that we are no longer looking for outfitters. The best fishing with the best people that we have ever experienced. Ask them about the fishing from the float plane dock. We have been to 6 different outfitters at 6 different lakes and this is hands down the best experience that we have ever had. PM me for more information.
