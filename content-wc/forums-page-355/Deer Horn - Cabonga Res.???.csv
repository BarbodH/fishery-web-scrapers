We did better on size and #'s the those fishing the Cabonga. We find Barrier to be more consistent fishing but have caught are bigger fish in the Caboga, plus trailering downevery day was a pain. Only other group from the states was a pair of guy from WV."
2091210,jimash2,2013-09-08 17:58:00,16,"CABONGA FALL 2013 FISHING TRIPFriday: (Travel day; August 31,2013)My son Mike and I (Jim) arrived at DH (Deer Horn) around 4 PM. This is our second trip to DH this year. Frank placed us in cabin #18 and assigned us a boat with a 15 hp motor. We got our park permit for 5 days of fishing and some crawlers. There was a light rain but we got out boat ready and cooked a couple of steaks on a DH grill. So we ate steak, had clam chowder soup and ice cream with chocolate lemon cello for dessert.Saturday (Fishing Day #1):We initially went to Marigny Lake where we caught several walleyes. We ate our shore lunch in Marigny. We enjoy our shore lunches and it was our primary meal each of the 5 days. Shore lunch consists of walleye, potatoes, beans, a little fruit and a drink (wine, beer, soda or coffee). Shortly after lunch we fished for pike in the waters outside Marigny Lake. We kept 2 of the pike. Back to camp around 4 PM. At 6:30 we fished near camp in 3-Mile bay and caught another 4 walleyes. A very good day. The weather was cloudy and a bit of light rain.Sunday (Day #2):In the morning we went to the end of 7-Mile bay and fished for walleye in the lake near the Indian camp. We caught a few walleyes and had our shore lunch. The weather was very nice. We saw a bear swimming in the water. We also saw a bald eagle fly down from a tall tree pick up a fish and fly off (beautiful). We have photos of the bear but not the eagle. In the evening we went to 3-Mile bay and caught a couple walleyes. Also met some friends, which also fish in one of the same spots. Said good-bye, as they are leaving in the morning. Another good day. Monday (Day #3):Since we had plenty of walleyes, we went to Burns bay to fish pike. We had some pretty good pike fishing. Around 10:30 we went to Mike's bay. We only caught 2-3 small pike. Had our shore lunch and went back to Burns bay. Had better action. We kept 7 of the pike so we now have 9-pike in our possession. We had lots of broken lines with the fish getting caught in the weeds and logs. In fact, we lost all of our 5-3Â” Red Toronto Wobblers. This was a quite rainy day and there was rain in the evening. So, we did not fish in the evening. Good day of fishing.Tuesday (Day #4):My son Mike has never fished in Waskega bay so we decided to give it a try. We went to the end of Waskega channel and jigged for walleye. With no luck, we went through the narrows and fished Rynardson Lake. We didn't have any walleye success. We did catch a couple of small pike. We ate our shore lunch in Rynardson Lake. We had a bit of rain during lunch, no big problem. We then decided to go back to Burn's bay for pike. We had good pike action and kept 3-pike to fill out our 12-pike limit. In the evening we only caught one walleye in 3-Mile bay. Wednesday (Day #5):Over the years we have enjoyed fishing in Lake Minnie at the end of 7-Mile bay. In the last 2-3 years, Minnie has not been very productive for us. So on our last day we decided to give Minnie a try. We caught 6 nice walleyes. We fished with both jigs and Hot-N-tots. Most walleyes were caught on the Hot-N-tot. We also caught a few small pike. The temperature was a bit cooler than previous and we wore gloves for the first time on way to Minnie. In a little while the temperature was fine.In the evening we went back to 3-Mile bay for a short time and caught one walleye. This was the end of our fishing. We had a tasty spaghetti dinner by cook Mike before getting setup to leave early in the morning.OTHER INFORMATION:* Mike and I have been fishing DH since 2005. Mike is 54 and I am 77 years old. Mike lives near Fredrick Maryland and I live 30 miles South of Allentown Pennsylvania. * We normally fish walleye using either a jig/crawler (jig is modified to contain a trailer hook) or a worm harness. At times we also use a Hot-N-Tot; the Hot-N-Tot produced a couple of our best walleye in Lake Minnie. Most of our pike were caught casting with a 3-inch Red Toronto Wobbler. * The weather was on the rainy side for most of the 5 days. The wind and temperature were such that we were always comfortable on the lake. * During the last couple of days we provided 6 walleyes to a party of three. This allowed us to upgrade some of our take home walleyes.* We brought home 12-walleye (15 to 20 inch), 12-pike (2.5 to 6 lb.) and some perch.* We had a great time!Jim"
2092081,Guest,2013-09-09 07:00:00,0,"Jimash, thanks for the detailed trip report to Cabonga Reservoir. As you described your report I could relate to it all because over the years, our group has fished all those locations. Jigs and hot n tots have worked well for us as well as shallow runners where we have caught the greatest number of our fish. I assume the lake was at a good level due to your fishing Waskega. You need a good lake level to make that trip. We're meeting today to discuss a walleye trip we will be making in a couple of weeks to southern Ontario. I'm sure to bring up the possibility of returning to Deerhorn next year. Our group lives in the Collegeville PA area and it's a 12 plus hour drive for us."

2113858,emanonmac,2013-09-19 14:03:00,62,"Wasn't thinking of going to Deer Horn in 2014 for reasons I previously stated but as a thank you to my brother in law for helping replace the cedar siding on my house I decided to take him somewhere that I was familiar with. Tried using the contact form on their web site and after a week, no reply. I then tried their 800 number and could not understand the French but did hear an announcement in English ""Deer Horn Lodge"". Some more French and then silence and then another ring tone was heard which quickly came back with the tone of a phone not working. My last resort was to use the e-mail address they had on the site. It looked like it was the same one when Steve was running the camp as it was addressed to steve@.........Anyone have any other suggestions on contacting someone up there so I can make a reservation and arrange to give them my deposit?"
2114130,Guest,2013-09-19 16:14:00,0,"You may have caught them at camp closing time. I would keep trying the contact methods listed, even snail mail. There have to be loads of availability."
2116962,jimash2,2013-09-20 19:51:00,16,"I made our 2013 Spring reservation in late February for myself and son. I emailed our desired arrival date/time, fishing days, boat/motor requirements, cabin days and departure date/time. There was probably 2-3 email exchanges. Sebastian normally responded in 1 to 2 days (maybe even the same day). Once we had things squared away, I sent a deposit check. His last email is a computer printout of the reservation also showing the deposit. The telephone was not used by either of us and he did not send me a letter (non required). When we have a good idea of our 2014 Spring desires, I will go to the DH Web site and see if the Steve@... has changed."
2118018,emanonmac,2013-09-21 14:25:00,62,"I thought they might be closing down the camp but figured I'd give it a try. Thanks for the feedback, I'll wait a couple weeks more and see what happens."
2048514,joepa,2013-08-22 07:52:00,366,"Has anyone heard anything about Deer Horn Lodge on the Cabonga Res.? Is the lodge still operating? If so, is the water level real low again? Fishing?"
2050322,carpface,2013-08-22 16:45:00,11,my son and I fished cabonga the last week june caught pike and walleye everyday.the last two days were catch and release.we released over 80 nice walleyes.the camp owners and help were nice and very helpful .they have a great operation.
2050338,carpface,2013-08-22 16:48:00,11,"oh I forgot the water level was at the max, hid a lot of rocks"
2052674,Guest,2013-08-23 13:59:00,0,"Thanks for the update on Cabonga, Carpface. My group stopped fishing there after the fluctuating water levels ruined the spots we had fished for years. Was it your first trip? We might return next year if the stability of the reservoir is maintained. Our largest pike, best average size walleye, and decent lake trout came from the Cabonga in years past. I understand that Steve's nephew is doing a good job with the lodge. Hope we make the trip next year."
2053978,joepa,2013-08-24 08:15:00,366,"Logging in to the Deer Horn website, there are no updates anymore. It would be nice if they posted more recent things other than 2011. It doesn't seem like there is much interest in traveling 13 hours to Cabonga without some recent news on water levels, price increases, road condition, etc. Is anyone else having trouble trying to get the guys to go anymore?"
2054202,emanonmac,2013-08-24 10:34:00,62,"Did not make the trip to Deer Horn Lodge this year as I had too much work to do around the house this summer. Additionally, with the slot limit and the uncertainty of the water level with the constant work on the dams it might be some time before I go back. Before I would even consider it again they would have to bring their web site up to date with current water conditions and maybe some pictures? Last year there was 4 of us there in Cabin 1 and we settled our bill for a weeks stay the Friday before we left. It was really hot that day and after paying our bill I spotted some ice pops that were very inviting with the heat. I grabbed one and when I asked how much I really expected them to say ""on the house"" after giving them about $ 3,000. Didn't happen, was quoted a price of about $ 1 so I paid him and as I was leaving I told Hamel to learn to say ""On The House"". I really don't think he understood. I don't mind paying for something but I also wouldn't mind seeing some gratitude for our patronage over the last 10 years. Thinking about trying the Bay of Quinte next year around the beginning of November. Late spring and early summer I'll be looking for Stripers off the Jersey coast."
2054594,jimash2,2013-08-24 14:27:00,16,"My son Mike and I (Jim) will be in cabin #12. We will be fishing 5 days (Aug. 31 thru Sept. 4). This is our second trip this year. We were at Cabonga the last week of May. Both the walleye and pike fishing was pretty slow for us, but we had a nice time. The water level is currently 2.39 ft. below full; lots of water. I have been going to DH for the past 8 years. I also miss the updating of the Web site. It looks like it is now being worked on; it is being re-structured. Hopefully they will start posting pictures and fishing activity next year. If anyone is there while we are, stop in at cabin #12."
2060426,mickr,2013-08-26 18:22:00,74,I am curious where you got the information that the water is 2.39 feet below normal. Never fished cabonga but I haven't been to dozois just above it and haven't been back because of low water levels.
2060626,jimash2,2013-08-26 19:21:00,16,"Hi mickr ==> Use the following web site. Cabonga level was showing 360.15 meters. This is the level for the date/time about 10 lines above. Full level is 360.88 meters. If you click ""Water Levels and Flows you can see daily levels. I was wrong in my previous post ==> I should have said about 2.39 ft. below FULL (not normal).http://ottawariver.ca/reservoir-levels-discharges.php"
2061297,Guest,2013-08-27 06:20:00,0,"Jimash2, I hope you will give us a report after your trip. As I stated in a earlier post, our group gave up on Cabonga after the many drawdowns ruined many of our spots. Big pike were a frequent catch in past years but rare now with the bays being dry for long periods. All of the pike I would occasionally keep were full of large crawfish indicating that shallow bays full of that forage were a big draw. Good lake trout fishing was available if you could make the run without losing a lower unit. The bays that produced awesome walleye action were fishless after the large drawdowns. Cabonga is a fish factory if water level stability is maintained. Lets hope for ample rain, and frequent updates from Deerhorn."
