Don't want to turn this thread into a ""netting controversy"" but I presume the net does not distinguish between a whitefish and a walleye. How do the netters deal with that? (I've never seen a netting operation in process)"
2111226,v-bay gord,2013-09-18 11:59:00,3168,They try and target the whitefish by setting at an appropriate depth and location to avoid incidental walleye catches. Easier to do when the two species are using differing depths and locations....but there is overlap at some points in time. If they are licensed they likely need to avoid going over their incidental walleye catch or risk having to pull their nets out of the water.
2112074,mswope13,2013-09-18 19:13:00,73,"Has anyone caught an eel looking fish on LS? This year my brother pulled out a fish I swear was an eel, no scales (catfish skin look), but honest to god, it had eel similarities. It was around 20"". We were in Steamboat and have been fishing LS for many years. Never heard of a fish or species like this."
2117986,rather-be-fishin,2013-09-21 14:13:00,429,Was it an Eel Pout?
2117994,Yaba,2013-09-21 14:17:00,88,"They are called LING, head of a fish-body of a snake! We catch them quite abit in the winter, when you reach in the hole to pull them out, they somtimes wrap themselves around your arm. Good eating if you can stand the sight of them!"
2118010,Yaba,2013-09-21 14:22:00,88,"And yes, the Natives do Commercial Fish Lac Seul....both whitefish and walleye!"
2118306,mswope13,2013-09-21 17:21:00,73,"Thanks for the post guys, I didn't know what to think of this fish..."
2118882,Guest,2013-09-21 21:49:00,0,thats an expensive lesson. stainless prop? i alway used a piranha composite prop. the blades only cost 25 bucks each. check it out.
2064554,rather-be-fishin,2013-08-28 07:44:00,429,"I checked out Gawley's website and cabins look very nice! Air conditioning and television, you don't see that often in the cabins on Lac Seul! Make sense staying there for a months stay. We were at Fisherman's Cove July 27 to August 3 and saw many boats going to & from the public landing, so we may have crossed paths on the water. We are going back next year same time, Maybe see you on the water then too! Countdown is on 11 months to go. RBF"
2068850,btmbncr,2013-08-29 17:13:00,492,Rather-be-fishinWe were the blue Alumacraft tiller with the 2 dogs in it.Gawley's website doesn't do the place justice.There are only 3 cabins so it's not crowded feeling like some camps.Sitting in the air conditioned cabin sipping Kokanee after a day on Lac Seul is wonderful.Bill
2075457,South Dakota,2013-09-02 06:29:00,24,Btmbncr are you using a bow mount most of the time or are you a backtroller? How fast we're you trolling most of the time. Thx
2094122,btmbncr,2013-09-09 23:44:00,492,Most of the time the bow mount. .7 to 1.1 mph.
2094594,South Dakota,2013-09-10 10:01:00,24,Thanks!
2106978,worthsr,2013-09-16 15:56:00,52,"Bill, I've been to Lac Seul many times but have never seen any commercial white fish netting taking place. I've seen what I believe is an old commercial white fish camp, but it looks likes it was vacated 20 years ago. Now I normally fish Lac Seul the last full week of June. Perhaps that's the wrong time of year for catching whitefish. We have accidently caught a few white fish in 20+ years of fishing Lac Seul. I'm surprised to hear there is still enough white fish in Lac Seul to interest commercial fisherman. How does that work? Are they dragging a net between two boats? Do you catch a lot of white fish in that area? We spend almost all our time fishing east of there. Thanks, Scott"
2107674,btmbncr,2013-09-16 20:17:00,492,"They don't drag the net between two boats.The net just drifts,it has floats on the end.The real whitefish season,usually,is fall.You could ask the Ontario fisheries people about why they are netting whitefish on Lac Seul as I haven't got a clue as to why.I haven't caught a whitefish on Lac Seul."
2108474,tlars,2013-09-17 08:25:00,137,"We saw the nets in McKenzie too (3rd week in August). Apparently, the netters were First Nation folks from Manitoba. And, yes, we have caught the occcassional whitefish on Lac Seul. They are there."
2109754,btmbncr,2013-09-17 19:29:00,492,They also had nets set south of Windigo Point.
2110426,new hips,2013-09-18 07:02:00,498,"I've caught a few on Lac Seul also............... 24in. fought like crazy. We also have seen the nets over deep water, like 100ft, they must float. We were just west of Kliners Point."
2057578,btmbncr,2013-08-25 21:23:00,492,"It was the first time for me wife and I staying at Gawley's Little Beaver Lodge.It was excellent accommodations.Cabins are great and Doug and Gayle bend over backwards to make the stay outstanding. The temperatures were cooler than last year.The water temp was 63 to 66 degrees.The bite was""On like Donkey Kong"".We caught more and bigger walleyes than last year.The biggest being my wife's 27 3/4 inch she released.She consistently outfished me on big walleyes.We tried minnows,crawlers and leeches.Leeches work hands down the best.Bottom bouncers and spinners produced alot better for us than jigs.Once I keyed in on the bait fish it was pretty easy to catch fish.We fished Mc Kenzie Bay only one day this trip.There was alot of commercial whitefish netting going on in Mc Kenzie and it seemed to have the walleyes scattered.The rest of the time we fished the main lake basin south of Manitoba Point.I'd check breaks close to deep water,if it had smelt on it it had walleyes there also.The 32 to 26 ft depth range and some times 20 to 24 ft. held the majority of walleyes.Over a dozen times we caught walleyes with smelt tails sticking out of there gullet or puking up smelt in the boat.We had trouble catching fish under 18 inches to eat a couple of days.We had quite a few cold fronts that would scatter the fish especially if there was lightning along with the rain.We just fished more spots and put good numbers of fish in the boat.It took me 2 days to figure out the ""smelt pattern"" and the help of Doug Gawley and another fine fisherman.Colors for spinners,red,orange and chartruese beads and silver blades. Already reserved the last 2 weeks of July and the first two weeks of August for next summer at Gawley's Little Beaver Lodge.Anyone that has any questions PM me here.I'll post some pictures latter.I'm exhausted from the trip home.I wish I was still up on Lac Seul.Bill"
2057834,MorganMan,2013-08-26 06:35:00,341,Sounds like a great way to spend a month during the summer. Glad to hear you had a great trip!
2058218,bigtimeelectric,2013-08-26 08:42:00,174,"Bill, I have been awaiting your report!! Thank you for the details. We are heading back up there next summer as well, but looking at sometime in the last 2 weeks of august. did you trailer down to the access daily? did you have any issues with navigating down there? Is the chip pretty accurate down there? How much gas did you burn in your boat for a month? wow with my boat for a month it would be touching $2k if I stayed for a month. how was the wind? did it make a big difference in the bite?"
2060866,btmbncr,2013-08-26 20:46:00,492,"Bigtime I trailered down to the public ramp daily.The ramp is great and the road in isn't bad if you take it slow.I burned 8 to 10 gallons of gas a day.I ran out and back at 25 mph.We had a couple of bad wind days in the month,went blueberry picking those days.The chip is fairly accurate down that way.I hit a submerged standing tree and took a blade off my prop and chipped 3 gears in the lower unit.I missed a half days fishing getting it repaired to the tune of $1100.00 .Impact damage,warranty doesn't cover it.It was my fault not the GPS chips.I cut a point too close.Lesson learned. The wind helped but several times we had good bites on the leeward sides of islands.It was all about the bait fish on those breaks.Later Bill"
2060890,Riceburner,2013-08-26 20:55:00,436,"Is there adequate parking there?, or ever get too full? thx."
2062057,btmbncr,2013-08-27 10:25:00,492,I didn't find it hard to find a place to park.
2063458,South Dakota,2013-08-27 18:22:00,24,Btmbncr I sent you a pm
2063586,rather-be-fishin,2013-08-27 19:01:00,429,"btmbncr ~ Question for you. Since you trailered your boat down to Scout Bay most days to fish McKenzie and South of Manitoba Point, I am curious as to why you wouldn't just stay at a resort closer to that area? Like: Lac Suel Lodge, Fisherman's Cove or Onaway Resort?"
2063794,btmbncr,2013-08-27 20:31:00,492,It's because of the lodges.Gawleys Little Beaver in my experience is the best value on Lac Seul for someone with his own boat.I've looked at every lodge in NW end of Lac Seul and stayed at 2 other lodges.
2064282,troutwater,2013-08-28 06:06:00,299,Wow a whole month fishing in Canada...so jealous!!!
