2109730,bassnblast,2013-09-17 19:06:00,56,"I try to get up to Canada once or twice a year and I always depend on WC for researching lodges. After visiting five lodges over the past three years, I thought I should ""give something back"" in case others are looking for a good lodge...As background, my trips are usually only 4-nt/3-day or 5-nt/4-day. As such, I always look for a Full Service American Plan with guided fishing. My brother joins me on an annual trip, and I've actually brought a group of high school friends up a couple times. I love to fish for walleye, but I'm also a Texan, so I need to do some casting for pike and bass as well.Hawk Lake Lodge, Ontario (Spring 2011)If you're into smallmouth fishing, this is the place for you! Very cool set-up, with the main lodge and cabins on Hawk Lake, and a bunch of portage lakes that you can have to yourself for a day. You get to the portage lakes by short trails off of the main lake or by UTV from the main lodge. The smallie fishing is out of this world, but the walleye/pike/lake trout fishing is great as well. I caught all four species my first afternoon at the lodge. Hawk Lake produces HUGE walleye (37"" caught and released a few years ago). The main lodge is beautiful, perched on a little cliff overlooking Hawk Lake. The staff and food were terrific. The cabins are some of the nicest I've ever stayed in. The boats on the main lake are great -- decent ones on the portage lakes. The owner is a great guy and LOVES to fish (even took me out one night). He wants you to fish as much as you want to fish. If you miss dinner, they'll put a plate in your cabin for later. If you want to head out before dawn, they'll put breakfast in your cabin fridge. We fished a LOT, and had a great trip.Camp Narrows, Rainy Lake (Fall 2011)I take an annual trip with six of my high school buddies, and it was my turn to plan it. I decided it was time to take the Texas golf weenies on a fishing trip to Canada. Wanted something close to International Falls for travel purposes, and I had fished the US-side of Rainy several times. The North arm looked intriguing and I found Camp Narrows. The crew had a blast. Camp Narrows is a boat-in lodge, so you are pretty remote. Actually, the entire North arm seems pretty remote. We had some crazy weather -- snowing at the landing, upper 70s the next couple of days, cold and windy the last day -- so the fishing wasn't that great. We did get a decent number of walleye (largest 28""), smallies (largest 19"") and pike (largest 35""). All seven of us fit comfortable in a great cabin right on the water. The main lodge was nice and the food was good and filling. The guides were good, but this is definitely a lodge set up for the ""bring your own boat and cook your own food"" crowd. Overall a great time and the guys really liked it.Crow Rock Lodge, LOTW (Spring 2012)Another very cool set-up. Sort of a hybrid, as you are on LOTW, but the lodge also has a handful of portage lakes that you can fish. What a fishery! We caught walleye/pike/bass/muskie. We caught so many bass on a portage lake one morning that we got bored and went back on the main lake -- I never thought that would happen to me. We took a run to Shoal Lake one day to fish bass and pike and it was terrific (my brother caught a 33"" walleye while bass fishing). The lodge is a boat-in about 30 minutes out of Kenora. Very remote, as we saw very few other fishermen/boats. The lodge itself is on the back side of an island overlookingits own little ""harbor"". Its a beautiful setting with some great outdoor seating around a fire pit. Perfect for beers after a day of fishing. The cabins are pretty good. Ours was a ""quad"" and a neighbor on the other side of the wall kept us up all night with his snoring and coughing. It was a ""Goldilocks"" situation with the three guides we had. One was bad, one was good, and one was great. Great boats. Again, the setting here is hard to beat.Eagle Nest Lodge, Manitoba (Spring 2013)My brother and I had been trying to get to Eagle Nest for a couple years, but it just never worked out. Until this year. And it was fantastic. A short 2-hour drive from the Winnipeg Airport, followed by a 45-minute boat ride, you may as well be at a fly-in resort. This place is remote and beautiful. Late ice out this year messed up the fishing a bit, but we still caught some walleye to 27"", some bass to 20"" and a mess of pike, including a 40"". The lodge is on a point overlooking the river (more like a lake with a slight current) and the log cabins are spread out over the entire peninsula. Cabins are nice -- lots of room and great decks overlooking the water. Super staff and the food was good. Great boats, and the guide we had was terrific. The fishing here must be awesome under the right conditions -- especially for smallies. It was worth the wait!Silver Water Wheel Lodge, Lac Seul (Fall 2013)Just got back last week, and all I can say is WOW! What a beautiful lake and amazing fishery. I took the Texas golf weenies up again -- they were sold on Canada after Rainy Lake -- and we had a blast. We averaged 30-40 walleye over 18"" per boat each day before lunch. Lots of big fish, but no monsters. Largest was 27"" (but one of the guides caught a 28.75""). We spent the afternoons casting for pike and caught a ton, including a 39"", 40"", 41"" and 43"" on the last afternoon. We even caught about 20 bass up to 18"", even though they were scattered. The lodge is incredibly remote (26 miles of gravel road after leaving Dryden) and is the only lodge on the south basin of the lake. We only saw a few non-SWWL boats over three days of fishing. The lodge is really nice and the staff were incredibly nice and professional. Cabins were nice and had everything we needed. The guides were great guys and really worked hard to keep us on fish. And the boats were the nicest I've ever fished out of. I hope to go back soon if they can fit me in!Well, that's about it. I hope this is helpful to anyone that may be looking for a good fishing lodge to visit in the coming years. I can honestly say that I would return to any of these lodges in a heartbeat. And I can also say that research on this site, as well as PMs from forum members, helped me make the right decision on picking each of these lodges.If you have any questions about any of these lodges, feel free to shoot me a PM. I'm happy to try and help others the same way I was helped..."

There are so many great lodges in Canada that we are blessed to choose from. Canada is truly a gift from God and Mother Nature. Thanks, Mike Kansas"
