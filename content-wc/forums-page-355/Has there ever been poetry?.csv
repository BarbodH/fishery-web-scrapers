Here's an excerpt from ""The Men That Don't Fit In"", which is something of a statement of Service's own life experiences. He left a job as a banker and traveled to western Canada and the Yukon to live an outdoor life. There's A race of men that don't fit in, A race that can't stay still; So they break the hearts of kith and kin, And they roam the world at will."
