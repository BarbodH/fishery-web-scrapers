2103241,scar,2013-09-14 20:17:00,196,"TomO, Good Question. I own a cabin on Minnitaki and get up a couple times a year for 3-6 days at a time. I always spend at least 1 day on Lac Seul(about 10 hours fishing time) every trip because the fishing is outstanding. It is an effort for me to get there as we are on an island on Minnitaki and its about a 20 minute boat ride to the landing, load the boat and drive to the Deception Bay landing on Lac Seul another 20-30 minutes(load boat, drive to DB, unload boat) and then a 1 hour boat ride to Bear Narrows area(May/June and mid July) or McClean Narrows area (later July and august) Fish on average are 2-3'' bigger and about a lb heavier and we usually catch more (never under 100 in boat/day on every trip) We only use crawlers as minnows are to expensive and to hard to keep alive. We jig 75% of the time or slow troll 1 hook spinners(we tie our own) with 1/2 a crawler. More fish over 25'' on lac seul as well. I know this sounds like a cliche but in may and june fish wind blown islands and points in 12' at the deepest up to 3' and you will catch fish almost anywhere you try but be on the move until you find the motherlode! Seems to be a slightly different spot for us each year. Great water starts at bear narrows and continues to Chamberlain narrows (Have never venture all the way up to Chamberlain as we have never needed to but boy have I heard stories!) Find areas that look fishy and they probably will be. Be mobile until you really get into them and eventually you will. For us sometimes it's the first spot we try and other times it takes us an hour or two to really find the bigger/active fish but we always do. In mid july and august(Fish the water north west of Mclean narrows this time of the year) same rules apply - wind blown points, shorelines, and islands but go deeper 20 - 30 feet and be on the look out with your eletronics for reefs and bars that are surounded by deep water. Fish evey one you find and again you will catch fish on nearly every one but if you aren't catching at least a fish evey 5 minutes move on and soon you will locate more active fish. It would be very easy to get lost on the hour boat ride unless you have grear maps, some experience, and most important, a good locator with a map card - I use the Navonics chip and it is excellent! Yes hidden reefs and bars are numerous but my Navonics map has kept me out of trouble for the last 7-8 years. Not sure i would even go with out it. A much shorter trip would be to drive over to the Hudson Landing and fish the ""Lost Lake"" portion of Lac Seul. Size and numbers here are similar to minnitakki but it is a nice change. Here we look for wind blown clay banks and points and always find walleyes on them. Have only fished lost lake area in June and have done well but once we found Bear narrows we may never go back to Lost. Minnitaki is a great lake but can be a little more tempermental. At times it's tough to catch numbers and size and other times the fishing can be so good on Minnitaki I can't talk my buddies into the hassle of going to Lac seul. Recently Minnitaki in June of 2012 was phenomenal as was Late July/early August of 2011. I fished the Bear narrows are this June (2013) and the Mclean Narrows area the first week of August and both days we blew away anything we were doing on Minnitaki during those two trips."

Minnitaki is a deep, dark natural lake, and Lac Seul is a reservoir. Regardless, the lakes flow together through Abram and Pelican, and many walleye migrate the whole system(who knows why). Tagging over the years has documented this. From a walleye guide's perspective - Minnitaki is fishing and Lac Seul is catching. Way less boat traffic too. I feel that my trophy walleye(over 27.5"") chances are much higher in Lac Seul, but Minnitaki seems to have many around the 26"" mark. Walleyes on Lac Seul have much more girth than Minnitaki walleyes. It has to be a different forage base, or the fact that overall Lac Seul water temps are warmer, and the ones that remain in Seul grow quicker than Minnitaki resident fish. Either lake is still some of the best fishing that you can experience anywhere. 18""-21"" is the proven slot to make lakes into Fish Factories!"
2103849,TomO,2013-09-15 09:05:00,16,"Thanks for the good responses. What about the Pike? Minnitaki Pike seem to be on the smaller side, is Lac Seul much different? Numbers seem pretty good but size has been a bit of an issue for our group, thanks again"
2104041,nitrodude,2013-09-15 09:55:00,60,After 18 consecutive years of fishing both lakes during the same 10 day span in late June through early July I'd have to say both lakes produce big pike. For targeting the bigger fish we've found that bigger Swimbaits get a whole lotta love on both lakes. Eddies off of swift water and bait loaded cabbage field bays are generally our favorite spots.
2109626,Guest,2013-09-17 18:16:00,0,"I have fished Minnitaki 11 yrs now but not Lac Seul. However, guys from my church fish Lac Seul in a houseboat out of Hudson every June. From their stories, I would say our best days on Minnitaki in June are similar to their average days on Lac Seul at that time. I agree with Scar's general evaluation. Part of the difference may be the fact that they use the houseboat, their guide parks them in some remote bay right adjacent to spawning areas. Kind of like staying right on Redpine Bay in Minnitaki. Another difference is that you are not likely to get a musky in Minnitaki. None have been caught by anyone from our camp (Timber Edge) since we started in 2002. Lac Seul has some excellent musky fishin, I'm told. I hope you don't get the impression I'm bashing Minnitaki. I love it there."
