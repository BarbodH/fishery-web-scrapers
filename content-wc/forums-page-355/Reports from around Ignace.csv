Fished Arethusa and Flatrock (mostly Flatrock) The road in was not in to bad of shape some running water in places. Lake levels were up 8 to 12 in. from last fall, a little above normal but not bad. Water temps were around 56-58 degrees and we found the fish scattered thru out the water column from 2 - 40 feet. Once found the bite was good. We found feed growth just starting to emerge. I would guess it was approx 2 weeks maybe a little less behind. You should be set to hit it good. Hopefully the little warm stable weather will have put them into a solid pattern. We had a great trip despite the rain, wind and storms. Plenty of fish were caught. good luck GF"
