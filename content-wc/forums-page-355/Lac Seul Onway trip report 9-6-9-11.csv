2099265,SinOrSwim,2013-09-12 11:05:00,1528,"2013 trip in the books. All 14 made it safe and sound. We all meet north of Minneapolis at MorganMans on Thursday and leave at 0600 on Friday. Almost exactly one hour into the trip, BOOOOMMMM, tire on the trailer goes flat. I'm in the truck behind them and thinking..........ugh this is going to be a long delay. One of the guys in our truck says.......hey, I used to work at Tires Plus in college, let me out. No Joke..........I looked at my clock when we pulled over at 7:16 while I was thinking what the delay could be? We were pulling back on the road, tire changes at 7:26!!!!!!!!!! LOL Stopped in Cloquet to get a new spare. THAT is where teh delay came. Was hoping the fishing gods were testing me. I stopped to get extra cash on the way up. Card not accepted????? Waited til next day when we stopped in Cloquet. I went inside to get cash. $300.00.........machine is processing.........starts kicking out $5 bills. I'm thinking holy crap and chuckled as I watched. $150 in 5's and it stops. Get manager message. After a nice long wait (which didn't matter since we were waiting for the tire) she showed up. Took out the $20 bill cassette, rearranged some stuff and put back together. Machine finishes most of it giving $140 in 20's and the last 10 in ONES!!!!! LOL I have never seen a cash machine spit out $1.00 bills? So, I ask if they can color me up with some 50's for some of the 20's and 5's. Nope. I FINALLY convinced her to give me 20's for some of the 5's. Off to Canada. Trip from there was smooth and uneventful. No issues at the border etc. Got to Onaway and unloaded and holy moly was it HOT. But, after we got stuff unloaded and were having drinks on the deck a small storm blew through and it cooled off.Fished Saturday with my Nephew and a guide. First time we have gotten a guide and I really enjoyed it. Fishing was okay that morning. We stopped for shore lunch. I had a guide for 4 of us so we all chipped in for shore lunch and cleaning fish and cooking. We learned a few things/tips from him and he learned a few from us. The big key was he absolutely loved our fish. I honestly don't remember any big fish that day but everyone was catching really nice fish. Usually in about 22 to 30 FOW. A lot of 18 to 22 inchers but nothing huge.Sunday. I was in the follow boat and 2 others were with the guide. We had an average morning but when we stopped for shore lunch a few of them fishingin other areas caught 20 to 30 fish over 22 with 25.75 being the biggest. Just had sandwiches for shore lunch but our guide asked if we owned a sauce store because we bring a ton of different sauces for the fish. We take everything from ranch to buffalo wild wings sauce, tartar, horseradish etc. Special thanks to whoever mentioned the Fesslers sauce on here a few weeks ago. We ordered some and that was a very popular one. Afternoons were HORRIBLY slow. Each one of them. But, morning were pretty good. Fished a little of everwhere from Onaway all the way over to south of Manitoba point.Monday, I was in guide boat with MorganMans father in law. My morning til lunch was good to above average but both Bill and the guide were having GREAT fishing. LOL Bill's first two fish of the day were 24 and 27. I had about 8 fish in between but nothing over 20. I got a 22 and as the guide was taking off the hook, he got done, picked up his pole and sure enough FISH. 25 incher. It was very humorous as we were all using very similar jigs and the bigger fish were literally being caught 2 feet in front of me and 2 feet behind.Shore lunch we made Baja Walleye Tacos. We make our own Baja Sauce for this. We used regular flour tortillas for ours as it would take too long to fry that many shells. But, I wanted our guide to get a taste of what we normally do. So, I fried up a tortilla into a taco shell, put in the fish, some lettuce/slaw and the baja sauce. He literally said OHHH MYYY GOD!!!!! He absolutely loved them. Said he was totally stealing our idea and I just got done sending him the information. Fishing Tuesday was very very good. Nothing huge but I can't even count the number of fish between 18 and 23 inches. We did have another guy in our group get 2 fish at 26.75 though. Was one of those mornings when you realize why you come up there. Just fish after fish after fish. Got back in Tuesday afternoon and found out my 4 year old was in the hospital. Ugh. We were scheduled to leave first thing Wednesday morning. I checked into charter flights and the earliest I could get was Wednesday about noon. Decided to just go back with the group as it wasn't life threatening and a $3500 flight would have only gotten me back about 6 to 8 hours earlier than normal. But, it sucks to be up there when one of your kids is sick. Very very hard. All in all a great trip. GREAT food and great people. A lot of fun. And as always Onaway is a fantastic place. Even our guide said it's the nicest fish cleaning house/set up he has seen. Maybe MorganMan and Hawkfan will see this and add to it."
2099377,tv4fish,2013-09-12 11:56:00,2694,enuf about this fishing crap --- was your Son OK??
2099393,SinOrSwim,2013-09-12 12:05:00,1528,"Yes, has an infection in his knee and they put him on IV antibiotics for a couple a day to get ahead of it and he was discharged by the time I got home. So far, so good. Follow up appt tomorrow. Thanks for asking!!!"
2100001,Riceburner,2013-09-12 18:43:00,436,Sin.....share a recipe?
2101882,Pikeslayer8,2013-09-13 19:22:00,1460,Ya just gotta get some real good satisfaction when the fishing guide absconds with your terrific Baja Walleye Tacos recipe. Glad you boys had a great trip and your boy is OK.
2102281,pjshorthorn,2013-09-14 08:19:00,5654,"Had to smile at the beginning of your message. We have had everything from the flat tire to broken trailer welds (had to find a welder in the woods around Orr, MN to get that done - cut about 4 inches out of the tongue behind the hitch to carry the weight. My grandfather was famous for carrying two boats on one trailer with stuff packed to the gills inside), trailer lights not working before we've left, during the trip and on the way home...who knew you could blow that many fuses in one trip...., seized up a brand new motor on a houseboat 10 miles into a 60 mile journey....had to be pushed the rest of the way there by the outfitter. Had a new inboard dropped in during the week only to have the linkage for the throttle fail since they forgot to replace a nut, lost all hydraulic fluid in a houseboat while parked for the week only to discover the problem when we backed off the beach and immediately started to spin in circles due to the wind,hit a deer on the way home one year.........etc. etc. etc. We have all been there and as I always say....."" It is an adventure""!!!I also sympathize with how you felt when finding about your son. I was 125 miles out in the Gulf of Mexico fishing all day on one occasion and when we got back within cell service, the phone was blown up with calls from the wife. Our son had decided to swallow a plastic quarter from his toy cash register. Long story short, the wife had to take him to the hospital for x-rays and received strict orders from the doctor to feed him a lot of roughage...all things shall pass eventually. Needless to say, I didn't know if I felt worse about being out of touch when it happened or from the chewing I took from the wife for not being able to answer her calls.Glad the young man is OK. Make it a priority to take him to Canada with you. I took my son when he turned 10 and it was the best decision I ever made. We had such a great time together that I went straight to the doctor the day after we got home so I could quit smoking. Threw the smokes away that day and haven't turned back after 8 years.I cherish all of the time he and I have spent fishing together. You learn so much about your kids when you are in a boat with them for hours on end. All you can do is talk and catch fish!!!Off on my trip in 6 days. Once I clear security at the Atlanta airport the relaxing will commence!!!Tight Lines,PJ"
2103873,SinOrSwim,2013-09-15 09:13:00,1528,"I should add having a guide may end up costing me a lot of money. I go to Canada once a year so have decent gear but don't break the bank. I was talking to him about jigging and he very quickly said it was my rod. He told me to find the bottom with my jig. I did. He said now jig it up and down for a couple seconds. I did. He then handed me his G. Loomis GLX series. Said feel how much lighter it is? yep. Found bottom, jigged it up and down. All I can say is WOW!!!!!! Unbelievable the difference. He held the rod tip on his throat and talked. I could feel the vibration in my hands. Absolutely amazing. Now, comes the question of whether to spend 400 bones on a rod???? yikes!!!"
2104401,South Dakota,2013-09-15 13:22:00,24,"Hey, can you share the famous Baja Walleye Taco Recipe? Thx"
2104801,SinOrSwim,2013-09-15 17:11:00,1528,"they are pretty simple really. chunk up your fish vs full planks, batter and fry. We use flour tortillas and you can either use soft or fry them in your oil. Just lay them in the oil and then with the tongs, fold one side over the other like a taco shell. When one side is starting to brown, flip it over and do the other side. Don't go too brown or they are too crunchy and fall apart. THen, put the battered fish chunks in the shell, use some slaw, cabbage or lettuce and the baja sauce. We make our own and put in plastic squeeze bottles. Don't have a recipe but it's sour cream, canned adobe chipotle peppers, cilantro, garlic, shallot and lime juice. Just go by site on that."
2122801,MorganMan,2013-09-23 16:16:00,341,"Baja Sauce:No real measurements, just add ingredients and taste. I use a food processor and make the day before we leave then pour into those disposable squirt bottles you can get at walmart. (they are a white/cloudy plastic color and look like the old fashioned ketchup bottles, just not red). They run you about $1 each and you can cut the top if there are chunks that won't go through, but we process til smooth for that reason. The base is a 50/50 mix of mayo and sour cream, though I think I use more sour cream? MayoSour creamShallotGarlic ( sometimes shallot is enough as it does impart a little garlic like flavor)Chipotle peppers/Adobo sauce (add per taste/heat)CilantroLime juice (help thin it for bottles)Lime zestI think that's it, I am out of town and the list of ingredients I use is at home. I used a bit of cumin in it this year too, eh? We have also used a packet of taco seasoning in the fish batter, but don't know if it really made a difference? Would be nice to have some slice avocado or guacamole out there, but I have to draw the line somewhere!!"
