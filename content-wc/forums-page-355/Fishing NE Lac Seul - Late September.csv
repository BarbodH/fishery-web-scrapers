2090449,pjshorthorn,2013-09-08 10:05:00,5654,"Howdy Folks;Going back to NE Lac Seul 9/21 for a week of solitude, scenery, cooler weather ( hopefully ) and if things go well a little fishing will get in the way.Been fishing areas from Bear Narrows, to Three Sisters/Ski Doo Point, Kekabeka Narrows, Scaler, Chamberlain and all the way to Wapesi Bay where the river comes in for many years. We started out camping on Taylor Island back in the 80s when Americans were allowed to do so, graduated to Houseboats and as we all got older.....started allowing outfitters to help us enjoy the overall experience.Over the last 15 years we have had great fishing in some secret spots all throughout these areas, but this year's trip will be much later than normal for us. We've talked about a late fall trip every year and now is the time!!!My assumption is that the fishing will be slower, deeper and concentrated mostly on the drops vs. shallow points and sand bottoms. Any feedback on fall fishing patterns, water levels and recent trips to these areas over the last couple of weeks would be appreciated. To anyone that enjoys the NE section of Lac Seul, I'll be happy to answer any questions or share knowledge that we've gained over the years. Some fellas in the group have been doing this trip for 60 years so I'm sure we've either tried it, quit it, dreamed about it, made the mistake and occasionally figured out a thing or two.Tight Lines,PJ"
2092777,illineye1,2013-09-09 11:55:00,5,"Just got back from my first trip to lac Seul, stayed w/ Lac Seul Outposts, fished from sept. 2-6. Fished mostly from chamberlain north. The Walleye fishing was consistent, in fact I cannot remember a spot where we did not pick up at least one fish ...catching most fish in 17-27 ft. off wind blown points. Northern and Muskie fishing was very slow. I think we only boated 10 northern during the entire trip and 0 muskies. Didn't spend a lot of time fishing for them but probably spent at least an hour a day casting for them. Camp owner thought we were about a week or 10 days early for the fall, muskie and northern bite. Water temps were 65-68. I came away very impressed with Lac Seul outposts. It was very refreshing to go to a camp where the owner seemed like he appreciated your business and would come and see how we did each day and offer spots to try the next day. Boat in and out was on time and the camp help were always helpful and friendly. PJ, I plan on going back, what time of year would you recommend if you wanted to stay away from the crowds but still have excellent fishing for all species?"
2093121,milfish,2013-09-09 14:24:00,249,"I've been going to Lac Seul Outposts at Chamberlain Narrows for 20 years now. For about the last 10-12 years we go in the last week in September or the first week in October. The later the better it seems, with the cooler water temps triggering fish. We fish from Bear Narrows to Wapesi Bay, to Jackfish Narrows to Scaler lake. This year from Sept. 27th to October 6th. We hope to find the water temps in the low 50's. Most fish have always come from 18 to 32' of water, points and moving water are always fish producing keys for us. Strobe Jigs in chrome or gold are our jigs of choice. Chartruese is also a great color. We try to get the biggest minnows available 4 to 5 "" Rainbow dace would be preferred when available. Last year, 3 guys 7 days, 1500+ eyes. Kenny and Brenda are terrific hosts and treat us great. The Narrows location is as good as it gets for that far North. We've tried the houseboat in the past but prefer to place our feet on the ground at ""Camp"". There is always great info available at camp in the evenings and a warm cabin and friendly hosts are greatly appreciated. I rate their camp at A+.2013 trip less than 3 weeks. Can't wait.Milfish"
2095290,pjshorthorn,2013-09-10 17:58:00,5654,"Thanks for the feedback on your trip. Glad to know points are still in the fishing pattern and not just plain drops at this time of year. We wil owrk both and see what happens. Sounds like your trip was a great start to what can become an addiction on Lac Seul.We have noticed a marked improvement to the size and quality of the fish when the possesion limit was reduced from 6 to 4 fish and the slot limit was instituted. It is just that good so I don't plan on changing from this area. I'm recruiting young lads so they can carry all the heavy stuff for future trips!!!Tight lInes,PJ"
2095850,David Anderson,2013-09-10 21:49:00,2073,"So, where are you staying. Heading to Lac Seul Outpost for my first time with some seasoned vets on the 18th, leaving the 22nd. Anyone fish crawlers that time of year?"
2102145,pjshorthorn,2013-09-14 06:28:00,5654,"Heading to Lac Seul Outposts as well. I'll end up seeing you guys at the landing the morning of the 22nd. You'll be coming out and I'll be heading up the lake that morning. Been staying there in the spring for a number of years - this will be the 6th trip with them.I've never fished crawlers this late in the year, but I don't see why a tried and true bait wouldn't work as well minnows or leeches. A lot of fellas that I've talked with over the years like salted minnows. A fella I met a few years ago from Milwaukee said that's all he uses and has fished Chamberlain exclusively twice a year - spring and fall.Ken will have a number of suggestions on where to fish lose to camp. We have had great success 300 yds just north of camp on the right. There is a sandy point that comes out quite a ways and drops straight off into the river channel. Good for numbers and eater size fish. Another decent spot would be to head north out of camp, make the left turn at the first point and fish the left shoreline. The river channel is here as well ( to 40 feet). Find the drop, anchor up, cast up onto the ledge and hop it back into the channel. Normally the bite was on the drop, but we have had good success with jigging after reaching bottom. We called it flounder fishing from my days of fishing the flats in Texas......slow, slow, slow.I never go too far from camp....no need to. Take the opportunity each evening to fish off the dock. It can be like fishing in a barrel with the chance at big northern. Lots of current but that is where the bait is.Good luck and leave a few fish for us. I'll be the fella wearing the ND hat at the dock.PJ"
2112130,schroed,2013-09-18 19:29:00,4,"Milfish: I will be boating in to Lac Seul outpost's Sept 25th, departing on the 29th. I have a party of six (including my daughter) I also have been a longtime fan of Lac Seul outpost's and have enjoyed 21 early spring trips and the last 6-7 years we have gone back in the fall. Ken and Brenda have treated us very! very! well over the years. I would enjoy sharing stories and fishing hot spots with you, please look us up while your there. Both our boats are alumacraft navigators, one tagged mn, one wi---always looking to learn sometyhing new, or enjoy a crown withy a fellow fisherman.....hope to see you soon....Jeff S"
2112298,David Anderson,2013-09-18 20:10:00,2073,I'm here enjoying a crown! Had fish tonight and enjoying a crown.

2102209,pjshorthorn,2013-09-14 07:40:00,5654,"Milfish;Thanks for your feedback. Sounds like you fellas are well versed in many of the same areas.Do you have any favorite spots north of camp that you would recommend? I'm thinking about fishing more of the narrows from Tom's Landing north towards pickerel narrows. We fished there years ago ,but too much time has passed to remember the spots we did well.If you decide going south from camp. One spot I've enjoyed over the years is a sandy point on the left just before you get to the turn where you would see Anderson's Lodge. Good structure and deep channel off the point. If you make the turn and pass Anderson's lodge you will head into Kekabeka Narrows. Starting at the west end of the narrows on the left shoreline ( high cliff side), you can pick up some bigger fish with good chances at bigger northern. We have names for a lot of spots on this shoreline, but it is too hard to explain them to any degree of accuracy. One I can suggest is if you start drifting down the narrows easterly, find the stump sticking out of the water, slam on the brakes, anchor up ( double if possible) so you are parallel with the shoreline and cast towards the channel. Hop the bait back up the ledge. You'll know if the fish are there within 10 minutes..I use floating jigheads tied to an 18"" leader that is then tied to a barrel swivel. Above the swivel I use an egg sinker of varying weights depending on the wind or presentation method. The egg sinker tends to slide up the terminal line and I've found it to reduce the number of snags that other weights may cause.I'll be passing you at the landing as well. I'm out on the 27th and you are going in. Too bad you, Dave and myself wouldn't be in camp at the same time to share stories and ideas. I'll be the guy in the ND hat so feel free to introduce yourself and I'll be happy to pass along what worked for myself. I always carry my maps so I can pinpoint some areas for you to consider.Tight Lines.PJBest of luck"
2107874,David Anderson,2013-09-16 21:55:00,2073,"Look forward to seeing you on the 22nd! I'll be with the guy that has the float plane, unfortunately (depending how you look at it) I get to pull the boat up, which is fine with me."
2107890,David Anderson,2013-09-16 21:58:00,2073,"BTW, you wouldn't happen to be with the Blinn group?"
2111578,milfish,2013-09-18 14:44:00,249,"PJ, I don't think we'll be crossing paths at the landing. We are going in at 5:00 PM on the 27th. Most of our spots are north of camp. One favorite is just North of camp where the creek comes in there is a reef on the East side. We have found lots of fish in 23 to 18 feet of water there especially if the water is down below 55 degrees. When the wind blows, we've found lots of fish on the third point after you make the hard left turn going North out of Chamberlain. Good protected spot unless the wind is directly out of the West. Going South from camp, the first island south of Three Sisters reef can be awesome. Rumor has it that that is one of Gary Roach's favorite spots. I've seen the big brown day-guide boats parked there on numerous occasions. We mostly fish big minnows on 3/8 ounce silver and gold strobe jigs. I've never found anything that works as well in stained water as a Strobe jig. They are faceted like a glass bead and the light refracts off in multiple directions. Best jig I've ever used. We also use floaters rigged like you do with good results. Seems like extra flash means more fish. Northland makes a Jig that has a small willow leaf blade dangling underneath the jig. These work well for us too. As far as crawlers or leeches go, never had much luck with them after the water cools down. Have a great time and I'll post some results when we return. As long as ken and Brenda are still at camp we'll have internet access so if you post upon your return I'll be able to check in.Thanks and good luck.Milfish."
