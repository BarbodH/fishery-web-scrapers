I've fished Lac Seul since 1986 and this was without question my best week. Weather was basically perfect and fishing was too! Walleyes were absolutely on the feed like I've not seen before. We caught 40-50 each every day with many fish over the slot. Best depth was 27-30' early in the week with most fish moving slightly shallower as the water cooled throughout the week until the final day we were catching most fish in 17-20'. We caught fish at every single location we tried all week.....what a fun lake! Tons of fish on sand bottom near main-lake points/islands, but almost all the big fish came off hard rock main-lake reefs. Spinners with floats were vastly preferred to jigs. Floating heads also did very well. Trolling 0.8-1.1mph was key. Some folks were stubborn and jigged only.....they were largely disappointed. Bouncers did better than walking sinkers for unknown reasons. http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...ps361735aa.jpghttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...ps1a3575b5.jpghttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...psb14ff089.jpg Good fishing Matt"
