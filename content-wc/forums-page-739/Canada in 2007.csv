My son will be graduating from HS and that is what he wants for his graduation present, and dad is more than willing to accomodate him! We are looking at some lakes, however, we would really like to fish for both walleyes and smallmouth. Anyone have any recommendations for a fly-in that has a lake(s) with both? Thanks for any help, JackSalmon"

If you have never been to canada I would start the process with an attendance at the next all canada show. there a lot of people to talk to and questions to ask of them. go together if possible. its a great night of cheap entertainment. You can actually talk to the lodge operators before you waste a week at their place. then you have plenty of time to look through their brochures. In fact I would even pick up the brochures from the non fly in places you might find them more to your liking

They are selling their services and the best salesman may not be the best fishing lake/accomodations. By all means go to the AC Show BUT, I'd rely on friends or even people on WC before the resort owners/operators. Nothing against the lodge people but I think you all know what I mean."
550736,Guest,2005-07-26 19:23:00,0,"I have heard good things about Ignace outpost, L and M outpost, Kashabowie Outposts which are fly in camps where you would be the only cabin on most of the lakes. Some of their lakes have smallies, and walleye. I had a friend go to Delaney Lake Lodge, which is a fly in camp where there are several cabins, and a main lodge where they serve all meals. All fishing is with a guide, and there are smallies and walleyes. There are a million more, but these are the only ones that I have personally heard good things from. I fish Lac Seul because I have young kids, and do not want to be completely out of touch...and because the fishing there is incredible as well. We mostly fish for walleye and pike but do snag an occasional smallie."
