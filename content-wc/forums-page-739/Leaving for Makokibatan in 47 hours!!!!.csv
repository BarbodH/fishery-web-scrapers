550772,515,2005-07-27 18:31:00,254,Well welcome to Canada and I hope you have a great trip up there. I was up in the area a few weeks back and the fishing was great then. I'm sure the lodge staff will give you lots of tips to make your trip successful. Enjoy and give us a report when you return. Mike
