550704,Guest,2005-07-25 16:12:00,0,I wanted to give a report for the week of 7/16-7/22. This was our seventh straight year at Five Lakes Lodge and like all the other years it was great. During the first part of the week we found most walleye in the 15-18 fow of water range on mid lake humps and wind blown points. In general once you found some fish they were pretty easy to catch. On Friday our last day we found a large school of fish in 20-23 fow of water and finished out our trip with a great day of fishing. Jeff

We caught lots of 20 to 25 inchers, and as many 18 and under as a person can take. Worms one day, leeches the second and minnows the third, most between 18 and 22 feet. We even pounded them cranking. Cheers Clark"
550735,Guest,2005-07-26 19:09:00,0,"Clark, We also stayed at Golden Hook Camp and left July, 24th. I must agree, what a fabulous camp. Hospitality was awesome, and very nice accomodations. We too found the fishing great, plenty of fish in the 20- 25 inch range, and lots of nice slots. Most fish were caught in the 20-26 ft. range. Jigging, rigging, and cranking all proved to be effective. Other than some guy in a large white fibreglass boat fishing everybody's spots, we had no compaints. Fish on DUDE!!!"
550737,Guest,2005-07-26 19:46:00,0,"I was there during the same week and If I remember correctly Gullrock lake does not have ""assigned spots"" Maybe he was there for the first time and didnt know where to fish so he would go to where other people were? I know which boat you are talking about and trust me, he is a very nice guy and will not lead you astray as i pulled up next to him and started fishing. He caught a couple more fish and had to leave as they ran out of minnows. Fishing was good enough to where I will be going back twice next year and will be more than happy to have someone fish next to me b/c at least he shares the same hobby and isn't out there to take away something that i like to do."
550741,Guest,2005-07-26 22:43:00,0,"As far as the ""Assigned Spots"" you are right. But there is a thing called Fisherman ettiquette, and crowding others is unacceptable practice. Read the post on ""Rude.. or am I expecting too much."""
550748,Clark,2005-07-27 08:19:00,5,"Hi all. I guess I gotta get rid of that big white boat as it sticks out like a turd in a punch bowl. I apologize to anyone who thinks I was trying to squeeze them on their spot, that was certainly not my intent. The fishing was great and we will be back next year. Cheers Clark"
550754,Guest,2005-07-27 10:50:00,0,"I appreciate the fact that everyone wants to catch fish. Those who don't fish tournaments aren't expected to understand the unspoken rule of ""not crowding others on their spot"". Those who do fish tournaments and still move in on others spots are just plain rude! I was at Gull Rock Resort and am familiar with the famous white fibre glass boat and the ""net watcher"" who drives it. I was glad he caught fish, but think that he ought to find his own fish. Catching them is only half the challenge, finding them on your own is what makes a real pro."
550766,18Fisher,2005-07-27 15:30:00,59,I think that I was picturing a different boat as the boat I saw was staying at five lakes lodge. My bad!
550769,Hump,2005-07-27 16:36:00,578,Where is Gull Rock Resort. I am not familiar with that one.
550771,Guest,2005-07-27 17:29:00,0,I believe Walleye Queen was referring to Golden Hook Camp.
