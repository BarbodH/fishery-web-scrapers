Any help as to tactics, bait, tackle, etc. would be helpful. It is a tea-colored shield lake with walleye, pike, and perch. Any help from the old hats for this newbie would be appreciated."
550515,Guest,2005-07-19 18:59:00,0,"I would suggest taking a lot of 1/4 and 3/8 oz. jig heads for walleye. Tip with either a leech or half a night crawler for walleye. Drift or backtroll points and weed beds where the wind is blowing in. You'll need a depth finder. Experiment with different depths until you find the fish. Normally you'll find fish in similar depths around the entire lake. Northerns will be in same areas. They'll probably hit anything, but I'd make sure I had some large spoons and bucktails. Hope this helps. Post how you did when you return. Have a great trip!"
550521,phishfearme,2005-07-19 20:05:00,1242,rearview - i've fished in bisco before but mostly out of ray's camps on ramsey lake. you may do well to do a search for this lake on this web site - there's been a good bit of neutral to negative feedback about the quality of fishing there - although it's no doubt abit dated. ask your outfitter (richie's??) for references who've been there during your timeframe. be very leary if he won't give you any. good luck. - phish

550597,Guest,2005-07-21 21:30:00,0,"Thank you for the link and the advice. Luckily for us, the slot has been dropped in NE Ontario this year. It seems that most caught a lot of fish, they just couldn't keep them. I'll report back after the trip. Anyways, back to my question. I think that I've caught the drift that lead jigs tipped with live bait are the ticket, so I'll go purchase some of those in bright colors. Just wondering now what weight rod/reel would be good. I'm thinking med. action spinning in the 6' range with 8# test. Am I on the right track? If I thought I'd only run into walleyes I would go lighter, but I don't want to break off a lot if we hook some pike. The link that you sent me actually got me more excited as I read it because of the slot being dropped."
550625,Guest,2005-07-22 12:40:00,0,"For our annual trips to Lac Seul I always bring one pole with 8# test mono for jigging/bottom bouncing and another with at least 20# braided for pike/musky. Reel type is a personal choice, whatever you are comfortable using. I have one spinning and one baitcaster. As for getting broken off by pike, you will lose far more jigs on snags! I also bring one extra, old pole in case one of my others gets broken or (gasp!) lost in the water."

If the fish have gone passive you can bounce your jig right off their nose and they still won't bite? I'd try to get up early before dawn and get out their with jigs and crank baits work both to see if you can get active fish coming and going to deeper weed beds. Good luck, cause your going to need it. Afternoon I'd be pike fishing and you've got lots of good advice on that. August is a great month for boating that trophy pike. Best of luck to you."
