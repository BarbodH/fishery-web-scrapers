The camp I go to sells them for $26 a pound but will keep them in their bait tank in a separate container for you to make sure you get the full pound. I just have their dock folks get a couple dozen out of that container for me on a dialy basis. Pretty convenient, and over a 2-week trip, worth the difference to me."

550008,Guest,2005-07-01 20:24:00,0,"Bait Shop in Ear falls was Four Seasons Bait Shop. It is on East side of road. You might want to check to make sure they will have them after Labor Day. Good Luck, Al"
550056,Guest,2005-07-05 08:20:00,0,Thank you. Glad to hear it was Four Seasons as we've been buying our bait & licenses from them the past three years.

Just use the jig and minnow combo (early august). Never had a reason to complain, but was wondering if they are really that much better. If so where could i pick some up in nestor falls or kenora. Thanks for all the info and tight lines."
