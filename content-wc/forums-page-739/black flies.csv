550783,Guest,2005-07-28 17:48:00,0,Just wondering how the black flies are this year in Canada. Went on a moose hunt last year and they almost ate me to the bone and they were thick. Are they as bad this year or am I in luck when I return for a rematch with the canada mooses. I will be hunting about 150.00 miles north of International Falls Thanks Abe

I would figure on them being the same again this year as last. Nothing draws them in better then when your field dressing a moose. Good Luck with your hunt. Mike
