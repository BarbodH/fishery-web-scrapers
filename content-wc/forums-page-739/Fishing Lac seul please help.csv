We took and motored to the spot where the trailer your boat over and drop you off on the other side of Lac Seul. The only thing is they only do this until 4:00pm each day. So you need to head back about 2:30. Use your map and try to get to Grassy Bay. We scored some nice fish in good quantities between 5 and 7 lbs.
