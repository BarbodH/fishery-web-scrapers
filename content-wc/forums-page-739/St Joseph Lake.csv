550765,Dr. Lee,2005-07-27 15:29:00,15,"I have fished Lake St. Joe on several occasions, always flying in from Sioux Lookout with Slate Falls Outposts. We are flown into an island that has three cabins and a camp attendant. Its nice to have someone there who will provide ice, keep an eye on the boats, make sure the gas tanks are full, and even has a phone in case of emergency. You rarely see the people from the other two cabins except when you come back in the evening. The cabins have hot and cold running water, indoor showers and toilets and are basic but comfortable. I have fished a lot of places, but I have never seen walleyes like I see in St. Joe. We use jigs and salt minnows with twister tails and literally catch hundreds of walleyes in a week. Big northerns are never easy to find, but I've seen some 40"" plus fish taken each year. Last summer we were trying to figure out, when we hooked a walleye, about what size it might typically be. The consensus was that the fish would be in the 20"" to 22"" range. Although we don't catch the 30"" walleyes, we have been into schools that are in the 24"" - 27"" range. Most of the fish are caught in less than 10' of water on reefs, points, and windy island shorelines. We use barbless hooks for quick release and rarely lose a fish. We only keep fish at around 16-17"" to eat and yes, they can be tough to find! The lake is beautiful. We have seen black bear and cubs, eagles, deer, moose, and woodland caribou. You can travel distances and fish new areas every day, or never go more than 10-15 minutes from camp and still catch all the fish you can imagine. The service through Slate Falls is excellent...very professional and friendly. The price: one person, fly-in, groceries, liquid refreshments, 1 extra night lodging on the way up from Sheboygan, WI, gas, conservation license,incidentals, about $1200 for 6 days of fishing. St. Joe is not a tough lake to fish. Yes, you must watch for reefs, etc., but most of them are just common sense locations. You are provided with excellent lake maps by the outfitter. I know I sound like a marketing rep for Slate Falls, but we have just been treated so well. By the way, I am certainly no walleye trail guy, but when I go to St. Joe, for one whole week, I feel like a champion fisherman!"

550702,Guest,2005-07-25 15:30:00,0,"Usually, at least locally, it is called ""Lake St. Joe"", just so everyone is on the same page. The Old Post is definately an option. They catch a relatively large volume of walleyes and good-sized pike. Not as many big walleyes as say Lac Seul, but a definate option for walleye action and good pike fishing. The guide program there was started by someone who is now a prominent lodge-owner himself, and I know they certainly use to have a pretty good prgram. I'm not certain if that is still the case, but I would suspect it is. NWO Fishing Bum"
550707,Fred_G,2005-07-25 19:44:00,908,"I'm headed up there on Saturday actually. This will be our ninth year at The Old Post. The fishing has gotten better each year in terms of walleye size. It's getting harder to find them small enough to keep. The pike fishing is usually excellent, however last year the big girls were no where to be found. I think it was because they had a very cold spring and the weed growth didn't come in. I'm hoping this year will be more typical of previous years when our group has caught and released several over 40"". One thing to be aware of is that Lake St Joe is full of rock hazards. If you're going for the first time I would highly recommend a guide for at least a couple of days. Props and motors are expensive to repair or replace. Besides, there's nothing like a shore lunch fixed by someone who really knows what their doing. We have been fortunate enough to have the same guide for the entire nine years that we've been going up there and we all look forward to our week spent with someone whom we now consider a friend as well as a guide. There is one other camp on the north end of the lake, Camp Lake St Joseph. I don't know much about it other than seeing the camp boats once in while on the lake. The web site for the Old Post is www.oldpost.com. The web site for Camp Lake St Joseph is http://www.lakestjoseph.com/st%20joe.htm."
550710,scar,2005-07-25 21:21:00,196,is there a public landing on lake st. joe? if so where is it? thanks! scar
550712,Fred_G,2005-07-26 05:39:00,908,"There is a landing on Lake St Joseph, however you are required to have a special tag to fish the lake. The tag is only available through the camps on the lake. I believe there are only 1,500 tags issued per year. The camp operators buy the tags from the MNR based on the number of reservations they have. This, along with the single barbless hook rule, and catch and release, is what is contributing to such a strong fishery."
550713,scar,2005-07-26 06:02:00,196,"hi fred, thanks for your response. i am a part owner of a cabin on an island on minitakki near sioux lookout. we have heard lake st. joe mentioned several times in the area. is it possible to buy a permit for a day or two from one of the camps if we are not staying there? scar"
550714,Fred_G,2005-07-26 07:06:00,908,"I don't know if you can buy the tags or not. To my knowledge, at least in the past, the camp operators have only had enough for their guests. You sure could call one of the camp operators and ask though."
550717,Guest,2005-07-26 10:31:00,0,"The Old Post resort is great, fishing is outstanding but the owner is an absolute ####! NWO Fishing Bum, is that you Mike? I knew you would have something to say about your old place. We look forward to coming to the your place at the end of August, glad you could get us in. Keep up the good work Mike! J. Nielson"
550718,Fred_G,2005-07-26 11:02:00,908,"I will admit that John does take some getting used to. I think what one has to understand is that John is a business man, not a fisherman. The staff that John hires each year go well out of their way to make sure that everything is the best. My solution has been that I avoid John as much as possible and concentrate on all the good things that I get to experience each year. If I need something, I just ask a staff member and they take care of it. The great fishing goes a long way towards making everything else insignificant. Just four more days now...."
550722,Guest,2005-07-26 12:19:00,0,"Joe Neilson, How are you? No, I am not Mike, but let me assure you many have asked me that. What I am though is your guide for the end of August, at least according to MW's most recent planning. I have also guided you before . . . I'll keep you guessing. NWO Fishing Bum"
