They get you on the hot spots and take care of you like no other camp I've been to! Check out their website, there's pic's of the new cabins and all their boats have pedestal seats, which is a must!!"
550818,Guest,2005-07-29 21:42:00,0,I have to 2nd JimD. I bring my own boat and have looked at Evergreens prices. Timberlane gives gas and is cheaper. Your fishing is the exact same area! Everyone has their favorites but Timberlane has been my choice for the last 2 years and will be for many more.

I forget what the next bay is oh just clicked in its sawmill bay there are fish in there and just outside along the white cliffs to the left just before you go in. I remember we caught 2 40"" northerns in the shallow water. if your are not having luck there go below the dam. caught our limits in one day for the week and no slot size when we fished it anyway. good luck."

550806,Guest,2005-07-29 14:31:00,0,"if your asking the question, I assume your talking specificly about the accomodations since the your fishing ther same spots as the folks from Evergreen, Goldnen Fawn and a couple others that are all located within minutes of each other. I have a friend that has been going to Timberlane for several years, he really likes it. In talking w/ him I gather that the accomodations and eqipment are just adquate. I think he likes it because of the price, not 100% sure. Last year we stayed at Golden Fawn and I felt the same way about that resort, By the way Golden Fawn is for sale $1,000,000.00 for anyone with a little extra pocket change. I have been E-mailing w/ the folks at Evergreen, going to give them a try next year, I've heard better things about Evergreen, New or Newer cabins and nice upgrade boats. Just my 2 cents"

550808,Guest,2005-07-29 14:41:00,0,We stay at Evergreen and have only seen Timberlane from the lake as we go by. It does not appear to me that they put much back into the camp. It may be a great place. I take my own boat and I don't like the looks of their docks.
