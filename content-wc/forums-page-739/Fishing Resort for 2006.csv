The cost is $460 a week which include boat and cabin , plus tax, 7 or 8 %. It's cheaper if you bring your own boat, $350.00 plus tax. On Wabaskang Lake."

My client was up in late May 2005 and they boated over 2000 walleye in 8 days. 250 were over 25 inches. The largest were 11# and 10.5#. My group has been going there in the fall for 12 years, we won't go anywhere else in Ontario. FYI"

Would like to find resort that is around $500 per person for 7 days and can catch Walleye and Pike in reasonable numbers. Any help from you experts would be greatly appreciatted. Would like it to be located in Ontario. Thanks, Charlie"
550750,Guest,2005-07-27 09:00:00,0,I was up at Gold Pines Resort on Lac Seul this summer and you will catch an abundance of walleyes and a few pike. Great service from the owners and reasonable prices.

550775,Guest,2005-07-28 01:57:00,0,"I would definitely recommend Golden hook Camp on Gullrock Lake, just out of Red Lake. It fits your price range, very nice modern cabins, and Bill and Maureen are great hosts. The Bonus is that walleye fishing is spectacular and there are nice northerns caught as well."
