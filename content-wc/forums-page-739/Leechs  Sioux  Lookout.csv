550021,Guest,2005-07-02 18:18:00,0,Any idea on prices at these places ? Thanks
550211,Guest,2005-07-08 12:42:00,0,Is Berniers on the right or left as you go towards Sioux Lookout ? Leechs price per pound ? Canadian money ? Thanks
550871,Guest,2005-07-30 15:30:00,0,We've always found decent leeches at Lac Seul Outposts. 800-567-4775 in Sioux Lookout. Good Luck.
