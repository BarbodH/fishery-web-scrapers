Judging by the province-wide pandemonium at liquor stores over the weekend, the drinking public is betting LCBO workers will hit the picket line later this week. Booze store parking lots were jammed with customers stocking up with clinking armfuls of hooch. Their apprehension is justified. LCBO management and its union are at loggerheads over contract language that guarantees no employee will lose his or her job if the provincial booze retailer is privatized. Although the government insists that isn't going to happen (see earlier No Sale post) the union views this attempt to strip job security provisions from their contract as a prelude to privatization. The issue is important enough to both sides that, as was the case in the NHL lockout, both seem willing to go to war to get their way. From the union's perspective, it is about ensuring survival while management argues it needs flexibility like any other retailer to run its business. The casualties in a strike will include restaurants, hotels, bars and the wine industry (who like consumers have been stocking up but would be profoundly impacted by a lengthy strike). For the poor, thirsty public a strike at best will mean navigating union picket lines and at worst the prospect of closed stores, traveling to find open stores and stores that have run out of booze. Beer stores won't be affected nor will privately-owned wine retailers. The LCBO will publish a list of those stores it intends to keep open with management staff if the strike materializes."
