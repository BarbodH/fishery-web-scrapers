550812,Guest,2005-07-29 16:07:00,0,14-28 is the normal on an average 100 plus fish day.

550813,Guest,2005-07-29 16:33:00,0,"Here is the weekly report that is posted on Silver Water Wheel resort's website. http://www.sww-lodge.com/reports.htm His guides only log fish over 18 inches. From my experience, you will catch around 2 or 3 under 18"" for every fish over 18"". July 21, 2005 Daytime highs have cooled down to the high 70's and low 80's, but the walleye bite continues to be hot. Total numbers are still very high and we are also catching lots of big fish. For the week we had 74 walleyes over 27 inches, including 19-28s, 6-29s, and 4-30s. The daily guide sheet average was still between 35-40 walleyes over 18 in. and the highest daily boat total was 84. The bite continues to be split between the shallow water weed bite and the deep water rock/sand contours. As expected, most of the big fish were found in deeper water and the volume bite was at the base of the weed edges between 10  16 ft. Presentation speed has picked up, on average and we are seeing the split between the slow jig bite and fast spinner bite approaching the 50/50 mark. It is still variable by location. There is no set pattern of fast-shallow or deep-slow. We find that we have to check each variable at every spot, no matter what the history was the day before. We have been relying heavily on good electronics to let us know when we really need to slow down on a spot to concentrate on big fish. I neglected to mention in past postings that the lake level has been extremely high for the past 4 weeks. It rarely gets much higher than it is at this time. Shorelunch spots are a challenge, navigation is much easier for those that have seen low water, and the fishing hot spots do change seasonally with the depth changes. We really wouldn't want it to be easy anyway. Pike and smallies have been relegated to incidental catch in search of walleyes. We did have 2-40 inch pike and 3-18 inch smallmouth bass this week, but they were not intended targets. We are always happy to see them, but the search is no longer a priority in the wake of a strong big walleye bite."

550815,Guest,2005-07-29 17:13:00,0,"Thanks Bor. Also, if you navigate to the fishing section of the SWWL web site, there you will find the stats for every 18""+ walleye caught the entire season in 2004. I would say you're about right, if you're looking for numbers under 18"", I would say the SWW crew, depending on the day, would boat between 2.5 and 3 times the number of those over the slot. Using the fish numbers and the angling effort data you can calculate a variety of statistics, and you can calculate for each month or for the season as a whole. NWO Fishing Bum"
