It has been at least a half-dozen years since we have been up there at this time of year. Back then, we spent most of our time up in the Miles Bay area and enjoyed some degree of success. A couple of the guys have expressed an interest in heading east towards Sabaskong Bay or going north of Big Island instead. Any information or suggetstions about those areas would be greatly appreciated. thanks."

Miles Bay has had good reports this year too. I'll be up the same week running a Crestliner 192 TS w/200 Merc. Stop by and say hi if you see the white dog."
550640,Guest,2005-07-22 18:41:00,0,"Thanks for the info. Any experience with bass or musky fishing in that area? After a shore lunch or two, some of the boys like to fish for something different. If you see an old, beat up Lund with a Merc and WI tags, it could be me. thanks."
550645,PJM,2005-07-22 22:14:00,3516,"rockpt The fish are eating the crayfish on the rocks right now and at some point during the day are shallow. The bit seems good in the morning, and then you get a good bit around 2:30 for an hour or so then the next bit is just before dark. I have seen you up there before because of the white dog. I have also met Paul (Eastwind) also in the Obabikon in the fall. I was up there on the 14th though the 19th of july and fishing was good and the weather was hot. Because the lake is up, we fished those rock piles just west of Garden Island in Miles bay and caught fish, but the better fish were West of there. I will be back in September around the 6th and in October around the 6th."
550656,rockpt,2005-07-23 17:05:00,589,"PJM - Thanks for the info. I'll also be up in Oct. so stop by and say hi. Will definitely be spending some time in Obabikon and in Miles Bay around Bottleneck. Joe - I'm not much of a bass guy but I've been told they're in rocky shorelines and can be caught with plastics and shad raps. This is prime time for muskies on LOTW. I fish points, saddles, spines and shallow reefs in deep water. Neck down areas with current can be great. Black and silver bucktails and black and orange spinnerbaits are my old standby muskie lures but I bring everything, cranks, jerkbaits, top water, bulldawgs and glide baits. A couple years ago Mylie's had 8 muskies over 50"" caught in one week in late July."
550732,Guest,2005-07-26 18:17:00,0,rockpt Thanks for the info! Any last tips or suggestions? Hopefully the weather will cooperate. We have had almost a week now of days in the 90s+ here. We have a couple of older gentlemen in the group and they are a little worried about being on the LOTW without AC. Will try to keep them hydrated and in the shade as best we can. A couple of fish frys would not hurt either. QJ
