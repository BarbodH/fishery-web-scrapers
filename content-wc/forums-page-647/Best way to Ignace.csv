565998,guidedfishing,2007-06-05 20:02:00,531,"I was up two weeks ago, and the water in the Ignace area was about 2 feet below what it was last spring. They have experienced a little more rain but not enough to recover significantly. The fire ban was lifted the weekend I was there. Despite the snow and freezing temps we did well enough on walleye's I am heading out again in a few days for another week and will provide an update when I return. Looking forward to temps above 40 F. for this go around. good luck GF"
566014,back357,2007-06-06 09:28:00,106,"Guide, I've been checking the LWCB basin data website as well as some real time hydrometric data website and I think you might be pleasantly surprised. That area's inflow and outflow have significantly increased over the last 2 weeks. I'll be up there on Sunday and have hopes of somewhat normal water levels. The thing to note is that the temps for next week are predicted to be pretty high."
