566648,2746,2007-06-25 15:06:00,3206,We are fishing LacSeul this fall out of the Ear Falls area. One of our party has some conflicts and wants to fly in or out of that general area. Any commercial flights out of Dryden or something close?
566659,IMWalleye,2007-06-25 17:35:00,35,"Hi, Bearskin Airways flies into Dryden, Kenora, etc., from both Winnipeg and Thunder Bay. Trouble is...they charge too much! See the route map in this link:http://www.bearskinairlines.com/route_map.shtml I fly every year from ST of WA to Winnipeg, then drive a rental 5-6 hours. The trip is a no brainer. If your friend is flying from Midwest, the best option is probably International Falls. IMWalleye"
