566569,Guest,2007-06-21 20:52:00,0,"Heyyy, I'm fishing for that big one...I've been entertaining a few friends this past week. Australians visiting Red Lake... We are having a blast trying to find those 28 inchers that I let go last summer... Lots of 19's to 23's but nothing bigger. The cold has slowed things down a tad but we're still finding nice walleye beds here and there. Mind you I'm still hitting that East Bay, I've been catching nice ones in slate bay and behind MacKenzie Island. I've yet to go to Keg or Gullrock...But that's coming soon. McNeelie has been spectacular for the locals and still doing well. Yes I heard about the wash out but that's been taken care of. Water levels are still high up here and the rain seems to love Red Lake like the rest of us....Maybe it's time to stop that rain Dance... Happy Hunting Mista W"
