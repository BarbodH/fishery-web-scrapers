We weren't sure whether bait shops further north would be open when we passed through. Both Vermillion Bay and Four Seasons in Ear Falls were still open, and selling for $40/lb. We bought some mid-week at Four Seasons. Quality was fine both places."

566791,thunderatwork,2007-06-29 06:06:00,79,"over the last few years, it seem like in early august leeches can be real hard to find. if rainy lake sport shop doesn't have them no one does."
