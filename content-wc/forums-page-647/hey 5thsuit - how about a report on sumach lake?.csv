566110,5thsuit,2007-06-09 18:01:00,54,"The second weeks weather was brutal to our trip. We landed just as another cold front came in. Friday and Saturday the high was 42, the Lakers,Bass,Perch and Pike were biting but not the Walleye. On Sunday it warmed up to 60s by early afternoon and then the rains came, and I mean monsoons, the lake came up over 2 feet in the next 3 days. Monday,Tuesday and Wednesday morning when we bailed out the boats the water was flowing over the back. After this rain everything slowed down. In 12 trips in this is the second time we have struggled to catch walleye, our first time the water temp never got over 38, every year is different and the fishing was great as usual, but the catching part could have been a whole lot better!!"

566171,phishfearme,2007-06-11 19:25:00,1242,"5thsuit - tough luck about the weather. instead of telling people to ""have a great trip"" i usually like to say ""i hope you have good weather"" since that's about the only thing that'll screw up the ""catching"". to comiserate with you abit, we flew outta cochrane to fish kesagami and partridge lakes in july 2001 and we arrived to a blizzard which cancelled the canada day celebrations and also cancelled out first day in. the weather never got much better with a constant, 5day 20-30 west ""breeze"" which actually prevented us from even getting out since the dock faced due east. the shallow lakes never cleared up and we had a terrible 6day week. i guess if you do enough of these trips, you're gonna get a few lemons. better weather next year! phish"
566634,jigman 2003,2007-06-25 09:18:00,981,I'd be happy to provide a report/feedback on this lake and outfitter to anyone who cares to email me. Got back on the 23rd (actually the 24th at 1:00 a.m.).
566669,phishfearme,2007-06-26 04:31:00,1242,"jigman - would like to hear more details. i sent you an email to your ""smsrss"" address. if this is the wrong address please let me know. thanks, phish"
