566638,Frankm,2007-06-25 10:17:00,154,I've stayed at the Econo Lodge in Duluth. It was ok and around $60 a night. There is a decent restaurant/bar through the parking lot. Not much parking for a truck and boat. The Days Inn in Duluth is $70 and having decent parking.
566654,Guest,2007-06-25 16:12:00,0,Econolodge was always closer to 90$ for me. Plenty of boat parking on the other side of motel. There are a lot of mom and pop places on 53 but don't know their names. macdonald
