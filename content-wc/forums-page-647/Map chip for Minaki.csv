566656,Guest,2007-06-25 16:16:00,0,I am leaving for Minaki in a couple of weeks and was wondering if any one knows of a good map chip available for the Minaki area. Thanks in advance for any info. :confused:
566665,Guest,2007-06-25 20:25:00,0,"I recently bought and am happy with Navionics Canada East 14XG. I used it around Minaki, up into Big Sand and Roughrock. You also get all of the Great Lakes, St. Lawrence out to the gulf. There isn't a smaller one--you get all or nothing, even if you'll never use most of the data on the chip.http://www.navionics.com/ChartSearch...ChartCode=14xg"
