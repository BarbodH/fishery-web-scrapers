566647,baseball,2007-06-25 13:43:00,1,"In defense of the Lodge Owner I truly believe there is not a single lodge owner on Cedar Lake that would turn a blind eye to any violation of the fishing regulations. Having stayed at numerous resorts on Cedar Lake our party finds Al & Kim of Cedar Lake Lodge(now of permanent vacation home) to be one of the best promoters of CPR and have personally heard Al comment many times (you wouldn't come and fish walleye of of season...why Muskie?) No Lodge owner can control what a fisherman does out on the water. That part is up to the individual to live by the ethics of a true sportsman. We have also seen Al asking a party to leave because they disobeyed rules. Get the facts first....... >Glenman.....regarding the pre-season musky fishing you don't >condone but are happy to promote on this site, shame on you! >There is a sound biological reason why these fish need to be >left alone during their spawning period....that is why it is >ILLEGAL to fish for them.

A CO cannot make charges based on what is written here without solid evidence. To me it sounds more like you are jealous that you cannot catch a muskie and nothing else but that!! >Glenman.....regarding the pre-season musky fishing you don't >condone but are happy to promote on this site, shame on you! >There is a sound biological reason why these fish need to be >left alone during their spawning period....that is why it is >ILLEGAL to fish for them.

564090,Guest,2007-03-23 11:19:00,0,June 9th? Muskie fishing on Cedar Lake? Tip line 1-800-222-tips (8477) Ask Al to point out the funeral director!
564098,bioboy,2007-03-24 15:52:00,35,"Thanks. Those are the maps I remember seeing in the past. I had a feeling that a map withcontour lines was too much to hope for !) Guess if I have to choose between a good map and light fishing pressure, I can forgo the map. I think we are scheduled for the week of 7/21 - 7/28."

564120,Guest,2007-03-26 14:15:00,0,"Glenman, If you think I sound a bit harsh you may be unpleasantly surprised this spring to find out the total lack of humor and judgemental qualities of the local C.O's, who find nothing more aggrevating than individuals who think the rules are only meant for someone else. Good fishin'...keep it legal."

Don't take this personally, but I sincerely hope the guy gets caught. People like this who knowingly and blatantly break the law give the rest of us visitors to Ontario a bad name."
563920,Guest,2007-03-15 14:39:00,0,Im not going to make excuses for him..he's a bit of an oddball (a funeral director)and has had the most fishing partners over the years cause no one wants to chase muskies all day..but has never kept one..never takes them out of the water ( uses a cradle) except for a quick picture..he's even guided for Bob Mehsikomer up their a few times (in season)
563927,nitroman,2007-03-15 21:21:00,368,"I'll be there the 1st week of june this year again (76 days). We have always stayed on the east with a few jaunts to the west every now and then. Last year 3 of us decided to really explore the west side and man did we catch some nice eye's. We set up a drift in one of the bay's and were pulling only 2 or 3 fish per pass but they were all 18""-24"" with a bonus 38"" and 28"" musky (not intentionally targeted) also a boat load of northern when we got towards the weeds. My uncle still needed to fill his limit to take home and we honestly had a hard time finding an eye under 18"" in that bay. The west side is clear and the east side is tea stained so we were always told to fish deeper on the west side I still am not sure if that's true or not. Will definatly give the west a little more attention this year though. Rstorm- for walleyes learn the art of backtrolling pulling little joe type spinners(we make all of ours out of sevlon or seven strand it helps with bite-offs from northern) blade colors that seem to work for me are chartruse,orange(if you like to catch northern)silver, gold, and firetiger. and jig jig jig or my favorite drifting jigs tipped with 3"" lindy munchies. Don't be afraid to ask questions there is a wealth of knowledge on this board and it keeps us occupied until we make it up north. I've learned alot just reading posts here. Nitroman"
563934,Guest,2007-03-16 06:58:00,0,"I HAVE BEEN TO CEDAR LAKE TWICE, BOTH IN LATE JUNE OR EARLY JULY... I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH WALLEYE FISHING SO WE DIDN'T TARGET THEM MUCH - BIG MISTAKE. IT IS A REALLY GOOD WALLEYE LAKE. I NEVER FISHED MUCH ON THE EAST SIDE, STAYED AT CEDAR LAKE LODGE- SO WE STAYED ON THE WEST SIDE MOSTLY... HOWEVER...IF YOU HAVE YOUNGER KIDS THAT WANT A LOT OF ACTION AND A LITTLE ADVENTURE...TAKE THEM TO ST. CLAIR OR TURTLE LAKE ...SAME LAKE - DIFFERENT NAMES. IT IS A FAIRLY LONG RIDE (IT IS SOMETIME TOUGH TO GET TO DUE TO LOW WATER LEVELS) THROUGH CEDAR LAKE INTO PERRAULT LAKE ... DOWN THE ORD RIVER ( I THINK) ALL THE WAY TO ST. CLAIR... WE CAUGHT TONS AND TONS OF SMALLER NORTHERNS AND WALLEYES... NOT A TROPHY AREA , BUT I THINK EARLY IN THE SUMMER IT IS WHERE SOME WALLEYE ACTULLY SPAWN..SO YOU COULD FIND A BIG FEMALE STICKING AROUND. JUST AN ADDED ADVENTURE IF YOU HAVE SOME YOUNGER GUYS WITH YOU AND YOU WANT TO KEEP THEM BUSY... TAKE SOME EXTRA GAS...THE TRIP DOWN THE RIVER IS FULL OF WILDLIFE AS WELL... WE HAVE SEEN EAGLES, BULL MOOSE, LYNX, ETC"
563935,Guest,2007-03-16 08:03:00,0,"Bob, Yes its the Ord River that you take to St Clair..like you said its an adventure and even more so if the water level is down..if the level is up its a piece of cake..but its worth the ride as the fishing is fast..no one in our group has ever caught anything big there but its usually one fish after another..for those who havent been there ask your resort owners how to get there..I havent made the trip in about 6-7 years.. I remember that finding the mouth to the Ord is tricky or at least it was for us the first time.."
563940,Guest,2007-03-16 09:57:00,0,"BELIEVE IT OR NOT ....... I CAUGHT A 36 INCH PIKE THERE (ST. CLAIR) IN SEPTEMBER ONE YEAR. BUT IT IS A SNAKE PIT .. SMALLER GUYS BOTH WALLEYE AND PIKE BUT TONS OF THEM.. HAVE YOU HEARD THAT IT IS A SPAWNING AREA IN THE SPRING? I REALLY LIKED CEDAR LAKE LODGE ( AL & KIM) AND CEDAR LAKE ITSELF... NOW THAT I AM MUCH MORE SKILLED IN THE PURSUIT OF WALLEYE, I SHOULD TRY IT AGAIN.... WE HAVE CAUGHT SOME NICE FISH THERE... 45"" MUSKIE 28"" WALLEYE 1000+ GOOD SIZED PERCH LOTS OF SMALL PIKE - NO TROPHY PIKE THOUGH. NEVER ANY TROPHY PIKE THOUGH...."
563943,Guest,2007-03-16 12:30:00,0,"Not sure if St Clair is a spawning area or not..could be though Dont know why but Cedar Lake has never been a trophy Northern lake..Ive caught a 38"" and Ive heard of a few over 40"" but thats about it..maybe it has to do with the high population of Muskies.. Dont know if you have a trip booked for this year but I know Cedar Lake Lodge has a lot of openings from the middle of July and on.."
564050,bioboy,2007-03-22 03:17:00,35,"Glenman, I'm heading up there this year. Are you aware of any good maps of the lake? Obviously you don't need a map, but I've only been there once, while my brother has been there 5-6 times. I hate to give up that advantage to him!!"
564052,Guest,2007-03-22 06:45:00,0,"Go to Cedar Lake Lodges website: http://www.sportfishin.com/ Click on ""Location map"" and then in the drop down click on ""map enlarged""..then just print it out.. Also, I believe the bait shop at the corner of 17 and 105 in Vermillion Bay has the big fold up ones..my fishing partner has one and Im pretty sure thats where he bought it"
563794,Guest,2007-03-09 15:09:00,0,"anyone been there, hows the fishin"
563808,Guest,2007-03-10 02:09:00,0,"We'll be staying at this lodge for the first time this June. Hoping for a nice stay. However, last September we stayed at Keystone Lodge...located on the east part of the lake. The fishing was a little slower than we expected, but the temperature was unusually warm...low to mid 80s. However, we were still able to catch enough fish to keep the week interesting."
563815,Guest,2007-03-10 07:06:00,0,"Ive been going to Cedar Lake Lodge for over 22 years now..we usually go the first or second Saturday in June..Al and Kim are the third set of owners since Ive been going and they are, by far, the best ones yet..they are very aggressive as far as upkeep and rebuilding of the camp..you wont be disappointed in the accomodations..our group has grown over the years from 4 to 16.. As for the fishing..weather and water temp will play a big part..Al will give you a map of the lake and mark it as to where fish are being caught..if you hit it right you can expect to easily catch daily limits of walleyes..trophy fish for guys in our group have run from 28-32""..if you like to fish muskies this is the lake..its one of a few Class A musky lakes in the province..one guy in our group fishes muskies almost exclusively..on our trip two years ago he boated muskies of 47"", 49"", 50"" and 54""..I myself caught a 48"" fish last year while trolling for Walleyes with a shad rap.. Even after going for all these years guys in our group still develop new spots to catch fish every year..you will have a great time"
563841,nitroman,2007-03-11 20:35:00,368,We've been spending the first full week of june there staying at Cedar Point Resort for a few years now and the walleye have always been good to us. The weather can be touch and go at that time though. We still find new places and new ways to catch fish each year. If you keep moving and looking for active fish they are there and you will have no problems. I have come to the conclusion that in early june the walleye in Cedar Lake prefer a west wind with a light chop and a slow presentation such as drifting jigs or whatnot. Talk to the camp owner and ask the the guys in the fish house at night where the fish are and whats working to catch them. Good luck and I hope you enjoy the lake as much as I do!
563872,Guest,2007-03-13 07:13:00,0,excellent point Nitro about the west wind..that always seems to be a constant for the great walleye fishing on that lake
563880,Guest,2007-03-13 20:51:00,0,"Do you prefer to fish the east or west side of the lake? Last year we were at Keystone Lodge and fished only the east side. This year we'll be at Cedar Lake Lodge, which is on the western half. I'm going up the first week in June. When are you going up this year?"
563884,Guest,2007-03-14 06:10:00,0,We are going up this year on June 9th..this is how it has worked for us the past couple of years..if the water temp is above 60 you should find the bigger females have migrated to the west side already..if its below 60 they probably still are on the east side..in 05 we spent a lot of time on the east side for this reason and were able to get some big fish...but in the evenings we would just go to the narrows just north of the island and jig and catch one eating sized male after another...in 06 the water temps that week were in the low 60's..we went to the eastside only once just to check it out..but the big females had already moved to the west side..matter of fact we were getting them as far south and west as Sawmill Bay Thers two main spawning areas..one is on the south east end and the other is in Nelson Lake where we also did well when the water temps were below 60...
563894,Guest,2007-03-14 13:16:00,0,"Thanks for the advice. My group and myself are a little new to walleye fishiing, so I really appreciate the advice."
563896,Guest,2007-03-14 13:54:00,0,"Upon your arrival at the dock most likely Al, the owner will pick you up in the pontoon to take you out to the island..just ask him where the fish are and what they are moving on..unlike some lodge owners he realizes that customers that catch fish are happy and happy customers become repeat customers."
563906,Guest,2007-03-14 21:28:00,0,"You go the first or second week of June every year, and one of your group members fishes almost exclusively for muskies? Interesting... Especially since muskie season in that part of Ontario doesn't even open until the 3rd Saturday in June..."
