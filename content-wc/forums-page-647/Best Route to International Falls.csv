Like others have stated, the bypass around Eau Claire is finished and so is the construction in Duluth. Pretty smooth sailng. Are you stopping to spend the night somewhere? Where are you headed in Canada? Be careful when you're in Ontario. I've heard the Provincial Police are cracking down on speeding. Also watch out for deer. We took two vehicles/boats up this year and the poor guys in the other truck almost got it three separate times between the trip up and back. Have a good trip. Joe"

Take I-39 from Bloomington/Normal to Rockford, then 90 on to Madison and 94 on to Eau Claire, & US 53 the rest of the way to I-Falls. Bellbuoy"
566784,Newby,2007-06-28 17:14:00,148,We leave from Indy and go I-74 to Bloomington/Normal and up. It is a nice easy drive. I would go up through Rockford if I was you.
566792,rockape,2007-06-29 06:53:00,215,Just came back last week. Cut over on I-80 (no construction at all) to 39 and on up. No problems at all. The only construction there was between South Bend and Sioux Lookout is on 53 just north of Eau Claire. I think it might be only on the southbound lanes. Probably 15 miles of one lane. Still went through at 55mph. Have a great time and catch some big fish!

It is a bit shorter, the roads are good as most of 53 between Eau Claire and Duluth are 4 lane."

We went through I/Falls the 1st week of June from the Lafayette area and took sr24 over to El Paso Il and took the interstate north from there. This year was by far the least amount of construction we have ever seen and unless they have recently begun working on something I would not hesitate to use this route. good luck"

566770,Guest,2007-06-28 10:12:00,0,"As a former employee of AAA, DON'T GO THAT WAY!!!! Travel to Rockford and take I90 to I94 to 53 North at Eau Claire. The 53 bypass around Eau Claire is open and fantastic, 53 north is 4 lanes all the way to Superior/Duluth, limited Access. Travel time from Rockford to Duluth should be 6 hours depending on traffic volume and stops. I continue thru Duluth on 53 all the way to I Falls. Some guys believe using hyw 2 around Duluth is better but if you are not towing a boat, going straight thru is very easy now that the road construction in Duluth is completed. Have a good trip."
566774,Guest,2007-06-28 14:10:00,0,"As mentioned before, all of the construction at Eau Claire has been finished. If you go to www.mapquest.com and type in Eau Claire, the map will show you the by-pass around the downtown area. Zoom in on the intersection where Bus 53 leaves US 53 and you will see that you need to stay in the left lanes after exiting I-94 at exit 70. The construction in Duluth is finished, up the hill and turn left at the mall, piece of cake. Let the good times roll."
