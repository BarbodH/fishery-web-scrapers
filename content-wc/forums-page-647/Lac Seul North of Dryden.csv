566697,Sutsgold,2007-06-26 21:19:00,219,Is there a road from dryden to lac seul (central part of the lake)? Is there a public launch? Is it free? This time of year would I have a better opportunity to catch fish here or would it be better to launch from hudson and fish the east end of the lake? I imagine the fish will be on shallow reefs and island points. Correct me if id be wrong. Thanks

566699,Guest,2007-06-27 06:29:00,0,"I am not completely sure, but I have been told that there is a public launch someplace by Williams Bay, which is on the road north out of Dryden (first right past the McDonalds as you head west). I have never gone to that launch or the Williams Bay resort, so I am not sure, but that is what I have been told. The road out of Dryden starts off as black top but turns to gravel after a few miles. Was on it a week ago and the gravel is in the worst shape I have seen in a decade. Very torn up due to both the amount of logging and the large rains that came during the last few weeks. However the logging companies due a good job of repair as a grader is always working so it may be flat as a pancake by now. See the other reports on LS fishing, but as of last week, the fish were pretty scattered. Some in 4 feet and others in 25 - 30. Hopes this helps a little....IA Walleye"

566706,Guest,2007-06-27 12:28:00,0,"Sutsgold, Turn north at Dryden GM as IA Walleye suggested. It's about 45 miles to the Williams Bay landing. It is very tricky getting all the right cut-offs, but I could explain the route in great detail if you want. Was last over there a couple weeks ago. With the low water there was less than a foot of water to get down Williams Creek (east)to Williams Bay, but that is quickly becoming less of a problem. To get to Lac Seul you would then go north out of Williams Bay. Do you have a good knowledge of the area and/or some good maps? I can give you whatever specific details you need as I'm very familiar with that whole area. Just post a reply here or send me a personal message through this website (you have to go search for my name in the member list). NWO Fishing Bum"

566708,Sutsgold,2007-06-27 14:02:00,219,"NWO Fishing bum, thanks for the reply. I have some good road maps of the area up there, and am familiar with dryden. I also have the gps chip of lac seul on my boat. I have never fished the central part of the lake, so williams bay / creek is all new to me. I just want to spend a day up there. Will I be able to get on good amounts of fish if I just target islands? Do I need to travel far by boat to get to better fishing? I leave tomorrow afternoon, so any immediate help would be greatly appreciated. Sutsgold"
