573590,Guest,2008-05-07 07:37:00,0,BEEN FISHING IN CANADA MANY YEARS NOW...THIS WILL BE OUR FIRST TIME TO WOMAN RIVER CAMP / WOMAN RIVER SYS... GOING THE LAST FULL WEEK OF JUNE. ANY HELP WOULD BE VERY APPRECIATED.
573594,Walleyewhiz,2008-05-07 07:56:00,4,Decent lake. Long way to drive on gravel road. Mayfly hatch is usually present about that time period. We have been to Woman but go to Bluffy Lake Lodge now. You'll pass the sign on the way to Woman. It's a little closer to town and cabins and equipment are excellent. Fishing is very similar to Woman.
573662,Guest,2008-05-08 07:30:00,0,Spent the last 20+ years on this system. We are usually there the first part of June. Decided to try something different this year and booked at another lodge. Woman is a fun system to fish especially anytime in June. If you want I can e-mail you directly on the areas that we fished over the years. Take care.

573683,Guest,2008-05-08 11:40:00,0,Tried to send you some info but it keeps getting blocked by spam filter? Do you hav another e-mail address?
573692,Guest,2008-05-08 12:40:00,0,Hi. its a long way on a gravel road. the last time we were on it one of those huge paper mill trucks tried to pass us. those things throw gravel and dont care what damage they do to your car windshield paint job or boat not to mention the cloud of dust that you cant see through. I suppose they figure its their road and for anyone else its just tough luck. good luck.

However, I plan my trip later in summer/early fall, so not sure how much help I can be with the fishing. Your hosts at the camp, Paul and Debbie are awesome people. Paul will help in any way possible to find fish and have a successful trip. Live bait available at the camp, and works best for when we go. Lots of eater walleyes, and big pike. Portage lakes are definitely worth it. The chain is easy to fish, but if I were you I'd grab a guide for a day. Shouldn't cost too much and they do a great job...think last time we had a guy named Matt from Canada North (WRC uses their guides) and he did a great job. Beautiful place."
573739,Guest,2008-05-09 12:42:00,0,thanks Matt...i planned on getting a guide for one day... any particular portage lake ? my home email [email protected]
