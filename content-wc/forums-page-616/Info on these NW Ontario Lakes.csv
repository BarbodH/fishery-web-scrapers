573693,back357,2008-05-08 12:47:00,106,"Looking for anyone with any current info on the following lakes: Kukukus Barrel Indian Flat Rock Arethusa Heathwalt I've been going up there for the past 7 years, but this is the latest I can remember ice still being present. My trip is the second week of June. Past couple of years has been hot (temperature and fishing). Ran into Mayflies the past 2 years. Pretty sure that won't happen this year. Given this late ice, am I going to hit the post spawn period where the fish aren't active or will I be past that? I hear the water is up considerably from last year. Not sure what that does. I'm guessing the cabbage won't be too thick. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Oh, and if anyone fishes Kukukus, I'm interested in hitting the North end (right near the mouth of the Basket River), but concerned that the water levels will wash out the roads so I may have to stay on the South end. Thanks, in advance, for any insight - 29 days 18 hours till departure!!!"
