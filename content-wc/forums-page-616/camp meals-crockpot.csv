573723,back357,2008-05-09 06:56:00,106,"Just use the liquid from the 16 oz. jar. As the meat cooks, there will be a fair amount of liquid (some fat) that will add to the overall juice amount. Another point. You can make this ahead of time and put it in the fridge. For those who are concerned with their fat intake, once the whole thing cools, you can take the hardened fat off of the top, freeze the whole thing, transport, and then just pop it back in a crock pot to warm it up (probably takes 4-6 hours on low) while you're out on the lake or just throw it in a pot when you get back to camp. As an added touch, I also bring some sliced cheese (provolone or swiss) and put that on the sandwiches. Killer meal. Cheers."
573549,Guest,2008-05-06 11:03:00,0,"In addition to the normal foods like fish and steak, we're looking to get a couple of crockpot meals in. We moved our big meal to mid-day, so I'm looking for something ""lighter"" to do at night. We're going to do sausage peppers and onions one night. Issue is that we can't do stuff like chili or spaghetti in the crockpot as one member can't do the red sauce. SO anyone have a good ""lunch"" kind of meal to do in a crockpot? Thanks."
573553,back357,2008-05-06 11:42:00,106,"I have about the easiest, most satisfying crock pot meal. Ingredients: 1 4 lb Chuck Roast 1 16 ounce jar of Pepperoncinis 1 package of brown gravy mix Take a 4lb chuck roast and place it in the crock pot. Pour the liquid from the Pepperoncinis into a measuring cup or small bowl. Mix the brown gravy mix with the Pepperoncini liquid. Pour the liquid in the crock pot. Pour the Pepperoncinis right on top of the chuck roast in the crock pot. Cook on low for 8-10 hours. Shred the meat with two forks. Place back into the crock pot with the liquid. To serve, put the shredded meat on buns and top with some of the Pepperoncinis. You can use the liquid as a dipping sauce (like au jus)."

573560,Guest,2008-05-06 13:50:00,0,"I make up a huge batch (for 11 guys)of deer stew BEFORE we leave Iowa, keep it frozen, on the way up it thaws. On the first night when no one wants to cook or clean, we heat it up dish it up in paper bowls. Everyone chows, throws away the bowls and we comence with the fish lies. That way you don't waste any time in Canada cooking. Besides it helps me to burn some of my anxioty the week before the trip. It's yummy too. Last year I forgot it in the freezer and was darn near linched. Keep'er on the bottom. JohnB.O.A.T."
573623,Guest,2008-05-07 11:53:00,0,JohnB.O.A.T. How about the recipe for your deer stew. I'm always looking for another one that gets that kind of comments - people complaining when you don't make it is the best endorsement you can get. Press Lake Camper
573640,jerry bark,2008-05-07 17:34:00,822,"I would think about some nice soup recipes and take along some good bread. I also like to cook a whole chicken in the crock and then cook some noodles in the broth while i de-bone the bird. easy chicken and noodles. you could do beef and noodles that way too, stew beef, stock, onion, garlic. get back cook up some noodles add to the crock pot and thicken a bit with corn starch. you can find a variety of recipes for ""white chili"" which is usually a chicken and tomatilla based chili. that would fit the bill. cheers jerry"
573641,Tonyo,2008-05-07 17:36:00,212,"Ok, I'll fess up, JohnB.O.A.T's stew is great. If he forgets it this year a linching might be mild. I'll have to double check the coolers this year. My guess is, if we remember the stew we will probably forget something else. Tony"
573651,Guest,2008-05-07 20:12:00,0,"The stew is'nt anything that hasn't been done before by anyone else. The one thing I might do different is that I use only the backstrap meat and cut it into 2 inch chunks, sprinkle a Carribean Jerk on it and put them in a vacuum sealer for a couple days so the flavor gets sucked well into the meat. It's hard for me to cut the backstrap up because I think it's kind of a sin to not leave the backstrap whole and slow cook it on a grill, (which we do for another meal up north)but I think the backstrap meat makes all the difference. Other than that it's the usual, taters, (small red ones only), lots of sweet corn, a can or two of mixed veggies, and of course the good ole stand by, Cream Of Mushroom soup. If I want it to be thicker I'll mix up some milk and flower and keep pouring it in untill I'm happy. I usually have it to where you use a fork and not a spoon. To me the thicker the better. Seems to stick to my ribs better. I also brown the meat first in a pool of homemade butter before I put it in the crock pots. There is always around 10 in our group so I have 3 pots going at once. Hope you like it. I gotta go now............I'm gettin kind of hungry! Keep'er on the bottom. JohnB.O.A.T."

Cuts cooking and cleaning times down and you can maybe leave the crock pot at home as all your doing is warming food. Try the Food Network also if the 1180 things on the other site isn't enough.. :) Al"
