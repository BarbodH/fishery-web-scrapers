573567,Guest,2008-05-06 14:29:00,0,I am going up to a friends cabin on this lake at the end of may. I like all the info I have heard but I am just wondering if someone could tell me specific depths to fish in for walleyes this time of year and what lures and colors seem to work the best. Any info would be great!! Thanks
573602,Guest,2008-05-07 08:57:00,0,"Nick, My family and I have been going to Pakwash for about 35yrs. We really love this lake. There is great Walleye and Pike fishing here.. This time of year with the stained water in this lake the fish will be shallow. Really, any depth from 14ft up to the shoreline can be good. You will need to experiment; but don't be afraid to go even into 3ft of water at times. Especially if there are stronger breezes. Fish the wind blown sides if in doubt and look for the weeds. Fish the weed lines and drop offs. With this late of an ice out there may not be that many weeds. We like to jig and use spinners. It just depends on how the fish are hitting.. Vary your techniches and see what works. We like Chartruse, silver and gold for colors. Good luck to you."
571957,REG,2008-03-09 20:24:00,445,"http://www.snakefalls.com/ Rob and Nancy have put a lot of work into the cabins over the years. I don't think you'll find better anywhere on the lake. And they have a very good location - protected and right where the Chukuni River comes into the lake. We'll be up there the first week of June (as usual) and I've also been up a few times the middle of September. Just like anywhere, some days are better than others, but you shouldn't have any trouble finding some fish - especially walleyes - on Pakwash. Rich"

571958,Guest,2008-03-09 23:41:00,0,"Sarg, you might want to check out Pakuni Lodge on the south end of Pakwash. It's the only resort on that end of the lake. The Chukuni R. flows out of the lake at your front door, close to good fishing and the price is right too. Brad, Sarg retired"

571959,Guest,2008-03-10 06:41:00,0,"I second what Reg said! We have gone the last couple years, and also stay at Snake Falls. The fishing is good for walleyes. We haven't really hit the northerns well, but we do catch a lot while fishing for walleyes. Reg...what do you guys use to catch the northerns? We go the second week of June, and the only complaint I have is at that time of year, the walleyes are usually shallow and there are parts of the lake that can get crowded with boats. There are plenty of fish to catch, but I don't really like to fish in crowds, so we usually explore less busy areas. Fishinglund"

572018,REG,2008-03-10 09:33:00,445,"Some years are better than others for the northerns. Just like any Canadian lake, look for cabbage - even cabbage that is just starting to grow - and throw the shiny stuff. All around the edges but right through it too. I like weedless silver minnows with a trailer of some sort. But we'll also catch them on daredevils and williams spoons. If you stay at Snake Falls, Rob can tell you where the best spot on the lake is for big northerns. I can't say on here, or the fleet will show up. (I suspect you already know it) We also catch our share of northerns while jigging/casting for walleyes. On the Snake Falls website - under the fishing link - the first photo is of a young lady in a light green shirt with a very large nothern - she is the daughter of our founding group member and she caught that one on a jig and 6lb test. Took her 20-30 minutes, but she got it in. We just catch and release the northerns, so we'll leave plenty for you. Rich"
572066,Guest,2008-03-11 15:15:00,0,Been going up to pakwash for about 20 yrs. Have great walleye fishing and pretty good northern fishing. We go for the opener now which can be the best walleye fishing any where if the ice goes out a couple of days before you get there. Then there is a time for the walleyes post spawn if you hit that it gets a bit tougher but still plenty of fish just not as many hawgs. Jig and a minnow time. Use to go up in mid june that was a little bit more moving around to find the fish that were active but we always caught enough. At that time we used more spinners and crawlers and had great luck with crank baits if you found an area or bay that the wind was blowing into hard for a day or so. Early northerns seem to like the bays just outside the rivers or moving water. A dead chub on a bobber and sit back take a nap and have some fun. Out of all the years we have been going up only had one really slow year and not sure if it was the weather or we were doing something wrong. We now stay at the place up the chunkin river nice people are working on fixing the place up. The best thing they ever did up there was put the slot limit into place. The fish have been getting better every year. Later Walleye fred. PS I have seen a musky caught out of that lake but only one.
572563,Guest,2008-04-01 15:01:00,0,"Been going to Pakwash for over 30 years. This is an excellent lake and great opportunity to get yourself some real quality walleye and northern. We usually go end of May or early June. Walleye fishing is very solid and Pike can be excellent as well. Most of your fishing locations will need to depend on ""ice out"" for that particular year. Early ""ice out"" dates usually equate to the walleyes being back in the main lake and most spots in the north end of the lake are holding good numbers of fish but smaller. Also pike will be relating to weed edges and deeper water. Try bays on the East side of the lake (the beach, 2nd bay, 3rd bay, clay banks) and fish the wind blown sides. If ""ice out"" is late the north end of the lake is the place to be for the big fish. Fishing at this lake continues to improve with the new limits. We stay at Pakwash Lake Camp in the middle of the lake. The new camp owners there are great! Pakwashlakecamp.com"

571935,REG,2008-03-08 17:29:00,445,"Our group has been going for quite a few years and like the lake. Good for Northern, Walleye, Perch, and Smallmouth - no Lakers or Muskies. Big enough without being too big - plenty of places to fish regardless of the wind. It can get rough out on the main lake if the wind blows hard out of the north or the south. We always stay at Snake Falls Camp - Rob and Nancy have great cabins and run a great camp. Rich"

571938,HarleyDave,2008-03-09 01:06:00,2,My brother and I have been fishing Pakwash for the past three years and I've been up once in the fall. Excellent walleye fishing. There are five or six lodges on the lake. We stay at Northwoods Bay Resort. Not fancy but reasonably priced and the owners are great. The lodge is a couple of hundred yards up the Chikuni river so high winds don't slam your rig around.
