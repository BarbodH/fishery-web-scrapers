573377,GBS,2008-05-01 21:19:00,2271,"As posted elsewhere, going Nothern Manitoba. Walleye (primarily, of course), but lake is also noted for lots of big northern, and even lake trout. For walleye I'm pretty well equipped, I think. But those northern....I've got the heavier rod and heavier line. For walleye, I'm thinking 8 lb spiderwire, for the northern rod, 20 lb spiderwire. Too much, not enough? What's the deal with leaders...I'm so confused. Steel 7 strand, titanium, flurocarbon, or ??? What pound test??? Do I need a leader when fishing walleye, just in case a bigger northern shows up? If I'm targeting northern, will the heavy duty wire eliminate any chance at a walleye?? I'm just too used to central Minn., where it is mostly snakes, and 6-8 lb spiderwire is usually tough enough to avoid bite offs, although I might have to retie. The world is different when the lake has a high percent of gators - lodge claims not at all unusual to get one a day that is over 41"", and several a day just a few inches less.....I want to be equipped right, but not go like I'm Muskie fishin'......"
573379,Guest,2008-05-02 06:40:00,0,"For a first trip I would be conservative and purchase as little tackle as possible (unless money is no problem). As a beginning I would purchase metal leaders. I have been using them and have chaught walleyes. It is possible I have not chaught as many as if the leader was not there, however, the leaders may well have saved me a bunch of cut offs. When choosing leaders I prefer ones that have the ""wire only"" (on cabela's website these snaps are called - dulock snaps) snap on the end. I have been making my own using the snaps and titanium wire."
573380,jigman 2003,2008-05-02 07:03:00,981,"I usually make a bunch of light wire leaders to use when jigging. I use the red seven strand wire, usually either 8 or 12 lb. test. Put a small barrel swivel on one end and a snap on the other. Make them about 8"" long. I only use them when the pike are really hammering my walleye setups. I have landed a number of fish that I think I would have lost without them. I'd recommend going with a high quality leader when specifically fishing for big pike. Look at Rollie and Helen's online catalog, great stuff for muskies and big pike. You could just go to your local sporting goods store and get some decent muskie leaders too. I wouldn't mess with fluorocarbon, I doubt the fish you'll be catching would be ""leader shy""."
573381,joeman79,2008-05-02 07:08:00,417,"Here's what you do. You go out and buy a soft sided tackle box that holds like 5 of those clear Plano boxes that are like 11X14. You buy 3 or 4 sizes of jigs from 1/16th oz to 1 3/8 OZ in about every color u can imagine. Which will be a couple hundred at least. Buy a couple hundred spinner blades and a 100 beads and clevises in same colors. Buy about 30 shad raps-frenzy shad-x-raps-and walleye divers at 5-7 bucks a piece. Buy 20-30 spoons for Northerns in 1/2-1 oz sizes. 300-500 twister tails in 3 and 4 inch. 10 packs of gulp leeches and minnows in assorted colors. 12 Rattlin Spots and rattlin rap and a dozen or so husky jerks and rattlin Rougues. 20 Bass type spinner baits and a dozen buzz baits. 36 bottom bouncers and a bunch of walking sinkers. 3 dozen ballbearing swivels. 36 of the best steel leaders with ballbearing swivels Cabelas sells in 25 pound. a few slip bobbers and bobber stops, a couple huge bobbers and some quick strike rigs for fishin suckers for Pike. some tiny gold hooks and tiny bobbers for catchin those suckers in little creeks coming into lake. A good quality Eagle Fish finder with gel cell battery pack in a five gallon bucket to protect it on plane. A pair of fish grabbing gloves. a Basketball net for making a fly-in anchor. YOur boat safety kit. A flat of crawlers in BUSS bedding, and a 5'6"" and 6 ft spinning rods for walleye strung with a 6# clear blue stren and an 8# Flourocarbon, and a couple of heavier 6-7 ft rods strung with a 17# mono and 50 Power pro line for pike. You get to the outfitters and guy loading plane tries to pick up your tackle boxes and has to grunt to throw it on trailer they are wieghing stuff on. Looks at you like he'd like to slap u silly. Get to lake fish for a week. And use 12 jigs and 2 spinner harnesses a 5 of diamonds spoon -1 Bass spinner bait and a Husky Jerk. ALL WEEK!! That's what I did. Lost a couple spinners and maybe 8 jigs all week. Caught TONS of fish. Maybe I bought and brought to much. One thing u do want to do is bring a couple extra rods along because someone might step in or out of the boat on those slick wet boards the boats are shoved up on and step right on a couple of brand new Fenwick HMX walleye rods and just snap them right in two. Thank God I brought 2 extras cause that did happen to one of the guys in our group the 1st DAY!!"
573383,Guest,2008-05-02 07:37:00,0,"Joeman, that is awesome... and so true. It would seem that every year, I buy hundreds of dollars of new lures, and I mostly end up using jigs, spinners (for walleye trolling) and a few daredevils, silver minnows. Usually on one day or two we go casting and I pitch about 100 different lures about 3-5 times each and then throw them back in my box wondering why I ever bought the thing. The extra pole idea is a good one. I cannot tell you the number of times we have had poles broken, shut in car doors, house doors, stepped on etc. Overall, I would say go with the idea that ""less is more"".. one of the most frustrating things when fishing all day is to be tripping over extra poles, tackle boxes, coolers, food boxes etc. in your boat."
573428,GBS,2008-05-02 19:31:00,2271,"OMG, how did you get into my house, and see what I had spread out on the kitchen table as I was ""organizing"" the tackle box??????????"
573459,pike50plus,2008-05-03 19:29:00,584,"For type of line, it depends on structure you will fish. If weeds, fireline is good, it will cut through the weeds. It is good for jigging lakers in deep water, but for jigging walleyes in rocks or wood, it will be hard to get jigs loose unless light wire bendable hooks. Mono works well in all other situations leaders- use crosslock style, preferrably ballbearing minimum 9""-12"", longer is not good for casting. 3/4-1-1/8 oz Johnson spoons, 5/diamonds 3/4-1oz. #5-6 inline spinners(plain), 1/4-3/8 jigs(white, yellow, black and chartruses), berkley power tails 3-4""(white, yellow, chartruse od multi-color of those combos), couple buzz baits(clossed eye), 5-7"" stick baits, smaller hot-n-tots or medium divers for locating and trolling for walleye, If the Lakers are shallow(top 35') then troll with inline 1-1.5oz weight( use mono leader especially if using fireline), if later in the year they may be in deep holes and you cna jig with 1-1.5 oz, roadrunners work well for this. Keep a spinning rod with a 1/2-1oz jig in the boat for pike follows, drop to them while close to the boat. A few larger plastics for pike, like shad jigs and sloggo type for off days. Mouth spreaders and long hookouts will let fish go easy. Debarb hooks for ease on you and the fish."
573463,joeman79,2008-05-04 00:42:00,417,"Just curious what type of lures do you use for Lakers when they are still shallow? We are gonna be on Red Lake 2nd week of June and as late as everything is this year, thought maybe lakers will still be shallow and would like to catch one for a picture and the expierence. Thanks and your selections for the first timer are right on! Thanks, Joe"
573466,MK,2008-05-04 08:52:00,322,"The more I go, the smaller my tackle box gets. For pike, I love those hammered gold Wabler spoons on 15 lb. line with a 12"" black titanium leader. You can cast or troll them and the pike seem to love them. This is on a St.Croix spinning rod, 7', medium heavy one-piece rod with a decent quality ($75 +/-) Shimano spincasting reel, 2500 or 4000 size. Buy the good quality titanium leaders, they're worth every penny in my mind. Small, tough, don't get twisted as badly. They cost $3-4 each but I generally only lose 2-3 in a week. Walleye rod is St.Croix, 6'6"" one piece, medium, 8 lb. line, no leader, smaller Shimano spincaster, 2000 size. Live minnows if possible on a small jig head or on a floating jig head with a small weight about 5' up the line so the jig will float off of the bottom. Tie on jig heads or use very small Sampo swivel if you plan to change often. I also take a few crank baits, large and small for both species, white and/or purple/red for the walleye and silver or gold and black for the pike. The 3-4"", walleye divers from BPS. I have better luck on long thin divers, 10-15' deep models, than the shallow and short/fat lures. Other than that, the presentation is just as important as the bait. I'd worry more about the lake location, water depth, weather, wind, waves, clouds, storm fronts, and time of day as much as the bait or tackle. Good luck and have fun."
