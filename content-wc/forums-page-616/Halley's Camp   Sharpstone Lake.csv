Its a very nice cabin at the back of a small, sandy bay in about the middle of the lake. 3 bedrooms & a nice greatroom w/large picture window facing the bay. The ""beds"" are basically large wooden shelves w/legs attached to the walls. We brought sleeping bags for bedding. Except, 3 guys forgot to bring their sleeping bags,(not me) and the pilot MADE A SPECIAL TRIP BACK (100 miles by air) to deliver sleeping bags to them. Gasoline generator outside for lights & water heater, shower, full kitchen. Running water via gravity feed from a water tank perched on a high rock nearby. Outhouse behind the cabin. Nice boats with 25hp 4-stroke motors & a dock. Sharpstone is a good sized lake. I remember riding for at least a 1/2 hour or more going from one end of the lake to the other at full throttle. We caught fish, but it took a couple of days of fishing to find them. This was a big surprise to me as I believed a wilderness lake like that would be chock full of trophies, everywhere. We had our best luck fishing near the falls where the Behrens river enters the lake. It was spring & we were the first group at the cabin that year."
