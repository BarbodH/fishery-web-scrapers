573204,Guest,2008-04-29 08:11:00,0,"I would love some insight on this one as well Walleye... I got a note from our camp owner last week that noted that spring had finally arrived in Ear Falls. They said the ice was melting and that the rivers were now open. So I would think a good rain and some 50-60 degree days will do it. We are heading up on the 23rd, so I don't expect to see any remains even by that date. We used to go opening week and I can only remember ice still on the lake like one time in over 30years... Forecast for the end of this week in ear falls is for warmer weather and rain.."

573261,Guest,2008-04-29 18:35:00,0,"I am quite sure Pakwash will be ice-free by the opener. The rivers are all open and on the north end,almost open from mouth of Trout to Snake falls. We did have a nasty storm on the weekend and dumped over a foot of snow in the area and a couple days previous to the snow we recieved an inch of rain. Maybe now we will have some run-off, as there was next to nothing in the small creeks etc to feed the lakes. As this water enters the lakes it helps greatly to warm up the water and melt ice from underneath as well as raise the level allowing the ice to move away from shore, once that happens all that is needed is a good stiff wind to start moving the ice around. Nothing great as far as temps in the forecast, warmest day for the next week is about 50, showers or flurries predicted for the weekend with a high of about 36. My guess is May 12/13 for ice out. P.S. Steve W. are you the one that had the lunker northern mounted about 3 years ago???"
573277,Guest,2008-04-30 07:28:00,0,"Yes, that was me.. We actually tried to release that fish but could never revive it. So I got it mounted. We got him off one of the rock ledges in Lost Lake. I was speaking (by e-mail) to our camp owner yesterday and they said cold nights still this week had the ice hanging on. I was told it was about 2.5ft thick but honey combed. Not safe to walk on in many places at this point. My understanding is that once a good wind/rain combination takes place with the ice like this, that it gets pushed up on shore pretty quickly. Like I say, I am heading up the 23rd so I am not too concerned about seeing any ice when I am up there. It mostly just matters to me about where the main group of walleyes is going to be when I get there. With a late Ice out there still should be some very solid fishing in the north end of the lake and in a few of the bays in Bruce Lake..."
573385,Guest,2008-05-02 07:48:00,0,"update on this topic today is that our camp owner says not much has changed this week to date. I guess about 1.5' of snow last Saturday has slowed the melting down a bit. They are saying we are looking at a minimum of an additional week plus. The ice has only broken away from shore directly around the rocky areas. Other than that it is still tight to shore at this point. Walleye, what camp are you guys staying at??"
573530,Guest,2008-05-05 17:30:00,0,Any new info on when the ice will be out. We are headed up for the opener have 3 different groups coming just need an update. Thanks
573574,Guest,2008-05-06 20:36:00,0,"Steve W.Just curious how big your lunker pike was?Been going to Snake Falls in the spring for many years and always like a BIG pike report. Thanks,Matt"
573601,Guest,2008-05-07 08:43:00,0,"22lbs 42""... It was a nice one for sure.. I have seen many bigger.. Last year our group caught and released 5 over 39"", with the largest being 42"" just under 20lbs. I am hoping with a late ice out that the big pike will be hitting hard.. I am pretty psyched at this point. Only 2 weeks from Friday!!"
