We are staying at the French River Lodge. I would love to target walleye and my friends have been before and have had good success with the pike. Thanks, LindyRigger"
573671,DonC,2008-05-08 09:09:00,93,Fish between the islands in front of the lodge for huge walleye that time of year. Harnesses over the weeds with nightcrawlers or minnows. Perhaps jig spinners with 3 inch power grubs also. Don

Slot size I think has helped...only real problem is the ones under the slot are almost too small to justify keeping to eat. Pretty much an bay or shoreline that has remenants of the summer weedbeds is good. Last year, we caught 294 pike in 3.5 days, 6 guys. Kept 3 or 4. My brother had a 9lb walleye casting for pike, and a 19lb muskie. We tend to fish tight to shore, which may account for the numbers of smaller fish, but we still had 32 that were over 22"". Can't wait to get back up there. I get to do a lot of great fishing each year, but the French River is my favorite. John"
