573472,joeman79,2008-05-04 14:01:00,417,On Red Lake 2nd week of June where do you think the Lakers will be? Will they be shallow still? Never fished for them in June. And what do you use to catch them. Always fished deep with Sonars and Jigs. Thanks for any tips or comments. 34 days and I'll be fishin. I just did archive search and found out lots of info so unless u have a specific area near Bow Narrows there is probably no need to reply. Sorry
