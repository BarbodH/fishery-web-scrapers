573384,Guest,2008-05-02 07:39:00,0,"We have beans, taters and Walleye fried in lard every night. Breakfast is Biscuits & Sausage gravy or srambled eggs and bacon with plenty of hot coffee. We eat like men and die young with clogged veins."
573386,back357,2008-05-02 07:49:00,106,"Hey Press Lake Camper, Does your call sign reference the Press Lake near Ignace? If so, do you strictly fish Press or do you venture out to some of the other lakes around the area? I fish Kukukus, Barrel, Arethusa, Flat Rock and Heathwalt. I've thought about hitting Press, but haven't done it. I'm hearing that water levels are high this year and that, as of yesterday, they still had ice on the water. Take care."
573430,Guest,2008-05-02 21:18:00,0,"Yes, we stay at and fish Press Lake. Once we get into camp - down 17 miles of bad road - we stay there for the entire week."
573432,Riceburner,2008-05-02 23:08:00,436,"Just a friendly warning about taking venison and waterfowl into Canada--we have been advised to declare it going in, or you have potential problems once IN CANADA, or if it is returned back across the border. Waterfowl need to have a wing attached for identification. In our case, commercially processed venison pepper sticks were confiscated, with a not-so-friendly warning....I'm not being critical of the border folks--I just hadn't thought of the possible concerns with bringing it back into the USA....or of having a container of wild meat at camp...."
573434,dirt,2008-05-03 03:51:00,144,"We usually have walleye every night, aside from the last night where we have pizza or steaks. We try different recipes every night so we don´t have the same thing twice. We have quite a few guys in our group that like to cook so we never have a bad meal. It seems to get better every year. 47 days to go - CAN´T WAIT!"
573451,Guest,2008-05-03 14:10:00,0,Mike: We do the jambalaya too but try adding some cajuned walleye into the mix w/ the chicken and sausage. Outstanding!
573505,jigman 2003,2008-05-05 10:52:00,981,I was unaware that bringing those items was problematic. Can anyone steer me to a Canadian site that discusses this issue? There is nothing on any of the Canadian gov. sites that I can find that says venison must be declared or not brought in.
573507,Guest,2008-05-05 11:31:00,0,Never had a problem. We've been going for 15 years.
573524,jigman 2003,2008-05-05 14:08:00,981,"Me either. Been going about as long. Never been asked about wild game, never heard that you had to bring it up without being asked."
573525,Guest,2008-05-05 14:22:00,0,I actually called the customs ofice at the border about 10 years ago and was told as long as it is for personal consumption that it was a non issue
573287,Frankm,2008-04-30 11:31:00,154,All this is making me hungry. We are going to try the big meal in the afternoon too this year. Then if we fish later we can just come in crack some cold ones and munch on all the snacks. We do other meals such a pasta and fajitas. We have our standard fish nights and always end with steak night. We also try and do a little fish every night. Someone mentioned Walleye Parmesean. We are also going to try that this year. Here is what we were thinking. Bread 3 Walleye fillets (3 people) fry in a pan with oil. Cook some pasta. Place the fillet on the pasta and cover with sauce and parmesean cheese and probably some motzarella. We have deli nearby that sells frozen homemade marinara sauce. Its very tasty and lots of garlic. Thats our plan and I'm sure will think of ways to tweak it once we eat it.
573289,Guest,2008-04-30 11:44:00,0,"FrankM ... that's pretty much how our walleye parm goes down. Make sure to use fresh parm & mozzarella ... melt the mozz over the fillets in an oven for about 2-3 minutes (keep an eye on it). We generally bake the walleye, then add the mozz at the end. Have your Pasta and marinara ready, pasta ... marinara ... walleye w/mozzarella ... finish with some fresh-grated parm. Madone!"
573291,Guest,2008-04-30 12:00:00,0,Yeah Baby :) The Walleye Parmesan will be an addition to our menu this year. Being from Wisconsin we always have some great cheeses and smoked oysters for cocktail hour.
573297,Lovetofish,2008-04-30 12:54:00,458,"One side item we like in camp is fresh cabbage grilled on the fire. Fold up a serving in foil and place on the fire grate and turn every few minutes. Grill time maybe 10-15 minutes. Before cooking and sealing foil air tight, salt and pepper cabbage to taste and add a pad of butter and a splash of water. Then throw back a few Blues and keep away. LOL"
573304,Frankm,2008-04-30 14:20:00,154,Thanks for the tips. I'm half italian so I'm with you on the fresh motz and parm.
573313,Guest,2008-04-30 19:57:00,0,"Here's a really great idea for you chefs out there. I got it from a B&B in Healy Alaska. It is ""Lightly Crusted Walleye with Lemon creme sauce"" We had it with Halibut cut thin and is almost as good with walleye. Lightly bread your fillet in a potato buds, bread crumbs, or a really fine cracker mix. I like either dried bread crumbs or instant potato flakes. Saute your filet in olive oil or veg oil and get nice and crispy, Make a basic creme sauce flavored with real lemon or lime would work also. Place filet on top of angel hair pasta or any other lighter pasta and top with Lemon creme sauce. It is Fantastic!"
573314,joeman79,2008-04-30 20:06:00,417,"I made grilled Cajun walleye over Linguini Alfredo Last summer and it was a HIT!!! And so easy. Took a store bought jar or ""4 Brothers Garlic Alfredo"" in a freezer ziploc. Put the ""Tony Schachere's Cajun Spice"" on walleye fillet drizzled with Olive Oil. Grilled on a HOT grill not Turning about 4-5 minutes maybe. Put on top of a nice bed of Linguini and alfredo sauce it was GREAT! Maybe I did flip fish once I might have. I think I had 3 or 4 ""Blue cans of Love while making supper. Either way it was fantastic and EASY!! 37 Days and this time we have someone cooking for us. Be a nice change."
573326,stevensinks,2008-05-01 07:14:00,330,Ill tell you for sure that joeman can cook.I have never doen as much eating on a fishing trip as I did last year with him.
573331,Guest,2008-05-01 08:31:00,0,"Our Canada menu is a real ""cardiologist's nightmare"" .. but oh so good. Hey it's just once a year!! In our camp some amount of fresh walleye gets cooked every night .. on saturday, sunday, tuesday, and thursday it is the main course. FYI - there are 13-14 people in our cabin, all from Iowa and Minnesota, so for fish fry nights we take along a big LP fired turkey cooking pot. We cook walleye a variety of ways and encourage everyone to share their favorite recipe - deep fried, pan fried, grilled, or baked - it's always good! Monday, wednesday, and friday nights are for main entrees other than walleye, but there is usually still a small amount of walleye cooked up as an appetizer. Monday will see everthing from chicken, spaghetti, burgers and brats. Also lots of venison in camp due to the excellent deer hunting we enjoy in Iowa and Minnesota. Last year my monday experiment was a venison pizza! I'm happy to report that one Chef-boy-ardee pizza mix, along with a pound of 100% ground venison can make the teenagers into happy campers. It was good and will be repeated this year. Our wednesday tradition is a large bone-in ham with all the fixins. A great break from the fried foods. Friday is steak night as we prepare to leave camp the next morning and all the walleye is in the freezer. Great big full course breakfasts too. With venison sausage patties. And chocolate chip pancakes with 100% real maple syrup, made by one of our fellow campers. And LOTS of bacon! Ever tried pan frying a couple walleye fillets in bacon grease? Mmmmmm! A taste combination made in heaven. The whole experience is a true ""cardiologist's nightmare"". Did I mention the favorite sandwich in the boat on those days we don't do shore lunch -- braunschweiger and velveeta with mayonaise! I hope the lipitor is working. We're only 3 weeks away!"
573337,back357,2008-05-01 09:49:00,106,"Wow, you guys are awesome. Your dishes sound fantastic.

573280,Guest,2008-04-30 08:24:00,0,"We have the advantage of going to camp with a Culinary master! He always bring a slab of ribeyes for one night, we have walleye tacos another night, and then walleye parmesan (sp?) on another night. The rest of the week we eat great meals too, just those three nights stand out every year. Needless to say, he doesn't do dishes, or fetch his own cocktail..."
573281,Guest,2008-04-30 08:59:00,0,How about sharing the recipe for the Walleye Parmesan? :)
573282,Guest,2008-04-30 09:18:00,0,"We eat fish every day. Even if we are grilling that night we will still throw fish on the bar-b-que as well with just lemon pepper or cajun seasoning for an hor'dourve. We many times make it on the lake this way as well with just and hand held fish grill. It is a great snack before the main course. On the lake one thing that is surprisingly good is a baked potato right in your campfire. Just be sure you wrap it in plenty of aluminum foil, then throw it right in your campfire. They get done pretty quickly, just squeeze them with a glove to see if they are ready or not.. Add that to whatever you are making that day. Another one that is easy and also hits the spot is hobo stew on your campfire.. Just use lean ground beef, potato's carrots and onions, other stuff if desired and then wrap in aluminum foil... again use plenty so it will not burn, when your fire is ready, add beer, salt and pepper to taste wrap it back up and put it over your fire... and this is a nice lunch (if you are not doing fish already!) The other thing nice with this one is that you can make it up in advance and you just need to bring it in a cooler and not much else is needed."
573285,Guest,2008-04-30 10:16:00,0,We eat fish every day......even have fried walleye on toast with mayo for breakfast a few days. Toss in a few shore lunch fish frys..WOW that makes a great week. Won't be long!
573286,Guest,2008-04-30 10:26:00,0,"We made the choice to move our big meal to mid-day, which as worked out nice. This year we're going Sat-Wed, and thus far are planning for homemade sheet pizza (loaded up), marinated London Broil, crockpot pork roast with sauerkraut, apples and caraway seeds; and are still waffling on the fourth meal...likely grilled chicken breast. For ""dinner"" we try to do easy prep kinds of things like roast beef on weck, tacos....that kind of thing. Where we go is mostly northerns, so we don't each as much fish as some of you do, but this year will try some bacon wrapped. For those of you that do that now, buy some pineapple chunks, cut each one in 2 pieces, putting a piece on each side of the fish and wrap that up. We sprinkle with old bay..."

We enjoy eating well but simple and find great joy in making sure we have all the ingredients we need to make gourmet wilderness chow ( without getting crazy). Venison burgers are a favorite as well as grilled lobster with a lemon and crawfish wildrice stew. Anybody have any favorite dishes to share"
573230,Guest,2008-04-29 11:28:00,0,"Pork & Beans, Peanut butter & Jelly sanwiches. we also have someone whose hobby is cooking. We have had some great meals."
573241,Guest,2008-04-29 13:17:00,0,Pork and beans is a luxury for us too.Esecially at shore lunch.Bacon is another such luxury that we don't eat at home....for obvbious reasons
573243,Guest,2008-04-29 13:25:00,0,"What obvious reasons? I eat bacon for breakfast, lunch and supper. Am I missing something? We like to make a pot of smoked sausage, green beans, red potatoes and carrots for dinner one night."
573244,Guest,2008-04-29 13:26:00,0,"Camp Chief: With a crew like that and such a menu, you ever need another wheel, let me know. We go American Plan (no chiefs in our crew), so I won't comment on the resort food (which is outstanding), but all year I look forward to the shore lunch of walleye caught within the last hour, fried, with wild rice, fried potatos, some canned peaches, a cookie and a drink. Can you say heart attack! I make the same meal here with walleye caught in Wisconsin and Iowa, but there is something that makes the meal eaten on an undeveloped shoreline on a mid-June day, something that is beyond special. I eat like a pig at lunch, fish until 6:00 PM, then eat like a pig at dinner. I come home with more than a few extra lbs and love every minute of it. 44 days to go, but who is counting....IA Walleye"
573245,Guest,2008-04-29 13:47:00,0,Where can I pick up an application for your crew? I'm a pretty fair shake in the kitchen myself; usually act as my group's quartermaster and chef de cuisine.
573247,prov1900,2008-04-29 14:05:00,544,"Bacon wrapped shrimp, bacon wrapped filet mignons, bacon wrapped anything. Washed down with lots of Molson's. We also have chili night, fish night (more than a couple). 7 days go way to fast. Breakfasts are more of a production in reality with our specialty breakfast taters."
573250,Guest,2008-04-29 14:23:00,0,I am getting hungry and ready for a cold Blue:)
573251,Guest,2008-04-29 14:48:00,0,"We have fish just about every night. Each night we try to fix it a little different. The first night is the traditional deep fried in peanut oil with breading and potato wedges in the same oil. That usually clots the arteries and loosens everything else., The next option is to grill the walleye in tin foil with lots of onions and coat everything with butter. In a seperate wrap we do the potatoes sliced and spiced with more onions and coated with butter. To stay on the healthy side, we open a can of green beans or corn if anyone wants some. Now we are talking major blockages. If anyone survives the week, the last night we break out the T-bones and rib-eye steaks. They are grilled with more onions and mushrooms with a baked potato on the grill also. For dessert we treat ourselves to a gallon of ice cream and a double dose of lipitor to head home with the next day. It's probably good I don't cook all year."
573253,dewyg,2008-04-29 15:44:00,1006,Sometimes I wrap myself in bacon and lie on the deck of my boat on really hot days. I LOVE BACON!!!!
