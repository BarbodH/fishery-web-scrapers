573552,Guest,2008-05-06 11:42:00,0,"While I have never met him, I assume it will resemble the south end of a north facing horse."
573604,Guest,2008-05-07 09:15:00,0,I saw a guy in a Pink Dress on 35W near Moundsview MN holding an NWO Bum Voodoo Doll and a sign that read Go Home Canadians....You don't suppose.........
573632,Guest,2008-05-07 14:10:00,0,You guys are killing me!!!!
573636,Mohleye,2008-05-07 15:05:00,368,You guys had better be careful....this guy is big man on the internet. He might decide to ruin you when he finishes with Canada.
573639,v-bay gord,2008-05-07 15:59:00,3168,"No worry, I think he's still working on ruining his own credibility. Just to be safe though, I've hung a cyber-donut (glazed like Greg)along my internet trail that will throw him off the Canada scent!"
573643,Guest,2008-05-07 18:07:00,0,"Greg P. is a Tard or is it Turd. Canada is better off without him or anyone who would consider themselves his ""friend"". It is nice of him to ""out"" himself as a cyber terrorist. Were it my site, he and his posts would be dust. For the record, I agree with throwing back all walleyes over 18 inches. I don't think it has anything to do with elitism, nationalism or Greg Pism, it simply makes sense if you want a future for the resource. Most of the laws and regulations in any country are designed with the ""lowest common denominator"" in mind. Those who keep too many and too large of fish, consume too many beers on the water and drive poorly have caused inconvenience to all of us."
573687,fisheagle,2008-05-08 12:16:00,44,Well said.
573441,Guest,2008-05-03 08:56:00,0,"Hello all, Going to West side of LS for the 132nd time the 7th week of July. Can someone here tell me about LS regulations. I like to eat fish, but don't take any home for fear of getting ""rolled"". Thanks in advance for answers."
573443,Guest,2008-05-03 09:38:00,0,I have a dead horse in the backyard. I will go beat it for the 63rd time and then get back to you.
573492,Mohleye,2008-05-05 08:41:00,368,"Will I need a passport? My friend got a DWI last year, will he be able to cross the border? What about potatoes? Leeches? How much booze can we bring?"
573495,Guest,2008-05-05 09:04:00,0,Maybe you two should spend some quality time with Dr Phil working on your people and hostility issues.
573498,Guest,2008-05-05 09:23:00,0,"What a coincidence. Potatoes,leeches and booze reminds me of one of my favorite Fish camp meals :)"
573499,Guest,2008-05-05 10:02:00,0,Here's what we do take 5 liters per man across the border for a 4 day trip. Leave the dock ech morning and throw the cap to the liter overboard cause we don't need that anymore. Drink all day kill everthing we catch and come back drive into town for dinner and some drinks. come back go to bed and get up the next morning to see if there are any fish still on the stringer that we hung over the side of the boat the night before. on the 5th day we leave that camp and drink that last 5th per man all the way back to the border. Have a great trip
573500,Guest,2008-05-05 10:08:00,0,one more thing if we see a Canadian Guy we shoot him the moon for being so mean to drunks on the message boards. BOOWAHAAAAA
573503,stumcfar,2008-05-05 10:32:00,451,"Make sure everyone takes one fish of at least 26"", because the rules say you can. Fillet them out and freeze in one large block of ice and then you will have no problems."
573508,Guest,2008-05-05 11:39:00,0,I just read the new regs. You can now keep one tree hugger over 60 inches and as many under as you want. You donlt have to kill them but you have to drag them behine the boat.
573544,Guest,2008-05-06 09:51:00,0,"Do any camps have rules about keeping 1 hugger over 60""????"
