You didn't say what type of info you were looking for, or even what side of the lake you are staying on, so I'll just focus on fishing in my response. The US side of the lake has some nice spots for walleye. You can jig them just below the dam at Kettle Falls for plenty of eaters. (Just be careful motoring from the main basin to the falls, follow the bouys, to stay out of the rocks!) There are some nice points and reefs out in the basin, just off of Sand Bay, and Rabbit and Smith Islands. A lot further to the east are Blue Berry and Shelleland Islands, we've got plenty of nice sized walleye off the reefs and humps near them. If you really want to travel you can go to Brulle' Island and fish off the points on any one of several dozen islands in the narrows. In mid-June I'd start looking for walleye in 18 to 24', and using jigs or rigs with leeches or minnows work good at that time of year. I think the Canadian side has better walleye and smallmouth fishing, but admit the smallmouth were a bigger draw for us, and that may be why we are biased. You'll need a Canadian license to fish that side, won't be able to use live bait unless you get it from Canada, and remote border crossing permit if you transverse from the US to Canadian side of the lake. The deeper channels between Green, Big, Big Dry and Blackpoint Islands have given us several large walleye. You'll also see several reefs on a lake map in that area that always hold active walleye, you'll easily see them on the sonar. Jig them with Gulp 3"" black leeches -- no need for live bait. Don't be afraid to work some of the island shorelines for walleye that have moved shallower. The north shoreline on the Canadian side of the lake is a superb for smallmouth. The Rat River,Cormorant, Moose and Willow Bays will likely be holding large number of smallmouth in mid-June -- if you are looking for smallmouth, these areas can keep you busy for an entire week. Work the bank by casting #3 copper or gold mepps, 3-1/2"" green pumpkin tube jigs, shad raps, topwater pop-r's and tiny torpedoes, and spinner baits to shallower rocks, weed edges, points, etc. Just pick a spot outside one of these large open bays, and work the shoreline into the bay and follow it all the way around and back out. Here's the link to a general map that provides some info on that section of the lake:http://www.nps.gov/voya/planyourvisi...ousMap2006.pdf Chuck"

We have been going to this area for the last several years. Just wanted to see if anyone has been fishing in this area. Thanks, Pathfinder"
