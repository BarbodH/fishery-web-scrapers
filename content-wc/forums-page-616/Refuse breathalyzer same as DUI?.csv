573545,Flip Silverlake,2008-05-06 09:52:00,645,If as you say it's an illness then there needs to be a process put in place to make sure that anyone with this illness can drive a vehicle in a safe mannor. The vast majority of the DUI cases here are not because of that illness. It's caused by shear stupidity. I will not accept loosing a loved one becasue of someone elses illness when it could have been prevented.
573548,Guest,2008-05-06 11:01:00,0,"Flip, I am in total agreement with you. As a dad with teenagers, a breathalizer in every car would be just fine with me. If you have alcohol on your breath your car won't start. Your state would be a good place to start since close to 70% of vehicle accidents are alcohol related. JohnB.O.A.T."
573551,Flip Silverlake,2008-05-06 11:20:00,645,"Thank you, I agree on the breath to start!"
573555,AllenW,2008-05-06 12:03:00,11482,">Thank you, I agree on the breath to start! I'd agree on convicted DUI people, but I'd rather not pay the extra expense when neither of us in the family drink and drive, I'd doubt these are cheap. You might call it a illness, but I'd call it irresponsible escaping from the real world. Either way, the punishment is still way to lenient in many states, witness drivers with 10-12 DUI's, see it here in Minn anyway. They may need help, but firstly we need to keep them off the road. My brother run into another car while he and the other driver both were drunk, he died, they didn't. This was the other drivers second DUI, and I believe my brothers second one too, maybe if the punishment was enough that major jail time was involved, his kids might have a father today, not sure, but maybe. just a thought.

573556,Guest,2008-05-06 12:30:00,0,"Breathalyzer is about $60.00/ month and are a real pain in the neck. You don't just blow into them like a ballon you have to have a special ""tone"", no tone no start. Then every 20 minutes you get to blow again and if you have booze on your breath you get reported or if you don't blow you get reported. The car doesn't simply turn off. So while it seems like a good idea for the general public it's not workable. Maybe a better idea is if the drunk driver does damage or injury on the 2nd or thrid offens the judge that gave the light sentnce can be held responsible. Maybe if the Dram Shop laws were tougher then the bar owners that served the guy could pay up."
573572,Guest,2008-05-06 18:36:00,0,Easy to fix if there is a will. In Sweden they have a sliding scale. You automatically go to jail for a year. If you blow over .2 you go for two.
573483,Guest,2008-05-05 05:31:00,0,Thanks for that. I don't think that convicted impaired or DUI drivers are the mainstay for our tourism industry that many posters allude to here. They are however among the most vocal potential tourists. Wonder if there is a connection between the two .................that is being vocal and having a conviction for DUI.
573486,AllenW,2008-05-05 06:52:00,11482,">Thanks for that. I don't think that convicted impaired or >DUI drivers are the mainstay for our tourism industry that >many posters allude to here.

If I'm missing something here, forgive me, but doesn't it make sense that those that are vocal about it are those that have a DUI on their records, also possibly those that want to fish with some one who has a conviction? All for it btw, lost my brother to a drunk driver, unfortunately brother was drunk also, left a wife and two kids because he drank and drove, also have a longer list than I care to think about of people I knew that were killed either drunk driving or by a drunk. While shooting them on site is unrealistic, the laws here in Minn at least, are far to lenient, somethings wrong when people are getting 7 and 8 DUI's in a few year period. Just wondering, does any felony restrict your axcess to Canada or just DUI? Can't quite remember what they all ask when you try and cross the border. Al"
573487,Roger Benoit,2008-05-05 07:10:00,93,"http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/informa...des/5312E3.asp From what I have read, If the crime/conviction you had would have been a crime in Canada, then you have the same restrictions as a DUI/DWI..."
573490,MK,2008-05-05 07:31:00,322,"I think its the criminal record as opposed to the specific charge of DUI. The same as the US refuses entry to Canadians that have misdemeanor drug charges up there. The US generally charges first time DUI as misdemeanors and Canada charges many of their drug users as misdemeanors. In both cases, the other country considers them as felonies and may refuse entry. Americans drug of choice is alcohol and Canadians have marijuana as theirs. American cops love to enforce drug laws and Canadian cops love to enforce alcohol laws. The users tend to gravitate to the areas of least consequences. The border patrol and immigration services have their own opinions on the matter and they control (are supposed to control) the borders."
573496,AllenW,2008-05-05 09:13:00,11482,"Thanks, I wasn't sure if they were keying off just the DUI or total criminal record. Al"
573497,Guest,2008-05-05 09:21:00,0,I'm confused maybe Canadian guy can help me is it just the convicted drunks you don't want or any drunks? Or the convicted drunk driver. You would probably have less trouble with a person convicted then the drunk that hasn't been caught yet. The convicted has probably gone thru some type of class or treatment and is less likley to drive drunk again then those that haven't been caught yet. I've been to Canada and I doubt all that booze being sold at the beer store and the liquor store is being bought by US tourist. Get down off the soap box. I think people that made a mistake and drove with to much to drink that have paid their debt to society beleive that they are being treated unfairly by being denied access to Canada to go on a vacation. That's why they are vocal. I happen to agree with them. It may be fair or unfair but that's the way it is to bad it hurts the tourist trade. The loss of 12 guests for a week would put a crimp in the profit margin of most small fishing camps.
573502,Guest,2008-05-05 10:30:00,0,"Very well said confused or drunk in your statement. If the laws are clear to into Canada, why do so many people ask and inquire about it with having a DUI? Cant be that easy to figure out. If they are clear, please state it down exactly so we all know for the future when another person asks so we know what to tell them. There ought to be a better way the border handles this issue than what they are now?"
573534,Guest,2008-05-05 19:33:00,0,They have a hard time figuring it out because a lot of people still don't view drinking and driving as a real crime. It's considered more of a traffic violation than what it really is.....Flagrant disregard for the safety of others. They should rename the offence to .......Flagrant disregard for the safety of others. Then it might sink in. http://www.alcoholalert.com/drunk-dr...tatistics.html Our officers have no tolerance for impaired drivers or boaters.
573537,Flip Silverlake,2008-05-05 21:15:00,645,"I live in the state of Wisconsin. Just this month there was a rear end colision between a driver that was under the influence and a family. The driver that was ""stoned"" killed 3 people in the car. Two died on impact and one later in the hosiptal. The mother was expecting a baby at the time. The driver that hit the family was driving on a revoked license after having 3 DUI convictions. He stands to serve, ""if convicted"" something like 150 years in prison. He stated to the press that he was ""sorry"" that it happened. I have talked to law enforcment folks and they all feel that if there was a reason for capitol punishment this would be a good one. When are we going to get it through our heads that there is no differance between a 5100 pound car and a 115 grain bullet! In Wisconsin we are not permitted to carry a concealed firearm but our courts will permit people to drive after they have been convicted more than once to drive. It makes no reasonable sence ! The car the drunk was driving was a 5100 pound full size SUV, he hit the family at a speed in excess of 60 mph at a stop sign. The Suv went over the top of the car and crushed it. IF YOUR GOING TO DRIVE KEEP YOUR NOSE OUT OF THE JUG. I class these people no different than someone who pulls a trigger and kills a fellow human. If you (being U.S) really love your fishing in Canada it should then be a great enough driver to stay out of the joy juice if your going to get behind the wheel. If not may be some long term JAIL time is in order."
573541,Guest,2008-05-06 07:38:00,0,"In NO WAY am I implying that drunk driving is not a serious matter. But remember this: Alcholism is a DISEASE. People are not drunks just because they want to be. Do you think they like to drink their way out of their jobs, house, marriages, families? It's a Disease that some people's bodies just can't shake. For those that are not alcholics, thank God you did not get the genes that cause this dreadfull sickness. They don't need to be looked down on, they need to be helped. It's a crying shame when families or loved ones die in an accident, whether the driver has been drinking or not. Again, I know the percent of alcohol related accidents are WAY to high and wish there was a cure for the problem. We need to quicker to reach out our hands to help instead of throwing out our fists. Reform an alcholic, the life you save (besides his) might be your own. BTW I am not an alcholic and have not had a DUI. JohnB.O.A.T."
573382,Guest,2008-05-02 07:14:00,0,"A friend of mine (no ... really) got pinched this winter, but refused the breathalyzer test. Pretty much got the same fine and suspension of license as a DUI, but we're wondering if this is treated the same as a DUI for border crossing? Sorry if this came up before, I'm a little challenged when it comes to searching for old posts, and computers in general. Thanks for the advice."
573387,Guest,2008-05-02 08:03:00,0,Yes it is treated the same
573392,Guest,2008-05-02 09:02:00,0,"It is called ""Implied consent"", treated the same as DUI."
573393,Guest,2008-05-02 09:10:00,0,"I know in Alabama, by refusing you automatically lose your license for 30 days. But unless you are convicted of a DUI you can't end up with DUI on yor record."
573461,Guest,2008-05-03 22:48:00,0,I dont want to start something but drunks if they take the test or not should be more harshly penalized. they should loose their driving priveledges for a year if not longer. We just had a drunk driver out here kill 5 people and injure 3 more. he got 15 to 45 years and he is 20 years old. probably should have been executed. drunk driving is murder. I dont know how people can make light of it. the next time you drive drunk pretend you just killed your own family.
573464,Guest,2008-05-04 07:34:00,0,I think the cops should be able to execute them at the scene of the stop if they fail the breathalyzer test. Same for people that miss a red light and get into an accident an kill someone even ifthey aren't drunk. Those that are almost legally drunk should have a limb removed.
573465,Guest,2008-05-04 08:34:00,0,">I think the cops should be able to execute them at the scene >of the stop if they fail the breathalyzer test. Same for >people that miss a red light and get into an accident an kill >someone even ifthey aren't drunk. Those that are almost >legally drunk should have a limb removed. They should probably chop of the feet of speeders so they can't push the gas pedal so hard. And while there at it, I wish they'd rip the lungs out of people that smoke in no-smoking areas. And don't even get me started on the jaywalkers.:) But back to the original question...It depends on the state. In some states you'll get the same penalty as DUI but it shows up on your record as Breath Test Refusal not DUI. I don't see how you can have a conviction for DUI on your record if you haven't been convicted or plead guilty to DUI. You'll have to check with Canada immigration to see how they classify the crime. If they consider it a felony for BTR, then the offender probably can't get in without fees and paperwork, if at all. I sat on a jury once for a man that refused a breath test and was arrested for DUI."
573473,Obabikon,2008-05-04 15:54:00,2370,"It's iffy if you check. A friend of mine called to ask if his dui was on record (it happened just before they started enforcing it), to see if he needed to do anything. They ran his name, said no, but it is now! LOL... he has to find the arresting officer to sign off on something saying he's rehabilitated. I'm not for drinking and driving in the least, but I think it's hurt the tourism industry by a TON. A group of 12 guys, one of them has a DUI, and instead of splitting up the group, they fish in Northern Minnesota."
573477,Guest,2008-05-04 18:44:00,0,We don't want convicted drunks in Canada.....The law is clear on the policies and procedures for getting in with a conviction. Our laws are being stiffened further as we speak. 2nd convictions now mean vehicle forfeiture and a minimum jail sentence. If injury is involved you will go to jail for a long time. The rumour is that we are going down to .05 for legal drunk charges.
573479,Obabikon,2008-05-04 21:01:00,2370,"I understand that, and have very little sympathy for people who drive under the influence. However, it can drastically affect those in the resort/tourism industry."
