Happened to a guy at work, they showed up with everything they figured they needed, including probably the kitchen sink, they did leave things like the wife's hair dryer at the base camp, cabin had no electricity..:) Just a thought.

I booked with Brace Lake Outfitters which is a Fly In out of Nakina Ontario and it is under new ownership. They offered me a deal I couldn't refuse. I am not sure what your price range is but it was a lot cheaper than most of the fly-ins out of Nakina. I couldn't beat it for my price range. Check them out at http://www.bracelakeoutfitters.com He mentioned in our telephone conversation that it's an introductory price to get the new business up an running.
573264,Goldeneagle,2008-04-29 19:47:00,78,"I know of a possible good opening for two people (small cabin) for the May 17 week. It's a reasonably priced fly in with outstanding numbers of small to medium walleyes and plenty of huge pike. E-mail me if this fits. I'd need to make a call to find out if it's still available, but I need to call anyway. May and June seem to be filled at most good camps, but I anticipate lots of openings for July & August. Those are good fishing months, but it's family time and Dad may not be able to handle fuel costs plus paying for a whole family."
573376,GBS,2008-05-01 21:02:00,2271,"You also might want to do a search for Kabeelo lodge. They have a main lodge with American Plan, and fly out camps departing from the lodge. If you want, they will supply all the food items for the flyout camp - no shopping for you. You can mix and match how you want - 3 days in the lodge, 3-4 days at your own lake, etc. Just one or the other. Rates are very reasonable. They had several openings for 2 about a month ago (which for a flyout camp can be a hard number, most like a minimum of 4). They will be my next Canadian trip. This year we're spending more $$$$ going fancier all American plan in northern Manitoba for our first ever Canadian adventure."
573469,Goldeneagle,2008-05-04 12:19:00,78,"ASU, what do you think of the responses to your request?"
573058,Guest,2008-04-23 06:40:00,0,I know it is late but i would like to take my better half to Canada for a fly in for walleyes and Pike. Just 2 of us. How do I go about finding a place that won't break the bank?? I have been once with a group of 7 but don't have as many friends now. Several are fishing that honey hole in the sky. I hear that many places aren't booked fully . Might make it easier. Thanks.

I have used them 11 times. Great fishing, people, and $$$$$. I have maps of several of thei lakes. Will mail to you if you decide to use them. www.awonakina.com:bowdown:"
573063,jigman 2003,2008-04-23 10:25:00,981,"Mattice Lake Outfitters have several camps they will fly a party of two into. If they have openings later in the summer, they will oftentimes fly a party of two in rather than lose a booking completely (even to a lake where they have a higher minimum party). Great people. www.matticelake.com"
