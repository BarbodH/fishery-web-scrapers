573485,JDP,2008-05-05 06:46:00,1457,"Yes, it is a PassPort Card...here's a link:http://travel.state.gov/passport/ppt...card_3926.html I believe applications have been accepted since February. The first cards will be issued June/July (due to equipment aquisition, etc). JDP"

573102,Guest,2008-04-25 10:17:00,0,I know this has been on here before but do you need a passport this year or not?
573103,Jimmy Jig,2008-04-25 11:48:00,1905,"NO, NO, NO!"
573105,Guest,2008-04-25 12:19:00,0,Just to cause trouble. What if he's flying?

573150,Guest,2008-04-27 13:53:00,0,"Ten days ago my wife and two kids went down to the US post office, had their photos taken at the post office and applied for passports and they have already recieved them back in the mail. It's an almost painless process and very fast......"
573433,1shooter,2008-05-02 23:55:00,1493,is it a requirement this year or not?
573436,wishinfishin,2008-05-03 06:41:00,6,Is there some way to make this information stay at the top of this page like the DUI? Passports are NOT required for DRIVING across the US/CANADA border this year. You must have a photo ID and a birth certificate. Here's a link to Homeland Security's website: http://www.dhs.gov/xtrvlsec/crossingborders/
573448,Guest,2008-05-03 12:27:00,0,"I'm going back to Ontario this year for a family fly-in. In 2006 we did not need passports. Yes, you need passports!!! for 2008 My son & myself both applied for passports in April(we're in Wisconsin) For Wsiconsin you had to do the following: 1)You can have pictures taken at the Post Office for $15 each or you can go to Walgreens and have them done for $8.00 You need 2 ea 2 inch square pictures. 2) Cost was $75 each for the passports and about $32 for the Post office paperwork and mailing to ""passport"" central 3) You need to go to the Post offcie & get the forms and fill out & then make a reservation to apply at the Post Office. 4) You need birth certificates and a driver license You swear yourself in and sign with the POst offcie people watching 5) They say 4-6 weeks, we got ours back in 2 weeks. Pretty painless Jeff ps: there is a Card Passport you can get for $35, but you can use it only when driving across vs the Passport is universal. The Same application process applies"
573467,wishinfishin,2008-05-04 09:22:00,6,"I'm sorry Jeff, but you're just plain WRONG. Go to the website of US Homeland Security and click on ""Travel to Bermuda, Canada, the Carribean or Mexico for US Citizens."" For AIR TRAVEL, you must have a passport. For LAND AND SEA TRAVEL (this means driving across the US/Canada border) a passport is NOT YET A REQUIREMENT. If you do not have a passport, and you are DRIVING across the US/CANADA border you must present a photo identification card and birth certificate....and there is a complete list of what photo id's and birth certificates are accepted at a link that is provided. CAN WE PLEASE GET THIS STRAIGHT???? There's no doubt in my mind that one of the things hampering tourism is the constant and unnecessary misinformation about this issue. It's all there in black and white to read."
