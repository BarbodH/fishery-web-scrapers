540460,doubleheader,2004-06-09 05:48:00,2652,"this is probably too late, but my family has stayed at Lakair Lodge for years. we love it. the walleye fishing is good if you work at it. the muskie fishing can be fantastic, bass is great. you probably already know this. the lodge is very accessible, the cottages are clean,the Cameron's are wonderful hosts, they offer a really nice dining area looking out on the lake. regards doubleheader"

I THINK YOU SHOULD RESEARCH FACTS PRIOR TO JUDGEMENT. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND STAYING AT LAKAIR. P.S. THE FISHING IS AWESOME, IF YOU KNOW HOW TO FISH!!!"
538101,Guest,2004-03-11 09:54:00,0,"Try Memquisit Lodge on the West Bay. Easy access to fishing the West Arm thru the Gannon Narrows and also access to great fishing in the bay. Have been going to Memquisit for a number of years at the end of May, beginning of June for a number of years with a bunch of fishing buddies. We rent cabins 1-3 and 3A and have nicknamed the area as The Rock. Peninsula is only accesible to main lodge by boat or walk bridge. Service at Memquisit is exceptional. They are in the process of updating their cabins. Two of the cabins we stay in have been redone in all natural pine with new appliances. They have a web site, think it is memquisit.com. Do a search and I am sure you can find it. Talk to Frank and tell him the guys from Buffalo, NY sent you. Tom"
538172,Guest,2004-03-15 11:50:00,0,"what resort did you end up with Pete? I called Lakair to book a spot for the last two weeks of June and they welcomed me with open arms,were you planning for a tent site or a cabin? who did you speak to up there? seems weird they would not want your business, your money is as good as mine."
538177,polaris-pete,2004-03-15 17:01:00,343,"Tom- thanks for the reply.We had already found another lodge in the area-Welcome Lodge.Seems like very nice people and after a few other fishermen e mailed me we think we made the right choice over Lakair.I was at the Hamburg show yesterday and met the people from Memquisit Lodge. They too very really nice and when the lady asked me where we had booked, I told her and she said its a really nice lodge also.Her and her husband invited us over for a tour and a coffee when we have a chance in June. I think we will look them over also while we are there.Good to hear not all lodge owners are so hungry for money they have to bad mouth other lodges.After we couldn't get in at Lakair ( maybe for the better!!)i called another couple places in the area and the 1 lodge guy ( won't mention his name) when I asked him if he could reccomend any others he said NO! He was the BEST!!! Talk about high strung! I don't judge until I have actually been at one or the other. Well thanks again. Good luck fishing this Summer. Pete"
538178,polaris-pete,2004-03-15 17:12:00,343,"Silent Sam- good to hear you got in there.We needed a 2 bedroom for the first week in June.I had been talking to him for 3 days, with the owner.I had told him we were defintely going to book there but had to get the work days straightened out for my son inlaw.He just couldn't wait and rented them out without even the courtesy of an e mail telling me this! May be for the better as I got a couple e mails from others who have been there and they weren't going back again. I don't want to say what they said as I don't judge any of the places until I have been there and stayed. While at the Hamburg NY sports show yesterday, I talked to another lodge owner in the same vicinity and told them what happened and she said, the place we booked at ( WELCOME LODGE) is a very nice place and the couple who own it treat their customers great.Told us to come over and visit them on an off fishing day for a tour of their lodge ( MEMQUISIT LODGE)Supposedly nice cottages and docks.After talking to the owner seem to think shes a good lady to stay with.Well, good luck and let us know how it went. Pete"
538184,Guest,2004-03-16 07:03:00,0,"Hey Pete, To funny that we are both from Western New York. I live in South Cheektowaga, right on the Lancaster border. Went to the Outdoor's show on Sunday with my two boys and was surprised to see Memquisit as well as many other outfitter's from the West Bay, West arm of Nipissing. We actually stayed at Welcome lodge the first year we went to Nipissing. Very clean cottages that are right on the water with private docks. Owners are very nice people as well and very accomodating. We switched to Memquisit the following year because of the variety of fishing the west bay of the main lake had to offer as well as a short access point to the West Arm. If you get a chance take a ride through the narrows and check out Memquisit. Frank and Denis have done a great job since taking over management a few years ago. Place used to be owned by an ederly women, Jeanne Trivett whom passed away. Her dad built the place I think back in the 1930's. I have a group of friends going up starting June 5th in cabins 1,2 and 3. I am not attending this year, have an opportunity for a fly in to the Guoin Reservoir in Quebec the third wek in June. I think you have made a wise choice on not booking Lakair. Passed the place a few times when going to the West Arm. Didn't really impress me. If you need any tips on fishing areas, I would be more than willing to help you. Do you ever frequent the liqour store in Youngstown? Know one of the owner's, great people."
538185,polaris-pete,2004-03-16 08:14:00,343,"TOM- yes small world this western NY is.I don't know why I go to the show every year as its the same thing year after year.I see that many of the ohter lodges we have gone to in the past don't do the shows anymore as the internet has been better for them and alot less costly and time consuming. Yes I am in the store in Youngstown on occasions.When I moved off the lake into this house they were good to us saving alot of cardboard boxes for us for the move.Hope you have a good time in Quebec.Gouin is supposed to be pretty nice.We fish another couple lodges up there but this year time is a factor, not for me as Im retired but for my son inlaw.We are going to stop at Memquisit for a tour.As for the fishing out of Welcome Lodge-send me an e-mail as I don't want to tie up this thread with that.Would appreciate any info. E mail me at [email protected] Looking forward to hearing from you. Thanks, Pete"
538186,Guest,2004-03-16 08:21:00,0,"Pete, I'm not sure what happened at Lakair but my guess is that it's a misunderstanding. Lakair is a quality place run by conscientious, good people. I've never hear anything negative about the place. I've been there once, only for a long weekend, and it was fine. As for the convention, there's a big group of guys who go there every June for a long weekend. It's an open invite but you can't please everyone. The backdoor comment was uncalled for and a result of hostility. Anyway, enjoy your trip. Some year, give the Upper French River a shot."
538187,polaris-pete,2004-03-16 08:33:00,343,"Marty- thanks for the reply.Yes it may have been an misunderstanding but not on my part!! As I said before, the least he could have done is let me know that there was another party interested in that time frame.Also I did say I don't judge other places UNTIL I have been there personally.I have never been at Lakair but a few others who have been there contacted me and told me about it.But as always, there are those who don't like anywheres they go!!"

537708,polaris-pete,2004-02-25 17:58:00,343,"We are planning a June trip to the West Arm area of Lake Nippissing, Ontario.Just wondering if anyone here has fished up in that vicinity and could give us the good lodges to stay with and the bad ones to stay away from.This is our first time up in that area and would appreciate some honest replies. Thanks in advance. Pete"
537746,Ruddiger,2004-02-26 18:45:00,649,"I have a friend who owns a lodge on Pigeon Lake in Ontario. Having done sports shows for almost 20 years he has been able to meet a wide variet of reputable (and fly by night)outfitters. On occasion some of his customers who like to fish for pike (Pigeon does not have any)ask him if he can reccomend a good lake and resort in the area of eastern Ontario that they can go to. He usually sends them to West Arm Lodge on Lake Nippising. While I have never been there, I have talked to a number of people who are very satisfied with the accomodations and the ownership. They rave about the pike fishing, especially for NUMBERS! I did fish out of South Bay near Powason about 11 years ago and found the fishing to be OK. I am sure I would do a lot better now than I did then. Either way, if you go for pike, you really have to fish through a lot of smaller fish to eventually get into bigger critters. I'm sorry that I can't give you a lot of info on the walleye. I know this is not first hand info on the west arm of the lake, bu I hope that it helps. Good Luck!"
