519616,Guest,2002-04-29 09:11:00,0,"hi, I've guided on the river for three years in the past and I have beenguiding for 11 years now and the english river is the best water i've been on for numbers with some big fish thrown in. Would you like a guide to go with you I wouldn't charge that much even if it was just for a day cause its not that far of a drive for me. call me at (807)274-4934 or email me at [email protected]"
519617,Guest,2002-04-29 15:48:00,0,"Harvey, will the walleyes be spawning or will they be done at this time of year? What depth would you recommend? How about lake trout? We will be going without a guide, but your offer is greatly appreciated. Thanks Yukon"
519618,Guest,2002-05-05 05:45:00,0,"Yukon, walleye's will be done spawnig by then but try up at Maynard Falls and try some rip jigging in about 20 to 30 ft. just on the right side of the falls. there is no lake trout in the english river but if you goto maynard falls, just go straight west from there about a mile and theres a lake called Dumpy lake and theres lakers there just troll some crank baits or spinners wath sucker meat."
519619,Guest,2002-05-06 11:00:00,0,"Lakers in the english river system??? Harvey were is dumpy lake from seperation lake? Better yet were is it from lount lake? I have never heard of lakers in there? Have you heard of big fox, little fox lake? Or shoe lake? The first and second week in june with the weather as it is now is setting up to be perfect timing for that area of canada! The walleye should have been done spawning for 2 weeks! I predict for that area they will be done spawning about the 20th."
