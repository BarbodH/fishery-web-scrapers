553662,clemento,2006-01-07 10:24:00,48,I know this has been addressed before but can anybody give me a definite answer. Will a passport be needed this summer to cross the border into Canada and upon return to the US?
553663,Guest,2006-01-07 10:55:00,0,NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT!
553664,Guest,2006-01-07 11:48:00,0,"getting into canada is not the issue, it's getting back to the usa. think some bureaucrats in homeland security got carried away with regulations. believe bush got wind of it and put the brakes on them. maybe some day, but not in the near future."
553665,Guest,2006-01-07 12:17:00,0,"No. If anyone on the US side asks you for a passport, call them on it. Most are not, but some US customs agents are on some kind of power trip and can be real jerks."

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is working with Canadian officials to develop a new, alternative cross-border identification card that would satisfy security requirements but also would be cheaper and easier to obtain than a passport, a U.S. spokesperson said yesterday. ""An alternative card would be lower in cost and would be easier to carry - it would be wallet sized - for people who don't want to pay the fee for a passport,"" Homeland Security spokesperson Jarrod Agen said. ""That's something we are examining now."" ""We're working on this with the Canadian government. ""We would administer a card for our citizens, and the Canadian government would work with us to see what they could do (for Canadians)."" As part of a post-9/11 effort to tighten its borders, the United States announced in April plans to demand passports - or any similar document showing proof of identity and citizenship - from both U.S. and Canadian citizens entering the United States from other parts of North America. Canadians can now enter the United States by air, sea or land with only a driver's licence or birth certificate. But U.S. officials have said customs agents have difficulty spotting a fraudulent driver's licence because the licences are issued in a variety of forms and are easier to falsify than a passport. A driver's licence also doesn't prove citizenship. The United States had said it would impose passport checks on all Canadians entering the United States at air and sea ports by Dec. 31, 2006, and at land crossings by Dec. 31, 2007. That announcement was met with a hail of protest from business groups and governments on both sides of the border, which said it would clog already crowded crossings and seriously harm cross-border trade and tourism. Opponents of the plan say a majority of U.S. and Canadian citizens do not have passports. Yesterday, the agency spokesperson said the U.S. government is not shelving its demand for increased security at U.S. entry points, but it is looking for new ways to satisfy that demand outside the use of passports. Exactly what a new border crossing ID card might look like isn't clear. The document might resemble the recently instituted Nexus card - a pre-approved ID system jointly administered by the United States and Canada - to speed access for travellers at some U.S.-Canada border points. Canadian and U.S. authorities might simply expand the Nexus program, which requires users to undergo background checks and have personal, biometric information placed on specialized travel cards. Or officials might create a new border card that would cost about half the $100 (U.S.) fee of a U.S. passport. If the alternative card goes ahead, it's not clear whether separate documents would be issued to Canadian citizens, or if Canada and the United States would jointly administer an ID system. A Foreign Affairs spokesperson in Ottawa said yesterday while Canada is working with U.S. officials on the issue, no decisions have been made about what kind of document might be available to Canadians in the future.
