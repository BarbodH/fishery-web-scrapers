553536,Guest,2005-12-30 10:46:00,0,Does anyone have any experience with crappie on LOTW this time of year. Have they typically spawned by them? We have never been in early June and would like to catch a few. Thanks
553551,Guest,2005-12-31 10:53:00,0,"I think you might be a little late if you target them in June. I don't have alot of experience but from what I have seen and heard, you should be going after them in May. I usually go the second week in June and at that time the crappies are hard to find and the big catches have already happend. Wingmann"
553559,PJM,2006-01-01 00:18:00,3516,"Wingmann I fish up there a lot and have caught crappies in June but it all depends on the water temp and the just finding them. About June 18th a couple of years ago we where in Miles bay in the Thompson Creek area around 5:30p and I look down at my locator and saw a school of fish the we chased around for about hour in a half and picked up some nice crappies and some had spawn in them. The next day nothing, so you just have to find them...."
553561,Guest,2006-01-01 07:08:00,0,"Guy: Thanks, we are going June 3-10 and was hoping to bring a few home. From what the resort owner said Sept is usually when his crappie fishermen come and said the spring(as you mentioned) really depends on the weather. He said we shoud be able to find some then if we are willing to spend some time looking. We are looking forward to our trip and thank you both for the responses and good luck."
553562,Guest,2006-01-01 07:09:00,0,"Hi PJM. Like I said, I don't have much experience with the crappies but have been told that you would have better luck earlier in the year. Since you have a good amount of experience with them maybe you could pass along some advice (areas, structure, tackle, bait, water temps, etc.) to help the above person put a few in the boat and have a fun fishing trip. Wingmann"
553614,Ia Walihntr,2006-01-03 21:02:00,320,"Hoosier, We fish Tug Channel area during the walleye opener every year.(opener is third saturday every may) Under normal water temps for that time, 50 degrees ave., the crappies are 18 to 25 feet near the entrance to spawning bays. Cooler temps mean crappies are in the deeper water toward 25 feet. Warmer temps mean fish are in shallower water toward 18 feet. The warmest opener temp that I remember since 89 was about 58-60 degrees. The crappies were in 10 to 14 FOW when we went home. In that bay there was no cover and was told that when they do spawn they were in 4 to 6 feet. With this in mind, I would think most years the crappies may be still spawning into June. Whitefish Bay may be later since the water is so clear. Whitefish water will not warm as quickly as the waters in Sabaskong Bay or the western portion of LOTW. Marv"
553618,Bill Krejca,2006-01-04 09:01:00,6107,"The water temperature really seems to be the key ingredient to successful crappie getting in the spring. It also helps if crapppie are in the area being fished. Its been my observation in fishing LOW for crappies that they do not all spawn at exactly the same time, so a little tolerance to timing may be acceptable. The spring air temperatures dictate warming of the water, and getting into crappies shallow may vary considerably from year to year. In shallower waters (that warm faster), May spawning is usually normal. In deeper, cooler waters, such as Whitefish, the spawn may occur later, although long stretches of shallow water in Whitefish tend to replicate earlier spawning patterns, like in Sabaskong. In general, a small plateau of crappie pleasing (lots of sticks, some shade) shallow water adjacent to deep water, or a spring, may contain spawning crappies, long after the spawn in warmer, shallower parts of the lake is over. At least, that's been my experience. Let us know how you do."
553619,Guest,2006-01-04 10:51:00,0,Guys: Thank You. I knew the guys on W/C would help get me pointed in the right direction. We have done a little crappie fishing over the years and are basically bobber/minnow fishermen for crappie. The bad news is that it is still 5mo away. The neatest thing is getting to spend a week with my father doing what we both love to do....until my grandkids get a little older. Thank You all!!! I have only been 2 yrs and don't have much experience but I would be happy to help if I can??
