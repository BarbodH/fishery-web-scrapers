553617,Dave Q,2006-01-04 08:05:00,1003,As a semi. local I will say fishing CAN be good or it can be VERY VERY slow ( like most fishing) The eyes can be big. hope to get one over 9-10 in a 3-4 day trip. Some times none... some times....... :) The large pike fishing is more consistent. The lake (resivor) is BIG and BAD!! lots of standing wood!!!.
