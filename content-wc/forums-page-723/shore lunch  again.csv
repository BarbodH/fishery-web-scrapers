553560,Guest,2006-01-01 06:54:00,0,geting close to june. so what is it to make the best shore lunch
553580,Guest,2006-01-02 07:39:00,0,"#1 First naturally some fish. Walleye is probably the #1 but I prefer personally a nice 5lb pike. 100% boneless. I know how to do that and we all should learn. #2 cracker crumbs #3 a tin of evaporated milk #4 an egg maybe 2 #5 Many will object here, but I still use LARD. #6 Large frying pan and an open fire on a secluded shoreline on whatever lake or river or pond. #7 Mix egg and milk #8 dip fillets in egg/milk mix then cover with cracker crumbs. #9 place ""what was skin side down"" in the hot lard (to prevent curling) and turn over once or twice until both sides are golden btown. Prior to the above, you have already done the fries and covered to keep warm, opened the beans and whatever else you take with you. Start eating. baked- once again fillets of your choice. Place on tin foil. Add a little butter or marg. Add in thinly sliced potato's, green pepper, red pepper (rings) and onion rings (on the top of the fillets. Salt pepper to your taste. Wrap tighly in tin foil. Place in the HOT COALS.!! Not flames. Depending on the heat from the coals this might take tops 20 min for everything to be cooked . Open every now and then, just to ck the spuds. Serve right from the foil."
553583,jerry bark,2006-01-02 08:43:00,822,"try this: Fish tacos bring along in ziplocks: lettuce cheese tomatoes jalapenos if you like them 1 Tbls of taco seasoning mix plus: tortillas, flour or corn your preference (corn will need to be cooked so bring an extra skillet) bottle of taco sauce if desired, or swipe a few extra packets from taco bell on the ride up to camp tub of sour cream in the cooler filet some fish and cut into chunks, simmer fish in a bit of water until nearly done and add the taco seasoning mix. stir until all is coated breaking up the fish a bit in the process. simmer until a sauce begins to form. serve up! the key is not to add too much taco seasoning, you want the fish to still taste like fish. if in doubt use less that you think. a friend like to make fish stew by simmering fish chunks and then adding an assortment of canned veggies and canned soup. he likes canned tomatoes and potato soup particularly well. cheers jerry"
553584,Guest,2006-01-02 10:25:00,0,"Jerry, that really sounds good and looks like a great alternative to the typical shore lunch. I can't wait, only 7 more months to go until we start our fishing trip on LOTW. Wingmann"
553591,jerry bark,2006-01-02 15:14:00,822,"i've got my calendar marked allready too. you should definately try it, simple and different and any kind of fish will do. well, maybe not minnows but.... another thing you could do is to make up a batch of perchjerker's walleye cakes without the walleye. add your morning fish and pan fry those bad boys! i made a large batch of them this summer and i froze half on a cookie sheet in my deep freeze. once they were solid i vacuum sealed them. they stored really well. you could make a batch of these at home and take them along, pull the bag out of the cooler about 11 am, and pan fry at noon, can of beans, hostess cherry pies (or those BAMA brand pecan pies/tart thingies) and a few LaBatts (which you dutifully stashed on the island in a cooler before going fishing that morning) and the afternoon will fly right on by. if you take a cooler in the boat then the sky is the limit on what you could do. for example make up skillet full of shrimp scampi with double the usual sauce and cook it half done. freeze right in the skillet, pop out and then vacuum seal. once out fishing add some fish to the scampi in a skillet and cook. it won't be the same as your favorite italin restaurant but it will be good! you could also take along a dutch oven and some crab stuffing and make stuffed walleye filets bake them in the DO and feast, you could really go hog-wild and take along a packet of bernaise sauce mix to make and pour over the top. Hmmm, maybe take some ham and swiss cheese slices, an egg and some breading. then wrap ham around swiss and wrap in walleye filet, dip in egg and apply breading pan fry to brown a bit then bake in a dutch oven for 20 minutes or so: walleye cordon blue serve with an arugala salad, don't forget the linen napkins and a nice chardonnay....LOL cheers jerry"
553613,Guest,2006-01-03 15:26:00,0,"One of my favorites is Blackened Walleye. It is by far the simplest fastest, and easiest way to cook a shore lunch. By the way, it's quite tastey as well. I made this for our fishing party of 8 two summers ago and that's all they want any more. Many grocery stores sell premixed ""Blackened"" seasoning which works well. What You Need: Walleye Fillets (Obviously) One Stick of Butter Blackened Seasoning Iron Skillet (if available) 1 Lemon Melt butter and set aside. Then heat skillet as hot as possible. A wood fire works great. Dip fillets in butter and lay on paper plate. Coat both sides generously with blackened seasoning. Lay in frying pan (fillets will shrink rapidly and won't stick if pan is hot enough). Cooking about 30-45 seconds per side is all it takes. Remove from pan and squeeze lemon if desired. Yummy. By the way, it does take a few more fish to fill your tummy, I would recomend 3 fillets per person. Enjoy, Wally"

Make sur the oil is hot enough so that when you drop in a little piece of the coating, it ""dances"" just turning brown isn't hot enough. The corn flakes add a great crunchiness to the filet. Turn just once, enjoy."
553620,jerry bark,2006-01-04 12:41:00,822,"Wally, good idea! as you mentioned the key to blackened anything is a good hot cast iron skillet. cheers jerry"
553622,Guest,2006-01-04 13:00:00,0,"What sides does everyone like? We always have a can of beans we throw in the fire, and a bag of chips. What do you use?"
