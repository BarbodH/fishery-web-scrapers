PETA message a no-sell on Kenora billboard Tb News Source Web Posted: 12/30/2005 9:03:03 PM A well-known animal rights group is getting the cold shoulder innorthwestern Ontario. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals -- or PETA -- wantedto buy space on billboards in Kenora, trying to convince anglers togive up fishing. The activists wanted to say that fish feel pain too. But the sign owners say it would simply not be in their best interests to appear anti-fishing because it is one of the mainstays of the regional economy."

I pay particular attention as not to overcook them. I have the utmost respect for the fish's dignity. Seriously, I invite Peta to show up in Kenora say around opening day and rally at the bait shop. I am sure they would get the best of welcomes. What are these people nuts or what? With the Indians already going nuts on the spearing, Peta would be looking for some serious hurt. Talk about rubbing salt into already sensitive wounds. Give me a break. They should bring the ACLU with them then we could make sure we have the most liberal of liberals who have been out to destroy America for a century. What a great team these two groups could make."
553626,Guest,2006-01-04 19:42:00,0,The best recipes are the simple ones.The fish with a few Potatoes and some beans with fresh bread ( lightly toasted) is a meal fit for a king. A cool one or two (three) among good friends is life to the fullest. The respect thing for the fish is also important to me. I always kill humanely before filleting and will kill ASAP. I still shudder when I see fisherman filleting live squirming fish.
