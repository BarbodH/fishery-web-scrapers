I have been wanting to do the same thing, but it is has been tough to get away from the farm at that time of the year. We have local (Illinois) friends that own-operate an outpost operation in that general area and they went up this fall and did some bird hunting for amusement during moose season. It sounded like he got a pile of birds, had a blast, and of course they caught Walleye. I hear the weapon of choice is a 22 cal and head shorts are preferred. I am including their e-mail if you have questions on bird hunting, I am sure Wes would be happy to share information. Wanda-Wes Pitcher ([email protected])"

We did most of it roadhunting, walking through the bush can get a little tough. My weapon of choice was a 410 double, as most shots were pretty close. The ""chickens"" are great eating."
