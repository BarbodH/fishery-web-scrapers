553441,Guest,2005-12-23 09:43:00,0,"As a Law Enforcement Officer in the states for the past 17 years, I don't feel that a handgun ban would do anything but take handguns from law-abiding citizens. Criminals are criminals for a reason; they disregard laws. Enforcement and stiff mandatory sentencing guidelines for violators of current gun laws will accomplish more than any ban. If you do not think that banning handuns is the first step in an effort to ban firearms all together, you are mistaken. If you check the Australian's crime stats on gun crimes since their ban, you will find some sources that say it is up significantly and some that say it has dropped slightly. The overall numbers indicate that most crimes have risen since the ban. To be fair, ban advocates have stated that data used for these statistics is questionable, thus making these numbers invalid. Either way, I think it is safe to say that the ban has not made a significant difference when it comes to making people safer and may have made them less safe. It certainly does not appear that it was worth the $500 million dollars that it cost the taxpayers of that country. I realize that I am an American and this is a Canadian issue, but I feel strongly about this subject and worry that it may happen in our country before too long. Anyway, hope everyone has a Merry Christmas and safe new year."
553445,Guest,2005-12-23 11:30:00,0,"Unlogged, Your view is certainly shared by others, and because we are in the middle of an election, let's explore that further. I have heard similar sentiments from the Conservatives, particularly out of Alberta. Unfortuneately, your veiw is a very negative one, although perhaps not surprising from a law enforcement officer who often has to deal with society's worst. What we have here is a simple difference in opinion on how to reduce gun crimes. I think your conservative opinion has some major issues. First of all, you say ""I don't feel that a handgun ban would do anything but take handguns from law-abiding citizens."" What the #### does a law-abiding cirtizen need a handgun for? I'm a law-abiding citizen, and I don't have a handgun. I don't intend to use one. I don't ever see a reason why I would need to. This is the problem with a good chunk of society south of the border, and some, albeit much less (mainly conservatives), north of the border. These ""law-abiding citizens"" justify owning a handgun to protect themselves from other people with handguns!??! It's as stupid as building a missile system to protect yourselves from missiles. The whole point is to reach a state where nobody or almost nobody has a gun, or missiles, period. And I know, people like you Unlogged, are saying ""well . . . criminals will always find guns, there will always be an illegal, black-market for handguns, etc, etc, etc . . ."" That's not the point! The point is to reduce or minimize such activity to a lowest extent possible. Now is where the views of the other people in this country are introduced. Banning handguns is a necessary legislative procedure, only as a first step to end that typical defence people use of ""it should be my right to carry my gun."" Such legislation will end that debate right away. NOW, the next step is developing a society where everybody feels essentially like my statements above. EVERYBODY should be thinking ""I have no use for a gun, I have no need for a gun."" And how do you do that? By electing a government who invests in people's values, and brings society together. You do it by investing in national daycare, by investing in public education, and giving greater support to post-secondary students, so that you have all children chasing a prosporous, legal future; and not wondering the streets, getting involved in delinquint behaviour, joining gangs, etc. You do it by having an incredibly strong social security net, by investing in public housing, and by reducing or eliminating income taxes for the poorest in society, so that such people are not lured to a lifestyle of crime in order to live in their society; and if that costs money, then you more-heavily tax the wealthy. You ensure that the values of some are never placed before the good of the whole. THAT is how you develop a society that doesn't need handguns, that has no use for handguns, and where, when combined with legislation banning handguns, will eventually see the elimination of handguns in our society. What you do not do is exactly what you and the conservatives propose, which is simply throw more officers on the street and impose tougher sentences. That simply raises the level of 'perceived fear' in society (something the Americans are very good at doing; e.g., the warning level is being raised to orange), and causes more violence, and a greater belief in the ""need"" for a gun. It's rediculous. And do you honestly think, a gang member get's a gun, gets involved in potential criminal activity, and then says ""Ah, you know what, maybe I won't bother, I would have done the 10 years (if caught), but now with the new sentencing, I don't think it's worth the 15 years (if caught)."" First of all, these people don't expect to be convicted, so thoughts about sentencing are irrelevant. Second, many of these people are disconnected with society are would never be aware of such measures, because they have not been supported by society to develop a life otherwise (see comments above). The idea here, is that the law enforcement officer is greeted by parents at the door and has to tell them that their son got mixed up in a fight, rather than their son was shot and killed. With your conservative approach Unlogged, the officer is greeted then says, ""Your son was shot and killed, but take peace in knowing that IF we find who was responsible, they will serve 30 years, whereas before it would have been only 20."" Would you be a happy parent?? Of course not!! Tougher sentencing and more cops will not solve handgun violence. What will minimize, and ideally eliminate, handgun violence is the development of a society where nobody has the need for a gun, to commit a crime, or to prevent a crime, or to protect themselves. Such a state (physical and mental), supported by appropriate legislation, will negate the existence of handguns in our society. Electing a Conservative government, which constantly seeks to further reward the rich and create a state built on greed, and cuts the social programs required to foster a society where gun crime is not considered the only alternative, is definately not the answer! AND THAT IS WHY, ON JANUARY 23, CANADIANS WILL ONCE AGAIN ELECT LEFT-LEANING GOVERNMENT. Thankfully, there is more of us who see a future of a ""nobody-left-behind"" society, then those who see a ""protect the rich people's money"" society. NWO Fishing Bum"

553458,Guest,2005-12-23 22:02:00,0,"skylane......my understanding is that if you are a middle income individual without any insurance plan then you are at risk of losing everything if a major health issue arises. My understanding too is that about thirty percent of Americans have no health insurance and I guess rely on some sort of charity health care. My understanding too is that major corporations in the US are heading towards bankrupcy due, in part, to the spiralling health and insurance costs in your ""for profit"" health care system. In my opinion there is no better use for tax dollars collected by a government than for the health and well being of its citizens.....I don't think that it should be reserved for the people able to pay the premiums so others such as the shareholders in the insurance companies should get rich. You, my friend, are no better than your poorer American neighbor and have no moral right to better health care over another. Saying you deserve it because of your income or status over another is reprehensible. You are also unaware of the good things that occur in the Canadian health care system. I think when you eventually need medical attention in NW ontario you will not be so quick to ask to be shipped three hours to the nearest US, for profit, medical establishment. If so , I hope you make it on time....and perhaps you can get priority treatment over another by flashing your wallet. What a sad system....I really feel sorry for others in your country that don't have the luxury of health care you seem to have. It doesnt sound like you are ready for life in this neck of the woods."
553460,Guest,2005-12-23 23:09:00,0,"Gord, To answer your question, I simply don't know. Again, it comes back to the fact that guns are a part of our culture and always will be, regardless of a ban or not. One thing that I wanted to touch on in my previous post was the ""deterant factor"". I have interviewed suspects in serial burglaries who have told me that they avoided certain houses because the owner was a known gun owner or had dogs. Understand that alot of burglars know who you are. Several of them are friends of your kids. They know what you have, when your gone and the layout of your house. This is also true of business robberies. Many times it is an ex-employee or one of their dopper buddies. The thought of possibly being shot is definately a deterant to many of these people. If I had to name the single most problem with society today, it would be methamphetamine use. A high percent of all crimes is directly realated to the use and sale of this drug. Everything from murder to forgery is a part of this life style. You noted the difference between our two cultures when it comes to handgun ownership and I couldn't agree more. The right to bear arms in our country is a highly debated subject. I think you will mostly find that the ""antis"" live in urban areas and the pro-gun crowd lives in more rural areas or has rural ties. This is also true when it comes to animal rights. The problem with this is that people living in urban areas may not have the ""life expiriences"" to make an educated descision in either of these topics. They did not grow up on a farm, they were not forced to hunt for subsitance, nor did they ever view the gun as tool. They have not seen deer starving in the winter and never will understand animal population control. This may sound like a rant, but in our country these two subjects are closely tied. Your on this website, so I assume your an outdoorsman. If so, than you can understand my passion on this issue."
553463,Skylane,2005-12-24 07:55:00,101,"Gord, please don't misunderstand me, I think you do have a good medical system, it is just that it appears there is not enough of it, at least in the western part of the provence. I hear of cases where people have to wait for ever to see a doctor. A good friend died way to early, this summer. Could he have been saved with earlier treament? I don't know. I do know of the doctor shortage and where they are going. It all comes down to lack of funding. Yes, I agree that it would be great to have such a system that truly worked, but if postponed medical care occurs, then it needs a little more tweaking. That was my fear when Hillary Clinton was proposing this in the US. If that ever does happen, I would not expect much different results. I would rather our countries keep our money at home and take care of our own, but nobody asked us. I still do not like to support those that don't work and can. I also have no sympathy for those that do work that could afford health insurance, but choose to spend their money elsewhere, smoking, drinking, snow machines, whatever, these are luxuries, not priorities, pay your own way first. Sorry for the vent, but it just hits a nerve with me,I am a believer in the work ethic and am disgusted by those who don't and expect the rest of us to pick up the slack. I will do fine in the north woods and if an emergency comes up that can not be taken care of locally, other options will be available, because I have always had to take care of my own, I know how. Merry Christmas"
553464,Guest,2005-12-24 08:13:00,0,"Last year, me , my wife & our 2 year old girl went down to Myrtle Beach.(we are Canadians) Our little girl got pneumonia while we were there. Off to the walk in clinic. The doctor seen her within minutes. Took a chest xray & within 5 minutes we had the results, ditto for the blood test. They sent us off to the hospital emergency room. Again, instant QUALITY attention. 24 hours later our little girl was right back to her old self & out of the hospital. Everything about the US healthcare was top notch all the way!!! The doctors were top notch as were the nurses..southern hospitality I guess!! If this happened up here we would still be waiting for the chest xrays!! Mind you, the bill was high, we did have insurance so we were covered. We, as Canadians GLOAT aimlessly about having free healthcare, It is low quality & slow at best. I think we need a 2 tier system up here. Then maybe we will stop losing most of our fine doctors to the USA. As for the gun control thing...one step closer to Canada being commie,just keep voting Liberal & we will get there soon. I really don't see a problem, Gangbangers shooting other gangbangers, they will take care of themselves in time....when guns are outlawed....you know the rest!!!"
553465,Guest,2005-12-24 08:21:00,0,unlogged.....thanks for your perspective on the issue. I agree with the fact that many decisions are made by people who have little experience with the problem at hand. An example...the cancellation of the spring bear hunt due to the anti hunting people and the capitulation of the politicians....all supported by the majority of city folk who only see bears in picture books. Have a good Christmas and a safe 2006.
553466,Guest,2005-12-24 08:26:00,0,skylane....I agree there are inequeties in our system....especially as they relate to service in small communities such as in NWO. Not enough family doctors and related services. This is an issue that needs to be addressed and I think it will improve over time. Have a good Christmas.
553467,Guest,2005-12-24 08:31:00,0,jcc.....I really believe that a two tier system would see a rapid decline in the quality of the public system. I think the effort needs to be made in bringing the public system up rather than destroying it.
553475,Guest,2005-12-24 20:14:00,0,"It's nothing more than an electon ploy to secure votes from Vancouver, Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto. The Provinces can opt out and based on what I have read, there will likely be exemptions for collectors, target shooters, etc. So at the end of the day, how does this differ from the system we have now? It pretty much doesn't! If all of the money spent by the government on gun paranoia related programs was dumped into equipment for our outdated medical system, we would save 1000 times as many people per year as all of these ""feel good"" initiatives. Waste of money pure and simple. And for the record, I don't own a handgun or a rifle."
553476,Guest,2005-12-25 13:23:00,0,"Mike, I would be pretty depressed living in your world. What have the US liberals done? You're right, next to nothing. They want a completely different society than that which currently exists. Completely different! With your political system all they can do is get a little done here and there. So the tiny actions that are accomplished, get crippled by the rest of the ""backward action"" of your society. Unfortuneately such initiatives can't be realized to their fullest potential because it is happening so slowly. Your statement: ""It is not an issue of guns, but an issue of people, the heart of man and the decline of society as a whole."" That's exactly right! And your liberals want to build a completely different society (see my comments in my previous post). I completely agree, such miniscule legislative measures will have little impact. That is why you would need to elect a liberal government to power, and keep them there a long time, to build the kind of society you speak of. Even that would be tough . . . it might be better to completely scrap your whole governmental system and start over, so you don't have that stupid ""two-party only"" system, of ""right"" and ""further right"". I said it before and I'll say it again: ""Banning handguns is a necessary legislative procedure, only as a first step to end that typical defence people use of ""it should be my right to carry my gun."" Such legislation will end that debate right away . . . EVERYBODY should be thinking ""I have no use for a gun, I have no need for a gun."" And how do you do that?

You do it by investing in national daycare, by investing in public education, and giving greater support to post-secondary students, so that you have all children chasing a prosporous, legal future; and not wondering the streets, getting involved in delinquint behaviour, joining gangs, etc. You do it by having an incredibly strong social security net, by investing in public housing, and by reducing or eliminating income taxes for the poorest in society, so that such people are not lured to a lifestyle of crime in order to live in their society; and if that costs money, then you more-heavily tax the wealthy. You ensure that the values of some are never placed before the good of the whole. THAT is how you develop a society that doesn't need handguns, that has no use for handguns, and where, when combined with legislation banning handguns, will eventually see the elimination of handgun-killings in our society."" That is a vision, and at this point, some might think it's utopian, and some may think it's realistic. But I have yet to hear of a better vision out of somebody else, here. It appears the alternative vision is let evryone have guns, and just put more money in police and put more criminals behind bars for a longer period . . . WOW, that sounds great guys! What a wonderful society . . . NOT!! NWO Fishing Bum"
553477,Guest,2005-12-25 22:14:00,0,I lost a lot of respect for NWO after reading his posts on this topic. I thought he was better educated.....Just a dreamer...
553479,Guest,2005-12-26 02:45:00,0,"Well, I guess is it nice to know I was respected at one point. Is it really less respect, or just that my take on this thread is contrary to your poiltical ideology. I'm betting it's more the latter. And if not, I have to tell you Dan, I won't lose any sleep. But I'm glad to be ""wrinkling your feathers."" There is no question, that I phrase arguments specifically with the intention of stimulating further debate. That's why these discussion boards exist, to share information and debate controversial issues. Granted we are digressing somewhat from fishing, but it's still enjoyable. I'm fairly confident, that if I was to, for example, go fishing with many of the people who share thoughts on this board, we would have an absolute blast. But sitting here, mid-winter (and it's ice-fishing only where I live right now) staring at a monitor, why not get some good debate going. And Dan, if YOU seemingly have such an education to suggest that I apparently do not, being just a ""dreamer"", why don't YOU share YOUR ideas on how to build a better society, where amongst other things, we suffer from less handgun violence. Because right now on this thread, I see some decent debate; I see an abundance of criticism; I see some good takes on describing the problem. But what I don't see is many other people offering solutions. Yes, I have described a theoretical, ideological (and some may call it 'utopian'), state as a solution. That solution wouldn't happen tomorrow, wouldn't happen next year, and perhaps couldn't even happen in 20 years. But that is the nature of politics; to implement small measures, based on legislation, which attempt to transform society from it's current state to that ideological state. The practice of politics however, is derived from the battle between multiple groups who differ in opinion on the characteristics of that ideological state. Dan, if you and I happen to disagree on that ideological state, then great, we should be able to share some good debate. SO, why don't you, as opposed to putting forth non-productive, ""one-liner"" statements, actually put some substance into YOUR posts on this thread, so we can all see how much more wonderful your world would be than mine! Maybe AFTER you do that, we will start discussing education . . . NWO Fishing Bum"
553480,Guest,2005-12-26 08:57:00,0,"NWO....perhaps some view your utopian perspective on the issue as being naive. While I agree that many of the problems could be solved by measures to improve the lives of our citezens, you still need to not lose sight of the grim realities. There still needs to be a balanced approach. It can not be to just make things more soft and fuzzy without strengthening the other end of the spectrum...ie. enforcement and punishment. Some of the current crimes may have some of their roots in poverty,etc, but also point to the fact that some individuals gravitate to a culture of crime and are basically bad individuals. Society needs the ability and will to step on these people hard. Decades of poverty on some aboriginal communities has not lead to the types of violence we see in Toronto for example.....why is that? Seems we have imported individuals with a culture of violence and are unable to deal with them. You have to acknowledge the level of frustration for the other side of the arguement (guns) when situations like the recent killing of the Montreal police officer was killed by someone, who under our current laws was not supposed to own a gun, but was given permission to buy a rifle. The fact that it was an elephant rifle and was used to shoot through a door, both sides of the officers bullet proof vest and into the next apartment seems to suggest that we are not handling what current laws we have now properly. I can see where promising a hand gun ban during an election can be viewed as laughable. That being said, I have no problem with restricting hand guns as much as possible, just not sure if it will solve any problems on its own."

First it was just register some guns. At little expense. Then it was all guns. The costs of the program are out of this world insane, with the canadian People footing the bill for yet another bloated over priced Govt initiative. You watch! Next it will be an outright ban on handguns, then certain rifles will be subject, then possibly all. Does England and Austrailia ring any bells?"
553636,Guest,2006-01-05 23:10:00,0,"Ya, and you don't care as long as they don't come for YOUR gun that fits YOUR level of shooting. You just went to a 12 on the apathetic gun owner meter. By the way the meter normally only goes to 10, but you pegged it! That kind of narrow thinking is why we are having this post debated in the first place. Remember back when it was supposed to be simple and cost effective registration? Can you not see the monster that is total gun registration and possible confiscation that is heading your way?"

553653,Guest,2006-01-06 17:10:00,0,"You are right the Gun Ban will not work, nor will longer jail time and other enforcement issues. What will work is better education, real jobs and hope. Mix this with better Immigration, deportation of people convicted of serious crime in their first 10 years. The city people in Toronto and the Golden Horseshoe are a world away from the rest of Canada. However they are the votes that matter. This Racial profiling thing is making big headlines here in Ontario as well. A Police Officer friend summed it up like this...The last 19 investigations I did had one thing in common that being the colour of the perp...How can I not be suspicious when my safety is involved."
553655,Guest,2006-01-06 17:46:00,0,"My opinion on this issue is that a handgun ban will not solve the problem with gun violence in T.O.There are already relativly strict laws regarding handgun ownership in this country.Part of the problem I feel is the lax sentences given to criminals commiting crimes with guns,a culture of young individuals who feel that they need to arm themselves,and the prevalence of gangs and wannabees who will pull a trigger in a heartbeat to protect their interests.Handguns smuggled in from the U.S. or stolen from legitimate owners will still be on the streets.Time and money spent on stricter sentencing,closer supervision,and education would be far better irregardless of which government is in.This proposal is a kneejerk reaction imo."
553656,Guest,2006-01-06 18:19:00,0,I agree. It will also be interesting to see extremely stiff sentences and a ban outright possibly coming... what that would do to the mind set of young gang member facing this. May be worse than what we have already in the form of violence. He may shoot first.
553597,Guest,2006-01-02 18:29:00,0,"Good points gord. It's funny how the two arguments against the same proposed law are so vastly different, based in the respective cultures of course. Generally speaking (at least I think it may be fair to generalize in this fashion . . . of course there will be other arguments): - The argument from the people in the US is basically one of entitlement . . . that the government should have no business in taking guns away from people, etc. - The argument from the people in Canada is basically one of resource allocation . . . that the money used on such programs is ineffective and could be more appropriately used to fund other programs that would try and address the problem As a Canadian, my argument against the registry and this handgun stuff is exactly like I noted in my second point above. I think if the money were put into additional RCMP positions, more dough for Customs, etc., I think it would be more effective in addressing the real issue . . . illegal guns making their way into Canada and being used for illegal activities. I have no problem with controls on rifles/shotguns and tough restrictions on handguns. I also have no problem with the prohibited status of assault weapons in Canada. I also have no issue with the Government limiting firearm ownership to people that have jumped through the appropruate hoops. However, I think that the controls we currently have in place are adequate and that any further attempt to crack down on illegal guns will best be served from the policing side of things and not via more paperwork or legislation. Oh and GI Joe, I think everyone in North America owes something to the US AND Canadian vets who have fought wars on foreign soil so that we can live over here in peace."

553616,Skylane,2006-01-04 06:53:00,101,"Just my thoughts here. Even though I participated earlier in this thread, after reading some of my own comments as well as others it looks to me we are getting a little too personal. I for one did not mean it to look that way. I don't think that it was meant that way when we are writing the replies, but it is starting to take that tone. We are all on the same side, have the same goals, but just approach it differently. I am heading north tommorrow to poke a few holes in the ice and I bet the fish don't care how I feel about these isssues. This is a privilege we are allowed and I thank our neighbors for keeping the door open to us."

Well, you are just a prime example of the intolerant and cultural misfits who will vote for Harper. Do you really think that the gun control issue is going to muster enough Harper votes for him to win? Since when does handgun control mean you can't hunt with your other 20 firearms?Get in the game man!!!!"
553627,bigfish1965,2006-01-04 19:59:00,3210,"Well...first, Canada doesn't have a Queen. Second, we were in fighting the Germans a few years before the US even heard of Hitler. Handgun control has nothing to do with wars. Whens the last time you saw a handgun battle in Iraq? I had previously mentioned hate crime because a responder alluded to Australia's rise in crime since the ban of handguns, when in fact the rise in crime was due to rising racial tensions.HAd there been a bevy of handguns around, I doubt the stats would be different. Very, very few Canadians have handguns and very little crime.http://www.answers.com/topic/crime-in-canadahttp://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/011218/d011218b.htm"
553630,Guest,2006-01-05 16:53:00,0,"Great hearing a debate, but I have one question to pose to both sides of the debate. Would you support a mandatory 20 year sentence for being found guilty of ANY crime involving a gun? NO TIME OFF FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR, 20 YEARS IN THE SLAMMER! PERIOD! That, my friends would prevent some of these crimes. IMHO When you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns."
553632,Guest,2006-01-05 18:17:00,0,"Hi There. I agree with you that longer sentences would prevent some crime but you would also have to include more judges, prosecutors and special police gang units on a long term basis.A gun ban alone does nothing.How Leninist was that answer boys???"
553516,Guest,2005-12-28 19:25:00,0,"Interesting stats although they may be misleading when you look at how the assault category is defined (which accounts for the vast majority of violent crimes on the Canadian breakdown). For purposes of the Canadian stats, it looks like all assault's are classified as violent crimes, even something like a verbal threat. The US data seems to capture the most serious types of assault into their figures. I'm thinking that it might not be an apples to apples comparison due to the how various crimes would be classified in each country."

553542,doubleheader,2005-12-30 15:18:00,2652,"I'm a U.S. citizen and I've visited Canada each year for the last 40 for our annual fishing trip. I love Canada and I am thankful we have such a good neighbor to the north. I'm also a handgun owner, which I keep in my home for protection, and an owner of many hunting rifles and shotguns which I've acquired over the years for the obvious purpose of hunting. I live in a rural area, I've grown up around guns, and I see them as a useful tool. I've got to tell you I almost got a headache reading these posts. Why can't one expess opinions without attacking another person's position? I've always suspected that such behavior results from an inability to communicate a rational arguement. Here's my two cents. No question here in the U.S. firearms are part of our culture. There is also no disputing they often are used to commit violent acts of crime by the thugs in our society, and, unfortunately, often are the cause of accidental deaths as well. Despite our violent crime, and any is too much, the violent crime rate in the U.S. has trended down considerably over the last 30 years; 2005 being an exception, which I believe is mostly attributed to this very serious methamphetamine problem. To me the answer is pretty simple. The vast majority of violent crime is a caused by a very small minority of thugs. When they get caught and after due process, lock them up and throw away the key. I would much rather error on the side of caution than give a thug a second chance. I know it sounds harsh, but it is effective. Thug in prison- thug off streets. Drug dealer in prison- drug dealer can't sell drugs. The simple plain truth is there are no easy solutions to violence other than remove the criminal from society. If Canadians vote to ban gun ownership I hope it works out for them. I don't think it will based on the results of other countries who have gone down that road, but I say ""Hey, good luck"". As a U.S. citizen it's none of my business. I wouldn't critcize a Canadian for voting to ban guns, and I would hope Canadians wouldn't criticize those of us in the U.S. who stand tall against such measures. We both want the same thing, we just are pursuing different methods. Those in favor of banning guns want to eliminate guns for the purpose of eliminating crime, most of us in the US want to eliminate the thug. The same can be said for health care. Who can dispute that both systems have flaws? The only thing I would say about our system is that sooner or later something must change. The costs have spiraled out of control. I am fortunate to have coverage, yet I still forego certain perscriptions because of cost. In the end perhaps the biggest difference between liberal thinkers and conservatives is the degree to which they trust government and the degree to which they can accept government involvement in their lives. We conservatives, as a whole, don't believe government knows best, are suspicious of their motives, and highly doubtful they can effectively resolve any issue better than the individual. I like to think this is a healthy suspicion, alot like a fish that is hook shy for reason. Hope everyone, Canadian, American, Liberal and Conservative has a Happy, Healthy, and Prosperous New Year."

The other article also points to another country (Australia) who is embroiled in racially motivated crime sprees over the last year or two. The fact is we already have a near ban on handguns. The new proposal would change nothing since it has the same exemptions that even the most stringent province (Ontario) already has. What we lack, especially in Ontario, are judges. Hundreds of cases are at risk of being thrown out because of a lack of JP's. Our Ontario Liberals have a total lack of direction. Canada does not need more handgun control. It needs help from the US in stemming the tide of guns being smuggled into Canada through New York and it needs existing gun owners to be more responsible with gun storage to prevent the rising numbers of gun thefts."

553594,Guest,2006-01-02 16:31:00,0,"It seems the heated debate on this topic is coming from individuals south of the border who are confusing restricting firearms in Canada as an infringement on the god given U.S. right to bear arms. Firstly, Canada is a different country. Secondly, there is no where near the number of handguns in Canada as the U.S. Thirdly, unlike what some have intimated, Canadians do not want to send their loved ones off in the morning with a cheery ""Oh, don't forget your firearm for protection dear"". Maybe it works in the U.S. and ""have at it"" if that is what you like but I for one am hoping for a different approach to the problem of gun violence in Canada. I think if we reach the point of giving everyone weapons for defence then we might as well admit defeat. Oh, by the way GI Joe....thanks a bunch."

Anyways, I hope you had a great Christmas."
553486,bigfish1965,2005-12-26 18:48:00,3210,"I don't know what the answer is either. I think the way it is now is fine. It is a fallacious argument to say that increasing guns in the community decreases crime. We know that is not true. The per capita crime rate in the US is several times higher than ours. There's also a great argument that banning legal handguns doesn't do anything to remove guns from the hands of the criminals. So we need a compromise. Make gun owners responsible for the safe storage so they don't get stolen nearly as often.Improve the security at the US border to stem the tide of illegal guns being smuggled across. AS far as the medical systems...the more I read the more they sound the same. You can pay taxes or you can pay insurance premiums....up to you. Those who live in the boonies often complain that they do not get the same treatment as you would see in bigger cities....yet somehow they don't see the flaw in the logic of the complaint. Do you think if hospitals were 'for profit' that there would be more in sparsley populated areas?? I had cancer in 1998 and recieved nothing but top notch care from my family doctor right up to the cancer hospital in Hamilton, Ontario. I was diagnosed and operated on within 10 days and started treatment 6 weeks later. Never paid out anything and only ever signed one form. It is truly sad that doctors use their subsidized education to flee to the US for more money. Perhaps since we are footing the bill for part of their education, we should require them to do a stint in Canada before being allowed to leave."
553493,Wisconeye,2005-12-27 08:58:00,79,"NWO The biggest problem with the liberal viewpoint on the gun issue is the lack of reasonable expectations. The position of the left is one based on emotion, ideology, and some kind of 'vision'. Banning handguns is not a new concept and has been done in many places before, including United States municipalities. Any expected outcomes can be based on facts instead of ideology. European countries that have banned handguns saw no reduction in gun related violence and an increase in gun deaths that were related to drugs and gangs. In the United States several of the municipal handgun bans were repealed due to facts surprisingly, not because of constitutional encroachments. There is a direct correlation to gun ownership and the crime rate. The more guns there are in the hands of the public the lower the crime rate. Don't believe this, research it yourself- I'll provide citations below. There is a criminal element in EVERY society and it cannot be contained by the police alone. Even criminals evaluate risk and knowing that they may indeed be killed in the commission of their crime will provide a deterent. Police interdiction is predictable while interdiction by ""Average Joe"" is not- often an element that criminals will fear and cause alteration of their actions. It comes down to the fact you cannot legislate morality and while you may be able to give people a better lifestyle and reduce the propensity for crime through education, economy and social programs- you will not be entirely effective if for no other reason than greed. For an international perspective try reading 'More Guns, Less Crime, Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws' by John R. Lott, Jr. Unless of course you live in a certain country that has conveniently made this book unavailable within it's borders because it contradicts their gun control laws.

While it may be true in your culture that more guns equals less crime, when comparing our two countries, this argument does not hold water. We have a much lower crime rate and have much fewer guns.Those are undeniable stas.

553472,Guest,2005-12-24 12:41:00,0,I'll give you a personnel perspective. A family member has been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. He does not have a drug plan. The meds for this disease run 20K per year for the rest of his life. These drugs are picked up by our health care system because they are an extreme burden to the average person. The same goes for the next generation Cancer Drugs which are pricey. We have some issues with our system but I thank God that he is being looked after and that we would never have to make the choice of meds or say my childs education. The Meds are helping and I thank God for this as well. Canadians and Americans are both distinct societies. I'm also glad you people are our friends. God Bless and Best of the Holiday Season.
553473,Mike1973,2005-12-24 14:07:00,7,"I personally believe this..you can create all the gun laws and bans you want, and it will do no good in reducing crime or killings. If you believe that you are a Total Fool! It is not an issue of guns, but an issue of people, the heart of man and the decline of society as a whole. The value of a human life is little these days. What has the Left wing here in the U.S. really accomplished with all the laws they have created? We have more gun laws on the books, than at any point in history, and where are we? Nowhere,in the way of really reducing crime. Ask the Brits and the Aussies! I have, and they say it was the worst thing they ever bought into! Did not do anything but take away their rights and their guns. Oh yea, almost forgot, did not change the crime rate either.Remember Hitler? Yea, he did the same thing to the German people. I like Canada, and it is a shame to see you folks even think of buying into the ""BS"" of gun bans. I hope you don't allow your government that kind of free reign on your rights! We here have to fight it everyday with our liberal left wing left idiots here and will contitnue to do so. You ban guns, you beter get ready for a ban on just about everything...cause if people want to kill someone they are going to find a way.... If you take away the guns, you can rest assured that the criminals will still have them! Do you think your stupid bans and laws will stop them? They are criminals and thugs...they don't care about law anyway!"
553451,Guest,2005-12-23 14:57:00,0,"I'm curious, do unicorns and bunny rabbits play side by side in a flowery valley in this handgun-free eutopian world you speak of? I have always said that the difference between conservatives and liberals is that conservatives are realistic about things and liberals are constant dreamers of things that are not possible. Accept the fact that guns are here and always will be, ban or no ban. Accept that someplace in the world there will always be a war going on. Accept the fact that people always have and always will take the easy way out ie. government social programs. To be more specific, you ask why a law abiding citizen would ever need a handgun. I do feel that in certain instances, a handgun for personal safety is a valid point. However, if you want a handgun for simply shooting or hunting and you do so within the guidelines of the law, who cares if you ""need"" it or not. When it comes to social issues and programs, you have to look no further than certain Scandanavian countries where everyone is entitled to something. The un-employment rate is unprecidented and rising continually. Why not, who wants to work when you can lay around, get legally high and recieve a check every two weeks. What happens when the cost of the entitlements exceeds that of the tax base? You can only tax the working population to a certain percent. Your argument about gang members still using a gun to commit a crime, regardless of mandatory sentencing guidelines is right on. Your right, they won't think twice about it. Where your thinking goes wrong is where you believe a ban will prevent that gang member from getting a handgun. As far as stiffer sentencing not accomplishing anything, I personally can think of several gang members who have been involved in multipal gun related crimes over a five year period. So, I guess that extra five years in prison may have actually prevented a few crimes. Believe it or not, I am all for giving people second chances when it comes to property crimes or drug addictions. Where I begin having problems, is when they are given ten or twelve ""second chances"". To put it bluntly, there are people out there who simply need to be warehoused. I also think that government assistance is a good and needed thing, when regulated properly. However, it's abuse is widespread and actually defended by those leaning way to the left in our country. If you are able bodied and on government assistance you should have to work for eight hours a day, whether it be cleaning ditches or sorting recycleables at the landfill. There needs to be an incentive in place for people to become a productive member of society and not a lifelong welfare receipient. I'm also with you on education, however, I see a simple solution to this. We have good teachers in place for the most part. What has happened is that we have taken away their ability to control the classroom and it's students. Liberals all over will wince when I say this, but sometimes a kid needs to be wacked on the backside of his/her head. Granted, it's deeper than that, but I distinctly remember how controlled fear kept me in line many a day when I was in school. There also need to be penalties in place for deadbeat parents who do not make their kids attend school. This is far more common than most would believe. School uniforms would also solve many problems amongst the students themselves. This is a conundrum for liberals because it has do with eliminating social classes (nice clothes vs old clothes=rich vs poor)which is supposed to be a good thing. But wait, how can we dampen little Joey's freedom of expression. That has kept many a ACLU member awake at night! Please do not take this post the wrong way Fishing Bum, I can tell that you are educated and well spoken, we simply have different points of view. I would bet we would probably have a pretty entertaining conversation over a couple of beers! Again, have a Merry Christmas and safe new year."

Put some real teeth into the laws on both sides of the border concerning all gun crimes. Reinstate and apply the death penalty when it is justified. Make these people have to work and put an end to the baby factories that are on the goverment dole, they are bringing down our societies. It is no wonder that many in North-West Ontario would like to break off from this type of thinking and go it on their own. I plan on moving to Ontario in the near future and have applied for the firearms liscense. I will sell the handguns rather then deal with the red tape, but have to say what your goverment is doing concerning guns is just sickening. So after all the negative comments I must say I can't think of a place I would rather live than North-West Ontario. I also am looking foward to being able to vote. Happy fishing and Merry Christmas."
553453,Guest,2005-12-23 17:29:00,0,"This is a complicated issue that is further complicated, in terms of the arguements made by NWO and Unlogged, by the fact that we are dealing with two distinct countries and associated gun cultures. I think that most Canadians would feel that the owning of a handgun is one right that we could do without if there was a possibility of it making a difference in some violent crimes. Many Americans, on the other hand would feel that it was too much of an infringement on their personnal rights to restrict such a weapon. I dont think we can superimpose a Canadian attitude onto the Amercian situation or visa versa. I dont think either is inherently wrong and each country and citizens will have to live with the path they choose. My question to Unlogged....as a law officer would a theoretical US, where handguns were a rarity, have made any difference to your experience over the past seventeen years.? I agree with the arguement that most criminals will obtain weapons, but what about the other circumstances that have arisen from the prevalence of handguns. To NWO.....I think Unlogged makes a point for ""crime and punishment""...do you really think that all criminals are just a result of falling through the government safety net. When do some of these killers just have to face up to there own actions and decisions?"

553455,Skylane,2005-12-23 19:17:00,101,"Gord, I had this conversation with our Ontario neighbor this summer. There is a misconception that unless you have money in the US you cannot get health care. The fact is if you come to the emergency room in the US that they will treat you right away even if you do not have the means to pay. Yes, even with a runny nose, it happens all the time. This and the law suits are why our health care has become so expensive, we that work for a living pay for those that don't. The thought of wiping out your bank account may be true if something catastrofic happens and you do not have the means and or health insurance, but is it up to our neighbors and countrymen to pay our debts? On the upside we have excellent health care and do not have to wait for any length of time to get treatment. I do not think that anyone needs to apologise if they have been successful nor do I feel that they should have to support those that don't carry their own weight if they are able. When I move to your great country I will pay taxes but will not burden your health care system, all medical care will be done in a timely manner south of the border. We have worked too hard for our dream to risk ending it prematurely with delayed medical care. I hope there will soon be a change for the better."

553365,Guest,2005-12-18 16:04:00,0,"Paul Martin, the Canadian prime minister, has proposed an outright ban on handguns and tougher mandatory sentences for gun-related crimes amid growing public concern over firearms violence. Mr Martin made the proposal on Thursday in a troubled Toronto neighbourhood as part of the ruling Liberal Party's platform for the general election on January 23. While the proposals may strike a chord on the campaign trail, it is by no means certain that they will keep firearms off the streets. Guns have been involved in two thirds of Toronto's 74 murders this year, double their rate last year. Much of the violence has been gang-related. Wendy Cukier, president of the Coalition for Gun Control, said the proposed ban would mainly affect gun owners who were allowed to keep their weapons under grandfathering provisions included in recent gun-control legislation. She estimated that these exemptions covered 250,000 to 300,000 weapons.https://registration.ft.com/registra...0779e2340.html"

553374,Guest,2005-12-19 03:25:00,0,"Instead of dealing with the gang problem they are creating a red heiring of the gun. you know what the first thing Hitler did when elected leader? he confiscated all the guns. President Madison said that the federal government does not have a monopoly on violence. do you think for a second that if the folks in Iraq had guns, Sadam could have doe what he did? You cant make an omelet without breaking some eggs. like the guy said the government does not care about you, only how to get your money."
553378,Guest,2005-12-19 07:41:00,0,"I agree with you. If Mr Martin thinks banning guns is going to lower the crime rate all you have to do is look at the the banning of alcohol in the 1920's commonly refered to in the U.S.A as Prohibition. I will bet that there were many more than 74 deaths caused by drunken drivers in Toronto, but you don't see Loudmouth Mr Martin wanting to ban alcohol do you??????????????"
553379,Guest,2005-12-19 08:23:00,0,....so executing gang members will reduce crime. Seems like it really works in the US.....not!

553389,Guest,2005-12-19 17:56:00,0,The Toronto thing is gangs and Drugs. There is no easy answer. The issue of colour and race is another. A lot of the individuals involved are from Jamaica and have huge gang involvement. There is a dropping of the ball by our immigration people...these people should not be here. I'm all for deportation of anyone back to their home country .......citizen or not if they get arrested for violent crimes in their first ten years in Canada. The gun ban is coming maybe not in our life time but it is ...It will be the will of the Canadian people. Trouble is we all get your American news......

If Iraqis don't have guns,what are they shooting at the soldiers with?? Toronto is a big city in a small country. I don't think the ban on handguns will do anything at all. Ontario already has pretty strict rules on handguns. The gang members are killing each other for the most part which is why little is really being done."
