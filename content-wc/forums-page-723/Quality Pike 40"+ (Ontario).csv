553387,grt1,2005-12-19 15:54:00,259,"Hey Budfll, you have a good christmas in the sunny south and don't worry about the -40 degree temperature we'll be having, I put in a request with the man upstairs to save some for you on your return north."
553433,Stu,2005-12-22 14:09:00,472,How is the walleye fishing on St. Joe?
553533,Guest,2005-12-29 21:46:00,0,"If you don't mind spending the money and you plan to release a trophy fish there is no better pike lake in Canada than Kesagami. I use to fish there about 15 years ago under the old ownership and the amount of pike 35+ inches was unbelievable. The new owners have put many rules into effect to protect the pike population and keep it a trophy pike lake. Rules include: catch and release of all pike, only cradles may be used to land fish, and single barbless hooks only The lake's average depth is about 7-10ft (no that is not a typo) and the pike stay in the weed bays year round, unlike other Canadian lakes where they move to deeper water in the summer. If you want the opprotunity to boat a 45""+ pike and several 35""+ pike each day, Kesagami is the place to go."
553538,Guest,2005-12-30 12:26:00,0,I thought I had read somewhere that Seapration Lake on the English River was #2 for Northern Pike in all of Ontario? Am I mistaken?
553350,Guest,2005-12-17 17:44:00,0,"What lakes offer the best pike fishing. Looking for a place with the good possibilty for a 40"" fish plus good action and numurous 35""+ pike."
553352,Guest,2005-12-17 18:43:00,0,"I'm surprised Fred hasn't responded yet, telling you to go to Lake St. Joseph, but that is certainly a possibility. Some resorts around Red Lake can offer a good shot at big pike. Lac Seul is also a good bet, particularly in the spring. NWO Fishing Bum"
553353,Fred_G,2005-12-17 18:57:00,908,"Well, I will respond with the recommendation of Lake St Joe. We catch several 40"" and up every year. I'm sure there are other lakes in Ontario that can supply this kind of fishing too, I just happen to like St Joe."
553357,hoosiercanadian,2005-12-17 22:42:00,104,"Nungessar, which runs into Little Vermillion lake both are known for big pike, these lakes are north of Red Lake."
553360,Pooch,2005-12-18 10:21:00,4619,"The right time of year on most lakes will get decent sized northerns. On every trip we have made, someone in the group picks up a northern in the high 30 to low 40"" range while fishing for walleye. Catching 35"" northern is pretty normal while fishing for walleye. We normally fish in July to mid August and are usually trolling deep water for walleye at that time of year. When we are catching lots of walleye in an area and it suddenly stops, there probably is a larger northern (in the area)attracted by the commotion of us catching and releasing walleye. Start throwing spoons or larger cranks. Sometimes it quickly becomes apparent why the walleye suddenly disappeared. Sorry for getting sidetracked. A little bit of cabin fever this morning... Pooch"
553361,Guest,2005-12-18 15:23:00,0,"I am biased of course.lol But since the introduction of smelts into Rainy, I have caught alot of 35-41's. I have yet to catch one bigger, but quite a few 40's. Especially in the early spring or late fall when they come up from the depths. Ash and Alexandria bays are the best."
553362,Guest,2005-12-18 15:41:00,0,"See, I told you Fred would be there right on cue! NWO Fishing Bum"
553366,grt1,2005-12-18 17:34:00,259,"I just heard that a Wisconsin fisherman got a 45"" pike through the ice on Gullrock last weekend. it was 25+ pounds."
553377,Fred_G,2005-12-19 07:08:00,908,So I like the lake! Lots of people have their favorites.
553380,fishanytime,2005-12-19 08:55:00,63,"we got several over 35 inches last fall on Lake of the Woods jigging reefs for walleyes, just are fun on a walleye pole"
