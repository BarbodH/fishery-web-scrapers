553595,Guest,2006-01-02 16:54:00,0,"I've fished Caribou the last 3 years for walleye. When we go the latter part of July to the first week of August the walleye have gone to deeper water from 28 to 35 feet deep. The fish are usually pretty easy to find and hit throughout the day. They generally run 18 to 22 inches for the most part, though there are bigger fish caught each year. We don't fish for lake trout, though we did catch one on a fuzzy grub in 45 feet of water this past year. Most people that fish for lakers fish the deep water near the boat launch as that area contains the deepest water in the lake. The lake is around 22,000 acres and has 3 outfitters on it. It has a huge amount of structure for walleye and you'll also catch some pretty nice northerns while jigging for walleyes."
