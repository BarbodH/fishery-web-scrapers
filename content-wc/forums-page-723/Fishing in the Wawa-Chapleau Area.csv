I was wondering, Eyebanger, since you have been fishing the Prairie Bee Lake area for 8 years, have you ever fished the lake north of there. I'm not sure of the name, but it looks as to be a large lake. Is there any camps on this lake or is it only a portage in lake? Camping would be OK but a cabin would be great. This lake looks to be somewhat isolated and it is about the farthest north I would like to drive. There is the Shoals Park south of the road for camping. Also, if anyone else knows any information, I would be grateful for your help."
553529,Guest,2005-12-29 17:58:00,0,There is a fishing camp on Prairie Bee Lake as well as on Lake Windamere. Do a Google search for more info on both camps/lakes
553543,Reelmn,2005-12-30 15:32:00,328,"I have made 4 trips to Prairie Bee in the past 6 years and have enjoyed all of them. We take a group of 4-6 guys and stay with Tom at Prairie Bee Camp. We book his largest cabin which offers a great view of the lake. We have always done well with walleye(last full moon of July) although nothing large. The smallmouth have started to come back which makes for some extra fun casting among the rocks. Ninety perscent of my walleye fishing will be done with a 1/8 oz. Whistler jig/leech on 4# test line. We purchase about 3 pounds of large leeches at the general store in Wawa then go to town later in the week to get more if needed. Live bait rigs are also a good option with leeches or crawlers. One mile out from the camp is a large reef that can hold a lot of walleye late in the evening. Continuing up the lake from the reef is a large weed flat that bends around to the right with a few points coming out from the shoreline. This is a good area for livebait rigs in late afternoon. There are two other places farther up the lake with one being near the launch and the other near the outpost cabin. It's a pretty good distance to run in a camp boat, but i take my own rig and can get there pretty quickly. We like to stay at the Parkway Motel on the south end of Wawa. It's small, family owned and quiet. The guys like to have breakfast at Mr. Mugs donut shop before heading to the lake. If you get serious about this trip, let me know and I will send you a copy of my lake map with spots labeled. Dan(Reelmn)"
553547,jerry bark,2005-12-31 00:53:00,822,"the lake just north is windemere as mentioned. the camp on windemere is happy day lodge. windemere is an excellent lake for walleye and smallmouth, has some pike, whitefish and lake trout. there are no other camps on the lake and about 20 or so private cottages. not hard to fish all day and not see anyone else if you want. HDL is a great camp, last i talked with the owners it was sold out on cabins for 2006, but still has some campsites open. they also have some island campsite possibilities. we'll be there the week starting june 10 in cabin 6 so stop in if you make it there. cheers jerry"
553552,Guest,2005-12-31 13:32:00,0,"Dennie: I agree wiht what Reelmn said. I've been on PB for 10 or more years and plan on going back in 2006. I fished Windermere one year(mid-1990's), in early August. Windermere was very good fishing, but I prefer PB because of the smaller camp, no train tracks nearby (Happy Days is right on a track), and no generator runnign 24/7. Those are my personal preferences, and there area many people who would not mind those factors. It's a personal choice. If you decide to go to PB, contact me and I'll send you a map with some spots marked .... although I'll warn you that the ""hot spots"" change every year. ChuckCC has a lot of experience on PB .... you might put out a plea to him also."
553557,jerry bark,2005-12-31 15:58:00,822,"yeah the trains run pretty steady all day, maybe one every hour to hour and a half during daylight. i don't recall ever hearing one after dark. so depending on where you fish you might hear them, i rather enjoy it. the generator cannot be heard unless you are right next to the generator shed and the door is open, maybe they have a new gen since you were there? glad to hear that prarie bee is a good spot, we have kept that camp and como lake in mind as back-ups in case we have to give up our week and can't get back to HDL. lots of folks, lots of camps! another idea for the OP if you would be interested: five mile lake lodge has an outpost camp on Goldie lake which is know for trophy pike and lake trout, it also holds nice smallmouth. the outpost is the only cabin on the lake, so you won't see another boat unless someone portages in. the access is by riding the train to a drop off point where you can take a boat to the cabin. cheers jerry"
