1460009,Ia Walihntr,2012-07-10 14:08:00,320,You might check out Mylie's Place Resort at Morson on Lake of the Woods. I know They have at least one hadicap accessable cabin. It's a drive to resort with very good fishing in the area. Marv
1460101,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-10 19:22:00,235,I am certain that all resorts can be assessed by the disabled. Whether they can be accessed by them is a different story.
1458828,evhawkeye,2012-07-07 14:55:00,7,"I was wondering if anybody has any reccomendations on handicap assessable resorts in ontario or northern minnesota? We have been to canada before, even done a fly-in. Our biggest concern is steps and need boats with actual seats. Thanks in advance."
1458837,Guest,2012-07-07 15:43:00,0,"I would suggest you consider SWWL, if you can get in in the time frame you want. Northwest Ontario and a drive-in on the central part of Lac Suel. Great fishing and outstanding hosts. I have been going there for 12 years straight and they have had a number of both aged and handicapped people in camp and they make everything work perfectly. One gentleman had his a special chair that he brought with him and they swapped out the chair in the boat for him. The boats are big wide Alumacraft and Crestliners, 19 footers, so they are a joy to fish out of. In addition, if shore lunch is not your thing out on the lake, the guides can make shore lunch for you at the lodge and 90+% of their fish are caught with 20 minutes of lodge so you can get back rather quickly. Their guides are great, my father is 82 years old and while he does not yet need too much help, I swear the guides spend more time thinking about what they can do for him then I do. They accomodate special requests with a smile. I am lactose-intolerant and they make me a special meal every day and never make me feel bad about the effort. While its a drive in, it is in a pretty remote part of the lake so 80+% of the boats you see are fellow SWWL boats and there will be times when you don't see another boat for hours if that is your wish. The fishing is simply outstanding. The central part of LS does not get the pressure that both ends of the lake due and as such, you can find great fishing almost anytime. Yes, weather might slow you for a day, but I would put LS up against any lake for quality and quantity of walleyes, with nice northerns and bass to boot. Cheers...IA Walleye"
1458948,rather-be-fishin,2012-07-08 00:04:00,429,"Try Fisherman's Cove Resort on Lac Seul. I know they have some handicap cabins right next to the lake with ramps. Their camp boats have pedestal seats. They are a drive to resort just South of Ear Falls, ON. Here is their website: http://lacseulfishermanscove.com/ 20 days to go and counting down to our trip back to Lac Seul!"
1459246,evhawkeye,2012-07-08 17:39:00,7,Thanks for the replys. I think I might drop the resorts an e-mail. Is SWWL worth the price? There website looks great. It is just a little more than we wanted to spend. I guess we normally just do a housekeeping plan. Also is there many steps to worry about. We can do a few here and there but a whole flight is tough. Thanks again
1459257,Guest,2012-07-08 17:59:00,0,"As to SWWL: Steps: None - There is a ramp into the lodge and at to the docks two ramps on the one dock and the other is flat with the ground level. Both docks also float, so no issue with water levels. About half the cabins have steps and the rest have perhaps one or two steps on the landing. Is it worth the price? That depends on each person. Yes, it is more pricey then a number of lodges, but remember, everything is included. Virtually unlimited minnows (not a small thing when some resorts are charging $4+ for a dozen, unlimited gas, a boat that any of us would be happy to own, they allow you to take the boat out in the evening without the guide to see if you learned anything during the day with more minnows!, the staff, guides, and cabins are first rate and the owners are on site to make sure everything is worth it. I have been at a number of resorts in my past, all of which were less expensive, but at SWWL I feel my money is well spent. The price you see is what you pay, unless you buy something like a shirt or a hat. If you want to tip your guide and/or the staff that is up to you. I always hated being at a resort where they count every minnow and half are dead before you get to your first spot, or the dock staff know less about fishing than I do (and that is saying something because I don't know much) or the owner does not respond to an issue you bring up. SWWL takes care of everything. This year my son was stuggling to feel the light hits on his inexpensive pole and the guide pulls out one of his own and puts a $500 rod/reel into his hands and just smiles. It is a little thing, but it makes a trip memorable. It is my vacation, I work very hard all of the year and enjoy a stress free week where the hardest decision I make is to have a beer or a cocktail when I get off the water. The fishing, well that is why we go because great service with poor fishing, well I can get that back home at closer resorts. Lac Suel is special. Lots of fish and lots of big fish. My best is 30.5"", my son's 30.25 and my father has 2 at 29"" all from SWWL. We have been to other resorts, where the pictures of those big fish are old and/or few and far between. Just look at their stats and you can see that they know how to put fish in the boat. Lots of great resorts and to each their own. I am very happy with our choice and wish you the best with your search. From Dubuque, so if you are an IA Hawkeye, all the best. If not, well all the best anyway!. Cheers...IA Walleye"
1459296,evhawkeye,2012-07-08 20:05:00,7,Thank you very much for all your help IA Walleye. Yes we are from Iowa as well. We are about 40 min sw of Iowa City.
1459440,Hawkfan,2012-07-09 08:52:00,237,"Here is a thread from a while back. I didn't go through their website, but right on the front page it advertises the accessibility.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...hlight=Pontoon"
1459461,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-09 09:49:00,1460,"Thanks for finding that old thread Hawkfan. I meant to dig it back up as well. Lots of Hawkeyes on this thread. From reading other posts on this thread, SWWL sounds amazing. I'm not sure that Bear Paw stacks up well against that. I did see their camp and was impressed. Caribou Lake is an excellent fishery, but not the likes of Lac Seul. I'm sure it is much cheaper, however. But for the grace of God go I. I do like the concept of being able to continue to be able to trek north to Ontario fishing, if something were to ever happen to me or my loved ones. http://www.bearpawlodge.net/"
1459483,camp chef,2012-07-09 10:50:00,915,I haven't been there but a friend of mine helped the lodge owner at Bear Paw on Caribou lake in Armstrong build a a handicap accessable cabin this spring that includes an elevator from the cabin down to the dock.
1459917,evhawkeye,2012-07-10 09:05:00,7,Thanks for everybodys help. We are looking into all of them.
