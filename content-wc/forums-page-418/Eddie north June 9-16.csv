I am still unfamiliar with where exactly the outpost is located on Beteau. Is it on the large island....east or west end....north side or south side? (or not on the island at all lol??)

1460572,boelter21,2012-07-12 01:14:00,10,Cant wait until next year will be up there june 1st-8th. It cant come fast enough. Already dreaming of those nice pike!
1460613,rocko0305,2012-07-12 06:55:00,138,"Looks like your group will be coming in as mine is heading out. Have you been to Eddie's before, and how many guys do you have going?"
1460852,Walleye Wanderer,2012-07-12 17:06:00,101,Here's a little something for a laugh while I find time to write a report...http://youtu.be/fIWhKUzm-ac
1460861,new hips,2012-07-12 17:37:00,498,"Rob, that could be the blockbuster of 2012. Needs a little more substance. High Definition or 3d would be good."
1460875,Walleye Wanderer,2012-07-12 18:26:00,101,"More substance! I have more footage but all of it was shot using my new ""hat cam"", best $75 I've spent in a while!"
1460878,5 of Diamonds,2012-07-12 18:31:00,151,That is cool!
1460900,boelter21,2012-07-12 19:38:00,10,this will be our first trip to canada ever. We currently have 4 but hoping to have 6 by then. We have a few guys in our normal group on the fence yet.
1458862,tight line,2012-07-07 17:16:00,37,"We had another great trip to Beteau. Largest NP 44"" largest walleye 27"".Spinner baits and weedless spoons for pike.Jigs and shallow diving crankbaits for walleye. See ya next year Eddie.http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/..._crop_crop.jpghttp://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/...ishman/048.jpghttp://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/...ishman/028.jpghttp://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/.../066_crop3.jpghttp://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/...ishman/016.jpg"
1458870,new hips,2012-07-07 17:44:00,498,Sounds like a great trip......Thanks for the report !Tight Line sent you a PM
1458875,Rich B,2012-07-07 17:55:00,1081,Wow ! That's some kind of fishing trip for trophy northern and walleye action. Nice photos - thanks for sharing - looked like you had good weather for your trip. Rich B
1458884,TIGHTLINER,2012-07-07 18:54:00,223,tightline I will send you a PM later or tomorrow. tightliner
1459033,schandm,2012-07-08 08:25:00,18,Are the walleyes from that little island upriver from the camp after the river turns right? We caught a ton of fish in that river channel but no hogs like that. What a great place to fish. Can't wait til 2013.
1459129,tight line,2012-07-08 11:57:00,37,Not for sure if we are talking the same island but most of our largest walleye were caught in the area I heard referred to as 3 rivers.Its 5 to 6 miles straight north of the camp.The water was way up this spring allowing us to explore areas we couldn't last year which this was one.Its a pretty cool area the islands and small bays create current breaks.Great places to anchor kick back and just catch fish.
1459762,Walleye Wanderer,2012-07-09 21:01:00,101,"Wow, nice fish Rob! Did the Camo help you sneak up on 'em I see a nice rod holder in one of those pics, looks like Eddie is always making improvements ehh! Cheers WW"
1459867,rocko0305,2012-07-10 07:39:00,138,"Nice pictures you have there. Not to hijack your thread, but do you happen to know how successful the guys were who were there the week before you?Do you Eddie North guys find yourself fishing more of the lake or the river system in late May, early June? Been on fly-in trips out of Leuenberger's before (Muskrat, Whitefish, Percy), but not to Eddie's yet. May 25, 2013 can't come soon enough....Thanks for the info."
1459899,wallydave,2012-07-10 08:27:00,2151,"I like wear camo too! Sure I joke about ""sneaking up on em!"" But mostly I shop the end of season sales for gear. Camo hides the blood and slime, saving my jeans for wearing around home. I do wear brightly colored shirts underneath, as a safety measure. If I needed to wave someone down, waving camo might not work!"
1460131,Walleye Wanderer,2012-07-10 20:27:00,101,"Rocko, I was in at Eddie's June 2-9th this year if that's what you were wondering? We had a great week, started a little slow due to changing weather and high water levels but weather did stabilize and the fish turned on just a few pics below, report & more to come.Quote: Originally Posted by wallydaveI like wear camo too!
