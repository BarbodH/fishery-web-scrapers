We generally run down to Mckenzie bay most days the weather allows it and have went as far down as Manitoba point with limited success.I am wondering if any of you ever make the trek down there? and if so is it worth the long boat ride? I read on silver water wheels website about the fantastic fishing down that way from time to time granted they are guides and get to figure them eyes out on a daily basis. I wonder how far that resort is from Manitoba point?"
1461246,BenBeattie,2012-07-13 18:57:00,232,It's about 15 miles from Manitoba point.
1461413,alwaysffb,2012-07-14 10:44:00,42,"Bigtime, I have been going to Fisherman's Cove just south of Ear Falls for 19 years. I'm wondering what kind of boats you fish out of. We don't worry about how many miles or wind/waves in our rigs now but we first started out with 14-16ft camp boats and oh do we have stories. Manitoba Pt is merely a check point now as we (if not fishing Mckenzie, South Bay/Inlet, or Broad/Sunlight) will run south and then either east to Aldous Bay (my fav bay) or West a notch to McIntyre. Just south of Manitoba Pt. is Stoney Pt - awesome in the right wind, outside of McIntyre is Sandpoint Islands, then there's Williams Bay, and so on and so on...It's my absolute favorite part of the lake with literally hundreds of spots that year after year continue to hold fish (south and southeast/west of Manitoba Pt. and Windigo Pt.). PM me if you ever want to chat about Lac Seul. I don't ever recall having a ""bad"" day on that lake. Fished there in snow, hail, 30 degrees, 100 degrees and everything in between and it has remained my favorite lake of all time. I think there ought to be plenty of WC members here who could offer you good info as well. BTW I think I'm going to be there at the same time as you. Last saturday in July - 1st saturday in August. Evan"
