We will be driving from Pittsburgh Pa and are looking for suggestions. I am finding this is popular week and many places are booked even though it is a year out. It is a mixed bunch of guys and many want the American plan wth food provided. We are not opposed to a flight on the back end of the trip and hope to limit driving to 12 hours or so. Naturally we hope to catch many fish. Any and all suggestions welcomed."
1460230,Gary from Iowa,2012-07-11 07:55:00,74,"I haven't fished the Nakina area, east of Lake Nipigon ( a huge, deep lake) but I hear good things from many of regulars on the board such as Bill Krejca and Solopaddler. Do an advanced search for Nakina or even under the names and you should run across some resorts that meet your needs. Of course you can keep driving west and/or north and also find good fishing e.g., LacSeul, a large impoundment with excellent Walleye Fishing. There are too many good lakes and resorts to mention that I would like to fish someday. Good luck with your search.June is a tough month to book, so be prepared to act fast if you find a good opening.Gary"

Even the Wawa area is more than 12 for him. Now if he meant he is willing to fly into an airport by ""a flight on the back end of the trip "" than he would have about a 10 hour drive from the Sault."
1460269,[emailÂ protected],2012-07-11 09:43:00,21,"Being you are in the Pittsburgh area I suggest you drive up through the UP of MI to Chapleau, Ontario. Look up www.fishinglodge.com (Denis) has some outposts, but because you want American Plan I highly suggest you go to his Lodge. Good fishing, very nice lodge, good equipment, and he does his own flying. It will be a good choice."
1460283,villain189,2012-07-11 10:16:00,33,"Lady Evelyn Lake in Eastern Ontario would be about an 11-12 hour drive. That's worth looking into unless you are up for the longer drive to the areas the others above have mentioned. There are 3 American plan camps on Lady Evelyn Lake. Garden Island, Red Pine and Island 10."
1460982,octanehi5,2012-07-13 06:24:00,1104,"I would suggest Air Tamarac, they are a fly to outfitter With camps on the Gouin and Lac Hebert, the latter of witch is one of the finest lakes in Quebec. we just got back sunday and caught 743 walleye 76 pike, biggest pike 46"" #30+lbs. 25 3/4"" walleyes Many over the slot of 20"". I find the the laws are better in Quebec for fishermen. If you like more info E-mail me [email protected] Ron"
1461145,micropterus,2012-07-13 12:35:00,450,I prefer the Garden Island end of the lake. The fishing gets better every year.
