1460174,Guest,2012-07-10 22:37:00,0,Paradise cove has great cabins 4 bedrooms 2 full baths screen porch. Good location great price per person. The owner however in my opinion does not care at all if you are happy or catching any fish. Not the friendliest guy. Do I go back often yes do I expect any sort of appreciation from Duane **** for my business no
1460200,jignminow,2012-07-11 06:45:00,168,"Barbers Resort!!!! Peter and his wife Traut (yes, pronounced Trout) are great people and very helpful with fishing information. The cabins are very nice, clean and up to date. Paradise Cove is way too big in my opinion. It is like a small city. Barbers is nice and quiet and laid back. Each cabin has its own dock so you don't have to share with a bunch of other boats all trying to get in or out at the same time......look them up!"
1460222,Slashorn,2012-07-11 07:47:00,19,We like Bayview Lodge and going there this friday for a saturday check in. Brian and Kay are great hosts and the view of the sunset is amazing.
