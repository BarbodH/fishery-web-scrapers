I've seen these symptoms before, it is not a terminal condidtion thanks to modern treatments. As a health care professional, I would gladly offer my services to you for this trip. My fees are most reasonable. I would however need to be with you the boat and cabins to monitor your case!!"

In a few days when your head its the pillow you will feel the gentle rocking after getting your ""sea legs"" back! Catch some for us back home! Have a great trip!!"
