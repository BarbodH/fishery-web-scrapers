We usually fish out around Shore Island and down to Brule inlet for Northern, walleye and Muskie. However this is a month later than our normal trip time so I will be out of my comfort zone and with the entire family... 4 kids in one boat! Thanks for any info you care to share."
1460757,Lazy Fisherman,2012-07-12 12:00:00,276,Just returned from Sioux Narrows. Fishing was good. We usually fish July and what we did before was still working this year. Plenty of Walleye to be caught in 25 - 35 foot of water. It was definitely warm on the water. Temps were in the 80's most everyday.
1460874,eyeman_1,2012-07-12 18:25:00,690,"I was out of Wiley Point last week and the fishing was on fire along with the temps. Walleyes were deeper than normal and the best depths were 16-26' and deeper where the rock reefs met the soft bottom transition. Fish were up shallow if there were lower light conditions, but the majority and bigger fish were deeper. The fish were eating mayflies still hatching off the mud. We didn't jig at all, but bottom bounced crawlers and spinners or leeches and spinners all week and were kept very busy. Best colors for spinners were gold, and silver during bright days and lime green and pink on lower light days.....although they were infrequent while we were there.... it was freaking hot. We only fished mornings till noon and from six to dark.... we had an 8yr old who needed to be out of the boat for some play time and play in the water mid day. We also needed to cool down after shore lunch. He did well considering he'd not been on a guys fishing trip before. Pike, especially larger fish were also on rock and off the deep humps. We did manage some fish in the weeds or weed edges. We caught the bigger fish on #4 & 5 size Mepps and regular size Buchertails, and on crankbaits cast off the weed edges of the humps. Smaller Suicks were working well for my buddy while I cast bucktails or an occasional XRap. Smallies were off the banks in 6 - 15' of water on crankbaits or jigs w/grubs.. Also took a 45"" ski on a crawfish jointed shad rap on 6# test....that was a hoot. Several smallies were burping crawfish as we landed them. Skie's were definately on rocks and although we had numerous follows, I only hooked one larger fish in the low 50's on a Buchertail. Lost that fish on the third pass alongside the boat.... most powerful fish I've ever had on muskie fishing... she was a horse. My buddy swears it was the biggest musky he'd ever seen....all I know is I had the shakes for a while after that. There are plentiful jumbo perch to be had and we caught a good number fishing for walleyes. They all appeard to be worm free and if we'd have thought about it we'd have kept some for shore lunch..... next year. All in all another great trip despite the heat.... never been up there when it was that hot for that long.... Thank God the lodge has AC and the cabins have AC too.... great trip and a nice experience for the youngster"

Start between 18'-25' on mid lake reefs that top out at about that depth. Troll til you find fish then throw a buoy. Start north of calendar and Chisholm. You'll find them, bigger seems better. If the wind is blowing you can fish 4-9 on top of shallower reefs with cranks (glass 6-8 shad raps). Say hello to Elaine-Albert and the boys."
1461003,DMella,2012-07-13 07:13:00,32,Great info!I will definately say hello to the family for you. They run such a great camp and are so open and willing to help. My four kids are 12 to 7yo so I can appreciate the needs of an 8yo in the boat. We take frequent beach stops to eat - explore - etc. I like to take them to places like Knickerbocker to catch lots of smaller pike but tons of action! My oldest son caught a couple big walleyes there two years ago also... he is pictured in the Tomohawk web site beaming holding a 28 incher (released as always)The family and I cant wait to go I just hope I can outfish my wife... she has been killing me for years now and the kids are letting me have it.
