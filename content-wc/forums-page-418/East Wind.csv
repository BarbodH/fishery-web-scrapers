1460580,Bill Krejca,2012-07-12 05:09:00,6107,"The fish seem to like about any wind. With an east wind,you just have to fish in different places than, say, with a south wind. I've had some terrific fishing with an east wind, sometimes way out in the middle of nowhere (in the wind). Bill Krejca"
1460677,octanehi5,2012-07-12 08:44:00,1104,"It is true that the east wind is the least bite, but if you follow the rules of fish the shores were the wind is blowing into in deep water you will catch wally, your normal spots will be very slow until the wind direction changes.another thing do not leave fish to find fish. pay attention to the wind and you will catch fish"
1460689,Ogoki,2012-07-12 09:13:00,291,"I have been on 35 fly-in trips , plus numerous drive -in trips along with fishing on my Onatrio bear hunts . The only wind that I do not like to see is a COLD ,NORTHEAST wind . I think that wind is associated with fronts moving thru . That wind has slowed the fishing down for us ."
1460801,Dogbreath,2012-07-12 14:05:00,494,"""Time spent fishing cannot be deducted from your life"". I think it's some kind of law or something - get out there......"
1460180,IA JOE,2012-07-11 04:44:00,35,For those of us fishing around Ear Falls next week (Sun-Wed) looks to have an East wind. (Wind from the East fish bite the least) Any tips on how to fish during a 3-4 day 5-10 mph East wind or how the walleyes might respond to this type of weather pattern?
1460189,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-11 05:59:00,235,"Not sure the impact of that wind, but the forecast I saw last week had practically no wind (highest was 7km per hour). Also going to be high 80's. If that is the case, I am expecting tough fishing. I would take an east wind over no wind."
1460190,Golden Eagle,2012-07-11 06:03:00,2642,East wind with a bluebird sky has been a problem for me. East wind that lasts for more than one day and comes with a cloudy sky has not been a problem.
1460217,wallydave,2012-07-11 07:36:00,2151,"One year in early June we had a couple days of east winds. At the mouth of the Wenasga river it must have been the time of year, the flow into the Lac and the wind driven waves. It was one fat healthy walleye after another!! 2008 early July warm and windy, the best bite was along windy points fishing the edges of stained waters. Pike and walleyes were active. Good luck!"
1460250,cuamb,2012-07-11 08:42:00,203,Just fish the windy points and bays. We have had some really good days with an east wind on Lac Seul. The only poor days we ever have is when there in no wind and clear sky.
1460278,Jigger1,2012-07-11 10:03:00,234,"Agreed, have had some fantastic days for both size and volume after sustained east winds. Variable wind direction or no wind presents the challenge as to where to find an active bite."
1460293,TIGHTLINER,2012-07-11 10:46:00,223,When I was younger I fished almost everyday I met a elder person at that time and got to know him very well. One day while sitting on the dock I said to him Happy they are calling for a east wind tomorrow so I probably will not be down to fish. His reply to me was this ( I have never caught a fish in the wind yet always in the water ) you better not pass up tomorrow. With that I got up the next morning and went fishing and sure enough there was Happy saving me a spot and oh yes we did catch perch just like we had done before. Respect your elders and listen to the wisdom they have gathered over the years.
1460307,campchick,2012-07-11 11:20:00,96,Lucky you! An east wind is great. The pressure change stirs the fish up and they bite. Beats a south wind for sure. If it rains it will even be better.
1460336,Mohleye,2012-07-11 12:31:00,368,"I'm leaving in the morning for NW Ont, and with the highs in the 80's to 90, I hope there is some breeze from any direction, not only for the fishing, but to help keep the cabin a little cooler."
1460436,IA JOE,2012-07-11 16:24:00,35,"Temps are to change to the low 80s and possibly high 70s by the 15th - 20th. I have been following wunderground for Ear Falls. Glad to hear that an East wind is not so bad but the winds are to be light by Monday. Light rain forcast for 7/12-7/15. The wife, son and I leave at 2 am on Friday and should be fishing by Saturday afternoon. Any news on the amount of water flow between the bridge and the dam on Lac Seul?"
