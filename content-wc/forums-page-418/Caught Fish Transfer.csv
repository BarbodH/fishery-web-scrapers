We left yesterday morning with frozen fish, had them on ice all day/night yesterday and just arrived back in Indy. What do i do now? Can I put them in the freezer or will they get freezer burn after thawing out slightly? If not, how long will they last in the fridge before I should cook them? We just had so much Walleye i wouldn't mind waiting until next week to cook them up. Any advice is appreciated. I'll also type up a trip report later and post it."

1461153,IndyTgrFan,2012-07-13 12:46:00,6,b/c they probably aren't thawed all of the way through. Are you saying the cold water acts as a protective barrier from the freezer burn/ice crystals that will form otherwise?
