It was a totally different experience. Margaret and Bill Lewis are top class owners. The resort is amazing! Rooms were very, very clean, fishing was the best I have ever experienced and I would highly recommend.Margaret had a campfire going for the guests each night, keeps a freezer full of ice cream for the kids and baked us Rhubarb pie and death by chocolate cake. Now that is service!My daughter caught a 42 inch musky, 40 inch pike and a 27 inch walleye. Give them a try."

We are heading up there for a few days 7/31-8/3 before we head up to our usual week at another camp. congrats on the great catches that your daughter got. We will primarily be fishing for musky. Bill and Margaret seem really really nice. can't wait!!"
