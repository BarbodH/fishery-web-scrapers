1460655,1860Angler,2012-07-12 08:13:00,2642,"I use a double bank tally counter, one is for fish in the livewell and the other is for fish that that are released, we only keep track of walleyes. I mainly got it to keep track of the ones in the livewell so we're not having to count them constantly, and found the one that has two counters in one, and thought that would be good for keeping track of throw backs as well. I labeled each one so that nobody get's confused. At the end of the day I log the numbers into my iPhone so I will always have something to compare it to the next year.http://www.tallycounterstore.com/Pro...roductCode=014"
1460155,Nimstug,2012-07-10 21:16:00,2605,"My son and I keep an informal count based on location or for the day. We keep track by saying: ...we caught a few ...we caught some ...we caught a bunch ...we caught a boatload ...we caught a buttload I don't recall how we define each category. NimstugLike I said, it's informal."
1460280,Jigger1,2012-07-11 10:07:00,234,"If it weren't for the guide writing them down, no way I would be counting. I'd lose track after the first 30 minutes!"
1460406,Guest,2012-07-11 15:08:00,0,I've never thought of a good reason to count them in the first place.
1460408,rocko0305,2012-07-11 15:12:00,138,"Like I mentioned before, our group liked to count them to see how we stacked up versus all of the other inscriptions and makeshift plaques on the walls from other groups claimed how they did. With that said, it wasn't like it was a big hassle or anything to keep track of it, and it actually facilitates what we plan on doing the next time we go, which will involve some sort of daily or evening gambling based on amount of fish, total inches, etc.Now for the guys who use clickers to make sure they don't miscount a single fish, that may be a little much for even myself."
1460417,KEEBOY,2012-07-11 15:32:00,61,"We use the Bass Pro Crappie counters also. One for walleye, one for northern and one for the livewell. It can be difficult to count a livewell full of fish so you don't accidentally go over your limit. We also like to keep track of numbers for our annual log book we keep. Its always fun to go back through the book and see how we did. We keep numbers of fish as well as all kinds of other info that we can go back and read."

1460483,5richards,2012-07-11 18:40:00,131,"Some of these posts ""scare"" me I have OC people in my family --- I know what your garage looks like and you know where every tool is!!!! It's OK and we all are outrageously different and it makes the world go round!!!!! I can't find a tape measure in my house --- and I know I have at least 6 --- nor can I find a pair of handy pliers!!! I've bought in --- next year I'm hanging an indelible marker around my neck and I am going to mark my ""lower unit"" for every Walleye we catch. This is all meant in fun --- no offense --- count away!!!! I don't presently have my own boat. go figure"
1460493,Lund1993,2012-07-11 19:14:00,141,If only my fish count was as high as my golf score.
1460495,Davey two fish,2012-07-11 19:17:00,6,"Jeepman' Berkly makes clickers now. I have seen them at fleet farm and scheels. Golf clickers work good too. I don't care for them because my buddy always wants to be strokes and I end up putts. Sounds like putz, plus he always sings Billy Squire stroke me stroke me ever time he catches a fish."
1460518,Walleye Wanderer,2012-07-11 20:08:00,101,"I'm with Rocko on this one and there is quite a bit of WW pine around the camps of northern Ontario. Counting is easy, size is a little more tricky for the prize as fish seem to grow by an inch or so sometimes"
1459864,rocko0305,2012-07-10 07:36:00,138,"Been on a few fly-in trips to Northern Ontario, and the last time we went to Percy Lake in July 2010 was the only time we kept a count, of both walleyes, pike, and jumbo perch. We liked doing it so much, that I imagine we will continue to try and do it for every trip going forward.All we did was just have one guy be responsible for asking every boat what their tally was. Usually one count was done in the morning, and another in the evening. If someone went out for a quick afternoon fish, then we would tally that too. Like someone else mentioned, we sometimes argued whether it was 41 or 42 fish, but our count was 95% accurate by week's end.I think by the end of the week at Percy, our 8 man group totaled about 820 walleyes, 275 pike, and 100 perch. Not bad for early July."
1459871,5richards,2012-07-10 07:45:00,131,"To each his own We don't count Walleye other than the number on the stringer for dinner. Sure we know when we've hit a good spot and caught them non-stop but then we'd just estimate and then exaggerate like any fisherman when talking to relatives. The only fish we do count is the Pike north of 40 inches --- that ""counts"" in our book."
1459912,Pikehunters,2012-07-10 08:55:00,100,"Use a strip about 6"" long mark squares for Pike & Wally's. Keep a sharpie marker handi & every 5th fish give out a hollar SLASH!! Good way to rub it in at the dock at the end of the day & easy to count. If you keep covering up the previous days catch than at the end of the week it's an easy pull off with no mess."
1459981,davenathe,2012-07-10 12:25:00,113,"With ya, our group does not count, unless on a spot see which boat gets to a number first for bragging rights, example race to 30. Personnally not a fan of counting want to relax and enjoy the experience and feel bad if one guy is being outfished, especially if me."
1459984,rocko0305,2012-07-10 12:32:00,138,One of the reasons we started counting for the first time on our last trip is so we could make one of these to match the countless others scattered around the cabin. Designed by yours truly.
1459997,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-10 13:18:00,1460,Really nice workmanship Rocko. What's the backstory? Do you leave it in camp? Tell us more.
1460058,3M TA3,2012-07-10 16:38:00,2846,"Yea, well 2 times nuttin is still nuttin."
1460114,rocko0305,2012-07-10 19:50:00,138,"Well, my uncles and dad have been on 10+ Ontario fly-in fishing trips, but the first time we ever made one of these driftwood plaques to leave in the cabin was on Muskrat Lake out of Leuenberger's when I was 12. I vaguely remember drawing a walleye or pike on a piece of wood and also listing our biggest pike and walleye that year.Fast forward to 2010, which was the last time our group went on a fly in trip, and we decided a tally of all the fish and wildlife we saw, as well as list our biggest fish. The cabin on Percy Lake is covered in markings, as well as a few plaques, so we decided to ""one up"" everyone and add a picture of a walleye and some old jigs we had from the trip. I hope it's still hanging there prominently over the kitchen table like how it was when we left.I imagine we will be doing the same type of thing again on Beteau Lake come May 2013 if Eddie should let us. Glad you liked it though, as it took me a couple of hours to create."
1460126,10point,2012-07-10 20:06:00,102,I bought a crappie counter at bass pro for like $4. Its a clicker that goes to 9999. We click it every fish we catch.
1460128,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-10 20:22:00,1460,Very cool Rocko! Thanks for expounding. It's been my experience that fly-in fishermen do respect others shrines and camp beautifications.
1459650,SinOrSwim,2012-07-09 16:47:00,1528,"Okay, we have tried many O' times to try and count our fish and have never been able to accurately. We start out thinking we will and then forget about it. Maybe we don't care or maybe we don't have the discipline or desire to write stuff down. But, I see trip reports with what are seemingly very accurate numbers.How do you keep track? Seems like a lot of work especially when I see numbers pushing 1000."
1459668,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-07-09 17:35:00,138,"SWAG, then double it just to make sure. We found this to be the most accurate method."
1459696,Golden Eagle,2012-07-09 18:43:00,2642,"I usually shoot for a ton of fish in a week and hit the mark about half the time. May is a slam dunk, but the rest of the season is a little tough sometimes."
1459716,Rich B,2012-07-09 19:41:00,1081,Now that's funny........cause I swear that's how some of my buddies get their counts ! Rich
1459747,pan-man,2012-07-09 20:42:00,299,"My friends/family think I am nuts but I screwed 3 clickers on 2x4 with carpeting. The first clicker is for any fish caught in the boat over 12""'s (walleye, bass, northern or perch). The second clicker is for any walleye over 20"", bass over 16"" and northern over 25"" I consider these fish 'quality' fish. Last clicker is for keeping track of the fish I catch myself.Clickers are the only way to keep an honest count and helps to determine which spots are better. Between fishing, clicking, controlling boat, and keeping track of everyone; I have very little time to eat or drink (which I do running from spot to spot)."

1459824,Jeepman,2012-07-10 06:26:00,386,"My friends/family think I am nuts but I screwed 3 clickers on 2x4 with carpeting. - What kind of ""clickers"" are these and were did you get them? Jeepman"
1459839,nd89sc88,2012-07-10 06:44:00,92,"Having just gotten back from first trip to Lac Seul, I can tell you that my fishing partner and I simply kept track of total walleyes in the boat. We did it by memory and as a team, sometimes debating if it was the 27th or 28th fish, but generally felt we were reasonably accurate. At the end of the day, we did write down our daily total and then added them to get to our 147 five days on the water. Granted, our number wasn't particularly high, but it worked ok for us. Not sure how I would do it with some of the enormous numbers I see here, but the counting was part of the fun for us. Bill"
1459843,tv4fish,2012-07-10 06:57:00,2694,"Jeepman: The ""clickers"" that I have are the round ""lap counters"" that some runners use. They have a little ""push bar"" that you push to increase the number. I have mine mounted on a thin metal bar that is then mounted on the inside of my boat. Very handy and easy to use. We ONLY keep count of the ""important"" fish (Walleyes, of course. I used a label maker to label the 3 counters on the metal strip - 1 is ""under slot"" - 1 is ""in slot"" and the other is ""over slot"". We fish Lac Seul and the slot is 18""-21"". It's been interesting to track the differences in the numbers through the years since the slot has been in existence. Pretty darn cheap and they have lasted for over 20 years. The way we do it is - you catch a fish - it's your job to hit the correct clicker - At the end of the day - we record our counts in our log book and then reset the counters for the next time. http://www.amazon.com/Champion-Sport...ds=lap+counter"
1459850,Bigstorm,2012-07-10 07:10:00,799,"We use clickers for golfers, works great for your daily total. If you wanted to track the total for the week, you would need to wrtie down each days total and add it up at the end, way too much work for me. I just like to try and catch more each day that I did on the previous day.Sometimes gambling gets involved, who caught the most fish o na given day or simple things like that. Without the clicker, we would be lost after 10 fish"
