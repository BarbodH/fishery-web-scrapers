What are some favorite Pike Lures people like to use that time of year (not that I need to make another trip to Cabelas or Bass pro, but....); favorite types of water to fish. 22 days until departure, can't wait."
1460695,jambi,2012-07-12 09:20:00,504,Assuming you will be fishing some deeper water this time of year? Last year most pike were caught trolling 12-20'. We tried some shallower weed lines but not much around....Did best on spoons - Williams Wabler (gold/silver) & Dr Spoon walleye pattern. Really well on jointed J-13s and xrap xr12s too. Have a great trip!

1460813,dutchboy,2012-07-12 14:36:00,5717,"I like jointed Raps and also large rattle traps. If I'm doing spoons it's 1oz. Five of Diamonds or..............well there is no or, it's Five Of Diamonds."
1460839,lcwhit,2012-07-12 16:25:00,104,"by brother in law and brother always go in that timeframe to lac seul. they always fish pike. always fish shallow weeds regardless of weather. always use #4 or 5 mepps spinners. i'm not sure they have anything else in their tackle boxes. they always get lots of pike and some 40+inchers and usually pick off some nice walleyes this way. i don't fish for the slimey buggers, but this is my observation."
1461019,tsquared,2012-07-13 07:32:00,57,"the shallow weeds tend to be my tactic too, with similar results. Always interested in broadening the horizons, so good to see some of the other lures and techniques too."
1461037,downriverbob,2012-07-13 08:11:00,880,"The biggest pike I have caught the past few years in Lake of the Woods have been caught while trolling deep diving crankbaits. Some that lures that dive over 25' have producted many over 40"". There have been times that I have been using planner boards and have the entire board pulled underby monster pike. BOB"
1461475,unclejoe,2012-07-14 14:43:00,22,Slop master on sunny day with some moderate chop/wind in the ugliest weeds you can find so long as cabbage is part of the gumbo mix
1461669,Tinyfish,2012-07-15 08:36:00,16,Just got back from east of lake nipigon. Mepps and bluefox spinners size 4-5-6 undressed killed the pike on four different pike lakes. My favorite was bluefox size 5-6 silver blade chartruce body my fishing partner was using a red blade not sure the body colour. Mepps 5 red/white blade did well also. All the spinners were mid depth spinners. We caught a bunch of pike when trolling worm harness's with a bottom bouncer when looking for walleye. The darker beads on the harness's worked best like a black/purple pearl finish with a larger blade.
