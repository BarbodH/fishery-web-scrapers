1461652,jimash2,2012-07-15 07:49:00,16,"Hi Mel from Jim. You might consider sending me an email ([email protected]). We could then consider talking by phone to discuss my experiences for the last sever years at Deer Horn. I have a boat but no longer take it into Canada. The 18 mile gravel road is not a road that I would like to pull my boat on. Infact we go very slow with just a vehicle. However, I have seen much worse gravel roads. I love fishing Cabonga. We do fish within a mile or two from the camp. Most of the time we travel a few miles from the camp. What might be good fishing to me may not be for you. If we talked by phone, I could give you a good idea of what to expect."
1226079,jimash2,2010-08-08 19:16:00,16,"My son Mike and I will be at DHL for 5 days, Aug 14-18. If someone is currently at DHL or has recently been there, I would welcome any insite regarding the walleye fishing and low water challenges. If anyone is planning to be there during our stay, it would be nice to say hello. We are currently assigned to cabin #9 and use a DHL small boat. This is my 10th trip to DHL starting in 2005. I experienced some great walleye and pike fishing in 2005 and 2006. Later trips have been a bit more challenging. I was at DHL by myself for 5 days, May 21-25. On opening day, I caught 8 walleyes (5 at 20-21 in). I only caught 4 more the remaining 4 days. I only caught a few pike (1 at 3 lb and 1 at 5 lb). Hopefully with 2 lines and being a little smarter, we can do better this trip. If there is an interest, I can provide an update as to how our fishing went. We will have a lap top along, and I could possibly provide an update or so while at DHL. Jim"
1226323,eatsleepfish,2010-08-09 15:05:00,52,"The fishing should be great because the low water will really concentrate the fish. That is what we found when we were there mid July. However, the low water will be a challenge. It's about 9 feet down from the norm. I have been tracking it on my blog: http://eatsleepfish.blogspot.com/ We managed to hit strike rocks twice on our trip with the prop but the prop wasn't as bad as we thought it could have been. According to the Ottawa water authority, when we were there it was 7 feet down and now they are saying it's 9 feet down! I think in 1999 or 2000 it was down that low but back then we used the boats from the camp and didn't really go that far where we would notice the water that low, nor did we even have a depth finder where we would care. Regardless, it will be some great Walleye Fishing. Take lots of pictures if you can and feel free to shoot them to me (eatsleepfish[at]gmail[dot]com) and I will post them on my blog."
1227004,jimash2,2010-08-11 18:20:00,16,"Hi eatsleepfish,Thanks for responding. Also thanks for the WC posts you have made on you and your dad's last trip. I also enjoyed the great photos and information on your blog. I will definitely provide you some photos of our trip. At minimum, I plan to update this thread with a summary of our trip.Thanks Jim"
1228063,eatsleepfish,2010-08-16 05:47:00,52,"Jim, how's the fishing up there?"
1228263,jimash2,2010-08-16 18:43:00,16,Walleye fishing is pretty slow. Fished for walleye the first 2 days. Caught 6 walleyes each day. Tried for pike in Wagoose today and never saw a pike. The first 2 days we fished in Burns bay and also near Fog Island. Going back to Burns bay tomorrow for both Walleye and Pike.
1229918,jimash2,2010-08-23 11:29:00,16,"Hi eatsleepfish,I have generated this report since returning home. When replying to your entry at the camp I didn't get the fish count quite right. Just wasn't thinking. I will also eventually sort out a few photos and send them to you.JimCABONGA FALL 2010 REPORTJim and son Mike fished at DHL for 5 days, Aug. 14 – 18, 2010. We used a DHL boat with a 15 HP motor. The water being so low is a real shocker and drastically changes how one fishes and navigates the lake. My understanding is the lake is about 8-9 ft. below normal. It appears the dams are now closed and no more water will be taken from the lakes. No one seems to know what the future will be regarding the lake level. Having a shore lunch is one thing that we enjoy very much; this is our main daily meal. Catching a couple walleye the first morning is our first goal and we were successful. We then bring out walleye ready for the pan on subsequent days. We use a Coleman stove and our menu is pretty simple: Fried fish and potatoes; string beans; canned fruit; bread with jam/tomatoes. We had 5 great shore lunches.The weather was very accommodating and comfortable. Most days were cloudy and one day we had some rain during the day. We also had a fair amount of wind; better than a bunch of hot still days.The fishing could have been much better, but we had a great time.Sat. Aug. 14: We fished South of DHL near Fog Island and further South. Caught 4 walleyes, so we had fish for our first shore lunch. Later in afternoon we went to Burn’s bay/Langevin Lake area and picked up one more walleye. Also cast for pike a bit with no success. In the evening we fished around what I call Indian Island, which is the island East of DHL that you can see from DHL. We caught 3 small walleyes. So for the day we had 8 walleyes.Sun. Aug. 15: We went back to the Fog Island area and caught 9 walleyes. We caught another 3 in the evening near Indian Island. Total for the day was 12 walleyes.Mon. Aug. 16: With the water so low, Gary the guide suggested we try Wagoose for pike. With the low water, one can just make it into Wagoose. We did a lot of casting with spoons and never got a pike or even a follow, just a sucker or two. We ate our shore lunch on the way back to camp and some casting for pike along the way. In the evening we tried Indian Island again for walleye, with no success. It was pretty windy, so we didn’t stay at it long. No fish caught today, bummer.Tues. Aug. 17: We tried for pike again. This time we fished in Burns bay and Mike’s bay. We caught 4 small pike in Mike’s bay. Later in the afternoon we fished for walleye and caught 12 walleyes (most pretty small) just East of point on Menard Island (23 ft. of water). Total for the day was 12 walleyes and 4 pike.Wed. Aug. 18: We went back to Fog Island area and caught 6 walleyes and later back to Burns bay where we caught 3 more. All these walleyes were on the small side. We also did a bit of casting for pike with no luck. Total for the day was 9 walleyes.We brought home 12 walleyes and 4 of them were pretty small. The largest walleye we caught was 20 inches. We also kept the 4 pike we caught; they were small (2 to 2.5 lbs.). I made our reservation the first week of August. I sent an email to DHL and shortly got a call from Sebastien. I was surprised that it was not Steve. I found Sebastien communicated quite well. I found him very helpful and friendly. I was thinking Steve would be available the rest of the season and probably well into next season. Steve was not at the camp during our stay. It looks to me like Steve will probably no longer be involved with the camp??It looks like the low water is all ready affecting the camp. It appears that a significant amount of cancellations have occurred for the remainder of the season. The coming winter will have to have a lot of snow or it looks like the camp will be in serious problem. Even for me, which does not fish trout or go into the big waters, the fishing is not the same with the low water."
1229932,eatsleepfish,2010-08-23 12:10:00,52,"Water depth can be cyclical, however, a lot depends on winter snow melt. Last winter, they said they got no snow - that is bad - so the reservoir probably wasn't at capacity. The real problem with the low water is the accessibility but the fishing was pretty good when we were there. Your week, the rez was down another 2 feet. It would be interesting to see pictures from Wa Wa pass and other places with such low water."
1230309,jimash2,2010-08-24 15:14:00,16,"Hi eatsleepfish,My son Mike did the picture taking. I sorted out some of the photos and placed them on my picasa web site:http://picasaweb.google.com/James.AshbaughWe did not go to Wawa pass. Maybe some of the other photos will be interesting to you. Let me know if you have questions or problems accessing the photos."
1230958,eatsleepfish,2010-08-27 05:49:00,52,Do you mind if I download some those pictures and put them up as a comparison between my trip and yours?
1230973,jimash2,2010-08-27 07:11:00,16,No problem!
