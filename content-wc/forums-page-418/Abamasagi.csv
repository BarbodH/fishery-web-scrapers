It is a fantastic lake...a walleye factory!. Water was fairly high to start our trip but dropped 1ft or more in a week. Im sure it is down even more. Are you with TLO or Osullivans? Either way it shld be a great trip. good luck"
1460725,mroyle,2012-07-12 10:21:00,74,Have been to Ara several times but first trip to Aba. Going with TLO in cabin #3 up in the arm. Looking for a good map/spots. Any ideas?
1460828,gmattbruin,2012-07-12 15:23:00,174,"Best place 2be on this big lake, we think anyways. In the arm there are many places to go if the main lake gets nasty. I will assume your cabin or Chad will have a map for you with some hotspots. We like to go thru the 2 narrow spots that take you from your cabin to the right up into a couple bodies of water. During Jun we are fishing points,shorelines,beginings of weedbeds,etc. You might have to find some humps in deeper water though with different temps. Main body of the lake, we found the islands always produce,edge of some weedbeds. Again im sure there will be maps in the cabins from the previous groups."
