4022650,redryder,2015-07-05 09:00:00,33,"Thanks Kzoo. I had camped at The Shoals Provincial park campground across the highway from Windermere a few years ago and the guys fishing that lake said it was aptly named. Windermere looks about the same but much bigger. Pretty remote area and not a lot of any kind of traffic. Seem to remember some bible type camps around those parts also. I think the last time I was by The Shoals campground it was closed. Not sure if it ever reopened, but I doubt it seeing as how Ontario is so broke."

4077306,Shellback,2015-07-26 13:03:00,8083,"Just got back from Happy Day lodge. I'll make this a 2 part post. First part about Happy Day, and the next about fishing. When looking for a camp, I informed them my wife was handicapped, and had some concerns about their facilities. They pretty much assured me everything would be okay. Prior to making my booking there in May, I was told there were no cabins available, but they did have a 5th wheel camper available. That sounded fine to me as most 5th wheels are pretty nice. So we booked the trip. After our deposit was made, I was informed that they didn't want the toilet or shower used in the camper due to the need for pumping it out. Use of the toilet at night was okay. Hmmm, that didn't make me too happy, if you are renting a trailer, then the need to pump is a given. Especially when they knew my wife was handicapped. Upon our arrival, we were shown the camper. My wife's private comment to me was, "" where did they get this abandoned camper for us to stay in?"" Needless to say it was rather old and in sore need of some maintenance. I had previously asked for pictures of the camper but was told they were no longer available because this was the last year they were renting it. I guess that should have been a heads up for me. It was probably as clean as you could expect a camper that was most likely 10 to 15 years old. Soft spots in the floor, a wedge supplied to keep the fridge shut etc. Overall, it was suitable and I have stayed in much worse. My biggest beef is that we were charged the same fee per person as those that had cabins, which were very nice. Kinda like booking a Holiday Inn and then putting you in the Motel 8 next door for the same price. It had been an 1100 mile, 20 hour drive for the wife and I, so rather than rock the boat, I decided to make the best of it. They do have some very nice cabins, and they were accommodating to my few requests, but overall I believe they should have had adjusted prices for the 5th wheels which were no way in the class of the cabins. The trip was very long for us and I knew I'd never be returning, so rather than make any issues and possibly have some hard feelings between us. I kept my dissatisfaction to myself. I have my own 2013 slide in truck camper, and if prior to booking I knew we were not to use the 5th wheel facilities, I would have brought my own comfortable and clean slide in, and saved about $70 a day to boot! If you are booking a cabin, I think you will be very satisfied, if they try to sell you on a 5th wheel, make sure they adjust the price. Bottomline, the overall experience was okay, and if they were within a 10 hour drive, I would probably give them another try if they had a cabin for us, or return with our own camper."
4077330,Shellback,2015-07-26 13:19:00,8083,"Now for the fishing report. Upon arrival other folks reported the fishing had been slow. That's the story of my life, so no surprise there. The first 4 days were very windy, with wind forecasts to 40K. I had mentioned my wife was handicapped so we mostly troll, and vertical jigging would have been not possible anyhow. The fishing was slow as had been reported, but we did find some fish. The wife got a 27.5, 22.5 and 19 inch walleyes. Needless to say she was very happy. The 27.5 qualified for some type of award I think. Any quality walleye eluded me, but I did catch a couple eaters for dinner. I also caught a 32.5 pike which also qualified for an award or something too. We did have a mix of small walleye, bass and a small pike. For our first time there, being limited to my wife's abilities, and not so good weather, I think we did okay. I would like to give it another try, but the 2200 mile, 42 hour round trip, leaves that prospect unlikely. There's lots of good fishing within a days drive, so I'll keep closer to home. For those still heading to Windermere this year, good luck. PS. I did see 2 moose and one wolf on the gravel road the morning I left. I think they were the first I've seen in the wild."
4095601,quickster2,2015-08-02 08:09:00,41,"My wife & I spent 10 days there the 8 thru the 18th. We had 6 friends and relatives there for a week as well. Fishing was tougher than last year for walleye but much better for bass & pike. No 30"" walleye this year. We caught and ate fish every day and took our limit home. We caught a lot of 13 to 14"" and then many above the 18"" limit. All excellent eaters at that size. Unlike last year where trolling caught lots of walleye this year we jigged (once we marked fish) and casted to banks with Rapalas early and late. We camp in our truck camper along with our friend and his wife. We had two sets of relatives stay in both of the 5th wheels. The 5th wheels are getting a little old but they are better than a tent. We also had bear issue in camp which made us secure all food stuffs inside the truck each night. Great place with excellent hosts will go back again and again. 2nd year in a row for us. We'll skip next year to go back to Namakan Lake in western Ontario."
4006274,quickster2,2015-06-28 18:02:00,41,"Any reports? Going in 10 days for 10 days will catch the new moon phase. Any water level reports, temperature, fishing reports? Thanks"
4006474,Shellback,2015-06-28 19:01:00,8083,I'm heading there on the 18th. Please mark some x's on the water in productive spots.
4006906,kzoofisher,2015-06-29 03:42:00,5144,"Shellback, I heard that one spot with the rocks was producing. Seriously, I'm not headed until August but any info would be great. Last year I took Mr Simon's advice and kept moving and trying different water until we found fish. Once we found them the pattern was pretty easily repeated and it held until the weather changed. Once it changed we eliminated that pattern and looked for a new one. They weren't super secret patterns either. Humps with access to deep water, wind blown points and funnels between islands, weedy shorelines near boulders and breaks, boulder fields. The tough part is separating out the points or humps that slope too gently/not gently enough etc. An eagle eye on the electronics helps a lot."
4007594,MrSimon,2015-06-29 08:55:00,922,"I might have told this story before, but oh well. We bumped into a fellow who has been living on an island in Windermere every summer for 30 years and knows the lake better than anyone else alive. He thinks of the lake as a puzzle and likes to search for what he calls fish magnets. Essentially they are premium structures that always hold fish. He has over 100 of these spots marked on his map. He took us out fishing for about an hour one afternoon and made believers of us. We visited three of his spots and like clockwork they all produced impressively. The game is to find which spot that day is holding the big fish. When you fish Windermere, one of three things usually happens:You poke around the lake just randomly fishing and do OK - you leave thinking it's a beautiful lake with just ok fishingYou watch your electronics and fish good looking structure and do well - you leave thinking it's a beautiful lake with lots of fishYou locate a few of these magic spots - you never leave"
4007778,kzoofisher,2015-06-29 10:13:00,5144,"Was that Mr. Allnott? I heard he was quite ill and couldn't make it up last year. Great guy. We have a couple spots called Allnott's; east, west."
4007962,MrSimon,2015-06-29 11:11:00,922,"I never knew his last name. If it's the same guy, I hope he gets better soon."
4022306,quickster2,2015-07-05 06:41:00,41,I'll be sure to mark some spots with a big X. This will be our second trip and look forward to fishing some of the water on the way to the falls. We marked lots of fish there last year. The south shore was good for us as well. Will also try to go past Nicholson and check out the far west end of the lake. We never had a problem finding fish the pattern was consistent last year for the week we were there. We'll be leaving the 18th to return home.
4022330,kzoofisher,2015-07-05 06:57:00,5144,Looking forward to the report. I'm working this morning with one of the guys I'm going with. We're getting a bit antsy.
4022402,redryder,2015-07-05 07:26:00,33,Just wondering where this Lake Windermere is located?
4022490,kzoofisher,2015-07-05 07:51:00,5144,"Near Chapleau, east of Wawa. One lodge on it, a few cabins, very reasonable prices, not too far for those of is east of Lake Michigan. Not an easy lake but pretty good once you get a handle on it, which isn't that unusual is it? Because it isn't very crowded you can't look for packs of boats to learn the good spots but the structure is everywhere so you just keep looking 'til you find them. And you will if you use your electronics."
