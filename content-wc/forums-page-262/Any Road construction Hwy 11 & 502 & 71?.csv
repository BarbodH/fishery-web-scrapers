4093937,NWwalleye,2015-08-01 09:39:00,223,Highway construction in full swing from Cedar lk to Perrault lk ..Expect out 30 minutes in delay time ..
4095201,btyreprich,2015-08-01 21:29:00,1067,Crossed the border at Int Falls early this morning.decided to take 71 versus 502. There's sections of 71 that are under construction but over this road is so much nicer than 502 - far less traffic and much less step hills to climb. I did remember to drive slowly through the towns along 71 so as to avoid a traffic ticket.
4099529,Bad Santa,2015-08-03 17:56:00,100,"Came back from Cedar Lake Sat 8/2. Lots of cones on both Sat, but no active construction going in or out on 105 during the weekend."
4057442,rather-be-fishin,2015-07-18 06:56:00,429,"We're headed up to Lac Seul, Ear Falls area on 7/25. Wondering about road construction/delays on the way & best route to take? Thanks! 7 days to go & count down is on. Packing is happening & getting sooooo excited! üòÅüé£üëç RBF üòé"
4057810,BornToFish,2015-07-18 09:42:00,1224,"My wife and I returned from the Red Lake area two weeks ago. It looked to us as though there was going to be road construction on Hwy 105 from about Cedar Lake to around Perrault Lake. There were orange cones, orange paint on the road way and signage along this stretch of highway. I don't recall any other construction on highways 11, 17 or 502. If there was, it wasn't any concern to us. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4058106,Bitinlight,2015-07-18 11:45:00,95,Wife and I returned on July 11 from Lac Seul. Clear sailing from Sioux Lookout to Fort Francis with no road construction.
4058426,Golden Eagle,2015-07-18 14:22:00,2642,Sounds good as I intend to be traveling up the roads around August 7.
4058834,Pooch,2015-07-18 20:49:00,4619,"You spend so much time north of the border that you might have to start paying taxes there, too. Skywagon figures you might owe him a pension contribution since he's ""one of them"" now.Have a good trip.Pooch"
4059138,Golden Eagle,2015-07-19 06:02:00,2642,"I'll be happy to contribute my share. Seems that you're into packing for your next trip in a few days. We might really be passing on the road this time, but my red F150 is sitting this one out at home. My Odyssey demands much less fuel and after so many round trips no longer needs a road map. With back seats down she makes a nice bed for a nap at a rest stop in case my eyes go heavy on me while making the journey."
4060794,bigwillies,2015-07-19 18:50:00,515,Borntofish is correct. Construction is under way on the 105. Expect to stop a few times but no major delays.
4060898,dstar49,2015-07-19 19:57:00,33,thanks for the update bigwillies we are heading up there Friday.
4092633,HRL,2015-07-31 14:54:00,1,"Highway 11 under construction from Fort Frances to Devlin, highway 71 under construction from Nestor Falls to approx 20 miles north, highway 105 under construction from 15 miles north of vermillion bay for approximately 20 miles. Minor delays at all construction sites."
4092753,gloomiseye31,2015-07-31 15:45:00,387,Yeah a lot of construction from fort Frances to about Sioux narrows. Delays weren't too bad though
