4092057,jambi,2015-07-31 09:34:00,504,Looking for info on either of these two lakes. Good area but haven't talked to anyone that has been on either of these. Meandrine is right next to Cherrington which we had a good trip on last year. Two guys portaged to Meandrine for a day and did well. Cleveland is about 5 miles long with a couple small portages. Saw it has trout so curious if water is gin clear or stained. Thanks.

I've stayed with Rob abd Nancy several times. At there main camp and fly ins and stay in a tent for a week. Thay run a top notch camp. I've always wanted to fly to meandrine. I've talked to several people who have stayed on meandrine and thay all were impressed. I can't say enough about the Rowes.
