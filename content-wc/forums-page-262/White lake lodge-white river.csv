Vince has just about everything there so bait and gas are no problem, think the cabins are very basic but you would have to call Vince. Fishing can be fantastic on white lake at that time of year or can slow down due to the mayflies. White lake lodge is on a river so if the mayfly hatch does happen you have an option. What are the dates your looking at, end, middle or begging of June? If you want more info just send me a pm. Fisherman 1792"
