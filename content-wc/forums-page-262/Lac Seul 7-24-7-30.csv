That included 90 degree flat calm conditions, 50km/hr winds, and 60 degree days. We had a guide for the first time and it was well worth it. Only down part of it was all the boats. This was my 5th trip there over 15 years and it just keeps getting busier every time. Not a big deal. Just an observation."
