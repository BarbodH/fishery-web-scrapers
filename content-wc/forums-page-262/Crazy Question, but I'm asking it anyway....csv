Superglue the smelt finish minnow up to the head on the 3"" and 4"", hook the 2-1/2"" through the head only so that it dangles out the back. Sometimes I put the minnow on so that the flat side is sideways rather than in the normal swimming position. I like to add a little stimulant with the 2-1/2"" by using a special jig head that I make with some shiny tied on it, seems to definitely add to its attraction.Bill"
4082642,ftfarms,2015-07-28 10:26:00,444,"If you like trolling worms get yourself some uncle josh- pork crawlers. Get the 7"" ers and cut them in half. Around home the 7"" are a buck cheaper than the 3"". Cut the 7"" in half and you got 14 - 3 1/2 inches rather than 14 -3""ers. But I've heard and seen nothing but great things about these. I've also have had good luck on leeches I've got from northland tackle. You could use those on your slip bobber rig with a little wind or just twitch it every now and then. Thay got good action. Good luck. Take some salted frozen shinners if you want minnows. Walleyes love the salt."
4082650,SinOrSwim,2015-07-28 10:27:00,1528,"I'm not so sure? I think I would take my own crawlers to be on the safe side. Until it was proven what they were telling me is true. All I know is I'm not a great fisherman. So, any advantage I can get is one I'm taking. If that is live bait and that is what I'm used to? That is what I'm doing until they prove otherwise. Heck I went to Hawk Lake Lodge and they supply crawlers and leeches free and I still took some of my own minnows because that is what I'm used to."
4082890,octanehi5,2015-07-28 11:22:00,1104,"I'm with fishron on this one. we put up to 200 walleyes in a boat in a day, nothing beats live bait. thats why in some areas or zones in Quebec they will not let you use salted minnows. When the bite is on they will hit almost anything, I have found that trigger-X works the best. My recommendation bring 250 nightcrawlers per person. My 6 guys this yr used 1500 in a week. Its not a crazy ? Your paying for the trip you want the best experiance posible good luck"
4082986,BornToFish,2015-07-28 11:48:00,1224,"I'm with high octane - previous post. I only use artificial bait in those rare situations when live bait isn't working. The thought would never occur to me to go on a fly-in fishing trip without taking live bait. I've had great success pulling salted and frozen minnows on single hook spinner rigs. The same results with crawlers and leeches. These set-ups work extremely well for me, especially when following along shorelines, such that I can follow a depth contour. This is the time of the season where many walleyes are now on rock humps. Following a depth contour on a rock hump is more problematic. This is the time of the season when I switch to vertical jigging with live bait, so I can always keep my jig in the walleye's strike zone. Some rock humps have broken rock on the tops of the humps. There is usually less broken rocks on the sides of the humps to catch your jig. Some break-offs of jigs are common when walleye fishing. If you are thinking that you are getting too many break-offs, it could be that you are dragging the jig along the bottom, rather than jigging it - tap the bottom to be sure you are in the strike zone and then immediately lift it. I would not encourage you to use a slip bobber, unless the bottom is very flat and holding walleyes - not very common where I fish at this time of the season. I vastly prefer the flexibility of vertical jigging so that I can account for changes in depth. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4083018,adempsey,2015-07-28 11:55:00,963,"I'd bring some nightcrawlers or salted minnows at the very least. It's really not that problematic to do so. What's your reasoning for not wanting to bring them? Live minnows I can understand because of the weight, but worms [or leeches] are not a big deal as long as you educate yourself on how to store them properly.That being said, I am sure you would do just fine jigging grubs [I like Yum, Gary Yamamoto, Mr.Twister and Kalin's] and paddle tail minnows [I like X-Zone Swammers, Northland Impulse Paddle Minnow, Zoom Swimmin Super Fluke and Berkley Ripple Shad]. You could also try trolling Slow Death with artificial worms [I like Gulp 3"" Fry], that's worked well for me. Jigging Gulp minnows has been great on some of my trips as well. As for using artificials with a slip bobber, that should work fine but you will likely need to impart some movement to the bait - either just jigging it or something similar to dropshot.Live bait will always be better overall, but I am not sure you would see a difference if the fish are very active. It's those times when things are tough that you wish you had some."
4083106,NickDalasio,2015-07-28 12:22:00,34,"The information I got was it really wasn't necessary, but they would be there in camp if we needed them. I WILL say I've been on a number of trips where we over-bought crawlers and leeches in the past; it wound up costing MORE than it would have to just buy a couple dozen as needed at camp. Bringing them home wouldn't have made sense (don't do much freshwater fishing where I live in Pennsylvania), so I donated them to the camp. But that REALLY isn't what this thread was about; I just wanted to know if anyone had any tips on fishing artificial baits beside jigging."
4083234,Bowtech84,2015-07-28 12:55:00,572,"Ha, a lot of non believers on hereüòÅ. Last April 3 of us fished sharpe below Oahe for 3 days. First day we got to our normal hangout and started our drift dragging minnows. We would pick up a walleye here and there and managed to squeak out a meal in a day of fishing. Day 2 Saturday, more boats around same spot same conditions same presentation. Started our drift with about the same results as day one. At noon my brother switched to a gulp and we were limited by one. 6 other boats around which I assumed were using live bait were having minimal success. Some of them would watch us reel a couple in then they would hurry up river behind us and try the same path. They couldn't figure it out. We talked to a group of guys that were staying at the same hotel as us later that evening and they caught 3 keepers all day using minnows and fishing the exact same stretch of river as us. Day 3 we had our fish and were on the road home by 10. When we got home that night there were multiple threads of people struggling on sharpe. Maybe it was just our lucky weekend but it was enough for me to believe that gulp can and will out fish live bait at times but in order to figure that out you have to be willing to give it an honest try.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
4088658,Fisherman1792,2015-07-30 06:55:00,927,Used gulp alive earlier this summer bottom bouncing on a harness and had great success with it. It did seem to out fish the leeches and worms. I would think live bait on a slip bobber would be better than artificial bait but you never know till you try. Fisherman 1792
4090826,MikeinMN,2015-07-30 19:59:00,190,"It's been a while since I was on a Canadian fly-in, but we never used live bait then. I very seldom use live bait on my current Lac Seul trips now. Crankbaits and spoons are mostly my thing these days, but we did use twister tail plastics on a single hook spinner/bottom bouncer with very good results on fly-ins. I think the newer paddle tail swimbaits would be even better than twisters and more versatile too. I don't think any artificial is consistently effective using a slip bobber. Mostly though, I think you should fish in the manner you enjoy wherever you go. If live bait is your thing, bring live bait."
4091393,fishron,2015-07-31 06:19:00,317,"My fishing buddy Bill often related the story of a fly-in pilot that practically put the pontoons of the plane against the shoreline when taking off from a small lake. His reply to the question of why was ""never leave any part of the lake unused"". It's kind of like that with my fishing choices. Even if there taking artificials well, never leave live bait behind, just in case!"
4081770,NickDalasio,2015-07-28 06:58:00,34,"I'm trying a new camp this year. The owners suggested artificial bait (Yum and Gulp Alive minnows & leeches). Until now, most of my fishing has been on live bait. I do have the option to buy crawlers & minnows at the camp, and I'd rather not try bringing bait on a fly-in if not needed.My questions are:For jigging- I know how to jig with artificials, but if my son (or I) start getting hung up in rocks, would it work to rig a slip bobber with a jig and artificial bait, and fish a couple feet off bottom?For trolling-has anyone had success trolling Gulp Alive minnows or leeches on a single-hook crawler rig? Or trolling plastic worms on a double hook crawler rig?"
4081818,brown1317,2015-07-28 07:05:00,74,"I tried several different artificial ""minnows"" this spring against live minnows. I found the Gulp worked best and was about 50/50 against live bait when the fish were biting. I used a trolling harness with a single hook (slow death rig)."
4081858,Guest,2015-07-28 07:15:00,0,I found salties to work great as well as cut bait.
4081866,SinOrSwim,2015-07-28 07:17:00,1528,"Take live bait! Then, try the artificial. Works, fine. You know for next trip. If not, you don't ruin this trip"
4082066,MrSimon,2015-07-28 07:56:00,922,I agree! No point in handicapping yourself right off the bat. Crawlers are so simple to transport that it's silly to not take them.
4082114,NickDalasio,2015-07-28 08:03:00,34,"They DO have live crawlers & minnows available, and I WILL use them if the artificials don't work. I'm trying to think outside the box a little and am interested in seeing if anyone else has ever done this with success. Thanks!"
4082266,Bowtech84,2015-07-28 08:31:00,572,We have used gulp with great success. Even to the point that it has out fished live bait. I would try it. Stays on the hook better than live bait and if it doesn't work you have live bait available so your not out much.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
4082354,fishron,2015-07-28 09:10:00,317,"I'm in the group that has never seen artificials out-fish live bait, at least for walleye. When the bite is really on they may be equal but I'm not about to predict when the bite is on. Take live bait!"
4082538,SinOrSwim,2015-07-28 10:01:00,1528,"I mis-read the original post. If you have access to live bait, then I'd have one person use live bait and the other artificial. Switch back and forth. Test the theory on the lake you will be fishing. Try those things you asked about. One red flag I see is if there is live bait available, why is the outfitter telling you artificial? Is there a chance he runs out?"
4082634,NickDalasio,2015-07-28 10:24:00,34,"I asked the same question, and the answer I got was that the bite is usually on, the owners use artificials when they fish as do most of the customers, and they all seem happy with the results. The refererences I spoke with all jigged with artificials or trolled crankbaits. I'm guessing the camp really doesn't want to be in the bait & tackle business, but that's only speculating. I would think on a first trip to a new lake it would probably make the most sense to listen to the camp owners & references I called, no??"
