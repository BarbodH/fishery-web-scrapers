Is there a boat landing, camping area there. Was fishing on Empire lake recently and could only catch a few small walleyes so tried to find Sparkling but couldn't. Thanks in advance"

My map is labeled "" Graham North, bright sand, alley and garden lakes., #110. We fished Little Sparkling a couple times, don't recall if you can get thru to Sparkling. I seem to remember a small camping area where we launched. If you entered Empire from the south shore, the Little Sparkling is about 20 minute drive further north. If you were on the north side of Sparkling, probably a 15 minute drive. Another 5 minutes north, and South Siess road veers off to the east `and that is the start of Sparkling. Here is a link to a map that has Little Sparkling in the center.https://www.google.com/maps/@49.8178.../data=!3m1!1e3 You can see the access on the NW side, where the road is closest to the lake. Sparkling is just to the east, and stretches south, a good 4 or 5 miles. If you zoom in, you can see all the old logging roads. We don't go any further than Allely Lake now a days. Good luck, let us know what you find, and where the access is."

I fished Allely one time, didn't do too well but as we were pulling out an older Canadian gent was coming in to fish and told me there was a 30 ft. hole somewhere by the islands. I never found anything that deep but had only fished there a couple days. Have you found the area that he probably was talking about? He said it was real good fishing there."
