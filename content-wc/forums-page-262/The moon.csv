4096473,LoDo,2015-08-02 15:56:00,721,"Weird question and perhaps a question for the more serious fisherman or guides, but do you prefer to have a new moon or full moon while fishing? I read an article online the other day and this guy was talking about how important the moon cycle is when fishing in the dawn and evening. He preferred to start his week with a new moon if he had his preference. He swore fishing was much better with a new moon oppose to a full moon. Is this complete garbage? I'd like to hear from the guides?"
4096857,Golden Eagle,2015-08-02 19:34:00,2642,"Check the caught date for big fish and then look at moon phase for the catches. Doing your own research is better than some opinions. Lots of guys go when their vacation time comes. A perfect trip for me is for three weeks, with a new moon the first or third week and the full moon either the first or third week. During the middle week I won't be found in the cabin doing my nails on the day of a half moon. Weather trumps moon phases."
4096905,LoDo,2015-08-02 19:58:00,721,"Ha! I hear ya! I'm more of a weather guy, but this article i read i figured i'd ask those on this site. I leave in 9 days, however like most, this trip usually starts a few weeks prior to departure with multiple stops at this site, trips to cabelas and packing. Not to worried about nails, we spend most of our days on the water regardless of moon, weather, etc...."

The moon (without a doubt) plays a big part, and much of it depends on the type of lake you're fishing. Full moons tend to trigger more of an evening/night bite. So, keep that in mind."
4099417,BreezyPoint,2015-08-03 17:12:00,1581,"Here's a synopsis of musky fishing by moon phase at Red Wing Lodge. Not much different between full and new moons, but definitely down at other periods. This covers about 12,000 fish.http://www.redwinglodge.net/wp-conte...Moon-Phase.pdfFrank"

I'll say this, you probably have a better shot at northern lights with a new moon."
