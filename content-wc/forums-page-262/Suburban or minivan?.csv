There are 4 guys in the group, and we have always had enough room in my truck for passengers and cargo. Anyway, I was directed to consider a minivan because it had more cargo space. When I compare the two vehicles, I see what the numbers say, but what do people who own them say? Which one would you take to Canada. We do have a lots of gear that incudes coolers, duffle bags, boxes of food, beer, etc. Or, just take the truck! Thanks"

We have since switched to all 2 piece rods and it makes it very easy. We wait to buy all our beer until we hit the duty free so we only have 3-4 hours driving with the extra weigh and lack of space. 3 years ago we took my buddies f150 and he averaged 19 mpg and the past 2 years in my van we averaged 25 mpg.

Behind the second seats of the largest minivan you have about 83 Sq ft. A Suburban has 90 sq ft behind the second seats. I dumped my Toyota Sienna because with the third seats in you had almost no space where a Suburban still had about 4 ft. I personally also think the suburban rides better for long trips. Longer wheel base and larger tires just do better at 65 mph for long hauls not to mention if you have any less improved roads the higher vehicle does better. The downside of course is fuel economy. My 2010 Suburban would get right around 20 mph at 65-70 mph. My Toyota would get close to 25 mph.Hope you have a good trip!B-

4097809,pwbmlr,2015-08-03 08:18:00,37,I agree with the fact that you will have a lot more room with a suburban. The two guys in the back seat had landing nets hitting them in the head driving up to camp. Luckly for me I was comfy in the drivers seat.
4097833,Golden Eagle,2015-08-03 08:25:00,2642,"It's showing 192,000 miles and is ready to head up to Red Lake Thursday morning.For the trip I've removed the second row of captain chairs and folded the rear seat into the floor. 2/3 of miles on the Honda have been to NW Ontario. Several trips were with 4 adults and my 80# lab. We are careful not to abuse the van by pushing it too hard with the extra weight. Transmissions in minivans are far from being overbuilt and they might be the weakest link in the vehicle. For sure, it's a big box on a small chassis that meets a lot of wind resistance running down the interstate at high speeds. My van would pull my boat, but for how long and how safely? I'll never give it a try.I too, am getting 25 mpg on trips. Got 27 mpg before I finally purchased the correct size tires. Duh!My other 2 vehicles are Toyota Sienna and Ford F150. Bought the 2006 Ford used and it has no cruise control, which is a must for me on a long drive. I say go with a vehicle that's overbuilt, rather than one that is underbuilt or barely built, for a long ride with a heavy load."
