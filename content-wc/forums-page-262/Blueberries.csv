I had assumed it was not, as US customs is so picky about even store-bought fruit and veggies, but when I was in Ontario earlier this year, I was talking with the lodge owner and the subject of picking blueberries came up. He said something about taking some home and I said I'd have to smuggle them across the border. But he said I can bring a bushel of BBs back if I wanted to. Is that right? I'll be heading to Lac Seul on Saturday, and it should be prime pick'n season. Those wild BBs make some delicious pancakes and muffins. My wife would rather I bring a quart of BBs back than walleye."

I know other hunters bring a bunch back when they go back to the states. That doesn't mean its legal though. One lady cleans them , places on paperplates and freezes before putting them in zip locks. A big blueberry crop can hurt our bear hunting but eating the berries sure is nice too."

Information is available at https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/det...r-personal-use I buy wild blueberries by the 11 quart basket. I simply put the whole basket of blueberries in my freezer for a couple of days to freeze them and then I transfer the blueberries into large zip lock bags for permanent storage in my freezer."
4096665,Stringbean,2015-08-02 17:21:00,279,"In years gone by, we would usually bring several 5 qt. ice cream buckets back. The only question at the border was ""How many?"". Then he said ""Have a nice trip home."""
