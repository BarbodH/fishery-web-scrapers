Fishing on both lakes was very, very good.cedar lakes wslleyes still serm to be at the 15-20 ft range and have been staying in the same locations for a while now and i dont think anything will change to fast as the vool front has dropped the water temps by 10 c.jig of any color seemed to work just fine as did the lindy rig i used which mighg have had a slight edge at the end of the day.some walleyes are still on the edges of the deeper side of the weeds eagle lakes fishing wad awesome on monday for us and most of the bite seemed to be going on in the 20-25 ft range.water temps there are in around 68 degress. Jigs worked fine but the lindy rig really shined as it normally does this time of the year.with the cooler week right things will stay the same there also. fished eagle today again out of north shore lodge and fished like the old days.no depth finder or gps.had to think where my spots were and count down a weight.was kinda fun.haha.think my guestscwere a little worried but after i caught a fish and threw my marker bouy in we all started catching fish.mostly all fish serm to be 13-16"" pretty steady with a few slot fish.cant complain.butveveryone wants at least a 17"" for there take home fishwhich seems to be a hard fish to catch lately.same goes for cedar.think all the 17"" fish everybody is after is having its effect.just my observation.did manage a true hog on monday on eagle.was a 30 1/2""big girl that was released.seems like fishing shoukd remain pretty solid for a while."
