Has anyone already done this for the lakes at Chimo's Bearberry outpost (Warwick, Bullock & Copper)? If so, would you be willing to share maps? I may have missed it but I did not see any of the above lakes mentioned on Navionics website. I live in the SW suburbs of Chicago. Thanks, Dave"

Still trying to see if I have Copper, but I don't think that's it's official name (if it even has one).I will try to post them up soon.edit: I put up Bullock and Warwick Lakes, but unfortunately I don't have Copper. http://www.lineonfishing.com/index.p...ake-depth-maps"
