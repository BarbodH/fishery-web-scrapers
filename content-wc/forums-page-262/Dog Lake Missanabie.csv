3893121,WIfish,2015-05-21 11:58:00,3,My grandfather is taking the boys on an adventure to dog lake near Missanabie in the middle of June. We will be staying at northern walleye lodge. He had some questions and asked me to put them online for him. -When was ice out?-How are the walleyes biting?-What is the current water temps?-In the middle of june what should we expect for water temps? We have been told this is a very cold lake and stays cold a long time.-If anyone has stayed at northern walleye lodge how is the lodge?-Are the guides helpful in finding the fish?-Any other tips/tricks/secret spots/ hot spots would be great to get also.We are looking to just have a good time with grandpa. And getting him on some good fishing will be a bonus. thanks for the advice.

3906426,WIfish,2015-05-26 11:54:00,3,Does anyone have any current info on the lake?
3907130,lenray,2015-05-26 15:00:00,467,If you like to eat fish--maybe bring a few cartons of Mrs Pauls---just to be sure...............
3946649,grapestomper,2015-06-08 13:04:00,41,I was there last year. Won't be back. The cottages are decent. Fishing sucked. The only thing we could find were perch. Caught lots of them. We had enough fish to eat and some to bring home but the lake has a lot to be desired. I would pick a few spots and fish them rather than roam all over the lake looking for fish. It is a big lake. Good luck.
4087874,tommy1736,2015-07-29 20:20:00,2,I am going to dog lake august 11. This is my first time going there and i was wondering how the walleye where biting and maybe where to go to catch them. Also if anybody has any sonar charts of the lake?
4088234,adempsey,2015-07-30 01:17:00,963,I have a map. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and open the Other Lakes tab.Depth Map of Dog Lakeedit:changed link so the file would be a download

4092313,Mikep007,2015-07-31 12:09:00,77,"Hi, four of us visited in June 2010, stayed at Fox Den -- have to agree with others about the quality of the fishing. It's a huge lake and it seems like all the walleye were congregated in on bay on three points at 8:30 at night. Everyone on the lake knew these points and on a few nights during our week long stay we got to enjoy the drunken revelry with loud music from a pontoon party boat. I have a detailed GPS map with locations where we caught fish if you want to PM me. It's a pretty location, the river up north is a fun trip (too shallow for fish) but if you want more than a nice boat ride, I'd go elsewhere."
