Never did poorly in June, but some of the later trips we struggled to catch fish and had to rely on bad weather and fishing at 4 am and 10 pm to land some decent fish on the bluebird days. Have you guys had similar experiences or is it just about going to the real productive lakes all the time? When you try a lot of different lakes as I have, can't rely on experience to find the good daytime spots in time if you are only there for 1 week."
4095385,kzoofisher,2015-08-02 06:26:00,5144,"Knowing the water makes a big difference no matter how good the lake is, no question about that. Finding new spots is part of the fun for me and I'll tone down expectations on a new lake. Finding some and going back the next year to find more is one of the things I look forward to most. I've plopped down in a spot an caught fish after fish, mostly in Alaska during a run, and it was great for a while. Then it was too much like fishing in a stocked pond. I prefer the challenge of working at least a little bit to find them and working a bit for them once I have. I prefer August because I don't feel like I'm missing as much back home and the bugs are not bad."
4095425,octanehi5,2015-08-02 06:49:00,1104,"I find that fishing the last week of June is some of the best fishing,I have tried earlier and later, I know the lake I fish very well, Late August the fishing tends to slow down to about half of what you will catch earlier in the yr. Later in ther yr you can also run into some very nasty weather with winter on the door step."
4095473,Guest,2015-08-02 07:05:00,0,"12 More for me too. In on August 14, out on September 19. I am truly pumped."
4095513,LoDo,2015-08-02 07:41:00,721,"I went through and counted all the posted and surprisingly its about 2 to 1 that prefer Aug to June. Interesting! Again, I've fished late Aug before but its been years and don't recall how we did on our trip. The previous 10 yrs has always been June. We have always crushed fish in June. June always seem to have numbers, but often times the fish are small with little energy as they are spawning. June usually has fish in super shallow water too. I think Aug will be fun hunting fish in 20', with lots of energy. The weather may be more stable but a week in Canada isn't complete with at least a good storm or two. Its all part of the experience!!"
4096081,Golden Eagle,2015-08-02 11:36:00,2642,"August looks great to me today, mainly because I'll be on the water in NW Ontario by 8 a.m. on August 8. After that, October will be attractive to me as I've become pretty much a regular by making an October trip about 2/3 of the years. Come January and I'll be thinking, daily, about fishing the walleye opener on the same lake for the 32nd consecutive year. I'll probably go in a week early to fish pike until the rest of my party arrives. My June, July and September trips have never disappointed me."
4096481,law57,2015-08-02 15:59:00,1147,"I usually go up the second or third week kof June. I find fish from 5-20 feet. A few years ago I went up over Memorial Day - wet, cold, windy - did I say wet? I know that's not the normal late May/early June - but it was a very tough trip. Every couple of years I throw in a September trip - later the better. But the camp starts to blow their water lines to avoid freezing. So usually Mid-September is my latest departure date. As others have said - warmish days, shorter days, cooler nights. Sometimes the weather can get pretty rough - wind, rain, cold. The fish are bigger in September - they've been pigging out all summer. The same 28"" fish may be 2# heavier in the fall. At least it seems like it to me. If I could only go once each year I'd probably stick with June - the weather is more stable. Big-time thunder storms can roll through (I once sank a boat in a hail storm). But typically it's nicer in June."
4098769,Shorelunch,2015-08-03 13:08:00,554,"I love early June on LOTW. But, if you want to change things up, late August is usually pretty different than early June fishing!"
3508410,Ogoki,2015-02-04 16:38:00,291,"In the hay days of fly in fishing , outfitters would not fly just my wife and I in except their slow times , as in late July and early August . I would get a guy trip togther for early June . Not realizing it at the tie but they actually did me a favor . I had to LEARN more techniques , if we were going to eat fish. Once things slowed down and my wife and I got to go early June ! She thought it was like catching fish in a barrel. I personally like early June until 4th of July week. Our other favorite time is the last week of August . Last year in Quetico we had 39 degrees one morning . Had excellent fishing all 9 days."
3509770,btmbncr,2015-02-05 05:35:00,492,"I prefer August.The weather is more stable,no bugs to speak of and the walleyes are schooled up in deep water.I can find them with the electronics.Bill"
3515370,castnblast,2015-02-06 16:01:00,111,"I live in NWO. I love all seasons, but for me late august / early sept no question."
3516874,octanehi5,2015-02-07 04:58:00,1104,"The later ice out affects the bite in June, I find that in a late ice out the bite really starts to turn on the last week in june, in a normal ice out the end of april, the bite starts to pick up earlier mid june, In the fall we find the bite to be more spuratic, with some bigger fish.Last week in June is aways my go to date"
3516938,wallydave,2015-02-07 05:44:00,2151,"I have fished both early June and early to mid August, both have advantages. Early June the bite can be amazing! Depending on the ice out/postspawn the fishing can be non-stop! The weather can be unstable though! Bring layers for your layers! August the weather is stable, the bite can be very strong too, the fish tend to be bigger, the lake may not have as much traffic compared to early June, a problem in June at times. Any week on a lake in Ontario cant be all bad!"
3517282,LoDo,2015-02-07 07:38:00,721,"Great responses and opinions. Enjoyed all! All seem to be spot on with their opinions. I completely agree with what most said regarding June. June completely depends on the ice out. Last year we fished the opener and found ourselves fishing the same two spots the whole trip. Both spots were areas of high current and the warmest water temps on the lake. Not ideal. Id much rather fish the whole lake and do some exploring for new spots. We have fished the same lake the last 6 years. We find that mid/late June was best. I'm really excited for the bigger fish, stable temps and a fall bite to the air. 16ish weeks to opener!"
3518954,zeebee,2015-02-07 15:55:00,1144,"I switched my vacation time for walleye to late August a few years back. Reflecting on the decision reminds me of the old joke , for those familiar with it, about the young bull and the old bull standing on top of the hill looking down at a valley full of cows.... So be it with August fishing.... us old bulls can can catch the premier fish in August when conditions are ideal without putting up with the uncertain weather, bugs and crowds associated with June. Nothing wrong with June but, August/Sept is too sweet."
3521586,castnblast,2015-02-08 13:40:00,111,"The one thing I really do like about early June is pike are shallow, easy to find and aggressive toward the fly. I have a fly rod in the boat all year long, but spring pike are very easy to catch, you rarely have to cast more than 25', and you often see them charge the fly which is always exciting. They really break up the day and make for great memories. Again, I like early june, but my main reason for a late season walleye preference is: - post spawn fish are just that - post spawn and often still spewing. - they are thinner, and weaker having just gone through the rigours of the spawn. - fish are often shallow and jerking walleye out of 5' gets old quick. Fall walleye have fed all summer, are strong and in prime condition, and for me, it's more fun to set a hook in 25' of water."
3532914,bobbylfishermon,2015-02-11 13:41:00,241,"Give me the last week in may and the first week in june, all the fish are up shallow and eating!! August, no thanks, water temps in high 60's- low 70's and most of the fish are DOWN, and the BUGS are all out!"
4095153,LoDo,2015-08-01 21:04:00,721,"I posted this thread in Feb 2015 when our dates were set. In 12 days our group of 8 will meet in Minneapolis and take our journey to Red Lake, ON. From there its a 50 mile flight due west to Donald Lake in the Woodland Caribou Prov Park. Clearly excited!! The temps seem pretty stable in the upper 60s, low 70s for highs and upper 40s and low 50s for lows. Perfect in my eyes! The reports I've read from those that have fished the past few weeks have been good. Walleyes are 20' plus, water is little low and the northern lights have been seen lightly a few nights. 12 more days!"
3506154,LoDo,2015-02-03 20:18:00,721,"I've been fishing NWO for 20 years. I'm 36. Thanks dad! Only the last 10 do i really remember the dates, fishing, temps, bite, etc.... This year we are fishing late Aug in NWO. Prior to this year we have always fished opener and/or early June. Our group knows spring fishing well. Weather, water temps, pre/post spawn spots, tackle, gear, etc... Which season do you prefer and why? What should our group expect in late Aug? Thank you!! LoDo Denver, CO"
3506226,@Lunker,2015-02-03 21:10:00,835,"I like them both, because they're completely different. Early June......walleyes can be found shallow, shoreline related, and likely still scattered if weather has prevented them from starting to school up yet. Find any green vegetation you possibly can. Northerns are still up shallow, muskie's aren't open yet although I've caught some good fish targeting northern with light to medium tackle, and smallies could be anywhere, depending on weather progression. Late August (usually we're up there for a week to 10 days, heading home on Labor Day)........muskie's are on the prowl, and northerns are coming back shallow. The good part is that smallies have gone deep and are mixed right in with walleyes in 20 - 35' of water. It's an absolute blast to catch football-sized smallies out of deep water. It's been very, very common to have 70-fish days fishing walleyes and smallies just in the mornings and a couple of hours in the evening (two sticks in the boat) while targeting ""gators"" in the afternoon. The lake is much quieter in late August; the cottagers have gone home. You can feel Mother Nature beginning to prepare / gather strength for winter. Huge flocks of geese are looking southward. Can't go wrong either way."
3506410,jaximus,2015-02-03 23:52:00,117,"my brothers and have done a canoe/camping ontario trip to quetico trip every year for the past 9 years. the first 8 we did early june but last year it didnt work out where june was an option so we went late august. we were afraid of not knowing when/where/how to get the quality/quantity of fish with which we had become accustomed. we did really well in august and had a blast. the weather was nicer (warmer and less rain), the bugs weren't as bad, the fishing was fantastic and the blueberries were ripe! fresh fruit is always nice on a backwoods adventure!"
3506530,Walleye507,2015-02-04 04:49:00,193,I find May into June to be my favorite time of the year to fish. I believe it is because the weather typically has finally gotten real nice. By August I find the temps (local) have gotten higher than I like.
3506618,BornToFish,2015-02-04 05:59:00,1224,"@Lunker perfectly nailed it! Another gentleman commented on the difference in bugs. I've found that boats can be more congested during June compared to August. I believe that fishing for walleyes in June is very different from that in late August, at least on my lake of choice. For me, June is about covering water to locate the fish. The fish might be in one place during an evening, and half a mile away the next morning. August is about dissecting a piece of structure as the fish are in schools and typically deep (e.g 25-30+ fow). I prefer to fish the August bite. I believe that most of the walleyes during August are stacked up on structure, granted some are still out in the abyss chasing ciscoes while others are relating to weeds. I'm thinking ""game on"" when I pull up to a piece of structure and catch a walleye as I then know where they all are! I'm thinking that I have a chance to catch every walleye on that rock hump. For me, early June fishing is often about boat movement to cover water to locate fish. Late August involves little boat movement. The choice of June versus August may come down to the temperament of the angler. Some anglers need movement to stay engaged and in their comfort zone. Some anglers prefer staying essentially motionless and are quite content doing so. Both times of the year have their unique benefits, as the fish are still in the lake and still eating. The choice might come down to how you prefer to fish for them. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3506690,MrSimon,2015-02-04 06:30:00,922,"I'm a fan of late August or even early September. No bugs. Cool evenings. Just a touch of Fall in the air. Great fishing. And depending on where you go, less people and lower rates. We typically take a an early Spring trip to upstate NY for the opener, and then a big trip to Canada in early Sept. Seems perfect to us."
3507098,ftfarms,2015-02-04 08:07:00,444,Every time we go from late July though late August I always ask my self. Why do I put my self though the crap weather in late may and early june. But every year we have to do the early trip. Love the more stabil weather in August. And I always catch more at that time.
3507938,retire55,2015-02-04 13:58:00,1029,"As the average age of our group of fishermen closed in on 70, most of us appreciated the hotter temperatures of late Jun/early Jul less and less. Consequently, we changed our walleye trip dates to between mid Aug and mid Sep. Cooler day time temperatures for fishing and cooler night time temperatures for better sleeping. And fishing during low light conditions didn't necessitate getting up at 4 AM or staying out until 10 PM. No bugs is a bonus! Regardless whether you're fishing early in the season or late in the season, you just have to learn where to find those marble eyes. First trip this year is 14-22 Aug while our second trip is 8-16 Sep."
3508154,LoDo,2015-02-04 15:20:00,721,"Our trip to Wamserville on Donald Lake in the Woodland Caribou Prov Park is Aug 13 to 21. The dates were set yesterday. Like most, once you find out the date you start to really get the itch, visit this site and start thinking about rippin lips. The problem with Aug is its so far away. ugh..."
3508194,fishron,2015-02-04 15:32:00,317,"In the far north I prefer late June to early August, mainly for the stability of the weather. Further down the early June bite is on, and August has fewer bugs so it comes down to where I'm fishing."
