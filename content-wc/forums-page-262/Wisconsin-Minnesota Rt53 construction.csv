4096697,JayM5209,2015-08-02 17:25:00,1050,Just came south on that route Friday night and there were NO delays at all. Northbound a week early though there were two 15 minute delays just south of Intl. Falls due to repaving. That should all be completed by the time of your trip.Northbound Monday afternoon had an unusual 25-30 minute wait in line to go through Canadian customs. Southbound about 6 p.m. Friday there was NO wait to cross.Have a good trip. Leave just a few of those Eagle Lake/Vermilion Bay walleyes for the rest of us!
