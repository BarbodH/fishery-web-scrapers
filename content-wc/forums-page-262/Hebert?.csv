4087410,fishron,2015-07-29 16:22:00,317,"Ron, our dates are June 20 to the 25. Plenty of time for a couple of fish fries. I'll be working on some new recipes. On a sad note we lost one of our guys over last weekend. Check your PM."
4091345,octanehi5,2015-07-31 05:51:00,1104,"Again You fly in one day ahead of us. I was thinking of making a walleye alfrado sauce over linguni. Sorry to hear of Ed's passing,He was a good guy.I still see more big fish being caught on this lake than any other yr. in 2016 when we get together we will have to raise a few glasses to Ed"
4091369,fishron,2015-07-31 06:11:00,317,"Well someone has to get there and wake up the fish for your group. Get-together meal sounds great. I'll be working on something special, maybe take one off this site. We'll be celebrating Ed's life today. He always had great stories of his time in the Navy. Gave back through many years in leadership in the Boy Scouts, and always had a ""unique"" perspective of the world around him. I agree, Hebert seems to be producing more trophy walleye. The return system of anything over 20 is working. The giant walleye factory that was Oswego harbor on Lake Ontario for years was wiped out by literally taking every big walleye caught. They're not the fish I want to eat anyway."
4093673,octanehi5,2015-08-01 07:14:00,1104,"We have started our own slot of taking the 17 to 19"" fish for eating and the smaller and larger go back. In this way it takes a few less fish to feed the group, more fish for the future. One 19""er has more than twice the meat of a 14 or 15 "" fish. Looking at the size range of the fish we caught 6"" to 30"" with about 50% of the fish being caught were in the slot of 14 to 20, with 30% being below the slot and 20% above the slot. The fishing on Hebert will remain very good for many yrs. It has never happened in past that we caught 30"" 27's, 26's,25's ,24's 23's, 22's, on down only missing the 29 and 28"" fish. Our record fish of 30"" and 11lbs still stands as the biggest fish caught on the lake, and will be very hard to beat, this yr or any other yr."
4093913,MikeG1,2015-08-01 09:37:00,434,"The discussion in this thread impresses me several ways. 1. Your talk of fishing of course. Sounds as though we should only keep fish around 18"" it preserve the resource. If is is incorrect or you have other suggestions let us know. We do not plan to bring any fish home, only a few for dinner fare while visiting. 2. Your talk of the dinners- sounds like you guys eat like kings. We r having each guy be responsible for 1 dinner and I can only hope that are as good as you guys describe. Sorry for your loss. He'll be in my prayers. Thanks again for the information, I'll enjoy the anticipation as much as the trip. Mike."
4094281,octanehi5,2015-08-01 13:12:00,1104,"Mike G If I was you my first time on the lake just follow their rules,you will catch eater size fish, once you get a feel for the lake. You can pick and choose. As for meals,We have done it both ways take a minimum of food in and eat lots of fish, Our bring in what you want and pay the over weight charge, My group leans to eating very well, I never had any one complane about the food. Its relitive to how many times you think you can do this trip, If its once in a lifetime make it a very memorable experiace. I have had the pleasure of bring many first timers to Hebert, even guys that have been before.I have been told by many of them , it was their personal best trip for quality and quantity. Its not me its the lake,I just know it very well"
4100017,Wall1,2015-08-03 20:41:00,17,"Mike - all the advise you have received is dead on. We have fished Hebert over 20 + years and just returned from this years trip this morning. The main advantage on staying up north is the deeper water and variety of conditions with depth and the wind. North or south you will enjoy the challenge of catching fish. Be sure to have a good depth finder as there are many areas that are overlooked by most people because they dont have the equipment to locate and pay attention to the little things and detail. I have personally caught a walleye measuring 31 1/4"" estimating 13 lbs 4 years ago. We have also caught several over 30 "" and all fish were measured and released alive. All the larger fish we have caught over the years have come from the north end. I would suggest having the care taker Daniel take you out fishing and he is very willing and helpful in showing you some of the spots to help you enjoy the week fishing. Tamarac is a great outfitter and I know they will do anything to assure you have a good trip that's possible.All the guys here that have passed on their experiences like Ron and Octane and others have been there and know first hand how good it can be. If you send me your number privately I would be willing to share some of the things we have learned about fishing Herbert. Good luck and good fishing"
4076098,MikeG1,2015-07-25 20:05:00,434,"Considering a trip next summer. We have the option of late may, or the 1st 2 weeks of July. I believe All are in cabin 26. Any insight from those who have visite s this lake? What is the advantage of north vs. South? All inf appreciated. I'd welcome taking on the phone and wil give my number to anyone why is willing to talk. Thanks in advance. Mike."
4076570,octanehi5,2015-07-26 06:48:00,1104,"Mike,I have spent the last 12 seasons on the lake, In my opinion the last week of June running into the first weeks in July are the prime weeks. We are in cabin 26 from june 26th -july 3rd 2016. As to north verses south the lake produces fish in both areas it all boils down to being more remote or stay on an island with 5 cabins on it there are only to cabins in the north and set up apartin two differant bays. The second thing about camp 26 Is that its the best camp set up on the lake,takes the same amount of time to fish it north or south. Give me a call and we can talk 860 402 3209 Ron"
4076586,MikeG1,2015-07-26 07:03:00,434,I'll call you on Monday. Mike.
4076714,NY Walleye,2015-07-26 07:51:00,78,I sent you a PM.
4077962,fishron,2015-07-26 18:49:00,317,"I've stayed at cabin 21 in the south of Hebert for two trips. Hebert is 12 miles long and with the good boats and motors Air Tamarac provides, you can fish the whole lake easily in a week. Ron (Octainhi5) can give you great information on the lake. Our group has done very well the last week of June. There's a lot of information on the lake from Ron and others that are happy to share. I've learned a lot and can't wait to get back. My choice of the weeks offered to you would be July. Summer never did arrive this year and May can be brutal. Good luck"
4085986,MikeG1,2015-07-29 07:58:00,434,"We have decided upon the week of July 3 - 10 2016 in #26. If anyone plans to be there the same week, please send me a note. Thanks to all for the information you provided. I'm sure I'll have additional questions. I'm extremely excited and will enjoy the anticipation until then. Thanks again to all."
4086857,octanehi5,2015-07-29 12:23:00,1104,"You fly in as my group leaves, we will leave a few in the lake for you. It should be a great week"
4086986,MikeG1,2015-07-29 13:21:00,434,"I was hoping you'd be there with us. Will we see you at the airport? As newbies we'd welcome any and all suggestions / locations. I'll be in touch between now and then. Thanks for all your help, it's greatly appreciated."
4087058,fishron,2015-07-29 13:56:00,317,"Your in luck, Mike. Usually the way it works, your group will fly in as Ron's group will load the plane that brings you in to fly out. So bring the map Air Tamarac will provide for you and a marking pen. You can't beat fresh information!"
4087346,octanehi5,2015-07-29 15:59:00,1104,fishron what are your dates?
