4077890,BornToFish,2015-07-26 18:32:00,1224,"I went outside to wax my truck this afternoon in preparation for another trip north of the border. While doing so, I recalled another parallel to my previous post of brokers of credit card numbers. I have been selling a handful of items on Craig's List. Every now and again, I get a response to my advertisement from someone that clearly does not speak English as their first language. I recently learned that these people are simply fishing for email responses from the sellers. They are compiling lists of valid email addresses that they in turn sell to scammers. I wondered where people get my email address when I receive ""Official"" emails from Verizon that my account is overdue. My wife and I are not customers of Verizon. There are some clever people out there that prefer to steal rather than work an honest job. I doubt they fish for real fish."
4078210,rnnonmt,2015-07-26 19:56:00,992,I can hardly think that a store clerk would memorize cc numbers in the split seconds that they may have their hands on a cc AND the 3 or 4 digit security number printed on the card AND the full name AND the expirationdate in order to make a purchase without the credit card present. With all of the electronic pick pocket devices and computer scammers there is no reason to steal someone's identity or CC info the old fashioned way. If the store clerk could memorize all the info on someone's cc that fast he/she would make more money counting cards playing texas hold-em or black jack in Las Vegas with the MIT group.
4100689,BreezyPoint,2015-08-04 07:17:00,1581,"As one who has worked with major banks as clients for years, I know the processes and procedures put in place to protect credit cards and it sounds like Bobby's has in place very good processes and procedures. I would not hesitate to use my card there, as I did last week. Since the card is handled by the customer only and the number goes right into the system, there is minimal chance for credit card number theft. I would doubt the fraud originated at Bobby's.Frank"
4101641,bigwillies,2015-08-04 11:41:00,515,"that is a good point. also in canada at least, we also have pin numbers for our cards. same as debit. not sure if it is the same in the u.s."
4101921,Golden Eagle,2015-08-04 13:05:00,2642,"Lots of positive posts, with solid facts. So, what's going on with the original post? Might the extra purchases have been made by someone in the cardholder's party? Perhaps an examination of the credit card bill will offer a hint."
4101993,SinOrSwim,2015-08-04 13:19:00,1528,"Or it could be the guy has a beef with the place for some other reason and with 3 total posts, decided to make something up? First, that stuff isn't likely to happen. The fact he is saying it happened twice at the same place raises even more red flags on whether he is being truthful."
4102601,pjshorthorn,2015-08-04 16:38:00,5654,"That's all ya got Cap? Did you actually confirm that fradulent charges happened through this establishment's system? Did you personally experience the issue or was it just part of your posse two years in a row? Did the people that had the issue of fradulent charges use their card on the way up to Canada ? I could ask another 100 questions.......but there isn't any point. There are so many variables that you haven't provided in your post, it comes across as pretty inflammatory. (edit)...it comes across as ignorant as you didn't do any homework with facts to back up the assertion. I used my card in Vermilion Bay last week at a couple of locations with zero issues and no concerns ( chip and no chip cards). PjShorthorn"
4075954,cap1,2015-07-25 18:37:00,3,All use caution when making a purchase at the Shell station of Bobby's Bait. Back to back years someone in our group has had thier credit card numbers stolen and used immediately after making a purchase. Coincidental? Purhaps but the next time I'm asked to see my card by a Clerk I'll be watching their every move.
4076130,Fishin Fun,2015-07-25 20:24:00,218,Good to know. Thanks.
4076530,BornToFish,2015-07-26 06:28:00,1224,"As you said, it could be entirely coincidence. But, the saying goes ""where there is smoke, there is likely fire"". I had a very unpleasant experience at Bobby's earlier this season. I can't think of a reason to want to go there again when there are alternatives available. Thanks for sharing your experience so that others can make informed decisions as to where to shop."
4076842,bobbylfishermon,2015-07-26 08:51:00,241,"Are you guys talking about Bobby's corner in V-Bay, On????"
4076874,bigwillies,2015-07-26 09:01:00,515,Yup
4076906,v-bay gord,2015-07-26 09:13:00,3168,"Thousands of customers each season with good service and quality products. I highly doubt you have more to worry about using a credit card there than anywhere else. Question, because I really don't know, but how does one use someone else's credit card number to purchase stuff when you don't actually have the card? Perhaps online, but at local Dryden business's?"
4077026,denise@bobbys,2015-07-26 10:17:00,1,"I am the owner of Bobby's Sport Shop & Shell Gas station and am proud to say that I operate my business with a high degree of integrity! I was first notified of this ""problem"" last night and now have found that the individual has taken to social media to air his/her concerns without even taking a moment to discuss directly with me at the store. First off I would like to explain a few things. Shell Canada disabled the ""manual entry"" of credit cards several years ago, on a National level. At NO time can a teller enter in a credit card number manually into the system because of this restriction. Because of the new chip and pin technology instituted by the credit card companies in Canada, the credit card never leaves the customer's hand as the customer needs to insert the card or swipe and then enter a pin etc. much like a debit card is used in the US. Now, when we transact using a US credit card without the chip, the customer swipes their card right on the pinpad themselves or in the rare occasion, the teller needs to swipe on the main terminal if the card isn't reading properly. At no other time does the teller have the opportunity to touch the card, but to verify a signature on the back. On the receipt the only part of the credit card number that shows are the last 4 digits, as do most receipts from retail locations. I would have hoped that this individual would have come to me directly to discuss their concerns."
4077130,Golden Eagle,2015-07-26 11:04:00,2642,"I've shopped at Bobby's for 43 years with a party anywhere from one person to a dozen. We've never had the slightest problem of any kind. Bobby's is just like any of the stores I shop, except they seem to have more of what we want. My guys leave the store happy, even when they've overspent on stuff they didn't need. Back in August 1972 those two, half crazy brothers gave us complimentary twister tails that had us coming back to shop and put us onto a new method of stinging walleyes. A lot of us have been satisfied customers over several decades. Gassed up at Bobby's May 23, 2015 and will return next month."
4077210,kcguy68,2015-07-26 11:58:00,51,"Bobby's has always been a must stop for my family for years. I always feel like a kid in a candy store every time I go in there. It's always our last stop before we start our fishing trip. They have always been good to us, and I look forward to picking up some ""must"" have items there next Saturday. We have never had any problems and I really appreciate all they have to offer. If you find yourself lacking anything for your trip, you can probably find it there."
4077234,BornToFish,2015-07-26 12:19:00,1224,"I had a customer in my store about two months ago that told me an interesting story. She and her husband were on vacation in Dallas, TX this spring. They used their credit card to pay for their hotel bill, gas for the rental care and the fee for the rental car. They then boarded a plane to fly to Denver, CO. They were notified by their card company while en-route that someone made an unauthorized transaction against the same credit card while they were flying to Denver. They landed in Denver and promptly contacted their credit card company to cancel the card. They learned (presumably from their credit card company) that people compile lists of credit card numbers and sell these lists to brokers. The brokers in turn sell these lists of credit card numbers to individuals (a.k.a. thieves) all over the world. The thieves keep trying credit numbers off these lists until they find ones that work. We hear of hacks of the computer system of corporate giants (e.g. Target) that hit the news. These hackers are likely targeting credit card numbers."
