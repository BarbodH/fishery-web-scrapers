512977,Guest,2001-06-04 03:57:00,0,We are headed to Canada on Friday the 8th and I am going to salt down some minnows. I have not done this before and need some info on it. I briefly looked at this forum last week and saw that someone had added borax to the mix by a ratio of 1/4 salt and 3/4 borax. Is that right. I would appreciate any help you can give me on this process. Do any of you have better ideas for preserving minnows as we will not be able to get them live where we are fishing this year.
