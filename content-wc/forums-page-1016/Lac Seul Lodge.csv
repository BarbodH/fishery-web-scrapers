Can't say enough good things, The Lodge was VERY nice,Boats were EXCELENT (17' lunds/new 40 hp yamaha 4 stokes),advise from Dan (the owner) was right on the money.Even the weather cooperated. Fished Sawmill on Sunday.First fish--24"" Biggest all day,But lots close & too many to count.Mon started rainey tried to get to Broad - too rough,chickend out & stayed close to camp, Cleared out in aft. Got lots eaters & some in slot in Otter bay. Tues. got to broad (got a little lost bring gps)Lots of boats in creek got in end of line at lake entrance. Pitched jigs & spinners close to shore & pulled fish in on almost every cast.Wed was our best day (back to Broad). 4 guys, 2 boats pulled in over 350 fish including 5 Northerns ( biggest 35""!!) & maybe 5-6 perch--all the rest WALLEYE.In the aft. switched from altimiter creek entrance to beach area at No. end (east of sunset entrance). Backtrolled all aft. w/ spinners Last hour 6-7 pm boated over 100 walleyes Larger fish were on outside of weed bed about 30 feet from shore. Thurs.,back to broad did ok ,wanted to try Sunset. Found more northern (35"" & 36"") no really large walleyes but plenty in or just under slot. Fri was off & on rain we went to the grassy bay at the S.E. end of Big Island for Northern We found 'em!(just like Dan said)Must have caught 20-25 from 20"" to 37"" lots of follows till we put on anything yellow or chartruse. Since we were limited out on Walleyes & northerns finished out the aft. back in otter Bay (far end) for a bunch of perch found the biggest walleye of the week hiding in with 'em. Don't listen to folks that say minnows ONLY in the spring. 1/2 way thru the week we went up to Ear Falls (get Tired of eating fish!?!)talked to nice lady at 4 seasons bait & bought 1lb. of leaches worked just as well & can catch 4-6 walleye before you need to re-bait.Still went thru 46 DOZEN!! minnows @2.25 it adds up! Will definetly use more leaches next year. One more IMPORTANT NOTE ! stay legal on #'s & slots $250 fine for slot fish & we DID get stopped south of camp (on trip home) every body got pulled over to check coolers & licences 502 north is ok ,south is full of nasty potholes Some construction on 105 didn't get held up to bad. Can't see any reason to detour around it. Sure were a LOT of trucks/boats from Iowa comming up 6/2 anybody left in Iowa?"

513017,Guest,2001-06-06 08:26:00,0,"Thanks for the report Tim, that sounds like an awesome week! I'd like to hear more about how you did on Sunlight. Last year we made it to Broad, but weather turned nasty before we tried the run into Sunlight and choose to bolt back to the cabin. Very curious about Sunlight.There were at least five fishermen left in Iowa that week because everyone from my party was here! We're not going this year, but I'm always gathering information on Lac Seul!"
