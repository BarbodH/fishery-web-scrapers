512980,Winnie,2001-06-04 06:26:00,375,"Just returned home late last week from four days at Goose Bay camp. The weather and fishing were tremendous. Spent the first morning at the mouth of the Wenesaga. Most of the several boats there were anchored and throwing jigs/minnows and letting the current take them to the fish. We caught all we wanted. After lunch we went back to a spot we found last year near the opening of Sawmill bay and really caught some nice fish w/ Jigs and minnow again. Second day we decided to run down to Broad Lake south of McKenzie Bay. Our 30s got us down there in a little over an hour, but it was well worth the trip. Not one minute into to lake and one of our party caught a 29.5"" eye. We spent the whole day slowly moving up and down the first one hundred yards on either side of the mouth of Altimeter Creek casting up ot the bank and slowly jigging back to the boat. We caught all we wanted and more. That area became quite popular by the middle of the day as there were roughly 20-25 boats in the immediate area. Third day was considerably slower as a front had moved in over night. We stayed at our spot near Sawmill and did ok. Caught some decent sized fish (20-22"")but quantity was way down.On the fourth day a couple of us made another run to Broad. The fishing wasn't quite as hot as the second day, but it was still great. Some people were starting to fish Altimeter Creek, so the 'eyes may have been starting to move up it and out into the main lake. I know the river opened on Friday and the fishing was expected to be hot, but I had already gone home, so I don't know how things went. Thanks to all who gave tips and advise. We ad a great time."
512981,Guest,2001-06-04 16:27:00,0,WinnieThanks for the report! Glad you had a great time.Couple of questions..What was the lake level like? High/low?What was the water temp?What was the air temps like?Depths of fish caught?Thanks again!
512982,Winnie,2001-06-04 17:26:00,375,"MP,Sorry, I forgot to include that data with my report. The water was much higher than last year. At least a foot, maybe more. One place in particular we noticed was a sand beach where we had a couple shore lunches last year was completely under water this year. We could tell on the ride up that they had had a lot of water. All of the creeks were very high and a few miles south of the camp the water was actually over the road. Our best fishing was in about 55-60 degree water. In fact Broad was about 59 degrees. We were catching fish in relatively shallow water. In broad it was anywhere from 2-3 feet near shore out to 10-12 feet. The last day on Broad we found a gravel bar off a point in 5 to 5.5 feet of water that held a lot of fish. The weather was great. Three of the days were sunny, around 60-65 degrees and the big water was glass. We couldn't believe it. One day had a front go through and the temp dropped to around 50 degrees. Hope that helps."
512983,Guest,2001-06-05 16:14:00,0,Thanks for the feed back.Headin up 6/23 and can't wait. Can't believe the water is that high. Last year it was also high. Then out of 14 days it rained 12.5 days. Guess there isn't any problems getting over the reef between the 2 islands just sw of camp! Remember one year you had to go around the second island otherwise people were banging lower units.Thanks again fer the report!
512984,MNBS,2001-06-06 03:56:00,13,"I am heading to Goose Bay on the 16th. Great to see water temp that warm. That isn't much different than the water temp in southern Minnesota. When I hear about 29.5"" walleyes, it makes these last 10 days seem awfully long. I can't wait to get there!! I will probably miss you guys because we are leaving on the 22nd, but good luck to you and pray for sun this year. Last year it rained every day and the high temp was in the 50's most of the time. I will post a report when I return.Bob"
