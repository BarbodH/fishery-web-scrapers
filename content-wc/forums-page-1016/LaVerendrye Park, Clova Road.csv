512932,Guest,2001-06-05 06:46:00,0,"dean, were you at o'sullivan lodge? 2 inches of snow sounds better to me than clear skies and 90 degrees. if you were at o'sullivan how did you folks do with the walleye or were you up for pike and lake trout? thx for any response."
512933,Dean,2001-06-05 17:47:00,60,Bruce I talked to you a couple months back on this web site about maps and lures to use...I mentioned your name to Mike and he knows you well...Feel free to email me about our trip...
