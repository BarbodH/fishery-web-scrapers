We were there for one day so we stayed where the fish were biting. Other guys in our group caught a lot of fish on Chase lake. Didn't have time to go to Eagle lake, catching too many fish. Trolling the standard Rapala long brown minnow with a steel liter. Even the muskie were nailing our lures. Had a great time. Good luck!"
