513027,Sunshine,2001-06-05 09:41:00,3174,I will be heading up to Lake of the Woods in a couple of weeks and was wondering how the fishing was. We'll be putting our boats in at Nester Falls and traveling to an Island called King's Island. Any suggestions on location or lures would be greatly appreciated.Thanks You
