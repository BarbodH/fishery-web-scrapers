513070,Keith,2001-06-06 04:54:00,48,Going to Armstrong and was wondering if anyone has been on rt 17 between the Soo and Thunder Bay lately? Any road work??
513071,Bucks Rogers,2001-06-06 15:26:00,43,Went as far WaWa over Memorial weekend. They are working on several streches. The delays weren't too long though. Would expect intermitent road work all the way to TB. Winters are tough on highways up here and good weather to repair them is short. Have a good tripBucks
