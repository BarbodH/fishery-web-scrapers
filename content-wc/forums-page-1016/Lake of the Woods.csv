512863,AlwaysLearning,2001-05-30 04:48:00,13,My friends and I will be heading to LOTW and will be fishing out of Morson. We will be houseboating from June 10th to the 17th. Can anyone provide links to a site that can provide fishing reports on LOTW. Anyone have a current report? We will be fishing for both smallmouth and walleye. Does anyone know if the smallies have spawned yet? Thanks.
512864,AlwaysLearning,2001-06-05 12:26:00,13,I'm still hoping that someone can provide a current report on the Morson area of LOTW. Have the high water levels on LOTW impacted the smallmouth spawn? Current water temps and fishing methods for smallies and walleye would be appreciated. Thanks
