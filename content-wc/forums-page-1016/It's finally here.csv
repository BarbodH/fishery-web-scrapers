By the time we leave for NW Ontario on June 2, it will have been exactly 360 days since my buddies and I got together and started making plans. Since that day, there has not been an hour the trip has been out of my mind. As far as buying tackle-- a new Bass Pro Shop opened five minutes from my house last fall--- need I say more? Have a ggod trip."
512537,GregK,2001-05-17 07:31:00,113,"1. Seems like this is a common malady that we all share. It must be like purgatory, can't be any worse.2. See my comment to Haps under ""I can smell it"" for something to do while you are waiting.3. As for Grant, why don't you just stab a knife in the rest of us. Nobody should be allowed to live in that heaven up there."
512538,duffy,2001-06-04 12:10:00,49,"All,Thank you for posts. They were all great. At least I know that I am not alone. I leave in 3days 10 hours and 16 minutes. One last question:Is there a patch availabe similar to the tobacco patch for canadian fishing withdrawl for when I get back. LOL. Good luck to all.Duffy"
512539,Guest,2001-06-04 14:02:00,0,"Hey guys, even us Canadians suffer the same symptoms. Sometimes it's worse, because we don't have as far to go, but there's work, family, etc. Anyway, my trip starts June 8, for 9 days. I can't wait.So...to all of our Southern neighbours who will be visiting us: Welcome! We're glad to have you. The appreciation and respect you show are greatly appreciated. Maybe that's the Canadian attitude, but it makes us feel good when others enjoy that which is our own. Catch a bunch, let the big ones go, and if any of you are in Saskatchewan, let me know via the Board."
512540,Guest,2001-06-04 15:24:00,0,"we are all in this together .i watch (the red green show ) and that red says we are all in this together and i am pulling for you. 2 years ago i took all of the catalogs and sent them to the curb .on sundays after the first of the year ,my wife ties a chain to my foot on sundays and takes the charge card ,check book and keep them all day .when the grass turns green and when i head north i have more money and nerves when i go . by the way i will be in dryden this friday night for a week . remeber, we are all in this together. umpie"

Tremendous Pike and Lakers. Last year had a 21,21 and 23lb pike real weight s on digital scales not camp scales. Will post after the trip this year."
512526,duffy,2001-05-14 07:32:00,49,"I don't know about you guys but this time of year makes feel like a little kid again. Spring is here the ice is out in most of Canada and I can't sleep until I head north in early June. Here are my questions:How do I stop buying fishing gear that I must have but will probobly never use?How do you spell probobly?How do I stop playing with my rods in my basement thinking that a 10 pound walleye or 30 pound northern is about to slam my bait?How the ##### do I stop coming back to this message board?How do I stop going through my fishing box to make sure I packed everything three weeks prior to my trip?Any suggestions to make the next three weeks go faster and then make my one week in paradise last longer?Why do we park on driveways and drive on parkways?How do I get the smell of fresh cooked walleyes out of my senses until I actually cook them on the shore of a beautiful canadian lake?Does any one else suffer from this disease? Am I alone out there? Does anyone know of any support groups I can particpate in?The answer to many of your questions is yes, I have too much time on my hands three long friggin weeks to be exact. Well, good luck on your trips up north and LET THE GAMES BEGIN!!!! Please posts trip reportsDuffy"
512527,Byron,2001-05-14 08:53:00,42,"1. You spell probobly - P R O B A B L Y, unless you are from Texas, then you have spelled it correctly.2. You probably do not have a problem, so the other questions do not need to be answered.3. Eat lots of Walleye, get plenty of rest, and keep your line in the water. This will cure anything."
512528,Guest,2001-05-14 09:16:00,0,"Duffy-I suffer from the same malady. I have less than 2 weeks before we leave for Jackfish, Ottertail and Albert lake, and I'm so anxious I can hardly stand it! This will be the 31st trip that my brothers, my Dad and I have made.For me, I start dreaming about catching fish about a month or 2 before the trip. I also have to restrain myself from buying more gear because invariably what always works the best (for us) is jigs and minnows, and hand-made lindy rigs.Is there anything better after spending all day fishing than a nice cocktail, a crackling campfire, and fresh walleye? I hate to even take a short afternoon nap up there for fear I might miss out on something ......"
512529,Dean,2001-05-14 14:28:00,60,"Duffy, I thought I was reading about myself...I too am counting the days...As for the ability to pass up a lure at the sporting goods store...Just forget about it and keep buying..There is no known cure....All those new, mirrored finished, brightly colored lures are just too hard to resisit..They sure do catch fisherman...I have two teenage sons that get my old lures. I clean out old ones once a year to make room for the new ones...You never know what might be that one lure that really catches the fish the week you are there...Have fun on your trip..."
512530,Guest,2001-05-15 06:59:00,0,"I think it's called cabin fever. Don't fight it the only cure is to get out in a boat & catch walleyes! My buddies & I are leaving in 10 days,5 hours & 9 mins. We've been counting down for over 100 days & we have spent more Than 168 hours (one full week) Planning,shopping,dreaming,trying out new gear,Reading every thing we can find about Canada & walleyes. Will post report 6/3/01 Hang in there we're almost there!!!!!11"
512531,Guest,2001-05-15 08:08:00,0,"I thought I was alone in the complete obsessive-compulsive catagory. But you guys are lucky. I have to miss Canada this year! How bad is effecting me? Let's just say I'm counting each of the 423 days left before I leave on July 12, 2002!Relax Duffy, you're on the homestretch!"
512532,Wenty,2001-05-16 11:03:00,15,"Duffy,You've got it bad, but it's not abnormal! On purchasing tackle, view it as doing your part in spurring on the economy. As for spelling, it's never been a prerequisite for going fishing, so who cares. Only one week to fish in Canada? I pity you. Move there or atleast closer to it. Vaccum pack that walleye. I had some last week from last summer and it was delicious. My backyard looks like a scene from my lake, only minus the lake. If all else fails suck down about 9 ""Blues"" and you'll be fine.Have a great week up north, and good luck!"
512533,Guest,2001-05-16 11:44:00,0,I AM IN THE SAME BOAT MAN!!!! I AM 29 YEARS OLD AND HAVE THE PRIVELIGE OF MY FATHER AND GRANDFATHER TAKING ME TO CANADA SINCE I WAS 7 YEARS OLD.

512535,Guest,2001-05-16 19:17:00,0,"Duffy, you know you are not alone. My wife tells me fishing is a cult. The other day, I was diving to a sales call and I passed a fishing store, drove in and parked then realized I didn't know what the ##### I was there for! So, I went in to ""look around"" and walked out with $40.00 worth of stuff I might use some day. Ain't it amazing how little the bag is with $40.00 worth.... a couple of crank baits, jigs, a spool of line and your on your way. By the way guys, I'm from Winnipeg and all that talk of comin' to Canada warms my heart. Was out last weekend for the opener...just an hours drive...one should apreciate it. Goin' on a fly in first week in June an hour and a half north of here...hey, I better go buy some really big plugs and spoons!!!!"
