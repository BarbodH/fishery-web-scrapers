510001,IaCraig,2001-04-13 19:46:00,434,"Depends what I want to do. If I want to fish walleyes or Muskies it is Paradise Cove 1 in Minaki. The bare basics, roof, screens on windows, electricity, stove & fridge, docks, running water, toilet paper and an owner who is a true fisherman and will help you be one too. Oh yes, cheap rates too. If I want to be pampered, meals cooked for me, dishes and clothes washed for me and all that jazz, I'll stay home with my beautiful wife. Of course if she wants to be pampered we go out to eat, or on a Princes Cruise. Fish while you can, winter is gettin closer......IaCraig"

510002,Ray,2001-05-15 13:32:00,96,I'm staying at the Scout Lake Resort outpost on Mckenzie Bay in August. First trip to Canada-got the walleye bug real bad and I've never even caught one!Anyone have any experience with this outpost or this area of the lake?Thanks
509972,Rob,2001-05-23 11:29:00,103,"TangledAngler, my family and I were there June '88. The pike and walleye fishing was not very good. Maybe we picked a bad week. I would like to go back. What week/month have you found to provide the best pike/walleye and panfish fishing? Over the past five years have you seen the fish quantity/quality decrease? Does Jerry and his wife still run the camp? Do you know if they have a web site?Thanks,Rob ([email protected])"

509980,Guest,2001-02-22 18:42:00,0,"We started to go to South Bay Lodge in 1968, when they just opened the road to the mine. It used to be a trappers trading post. Fishing was excellent then, Lots of 20 plus Northerns, even have one on our wall now. Lake trout were really good then also, but had to portage for the Walleyes. I would imagine over the years the fishing pressure has gotten that lake too. We fished that lake for 15 years and did really good.Now we have found lots of better places.Thanks[email protected]"

509971,TangledAngler,2001-02-26 12:53:00,65,"Sandy Haven Camp on Lake Nipissing near the mouth of the French River. Been going there for the last 15 years and have no plans to stop. Walleye, smallmouth, largemouth, pike, perch and muskie! The scenery is breathtaking and the hosts are both friendly and fun. You ocassionally have an audience while you're in the boat, e.g. bear and moose!"

509975,Jim,2001-04-08 13:26:00,238,My favorite resort is Happy Landing's Resort on Pipestone. our family has been going here now for ten straight years. The small mouth bass fishing is unreal. Last year our biggest smallie was twenty two inches long. The many portage lakes are great. The muskie fishing is explosive. Last year we caught six over foty three inches. I am convinced this is one of Ontario's best kept secrets.
509994,Guest,2001-04-09 05:46:00,0,Boat in fishing for all the species that Lake of the Woods is known for. Whitefish Bay Camp is great. Like being at an outpost but very modern and great hospitality. www.whitefishbaycamp.com

509985,Guest,2001-01-08 13:56:00,0,"I recommend Birch Island Resort on the Winnipeg River or Chaudiere Lodge on the upper French River. Both have great food and lodgings. The fishing is better on the Winnipeg River, but there is 3 chefs who prepare the food at Chaudiere Lodge if you like gormet food. Both have web pages. Good fishing, Don"
509986,Tracy,2001-01-11 06:35:00,376,"Look into Wildewood at www.wildewoodflyin.com. Here you will have a full 6 days of fishing. You will catch walleyes on nearly every cast once you locate a school. 100 fish per day is common even during cold fronts and pouring rain. IE last year!! Been there 6 times now, and will be going again this June. Their website tells it all.Tracy"
509987,Rob,2001-01-11 09:59:00,103,"My favorite lake to fish in ontario is Pipestone lake. My family an I have stayed at a resort called Happy Landing Lodge on the north end of the lake. It a beautiful american plan resort. At this resort along with pipestone we have the opportunity of fishing 12 other portage in lakes. If you want to talk about fishing, I have not seen better fishing in ontario in 13 years. If you want to have a good time and catch alot of fish check out happy landing lodge."
509970,Guest,2001-01-25 16:39:00,0,I would highly recommend Tomahawk Resort (www.tomahawkresort.com). The cottages are kept up very well looking just like new and really clean. I heard that their building a new 3 bedroom this winter. The Kast's and staff are super and bend over backwards to make sure that your happy. The boats included in the package are amazing. I've never rented a boat so nice before. The 17' Lund fishing boats with 40 hp four strokes are the best fishing rigs I've ever ran. All the equipment is new. I've made reservations there again this August and can't wait to get up there and fish!! RD
509988,Guest,2001-01-25 18:20:00,0,I like Happy Landing Lodge. I've fished in canda for years and this is the best one as far as I'm concerned. I recommend it to all my friends.

Muskies along with smallies and trout are great all year. It is newly owned and all new equipment. Guide boats are 17' crestliners rigged with 50 hp yamahas and hondas. Food and service are first class! Along with reasonable rates, this is one resort I srongly suggest anyone look into.Seth"

509978,Guest,2001-01-02 18:03:00,0,You must not be much of a fisherman! If you couldn't catch fish at South Bay Lodge! The lodge is a boat-in that is as remote as any fly-in I have been to in Canada. (Oh I have been going to Canada for 42 years now) I too have been to all types of lakes too so you must be just posting to get a reaction! Happy New Year!
509982,Guest,2001-01-03 10:00:00,0,Why? How is the fishing? Is there a lot of pressure? Lot's of traffic? Accomodations? Tranquility?
509983,Guest,2001-01-03 10:33:00,0,"Scout Lake Resort south of Ear Falls. It's nearby the hot spots on Lac Seul and fishing on Scout Lake is pretty good too, especially when the big lake gets really rough. Cabins are okay, but who spends much time in them anyway? Didn't need much help from the folks at camp, we got too much good info from guys here at WC.com! www.fishlacseul.com Tell them the psychotic creeps from Iowa sent you."
509984,BD,2001-01-07 23:00:00,739,Thanks for the responces! The reason I asked in the first place was that my wife loves to fish but due to family circumstances we have not been able to take a vacation togeather for nine years. I would take her to Press Lake (housekeeping cabins only) but their rates are based on a group of four and she would like a place with a few more amenities. Thanks again and feel free to suggest others (the library is short of reading material :) and what better way to spend the time in there besides going through brochures).
