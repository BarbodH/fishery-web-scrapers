We fished mostly Muskie and caught some nice pike in the process. Also caught plenty of walleye. It's a long boat ride in (39mi) but well worth the trip. We are going up again in September. I think the owners names are Ken and his wife Brenda, nice people and I understand they are staying at the camp now whereas they used to have a few guys running things on that end.Paul"
