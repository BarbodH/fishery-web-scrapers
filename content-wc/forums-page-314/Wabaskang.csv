3012481,cough6609,2014-07-19 18:49:00,48,"Big Mike, I've been up to Wabby numerous times, but never in late August...any advice? Craig"
3012657,billy weaver,2014-07-19 19:57:00,470,"I haven't put in the time fishing Wabaskang as Big Mike has, but have fished late August out of Peffley's Camp a few times. We usually fish the fifth week of the season on Wabaskang. I did go in August with guys who fish August every year for many years. We did have good luck fishing the outside edges of weed beds next to deep water using nightcrawler rigs. Some of the water around Doe island and what we call North Point in Mean Lake was very good. It was different than June as we fish shallower weed bed edges as in Gawley's Bay. The weather was like the middle of June with cooler nights I liked it. Good luck."
3019154,Stu,2014-07-22 06:58:00,472,"Hey Big Mike, glad to see you're back! I've missed the Wabby posts from you and TrailerGuy. Hope everything is going well for you."
2952193,JAY221,2014-06-30 12:41:00,877,"Thanks for the responses guys, that is exactly what I was looking for. Keep them coming. Later, Jay"
2968017,Big Mike,2014-07-06 00:39:00,35,"Its been a few years since I've posted a report but since I spend a considerable amount of time on Wabaskang (5 weeks a year) I thought I would get back to sharing what I have learned and know most recently. Obviously this year is crazy with the high water levels. First week of June the walleye fishing was awesome with most of our fish coming from 3 to 5 feet of water, but thats old news and a trip I will never forget! I just returned today from a week long trip. Water still high but the fish don't seem to mind. Walleyes continue to be very shallow although most are being caught 8 to 12 feet of water for my group. I have mainly been fishing areas around Jim's which include Keynote, Ruby, Aerobus, and McCloud. Keynote has been on fire all of June, which I believe the fish are hanging down there later because of the cool water temps and high water. Best presentation has been spinners w/crawlers and also pitching jigs/minnow or jigs/crawler into the cabbage weeds. We have done really well in the evenings all over the lake throwing jerk baits in the weeds too. It seems catch and release has really helped as we have caught numerous fish over 22 inches going all the way up to 30 inches this year. Normally I am a huge big lake fan especially for northern but I can honestly say this year I have done really well on the south portions. However, I see things changing drastically in the next few weeks as we started to get alot of action off of devils, doe, and the other points in the big lake with the walleyes starting to migrate out of gawleys and indian narrows. very few mayflies last week but i did see a large hatch of very small ones on Thursday in different areas of the lake. i hope with the high water it is a little smaller hatch this year. Northern fishing has been pretty fair but we havent put a consistent big fish pattern together yet. A few 40 inch plus fish each trip but not the double digit number of piggies that we have been used to. (See Jim's website photo album of Kristy's mammoth 42 incher caught July 2 if he gets it posted soon) I blame this on cool water temps causing them to not chase our musky baits as much and also the fact that the high water has them scattered around not using the traditional weed edges...yet! I have found a few very good cabbage beds starting to develop and that where we have found our 40s. Hang on fellas as those weeds are starting to come in now! I have resorted to pulling cranks above weed tops as my mainstay so far in spite of my love to catch these amazing Wabaskang gators by casting. But you have to do what the fish are telling you... Smallies are on fire everywhere you find boulders and rock points. Just throw a topwater in the morning or evening and go have fun with it! Some absolute footballs swimming around this year. AS FAR AS THE NEXT FEW WEEKS GO....I would be prepared to fish 10 to 15 feet of water with crawlers and spinners or troll crankbaits primarily. I would also be ready to cast cranks like Rogues or Huskyjerks into fresh cabbage on the deeper weed edges in the evenings. Most of my 28"" plus walleyes up there come from the cabbage all summer, usually after supper (which is usually fresh walleye and a few labatts.) Guys just don't think to much into it and have a good time. The true beauty of it is the fact that time on the water will be your best tip I can give. Have fun and report back, its fun to hear how everyone turns out! I will continue to post reports after each trip, my next one is coming the end of July."
2968169,JAY221,2014-07-06 06:09:00,877,"Thanks for the info Mike. you have safe trips back & forth. I believe you hit something a couple of years ago didn't you??? I am sure we will have fun. Later, Jay"
2972769,derek204,2014-07-07 15:14:00,56,"Awesome info thanks, we going on the 19th to Kingfisher. We did real well in the spring. I'm looking forward to just being on that lake, I love it there."
2979321,JIGSTER,2014-07-09 10:46:00,30,"Mike, thank you for the detailed update!! This will be just our second year on the lake so i am still try to learn as much i can about the lake. My son really wants to fish for some of the big northerns so that will be alot of our focus after some walleyes for table fare!Derek we will be at Kingfisher the same week. I will be with my wife and teenage son. I will be fishing out of 16' white alumnacraft. Look forward to meeting you, maybe over a cold barley!!! My name is RickWould love to hear anybody elses reports after this week."
2979793,Big Mike,2014-07-09 12:34:00,35,"Jay, thanks for the kind words, and yes, we did have a few bad collisions last few years. 4 or 5 years ago we totalled my wife's equinox just north of vermillion bay at 10:30 in the morning when we hit a monster buck whitetail, and then a year ago i hit another monster buck whitetail with my ford f150 at 2:30 in the afternoon again just outside of vermillion bay! Luckily it was driveable and only needed 2500 dollars of work done. Crazy thing is both deer came flying up out of the ditch in daylight hours, completely out of nowhere! If I would have been on a motorcycle I would be pushing up daisies!Good luck on your trip..."
2979841,Big Mike,2014-07-09 12:39:00,35,"Rick, the northern fishing should really start to take off soon. I expect them to stay in the shallows as cool as this summer has been. If not don't be afraid to work the deep weedlines and occasionally cast out to the deep water away from the weeds as they will often suspend out a cast length away in the cooler water and come into the edges only temporarily to feed. I will look for you, I'm in a blue/silver Ranger 620. Where are u from in Iowa? I'm from Allison. Later, Mike"
2981817,JIGSTER,2014-07-10 05:43:00,30,"Mike i am from south of Fort Dodge. What would be a couple of lure choices you would start with for casting the shallow weeds? And would those change if you went to fishing the deeper weed edges? 9 days and counting....the only thing that could wrinkle our plans would be an unusauly deep run into the high school baseball playoffs...could delay us a couple of days, either way it will be a fun week!!"
2990465,derek204,2014-07-13 07:50:00,56,Sounds good! I will have the whole family up there too! we will definitely have to have a cold one together!
3005650,JIGSTER,2014-07-17 09:51:00,30,"Well our trip is on hold for a couple of days..the boys had a big win on the baseball diamond last night. We will be staying and playing sat. night now. if we lose we will then hit the road north and be in camp sunday afternoon, but if we were to win again this years trip would not happen... o well either way something good will be happening! Derek maybe you will have a pattern figured out by the time we would get there and i could get some advise out of you over that cold one! lol"
2943481,JAY221,2014-06-27 14:10:00,877,"We will be up in 2 weeks @ Tall Pines. Anybody got any info on the lake conditions & the fishing to share with us? Thanks, Jay"
2943545,trapper_john,2014-06-27 14:33:00,83,"Jay, we will be at Kingfisher at the same time. If I hear anything, I'll post it. Check out Kingfisher on face book. There are a couple of posts there. Last that I heard the water is pretty high yet."
2944185,Fred_G,2014-06-27 18:22:00,908,Check out Andrea's blog. She has lots of good info.http://tallpinescamp.wordpress.com/
2944241,JAY221,2014-06-27 18:43:00,877,"I read all the camps on Wabaskangs blogs just thought I might get somebody that has been there recently to chime in on how it was. Later, Jay"
2944257,JAY221,2014-06-27 18:46:00,877,"Fred, You just had to run with Andrea's use of the word ""lot"" didn't you!!! LOL, Later, Jay"
2944337,tooski,2014-06-27 19:15:00,393,"Jay, Nothing to do with Wabaskang fishing- just wanted to say thanks again for your donations to the disabled vets trip ... We'll be leaving about 2 weeks after your group. Good fishing to you....."
2944361,JAY221,2014-06-27 19:22:00,877,"tooski, I thank you for all you do for them guys. Do you have everything covered @ this point? Later, Jay"
2944633,tooski,2014-06-27 20:45:00,393,"Damm I hope so. Ronnie was in Long Island the last two weeks getting his new guide dog. His last one died last year at the age of 12. I told him Jay would be a good name for his new dog, lol. Hidden Bay has been excellent so far. I think I am looking forward to the trip more than the vets.."
2950881,UKBDM,2014-06-30 07:52:00,178,"Just got back yesterday. 5th year at Jim & Julie's Wabaskang Camp. Unbelievable week of walleye fishing. Combination of great conditions and our improving knowledge of the lake. Great camp owner helps a lot also!Water (8-10"") across 105 just north of VBay on Sat am on way up. Dry on Sat am on way back. Lake was 3' higher than normal early in the week but came down a little as week progressed. Some sort of hatch was starting on Friday in North Bay but not anywhere else. Fished the big lake more than usual but still stayed south most of the time. Lots of boats in the second narrows with good reports from guys in our camp that fished there. Many of them were throwing crankbaits (Rogues/Husky Jerks) and catching bigger fish.Lots of eater size fish (12-15"") early in the week in 6-8' of water. Fish were right up against the bank in the flooded rock/bushes. 1/8-1/4 oz jig/grub combo tipped with piece of crawler was the ticket. Color of either didn't seem to matter. Jig/minnow got better as week progressed but preference varied by the hour sometimes.Later in week we started boating the bigger fish in a little deeper water (8-12') but still related to shoreline. Friday am in 15-20 min I caught and released a 17', 19"", 22"", 24"", and my personal best 27.5"" by dragging a 1/4 oz chartreuse jig/3"" white grub tipped with crawler. Wind was blowing into a shoreline with new weed growth just starting in about 6-8' of water. Fish hit just outside the edge.Walleye fishing was so good I spent very little time pike fishing. Did take son/nephews smallmouth fishing a few times. Very intermittent with nothing on topwater. A Rebel crawdad seemed to be best thrown right up into the bushes/rocks.I don't count fish very much but two boats caught 50 plus walleye in 90 min Wed am a new spot we found on the big lake. That is great in my world!"
2952009,billy weaver,2014-06-30 11:53:00,470,"Was at Peffley's on the north-end of the lake. The water was very high, as high as I have ever seen it in 26 years. The fishing was good but we had to adjust to the late spring more than the high water. We usually fish along the outside edges of pencil reeds but the new growth was no where in sight. The fish we caught were nice fish with good numbers over 18"". The hot time for us was 9:30 to 10:00 PM jigging straight down in 12ft. of water using jigs tipped with nightcrawler. I am sure you will do well. Be sure and keep your bug spray handy if fishing late."
