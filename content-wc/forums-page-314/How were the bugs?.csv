3019386,deadhead1,2014-07-22 07:51:00,193,Those ankle biters are terrible right now. Long pants are the only solution and I hate wearing pants in summer. I am going to look for some mesh pants.
3019418,515,2014-07-22 07:59:00,254,Surprisingly we had our lightest year ever for bugs this year on Little Miss lake until the last night when they all came out to say hello to us. I didn't even use bug spray till that last evening.
3019882,Bill Krejca,2014-07-22 09:43:00,6107,"Experienced the same ""fly along"" out the truck window last week. I don't believe I've ever seen this before. I think they were trying to worn us about the mosquitoes we were going to encounter! When we stopped alongside the road for a quick break, surprisingly we were not attacked. Mosquitoes were very plentiful at camp. Used coils in the cabin, and a large Roman candle type thing that we lit and stuck in the ground next to the camp fire. Along with spraying a circle around the camp fire, sitting out at night was pleasant and very little blood letting was experienced by all. Bill"

3008425,Hump,2014-07-18 08:04:00,578,"Were bad, but I have a thermal cell and no problem. Well worth the money"
3008705,mswope13,2014-07-18 09:18:00,73,"Heading up to Ear Falls with lines wet in 7 days, 3 hours, but who's counting?? I would also like to hear about the nasty ankle biters. Any word from those that returned from that area? Thanks in advance"
3008841,bigwalleye1,2014-07-18 09:31:00,2632,I heard two groups of 60 mosquitos debating whether they should eat me right there or drag me into the trees first.....
3008937,patricktjms,2014-07-18 09:53:00,67,"mosquitos were thick but tolerable with spray, the ankle biting flies drove me nuts unless there was a breeze to blow them away. The only thing i found to keep them away wass long pants and boots. The coppertone sport spray didnt work for me."
3009001,Lovetofish,2014-07-18 10:07:00,458,Bring bug dope and coils. Your gonna need them. The water will be very high and be careful on the road. We saw 5 moose and one dead one along the road.
3009537,Esox2hart,2014-07-18 12:55:00,3,The bugs were the worst I have ever seen in June! I hope it gets better for my August trip!!
3010729,Skywagon,2014-07-18 20:13:00,1106,"The bugs are about as bad as they get this year, at least in the areas I roam. I rate mosquitoes as bad, deer flies are just coming on , but seem about normal, ankle biters seem about normal, but the true black flies (look like baby flies) are still really bad, I have the bumps to prove it, they just don't seem to want to go away this year. Bring bug dope and try wool socks for the ankle biters."
3011921,rather-be-fishin,2014-07-19 14:18:00,429,I have found that this insect repellent definitely works for those ankle biting flies. They land & leave without biting. You do have to reapply frequently. Give it a try: http://whitemountaininsectrepellent.com One week to go & heading to Lac Seul! The packing & preparing has begun! RBF
3019306,zeebee,2014-07-22 07:31:00,1144,"Went for a drive down a forest road on the Manitoba/Ont border this weekend. Noticed large insects doing the wingman thing on both sides of the vehicle as we rolled along. Every once in a while they would do a kamikaze and smash into the window. Curious as to the type of bug, I slowed down and was able to identify them as swarms of horseflys. Never experienced anything like it. Like a scene out of Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" but worse.Fought off messages of immediacy from my bladder until we were well out of the area."
