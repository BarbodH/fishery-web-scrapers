3015345,Glenman12,2014-07-20 20:03:00,762,"Glad to help..we stay at Cedar Lake Lodge on the island south of you and trust me, theres tons of spots that produce south of Nelson...but also, tons that can produce on the east arm too..this year the south end was hot so only one trip to the east arm and one to Perrault..."
3016074,Clayshooter,2014-07-21 07:21:00,2,I want to thank you all for your responses. This is only my second trip to Canada and my first time on Cedar. Sure hope the kids have a good time. Thank you again.
3018794,1jigfish2,2014-07-21 22:33:00,110,"I would recommend using a jig and minnow, free bait, so you can keep it simple. With the kids, you may have to use up to 3/8's oz. make sure that they feel the bottom, that is where the fish are."
3008729,Clayshooter,2014-07-18 09:19:00,2,"Has anyone recently stayed at Northern Lights at the south end of Cedar Lake Ontario? I'm thinking of booking a trip with my son and two grandkids. Looking for walleye, smallies, and northern with enough action to keep my 11 & 13 year old grandson's attention. Thank you for your response."
3009385,troutwater,2014-07-18 12:19:00,299,"I've stayed there before, very nice camp. Cabins are very clean and they also have the best boats to rent on the lake. The upgraded cabins are very nice with AC and even TV. Price is real nice as well. I was up on Cliff last week and fished Cedar for a day. Pike is good(can be real good at times) and the walleye fishing this year is some of the best the lake has seen in a long time. I was fishing muskie and caught one 19 1/2 and had a few others chasing my muskie baits. Nephew fished for them for a bit and had no trouble picking them up. I haven't fished for smallmouth there before so I can't really comment. I have seen some nice catches though."
3010233,elkman99,2014-07-18 16:12:00,180,"Great camp and great prices. At this time of year the kids will stay free, and all your bait is included in the package. As stated above, great multi species fishing. The perch fishing can be outstanding with the chance of some nice crappies too."
3011065,Muskie Bob,2014-07-19 05:38:00,45,"Although we fish mainly for muskies, we do take some time to fish for a few walleye to eat and bring home. Last July we caught several walleye and small mouth bass using leeches. We didn't have to wait much for a fish to bite. The action was good and would keep your grandsons busy enjoying the action. Its nice that Northern Lights provides free bait. You should try both minnows and leeches to see which ones works the best."
3012945,jgar1865,2014-07-19 21:52:00,14,"Just got back from Canada yesterday. We stayed one night at Northern Lights Resort as we were flying into another lake with them the next day. The cabin we rented that night was small but clean and nice. The lodge owner, Karla, was very accommodating and we loved getting our live bait for free. We walked down to the dock and met a group of fisherman coming in. They said they have contemplated going to other lakes but ""the fishing is so **** good"" on Cedar L. that they don't want to risk going somewhere else. They had a full stringer of eater sized walleyes with some smallies and pike mixed in. Fish buckets in the cleaning house looked pretty full. They also commented that they can expect to pick up a few nice Musky every year as well. We used to fish at Cedar Lake when I was a kid. We always did well, nice big lake to explore. From what you said, this would probably be a great option for you."
3014033,1jigfish2,2014-07-20 11:12:00,110,"We have been going to Northern Lights for over 5 years, the last few twice a year. As others have mentioned: they will take care of you there, free bait adds up as a very big perk, best boats and motors on the lake by far, choose deluxe or regular cabin, fishing is awesome as you do not have to travel more than 2-3 miles and succeed. Did I mention free bait?"
3014569,ftfarms,2014-07-20 13:55:00,444,What part of the lake is northern light on. I've stayed at cedar point a few times and don't remember seeing northern lights. We always fish from Nelson lake to the east side of the lake. I'm interested in this northern lights. Thanks.
3014697,Glenman12,2014-07-20 14:54:00,762,its at the very south end of the west arm of the lake..
3014753,ftfarms,2014-07-20 16:13:00,444,Thanks Glenman. Any good fishing down that way in lat August or early September. I've got my spots on the other side the lake but would like to check more of the lake out.
3014905,Glenman12,2014-07-20 17:26:00,762,not sure about then because we go in the 3rd week of June but both Sawmill Bay and Hatfield Bay have been good producers and this year was no different..Northern lights is right outside of Sawmill and Hatfield is about 2 mins north..
