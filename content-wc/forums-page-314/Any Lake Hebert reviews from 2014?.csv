These days we bring what we need and pay the frieght. The road from mont st michael to parent was a little rough 40 mph, from parent to clove 50+ mph just over an hour, plan on the dirt road taking you 4 hrs, pee stops stretch breaks, photo opps. You will not mistake sea gull island once you find it in north big bay. I think there is deisel at both towns"
2977977,octanehi5,2014-07-09 03:43:00,1104,"For those of you headed up , the weather seams to be staying with below normal temps,. some days down right chilly no need to pack shorts, that rough weather makes for some great fishing on the lake just make sure you dress for it. July is not usualy like this. The lunds do well in rough water. Good luck"
2978201,psherbo,2014-07-09 06:20:00,13,Thanks! Very helpful!
2978321,fishron,2014-07-09 07:07:00,317,Windy shore in the evening.
2981721,octanehi5,2014-07-10 03:38:00,1104,Ron make sure you send the pics into Air Tamarac they are sure to make the net.or Brouchure. You guys did very well your first time on the lake. Kudo's
2987977,octanehi5,2014-07-12 03:12:00,1104,"The vortex returns this week, The temps we be 10 degrees below normal, Dress like its fall up on the Canadian shield lakes,Mornings will be in the upper 30's and low 40's. Fishing should be great as water temps stay cool,and drop makes for shallow jigging."
3016506,Ferrispata,2014-07-21 09:11:00,63,"Well we just got back from our 5 day trip to Lac Hebert with Air Tamarac. It was our first fly-in trip and obviously our first trip to Hebert. We were in cabin 25 in the north end which was the place to be at this time of year (mid July). Accomodations were great and definitely did not feel like roughing it (with 2 fridge/freezers, gas stove). Mosquitoes were quite abundant around dusk. 4 guys, 5 days, 517 walleye and 4 pike (not targeted). All but about 5 walleye were caught jigging. Mostly in 22-30 ft of water with some even in the 30-35 range and some were found in 15-22 ft. A 28 inch walleye, a 26.5 inch walleye, another 5 or so at 23 inches. One 30 inch pike. Not too bad with a little learning curve there. We had a great time. One day was very high winds and limited our fishing a lot. We had a delayed fly-in (around 6 hours) due to rain/visibility and were offered to delay our fly-out at no extra cost if we wanted which we did by flying out at 5pm instead of 10am. We spent the night prior to our fly-out at the old schoolhouse and the accomodations were pretty nice. And after flying back in we spent the night at the Hotel Tamarac. Air Tamarac is surely a professional and very friendly outfit, even one of their daughters was helping load/unload the plane. We managed to be only ~45 lbs over weight which we were happy about as we had given that much thought but we did not skimp on anything (OK maybe we could have used another 12-pack of beer). Knowing what we know now (although there is still much about the lake to learn), our numbers would surely increase next time. Hope the wives let us go again in a few years."
3017538,octanehi5,2014-07-21 14:33:00,1104,"Sounds like your group had a great time, not bad for your first time on the lac. Most people that fish this lake Return. This yr was my 11th yr on the lake, Air Tam is a great outfitter on the lakes they fish"
2956409,octanehi5,2014-07-01 14:45:00,1104,"Thanks Ron, I realy enjoyed your groups company,on the lake and shore lunch. Hebert is very depth sensitive, according to water temps,walleye chop,, bright and low light,I have caught walleyes jigging in 52 feet of water in July on a bluebird day no wind,also in less than a foot on wind choppy rainy days, What was the magic # yesterday will not work the next. I can tell you if you get a steady wind from the south or southwest the opening to the north back bay will be on fire, as well as clorox island, and the bouy east side across from big island, I placed a bouy near seagull island always hot, also a bouy in the big bay off of sea gull to the north east 100 yard hump in 40 feet of water. In the next two weeks the bite should be on fire. Good luck, Ron (octanehi5)"
2963962,a3dad,2014-07-04 05:48:00,115,"Hey guys thanks for the reports. Great reading. I've been to the Gouin with Air Tamarac for many trips but never Hebert. We mainly fish for pike in May. Question, is there any benefit going to Hebert to target pike? Looking for trophies and large numbers. and of course a few walleyes for dinner! Thanks! Kevin"
2964658,octanehi5,2014-07-04 10:08:00,1104,"iF I was basicly fishing for trophy pike I would stay at the gouin, Hebert is a virtual walleye factory, It does give up some nice pike,sometimes,I have seen 50inchers come from the gouin, but only 48 was the biggest seen on Hebert, I have a few friends on Hebert this week, coming out this sunday, Have to hear how well they did, they know all my hot spots. Mostly jig fishermen."
2965129,NY Walleye,2014-07-04 14:51:00,78,A3dad - there are some big pike caught out of lac charlotte which has one cabin on it. Walleye numbers are pretty good as well. You could give that a shot. We leave on Wednesday for a week on Hebert. Four people in the group staying on the north end. We will report once wwe return. Week in paradise.
2965785,octanehi5,2014-07-04 19:43:00,1104,good luck NY let us now how you made out
2973401,a3dad,2014-07-07 18:27:00,115,"octanehi5 - That's what I though but it was worth asking someone who knows and has been there. Gouin can be hit or miss with the big gals, especially with the weather in May. Always hoping for a late ice out and high water so we can catch them post spawn in the back bays. NY Walleye - I was thinking about Lac Charlotte but it looks small. We normally fish 10-12 hours a day so I think I'd cover the whole thing on the first day! Tight lines on Herbert!"
2974233,octanehi5,2014-07-08 03:50:00,1104,"If you are an adventurous fisherman, , Charlotte would get small quickly only 3 miles long lots of nice fish though. Hebert is my go to lake even after 11yrs on the lake we keep finding nice spots to fish, The population of keeps growing,with the 14 to 20"" slot limit,of keepers and only take 4 fish home policy. Your chances of catching some very nice sized fish, as well as big numbers. This last week two friends of mine were on the lake, got blown off for three days of 35+mph winds but still managed 175 in one day. Thats pretty good fishing in my book. I burnt out the anti reverce in two of my reels this yr. Top notch equipment is a must."
2974769,Ferrispata,2014-07-08 07:24:00,63,I forgot to ask. How were the dirt roads to Parent and then to Clova?
2975345,psherbo,2014-07-08 09:23:00,13,Heading to Lake Hebert for first time this week. Where is Gull Island? How has everyone done with weight? We are definitely over the 110lb allowance per man. Is there deisel fuel in Clova or Parent? Thanks.
2976033,fishron,2014-07-08 12:30:00,317,"It was our first time to Hebert so I can speak to some of the questions. We were overweight. A lot has to due with how serious your group is in keeping weight down. In my boat bag I had two 3700 series plastic boxes. One for plugs and spoons and one for jigs. I could have combined the two with an emphasis on jigs. We took three cases of water. Two would have been enough because we boiled and used their tap water with no ill effects. Three cases of beer, no reduction there. Three fifths of bourbon, two or three fingers each evening over ice. (absolutely essential) Good rain gear a must. One good warm garment and underwear for each day and the rest you can repeat daily as you wish. We took in two large 32 oz jars of peanut butter for sandwiches. Only needed one. Took in five pounds of potatoes. We had dried scalloped potatoes one night. Would forget the fresh and go with modern dried potatoes and mac and cheese, they were great. That being said, we took quality meats (frozen) and ate well. The propane fridges were great. The gravel road in was better than we've seen before. Three and a half hours to be safe. Between 40 and 50 mph but watch the turns. You could get in trouble if you don't. I drive a Honda Pilot and it's pretty sure footed. Have a great trip. I'd post some pictures of the big girls I caught if I could figure out how too."
2918241,Ferrispata,2014-06-20 08:01:00,63,We will be heading up in mid July and wanted to know if anyone has been this year yet and has any trip report? Thanks much.
2918297,TheDFP,2014-06-20 08:17:00,39,"We use the same outfitter as you, but fly into the Gouin. We went to Gouin from 7-14 June. Outfitter said Gouin was was actually better the first week of June. Did not get any report on the 14th when we left. Everybody was flying out and nobody was flying in when we were at the airbase. Should be great!"
2918689,vteye,2014-06-20 09:54:00,812,Not doing a trip this year and reading the reports is like the frozen concoction that helps me hang on...(Jimmy B)
2925921,Ferrispata,2014-06-23 07:56:00,63,Bump. Can't wait for some reports.
2934193,Ferrispata,2014-06-25 07:09:00,63,I know Ron should be getting back very shortly (or is back) and I am anxiously awaiting what he has to say about Lake Hebert. 2.5 weeks to go for us for our first trip up.
2934393,Freytown,2014-06-25 07:46:00,770,"Ron's trip is June 20-29, 2014...it will be a while until he gets back. Since Hebert is a catch & release lake, I'm sure fishing will be good. Weather is the only thing that would hurt the fishing at Hebert. Good luck on your trip."
2953649,octanehi5,2014-06-30 19:23:00,1104,"I like to report The lac is alive and well,59 Degree water temps as we arrived, In 9 days it was 70. The Walleye were still in post spawn mode early, the bite in windy weather was good,Alot of big girls were caught. 28 "" 8lbs the biggest, Two 27 ,three 25s,at least 10- 24s, and so on down, We did not return with any fish under 20 "" any thing over that went back in the lake with a few pics. taken. Their C & R system does work, keeping fish for shore lunch from 14 to 20 , makes for some great tasting lunches. As the week progressed, the bite got better,To boil it down Our group of 4 caught Over 800 Walleye, and 150 pike biggest pike was 37"" around 10 pounds, The biggest walleye were caught near the island, not far from were they spawn in the river, Alot of which are on the move to the bigger bowls up north, Sea gull Island was a Hot spot as always.Taking the honor of producing the most walleye, as well as a few 25s, Wind direction will play a big part of how and were the bite will be on. July will produce some very good numbers. The biggest walleye were caught on jigs, many walleyes were taken with swim baits of the 4 to 5"" range worked very well in the shallow and rocky areas, bottom bouncers worked ok in the bluebird sky days with no wind, stick baits worked well with windy choppy conditions. Nine days on one of Quebec's biggest walleye factories. PRICELESS. For those of you who are going up shortly, and have never been, get ready for the fishing trip of your life. If your not going be sure to put it on your bucket list. I'm booked for 2015 And looking to fill a two person slot in my camp. next yr same Week. Good luck Walleye Ron"
2954465,Guest,2014-07-01 06:08:00,0,"Many thanks to Ron (Octanehi5). Our groups shared a shore lunch which Ron graciously invited us to, shortly after our arrival on Saturday. It was our first time on hebert, four of us, and we had a great 7 days catching around 600 walleyes. Good fish came our way, 24, 25's, multiple 27's, multiple 28s and topped off by a 30. We didn't fish pike much but a 36 inch came our way. Hebert is a great lake and Air Tamarac runs a high quality service in all ways. All of my group were extremely pleased with our first true fly-in experience and hope to return next year. As in all walleye fishing, the weather always plays a major part in your success, as does familiarity of the lake. Hebert will only get better for us."
2954505,Ferrispata,2014-07-01 06:19:00,63,Thanks Ron and Ronfin. Our group of 4 is heading up on our first fly-in as well in about a week and a half and we are stoked! I guess I better start packing soon. I have a general collection area in the basement that I need to put into some order. We are staying in one of the two north camps. What kind of depths's were you catching them at? What were daytime and nighttime air temps like? Thanks again. Jerry
2955193,Guest,2014-07-01 08:55:00,0,"I would defer to Ron. The man is a walleye catching machine and has great knowledge of Hebert. At the north end the magic depth seemed to be 23-24ft. All our big ones came in the evening in as little as 10 ft of water in the south. The weather can be all over, cool nights and days or frying pan hot. It's the luck of the draw."
