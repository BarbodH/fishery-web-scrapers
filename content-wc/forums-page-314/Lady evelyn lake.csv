2860369,rsiminski,2014-06-03 06:01:00,53,"Just returned from my trip to Lady E. and Garden Island Lodge. The trip was fantastic. My largest walleye was 30"" and had 2 26"", 27"" 28"" and a 34"" pike. The numbers were very impressive for the 8 guys in camp. There were 22 walleyes caught over 25"". and countless numbers of fish caught the week. Fished the gut and Franks Falls and did well on the numbers. But we really got into the huge fish at the gravel pit, whippers, basacar bay and sugar creek. It seems that Island 10 guest only fish the gut and Franks Falls so the other hot spots were open to fish with no other boats. I cant say enough of the Garden Island staff and accomidations. I would not hesitate to book a trip with Joe at Garden Island you wont be dissapointed."
2860393,mleedy77,2014-06-03 06:13:00,8,Thanks for the update. We are in full scale planning and really looking forward to the trip. I'll make sure to try some of the spots you mentioned for big fish.

3019234,mleedy77,2014-07-22 07:18:00,8,"Stayed at Island 10 from July 5 -12 2014. Lodging, meals, and service were great. Fishing was a little slow with mostly small and slot size walleyes. Some smallmouth but mostly in the 12 to 14 inch range. One of the guys in the group did get a 17.5 inch and an 18.5 inch small mouth. Only a few pike and they were in the 24 to 28 inch range. Fishing definitely improved the last two days as the weather also greatly improved those days."

It is a well run camp but this year we tried a fly-in. It was great for about the same price and driving time. Here's one of the fish the lady gave me."
2479081,pawalleyehunter,2014-02-23 10:21:00,2,Heading to lady evelyn lake on june 7-14 anyone been there lately. Hows the fishing STAYING AT ELLEN ISLAND CAMP
2482473,micropterus,2014-02-24 08:18:00,450,"Beautiful country. This is my 50th year going to Lady E. I prefer the ""other end"" thru the big narrows. C&R has improved the both size an count. If you see a white Center Console thats me. Staying at GardenIsland Be sure to plan a trip to Franks Falls."
2483665,doubleheader,2014-02-24 13:42:00,2652,"I stayed at Ellen Island a couple years back. The hosts are really great and the camps are new. That time of year I'd head to the other end of the lake. It's not too far, but then again you may find a nice bite close by.One thing we learned is that there is a lot of debris (wood) on the lake bottom, especially near Ellen Island, so in some spots it might pay to use a heavy enough line to avoid constant break- offs. Lady lake Evelyn may be the best walleye lake in eastern Ontario."
2488433,Guest,2014-02-25 15:43:00,0,"Lady Evelyn certainly is a beautiful area. My buddies and I have gone three years in a row to Island Ten, a full American plan lodge. I can't say enough about the great service you get at this lodge, and the overall experience is absolutely positive. I've been fortunate to be a relative newcomer to the Lady, having caught walleye in the 24 to 28 inch slot all three years. Thus, I believe that the catch and release emphasis is working toward an individual catching a trophy in this lake. Numbers of good walleye have come on certain days when the wind was a great factor along with wet weather at times. Those days were on a par with any walleye fishing our group has ever had. That being said, we have not experienced consistent 50 plus days of walleye catch rates without finding the wind influenced conditions. This year will be different as we will do a fly-in that in which I have great expectations. In the Ellen Island area, American point is a very productive area at times, as is the close by hole in the wall area. Red Pine Lodge was closed the last time we were there and if it is still closed, the pressure on these areas will be diminished. My preference would be beyond the narrows in the areas that lead to Franks Falls, and heavily influenced by a strong wind blowing into the area fished. Trolling a hot'n'tot in 12 to 15 has been magic for me. Good luck."
2507058,Nanuk,2014-03-02 10:19:00,6,"Fished Lady Evelyn and stayed at Ellen Island, great spot, great hosts and awesome accommodations. Lots of places to fish, and now that Red Pine Lodge is closed this part of the lake is very quiet and a lot less fishing pressure. Had some great fishing still fishing with jigs and worms, trolling with Mepps and worm and drift fishing worked well too. Lots of lake to fish but you don't have to go very far to get the fish."
2812393,mleedy77,2014-05-19 13:20:00,8,I'm going to Lady Evelyn Lake from 5 July to 12 July 2014. My first trip to this lake. Staying at Island 10 Lodge. Usually take a fly in trip but decided to go the easy route this year. Hoping it matches up to my last trip (Kayeden Lake - out of Nakina). We caught lots of walleyes (mostly 20 to 24 inches) and several nice pike. Would appreciate any feedback on Lady Evelyn. Thank you
2812657,alberta bum,2014-05-19 14:24:00,312,"Nice central location. Head thru the narrows and fish wind blown islands. There. Is one island that will have several float planes docked around it,, hit the surrounding islands, there is also a sunken island near it,, if you can find it is very good spot. Expect average size of fish to be 14-20 inchers. 1/4-3/8 oz jigs and half a worm"
2813569,adempsey,2014-05-19 19:02:00,963,"It's unlikely it will be as good as Kayedon, but you never know. Regardless, it's a good fishery and one of my favorite lakes.You also don't have to travel that far to get into fish. We caught many not far from Island 10. The islands mentioned by Alberta Bum are really good spots though, for both smallmouth and walleye.The one thing I recall from Island 10 is the mosquitoes. Wow, they were bad the one year and those cabins have plenty of holes. After that trip I bought mosquito netting and tend to bring it with me when I can. Although, it's never been that big of an issue so far."
2814353,rsiminski,2014-05-20 05:29:00,53,"I will be heading up to Lady E. and staying at Garden Island lodge on May, 26th. This will also be my first trip to the Lake. I will post a report for you once I get back."
