VERY unpredictable weather patterns then. We have seen temps of 86 degrees down to 42 degrees... BUT, fishing is usually very good and there are very few others around."
3022545,Painter1,2014-07-23 07:32:00,26,"I admire and salute your similarity to one of Jack London's characters. I Wish I could enjoy myself in cold weather but am a bird brain, following the sun south when the time comes."
3027417,reconssd,2014-07-24 14:05:00,147,"A big thank your for all of your responses. I figured deer hunting would be in full swing in October. Hopefully we don't have to dodge bullets out on the lake. Like any successful trip, weather is key. If we hit it just right, weather won't be an issue. Either way, it's better than being at work. Thanks again."
3011329,reconssd,2014-07-19 08:22:00,147,"I had a colleague ask me about fishing Canada in October. In all the posts I've read on this site, I can't remember anything about October fishing. That being said, have any one you done it and how successful were you? September is wind down time as the lakes are getting ready to turn over. I have to believe lodges are winterizing and closing down too. The latest I've ever fished Canada is mid August. Any experiences or advice you can share with me is greatly appreciated. Two guys on this trip have never fished Canada. My third guy hasn't been to Canada in over 20 years. If possible, I'd like it to be a memorable trip for everyone. The reason why we are looking at October is because of work schedules. Thanks in advance for your input."
3011937,Ron engesether,2014-07-19 14:25:00,46,It's the best month for fishing
3012113,walleyeduran,2014-07-19 16:13:00,286,"October can be the best fishing for large walleye's putting on the feed sack. Just make sure you have good insulated gor-tex rain gear, the weather can change from nice to miserable in a hurry. Good luck, that is my favorite time of year up there."
3012833,thunderatwork,2014-07-19 21:13:00,79,"I've been in nw ontario a few times in mid sept. At that time its about as cold as i would like. Frost on the boats every morning, cold cabins, cold fingers, and good fishing. the cabins we were in were not really made for much colder weather. the water systems were not able to handle below freezing. I respect anyone who would try to give it a go in october-and call it a vacation."
3012937,BenBeattie,2014-07-19 21:49:00,232,The only thing I fish for in Oct/Nov is muskies. Best time for the chance at a true giant.
3013313,brochet,2014-07-20 06:51:00,88,"it depends how far north .I fish 11hrs north of thousand islands first week in oct and the weather can be fine one day and cold the next.snow showers are possible. when cold fronts come through ,the fish get lockjaw,on the nice days I had some of the best fishing I ever had."
3020306,Larbo,2014-07-22 11:22:00,231,I have had some of my best and worst days fishing LOTW's. Best as in SIZE and numbers. Worst was because of weather. If you can handle cold windy weather with white caps on cold front days it can be done. Then the weather breaks and the fish feeding freenzy is on...I also watch the weather and try to time my trip so that I'm fishing just as a cold front blew threw.
3021442,Painter1,2014-07-22 17:57:00,26,I did a trip once in the 3rd week of September to NW Ontario. There was a reason nobody else was at the camp. Never again.
3021578,eyemike,2014-07-22 19:04:00,233,"I have done the Boundary Waters in October. It brings a smile to my face every time I think of that trip. Every morning the fog was set in on the lake and the wolves were howling from the lake shore. That is how to drink a cup of coffee! We did not see another human being the whole week that we were there. Plan well and plan for it being cold then go make some memories. I heard a saying once, I think by the great Al Lindner, that the best time to go fishing is when you can."
3021834,timvigen,2014-07-22 20:06:00,42,"A lot has changed in Ontario in the last few years,not as far as the weather or the fishing,fishing is normaly good but because of the great deer hunting a lot of the resorts have winterized their cabins,if you find a resort that caters to deer hunters the cabin and water issues shouldn't be a problem,I know Paradise cove in Minaki has winterized cabins and the fishing is good.I think deer season opens maybe the first part of October"
