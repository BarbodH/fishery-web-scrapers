3021242,Zola,2014-07-22 16:51:00,14,I have a business trip that may take me to Saskatoon. I would like to take in a 3 or 4 day guided American plan fishing trip/lodge with my wife while I am in Canada. Great experience and great fishing at a reasonable price. Looking for ideas????

It's about as good as it gets as far as fishing, accomodations and yes, price.(it's expensive)However I happen to know that he has some slots to fill in August of this year if that's your timeline and will do so at a pretty good discount.You can check out the lodge here:http://scottlakelodge.com/If you're interested shoot me a pm and I'll give you his personal email.Cheers"

AS of the last time I was there, great fishing, great food and great people... 8 hours out of Saskatoon (with the last three on gravel).http://www.davinlakelodge.com/"

Two old boys from Denver have fished there every year for the past 30 and say the fishing is better now than 30 years ago. Few places can say that. The last part of the drive is gravel but is well maintained by the mining companies. Send Diana an email at [email protected] I'm sure she can fit you in."
