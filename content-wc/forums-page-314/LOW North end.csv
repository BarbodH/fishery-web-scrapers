3019410,deadhead1,2014-07-22 07:58:00,193,This has been a weird year for walleye in my opinion. They seem to bite in one area one day and then a few days later they are totally different area and bite. Last time out we did well on night crawlers on bottom bouncers with spinners. It didn't even have to be much of a worm for size to have them bite. even 1/4 of one worm was enough. We didn't try rubber worms but I expect they would work too. Jigging with leeches didn't seem to work. Didn't try minnows.I still can't find them on mid lake humps--they still seem to be off mainland or island flats and points. Any depth from 18 to 40 feet.Water is still high but lower than highest level and we had from 1 to 2 inch of rain last night.

I assume it must have to do with high water/muddier water? I guess we will just have to burn some fuel until we locate the bite each day. Turn the faucets off up there, you've had enough rain for the next 2 years ."
3020034,Flip Silverlake,2014-07-22 10:12:00,645,The lake has not been as high as it is in over 50 years. They keep claiming that it's about to crest but it keeps raising. Got 2 inches of rain last night so would suspect that it will come up another 4 inches. They have been closing launches without warning. The one in Kenora at the Safeway store is still in operation but with this latest rain that could change. The Walleye bite is goofy to say the least. Lots of big fish and a boat load of dinks not on their normal pattern at all. Not many 16's or 17's this year. I have an idea why that is happening but that's for another day.
