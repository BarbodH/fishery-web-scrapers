Water temperature was in the mid to upper 60's. Water seems 3 feet plus higher than normal. Fishing was good, however, the fish seemed scattered in bays, on points and humps, and once you got into them, the bite did not last very long but was good for some fast action. Not much sign of mayflies, but there were some. Best success on the fish we caught was in 18-23 FOW using a jig and minnow. Two couples fishing for 5 days, and we caught lots of fish. 28"" biggest, then a 26, 25, 24, and some 23's and 22's along with many nice slot fish. Biggest northern caught jigging for walleyes was 36. A very fun filled July trip. Can't wait for next year."

We would get into a bunch of fish, and be marking quite a few. The first several passes we would get quite a few fish, then it seemed like we really had to work for them. So it seemed like the first few passes, you'd get the active fish, then the remaining were more neutral/negative and tougher to get to bite. Coldest surface temp I found was about 61 degrees, and warmest was about 67 or 68. We started seeing quite a few mayflies on the water our last day there, the 19th. We found them scattered over quite a few areas also. Shallow, deep, points, steep drops, etc. We used cralwer harnesses, and other boat used jigs. Seemed like after we passed through a few times and got the active fish, then we slowed down and were able to get more fish at a slower pace."
