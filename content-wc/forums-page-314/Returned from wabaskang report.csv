It was cold & rainy the first few days & then everything turned smooth as glass(except the fishing). We had our best Walleye fishing in McLeod & Keynote. It didn't really matter if you was using minnows or crawlers as they both worked. The southwest corner of the big island up in McLeod was a good producer early in the day. The fish are not in the regular places that we have found them in previous years. they seemed to want a very slow presentation of the jig, just hopping it back seemed to work the best.Be careful coming & going as the police are working 105 very hard around Ear Falls! We saw numerous vehicles being stopped. Later, Jay"
