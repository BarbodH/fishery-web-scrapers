3019770,Aspencreek,2014-07-22 09:21:00,2911,"Now that's funny!!!! I got a ticket for doing 57MPH on 502 about 10 miles north of the 11-502 intersection, gladly paid my ticket. BTW I'm still waiting for all the thank you notes from the rest of the parade going south on that Friday morning about 4 years ago.I promise....unless I'm following a log truck, or a Semi, or anything else with a Canadian plate."
3019946,tv4fish,2014-07-22 09:56:00,2694,"What's ALSO funny about that statement m--- IF you WERE only going that speed on 502 - you would have a caravan behind you for miles, AND the vehicle right behind you would be about 3 feet back.................."
3019954,dkrusin,2014-07-22 09:58:00,97,Just mess'n with ya Thumper50. The last few years 502 has been in great shape and we'll safely run it about 60 to 65 pulling boats. Ontarios secondary roads starting with 5 all seem to be 80 KM even one's not paved. Seems crazy. We have 20 miles going into camp that we don't (can't) exceed 10 mph.I admit I have broken the law and like Aspen will gladly pay the fine. I even have a couple of Kokanees at shorelunch...and once or twice told the border agent my 1.75 liter bottle was only 1 liter..
3020010,Ferg85,2014-07-22 10:11:00,35,"502 after dark is a Safari. Pretty scary. Those raccoons they call Moose leave big dents. I came up on 2 younger ones that not only crossed into the road, but proceeded to run down the road in front of me, turned, wiped out, and luckily my trailer tired just clipped his foot. He got back up and took off think goodness."
3020946,Aspencreek,2014-07-22 14:54:00,2911,"I never have driven it during the dark, and never plan too!! When we take up newbies the looks on their faces when we tell them to ""go"" now because there are no facilities for the next 100 miles except for the occasional log check or gravel road into the bush, is priceless. Add the fact that squatting behind a bush with 100,000 blood sucking insects makes you want to ignore all warnings from your colon. That last cup of coffee will do it everytime."
3021042,dkrusin,2014-07-22 15:25:00,97,"I drove 502 at night one time and I would not recommend it. It is definitely a 80 KM (or less) speed limit. Another couple of dandies are 516 and 599 to Pickle Lake, I do not miss that drive. Seen more OPP and MNR up there then I do around Dryden/Ignace area."
3021706,Nimstug,2014-07-22 19:38:00,2605,I read something to the effect the laws of a forerign county aren't made to make U.S. visitors comfortable; they are there to make their citizens comfortable.
3021850,Yaba,2014-07-22 20:08:00,88,"Try driving 502 in the dark at minus30 on glare ice, blowing snow when it doesnt get plowed and you got a transport coming at you in the opposite direction. Then ya got yerself a pucker factor!"
3022265,Whopper,2014-07-23 05:28:00,340,"My first trip to the Red Lake area my navigator had me turn the wrong way coming out of Fort Francis ended up going up 71 after dark, too many near misses with moose and decided not to go any further than Kenora. The next morning wasn't on the road for five minutes and got a ticket coming out of Kenora for 5 miles over the speed limit, I paid. I've traveled the 502, 71, 105 and further east the 527 after dark and hope I never have to do any of them again at night if at all possible."
3022305,BornToFish,2014-07-23 05:48:00,1224,"A friend put traveling in NW Ontario into perspective for me when I first started traveling to Ontario. He said that the OPP had relatively few officers on their force. Then, he said these officers have remarkably few roads to patrol."
3018858,kzoofisher,2014-07-22 03:54:00,5144,"Funny though, they're over all happier than we are, live longer, have lower crime rates, haven't bankrupted the next generation and the fishing is really good. They must be doing something right. Oh yeah, almost forgot. 200 years ago we started a war with them and they whooped our butts, if not for Napoleon kicking up his heels in Europe our northern states might all be a little different, eh? Perhaps best to let sleeping dogs lie."
3018946,Wawajake,2014-07-22 05:31:00,413,"Thanks Kzoofisher for your big picture approach and common sense..............as for Bellegubb, us Canadian citizens prefer not to have boating or car accidents with drunk drivers, so we continue to vote in ""peace order and good government""."
3019082,v-bay gord,2014-07-22 06:25:00,3168,"Growing a ""pair"" is fine when you only think with your small head.....we prefer to use the one on our shoulders......but thank you for your concern."
3019210,Yaba,2014-07-22 07:15:00,88,"Ive seen the OPP boat leaving the yard and being towed down the road a few times lately. Seems like it just sat for a few years and now they are getting it on the water again! Ive also seen a couple MNR "" scientific research"" boats around lately as well that Ive never seen before."
3019450,Aspencreek,2014-07-22 08:03:00,2911,"bellegrub....you sound just like the guy that we kicked out of our group. It was all about him and what he wanted. ""Rules be ****ed, I think it should be my way!!! And because I'm the smartest guy in the group with the biggest voice I'm going to get my way. Well his week with us lasted until Wednesday when we sent him home. (Yup, packed all his stuff Tuesday night in his truck, while he was passed out in a beer induced coma, woke up the next morning to a note telling him to vacate, while the rest of us were out fishing)As an American we are guests in Canada, you abide by the rules of the land, what we think of them and your feelings about them are of no concern. You have a choice however...abide by the rules or don't choose to participate by never crossing the border. But to try and backhandedly insult your hosts... well, it's difficult to bully on a discussion board, and you come off looking ""the fool""."
3019538,Thumpr50,2014-07-22 08:23:00,139,"Was on both bodies of water last week (Eagle Thur-Fri-Sat and Lac Seul Sunday) and did not see them on either lake. Have no worries if I do run into them; we stay well under the slot and within possession limits, keep nothing over the slot. The boat is the place for fishing and the cabin is the place for cocktails after fishing. We don't intermingle the two. Fishing and being on the wonderful waters of Ontario is a privilege and we try to treat it as such. It is their country; I don't believe I am expected to like or agree with all of their laws. I do believe I am expected to abide by them. Just my two cents worth."
3019610,bigtimeelectric,2014-07-22 08:38:00,174,"Aspen thats right on... Also, I like how you handled that guy in your group it sucks when 1 bad attitude can where on everybodys trip, better to just get rid of him!!!! congratsAs for bellegrub I am really surprised he is registered usually comments like that are made by guests to this sight!!! 31 days to go for my trip to lac seul!!!!!!!"
3019674,Aspencreek,2014-07-22 09:02:00,2911,"It really was a decision made by the group as a whole, we all made up the difference with the camp owner, and left me fishing by myself for the last 2 days. He was also a guy we went to South Dakota pheasant hunting with, and was surprised when he was not included in those trips! The days I fished by myself were actually some of the best on LS. Have a great trip!"
3019690,dkrusin,2014-07-22 09:05:00,97,QUOTE..It is their country; I don't believe I am expected to like or agree with all of their laws. I do believe I am expected to abide by them.Now don't let me catch you going over 49.71 MPH on 502.
3019754,Thumpr50,2014-07-22 09:20:00,139,Not professing to be a saint and not saying I have NEVER exceeded a posted speed limit; pulling a boat up HWY 502 spooks me a bit so i watch it pretty close!
3016898,Glenman12,2014-07-21 11:03:00,762,"Im sure there are others but this past June marked my 33rd trip to Canada and the only time we have ever been checked was on the very first trip in 1981..and it was on a one day fly out, not on the main lake we fish..since then we havent even seen an MNR/OPP boat out on the lake..well I probably just jinxed us for next year.."
3016914,tv4fish,2014-07-21 11:16:00,2694,You KNOW that is true..............
3017066,PRO-V1,2014-07-21 12:08:00,142,"Usually if it's just the OPP boat the boys are on a blitz and are usually looking to tag people. Most of the time the boys will work together, this helps in cost savings, and laying the proper charges. Co's will look for wildlife infractions and the OPP will look after their department, this way there is no grey area. this is also true during the hunting, ice fishing season. one looking for wildlife the other looking for helmets, insurance, registration, steering papers,.......again no grey area. A boat is considered a motorized vehicle having a cooler of beer in the boat would be like having a cooler in the front seat of your pick-up. Some of the regs depend on you, if your up north and you have a few beer in the cooler, the bottom is not littered in cans and aren't lip-standing drunk, show the boys a some respect they may tell you to play safe and be on there way"
3017466,SinOrSwim,2014-07-21 14:08:00,1528,"I'm assuming having a cooler on your front seat in a car is not illegal?????Personally, I think it's a silly rule. But, it's their right to make their own rules. Driving a boat intoxicated is a completely different story than enjoying a few beers at shore lunch or a few while you relax and fish."
3017834,Aspencreek,2014-07-21 16:36:00,2911,"Silly..maybe, but it is the rules. Had a guy in our group a few years back that insisted he was going to take a 12'er with him when he fished LS. ""HE will never get stopped and could talk his way out of it anyway"" you can guess the rest of the story. A large fine!! We never take beer with us, and his days of coming along with us ended that week, as soon as you think it won't happen it will."
3017850,SinOrSwim,2014-07-21 16:48:00,1528,"Agreed. I might think it's silly but the rules they make are the rules. Not for me to decide. We used to take beer in the boat on our fly-ins. Quite honestly, we didnt' know the rules but when we moved to Lac Seul, we don't take any. At least not in the boat I drive. Not worth the risk."
3017994,Aspencreek,2014-07-21 17:53:00,2911,"Not in mine either.....I know, hard to believe!! Now back at the dock, KOKANEE's all around!!"
3018130,Poolmick,2014-07-21 18:37:00,5,what about in a house boat? Does that count as a residence?
3018202,PRO-V1,2014-07-21 18:57:00,142,"As long as you are anchored, or tied off at the dock and have a bathroom on board, permanent sleeping and cooking areas.Mike"
3018642,bellegubb,2014-07-21 21:00:00,5,"The Canadian government is a fine example of bureaucracy run amok. The socialist government is always protecting the people from themselves and the Canadian citizens willingly fall in line without questions. A government should protect its citizens without unreasonably interfering upon their personal freedoms. I am not opposed to rules against boating while intoxicated. You should not operate a boat when drunk. Nevertheless, not allowing beer in a boat is ridiculous. People should have the right to enjoy a drink while fishing or boating. If the operator drinks too much, he should be penalized. The law is simply too restrictive. The law should allow alcohol but prohibit intoxicated operators. I wish Canadian citizens would grow a pair. What do you expect from a nation whose motto is ""Peace, Order and Good Government""? I prefer ""Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness""."
3012017,Northern Pike,2014-07-19 15:22:00,1,I've heard from a few locals that the OPP have been seen out on Lac Seul and Eagle Lake. Has anyone been stopped and what are they looking for?
3012233,Pikeslayer8,2014-07-19 17:10:00,1460,An OPP plane dropped in on us at Wabakimi the first week of June on their joint effort with the MNR. They placed a buoy in the deepest part of the lake with temperature sensors every 8 ft. to the bottom. Strictly a scientific study that I'm sure we will not be privy to.
3012513,Fish_Heads,2014-07-19 19:04:00,154,They're looking for $$$$$$$$$$$$Screw up & they'll get some of yours !
3013401,Fishingfinn,2014-07-20 07:31:00,30,"My brother is an OPP officer in Dryden, you may be seeing him on the water. I myself have been checked several times in the area. They check to make sure there is no alcohol on board. They also check for valid fishing licences, up to date life jackets, complete marine safety kits, and any other required boating safety gear. They also check for a mandatory marine operators card, but I'm not sure if that applies to Americans. Oh yeah they can check your fish and limits, too. Pretty much same authority as MNR officers."
3013441,tv4fish,2014-07-20 07:47:00,2694,"Finn: Do you know what their position is on ""one beer for shore lunch""? We've heard that most MNR or OPP officers will still allow that - true or not?"
3013529,SinOrSwim,2014-07-20 08:18:00,1528,"In addition to this, what is the penalty if you do get caught with beer in the boat?"
3013617,fergiefish,2014-07-20 08:38:00,197,"We were told one time by OPP that you could transport your cooler to shore with the beer, but it could not be on the boat while fishing. The cost is approximately $100.00 per beer based on the fear factor provided by OPP; do not know if that is accurate."
3014577,ftfarms,2014-07-20 14:01:00,444,We had beer in the boat a few years back and the MNR officer told us it was $50 a beer full or empty at that time. He was cool and told us that it belongs at camp and none was to be in the boat. Shore lunch or not NONE in the boat.
3016546,Mike Kansas,2014-07-21 09:22:00,1463,I have been told that you may transfer alcohol by boat to a outpost camp but you may not under any circumsatnce have alcohol in the boat while fishing. I have heard that penaltys range from fines to lost fishing privileges. I only know of one case that a fine was issued and it was $200 for three beers in boat. Mike Kansas
3016762,Guest,2014-07-21 10:21:00,0,"A warden in the Kenora area informed us politely that alcohol was a no-no unless at your residence. The residence could be a cabin, resort, tent, etc..... but shore lunch was not an acceptable place. ""Public Drinking"" was what he referred to as being illegal. He in formed us that even though we probably would not have a problem at our camping area, technically, we were in violation of the letter of law if we sat around our campfire and had beer. He left us with a friendly verbal warning that the handful of beers in our cooler would be better off unopened after we were done with our lunch. We obliged, and wouldn't you know it, after we had lunch, he pulled us over again and asked if we still had the beer. We did and he thanked us. It would have been in the neighborhood of $500 out of our pockets if we would have happened to have empties after lunch according to him. That was the last time I took beer in the boat in Ontario. From my experience, the OPP is a lot less willing to explain and give you a break."
