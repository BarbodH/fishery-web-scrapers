3029361,tv4fish,2014-07-25 08:25:00,2694,"??? Unless they moved in the last few weeks -- I believe it's on the EAST side of Dryden. (Also - you may want to do a ""review"" of that one - not good comments........)"
3029601,Yaba,2014-07-25 09:37:00,88,The Patricia Inn is on the east side of across from Rotten Ronnies by the lights. On the west side of town is the Trans Canada Restaurant... Both have similiar menus...they are both not bad to eat in most days.Tim Hortons is on the very east side of town across from Wally World.
3030481,Skyraptor,2014-07-25 15:07:00,291,What about the Riverview Lodge?
3030753,Blue Lk,2014-07-25 17:07:00,269,"+1,very good food.Wild rice soup & bacon poutine"
3030769,v-bay gord,2014-07-25 17:10:00,3168,"They also have a ""shack"" set up at Bobby's in VBay.....might be an option for you."

3028577,rather-be-fishin,2014-07-24 21:52:00,429,Heading up 502 to Dryden then to Vermilion Bay on Saturday 7/26. Looking for a good place to eat lunch in Dryden or heading West on 17 towards Vermilion Bay? Thanks in advance! RBF
3028793,F250,2014-07-25 04:18:00,75,"You can't go wrong with a breakfast or lunch stop at Tim Horton's. Always clean, always good service. Their soup and sandwich combos are excellent. If that chain came to the USA, Dunkin Donuts would be closing their doors !"
3028833,clearis,2014-07-25 05:03:00,47,I was thinking Tim Horton' as well. It's on the the west side of town.
3028841,wallydave,2014-07-25 05:10:00,2151,If you can wait stop at Busters in V Bay for barb b q!
3028881,port1042,2014-07-25 05:54:00,509,"If your heading north from Vermilon Bay toward Perrault Falls/Red Lake, try Whiskey Jack's just south of Perrault Falls (about 25 miles north of Vermilon Bay) on 105. Extremely good homemade french fries, a decent burger, good homemade pizza -- and a cold beer."
3028897,Yaba,2014-07-25 05:58:00,88,If your looking for a real good sit down type of meal in Dryden go to Masala....east indian food buffett with salad bar for $11.99.... When you come up 502 and get to the first set of lights by the mill just go straight and its just before the 3rd set of lights before the bridge beside the car wash.If you get to Vbay Busters is a good bet and there is also the Bakery in Vbay as well.Enjoy!
3029025,Yaba,2014-07-25 06:47:00,88,"KOKOMs Bannock Shack is another good sit down lunch spot in Dryden, all hand made regular restaurant type of food but in place of breads they serve fresh bannock...very good."
3029073,deadhead1,2014-07-25 07:05:00,193,"I don't know the name of it but there is a hotel on the east end, north side of the road. It looks a bit scary but food is very good. It is always busy with locals."
3029097,skindzier,2014-07-25 07:19:00,137,I'll second Buster's in VBay - great food!
