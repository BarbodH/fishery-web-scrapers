3018594,Mikeo2,2014-07-21 20:47:00,27,I'm currently working in winnipeg and get 6 days off at a time. I'm looking for suggestions for good walleye and lake trout lakes within a 6 or 7 hour drive from the Peg.
3018722,zeebee,2014-07-21 21:40:00,1144,"Lots of good options, LOTW.....Sioux Narrows area has provided me with good laker/walleye fishing. If you can spare the coin, Trout Lake is a short 20 min fly in out of Red Lake (5 1/2 hr drive) and is a true world class fishery. Trophy Lakers and northern and, walleye off every point. Contact Cat Island Lodge.A closer option would be Ash Rapids Camp, a boat in lodge that caters to individual fisherman for a reasonable cost. A great walleye, Northern, Bass and muskie spot, Somelakers in the vicinity too.Feel free to PM me and run some ideas by as Im familiar with the region."
3020738,Carnhzkr,2014-07-22 13:37:00,964,"No lakers, but Manigotagan is about 4 hours north and is a tremendous walleye and smallmouth fishery. Check Qlakelodge.com. Q Lake is for Quesnel Lake, which is connected to Manigotagan. The lodge is in a provincial park, so there is an option for camping if you're not into staying at a lodge."

3021690,bassnblast,2014-07-22 19:31:00,56,"Eagle Nest Lodge on the Winnipeg River -- only took us 1.5 hours to drive to the landing from the Winnipeg Airport, then a 40 minute boat ride. Makes you feel like you're at a fly-in lodge. Great bass, walleye and pike.http://www.eaglenest.ca/ Tons of options on LOTW and you can also make it to Lac Seul in about 4.5 hours."
