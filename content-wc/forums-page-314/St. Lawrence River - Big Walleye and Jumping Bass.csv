3001610,MrSimon,2014-07-16 08:36:00,922,"I have a cottage on Black Lake, NY. Black Lake has great fishing, but I wanted to catch some walleye on the River. Its only 7 minutes from the cottage. I ended up catching my personal best eye, a fat 29"". I also caught a handful of 22-24s and a handful of 15-17s. The eyes on this river are getting BIG eating those gobies. Here is a short video of some of the fish I caught. Check out the crazy jumping smallies!!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW79f3-xANk"

Also did fish black lake for walleyes back in the late 50's with my dad. Now I have a camp close to Oswego ny and this time of the year do get into some nice smallies. By chance can you give me some info on where you launched and fished the river. thanks for the help."

3016258,MrSimon,2014-07-21 08:16:00,922,"You can launch your boat anywhere in the river and find good structure. Honestly, just pick a spot that is convenient for you and start looking for shoals close to deep water. You absolutely MUST have a good GPS unit with a full contour chart. First, to find the structure and second, to know where the prop-eating rock areas are. Its a dangerous place to be if you are driving blind."
