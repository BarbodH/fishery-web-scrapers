3022857,Ferrispata,2014-07-23 08:59:00,63,Does anyone have any experience with this outfitter? Domaine Vanier is another name associated with this. Looks like the lake is in Quebec? May be new administration? Thanks in advance. Jerry

3027129,NYBowHunter,2014-07-24 12:14:00,35,Air Melancon is absolutely a top notch operation - you won't go wrong flying with them! It's a shame they sold their cabins on Gouin though.

I have been flying into lac Hebert for 11 yrs. I have fished La Croix, in the past It is a good lake But I would not Recommend the outfitter. I have never heard very positive things about LaCroix .As far as I'm concerned Air Tamarac is the best outfitter In Quebec.Most of the lakes south of the gouin have been heavily over fished, because of there easy access. A 50 min. float plane ride from Clova, will put you in Walleye heaven."
3028105,Ferrispata,2014-07-24 18:08:00,63,"Hi Ron, Just got back from Lac Hebert and thoroughly enjoyed it. Air Tamarac is a class act for sure. Just wanted to get info on some other options out there. Unfortunately it will be 3 years probably before we are able to get up north again. So plenty of time to do more research. Jerry"
