I think the important thing is to be alert for the symptons and then promptly go to a vet who is experienced with it or who is at least willing to be educated about it. You may even wish to travel back with the dog for treatment if necessary, as the vets where you are in Canada may be more experienced than your local vet. But the odds of it ever being a problem are low."

Looks like he will be making the trip! He was pretty much the only reason I was willing to head home, now I don't know if ill ever leave lol."

3020322,gloomiseye31,2014-07-22 11:25:00,387,"Thanks, there should be a vet about 60 miles away. Of course that's about 2 hours on the back roads"
3021490,Nick D.,2014-07-22 18:19:00,88,"Make sure you keep any food or treats in the original bags. We were coming back from Saskatchewan a couple years ago and got lectured by a US border agent because the food was in a canvas dry bag instead of the original bag. The agent said the dog food was considered ""meat products""."

3017266,gloomiseye31,2014-07-21 13:01:00,387,"Heading to Canada this week and having a hard time finding a place to leave the dog at, so I was wondering how taking a dog into Canada would work. Has anybody taken their dog on a Canadian fishing trip before? I'm not worried about him being in the boat as he's great in there, more concerned with getting him across the border. I know you have to have official rabies vaccinations, but I'm missing anything else? Any help would be appreciated."
3017322,BenM,2014-07-21 13:16:00,9,Your vet will need to give you a certificate of health as well as proof of vaccinations. I always had the forms ready but was never even asked for them by a border agent. More often than not the border agent would give my lab a treat. No big deal at
3017338,LOW1,2014-07-21 13:19:00,2828,"We do it all the time. I swear the dogs know when were are leaving. The regs say you need a current (within 30 days) rabies certification. We always carry it but have never been asked for it by the border folks. On return we have had a US officer give the beasts dog biscuits. I think you will find the border crossing very dog friendly. Do keep in mind the risk of a blasto infection and let your vet know as soon as possible if the dog appears sickly upon your return. It's not common, but it does occur in some areas."
3017370,gloomiseye31,2014-07-21 13:24:00,387,Thanks a bunch guys!
3017618,BenM,2014-07-21 14:51:00,9,Wow can't believe I forgot about blastomycosis. My lab was diagnosed about a year and a half after being up in Canada and northern Wisconsin (both places are blasto hotbeds). Horrible fungal infection for sure. Had to put my lab down. Just one of those things though. We made some great memories up there. Bring your dog and have fun.
3017746,gloomiseye31,2014-07-21 15:50:00,387,Hmm that is a bit concerning especially after researching it a bit and seeing it has been pretty much in the area that we are going to be in.
3017898,BenM,2014-07-21 17:12:00,9,It had been a year and a half since Canada when my dog got blasto however only about 6 mos since northern Wisconsin when diagnosed so it is more than likely he picked it up in WI. The vet thought 18 months was a long time to lay dormant but 6 months was more realistic. Someday I'll have another dog and I won't think twice about taking him fishing. Both camp dogs up there never had blasto issues.
3017946,gloomiseye31,2014-07-21 17:35:00,387,Are there any kind of precautions I could take to help prevent him from getting this? Perhaps just limiting him to the grass areas?
3018162,BenM,2014-07-21 18:43:00,9,"From what I understand hunting dogs are more prone to blasto due to their noses constantly being on the ground smelling everything. Wooded and moist areas seem to harbor the spore that causes it. So I would definitely keep your dog out of the ""bush"" as much as possible. The likelihood of your dog contracting is probably rare. I sure don't want to unnecessarily freak you out."
3018242,gloomiseye31,2014-07-21 18:59:00,387,"Haha no problem, I appreciate the heads up. Definitely going to prevent him from going into areas where they say its most prone to be at"
