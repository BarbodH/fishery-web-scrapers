541770,Guest,2004-07-18 08:59:00,0,"We've been fishing in Ontario for many years with good results on walleye, bass and pike. We would like to add lake trout to the list but been having problems locating and catching. We go up in August and have tried fishing drops that go from about 40 all the way to 100 with numerous jigging baits... 1oz jigs, spoons ect. Can anyone offer any help to a fellow angler in need?"
541772,Trailerguy,2004-07-18 09:26:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I've been chasing trout as well. We did real well in April through the ice. I had some sucess with the downrigger a couple weeks ago. Water temperature is key to sucess, they like 48-52*, which was 60+ feet. Then you need to find the fish in that depth of water, deep baitfish, and structure."
541806,fishingfool2u2,2004-07-19 14:37:00,4,"Use a 3 way rig,only super size the weight. I use a 3 way rig with about a 3' drop line with an 8 ounce or larger weight,about 6 feet of line to the lure,I put swivels on both the weight and lure. I like trolling spoons,color can make a differance but it is hard to beat silver and blue.You can also try floating Rapalas,daredevils,shad raps etc... Go deep,find the deepest water and let your rig go to the bottom,start trolling fast enogh to make your lures run right and hang on!I would try at least 70 feet,and I would probe the deeep 100' holes too.Make sure you pump your rod once and a while,lake trout will follow your lure long distances. You can also jig for them,go with 1 or 2 oz jigs,put a twister tail on,send it to the bottom and jig it up about 1/2 way up then let the jig back down to the bottom.This is a blast on lighter tackle. That is about all there is to fishing for lake trout,go deep,stay deep and keep enough fopr a meal and let the rest go! I hope I have helped. Good Luck to All,Paul"
541819,Guest,2004-07-20 00:29:00,0,Hi. downriggers are probably the way to go. You really need a fish locator. good luck
541844,fishinnut,2004-07-20 17:06:00,642,8 oz. snapweights have worked well for me. Try silver/blue sutton spoons or blue rapalas.Keep it bouncing near bottom and keep trying different depths until you find them. Low light times are best.
541854,fishingfool2u2,2004-07-20 20:40:00,4,"I have to disagree with the low light times,I have had had my best action on bright sunny,not a cloud in the sky days with no or little wind.I also like to go after them in the evenings,they tend to shut down at sun set.These are my observations,I am sure every lake is different. Good Luck to All,Paul"
541860,Guest,2004-07-21 05:22:00,0,Downriggers are the way to go. We do well with a pair of portables into carry in lakes.
541941,Stu,2004-07-22 21:16:00,472,We have been fishing Wabby for the last few years. We go up in July & Aug. We still fish w/ frozen ciscos on the bottom. Take a needle (you can make on from a hanger). Thread it thru the rectum and out the mouth) and place a treble hook in the mouth. Supposedly lakers grab there prey head first when scavenging on the bottom. It is important to keep them a s frozen as possible. I use a 3/8 or 1/2 oz. dipsey or egg sinker. We caught a couple of small lakers in about 1/2 hour. Even the locals said we couldn't catch them in the summer. Still fishing is kind of boring so we usually do it one our lunch break. I'm sure we could have done very well if we stayed with it. Good luck.
541966,Guest,2004-07-23 15:52:00,0,Thanks to all for the kind advice.... Hopefully we'll have more luck this year.
