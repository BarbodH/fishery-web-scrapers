We bought some shots from Ontario Angler Satellite Site and were blown away. We used them this summer near Armstrong, Ontario. The had incredible detail. We also got the maps that they overlayed on the images...SWEET! We spend less than 100.00 bucks and got 6 things. That is little considering we usually soend 400.oo on minnows. hehe Here is a note, if you do order some stuff, get it printed yourself. We went to kinkos and only paid about 4.00 dollars a piece to get everything printed in black-white. You can even send them in online...lol http://www.kinkos.com I had all the photos printed and they are about each about 4 feet wide! My wall in my office has all my notes of where I got big fish. I think you might be able to get some stuff emailed now, instead of on CD. Check it at http://www.teamd3.net/canada Good Luck! Carl"
