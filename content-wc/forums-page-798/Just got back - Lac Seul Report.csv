541322,Guest,2004-07-03 08:51:00,0,"All Country Camping is, is a camp site right off HWY 664 on your way to Hudson. It is on Big Lake Vermillion (Smallies, Musky and Lake Trout), but is about 4 miles from the Lac Seul launch site. We paid $52 per person (4 guys), for 6 nights camping - water and electricity. They do have cabins, however I am sure it would be about 2 to 3 times more expensive for the same amount of time. They have a fish house and a communal freezer. There is a shower/bathroom house on site also, with hot running water.www.countrycamping.net Not sure about Deerpath, it would have been great to be right on Lac Seul, but a 4 mile launch isn't that bad either. The hospitalities at Country Camping are great. Good luck."

541356,Guest,2004-07-03 09:38:00,0,Wooglin...I think Deerpath is about the same as how you described Country Camping. We will also have that drive to the launch at Hudson. Thanks again for your info and hope the skeeters have been well fed by the time we get there !! Three days !
541358,Guest,2004-07-03 10:49:00,0,"In all honesty, the skeeters weren't too bad. Just be sure to bring some Off with Deet, and maybe some citronella candles - they seem to work well. Just keep it on, they'll stay away - they weren't that thick anyway. Where is Deerpath, is it on HWY 664 also? I did not see any signs for it. Let us know how you do. Thanks!"
541374,Guest,2004-07-03 22:41:00,0,"Yes, Deepath is also on 664. My first time there, so I hope there are signs ! Looks like more rain for next week. I'll report back on this thread."
541381,jimbo,2004-07-04 10:14:00,223,Deer Path is a very nice place-clean and neat. Say Hi to Rick and Evelyn from Me. They will treat you right. Rick knows where to go too. I was there first week of June from Minnesota. I gone there for some years now. Good luck
541384,WIPP,2004-07-04 12:05:00,75,"We just returned from Chamberlain Narrows. Caught plenty of fish, though we had to find some new spots. None real big - biggest were 23 inches or so. Over 100 walleyes per boat per day. A few northerns up to about 10 lbs."
541386,Guest,2004-07-04 19:07:00,0,"My wife and I and another couple just got back from Evergreen lodge on lac Seul. We had a great time and Evergreen is an awesome place to stay. The folks at Evergreen are very friendly and helpful and the camp is very clean. The fishing was good and my wife caught a Hog walleye that was 31 1/2"" long. The four of us caught around 600 Walleye for the week and 25% of them were slot and above."
541390,Riceburner,2004-07-04 21:35:00,436,"Please expound on how far down the lake in general, bait and method preferred, if possible......water level still rising? THX, Riceburner"
542002,Guest,2004-07-25 13:25:00,0,"Tough fishing on LAC SEUL? LOL I just got back and we slayyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeedddddddddddd them. Try going farther North..say, North of Lac Seual Outposts on Chamberlain Narrows. Slaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyed them! Fire damges to the sout is scary scary stuff guys. Hope that does not hurt the fishing. pop"
541291,Guest,2004-07-02 07:14:00,0,"Just got back from the Sioux Lookout area, we spent 5 days on the water, long days, most of them 10-12 hours. Fishing was pretty tough compared to last year, we really had to find them this year. All our spots from last year were no good. We would launch from a launch site about 5 miles east of Hudson on HWY 664. We'd mostly drive the boat to the Bridge area near Websters Bay. We fished everything in between as well. Did pretty well, a 27 1/2 and a 27 incher, 32 and 36 inch northern (biggest one was brought in on the tail end of a 15 inch walleye). The last day we drove the boat up north east to Crooked Rapids, Deception Bay and up to Hole in the Wall bay/lake. We were really slumped there, only taking 6 walleye and no northern. You could see where the fires went through that area last year. Water is up 5-6 feet from last year, and it appears to only be about 1 foot down from regular. Weather was pretty nice, I got a decent tan, mostly in th upper 60's and lower 70's. Rain seems to have stopped, however it was a rainy and cold spring up there, so the fish seem to be about 3 weeks behind. Oh yeah, we had bears in our camp, took out a group from MN's tent, bit into our cooler, then the OPP came and 'shot over his head with a shotgun', and we didn't see him since. I think he shot him, but thats not what he told us. We had two bear traps about 30 feet from our tents. Good luck to you all. Later, Wooglin"

541313,orchard frank,2004-07-02 21:39:00,1900,"On your way to the bridge, the water opens up at Frenchmans Head. Where it narrows down again, look to your right(N)you will see a large white rock on the shore. Try from there to the narrow opening, which has a sandbar extending out into the route to the bridge. There are times the fish are packed along the 14-18' break and onto the sandbar.Over the years we have caught a ton here, northerns too. Check up shallow too. Good Luck"

541315,Guest,2004-07-02 22:28:00,0,"Same as above. Just before you get to the bridge, hang a right into the bay, there is a hole on the East side of the bay, just around the point as you go West to get to the bridge. Fish were in the 15 foot range - nailed them on leeches and just a jig. Last year, we did best on crawlers and harnesses/lindy rigs just after you pass the bridge. This year, they did nothing for us and the places we fished last year were about 5 feet deeper, and no fish. But as I mentioned earlier, I think the more warm weather they get, they'll be biting better. Also, on your way over to the bridge, there is a visible rock pile on your left side (south) - try trolling that in the 25-30 foot depth line with deep divers. We got a few big ones over the slot, and a 32 inch northern. If you see that one, tell her I say hello. She hit so hard, I actually tried to unsnag it until she came to the top of the water and I realized it was a fish..... Best of luck, and try to report back if you can. PS, we camp at Country Camping on HWY 664, where will you be at?"

541316,Guest,2004-07-02 22:58:00,0,I'll be at Deerpath.....first time fishing this end of the lake. Thanks again for the spots from you and Orchard Frank....it's a huge area and it's nice to have some idea of where to start. Could you compare Deerpath with Country Camping ?
