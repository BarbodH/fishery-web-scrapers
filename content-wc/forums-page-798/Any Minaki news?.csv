Is the water still high with a fast current by the RR tressle? Has most the action moved into Big Sand or are the shallower lakes and channels still the best bets? Someone told me to expect fishing conditions to be 2-3 weeks behind what I would normally expect, does that mean the evening troll in Big Sand has not picked up yet and the Mayfly hatch was late too? I'm lookin for any recent reports to give my mind fuel to dream on until we get there next Saturday. Thanks In Advance IaCraig"

We were up the first week of June and water temps were several weeks behind. I am hoping that the mayfly hatch is over and things were going in Big Sand. We fish primarily for walleyes and spend a few evenings for Muskies. We will be staying at Paradise Park. I love this place !!!!"

541906,Guest,2004-07-22 07:21:00,0,I think the lack of responses has more to do with the Minaki lodge going out of business and the lack of staff spewing great fishing stories on this board.... :)
541908,Guest,2004-07-22 07:25:00,0,we were tghere july 5 and the fishin was good.But big sand was not good yet
