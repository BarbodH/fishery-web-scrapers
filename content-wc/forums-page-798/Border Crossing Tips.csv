Before you go on the water they will have your group come to the office where they will go over the fishing and boating regulations. Will also go over their camp rules. They are excellent hosts, don't be afraid to ask questions. We always figure 5 hours or so from Ft. Francis with a stop for a meal. We stop at Vermillion Bay or Dryden. There are some good resturants along the way and the folks are always nice. Just don't act like a big shot, the ""Golden Rule"" works everywhere. As far as shore lunch there are 3-4 very good places. Just ask Bill or Maureen to show you on a lake map. The site north east?(Have had my directions screwed up on that lake for 20 years.) Of the gull rock be careful of a underwater rock close to shore. One of our group lost a lower unit there. Is a great lake to fish and a great place to stay as are all fishing camps there. Good roads, close to Red Lake in case you need anything. If you like to golf Balmertown has a nice course and the green fees are included in your fishing package. Is the most north course in Ontario. Have fun, don't forget the 6p's"

541949,Planocat,2004-07-23 07:50:00,473,"Be informed about limits. For example, unless the law has changed, your 12 yr. old does not need a license to fish. HOWEVER, if you don't purchase a license he is not entitled to retain any fish. Saw this a couple years ago when a fellow from Chicago took his 14 yr old on the ""fishing trip of a lifetime"". Told at the border his son didn't need a license, they were checked and found 4 walleyes and 4 northerns over the limit. Warden would not assign a value to the fish forcing him to return to Canada or hire a representative to appear for him. Last I knew, the estimated cost was approaching $1500 for an honest mistake regarding his 14 yr old son's fish. He said his 2 younger sons would never experience a Canadian trip with him based on the way his was being treated. Be informed of their laws and obey them. The above incident and others I am aware of are proof that some, not all, conservation officers are real jerks who will go out of their way to make your life miserable. Have a great trip..... as I grow older, I long for the days of taking my family on similar trips in past years. They were the best times of my life. Planocat"
541954,Zim1,2004-07-23 12:44:00,17,"Planocat, You were reading my mind about the best of times. My oldest is 16 and that is part of the reason I said we are going this year. ""if not now....when"" We have gone off and on over the years but I did not want to force them to go if they want to stay home by their friends. 2 of my 3 boys said they wanted to go and that ain't bad. I can't afford a fly-in trip so this is the best I can do. I hope I picked a good lake, and good time of the year to take them. We've had a couple busts in the year's past in Minnesota."
541995,Guest,2004-07-25 13:13:00,0,"All I have to say is, BRING A PASSPORT or a birth cert. We have heard of big trouble at the border. FM"
541895,Zim1,2004-07-22 00:29:00,17,"I'll be headed up to Gullrock next Saturday night and will be crossing the border at Fort Frances around maybe 6-7 PM. Have two boys 12 and 16. Can I get some advice with regards to planning? I think I need a driver's license and birth certificate for me and my older son, and maybe just the birth certificate for the youngster. What about transporting food? What about currency, given the late time? I'd like to drive straight up to Gullrock and set up our camper that same night. Figure we'd get in around 11 PM. I was just gonna take cash for the campsite and boat rental. Bringing our own life vests & net, gear. Think of anything else? Thx."
541896,Zim1,2004-07-22 00:32:00,17,"It's been years since I was up there. I read somewhere that fish need to be killed immediately rather than keeping a stringer. Is that correct? So I will need to take a cooler with ice in the boat each day? And it's 4 walleye less than 18"" each (Not keepin big ones)?"
541897,Gary_IA,2004-07-22 05:25:00,144,You should also have a signed and notarized statement from the childrens' mother giving permission for travel to Canada with you to Canada. The note might also state you have authority to make decisions as to health care and hospitalization if necessary. The note should include how to contact her-home and work phone numbers. If the youngest child has a photo id (school?) take it too. You could probably go to the driver's license bureau and get a photo id for him if you want one. My thought is to imagine yourself as the person checking the documents and what would persuade you that everything is on the up and up. Lets hope your trip across the border and back are a breeze. Good fishing!!!
541898,Trailerguy,2004-07-22 05:27:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]You better have a letter from your spouse Ok ing the trip for the younger boy too,at the border. Also a phone # to reach her incase they check. No potatoes, in fact heres a link to read: http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/E/pub/cp/...html#P141_4348 . I'm not sure which Division Gullrock is in but Limits and slots vary all over NWO, with only a few lakes requiring fish be killed. You need to read the regulations for your division and Gullrock."
541903,Guest,2004-07-22 06:34:00,0,"Zim 1, I have made 20+ trips to Gullrock myself and our group (sometimes as many as 15) has never had to show identification of any kind. However, we always are prepared to as I know others have. Maybe we have just been lucky. I would suggest Birth Certificates for each of you and based on what I read on this board, the permission note from your spouse may also be recommended. In regards to currency, most resorts on this lake will only accept payment in US, but will also accept your personal check. No credit cards. However, I would suggest using your credit card whenever possible in Canada. You'll get the fairest exchange rate that way. Most establishments estimate the exchange rate and they will more than likely estimate on the short side. Regarding fishing, you have two options. A regular license, either 7 day or annual, which allows you 4 fish 18"" and under, or a conservation license, which allows you 2 fish 18"" and under. The camp owners at most resorts on this lake will pay for your license if you get a conservation license. You have to decide if those two extra fish are worth $15 - $17 a piece. By the way, you can take home one trophy per license if you intend on mounting it. Finally, you do not have to kill your fish, but sorting is prohibited. I'll be going up the 31st myself. I just received an e-mail from the camp owner and they say it has been very hot and the bugs are terrible at night. Weather can change between now and then, but best to be prepared. Best of luck to you, Pat T"
541904,Matches,2004-07-22 06:50:00,236,"This is just my two cents, but odds are this time of year the mosquitoes are going to thick at night. I've done that before in July. Pulled in and set up at night and then slept with a million mosquitoes in my motor home. Not fun."
541905,Reels,2004-07-22 06:59:00,2876,"This is the first year they were sticky about I.D.'s, Not going in, but coming back to the US. They asked for picture ID from everyone in the car, and my sons birth certificate, as he had no picture ID. <{{}}><"
541915,Zim1,2004-07-22 11:48:00,17,"Thanks people. Sounds like I better get some serious repellant for inside the pop-up camper. Hope the boys don't get bit up too bad. Will have to butter up when setting up that camper. Can anyone tell me how many hours drive from Fort Frances to Gullrock? I know I gotta watch for moose driving late like that. So if we get the conservation license we can keep 2 - 18"" walleye per person per day, plus take 2 apiece home? Will the mosquitos leave us alone long enough for a shore lunch on some island out there? Looking forward to being a good guide and getting the boys into some quality fishing. Thx"
541916,Gary_IA,2004-07-22 13:16:00,144,"I think the posession limit is a day's limit. It is not culmative. If you have 4 walleyes and 4 northerns in the cabin on day 1 and 2 conservation license, you need to eat the fish before bringing more back to the cabin. Your oldest boy might need a license, I'm not sure where the age cutoff is. If he can fish under your license and you are eating fish, think about the ""regular"" 7 day license. Four Walleyes and 4 Northerns should be enough fish for 2 ravenous boys. By the way, I believe a fish caught and eaten at a shore lunch counts toward the daily limit even though it has been consumed. I know this may seem picky but the enforcement officers have binoculars and other fisherman may comment about your luck. I check with the outfitter about slot size and limits. Trying to find and interpret the applicable regulation where one intends to fish can be confusing. It's easier to ask."
541917,Reels,2004-07-22 14:46:00,2876,Cut off age is 16 and his limit will count towards your limit. <{{}}><
