I believe it is in the Lakeville area. Anyone else experienced this? We'll be going through Saturday mid morning. Maybe the weekdays are the worse. Thanks

If you can, avoid at all costs. I have seen cars sitting there, not moving, non-stop for weeks now. Good Luck! Worst times.... 3 - 6 PM MON-FRI SATRUDAYS SUCK TOO, kinda like the VikeQueens and Convict Moss...LOL Just had to get that one in for my man BRETT FAVRE! ;)"
