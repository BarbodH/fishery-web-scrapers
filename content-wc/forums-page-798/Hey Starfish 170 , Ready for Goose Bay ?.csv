541273,Guest,2004-07-01 07:49:00,0,"Have you received any recent fishing reports from the area around Goose Bay camp on Lac Seul. It's only a little over 2 weeks from now.Bait wise , Should we bring our own or is it available at camp ? I was thinking it would be wise to bring some crawlers and leeches and buy the minnows at camp. I'll bring a few ""blue' pops for you and your relatives so we can talk hotspots when I get there."

Both jigging with minnows and pulling worm harnesses worked well. People at camp were catching fish near camp, going southwest from camp. I spent alot of time in Mckenzie bay. The large sand banks were hot, 50-100 fish days could be had there, most came out of 12' of water. Our largest fish was 26"" and that came on a harness. Water levels are good, and the temp seemed to average 63 degrees. Brax"

541684,Guest,2004-07-14 11:41:00,0,"We have had luck in the past in McKensie Bay, but usually only make it out that far once per trip. We have always found the fish in about those depths, usually pulling spinners with leeches or minnows. This year we are going to be bringing some crawlers. Blackjack, what kind of boat will you be fishing out of? I will have the Blue Starcraft starfire 170. Any one else been fishing in the Ear Falls/Lac Seul area????"
541690,Guest,2004-07-14 14:10:00,0,I'll be fishing out of a red and white Starcraft CStar 170 with a 90hp Evinrude ETEC. Should I be purchasing my bait at camp or is there a better place nearby ?
541746,Guest,2004-07-16 16:43:00,0,"All they have at camp is minnows, last year we bought leeches in Ear Falls. See You Soon! starfish"
