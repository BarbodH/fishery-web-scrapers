We bought some very nice onions at Dutchies store last time we were up, and they were cheaper than here in Iowa, go figure. I'll be going back up again when you're coming home. It'll be a week of kids and grandkids for us. :)"
540666,Guest,2004-06-13 15:57:00,0,"Kingsway, I'll be up there as well that week...The road construction between Dryden and Vermillion Bay is very rough and dirty. If I was pulling a boat I would strongly recommend going through Nestor Falls, unless someone can give you some insight on the shortcut you take by turning west at the end of 502 and avoiding Dryden. My brother has used it but not recently and I wonder with all the rain if it is a good idea or if there may be several problem areas...anyone know more?"
540671,AB,2004-06-13 18:06:00,61,I like to go to the safeway grocery store in Dryden on the way up and get groceries and gas. It's a big store with pumps out front. If you get a safeway card ( available at the service counter or you can download from their website ) you can save alot of money. It's not a credit card just an instant coupon card with no hassles.

I have a Princecraft maroon and cream with a 115 Johnson on the back. I hope we can exchange some info. What lodge do you stay at? Good Luck, Rich King"

541108,Guest,2004-06-23 20:34:00,0,"Rich, I'll keep my eyes peeled, your boat probably looks alot like my crestliner when it comes to colors. I stay at Jim and Julies but spend most of my time on the Big Lake, unless there is an exceptional bite elsewhere, which is very possible this time of year. For me, Big Lake tends to pick up steam as the year progresses, until finally in Aug and Sept it is THE place to be. See ya in a few days...Mike"
541413,kingsway2,2004-07-05 16:39:00,15,"We returned from Wabaskang Lake Late saturday 7/3/04. The fishing was sloooow to start the week, windy (N/W 15 - 20 mph) the high temp for 6/26/04 was 58 deg F. & water temp was 56 deg F. cold nights. It warmed up to the high 80's by week's end and the water temp rose to 65 deg. We had fish for supper 1st day and all that we wanted the whole week. The 3 of us brought back 4 fish each, (3 each in the 17 1/4"" to 17 3/4"" range) and 1 each in the 19 1/2"" to 20"" range. The largest walleye for the week was 21"" We fished pretty hard (10-12 hr days) with breaks for lunch in the mid-day. The water is stained and we started off with night crawlers as we brought a flat of them to use. We trolled the crawlers in 12' to 16' F.O.W. on spinner harnesses rigs (red or chartreuse beads gold metal spinner blade, single hook and a treble trailer hook) using Offshore Inline Planer Boards, trolled at 1.1 to 1.5 mph on GPS. We picked up some this way and the other method was to drift with the help of the trolling motor to position us. We used 1/4 oz. jigs in chartreuse; orange; white; pink color dressed with 3/4 of a night crawler or a minnow and bottom bouncers. We did catch quite a few northern to 27"" while fishing for walleyes. They were all released, as were all of the extra walleyes. On Tuesday 6/29 we fished near Doe Island for Lake trout and marked lots of fish in the 65' to 96' F.O.W range. We used 1# balls in Combination with dodger flashers and spoons or flies and also Tin-flashers (they resemble a school of baitfish) and tried several different spoons also Ralala #11 in rainbow color. We ran a 150' wide pattern back and forth on the GPS The bite was off i.e. we didn't catch any, LOL. One evening as we were heading back to camp we spotted a cow moose with twin calves swimming across a narrow spot between two lakes. We also watched an eagle swooped down to pick a walleye off of the water and return to its nest. I sorry we didn't make contact with Big Mike while we were up there. All in all we had a very nice trip and enjoyed our stay at Lundy's Camp. If anyone wants more info or particulars let me know and I will reply to your e-mail directly. I just want to thank all of the great people here on this site for the useful information that they provided me when I asked for it. Thanks again, Kingsway2 Rich King"
542000,Guest,2004-07-25 13:23:00,0,"I've never heard of this, sound like a great lake, I'll have to check it out!"
540132,Guest,2004-05-30 20:33:00,0,"You wouldn't think the 3 camps in that area, Gawley's, Kingfisher, or Tall Pines would go for that. Alot of their clients make the first narrows their last stop before going in before dark."
540180,cough6609,2004-06-01 14:53:00,48,"I was not aware that was being proposed...might be the reason the previous owners of Kingfishers got out of the business. My guess is that the classification of the 1st narrows would be right after Kingfishers and before Tall Pines...if they are talking about the 2nd narrows up the lake...that's a BIG stretch of water! Never had much luck fishing below the Perrault Falls, although I've seen plenty of people attempting to fish there. Craig"
540184,Trailerguy,2004-06-01 16:51:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Netting stopped on Wabby in the mid 80's. I know the fellow that nets Cedar and Eagle for whitefish in the fall. He had rights on Wabby as well years ago. He said it would take 10 years of netting to ""clean up"" the whitefish in Wabby. The flesh must be very white to be of comercial use, and apparently as the fish age there flesh is more yellow which isn't acceptable. The first thing people think when they see nets are the walleyes are getting caught. Years ago on Eagle the MNR wanted to stop netting. He hired one of their people to work with him while netting whitefish, to prove how few walleyes he netted. I have not heard of any new plans to net Wabaskang."
540185,Trailerguy,2004-06-01 17:15:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]When they make a fish sanctuary, it's open on June 1'st anyway. I didn't see anybody fishing below the falls on the 1'st, and it was too windy for the camp boats to go far, most of the were out on the lee side of an island."
540193,AB,2004-06-02 01:34:00,61,The petition had a topo map with it. It was the whole bay that includes the three camps. I took it as though they wanted no fishing in that area year around.
540194,AB,2004-06-02 01:40:00,61,"Trailerguy, How's that leaky roof project coming along? Did you have time to wet a line?"
540195,Trailerguy,2004-06-02 05:26:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I'd heard that the sanctuary from below the falls was to be extend out to where the ""river"" widens out, which is just before Tall Pines, but the 1st narrows is clear over by Sleepy Dog, or where the old Hudson Bay trading post was at years ago, which would be a lot of overkill IMHO. We fished down in Keynote friday, and up in Gawley's Bay Sat. and caught nice eye's both days. Sun. & Mon. there was just too much wind, I just don't appreciate 3' whitecaps. :)"

We are going up to Wabaskang on the 25th of June and I would like to know the road repair status update. I used to take a cut-off road before Dryden and come out in Oxdrift or somewhere in that area (prefer paved roads if possible)what do you suggest? Where is a good place to buy potatoes and onions? I saw in another post about not being able to keep live fish in your livewell, does that apply to Wabaskang and Wine as well? Thanks, Rich"
540661,Guest,2004-06-13 11:54:00,0,Just got back from Wine and the road from Dryden to Vermillion Bay has a lot of construction. On the way out on Saturday we spent a lot of time waiting. 502 wasn't to bad.

539293,Guest,2004-05-04 08:22:00,0,"Looking forward to seeing you guys up there as well. Half the fun of a fishing trip is the comraderie of friends. Alot of people like to go to Canada and hope they don't see anyone all week, by being alone in a back bay, which is fine for alot of people. However, its alot of fun to meet people on the water and find out how they are doing, where they're from, where they're staying, etc. It is always fun to meet someone new on the lake. Mike"

We used to go there every year the first week of June, but haven't been there in about 6 years after deciding to venture further north to Red Lake. We're really looking forward to going back to Wabaskang (kind of a reunion trip). I'll post our results."

540044,Guest,2004-05-27 21:34:00,0,"The first two days on Wabby were TOUGH!!! As the weather warmed up, so did the action! Had great luck the rest of the week. Water levels were up 2 to 3 feet from last year. Something strange we noticed this year. Many of the walleyes we caught had very strange growths on or near their cheeks. They're typicall round and about the size of half a marble. One of the ones I caught even had some smaller ones on one of his eyeballs. Anyone know what these are? I've noticed a strange twitch in my arm now and am just curious if this is related (just kidding). We did seen many 'eyes though with these weird growths. Should have taken some pictures to post, but didn't think about it at the time. I'd love to hear from someone that may know what this is."
540047,AB,2004-05-27 21:50:00,61,Do you think it could have been related to the spawn?
540097,cough6609,2004-05-29 18:54:00,48,"I see the topic of netting has been brought up on LOTW...any sign of netting going on with Wabby? With the Reserve right there, just wondering? Craig"
540104,AB,2004-05-30 01:35:00,61,"Another point of interest: a proposal to make a ""fish sanctuary"" from the first narrows back to the water falls was being talked about last year. ( I saw a local petition for this ) There would be no fishing in this area. Was wondering what you guys thought of this and to voice your opinions one way or the other to the camp owners."
538797,Trailerguy,2004-04-13 06:25:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I went up to Wabaskang last weekend. The water level was unchanged from last fall, a few inches of slush had refrozen on top, as it was a cold weekend. Hopefully the lakes will start to raise after ice out which would be normal. We went down to Cliff Lake and caught some Lake Trout through about 30"" of ice. I used Gulp Minnows on a jig and the Trout loved them. The locals told me that walleye were late staging for the spawn this year, no one was having any luck with them yet. We saw a lot more birds in the bush than usual, for April, so I think spring isn't to far away for them. On the trip up we didn't see much snow until the area around the border, with about a foot left in the bush around Wabaskang."

I have fished many different lakes in N/W Ontario but never Wabaskang so any reports or tips will be greatly appreciated. I will post a report after our visit. I will be fishing from a Princecraft boat maroon/cream. Thanks and keep a tight line, Rich"
539008,cough6609,2004-04-20 10:04:00,48,"Hi Rich, Tell Jerry and Sally hi from the Coughlin's. Fished from Lundy's that same week a couple years in a row. It's all about weedlines that time of year for the 'eyes. We run three out of the boats and front troll. Back two troll with their favorite choice...I prefer crankin, my father lindy rigs. Front person cast the pockets in the weeds and picks up pike, smallies and larger 'eyes. We pick up less smaller 'eyes and perch by front trolling...less water in my lap on windy days as well. Jerry will tell you where the ""hotel"" is...great place in the evenings to watch the eagles, the sun setting and to have some fun with light tackle & slip bobbers. Anchor right on the reed line(6ft.deep)and rod length out from the boat it drops to 12'. You can pick up 'eyes from 15""-26"" about every 5 min. When the wind dies down, turn around and cast top water lures back into the reeds and get ready to haul in smallies up to 20"". Please, please, please practice catch & release with the smallies...nothing gets my blood boiling more than seeing smallies come into the cleaning house. Great time of the year to fish...heck, every time of the year is a great time to fish! Craig"
