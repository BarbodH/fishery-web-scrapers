541914,Guest,2004-07-22 09:42:00,0,"I'm no big fan of Walmart but, if anybody thinks that the H***'s Angels are just good ole boys out for a little holiday, give your head a shake. It's no secret that they have controlled the drug & prostitution trade for years. Get in their way and they'll have one of their lower, affiliated gangs take of things, if you know what I mean. Ever see someone die from a drug overdose? Ever see a family ripped apart by drugs? Ever see a prostitute so hooked on drugs she can't ever hope of getting out? Well, my freind, they are a huge part of what's wrong with this country. Get your kids hooked on fishing, not drugs!"

541970,Guest,2004-07-23 19:00:00,0,"Why don't you leave Wal-Mart alone. They offer prices at good prices to you and I. They pay better than you think, Lot of you guys think they pay like crap, but if you work there for a while a lot of these people are making between 10-22 bucks an hour. I should know.If you don't like Wal-Mart go shop else where. How would you like everyone bashing the place where you work and pays your bills."
541972,Trailerguy,2004-07-23 20:08:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Walmart pays $10-22 an hour? In your dreams! My daughter has been working for walmart 2 years, and just broke $7 after they adjusted wages due to preasure from the largest class action lawsuit in US history. But then the lawsuit is about sex discrimination not fair wages,lol."

How would you like everyone bashing the place where you >work and pays your bills. > I worked in retails similiar to Wal-Mart and during my time as a Office Mgr. I hired a lot of ex-Wal-Mart employees and it is true that they pay low wages. low hours and the benefits are below average. Big corporate does have control over average workers. If they pay $22 then I want a job there as I have never heard of a employees getting that type of rate there unless he manages the store."
541976,Guest,2004-07-24 09:03:00,0,"Well I would show you my stub but what good would it do. And I am not a mangager, worked for the company for 15 years now started out at 4.25 an hour 15 years ago as a customer service person and then moved to customer service manager and with 5% wages increases and up to 5% merit raises it don't take long over the years to get up in wages, people here in the states that have worked there for years make good money and do have good options. I am not saying Wal-Mart is the best but don't bash them when you don't know them as well as you think. I know guys who work for Wal-Mart putting bikes and grill together and they 15 bucks an hour some less, yea when you start out you have to pay your dues just like any place else. The chances of getting to those wages now with the changes won't be as good now cause of the changes they made. You can think what you want but there are a lot of people that know what they are making in wages that work there, sure you start out now here in the states and you make maybe 7 bucks an hour to start but if you try to move up you will get rewarded just liek any other retailer you just have to put in your time. I am not saying you start out at those higher wages if you do check outs or stock shelves."
541989,Guest,2004-07-25 08:52:00,0,"ttt, I agree with you and if they don't like working for Wal Mart they should look for another job its still a free country."
541993,Guest,2004-07-25 13:11:00,0,Hey! I am darn glad Wal-Mart is there...lol Nice to pay lower prices.!!!!
541857,Matches,2004-07-20 21:48:00,236,"First they build a Wal-Mart, and now they had a ####'s Angels gathering. Getting to be quite the town, eh? Here is link to story: http://www.kenoradailyminerandnews.c...ul19news3.html"
541858,PJM,2004-07-21 00:18:00,3516,"Matches I can't believe your post got censored, next time spell it slleH Angels"
541861,WillieB,2004-07-21 05:56:00,292,...actually He11s Angels works well....
541865,MoWalleyeguy,2004-07-21 08:02:00,409,"Everyone has there place in this world INCLUDING the bikers. I was just up near Kenora but didnt see any of them while I was there. And as far as Walmart goes, I am sure the locals that shop there will benefit from it being there by being able to buy items that are fairly priced. A lot of bad stuff is said about Walmart but the fact is they help keep other stores honest in there pricing and offer a big selection when it comes down to it. Also they help the local economy with inducing lots of TAX dollars, and a ton of jobs. There are downs sides sure, but the benefits out weigh them when it comes down to it. We all need to be open minded with how the world turns and try to help it along and not be part of the problem but rather a positive entity of the total existance. God bless and good fishing"
541867,Guest,2004-07-21 08:41:00,0,"Wall Mart sucks. Welcome bikers, best people in the world."
541879,bubbalou,2004-07-21 12:58:00,29,"WalMart is exactly what's wrong with the world today. Low pay, no benefits,and limited to 28 hours a weeks. There corporate people live in multi-million dollar houses. How do they do it? Screw the working man and the small business owners."
541884,Guest,2004-07-21 15:43:00,0,Bikers are good honest people in their line of work. They play by a different set of rules. They were there on vacation. Give them a break.
541885,Guest,2004-07-21 16:46:00,0,I'd take a thousand bikers in my town in trade for any Wal-Mart Manager or executive! They have one goal...sell everything to everyone...control their suppliers by driving everyone else out of business and than jack the prices up as high as they can. Don't think for one minute they have your best interest at heart. Cough
541887,Guest,2004-07-21 17:16:00,0,"I have not decided yet if Wal-mart's impact is good or bad, but I for one don't shop there anymore. They offer goods at a low $ cost to consumers, but their relentless focus on ""dropping prices"" is done by putting such high demands on suppliers that it is often a major factor in manufacturing jobs being sent over seas(China) where the production cost is very cheap due to low labor costs and no polution controls. OK, so Wal-Mart has low prices, but how many people can not aford it now because their jobs went to China? Wal-Mart is not just the world's largest retailer. It's the world's largest company--bigger than Exxon Mobil, General Motors, and General Electric. It does more business than Target, Sears, Kmart, J.C. Penney, Safeway, and Kroger combined. In 2002, 7.5 cents of every dollar spent in any store in the United States went to Wal-Mart. If your company starts to market products via Wal-Mart, it is only a matter of time before Wal_mart demands you produce more of it at a lower cost, and that means your company will need to find ways to reduce operating costs, and that might mean you are out of work and can't even afford to shop at Wal-Mart's low prices. So, was the low price worth it to you? Just my 2 cents. IaCraig"
