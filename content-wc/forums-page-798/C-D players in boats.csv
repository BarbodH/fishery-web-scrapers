Its nice to have the option. there are no radio stations to speak of in canada so sometimes its nice to have something. My wife brings along books on CDs and plays them while we fish. Its nice to have it if you want it."

542031,E_Fish_N_See,2004-07-26 08:24:00,26,Forget CD player - get Sirius Satellite Radio and listen to commercial free music 24/7! Brought mine to Quebec last week - made the drive so much better. Listening in the cabin was great and wished I had it in the boat (have to wait for the next boat)!
