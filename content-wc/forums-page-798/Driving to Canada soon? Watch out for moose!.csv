541325,Guest,2004-07-02 07:18:00,0,"Did all my driving during the day - didn't see anyting on the way home, but on the way up (afternoon), we saw one bear and a Timberwolf - that was pretty cool. This was between Dryden and Sioux Lookout. A guy that came into our camp the next morning, who drove through the night, said he saw 6 moose and 8 bear - not sure what it is, but the bears seem to be more than plentiful this year - including the bear(s) we had rummaging our camp for a few nights. Drive safe guys."

541559,Guest,2004-07-09 23:22:00,0,"A buddy of mine sent that picture to me the day before I left for Ear Falls. On the way up from Dryden to Ear Falls saw 3 Moose and 7 Bear. Believe me after I saw those pictures, I definitely had my eyes wide open."
541561,Ogoki,2004-07-10 07:29:00,291,"Last week we saw 4 moose , 2 bears and one wolf on 527 between T-Bay and Armstrong. In addition we saw 5 different eagles, several ospreys , and several snowshoe hare while in camp. Love to see wildlife but not on the roads."
542004,Guest,2004-07-25 13:28:00,0,"I read this article before we left. Thank you! We had the camera out about 45 minutes before dark each night we were driving back from LS. We saw a few, but no danger. Got great pix...will link to a post of pix soon. PS>...anyone ever seen a SemiTruck and a Moose's aftermath....NOT PRETTY! POP"
542022,Guest,2004-07-26 06:48:00,0,"We saw a Timberwolf chewing on a moose skeleton on the side of the road, between Dryden and Sioux Lookout - my guess is the moose was hit by something, hopefully not a car for the cars sake."
542028,Guest,2004-07-26 07:05:00,0,>We saw a Timberwolf chewing on a moose skeleton on the side >of the road...< Was it Kevin Garnet? ;) LOL Average Joe
542033,Guest,2004-07-26 08:34:00,0,Unfortunately not. Only one thing cooler than seeing a Timberwolf eating a moose skelton - would be K.G. eating a moose skeleton. ha ha
541031,bigfish1965,2004-06-21 21:03:00,3210,Apparently the moose are escaping the bugs in the woods by coming out to the roadways...here's the result...don't know what happened to the driver..BE CAREFUL!http://www.ontariofishing.net/cgi/me...ta/16162.shtml
541034,brw,2004-06-21 21:35:00,4,thanks bigfish I'm heading North of Wawa next month and the motel where we made reservations with warned us of this. She said look out for bears and moose especially at dusk. So I thought I'd pass that along for what it's worth. Slowing down 5 mph can make all the difference sometimes...........
541192,Go_Fish,2004-06-28 05:43:00,28,"We saw 7 on our latest trip, all but one between Vermillion Bay, and Ear Falls. Go_Fish"
541204,Guest,2004-06-28 10:23:00,0,we saw 5 all between Fort Francis and Dryden. If I planned it again I wouldn't drive that section at dusk or later.
541217,Guest,2004-06-28 16:51:00,0,BRW: Where are you headed around Wawa? We are going to Prairie Bee Lake about 50 miles east of Wawa in July.
541234,porcupine,2004-06-29 20:26:00,9,I would keep my eyes peeled for bear as well as the swamp donkeys. I am seeing two or three bears per day on my travels and a couple have bolted out onto the highway and been hit.
541271,Larry S,2004-07-01 07:14:00,666,"Saw a moose on the side of the road in the middle of the day by Wawa. Had a nice set of horns on him,he looked up at us and went back to eating Larry S"
541281,Guest,2004-07-01 12:02:00,0,Last year we saw 2 moose at night while driving home from Ignace at 3:00 in morning.scared the driver so bad that had to pull to the side of the road.We now leave in the day and stay at Grand Portage casino.(why did'nt we think of that before)
541288,bigfish1965,2004-07-02 00:15:00,3210,I saw one last summer as I was driving at night in the fog at Lake Nippissing. Thought I was imagining things. Just all of a sudden it was black. The moose towered over my car like a goliath. It snorted a large amount of moose boogers on my car and stared at me. I turned around and went back to where I came from.
