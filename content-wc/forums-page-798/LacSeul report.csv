Caught most of our fish w/jig and minnow in 2-10 ft of water, rocky, gravly windward shorelines. Also, banged fish all day long on reefs and rock piles in the shallows....21""-25"" all day long!!! :) Caught my 28"" in about 3 ft. Not to mention the weather was awesome! Where else can you catch lots of walleye in beautiful weather? Only July on LacSeul! Back to reality...sigh..."

Seven days of heaven I found some hidden bays that I didn't know existed until earlier this spring when I bought some satellite imagery of the lake and its surrounding areas. My groups studied the photos and brought a couple smaller boats -- 14 footers -- to access a couple distant lakes off of some old logging trails the satellite photos were right on the money!!! On one lake, (two miles by two miles) we caught 5 Pike over 46""!! It seemed that every cast we had a pike, luckily one guy brought some barbless hooks so we could release the Pike in the water. I don't think this lake has ever been fished, Can you believe we drove right up to the edge, slide our boats off the back, and were able to catch 5 trophy pike in the first two hours without having to pay the high cost of fly ins? We also found creeks, using the satellite image maps, to access a remote part Lac Seul. The bugs weren't too bad because it seemed to be raining constantly: however, the eyes were on fire. Our group only had conservation licences so when we had doubles and triples on we were technically in violation of the law for having too many fish. Water levels were high so some islands from two years ago were now under water. Thank God for the photos because we were able to avoid running aground because the photos showed most of the underwater boulders! Next year we are going to tackle more remote areas. I got my stuff at http://www.teamd3.net/canada - for than less than 50 bucks!! Best money I've ever spent on my Canadian fishing and the wife was not even pissed. John Walker Chippewa Falls, WI P.S. We stayed in Siuox Lookout and accessed the East Side of LS."

541962,Guest,2004-07-23 14:38:00,0,"Sorry for any offense I may have caused. I posted last night on a handful of sites I read regularly. I am more of a lurker. Yet, I guess I am still just a little stoked from the trip...and I got carried away telling the story. I think posting is addictive..lol I did not think I was advertising..lol But, when I re-read a couple of the posts I guess one could take it that way. So, again, sorry for that. The interesting this is, I read about ""the site...URL WITHHELD..lol"" on a message board last winter. That is how I found out about it. And, I guess I just wanted to share. I have been going to N.W. Ontario for about 17 years. Yet, this year was the most fun b/c I was able to become part explorer, part navigator, and part fisherman. Instead of just fishing for fish, I was fishing for lakes. It was a welcomed change of pace. Yet, out of respect for the other lurkers like me, I will not post the url of the satellite image site because I don't want to be a spokesman without being paid for it..lol My Apologies, again, JW"
541990,Guest,2004-07-25 09:01:00,0,Don't be sorry for posting. Had you not I wouldn't have found the site with the Sat Images. I'm heading up in Aug and I'm sure that the Sat pics will be with me. Thank you.
