Are they deep, shallow? Minnows working better than leeches? Trolling cranks? Just looking for some general information to eliminate some guess work. Thanks"
541816,Steve1,2004-07-19 20:40:00,37,I was on Eagle the 11th thru the 14th. We left because the fishing sucked and the kids were having a bad the time. The mayflies were hatching and everyone at the resort was having a poor time at fishing. I hope it picked up for the folks that stayed the rest of the week. I was nothing but a disapointment for me.

541889,Guest,2004-07-21 18:48:00,0,"I was thinking that is why they offer so many drive out and fly out packages. Eagle must suck. When I told a relative that I was going to Eagle, he said that the lake sucked. Now I beleive him."

Who ever you talk to who has been to Canada and Wisconsin or where ever has said they have not had the luck as other years, The weather has been colder than normal and it screwed the pattern of the fish up, you just have to fish them differant than you are use to. Try differant presentations and differant area, they are there. I have fished Eagle for many years and the fishing has been great, this year with the colder weather the patterns were just a little behind."
541967,Guest,2004-07-23 18:16:00,0,That kind of makes me feel better. I was beginning to think that I just suck at fishing or picking areas to fish.
541982,Guest,2004-07-24 16:38:00,0,Your orignal observation was correct. I had a cottage on Eagle for several years and sold it and moved to another lake. Very poor quality fishery.
