540683,Mattman,2004-06-14 05:32:00,1603,I'm heading up to Dogtooth on Wednesday morning and I was wondering if anyone has been up there in '04. This will be my 3rd year up there. Any reports for me? Water level? Water temps? How was the fishing? Thanks Matt Davis Better to have and not need than to need and not have! Otterods - High performance hand crafted fishing rods.

Walleye fishing was probably the worst we've had in 12 years. Still some big fish here and there, but not many in numbers. Fishing did pick up on Friday, so hopefully it will continue to improve for you. Active walleye were either down at about 20 foot or up at about 5-6, but nothing in between. Kilvert lake was terrible this year, not many walleye at all active over there for us anyways. Good news is that we had 8 fish over 26 inches on Friday, so hopefully that means luck for you. Let me know what worked out for you when you get back and how your fishing was. Steve"
540754,Mattman,2004-06-15 09:15:00,1603,Thanks for the info. I'll let you know how we did after I get back. Temps look to be cool for my time period. Variable cloudiness. Low chance for precip. Some wind. Fairly stable. Hopefully they'll have the feedbag on. Matt Davis Better to have and not need than to need and not have! Otterods - High performance hand crafted fishing rods.
541151,yellowdog,2004-06-25 09:23:00,5,any new info on the lake would be appreciated. We are headed up soon. Water level? Kilvert? etc etc.
541153,Mattman,2004-06-25 10:22:00,1603,"Oh yea, sorry, I was going to post a report. Fishing was slow. We did catch some fish, not much big stuff though. Seemed to find more fish deep. 20'. Caught bigger fish up shallow, although they were very few and very far between. Water levels are up from last year. Water temps were waaay down. Had 58 - 63 depending on where we were. Guess when the Walleye spawn was just starting 18"" of snow fell and shut the spawn down. Evidently no spawn this season and the females are laying low reabsorbing their eggs.

One more question also, Anyone have a good, cheap, safe from theft hotel to stay at between Duluth and International falls. We want to get some of the trip done Thursday night and want to get 4-5 hours of sleep before heading across the border Friday morning, so we don't want to spend alot of money."
