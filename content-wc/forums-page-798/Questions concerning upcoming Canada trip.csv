Weather seems more unsettled than other years. Fishing north of Red Lake it was feast or famine most of the week. Wind changed to the south the last day and fishing was as good as it gets all day long. First time I have had to return to the cabin for more leeches in the middle of the day. Fish had an empty belly and they were on a bing. During the week fish were really scattered and very few things we put in the water impressed them. Weed edges seemed to be the only thing half ways reliable during the week. Humps and reefs were good for about one or two fish each then we had to move on. Headed back up next week. Weather sounds more promising. Have a good trip. Pooch
