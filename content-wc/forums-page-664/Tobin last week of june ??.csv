Might not be so great on the river at that time if there is a large spring runoff like it looks could happen. The river gets pretty stirred up. All depends on how early the warm weather comes. If you have not been there before take caution of the logs that will be floating out in the lake. Happens whenever the water level rises. The logs float off the shore. The logs came about when the lake bottom was formed. The logs were supposed to be removed but this didn't happen. There is lots of structure and I haven't fished around Prudents much but there is a nice big sand bar just west of the Tobin Lake Lodge that has treated me well. Good Luck, it's a great body of water. W5"

The break lines (old river channel) in the upper end of the lake. (Between Eagle Nest and Tobin Lake Resort). Weed edges On the main lake points down stream (or east) of Tobin Lake Resort. ""The flats""....patchy weeds there. ""Elk Island"" Nice time to be there, as it is light about 20 hours a day. The ""evening bite"" is about 3 hours long that time of year. LOL"

563711,DaveD,2007-03-03 22:27:00,57,If you are going through Saskatoon during business hours you should be able to get dry ice at Praxair but I would phone first to confirm.
