I'm planning on going to the Quebec/Ottawa region and looking at a few different outfitters right now...Lake O'sullivan being one of them...couple of the others are, Wapoos Sibi Game Club and lake Ogascanan. We will probably go with one of the three... >"
563719,Guest,2007-03-04 19:35:00,0,O'Sullivan is a great location and excellent Lodge. I've gone for 11 straight years and never been disappointed. The fishing has improved every year. I hope you try it. Andy
563722,Guest,2007-03-05 08:03:00,0,"Alright, where are all the O'Sullivan guys???!! Greg, Bruce, et al: where are ya? Summer is right around the corner and I'm holding a hot spot for the first guy to write in and ask ""where?"" It's a hot one, trust me. All you midwest guys that worship in Manitoba ought to take a lesson and travel east and hook up with some real 'eyes in Quebec. Clue: it's north from the Lodge, past two little islands where the Eagles soar. (7-14', sandy bottom) Come on...I don't want to work this Monday morning!"

563754,Guest,2007-03-07 13:18:00,0,It's flat in in the south end but once you get north of Lake Winnipeg (about 400 miles north of Winnipeg)the terrain totally changes. Thats where the true trophy pike fisheries are.
