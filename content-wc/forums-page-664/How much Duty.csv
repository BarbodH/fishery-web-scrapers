563832,mcdee,2007-03-10 21:53:00,276,I live in Manitoba and want to buy a 2003 boat for $15.000 from the U.S. How much duty ? I'LL drive down and pick up myself with a insured trailer or Whats the best way?
563838,Guest,2007-03-11 14:13:00,0,No duty just GST and PST. In Ontario they collect both at the border. You will need to get a cerification on a trailer if you're buying that there. The fee is $206. Best to talk to the border guys and explain what you're doing.
