I watch a tv show Butch Furtman I believe, they were catching some real nice eyes...I believe that the name of the resort was also Dogtooth, and that it was a drive in..located some place in Ont...but would really appreciate it if someone could assist with some more info on the lake and maybe even the resort....would be driving from ND... Thanks in advance..."

It is a well known walleye lake with a more than decent shot a 30"" walleyes, even in the summer. I have a friend who goes there and trolls up 30+"" walleyes regularly. If you type in a Google search for Dogtooth Lake Resort you will find links to Ontario Tourism that will give you more information.You can contact the owners at [email protected]"

Went to Dogtooth last year on my first Canadian trip ever. Had a ball. Weather was very uncooperative, and will still did ok. Caught enough eaters for the week and a few big ones for CPR. (Catch-Picture-Release) Caught my personal best walleye. A nice healthy 26 incher. I haven't fished walleyes very much, but after that trip you can bet I will try to more often. Hope to be going again this year. If it works out I'll be going June 9th-16th. There's not much out there as far as info about Dogtooth. Mostly word of mouth and a few odd snippets on the internet. If you need more info I'll help the best I can. You can e-mail me at [email protected]. Joe"
