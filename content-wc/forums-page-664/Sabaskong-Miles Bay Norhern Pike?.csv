563713,Ia Walihntr,2007-03-04 08:07:00,320,"Steve, Have seen it both ways and it all depends on the water temps. Have seen times when the middle of June had walleyes still on the points and flats, and other years when most walleyes were already on the reefs and midlake humps by the middle of June. It can be a crap shoot but The transition is usually rather quick. If you can't find them on shorline flats or points, they have moved out to thier summer positions. If you have more confidence in fishing the Miles Bay area for walleye, do it. Confidence in where you are fishing and what presentation you use definentely plays a part in fishing sucess. If you fish that area, try finding some spots it Obabikon Bay. Obabikon can be excelent for walleye. Marv"
563690,VMS,2007-03-02 10:04:00,1103,"Hi again, Trip for walleyes and Northerns looking better by the minute. So..next question is where in general will the walleyes be and how decent are the northerns? I usually am up there mid July, so the walleyes are on the reefs and I'm fishing muskies... I am assuming the northerns to be in weedy bays, but how will the action for them be and what types of lures seem to produce best? We are a group of little cleo fanatics (we all own probably around 30 each from our success in manitoba on them), but if there are other items that work good if not better, we'd want to plan for that too. Thanks again for all the help. This is probably going to be the last trip for a major portion of our group due to age. Steve"
563691,rockpt,2007-03-02 13:50:00,589,"Mid June I'm guessing the eyes will still be in spring pattern. Sandy bays and shoreline. If you want lots of northern action you should go into Obabikon Lake. It's a large, shallow, weedy lake connected to Obabikon Bay via a narrow channel. Maybe you've been in Obabikon. If not, it's a bit tricky navigating the narrows, depending on the the water level and size of your boat. I think the channel into Obabikon is also good for spring northerns. If you're going to be spending a lot of time in Obabikon, you might better camp up in Miles Bay instead of near Round Island. Good luck."
563692,VMS,2007-03-02 15:56:00,1103,"I was thinking that might be a better bet, plus it would put us closer to decent walleyes as well. I have never been in Obabikan so that is a definite possibility too. Not sure how much pressure that area gets...I've only been close to that area but have never explored it in depth. How are stoney and stevens bay for northerns? I know they are quite weedy as well, but have never ventured into them. Thanks for the help!! Steve"
563694,Ia Walihntr,2007-03-02 21:03:00,320,"Steve, Stevens Bay is hot for northerns, particularly in the big part of the bay just south of Youngs Wilderness Resort, but the entire length of Stevens Bay on the north side can be just as hot at times. Target weed growth from 12 feet and on shallower. Larger northern in the 12 to 8 feet, depending on the density of the weeds, with hammer handles from 8 ft and shallower. Any bait that will be somewhat weedless will work. My favorite would be a half once or bigger spinnerbait. Islands and shoreline that have a small sand beaches with reeds and deeper water nearby will hold larger northern ( 30 inches and up) and muskys. I havent fished Stoney Portage Bay but---same structure and weed and depth characteristics as Stevens Bay and will probably fish the same. Marv"
563695,esgrams,2007-03-03 06:44:00,92,"Steve-Stoney does fish the same as Stevens, they have very similar structure,, A good Northern bay is way back in stoney on the south side.. We call it Long Bay for obvious reasons. Its runs NorthEast to SouthWest, You won't be able to get all the way back in that time of year, but it produces fish.. Generally the mouth of the bay produces the quality fish and further in produces the quanity.. Eric"
563696,VMS,2007-03-03 07:29:00,1103,"Thanks for all the help guys!! This is giving me some good ideas of what Island I should be considering to stay at. With good northerns to the east, and walleyes to the north, I may have to take that into account. Thanks again and keep it coming if there are more ideas. Steve"
563707,Guest,2007-03-03 16:14:00,0,Stayed at Rex Tolten's (Miles Bay) last year. A very simple camp but without a doubt the nicest most hospitible camp owners we have ever met regardless of price. I would definitely recommend them...great people that you like to give your business to. We were there the second week of July and did very well on muskie and walleye. Also found some nice pike but they were a bit challenging due to the warm water and time of year.
563708,Ia Walihntr,2007-03-03 16:27:00,320,"Steve, If you are thinking of fishing walleye in or near Miles Bay and northern in Stevens or Stoney Portage Bays, the you should find somewhere near equidistant from both spots to camp. Looking at the map, I'm guessing that the south entrance to Burrow Bay would be close to a middle distance. There is a large island at the south entrance to Burrow Bay called Buff Island that may work out or you may want to try one of the islands in Burrow Bay itself. Those islands may be a little more protected during windy conditions. If you want to limit your entire fishing to a smaller area, I would suggest fishing for walleye from Raspberry Island to Hay Island in Sabaskong Bay and fishing northern in Stevens Bay and Stoney Portage Bay. The area from Raspberry to Hay Islands has numerous reefs and humps that hold walleye. As a bonus, many of the reefs in that area will hold musky also. If you use this scenerio, there are literally tons of options for an island to camp on. Hope this gives you some options. Marv"
563710,VMS,2007-03-03 21:52:00,1103,"I've fished in those areas for walleyes before, but we didn't do so well...last year we tried the reefs west of Hay Island and got nothing (mid July and Hotter than a pistol too). Will the walleyes be on the reefs in Mid June in that area? If so, that is good. Thanks Steve"
563712,esgrams,2007-03-04 07:53:00,92,"Steve-We fish that area the first week of June and they are relating to the reefs then,,I'll have to dig out my map and give you some of my spots--You're up there at a different time so it's not going to affect my group in any way,,Public water anyway,, Hope you have a great trip,,I'm jealous, I don't get to go until fall this year, and the wait is driving me nuts..Eric"
