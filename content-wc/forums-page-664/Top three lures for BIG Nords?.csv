563726,Guest,2007-03-05 13:59:00,0,"my brother in law has chased big northerns for 25 years. he has pretty much narrowed it down to the #4 mepps spinner. he claims it's not necessarily what you throw, it's where you throw and the time in the water. there are no northern in the boat. he always catches big ones (40+ inches) on every trip to lac seul."
563734,rpieske,2007-03-06 08:09:00,1276,"I have enjoyed catching big northerns for over 50 years in NW Ontario. I would make sure you fish these lures to increase your catch, especially on large northerns: Buchertail 500 bucktail silver/sunset 10"" Fin-S-Minnow with a single LARGE hook twitched/jerked Crane Bait used as a crank/Twitch Spinner bait like a Buchertail Slopmaster Walk the dog lure like a Spook Glide bait like a Manta or a Bobbie Bait Daredevil spoon 5 of diamonds Suick I'll ditto the remark about location being more important than lure choice. The above lures will cover most situations."

Another I have had pretty good success with is the Rapala Husky Jerk... using a very erratic, twitching retrieve. All the best, Greg Bolinski Agate Bay Lodgewww.agatebaylodge.com NPAA #944"
563746,Guest,2007-03-07 06:41:00,0,"Whit and Bob: Thanks for the reply. Location, location....eh? My thoughts for mid-July fishing in the Gouin, just a HUGE reservoir with mazes of islands, points, and bays is as follows: first thought is shallow bays, especially any with stumps and protruding rocks. Next....points and channels between islands. In all cases I'd be thinking a retrieve from the shallows to deeper water. Have also thought of doing a slow troll through the shallows with an electric motor...flatlining well back from the boat. We'd be working with small 14' boats and 10 horse motors, with a small electric trolling motor. Am I missing anything obvious for prime locations? Thanks!"
563749,Seanik,2007-03-07 09:10:00,218,"Baxter, Our gang from Pa will also be at the Gouin Reservoir (Walleye Point) the week of July 14 - 21. This is our 3rd trip there, we like the relaxed atmosphere and the easy fishing. Most of the big Northerns we caught where on points in the 20' depth. Shallow bays and weeds produced mostly hammerhandles. The best producing lures for us were, daredevil 5 of diamonds, jointed shad raps and jointed rapalas in firetiger and black/gold color combinations. We use leeches and crawlers fished straight over the side for Walleyes, sometimes with a jig, very few Northerns are caught using this method. Somewhat surprising since we are at the right depths for big Northerns. I believe water temps. and reservoir water levels affect where the Northerns are. See you on the Reservoir or email at [email protected]"
563762,Guest,2007-03-07 19:42:00,0,"baxter, can't really help you here. i don't fool with them personally. i do know that he chews up a lot of props and occasionally i see him back in stump fields where i would never venture. he also likes to fish anywhere that there is an inflow of water. we fish in july-august so it is generally hot. good luck."
563771,Guest,2007-03-08 10:04:00,0,"Baxter, On my last trip to Gouin,we caught almost all of our Northerns on gold ,four and one half inch Dr.Spoons.We caught a few on gold and five of diamonds Johnson Silver minnows.The best crank baits are Crane 207 and J13 rebels.We did not catch a lot of pike but the conditions were terrible.Hope you have better luck.Pikeman 1"
563809,schick,2007-03-10 05:12:00,35,"In real estate they say the top 3 keys to a successful sale are location, location and location. The top 3 lures for pike are --- Dr. Spoons, Dr. Spoons and Dr. Spoons. Get the largest ones silver and gold and replace the hooks with a red muskie sized hook. Don't let it dangle over the side of the boat or you will lose rod, reel and the Dr. Spoon. Good luck. NE Piker"
