563835,schick,2007-03-11 08:45:00,35,"We fish Lac Seul very late May into early June. We normally use jigs with crawlers or jigs with minnows. We seem to have the best luck just off the current of outlets into the main lake in shallow water. I would like to hear from anyone else that fishes that early as to the techniques you use. It is hard for me to break away from fishing for the pike, so I need all the help I can get when I do go after the eyes. NE Piker"
563698,Guest,2007-03-03 07:58:00,0,"I have been to Lac Seul many times and I have caught many nice fish. However, most of the fish are under 20 inches and I was wondering what some other folks do to find and catch the bigger walleyes."
563700,JDP,2007-03-03 09:46:00,1457,"What time of year do you fish Lac Seul, what part of the lake do you fish (i.e. NW, Central, NE,etc, what methods/presentations are employing?"
563701,Guest,2007-03-03 11:05:00,0,Destroyer...help this guy out....you are of course a better fisherman then NWO!!!!!!!!
563703,Guest,2007-03-03 14:28:00,0,"NE section. Mid July to early August. Jig w/half a crawler. I check out points and reefs with sonar and I fish 'em if they are there. Don't get me wrong, I catch a lot of fish and I am not complaining. I was just wondering if I am missing something as far as the big fish go. Thanks for the help. Skinny"
563705,prov1900,2007-03-03 15:13:00,544,"You are definately going during the prime trophy time. Upsize your bait and keep trying. We catch a lot of 25 inchers when we go, but that is about a month later. Good luck. You'll get them."
563706,Guest,2007-03-03 15:35:00,0,"Finally....someone giving me the recognition I deserve, and yes I am a better angler than NWO, thanks for noticing. I am not going to write a novel about how to target big walleye, that is someone elses niche and I don't want to step on that. If this was 5 years ago I could tell you exactly where and how to find big walleye on Seul. Its not a matter of me not knowing anymore but rather I believe there has been a decline in the top end size, those fish 28-32"". There seems to be a huge bubble in the population pyramid of fish between 20-25"" and I believe they are eating a large amount of forage leaving less for the larger, older, slower, less active fish to find. As a result the big walleye are getting thinner (i am sure many of you have noticed skinnier than normal 29+"" fish). The implementation of the slot size caused this change in the population structure. Its not necessarily a bad thing, people are catching more fish per day than 5 years ago but fewer of those are super big fish. In due time that size bracket will become large and there will once again be a bulk of trophies caught again. I will stress that this is just my opinion and not fact, just what I have noticed as a result of spending 700 days on Seul over the past 8 years. It is normal for lakes to have shifts in the population, so it should be business as usual. Go out try the same spots, catch a boat load of fish and I hope you get some big ones. One way of trying to target big fish that has worked for me on other trophy walleye lakes is move away from areas where you are pounding small fish...this is hard because its fun to stick fish one after the other but likely the big ones aren't there are or can't get at your bait for all the other ones around. So move to good looking points and sand bars near deep water and if you don't catch fish in the first 10 minutes don't leave like normal, wait it out, move slightly, vary your depth and tactics. The other thing to try is increase the size of your bait. I like using 4-6"" suckers on a bare jig, dragged slowly, not jigged! If you like to troll put the sucker on a worm harness with two hooks and again move slow. Espceially in the late summer and fall big walleye want a big meal and you will be plesently surprised with the results. I guess it turned out to be a novel in the end...I guess NWO Bum and I aren't too different after all. I just have a more edgy side sometimes. D"
563724,Mike Kansas,2007-03-05 08:28:00,1463,"Good information from Destroyer. Majority of our large Walleye (29""+up)have come while dragging cranks or bottom bouncing. We like to work areas that are deeper than normal fish patterns for that time of year and are defined by ledges and drop off edges. Long flats that allow you to cover lots of water can be very productive. Look for irregular structure on these flats and work those areas hard. Sometimes just a 2' change in water depth holds a couple of big loners or a small school of large fish. Keying on larger fish can be slow but sometimes very rewarding. Small bays have had a tendency to produce big fish for us in June. These bays normally have gradual depths in them and have structure such as weeds or winter fall downs. I like to fish in 8 to 12' water and drag cranks or BB. Seems that big girls will rest in those areas and if good structure is there they can forage easily and alone. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
563727,Guest,2007-03-05 14:24:00,0,"2 years ago i got lucky on about a 300 yard run. i caught a 22, 24, 26.5 and a 28.5. guess which one fought the best. the 22, followed by the 24. the other 2 were weak fighters and seemed soft and mushy compared to the smaller ones. this was in july on lac seul in about 17 foot following a ledge with a bouncer and a crawler. i think destroyer is on to something about the big girls, but i could hardly be considered expert since i catch so few of them."
563728,Guest,2007-03-05 18:05:00,0,"When I caught my big one on LS I weeded out A TON of small one's. Is it that the bigger fish finally moved in??? Do know that after 10-15 mins no decent fish will move locations. Sometimes its shifting to deeper, shallower or entirely different structure. Don't be affraid to think outside the box....."
563821,Guest,2007-03-10 12:45:00,0,"ok, for those of you reading Kansas Mike info, he sits in the boat and I put him on the fish. secondarly windy points in 12-20' is where most of the good fish come from in June. about 1/4 to 1/3 of ours will be over the slot. do any of you know if Lac Suel has crawdads?
