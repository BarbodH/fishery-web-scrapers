We really appreciated the last owners and hope for the best with the new ones. It seems that lodges are changing owners frequently of late. Perhaps the USD devaluation, increased transportation costs, and changing limits may have affected things. I wonder if the passport issue will make any difference. There has not seemed to be many fisherman on the Winnipeg River the last 2 or so years over Memorial Day week. We fish smallmouth primarily, and have had many good times and great memories, along with good natured smallmouth contests. Hope all have a great time wherever you go, Don"
