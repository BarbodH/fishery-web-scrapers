563858,Guest,2007-03-12 13:06:00,0,"Part of what makes Lac Seul such a prolific fishery is the variety, diversity, and quantity of forage available. Different populations of walleyes key on distinct forage depending on time of year and relative availability. Smelt, ciscoe, perch, various lake shiners, and aquatic insects (primarily mayfly larvae) will all be key prey at different times of the year. With the number of different populations of walleyes in Lac Seul, the answer can be any one of the above mentioned or even all of the above at the same time. Different size classes of walleyes key on different forage. Big walleyes tend to focus more on larger prey. Changes in relative abundance are also critical. Time of year is also key. Mayfly larvae are more important to smaller walleyes and only in the months leading up to the hatch. The most surprising observation that we have made over the past several years is the dramatic shifts in walleye location. General areas on fire for production one year will be a wasteland the next. Almost certainly dependent on forage, the causes and effects we are left to only speculate. If I was asked to guess the relative order of importance for big walleyes on Lac Seul, I would list them in descending order; Smelt, perch, ciscoe, shiners, insects, and various others.
