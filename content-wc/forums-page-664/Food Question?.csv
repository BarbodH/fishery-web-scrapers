563650,Paul H,2007-02-26 12:28:00,1232,>we must make our sweets with Cuban sugar that is unavailable >south of the border. Nope - it's just REAL sugar. US mainly uses corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup. Canadian and Mexican Coke and Pepsi seem sweeter to me.
563667,Burr,2007-02-27 13:34:00,8612,Always thought it was odd that there wasn't any 'Canadian Bacon' in Canada. LOL.
563668,Guest,2007-02-27 14:36:00,0,Thats because we call it Peameal bacon.
563669,Guest,2007-02-27 15:07:00,0,Canadian Bacon sold in the US is basically ham. Peameal bacon is waaaaaaay better!
563729,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-03-05 18:25:00,80,We took canned potatoes last year. Sliced em' up and cooked them with onions and they were as good as any other taters. joe
563735,Guest,2007-03-06 09:49:00,0,"is it just me or is the kfc really bad in cananda? last year we happend to be in canada for their thanks giving so many of the local diners were closed and we saw that kfc was open and thats the last time ill ever go to a canadian kfc. chicken legs that look like pheasant legs, and the breading, since when is kfc only a one style of breading place and not to mention it wasnt even original recipie. other than that not too horrible. oh yeah and since it was 7:45pm and almost closing they only had 9 pieces left and there was 4 of us. needless to say we also stopped at a gas station on the way back to the hotel."
563750,Guest,2007-03-07 09:49:00,0,Not just Canada. We stopped at KFC in Intl Falls it sucked.

563568,Guest,2007-02-23 18:04:00,0,"LOL......grew up in the US with just sour cream & onion, also bbq. Came to Canada 30 odd years and found all kids of flavored chips I'd never heard of. Miss Vickie's chips are GREAT."

563619,Guest,2007-02-23 18:39:00,0,Canada has poo-tin. Great stuff to clog the arteries. Also salt and vinegar chips.
563622,balsl6,2007-02-23 21:07:00,426,"The chocolate has to be the best around. Kit kats, cadbury's etc. the. cookies seem better also. I was told it has to do something with the sugar they use. My wife and kids want me to bring them candy when I come home. When they go they always make a special stop for candy. It may be more expensive the canadians have to live also. Good luck"
563623,grt1,2007-02-23 21:13:00,259,we must make our sweets with Cuban sugar that is unavailable south of the border.
563626,prov1900,2007-02-24 08:13:00,544,">You can buy Jam in can at Shoppers Supplie store in the >states for about $3.00 a can less. That's a good deal, because where I live, the same jam is two dollars higher than it is in Canada. That is why I always stock up for the year when I come across. That jam is the best there is...period."
563629,Guest,2007-02-24 16:42:00,0,Love the fries(chips) with gravy. Canadian beef i could go without though.
563631,Guest,2007-02-24 18:34:00,0,"Chips and gravy is ""Poutine"" ...pronounced poo-tin It is actually fries, cheese curds, brown gravy and lots of salt and vinegar. It is a staple of the Canadian diet. At least it is in Ottawa where my friends live. It was unbelievable good."
563548,Guest,2007-02-23 08:34:00,0,"My question is, what do you buy in Canada, beside the Potatoes, that is better than USA products? I heard one say that catsup was better than our, in USA. Also their beer is good/better too. We also buy the jam in the can."
