I'de like to keep the resort we chose, to be within a 4 to 6 hour drive out of Montreal.... Interested in a good houskeeping plan, as we enjoy the quiet and like to spend time cooking together. Have any of you been to Wapoos Sibi Game Club? This is one I'm looking at, but haven't decided yet.. We enjoy fishing for eyes, pike , lake trout...... Any and all recomendations would be appreciated.. Sincerely, Ned Lessor and Family. CT., USA"

Go to http://www.qof.ca/en/ and use the search tool called Finding an Outfitter. Select your region of choice from the menu and then select a product e.g. fishing and do the search. Then you can check out the list of outfitters provided in the search result. You can also download PDF documents regarding Hunting and Fishing packages Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4 from the same web site. Sent you a message as well."
