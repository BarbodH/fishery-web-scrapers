If anyone has had the experience, I would greatly appreciate anything about it that you would care to share - good or bad. (I'm go'n either way) :) Thanks."

563885,Guest,2007-03-14 08:00:00,0,"2 Dogs, thanks for the reply. I've been going to Evergreen since '97 and really enjoy it, but, have only ""talked"" about Twin Falls. I'm really looking forward to it. Without giving up all your secrets, is there anything you would suggest for Northerns? The lake looks pretty small on the sat-map. Any depth to it? Thanks again."
563889,2 DOGS,2007-03-14 10:40:00,361,"I've been going to Evergreen since 98, caught a 42"" pike off that dock I mentioned fishing for walleye. Jig & minnow. Ogani is pretty shallow, REAL shallow in a couple of spots, be careful. The big northern seemed to be found near the walleye. Check the spots already mentioned. You won't find the numbers of big walleye like on Seul, but I'd bet you run out of bait!"
563890,Guest,2007-03-14 12:00:00,0,"Hey 2 Dogs, thanks again! Maybe we'll meet up there some time. I'm going the last week in May. Are you, by chance, the group going for the opener? Whenever you get there, tell them Frenchy says hello. One last thing and I'll try to quit bugging you; I've had some experience with those ""real"" shallow areas on Lac Seul. I donated a lower unit within the first 5 minutes of my trip a few years ago when the lake was waaaay down. I was just wondering if there were any concerns between the portage trail and the cabin that we need to worry about. Thanks a bunch."
563891,2 DOGS,2007-03-14 12:33:00,361,"I only visit Twin Falls occasionally, spend most of my time on Lac Seul. Gary will have a map of Ogani (I think) with the places marked to avoid. If not, the easiest way to tell you is go directly across to the opposite shoreline from landing then follow it around to the creek. There are a few boulders there also, so go slow through there. I'd suggest you take a portable depthfinder."
563893,Guest,2007-03-14 12:58:00,0,"""Depth Finders Are Us"". Thanks for taking the time to respond. It will give us some things to ponder during the upcoming ""planning sessions"". Take Care & good fishing."
