563679,mcdee,2007-02-28 08:18:00,276,I don't here anything about walleye caught in the upper portion of Lake Winnipeg. There must be some hogs up there!
563685,manitobawalleye,2007-03-01 04:46:00,885,"access would be a key issue anama in north basin? surprisingly few real big ones caught there not many big ones at grand rapids either compared to pinefalls and the red.... you never hear about fall greenback runs at grand manitoba .... a 100,000 lakes how many walleyes ???? i will never have enough time...."
563686,mcdee,2007-03-01 06:54:00,276,Whats the biggest Walleye caught in Manitoba commercialy?
563688,River_eye,2007-03-01 16:51:00,1486,"The North Basin of Lake Winnipeg is having some serious water quality issues, and has been for some time. Huge algae blooms due to nutrient loading from various rivers, notably the Red. There's only one limnological research vessel on the lake and it's under-funded, so we know very little about what's going on. Knowing that, there might be common occurances of oxygen-limiting situations up there, keeping the biggest walleyes in the south end of the lake, where there is at least a constant, large volume inflow of oxygenated water. Just a theory....."
563689,manitobawalleye,2007-03-01 18:30:00,885,"they do not keep records of commercial fish sizes but i would not be surprised if the odd 20 has been caught thru the years manitoba .... a 100,000 lakes how many walleyes ???? i will never have enough time...."
563717,mcdee,2007-03-04 17:56:00,276,Is Lake Manitoba suffering from algae blooms as well?:confused:
563730,River_eye,2007-03-05 19:03:00,1486,"It is being impacted by nutrient loading as well, but I'm not sure to what degree, and I don't think the experts know to what degree. Algae and nutrient loading occurs naturally because it is a natural process but it is being accelerated by human activity. It just so happens that Agricultural land practices and municipal waste handling practices have the ability to disrupt the natural cycle. Being that Lake Manitoba and Lake Winnipeg are so huge, and being fairly remote lakes (no huge populations depending on the lake) the government was fairly reluctant to put any money into research. Without the longterm data, it's very difficult to determine how much impact humans are having and how much is natural. But.......... if we don't find out soon what's happening, who knows what will happen to greenbacks????"
563739,Guest,2007-03-06 16:21:00,0,I've been told that a domestic fisher has a 41 inch walleye in his freezer. I've tried for a couple of years to get a hold of a photograph of this fish but have been unsuccessful.
