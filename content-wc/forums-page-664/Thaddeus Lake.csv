563231,LeeHawk,2007-02-06 21:04:00,12,"I have been to Thaddeus on two occasions. You will never find a better host than Rocky and his family! The cabins are immaculate, the service is great, the boats are excellent; you are relatively isolated, but safe. Thaddeus is a beautiful lake...not large, but plenty of variety. Walleyes tend to be on weed edges and I have had the best luck trolling with little joe spinners and minnows or crawlers...Rocky will give you the straight scoop. The lake also has big muskie and northern pike if you are willing to work for them. I would go there every year for two weeks, if...I could get to the other two lakes through the creek system. My boat is a little too big and I am no youngster any more (61), so the journey into the next two lakes is tough for me. I talked to a number of people who have been going to Thaddeus every year for a long time and they absolutely love the place...and they catch lots of fish. The price is very reasonable for what you get. Give it a shot!"
563239,Guest,2007-02-07 18:24:00,0,"Thanks for the reply, LeeHawk. By ""the other 2 lakes"", I assume you're referring to Ord and Moose. Is that correct? If we are just using a camp boat, I'm assuming we should have no problem accessing all 3 lakes in the chain? Thanks for any clarification you can provide. Anybody else care to share some feedback as well? Thanks for the help! ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
563244,drlee,2007-02-07 19:55:00,409,"Yes, Moose and Ord. Here is the deal: You move out of Thaddeus through a small creek. You come to a large culvert with a current. Going into the other lakes is not a problem, assuming there is enough water. Coming back, you have to pull the boat through with a rope...hard work for us older guys! Yes, the camp boats are smaller than mine and are easier to handle. However, you will need to check to see if there is enough water to allow passage at all. That has been, as I understand it, a bit of a problem with the drought issues in NW Ontario over the past couple of years. Just for your own peace of mind, I would talk directly to Rocky about it...I know he will be honest with you. Most of all, I don't want to sound negative. I really like Thaddeus, the out of the way feeling, the cabins, the service, etc. Best of Luck!"
563277,Guest,2007-02-08 19:29:00,0,Thanks for all the info Lee. Just pulled the trigger on it today! We're booked for the week of June 30 - July 6. Already counting down the days. Thanks again for the info. John

563347,Guest,2007-02-12 19:18:00,0,Sounds good Rocky. Just dropped the check in the mail last night. You should have it by Tues or Wed. John
563709,Guest,2007-03-03 16:30:00,0,"Also have been there many times (5+) going back to when Rob owned the camp. Very nice lake system and Rocky is a great guy. I've moved around a bit and am currently fishing LOTW for the lakes variety and hopes of a monster muskie. Thaddeus though is a great trophy walleye fishery, in fact I have a 30"" on the wall from there. I have never fished anywhere else with as high an average size on the walleyes. Also have done very well on muskies and pike but I would have to say it is unparalleled for good quantities of big walleyes and depending on the day you can hammer good eaters on Ord. You will not be disappointed...oh and you will not need to worry about tearing the prop of your boat. Good luck!"
