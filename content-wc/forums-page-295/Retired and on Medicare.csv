3512394,maddogg,2015-02-05 17:19:00,178,What do most of you retired guys do so you will have medical coverage while in Canada? From what I understand Medicare will not cover outside of the United States.
3512482,Golden Eagle,2015-02-05 17:52:00,2642,"Check Medicare Supplement, Plan F. I've also purchased Emergency Assistance Plus for my wife and me. It presented to me through NRA. At my age, with some medical history, it seems right for me, in case I ever need an emergency flght to Winnipeg or Thunder Bay."
3514122,JayM5209,2015-02-06 09:17:00,1050,My Medicare Advantage plan covers emergency services needed in Canada. It happens to be the AARP/UnitedHealthCare plan.
3514362,Babamel2,2015-02-06 11:09:00,414,"Medicare does not cover outside of US, However, I enrolled in the F plan and it provides coverage out of US, However, there is a $250 Deductible."
3515714,Downrigger,2015-02-06 17:44:00,60,"Like Jay I also have a Medicare advantage plan through BCBS, which covers medical expenses incurred in Canada. However, I have talked with the hospital in Sioux Lookout to find out what they required. They will not work directly with BCBS and would expect payment from me - either a check or credit card. They would then supply me with detailed records listing cost incurred to share with BCBS for reimbursement. I then spoke with BCBS and they said so long as I would have receipts, reimbursement would not be a problem, subject only to the normal co payments and or deductibles."
3515738,Shellback,2015-02-06 17:51:00,8083,"X-2. If you have supplemental BCBS, you pay the Canadian medical facility out of pocket, then get reimbursed."
