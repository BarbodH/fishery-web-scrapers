3506450,Skyraptor,2015-02-04 02:53:00,291,I just wait and get my Conservation License each time when I arrive at the lodge. They issue it free if you choose the conservation License over the sportsman license.
3506842,retire55,2015-02-04 07:15:00,1029,Thanks for the explanation 3M TA3
3505434,Pooch,2015-02-03 15:54:00,4619,I buy online and print a couple copies. Keep one in a 3x4 ziplock in my tackle box and another in the truck for backup. Works for me and haven't carried a billfold for forty years. Especially in a boat.Three year license makes sense at the current exchange rate.Pooch
3505450,kzoofisher,2015-02-03 15:56:00,5144,I'd be far more inclined to do it if it was part of the outdoors card. One plastic card with all my info on it would be sweet.
3505490,BornToFish,2015-02-03 16:05:00,1224,"My Outdoors Card expired last year. I purchased a three year Sports Fishing license and Outdoor Card about two weeks ago. The total cost was $215.79 US if I remember correctly. The Outdoor Card arrived in today's mail. The back of the card has printed on it ""Sport Fishing 3 Yr, Expiry Dec 31 2017"". I'm told that I do not need to carry the license printed on paper."
3505602,kzoofisher,2015-02-03 16:55:00,5144,"Dern, I had no idea and just renewed my card a couple weeks ago. Would have been well worth it because I need the Ontario license every year for fishing the Detroit. I feel like a fool. Better have a bourbon to perk me up."
3505650,3M TA3,2015-02-03 17:06:00,2846,"Well, I spend 30 to 40 days a year fishing in Ontario, several multi day trips and many 1 or 2 day trips, . If someone is sick or dies, I'll shift my schedule. Also, 2 years ago the exchange was par. At less than 80 cents US to the Canadian Dollar today I'm willing to spend for the 3 years and risk (yikes) that the Canadian Dollar won't crash much further. Your turn. Argue away."
3505682,3M TA3,2015-02-03 17:12:00,2846,Yep. BIL renewed his Outdoor Card last year and the license info was also printed on the card. No need to carry paper.
3505746,3M TA3,2015-02-03 17:30:00,2846,Todays exchange rate 80.65% X (154.96 + 9.68) = $132.78 + 1.33 Credit Card Fee = $134.11 today.
3505778,v-bay gord,2015-02-03 17:38:00,3168,A good illustration of how today's exchange rate can save you money!
3506010,Baxman1958,2015-02-03 18:52:00,14,Kzoo - I sure hope you aren't spoiling that bourbon by adding anything with CO2.
3506050,BornToFish,2015-02-03 19:11:00,1224,You could perk us both up by pouring two fingers tall!! Best wishes.
3503458,3M TA3,2015-02-03 04:43:00,2846,"Just bought mine, including Sportsman's Card, for $134. Additional fee of 1% from Credit Card company but still not a bad price at all IMO. Conservation License."
3504034,retire55,2015-02-03 08:45:00,1029,I'm not sure how you arrived at $134. Here's a copy of Ontario Fishing licence fees for 2015. Sorry I couldn't resolve the formatting issue. Ontario Licence Fees for 2015 Ontario Canadian Non-Canadian Residents Residents Residents Outdoors Card $9.68 $9.68 $9.68 3-Year Sport Fishing Licence Tag $88.38 $165.47 $249.81 3-Year Conservation Licence Tag $50.24 $98.07 $154.96 1-Year Sport Fishing Licence $29.46 $55.16 $83.27 1-Year Conservation Fishing Licence $16.75 $32.69 $51.65 8-Day Sport Fishing Licence Tag N/A N/A $53.54 8-Day Conservation Fishing Licence Tag N/A N/A $30.53
3504154,v-bay gord,2015-02-03 09:12:00,3168,You probably need to factor in the exchange rate...
3504346,tv4fish,2015-02-03 09:59:00,2694,"Maybe it's my ""Minnesota math"", but, I don't see any ""price break"" for the 3 year license??"
3504402,Pikeslayer8,2015-02-03 10:29:00,1460,Thanks for the heads up. Makes a lotta sense to get it while the gettens good.
3504434,Obabikon,2015-02-03 10:37:00,2370,"The price break is that you won't pay the escalating cost. Next year's licenses will cost more. Not a great deal, but people who know they're coming up no matter what... saves them having to get a license every spring."
3504634,CamoHunter,2015-02-03 11:29:00,363,"I really don't think it does make a lot of sense. There is no cost savings, other than a potential increase in license cost.I'd argue that you're better off not buying your license until a day or two before you actually leave for your trip each year. It's so easy, why not?What if an family member unexpectedly passes away or becomes very ill before you leave for a trip one year?Yeah, you're only out the cost of one year of your 3-year license, but why? If you were buying them yearly, you don't have to buy it until right before you leave, and know for sure that you're going."
3504658,tv4fish,2015-02-03 11:33:00,2694,"That's along the lines that I was thinking--- How many of us know ""for sure"" that we would be able to make the trip for all 3 years ?? ""stuff happens"".............."
3504714,northernbite,2015-02-03 12:13:00,1186,Because I go up 3 times a year and I am flexible on dates. If I can't go next week I'll go the following. I like not having to buy every year. paul
3504754,Carnhzkr,2015-02-03 12:17:00,964,"It makes sense to buy a 3-year license to lock in the favorable exchange rate. Of course, it's entirely possible that the Canadian dollar could continue to slide, who knows? So you're taking a chance either way but right now the savings is a little over $10 per year paying in US. That's the financial advantage. Since I keep my fishing licenses in my wallet and I'm a few years overdue to lose a wallet, and it always seems to run through the washing machine a couple times per year, maybe it's a good idea for me to go one year at a time."
