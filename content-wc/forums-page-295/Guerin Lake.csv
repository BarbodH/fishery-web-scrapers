3462338,milford72,2015-01-20 21:30:00,13,Headed to Guerin Lake with MLO the first week of June. Camp is located close to the Attwood River with two other portage lakes also available. Any reports on Brook Trout and of course walleyes would be appreciated. Thanks

I have used Don for roughly 15 trips or so and have never had a bad trip. His camps and equipment are always top notch and the fishing is always fantastic. We usually bring in a few dozen minnows to start as it just seems easier to locate the fish with live bait. By the 2nd or 3rd day we are on 3"" grubs with 1/4 ounce jigs and kill the fish. If you haven't used MLO before you won't be disappointed."
3477418,Mike Borger,2015-01-25 11:35:00,1554,I'll echo the previous comments on MLO as a top notch outfitter.Regarding Guerin I paddled through it a number of years back and caught some nice brook trout in between Guerin and Peninsular lake. No trout upstream towards Hurst. My guess is if you're willing to do some serious bushwhacking and hiking you could catch some trout downstream from Guerin.
