3521954,NY Walleye,2015-02-08 15:37:00,78,I know the meaning. Just trying to figure out why the post. Sounds like you don't know the difference between a quality rod and attempt to show off.
3526410,Gipper,2015-02-09 21:07:00,76,"OK. I get it. I own a couple of of St Croix Musky Premiers and one XXXed out walleye rod from the store in Park Falls. They are good. I also bought a Gander Mt 6' walleye rod for a guy that flys in every year from CA for a Canada trip. 20 bucks on sale and he loves it 6 years running. Of course I bought it. But I would not have bought it if it didn't have that feel, if you know what I mean. ****, St Croix may have built it. If they don't break, can you really feel the $150 difference in a graphite walleye rod? Musky may be another story."
3526962,Guest,2015-02-10 07:05:00,0,In terms of feeling $150 worth of graphite. To me the answer is yes. My primary trip is a fly out from Red Lake in early June. The bite tends to be VERY light. The fish are so tentative a lot of times we are moving so slow it is almost 'dead sticking'. It is scenario where the bite is VERY light and the fish are not very aggressive I think the best rod you can afford will make a difference. B-
3515858,Jtmwalleye,2015-02-06 18:12:00,16,A bit pricey but would love to hear any reviews on the st. Croix legend extreme mh 7 foot rod for pike. I recognize the feel is particular to each person but I have a st croix premier 7 foot rod...1/2 oz to 1.5 oz range. Is there much difference between the two? No store in my area carries the extreme so I can't compare first hand. Any info appreciated.
3516098,Fisherman Ted,2015-02-06 18:54:00,461,"I have several of them and they are incredible rods. I can directly compare them as the rods I give guests are Premier rods but I personally have the extreme which is definitely nicer. I can feel the difference with jigs in terms of sensitivity. Its a very sensitive rod with great backbone, you will not be disappointed. -FT"
3516202,zeebee,2015-02-06 19:04:00,1144,"Legend is a great rod however the Premier is no slouch. If you didnt already own the latter and, the Legend was within budget Id say go for it. Given that you already have the Premier in a MH/H action, Im not sure the Legend would offer that much in terms of added versatility."
3516306,Jtmwalleye,2015-02-06 19:24:00,16,Appreciate the insight. I doubt the pike will know the difference but I will...going to take the plunge! Life too short. Thx again.
3516498,bthomas3333,2015-02-06 19:54:00,465,"I fish the Legend Extreme in M XF for Walleye. Best walleye rod I have ever used. In the past the only MH freshwater was in the AVID line. I own the MH Avid in 6'6"". I will say with fire line and a fish under 5# it is over kill. The rod is barely bending. The rod would probably be more appropriate for fish closer to 10#. The other thing is casting the MH for Northerns hundreds of times is a bit more work. You need to snap the tip when casting stuff ~1oz pretty good. Not really a problem but be aware that long term casting a bit more work than a M. St Croix equipment is FAR and away the best rods I have ever used. You won't be disappointed. Brett"
3519074,BornToFish,2015-02-07 16:54:00,1224,"I've been using for many years a St. Croix Legend Elite seven foot MH casting rod for pike fishing. It's a pike slaying machine when paired with 50 pound braid, a wire leader and a one ounce Daredevle. I liked it so much that I bought an identical rod, just to have as a backup. Both rods have full cork grips. I eventually bought a split grip musky rod, even though I was a bit skeptical as I always had full cork grips on my rods. I love the split grip! It's a dream to cast as my hands are always in the right place. You won't go wrong with the Legend rod in split grip. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3519330,Mike Borger,2015-02-07 18:17:00,1554,"Have a bunch of different Legend Elite rods and like them a lot. I'm not a fan of the space age look of the Legend XTreme but a lot of people are. Among them I have a 7' M/H baitcaster and personally find the rear grip is too short for my liking when casting for pike.Was just looking for a suitable alternative and absolutely love the new Legend Tournament Bass rods. I looked at a 71/2' m/h version the other day and I'm pretty sure that'll be the one for me. The rear grip is a good 2"" longer than my current Legend Elite and the rod just feels right in my hand."
3519346,NY Walleye,2015-02-07 18:25:00,78,I have a Eycon 7ft medium action rod that is nice. Also bought a lLegend Tournament 7ft that medium action that I absolutely love. Both rods are two piece for fly in trips. Always bring the best rods if you are going to spend a good amount of money on a trip. St Criox will also engrave your name in the rods. Pretty cool.
