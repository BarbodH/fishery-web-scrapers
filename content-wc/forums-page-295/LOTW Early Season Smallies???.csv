3509242,bassnblast,2015-02-04 19:11:00,56,Is there a certain part of LOTW that is considered the best for early season smallmouth fishing? Considering a trip this June. Thanks!
3509410,ftfarms,2015-02-04 19:59:00,444,"Not sure if it's the best but 1st week in june 2014 smallmouth fishing in miles bay was stupid good. We caught several 16-191/2"" smallmouth and really didn't fish for them. If I remember it was over 400. We probly caught another 50-60 that was under 16"". Last year the first week in june the weather was cold and rainy."
3509898,Thompmd,2015-02-05 06:07:00,320,"I have fished Sabaskong Bay in June for several year(we went for a week sometimes the 1st week of June until the last week in June) and its simply boils down to water temps in regards to where you find the smallmouth relating to their spawn. We went to specifically targeting smallmouth but fished for about everything. Anytime you found broken rock there were always some smallmouths around it. Another reason we chose Sabaskong Bay is so that we could trailer our boat over to Kakagi(Crow) for a day. It is crystal clear and a blast to fish for smallmouth/muskie. In regards to baits we fished the conditions meaning if we had wind along a shore they liked spinnerbaits, calm water we always had topwater baits tied on and you could always catch someon crankbaits,rattletraps,etc. We didn't fool much w/tubes as they were difficult to deal with in the rocks. If you want more specifics just let me know. Good Luck"
