3503154,nicko,2015-02-02 20:28:00,508,"Appreciate the info. We never fish minnows, just leeches and crawlers and we buy them up there ahead of time. We may get the pass just not to have to call every day. Thanks...n"

3530074,Flag Island,2015-02-10 20:08:00,32,"I have a cabin on Flag Island. We do have the remote area border crossing permits. This allows us to go back and forth into Canada without calling in. When we have friends we just call from our dock, 1800can-pass. Takes 5 minutes and not a big deal. We fish a lot with dead salted minnows and do very well. Many 100+ fish days. Yes the gravel road can get wash boarded after some rain but it's 22 miles and they do try to stay on top of it. There is a county patrol operator living at the Angle who takes great pride in the road. It takes us 30-45 minutes to get up to Wiley's. It's a pretty boat ride but we normally only fish a few miles from Flag. The resorts are all trying to keep there guests on fish and will be very helpful. I would tell you the best thing to do is give it a try, check out the area around the angle and I believe you will be happy."
3439650,WallyNut,2015-01-12 16:25:00,79,"We only call once a day. For fishing license there is a mixture in our group. The limit on walleye is two for the conservation license, which I normally purchase, believe it's a 7 day. A few of the guys have the regular non-Canadian. I believe it has a 4 walleye limit. Just don't exceed you total limit for your boat. A fish eaten counts against the limit. If your going to fish Minnesota waters you need that license also. Most of the Minnesota fishing is in open water, not much to hide behind. Any wind from the east around to the south or southwest will pretty much end that. I have seen sites on shore where people have stopped. Rock fire rings, but I don't know all the rules of crown land. We take out sandwiches and have a fish fry once we get back. Happy to answer what I can."
3439658,kayakmatt,2015-01-12 16:27:00,105,"Wiley is crazy expensive.Has anyone been to Big Narrows Resort? I'm looking into going there. Their website is severely lacking info, but their rates look very reasonable...especially for bringing your own boat. Their prices do not include boat fuel and transportation to the lodge, so your own boat would save these expenses.I'm basically looking for the same info as you for the west side of LOTW."
3439794,nicko,2015-01-12 17:10:00,508,"I've been by it...never been in it, but it seemed a bit dated and rustic.....seems there is high end and low end, but nothing inbetween. Wiley is very nice, but it's expensive and I never feel like I get my money's worth. I fish 12+ hours a day. I'm never there but for sleeping, and my meals....otherwise I'm on the water from sun up till 10 pm.... Like I said it's nice, but expensive. Big narrows would be great, but it's a bit rougher.... I love that part of the lake though.... N"
3441226,nicko,2015-01-13 07:40:00,508,"Perfect. I talked to Dave at Sunset lodge yesterday. We had a lengthy conversation on the rules. Seems that some have blown them out of proportion a bit. Guests call in once a day as you said, right from his dock. No need to call in multiple times, no need to call in to US coming back and no real issues other than the same rules we all abide by for limits. Seems pretty straightforward. How are the roads getting to the angle? Do I need to get my gravel guard out or is it ok? How do you find the area for car and boat traffic? Thanks....n"
3441378,WallyNut,2015-01-13 08:27:00,79,"You will be driving gravel about the last 20-25 miles. Depending on when it was last graded, it can get to be a washboard in places. I'd get some type of gravel guard. There is parking at the launch, not sure of the cost. Vehicle traffic is minimal. Just enough boat traffic to know you won't be stranded all day if you need help.The whole call in process is pretty straight forward. Once I got it in my head that I really was going from one country to another it made sense.You'll enjoy it. It's one of my favorite areas."
3441578,nicko,2015-01-13 09:26:00,508,Very Good....Thanks for the info....Dave also told me we could get a CANPASS and not have to call every day. $30 ea. Most people just call. I will get my gravel guard out. haven't used it yet. I love that are of the lake....we've spent the last 4 years running around the northern section of Big Narrows....now its time to try the southern. Thanks for all your insight...... N
3447162,nicko,2015-01-15 08:43:00,508,Changing the subject slightly.....anyone have any general areas they concentrate on in the southwest area? Thanks..N

I would always get the pass from now on. If I was fishin for walleyes, I would not like not being able to take live minnows across the border."
3437858,ftfarms,2015-01-12 05:55:00,444,Not sure what your looking for but we stay in milesbay on lotws. If your looking at American plan you got Grassy narrows. Wayne's a good guy. And not to far away you got obabikon bay with Jared. Jared's a great guy. We are staying at milesbay camp this year. Matt's a great guy. It's a little more rustic than some but a real nice. They are all boat to camps out of morson.
3438450,nicko,2015-01-12 09:15:00,508,"We like american plan. Yes, I have looked at those and spoke to Jared at Obabikon this past weekend at the All-Canada Show. I may look into that part of the lake, but I prefer the West side. Less traffic. I may have to give it up due to the ridiculous regulation of checking in every single day. Wiley Point was excellent, but pricing has gotten way out of hand. With the exchange rate back to where it was and Oil down to $50 a barrel US, prices shouldn't have gone up 30% US. If I cant find a way, I may just stick to home and fish south this summer. Hate to, but just cant justify the $$$. N"
3438514,WallyNut,2015-01-12 09:57:00,79,"My group usually stays at Young's Bay Resort and do the daily call in routine. Really not an issue as we use one designated caller per boat. All that is needed is the boat registration number, the first middle and last names of the passengers with their birthdate. After the first call in it's much speedier process, as they have the information they need. Usually just a couple of routine questions, live bait, alcohol, tobacco, etc.We do spend a good share of our time in Monument, and Bishop Bays, with excellent results. There is a boat in resort on Monument Bay called Frolander's. I can't give you any references but have stopped there for assistance. This would eliminate the daily crossing routine.Here's the link:http://www.frolanderresort.com/Hope it helps."
3438650,Fisherman Ted,2015-01-12 10:39:00,461,"Quick comment about rates. Nearly every lodge I know of, including myself sets rate up to a year in advance. Sure, oil has dropped but only over the past few months. Last June when people were booking for 2015 the exchange rate was still pretty bad and oil was quite expensive. We also need to put major orders for boats, docks and other capital expenses in many months ahead of time. The current price of oil has nothing to do with rates we set a year ago. Tough to manage a business where people want to lock in a rate a year (and sometimes 2) ahead of time when expenses and exchange rates can be so dynamic. -FT"
3438706,nicko,2015-01-12 11:01:00,508,"Oh understand fully......$380 US per day for me in my boat fishing 12 hours+ per day and just sleeping in a cabin is a bit steep for our blood now. Its nice, but not that nice. I don't get to take advantage of many of the ""Amenities"" as I am fishing. Not that those amenities are that important (work out rooms, 2 huge bars, sauna etc etc). I am on a fishing trip. I can go to a spa at home. I understand the costs and some is out of your direct control (generators, remoteness and all the issues with that) but its still steep.... There are lots of ways to cut costs, to keep people coming. They're just not real good at it. Just need to keep looking....thanks..."
3438714,nicko,2015-01-12 11:07:00,508,Thanks for this......How big of a deal is it to make that call? where do you do it from? How big a deal is the bait issue? We usually have crawlers and leeches. We always get them up there and they are in bedding not dirt. Is that an issue? The crawlers come from Canada. Is the issue strictly with bedding? Do you need to check in on the way back? what if you go back and forth several times a day running from spot to spot? Do you need the CANPASS and RABC? I will have a look at Frolanders...there website is a bit lacking...may email them.... Anyone been there? Thx...N
3439186,WallyNut,2015-01-12 14:01:00,79,"There is a dedicated phone in a booth located at the launch at Young's Bay Resort. It's not a big deal at all to call in. Usually the guy running the boat calls in while his passengers are getting the day's needs together, packing the bait, making sandwiches. I typically call first thing in the morning, it just has to be done before you leave. I keep a slip with me with everyone's full names and birth dates. Make sure it's their given name, don't use Randy for Randall, Sue for Susan. They get pretty picky sometimes. Make sure you have the hull number. After the first time, typically there are fewer questions. Normally the hull number an names of the passengers.When it comes to bait, minnows must not be alive. When we buy them from Young's Bay, he puts them in a bag and poor a little soda on them. Worms need to be in bedding and not dirt.The way I remember who to call is by which country you are coming into. After you stop at the Canadian Border stop, you need to call US Customs when you enter back into Minnesota. I normally call from Jim's Corner. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest Otherwise you can also call from Young's Bay. Just a button to push on the phone. Then it is just a matter of phoning in each day for the trip into Canada. When you're leaving to go back to the US to return home, don't forget to call Canadian Customs and notify them you are returning to US through Canada. Pretty hefty fine for forgetting that part. If you decided to stay at Young's Bay Resort, there is a nice restaurant/bar next to the launch for meals."
3439386,nicko,2015-01-12 15:18:00,508,"Thanks for the info.... A couple more questions if you don't mind. I am looking at staying on oak or flag island. If I cross into Canada I need to call canadien customs....I hear they have phones on those islands as well as cyclone island. If i cross into Canada and go back and forth between Canada and us all day, do I need to call each time or can I just call once...? Crawlers are always in bedding for us....no beer..... Can you tell me what licenses I go by? Issue I need both correct? We don't keep fish, we eat shore lunch every day and bring none home...is that doable up there? Thx...n"
3439506,bellbuoy,2015-01-12 15:41:00,490,"Have you checked Witch Bay? Not much traffic in that area of the lake. Steve and Gail are nice people, much cheaper than the price you quoted at Wiley."
3439530,nicko,2015-01-12 15:43:00,508,They are on my list.....they along with Obabikon and duck bay.... Thanks...and yes they are much cheaper than my original lodge....
3437266,nicko,2015-01-11 18:32:00,508,"Hey guys, We are looking at moving lodges this year. We had previously been to several areas of LOTW from Sioux Narrows, Snake Bay to yellow girl and over near Crow Rock and Totems wiley point. We've gotten some sticker shock this last go around and won't be going back. We are looking at oak and flag island resorts....flag island resort and sunset lodge as well as others. Has anyone been to any of these recently? Last year at Wiley Point despite high water, the fishing was stellar. We had multiple 100 fish days. We bring our own boat and typically like American plan as we usually fish 10-12 hours per day. How's the area? We target walleye in the morning and SM, like and muskie in the afternoon. What can we expect, has anyone fished north and west of this area through big narrows? How about French portage and near Coste island? We prefer to use bouncers and throw cranks to jigging. Thanks....Nick"

3437474,nicko,2015-01-11 19:36:00,508,"Interesting article, but what am I looking for here? One of my big questions is how people fish both waters? We typically do not bring walleye home, we catch shore lunch every day and eat what we catch. I can catch plenty of walleye in Wisconsin and Erie to bring home. Is this a problem being in this area? N"
3437490,Guest,2015-01-11 19:38:00,0,"If you stay there you need to clear customs twice a day - morning and evening, assuming you do not go back to camp for lunch or a nap. Can't take live bait into Ontario either. Some times live bait - like leeches can make all the difference. Might be a cheaper way to fish Ontario but sounds like a royal pain to me."
3437506,nicko,2015-01-11 19:41:00,508,"Let me understand this.....if I cross into canadien side to fish, with a valid canadien license, I need to go clear customs twice a day? Where? They have some island border crossing? N"
3437514,h8go4s,2015-01-11 19:49:00,1673,Get a CANPASS remote area border crossing permit.http://cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/prog/canpass/.../menu-eng.html
3437530,Guest,2015-01-11 19:55:00,0,"Yup you do. On the Canadian side there is a CBSA building on Cyclone Island. US customs has a phone set up at Youngs Bay. You call in when you have all of your supporting documents ready. Like I said, a pain. Most of the guys who spend time there get a RABC (CANPASS) to ease the pain."
3437562,nicko,2015-01-11 20:19:00,508,"That sounds like the most idiotic half *** setup you can imagine. You mean to tell me the boats from lodges on oak and flag islands go to cyclone and to youngs bay every single day to check in? I thought both governments were dumb, but how dumb can you get. Funny, there is no mention of this on any websites. They just mention having a valid Ontario license.... Do you have any sites to research this? Thx. N"
3437610,Nimstug,2015-01-11 20:42:00,2605,I suspect they use Canpass to avoid the trips. Crossing the border is crossing the border.
3437666,nicko,2015-01-11 21:25:00,508,Ok now. Now with CANPASS do I need to worry about going back and forth to a border agent or can I go back and forth without worry about getting pulled out of my boat and searched. Can I do that? Thx...n
