3515170,maddogg,2015-02-06 15:03:00,178,Surely the lodge had another motor or another boat and motor to use.
3515210,SinOrSwim,2015-02-06 15:15:00,1528,"It is sad for all involved. But, I know I have been to Canada many times over the years and I had a tiller that didn't tighten up. To the point I had to keep my hand on the tiller even while back trolling. It is too bad all of them are having to deal with this. I can almost guarantee any one of us, had we been told the tiller was loose, would have given the guide the go ahead to take us out."
3515778,Shellback,2015-02-06 18:00:00,8083,"I'm thinking it had to be more than a loose friction lock. That's something any tiller operator can be aware of, and know not to let go of the handle. I was assuming something coming apart or breaking in such a way that it left the tiller handle jammed."
3516778,roscoe33,2015-02-06 23:06:00,653,"I agree, think it was more than the friction adjustment. The ""planing and porpoising"" comment makes no sense to me either. Sounds like a throttle issue as well. Perhaps the tiller started to fall of, causing handling and throttle issues."
3522306,fsz,2015-02-08 17:20:00,144,"It is not lost on me what the surviving guide is going through physically or emotionally. But everything I see in the attached link points to some form of responsibility or guilt to this guide (negligence) as well as the resort owner (recklessness or worse). It seems that the attitude was since he was injured severely himself, it was dropped. In the States, a case like this would end up with a finding of guilt first, and THEN the mitigating factors would justify a lenient sentence. Our guys get an OVI and can't come into Canada because they are felons. Have one open can of beer in a boat and you get written up. I'm a guest when I go to Canada and I will respect their laws, but stuff like this leaves me scratching my head."
3522530,v-bay gord,2015-02-08 18:39:00,3168,It's not as easy to sue in Canada as it is in the US. Hopefully no lawyer will profit from this tragedy. If it happened south of the border the vultures would be circling.
3522666,Blades-n-Beads,2015-02-08 19:46:00,484,It was more than just a tensioning arm that was loose. There is no way a guide with 40 years exsperiance just let go of the tiller handle under power to cause this or just a weak tensioning arm. By the reports and exstent of damage and injury it sure sounds like the entire handle come off leaving the seasoned guide absolutely no control of throttle and steering. Terrible tragedy. Something he will live with the rest of his life. My condolences to the family's of the lost fishermen.
3522690,38bill,2015-02-08 20:00:00,331,I always thought that it was the boat captain/operator that was responsible for making sure the boat is sea worthy and safe. Much like that a pilot is the guy responsible to make sure that the aircraft is safe before a flight.

3514506,Juls,2015-02-06 12:05:00,13414,Truly sad for all involved. I'm glad to see they are taking the resort owner to court over this though. He should have never sent anyone out in that boat until the tiller was properly fixed. My thoughts go out to the families and friends of the deceased men. I'm sure it's been an agonizing two years for all of them.
3514554,tv4fish,2015-02-06 12:06:00,2694,"OK: I read the article and I agree with the decision - BUT:Why didn't Greene do something about the ""loose handle"" himself????????????Quote: Ash Rapids Camp owner Thomas Quinton is scheduled to enter a plea on provincial charges in Kenora Court on March 25. Do we presume that he will be charged with negligence?"
3514570,Juls,2015-02-06 12:09:00,13414,"Are we going to start arm chair quarterbacking the Judge's seat now? You don't know what the circumstances were. Maybe it didn't seem that bad at the time he reported it...maybe he didn't have the tools...maybe...maybe...maybe...woulda, coulda, shoulda... I'm sure he struggles with that thought himself."
3514690,tv4fish,2015-02-06 12:33:00,2694,"Not at all. But, I kind of compare it to this situation - If I was a guide for a camp and I was told to take clients out in a boat and I saw that the boat had a hole in the bottom of it and was leaking -- I think I either would fix the leak myself or not take the boat out."
3514714,v-bay gord,2015-02-06 12:43:00,3168,"I know of two other cases that involved fatalities with similar circumstances.....letting go of the handle on 50 hp outboards. Both were at lodges. There is a steering adjustment that can become loose and requires a bolt to be tightened. The torque of the engine, especially when getting on plane, will result in loss of control if it was loose (not sure if I would let go even if it was tight!). All newer engines have a tether strap that should be attached to the drivers steering arm to prevent just such accident results from occurring. The bottom line is if you are renting a similar boat be aware of the steering adjustment (make sure you can tighten the steering) and the knowledge of the trouble you can get yourself into letting go of the handle. Consider using the tether strap......and of course a pfd. Ending your vacation in this manner is tragic."
3514954,LOW1,2015-02-06 14:03:00,2828,"I don't know what to think. A lifetime of prudence and care can be lost in a few seconds with one poor decision. Who of us can say that they are incapable of the same action? Should people be brought to justice? Should they be forgiven? Is there a difference in this case? With lives irreversibly lost and ruined, perhaps forgiveness, recognizing that there but for the Creator go we all, and moving on as best possible and with compassion to all is the best course to set. . ."
3514962,tv4fish,2015-02-06 14:06:00,2694,"I don't know -------- The saying that keeps coming to my mind is -- ""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure""............"
3515114,Shellback,2015-02-06 14:49:00,8083,"Tragic accident for sure. Unfortunately employees in many professions are instructed to go ahead and do their job even after they have voiced safety concerns. Lives have been lost, and will continue to be lost. If the guide refused to take the boat out until it was repaired, those 2 men would be alive today. The use of a stop lanyard alone would have most likely prevented the accident. To rule that he had no responsibility doesn't send the right message out to prevent future tragedies. I'm sure he has been punished physically and mentally enough since the accident, and doesn't deserve anymore, but a guilty verdict might make the next fellow think twice about being directed to take out an unsafe boat."
3515138,Obabikon,2015-02-06 14:57:00,2370,"This is very scary and sad. Resorts have better insurance than guides do. I hope, while it will never bring their loved ones back, that the family is taken care of. Whether or not the equipment was bad... its a huge reminder to hold onto the tiller at all times! I also hope the owners at Ash Rapids are incorporated and have kept their books up. That could prevent them losing everything they own if they are deemed liable. I'm sure this a nightmare for them too. It sounds as if they're being given the blame. Those tension bolts do come loose, but even if they are, don't let go of the tiller. It's a horrible situation for everyone involved."
