3507106,tolsen,2015-02-04 08:09:00,126,Maybe........
3507394,camp chef,2015-02-04 10:12:00,915,I caught and released a 45 inch Muskie in that bay 3 years ago.
3480082,IaDave,2015-01-26 08:50:00,476,It has probably been 7 years since I have been there and at that time they were full time residents. I have fished Minnitaki in Sept probably 10 times since 2000 and we have never felt like we had to run all the way to Red Pine way too many productive spots closer. It may be a go to spot earlier in the season.
3480866,camp chef,2015-01-26 12:07:00,915,I a m not sure if you are asking about Big North Lodge on the Winnipeg river in Minaki or a different Lodge in Minnitaki. If you want info on Big North let me know I have been there 5 times
3481122,ftfarms,2015-01-26 13:23:00,444,He's talking about north of kenora on the Winnipeg same as you;but others are trying to confuse the rest of us talking about minnitaki Over at Sioux lookout.
3481338,camp chef,2015-01-26 14:24:00,915,"Well In that case........I highly recommend Big North. Great people, great facilities and great water.They have nice boats if you find your 10 hp to be too small.One of the things I like about Big North is the amount of current fishing that is available. Great Walleye, Small mouth , Northern and big Muskies. I will fish there again."
3483154,Guest,2015-01-27 04:54:00,0,thanks guys for posting with all the help on big northern camp probably do this as our 3rd trip 1s week of july jim wolf chicago boys
3484906,Aaron-IN,2015-01-27 14:49:00,500,"10hp motor would be okay for Gun Lake (Big North is located on), if you would want to go up or down the River, up to Roughrock, little Sand, Big Sand you will be spending a lot of time getting there and back."
3486474,Bakefish,2015-01-28 06:51:00,1077,"What he said. I've been there 3 times. The camp and its' owners are great. They'll take good care of you. However, the lake chain is a little too populated for my taste when I'm in Canada. I'm not talking fishermen, I'm talking private cabins. They seem to be everywhere. Fishing is not too bad, but I've had better. If you plan to go to the other side by Big Sand, then you will be in for a long commute with a 10 hp."
3502570,tolsen,2015-02-02 17:29:00,126,We have a place about 2 miles down fromBig North Lodge and I can tell you those two miles trophy fish are all around the resort there.you should be fine. If you want to wonder further have Alex and Pat hook you up with a rental a couple days.
3506178,Guest,2015-02-03 20:46:00,0,dear sir are there any private cabins in the area for rent to your knowledge jim wolf Chicago boys
3506210,tolsen,2015-02-03 21:03:00,126,We do not currently rent out our cabin as we are in the process of updating it. If you have fished in that area I am sure you have came across is before. It's on the island as you head towards the throat Rapids and Big North Lodge Side of them. There is a cabin on both sides of the river there on islands and one is ours. I'll let you know if it changes though. Love being up there.
3476162,Guest,2015-01-25 04:53:00,0,we plan on a possible 3rd trip to Canada this year has anyone stayed at this lodge going mid to late sept;plan on housekeeping and bring our own boat with new 10 hp electric start (has nice speed) can we fish most lakes on decent days with this rig?? $500/week housekeeping nice price fish 65% walleyes and 35% northerns mainly trolling and jigging appreciate any information or experiences jim wolf Chicago boys thanks as always
3476442,Mara5,2015-01-25 07:41:00,209,"All the years we went to Minitaki we stayed at Pickeral Arm camp. Have no experience at the camp you mentioned. Minitaki is a large lake, and when the wind blows it gets very rough out in the central part, and wherever it can hit ya. I certainly would not want to be on it in a small boat. However, there numerous islands, coves, etc. to get out of wind. That time it will probably be quite cool so clothes will be important. Have only been there in June, and two years it snowed.HTH"
3476754,IaDave,2015-01-25 09:09:00,476,I think this may actually be Minaki not Minnitaki. If you are looking for a reasonably priced place that you can fish Minnitaki check out Timber Edge Camp.
3476786,ftfarms,2015-01-25 09:17:00,444,A couple lakes big sand and rough rock lakes will be a little trip with a little ten hourse. But if your used to running that slow probly be fine. Fishing is good in that area.
3479505,Guest,2015-01-26 04:29:00,0,dave you are correct big northern lodge is in mintaki about 40 miles north of kenora price is good and being able to fish 5 connecting lakes is a plus this 10 hp probably runs like an old 15 hp we will not venture out far on windy stormy days safety always first I checked out timber edge lodge and it also looks good with our boat also a muskie sanctuary across the street the owner stated; have you fished it worth the trip jim wolf Chicago boys with exchange rate 20% are favor and gas around $2 this is the year to try 3 trips jim wolf thanks for all your help as usual
3479722,Shotgun,2015-01-26 07:00:00,759,"Wolf1931, keep in mind that lots of resorts/lodges/camps rates are in US dollars, which gives you no $$$ advantage on exchange rates. Fuel is a plus and other incidentals if purchased in Canada may have an advantage. As for Timber Edge Camp, have fished it many times and there are numerous bays you can fish in windy weather, would be good for a small boat. However, running to other areas of the lake, i.e., Red Pine Bay about 15 miles, would be a rough ride back if the wind picked up in a small boat. Cabins are clean and owners are good people. Fishing has been decent. Enjoy!"
3479770,IaDave,2015-01-26 07:09:00,476,"My 2 trips to Timber Edge were in the fall and we had no reason to run to Red Pine Bay. We stayed within 3 miles of the camp and fished Lyons & Troutfish Bay. On calmer days we did head out into the main lake and fished sum of the humps. We did not go the lake to try for Musky's as we are mainly Walleye guys. Kevin and his wife run a good camp- they are full time residents so unlike some places where you go late in the season where they make you feel like they can't wait till you leave so they can head back to states, they make you feel like you are their first guests of the season."
3479786,Shotgun,2015-01-26 07:24:00,759,"Unless they have changed their winter residence in the last year, they have always wintered in the states as I've sent my deposit to the US address. As for Red Pine Bay, in the multiple years I've fished the area, it has produced the best walleye fishing. Red Pine is a sanctuary that can only be fished certain times of the year. Not saying you can't catch fish other places, just passing on my experiences. Good people, good fishing and camp."
3479810,sloughboy,2015-01-26 07:27:00,13,"Big Norths service and facilities are excellent. I would consider utilizing one of there boats. I have never fished any of the water that you have access to from the lodge. I have only stayed overnight before flying into one of their outposts. From the guests I talked to over a couple of meals, the fishing sounded very good."
3479882,ftfarms,2015-01-26 07:48:00,444,Late sept fishing on the river is usually real real good for bigger fish. and if I remember right that time of year you don't need to run up to big sand and rough rock like you do in the warmer months. But I liked rough rock lake area when we fished there.
