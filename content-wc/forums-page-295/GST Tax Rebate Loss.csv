3517186,Andyeye,2015-02-07 07:13:00,179,I got my rebate check on our GST tax rebate from our stay in Canada last year. I cashed the check for a $114.40 and put it away towards our groceries for next years trip. I got a letter from the bank a week later telling me my checking account was charged $24.00 for the currency exchange from US to Canadian dollars. It is no big deal I just wasn't paying attention to the currency exchange rate since it had been pretty close for some time now. Maybe I should have taken care of it sooner. I don't know when the Canadian dollar went down against the US dollar I will keep better tabs on this procedure. Anybody else have this happen to them?
3517242,Gregking,2015-02-07 07:31:00,2658,Are you saying the bank gave you $1 to $1? Or was this $24 a bank fee for running the check?
3517266,Obabikon,2015-02-07 07:36:00,2370,The exchange rate is running around .80 cents on the dollar going from Candian to US.
3517330,Andyeye,2015-02-07 07:44:00,179,I cashed the check at a small town US Bank office at the driveup window. The teller gave me the amount on the check. I guess when the bank ran the check and got the .80 cents on the dollar they sent me a debit notice on my account to make up for the exchange rate loss my bank incurred.
3519066,NMG,2015-02-07 16:53:00,1053,"Sounds right. The cheque would have been issued in Canadian funds so yeah, that $24 would be the difference based on current rates. I think it's actually good that they didn't charge you extra as a ""service fee"" to accept it, LOL."
3519690,@Lunker,2015-02-07 20:51:00,835,"I got a relatively small rebate check. My bank said there would be a $20 - $25 service fee to cash it for me IF the home office allowed them to do it at all. (Apparently, the ladies at the branch bank didn't have to deal with this sort of thing very often.) I intend to bring the uncashed check back to Canada with me this summer and sign it over to the camp to be put into the tip pool."
3520482,55walleyes,2015-02-08 08:24:00,131,Using it for tip is good idea. I have been cashing it at Border Bob's when returning the following year. He treated me a lot better than my local bank did. Bank really gouged me. I do think I will sign it over to lodge as tip.
