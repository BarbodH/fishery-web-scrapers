3476234,NY Walleye,2015-01-25 06:14:00,78,Fished with Air Tamarac on hebert several times. Looking to make a short trip this year and would like to try the Gouin. Looked at the new website which shows camp locations. Where or what camp would you pick for walleye fishing in the Gouin?

Seemed like we picked up fish on every point and drop off and more variety of structure. When we fished Plamondon Bay, the water level was WAY DOWN. In fact, there was barely enough water to land the plane. We had to run farther at Plamondon to find fish. I'm interested in hearing how others liked East / West Saraana Bay for fishing."

A north wind can make getting to a lot of spots rough. We fish down by Sarana East and do pretty good down that way too. Plamondon was also good to us and you could get out of the wind, but still fish in some big water with the right weather. Mattawa bay was not our best trip, but nobody caught fish that week. I believe all the cabins are new now, so accomodations are nice."
