3522194,SinOrSwim,2015-02-08 16:48:00,1528,"We stay at the AmericInn in Virginia as well. Nice having the Saw Mill rest/bar in the same parking lot. If you want a nicer hotel in Virginia, the Holiday Inn Express about a mile from teh Saw Mill is brand new and very nice. Good breakfast too. Never stayed in I Falls but the hotels/motels up there look to be much more dated. Its about 2 hours to the border from Virginia"
3522522,Glenman12,2015-02-08 18:37:00,762,Already booked AmericInn for this year but will keep the HIE in mind for next year...is their breakfast free?
3522658,SinOrSwim,2015-02-08 19:43:00,1528,Yes. It is free. They are similar breakfasts so not a big deal. Also if you haven't already call and ask for the street view/parking lot view at the AmericInn. The back of the hotel has train tracks literally out the window. They have complimentary ear plugs on the night stand. That is why I staed at the HIE with my son. But with our big group we didn't want to have to drive to get something to eat and drink. Pulling trailer etc alogn with the older crowd would want to leave much earlier than the younger crowd so the AmericInn was perfect.
3522786,Glenman12,2015-02-08 20:20:00,762,our youngest last year was mid 30's so after a few hours at the Sawmill and a few buckets of beer at the tiny bar at the motel we didnt hear too much..
3517474,Gone,2015-02-07 08:18:00,9,"Headed to drydon area in June. Looking for a place to stay the night on the way up for 1 night. Thinking aout staying in Virginia mn or going on up to International Falls. Don't need anything special. Just something clean, cheap and place to get a good meal/beer before hitting the sack. Any suggestions?"
3517498,dutchboy,2015-02-07 08:22:00,5717,"Lots of places in International Falls. Falls Motel Hilltop motel Both would fit the bill for you. The ""Spot on 53"" is a good place for a beer and something to eat. If going on Friday get reservations for a motel room early. The whole town fills up at times."
3517562,pjshorthorn,2015-02-07 08:36:00,5654,"Super 8 is decent. Shorelunch Caf√© is good . If you to experience some local ""atmosphere"", the Border Bar is quite a ""joint"" with decent pizza. PjShorthorn."
3517634,IaDave,2015-02-07 08:48:00,476,The Border Bar is great and the one time I had breakfast at the Shorelunch it was very good.
3517658,tlars,2015-02-07 08:50:00,137,"North Country Inn, Orr. Clean with good boat parking and good wifi"
3517690,dutchboy,2015-02-07 08:56:00,5717,Very nice place for sure. May want to call ahead for pricing. Last time I stayed there it was spendy. But that was before the currant owner bought it.
3517698,dutchboy,2015-02-07 08:57:00,5717,"Crap, my bad! I was thinking of the big place going North out of town. I'll bet you were talking about the motel right in town. That is nice for the money."
3518130,wallydave,2015-02-07 11:08:00,2151,"I like to cross the border on Friday night, less traffic, very little wait time compared to Saturday. Try the Rainbow Motel in Fort Frances, ask Gord for the remodeled room. Boston Pizza for dinner and Tim Hortons for breakfast."
3518450,Pooch,2015-02-07 12:34:00,4619,"If you are wanting to stay in or near IF, better get your reservations in soon. Trust me on that one!We now like to get over the border and spend the night in Fort Francis. There are a couple chain motels in FF.Pooch"
3519042,JayM5209,2015-02-07 16:43:00,1050,"Pine View Inn in Virginia, just off 53 but easy to get to, or the Super 8 in Eveleth, right on 53, are good buys for the bucks. Have use both several times."
