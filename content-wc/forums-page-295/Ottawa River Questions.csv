3500690,MrSimon,2015-02-02 07:51:00,922,Hey folks. We are taking a different type of trip this year .... fishing the Ottawa river between Mattawa and Stonecliffe. We are staying at the Pine Valley Campground (due to suggestions I got from folks on this board - thanks!!) It looks like a nice remote part of the river with lots of different species to fish for. Does anyone have experience with this part of the river?
