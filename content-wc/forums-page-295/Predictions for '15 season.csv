This year we aren't going until last week of June, so that's why I am hoping it's another late ice out. I don't want all the pike to be too deep by the time we get there."
3503130,LoDo,2015-02-02 20:26:00,721,"Completely agree with your comment above and the first week of fishing the last two years not being good due to late ice out. Our group flew out of Red Lake west to Donald Lake Memorial Day week. We had to take off on the river as Howie Bay in Red Lake was still thawing black ice. There was so much ice below our flight I was thinking Donald would either be flooded or iced out. I was right with the floods. You couldn't fish the inlet because the current was so strong.Water temps were in the low 40s and there were seriously only two spots on that nice sized lake to consistently catch walleyes. Both spots were spawning areas with heave current. After last year, we'll be sticking to the mid to late June or early Sept. Both are great times to fish NWO. Cheers!"

3476282,HeHooksHimself,2015-01-25 06:54:00,725,"yeah thanks, zeebee, now my cabin fever is so high I need to look over my tackle box again to make sure I am ready 115 days from now, not that anyone is counting!"
3476322,BornToFish,2015-01-25 06:59:00,1224,"I'm hoping for an average ice-out on my lake of choice. The ice-out was quite late the last two years, such that several days of fishing were lost the first week of the opening week of walleye season. The ice-out was before the opening day the previous two years. Some great memories were made those years. The exchange rate and lower fuel costs are in my favor right now. I surely hope they are in place during my upcoming trips. These costs weren't in my favor the last few years. These things seem to average out over the long run. I'm looking forward to another great season of fishing the beautiful waters of Sunset County. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3477602,NARDA 1,2015-01-25 12:40:00,636,"It's going to be a ""GREAT"" year no matter what!!!!! The exchange rate and fuel prices are just added bonuses."
3477674,bobbylfishermon,2015-01-25 13:09:00,241,"I agree with Narda, any year is great, but some are better than others, and at my age(64) ****,out fishing on the lake, back to camp at my leisure, a glass of Forty creek rye and a cigar, some fresh fillets,Thankyou Lord !! May I have another??"
3479554,Pooch,2015-01-26 05:24:00,4619,"Every year is a great year. Some are just greater than others. Anytime I'm setting in a boat with my wife or my friends very few worldly matters actually matter. At least for a few days anyway.Chapped hands, bug bites, sun burn, soaked to the skin wet, easily offset by just fishing, camp food and BS'n.Yea, 2015 is gonna be another good if not great season (again).Pooch"
3479594,bigwalleye1,2015-01-26 06:19:00,2632,"NARDA for the win!! Friends, fish, favorable winds and exchange rates, good food, fresh air, my watch becomes my servant rather than my master, my Dad in the boat with me, it's going to be as incredible as ever. Makes me smile just thinking about it!!"
3479602,joe h,2015-01-26 06:19:00,46,"Looks like an early April ice off, fuel prices will probably bounce back a bit, but I expect e free premium to still be less than $3. But the last couple El Ni√±os have resulted in drought conditions around here, so I expect the corp of engineers to totally screw up the lake level, and release way too much water. Which is fine for a year, or two, since the last couple years of high water has made fishing nearly impossible. With work going back to 5 8s, I will probably go out 23 times before storing the boat for the winter."
3491042,prov1800,2015-01-29 10:33:00,5010,"Love it when the predictions start.haha.way to go zeebee.as of right now up here in gods country there isn't a lot of snow to speak of, so im thinking some low water if the spring rains hold of.not a lot of either so far, if the ice doesnt get much thicker theres a better chance of it breaking up.january was faurly kind to us up here in the north.febuary can bring a lot of bad stuff still and of course as well as march.should be interesting how it plays out.regardless of all that, when spring comes early or late it doesnt matter one little bit to me.dont want it to early cause that robs me of some of the best ice fishing of the year.i found last years late spring to have produced some of the best fishing ive had in years.of course gas prices here are a bonus right niw at 94 centsa ltr.still to much but better.but ththey'll figure a way to increase that like they always do.sitting at around 3 1/2 months till the walleye opener.ice fishing has been very good so far this year.big bonus is the crappie population is exploding and a blast to catch (and eat) haha."
3491210,packpro,2015-01-29 11:42:00,695,"Selfishly hoping for another late ice out. We had our best year ever. More walleye, bigger walleye, caught in more spots than ever. Smallmouth on top water........... that is a blast. Very aggressive Pike. Plus catching Lake trout when they are high in water column was great. Bite was on all day, and they would attack anything that was a minnow profile. Much more aggressive bite."
