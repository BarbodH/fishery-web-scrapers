3504466,Pooch,2015-02-03 10:43:00,4619,Draco's answer about going slow caught me a little off guard as I've always done well with the Pulse-R's and other paddle tails fished fast on a fairly heavy (1/2 or 5/8 ounce jig head) as in back trolling or snap jigging them. Guess they must work well both ways. Hmmm. Learned something today.Pooch
3504746,Draco1206,2015-02-03 12:17:00,175,"Might have more to do with the time year we were fishing as to why he was fishing them so slow. The last two years have had a very late ice outs and we were the first group in each year so the water was extremely cold and the walleyes were more into a neutral to negative feeding pattern. I remember the reason he bought this lure was because he saw a Canada fishing show where they were using these lures in very cold water and were slaying the walleyes. I also tried switching to Storm and Berkeley swim baits and retrieving them without pauses but wasn't catching anything like he was with his slow and pause retrieve. Nice to know they work at a faster retrieve also. Like I said, I'm not too old to learn new techniques."
3516434,pike50plus,2015-02-06 19:44:00,584,"I always try backtroll or slow forward troll with a snapping action to the jig, using heavier ones than when vertical or cast jigging in rapids. This seems to trigger bits and covers water to find fish. Also troll smaller to medium hotn tots in rocky ares and #9-11 rapalas with a slit shot 2 1/2-3 ft ahead to get it deeper and pulse or jerk the rod. I always remove the front hook on the raps and hotntots. Use thin invisa-leaders to avoid pike bite-offs."
3517458,packpro,2015-02-07 08:12:00,695,"FWIW. We did a one day fly in to a remote lake about in Northern Ontario. Strict artificial only lake. Early June trip. Three guys in the boat on top of stacked walleyes. We were all using Black Shad gulp. Do to the fly in we took minimal tackle. The guy in The middle of the boat was using the 3"" version. Myself and the other guy were using 5"" bait. We firmly held the belief "" big bait=big fish. We'll we are on the water for an hour and the tally reads guy in the middle 16 fish, most in the 22""-26"" range. Guys on the end 1 fish between them. I still love throwing bigger bait, but that day early in the year was a lesson to us that matching the hatch may also mean matching the size of the hatch. Needless to say, we were cutting and sometimes biting the larger baits down to the right size. Side note- that stuff is nasty. In the end the size did make adiffrence that day."
3491562,micropterus,2015-01-29 14:45:00,450,"Drift, cast, etc. Just keep it wet. Catches smallmouth, walleye, and the occasional demented pike."
3492794,kzoofisher,2015-01-30 04:15:00,5144,"I'll second this. I use both ball and darter jigs, mainly because that's what I mostly pour and depending on whether I'm hopping or swimming it back . When the shoreline is a more tapering drop or I'm staying near the tops of weeds I'll use 1/8 and even 1/16 ounce darters but any time the drop is pretty fast I'll go with 1/4 ball and pretty much just let the bait fall with the occasional lift. If the bite is hot I'll switch over to a standard curly tail simply because they are so cheap and I'm supplying bait for multiple people. White, pink/white (MI&ON), chartreuse, chart/orange (ON), PB&J and oyster (MI) have been my best producers. The Moxies are a good bait too though I think the paddle tail is a better searching option because of the extra thump. I've done well targeting smallmouth with them and walleye, you'll get a fair mix."
3493474,eyelegend,2015-01-30 08:20:00,9,"Thanks for the good info, definitely gonna try some of these out this year and see what works best for us."
3499522,yoopertrout,2015-02-01 18:29:00,1172,"Try jigs and salted minnows. Last summer my wife and I did our first fly in. We bought a gallon (about 1200) salted fatheads from Minnesota Bait and Tackle. We also bought live minnows from the outfitter. Both worked equally well, and the salted ones were much less expensive. We used 1/4 and 3/8 oz. jigs. In the stained water, pink worked best, but other colors okay too. Here's a link to the salted minnow dealer (who ships frozen so they arrive just before your trip):http://minnesotabaitandtackle.com/in...&products_id=6 Good luck and have fun!"
3499586,walleye IA,2015-02-01 18:45:00,129,Try a 3 way rig with a large stick bait.
3500146,ftfarms,2015-02-02 01:07:00,444,I've got a friend and other than jig and crawler all he does Is throw 1/4-1/2 white with silver single spinner- spinner baits. I've seen him catch walleye pike. Smallmouth and musky all on his little we call them safety pin spinner baits. oh I've also seen him catch some big crappie on his spinner.
3500714,MrSimon,2015-02-02 07:56:00,922,"There are so many different ways to fish in Canada .... all good ... all fun. For a nice change of pace from chucking lures, we like to troll. Especially in the evening! We grab a cooler of sodas, a couple bags of chips and leisurely troll the shorelines and islands as it gets dark. It's a great way to relax, enjoy the scenery, chat with buddies, and oh, it's also very productive! Our favorite trolling lure is a basic rattle trap trolled about two cast lengths behind the boat. You can troll pretty fast with those things. Walleye feeding in the shallows at dusk love them. Pike and bass too."
3501634,Draco1206,2015-02-02 12:21:00,175,"I can personally vouch for rocko0305 and his Pulse R Paddle Tails, as I was in the boat fishing with him last year on Washi lake and was on the receiving end of at least a 2 to 1 walleye a$$ whopping for the whole trip. I was using 1/4 oz. jigs with white or chartreuse twister tails tipped with either gulp, trigger x minnows or belly strips. While I caught plenty of fish he easily doubled my catch rate. He did the same the year before on Beteau lake, where he and his friend easily caught more walleyes and bigger walleyes than the other 8 anglers combined.A couple things I noticed about these baits is that you fish them very slow, even extremely slow, so if you're not a patient angler this isn't for you. Fishing them in current is great, you barely need to move them. They have tremendous action even on the slowest retrieves. The reason for their great action, besides the ribbed body, is the large paddle and the very thin connection from the paddle to the body, and that is the other thing I noticed. Because of the thin connection to the tail, it gets bit off quite easily and he was changing the bait much more often than I was. Having said that, he still out fished me by a large margin, and he caught the largest walleye of the trip, so the trade off is worth it. Just be prepared to replace these more often than you would a twister tail, and make sure you bring plenty for your trip. And as I said before if you're not a patient angler you might not like having to change your bait more often because of bit off tails. The ""keeper"" style jigheads are absolutely the way to go with these baits also. And he's right about the smallies too, he's starting to out fish me there too. So the teacher has now become the pupil and I am not too old yet to learn new fishing techniques. I will definitely be adding this lure to my tackle box this year."
3502114,eyelegend,2015-02-02 15:23:00,9,"The BfishN jigs look great but aren't cheap. I know you get what you pay for but are there any other ""keeper"" style jigheads to look at? Looked up Deans Tackle and seems there's limited quantity available online, they look pretty good. I've use Northland in the past and wasn't that impressed."
3502378,Draco1206,2015-02-02 16:38:00,175,"If you don't like the jig heads rocko suggested, try Tackle Warehouse web site. They have several different styles to choose from. Try a couple different ones and find out what works for you. I know rocko was using a jig head taken off of another swimbait I think was called a Mimic Minnow and he seemed to like those."
3490674,rocko0305,2015-01-29 08:58:00,138,"eyelegend, I've become a huge fan over my past 2 trips to Canada of the Bfishn' Tackle 3.5"" Pulse-R swim bait rigged on a 1/4 oz. jig for fishing for walleyes. I love being able to cast out in a fan pattern around the boat or towards the shore/structure, let it hit the bottom, and then slowly reel in with some pauses every 10 feet or so. My buddy and I both caught 28"" walleyes in back to back years using this bait. Seems that I have been able to locate fish more quickly using this bait/method, and then once you know where they're at, it's as simple as continually casting in that same direction. That kind of fishing sure beats traditional jigging for walleye in my opinion, and sure as heck beats dealing with Husky Jerk treble hooks when you are trying to boat numerous fish. Here is a link to the bait I am referring to. No need really for any other color besides Great White from my experiences in Canada. I have also tried the Orange Core color, but have not had as good of results. http://www.bfishntackle.com/pulser_paddletail.html Another plus of these baits is that I smallmouth fish in Michigan all summer, and that bait has been absolutely crushed by the smallies as well. The other soft plastic I like to use on a jig head is the Gulp! 3"" minnow and Gulp! 3"" minnow grub. White or White/Chartreuse are the colors I use in that bait. Good luck!"
3490754,retire55,2015-01-29 09:09:00,1029,"Last year, new fishing colleagues introduced me to using swimbaits for both walleye and northerns. I enjoyed some success using 5"" Berkley Powerbait Ripple Shads on 3/8 oz Fin Tech Minnow swim jigs casting rocky shorelines as well as rock outcroppings."
3490794,v-bay gord,2015-01-29 09:14:00,3168,"Hey Rocko.........thanks for the tip and link. I think I'll give those a try this summer. Looks like a good smallmouth bait as well..... Zeebee, some of us just love to rant. It's the Irish in me, plus my Winnipeg Ukrainian heritage...."

3491082,eyelegend,2015-01-29 10:49:00,9,"Anyone have experience with 5"" swimbaits like Big Hammer?"
3491114,packpro,2015-01-29 11:06:00,695,"My groups personal experience...... We had been jig and minnow guys forever. We fish 3-4 great bodies of water during our week in Canada. We usually have our limit in a 1/2 hour and the rest of the week is fun fishing. Every now and then (happens a lot) we would get on a hot bite and run out of bait. Then we would switch over to gulp (5"" black shad), chartreuse twister tails, and 6"" powerbait swim baits. See Pictures. We love this style of fishing. Make no mistake it is our experience that the jig and minnow still catches the most fish, but after awhile that tap, tap, tap, bite gets boring. Some of the guys now bring baitcasters spooled with braid, and others just use their spin casters. It is a blast to ""zing"" those lures and cover water. The most fun is the bite. No tap, tap, tap, It is a vicious, territorial attack on the lure. So far, our experience has been that the gulp and the twister tails work best for the walleyes, but the swim bait is a very close second. The versatility of the swim bait is what we like best. It is effective on everything. Lots of smallmouth, and great for the pike. When we have used them in the past, we have also noticed that it selected for bigger fish. What we really like is that you cover great distances with each cast, and by varying your retrieve you can cover huge sections of the water column."
3491338,adempsey,2015-01-29 12:49:00,963,"I am not sure what exactly qualifies as a swimbait, but I've had great success using various paddletail minnows on a lead head jig (or a swimbait jig if you want).The X-Zone Swammer and the Northland Impulse Paddle Minnow [thanks Mike B!] are great. You can fish them like a grub - drift, jig, cast& retrieve...whatever. I love these baits!There are a lot of others that I am sure are just as good. I have a few from Berkley that should work great (Ripple Shad and Havoc), I just haven't used them much yet. Basstrix makes some nice ones too."

3491498,Tylumps,2015-01-29 14:23:00,73,"Hello, I concur on the Jigs and crawler for walleyes on a shield lake. But if you are anchored and the jig slows down, try a slip bobber. It works even better if you got a breeze. Throw the slip up wind a bit and let the bobber work it's way along side the boat. Set the bait about a foot off the bottom and use a plain bait hook or aberdeen hook. One more point about the slips, if you are in over 10 feet of water, you have to reel in all the slack and set the hook with a long stroke. Good Luck!!"
3490258,eyelegend,2015-01-29 07:34:00,9,"Hey everyone, need some advice. We head north every year to a drive in camp on Mistnikon lake in Ontario. Most of the guys in the group will only throw Husky Jerks, usually the size 14's, for darn near the whole week. Granted we have caught some really nice fish over the years but tossing jerks for a whole week straight is tiring and we're not getting younger. We're headed up 3rd week of June, a week earlier than usual. Thinking about trying swimbaits this year as I believe this is something the guys could get into since they love to cast and will give them a chance at some nice fish. Any advice on what size, brand and color for Ontario water? Saw a few older posts here and read some InFishermen articles but I have no experience with swimbaits, wondering if anyone has some more info or other techniques that could try to put some fish in the boat and make the trip that much better. Thanks."

Could be an option for those ""more mature"" in the group. The only times I would cast for walleye would be if they were tight to some structure or if I'm fishing a cabbage patch. What about tossing some jigs tipped with twister tails, or grubs, to those same points and using more of a finesse retrieve. Probably would entail a lighter rod and line....might be more relaxing."
