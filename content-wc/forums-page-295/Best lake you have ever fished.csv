3519298,Jason G3,2015-02-07 18:15:00,965,"I've done my share of Canadian fishing trips to some nice lodges. To be honest though, it's the lake 5 miles from me. It has to be lake St Clair. When you can cast/troll for big muskie in the morning, bass fish in the afternoon, and troll for eye's in the evening on the same lake you know you've got it good. I will no longer plan those $$$$ Canadian trips anymore with long drives when I can get results 15 minutes from my driveway."
3519890,eyesright,2015-02-07 23:21:00,5,I have never fished lake st clair but I saw a few fishing shows about Muskie fishing on it its unbelievable. I fish in lake erie near the mouth of the Niagara river like you I live two minutes away and when its to rough for walleye I usually stay inshore and go for smallies I caught one a couple years ago that was twenty two and a half inches long the biggest I ever caught I let him go. I also fish for perch in the spring and fall they are big in erie I weighed one last fall he was 1.9 lbs I have never caught a muskie I don't fish the river that often but I would love to catch one. good luck this year Jason Tight lines

3520602,LoDo,2015-02-08 08:46:00,721,"Love this! Couldnt agree more. The fishing is wonderful, however the best part of the trip is sitting two sticks in a boat, 4-5 boats, sun is setting, warm and 65 enjoying each others company! Its tough to beat. I have family and friends that have done deep sea, Alaska, etc... and all agree the Canadian trip is the best. The good lord nailed it with NWO!"

I can only imagine the stories you have to tell and the memories that will last to the grave. In my limited experience, Lac Theodat in Quebec has my vote. It is truly a wilderness adventure that can be driven to if you do not mind the rough roads. Thanks for all the tips"

The only lodge that never made a dime of food lol. I never stayed at the lodge only went there to eat. fished the lake once and it was decent (awesome smallmouth though), I do a lot better at other area lakes."

Walleye I do not eve try for them Because I live close to lake Erie The ""real"" walleye capitol of the world!!!"

You can eat off the floor in the fish cleaning facility. Probably the best morning my wife and I had was in early Aug on our second trip that year. She can count very well and after 55 doubles (didn't count unless we both got them into the boat). So we both had several singles (not counted). We ran out of minnows---scoured the boat for any heads or pcs left over. Changed to plastic grubs no stop to the catching. My brother-in-law won't go back with me he said its not fishing its catching. Bill only went once. I am now 84 and last yr with a granddaughter (her first fish was a 24"" wally) had a great time. Trying to get my son to go with me and of course his work keeps him from going. Will probably go alone and the staff will help me in and out of the dock. I just hope it isn't my last yr. Wonderful fishing....Great amount of water....multi lakes tied together with fun rivers. My best is 29 1/2, so am looking for that big 30+. Took my brother-in law Louis 6 yrs ago and he caught 3 over 30 in that week using my lures (I makem) rod.reels etc. His best was 31 1/2. I won't take him back..

Granted, I've never fished Lac Seul, Mille Lacs, Cedar, or some of the other favorites on this list, but I can't imagine it getting any better than LOTW (and i have visited my share of other fishing destinations). The lake is so massive, that you could never fish it all in 3 lifetimes. And the lake changes so much from one area to another, so it fishes like many different lakes at once. It can go from shallow, cloudy, and weedy, to 190' deep and crystal clear. And the variety is second to none. Want crappie? Check. More walleye and pike than you can imagine? Check. Like catching smallies? No problem. Feel like trying for lake trout today? Sure thing. And all while fishing a body of water where you have a legitimate chance at a world record musky on any cast. More specifically, my favorite areas (at least so far) are the Stony Portage area, and Caribou Lake (as Obabikon previously mentioned)."

My wife caught her biggest on Lac Seul a really nice 31 1/2 "" Walleye that she has a replica of in our living room. When I really look at the canadian experience the fishing is important but the time with friends and family is the real deal.

Any of the fly in lakes that doug gawley use to own and now Clark's owns them all. They are ridiculous and actually I would say on those lakes its not fishing its catching. ha. Worst lake was Perrault/cedar lakes area by far. Did 2 years in that area and doesn't come close to waters further north in red lake area.

Plenty of post spawn eyes to be caught and released. 30 in. And back to back 29inchers! Fishing out of Black Bear Lodge on Red Lake in August has been great too!

3116329,Andyeye,2014-08-23 06:26:00,179,"I will always remember fishing Glen Lake on a fly in trip out of Red Lake. I will probably never get back there again but I fished there for about 5 years in a row back in the late 80s and early 90s. We caught lots of nice 20"" to 25"" inch walleyes. I caught the 2 biggest walleyes of my life there on back to back drops of my jig. I caught a 33"" and 29"" in the span of 6 or 7 minutes and that I will never forget. Both were released after pictures. I agree with many of the other posts about Lac Seul also. I just returned from Cedar Lake and I loved it there. It was easy to get on fish we caught good numbers and fish up to 26"" on our first trip there."
3116505,revitup,2014-08-23 07:47:00,140,"Some of my best fishing for numbers was on Onaman. Seclusion due to the walk in also made it nice, but was popular enough that other boats were always there. Nice fish in 19-23"" range. For drive to lakes we are extremely happy with Cedar Lake. Great numbers and also better size. Last two years our group has netted 6 walleye over 30"", with several more 26"" and above. Can't comment on fly in lakes because our group's budget is limited to the drive to lakes. We feel fortunate to have the place we have for the money. Best week of the year."
3127833,Moosebunk,2014-08-27 07:09:00,211,Ontario favorite is Nipigon. I'll trade 100 walleyes or pike for just one... and trade 50 speckled or lake trout for one as well. This is Ontario's lake for record sizes in these four awesome species.

Was only there twice.St. Joe is probably the best drive to for walleye numbers and large pike. Problem is not a lot of size in the walleyes, lots 18 to 22 very few 25 to 30 and its a long drive, huge lake and pricey. Was at St. Joe 10 times.Have not been to LOW.We now fish a smaller lake (10miles long) between Dryden and Ignace only one camp and maybe 8 to 10 boats on the lake. I have 40 walleye spots marked on my map. Lost count of how many 25 plus walleyes we caught this year. Cost us about 350 pp for the week. Will probably never go anywhere else. My point is, that you do not have to go to the big waters and pricey resorts to have good fishing. There are little gems all over Ontario."

It proves once again that the WC gang has the amswers when it comes to Walleye fishing. My favorite is Lac Seul mostly because of the great fishing and awesome memories I have with all the guys I have fished with there over the last 30 years. We always have a great time and we catch more fish than Mother Nature should give up to anybody. We also have met some awesome lodge owners who have great service and make the trips even better. Hats off to Lac Seul Lodge, Lost Island Lodge and Evergreen Lodge they all three make the trips special. My second spot would be the Red River north of Sekirk in October. There are some big eyes there and I saw the Manitoba record there when a 10 year old boy caught a 39"" Walleye. It is still the Manitoba record.

3333586,freespoolin,2014-11-27 15:35:00,472,"OK, I'm spoiled, I live here so have a number of favorites. 1. Red Lake and connecting lakes. We can always find good walleyes for numbers and size in Red Lake or Keg. A large body of water with lots of choice and very little fishing pressure. 2. Lake of the Woods. Big water, lots of choice and while there are many boats on the water only a small percentage are fishing. And LOTW offers pike, muskie and smallmouth for variety. 3. The Manigotagan River to Lake Winnipeg for a short period in early June. The greenbacks are in shallow, in numbers and potentially in good size. 4. The Winnipeg River at Pine Falls Manitoba. Watch for the water temp to drop below fifty and get ready for some fantastic days for numbers and size. Oct 24, 2013, two of us caught 68 walleye including 5 over 28"". 5. The Saskatchewan River at Grand Rapids Manitoba. While usually not too many large fish, 100 fish/boat/day is not unusual in late June into July. Easy fishing just drifting the river. And a short drive to Footprint Lake for trout. 6. The Red River at Selkirk Manitoba. Great in the spring for huge channel cats, the fall run for greenback walleyes can be outstanding. Be prepared to put in a week on the River as it can be hot and cold."

3105425,bboehm,2014-08-19 17:25:00,7,"Our early years (20+ years ago) took us to Wabaskang (Morgan's camp) and we used to catch walleye there non stop. One of the best days we ever had however was a trip (portage) over to Sharon lake and spent most of the mid day catching pike on just about every third or fourth cast. It was incredible - bit of a rough portage though getting there. Seen a boat at the bottom of the falls that didn't have very good luck. Then about 15 years ago, Wabaskang seemed to slow down so we decided to try Red Lake. Little bit further to get to but this is a world class fishery. About 5 years ago in June we found a spot on the East end of the lake near East Bay that was incredible. We were catching so many 26's and 28's that it almost became what we expected. Also got a few 30's. That was by far the best we've ever seen!"

I am only able to do this on occasions but am dam glad I have done it. In my opinion go north you may loose some size due to growing season but you gain in numbers, being somewhere where you never see a plane or another human is special. I encourage never think just because you cross the boarder you have seen the real Canada."

I'm trying Abram/Minnitaki in a couple of weeks, but people who have fished both tell me the fishing is good ""but it's not St. Joe."" Every fishing trip and lake are different, but they're all fun.

Not even an hour over the Thousand Island crossing. We also discovered Green Single Lodge which we fished from all those years with friends, wives, and our kids. The fishing was for walleye, smallmouth, pike, and big rock bass and usually pretty good. I've fished a whole lot of lakes with bigger fish and wilder surroundings but there never will be one that surpasses wolfe for me."
3089641,Curryale,2014-08-14 13:09:00,50,It really depends what you want. Spent one day on the Bay of Quinte last fall and caught 11 fish with 7 over 10 lbs. To me not much can top that kind of fishing.
3089993,tv4fish,2014-08-14 14:41:00,2694,I agree - I think it depends on what is more important to you - quantity or quality........
3090057,octanehi5,2014-08-14 14:54:00,1104,"I can speak for the best in Quebec is Lac Hebert, A fly in only trip,Outfitters camp and equipment are top notch, Have spent the last 11yrs on this lake,Many of the guys I have brought to the lac have set many pesonal bests.Mine happens to be over 900 walleyes in a week , my best pike being 43"" and 25 lbs. In my eyes after fishing the great north for more than 30 yrs, Its the best lac I have fished"
3090345,ftfarms,2014-08-14 16:26:00,444,Yes it's lake of the woods. We fish out of morson Ontario. Miles bay and obabikon bay and that area.
3090705,Guest,2014-08-14 18:24:00,0,"For big fish -- Erie, more 10 pound plus pigs than anywhere on the planet."
3090873,ftfarms,2014-08-14 19:38:00,444,Lake Ontario has more than Erie. Thats what we've found anyway.
3090881,bigwillies,2014-08-14 19:38:00,515,best lake i have fished was squaw lake.south of savant.4 people.felt like 100 walleys in an hour.first time the wife complaned about sore wrists from too many fish.
3091297,Walleye507,2014-08-15 05:05:00,193,We met? Most folks that know those lakes have stayed at Lukinto. I haven't been there since Jody sold.
3087201,Walleye will,2014-08-13 18:26:00,218,Mine is wine lake by Purrut Falls or Black bear lodge on red lake .I want to see yours.
3087713,rather-be-fishin,2014-08-13 21:34:00,429,Hands down..........Lac Seul for Awesome Walleye! RBF
3087729,ftfarms,2014-08-13 21:43:00,444,Lac suel for size of walleye. Lotw for variety and cedar lake for ease of fishing. So I love all three. Can't pick a best one.
3087913,Mike Borger,2014-08-14 04:49:00,1554,Easy answer for me. I've been on over 50 fly in trips and the one I did this past June to North Caribou lake was hands down the best for both walleye and pike.
3087961,Walleye507,2014-08-14 05:30:00,193,"Devils Lake, NDString of lakes @ Longlac, ON with Fernow being my favorite in that area."
3088201,nitrodude,2014-08-14 07:14:00,60,For me it's a close tie between Lac Seul and Minnitaki. Every year we seem to have fantastic days on both. This year our fishing was so good on 'Taki that we never ventured up to Seul during our yearly ten day trip. Another great year for sure.
3088521,Fishoil,2014-08-14 08:33:00,1277,Fernow is one of my favorites in that area. Little Chipman is right up there too.
3089249,Walleye will,2014-08-14 11:22:00,218,Were on Lac Seul do you go.
3089329,rather-be-fishin,2014-08-14 11:46:00,429,We go to the NW end of Lac Seul. Fisherman's Cove Resort in Scout Bay. Good location to good access to good fishing areas. Other resorts nearby are Onaway Lodge and Lac Seul Lodge. RBF
