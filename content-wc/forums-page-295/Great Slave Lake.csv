Been looking very closely at Frontier Lodge on the east arm of Great Slave. Trophy pike, lake trout and grayling and a pretty decent price compared to other lodges.This year my travel schedule is booked solid but I think I'll be traveling there 1st week of August 2016.If you're after pike Taltson Bay on Great Slave is pretty incredible by all accounts."
