3516858,Guest,2015-02-07 04:16:00,0,fishermen can you verify what owner of stromer lake resort told me there is no housekeeping resort with 60 miles of lake there is a public boat launch on the lake so we could launch daily to fish the lake however he has only American plan very pricey even with September discount seniors on fixed income from Chicago any suggestions ?? jim wolf Chicago boys
3518466,tackleman,2015-02-07 12:38:00,444,"there are resorts within the range you are talking, BUT they are boat in and you have to portage into them. so if you are looking at a daily trip into stormer, forget it. the boat ramp is right beside the highway and is in a weed bed, there is also no place to park more than 1 vehicle and I'm not sure how you would get a trailer parked. most of the guys around here who fish stormer take a 14 foot boat in the back of their pickups. this lake system has only developed into a good fishery because of it's limited access by day fishermen. the previous camp owner was so adamant about what could be taken out of the lake , at shore lunch the fishermen brought 1 fish each for lunch, the guides did the cooking and anything that was left over was taken back to camp and put in a brine type of sauce that pickled them . this was put out on the salad bar at dinner and was delicious. NO fish (walleye) over 17 inches was brought back to camp for cleaning to take home and I'm guessing that over 90 percent of the guests had conservation licences that allowed them to take home 2 fish, but most didn't take any. personally, I would hope that if you want to fish this lake, book a stay at the lodge, I'm sure you could work out a deal for a 2 or 3 day stay then head into the red lake area for the remaining time on your trip. you won't have a problem , I think, getting a lodge to stay at for a couple days and fish some good areas and stay at a housekeeping camp."
3520018,Guest,2015-02-08 04:51:00,0,thanks for your help I talked to shelly at o'sullivan's lake resort out of nakina and I think this place is for us housekeeping can bring our own boat reasonable price other guys have recommended the place great walleye fishing lake 14 x 7 miles over 100 islands they are almost booked for the season already which tells me the place must be good we are going mid to late September so no problems for us looks like our choice for 2nd trip jim wolf Chicago boys
3491442,BornToFish,2015-01-29 13:56:00,1224,"I was following another thread on this forum for the same lakes. This thread might have been nuked. Anyways..... I learned of Stormer Lake and Kirkness Lake while attending the recent All Canada Show in Green Bay, WI. My wife and I have considerable interest in learning more about these lakes as we might book a vacation during mid-August. Do any of the followers of this forum in Walleye Central have personal experience with these lakes? If so, what is your top-line summary of these lakes? I did a Google search of Kirkness Lake the other day and found a generic report that the lake has lake trout. Does anyone have first-hand knowledge about this? The same report said the lake has walleyes, northern pike and small mouth bass. What is the forage base for the fish in these lakes? I'm guessing it's perch and various minnows. The possibility of lake trout suggests that the lake might have ciscoes/tullibees. Again, does anyone have first-hand knowledge about this? The reason that I ask about ciscoes is that I have experience on another lake in NW Ontario that contains ciscoes. It seems that the bigger walleyes are out in the abyss chasing ciscoes during August. We mostly catch numbers of walleyes during August fishing structure, while the big girls are out in the middle of nowhere baby-sitting the ciscoes. Many kind thanks in advance."
3492378,BornToFish,2015-01-29 19:56:00,1224,"Tackleman, I am still tracking down a map for Kirkness Lake. Would you please repeat your directions on how to locate those points of interest that you mentioned in an earlier email. I believe that you referenced Eagle Island, Outlet Bay and Sand Bay. I hope that I am correctly remembering the names of those places. Many kind thanks."

3495946,Oldicecoach,2015-01-31 09:49:00,15,"An earlier post asked about the acreage of these lakes, I used a GIS program to get a rough estimate on acreage.Stormer = 800 acres m/lKirkness = 5500 acres m/lIslands are included in the Kirkness acreage."
3496386,1/4 oz Jig,2015-01-31 12:26:00,90,Thanks oldiecoach I asked on a previous post.
3497090,BornToFish,2015-01-31 18:24:00,1224,"Thanks for the estimate on the acreage of the two lakes. These estimates give me a better feel as to the size of the lakes. The lake that I have been fishing for many years runs around 8,500 acres. I find a lake this size to be manageable - not too big and not too small. Does anyone have any knowledge as to the forage base for the gamefish in the lake - minnows, perch, ciscoes, whitefish, etc? Also, does anyone know if the lakes have lake trout? I'd be happy to hear stories or insights regarding the fishing on Stormer and Kirkness lakes! Many kind thanks....."
3506194,Guest,2015-02-03 20:57:00,0,fishermen to your knowledge is their housekeeping resorts on stromer lake or kirkness I talked to owner of stromer lake resort and only American plan also maybe a near by resort for housekeeping since we are bringing are own boat if their is a public launch on lake we could bring our boat and launch on a daily basis jim wolf Chicago boys
3507490,BornToFish,2015-02-04 10:55:00,1224,"Jim, I met the owners of Stormer Lake Lodge at the All Canada Show in Green Bay, WI - probably the same people that you talked to. Their comments about the fishing in Stormer and Kirkness Lakes peeked my wife's and my interest. We have had several follow-up conversations with the owners to better understand their lodge and the lakes. I've also had some off-line conversations with anglers that have fished the lakes. I understand that Stormer Lake Lodge is the only fishing lodge on Stormer and Kirkness Lakes. I understand there is an un-improved boat launch on Stormer Lake that is managed by Stormer Lake Lodge for the Ministry of Natural Resources. It sounded to me as though the MNR likes to have an estimate as to the number of anglers that fish these lakes, such the MNR can better manage the fishery. We were told that Stormer Lake Lodge only has American Plan offerings. My wife and I are curious as to how well this will work for us, as we have only had Housekeeping Plan cabins in the past. I don't know if there are any other fishing lodges in their area - at least within a reasonable driving distance. It might be that other nearby lodges have housekeeping plans available such that you could maybe take a one day trip onto Stormer and Kirkness and give these lakes a try. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3508034,tackleman,2015-02-04 14:30:00,444,"you are curious as to how well an American plan would work for you, come on, what wife wants to go on a holiday and have to cook. the food is great, the shore lunch is wonderful and you will enjoy every day you are there."
3508850,BornToFish,2015-02-04 17:50:00,1224,"That's what my wife was thinking at first - she wouldn't have to do any cooking - same for me! Then, she got to thinking that we would sleep in every morning in order to have the breakfast served to us. She wouldn't have to get up at the first hint of daylight to go fishing! So, she was really liking the idea of American Plan! The last thing that I heard is we might have to leave fish in order to be at the dining hall when supper is served! She wasn't too crazy about that idea if the fish were biting at that time. We will have to decide before too long. Tackleman - what is the forage base for the gamefish in Kirkness and Stormer? I assume they feed on minnows and perch. But, are there ciscoes and whitefish?"
