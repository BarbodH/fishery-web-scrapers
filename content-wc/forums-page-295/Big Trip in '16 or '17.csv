3518042,spoonchucker,2015-02-07 10:14:00,82,"I did not write the Article, my son did. He is executive editor of the magazine. Has the dream job of fishing as work. He was in Florida last week fishing Hawks Cay because Lowrance wanted to show their new line of fish finders. But he started with me taking him on the pike & walleye trips when he was 7 and he still loves to go on those with me."
3521354,LoDo,2015-02-08 12:15:00,721,"Jan Lake Lodge. This place is one of my all time favorites. Its extremely far north Saskatchewan. Big time lodge, service and lake! Five Star all the way.http://janlakelodge.ca Oneway Lodge on Lac Seul is solid too! IMO its the best lodge on Lac Seulhttp://www.onawaylodge.com"
3521898,jWN,2015-02-08 15:16:00,62,Have been to Big Sand Lake lodge 2x and have had good to great fishing. We did the out post camp both times and would again. The main lodge guests that I talked with all had good experiance's also.
3510834,KipawaTodd,2015-02-05 09:47:00,1,"Thought I'd post this out here as I know there's a good following from central U.S. and western Ontario, Manitoba, etc. My annual 'Canada Trip' group has decided it's time to start planning for ""The Big Trip. We've been going since the mid-70s...based out of Ohio, and now we're in a place where we can spend ""bigger"" money on a bigger experience. We've been all over Ontario and have been on Lake Kipawa, Quebec for the last 15 years. We're open to anything, but have done a cursory look at Budd's Gunisao Lake Lodge, Silsby Lake Lodge, and Bolton Lake Lodge. All of those are in Manitoba....but that's what came up in our search for our primary targets of walleye and pike. No need for anything else, but smallies would be a nice bonus. We're not at all closed to Ontario, Quebec, or Saskatchewan either.I know there's a lot of fertile ground in Ontario...I often read a lot about Lac Seul... Any info or personal recommendations on a Lodge/Outfitter would be great. Thanks."
3511258,mt hook,2015-02-05 11:57:00,65,"You should tell more about what you are looking for.Drive in camp, fly in, boat in, are you bringing your own boat/s.Housekeeping, american plan, outpost. Are fish numbers more importantthen size? The kind of boat the camp uses/trolling motor?Ask this one, witch camp has the best food for your doller. That one is importantto me. If im spending a couple of grand, and get blown off the lake for a day or twoI hope to eat well if nothing else.Good Luck, You have lots to chose from.You should ask to have this thread moved to Canada forum"
3511562,Juls,2015-02-05 13:21:00,13414,You just did... Done.
3511834,MrSimon,2015-02-05 14:15:00,922,"Considering you have lots of time to plan and a pretty big budget ..... you can afford to be VERY specific on what you want. Figure out exactly what you want, and more than likely the place exists. If you guys haven't done a fly-in .... do it!"
3513698,spoonchucker,2015-02-06 07:25:00,82,I have done fly-ins in various provinces for over 30 years. The most incredible pike trip I ever had was Edmund lake Manitoba - the outpost for Elk Island Lodge. Take a commercial flight to Winnipeg and then you are set. I would be going back this year except he raised prices and that priced some of my group out and we did not want to abandon some of the guys in our group. Here is the website that details our trip as reported in the magazine article.http://www.onthewater.com/canadian-d...-pike-fishing/ Owner of this lake and Elk is nephew or cousin of Bolton Owner. Guys in my group fished Bolton and enjoyed it but said fishing here was superior.
3513714,spoonchucker,2015-02-06 07:30:00,82,If the link in my last reply does not work just google Canadian Dream Trip Fly in Pike Fishing
3514258,tv4fish,2015-02-06 10:15:00,2694,spoon: This the one?http://www.onthewater.com/canadian-d...-pike-fishing/
3514826,spoonchucker,2015-02-06 13:15:00,82,Yes- that's it. That is my group- Trip of a life time. Until maybe this year...going to Eddie's. But if you get a chance to ever do Edmund Lake- take it. Really strange to fish a lake as an outpost that once was a full American plan Lodge and the outpost cabin is the owner's old house.
3514914,tv4fish,2015-02-06 13:59:00,2694,If you wrote that article/story -- GREAT job.
3516226,michigan walleye guy,2015-02-06 19:10:00,95,"I remember reading about Edmund Lake Lodge in an early '70's article in Outdoor Life. I remember, as a 10-year old, just drooling over those pictures of giant pike and walleyes, not to mention the detailed account of the shore lunches. I remember promising myself that one day I'd be taking those kinds of trips. I haven't missed my annual fly-in in over 15 years now, and am up to two/year. I forsake almost every vice possible to be able to save for these trips. The fact that my buddies and I are slowly getting older just makes each trip more precious than the last. Boy, I miss the writing style and photography of the old Outdoor Life issues. I still subscribe, but it's like reading an issue of popular mechanics half the time. Funny how certain threads in this forum bring back tons of memories. Thanks, guys!"
