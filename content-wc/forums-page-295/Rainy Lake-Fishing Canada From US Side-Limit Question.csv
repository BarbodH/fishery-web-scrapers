3482442,Guest,2015-01-26 18:31:00,0,no Rainy Lake has a limit of one for non residents. LOTW has a limit of 2 and so does all the inland lakes in the Rainy River district. But Rainy is one / day and has its own slot 13.8- 17.8 you can keep and one over 27.5 none between 17.8 and 27.5. although ever one should throw back anything over 27.5 anyway
3482674,Redlabel,2015-01-26 19:37:00,279,"Canada regs for Rainy are non-resident with a sportsman or conservation licence you can only ""catch and retain in one day, 1 walleye between 13.8-17.8"" or one over 27.5 If you bring your walleye back by RABC on Rainy lake your one walleye has to be less than 17 inches or over 28 that is the MN regs. They can be in the live well or cooler as whole the CO has to be able to identify length. I am talking about a day trip into Canada."
3483386,Bigstorm,2015-01-27 06:45:00,799,"I stay on the MN side in October and looked into being able to fish on both side of the lake. For me, it seemed like too much of a pain as you would need both licenses and the RABC card. I also was told that you need to call in to Canadian Customs/Border Control from a land line letting them know that you are crossing, you would not be able to take any live bait purchased in MN accross and you would not be able to have any alcohol in the boat while in Canadian waters. I havent seen the last few items written anywhere, but it made me not want to go thru the hassle of trying to fish both sides."
3483410,h8go4s,2015-01-27 06:55:00,1673,"Wow. There's a lot of confusing info being posted here. Check the actual regulations published by the Minnesota DNR and Ontario MNR . Don't go by internet advice from strangers. And when the ""camp manager"" tells you ""don't worry about it"", remember that he won't be paying the fine if you get caught."
3484434,Blackmacs,2015-01-27 11:56:00,2121,"As stated you can fish Canada waters with the appropriate paperwork, i.e. licence and RABC permit, and bring fish back into Minnesota. I strongly suggest you do not have any species of fish longer than what the Minnesota regs allow nor in a greater amount that the possession limits. It may say it's OK in the regs as long as you have proof of lodging etc, but it's not worth the hassle. Also DO NOT bring leeches or live minnows across the border. Crawlers are OK as long as they are in bedding and not dirt. Salted minnows are also OK, at least for right now. Rainy has more enforcement on it than at the North/South Korean border. There is OPP, Ontario MNR, Border Patrol, National Park Rangers, County Sheriff, MN DNR and soon the Coast Guard will be out from what I hear."
3484930,Redlabel,2015-01-27 15:00:00,279,"http://files.ontario.ca/environment-...nr_e001325.pdfI agreeBorder waters are not inland waters, per Canadian Regs. the first page shows zone 5 in two sections, and the top of page 24 shows the slot and limit non residents can have in possession per-day. US customs won't give you a verification slip for fish caught in border lakes even when staying in Canada they will tell you the fish count towards your Mn daily limit.Call VNP headquarters and talk to a CO they will tell you any fish being brought back over the border by water have to be with in the lakes limit and legal slot size"
3528018,Guest,2015-02-10 11:20:00,0,"One easy solution is to stay on the Canadian side. You don't need any of the paper work, no RABC etc. The limits and slots are the same though, but no border hassle at all, (except for you initial crossing)"
3528322,Marcus Trajan,2015-02-10 12:38:00,203,"Here is a cut and paste from the 2014 MN Fish regs. "" If legally taken from a connected water or having been packaged by a licensed fishpacker, a person who is in transit and taking the most direct route back to their lodging or docking, and not fishing, may possess fish outside of or in excess of the limits for that water body"" In other words if you catch fish on the Canadian side you must take them directly to your camp. My interpretation would be that you could take them directly to your camp if you are going to consume them there, but if you intend to take them home you would have to take them directly to the landing. That's how it was explained to me when I asked a Minnesota warden a few years ago. I camp in VNP every year and fish the Canadian side of Namakan and Sand Point. I make a point of clearing the tracks on my GPS each day before I head out so if there ever was a question I could show by my GPS track that I left my camp, traveled directly to the Canadian side, fished and came directly back. The only fish I keep are ones that we eat right away. My advice would be to email the DNR your question and keep a copy of the emailed response in case the local warden doesn't know the law."
3481370,joshuatree78,2015-01-26 14:32:00,28,I'm going to be fishing Rainy Lake this July and will be staying on the US side. I have fished the Canadian side before and want to hit up a few of the hot spots we have found but I'm not sure what the restrictions are for bringing fish caught on the CA side back to camp on the US side of the lake. I have tried doing some searches but haven't been able to find anything solid. Can anyone help clear this up for me?Josh
3481394,camp chef,2015-01-26 14:45:00,915,I can't help with the transporting fish across the border question but I do know you will need a canadian license and a Remote border crossing pass if you are going to be crossing by boat.
3481402,Carnhzkr,2015-01-26 14:45:00,964,"It would be no different than driving over to Ontario to fish for a day. You'd need an Ont license and the same daily and possession limits apply (4 with one over the slot for a sportsman's license or 2 under 18"" for conservation)."
3481434,Carnhzkr,2015-01-26 14:52:00,964,"I fished Rainey Lake last fall and boated back to the MN side. I was told by a couple of MN guys at camp that to be technically legal to transport fish on the MN side, you were supposed to transport them as whole fish after gutting and gilling, but not fillets. Not sure how accurate that is. I asked the camp manager about it and he said not to worry about it, so I filleted them out like I always do.Oh yeah, and camp chef makes a good point about needing an RABC (rural access boundary crossing) form."
3481466,joshuatree78,2015-01-26 15:00:00,28,Thanks for the quick reply. Do the fish caught in Canada count towards the MN license possession limit? The MN possession limit is 4 walleye and the Ontario possession limit is 4. As long as I have both the MN and Ontario license would I be able to have 8 walleye in the freezer at camp?Josh
3481546,h8go4s,2015-01-26 15:11:00,1673,"From the 2014 Minnesota regulation booklet, page 55:While in Minnesota, anglers may not possess more than a Minnesota limit of fish from Canada-Minnesota border waters. Fish from Canadian inland waters may be possessed in Minnesota in excess of the Minnesota limit only if the angler has proofsuch as lodging receipts or verification through U.S. Customsthat the fish were taken from inland Canadian waters.Page 56 shows the Rainy Lake limits.Page 27 describes how fish on lakes with size limits must be processed.Check the 2015 booklet before you go."
3481562,Carnhzkr,2015-01-26 15:13:00,964,"No. You get one possession limit. Once you cross into MN, it's assumed all fish in your possession were caught in MN.I see your point, though. It'd be like if you drove into Ont and caught your limit there, then drove back to MN, put the Ont fish in the freezer and went out fishing again. When the MN DNR checks you, you tell him the ones in the freezer are Canadian fish. No way he'll buy that.The only way I know to tell the difference between US and Canadian walleyes is the Canadian ones sprinkle vinegar on their fries."
3481602,joshuatree78,2015-01-26 15:19:00,28,Thanks again for the information. I was hoping to bring home double the number of walleye this year but it doesn't look like that will be the case.Josh
3482378,Guest,2015-01-26 18:13:00,0,Rainy's slot size in !3.8 - 17.8 you can keep on between that size (35 -45 cm) the limit is one per day.
3482426,Obabikon,2015-01-26 18:28:00,2370,"Yeah... you can't take double limits. I'm not sure if Rainy lake has a daily limit of two (like LOTW's does). I will say, don't ever be in a state or province with more fish than their limit allows."
