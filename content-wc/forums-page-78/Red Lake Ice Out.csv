6546716,Skywagon,2021-04-04 18:06:00,1106,"We went to the cabin on Friday, the lake was as low as I have ever seen it, only water going out, little coming in because of the short snowfall this year. The outlet end was open water and a narrows was also open. We spent no more time on the ice then necessary as all the waterflow from the lake comes out in close proximity to the cabin, we did no fishing so did not check ice depth.The picture (of what remains) of a old dock crib is usually under water, the entire first 16' floating dock is sitting on the bottom, we need rain this spring, or landing a boat will be a challenge.A friend flew in Friday afternoon for a short visit after making a run to Red Lake, he landed a long way from the shore for safety's sake."

6546782,Skywagon,2021-04-05 05:03:00,1106,"Not that part of the crib, the rest of it above water had already been dismantled."
6546798,prov1800,2021-04-05 06:57:00,5010,Definatly need some moisture.Have checked out a few launches i use and will be interesting what it all looks like when ice is all gone.
6546802,prov1800,2021-04-05 07:19:00,5010,Such a nice day yesterday so wife and i took a drive to Cliff Lake.Still plenty of ice but shorelines are weak.Water seems to 30-40 ft from where it should be by shore.The feeder creek coming in is b√®ing held back by a beaver dam which has low water on opposite side and just trickling through. Creek is wide open to lake.The ice on lake wont add much water when it does melt basically evaporating.Couple of rainy days coming this week but not a lot moisture on those days.
6545594,LoDo,2021-04-01 15:17:00,721,My builder buddy in RL thinks late April ice out.
6545634,prov1800,2021-04-01 17:04:00,5010,Might be right. Weather is turning warm now.Actually ice still pretty thick.Lets hope it does.Will go quicker 2 hrs south where I am.
6545646,Eckohlt,2021-04-01 18:14:00,3685,"I guess it doesn't matter to much when it goes out to us south of the border,but john keep the updates a coming and pics...I just hope it's out when the border opens"

6545754,Skywagon,2021-04-02 05:05:00,1106,"Pretty boring isn't it? One has to wonder how this situation will effect site participation in the future (from several different standpoints, which I don't dare mention). How much has the stifling effected the entire site's revenue? Meanwhile back on topic... I am heading up to the cabin for a few days to do some work, the cabin is over a 100 miles east of Red Lake, but at about the same latitude, it will be interesting to see how the ice is holding up there, my home lake is starting to pull away in places, safe ice won't last long with the upcoming warm temperatures. The tween season is about upon us."
6545798,Eckohlt,2021-04-02 06:32:00,3685,Keep us posted sky
6545820,LoDo,2021-04-02 07:24:00,721,"I come to this site 2x weekly to see if there is an update, rumor, etc.... on the border. Nothing else matters at this point."
6546054,prov1900,2021-04-02 16:32:00,544,Same here. Even conjecture is worth my time.
