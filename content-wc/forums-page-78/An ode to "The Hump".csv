6549652,Wallychowder,2021-04-12 17:54:00,1567,Thats what I've always said.......There's more than one hump in a lake !!!
6549664,Eckohlt,2021-04-12 18:13:00,3685,There's also more than one boat on a lake
6549408,Bill Krejca,2021-04-12 07:58:00,6107,"Humps can be good at times. Wind can make a difference on fish location( true about everywhere). As indicated, observation of conditions can always be key in replicating a onetime success. Bill"
6549430,prov1800,2021-04-12 08:39:00,5010,Your absolutly right Bill.Wind direction and sun angle have to be kept in mind with time of day you fish and water temps.Over my years of fishing diff lakes and literally having hundreds of humps and having them dissected i can fish them with ease. My gps is loaded with so much info making it so much easier and the spot lock basically gives the fish no chance in any type of weather.It did take a lot of searching and tgat part was the most fun.Wont take much longer now to get out.Boat is pretty much ready to go.Will be lake trout and smallies on those humps i fish in Cliff Lake first.Tgey are sitting ducks.lol.
6549490,gordy28,2021-04-12 11:12:00,437,"Thanks all - glad people enjoyed it I agree about keeping notes and understanding wind On our last two trips we have certainly found that fishing points, islands, humps etc. that are being hit or influenced by wind (or current) can really turn on the fish Also found that if there has been consistent and sustained waves and current into structure that can really turn it into a ""walleye magnet"" Cheers Andrew"
6549506,v-bay gord,2021-04-12 11:42:00,3168,"Before the advent of GPS finding ""the hump"" took some triangulation skills. Not sure how anglers found them before the advent of sonar. Good article!"
6549538,prov1800,2021-04-12 12:49:00,5010,I think lots went untouched for many years.The ones I remember finding were the humps i hit downrigginÄ£ for trout.Going back and checking it what you got hung up on.then like you said Gord.Doing some triangling to figure out how to come back to it later with some landmarks.But those places produced as they still do today but somewhat busier now.Taking guests to a prime hump like that was a amazing treat back then.
6549576,Eckohlt,2021-04-12 14:18:00,3685,"It's know fun racing in the morning to a spot trying to be the first ones there,then worry about others showing up to move on in,that's where the float planes are worth there weight in gold,gotta pay for privacy but it's worth every penny,my motto is, I see thousands of people daily,when I go to Ontario I'll.be dammed if I'm going to fish in a crowd,late late fall in Ontario is about the only time you can go to a drive in lake and pretty much have it all to yourself"
6549588,v-bay gord,2021-04-12 15:07:00,3168,"True, but some fun can be derived by being part of the 10% of anglers who actually can catch fish on that hump. As Andrew illustrated it's one thing to find the hump, it's another to understand when, where and how to fish it depending on a variety of conditions. I will say that you can have any lake to yourself if you just avoid other anglers....but I do get the draw for remoteness."
6549598,Golden Eagle,2021-04-12 15:37:00,2642,"I have a favorite hump on my favorite lake. Very little boat traffice travels over it. When another boat seems to be heading my way, I toss out a marker with a short line. I continue to fish near the marker as it floats away from the hump. My company usually leaves after about 20 minutes or so."
6549624,prov1800,2021-04-12 16:47:00,5010,Rod.Big lakes have a lot of room like Eagle and Lac suel. Smaller lakes tend to be busier but mostly where camps show you spots on the lake.All camps have the same map and spots so they get congested .Plenty of other places to fish that don't get pounded for 5 months
6549634,Eckohlt,2021-04-12 17:29:00,3685,"I quit fishing lac suel years ago when verbal fights started breaking out over dock space,it was a mess and I'm sure the lake has a lot more boat traffic these days,but I do understand it's a huge and you probably can find secluded spots,probably not spring time but later in the year,I have friends that do house boat on opening and every year there's arguments on the water,just not for me,last 2 trips I was on in late fall was at holinshead lake and barrington lake resort I was the only fisherman,I did fish gull rock a few years back mid sept that was like a ant hill but only the ants were boats lol,so I'm done there lol.I do try and stay away from huge bodies of water in the fall cause that can be some nasty nasty weather and it's no fun sitting in the cabin looking at the lake get tore up"
6549210,gordy28,2021-04-11 15:26:00,437,I have already talked about my love of a good spot name I think its because all any trip needs to go from good to great is the right spot On our 2016 trip to Shekak Lake we ended up finding that spot - and for my boat partner and I it coughed up some great and even a little bit of epic Newest post is uphttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/humping-around Cheers Andrew
6549288,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2021-04-11 20:53:00,240,"Thanks, Andrew. I enjoy and appreciate your work! (I thought maybe the site was down--there have been fewer than 5 or 10 posts total in the past few days.)Looking forward to seeing more of your blogging and photography. Even more, look forward to dropping a line in Onepine Lake and catching that first batch of walleye!"
6549358,Eckohlt,2021-04-12 06:24:00,3685,This site is a ghost town just like n.w Ontario
6549360,HeHooksHimself,2021-04-12 06:27:00,725,"Thanks for the post, I appreciate how you can instantly stir me to recall several ""hump"" experiences. Memorable ones in Woman River, Big Woman Lake, Dominion Lake and a ""secret"" one in Wine Lake. I would sure like to get back to them. Nice work as usual."
6549364,prov1800,2021-04-12 06:34:00,5010,Good post.Love when fish start heading to the humps.
6549368,Wallychowder,2021-04-12 06:43:00,1567,"thats what i said the other day ! They dont let you discuss certain Topics ? Makes it boring. By the way , what kind of frozen pizza do you like ?...........Lol."
6549370,kettyspanky,2021-04-12 06:44:00,271,I enjoyed your post. Brings back some memories for me as well with a few ( hotspots). Hoping to be able to get back to them soon. Think positive.
6549372,prov1800,2021-04-12 06:46:00,5010,"Been a ghost town last few days.Like winter today.Snow,rain and winds.Ugly out.Everything is soaked.Shoukdnt have any fires for a while and lakes will rise a bit now.Supposed to go out Wednesday for some walleye in a small boat that will be last day of walleye season till the opener.Will see if we go.Ugly weather continues this week.Some lakes are mostly open now which is real early.Been cleaning my rods and reels so there ready use When i get out there."
6549394,Eckohlt,2021-04-12 07:31:00,3685,"Hopefully we all can join the eyes on the humps sometime this year,wheather it's summer or fall I'll be there,even late late fall,get the big girls"
6549404,prov1800,2021-04-12 07:52:00,5010,Hope all goes well and ill see you out there.Going to hang out at home todiay and clean a couple of more reels.Amazin how dirty they get and the rods.Washed them with soap and water yesterday.Wont need my muskie stuff for a while but just oiled them.Abu sent me 2 new spinning reels and ill take them apart and get grease out and then oil the gears.
