6543994,gordy28,2021-03-28 14:43:00,437,Thanks for all of the great feedback everyone I enjoyed the writing and the learning. I also like that I have a new bucket list lake and lodge on my list - VBL! Cheers and again many thanks to Gord - he's a better writer than I am so it was one of the easier posts I have ever done Andrew
6544354,lassh,2021-03-29 15:12:00,553,Nice interview. I too respect Bay Gord's experience and advice.

6543594,gordy28,2021-03-27 11:03:00,437,Since my first Tales from with Chris Brock seemed to get some solid feedback I wanted to do another This time is an interview with Gord Bastable or as known here - VBay GordI am always wondered about the life of a lodge owner and have even dreamed a little bit of packing in my day job and running a campThe interview was enjoyable and an eye opener (not sure I am capable of running a lodge lol) https://www.northernjacks.com/post/tales-from-the-lodgeCheers and thanks for readingAndrew
6543624,pnnylfr,2021-03-27 12:31:00,114,Good read. Thank you.
6543632,That Minnesota guy,2021-03-27 13:02:00,8293,"I was fortunate enough to be invited as part of a group to VBL. I really can't say enough good things about the lodge without sounding like a employee. Susanne & Gord were great hosts. Cabins were very nice and much more than I expected. Docks and boats are well kept. Main lodge is clean and comfortable as well.I believe that the Lodge is the only one that is on the Pink Flamingo migration and provides a bit of a distraction from fishing if that kind of stuff interests you. Great folks, great location, great accommodations. I highly recommend them."
6543682,prov1800,2021-03-27 16:04:00,5010,It seemed last year the pink flamingo flock took a different route
6543696,That Minnesota guy,2021-03-27 16:57:00,8293,Sorry to hear that. Maybe they will be back this year.
6543744,KC Walleye,2021-03-27 18:30:00,274,Awesome read Andrew and Gord. Thanks for bringing a positive post to the forum!
6543802,pjshorthorn,2021-03-28 04:32:00,5654,Great article !!!! Thanks for writing it and sharing Lord Gord's perspective on lodge ownership and some other tidbits from the inner workings of his brain. I do have to admit that Gord sounded much more intelligent and articulate in the article than he does in person ........ PjShorthorn
6543834,v-bay gord,2021-03-28 07:03:00,3168,"PJ...they do say fish is brain food, and I ate a lot of it last summer. My suggestion is that everyone eat more of it while we wait for the border to reopen."
6543870,Bstar,2021-03-28 08:37:00,564,Great interview! I always respect Gord's input on this forum.
6543954,Fisherman Ted,2021-03-28 11:47:00,461,As do I. Always learning from him.
