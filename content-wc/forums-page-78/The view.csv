6548032,HeHooksHimself,2021-04-08 07:49:00,725,"Could be deceptive, but the water level doesn't look particularly low. Have you had some rain?"
6548140,Skywagon,2021-04-08 11:17:00,1106,"That photo of the lake is deceptive, the picture only shows high rock shoreline with a steep drop. I just walked down to our small bay (adjacent to the house) to see if it was possible to float the boat and/or plane out in the water via the rail systems, it is very doubtful. The drainage tile shown in the pictures is now around 2 feet above the lake level, normally at this time of year tile is a foot or more below the surface. We need rain."

6548704,prov1800,2021-04-09 13:55:00,5010,We have been having rain last couple days Bill.Looks like a few more days yet.Woods were very dry so now they got some moisture your right dont need any fires yet.I can live with low water but hate fires.
