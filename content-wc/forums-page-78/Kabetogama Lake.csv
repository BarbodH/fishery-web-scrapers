Rained, sun, snow had it all. nice looking lake. we didnot do so well fishing but we got 2 walleye meals out of it. Very uncomfortable furniture. the log built with very thin cushions. we sat on pillows. If we go again I am going to bring the patio cushions from my house."
6538388,1shooter,2021-03-15 07:50:00,1493,We must have been there the same time as you and had similar fishing experience....weather was working against us. Figured it wasn't always that bad so went back up early September. The day we got there it was 70 degrees. The next night it was 28 degrees and windy. Needless the say the fish just did not want to bite.
6540448,Tom8279,2021-03-19 08:07:00,17,"Kabetogama is hands down my favorite lake! I’ve stayed at arrowhead lodge and northern lights, both are great places to stay. Arrowhead lodge is a family owned and operated resort and they are all wonderful people! Lol tell them the guy who’s wheels fell off his RV on the way up said so! I bet they will remember me! They really went out of their way to turn my trip around! I also love camping on the islands on Kab too! I’m plannng on making a camping trip up there this June before the mayflies hatch. Oh, and the fishing is generally really good in my opinion. I caught my first walleye on kabetogama and also my personal best so far, 25”. I’m a transplant to Minnesota from Mississippi and it took me some time to figure out walleye fishing, so 25” was a heck of an accomplishment after starting from scratch!"
6543144,Kevin R,2021-03-26 04:34:00,305,"[QUOTE=rather-be-fishin;6533686 It has multi species Walleye, Sauger, Northern, Perch, Blue Gills, Bass, Sturgeon, Burbot. RBF[/QUOTE]It has Blue Gill are you sure about that I live on the lake never heard that before or caught one."
6543164,Tom8279,2021-03-26 06:21:00,17,"I’ve personally never caught a bluegill on Kabetogama. Never targeted them either though, but you’d think we would’ve caught one at some point if there was a decent population of them."
6543172,GBS,2021-03-26 07:10:00,2271,"Been going to Kab for a very long time. A couple of years ago we made the run into the near portion of Nam, where I did catch two dinner plate sized 'gills. No more after that, although we tried hard. Resort owner said they were the first he'd ever seen....so there are a few in the system, with emphasis on ""few"". What is interesting is that for the last several years the jumbo perch population seems to be growing. For many, many early years never saw one. Now it has become routine to get several as ""by catch"" when hunting walleye in the same areas we've always fished. Last year, we even had to look up possession limits for perch, just in case...."
6543176,Tom8279,2021-03-26 07:25:00,17,"Good info, thank you! I can’t wait to get up there this year! I’ve never been over to the narrows between Kab and Namakan. I’ll make it a point to check it out when I go."
6544428,Baseline,2021-03-29 18:51:00,3207,"I've spent a lot of time on the whole Voyagers Park chain of lakes and never caught a Blue Gill, but I have caught a ton of crappies. Gills live in the same habitats that crappie use. There are Gills in Loon, Basswood and all the other lakes that lead to Crane so I believe there has to be a population of Gills in all the lakes."
6534822,Shawn200m,2021-03-05 17:03:00,40,"Birch is a good option in the Ely area. It's big, but skinny with a lot of bays so it doesn't fish like big water. It's a dammed portion of the Kiwishiwi river and flows into white Iron, farm, garden and then fall lakes. Vermillion is a good choice also. It's big but has a lot of islands to hide behind, especially on the west side. I haven't walleye fished there for years, but I fish musky there every fall and there are some giants in there."
6534836,Baseline,2021-03-05 17:17:00,3207,"With the exception of one day 25 years ago spent on Garden and Little Garden Lake I've never fished the rest of the Chain so I can't help you with fishing information. I have spent lots of time fishing other lakes in the area including many trips into the BWCA. You and your group will enjoy the Ely area. The lakes aren't ever crowded and have a wild country feel. Ely has some great restaurants and a couple new brew pubs. For the rainy days there are also several attractions ""Wolf Center"" , ""Bear Center"", Dorthy Molter Cabins, and, if you are a history buff, the Winton Museum located on the campus of Vermillion Community College. There is also a world class underground mine tour in Tower/Sudan, MN."
6536152,danvan18$,2021-03-09 14:49:00,67,Thanks for all the information- appreciate it. We have decided on Big Lake Wilderness Lodge to replace our first Canada trip. It won't be like fishing in Canada but at least we will get to go somewhere this year and it will be pretty remote. Maybe our Aug/Sept trip to Canada will be a go....
6536154,Wallychowder,2021-03-09 14:53:00,1567,Something Did ?
6536168,That Minnesota guy,2021-03-09 15:20:00,8293,Their is nothing wrong with Mille Lacs. The lake is full of all species of fish. The issue on Mille Lacs is the management of it. But I suspect you know that.
6536174,Wallychowder,2021-03-09 15:30:00,1567,Oh yeah i know. I remember it being known for night fishing with lighted bobbers back when you could actually get a limit of walleye.
6536232,Shawn200m,2021-03-09 18:18:00,40,"Big Lake will give you the Canada feel for sure. It's way outside of Ely on the Echo Trail and doesn't get a lot of public fishing pressure because of the location and proximity of so many other lakes in the Ely area. Fishing can be decent for walleyes. If you want a fun side trip, drop your boats into Ed Shave Lake off the Echo Trail. It's loaded with 15"" walleye. You probably won't catch anything over 18"", but you'll have a fun day and probably won't see another boat all day. Have fun!"
6536258,gbin,2021-03-09 19:34:00,1384,"Sounds as if the data say otherwise:https://www.outdoornews.com/2019/05/...water-clarity/Quote: Originally Posted by WallychowderOh yeah i know.

6536310,danvan18$,2021-03-10 07:14:00,67,Thanks Shawn- we don't have boats but maybe we can figure something out to try it.
6536352,rather-be-fishin,2021-03-10 09:48:00,429,Looks like a nice resort & lake. Good luck on your trip & please post an update when you return. RBF
6534658,That Minnesota guy,2021-03-05 12:46:00,8293,"Never heard of White Iron Beach, what lake is that on? Have you checked Ash-Ka-Nam resort 218-374-3181 they have very large cabins. They are ion the Ash River Trail which is mid way between Kab & Nam. Don't know if they have openings for your time slot but you can check. As mentioned try Kab. Outdoors to rent boats. They have several."
6534688,danvan18$,2021-03-05 13:37:00,67,"Thanks for the information, we have decided to try to fish something smaller given the makeup of our group this year.White Iron lake at White Iron Beach resort- a chain of lakes near Ely, MN"
6534690,That Minnesota guy,2021-03-05 13:42:00,8293,Have fun.
6534696,Shawn200m,2021-03-05 13:49:00,40,"White Iron is on a chain that includes Garden, Farm and South Farm lakes. South Farm is in the BWCA. I used to fish that chain a lot before transitioning to Canada. It's a beautiful chain of lakes, but the fishing is tough. Some small walleyes and a bunch of hammer handle pike in the bays are common. Silver rapids can hold some bigger walleyes at times, but you really have to work for them. White Iron beach resort is very close to silver rapids, which connects white Iron to Farm lake. Nice resort, just have realistic expectations for the fishing."
6534710,gbin,2021-03-05 14:06:00,1384,"Thanks to zebra mussels, I assume... Gerry"
6534716,danvan18$,2021-03-05 14:11:00,67,"Thanks for the response, kinda what i was thinking. Beautiful area with little fish"
6534720,Wallychowder,2021-03-05 14:21:00,1567,Yep ruined a very good walleye lake ! I remember being out there in my little crestliner with a 10 horse (yep a 10 horse) watching Gary Roach and also watching Griz fish. I learned alot on that lake.
6534724,That Minnesota guy,2021-03-05 14:30:00,8293,"Just curious, did they ruin Mille Lacs?"
6534764,rather-be-fishin,2021-03-05 15:35:00,429,"I am assuming you have contacted all the resorts on Kabetogama, there are quite a few. Have you looked at Crane Lake? www.visitcranelake.com It Is on chain of lakes that goes into Kabetogama. Have you considered Lake Vermilion by Tower & Cook, MN? There are lots of resorts on that lake plus Fortune Bay Casino & Marina. Or Birch Lake, Timber Bay Lodge & Houseboats Resort https://timberbay.com/ by Babbit MN, they have some big cabins also rent boats, Pontoons & House Boats. There is another resort River Point Resort https://riverpointresort.com/ also on Birch Lake up by Ely side too. Birch lake is 20 miles long & narrow & flows into White Iron Lake. It’s is mostly surrounded by Superior National Forest with small amounts of cabins on it, so would have a Canadian feel. It Has Walleye, Northern, Crappie, Sun fish & Bass. Good luck! RBF"
6534780,danvan18$,2021-03-05 15:56:00,67,"Thank you RBF- we are looking at most of those now. We have some rookies, so bigger water might be an issue for them in the bigger boats."
6533758,prov1900,2021-03-03 15:38:00,544,"We fished it last June as a same week replacement for LOW. I used to fish it often but the Canada bug hit. We had a good week there. Like mentioned earlier, the slot walleyes were everywhere and they were very nice fish. We caught enough to eat for a couple of small fish fry's, but weren't into eating walleyes that much that week. I probably spent more time focusing on smallies and caught lots of incidental walleyes. I would guess the week you are going, you should hit it really good. Wind is a real factor on certain days, as mentioned earlier. I will say this about Kab. First time I fished it ever, like 20 years ago if it matters, we caught more fish than I ever have in Canada. I think it is rebounding to those previous days. As far as scenery goes, you will not know the difference. It is a beautiful lake."
6534006,NARDA 1,2021-03-04 07:48:00,636,"Fished Kabetogama out of Kec's Kove last year, 9/3 -9/10 probably couldn't have picked a worse week for weather, so fishing wasn't great. Don't know that we could have picked a better Resort though, Larry and Viv were excellent hosts and took great care of us, very nice cabins and equipment, the food at the lodge was also excellent! It was our first time there and we were treated like family. We have a reservation there for this year in case the border doesn't open."
6534030,RRK285,2021-03-04 08:55:00,44,"My Canada group went to Kab last year mid june and it was as awful as a trip could be. Very high winds the first couple days, followed by 85-90 degrees the last few days. Water temps were higher on Kab then southern Wi at the time. Almost all Smallies were already long gone from the shallows. Caught some bigger walleyes casting for pike and smallies. 1 big pike and the rest tiny snakes. Even the diehard walleye guys were struggling all around us. An absolutely beautiful lake though. I may go back one day to houseboat or camp. We are going to Vermillion this year."
6534134,gbin,2021-03-04 12:59:00,1384,"Am I correct in thinking that Kabetogama is a lake with very clear water, like Burntside?Gerry"
6534154,Baseline,2021-03-04 13:57:00,3207,"Most people will be fishing Tom Cod Bay or in that vicinity. It is definitely an advantage to stay at the resorts on the west end of the lake (Ray, MN) that time of year. If you are staying on the Ash River Trail you more likely will fish the Namakan Channel or going into Namakan. It's long run up to the west end of Kab and usually very bumpy that time of year. Mid to late May is probably the best time of the year for Walleyes. Smallmouth can be located casting the big rocky points over 10 to 15 FOW, but don't count on a great bite that early. Walleyes can be had with just about any presentation - jigs, spinners, cranks, slip bobber. Another advantage to staying on the west end of the Lake is the dominate wind usually comes from the northwest and drives the wind day after day in to the south shore. The evening dock fishing for walleyes can be amazing. It can be hard to get a spot on the docks in the afternoon and evenings with all the guests fishing there."
6534170,That Minnesota guy,2021-03-04 14:20:00,8293,"No, I wouldn't consider it clear."
6534316,Shawn200m,2021-03-04 19:15:00,40,"It's bog stained water like Rainy, Namakan and other lakes in that area. Burnside is much, much clearer by comparison."

6534610,danvan18$,2021-03-05 10:58:00,67,"Thanks for all your responses- appreciate it. Because of our group size now the Kab option is out. But we're looking at White Iron Beach resort now. Also checked out Big Lake Resort. It's difficult now trying to find boats and cabins for 7-8, lot of places full. I think Canada will have a permanent business loss as a result of not being able to cross.Any comments on White Iron Beach resort would be great...."
6534614,Wallychowder,2021-03-05 11:09:00,1567,Lake Winnie is clear.....never used to be !
6533656,danvan18$,2021-03-03 11:52:00,67,"With our Canadian trips most likely doomed for this year we have an opportunity to go Kabetogama the week of 5/22 or 5/29. Nice boats and cabin available. Anyone have experience fishing here this time of year?Finding most Northern MN lodges booked for June.We know it is not Canada, but just looking for a fun place to fish as we missed last year going anywhere as well. Thanks"
6533670,Eckohlt,2021-03-03 12:16:00,3685,She's going to be a go sometime this year Dan don't give up yet
6533672,danvan18$,2021-03-03 12:25:00,67,"You're always positive that's nice to see these days. But I think it will be quite awhile before it opens up, maybe later this summer/fall? They may want their citizens vaccinated before tourists can come in."
6533686,rather-be-fishin,2021-03-03 12:38:00,429,"I know people that have fished Kabetogama ever year for 30+ years now & they say May & June are the best time of year to fish it. It has multi species Walleye, Sauger, Northern, Perch, Blue Gills, Bass, Sturgeon, Burbot. It would be a good idea to hire a guide the first day to put you on fish & techniques that work. It would help make your trip a success. It won’t be fast & furious fishing like Canada & you will have to work for them, but it will have a Canadian feel to it. I fished it many years ago & am also looking to go there this summer, because I’m also doubting the border will open for our Canadian trip to Lac Seul. Where are you staying? RBF"
6533688,danvan18$,2021-03-03 12:43:00,67,"We have a courtesy hold at Northern Lights for now. We're hoping to decide tomorrow if we will go or not.I'm a little intimidated by the size of the water, much bigger than we're used to."
6533714,kswalleyer,2021-03-03 13:45:00,1651,"Was up there 3 years ago first week of June. thats a stunning lake, stayed right by Northern Lights. bottom bouncers. At that time I ""think "" I recall we were fishing in 15-18 feet of water on main lake points and good dropoffs. Just highlight your fishing range on your graph and get after it. That lake has a lot of fun structure. we caught a lot of slots. a suspending jerk bait woked will in evening thrown at banks with good structure."
6533720,That Minnesota guy,2021-03-03 14:00:00,8293,You will enjoy it. Wind can be challenging sometimes but there are islands to tuck behind if you can get there. Book it Dano!
6533732,danvan18$,2021-03-03 14:25:00,67,"That's why I like going to Canada, don't have to know much about catching walleye, they bite on everything and just about every spot is ""good""...."
6533748,That Minnesota guy,2021-03-03 15:10:00,8293,"Kab isn't that good ( as Canada), but you put in the work and you will find fish."
6533752,38bill,2021-03-03 15:26:00,331,The lake is long and narrow with bays so its pretty easy to fish. We always went out on the north west side near the public campground (Wooden Frog). We would always plan around the memorial day weekend and camped. It can be plenty cold at that time but we always caught fish. I haven't been there in a few years but my brother in-law has and the biggest issue they had was catching fish to eat as they were too big and had to be released due to the slot limit.PS: We quit camping there because of the darn bears.
