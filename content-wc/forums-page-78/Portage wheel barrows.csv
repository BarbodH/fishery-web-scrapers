6546450,Eckohlt,2021-04-03 19:01:00,3685,"You forgot, they need to carry a motor also.but I don't think it's a 150 horse"
6546460,Eckohlt,2021-04-03 19:16:00,3685,"There are no deck hands,he's going to a fly in lake and then to a portage lake"
6546462,RichA$1970,2021-04-03 19:20:00,1159,. I meant the deckhands at the base loading the planes. 1.2m to portage makes me wonder what’s wrong with the main lake.
6546466,Eckohlt,2021-04-03 19:28:00,3685,"I have friends that fished the main lake he's going to,they didn't have to much to say about it,probably at the end of July nobody is going anywhere,we need a miracle"
6546482,RichA$1970,2021-04-03 20:47:00,1159,Was he the one going to Roderick and Miller with Chimo?
6546498,skimottaret,2021-04-04 04:27:00,40,"Thanks guys, yeah I am a touch concerned about the ribbing we will (rightly) get turning up with something like this but they break down and flat pack so can sort of hide it from the plane loaders Chimo has a generous 150lb allowance and we should easily be able to get this thing in within our 300lb team limit.Our original plan was for two weeks at Roderick 16-30 July but decided a few weeks ago to move the trip forward by a week in the slim hope that the border opens up on the 21 July. I have pretty much given up on a June opening and didn't want to miss out fishing the first week. Roderick was full up the following week and only thing that the Chimo folks had left was Miller lake. We are hearing that Miller is quite shallow and the walleyes hunker down in early August and not much action. I guess it was the only lake available for a reason but better to be fishing than not is our thinking !! Trophy lake is a very long portage from Miller but we hear worth it from a few reports and I would kick myself if we didn't at least try it. If the fishing is loads better we may end up doing the portage daily and with my bum knees may prove difficult hence looking into carts. Last time we did portages backpacks were fine but the gas cans were the main challenge. Might not be an issue but I am also thinking if the motor left at the portage lake hasn't been run for a few years we may need to swap out with one from the main lake which has three boats.The two wheel deer carts I saw online were pretty heavy as designed to take 500lbs but will have another look. Also the portage trails I have been on were very narrow footpaths and I thought the two wheelers may be too wide..."
6546534,v-bay gord,2021-04-04 07:17:00,3168,"I'm just wondering with all the amazing opportunities that exist for fly in, remote fishing why you are picking a spot that requires you to hump supplies over a mile to access what you are seeking. Perhaps the challenge is what you are after....I understand the allure. If, on the other hand it is the fishing, then perhaps fly to a lake that has what you want....or at least has the equipment already on any portage lakes they offer."
6546180,skimottaret,2021-04-03 06:34:00,40,This may sound pretty lame but does anyone use any form of wheel barrow or game cart when doing long portages? We are on a lake that has a 1.2mile portage hike and carrying all the gear and gas may be tough (I just had both knees replaced). I used a big back pack last time out and was okay but gas can (potentially a motor) and poles might be too rough on the new pins. A lot of bank fishermen use these sort of things when going from car to ponds here in the UK. Lightest I have seen is 20lbs and fold flat which is a lot of weight for a fly in but if it allows us to get into remote portage lakes might be worth it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVpNpj7PD8QAnyone tried anything similar and if so did it work out or just was a PITA ?
6546198,Eckohlt,2021-04-03 06:56:00,3685,"Depends on how clean the trail is,sometimes there mess with mud and downfall"
6546210,skimottaret,2021-04-03 07:17:00,40,Yeah i agree some of the portage trails can be pretty mucky/swampy or occasional boulders to scramble up. but my thinking is worst case just hump the gear round the bad sections.
6546214,Bill Krejca,2021-04-03 07:36:00,6107,"Going back a few years, we used to portage into a lake in Sask. We'd boat across the main lake and then move several smaller 14' boats into the hot walleye lake. The portage was made somewhat? easier due to the path being once p/o a winter road before the regular road was extended, so supplies for a reserve were trucked over the ice and over the portage path. The reason I'm sharing the situation is that portages are normally not this cleared of trees and brush, as was this one. Anyway, a fairly low slung 2- wheeled cart was manufactured at home utilizing a sheet of plywood, maybe 4x5 or so, an axel was secured to the bottom of the platform, and some motorcycle wheels/tires were attached. Straps held the boat on the platform, +/-. The boat was loaded with items needed and away we went, first going up a rather steep, but not impossible climb from the big lake. It is amazing how many path rocks one can get familiar with during a 3/8 mile push-pull exercise. Having 2 boats to move, the exercise did take awhile, going back not being as much fun. So, a contraption can be manufactured, using a little ingenuity, little initial cost, and some amount of upfront work. Prior planning includes inviting some really strong young guys to join the fun, this is an important ingredient for overall success. Corneille Lake from Mirond Lake, in case curious. Bill"
6546286,maddogg,2021-04-03 10:19:00,178,"Every portage I've ever taken was always up hill. And what unit of measure do camp owners use to measure the distance of the portage? It can't be meters or yards,maybe it's minutes."
6546318,Eckohlt,2021-04-03 12:51:00,3685,Ya sometime's it's up hill both ways
6546350,Eckohlt,2021-04-03 14:50:00,3685,"That's going to cut into a lot of fishing time,sounds like work unless your in your 20's,any chance to find a new place to go?,if your knee buckles on you during the portage you might get to ride the wheel barrow"
6546392,Shellback,2021-04-03 16:54:00,8083,Go with a 2 wheel deer cart. A single wheel makes you work harder doing a balancing act. Also get a cart with the largest wheel size. Easier to get over obstacles.
6546412,kzoofisher,2021-04-03 17:47:00,5144,I use a two wheel deer cart for a half mile portage near my cabin. I put blocks on it so it holds the canoe straight and then load my gear in the canoe. Works great. You'll need plenty of bungee cord to keep your gear from falling off. Or a cargo bag. You've probably already though of having whatever you buy shipped right to the outfitter. They might be able to fly it in early for you if they have a light group. https://mixwholesale.com/products/ca...CABEgIitfD_BwE
6546444,RichA$1970,2021-04-03 18:58:00,1159,Pack light for the portage. A backpack should cover everything and it will hold a pole. If you have to carry A gallon or 2.5 g can so be it. 1.2m portage trail must be some great fishing vs the lake you are on.
