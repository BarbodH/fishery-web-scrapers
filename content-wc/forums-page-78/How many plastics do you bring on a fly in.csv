6545264,prov1800,2021-04-01 07:39:00,5010,Iam not really into plastics allthough ill bring a few.On drive in lakes with pressure there is nothing like minnows which seem to work best.Ive tried plastics when the bite was nuts and allthough you will catch some the catch rate goes way down.On fly outs you can use a gigarette butt and catch fish but flyinns i go to have a unlimited an mount of minnows and if i would ever run out or gettired of putting bait on i have used walleye gullets which work just fine and can be used all day.Never come off unless a pike chews your line off.Takes 5 seconds to get a gullet out from the fish your going to eat.
6545350,danvan18$,2021-04-01 08:52:00,67,Are using walleye gullets legal?
6545372,adempsey2.0,2021-04-01 09:19:00,611,"Yes, at least in Ontario. I am not sure in other provinces. Parts of fish not suitable for human consumption can be used as bait. So, you cannot use a whole live yellow perch, but you could use the eyes or gullet etc. You also cannot catch a fish just to harvest parts for bait, as that is prohibited by the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act. Using fish parts is not permitted in every FMZ/waterbody in Ontario, so you need to check the regulations."
6545522,prov1800,2021-04-01 12:34:00,5010,Thx for explaining that. Years ago you couldn't but been ok now for a number of years.Works amazingly well.out performs plastic 10-1.and it's free.
6544298,Wallychowder,2021-03-29 12:14:00,1567,If you can find these TAKE THEM ! take note of the color! !
6544302,adempsey2.0,2021-03-29 12:32:00,611,"If I am focusing on Walleye, probably 15 packs of grubs and 15 packs of paddletail/twitch minnows. Maybe more. Far more than I would ever need. Part of the problem is that I usually have something new I want to try as well as the old standbys. If it is earlier in the season, I take more in the 3"" range. Later in the season, more in the 4 and 5"" range. I probably fish with paddletails more than twister tails these days as well. Not for any particular reason. For colors, I have a natural color (white, shad), some more neutral colors (brown, green, copper) and some brighter colors (pink, purple, chartreuse, firetiger or a mix of these). White and pink are my go to colors, including pink with white/purple/chartreuse. If those do not perform, I go natural and maybe copper. My go to twister tails are Yum and Zoom. I really like the Yamamoto products, but they don't last at all. The BassPro XPS grubs are good too. For paddletails, Northland Paddletail Minnows, Berkley Ripple Shad and Berkley Grass Pig Jr. I have a bunch of others as well, but they all work well. The Berkley Grass Pig line is good and cheap. For twitch tail minnows, I like the Lunker City Fin-S line, Berkley Powerbait and Gulp. Gulp is a PITA so I am moving more toward Powerbait these days. I probably have a ton of others, I would have to go look. Again, they all perform very similarly."
6544352,lassh,2021-03-29 15:06:00,553,"It's really easy to go overboard with the plastics. If you take what you think you might need, you could easily end up with 3 and a half pounds of plastics that you couldn't use up in a season much less a week.I try to limit walleye plastics to around 50 tails. I take my plastics out of the vendor packs and put them with like colors in small zip lock bags I get at container store or clearbags online. I bring 6 white, 5 black, 10 brown/root beer, 6 pink/pink white, 3 yellow, 4 chartreuse, 3 orange, 8 minnow/silver colored shad style and 5 bright colored ringworms or paddle tails. If I'm going to use orange or orange tipped brown tails, I will use a light wire leader tied directly to the jig because Mr. Pike seems to home in on the orange. I also bring some large money minnow swim baits for pike (walleye eat them too) 3 large orange and 3 large white tails to tip weedless spoons and some super glue to mend torn plastics. I used to jig 80% of the time and troll 20% and only bottom bounce when absolutely necessary. However now I probably pull spinners 50% of the time just because its so effective at locating and catching scattered fish so I never come close to using up my plastics. Even if I jigged all the time I would not run out."
6544494,Twins_dad,2021-03-30 04:24:00,38,"Also, a pack of Z Man TRD Ned rig baits."
6544516,Net_Man,2021-03-30 06:57:00,580,"Just to add to thought for your stock. One afternoon a rookie attached a 8"" white worm to his jig and started to slay the walleyes during a slow bite. The 1st fish I thought was a fluke. When he caught 3 in a row I asked him kindly for one."
6544620,johnboat,2021-03-30 11:29:00,2014,What!?Nobody brings up the 4-5 inch ringworms?White and orange.
6544638,Eckohlt,2021-03-30 12:31:00,3685,I bring real worms......big arse worms n lots of them
6544644,gordy28,2021-03-30 12:50:00,437,I have wanted to try the Authentx Moxie - not sure if that qualifies as a ring worm or not Have never ordered as I cannot find them in Canada. Ordering from US ends up bringing the price to more than I am willing to pay for a plastic lol - what can I say I am frugal
6545104,Pooch,2021-03-31 19:17:00,4618,"A big YES to the Authentex Moxie! Not sure why, but walleye do seem to like them at times. I've told the story numerous times when fishing LS a few years ago I couldn't buy a walleye on minnows, leeches or worms and jigs or spinners. Out of frustration put a Moxy on my jig and immediately started catching fish. Don't care as to the ""why"" but it has worked numerous times since. Pooch"
6545130,kzoofisher,2021-03-31 19:48:00,5144,"I figure 5 fish per plastic average between them getting torn up, bit off and lost in the rocks. That might be a little too conservative but running out is a big disappointment. Throw in a variety of colors and styles because you don't know what will be ""hot"" and that's a bunch of plastics. Not a big deal for me as I fish them a ton at home anyway and the jigs weigh a lot more than the bodies."
6544116,acplumber,2021-03-29 05:44:00,80,Hi ive been looking over my stock for our next fly-in for next year to Ara lake and i need to go shopping. Typically how many packs of mister twister or what ever brand u prefer do you bring on your trip. Cabelas(canada) used to have big variety packs but theres nothing on their site right now. So i may have to bring individual packs. Personally ive found black yellow and white work the best. Thx
6544128,gordy28,2021-03-29 06:18:00,437,Overall I bring around 7 or 8 bags of plastics 1) Six inch grub for tipping spoons 4 or 5 - 4 inch grubs - Yum or Mr Twister 2 or 3 paddle tail swimbaits - typically 3.5 or 4 inch Generally this is way more than enough - even if I need to pass some on to another group member Cheers Andrew
6544144,MrSimon,2021-03-29 06:58:00,922,I take almost exactly what gordy28 said above.
6544228,Crede,2021-03-29 09:44:00,134,For a 7 day fly in mostly jigging for walleye: PowerBait 3 grub - 4 Northland Impulse Paddletail 3.8 - 3 Northland Impulse Minnow 3 - 2 B Fish N Moxie 3 - 2 Big Joshy 3.25 swimbait (A local company) - 4 About 1/2 the packs come home unopened. I just never know which ones those will be.
6544236,Mojo-NC,2021-03-29 10:00:00,1929,"Are you or anyone else willing to share your favorite colors? I generally use chartreuse, white, gold, pumpkinseed, brown (especially during a mayfly hatch), purple, and red flake. I also like pink, but generally avoid it if there are many toothy critters around."
6544254,Crede,2021-03-29 10:27:00,134,"For me: PowerBait grubs - White (1), Pumpkinseed orange tail (1), Chartreuse (1), Firetiger (1) Northland Impulse Paddletails - White (2) and Electric chicken (1) Northland Impulse minnows - White (1) and Shad (1) Moxies - White (1) and Black (1) Big Joshy Swimbait - White (2), Green glow perch (1), Lemon Shad (Chartreuse)(1) I usually start each day with white (on a contrasting jig head) and then try something else if things slow down."
6544266,danvan18$,2021-03-29 11:12:00,67,"The answer for our group is way too many! We call this PBS- plastic bait syndrome. The go to is the Berkley powerbait ripple shad series-multiple packs of every color. But there is a competition to see if someone brings something that no one else has that might do better than the ""go to"" ripple shad."
6544284,Mojo-NC,2021-03-29 11:30:00,1929,"Thanks for sharing your colors Crede! Danvan, that's our running joke too. If one of us just happens to have the hot bait that no one else has, it is always our last one (whether it is or not) to drive up the price for sharing with our fishing colleagues. The price is usually negotiated in beers and/or bourbon. Fun times!"
6544288,danvan18$,2021-03-29 11:47:00,67,"That's great to hear that it is not only us that play this game. One year it was these soft plastics from Wake were hot, now they are just ""another"" one in the tackle box."
6544292,gordy28,2021-03-29 11:58:00,437,Overall my best plastic colours have been:Pink or Pink/White swirlChartreuseFiretigerElectric Chicken which is pink and chartreusePurple/Silver - Berkley colour called Uncle Rico My PB walleye was caught on a yellow twister on a pre rigged $1.99 special from Walmart lol Cheers Andrew
