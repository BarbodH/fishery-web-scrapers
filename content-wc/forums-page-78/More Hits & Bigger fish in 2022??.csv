Should we expect more bites and bigger fish in 2022? If 1000's of fisherman are not taking their daily limit, it has to increase the population right?"
6543576,prov1800,2021-03-27 10:20:00,5010,Just on a personal note i do and see some increased catches starting in late last fall and throughout the ice fishing season.Not a real increase in larger fish but could be just me but am looking forward to this up coming season to see what the out come is as it looks like more border closures for a bit longer.

6543836,bushead11,2021-03-28 07:09:00,151,"I was more curious if owners keep track of the number of fish kept annually based on occupancy and bag limits. On huge bodies of water it might not make a difference but say a resort has 10 cabins that each hold 6 guys with conservation licenses and eat two fish a day all summer. 60 guys x 2 fish a day x 90 day summer = 10,800 Is 10,800 walleye a drop in the bucket or after two years will anglers notice an increase in production with 21,600 more fish to catch?"
6543842,Bill Krejca,2021-03-28 07:31:00,6107,"Any reduction in fish being removed means more fish in the water. As most fish not removed continue growing ALMOST up until dying of old age, end result should be more and bigger. Not being removed also means not being removed by netting efforts. Bill"
6543866,prov1800,2021-03-28 08:33:00,5010,At the rate they grow here you are not going to notice larger fish within one year.Definatly will see larger schools which i did notice in last fall.My fishing is usually pretty good to begin with so it's hard to tell if there is a increase or not but iam sure there is when you do the math.Looking forward to the season starting and getting boat in and starting with some ice out lakers and sunny days.
