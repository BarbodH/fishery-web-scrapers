6543582,prov1800,2021-03-27 10:35:00,5010,Your absolutly right.Cliff does has huge walleyes in it.Tougher to find them so its not a real whow walleye destination.My wife and i go there when ever we can and we have very good luck there.Ive also fished there many years and know the ins and outs of the lake through a lot of trail and error.

6543996,Bill Krejca,2021-03-28 14:48:00,6107,"Very logical walleye bite in a super clear lake. Ability to out-see their prey is a characteristic trait, of which they atke advantage. Most stained water action tends to really slow down as the sun sinks. Although walleye can see well, relatively, in the dark, water which is not as clear to begin does tend to cause the bite to be substantially reduced, due reduced visibility. Usually. Bill"
6544014,prov1800,2021-03-28 16:16:00,5010,"Its a amazing thing with with walleyes.You could set your watch to them.No bite till the sun starts setting in the West and bottom of the sun touches the tops of the trees Bang its on.This basically happens mostly with ice on.Good thing these habits dont drag on into summer or we would all be be fishing in the dark.I only use one rod as 2 would be to much and wouldn't be able to keep up catching them.When the border was open ice had guests at this spot and said that was the best time they ever had and size wise also as this lake has many 30"" fish in it."
6544022,Eckohlt,2021-03-28 16:45:00,3685,Cloud cover can get them going earlier
6544132,prov1800,2021-03-29 06:27:00,5010,Walleyes never play by the rules.You might get a couple sneak in early but normally it takes the bottom of the sun to touch the top of the trees no matter what.Going to fish some rapids this week and see if there coming into that area yet.Have couple weeks left before season closes so will check it every few days.its a evening affair to.Weather is looking good to get some melting going on.Winter is long season and spring time is very welcome in my book.Time to get a couple of regular rods out. Got out yesterday to a small lake for some crappies but might of been to late as we only got into the perch.But fun outing and nice day out.Burned some smokies perfectly.

6541896,Eckohlt,2021-03-22 15:44:00,3685,"I ask the secretary her name she said it was Pinocchio,I said that explains things"

6542414,Wallguy123,2021-03-24 07:45:00,13,How is the ice on Edward?
6542438,prov1800,2021-03-24 09:03:00,5010,ice is still good all lakes but its time to start being carefull.shorelines are tight with cooler nights.still have minus nights.
6543148,prov1800,2021-03-26 05:01:00,5010,"met up with some guys on another lake for a evenig bite.Had to wait till 8 for bite to start then it got crazy.No keepers at all,every fish was over 20"" and up to 25"".Fun evening and had a chance to yak before action started.Ice is getting less now with about a foot now,"
6543184,Eckohlt,2021-03-26 07:47:00,3685,Is the lake name..........20 n over only?
6543342,prov1800,2021-03-26 14:40:00,5010,HAHA.just happened to have all females there right now.Males will show up soon.Actually it's Cliff Lake.Great multispecies lake.Tough lake to fish but i like challenges.
6543354,Eckohlt,2021-03-26 15:56:00,3685,"If you can figure out lake trout lakes for walleyes you can figure out any type of water,I like fishing lake trout lakes for walleyes,the average size seems to be bigger"
6540664,prov1800,2021-03-19 14:55:00,5010,so today with the wind up around 40 km i decided to head over to Clarks camp on Edward lake for some walleye action and stay indoors.Good decision as it was windy.Even had wind in the shack since there off the ice by about a foot and a bit and the wind was howling up through the holes at times pretty good.Didnt even use any minnows today as i used my crappie setup from the weekend.Worked quite well so stuck with it.Fun to experiment with diff stuff.Bite only lasted about 40 minutes and it was over.Got there at 8 so i guess i should have been a hour earlier.Got my 4 eaters in 4 drops so wasnt to concerned after that.Couple of weeks and ice fishing will be over and maybe get a little shore fishing in before season closes on april 15 th.Looking forward to getting boat ready.Love this time of the year.
6540692,Eckohlt,2021-03-19 16:34:00,3685,"I remember that lone island out there,have you ever caught any fish around that lone island?"
6540894,prov1800,2021-03-20 07:50:00,5010,when its spring and open water i have.There is a nice rock pile there that goes toward shore and holds fish.
6540996,Eckohlt,2021-03-20 12:13:00,3685,"Ok john,hopefully you can do some shore fishing soon"
6541706,prov1800,2021-03-22 07:56:00,5010,"Everything is kinda on schedule from the looks of it.Can never count out bad weather coming but if this continues iam thinking open water a little earlier.7 years ago we were able to put a small 12 ft boat in as we had 2-300 yds of open water 3 days before the walleye season closed on April 15 th.We had some of the best fishing action ever experienced.Walleyes,Lakers and muskies could be sen swimming around by boat.Area we fished was not a sanctuary but a real good spawning area that no one fishes.It is about as good as it gets.Many 30 ""females.So hoping we get to do that again this year."
