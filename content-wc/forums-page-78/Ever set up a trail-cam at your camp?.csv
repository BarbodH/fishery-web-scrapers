6543748,phishfearme,2021-03-27 18:38:00,1242,a good bet is that many of your crows are ravens and to us it's hard to believe your gut pile wasn't swarmed by gulls - and also eagles. we make an evening event of watching who arrives at the gut pile from tonight's fish. gulls out number everything else and will chase away eagles - but ravens get their share - never seen a crow - and there is very little left over for night time visitors - but it would be interesting to put a trail cam on it to see what gives. phish
6543824,andreindy,2021-03-28 06:21:00,308,"Phish, glad for the info...we always thought they were crows. The pictures were all like the one attached. Interestingly enough, we do not see many gulls."
6543860,Mojo-NC,2021-03-28 08:05:00,1929,"That is a very cool video compilation. Thanks for sharing. That's a new idea for our gut pile. We had not considered putting up a trail cam. We placed our pile across the lake thinking it might attract bears, but it seemed that only gulls and eagles took care of it in short order. On our last fly-in, we had a gull that followed us around the lake all week to eat our dead minnows. We nicknamed him Rick. One day an eagle tried to eat Rick. It all happened right beside our boat and I only wish we could have gotten video of it. It went on for what seemed like forever, but actually lasted only a minute or so. That eagle was right on Rick's a**, and came within a foot or so several times. Rick was quite evasive and would dive down within inches of the water surface and then go right back up and around. Through all of his evasive maneuvers, that eagle stayed right on him. We thought Rick was a goner, but he somehow was able to wear out the eagle and he ended up getting away. He was back a bit later for some more boat side snacks."

6543920,andreindy,2021-03-28 10:04:00,308,"At 4:35 in the video, a field worker puts some substance on a trail-side tree. If you read down the comments they reveal what it was: Voyageurs Wolf Project 2 weeks ago Our pleasure! We put skunk essence on that tree! This gets animals to slow down to investigate the scent! And these wolves were from the Sand Point Park down in the southeastern part of Voyageurs National Park."
6543992,Bill Krejca,2021-03-28 14:39:00,6107,"Yeah, video stated skunk juice. My guess is that once the attraction started, it sort of became self-perpetuating, each animal thereafter possibly adding a little of their ""personality"" to the spot. Really fun to watch their individual traits. Bill"
6544020,dvl2700,2021-03-28 16:45:00,371,Was bear hunting in Maine and saw a bear do that against the tree. Didn't shoot him but I should have. Most fun I had watching an animal in the woods in a long time. About 7 minutes worth of viewing between that and the bait barrel.
6546734,Bigtaproot,2021-04-04 19:11:00,900,Really really cool
6543480,andreindy,2021-03-27 07:20:00,308,"At our last fly-in to Abamasagi (Nakina area), my brother brought a simple trail cam for fun. Every year I accumulate the groups trip pictures and stories and make a hardcover book that sits on the coffee table, so I was looking forward to seeing what it would capture. In hindsight, we should have put it on the small trail to the outhouse, but if it captured bears I would be performing counseling to a few of the lads. Ultimately we placed it across a bay from camp where we dump our fish gut buckets in a stand of trees. We anticipated that the cam would capture ferocious bear battles over the gut pile or some rare arctic hyena...our minds got pretty imaginative and hopeful. What we did know is that every day the pile was being picked over pretty good. Once getting home to Wisconsin and looking at the footage it was a little anticlimactic: CROWS. Every single picture. Anyhow, below is a pretty cool video from a team in Minnesota. They set up a trail cam in Voyageur park fora year and condensed all the animal sightings into a single video. Pretty cool. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc6XdJAtcPQ"
6543544,Bill Krejca,2021-03-27 09:11:00,6107,Wow! Thanks for the great footage. Beyond enjoyable!!!! Bill

6543652,'Taterguy,2021-03-27 13:47:00,33,Any idea what they spread on that tree?
6543660,andreindy,2021-03-27 14:29:00,308,"Whatever it was, it stopped the animals in their tracks, right? They knew it was there...comments on the link said that the spot attracted attention for months and months afterwards."
6543702,Wawajake,2021-03-27 17:18:00,413,"I suspect the bear and maybe even the wolves are marking dominance on that particular tree. Here I have a pic of a bear on my sugar bush atv trail, in similar rubbing fashion. But my tree is treeI had my hands on in past becausr I nailed a direction sign on it. The second pic shows another bear again interested in that tree months later."
