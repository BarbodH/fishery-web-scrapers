6545568,olderfart,2021-04-01 14:00:00,18,I haven't been to Miller but have fished 4 outpost lakes with Chimo and all had great walleye fishing. In my experience if catching lots of small fish a change of depth or location will change the outcome. Any lake in that area of Ontario should provide a great experience. I'm looking forward to my trip this year (with fingers crossed!!!!).

We are on Roderick the week before and figure we should do okay on walleyes there and would be happy to chase after some big pike during our second week."
6546700,HLiskey@1968,2021-04-04 17:35:00,4,I have been there a few years back and I have also been to Keeper River outpost. Miller was the Bette lake for size of fish and walleye right off the dock in the evenings while sitting around the fire. The portage lake had big walleye. I can show you some pictures if you want.

6546702,HLiskey@1968,2021-04-04 17:38:00,4,We went the last week in June but I would go again
6546768,skimottaret,2021-04-05 03:31:00,40,Great to hear that both Miller and Trophy lake produced good fish. A photo or two would be great to see to give us some hope
6543432,skimottaret,2021-03-27 02:38:00,40,We have fished Roderick a few times and loved it. Have an opportunity to get on Miller lake end of July and wondering about the fishing there. Looks fairly small and shallow for summertime. Any info gladly received.
6543456,Eckohlt,2021-03-27 05:54:00,3685,"I had some friends fish it but not much said about it,so that kind of told me right there"
6543460,skimottaret,2021-03-27 06:04:00,40,"Yeah it was the only outpost available for the last week of July which would indicate not one of their best summer lakes, pretty small and shallow. If you could check in with your friends to get further details that would be very helpful We decided to change weeks to after 20 July in the slim hope of border opening."
6543482,Eckohlt,2021-03-27 07:29:00,3685,Check your private msg
6545292,skimottaret,2021-04-01 08:12:00,40,"quick check in , anyone been ?"
6545390,wmd,2021-04-01 09:36:00,388,"We went to Miller Lake 25 years ago, a long time ago I know. Small fish after small fish after small fish, I would not go back. wmd"
6545394,skimottaret,2021-04-01 09:38:00,40,ouch.... but thanks for the intel... hoping maybe to throw for some decent pike... actually just hoping to get over into canada..
6545528,Pink Unicorn,2021-04-01 12:36:00,83,"Coming from my sister who fished it ""Miller itself isn't the best but trophy lake portage, which is quite a hike, is very much worth it."""
6545558,jambi,2021-04-01 13:46:00,504,"Looks like several portages, lots of water. Great area. I would go."
