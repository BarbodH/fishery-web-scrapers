6546726,billy weaver,2021-04-04 18:31:00,470,"I have been going to Wabaskang for over 30 years, 2020 was to be my 32 consecutive year. I have fished a couple of other lakes but I like Wabaskang. I am scheduled this year for June 13th the fifth week of the season. We may reschedule to late August later."
6546744,sheepman,2021-04-04 19:49:00,98,"We go the third week of August, obviously couldn't go last year but looking forward to this year. Does not look good, check out Sleepy Dog Cabins on Facebook water looks extremely low this year."
6546888,JAY221,2021-04-05 10:57:00,877,"We go mid July each year to Sleepy Dog Cabins. The pictures I have seen of the lake recently are scary!! Tom says it is the lowest he has ever seen it and he has lived in the area his whole life. He says he doesn't know if he can get boats in and out if it doesn't come up even if the border does open. Need lots of rain throughout the region. Later, Jay"
6546990,sheepman,2021-04-05 16:07:00,98,"Jay, I saw pictures Tom had on facebook, looks incredible! Don't know how you could launch a boat. 1st narrows must be impassable."
6547008,JAY221,2021-04-05 16:56:00,877,"Tom says about a foot of water in the first narrows. I didn't think they would even have that much. All of the narrows get pretty shallow and with water down 4 feet or so it does not look good for getting around the lake. I'm praying for a LOT of rain!! Later, Jay"
6547134,prov1800,2021-04-06 05:28:00,5010,Lot of rain being forecasted starting tomorrow right through weekend.Possibly 45 ml.if you add up the days.That will help out some.
