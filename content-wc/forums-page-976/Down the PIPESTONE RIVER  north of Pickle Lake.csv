517671,lobo1,2002-03-08 12:55:00,734,"Dave, Now how can you stay down the road three hours and miss all the cat fights between the drunken locals at the ""one"" bar/restaraunt/motel !! Sounds like you are missing out on the local entertainment !We've always had an early flight and didn't really have a choice on where to stay.The other thing to mention (if you stay in town) is to watch your stuff like a hawk or it will grow legs. We always take all of our stuff inside, which is a big pain, but seems necassary all the same.Steve"
517672,Dave,2002-03-08 13:39:00,258,Lobo- When we use to do the fly-ins from Pickle Lake we always went with Albany River outfitters. Jerrel would let us stay at one of his cabins at his base camp the night before we flew in which was nice. He would also let us shower the morning we would come out. I'm not sure he still does that for folks. Pickle Lake is where I discovered the fact that an order of french fries always comes with gravy all over them.Dave
517673,lobo1,2002-03-08 14:12:00,734,Yup - gravy on the fries. Go back to room for a bit then hit the bar and watch the drunk ladies fight !! Good thing the fishing was good - I wouldn't want those as my only memories !!lobo
517674,Guest,2002-03-08 14:29:00,0,.LMAO That is so true about the locals all drunk and fighting. Last year i flew out of red lake and at about 7:00 pm i looked out of the room and it looked like dawn of the living dead. I was the one that told everyone to load up the hotel rooms with are gear and of course are canadian beer thats like gold to the locals. My group said i was paranoid so i said fine leave your stuff out here i am bringing my things in the room. Well needless to say after a few of them came up asking for a beer or what ever was coming out of there toothless mouths they did the same. This year i am staying in nestorfalls on lake of the woods so this wont be a problem. Hey lobo check out nestorfalls.com and look at lount that is were i am going this year i have been to one pine and lake herod before check out the site and let me know what you think.
517675,lobo1,2002-03-08 19:01:00,734,"Nuke,That place looks good - REALLY good if you live in Minnesota. We are trying the Tbay departure with Moc Trls this year and see how it works out. We're not opposed to driving that far but will try closer this year.All of these lakes have a few giants in them and all camp owners say ""trophy"" fishing. Having been to two others what is the trophy count for eyes and gators for your group ?Do you really have to use bait to catch a bunch of fish ? Thanks,lobo"
517676,lenray,2002-03-09 07:39:00,467,hi DaveAre you the fella that wrote me last fall on this forum about Horseshoe Lake. You have got me scared about staying in Pickle Lake. We figure it is 1000 miles to Pickle and some of the guys want to sleep over before going up the gravel rd. we are coming from the east so probably Ignace would be the place to stay but it is a ways from Pickle.Enjoy your adding to this talk along with LOBO nuker and others--good winter fun.len
517677,Dave,2002-03-10 08:45:00,258,"Lenray-That would be me. I'm serious about the motels in Pickle Lake. They are bad. I would call Jerrel at Albany River Outfitters 218-776-3155.He is about 8 miles up the gravel road, he may let you rent a cabin for the night. He is mainly a fly-in but if he has an open cabin I'm sure you could rent it. I didn't make it to Pickle Lake last year, we went to Sioux Lookout and fished Lake Minnitaki. We were there the third week of Sept. and I believe it was the best fishing ever. The walleyes were in 30' water and they were large ave. size was 22-23"" and the largest was at 28"". They have a slot of 18-21"" and it was hard to keep fish to eat. We stayed at Winoga Lodge, it is an island camp and the owner is one ##### of an outdoorsman. If he is not guiding he is out fishing by himself. We are going this May and I can't wait. I'm sure there will be a lot more boats on the water than in Sept. but it is a big lake. Stay safe in Pickle Lake.Dave"
517678,lenray,2002-03-10 11:04:00,467,Thanks Davefor the headsup on the motels. I do some driving for a friend who has a 15 passenger ford van with the seats out and I take a few trips per month and 99 times out of a hundred i take my sleeping bag and stay in the van. Stayed in the van down in Evansville IN. JUST LAST Sunday evening quite cold but was warm in the bag.Did you feel that your veh. and trailer etc. were safe while you were up on the Horseshoe did you camp up on the lake or come back to your veh. each night??Good to hear from you again.len
517679,Dave,2002-03-11 08:23:00,258,"Lenray- I have only fished Horseshoe Lake twice. Both times we camped on an Island for a week. Nobody messed with the vehicles those two years. I went with my brother-in-law who has gone the past 10-12 years,the guy even goes by himself which is crazy, but anyway he said one time someone broke his mirror. You can camp where you put your boat in and usually there are campers there. We also went during moose season so there were a few people around all the time. As I have gotten older my camping days are over, I need a cabin & a bed & a wood stove. Have a good trip and stay safe."
517661,lenray,2002-03-04 18:42:00,467,Hello SteveIt is fun reading your posts of your trips north of Pickle Lake.Have your fished Horseshoe Lake up the Pipestone from the road that goes north out of Pickle?I can see the lights from Jays from my house do you get up there often?Keep up the good writing about your experiences up north.Thankyoulen
517662,lobo1,2002-03-04 21:41:00,734,"No - Len,I dream about fishing as you do it - quads, canoes, hiking, or even doing alot more of how I do it - but now it is impossible - I have three small children. This endeavor will have to wait a few years.I have never fished horseshoe or any other lake up there besides the two that I mentioned - sorry I couldn't be of more help.Jay's : My travels usually take me to Frank's in Linwood but several times a year I get to Jay's. I'm thinking that Jay's might work best for our group this year; we like Bass Pro but Jay's is so much closer and has most of what we want. So what if the prices are 20% higher. We believe in feeding the local businesses anyways.Out,lobo"
517663,Guest,2002-03-05 09:29:00,0,"Hey lobo we are going out of nestorfalls fly-in this year. I went out of there outfit in the mid 90's for 3-4 yrs in a row but that group of guys went there seperate ways after that. That was to bad but now i have a new group just as fun actually more into the fishing then the drinking. I only have to drive from mpls,Minn so not so bad for me but that pickle lake drive is tuff on a R.V. This drive to nestorfalls will be a walk in the park only 1 hour into canada and i love the hospitality that Dave&Michelle offer. We are going to try lount lake this year on the english river system and see if we cant pull out a few bigger fish this year. Michelle was honest in saying the fishing would not be as fast and furious as some of the romote more northern lakes they have but bigger in size is a given. If this is not a good fishing trip i think i will try Favourable or wapikopa lake next year. But with someone dropping there june 8th-13th trip here at lount how could i pass on that time slot! Good luck."
517664,lobo1,2002-03-05 09:53:00,734,"That short of a drive and having the dates fall in your lap........this would have me booking the trip and finding partners later ! Done that before.I'm expecting big things out of this new camp and I will post or let you know when I get back at the end of May. To be honest with you we all wanted to return to Favourable but flying out of TBay shortens our trip by at least two days, cuts off 12 HRS driving, motels etc.Favourable has a lot of trophies in it (Northerns and eyes) and numbers to boot - it will be VERY tough to beat it. Jack has an outpost on Favourable and Waynorth Lodge is on the neighboring lake.I see Tom Gray is flying out of Sioux Narrows if you book direct to one of his camps - FYI Steve"
517665,Guest,2002-03-06 05:18:00,0,I know some guys who go to Pickle Lake Outposts and fly to Ozhiski Lake and camp out. Costs them about $350 per man. They take their own outboards and gas. Catch the majority of their walleye in the 3 to 4 lb range. From what they tell me there are no outposts on the lake and there are a couple of boats already there.
517666,lenray,2002-03-07 08:00:00,467,Hello Lobo and other north travelersWe are going to go UP the Pipestone to Horseshoe and a few other lakes up above that if we can get to them I have been told that it is about 8-9 miles up river by boat to the first lake.What has been your experience with the iceout dates that far north. The last week of May should be ok???len
517667,lobo1,2002-03-07 10:56:00,734,I hope it's gone ! That's when I'm going and I'll be quite a bit farther north than you. The last couple years it has all been long gone by then but there have been years.........keep your fingers crossedSteve
517668,lenray,2002-03-07 20:04:00,467,Hi LoboWe were thinking about getting a motel or hotel and then going up the gravel road in the daylight do you have any suggestions of where to stay should we have reservations??thanks len
517669,lobo1,2002-03-07 21:09:00,734,If you are staying In Pickle Lake - reservations are a must and I would check them several times to make sure they still have a room for you as your trip approaches. A couple years ago they lost our reservation.There isn't much of anything in Pickle Lake. I think one of the places is called the Winston and I can't think of the other right now. If nobody answers this for you by the weekend I'll dig out my papers and find the phone numbers etc for you.lobo
517670,Dave,2002-03-08 07:30:00,258,"You couldn't pay me to stay at the motels in Pickle Lake, they are nasty. I would sleep in my truck or stay at the Lamplighter Motel in Sioux Lookout. Its about 3 hours from there to Pickle Lake and then another 65 miles to the Pipestone River. If you have the time and you got the itch to wet your line stop at the first bigger bridge about 20 miles north of Pickle Lake and cast from the bank below the falls. I think its called July Falls. It kind of breaks up the trip. Also, about 35 miles north of Pickle Lake is Mud Lake. There is a boat ramp there. We have caught a lot of nice walleye where the Otaskwin River comes in. Just make sure you pull your boat out in the daylight the bears tend to congregate around there at dusk. If you need detailed maps for the area you are heading to (North of Pickle Lake) I would stop at the Pickle Lake City Hall. You can buy maps and they are great. I saved mine from previous trips and I stapled them up in my garage so when the snow is flying outside I can look at them and remember the great trips I had in Cnanada. Good luck on your trip and stay safe you are a long ways from nowhere."
517651,Guest,2002-02-28 11:58:00,0,I was wondering if any of you folks have went down the Pipestone river system North of Pickle Lake and fished any of those lakes in that system.Thankyou len at clare michigan
517652,Guest,2002-02-28 20:36:00,0,"Len,I have fished Kinloch and Morris lake but I took a short flight. I don't know what you would be in for, as far as travel on the ground. Both of these lakes have a cabin on them; Kinloch you could travel by boat for a couple days so the one cabin wouldn't be a big deal. You can travel by river (most of the way) from Kinloch into Morris if you have a prop guard.The fishing in both of these lakes is very good, we never had any trouble getting at least a hundred eyes a day per person and there are some dandy northerns as well.I don't know if you had any plans on targeting this area. If you need anything else let me know.lobo"
517653,lenray,2002-03-01 08:53:00,467,Thanks for the info. lobo did you tell me that you are from Midland Mi. or was that someone else.It sounds like you are an adventrous fisherman who isn't afraid to try something that others just dream about.Any info. or stories that you have the time to share would be very much appreciated.Did you see any bear???len
517654,Guest,2002-03-01 09:17:00,0,"I flew out of pickle lake 2 yrs ago to pipestone river system. It was about a 20 min flight. We stayed at a nice cabin out of moccasin trails. Plenty of walleye in the 18-22 inch range biggest northen was 16 lbs biggest eye was 27"" we found rapids about a half hour from cabin and had all 3 boats there at once and everybody was having doubles in there boat it was a blast. Plus we found a nice sandy beach for a shore drink."
517655,Guest,2002-03-01 17:42:00,0,"Len,Midland is correct. Adventurous.........I'm not so sure of. Sounds like you are the adventurer with the quads, hiking, canoes etc - we just don't mind driving great distances to find plentiful naive fish. We catch a plane and hop in there.The other post from Nuker sounds like he was at one of the two places we went to in that area and used the same outfitter; maybe he has a little more info to share.Kinloch really deserves another visit, there was alot of water there and we marked a ton of bigger fish in a deep bay that we couldn't get to turn on. We would have liked to have had more time to work that deep bay (40-60 feet) and there were many many weedy bays with drop offs that we didn't have time to work the gators properly either - time is always so short.Unfortunately we probably won't return there as Mocassin Trails now flies some of their trips direct out of Thunder Bay. The shorter drive will probably keep us from going back - but the fishing was great.We saw many bears and moose along the way driving but never saw a bear at either lake, we did however see several moose and many eagles.You are welcome to copy my maps of the area waters, I could meet up with you next time I go up to Jay's.Steve"
517656,Guest,2002-03-02 09:40:00,0,How can I get in touch with the outfitter-Moccasin Trails. Would this section of the Pipestone require whitewater skills? How big are the two lakes you mentioned. Sounds like excellent fishing but a LONG drive from Ohio where I live.
517657,Guest,2002-03-02 19:37:00,0,"SW,All of these places are a long drive from Ohio !! Long drive from MI too ! The key is to take a little less time on the lake (maybe a 5 day trip) and enjoy the trip to and from and stop at some nice places - resorts, casinos, convention centers etc - along the way. Or you can pay the big bucks and fly !!Anyhow, the places I have been on the Pipestone vary in width but were all fine for a 14 ft lund - no whitewater skills - no fast water. I am sure there are places that are difficult to pass but I never found them in my one week visits. We did find several sets of rapids but always fished the lake side of them and never bothered trying to portage. Time is short.The areas I have been to - the river is pretty wide with lots of bays and more-so resembles a narrow lake.Mocassin Trails has about 15 camps to pick from - scattered all over NW Ontario. Some of their flights leave from TBay - which would help you out a bit on driving distance.Phone is 1(800)347-4421 - If you call - insist on talking to Jack.As far as the size of the waters for the two camps I went to : Morris Lake (Upturned Root) I think was about 6-8 miles long and about a mile and half wide with several rivers creeks coming and going and many bays.Kinloch, which is right on the river system,...........well, I could still be driving the boat - goes for days - couldn't carry enough gas to reach an impass.Most all of those camps up there have very little pressure and are very good. But in order to find ""stupid"" fish,in schools, you need to choose wisely. All of Moc Trails camps are single cabins on a lake/river - just your group. If you like the lodge setting get in touch with Sean (duffy) he can get you a spot at Waynorth - which is very good too.lobo"
517658,Guest,2002-03-03 08:46:00,0,Lobo - email me at [email protected]. I'd like to talk more about the Pipestone. Thanks-SW
517659,Guest,2002-03-04 13:23:00,0,If i remember correctly powerbait was just as good as leeches if you can beleive that. There was a lake to the right of the cabin we could not get to water to low that year. I think the name of that lake was upturned root lake and thats where he had a cabin for years then built a new one on pipestone lake/river.I think we were the 4th group ever to be in there at that time. Make sure you have your eyes open for rocks we had a few suprises the first couple of days. What time of year are you going? We went in late june and we were having are best luck where the water was moving. You can put up some serious walleye numbers on any given day. Never go without at least a few #18 floating trout rapalas. good luck!
517660,lobo1,2002-03-04 16:42:00,734,"Nuker,You must have went the same year we did, we were the first group through there. Sounds like you fished that same river mouth, up stream about an hour, that we did. That was a bunch of fun catching fish like that - I bet we caught 500 fish that afternoon. I switched to a topwater muskie bait after a couple hours and took a really nice northern. We didn't take any bait but my opinion is that it would have been a nuisance.There was a bay right after you passed through the narrow area near camp that dropped down to 40-50 feet. We marked fish like crazy down there but couldn't get anything to take. You guys do any good there or try fishing deep at all ?We're trying out another of their new camps this year on the Winisk NE of their Wapikopa post - should be very good.You wouldn't have missed much getting into that river that goes to Upturned - It is shallow and muddy for atleast a mile and before you get to Upturned you would have had to get out your hip boots and drag your boat several hundred yards.lobo"
