517232,Guest,2002-02-16 03:14:00,0,"I've fished at Nueltin which is the NW corner of MB bordering the NW territories for the last 5 years. Its a legitimate trophy lake for pike,lakers, and grayling. It is not inexpensive but you get what you pay for."

Not alot of trophy walleye but alot of 3 to 5 lbs.(100 to 150 aday)! They do have alot of trphy pike! You can get a list of the Master Angler Awards and that lake has to be in the to 10 if not the top 5! They have a good web site WolverineLodge.net. The acomadations aren't spectacular but they are very comfy, the food is good and the people are Great! Can't wait till june when I'll be back up there."

I would appreciate the info. (Just wish I lived closer). Thanks.[email protected]"
517236,Guest,2002-02-20 11:49:00,0,"Have seen your posts before, curious what part of hoosier state you are from."
517237,Guest,2002-02-20 16:57:00,0,"I am from Madison In. , the reason I am seeking info on this area is because I purchased a cottage there, as insane as it sounds, sight unseen! It was a deal worth taking a gamble on, hey you only live onece. I spoke with the owner many many times, saw lots of pictures,called businesses in Lynn Lake, all knew the owner and the cabin, I feel pretty confident about it, it is 50 miles from Reindeer Lake, and about 27 from Vanderkerchove, right next to Little Brightsand, it is on a small lake about 2 miles long called Barbara Lake. Was just wondering how many people have fished this area ,and what they thought about it.Right now i'm spending my winter dreaming about going there as soon as the ice goes out."

From their point of view they recaptured the costs many times over. They used to boat past it on their way upriver, but never even new there was a cabin tucked away in there. Hope you are as satisfied with your purchase as they were with theirs."
517239,Guest,2002-03-13 07:22:00,0,We fished that area several times and the fishing was average for that part of Manitoba. Be careful of your outfitter we had less than good service both times.
