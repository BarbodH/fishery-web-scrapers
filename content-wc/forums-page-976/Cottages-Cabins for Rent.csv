518083,Guest,2002-03-11 00:50:00,0,I would like to go to the Canadian Bass tournament in Rainy Lake in July of this year with some friends. I've heard there are islands/cabins that are really private. Do you know of any for Rent?Would be nice to have its own dock and somewhere where you could bring your dog.
518084,Guest,2002-03-11 14:56:00,0,I stayed at this great place last year on Rainy Lake. It was a cabin on partial island. The view was incredible. Own dock. It could sleep 6-8. Around a 5 minute boat ride to 5 mile dock. I will be going there again this year. Awesome!!! The contact guy's name is Gordie 807-274-1379 or you can email [email protected] Have a great time. Fishing is great.
