517816,Geno,2002-03-09 05:43:00,91,"Alaska trip....www.earlyfishing.comVal and Gary Early are great hosts, a class act in our opinion. I set this trip up for three of us 2 years ago and at the time it "" was going to be a once in a lifetime thing "". My two buds went back last year, I got stuck here in Ohio setting up a new business venture, but we're going back in Aug. for the opening of the Silver salmon season.Visit their site. If you ever decide to book a trip, I'll give you some details on what to expect. If you talk to Val, tell her Gene Rogers from Ohio says hey.Geno"

517818,Guest,2002-03-10 11:48:00,0,How do you fish to catch those Whitefish?
517819,outdoor fanatic,2002-03-10 18:07:00,90,"We caught them while we were trolling with crawler harnesses. Mostly on nightcrawlers, but we did catch a few on minnows. I believe we've also caught them jigging. They sure do have some strong shoulders on them. Hope that helps."
517806,Guest,2002-03-04 17:28:00,0,JUST BOOKED A 3 DAY FLY-IN MID AUG. TO PINE PORTAGE LODGE WONDERING IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW THE FISHING IS? ALSO ANY INFO THAT WOULD MAKE THE TRIP/FISHING A SUCCESS WOULD BE APPRECIATED.
517807,outdoor fanatic,2002-03-05 20:18:00,90,"Isn't that on Lake Kabinakigami? If so, I've found that minnows on just about any presentation (jigs, crawler harnesses, etc.) works really well. However, I've not been there that late and can only speak of the early season when the eye's are in 8-12 feet of water."
517808,Geno,2002-03-06 06:14:00,91,"I've been going to Kaby and Pine Portage since the late '80's. Great place, great people. Get a guide your second day, that's a big lake and if you've never been there your 3 day trip will be over before you can figure things out. We know the lake fairly well but we still get the guide for our first full day. Not that much $, take my word.GenoP.S. It is a jig and minnow bite ( most productive for us ) ."
517809,outdoor fanatic,2002-03-06 17:01:00,90,"Geno,Have you ever tried trolling with a crawler harness using a minnow? I gotta tell you we slaughtered them that way. Just wondering."
517810,Geno,2002-03-07 04:18:00,91,"Yes we have ! On this particular lake, due south of the lodge (as the crow flies ) is the Oba River, about 10 a.m. we would hit the mouth and back troll with harness's. Very effective and there was a great shore lunch site right there so we would stringer a few eaters. Fried walleye at 11:30, lots of great memories from those Canadian fly-ins !GenoP.S. Outdoor Fanatic, thanks for making me remember that."
517811,outdoor fanatic,2002-03-07 20:39:00,90,"I'm gonna have to check out the Oba this year. I use Everson's lodge which is a little ways away from you. I find that most people at that lodge don't venture out very far from the lodge, but I like to go all over. In fact, most of the time, I just troll all day long following the lake shore. Are the mosquito's really bad up there when you go? I know I've donated more blood up there than I care to remember, but man, the fishing is good."
517812,Geno,2002-03-08 04:29:00,91,"Marc,My first trip to Kaby we stayed at Eversons, so from there you're about a 30 min. ride to the Oba but there is plenty good fishing on the way. Another great spot from Eversons is the Little Whitefish River. Once you get around Windy Point, the river flows into Whitefish Bay on the east end of the bay, not as big as the Oba but a similar situation, you've probably been there.I always go the third week of July and the bugs can be rather testy depending on the wind. If you ever want to get into some Jumbo Perch, go southwest out of Eversons, past Kaby Lodge to the Little Kaby River. Don't know why they're in there and not in the main lake, but you can get 'em trolling, casting, jigging, whatever. Kaby is just a good time no matter where you fish.Wish we were going this year but we're going to Alaska. Let me know how you do up there this year.Geno"
517813,outdoor fanatic,2002-03-08 14:33:00,90,"I wouldn't mind going to Alaska myself. I'll have to try for the perch. We did real well last year in Whitefish Bay. Have you had much success with whitefish up there? We alsways seem to catch about a dozen 5 pounders while we're there. We always go for the weeklong thing. Too afraid that if we take the short trip, we'll run into bad weather and not get to do much fishing. I'll let you know how it goes. Good luck in Alaska this year."
517814,Geno,2002-03-08 17:13:00,91,"Marc,Try the perch for sure, depending on your time of year the 'eyes are probably in there too. Only remember catching one of those whitefish, and oddly enough in Whitefish Bay ! They say if you're there during a mayfly hatch it is awesome, we always missed the hatch.You're right about the weather, try to go for 5 days at least, in late July we've had cold, sleet, rain anytime, and some days so hot that your feet burn up in the boat, just not all in the same day.Alaska is incredible, we did the first trip 2 years ago. Found a great guide, nice lodge, and not expensive. Can't wait to go back in August. Do a post on your trip to Big Kaby for sure !Geno"
517815,outdoor fanatic,2002-03-08 18:05:00,90,Will do. Do you have any info on the alaska trip or a web site? Might like to try it next year.
