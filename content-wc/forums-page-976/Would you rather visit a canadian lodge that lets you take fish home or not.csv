517706,Guest,2002-03-06 14:15:00,0,"I usually take home fish from Canadian Lakes when I visit. First, I believe that the Canadian MNR sets take rates based on the lakes ability to sustain the pressure it receives. They take great pains to accomplish this task. All one need do is read the regulations that are issued with the license. Second, most of the lakes I fish are big bodies of water like Rainy, LOTW, and Lac Suel. There is no way that one person one line is going to impact those lakes when the take is limited to 4 and slotted. and finnally, one of the great pleasures of life is the taste of a walleye shared with friends at a shore-lunch and again with the family when I return home. TGG"
517707,Guest,2002-03-06 15:26:00,0,"Not a big deal for me but I do enjoy eating a few walleyes while there. We go to a Trophy Waters area in Ontario (Umfreville lake on the English river) where all people staying at these resorts must buy only the conservation license. That is a good idea in my view as it gives you the option to take a couple walleyes home and eat a few during the week but does not seem to impact the resource. To the other extreme, in an all release envrionment, you end up with injured fish which become eagle food. I don't mind feeding eagles but sure hate to throw back a fish which I know will not make it.Paul"
517708,Guest,2002-03-08 13:46:00,0,"Do you stay at Halley's or camp on Umfreville?? I have been fishing One-Man, Tourist, Gone and Gashawk for the past 11 years. It is a great fishery. We have been camping all these years and a getting a bit tired of hauling all the camping gear, etc. and setting up camp.If you stay at Halley's, let me know what you think of them. We would probably opt for their housekeeping units at Caribou Falls. We have yet to fish that Western portion of the lake system near Caribou Falls."

517710,Red Ruffandsore,2002-03-13 19:04:00,81,"I could never understand the position of catching fish but not eating or taking home any at all... but I respect that decision. I guess if it was my position I would just buy a glass bottom boat and leave the rod at home. What is more painful to me than zipping up quickly without paying attention, is those that throw the fish in the cooler thinking someone is bound to want it, and of course, no one does so it finds it's way to the garbage can. I think those guilty of this CRIME should be shot and whizzed on."
517696,WillieB,2002-03-03 18:11:00,292,"I eliminate from my list of possible outfitters those that are not catch and release or catch and consume. Why would I want to fish where others have been depleting the quantity and quality of fish? Take some quick pictures, measure the length, and get a graphite replica made. Even remote fly-in outposts are getting 5 to 10 times the volume of fishing that they had 10 years ago. Those that allow ""only one trophy"" or more to go home are shooting themselves in the foot. Those who feel it important to bring home a wall hanger need shooting in the head."
517700,NateW,2002-03-03 20:39:00,96,"I know I'll get blasted for this...but when we fish at Lac Seul, we take home our limit, all the walleye going home are under the slot--less than 18 inches. Needless to say we release about 50 - 60 fish for each fish we keep. I don't see that as decimating a resource. If the walleye population appears to be harmed on Lac Seul, then I would support smaller limits or even not taking any home. But I believe the resource is being managed very well so that the guys who want to strictly catch & release trophies are happy and the guys who take home smaller fish are happy too.From the success I've read that everyone else has had on Lac Seul, it wouold appear that lake is doing fine right now."
517699,Guest,2002-03-05 13:15:00,0,"On our trips, my brother and I would rather eat PBJ sandwiches all week and maximize fishing time rather than eat shore lunches and four course walleye dinners. However, some of our party is just the opposite. A good compromise is for us is to keep enough fish for walleye dinners about three times in a week, pike one day, and then have something else (e.g., steaks, spaghetti) in between. Taking fish out at the end of the trip is the old way, too. Now I would rather leave em for next year. That line about the fish tasting better when you catch them yourself and bring them home is BS. Most of the time, they got as much or more abuse in transit by us, than the ones you can buy at the grocery."

517701,iamwalleye1,2002-03-05 18:27:00,1589,I just love to get away! I hope they keep up the good work! The fishing is making a good come back where I go ! If it come down to it I don't go to fill my freezer!
517702,Guest,2002-03-06 08:02:00,0,As a camp owner on Gullrock lake I applaud the guys who practise catch&release of the over size slot fish. Thru these efforts we have seen our lakes fish population improve. On Gullrock there is a light at the end of the tunnel!
517703,bphunger,2002-03-06 08:23:00,28,The way it seems to me is that Ontario MNR in the Kenor Dist. is doing a great job of resource management. The license you buy gives you permission to take fish from the lakes but it does not require you to take them. You may take them and that to me is giving you a choice. When we are at shows we get blasted by some folks who condemn Ontario for reducing the number of fish you can take. We promote C and R but YOU HAVE THE CHOICE. That puts the power in your hands and you can't bad-mouth the government for that. We have seen a great shift from full cooler to maybe a meal or two being eaten. The quality of fishing in NW Ontario is only getting better. Don't blame all camps if a few promote full coolers. Bob
517704,Guest,2002-03-06 12:21:00,0,"Even though my Dad and I drive 800 miles one way to Canada to fish for walleyes once every year, for 2 weeks, we come home with no fish. We do however, keep a couple for supper back at the cabin after a full day of fishing. We just can't resist eating a few. They are sooo good! Anyway, I caught my biggest walleye last year, weighed it, 9 1/2 lbs. took a couple of pictures then watched her swim off and I felt good about it. :) She will be bigger this Sept. and if I catch her again she will go right back in the lake."
517705,IaCraig,2002-03-06 12:45:00,434,"I am strictly a recreational fisherman, meaning that am not doing it for money or the meat. However I eat fish while on the trip and I like to take a few home to share with my family. The only time that being able to keep fish is important to me is when I have to release a fish that I know is going to die. I realize the laws prohibitting people from keeping fish are necessary and I am thankful for them, however it does not keep me from feeling sick when I have to throw back a fish and watch it float away as the gulls pick it's eyes out.

517687,Guest,2002-03-01 14:09:00,0,"all i have ever been to is a place where people take fish home, would like to try the other side of the coin so I voted so."
517689,Reels,2002-03-01 17:13:00,2876,"I wouldnt say it's important. IF I can, I will, If I cant, no biggie.I would go to either lodge as long as the fish are biting and I dont wake up with a bear in my bed... Unless it was a girl bear and it towards the end of the week...<{{}}><"
517690,Guest,2002-03-02 06:54:00,0,Nueltin Lodge in MB was the first catch and release lodge in Canada. NOTHING goes home. Fish and grow very big if given a chance. There are a tremendous amt of trophies caught and then released. Taking pictures does the job.
517691,River_eye,2002-03-02 16:26:00,1486,"My reason for asking the question is this. I work at a lodge that helps everybody leave the place with 4 walleye per person, and 4 pike if the guests really want them. 6 or 7 miles down the river, another camp, doesn't let anybody take fish home. It doesn't feel right that they are making a sacrafice for a better fishery and we're capitalizing on that. I just wonder how good the fishing would be if they let everyone of their guests take fish home too. Many of us disagree with our boss on this issue, but he worries about losing business if we decide to change, I wish I could change his mind."
517692,Guest,2002-03-02 18:11:00,0,"I just wonder how many people who are for catch and release only, eat any fish while at the camps. I always have a fish fry while there. Some times i bring some home, some times not. I like to have the option. I mostly trophy fish for muskies. But if fishing for walleye, bass, or pike for the table i release the larger ones. My question is what is the difference between haveing some to eat while there or taking a few home with you as long as you stay within the limits for that area? Larry"
517693,stewart,2002-03-02 19:10:00,100,"Shore lunch fish are usually in the 16"" range, while those people take home tend to be as big as they are legally allowed. I guess that's the biggest difference between having a shore lunch and taking them home. Nothing wrong with shore lunch, and it wouldn't be a big deal if people took some home if they felt comfortable taking smaller walleyes."
517694,Guest,2002-03-02 22:48:00,0,"Actually, it seems lodges, areas, etc that have quality regs are attracting more customers than they are turning off. But, as you have observed, it will only work if every does it. I know one thing that turns me off of a lodge is if I see stringer shots of big bass on the brochure/website. Canadian smallies grow so slowly, that it cannot take too many of those types of hits before the quality suffers. I like to take selected fish home for the table (walleyes, crappie perch), but I will gladly give that up if it ensures a better quality experience."
517688,Guest,2002-03-03 07:46:00,0,It's not important to me but at probably over $100 per pound I enjoy fresh walleye! I also feel no remorse about taking my limit home! To all you goofs that don't even have a meal of walleye on your trip- THANKS!
517695,Guest,2002-03-03 08:43:00,0,"Couldn't agree more with Bob G2. My first reaction in seeing a big stringer full of bass/walleye/pike displayed in a brochure is NEGATIVE. If you're putting one on the wall measure, photo and get one of the new reproductions made. They look real and last longer.If you MUST take fish home to eat take the smaller fish - not those in their peak reproductive years. The days of trying to impress someone with a big stringer of hawgs are over. SW"
