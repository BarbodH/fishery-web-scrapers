517438,ggg,2002-02-20 20:46:00,115,Do you realize how big Raindeer Lake is ?
517439,JN,2002-02-20 21:47:00,47,"Yep been there once my dad went back a secvond time. The fishing was great! We went in from South End though. If I were to do it agin I'd go in where you are. The lake is very large and can be very dangerous! The day we had to leave there was a 20mi. an hr. S. wind, the waves were 4 ft. atleast and some times 5 to 6. Becarefull and make sure someone knows how to read a map very well! I would sujest getting a GPS cause on the water everything looks the same. Good Luck"

The best fishing is definitly towards the northern half of the lake. been up there twice and the fishing was great. Not many trophy's, (commercail fishing screws that up) but we caught lots of pike, and one day got into a mess of walleye. Have a great time!"

517441,Guest,2002-03-14 13:40:00,0,You are in for some awesome fishing. Reindeer is a monster of a lake and one of the key items is GPS. You can have some big Pike days and you are always one cast away from a wall hanger. Walleyes are abundant and they love perserved minnows. We have always caught a lot of nice Walleye but perserved minnows and leechs are the ticket for big Walleye. Should be a trip you never forget as long as you watch for prop eating rocks and use your GPS.
