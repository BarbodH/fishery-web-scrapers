As well to Gary Mc Court for keeping the winter road open. Thanks guys for the commitment and the good time.
518078,Mahumba,2002-03-11 18:05:00,345,Hi Thumper!I was out there also. I had a ##### of a time getting in as I drove from the lodge at Sawmill bay. Got stuck for over two hours. Dug myself out and kept going. I was able to weigh one fish but the other two were too small.How'd you do?Roger Mayer.
518079,Guest,2002-03-11 18:11:00,0,Weighed in at 3Lb 6oz for two walleye. Ended up eighth and won $500.

518081,tracker,2002-03-12 07:17:00,91,"I was also at the derby. Fished in the green section. Caught two walleye, both under 13 inches. Wrestled a ten lb pike out about the fifth hole, got the blood flowing for a little while. When I came off the lake Sunday afternoon, there was quite a few trucks still on the ice and Gary wasn't making to much headway because the snow was so deep and was still blowing badly."
518082,Mahumba,2002-03-12 07:59:00,345,Hi Tracker!!If I remember correctly I was right beside you in the blue section. I watched you bring in that pike! I thought for a sec there.......Here's the winner!!Roger Mayer.
