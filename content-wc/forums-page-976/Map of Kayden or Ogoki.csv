518103,Buckeye Twister,2002-03-12 13:25:00,0,"Greetings :I have been going to Lake Kayden and Lake Ogoki, north of Nakina, Ontario, for the past three years and I am looking for a detailed map of either bodies of water. They are not large lakes and there may not be one, but would certainly like to hear from you if you have one or know where I can get one. I have searched many places and only can come up with maps which are vague at best. Thanks for the time and trouble.Twister"
