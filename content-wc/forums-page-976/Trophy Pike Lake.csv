518040,Guest,2002-03-11 11:51:00,0,"Hi Guys, everyone on the thread does make good points surrounding the big pike theory. I have a few of my own but in a nutshell superior gene pools and unlimited abundant forage coupled with intelligent fisheries management all add up to big pike and hopefully lots of them. NOTHING is more important that carefully landing and releasing the big girls, and by no means should the smaller males be abused either. Some locations throughout Canada are just better at producing truly big pike than others and genetically gifted pike do tend to stand out from their essox relatives. I know that at Way North we (my partner Andrew and I) never cought an ""ugly"" pike. Only a few were ""giants"" but ALL were healthy, fat, full of irrodescent color patterns and free from parasites. It is my honest opinion that the far waters North of Red Lake do in fact produce some of the best pike fishing in all of Canada, and those same waters do hold a trememdous trophy potential. If I had to limit my spending to a grand without question I'd be flying north out of Red Lake. Another factor to consider in your quest for big gators is the size of the water system you are fishing. In general the bigger the better, and the deeper the better. In order to grow big pike need a place to retreat to when the sun from the hot dog days of summer beats on the water. Higher temps stress big pike and it's not uncommon for them to stage in deep water adjacent to weed edges and other structural elements. By staying cool they stay alive. In spring and fall they move shallow because the thermoclines virtually disappear but in peak summer (july and august) fish deep for trophys. As for me (and Drew) we'll be at Way North Sept 13 - 20 and am counting the minutes!!!Good Luck guys....."
518044,Guest,2002-03-11 13:34:00,0,"Roger, I am a little dubious about your size/lifespan statements. I only say this because I have seen growth/lifespan charts for pike in southern U.S. lakes vs. far north Canadian lakes and there is a vast difference. In summation, pike in the southern ranges grow faster and live much shorter lives. While just the opposite affect takes place in the far north. Much longer lives, much slower growth. I believe the study also stated that they will continue to add bulk while the ability to growth in length is reduced as they age.As I said, I have seen the studies, but if you asked me to produce them I doubt I could. So it all adds up to my opinion and a bucket of spit! HAHA!"
518045,Guest,2002-03-14 10:26:00,0,"Monster Pike are my speciality. I have caught and released over 300 Pike that have been over 40 inchs...biggest 51 inchs. These Pike have all been caught at Lac Seul Lake in Ontario. My favorite techinique is working perimeters of weed beds with 3/4 oz spinner baits and deeper water close to weed beds with deep diving big crankbaits. Both of these fishing styles have got me the name among my fishing buddys of ""PIKEGOD""....more info email me at [email protected]"
518046,Guest,2002-03-14 11:05:00,0,"I wish I could help you. There is a place that is cheap and loaded with 20 pounders. However, the reason it is such a quality fishery and still affordable is because its name is not plastered all over boards like this.Sorry"
518032,Guest,2002-03-08 18:10:00,0,If you were going to go to one place to catch 20+ lb northernsthat was affordable where would it be. We want to go in Augustsome time. I really want to catch a big pike and have alimited budget. Thanks in advance for your reply.

518035,Guest,2002-03-08 21:12:00,0,AUG. IS NOT THE BEST TIME FOR BIG PIKE .IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR 20LB PIKE.I WOULD GO IN MAY.
518036,duffy,2002-03-09 06:24:00,49,I respectfully disagree with gator. If you go as far north as I go mid to late august is great. The fish are bigger that time of year due to foraging all spring and summer and their metabolisms are in super jet mode so they fight harder than they do in may. A 20 pound fish in may should be two pounds heavier in august. Tactics change in august vs. may but if you have a bit of understaning of their summer patterns I think the fishing can be awesome. If you want info. on the place I go to e-mail me at [email protected]. August is prime time north of red lake. Good luck and have a great trip wherever you go.
518043,Guest,2002-03-10 08:50:00,0,"Time of the year has very little to do with catching Big Pike, at least on our lake (Confederation Lake). August is good because the cabbage weeds are up and in full bloom. Weather is a bit more stable than May or June or Sept. All has to do with the fishery and the genetics in the lake you are fishing in. Big Pike breed Big Pike, the fact that you are on a small lake or a big lake, a river system or a closed lake has little to do with the production of 20lb+ northern pike, the main factor is genetics! Take a look at our web site and photo gallery (all from last season)...<http://www.southbaylodge.com>"
518037,lobo1,2002-03-10 14:45:00,734,"Sean,I am only particular to the early spring because there are relatively no bugs and to break the cabin fever. FYI, in my last few conversations with Debra Johannesson she stated that her favorite time to fish the big guys was also early spring - for what it's worth....But as Roger says big pike breed big pike - and you have big pike there - no doubt. I think there is a bit more to the big pike story other than genetics. I can grow a big pike in my pond if I keep it alive for 20 years. Where you are at the big ticket is the forage - high fat food and lots of it. Big pike that grow fast and breed more big pike quicker - now that's the key.What's the deal with the cabins on Favourable, as far as cost goes and group size ?Steve"
518038,duffy,2002-03-10 16:12:00,49,"Steve,I agree with you. You make very valid points. In addition I think good fish management should be high on the list. If you catch and release the breeder fish without harming them you will maintain a trophy fishery like favourable and setting net. As far as the favourable cabins, at this point they will pretty much take any size group. The cost is around $800 for 5 or 6 six days. The natives just can't seem to market the place and it would not surpise me if they sell in the next few years. I am watching cause I would like to buy it. As you know it's great trophy pike and walleye water but they just don't know how to put people in the camp. I guess that's good for us Way North people!!! Have you spoken to Jay recently? What is he up to? Talk to you soon steve.Sean"
518039,lobo1,2002-03-10 17:09:00,734,"Have not spoken to the Detroit guys lately but they follow the board and will probably speak up.I have not spoken to Jack lateley either but heard thru the grapevine that he dropped the Fav camp and was trying to streamline to due north of TBay. If he had ever fished Fav I think he would have reconsidered.Isn't Bob interested in buying that place ? Those are NICE buildings !IF that place ever does come available and dollars and details are known - let me know. You could start a little ""time share"" deal for modest investments and limit your capital risk ??!! I'd be interested.Amateur night has a lot of risks - but you have the connect with the experienced one.Steve"
518041,Guest,2002-03-10 21:32:00,0,"You make good point about forage and food supply but according to the fisheries Biologist from Red Lake pike reach maturity at age 8-10 years and rarely live past 15 years. A mature 40 inch pike at age 8 will be 40 inches at age 15 though. They will not grow bigger as they get older, now their weight will fluctuate based upon food supply but the just don't keep getting longer. My guides are also fishery biology students and want-to-be conservation officers who are currently enrolled or have graduated from a well-known wildlife progam in Canada and agree that a mature pike will not continue to grow as they get older. Muskies are genetically different than Pike and thus get bigger than northern pike in general but on many lakes they never get bigger than some northern pike that have the ""right"" genetics for BIG."
