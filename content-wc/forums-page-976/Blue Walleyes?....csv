They are deep water fish. Some lakes that have a specific mineral content have produced 'blue yellow walleye.' They surely exist still, but where and how many is hard to know."

517974,DarrenB,2002-03-08 09:30:00,28,"Believe it or not, I caught one of these fish about a month ago(Feb 9) fishing a Cook County Forest Preserve lake here in Illinois. Darndest thing I'd ever seen. The fish was a hair under 18 inches, and looked just like a walleye except it didnt have the normal goldish/green coloring to it and did not have the white tips on it's fins or the spot on its tail. The coloring was not as blue as the fish in the picture, more of a dull, overcast gray. A friend of mine mentioned it may have been a blue pike, showed me a picture of it and it looked about right. I know it wasn't a sauger and it was definitely some type of bizzare walleye.Are these fish actually some sort of gene mutation that can happen from a spawn, or an actual species of their own? I couldn't imagine the IDNR actually stocking these fish in the lake. Wish I had taken a picture of it."

Here is a link to the post I made on our local Chicago fishing board about the fish.http://www.chicagolandfishing.com/ww...ges/10135.html"
517976,Guest,2002-03-08 12:21:00,0,"Kwe AllA few weeks ago I took my family to the Museum of Nature in Ottawa, Ont. This is where I first had heard of the blue walleye or blue pike as some had refered to it years ago. Apparently it is its own species perhaps closely related to the yellow walleye. Commercially fished out of extinction (1890's) with the exception of a few here or there. According to the M of N, they were plentiful in Lake Ontario, Erie and Nippising. Lived in very deep (cold) waters and I'm sorry to say I can't remember where they spawned. Fast and deep running waters seem to ring a bell. Sounds like the centre of rivers to me.As sportsfishers this sounds like the type of fish that tournaments should be based on. Not the ones that you can catch over the side of a boat.Thanks for all of the info. I've seen some of the websites posted here.Onen from the Bay of Quinte."
517968,BD,2002-03-08 16:17:00,739,The blue pike of the great lakes were not walleye. They were a different species which looked something like a stubby blue northern. There are a few Canadian lodges that advertize fishing for blue walleye. Search the archives and the net if you want more info.
517977,Guest,2002-03-12 14:13:00,0,We fished at Cobham River Outpost(Manitoba) two years ago. The outfitter claimed that one of the lakes that we could portage to had Blue Walleyes. Several of our group fished it for two days and caught some nice Walleye and several big Pike....but no Blue Walleye. I had heard of them before and the outfitter didnt push it...in fact upon our arrival he mentioned it has only a bonus. You might check with his website for more info...good luck
517961,Guest,2002-03-07 09:10:00,0,I'm looking for some info about blue walleyes. Do they still exist? Has anyone on this forum ever caught one? Why are they blue?I've seen a few websites about them.
517962,wiggle,2002-03-07 09:39:00,400,"Last September I was fishing on Rainy Lake(Minnesota/Ontario border). One of the guides were fishing with caught a nice ""blue"" walleye. He said that it was the first blue walleye he has seen caught. The next day one of the other boats that we were fishing around caught 2 blue walleyes. I don't know if they are the blue walleye you are refering to, but they were blue. They are a beautiful fish. The back, the dorsal fin, and the tail fin were all a deep blue. Wiggle"

517964,Reels,2002-03-07 09:59:00,2876,"There was an article on blue walleye about two years ago in infisherman magazine. Try searching the archives, you might find it. It was a pretty cool article, but never heard of them again till now.<{{}}><"
517965,Guest,2002-03-07 10:31:00,0,The blue walleye is very common in northern Quebec - they are a very nice looking fishing - they are a very deep shade of blue - almost black - they have a blue tinge on there belly. I am not sure why they are blue - maybe it is because the water is so dam cold....
517966,Guest,2002-03-07 11:55:00,0,"http://www.fishontario.com/articles/blue-walleye/I've heard of their existance in my neck of the woods, but never have seen one. I think there are a few lakes with populations high enough that you may see a few on any given trip. hope this helps"
517967,Guest,2002-03-07 12:38:00,0,"Could these be the infamous ""Blue Pike"" that used to be in Erie? I remember about 40 to 45 years ago my dad used to buy them from the A & P. They were labeled ""Blue Pike"" but actually were the blue walleye from Lake Erie. For some reason they disappeared..."
517969,Bucks Rogers,2002-03-07 13:18:00,43,My partner and I were fishing a northern Ontario lake last fall and aprox 30% of the fish we boated were blue walleye. I have fished the lake many times and never caught any blues but always from late May till middle August. Maybe we just got into a school of blues or do they change color in late fall? They had very deep blue backs and fins with lighter blue bellies. Brownish gold in between.Bucks
517970,Northern Manitoban,2002-03-07 14:32:00,195,"I have caught many of these in a lake here in Northern Manitoba through the ice,some are very blue and some are almost grey in color,all the ones that i have caught and my partner were very small also around 15 inches or so.The lake i was fishing is a hard bottom very milky because its part of a river system.Don't know why they are blue?they are not uncommon like alot of people think.Think it would be nice to see a blue trophy walleye on the wall.What a conversation piece that would be.A replica of course.FISH ON."
517971,Guest,2002-03-07 18:55:00,0,"PEANUT GAVE ME A HEADS UP ON THIS POST REFERING TO THE ""BLUE"" WALLEYE. I HAVE PARTICIPATED IN GENETIC STUDIES ON MANY DIFFERENT WALLEYES FROM MANY LAKES. SOME OF THESE LAKES ARE ON THE U.S., CANADIAN BORDER. THE TERM ""BLUE WALLEYE"" HERE IN THE U.S. WAS A NAME GIVEN BY OLDTIMERS TO A VERY LARGE WALLEYE SPECIES IN THE OZARK,APPALACHIAN AREA OF THE U.S. IF YOU WOULD LIKE YOU CAN CHECK THE ARCHIVES FOR MY POSTS UNDER ""GREERS FERRY LAKE"" THE FISH COLOR YOU FOLKS ARE TALKING ABOUT WOULD BE MORE RELATED TO ENVIROMENTAL FACTORS IN THE LAKE RATHER THAN GENETIC FACTORS ALTHOUGH THE COLOR COULD HAVE BECOME INHERIT IN THE FISH FOR PROTECTION PURPOSES OR HUNTING PURPOSES. VERY INTERESTING TOPIC !!!!! DICK KNUTSON GENETRON"
