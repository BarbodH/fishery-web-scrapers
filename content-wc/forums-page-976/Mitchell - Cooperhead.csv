518087,Guest,2002-03-11 14:41:00,0,"What took Mitchell 50 years to come out with a new reel? I don't know, call me skeptical, but in my estimation they ""modified"" the 50-year old design to try and compete with other brands that have stolen their former brand and product category domination. I have two Quantum spinning reels and love both of them. I also have two Shimano spinning reels and love both of them. I think Mitchell realized they were getting their a** kicked in a robust fishing market by both Quantum and Shimano. Today's smarter-than-yesteryear angler compares products, and Mitchell realized couldn't rely on their ""brand recognition"" anymore to sell their product. So, to get their hat back into the ring, they're promoting a ""new design"". Looks and awful like like the old one to me. I looked at it at Gander Mountain two weeks ago to see if there was anything significant, but it looked like the same old reel....a little more flashy exterior. You don't need to spend too much either on a reel. Both Quantum and Shimano have good reels around $25.00 US and you can get an excellent reel for about $50.00-$60.00 US. Just like many products, the original design was fine IN IT'S TIME. But eventually, someone (or some company) will eventually do it better, much better. That is the case here in my opinion."
