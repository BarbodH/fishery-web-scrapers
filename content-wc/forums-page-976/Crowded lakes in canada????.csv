That seems to be changing with the internet now. Believe me there are a lot of great places to fish and never see another boat. Trial and error stinks when it's unproductive, costly and annual. Unfortunately, when you book from afar, you can't be sure of what you'll get until you are there. My advice (in Ontario) is to look closely at the system you are fishing on. Stay off closed lakes and get into river systems that allow you to move around and provide connection to many lakes."
517350,duffy,2002-03-10 16:17:00,49,Red gives great advice. Thats why I go where I go. 135 miles north of red lake and the nearest road. Many rivers coming into the 5 lakes we fish including the severn and borland. Great fishing for trophies and no other boats other the rest of the people in camp.
517339,sdyer,2002-02-19 09:06:00,34,"I don't get it. I read some posts like the one about eagle lake and I see that areas of the lake can get crowded. Why would anyone go to canada to fish lakes that get crowded? For me the main reason i go is to fish remote lakes where i hardly ever see a boat. Picture this, ""I drove 10 hours to fish in canada including driving on roads that look like afgan roads and when I finally got there I could not get to fish the spot I wanted to because It was CROWDED"". Maybe I'm crazy."

517343,Guest,2002-02-19 14:35:00,0,"I go to Canada every year and have noticed a definite increase in how far people are willing to drive. I am one of those who go to extremes to fish in remote locations and like taking my own boat but if I can get my boat there, others can too. The quality of fishing has decreased as well over the last twenty years. Too many people bringing back too many fish even with the decreased limits. Still some of my fondest memories are of fishing with my buddies and not seeing another boat for days. I guess I will have to start doing more fly-ins."
517341,Guest,2002-02-19 16:18:00,0,But as was stated all our roads ARE like afghan roads.
517342,stewart,2002-02-19 18:13:00,100,Too true :)
517344,Guest,2002-02-20 09:59:00,0,"I politely disagree. I think we are over the hump so to speak on fish stock in NW Ontario. The fishing is getting better each year and the size is improving as well. Limits, angler education is working. The road thing has always been there. Angler pressure is actually decreasing as the age of the anglers increase. The lakes that people say are ""fished out"" in my area are the best producers these days."
517345,Guest,2002-02-20 21:08:00,0,"I agree 100% CanadianGuy!! I fish LOW and it has come back strongly the past 5 years. You folks did a good job getting rid of the commercial fishermen and then learning how to use slot sizes, etc., to bring your fisheries back. I don't think we will ever get back to the days of people bringing fish back to the states by the truck load, but that is not what fishing is all about ... at least from my perspective. Tom"
517346,4bigfish,2002-03-09 10:14:00,25,That's why people con to Saskatchewan. There is no such thing as a crowded lake.www.4bigfish.comMark[email protected]
517347,Guest,2002-03-09 16:42:00,0,Whoever said Eagle lake is crowded doesn't know the meaning of the word. I've fished the west arm and vermillion bay many times without seeing a boat. Same with LOTW.
517348,chrism,2002-03-09 17:31:00,429,"Yep, last summer I saw a total of 8 boats all day long...that is 4 more than I am used to seeing. Definately picking up!In all honesty, fishing as a sport is growing, and face it - we will see more traffic and the fish will take a bit of a hit. People are fishing more than opening weekend - the place where I go has the best Walleye fishing in July/Aug, not may/june as everybody has traditionally thought - and people are starting to clue into this."
