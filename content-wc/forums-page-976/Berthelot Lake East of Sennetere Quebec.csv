518059,Seanik,2002-03-10 18:08:00,218,Been doing the sportsman shows looking for an outfitter for this years trip. Booked a week with Berthelot Lake at their booth in Hamburg NY. Any first hand info would be appreciated.
518060,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-03-10 21:16:00,618,Are you flying or staying at the base camp.
518061,Seanik,2002-03-11 08:23:00,218,"GR8WTHUNTERWe are booked for the base camp/American plan week 0f June 29th. We are a group of retired geezers and have been doing an annual fly-in, getting a bit long of tooth and opted for hot showers and meals. WE c/r and keep enough walleye for a couple of meals, never caught a pike over 10lbs in 20+ years of great Canadian fishing trips, maybe this year.Thanks again,SEANIK"
518062,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-03-11 20:04:00,618,"The pike seemed to be better at the fly in lakes, but I know where you are coming from about the hot showers. I fished the base camp about 6 years ago. If I were heading there this year, I would run up the Megescaine River to the White Goose for atleast 1 day. There is a private camp where White Goose flows into the Megescaine. I talked with these locals. Mostly Walleye fishing at the rapids above the camp by these guys. We caught quite a few decent from the whitegoose to the rapids. One monster was hooked and pulled the snap straight on my buddies Steel leader. Biggest pike that I ever laid eyes on. 2 10+ pike were caught and killed at the mouth of the megescaine. the week I was there. Good Luck"
518063,Seanik,2002-03-12 09:07:00,218,"GR8WTHUNTERThanks again for the information. I have more questions as to what lures are best, leeches ect,. I don't want to clutter up the board, Please e-mail me: [email protected] I will give a full report on this board after the trip in June."

We had three over twenty pounds and released all but one which was saved for a mount. Find the moving water and find most of the fish, especially in early June."
518065,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-03-12 19:46:00,618,"spell check, we were both wrong.lol..Megiscane....Either way, best fishing was at the river. Caught lots of eyes at the mouth where it flows into Berthelot. good luck"
