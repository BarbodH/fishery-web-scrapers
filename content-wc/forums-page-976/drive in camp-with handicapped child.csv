There's a boy(13?) that uses a wheelchair that I have seen several years there. They have a couple golf carts the staff uses around camp and can ""build"" a ramp into a cabin in minutes. The boat dock is built on a ramp so it can go up or down with the lake water level, so no problem there.Bad news is that they are booked solid through August 10th this year."
