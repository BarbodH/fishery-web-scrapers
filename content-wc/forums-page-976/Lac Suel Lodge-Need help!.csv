517026,Guest,2002-02-10 10:09:00,0,"Can't speak to the lodge, but from firsthand experience, rocks are just as hard there as most other places. The lake claims it's share of props and lower units. If the lodge is like most, they will provide you with a decent map. Just take it easy until you become familiar with the lake. The structure that makes for great fishing is the same stuff that will reach out and grab you. The ones who usually get in trouble are those that never look at the map or depth finder (if they have one) and if it's got water over it, I should be able to go there! ENJOY"
517027,Big Tim,2002-03-02 04:40:00,63,"Lac Seul lodge is one of the nicest fishing lodges I've ever seen(IMHO). Last May was our first trip up there & we(4 of us)were all very impressed! Cottages are all new or rehabbed in the last few years, some of the boats needed updating, but we opted for the Lund's with 40 hp. 4 strokes. They were 1 week old when we got 'em & MAN are we spoiled! Super comfortable & the upgrade saved us more in gas than the cost of the upgrade. If you need to use their boat I would 'fer sure get one of these. Dan took over this lodge from his dad, so he grew up on the lake, Him & all his staff are VERY knowedgeable on the lake & friendly. Dan put us on fish EVERY day. One of the best fishing trips of my life ( I'm 52)."
517028,Guest,2002-03-02 23:19:00,0,"I have to agree with Big Tim.I've been fishing Lac Seul for 20 yrs and Lac Seul Lodge is one of the best lodges on the lake. You know your at a good lodge when it's booked solid from opening weekend till August. As for the rocks, you have to be very carefull. Lac Seul has alot of reefs and some of them are not marked. We took an airplane ride over the lake a couple years ago and we were amazed at the sizes of some of those reefs. I've only fished the Northwest section of the lake. I've fished from Sawmill Bay to Mckenzie Bay, South Bay, Broad and Sunlight Lake, and Black Bay, and I'm still finding new rocks and reefs I haven't seen before. What ever lodge you decide to stay at You'll have a great time. Lac Seul is an awsome lake. If you have any more questions, you can email me at [email protected]. Thanks Bill Wyss"
517029,Guest,2002-03-03 07:24:00,0,"can't help you with Lac Seul Lodge but can tell you that you have to keep in mind that Lac Seul is a reservoir and the water level can vary from year to year. This can cause a lot of ""new"" rock piles that you never encountered before when the water was high. The Lunds with 40hp 4 strokes will spoil and tiller fishing guys. They are a real treat. No more blue smoke and rope pulling of the fouled out 2 stroke after a day of trolling.We fish the east central end of the pond and are going again this year in June for about our 10th year in a row. good luck Guide#7"
517030,Guest,2002-03-03 11:15:00,0,"Lac Seul is no different then anywhere else, (except the boulders are bigger and there are fewer people out there to give you a tow back to the dock)That being said, the rules of navigation are esentially the same as any other lake.1.) Have a good map showing the reefs/obstructions 2.) Know where you are in reference to said map (it doesn't do any good to have a map if you're not 100% positive where you are in reference to it!) I've found a GPS unit to be alot of help in finding your way back to the dock if you're unfamilar with the area.3.) Hire a guide for a few days to show you the area (this should probably be #1)4.) If you're not EXACTLY sure where you are or if you're exploring a new area off the beaten path SLOW DOWN!)I've saved my prop/lower unit several times while exploring bays off of the beaten path by going SLOW!5.) The prop and lower unit repair people have to eat too!!!Mike"
517031,Guest,2002-03-12 14:32:00,0,My group has fished Lac Seul lodge for the last decade. I can tell you that the owner Dan McDonald is one of the finest lodge operaters I have fished with in over 40 years of fishing Canada. We fish at his outpost camp on the southwest part of the lake(Black Bay). This portion of the lake constantly yields large quanity and quality fish. We always catch good numbers of Walleye and 3 to 6 lbs are not uncommon. Our group has several avid Pike chasers and they have had many 300 plus fish days with two guys casting spinner baits into weed beds. We always take Leechs and perserved minnows for the Walleye. A depth finder is a must and if you drive your boat with some common sense you can avoid the many subsurface rock piles. Dan will visit camp in the middle of the week and bends over backwards to make sure your trip is enjoyable. Price is right too.
