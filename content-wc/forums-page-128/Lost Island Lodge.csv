I know that you could travel for hours on Lac Seul, but I'm hoping that someone can give me some info on good fishing locations within 20 minutes of the lodge. Thanks for any replies!"

As a suggestion, call the lodge and see if Collin Gosse is available to guide you for a day at the beginning of the week. Friends that have stayed with LIL have indicated that he is extremely knowledgeable and makes for a fun day of fishing. Enjoy your trip. This lodge is on my bucket list. PjShorthorn"

6280268,IaDave14,2019-01-18 13:25:00,99,They have guides on site. I was there probably 7-8 yrs ago and we hired Basil for 2 days. He is an older guy from Newfoundland and his wife is the cook. We had a blast with him -quite a character. Not sure if he is still there.

Live in Florida now, no longer make the trip. Use the guides from the lodge, let them know you want to explore close areas. Plenty of great fishing nearby. Lots of fun to run up the lake and explore, but not mandatory. We had lots of incredible days not only close by, but sometimes within sight of the lodge. If you have a map to look at, I will PM some spots to you."
6281874,Slim03,2019-01-23 06:49:00,159,Shane has maps in the lodge that have some spots marked. Can also talk to Sam and Basil and they can help point you in the right direction. I would recommend hiring one of them for a day.
