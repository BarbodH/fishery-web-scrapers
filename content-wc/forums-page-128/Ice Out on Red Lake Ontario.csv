1101656,Whopper,2009-05-01 07:15:00,340,"Thanks for the update, it's much appreciated. Two weeks from today I'll be in the area and was hoping for a repeat of last year"
1101675,Golden Eagle,2009-05-01 07:45:00,2642,"Enid, I check your site every day. Thanks a bunch. Flew over lots of ice last May 16 and it'll be okay to do the same this May 15."
1101759,geraldh,2009-05-01 13:19:00,6,I am scheduled for a fly-in to Clear Lake which I understand is North of Red lake. I also am interested in the Ice. Dates for our fly-in in 5-21three weeks.Thank you very much for the informationGerald
1102364,Enid Elizabeth,2009-05-04 16:59:00,59,"May 4 and the ice is going quickly now. We have planes in the water at the bridge now and will take a flight by the end of the week to see how the lakes are to the west. I expect that you won't have any trouble fishing Clear Lake. When our lakes to the west of Red Lake are open, Clear Lake should be too. Some people are saying the ice in Howey Bay could be gone in a week, but I'm not ready to predict."
1102385,geraldh,2009-05-04 18:04:00,6,Thank you very much. We have never fished for walleye and certainly never fished earlier than July. I have also checked your blog there is a lot of information about fishing in that area. Gerald
1102566,Enid Elizabeth,2009-05-05 11:04:00,59,"May 5 and Hugh drilled a hole. See video on the blog. http://viking-island.blogspot.com 13 inches in an area with no skidoo or vehicle traffic. Very candled and weak. We can see the ice moving and cracks forming too so may be out in a week, depending on weather! We'll be flying west at the end of the week and will give you an update on the outpost lakes."
