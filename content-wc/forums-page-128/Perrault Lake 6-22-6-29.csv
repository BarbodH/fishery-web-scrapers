6312468,Mojo-NC,2019-04-18 10:25:00,1929,"A second shout out for BornToFish's book, ""Secrets of the Canadian Shield: An Angler's Guide to Perrault Lake"". It's a good read and applies to any of the Canadian shield lakes, not just Perrault. That said, I've seen many posts here where anglers had very bad years on the lake. I can't figure it out - is it the challenge that everyone likes so much? All other lakes I've fished in Canada are either good, better, or fantastic and never bad. I wouldn't go back to a lake where I had bad luck any given year."
6312512,bigdaddyguns,2019-04-18 11:26:00,608,I've fished it on/off over the last 8 years and find the walleyes to be very mobile and dynamic. Locations and patterns don't seem to hold together very long for whatever reason. You need to move thru locations using several presentation methods to hit upon the right combination. The next day it could be completely different. This is especially true during daytime light conditions in mid summer. To supplement the walleye action we have found some very good smallmouth bass and northern pike fishing. We really like the multi-species opportunities the lake offers.
6312910,BornToFish,2019-04-19 09:48:00,1224,"Greetings,My wife and I were away visiting our daughter and her family. Hence, my jumping on this thread is a bit delayed.I have fished on Perrault Lake in the week preceding that in the original post. I have also fished the week after that in the original post. I haven't fished during the week set forth in the original post.I noticed over the years that the fishing in June is often determined by the weather in the weeks leading up to the week that I fished. There were ""warm"" years that moved the fish along in their seasonal migrations. In those years, I was finding fish on the off-shore rock humps.There were years that were ""cool"", such that fish were lingering around the shore lines and near-shore rock humps. It seems that time neutralizes the effects of spring-time weather pattern. By this, I mean that July seems to have more stable and predictable patterns in play.BigDaddy offered great insights into the lake. I believe that there is a fairly appreciable population of walleyes that move into the abyss during June to spend their summers chasing ciscoes. I believe these walleyes are the biggest fish in the lake. I never figured out a good way to target these fish.There is another segment of the population that lingers around structure for the open water season. Experience has shown me that these fish are often on the move. They might move up, down or around the structure on a daily basis. They might leave the structure and go to another piece of structure. Thus, I found it important to search the structure as they might not be where they were yesterday. Furthermore, last year's ""hot"" structure might not be showing fish this year.For starters, I would be looking at the following places for walleyes - especially in the early morning and just before dark: Mike's hump, the humps between Little Duck Island and Burnt Island, along the weed edges by Sand Bar, the Dunes, the hump in front of College Bay, Shore Lunch, Yannah Hump, and the Graveyard/Loomis. I use to check lots of places early in the week to establish a pattern and work it until the fish changed it up on me. Again, focus on the early morning and evening for walleyes.I firmly believe that a strength of Perrault Lake is that something is always biting. As BigDaddy pointed out, the smallmouth bass and northern pike bite can be fabulous during the middle of the day, when the walleyes tend to not be active. If the spring weather is ""warm"", the evening top-water bite for smallmouth can be exceptional!!!I believe that the musky season will be open during the week set forth in the original post. I would be throwing bucktails, twitch and jerk baits over emerging weeds near their spawning beds. I would be looking at places such as Grassy Bay, Burnt Island, East Bay, Camp Island, East Island and Drum Island.Team Walleye: I hope that you and your group have a fabulous time fishing on Perrault Lake. I hope that you make some great memories together! As I mentioned in my book, go with what is biting when you are there. Don't get caught in the trap of fishing last year's patterns if they aren't working for you. That can be like pounding a square peg into a round hole. You will just get a big headache.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6313750,Aspencreek,2019-04-21 20:53:00,2911,"There are several other threads about fishing Perault, very few give it glowing reviews, for any number of reasons. Your experience of having a ""slow"" week may just be what it is. In another post I related that my co-worker who has been going to Canada for several years went to Perault last year, 32 walleye FOR THE WEEK. That's not slow, that's Glacier slow!"
6315076,Bunk72,2019-04-25 09:07:00,1,Greetings Walleye Central members! Would anyone happen to have a copy of the above noted book written by Born To Fish they would be willing to sell or loan to me? Thanks!

6315942,Guest,2019-04-27 21:36:00,0,I have fished Perrault and Cedar for a number of years . And it always a thing of time of year depths and weeds or structure . Wind blowing areas are always a better starting point.I have found bigger sized fish on Perrault but also better numbers on Cedar. I have fished both lakes 2x a year for 15 yrs. I also like to go to other area lakes.AKA lac suel or cliff. for something different. I have fished with John Jakobs. and he is one of the best guides in that area!
6316190,Aspencreek,2019-04-28 21:22:00,2911,"I'm sure there are walleye in those lakes, but my co-worker fished there, I never have and don't feel the need too. My next trip to lac Seul will be my 19th and do not see the need to fish ""the dead sea"". When a veteran of CA fishing catches 32 for the week, (another poster in that thread said it was 28 more than they caught) that is bad. My worst day, and I have had my fair share, was still better than 32 for a day not a week."
6316284,stumcfar,2019-04-29 09:56:00,451,"I am curious how fishing on Perrault compares to say Lac Seul? IF I only catch 20 fish in a day there, I am disappointed. IS there less people or what makes people stop there instead of driving the few extra miles? Not ripping the lake, just curious."
6316314,billy weaver,2019-04-29 12:07:00,470,"Been going to Canada fishing for over 30 years. We always spend some time on a catch and release lake where 100 fish per day is common and 50 disappointing. However our home base is a 20 fish per day lake. I actually enjoy having to work for my 20 fish and the competing with my buddies for numbers. I have come to spend more time looking for the bigger fish rather than numbers, I think it requires some skill you don't need on the high numbers lakes. There was a post about only catching 32 fish for the week which isn't very good but if 20 of them was over 25 inches I would be tickled to death. Don't get we wrong I enjoy numbers but in reality one 30 inch fish would make my week."
6316324,BornToFish,2019-04-29 12:53:00,1224,"Greetings,I believe that Perrault Lake has a number of thigs going for it, in terms of people taking their fishing vacation there. One is that there are four fishing lodges of varying size and price-point on the lake - something for everyone's preferences and budget. One of the lodges offers an American Plan. Three of the four lodges regularly have a booth at the major All-Canada type shows throughout the mid-west, such that there is good awareness of the lake.Another factor is that the lake is a first-rate multi-species fishery. Anglers can pursue walleyes, northern pike, small mouth bass and muskies. My personal bests for these four species were caught on Perrault Lake. Many anglers focus their entire week's vacation on the perch in this lake. Crappies are beginning to turn up in numbers. Yet another factor is that the lake is manageable in size. It's big enough to explore, but small enough to actually learn some things about it within one week's time. Islands rim the perimeter of the lake, such that an angler can almost always get out of the wind/waves when the wind is blowing and still be fishing quality spots.One more factor is that navigation on this lake is pretty straightforward. The known navigational hazards are in places that a moderately experienced boater would expect to find a hazard. I don't know if they still are, but the known hazards were marked with buoys for many years.My last thought is that Perrault Lake is fairly easy to get to in terms of driving distance/time from the border. Guests are willing to travel to Perrault Lake from Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and beyond.Kindest Regards....."
6316326,stumcfar,2019-04-29 12:55:00,451,"I work all week, when I go on a fishing trip, I want to catch fish. Plenty of big fish on 100 fish a day lakes. Everyone has there own idea of what is a good trip, I was just curious as to why plan a trip and struggle for results, especially if it is a common occurrence. Some enjoy the beauty of the day and lake, some are familiar and don't want to change I would guess. Wherever you go, have a good time!"
6316228,BornToFish,2019-04-29 06:50:00,1224,"Greetings,I have about sixty weeks of experience fishing Perrault Lake over the last twenty years. I observed many things over these many weeks of fishing on Perrault Lake. One of my observations is that Perrault Lake is a fairly demanding lake. Anglers need to be on top of their game in terms of equipment and technique to do well on this lake. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this lake caused me to become a much better angler. I am very thankful to Perrault Lake for this.Another observation is that knowledge of location of structure is important to fishing success on Perrault Lake, especially as the season progresses. On one side of the coin, there is a lot of featureless water on Perrault Lake - the absence of structure equates to an absence of fish. On the other side of the coin, there is a lot of structure in Perrault Lake that congregates fish. Learning the location of the structure comes with time on the water.I've observed that Perrault Lake is often not kind to first time anglers on the lake when you bring equipment, technique and knowledge of structure into the mix. I have no doubt that Aspen's colleague is an excellent fisherman, but I wonder as to how much time he has on Perrault Lake in terms of learning the location of structure.I have fished several other lakes in NW Ontario in addition to Perrault Lake. These additional experiences allow me some perspective. There clearly are better lakes in NW Ontario than Perrault Lake when it comes to numbers of walleyes. For example, my wife and I are now fishing lakes where 200+ walleyes per day in the boat is not a rare occurrence. On the other hand, Perrault Lake would be very high on my list if I wanted to target walleyes in the 30+ inch range.As I look back over my years of fishing on Perrault Lake, I cannot honestly say that it is an excellent fishery in terms of multi-species action. There is always something biting for those that take the time to study and learn the lake. I view this as being the strength of Perrault Lake. I will never refer to Perrault Lake as being a ""dead sea"".Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6316242,prov1800,2019-04-29 07:48:00,5010,"Agreed.each lake fishes different.perrault can give up some huge walleyes that would make up for the slower days.20+a person is still pretty good fishing.iam all for that.rather catch one 28-30""walleye over small fish.cedar can also give up some 30"" fish and can have 100 day fish also.both cedar and perrault also have multi species to make it interesting.i love my walleye fishing but hauling them up steady gets old especially for me as I do it on a daily basis.most of my guests feel the same way and love having the oppurtinity to spend some time on smallmouths or crappies plus pike and muskie.great way to break up the day.Even lac suel we don't fish walleye all day we break it up with some smallies and pike.there are a lot of large smallmouths in lac suel and untouched pike.ive been on lac suel with guests strictly for northern pike and never dropped a jig.i personnelly love fishing for tough walleyes.the deep trout lakes have huge walleyes and like the challenge of trying to get them whether I do or not is not a issue for me.Lac suel is the easiest lake to fish in our area but has it's weather drawbacks also.just have some nasty days there where smaller lakes are much better on those type of days.i guess it's just what people what and what makes them happy."
6312166,team walleye,2019-04-17 11:52:00,336,"Headed back up to Perrault this June. Last trip was June 2017 and the walleye fishing was very slow on the lake, we are hoping for better action this time. We are taking a first timer this trip so keeping the fingers crossed. Over the years we have done really well on the lake. If the lake is slow we have a few more bodies of water near by we can take the boat to get on some walleye. Is anyone else headed up this week? We are staying at Rainbow Point again."
6312184,TitanD,2019-04-17 12:45:00,43,This may be obvious and I missed it but why would you go back to a lake you had poor results on unless you have prior history beyond 2017 that suggests otherwise? I would shop for a different lake if fishing was poor. Maybe it was a bad weather week?Good luck
6312188,madnomad,2019-04-17 13:04:00,34,"he stated that they did very well on previous trips,cant fight mother nature all you had to read was a paragraph,lol"
6312194,team walleye,2019-04-17 13:37:00,336,We have had good luck in the past.
6312200,TitanD,2019-04-17 13:55:00,43,That is fair. I clearly did a brief scan and when I saw poor fishing/going back I was like...................what???? There was definitely clarity there and I missed it Hope fishing returns to the good ol days!
6312212,bearfvr13,2019-04-17 14:17:00,174,"I'll be there June 8th for a week trip, and July 6th for another week trip (money permitting, no job as of November 2018). I'm ready for some action. Chuck"
6312236,KSjim,2019-04-17 15:19:00,88,A little off topic but our group had a off year at a lake we had several very good trips to. Rebounded with another couple of very good trips after the off year. I think it just goes to show you even in NW Ontario it can be more fishing than catching under the right conditions.
6312260,TitanD,2019-04-17 17:36:00,43,Agree with last post. Have had some really bad weather in trips that have undoubtedly impacted fishing. We like to move around quite a bit so that coupled with bad fishing generally leads to us moving to another lake fair or not. Have had 2 what I would say are really bad fishing weeks in the 25+ years we have been going North. One drive to and one fly in. I’m not going to mention lakes or outfitters as I’m sure fishing can and is very good under normal conditions. We just never made it back due to our gypsy nature and the extreme desire to see more and different scenery while always looking for that perfect place......still working on that. Good luck
6312306,billy weaver,2019-04-17 19:52:00,470,"I have been fishing Wabaskang for 31 years on the same week. It's just across the road from Perrault Lake and a friend of mine who fishes Perrault reports similar fishing success. When asked about the fishing on Wabaskang, good, bad or what ever I tell them it depends. I have had way more good years than poor. I prefer the water to be on the high side and water temps in the low 60 degrees. In 2018 the water was low and the weather hot 90s and the water temps around 70 or a little warmer. We caught fish but it was like you expect in July. If I had my pick of weeks I would pick the first week of June. I guess in summary you can't rate a lake based on one year. Ask others about other years in the case it just happens to be slow. Sometimes no matter what you do its just slow."
6312330,Guest,2019-04-17 21:09:00,0,check with borntofish. He has written a book about fishing Perrault though out the season. It is a good read for any Canada bound fisher.
