6312266,Ver88,2019-04-17 17:59:00,114,"I almost never use any live bait for walleyes. Most times plastics work as well as live bait. Being successful with plastics often requires a little adjustment in technique. I fish them fast to get a reaction strike. Don't give the fish too much time to look at it. My favorite walleye plastics are big ring worms, big bass style plastics worms, and paddle tails. Most plastics I use for walleyes are 4 to 8 Inches and color varies by day. When trying to help new people learn to fish plastics for walleyes, the biggest mistake I see is continuing to jig like they did with live bait."
6312278,mikear,2019-04-17 18:27:00,436,Are you using larger jigs with the larger baits to keep near the bottom?
6312288,Ver88,2019-04-17 18:56:00,114,I use 1/4 ounce most of the time but I pour my own jigs with largest hooks I can fit in my molds. For big plastics I like at least a 3/0 hook and sometimes a 4/0 if I can make it work in my molds. Keeping near the bottom is usually pretty easy unless there is current or heavy wind. I prefer to fish shallow as much as possible as well.
6312568,Larry S,2019-04-18 12:39:00,665,The last 4 years I have been using Northland Paddle tail minnow in 3 1/2 in size Color Electric Chicken & Charteuse with a 1/4 oz plain jig Have caught hundreds of Walleyes and some Large Pike on them
6312944,Pink Unicorn,2019-04-19 11:41:00,83,"Kalins lunker grubs in white/black/smoke are my go-to. I usually get 5"". You could probably downsize to 4"" being that early."
6313978,Pikeslayer8,2019-04-22 13:58:00,1460,https://www.cabelas.com/product/BASS...E&gclsrc=aw.ds There was a trip about 25 years ago when I had a pack of these hellgrammites and they outfished everything else 5:1.
6313994,Pink Unicorn,2019-04-22 14:39:00,83,I remember that year! Same thing happened for us. Where were you fishing?
6314642,Bill Krejca,2019-04-24 07:16:00,6107,"It is interesting how something works for one person and zip for another! I had a bunch of those hellgramites and never ever could catch anything on them, they went into a garage sale finally last year! Bill"
6315112,stumcfar,2019-04-25 10:02:00,451,"I have posted before, but on Lac Seul, we have had zero luck with plastics, but below the **** in the river, plastics seem to work. We have tried several different types on Lac Seul and I have actually caught more on chunks of licorice than plastic baits!"
6311706,The tank,2019-04-16 03:37:00,340,"I don't use plastics that much any more. I did for decades. Don't see any differences. But when I do I like the big chubby bodied ones or the go to bait from cabelas I use them to slow the drop of my jig down when fishing gets slow. Colors would be purple ,glow white ,chartreuse ,pink and orange."
6311798,kona77,2019-04-16 07:39:00,236,"Our first choice is always Gulp Minnows or the Berkley power minnows. As others have stated Kalin, Gulp etc. power grubs or any of the various paddle tails have also worked well at certain times.. White and chartreuse are usually colors that work anywhere. Color combo's like pink/white or green/orange also work.. last year my brother tried a bunch of different small crappie type baits and they worked really well.. We have discovered that certain baits and colors work better on various lakes. One of our best baits on a lake we visited 6-7 times was a Gulp brown leech.. This was early in the season before mayfly hatches and the walleye's just nailed this bait. We have not had the same luck on several other lakes with this bait.. Good to have a decent selection of different plastics and colors when you visit a new body of water."
6311876,olderfart,2019-04-16 11:51:00,18,"Not to knock a certain product, but on the fly-in lake we fish Gulp products do not work at all. We took some Gulp minnows and leeches a couple of years ago to test them out...they would be really convenient if effective. My brother and I had on identical setups on of a jig and twister tail...he tipped his with a salted minnow and I tipped with a Gulp minnow. After about 45 minutes he had boated several dozen walleye and I had 0. Next day same setups except leeches instead. Same results. We have friends that use them with great results, so the moral of the story is don't put all your eggs in one basket until you know the lake...even then some variety is good due to changing conditions year to year."
6311888,Mojo-NC,2019-04-16 13:05:00,1929,"I like to use a 3"" curly tail and always carry an assortment of colors. Sometimes I use a double tail. I used to joke that you can use any color you want to catch walleye as long as it is chartreuse, but I've since changed my tune. Now I like to mix it up and see which color and style curly tail works better.Chartreuse is always a good choice, but white, pink, orange, and combinations of the above work. Sometimes a brown tail with a black jig head works, especially during a mayfly hatch. Last year my favorite color was a 1/4 or 3/8 ounce metallic gold jig head with either an almost clear gold metal flake curly tail, or red motor oil metal flake curly tail, both tipped with a minnow.Northland Tackle and VMC make good jigs with good quality hooks."
6312002,andreindy,2019-04-16 19:07:00,308,"When looking through my current assortment of paddle tails and grubs to bring on my fly-in, I notice the majority of my baits are 4"" and represent a wide variety of manufacturers (Impulse, Keitsch, YUM, Z-Man, Mister Twister, etc). I do not have the fishing experience or time on the water to know if 3"" is generally preferred over the 4"". Generally speaking, which size do you fish with most often?"
6312048,prov1900,2019-04-16 22:42:00,544,"Early in the year, when the forage is small(er), I like to use the smaller baits, 3"" or less. As the season wears on, upsize your baits to ""match the hatch"". When fish are aggressive, I don't think you are hurting yourself using the larger profile plastics though. Big bait..big fish. On a side note, don't limit yourself to one style. Some years, paddletails kill it, other years its a split tail. Those two baits fish a little differently too."
6312076,tweedrules,2019-04-17 06:38:00,107,We switched last year to something new for us. Keitech crazy flapper in white. Worked great.https://www.keitechusa.com/catalog/crazy-flapper.html
6312144,Herkyhawk00,2019-04-17 10:49:00,33,You continued to fish with a gulp minnow catching not one fish while your brother caught several dozen? lol Not sure if that reveals your incredible stubbornness or impressive determination.
6312176,olderfart,2019-04-17 12:20:00,18,Probably a little of both..wanted a good test.
6312192,Ricky Spanish,2019-04-17 13:27:00,1298,I have tried the same test against my wife. I think I let her get to about nine before I declared minnows to be the winner.
6311274,dschiebel,2019-04-15 00:21:00,85,"Would like some help choosing plastics color and brand for jig fishing in Spring time Canada. There are so many kinda lost. We are fishing East of Red Lake about 40 miles Mink Lake, or Little Shab Thanks"
6311384,vteye3,2019-04-15 08:14:00,496,"I like white, orange/yellow, green/brown natural, pink in 3-5 inch curly tail bodies. I rarely use less than 1/4 oz (spring high water) and like jig heads in white, yellow, orange, chartruese, and mixed colors."
6311406,oleJoe,2019-04-15 08:41:00,114,"Our group has been using plastics for over 20 yrs and have always caught fish on them. Colors.... just like the rainbow. I have been happy with chartreuse clear most of the time. Pink an white, yellow an white, Berkley power in red has worked, black and white on cloudy days I use 3"" most of the time and have got them from wall-mart, Bass pro, and Cabela's when I bought a hundred at a time. It really didn't make a difference on the brand. I usually take 3 or 4 20 packs of different colors and almost always use between 20 and 30 for the trip. These are all twister tails and I,m sure the new paddle tails will work also. Just don't go overboard when you buy them. I got my tackle box packed already for this years trip and looked in the drawer and I have 37 packs along with a lot of spoons and baits..(spares). I just wish that old age didn't get here so fast. Enjoy your trip"
6311498,olderfart,2019-04-15 11:56:00,18,"Almost always use 3/8 oz jig and 3"" Mr Twister single tails tipped with a salted minnow or piece of crawler...3/8 oz because we are usually dealing with some wind and they are easier to keep in contact with the bottom...Mr Twister has always seemed to have better action than others...color favorites are white, light green, yellow and chartreuse in any combination, with white on white my ""go to"" color combo, and adjust from there. Tipping with some ""meat"" really increases production...we use salted minnows because live minnows are prohibited where we go (Zone 2) and we have found them to work as well as live at much less cost."
6311516,SimonHockey04,2019-04-15 12:45:00,25,Do you find that using the Mr. Twister and bait outperforms just bait?
6311530,olderfart,2019-04-15 13:07:00,18,"Yes...mainly I believe because if only using a jig and no tail, if the ""meat"" is lost, you are fishing with a bare jig only, putting your catch rate near zero."
6311544,KSjim,2019-04-15 13:51:00,88,"Our group has had good success using Kalin 3"" grubs in orange, white and firetiger. We also normally tip with a minnow. Last year we tried the B-Fish-N Pulse R swimbaits with very good results. We did not tip them. The large paddle tail worked best without the minnow. Our group will definitely have a good selection of the Pulse R's with us this year."
6311560,jambi,2019-04-15 15:22:00,504,"1/8, 1/4, 3/8 jigs - VMC Moon eye are nice but any work. I like to use the lightest possible as long as I can still feel the bottom. Wind is biggest factor; hard to stay deep with 1/8 oz if blowing too fast. Tails - 3"" mostly. Brands I like are Kalins, Mister Twister, and Powerbait. I have only about six colors in my box: Pearl, Firetiger, Watermelon w/ Red Flake, Motor oil, Electric Chicken, and Brown/Chartreuse."
6311570,adempsey2.0,2019-04-15 16:11:00,611,"3"" Grubs - brand doesn't matter too much. I use Yum, Kalin's, Yamamoto and Mister Twister. Yum Walleye Grubs are usually the least expensive and still very effective. Colors - White for sure. You could probably get away with just using white. I also like Bubblegum Pink. For Yum, I use the Pink Blush which is half pink and half white. Chartreuse is always good and maybe add a more natural color like grey, brown or green. I also really like using a copper color at times. However, I use pink or white 95% of the time.3"" Paddletails - Plenty of choices here as well. Northland Impulse Paddle Minnows are good (white, electric chicken, fathead - all colors are good). Berkely PowerBait Ripple Shad 3"" to 4"" is another (uncle rico, fire perch, firetiger, white - all colors are good). Berkeley PowerBait Rib Shad in any color also work well. Berkley Gulp alive minnows always worked well for me too. Jigs, be sure to bring some heavier stuff too. 1/8, 1/4, 3/8/ 1/4 are all good standard weights. However, on windy days you might want up to 1 oz. So, I recommend having at least a half dozen each of 3/4oz and 1oz.I would suggest you may also consider the Live Target Yellow Perch Rattlebait or the Rapala Rippin' Rap in the 1/2 oz size. These things are deadly for walleye!"
6311672,ziggyzag,2019-04-15 19:53:00,125,"Been using what are called Flap Jack Paddle Tails the past (4) trips, all on different bodies of water. The results have been great! Primary colors have been white with red flake and white with black flake. Jig heads in 1/4 - 3/8 oz. Primary colors Hot Pink, white, chartreuse & black. I do agree with the other posters choices but thought I would share this for something new and at a good price. Most of the time we have been fishing with no bait but some do use a little night crawler. *50 pack Flap Jack Paddle Tails $8 *100 pack 1/4 oz. jig heads $29 *100 pack 3/8 oz. jig heads $35 Crawdads tackle Cadillac MI.
