6315770,olderfart,2019-04-27 08:30:00,18,Go to a car salvage yard and get a used scissor jack...light and easy to stow.

6315864,Lazy Ike,2019-04-27 15:50:00,464,https://www.tirerack.com/accessories/detail.jsp?ID=67 Aluminum. Low profile. Not too heavy. Stays in my truck. I have seen like models sold other places.
6315866,Pooch,2019-04-27 15:51:00,4618,I bought a new scissors jack from Farm & Fleet couple years ago. Welded a nut on the shaft you crank. Now use an electric impact to raise and lower it. I carry the battery impact (Milwaukee 3/8) for changing flats so figured why not use it to also raise the jack. Also carry a 2x12 to use as a base under the jack to stabilize it. I also put a light lithium grease on the threads as the impact isn't smooth when raising the trailer.The jack is not heavy duty enough for lifting the truck if needed.Just another thought/option.Pooch
6315868,Pooch,2019-04-27 15:54:00,4618,"That is the same jack sold under many different names. We have one for our race car. Good little jack, but takes up a lot of room to store. Just don't lift a heavy 3/4 ton truck with one. They are over rated.pooch"

6316000,Bill Krejca,2019-04-28 08:13:00,6107,Definitely carry some various wooden pieces for a jack base. Bill
