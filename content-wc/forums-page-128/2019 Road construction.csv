6314260,Bstar,2019-04-23 07:11:00,564,I'm not looking forward to getting that red clay crap on our vehicles again. I think there is still some on it from 2 years ago!
6314264,pjshorthorn,2019-04-23 07:21:00,5654,"Well, I have to believe the moose won't be very happy about that project. I may be one of the few,but I like the 502 route. I was able to see my first and only lynx on the side of the road and it let us know it wasn't happy by peeing the moment we stopped. Although wildlife is a dangerous possibility, aggressive driving is even worse on that stretch. Unfortunately, road construction on many of our routes heading north are inevitable.......the trip is always an adventure . PjShorthorn"
6314402,SimonHockey04,2019-04-23 13:42:00,25,How big of a project is it supposed to be exactly? Will it be finished by August? That is when we will be traveling on it.
6314404,rosh1,2019-04-23 13:55:00,275,I think its over 20miles of resurface. Don't know when its going to be done.

6314466,reddemon2,2019-04-23 17:44:00,255,According to the Ontario Construction map there is no roadwork planned on 502 or 11
6313024,kettyspanky,2019-04-19 14:48:00,271,"If you are guessing if there is road construction in Minnesota, well there sure is. You can check on by google 2019 Minnesota road construction. Hwy 53 has some passing lanes being put in this year. I think 1 south of cook, then 1 south of orr. I believe a couple north of orr also. I work road construction, often in Minnesota and I'll be there some time this summer. There is some resurfacing going on as well. Just a heads up to plan ahead. Good luck and be safe."
6313036,Jeler,2019-04-19 15:02:00,92,"Excellent info, Thank you! We'll be spending the evening outside of Cook on our way north into Ontario, so we'll be right in the middle of it!"
6313050,andersaki,2019-04-19 15:45:00,1426,There is a very handy free app for that. Download MN511. It shows road construction areas and slow downs. andersaki
6314052,reddemon2,2019-04-22 16:27:00,255,Remember border crossing bridge in Intl Falls is under construction also
6314144,bearfvr13,2019-04-22 19:14:00,174,I haven't seen any info on this? Do you know if we can still cross at this location? ThanksChuck
6314148,TitanD,2019-04-22 19:35:00,43,Nothing new really! In 25+ years of going North can’t remember one that did not include construction along the way.........minor obstacles. Just don’t try to do it all at once or push the pace. It will all be there when you get there! Drive safe everyone
6314150,prov1800,2019-04-22 19:43:00,5010,Went across the border a couple of weeks ago and did not see any construction going on then.
6314196,prov1900,2019-04-22 23:22:00,544,I can't imagine that they would ever shut that thing down. Way too much commerce going both ways there....plus that toll.
6314220,Bstar,2019-04-23 05:42:00,564,Does anybody know if there's going to be any roadwork on 502 this year?
6314254,rosh1,2019-04-23 06:59:00,275,yes just south of Dryden. Going to start soon as they can. Hear its a big project.
