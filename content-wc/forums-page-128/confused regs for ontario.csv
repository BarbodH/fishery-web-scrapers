It includes: fish you don't release right away fish you eat fish you give away Your daily catch limit counts towards your possession limit. Possession limit The total number of a species of fish that you can have in your possession at any time. It includes fish caught today and in the past, whether they are: freshly landed in your car or boat in your cooler at home in your fridge or freezer Your possession limit does not include fish you have: eaten given away //www.ontario.ca/page/fishing-limits-size-restrictions-and-catch-and-release#section-1 So I guess if you caught a couple of walley on Tuesday,but did not eat them until Wednesday,you could only be in possession of 2 fish,because the two from tuesday are now Wednesdays fish. But if you ate Tuesdays fish on Tuesday you would be good to keep 4 fish on Wednesday. I dont keep much and I'm ok keeping what I need day to day,but I can see how easy some people can get confused. The part that confuses people is the part that says your ""possession"" limit does not include fish you have eaten. But your ""catch limit "" does. So ,yesterdays fish in your belly somehow became part of ""today's catch"" if you ate it in the morning.,but not the day before??? I know this has been discussed before,but I thought I'd bring it back up to remind people to read and re read the regs. And if your still not sure,ask your outfitter and hope they know the right answer. The part that confuses me is where it says Your possession limit does not include fish you have eaten Your catch limit( which counts towards your possession limit) does include fish you have eaten. Am I having a ""moment"" or could this somehow be worded in an easier to understand format?"

Pretty much impossible for a Game Warden to know if you have eaten 1 or 2 fish for your shorelunch, but it's designed to prevent someone from catching 4, giving them to some or eating then catching 4 more."
6316146,prov1800,2019-04-28 17:47:00,5010,The regs are hard to follow and confusion.if your fishing in zone 4 you can catch and keep 4 walleye and that would be your possession limit and you would not be able to keep anymore unless you would eat them.if your fishing in zone 5 your daily possession would be only 2 per day with a possession of 4.tricky regs.so all lakes south of the cnr in zone 5 only 2 fish daily. All lakes north of the cnr tracks has a 4 fish Poseidon 4 per day. Hope this helps.
6316188,sagecreek,2019-04-28 21:14:00,24,"ive been in spots where a game warden came up to a campsite and counted the carcasses of the fish fried for lunch, then asked the anglers in the area if they were the ones who used the campsite for lunch, if one of the boats said they did, the game warden then counted the fish they had on the boat or on their stringers and if they had more than the 4 per day they were allowed, they were given a ticket. the explanation given , the fish were in their possession prior to lunch and were part of their daily limit. just because they ate some of the limit , doesn't mean they didn't possess them. to throw another iron in the fire, if you cook your fish, leave it in the fridge and go fishing, they are still part of your daily limit , even if it has been in the fridge for a couple days. go figure"
6316220,Shellback,2019-04-29 06:06:00,8083,"I tend to be more concerned with about the length of fish. I fish the St Lawrence, zone 20, and it's 2 fish with a conservation license, only one being over 24. something inches. So I could have a 24"" fish and a 28 "" fish. But zone 18 is any waters north of the St Lawrence. I fish those also, and there max length is under 20""s. If I was traveling home with two 24 inch fish from the St Lawrence, and I would be driving in zone 18, A CO might try to bust me."

As I remember, there were a lot of what-if scenarios, but no firm conclusions drawn. It would seem it possible to strictly be at the hands of the officer checking you out. A good rule seems to be to always be nice to those in a power of authority. Bill"
6316390,PA troutguy,2019-04-29 18:38:00,58,"I got stopped on the water and the first question the Conservation Officer asked me is what are the slot limits on this lake. I replied I have no idea I throw them all back, I take a picture or two of some. He said okay, checked my license and then the cooler for alcohol we had a nice chat about where the pike were biting and off he went."
