LOTW, Minnitaki, Eagle, Pelican??? I don't live in Sioux Lookout 51 weeks out of the year, so I don't personally know the ice conditions. It looks like it is going to get warm and stay warm. Let's hear it!"

6312082,prov1800,2019-04-17 06:55:00,5010,been on a couple of lakes all week.ice conditions are still pretty.had 10 inches of slushy frozen stuff but yesterday most of that went.seems to be 20 inches of good ice but with the warmer weather moving in and some rain being forecasted that ice wont last much longer.it can go from good to bad fast.fnally above zero overnight.that ice will be around for a couple of more weeks but will be gone way before opener.typically may 6 its gone so ill stick with that.
