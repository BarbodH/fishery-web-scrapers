6308192,Jeler,2019-04-05 14:23:00,92,"Couldn't agree with you anymore. Nothing like flying into a remote pristine outpost or camp site to find ""trash"" in the fire pit. Rather disgusting!We use these year after year and they work great!https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0...PT8Q3UO3&psc=1""Carry it in-Carry it out"""
6308206,jambi,2019-04-05 14:55:00,504,We burn plastic.
6308330,Bstar,2019-04-06 07:46:00,564,"I agree, no plastics in the fire pit for us either. We will burn some of the cardboard boxes though. I do like the plastic flask idea. I might have to order a set. How sturdy are they?"
6309376,pike50plus,2019-04-09 15:43:00,584,"and what else you want to bring, plus cost factor. You only get 1 duty free case anyway?"
6312864,gmattbruin,2019-04-19 07:23:00,174,"I notice most are answering the question from the pov that you either flyin your beer before as opposed to with you and added weight. We buy all our own beer at home and have made quite a switch over the yrs from name brand beers like Canadian, Coors,etc to favouring a mix of those and craft beers. It all gets weighed, we are always over weight, but then we take in what we need for the 1st few days and our left behind beer gets labelled ours and comes in on a followup mid-week flight....always just in time!!! No extra beer costs from the outfitter, saves him buy our beer, etc. Works for everyone all around. Ill admit, it is hard to get on the plane though and see several cases of your beer sitting on the dock as you take off....almost like leaving your child behind..LOLOL"
6312882,Ricky Spanish,2019-04-19 08:39:00,1298,Both if necessary.
6307312,ljcs789,2019-04-03 12:01:00,42,"So if my outfitter will fly in beer ahead of time and not charge against our weight allowance, am I better off? Or should I try to watch my wieghts and pay the overage? I see that beer can be pretty spendy up north."
6307316,jambi,2019-04-03 12:18:00,504,"If they have the brand of beer you want; buy it from the outfitter, have it flown ahead, and forgetaboutit. Easy deal."
6307348,Wickguy1,2019-04-03 13:21:00,14,I use to bring my own until I discovered Labatt's Blue. Well worth the extra $ when I visit.
6307420,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2019-04-03 18:38:00,240,"Hi--our outfitter charges $52 a case for Blue/Molson's and $27 a case for pop, to be flown in the week before. Pricey? Yes. But there is nothing worse than having to deal with weight restrictions the morning of the fly out. With 100 pounds/person weight limits (which includes food and beverages), it's pretty rare to ever be underweight. As so many have said, it's a vacation. Within reason, bring what you want to have a good time. Addressing the beverage weight in advance has meant that we are almost always within the weight restrictions. To me, it's very much worth it!"
6307440,martinbns,2019-04-03 19:47:00,1520,"Drink rum or vodka with frozen lemonade or OJ, easy"
6307454,kona77,2019-04-03 20:19:00,236,Agree with the comments from Mich/Walleye Guy.. We always have our beer flown in ahead of time.. Just a lot less hassle trying to deal with the 100lb weight goals most outfitters have on fly-in's..I believe it was $50/case last year. We do take in a couple of bottles of booze with us and mix it with powder drink mix. We pour the booze into empty quart milk jugs after we get across the border. Saves on weight and we can just burn the plastic with our normal trash..
6307462,adempsey2.0,2019-04-03 20:58:00,611,"A case 24 cans of beer weighs ~20 lbs. It is simple math from there. Personally, I fly it in ahead of time if I can. Just one less thing to deal with.You can pay the overage, sure. It really is not that much $. However, the biggest issue is will it even get on the plane with you? That has always been my problem. Depending on the outfitter, you may get it the later that day, the next day or maybe on a mid-week check flight if your planes cargo is fully loaded. Could always split the difference and bring some and pre-order some if you bring several cases."
6307798,middle son,2019-04-04 15:54:00,15,Nothing nastier for the environment than burning plastics..... I can't believe people still do this. If you pack it in YOU pack it out.Freakin' amazing........
6308016,TitanD,2019-04-05 08:10:00,43,"We generally have our beer, soda, water, potatoes, onions and oil flown in if the outfitter will do so for us in advance. Some charge a little more while others only charge the cost of the goods and just fly in as they are opening up the camps or doing check flights. Our group is notorious for bringing everything but the kitchen sink with them and trying to coordinate them has proven to be like trying to herd cats over the years. As the trip organizer I just tell them we will be ordering in advance those items and ask them to give me their orders...........not an option for our group. Good luck."
6308166,btyreprich,2019-04-05 13:13:00,1067,could not agree more. We NEVER burn any kind of plastic and hope the original poster changes their ways. I myself have even been know to take home certain plastic items so as to recycle them! At least bring the plastic items back to camp for proper disposal.
