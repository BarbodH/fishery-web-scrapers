6313936,prov1800,2019-04-22 11:42:00,5010,Been yet another great ice fishing season here in the Vermilion Bay area but after yesterday its time to be safe and give it up.Still plentyof main lake ice but the places we access the lakes are getting very soft and pulling away from shore.Yesterday we made it on and off the ice but it was pretty hairy.Iam sure that today its worse.Warm temps here over the last week have the lakes melting pretty good.Crossing the lake we had to dodge some pretty big holes yesterday but had a super last day icing 30 plus lakers.Hate to give in but not safe to continue.Will wait for ice to pull further from shore and then we can soak for lakers from shore.Hopefully within the next 2 or 3 weeks we will have some open water.

6314130,prov1800,2019-04-22 19:02:00,5010,your welcome.lol.Few weeks to melt yet.But its on its way.Going to pull my boat out and get it ready to go.Hopefully its gone by may 8 or so have some lake trout dates.
6314134,That Minnesota guy,2019-04-22 19:05:00,8293,You got a few days of rain forecast? Nothing like rain to damage ice.
6314142,prov1800,2019-04-22 19:14:00,5010,we have rain in the forecast wed.have about 16 inches main lake ice.ice lifted and is draining surface water.lots of big holes we had to dodge on sunday out there.its looking good for ice out.
6314362,wmd,2019-04-23 10:53:00,388,How much snow have you had this winter? Do you think water levels will be higher this spring than last year? Thanks wmd
6314370,prov1800,2019-04-23 11:05:00,5010,Weve had just normal snow.probably be low as usually lately.what snow we had is gone now.just depends on how much rain we get.lakes with larger rivers coming in will be high. Lakes like lac suel or eagle will be low.either case as long as l can can my boat launched that will be fine with me.
6314384,rosh1,2019-04-23 12:02:00,275,pro some nice looking fish. I have my fingers crossed for some spring rain and the lake levels higher.
