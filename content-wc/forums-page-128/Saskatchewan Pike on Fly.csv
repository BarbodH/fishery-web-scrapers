6315192,spoonchucker,2019-04-25 13:39:00,82,What my son did not relate in the article is that I would estimate he caught about 125 pike using his fly rod on that 5 day trip- I am not a fly fisherman but it was amazing to me how they preferred the fly. I caught almost all my pike on the spoons. My son also found that the pike were readily attacking those paddle tail swim baits. Outfitter delivered fully.

One fun experience stands out and has stood the test of time. Fishing from shore below a falls on Corneille Lake, I took 26 pike on 26 casts, using a jig for bait. As I was after walleye, and could not get the wire leader attached jig down to the bottom without catching a pike, I finally gave up and moved on. Funny, though, catching all those pike indicates the fun that they can provide. Bill"
