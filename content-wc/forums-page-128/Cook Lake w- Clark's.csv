6310198,Jeler,2019-04-11 13:09:00,92,I searched here but could not find info on this outpost lake operated by Clark's. Does anyone have any personal experience fishing on this lake or it's portage lakes (Bumpy & Cavano)?Thank youJeff(trying not to be blown away in Iowa)
6311042,kona77,2019-04-14 09:55:00,236,Jeler- I see you have not had any responses yet.. I have fished a number of lakes with Wayne/Karla but not Cook.. You could contact the Clark's and ask for names of folks who have fished Cook to get information about the lake. They have always been able to provide references on the lakes we have fished.. It is always nice to get information on a new lake to help you get started.. Good luck

Generators to run electricity, free minnows, free bottled water, good beds, appliances, good boats, motors and the list goes on. Most importantly excellent fishing on the lakes we have been to. We have our favorite but have enjoyed every experience with them!Wayne/Karla and Megan are very good to work with. Good luck"
