6310176,NorthernExposure,2019-04-11 12:45:00,6,"We used to fish the Ignace area and would randomly catch lake trout fishing for other types of fish. Or we met a trapper that lived back in the bush and he would tell us where to go and what to use to get lake trout. For the last 15 years or so the lakes we fished didn't have lake trout in them so we haven't caught any. This year we are going to a new area with lake trout and plan on spending some time going after them. It will be mid June in the Silver Dollar area. We do not have down riggers. Searching though old posts on here I see you can jig for them or troll for them as the most popular methods if they are not shallow. My current plan is to get some 3 way swivels and run Fluoracarbon from that back to a rapala or spoon and add some sinkers to get it down for trolling. For jigging I have some white tube jigs that I have read work good or spoons. But I have a few question for those that go after trout.1. How much weight do you typically run to get your bait down when trolling? 1 oz.=30 ft down 2 oz=45 ft?2.How do you locate trout, is it just driving around and watching your electronics? Is there anything they relate too(rocks, sand, ect..) or do they just roam around in the open deep water?Any tips or techniques you have figured out would be greatly appreciated. The Canadian lake trout are great grilled and it's been A LONG time since I had one. We will try for them on smaller lakes less than 3000 acres if that matters."

I remember having success close to mountain island fishing with heavy white bucktail jigs with a sucker minnow in about 80ft of water. That area of the lake has holes 300ft deep but the fish are suspended you will need a fish finder but it shouldn't be hard to find a few. Others that were there at the same time were trolling with down riggers and they had more success with that approach then us but we were lake trout rookies"
6310370,adempsey2.0,2019-04-11 19:52:00,611,"For trolling I typically use 1 oz. of weight for every 10 feet of depth with 100 feet of 20lb braid out. So, I would often use 3 to 6 oz. of weight when trolling spoons for Lakers in the summer to target to 30 to 60 foot range. Sometimes 3-way rigs, but now I mostly just use a rubber band or a home-made clip-on weight. Works just fine for me since I only fish them open water a few times a year. In mid-June, you will probably be fine with 3-4 oz. at most. Just have one person start with 1-2 oz. and the other 3-4oz. and see who gets a hit first. They may even still be shallow if the ice out is late this year (I HOPE NOT!).I target structure. Points, mid-lake humps, that sorta of thing in 30 to 100+ FOW. Key is finding the depth they are at and getting your lure there. Line counter reel helps. Worst case, get a cheap line counter that you can attach to your rod. Rapala makes one. They aren't great, but do work."
6310502,Limeyangler,2019-04-12 08:30:00,563,"I fish lakers open water from my boat fairly often, i'm in dryden Northwest Ontario. I have trolled for them using all the above methods (Thanks DEMPSY for the info on weight depths.) but find my most productive way is jigging. Like you said, troll around and watch your electronics like a hawk. When i see something on the screen I use my spot lock and start jigging, before I had iPilot spot lock capabilities I would throw out an anchor. I then drop the jig over the stern under the transducer and you can see your jig and the fish just like ice fishing using sonar. Even if you lose sight of your jig you will see the fishing chasing it. Takes a bit of practice to know where to place your jig to see it/ boat control etc but well worth a shot as it is a hoot to catch them this way, trolling bores me to be honest. I also catch trout in 18-20 feet of water at the time of year you are coming when I'm fishing walleye, they stay shallow quite a while after ice out. Tube jigs, jigs and minnows, lipless rattle cranks all do the trick. don't be afraid to jig aggressively as trout love to chase, they will often hit as the bait drops after you reach the top of a jigging action, watch for slack line and set the hook! happy hunting"
6310604,pike50plus,2019-04-12 13:01:00,584,Lakers like slower speeds and S turns. 1/2 way spoons have a great alker wobble too. For jigging 1 oz roadrunners are greathttps://www.google.com/search?q=dips...hrome&ie=UTF-8
6310642,Baseline,2019-04-12 16:55:00,3207,Without down-riggers you can use lead core and rig up for trolling. You can also use 2 OZ Northland trout jigs with bucktail. They are good to 100 ft if you drift in light winds. Buy the type with the treble stinger hooks and add a piece of cisco to the main hook or spray with a scent. . Rig with 20 to 30 lb braid because you don't want and stretch in deep water. If you hook up make sure you really cross the fish's eyeballs with a good hook set. There are lots of vids on Utube for laker fishing.
6310668,Bill Krejca,2019-04-12 18:37:00,6107,"Or, you can still fish for them like you would for catfish - several dead minnows/offal on a treble hook and a sliding sinker. Cast the rig out, let it settle to the bottom, and wait for a bite. Not a very finesse way to fish, but deadly if you are on the right spot. This method pretty much requires that you keep the fish because it is very easy to gut hook the fish. If this is not your intention, try the white tube jig or trolling method. I try to still fish off of an island/point that has deeper water on the sides of the normally prevailing winds, i. e., west and south, and cast to the diagonal. Can either fish from shore, or use two anchors and fish off shore in the boat - not many folks do this, but it works very well. Bill"
6312664,prov1800,2019-04-18 17:07:00,5010,We use that method as soon as we have enough open water from shore Bill.i usually get some suckers from a creek and use pieces of that on treble hook and cast it as far as I we can.nust let it settle on the bottom and wrap line around a pop can and leave bail open.it a unreal way to catch them.great fishing while your in limbo.
