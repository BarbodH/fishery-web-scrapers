It's so important to get kids into fishing EARLY, but to make sure they have FUN doing it. I think a lot of dads, uncles, and grandpas want to take kids fishing, but they are apprehensive and worry the kids won't be safe, won't have fun, are too young, or it will just be a disaster. Let me tell you, with just a little bit of planning and forethought, you can start taking very young kids on fishing adventures they will LOVE and remember forever. A little patience, a little planning, and a LOT of snacks is all you really need. So I challenge you, on your next trip, take kids! I started mine before they could walk, and now I have a whole crew of fishing buddies. Best thing I ever did was start them young."

My daughter and son both started fishing long before Kindergarten, and now as adults, plan vacations around fishing. Now we have a grandson, and he helped his Gramma land bluegills just after his 1st birthday. Honestly, he would watch the bobber, and squeal when it went under the water. What fun for all of us. As you said, a little planning, and being willing to fish when they want, and play and or explore when they don't is important. PS. now my daughter will spend more time, and out fish me and her brother. Help the next generation learn to have outdoor fun!! Tx Jig Tyr"
6302600,Conrad_Turbo,2019-03-21 16:13:00,3,"I agree. I've taken my little one on our 14' aluminum boat since she was a bit over one. We only lost one rod over the edge of that boat. A tip is to tie a small rope from the butt of the rod to something in the boat and it's far easier to retrieve. Now she's 7 and we fish off our 30' cabin cruiser, there is nothing better than coming out of the cabin with a cup of coffee and seeing my little girl fishing off the back of the boat first thing in the morning in her pyjamas. My little boy is 1-1/2 and he's getting into the sport as well. The only problem (sarcasm ) with a family that loves fishing is that I'm the one getting everyone prepped and ready, and watching them catch all the fish. It's so much fun!"
6302602,iBigmacius,2019-03-21 16:26:00,334,My girls love to go in the boat. They love catching fish and just being out on the water. I started my oldest around when she 6 and my youngest when she was 4. https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...96e10d72bb.jpghttps://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...2f0489b02a.jpghttps://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...d56b2d2970.jpghttps://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...b3df933190.jpghttps://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...04577f8052.jpghttps://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...6941bfedb2.jpghttps://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...8c455bd490.jpgSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

6303250,andreindy,2019-03-23 10:19:00,308,"Nice to read. I think a contributor to success is obviously positive experiences, which may or may not include catching fish (that certainly helps). It's amazing though how much laughter can help compensate for lack of action. Or even good snacks. Conversely, it's amazing how an angry, screaming, belittling uncle can can take the shine off an experience...I always felt awful as a kid for my cousin seeing him trapped in that boat with that man. Him and I would make up for it as younger adults on excursions to Cass Lake, MN. I remember how grateful he was when I would invite him with us."
6312570,SimonHockey04,2019-04-18 12:41:00,25,"My Grandpa and Grandma are the reason why I love fishing so much. 6 summers ago they introduced me to the world of fishing. My grandparents took my two cousins, my mom and dad, my brother, and I. It was August, we stayed at a small resort on a small chain of lakes in Park Falls, WI. Five out of the eight of us were newbies and my grandparents hadn't fished very much since they moved from Northern Ontario 30 years ago. We caught four fish all week but, nevertheless I was hooked on fishing."

I have cancelled many trips with the guys due to the guys not wanting kids along..... that's fine, we did our own thing. Now he is 12, and I nearly never fish without him. Life better now."
