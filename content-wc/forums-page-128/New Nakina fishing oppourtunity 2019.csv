I recently found out that they have acquired an outpost camp on Little Makokibaton Lake, part of the Albany River. They plan to open spring of 2019 after some deluxe renovations. Cant wait to book this, as this area has some really great fishing. Can't wait. Has anyone fished this lake before? and how was it?"
6146793,vteye3,2018-04-20 12:12:00,496,I am familiar with Mak and Washi down stream on the Albany where is little Mak ? Google map does not differentiate.
6146865,Mike Borger,2018-04-20 12:37:00,1554,Feeds into the main lake via a narrow channel on the south side of the lake just east of Makokibatan Lodge. Good sized lake with direct access to the big lake.Was talking to Kyle Polesky myself already about this new camp. If I wasn't already booked solid for this year I'd be going.

It will be interesting to see what they do to it. That cabin sits in what in some years is a pretty swampy location. Not every year, but enough that we always figured that to be the reason that we never saw anyone using it."
6313324,Crede,2019-04-20 10:55:00,134,Reviving from a year ago. Has anyone booked Little Makokibatan for 2019? Or know if the cabin was renovated and is going to be used this year? I saw it listed on their sport show booth pictures but don't see it mentioned in the Brace Lake 2019 online brochure.
6313338,Namegosikaa,2019-04-20 12:17:00,61,"Rates and info are on the website, I haven't read the brochure but a good detailed description is up and I assume little makok is up and running"
6313346,Crede,2019-04-20 12:46:00,134,Rates and description have been on the website for a year. But new online 2019 brochure doesn't mention it. Wondering if anyone has more info.
6313470,chris.brock,2019-04-20 19:59:00,112,I'd say give them a quick phone call and get a definitive answer
6313512,Mike Borger,2019-04-21 06:13:00,1554,"As soon as they can in May they're sending a team in to rebuild the cabin. Talking to Kyle it sounds like it's going to be really nice. New boats with 20's on them as well.He's definitely taking bookings for this year, not sure if he has any yet though. Whoever books will be in a brand new cabin with brand new boats/motors."
