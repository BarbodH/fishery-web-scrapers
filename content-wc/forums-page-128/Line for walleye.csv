6314992,The tank,2019-04-25 05:17:00,340,My real I pull spinner rings is 30# power pro tied to the bottom bouncer and my jigging rods have 10# tatsu floro. I use to do the power pro with a floro leader liked it but that's a pain sometimes so I went all tatsu. I like the all tatsu route the best.
6313844,olderfart,2019-04-22 08:27:00,18,"Have used Trilene XL 6lb test for years...now it's getting tough to tie on jigs even with my ""cheaters"" on...will it hurt to go to 8lb test for easier tying??"
6313854,camp chef,2019-04-22 08:42:00,915,I have used 8# my whole life.
6313892,prov1800,2019-04-22 10:04:00,5010,Not sure if your loosing jigs due to hang ups or pike bite offs if that's the case then can't help you.if it's about changing jig colors or other baits get some some quick change clips All though if your eyes are bad might have trouble with them to.but they do work great especially if your changing crank baits.ive used them all winter to change lures out.
6314070,Aspencreek,2019-04-22 16:54:00,2911,#8! I have been using 10 to 14. The fish don't seem to mind.
6314140,TitanD,2019-04-22 19:13:00,43,I switched from the Berkley Trilene XL 6 clear to green many years ago and it helps tremendously and no negative impact whatsoever to my Walleye bite. I saw recently (maybe have been around for awhile) jigs with larger eyes to tie off to. Thinking I might give them a go. TiePro also makes a device for tieing knots on jigs......pretty slick. My dad has used one for past few years and loves it.Good Luck
6314172,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2019-04-22 20:42:00,240,"Hi--On our fly-ins, I always bring an old Abu Matic 170 reel with 8 lb. Gold Stren in remembrance of my dad. The high visibility of this line makes it a good choice for those who place a high priority on that factor. I catch some of our biggest fish of the trip on that old-school combo. That particular reel was built like a tank, and had a very good drag system (at least for a spincast reel). So, yeah, I buy a 2400 yd. spool of 8 lb. gold stren every 4 or 5 years. It is excellent line for shallow water spring fishing, and is a very tough line, also."
6314194,prov1900,2019-04-22 23:20:00,544,"The older I get, the more my eyesight fades as does my dexterity. That said, the heavier line might not make a difference to eyesight necessarily, but it will help the fingers work a little better. In my ""younger days"", (I'm 51 now), I could tie knots practically blindfolded and use very little line to make that knot. Now, I might tie on a jig using 12"" or more of line just to be able to work the fingers... Try that and try increasing the power on the cheaters. Maybe just have some high powered ones that you leave in the boat."
6314228,fishron,2019-04-23 06:06:00,317,"I usually use 10 lb test fireline or braid, tied to a tiny swivel with a two foot length of flurocarbon. Great sensitivity and easy to cast. On a wild lake, I think you could direct tie 50 lb braid to a jig and do just fine."
6314246,Bill Krejca,2019-04-23 06:29:00,6107,"Clear blue (or gold) 6-8 lb Stren used to be the line of choice for me, even though I was still relatively young, because it was easy to see. I now use Power Pro braid 5-8 lb test, in the yellow, because it is easy to see - it will turn white eventually, probably, and it will still be easy to see. I have no trouble tying it, using an improved clinch knot, double wrapped around the hook eye. Maybe when I get old, I'll go for a bit heavier, I'm only 80 years old now. Bill"
6314280,rockape,2019-04-23 08:12:00,215,"I've used 8# Trilene Sensation for 25-30 years. I don't think I have ever had it break even with big pike nailing my jig. Biteoffs? Yes, but that doesn't count. I'm 50 now, and yes, the eyes (mine-not the fish!) aren't as good as they were. My only trouble is if the sun is shining right down on me and my line while tying the knot. We will see in a couple of months if it is more challenging than before."
