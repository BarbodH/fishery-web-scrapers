One nineteen, lots of 18's and lots of 17's. Anything that looked like a minnow worked well. Pistol was the best, but anywhere you found the right structure, they were there. Notherns were all over the place. Largest was 46"". She must of ate a bunch of walleyes because her belly was distended and a very heavy fish. Lots of fish in the mid thirties. Only on muskie in the mid thirty's caught casting for smallmouth. Walleyes was another puzzle. We caught fish in at the brush pile and two thumbs, but other than that really didn't find major schools. Fished Rasberry, Wild Edge, Burnt, and got a few here and there, just not stacked. Largest was 29"" with several 22""-24"". We honesty caught most of our walleye in bays in the weeds in about 4'-8' of water. Huskie Jerks worked well here. Weather for the most part was very warm the first part of the week and turning cold as we left. Water was in the 70's surface cut quickly cooled down to 64-66 after a wind change and cooler temps. Looks like the water dropped about 6"" during the week. The exchange rate kinda sucks now with the weak U.S. Dollar. That $35 bottle of Smirnoff you pay $16 back home for really costs you $35 now. Gas was about $1.08 a liter. Some camps say they are down 60% plus from previous years. Gas prices, customs, reduced limits, harder fishing? Hard to put a finger on one thing. Many days we only saw a boat or two while fishing. Kinda like the old days. I like that, but worry for the resort owners. One last side note. Malcolm sold the Marina and Friday was his last day. Same person that bought Birch Island Resort bought the Marina from what I heard. Rough Rock has a new owner also. Tight Lines, Reels <{{}}><"

We liked Mike and Wendy who owned Birch Island, and are apprehensive about the change. Malcolm, I believe, is Birch Island Resort owner's brother, though I am not definite. Have you heard anything about the new owner? Sounds like a good trip. Thanks for the report, Don"

I must tell you that in my 30 plus years of fishing out of what is now Paridise Cove 2 (www.paradisecoveminaki.com), this has been one of the best for Walleye. If we wanted eaters, it was the brush pile or the entrance, but if we wanted larger fish to catch and release it was up on the sand beach in Big Sand, 8 to 10 feet of water along the rock shore with leeches. I would guess that fishing from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM there were at least 30 plus fish caught in the 23 to the largest being 28 plus inches. The Powder Puff also produce large numbers of Walleye. Weather was excellant and the fishing was the best in a lot of years. If you want some excellant fishing this summer, head to Minaki or e-mail Paridise Cove and they will tell you how the fishing is.

558290,Guest,2006-06-11 12:53:00,0,"Reels, Thanks for the information. When we were there, there was a man on crutches that attached to each arm that came to the lodge some, and hung out at the marina, even offering to get gas. Must be the same fellow. Thanks, Don"
558291,Reels,2006-06-11 14:02:00,2876,"Yep, that would be the guy. If I remember right it is him and his brother? Not to sure on that part. Didnt get a chance to talk to him. I hope he does well. I heard Sunset might be going up for sale too. Just time to retire. <{{}}><"
558297,Guest,2006-06-11 19:29:00,0,"Thanks for the report Don, I have been going there for about 5 year but am unfamiliar with the brushpile or the Powder Puff - can you point me in the right direction as to where they are? Glad to hear things are going at the sand beach - that is a fun spot to fish. Good to hear about nice eaters being caught. Anything other tips for our group who leave this Saturday (17th). Thanks for your continued posts, I really appreciate the update. Fork-Nutz"

However, I've also heard the reef on the north side of the north passage between Big Sand and Little Sand (north of Harbour Island), also called Powderpuff Reef, so don't know which one the post actually referred to. The Entrance is just north of Octo Island. The Brushpile is just southwest of Octo Island. Chuck"
