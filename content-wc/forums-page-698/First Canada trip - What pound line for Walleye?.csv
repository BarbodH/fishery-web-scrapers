558160,Crappie Kid,2006-06-07 16:08:00,1581,I will bring 2 medium action St. Croix Avid spinning rods up to Eagle Lake the first week of July. I will also have 2 casting rods and 2 musky outfits. On the spinning rods I was thinking 8 lb Trilene XL in green. Any comments and/or advice on this choice?
558165,2746,2006-06-07 18:56:00,3206,I've gone to fireline on all my spinning outfits for walleye. Much more sensitive and resists abrasions etc. Usually use 14# which has a diameter of 8# mono. If you have not used fireline you'll be amazed at how much more you feel when jigging or rigging.
558173,Guest,2006-06-07 23:39:00,0,"I use 8lb. Trilene XL all the time (also green). I have a lot of confidence in it. The green will look invisible in the clear / stained water. I think it is the best mono going. I know a lot swear by the fireline. I use that with my crankbaits, but I have not tried it with jigs and rigs."
558176,Guest,2006-06-08 05:56:00,0,"I use PowerPro on all my rods with 20#/6# diameter on my jigging and bouncer rods and 30#/8# diameter on my crank and spoon rods. It's great stuff and I think I have pretty good feel with it. Your St. Croix rods will probably make a bigger difference for feel than the line will, though."
558177,jigman 2003,2006-06-08 06:52:00,981,"If you are going to cast a lot of jigs in low light conditions, it's nice to have a highly visible line. I use Iron Silk in bright green and ofiginal Stren in gold. I have not found the colors to spook fish, especially in Canada. What makes the line nice is you can see any ""tic"" and get fish that you'd miss if you can't line watch. Oh, sorry I forgot the pound test. I like 8 lb. No decrease in # of bites and better abrasion resistance. One thing I've found with Power Pro, Fireline and other ""super braids"" is that if you're fishing a body of water with a lot of snags (wood, rocks, etc.) they get to be a pain (literally). If you can't straighten the hook out with the stuff, then you have to wrap your hand or grab a metal tool to get your lure back. Or you end up cutting the stuff off with a knife or scissors. I realize that you do that with mono too, but mono is pretty cheap. I do like Power Pro for musky casting and for trolling any crank bait. Other than that, I think mono is superior IMHO."
558180,Mohleye,2006-06-08 08:48:00,368,"I think the 8 lb green mono is a good choice. I've always used 6 lb green, with good results. There are many fans of the super-lines, I go along with Jigman's comments. If you're trying to position a boat either backtrolling or drifting in tough windy conditions having a line that doesn't break can be a real pain. Seen a few rods snapped, too, because the braided lines have no stretch. If you have extra spools, give both a try."
558210,FISHNBOWLJOE,2006-06-08 21:46:00,80,"I'm leaving in the morning for Dogtooth Lake. We'll be spending the majority of the week fishing for walleye. My buddy always uses 6# line. He says even though you might lose a few fish, you'll catch more of the larger more finicky ones by using lighter line. He caught a 33""-10# plus walleye there last year. As for me I took his advice. I don't know what brand line he uses, but I'll be using 6# P-Line Floroclear. One of the guys at the local Gander Mountain told me about this line. I finally had the chance the last couple of weeks to use it. I love it. Looks like I've finally found a replacment for my old reliable Trilene XL. It's limp and casts well, has low stretch and not too much memory. The florocarbon coating makes it stronger and more abasion resistant.The knot strength is excellent too. I'm really impressed. Hope this helps. Good Luck and Good Fishing! Joe"
558212,wooglin,2006-06-08 22:08:00,371,"I use 10lb Trilene on my walleye rod, and 20 lb. fireline on my northern rod, and 80lb. powerpro on my musky rod. In the future, I'd consider something like 14lb fireline for walleye fishing, as the diameter of the fireline is really small. I like how tight the line feels... I use 10lb on my walleye rod because I don't want to lose big fish. I've never been underwater to notice fish NOT eating my bait due to larger lb line, so I stick with 10lb - and I catch plenty..."
558213,Guest,2006-06-08 22:47:00,0,First of all good posting...........I just got back on Saturday from Wabaskang. I have been using 6lb Xl for years and love the sensitivity and casting ability. However this year I lost four or five big fish which I suspect were northerns. Also I brought my aunt along this year and she put on some power pro. She seemed to catch as many walleyes as me and lost fewer fish. I am thinking about giving it a try. Most reels come with two spools. Spool one up of each kind and try them both. Good luck and have fun! Brent
558237,vandest,2006-06-09 11:15:00,3,Another vote for 8lb XL. been using it for years and switched back after a few seasons on the super lines. Better for snags and easy to work with.
