Now for the fishing It's back not sure if it's because the water is at normal levels this year or if it's the new regs. but had some of the best fishing in about 6 years. We started by going south to the Dalles then to powder puff soooooooooooo many fish between 12 and 18 inch. that we lost count. on Wed. we wanted to go for some big walleys we asked Duane the owner of Paradise where to go he sent us to the beach in big sand between our 3 boats we landed 33 fish between 21 and 29 inches, one of the best days of fishing I've had in my life. All in all a great trip Fab cabin and great fishing who could ask for anything more."

We had no problem as well with them though we fished just before the beach on the elephants hump and managed a few real nice ones. I'm not so sure about the new limit restrictions as much as the slot size restrictions. Your good fishing report sounds like others so lets hope it signs to come
