Just slice the canned potatoes and add some onions then fry before you do the fish. I dip the fish in canned milk then shake in a ziploc with flour seasoned to taste. ...reelxtc... <*}}}}}}>< ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"

Take a pound of bacon, cut 1/2 wide crosswise down the whole pound, fry about 1/2 way and drain. Throw in with the spuds. Bring a dozen eggs with you in the morning in the cooler. Stop for brunch, start frying the bacon and spuds, when near done, drain a off some of the grease, crack in the whole dozen, and scramble. When it's done, put a lid on the pan, set aside, and start frying fish. If you can, bring along a fresh muskmelon. It takes a little more planning, but it's worth it. It's a change from shore lunch. We do it the last day of the trip, and I never get complaints. See you on the water 6-14."

Typically what we do, is bring a pan and small burner with, a bit of oil and some breading (Shore Lunch brand) or something easy in a box. Just do the fillet, bread, fry and eat thing. Many guys on here swear by cooking over an actual fire on the beach/shore, but we just bring a burner. With a 4 fish per person max (not that we fry that much at shore lunch), there is no need for potatoes or veggies. There is plenty of time for them when I get home. Canada is about eating fish, along with the good times, memories, wilderness..etc."

Next, place tomatoes, asparagus and mushrooms over top. Season with salt and pepper, squeeze some lemon and place a couple pads of butter on top. Then throw on a heap of parmesan cheese (one cup is not too much). Seal the foil pouch and place over open fire or barbeque. It takes only 15 to 20 minutes or you can check if the fish is done, it is done. Yum Yum Le pic"
