I don't want to fish for lake trout on RL--have seen them in suspended schools in Pipestone--because I know there are efforts to help them make a comeback on big Red, but are there any nearby lakes that can be driven to from Cochenor (sp) to fish for them and are there boat rental accomodations at those lakes?"

Try Flat Lake for some monster Muskey...I know of alot of little lakes with very little traffic that provide quality pike and walleyes but I'd have to blind fold you to take you there... Mista Walleyes hidden treasures... I have a few boats laying around the playground... And yes the walleye garden is always blooming... Mista Walleyes guided tours if I'm available..[email protected]"
558234,pikemike,2006-06-09 10:52:00,95,Mista- that's the kind of reply i'm after!! our fall trip is the first full week of september. i'll email you sometime in August. Where's Trout Lake and how far of a drive is it from RL? THANKS
