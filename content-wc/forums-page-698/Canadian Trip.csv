Cabins are nice and clean and boats are good, they have done a lot of work on the camp. We fished Wabagoon / Dinorwic for about 12 years but I can't help much with the west end of the lake. We mostly fished the east end of Wabagoon and Dinorwic. Indian Point seems to get a lot of repeat business so they must be doing a good job. Rich Jhttp://www.indianpointcamp.com/services.html"

555712,walleyegeek,2006-03-28 13:55:00,3,"Hands down, Aikens Lake Lodge in Mantoba. I fish all the Walleye tourneys in Man, Sask, and Ont, have been to several fly ins and lodges and trust me... Aikens, bar none, produces the largest walleye anywhere... period! Not to mention the Northern's are massive here as well. Gerry and Lorraine and their son Pit run the lodge and will amaze you with service and hospitality. WalleyeGeek"
558002,hoowaa,2006-06-02 14:17:00,6,You could try Southshore Lodge as well. I've been there once and had a fantastic time. I plan on getting up there later this summer with a crew of my friends. www.southshorelodge.com/Default.asp
558013,Capn Hooker,2006-06-02 23:28:00,333,"Cedar Point Lodge is a great place. Great people, great facilities, great service & great fishing. I'll be there the 2nd week of July."
558085,Heartguy,2006-06-05 12:58:00,1,"Just got back from Wabaskang. Stayed at Peffleys Camp. Very nice. We stayed at Kingfisher 3 years ago. It was the first year for the new owners. Not a bad place but the view out your cabin is looking at trailers at Gawleys Resort, and there are 3 other camps very close. Not my idea of Canada. Peffleys is away from the crowd at the other end of the lake. Wabaskang is a great lake to fish. We found fish every place we targeted with 5 northern over 38"" and the largest walleye at 28"" with multiple others over 21"". Heartguy"

558268,Guest,2006-06-10 11:46:00,0,"Better walleye fishing on Eagle Lake, North Shore Lodge was awesome. Wabigoon we stayed at a great lodge called Hubers. Awesome German Cuisine, but the fishing is average. We now stay at Totem Lodge on Lake of the Woods, and fishing and accomodations are far superior than the above. Have a great time !!"

555451,Guest,2006-03-19 18:00:00,0,"Spent two weeks at vermillion bay lodge at eagle lake last year with wife and kids. Nice camp, not far from town, one free meal, and they clean the fish for you!! Good prices and Gord and his wife and son are very nice people. If going to eagle lake look at this camp. Taking the family?"
555460,grt1,2006-03-20 10:54:00,259,"I fish eagle lake in the spring and a couple times throughout the year and I think it is very scenic and the water is pristine, If you fish the west arm of eagle you might want to look at Stanleys West Arm Camp. It is a class operation and the owners are good people."
555464,Guest,2006-03-20 13:04:00,0,"Our group has fished Wabaskang Lake for 14 years from Peffley's Camp (formerly Lundy's Camp) on the north end of Wabaskang Lake. We have always enjoyed the clean, comfortable cabins off the roads and the excellent fishing close to the camp for walleye, northern and smallies. The portages to Wine and Beaver Lakes are great as well as the foot portage to Lost Lake."
555466,Guest,2006-03-20 14:28:00,0,"If you are considering Wabigoon, check out Dinorwic. Brown Bay Camp is a homey place that has really improved in recent years. (no restraunt or other five star type amenities). People are great and run a good camp (very family oriented). I have been going there for 15yrs. From Brown Bay to east end of Wabigoon would be about 7 miles, but Dinorwic is also a good lake."
555638,hobartrd1,2006-03-25 13:27:00,4,Thanks for the info. Does anyone know anything about Indian Point Camp on Wabigoon?
555639,hobartrd1,2006-03-25 13:29:00,4,Thanks for the info. Does you or anyone else know anything about Kingfisher resort on Wabaskang?
555640,hobartrd1,2006-03-25 13:31:00,4,"Thanks for the info. Yes, I am taking my dad and two sons.Do you know anything about Cedar Point Lodge on Eagle."
555642,fishmaster,2006-03-25 15:25:00,209,"Don't think you will be dissapointed if you go to Eagle Lake, has a lot to offer. Check out www.vermilionbaylodge.com Clean cabins good boats with decks very nice family run camp"
555646,Trailerguy,2006-03-25 17:14:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Kingfisher is located right off hwy 105, in the area known as the ""river"" in Wabby. It's close enough to hear the water flowing over Perrault Falls. Kingfisher is an older camp but all the basic needs are there, it's just not as fancy as a newer facility. The owners purchased it about 3 years ago, but I've heard they are good hosts. They mostly use 14' boats and 25 hp motors I beleive, which is adequate for the lake unless there's a high wind and big rollers on the big lake. But you can still fish the end closer to camp. The flats and the big part of the lake is probably 6 or 7 miles north. There's plenty of places closer to fish, and the outfitter will know where the fish are biting at. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
