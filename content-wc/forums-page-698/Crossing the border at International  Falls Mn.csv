558223,BigDave2,2006-06-09 08:28:00,104,Any idea what we can expect for time to cross the border on a Saturday morning in June at International Falls? How early to avoid the rush?
558225,Guest,2006-06-09 09:36:00,0,1 to 2 hrs.......earlier the better
558241,Guest,2006-06-09 12:13:00,0,If you go to the Customs web site http://www.cbp.gov/ they give daily time estimates for the border crossings.
558243,Guest,2006-06-09 14:30:00,0,We've had no waiting when crossing around 6:00 AM. Anytime before 7:00 should still be good. Lines start to form anytime after that - late morning gets lots of day trippers mixed in with the rest of the boaters/vacationers. Once year we hit the boarder at 10:30 the line was blocks and blocks long. Guys were getting our of their cars bringing back buckets of chicken and pizzas. We like to cross earlier and have grab some breakfast in Ontario.
558244,Guest,2006-06-09 14:34:00,0,Been there late morning in June and July when the line was miles long. We drove down the road to Baudette and saved some time in line but spent more in gas. We still waited a while in Baudette
558257,Guest,2006-06-10 01:11:00,0,What about Sunday afternoon??

558276,Guest,2006-06-10 20:45:00,0,just came out this morning at 7:00. line coming in was well around the corner and would imagine 1-1/2 hr wait at least.. go through friday night and stay in dryden or sioux narrows.. much less of a headache. im still rocking from the trip as we speak.. jig out
558277,pmarasco,2006-06-10 21:11:00,13,I crossed at Pigeon River yesterday morning on my way back from Savant and the wait at 12:30 going into Canada was only 12 cars. The line to come back into the States was quadruple that. But we still only waited 45 minutes.
