Plan on mapping tracks on my handheld gps with our guide's permission to help. I also have a basic map, but just wonder if there are other pointers from the veterans out there to keep from making that expensive error that sacrifices a prop or lower unit to the LS gods. Thanks!

558172,Guest,2006-06-07 23:38:00,0,You'll be fine with what you just described. Have your guide mark hazzards on your map if you want to go where he doesn't show you on your first day

When we get familiar with the areas, we put the hammer down. Don't forget to wear your lifejacket - yes, you probably can swim, but when you're crankin' at 40mph, and hit that rock pile and smash your head into the dash, you can't swim when your unconscious.... Bring an extra prop too."

Ground both up on a rock we never saw coming and in an area we've gone over 100 times. Point is, even when you think you know the maps and you think you know the routes and you think somebody has told you everything to avoid, you can still find something to smack. As mentioned, wear your vest, take it easy and be smart."
558203,Guest,2006-06-08 15:38:00,0,"I will second that. Been going to LS for the last 6 years, dinged a prop for the first time last year on a rock that was 6 inches below the surface. I was in 14 feet then ""Bang"" that thing was 20 feet from shore and as big as a Buick. I was backtrolling at about 1mph, and it still threw me out of my seat Best advise, go slow if you are unsure, keep your eyes open, and take nothing for granted. Play follow the leader, and wear that PDF, even at low speeds."
558208,Guest,2006-06-08 20:23:00,0,"I would recommend buying a good paper map before your trip. This should give you a good idea of the major hazard areas and have your guide mark up other hazards on your first day in the areas you intend to fish. Other than that I would recommend staying a fair distance away from shorelines and don't take tight turns around points. Always have someone in addition to the driver keeping a lookout for abnormalities in the water. Most importantly driving down the middle of the lake is no safer than the shoreline, I have to imagine the majority of major damage occurs when people are running wide open down the middle. Be very cautious after windstorms and/or heavy rains, a lot of times we will see logs of 50+ feet floating down the lake that broke away from shore and they can be very hard to spot."
