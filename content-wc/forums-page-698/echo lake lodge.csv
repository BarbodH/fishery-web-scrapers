558168,Guest,2006-06-07 19:57:00,0,"Echo Lake is an interesting place. I was there several years ago, and one friend returns every year. As you know, they pick you up and move your stuff down to the water with a four wheeler atv with a trailer, after the trip by your vehicle on the logging road to the parking lot. There are a number of lakes to fish when you get to the camp, which is maybe 5 miles down the lake. The lake which the camp is on has pike and trout. The largest lake for walleyes, Detour Lake, is across the bay and over a portage, where a bunch of camp boats are located. He also has an outpost cabin there, which you can use at no extra charge. It is a little rough, but OK if you like a camping atmosphere. You will see no one else but the people from camp. I got a 29"" walleye on an adjacent lake that can be ""easily"" pushed/motored to, up a creek. I did not find the walleye fishing to be outstanding, but do not think we gave it enough time. The portage walk to Detour can be a little challenging, but is OK if you don't mind carrying your gear, and walking on a log ""corduroy"" path in places. Motors and gas are already over there. The cabins are very nice, for what I am generally used to, and the owners are first rate folks. The camp was formally a fly-in, it is located in a beautiful area. Take bottom bouncers and worms. Good luck, Bill Krejca"
