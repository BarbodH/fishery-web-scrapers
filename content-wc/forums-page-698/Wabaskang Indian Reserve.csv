558218,Guest,2006-06-08 23:47:00,0,"I've been going by there a long time (2 weeks a year for a couple decades). You'd be the first boat to stop that I would have seen. Another words if there open and they got it..not sure I would want to drink it. Plus I had a bad experience with three indians many years ago that came from the same dock. Three came out two had long guns and all were drunk. They were mad because my dad and I were apparently fishing on their land. Last I knew boats travel on water, but it was not the time to argue with three drunk and armed indians whom are mad at you. The ironic thing is that several years before that my dad had hired a couple of indian guides and they showed him the very spot we were fishing in. Back then I had a slow boat. Not any more! Brent"
