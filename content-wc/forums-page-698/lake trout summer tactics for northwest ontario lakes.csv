558224,Guest,2006-06-09 08:43:00,0,"For the tactics you have mentioned you need heavy equipment. When the trout are deep use a white tube jig tipped with a live minnow or sucker belly, and jig for them. Or you can use some sort of silver spoon. I usally leave trolling for lakers in spring time. Over the years as the water warms in summer we have switched from down riggers to jigging as I have mentioned. If your flying north you'll have no trouble catching lakers regarless which way you choose. If you plan on trolling try the Gibbs teaspoon . The biggest one. Every trip everybody starts out with something different. By lunch we all have the Gibbs on. We use this with live minnow. I have also toyed with salmon tactic's with cut herring. I have caught , but I don't have enough practice on that one yet , but should work for the big trout ."

You can tip with plastic, Gulp!, or bait, but I've caught most with a plain bucktail jig. If you have a sonar, find fish and vertical jig, letting the jig hit bottom occasionally, and pausing occasionally during the lift/drop. Active fish are usually roaming around 40-60 ft, and usually near baitfish schools. You can troll spoons, crankbaits (recommend large husky jerk in tenessee shad color), or the heavy jigs, and probably anything else you can think of. I usually use 3 oz snap weights or in-line keel weights, but might try a 3-way setup this year. Deeper fish on bottom are usually inactive, and often smaller, but you can arouse their interest with a jig thumping bottom nearby. Morning is normally best. If it is windy try the leeward side if the wind is steady, open water if the wind is variable. I use 30# Power Pro and a 6' section of 30# fluorocarbon leader. Works fine for me, but I'm sure there are many other options."
