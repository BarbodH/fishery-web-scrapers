558183,Guest,2006-06-08 10:01:00,0,"looking for motel in International Falls, just a place to spend night on June 23rd, anybody have a place to recomend-- also do you need a birth certificate this year, or next? I have made at least thirty trips, but have always drove straight through--time to slow down. thanks"
558186,wooglin,2006-06-08 10:55:00,371,"Birth certificate and drivers license this year, we've never had issues with that. I've read that next year you need a Passport - but I've also read that this rule doesn't go into place until Dec. 31, 2007...someone will clarify."
558189,JDP,2006-06-08 11:56:00,1457,No passport needed currently. Check these sites for border crossing info:http://www.infonorth.net/http://www.canadawelcomesyou.net/travelreminders.html Good luck on the room. Most motels will fill up far in advance. An idea would be to check the I-Falls Holiday Inn. If they do not have a room they may recommend a different motel based upon your needs. Or you could call 1-800-fallsmn (visitors bureau). Good Luck and Have a Nice Trip!:-)

558202,Mohleye,2006-06-08 15:37:00,368,"I would check the Ft Frances hotels. Nice to have that border crossing out of the way. Rendezvous and Super 8 are both good. If you're going west, Emo Inn is also good."
558207,cunn6776,2006-06-08 19:05:00,8,Just stayed at the Holiday Inn in International Falls last week. Great bar and the rooms were fine.
558214,Guest,2006-06-08 22:48:00,0,Cross the border in the evening. No wait and no hassle in the morning. Super 8 in Fort Francis is good. Has a nice continental breakfast. Ak1
558215,Guest,2006-06-08 23:02:00,0,"I have stayed at the three major hotels (Holiday Inn, Super 8 and Days Inn)in International falls. The Holiday Inn was nice, but pricey, Your paying for the pool. The bar was nice, but the restraunt was less than desireable and its off the beaten path a bit. The Super 8 and Days Inn are next to each other on HWY 53 as you enter International falls. The Super 8 was nothing special and cheap. The days inn was a step anove the Super 8. Both are right next door to a good restaurant callled the Chocolate Moose. About 40 Minutes south is the Americinn on Pelican lake in Orr. It also is right on HWY 53. Pricey also but a very nice hotel, quiet and pool w/water slide. I stayed there this year due to being worried about thefts in international falls. I was towing a new 2006 Lund 2025 Pro V and was a little gunshy. I have heard noting but good things about the Rendevous in Fort Frances (mostly hear on WC). I hear they have a nice hotel and there is great restaurant attached. I will be trying this place in the fall. Comes down to personal preference. If you want a good nights sleep that is reasonable I would stay at the Days Inn ($63/night). If you want a good night sleep with a nice pool and waterslide then the Americinn is for you. ($125/night). Hope this helps, Brent"
558216,Guest,2006-06-08 23:07:00,0,Also on the border crossing. They only asked for our drivers licenses..no birth certificates. I have been told a passport is the best way to go if you have one. Due to recent terrorist activities the US has been screening heavily and it took about 1 hour and 20 minutes for us to cross on June 3rd (Saturday) back into the US. It was mid morning. So an early morning may be quicker. It appeared like they were x-raying every boat which slowed things down a lot. Brent
