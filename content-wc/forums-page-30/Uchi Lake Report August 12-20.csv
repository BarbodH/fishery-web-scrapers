Weather Temperatures were hot for the first couple days and gradually cooled down as the week went on. Nights were always cool which was perfect for sleeping. Wind was not an issue except for a couple quick storms that rolled through. As mentioned we had a couple storms roll through which brought some intense rain but other then that rain was not an issue.Lodging Accommodations were great as usual and was always clean and tidy. The lodge just recently acquired star link so wifi was available at all times throughout the property which was a plus. Generator runs 24/7 so no loss in power at all during our stay. Food was excellent as usual with various meals served throughout the week. Shore lunches were always an option if that’s what we wanted to do and of course we opted into that a couple times and what can I say about that….mmmm.The staff worked extremely hard to make sure we were as comfortable as possible and well fed and kept the boats clean and fuelled up. They were always available to answer any questions we had as well as letting us know about any new “hot spots” on the lake. Fishing The walleye were always active with the mid morning bite being the best. Best patterns were sitting on one of the various shoals in the lake in 15-25’ of water and using 1/4 oz jigs with a minnow or half a crawler. Jig colours didn’t seem to matter that much but I was using pink or chartreuse most of the time.Our last day we found an incredible spot (small 2’ rise on a flat bottom) in 20’ of water and we caught an easy 50 walleye in just over an hour with the biggest walleye of the trip coming off that spot (27”) The average walleye caught during our trip was 19-21” with several 23-24” caught as well. Pike action was a bit slower then past years but still great…..we have been spoiled with the pike the last couple years. Small to medium size pike were always active in the various weed beds. In the past we have had great luck trolling large deep divers in 20-40’ of water but this year the bigger pike were just outside the cabbage beds in 10’ of water.Large spinner baits and swim baits were the hot baits this trip. Biggest pike for us was a 38” beauty caught on a large spinner bait in 6’ of water on a weed edge. There is a “bragging board” that is updated in the main lodge with every groups big fish, numbers or any other kind of good fishing information. Anyways here is a few pictures from our great trip."
