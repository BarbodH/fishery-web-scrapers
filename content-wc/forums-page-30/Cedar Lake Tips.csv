There's basically just a little slot between shore and the island. The walleye are either there or not, but they can just stack up like crazy there. For muskie ""times square"" is a great location up on the top part of the lake. Just a huge complex with everything you'd ever ask for. For lures I'd recommend eagle tails and anything with green. The east side is really stained, but not ""dirty."" I cleaned house with a 6"" glitter walleye jake one day on pike. It looked great in the stain on the east side."
6683552,prov1800,2022-09-01 19:09:00,5010,Sounds good.next week iam booked solid so wouldn't of worked out anyways.Camp will give you some places to go to.Youll find some fish.Cedar is a good lake.And it's not that busy so those camp spots won't be as busy as usually.
6682554,tmanning,2022-08-28 07:48:00,2,"Taking my Dad to Canada for the first time. We're at Keystone Lodge first week in September. Any tips for walleye and Musky? Probably a transition time? We'll probably fish the East side mostly, but any info would be appreciated. We'll certainly ask for tips at the lodge too.Getting fired up!"
6682570,walleyecheek,2022-08-28 09:17:00,2231,I don't think you'll get any tips ! But if you hire a guide you'll have to tip him.........or her !..........LOL.
6682658,Walleye2242,2022-08-28 15:52:00,263,Prov might have some advice for you...that is in his territory i think?
6683024,Skywagon,2022-08-30 05:21:00,1106,"Hire ProV1800 for a day, a good way to learn the lake and how to catch more fish there."
6683052,nitroman,2022-08-30 07:10:00,368,"The best advice I can give you is talk to the camp owner when you get there. They spend the season talking to guests and are the best resource available to you at that moment. I can give you a dozen spots to try but they don't take into account season, current activity, weather etc. Camp owners want you to catch fish, listen to them."
6683078,Twodogs,2022-08-30 09:14:00,115,What Skywagon said....John is a geat guy and will put you on fish !
6683100,rockape,2022-08-30 11:39:00,215,I've spent 3 weeks of my life on Cedar. Probably the easiest lake to catch a musky that I have fished. They are everywhere! To me it seems there are less big pike and the musky dominate. I've caught muskies all over the lake. PM me. I have some maps.
6683138,Bill Krejca,2022-08-30 14:25:00,6107,"Yup, hot spots change based on so many variables, season, wind, weather. Once you get a pattern figured out, note the conditions at the time, chances are the spot will continue to produce until the conditions change. Expect the conditions to change! Bill"
6683146,prov1800,2022-08-30 15:35:00,5010,Haha.thx
