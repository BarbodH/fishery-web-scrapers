Border crossing thru Sault Ste Marie was good hour around 2pm on Friday. Dealt with rain that delayed us 4 hrs on saturday for flyin. 2 guys that were there were glad to see us at 5pm. Ate supper, unpacked, rigged up poles and ready to go. Went to upwind side of big island to drift down with wind. 10 casts in i have biggest fish of week. 19 and half inch smallie. Just a brute of a fish. Linebackers for Colts don't have shoulders like this fish did. sent him back into water and 10 minutes later hook another that had to be close to him. lose him at boat but got good look at it. catch couple walleye for supper. like someone on another thread said, the first fish fry of trip is best. and i concur with that. got into topwater with prop bait next day. numerous smallies. 17"" being biggest. always a blast when you are catching them that way. if i got any calm water, i could usually coax a strike or 2 any day. Lots of rock fields on the lake that held fish. All walleye were in 18/22 inch range except for one small one. limited pike but i did get slimed by couple. lake was at normal level or down just tad. No rain other than fly-in altho it did cloud up and blow wed evening and got cold. 40's that nite. steam coming off lake next AM. No bugs or skeeters to speak of. No problems with outfitter. George picked us up and Joel flew us in. Cabin was same as when we went 3 yrs ago with some minor upgrades. They have 30 or so cabins/lakes, so lots options there. We like McConnell for the smallies/wallies, its great view of lake, and cabin is on island. Saw eagles flying and 2 of them sitting on shoal just out and to right of cabin. several sets of loons hanging around. 2 half grown ones also. No moose but then location not conductive to us seeing them. drive home was uneventful but long. hit border at 7pm saturday nite. drove right up to booth and gave our 2 passports cards to attendant. he never looked at them. glanced at computer screen, gave cards back, told us to have safe trip, and we are done. I swear, it was less than 15 seconds. How do i get this guy to be my attendant going northbound ?"

6683212,dosxx,2022-08-31 05:38:00,60,"Sounds like a fun trip and brings back some great memories, thanks for posting. My first fly in ever was with AI to Paul Lake many years ago. It was an eye opening experience and led to yearly trips throughout Ontario ever since. Our group fished McConnell many years ago and the smallmouth fishing kind of saved the trip because we struggled a bit with walleye."
6683308,gordy28,2022-08-31 15:37:00,437,Thanks for sharing. Donâ€™t see a ton of reports from Air Ivanhoe but always interested as they have a ton of cabins Andrew
