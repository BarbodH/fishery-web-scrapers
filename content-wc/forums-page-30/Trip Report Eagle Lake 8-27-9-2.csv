6684072,7 Mag,2022-09-04 12:59:00,1887,"Here is my Eagle Lake trip report: Spent Friday night 8/26 at the International Falls Americas Best Inn, not a 5 star motel but after a long drive it sufficed for a restful night of sleep. Saturday morning I had breakfast at the Chocolate Moose, the ham & cheese omelette with a side order of pancakes was excellent, looking forward to my next trip to the Moose. Crossed the border at 9 am, it took less than 5 minutes and no issues. I'm not sure if they are still handing out random Covid boxes, but no one in my camp received one so hopefully that's in the past. No moose encounters on the drive north on Hwy 502 and lots of vehicles headed in both directions. For any first timers taking 502, you better have plenty of gas as there are no facilities or gas stations until you reach Dryden. I stayed at the Cedar Point Lodge, it's a nice clean camp located in Waldhof Bay & Pat did a great job managing the camp. For most of the week the wind was blowing and my Ulterra got a work out trying to hold the spot lock position. Rain was an issue a couple of days and even with good quality rain gear I still got a little wet. The walleye fishing was awesome! I had never fished Eagle so the first couple of days were spent locating fish and learning what tactics worked best. By Tuesday I had figured things out and from then on I had some of the best walleye fishing I've ever experienced. A 1/4 oz jig tipped with a minnow worked best for me. Thursday was HOT for both the weather and the fishing, mid 80's and very little wind. An interesting part about Thursday was there was no walleye chop as it was calm. We've all heard bright sunshine, hot weather, clear water and no wind is not good for walleye fishing. It was the best fishing day of the week, I went through 4 dozen minnows in 3 hours. Northerns were also a hot bite and I lost a Big One at the boat, but I did boat a few. SM bass were a lot of fun and I enjoyed catching them. Muskies were a challenge; I didn't boat any but I had fun chasing them with a few encounters. The return trip was uneventful, a 5 minute wait at the order and a 14 hour drive home. The walleye in the picture was my last fish caught on my last minnow Friday, It was a great trip to a beautiful lake!"
