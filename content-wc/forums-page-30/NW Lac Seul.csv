6684146,dschiebel,2022-09-04 22:55:00,85,"We cured them from doing that throwing musky lures at them or if you know where they're going ttoo be next to your boat put a small float with heave rope and chain, let them run over that . I always try to warn them but you know how that works. They had the nerve to ask us to tow them to the resort when rhet hi our buoy. We said maybe in 7 hours on the way back"

6678110,Eckohlt,2022-08-08 04:59:00,3685,"Very short flight to a smaller lake keikewabik,it was for cpl's trip but my wife is going to Philippines tomorrow,so I'll use the dates with the guys."
6678118,Skywagon,2022-08-08 05:47:00,1106,Used to be a popular lake to fish in the winter.
6681136,fishingMN4eyes,2022-08-21 19:18:00,108,"Returned Friday. Forecast looked dismal so the fact that we were able to fish full days was pretty good. Monday and Tuesday were pretty slow for us and the other group in camp seemed to be experiencing the same. Wednesday and Thursday were much better fishing but the weather was almost too nice. Lots of sun and very little wind. Stopped at a reef we had fished in previous years that tops out around 13' and is surrounded by 25-30' for a long ways. Bottom bouncing with crawlers/spinners and jig/minnow both produced. Also got into a hot jigging rap bite there that was a lot of fun. Ventured down toward Manitou Narrows on Thursday. We had never fished that far south before and stumbled on to a hot spot there to help fill out our limits on our last day of fishing. We found fish anywhere from 9-30'. Not really any magic depth but 20-25' seemed to be the most consistent. Didn't catch the numbers we have in previous years but we did catch a lot of slots and overs. Big walleye for the trip was 25"". The only bad part of the trip was getting buzzed by the Silver Water Wheel guide boats(as posted by walleyeguy3 in the etiquette thread). That is a busy part of the lake but there was no reason to drive that close to another boat where we were fishing. Not the first complaint I've heard about the Silver Water Wheel guides, but this was our first time encountering them. Apparently they must own that part of the lake.... This was our first time staying at Scout Lake Resort. Doug and Marilyn were great hosts and the cabin was very clean. Can't wait for next August!"
6681262,rather-be-fishin,2022-08-22 10:43:00,429,Thanks for the report! We leave for Lac Seul Onaway Resort on 8/26 to 9/2/22. Looking forward to it! RBF
