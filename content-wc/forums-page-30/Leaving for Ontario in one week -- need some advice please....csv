I went last year and used the Arrive Can app on my phone and if I remember right, I had to upload my vaccine record and had to have a covid test just before I went. Has anything changed from last year regarding requirements for crossing. I took my passport and my ArriveCan app information and had no problems coming or going. I could probably go to a travel website and try to figure this out but I know my knowledgeable walleye central family knows the scoop. I appreciate your advice and will be crossing through Sioux St. Marie area north of Michigan."
