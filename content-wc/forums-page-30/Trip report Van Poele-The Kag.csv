The weather was excellent with cool nights, mid teens and sun/cloud days low to mid 20's and about 1/2 hrs of rain one day and 2 days of wind which kept us on Van Poele. The fishing was not as productive as Aba where we were at the last 3 years but the size quality was great as the average was 21""-23.5"", biggest at 25"". The issue we had was 18"" eaters which is not a bad problem. As we had a lot of ground to explore on the Kag for walleye we stuck to hot spots close to the inlet of our lake we found using our finders in 20'-30', drop shot/jigging with minnows/crawlers. Two of us spent two 1/2 days touring around Dorey Island looking for lake trout, lots of suspenders at between 40'-60'. We tried white tube jigs and snap raps with no success. Water temps on Van Poele 67-70 and The Kag 65-67. It was a great trip and will be returning next year as we prefer quality fish but a few number days are required, we don't real keep track of numbers over the week. Thanks to Chad and Dawn and Jamie, Mike and the crew from Leuenburger's for the awesome service and flight."

6680974,Fishquest,2022-08-21 10:24:00,89,"Thanks for the report. I've fished both and you're right finding eater size fish sometimes if a challenge. We perfer the 16 inchers for the fish fry and not sure where they hide but thy have to be there, alot of bigger fish though which makes for fun days. I find on the big lake I like to fish the west side as it seems to have better structure and you can hide out of the wind a little easier."
6681024,stukkie,2022-08-21 13:36:00,21,"Thanks for the tip John, we will try next year for both. Chad's Kag cabin are tough to get and we found that it wasn't that bad {good 35 min} to get to the west side from the inlet to Van Poele with no to little wind and we had a great/fast boat. Won't even try if there is any chance of weather as we are not crazy, lots of fish close to inlet or home."
6681040,Fishquest,2022-08-21 14:29:00,89,You are correct it is hard to book as its a popular place and one of the best locations to be on the lake with access to calm fishing waters in all wind conditions. I have made run from his Kag camp to Van P a few times and lucky with winds I guess but you are right you have to dedicate 30-30 mins each way for the trip and hope for no change in weather for the worse while doing it. I was at Saga Lake this year as there was only two of us on the trip and yet to find time for a report but will do that soon and going right back there this fall for a moose hunt.

6684034,gordy28,2022-09-04 07:39:00,437,I wish Eck. Right now I am limited to a big trip every two years. But yearly coming soon I hope and then who knows maybe 2 or 3 a summer Andrew
6684046,Eckohlt,2022-09-04 08:48:00,3685,"Well one every 2 years is better than none,gives you 2 years to really get pumped,I'm sure down the road you won't be able to last 2 years without going,reading things on WC makes you wanna go more often and to try diff lakes,so summer of 2024 we will expect another great read,thanks"
