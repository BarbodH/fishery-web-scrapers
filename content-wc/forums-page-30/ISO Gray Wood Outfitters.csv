It appears their camps are a little farther north than the typical Nakina based outfitters. From the website the camps look good albeit somewhat more rustic than those offered by Boreal Forest or Twin Lakes. Thoughts and insight would be appreciated. Tight lines everyone.

You can navigate to Mistassin from Blackbirch by boat without issue.It is a well run operation. Flights are with Nakina Air. They made a lot of upgrades to the camp. Which I believe they have done to all of their camps.I have not been with Twin Lakes or BFO, but I don't think the camp was what I would call rustic. It had running water, a flush toilet and a shower with on-demand hot water, baseboard heaters. Full-size fridge and a high quality gas range/oven. I think they were both new as well.Fish hut with running water. Boat motors were new.Gas generator.I think the owners are working on continuing to upgrade all of their camps.Probably some of the best lakes you will fish coming out of Nakina.Let me know if you have any specific questions and I can try to answer them.I have not met Chad, but did run into Jason and Sue at the air-base. Talked to them a bit and they seemed great as well."
