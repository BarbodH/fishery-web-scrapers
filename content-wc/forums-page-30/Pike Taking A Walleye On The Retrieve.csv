6683310,gordy28,2022-08-31 15:39:00,437,We are just back from Miniss Lake (report ready soon) and we had this happen 5 times. Strangely we were able to net both fish 3 times. Pike are just feisty. I would guess that in most cases the walleye was almost 50 percent of the size of the pikeAndrew
6681448,kereid,2022-08-23 06:28:00,10,"In 2015 my nephew and I were fishing NW Lac Suel and we had a double going, when my rod bent over. My nephew had his Go Pro on and captured it all. He added the Jaws music in the background and put it on You Tube, it's very entertaining. You can watch it at https://youtu.be/UAKCXKXMkrs"
6681550,Mojo-NC,2022-08-23 13:18:00,1929,Excellent video of the pike t-boning the small walleye right at the boat. I wish we would have had video of the one I caught this year but photos were the best I could do. I'm a little surprised that there haven't been more similar stories posted.
6682190,papadave,2022-08-26 11:20:00,151,"We found an area that was thick with big 20""+ walleye and every time we caught another walleye it was attacked and/or gashed getting it to the boat. Days later thankfully the pike were gone but nearly every walleye we caught from that area was scarred up pretty bad. We still call the area Murder's Row."
6682208,prov1800,2022-08-26 13:07:00,5010,Happened 3 times times this week up at Latreille Lake.All released.lol.
6682490,valley366,2022-08-27 18:54:00,193,One in our party in 2012 had a pike hit a smallmouth. As you can see hit it head on and actually was hooked too.
6682494,JohnWF,2022-08-27 19:24:00,129,"10 years ago fishing with two friends had the same thing happen, but with a twist. Northern took the smallmouth and drove it into the mud. With steady pressure Pat pulled the fish from the mud and to the surface where Thayer netted both."
6682496,JohnWF,2022-08-27 19:25:00,129,The mud was coming out of the northern's gills.
6682526,pjshorthorn,2022-08-28 06:06:00,5654,"Mojo, Try this story on for size . 15 years ago this past June your fishing partner, the day of your pike encounter, was only 13 years old. We were fishing in one of my favorite spots on Lac Seul. We had found a small sandy point that came off the shoreline and then dropped off sharply into 30 fow. One morning we backed onto that sandy point and anchored up. We started casting out past the drop and then we would bounce our jigs back up the drop to the boat. We ended up finding the motherload of walleye. During the fun of catching all those walleye, we had at least 2-3 very big strikes that immediately took a lot of line out pretty quick. We did not have wire leaders on so we ended up being cut off pretty quick ..except for the last one. The last big strike, Ben had it hooked for about a minute before it finally broke off. I told him at that point it was time to go in for lunch to meet the rest of the guys. He immediately said he wanted to come right back to this spot after lunch. I told him not to say a word to his uncles about our fishing that morning. LOL. We went right back to the same spot after lunch and started fishing the same exact way as in the morning. We started catching walleye again and eventually Ben had hooked a smaller one around 15. As he was bringing it in closer to the boat, I saw a pike peel off a piece of timber in the water. Boom, it was game on I had to pull the anchor as Ben was getting spooled on his UL. I got the boat into deeper water, got the motor tilted up and then realized this was a bigger fish than I thought. I cleared all of our gear off the floor of the boat as the fish made Ben play ring around the Rosie ..circling from the stern to the bow and back around to the stern multiple times. It was quite a battle and Ben listened to all the things I told him as he fought the fish. It probably took 15 minutes before we could even see it. Once I saw it, it was one of those holy chitt moments. Thankfully, we were able to land the fish, which should never have happened, on an UL with 8 lb test line and no leader. Once I got the pike out of the net, I went to unhook it and the only thing I could see was a tail of the walleye sticking out of it's mouth. The pike had swallowed it head first. The only way to deal with it was to cut the line and pull the walleye out through the gill plate of the pike. When I did, both fish were alive. We got some pics and he said afterwards, I want to do that again LOL. Guess where that fish was caught .. PjShorthorn"
6682660,Mojo-NC,2022-08-28 15:57:00,1929,"Lots of cool stories. Keep 'em coming. PJ - That's a great memory for a young guy like Ben. The shoreline in the background looks very similar, but then again all points in Canada look somewhat similar - was the point where Ben caught his 40"" pike by chance the same point where I caught mine last month? We put the smackdown on walleyes on that same point later in the week. Mojo"
6682676,pjshorthorn,2022-08-28 16:51:00,5654,Same place .ironic as all get out. PjShorthorn
6680504,Mojo-NC,2022-08-19 13:44:00,1929,"Almost everyone in my group has had a pike take their walleye on the retrieve at one time or another while fishing in Canada. Most of the pike will let go at or close to the boat, but occasionally one will actually get netted. This year was my first time to have it happen to me. I was reeling in a small walleye when a 31"" pike t-boned it on the way to the boat. I was able to get the fish to the boat and the pike made a run. I got him back to the boat and my fishing partner (PJ's son Ben) netted both fish. The pike never had a hook in his mouth, he just refused to let go. It was a cool experience. (Note: That's PJ giving the thumbs-up in the background.) That's just one story from a great houseboat trip on Lac Seul in July. Let's hear some similar stories."
6680508,prov1800,2022-08-19 14:03:00,5010,"That's cool.has happened many times since I started fishing.Yesterday my guest had a smallmouth on and 40"" muskie slammed it and cut the line."
6680514,speckmaster,2022-08-19 14:10:00,17,"Only happened once in all my times out fishing,,. I had a 26” walleye hit a 10” walleye that I had hooked and was bringing up. Cannibal!"
6680718,Headup81,2022-08-20 08:10:00,1,Happened to me last summer. Pike went after a perch I had on my line.
6680896,skimottaret,2022-08-21 05:15:00,40,"I got one in the boat a few weeks ago , nice 35"" took a 14"" walleye..."
6680928,Eckohlt,2022-08-21 07:32:00,3685,They also like to terrorize fish on the stringer!
6680930,Eckohlt,2022-08-21 07:34:00,3685,I'm not sure which one is beat up more the fish or the boat your in.lol
6681154,kona77,2022-08-21 20:10:00,236,"We usually have at least one encounter each trip with a pike grabbing a walleye. Only once in 25+ trips were we able to get both fish in the boat. This year we actually were able to get two decent gators (34""-36"") in the net that would just not let go of the walleye's they grabbed. On the last day I had a 20-22"" gator on a Dr. Spoon that was hit by a real nice gator (maybe 37""-38""). Big gator just would not let the smaller one go and he was just two big to get both fish in the small camp net. Made two attempts and he let go on the 3rd try. Also had several other encounters with gators going after other walleye's. By far the most encounters we have ever had on a trip. The weird thing is we could not get any of the larger gators to hit casting but did catch some nice gators trolling (mainly Dr. spoons)."
6681208,Bill Krejca,2022-08-22 07:16:00,6107,"I have had several experiences with pike grabbing a smaller fish which was on my line. As previously shared, sometime they will hang on while being netted, or just let go. One of the oddest experiences which I remember many years ago was with a nice stringer of fish hanging over the side. While I was casting, I happened to look down at the stringer of fish in the water. I didn't remember hooking up the really nice pike which was snuggled in with the stringered fish. After looking some more, I realized that the really nice pike must have been lonely, and decide to introduce himself(herself?)by joining the stringered fish for a social swim. The lonely fish followed the slowly moving boat(oars were being used to slowly propel the boat, I said this was a long time ago), continuing to move in concert as if stringered itself, with the captives, for maybe 5 minutes. Eventually it must have tired of the company and it disappeared back deep. I could share another story of the non-hooked pike which knocked me to the boat floor, but that is for another day. Bill"
6681258,DaBirdman,2022-08-22 10:22:00,164,"We've had it happen a few times. This 35"" wouldn't let go and we were fortunate enough to get both the walleye and pike netted."
