6682126,mnjedman,2022-08-26 07:26:00,2,What is the water clarity like on the Indian lake chain? I was up at Cliff Lake about 20 miles north of Vbay and it was crystal clear. I am hoping to find something with a little more tanin to the water.
6682134,prov1800,2022-08-26 07:50:00,5010,Indian Lake chain is fairly clear but not like cliff lake.

6682832,valley366,2022-08-29 10:05:00,193,"Tops on my list would be Five Lakes Lodge. Great fishing for Walleye and good size Northern. Ian runs a great camp and checks in with everyone ensuring they are all enjoying the trip and catching fish. Cabins, boats and grounds all kept clean. Equipment is always functioning as it should. Walleye numbers were excellent that past 2 Aug trips but the June trips have produced the larger fish for us. A ton of solid 15-16"" fish.Second on the list would be Woman River Camp. Same as above with regards to cabins, boats, grounds and management. Paul runs a nice camp and we caught plenty of fish. Bonus is the portage lakes and adds a little adventure.Third on the list would probably be Thaddeus Lake Lodge. Marty runs a nice camp and good fishery. Better chance at bigger Walleye but not an overall numbers kind of place. Also Northern sizes not really there but good numbers of small/medium fish. Also holds Smallmouth if that is your thing. The transit to Ord/Moose gets you to the better numbers of fish but can also be challenging depending on water levels through the channel.Fourth on the list would be Clark's on Cedar Lake. Great cabins, especially if you get the deluxe units. If taking a family with younger kids this is a great spot. Nice boats and accommodations but struggled for fish and early season when we were there was a longer boat ride each day getting to the far end of the lake system."

As to the original post- I'm not sure if he was asking only about housekeeping places. If so, our favorite in terms of fish catching is Basket Lake. Our favorite overall experience is Temple Bay (we've only been there in September)- they offer housekeeping and American."

I have fished basket before.....The North's family still own it? We had to bring own boats or motors....all they supplied was little 16 foot boats with no motors long ago? Maybe a different basket lake? The fishing was good there though.

All housekeeping plan cabins that are located across their own bridge so it feels like its more remote - It's a drive to but Rob and Mike will bring your items across the bridge right to your door.. And priced very fairly in my opinion. It doesn't fish like a fly in lake with Walleyes on every cast no matter where you go, but it's easy to find plenty of great fishing spots that they will put you on. Without travelling far by boat. The Walleyes, Northerns, Perch, and Smallmouth are great. But no Muskies or Lake Trout.. Just another option for you.."

6681564,fishron,2022-08-23 14:13:00,317,"Technically not a drive to because the last leg is a boat in, Lady Evelyn Lake in Northern Ontario served us well for three trips. We drive from Southeast Pa and spend as much time on our drive as we are comfortable with. We meet the boat that takes us to the lodge in the morning. It's quite an adventure if you've never done it before. The advantage of this trip is that you are not pulling a boat and usually six guys and their gear can travel together in a large SUV or Van. With the price of gas this has become an important consideration. The Lodges we use are full service. Meals, Breakfast, packed Lunch and dinner are provided as are great boats (16 footers), with live wells, (I hate to string fish). Gas, bait, and boat cleanup are part of the deal. I wouldn't try to say that the experience rivals a fly in to the wilderness but the lake is big enough to get into that environment. My guys are in their seventies, I'm the oldest, this is the best trip for us going forward. Big walleye are available on this lake and I've caught my share of them. Lots of drive too's out there.

6681516,Bigtaproot,2022-08-23 11:32:00,900,I like the old post lodge. A little pricey but the fishing is very good. takes some time to learn the lake with all of the structure and size of the lake. lots of prop busting structure is the downside

For under $1,000 you'd have to try Camp Lake St. Joseph. It is a big lake, however, and Old Post and Camp Lake St. Joseph are a ways from the areas that are fished the most. Camp Lake St. Joseph is less expensive but more rustic. The Winoga Lodge cabin is excellent and in the middle of great fishing, but it's more than $1,000. It's still a big lake, but at the Winoga cabin you're only fishing 5-10 minutes away."

6681538,Old Timer,2022-08-23 12:19:00,255,"Am I missing something? The OP asked about Â“drive toÂ” camps. I know Winoga and Old Post are not drive-to camps where you park next to the cabin. They're boat-in camps. And I'm not sure Camp St. Joseph is a traditional drive-to camp either. May sound like I'm picky, but there is a difference and depending on one's situation it could be a big deal. Suppose you got a call after dark and had to run home. At a drive-to camp, no problem just jump in your truck and head south. If you boated in it could be a big problem in the dark, in the wind or in the storm. As often said, the devil is in the details."
