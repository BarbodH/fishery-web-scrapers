6682038,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-08-25 11:54:00,240,"Hi--I was part of a group of 4 guys who fished Larus Lake August 14-20. I had fished Larus 17 consecutive years, but always in late May/early June. We stayed in the bay cabin on this trip, in contrast to the beach cabin where I had stayed in all my previous trips. It sure was great to be back on Larus. We flew in early on August 14, and upon unpacking, were greeted by a deluge of rain, which lasted for about 4-5 hours. We ate lunch, unpacked, and got our gear ready for the afternoon/early evening bite. I had a feeling there would still be a lot of fish in the inlet river, due to the rain we got, and because of the late spring/high water. And I was right. In 3-4 hours, my brother Rob and I tallied 90 walleye (brother uses the clicker to keep score), most of which were 17-19 inches in length, much smaller than what we usually catch in the spring. But we were very happy. It was then time to look for and fish some of the reef/shoals marked on the map by our outfitter, and it took a bit of orienteering, but we finally found a dropoff from 16 to 24 feet, and we caught some better sized fish there. The first fish fry of the trip is always the best one, and we did it full justice, frying up several skillets of those delicous golden nuggets, along with a bag of steak fries, beans, and bread/butter. Days 2-6 were largely repeats of the first day. My brother and I made several more trips to the inlet river, caught fish after fish, and then spent time in the further reaches of the lake, using the outfitter's map as a guide, and then trying to zero in on the sweet spots. Although the fishing was good, it wasn't any kind of a fish-after-fish frenzy, or anything like that. It was a little strange bypassing the usual spring hotspots in favor of the deeper water spots, but that is August fishing, as you all know. One interesting aspect of the trip was that my brother and I used minnows for the first four days, and the other two guys used just plastics. I have to say that they did very, very well using the Gulp/Powerbait twisters. In fact, the 4 biggest walleye of the trip came on plastics. We were blessed with cool weather, for the most part, and our minnows survived quite well for four days, in the two bait tamers I brought. There is a moose hunter's private cabin in the center of the lake, and for the first time, I got to see the family using the cabins. So, it was a little strange seeing so many boats on the water. Our two boats, plus 3 or 4 from the beach cabin, plus those from the private island. That is the one drawback to fishing this lake. Great fishing, but expect to have company. Which flies in the face of the reasons so many of us choose to fish outposts, to get that 'only guys on the lake' feel to the trip. In all, I would estimate that our group of 4 caught 700+ fish for the week; I do know that fishing the inlet river accounted for at least 400+ of those. Pike fishing was incidental, we caught them up to 36"" just walleye fishing. Would I go back in August, to this same lake? I am honestly unsure. As mentioned, the fishing is great, but our group prefers to be the only group on the lake, if we are talking fly-in fishing. I do have to say that I enjoyed our June trip to Onepine Lake more. Feel very blessed to have been able to go on 2 fly-ins this summer, plus a boundary waters trip/vacation I took in July. Am already planning for next summer, but as so many of you know, getting a group of even 4 guys is very difficult right now. Good luck to you all who still have trips left this summer!!"
6682042,Eckohlt,2022-08-25 12:13:00,3685,"Nice report guy I like hearing about Laurus,sound like a busy lake,for what you pay to go there as you stated it would be nice to be the only ones there,usually you talking much bigger fish from that lake.thanks again."
6682050,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-08-25 13:24:00,240,"Spring fishing is crazy good, and sometimes the bad weather keeps the other guys off the lake! I have 2 or 3 spots where it is nothing to catch 100 fish/day, with a lot of really nice-sized ones. On this trip, it was like fishing a brand new lake, even though we had been there so many times before. Never have done an August fly-in, and it took a while to find the shoals where the bigger fish were. Very much enjoyed the cool weather we had, and the early sunsets (in contrast to June fishing) were beautiful. But, I don't know if I would go back to that lake in August, and I doubt the outfitter would let us in with a group of only 4 guys again. They are flying 180-200 miles from Nestor Falls, and their business model is predicated on full planes/cabins."
6682064,Old Timer,2022-08-25 14:54:00,255,"Michigan: I've fished Larus quite a bit in June, July, August and September. Once I latched on to a June slot I held those dates for many trips and occasionally loaned the slot to good friends when they could go and I couldn't. Like you, I preferred to fish Larus in June. I haven't been there in quite a few years. For a while I solved the congestion problem by taking both cabins and filling them with friends. But being the wagon master wore me out and nobody else would take the job. After a number of years I moved on to smaller groups and drive-in fishing. BTW, The private island camp is owned by a German family, I believe. They fly over the big pond once or twice a year and come in from a Red Lake floatplane base. Usually, they're not there in June. I also found a boat cache going down towards the outlet. The boat was a camo-painted Lund and tucked back in the bush. On a subsequent trip I ran into the owner out fishing. He had a cabin on LOTW and occasionally flew up for the day in his private floatplane."
6682066,Eckohlt,2022-08-25 15:09:00,3685,"I would think that German family has a mouse trap line that doesn't end,with that cabin sitting idle most of the time others critters have free rent."
6682078,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-08-25 18:49:00,240,"I did get a chance to talk with the 'islanders' one morning--they told me they were from the Adrian, Michigan area. Real nice people, and the kids really seemed to be enjoying themselves. Yes, I am sure that the island cabins are inundated with mice--to say they are rustic would be overstating things. But--they all seemed to be having a real good time. To be 12 or 13 and dropped off on an island in the middle of a good Canadian walleye lake? Wow. There is good fishing right off the dock, where the island is, so that alone is great. Didn't see any moose this year--this lake/region is noted for large numbers of moose, but they were elusive this year.....more than once we woke up to a cow moose and her calves right out on the beach, in years past."
6682160,Old Timer,2022-08-26 09:33:00,255,"Hmm. I had heard from reliable sources that the private island was foreign owned. And yes, the cabins are very primitive, like a step back in time. But the island is located in a great part of the lake. Folks staying there don't have far to go to catch fish. I remember when the outposts were owned by Glenn and Sharon McLeod back in the 70s. The cabins were quite rustic, like all outposts back then. Even without Internet, Larus was quietly known as a lake to visit. Fishermen waited on the list to get favored dates. Yes, the fishing was great."
6683312,gordy28,2022-08-31 15:40:00,437,Was excited to see this report. Larus is in my bucket list. It’s a further hike from Toronto but looks like such a cool spot Glad it was a great tripAndrew
6683448,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-09-01 09:29:00,240,"Hi O.T.--was wondering if you knew a guy named John McClain, who introduced our group to Larus in the late 1990's. He lived in Duluth at the time, before he and his wife retired and moved to Bessemer. It was through him that we were able to land one of the coveted late May/early June slots that we held until 2018. I still see him from time to time. Just interested in seeing if there is any kind of connection there....."
6683622,Old Timer,2022-09-02 10:01:00,255,"Michigan: I don't I believe I know a John McClain. Maybe 45-50 years ago I learned of Larus from a friend of a friend. Back then many fishermen were secretive about where they fished, but this Minneapolis guy agreed to tell me about Larus. I first had summer and fall dates. Back then you had to re-up with your deposit by January 1st. I would call the McLeods around the 5th to see if somebody had not re-upped for a June slot. One year a slot kinda opened because the trip boss had died and the others were unsure about returning. Guessing I might get lucky I sent a check right then. That's how it happened for me. We went to Larus for many years. Our trips would be boring for most as we fished very little during the day. We'd lay around camp until twilight and then boat out to fish deep humps. We wouldn't bring a fish in the boat unless it was 26 inches or more. We caught many 30's or better. After quite a few trips many of our group were older guys and started passing away. Now the rest of bunch are old and can't fish, or go to closer drive-in camps. Everybody has health issues anymore."
6683628,Eckohlt,2022-09-02 11:03:00,3685,"I'm sure all those 30 inchers have died of old age since you've been there!im not sure how long a walleye can live,maybe someone can chime in on that!"
6683660,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-09-02 13:43:00,240,"Wow, that is some great info. and reminisces. I had heard legends about large numbers of 30-inch fish. Biggest fish I ever got at Larus was a 29-inch, almost solid black lunker. One of my trip mates had an afternoon where he and another of our group caught 4 fish over 30"", but they became fewer and farther between as years went by. I had read an old Outdoor Life article (June, 1961) where the adjoining lake to Larus, Sabourin Lake, was first opened to fisherman. Those guys took a lot of big northerns out of Sabourin. It was then that I became determined to see these lakes for myself. We were lucky in that the John McClain I mentioned earlier had gotten old and no longer wanted to go to Larus--we got his Memorial Day week slot, and the rest was history. I lost that slot in 2018 when the other 5 guys decided to quit all at once. I now go to Onepine Lake in June. The fishing is fantastic there, but nothing will ever beat those spring/early summer days in Larus when the fish were on. I now wish I could somehow share a 6-pack with you, and listen to some of those Larus Lake stories from days gone by...... Thanks so much for posting!"
6683708,Old Timer,2022-09-02 16:33:00,255,"Michigan: It's interesting you mention Sabourin. I had been to the falls many times where Larus dumped into Sabourin. We used to fish the current with a big bobber from the flat rocks above. We'd catch fish after fish, but nothing huge. I also had fished the Bloodvein River over in Manitoba. The Sabourin flowage dumps into the Bloodvein near the Ontario/Manitoba border. So on one early trip we portaged the Lunds and motors over to Sabourin and fished up to the Manitoba border. We took our sleeping bags and just squirreled up on a rock. Terrific fishing and breathtaking beauty. The owner of Sabourin, Ron Williams, told me he built his lodge there because it was the prettiest water he had canoed when a young man. Over the years I got to know Ron and we shared our canoe stories and his building Sabourin Lake Lodge and promoting the park. Ron passed away several years ago. As for huge fish, I wouldn't be surprised if there are fewer of them. A lot of gifted fishermen with good electronics are now fishing Larus. We never killed a big fish and never had them out of the water for more than a minute. But as you know, any stress is really hard on big fish when over handled, measured and re-measured and then a dozen pics."
6683746,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-09-02 20:53:00,240,"You are absolutely correct. Plus, 'Lindy Rigging' is tough on those bigger fish. They almost always get hooked in the throat, and some of the more inexperienced fishermen will keep the fish out of the water for way too long, trying to get a 2-cent hook out of the throat of a big walleye, resulting in a bloody mess in the boat and super-high mortality of those big 'eyes. I use a Northland Tackle fireball jig for casting, drifting, and slow trolling, and I don't think I even hooked one fish in the throat this summer. Setting the hook on the first tap-tap usually ensured that the fish would be hooked in the upper lip area. And you are right on with regard to electronics, especially once those fish move into deeper water. But, in late May/early June, electronics were unnecessary, since the fish were so shallow, and in clearly defined areas, especially if the wind was blowing in. We always stayed at the beach cabin, and if there was a stiff NW wind, we could catch fish all afternoon, just fishing off the dock. I, too, would fish Sabourin, by beaching our camp boat, and walking the trail from Larus to Sabourin, fishing the current areas. Was always a nice afternoon trip. So many places on that lake to fish and explore......."
6683422,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-09-01 07:27:00,240,"I know there are openings at Larus for next July or August. Both in the Larus Beach location and in Larus Bay. But you need to have that group of 6 that is ever so elusive these days. I was so happy to be back at Larus. But August fishing is nothing like the late May/early June bite I had been a part of for 17 years. And, as I noted, much more activity on the lake, with the two outposts, and the private island in full use this year. But, if you go there, either to Larus or any other of Dave and Michelle's outposts, you will have good fishing, great service, and an overall excellent experience."
6683432,gordy28,2022-09-01 07:50:00,437,Thanks! Our next big trip won’t be until 2024 but thanks for sharing. Deciding will be interesting I think. We saw more anglers this year on Miniss than we have in the last (which was expected) but I think it had us hankering for solo outpost lakes again. Something about it being your lake I thinkCheers and thanks again for sharing and replying Andrew
