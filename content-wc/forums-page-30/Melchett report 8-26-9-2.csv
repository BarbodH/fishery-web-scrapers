But, no matter what you do, there's no controlling the weather so we did our best to control our fishing tactics and managed out alright. We knew the better opportunities would be in the teeth of the wind blown shore and nearby structure, and when safely possible that's where we were. Always caught enough walleye for fun and table (biggest was 20""), while finding some healthy pike (our target) in spite of the limitations. My oldest brother had a couple 40"" plus pike lost at boat side in some really brutal winds and waves, but the experience for the 72 year old rookie was priceless. Caught high numbers of walleye and pike at ""the wall"" and the ""river outlet"" on the main body of the lake when we could get there. Mostly though it was fishing the bay near camp where we tagged plenty real nice fat pike, though nothing bigger than 36"" made it in the boat. Dark KVD red eye rattle traps proved real productive on the dark cloud days. Not an ideal week but still fun. Plus, we had the northern lights pay a visit early in the stay. Also, easiest border crossing ever. No hassles or random testing."

6684010,bester,2022-09-04 06:31:00,18,"Crazy how weather can change so quickly up there. We were there 2 weeks earlier and had near perfect weather. The fish were plentiful (we target walleye) and caught many over 20"" with the biggest at 27.5"". We made it over to Kap for an afternoon fish and also ventured into Tester lake with the water levels being up. Your right about Jason and Sue, great people that run a top notch operation."
