On Mille Lacs in Minnesota the resorts make more money in the winter than summer. What do you Canadians do in the winter? Is ice fishing as big a thing up North as it is in Minnesota? Do you close up and have a winter job / business or just take the winter off until the sport show circuit starts? No reason for the question, just curious how things work up there."
6683884,prov1800,2022-09-03 13:27:00,5010,Not as big as down south.Few places have ice trips.Clarks has ice shacks at their winter home at KC s landing on Edward Lake and they do trips to Anishinabi Lake Lodge.Very popular trip with hard core fisherman as it's a 40 mile ride through the wilds here.Temple bay takes out some fisherman and bring solid ice huts with them.But nothing like I see even down in Fort Francis on US side of Rainy Lake.Theres villages there on the ice.Never find me there.lol.

We go to the Nestor Falls area and have also been into the Manitou. There aren't any resorts I know that have fish houses, plow roads or provide transportation out on the ice like they do on US LOW, Upper Red, Mille Lacs, etc. The resorts we use are open and provide a place to stay. Other than that we are on our own to provide snowmobiles, portables, etc. Some of the resorts in Nestor Falls provide day guide service and lead sleds out to the lakers and crappies."
