6682722,rpbadger,2022-08-28 20:21:00,22,"Since I just retired, had the opportunity to take two fly in trips with Pickerel Arm Camps this year. Went with my daughter Kellie and two good friends Mike and Doug Blackstone - water well above normal. Fish were generally not in the normal spots I believe due to the water level. Largest Walleyes - 27"", 26"", and 23.5"". Largest Pike 36"". Best producing rigs were minnow with #6 hook and split shot (lots of snags using 1/4"" jigs) and Live Target Perch 4.75"". What a fantastic lure. In general I would say that the fishing was slower than average but we did catch some nice fish. The Jigging Raps did not produce this year. Last year they slayed. Tuk Bay - first time there so I had to find the fish! Found a couple of nice sunken islands and some wind blow shores for the Walleye but got nothing big. Largest fish 22"". Surprising cuz I know there are monsters in there. Had a lot of traffic in the bay from other boats. Biggest pike 36"" by Kellie on a jig. Must have had 40 pike break our 8 lb. Walleye line. Differences between Tuk Bay and Blackstone. Tuk Bay has fat/big pike and they are plentiful. Caught 4X Walleyes at Blackstone. Tuk Bay has enormous Perch! and the Smallmouth are way cool too. Had a blast."
