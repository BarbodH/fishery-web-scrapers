6683684,gordy28,2022-09-02 15:37:00,437,"Thanks Mike Yup we have already started talking about our next trip. We may drive which would probably be Nakina, maybe a full service lodge or who knows where else lol Expect a PM or two w Nakina questions Andrew"

6684274,stukkie,2022-09-05 14:27:00,21,"Sounds like a great trip had and as always awesome in depth report. Three in a boat is no fun, as is being a single. We will be 6 next year instead of an odd number but will miss the ones that can't come."
6683522,gordy28,2022-09-01 15:30:00,437,"It took a while to put this together - one of my longer reports, more pictures but hopefully people enjoy Miniss is probably my favorite lake to date - we did well fishing but it was more about the topography and charm of the lake - big, quirky, dual personality and glorious sunsets Biggest pike was 41.5 and biggest walleye was 26 incheshttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/m...ip-report-2022 Hope you enjoy Andrew"

6683548,IaDave14,2022-09-01 18:50:00,99,Great report my favorite trip in 25 years was 2018 at Miniss East. SFO are the best. I hope to get back some day. Did you fish the wisdom tooth?
6683564,gordy28,2022-09-02 05:27:00,437,Thanks. Glad you enjoyed Quote: Originally Posted by IaDave14Great report my favorite trip in 25 years was 2018 at Miniss East. SFO are the best.

6683582,IaDave14,2022-09-02 07:37:00,99,I don't have a map to attach but if you have one look at the eastern most part of the lake and you will see a bay that has 2 branches that make it look like the roots of a tooth.

So many of my trips have some of the exact same experiences. SFO seems like a great outfitter, I would love to take a trip with them sometime. Thanks again!!"
6683592,gordy28,2022-09-02 08:19:00,437,"Found it - so we didnt fish that bay. But I am pretty sure the north shore right out of the bay is where we saw the first caribou Quote: Originally Posted by michigan walleye guy 2.0Great report, as usual.

SFO seems like a great outfitter, I would love to take a trip with them sometime. Thanks again!!Thanks for the kind words - I enjoy writing up the reports, it takes a while but I find it extends the ""high"" of the trip just a little longer SFO and Ryan were great to work with - out of all of the outfitters we have used he is bar far the most responsive - mainly because he is a texter lol Andrew"
6683600,Eckohlt,2022-09-02 08:36:00,3685,Did you text him your in need of mouse traps??there eating your groceries lol.
6683606,gordy28,2022-09-02 08:46:00,437,We didn’t. Once we understood the situation we improvised lol
6683608,Eckohlt,2022-09-02 08:53:00,3685,Be nice if every outpost had a resident kitty cat there.lol
