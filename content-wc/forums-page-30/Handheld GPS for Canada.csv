6683354,Net_Man,2022-08-31 19:17:00,580,You are spot on in your opinion!
6683638,dhilgers,2022-09-02 12:20:00,3,I also recommend the Navionics Boating app from the App Store using an iPhone. I would imagine you could also use a Samsung and the same app. Another recomendation is to have a cigarette lighter adaptor to use to charge your phone while on the water. Of course also bring a phone charger to the cabin. Good Luck - Denny Hilgers
6683650,Net_Man,2022-09-02 13:18:00,580,Navionics boating app - I have Navionics on my phone but I have never used it for open water fishing. Evidently I must be missing some thing based on the recommendations here. Other than being a low cost add on to a existing phone why would I want to use Navioincs in a boat compared to depth finder with built in GPS?
6683764,gordy28,2022-09-03 06:41:00,437,"I have a cheap Garmin handheld and my brother has a better one. His was fine on Miniss but honestly as others have mentioned we used the Navionics app the most. Pre trip, download the lake/area from the app and you are good to go regardless of cell service. Added benefit is contours of the lake (not all lakes on it but Miniss was)Cheers Andrew"
6683950,h8go4s,2022-09-03 19:59:00,1673,The O.P. asked about a handheld GPS to use in a camp boat. Maybe didn't have a portable or easily convertible sonar/GPS to bring with him.
6684014,Net_Man,2022-09-04 06:46:00,580,And my response would be is don't waste your time with a handheld GPS for the OP's application.
6682956,Lunkers4me,2022-08-29 18:51:00,2,I am looking for recommendations for a good handheld GPS to use in Canada. I have been away from using GPS for a while and trying some new places with camp boats. I know technology and mapping have changed a lot in just the past few years. Thanks in advance for sharing any recommendations.
6683030,Mojo-NC,2022-08-30 05:37:00,1929,"I bought a Garmin handheld GPS (GPSMAP 62) several years ago and found it to be pretty worthless for my intended use. It might be good for wilderness hiking, but definitely not for navigating on a lake. I found the fishfinder with a built-in GPS to be much more useful for my purposes while I'm in Canada. When I'm driving I just use the GPS in my phone. Others may disagree; that's just my 2 cents worth. Mine sits on top of my safe untouched for at least a couple of years."
6683036,h8go4s,2022-08-30 05:58:00,1673,"Several years ago, I got the Navionics boating app for my phone and my Samsung reader. It worked in both for a trip to Lac Seul. After you get it installed, you don't need internet service or phone service to use it; it locates by GPS. The Navionics website has gotten more complicated; you might have to do some digging to figure out how to get it."
6683048,BuckeyeATC,2022-08-30 06:54:00,88,"No need to buy a handheld GPS unit if you have a smart phone. They work as a GPS even if you don't have cell service. Download an app like ""Canada Topo Maps"" and you're good to go. I've used my smartphone and OnX Maps out west hunting elk for a handful of years. Never had a problem. Much cheaper to download a free app than it is to buy a handheld GPS. Just my 2 cents"
6683050,NETim1187,2022-08-30 06:58:00,166,"My old Lowrance H2OC is/was pretty good for this purpose. It can use the old SD sized Navionics card. It's a battery burner though. 3 AA's last maybe 6 hours of use. I used it mainly to make trails while hot rodding around LOTW in other people's boats. Plus, it was a good backup in case the boat's GPS system would happen to go down. I love being able to transfer data between the H2OC and the big graphs. Pretty handy. Of course, it's no longer made but can be found on ebay etc."
6683062,Lunkers4me,2022-08-30 08:17:00,2,Thanks - Looking to use this mostly in the Lake of Woods and Rainy Lake regions. Would also like something that has Canada contour maps included - or available to download. Any recommendations for those options?
6683066,h8go4s,2022-08-30 08:23:00,1673,"Again, Navionics."
6683080,DeBo,2022-08-30 09:17:00,211,The Navionics iPhone app is pretty solid for The Rainy and LOTW area. If you go to the navionics web app viewer website using your phone or PC you can get a solid idea of the available data. In my experience the paid app has better(more detailed) data. No cell data needed once you are up there. Uses your phones GPS.
6683082,valley366,2022-08-30 09:32:00,193,"Depends on what you are looking to get out of it all the above options may be an option that fits your needs.Navionics is a great option. I use this on my tablet when in the boat. Especially good when you save a track and want to navigate back to it. I will note that unless you are going to a lake that has been mapped do not expect contours and depths to be accurate. I fished Gull Rock and Woman River this summer and neither of those lakes are accurate with depths and shallow spots. It is great for navigation and figuring out where you are at. Downfall is have to use phone or tablet. I have a weather proof cover on my tablet and don't think I would have my phone out on a wet stormy day going across the lake.Portable fish finder with GPS is another great option if you are looking at laying down tracks and marking fishing spots. I especially like this when fishing areas that are new. Drive over the hump or area, mark fish, lay down a waypoint quick and you can get back on top of them. I have found that for new areas the map is not as easy as navigation aid then Navionics. It takes some getting used to and depending on the base maps may not be very accurate. IE the Lowrance base maps are not that good. The lakemaster base maps on lakes that have not been mapped are not very good. Weatherproof is key here, built to be out in the elements. Originally I was strictly a hand held guy. I have the Garmin GPS 62 or 64. Forget exact model. I found it it is great for laying down tracks that we travel and reference on how to get home again. I also kept it hanging on my life jacket and hit the mark button whenever caught fish. Then use it to get back to the spot on the spot type thing. This method has got me a ton of fish in the past. Like stated above you can also upload topo maps that will be a lot better navigation aid then the built in maps. I have found those to be pretty accurate. Weather proof unit and no problem having this out in wet conditions.I am at the point now that trying to figure out if want to replace my hand held or not. Mine the battery terminals got corroded and had to do some repairs last week. Also the memory chip holder has some corrosion. I am going to look at the parts site as last time I broke the battery compartment door the parts site was easy to navigate. Going to see if can get new battery terminals. I have had my unit for I think 13 years and has never let me down. Went and looked at prices and not sure if worth the $350 investment at this point as I always have my tablet with me along with my Helix 7 that I now use more than anything.Hope this is helpful. The hand held will do what you are looking for but there are other options out there that may do it better."

Even if your water are not chart you can use the sonarchart live to create your own map. You download the portion of the ground that you need and you good to go. You can create: routes, tracks waypoints. Everything you need"
