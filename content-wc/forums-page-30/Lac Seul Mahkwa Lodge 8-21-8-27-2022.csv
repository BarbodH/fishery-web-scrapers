6684058,Skiball,2022-09-04 10:40:00,82,Sounds like a great trip and great fishing. Did they have you go far from Mahkwa to hit their spots? lot of water and some of the best walleye fishing. Now you can look forward to next year..... Skiball
6684060,Skiball,2022-09-04 10:52:00,82,"Pine Point has always been a good producer, so has the whole area up Northeast. A lot of spots to fish up there. Its a haul but definitely worth it. Good spots within 3-5 miles of camp ,as well. Walleye heaven Skiball"
6684172,Lac Seul John,2022-09-05 07:04:00,31,We fished Sunday half day and 5 full days Mon - Fri. 2 of those days were at and past Pine Point. The remainder was within 3 to 5 miles of the camp.
6683228,Lac Seul John,2022-08-31 07:30:00,31,"We just returned from my third trip to Mahkwa and all I can say is Wow! The weather, fishing, and lodging were all fantastic! Weather - outside 65 to 75 degrees every day. Water temp 71 degrees. Mix of no wind and light wind for pretty much the whole week. Two or three stretches of moderately heavy wind but these only lasted for 2 to 5 hours each. Mostly sunny skies. Some overcast Our rain gear never left the storage bin on the boat! Fishing - Leave the lodge around 8 am. Shore lunch around noon to 2. Dinner at the lodge 6 to 7 pm. Back out fish 7:15 to 8:30. The fishing was the best I have ever experienced. Daily catches for my son and I - 66 (1/2 day arrival day) / 171 / 101 / 183 / 146 / 246. Sunday through Thursday we would spend some time on known spots and then search for others. Jig bite was on fire, but we would also cast to break up the day. Pulled harnesses on bottom bouncers one day when the lake laid down to super flat. Jigging and harnesses was constant action. Casting was alot slower. Size of fish ran a pretty wide range. We got into schools of smalls - but mainly got 15 to 19 inch walleyes. Good amount of 20 to 23's. Had a bunch over 23 with the largest eye being 26.75. Big pike around 32. And 6 or 7 nice bass. Last day we decided to go for high numbers. We stopped exploring and jigged only on known hotspots from earlier in the week and only casted for a hour and a half. We boated 246 walleye, northern, and smallies. Absolutely insane action. The furthest we got from the docks that day was 3.5 miles. Best program was 3/16 jigs with crawler halves or leeches fished on reefs, sand flats, or breaklines anywhere from 19 to 25 fow. (best was reefs and breaklines). We got them shallower and deeper but this zone was definitely the best. Color did not seem to matter but I fished mainly with a white / pink jig head and my son fished with an orange metallic jig head. We drove to and past Pine Point Monday and Tuesday and spent the rest of the trip closer to the lodge. Great action in both areas, but best fishing both size and numbers was within 3 to 5 miles of the docks at Mahkwa. We did not use one minnow the entire trip. Leeches were better than crawlers. We blew through a pound of leeches in about one day of fishing and put a pretty good dent in the flat of crawlers during the remainder of our stay. Lodging was great. We stayed American Plan and had a motel style room with a small fridge and air conditioning. Food was ok. Staff was friendly and helpful. One of the dock guys got into my boat and marked some spots for me. So all was great. My handle here is Lac Seul John. That's kind of a misleading name. I really am still learning this lake. This was my 3rd trip to Mahkwa. The first was not a real serious fishing trip - more of a party with my brother in law and his buddies. Last 2 we hit it pretty hard. Point being the fishing is pretty darn good considering I am kind of a rookie at this lake! Hope this helps. John"
6683230,Larry S,2022-08-31 07:39:00,665,"John, Glad you had a great Trip. My question to you is Where did you get Leeches at this time of year. All the Bait shops I called in August Did Not have Any?? Larry S"
6683240,Lac Seul John,2022-08-31 08:25:00,31,QSL in Dryden. I reserved in early June. They said they would have leeches in August but only for those who reserved early.https://www.qsltackle.ca/
6683300,Larry S,2022-08-31 15:14:00,665,OK Thanks John. Next year I will reserve if they still can get them for our Trip in August. Tried a Lot of bait shops and strike out Larry S
6683370,Yellowfin123,2022-08-31 20:22:00,2182,"trip sounded like a winner.. which way is pine point?? you said 3-5 miles, little north then head west around the islands? it really seems like thats the forgotten section of lac seul , just no boats hardly"
6683410,Lac Seul John,2022-09-01 06:46:00,31,Pine Point is about a 12 mile boat ride from the docks at Mahkwa - north / northeast. We did that run and a little farther for 2 days. Remainder was spent around camp. Not alot of boats anywhere we went. Camp manager said this week is typically one of their slowest times of the year.
6683464,gordy28,2022-09-01 10:40:00,437,Thanks for sharing such a detailed report. We would have been on Miniss the same time you were on Lac Seul. Andrew
6683466,troutwater,2022-09-01 10:50:00,299,Sounds like a great trip! By any chance did you see or hear of any muskie up that way? I've heard rumblings they've migrated a little bit that way
6683572,Lac Seul John,2022-09-02 05:56:00,31,"Sorry, I don't know. From what little I can figure out, muskies are past Chamberlain Narrows and maybe south towards Deception? Either way - it's so far away that I never really seriously considered it."
6683668,Fishquest,2022-09-02 14:03:00,89,"Thanks for the report, those are some solid fish catching days."
