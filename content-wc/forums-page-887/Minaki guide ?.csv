528943,Guest,2003-04-06 15:17:00,0,Does anybody know who the head guide is @ the Minaki Lodge ?
528944,River_eye,2003-04-06 16:38:00,1486,"His name is Mike Britton, I met him last year at the lodge that he worked at. Were you thinking of taking a trip there this summer?"
528945,Guest,2003-04-06 17:32:00,0,Yes I am going up in June. Did he work for a Minaki camp or was he on a different body of water ?
528946,River_eye,2003-04-06 20:52:00,1486,"I know he's a very experienced guide, and could have guided near Minaki at some point for all I know, but last year when I met him, we were both working on the winnipeg river (same as minaki), just down stream in Manitoba. I really don't know his history, but I do know he's a no-nonsense guy committed to his work."
528942,Guest,2003-04-07 10:50:00,0,"Hi Brian: Won't know the pattern until I get there.A lot depends on the amount of water and the temperature. Have had a lot of luck around the entrance, Dam Bay pitching jigs, up stream towards Kenora by the Dallas, etc. Look me up when you get there on channel 68, cabin 6, or ask when you get in for Don."

528931,Guest,2003-03-25 13:44:00,0,Am looking for a guide in Minaki. Any ideas / recommendations ?
528932,Guest,2003-03-25 14:10:00,0,I hear that RTMG that frequents this board is a very good guy. Some folks on here have used him and had very good things to say. He also has a place up on Big Sand so he knows the system well. Unfortunately I don't know how to reach him but maybe he will see your post and reply.
528933,brian1785,2003-03-25 14:22:00,1534,"I went out with Rob (rmtg) last year and would highly recommend him. Had some motor problems but he worked very hard for us and marked our maps with a bunch of information. He also came back to our camp the next day with some updated information he got from some buddies of his. He didn't need to do that. His name is Rob Carlson. If you do a search for North Star Village and email the people there, they will point you in the right direction."
