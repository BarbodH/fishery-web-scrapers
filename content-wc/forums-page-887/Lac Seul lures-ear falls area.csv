529278,Guest,2003-04-01 20:45:00,0,Hey I know that bottom bouncer n jigs sound good. I was hoping you guys would let me know your hott colors n best weight of sinkers n jigs. I would also like to know what kind of crank baits to buy.? n how deep of running ones? Heading up at end of june if that helps Tight Lines Paul
529279,Bruce,2003-04-04 20:14:00,48,"Chartreuse/Orange/Pink are the best colors in that order.Use a 1/4 to 3/8 oz slip sinker with about 2 ft tail anda floating jig tipped with leach, crawler or minnow.Most of the time 1/4 oz to 3/8 oz lead heads work fine unlessyou're in deep water or current. Take along all 3 kinds of live bait you never know what is best each day.As far as cranks gold or silver is fine.use cranks as a last resort if you are having trouble finding eyes."
529280,Scott,2003-04-09 08:53:00,385,"Made our first trip to the Ear Falls area last year. Anything chartreuse, pink and glow white worked pretty well for us. Far and away the best thing were red/black Canadian Walleye jig heads from Cabellas tipped with minnows. We were fishing in shallow water so the 1/32 and 1/16 sizes is what we were using. We also had good luck with lime green 1 1/2"" mister twisters on either white or yellow jig heads. For crank baits, had pretty good luck with perch colored, jointed Rapalas with shallow dive."
529281,Guest,2003-04-09 09:40:00,0,I think you have to include gold. I'v e always had better luck then boat partners on lac seul and Perrault lake with gold. Go as small as you can too with jigs.
529282,Guest,2003-04-09 13:00:00,0,"At the end of June, the walleyes will be fairly aggressive and be located on mid lake structures. They usually will chase in-line spinners with large colorado blades. My favorite colors depend on the weather conditions. A bright sunny day will bring out the gold or silver and hammered gold and silver. Last year was a good year for copper. On a cloudy day, I would use a chartruese or orange or a combination. One of the resorts up there sells a rig called a Lac Seul rig. It works pretty good with any type of live bait. If jigs are your mood, oranges, gold, chartruese in the 1/8-3/8 size, depending on the wind work well. As far as plugs, just about anything will catch fish but if you want to throw that much money to the fishing gods, I can give you my address and just send me the money instead. With the jigs and spinners any combination of white and something else will get a toothy critter."
529283,Guest,2003-04-09 13:04:00,0,I'll be up there the third week of July. Same patterns as mentioned early or will they be different. I've heard this is a great time to catch big fish up there. What does everyone think? Thanks!
529284,Guest,2003-04-10 13:01:00,0,I think just about any time is a good time to catch a big one. The patterns are about the same with fish on mid-lake structure with deep water close.
529285,Guest,2003-04-11 08:49:00,0,"First few weeks of July have always been good to me and the conditions have varied over the years which will effect what is hot and what is not. Last year for me it was anything perch colored. I stayed with it for 6 days, varying every now and then, playing with different colors but nothing produced the strikes that these did. Ice out was a bit later last year then previous, May fly hatch was just starting when we were there 2 nd week of July. When the May fly hatch is in full swing, the larvae can be a big percentage of what a walleye eat. Last year the weed beds were just starting to be visable, we worked those and found lots of big walleyes laying waiting fore a little perch to happen by. I did a lot of switching back and forth with black 1/8 oz jig head with 3"" twister tipped with leach or salted minnow, or spinner with the perch colored colorado or indiana spinners. Fishing for all 6 days was phenomenal, never seen the walleye that aggressive for that long of a period of time. I think at times a bare hook on a cane pole would have caught fish. There is lots of good information on this board. A lot of it depends on how a person likes to fish. Me, I love drifting, bouncing a jig or spinner rig across points or at the edge of weedlines. That's what I love about Lac Seul, something for everyone. Enjoy your experience!"
529286,Walleye hunter,2003-04-15 12:30:00,13,Eh i would recomend yellow road runner jigs 1/4 ounce or 3/8 ounce eh. The pike seem to bite theses a lot too eh. I would recomend throw up anything silver color towards the short for pike.
