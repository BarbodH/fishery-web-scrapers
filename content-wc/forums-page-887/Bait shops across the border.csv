529827,Guest,2003-04-14 14:28:00,0,I need to pick up some dead bait for pike fishing on our way up to Red Lake. We stay over night in Dryden so we tend to drive hwy 502 then hwy 105 to Red Lake. I know I could probably get bait in ear falls but we will be driving through so early Saturday morning that I don't know if they'll be open. Do any of the bait shops in Fort Frances carry dead bait? What do they have? Cost? Are they just frozen or are the preserved in some manner? And finally do you have to order them ahead of time? Any info is much appreciated.Thanks guysAdam
529828,IaDave,2003-04-14 17:31:00,476,"Adam- I would like to learn more about dead bait fishing for Pike. We are going to be in Sioux Lookout opening week of walleye season and always like to try something different. Here in Iowa after ice out they fish catfish with the dead shad. Is it the same technique? Throw out a glob of shad guts and wait for the fun? I understand the big females don't move much they just suck up the stuff on the bottom. What type of bait,tackle,where on lake,fish the bottom or with a big float, and when? Any advise or a website would be great. Sorry I can't help on the bait shop."

I don't know the name of the store it also has gas but it is hard to miss and it is near a resturant and faces rainey lake. hope this helps, by the way had breakfast at the resturant last year and it was pretty good. Eric"

Have gotten bait there many times, always good quality, and as was mentioned the food at the Harbourage ain't bad either. Good luck."
529829,Guest,2003-04-15 06:20:00,0,"IaDave,We'll be flying out of Red Lake opening weekend. In the past I've always salted large sucker minnows and taken them with me. Last year a group that was up the same time we were had frozen ciscos that they bought on the way up. This year I thought I'd give that a try. The lodge we stay at has very good pike fishing. In the first few weeks after ice out dead bait catches the most and largest pike every year. We fish them one of two ways. We use a quick strike rig. If you don't know what that is I'm sure you can find it on the internet. One way we fish it is below a large slip bobber about a foot off the bottom. The other way is on the bottom. No bobber. Our most successful locations are river mouths. It can be a lot of fun.I'm sure there are others here who could offer more tips. Good luck.Adam"
529833,Thumper,2003-04-15 07:40:00,133,"If you have bait stores in your area that carry the kind of live minnows you're interested in, you can always preserve them for your trip up. If you talk to the bait store owners, they'll probably give you the minnows at a very low price.Here's instructions on how to preserve the minnows.http://www.torgerud.com/fishing/SaltedMinnows.asp"
