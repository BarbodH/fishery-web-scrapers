Help me a little by narrowing down a few things: - the general area you are planning to go, if you know; - are you interested in driving or fly-in; - if you had to choose between big and many, which would it be; - what type of accomodations are you expecting; - do you care whether any other species are available to catch;Take care,derrek.""It's the weaseling out of things that sets us apart from the animals....
