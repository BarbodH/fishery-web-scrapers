529628,Guest,2003-04-08 12:38:00,0,"What is the deal with border crossing from US to Canada? I am hearing that if you've had a previous DUI that you are subject to possibly being denied access to Canada. Can someone explain how this came about and how it effects the individuals in your vehicle. Are they simply targeting the driver or is every person subject to this new inquiry? Is this a random check? I understand that this was revised and enforced 6/28/02. Can anybody that has taken a trip after 6/28/03 describe any new procedures that support this inquiry? I have been going to Canada for over 15 years and this is the 1st time I have heard of such a thing. So, If i had a DUI 6 years ago, canada won't let me in? What a crock! Is this random or is it asked of every vehicle? If I have had a DUI, do they turn you away?"
529629,Guest,2003-04-08 14:03:00,0,"If the Border Patrol decides to check your drivers license they will usually check everyone in the car. I've been to Canada several times in the last year and they have checked my vehicle about 50% of the time. We had one guy with us last December that got bounced for a DUI 5 years ago. They gave him a choice to come back the next day to apply for a temporary permit. We only live 100 miles from Fort Francis so it wasn't that big of a deal. We had two vehicles so we off-loaded some gear and he went home. The law had some changes last year, but I'm not sure what they are. Go to the Canadian Govt. Immigration website and you will find the information you need. TGG"
529632,Kilroy,2003-04-08 14:10:00,59,"6/28/03, hmmm have not been there after that date yet. I had some friends that were turned around at the Ontario border last Spring because the fellas son had a previous DWI on his record. They were a little put out as they didnt get their deposit back. I have also heard since that you can pay a fee to get around the DWI thing, but cannot confirm this. Best thing to do is call one of the crossings and ask. Just do a search on google, you will find addreses and phone numbers depending on where you plan to cross. If you find out any information please post it back to this board. Good Luck!Kilroy"
529630,Guest,2003-04-08 14:12:00,0,"It is true, you need to get a permit and pay something like $50 bucks to legally be allowed in.Same thing goes for people wanting in the U.S. with a Canadian DUI."
529631,Guest,2003-04-08 16:23:00,0,"Dumb question maybe? How do they handle people flying into their country? I can't imagine them not allowing tourists into their country that have DUI's from 8 years ago. It sounds to me they have targeted and to some degree stereotyped us fisherman as prime DUI suspects at the borders and find another way to make and take our money. Also, somebody posted that you may obtain a permit for $50.Does anybody have further info on that?"
529633,fishmaster,2003-04-08 17:47:00,209,Check the archives there is much talked about this topic in the past months and will be of help for you. Lot of good info on this topic if you check the archives. Good luck.Have been going to Canada for 27 years now and have never been pulled but guy's in our group have. Look them in the eyes take off your sunglasses and have your lights on and seat belt on and answer the question with an honest face and you will drive through probably with no problems.
529634,Stillwater,2003-04-09 02:14:00,87,"First off you didn't say what part of Canada.I went thru this last year and I can tell you exactly what the situation is crossing into ONTARIO. And keep in mind that this is an Immigration issue, not a Customs issue. (Clarification about this near the end of this message)If your DWI is 0-5 years old you will need to fill out a short application and pay $200 (canadian) and you will be given a permit good for 30 days. (This has to be done each year). If your DWI is 5 to 10 yrs. old, you have to do the same thing but it is good for the whole 5 years.If it is older than 10 years. You are automatically considered ""rehabilitated"" and you pass right through. Mine is older than 10 years and I had to go through an Immigration check and was passed right through. The thing that causes the hassles/turnbacks are trying to go through Customs where they do not have Immigration Officers. Immigration officers mostly work 8 to 5 or thereabouts, and not all Customs stations have them. In International Falls/Fort Francis, (the biggest crossing in Minnesota by far) they had 8 Customs Officers on duty last year (all 4 lanes open) in late July but only 1 Immigration Officer. There was over 20 people waiting in a room with 10 chairs. We had to wait 1 hr. 45 mins. for her to check our drivers licenses. (She went to Lunch and no one could go anywhere, No going to the can or stepping outside for a smoke unless you got permission from the desk, and don't even THINK about getting near your car). We had already passed Customs and a vehicle check but they wanted to do a random ""Immigration ID"" check and we were unlucky. It took 5 minutes once she called our number but it took a long time to get to our number.Scott(I copied and pasted this from a discussion on the General Discussion board last month, topic #26299, there is also MUCH more in the archives)"
529635,nemio,2003-04-10 19:19:00,96,"Customs in Canada are a lot easier then in the States. For a Canadian crossing the border in the US if they been arrest 12 years ago for smoking a 'joint' or any minor infractions is not allowed over the border; even after 20 years, even if we got a ""pardon"" that mean that after a few years without any problem with the justice you can have your record clean but even with that you are not allowed to cross."
529636,IaCraig,2003-04-10 20:33:00,434,"Nemio, Do you know any links where I can read the details about these ""minor infraction's"" which US imigration considers to be grounds to permamently ban visitors from Canada?Thanks In AdvanceIaCraig"
