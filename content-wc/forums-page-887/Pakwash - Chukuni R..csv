529674,Brad,2003-04-09 20:20:00,95,Will be staying at South end of Pakwash Lake the third week of July. Primarily targeting walleye with bass 2nd. Will be staying at Pakuni Lodge. Has anyone used this lodge before? What would be the best cranks and jigs to use and how is the river for fishing. Thanks.

529676,Bruce,2003-04-10 21:32:00,48,"Haven't fished that end of the lake at all or the river down there.Have heard that it is better smallmouth on that end of the lake.At the resort we used to stay at the owners went into the fish cleaning house and a guy that hadn't fished much staying therewas fileting a 28 inch Smallmouth. Didn't even know for sure what kindof fish it was. I'm guessing better than 10 pounds!!Wish I could give you more info on fishing in July but we have alwaysbeen there late May or early June.All I could recomend is around Walleye Island or in front of the provincal park for Walleyes. Walleye island has to good that time of year but it is rocky, tough to jig or drag. By the park is good when the wind blows from the south into the bay just fish the 6 to 8 ftbreak and drag leeches with a floating jig.This lake has been good someone usually lands a #10 eye each yearfrom our group.The fish will be set up in their summer patterns so fish points anddrops the eyes will probably be in the 15 to 20 ft.Good Luck!!"
