529399,Thumper,2003-04-05 17:23:00,133,"River_eye,When we're casting overhung shoreline for Pike (and Bass in the US), someone we'll get hungup in a branch about 1 out of 20 casts. That's why we use SpiderWire ;-) Just give it a tug or 3, and out it comes. Hardly every have to bring the boat up to the branch.Give me his name and e-mail address and I'll pass the tip along (kidding)."

529405,Guest,2003-04-06 08:52:00,0,"I applaud you taking your son to Canada! I have taken both of my sons a couple times and the experience.....well I'll never forget it!!!Careful about taking your wife though, she might like it and want to go back !!!!!!!!"
529409,alan ex pup,2003-04-06 10:12:00,126,I always was told the further you fish from the fishing pressure of the states the better the results. when we are driving back from canada through minnesotta on a saturday morning where are those people with boats behind them going- they are going north and almost everyone has a boat in tow. just wondering.
529406,Reels,2003-04-07 18:19:00,2876,"Wife has been up to Minaki several times, and she'll come back up in August. My daughter? Not till they build a mall... well at least another year or two. :-)<{{}}><"
529410,Guest,2003-04-08 11:38:00,0,"SHADOWWALKER, Thank you for your opinion no matter how misguided you are. I love Minnesota and have some great memorys of fishing there...But Minnesota better than Canada?..... lets find out what the boys on Walleye Central think...see my new post...Canada or Minnesota...Please Vote"
529407,Guest,2003-04-08 12:58:00,0,"I brought my son to Canada the first time when he was seven and now he is 22. We haven't missed a summer. It is a time we will always cherish. The birth certificate and note are a good idea. One other thing that has saved us time is to have mom around home about the time you plan on crossing the border, so if they do decide to call, she is there to answer any questions. Keep traditions going by getting them started."
529411,Guest,2003-04-12 21:08:00,0,"Shadowwalker,I fished and trapped in Minnesota most of my 55 years, but you can't compare Minnesota Fishing with Ontario. My son got so bored with Canada last year because he said that fishing for Walleye was so easy it was like sunfishing. So we decided on Rainy Lake this year. But I can guarantee you we will be back on Lac Suel in 2004. I fish about 100 days a year and there has never been any better fishing then Lac Suel.Try Canada, you will like it."
529395,River_eye,2003-04-03 23:30:00,1486,"If you are getting a guide, request one that knows how to have fun as well as catch fish. I consider myself a specialist when it comes to kids and families. Important things are good places to get out of the boat and stretch the legs, swim, rocks to climb etc. Hopefully you are going when it's warm enough to swim.Make sure you are patient as well, for snags and things. I had a prominent sports caster and former NFLer this summer and he was always yelling at his 12 y/o son for casting into the trees. We didn't usually get out fishing until 11 because the dad was hung over from drinking with the rest of the group the night before. What a jacka**."
529400,Reels,2003-04-04 07:06:00,2876,"Thanks for the advice guys. Never thought about a letter from Mom.I have taken him on weekend trips, and the kid will fish till midnight if I let him! But good advice on the distractions. I wondered how 7 days would go. He dosent go far without the gameboy! But I will have to find some things for him to do besides.<{{}}><"
529401,Guest,2003-04-04 07:13:00,0,Been taking kids to Canada for years. Birth Certificate and a letter from Mom with a NOTARY SEAL will save you any lost time. Hope you and your Son build some memorys and have a Great time
529396,fishinnut,2003-04-04 08:02:00,642,"I have been fishing with my son since he was about 3 yrs. old, dad hooks them and Jr. would reel them in. He's been to Canada at least 7 times and I've never been asked for ID, but I always had it ready. Jr. is now 17 and 6'-03"" and usually outfishes me and my buddies. You should have a great time."
529402,Guest,2003-04-04 08:19:00,0,"WHY NOT TAKE HIM TO MINNESOTA BETTER FISHING,NO HASSLES, GREAT PEOPLE, CLOSER TO HOME. SHADOWALKER"
529397,duffy,2003-04-04 08:22:00,49,Okay river_eye you have my curiosity. Who was it? Do tell please???? Take good careDuffy
529403,Guest,2003-04-04 09:59:00,0,Better fishing in Minnesota????? You are kidding..I hope. There are some great spots in Minnesota but day in day out Canada has more great Walleye Lakes and more fisherman pleased with their day of fishing than Minnesota ever has. I have fished both Canada and Minnesota since 1955 and Canada is #1.
529398,River_eye,2003-04-04 10:10:00,1486,"Although the guy pissed me off, I'm scared to say his name because he's 6'5 and about 275. :-) He could break me in two."
529404,alan ex pup,2003-04-05 00:56:00,126,"if your wife comes with you wont need a letter and it turns out even nicer, after a morning of fishing there is nothing better than a little afternoon delight. We always went up as a family and no one ever said anything at the border. A lot of wives up there even fishing. How about the daughter? Ours alway went and enjoyed cleaning the fish now she is a doctor. Familys are less suspect than guys alone too."
529408,Guest,2003-04-05 14:59:00,0,"MAYBE YOU NEED TO LEARN TO FISH,I HAVE ALSO FISHED BOTH AND YOUR RIGHT THERE IS NO COMPARISION MINNESOTA IS NO.1 SHADOWALKER"
529384,Reels,2003-04-03 18:04:00,2876,What do I need to bring my boy over? Anything? Birth Certificate? He is 11 and all pumped up! He is casting for sticks in the back yard! I told him he had to sit on top of the garage and practice jigging... but the wife gave me a dirty look. <{{}}><
529385,iamwalleye1,2003-04-03 18:11:00,1589,Bring proof he is yours. Birth cert.
529388,Guest,2003-04-03 18:12:00,0,You should bring his birth certificate as well as a letter from his mother stating it is ok for you to bring him into Canada. I know it sounds rediculous but with children being kidnapped all the time the borders are being a little more diligent about kids travelling.I can't think of anything else other than hope you have a great trip and I'm sure it will be a trip he will never forget.
529386,Reels,2003-04-03 18:36:00,2876,"Hey, congrats on your 1000 post!!You must be a walleye wizz by now, or your bored out of your skull in the hotel room.<{{}}><"
529389,Guest,2003-04-03 19:00:00,0,"ReelsLast year I took my 11 year old over the border without I.D. and the Canadian border patrol didn't think it was a problem, but told me it would be difficult to get back in the U.S. I had my wife fax a copy of his birth certificate to our resort. A family picture also helps.It's our 3rd year going together. What a great experience!Have Fun.BigFish"
529390,Bryan,2003-04-03 19:34:00,244,Reels:I took my son out of country 2 years ago and was questioned about a letter from my wife. They called her and asked for verification.
529391,Guest,2003-04-03 19:54:00,0,"I've been bringing my son to Canada for about 9 years now starting when he was 13. The border never asked for ID for him, but I've heard that a copy of the birth certificate is a good idea. The way that I look at it, the less hassle at the border, the better. I do know that he needs to be 21 before you can bring an extra case of beer along. I thought that it was 18, and they stopped us and made us pay duty on the extra case, but didn't delay us much. Keep taking him - you'll create a lot of memories that'll last a lifetime!!!"
529392,Guest,2003-04-03 20:43:00,0,"Reels,I know of people who have needed the birth certificate and letter from mom, but we have never been asked. The last time, I don't think they realized he was in the back seat until I told them. I always have the birth certificates in a open folder on the dash going across the border, maybe they see them and realize I am prepared and non threating. Or maybe I have just been lucky.Has your son ever fished for 7 days straight? If not, you might want to consider some standard traveling distractions that work for him. For mine, it is comics.Have a great trip,Fritz"
529393,Guest,2003-04-03 20:55:00,0,The best thing a dad to do is bring his son to canada. I went when i was 10 n it was my favorite family vaction ever. I would get some magazines are walleye fishing n let him do his homework about fishing on the way. Also a game boy or soemthing is great. Put his tackel box in the front with him so he can play with all his lures thats what i do on my fishing trips. Have fun...fishing n hunting are #1 sports for boys
529394,Guest,2003-04-03 22:28:00,0,How old should a young'n be for their first trip. I went with my dad at 8. Did anyone try to go with a son younger than 8 without mom along? I usually do 5 day trips but due to travel it is closer to 7 days.Bob
