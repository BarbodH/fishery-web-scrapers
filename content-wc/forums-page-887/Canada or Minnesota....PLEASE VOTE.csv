529610,Guest,2003-04-10 07:04:00,0,Canada buy a wide margin. However the Best Walleye fishing in the World is in Lake Erie
529611,The Eyes_Have it,2003-04-10 08:04:00,315,"Kansas.....well not really, but it's all i've got."
529612,Guest,2003-04-10 12:16:00,0,Canada is the land that dreams are made of. It also happens to be the best Walleye fishing in the world. I grew up fishing in Minnesota and the last 7 years I have fished Canada....no comparison Canada wins!!!!
529613,Guest,2003-04-10 17:16:00,0,I have fished in Minnesota and Canada. Minnesota wins hands down. You guys have absolutely no reason at all to travel. The Walleye there run bigger and they have an attitude.:)
529614,Guest,2003-04-10 18:13:00,0,Ontario is the best baby!!
529615,Guest,2003-04-12 20:59:00,0,"Canada, specificlly Lac Suel if you don't do a fly in. Ironically, we have decided to stay at a Minnesota Resort on Rainy Lake this year. My son claims the fishin was so good on Lac Suel he would like my of a challenge so we are headed for Rainy Lake. No more 100+ Walleye days 200 feet from our Cabin and Northerns on topwater baits in August."
529616,Guest,2003-04-12 21:01:00,0,#1 right on; # 24 how silly to compare Minnesota to Canada.
529605,Ivy,2003-04-08 14:57:00,556,This is a silly question because of the land mass. Ivy
529606,Guest,2003-04-08 15:24:00,0,i have had some huge days on the lake of the woods & and the rainy river on the minnesota side as well as the canada side. But still how can you beat a remote fly-in lake?????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????
529599,alan ex pup,2003-04-08 23:48:00,126,where do you catch walleye in lake michigan?
529600,Guest,2003-04-09 06:47:00,0,"We fished out of Green Bay,Wisconsin with a old College buddy of mine and caught some nice Eyes in July of last year. But I have never caught a Eye in the Gulf of Mexico."
529604,Guest,2003-04-09 13:04:00,0,LOL!Amen.
529607,Guest,2003-04-09 13:04:00,0,I prefer Canada for the solitude and great fishing.
529608,Guest,2003-04-09 13:25:00,0,"Without a doubt, Canada!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Awsome walleye fishing,northern and smallies.Oops,hugh deerflies also.Bites are nasty,going to leech lake this year.Next year Canada again. Rich"
529601,Guest,2003-04-09 13:28:00,0,"Forgetting walleyes for a second....you would give the Gulf an edge in SIZE, over Lake Michigan......right? :)"
529602,Guest,2003-04-09 14:01:00,0,Hey TEACH...Wash your mouth out with soap....forget Walleyes for a second!!!! You better write that on the board 100 times after school.
529603,Guest,2003-04-09 14:11:00,0,See response #14:)
529589,Guest,2003-04-08 11:43:00,0,Would appreciatte the Walleye Central gang casting their votes for who has the better Walleye Fishing...Canada or Minnesota.....I know both areas are great vacation spots and this inquiry is not meant to down grade either area.
529590,Mike KS,2003-04-08 11:56:00,18,I have fished numerous Lakes in both Canada and Minnesota for the last 45 years and have caught Walleyes in both. I perfer Minnesota for family vacations because of better wheather. But the best overall WALLEYE FISHING in my opnion is CANADA.
529591,Stevie B,2003-04-08 12:28:00,157,"I really don't think that this is really a debate. How can you compare the size of Canada to MN. I think that a better comparison would be maybe Manitoba or Ontario to Minn. I personally have not fished in Minn. But I would find it Very hard to believe that there is a lake in Minn. that would compare to a pristine fly-in lake. These are lakes that in their entire life haven't seen as many fishermen as some of the lakes in Minn. see in a week. They say that Minn. is the land of 10,000 lakes, which I don't doubt. But in Manitoba alone there are 100,000 of those 90,000 hold fish. If you exclude the fly-in lakes then you may have an argument, but with the fly-ins there is NO comparison.Fish ON!!"
529592,Guest,2003-04-08 12:49:00,0,I dont think they are comparing by size of land mass. I believe the comparison is Quality of walleye fishing.....Canada for me.
529593,Guest,2003-04-08 12:55:00,0,Slam dunk: Northern Ontario by a wide margin.
529594,Guest,2003-04-08 13:00:00,0,"Oh Please!!! This doesn't even deserve to be voted on. Canada by far! Even if you just took one province like Manitoba, Saskatchewan or Ontario, any of these would kick Minnesota's a**. Minnesota's a beautiful state, but that doesn't translate into the best walleye fishing. I'm still laughing......lol!!"
529595,Guest,2003-04-08 13:10:00,0,This cant be for real...Canada is #1...anybody who thinks different needs a drug test.
529596,Guest,2003-04-08 13:17:00,0,"No contest. Canada wins.But you need need to realize what a huge area you are talking about when you say ""Canada"". It would be like comparing Lake Michigan to the Gulf of Mexico."
529597,Guest,2003-04-08 13:27:00,0,OLD GEOGRAPHY TEACHER....Lake Michigan is better Walleye fishing than the Gulf of Mexico and Canada Is the BEST.
529598,fishmaster,2003-04-08 13:29:00,209,Canada is the place to be!!!!!!Can't beat it.
