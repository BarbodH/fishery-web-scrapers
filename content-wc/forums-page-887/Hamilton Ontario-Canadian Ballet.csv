529805,Geno,2003-04-13 14:36:00,91,For the 10th year my group of ten are coming up to the Kawartha's for the walleye opener and will spend the night in Hamilton before we hit camp on Friday May 9. Can anyone suggest a good club ? And a close by motel that is safe for the boats and all ? Thanks in advance.

I was hoping to get further into Canada than Niagra, we usually stop in Missisauga but that's pretty close to Chinatown where most of the SARS is working. If we can't decide on somewhere around Hamilton, we'll probably go on through Toronto and stop in Oshawa. Thanks for reminding me about Sundowners !"
