We're trying to cross the border at Intnl Falls about 2AM, head west, then north on Hwy 71. We probably will stop and snooze for a couple of hours around LOTW, and then head on north. I would like to stop for breakfast somewhere around Nestor Falls, Crow Lake, or Sioux Narrows. Any recommendations, and how early they might be open?Thanks."
