The second pic down on the right is me (on the right). Not anything special fish wise but I like looking at myself. LOLThe owners are GREAT."
529701,Rick,2003-04-13 17:50:00,226,"Good reply. Preparation is definitely key. I might add that it is also helpful to fish with a large jig and plastic with the barb pinched down. We never seem to lose any fish and its quite easy to remove the hook, especially when its deeply inhaled.They're a valuable resource and worthy of care. Has anyone tried the fish handling gloves sold by Lindy, etc? How about their affect on the slime coat? Occasionally we like to hold one up for a picture. Its about half scary trying to control one until we get the picture."

You might take off a small amount of slime, but more damage is done by them thrashing about in the bottom of your boat."
529706,Guest,2003-04-14 13:24:00,0,"The key to handling a pike is avoiding the net and grabbing the fish directly from the water. This can be accomplished by first grabbing the leader, then directing the fish head foward and then picking the fish up with your other hand. If you keep a little tension on the leader without lifting the fish from the water by the leader (use his own bouyancy), the fish will usually behave and not thrash. Holding the leader also lets you control the fishes head while you then apply the grip, which is the key to handling a pike.For the grip I use just the tips of two fingers (tip of the index and tip of the thumb), and grab it just behind the head. The fingers should contact the fish in the harder ""neck area"" at the top of the opening of the gill plate on the top of the head. You can do this with out entering the gill plate, just pinching the the flesh of the neck. If you apply a pretty good amount of pressure with just the tips of your fingers, 95% of the time the fish will not move and will just open its mouth. You can then pop any hook out with needle nose. The grip works on all size fish, but for fish over 33"" I still use net because the potential for losing it is higher and my buddies would all yell at me.This approach is not for the faint of heart, but it does a lot less damage to the fish than any other method I have seen. Down fall is that I have had one treble hook through the thumb. But that was a mistake and anyway it was worth all of the extra hours of fishing time that I have had not having to mess around with fish flopping in boats/nets."
529707,River_eye,2003-04-14 17:10:00,1486,"Speaking of not using a net, I forgot to add one thing to my post. If you don't use a net, make sure you aren't grabbing for the fish before you have one hand on the leader like MI fisher says. Pike have a weird way of thrashing and throwing the hook at the last minute and if you have your rod bent over, the hook will fly very fast and embed itself into anything that's in it's way, most likely your hand. I learned this one the hard way a couple years ago. Another good reason to pinch your barbs is that the hook will come out of your finger a lot easier. I also learned this one the hard way."
529708,Basser,2003-04-14 18:41:00,31,"The Pike Glove: Discovered this a couple years ago. A garden glove with the rough leather finger insets (available anywhere) can be used to land a walleye and pike up to 30"" just like you land a bass! Being right handed I slip the glove on my left hand and have my right hand free to work the hook loose. It works great and there's no gill damage and you never touch the pike slime - good for the fish and you.Try it - you'll never get in the boat again without your ""pike glove""."
529693,Guest,2003-04-10 18:35:00,0,"I will be fishing for pike for the first time. Hear they are slimy, slick and have teeth. If you catch a large pike, how do you hold them to remove hook and release.Sorry for the dumb question - but it's kind of important to me."
529694,IaCraig,2003-04-10 20:20:00,434,"The best way is to have a net called a cradle so you don't have to touch the fish any more that absolutely necessary. However unless it is a HUGE pike, you can use a spring loaded ""spreader"" that locks his mouth open. You can pick him up with this and easily remove your lure. I've seen people pick them up under the gills and even pinch their eyes, but I can't help to believe that risks permenently harming the fish. IaCraig"
529695,Guest,2003-04-11 06:00:00,0,"Don't forget to mention the smell of those weed carps! I found the best way to handle them is not to. Fight them to the side of the boat, bust them over the head with a small bat, then reach in with a long needlenose pliers to remove your lure. Works every time!"

529697,PRD1,2003-04-11 08:59:00,458,"Just be sure to take along a set of mouth spreaders and a pair of long nose pliers, as much for the fishes sake as yours. Pike have a tendency to clamp their mouth shut sometimes and the spreaders are a critical tool. They are a bit slimey but are a great fish to catch, fight like there is no tomorrow. They can be safely landed by the gill covers but keep your fingers out of their mouth or you will lose some skin. Smaller pike to about 24"" can be easily landed by just grabbing them behind the head. Probably caught a few thousand of them over the years and still enjoy fishing them. Our best luck in Canada, particularly early in the year has been with Husky Jerks, largest sizes in silver, gold, etc.. Later in the year a heavy duty spinner bait is lots of fun ripping it along the top. Johnson Silver minnor with a rubber or pork trailer is also a great bait.Hang a towel on your belt and go for it.Take along a decent size net, ideally one with a rubberized fabric netting (but not rubber) but don't use it unless you have to. Pike will twist and turn more than any fish I know, so particularly with the crank baits you will spend time extracting hooks from the net when you use it. I would not use a cradle personally, unless you have six hands.Paul"
529698,River_eye,2003-04-11 09:19:00,1486,"It is not a dumb question at all. Too many people assume they know what they are doing and end up hurting these magnificent creatures.I'm assuming you've already used a net or pike cradle (optimum).Don't hold them by the eyes whatever you do, and be very carefull when holding them by the gills. Best thing with small pike is just grabbing them by the back. Big pike, it's easier to grab them by the gills, but you must still exercise much caution for the fishes sake as well as yours. You slide your fingers up along the gill plate like a walleye, till your index finger slides up as far as it can go towards the bottom lip. You shouldn't really hold them vertically, although everybody does. The pike can be damaged by all that weight tugging down on their spine, so hold them horizontally with a your other hand supporting the belly. They will want to thrash, so make sure your gill hand doesn't get cut up by the gill rakers, you can make sure of this by gripping the jaw bone with your finger tips rather tightly once you have your hand up there. Also, be carfull not to let too much slime rub off it, this is a very important protective layer. Also, the bigger the pike, the less time you should have it out of the water, although they look like ferrocious beasts, they are really quite fragile. One important thing you can do is have the camera ready before the pike is landed, so you aren't wasting time with the fish out of the water. Don't be surprised if you have to hold them in the water to revive them for a few minutes.Of course, the best handling technique is to get the hook out while in the water and not handle it at all. This will be made easier by pinching the barbs on your hooks. Pike will take the hooks really deep and if it's barbed, you may do a lot of damage. Good luck."
529699,PRD1,2003-04-11 12:01:00,458,"Eric is right on, take care of these critters, especially the big boys since they are a real thrill to catch and are becoming fewer each year. I have spent up to a half hour getting one stabilized after a tough landing. Once in a while they will simply engulph a lure and you will sure need the mouth spreader then. Don't just throw them back, lay them in the water and make sure they are stable and swim off on their own.Paul"
529700,Guest,2003-04-11 12:48:00,0,"Listen to Eric...he knows exactly what he is talking about. You will love catching these ""water wolves."" Good fishing!"
529702,Guest,2003-04-11 15:03:00,0,Where can a guy buy a large jaw spreader? The only mail order ones I can find are from Cabelas and they are pretty small.ThanksGaryB
529703,Guest,2003-04-11 20:52:00,0,"Pike are my FAVORITE fish. They are aggressive, and a blast to catch. Like everyone says (except Dick--obviously an uncaring sportsman--if he is serious) just be prepared and be careful. I would not buy the LARGE jaw spreader. The medium size is large enough. The best thing I use now is a retracting clamp that you grab the fish by the jaw and lift them up using that. Most times you don't even need to touch the fish. Then, while holding the fish, place the jaw spreader and use the needle nose or long hook remover and then when unhooked, take your picture and release the fish. Berkley makes this product and it works REALLY good (I think there are other manufacturers). They are available in Cabella's and BPS for about $25-$30. I caught LOTS of fish last spring in Canada and I think I used my net twice. Very few fish died unnecessarily too."
