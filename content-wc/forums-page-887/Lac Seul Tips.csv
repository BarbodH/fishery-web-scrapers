I have picked up a couple maps for Lac Seul, the NW & SW sections. This lake is full of excellent looking spots , however what are some of the prime walleye & northern areas for those lake sections. During this time of the year are the walleyes in pre-summer patterns?? Will we still find them shallow or have they begun moving to main lake locations. We primarly use spinners & some jig/twister combinations. I'm curious if anyone has experimented with thumper tail plastics (Storm Wildeye Shad etc..) I'm planning on giving them a look this year. Thanks in advance for any help you can offer."

Unless there is a drastic change in the weather you will still find the walleye in shallow. We usually don't have the greatest luck on spinners quite that early, usually still the jig & minnow or jig & leech at that time. Most of the camps stress conservation so put the big ones back!!! I'm there most of the summer, so say hi on the dock!"
