529382,Guest,2003-04-16 07:43:00,0,This one looks like it has been resolved... the walleye win and the guy who doesn't want to fish is out. hhehe
529383,Guest,2003-04-16 08:42:00,0,I think it has been resolved...but the Walleyes lose..Mr. Im To Busy will be replaced by a real fisherman who will actually catch Walleye...unlike Mr. Im to busy.
529372,Guest,2003-04-07 13:06:00,0,"this is an historic day for Mike it seems. His son Joe has found a friend that can both read and type. And has a computer too!! I am so proud of Joe as well I could just bust. I am circling the day on my calendar. And Jimmy Jig, obviously is a peer or alias of Mike to throw out such an insult. Sorry, I am rooting for Kansas .........go big 12. Keep up the good work Joe, you will soon be able to throw those crayons out and get a real pencil. I was still trying to figure out how on earth I could fit this trip into myschedule, but now realize my charity was misplaced. Why guidetwo unappreciative giants when I could have a root canal that would be far less painful. Fair winds gentleman....I hope the fish are hungry and Blue is ice cold."
529373,Guest,2003-04-07 13:31:00,0,As for not having time for walleye.... can't be..Had my last feed last week of fresh walleye from a iced over (5 foot +)Canadian lake .... boy was it ever good. Just that aroma and thatsweet walleye filet are enough to get me back
529374,Guest,2003-04-11 11:23:00,0,"For that friend of yours who doesn't want to fish for walleye, just send him all kinds of walleye spam: Big walleye, little walleye, relased walleye, frying walleye, walleye in a chowder, walleye in a net, walleye in a competition You get the idea :)"
529375,Guest,2003-04-11 13:50:00,0,Maybe that's just an excuse? He wants to go but maybe he doesn't wantto go with you or your crew. Maybe he is in an Al Queda cell?
529376,Guest,2003-04-12 19:03:00,0,.....or maybe he's secretly planning a mission to a Canadian lake without your knowledge. In a short period of time he could get in and out and catch a whole wack of wiley walleyes!
529377,GR8WTHUNTER,2003-04-13 20:58:00,618,You might have hit the nail. My guess is that he really wants to hook up with Barney for a real lesson on catching Canadian Eyes
529379,Guest,2003-04-14 04:14:00,0,"I see this from time to time and its sad. Its like he's given up on life. Next he'll start golfing and then he's in real decline....a real slippery slope. There is not much you can do but look at pictures and cherish the memories. On the flip side he must of not been much of a fisherman....this is in your blood and stays with you for life, this is evolution or culling of the weak at its cruelist a man giving up fishing for work or worse golfing.:)"
529378,Mike KS,2003-04-14 06:07:00,18,Fishing with Barney will only result in a stringer full of Carp and Bullheads. The only thing Barney knows about Walleye is that they are hard to catch.
529380,Guest,2003-04-14 07:07:00,0,"Could be other reasons:1. Money. 2 of our group are not going this year for financial reasons. One was laid off from airline industry and the other sells heavy equipment and sales are off about 50%.2. Personality conflict with others in the group.3. Personal reasons he may not want to discuss, marriage problems, etc. Don't bug him, he's grown up. If he's a true fisherman, not going this year will eat at him all year and he'll be back. Find a replacement for him this year if you can. Adding a new guy to the group makes things more interesting. Who knows, maybe he is actually too busy with family commitments, etc. I missed one year in the past 20 for family reasons, vacation schedule conflict. The next year my wife insisted I go because as hard as I tried, I couldn't hide my dissapointment with missing the annual fishing trip. It seems I was unpleasant to be around at times, according to her."
529381,Guest,2003-04-15 09:15:00,0,Good points bud man. If only all posts on this site made as much walleye sense!
529362,Mike KS,2003-04-03 14:49:00,18,"One of the guys I have had the pleasure of fishing in Canada with every year since I can remember has lost his mind. He is telling me he cant go to Canada and pursue the elusive Walleye this year ""BECAUSE HE IS JUST TO BUSY"". There has to be a cure for this dreaded sickness. This is the kind of thing that can spread though the entire Walleye fishing population like the Hng Kong Flu. Does anybody have the antidote for this....I will pay whatever it takes to cure this fool. Because I love kicking his butt Walleye fishing. HELP"
529363,Guest,2003-04-03 15:27:00,0,"Try showing him pictures of a 12# walleye while calling out ""oh SkunkBoy, remember what a walleye looks like now?"""
529364,Guest,2003-04-03 15:28:00,0,"The only cure I can help you with is a Louisville Slugger up along the side of his thick head and a promise not to kick his butt Walleye fishing. If you need someone to fill in thats not ""TO BUSY"" call Sam."
529365,Alan D,2003-04-03 16:33:00,36,"Heavens, we can't have any of that. Have him go to this site: http://www.geocities.com/dkiazyk2000/ Have a look at the greenback page.It will get his BLOOD boiling again. Hope this is of some help.Alan D"
529366,Guest,2003-04-04 14:05:00,0,I had a guy who claimed the same thing last year. We found out that he actually felt that he was the worst fisherman on the trip so this year he has agreed to go if the rest of us dont use bait until noon.
529367,Guest,2003-04-06 15:04:00,0,I know a guy who is doing the same thing this year. It definitly is a fact that these guys are chicken_ _ _ _. They cant stand to get their brains beaten out on the lake by other Walleye fisherman...no cure known.
529368,Guest,2003-04-07 11:36:00,0,"Gentleman, thanks for your contribution. If you have visitedwalleye central often you know Mike from Kansas is full of crap as a christmas turkey. Mike is nearing retirement, some 20 years older than myself. His social security check is approaching as rapidly as his reflexes are fading. Last year at Lac Suel, the greatest walleye lake on the continent, it took him 3 daysto catch his first fish. Guys, I simply can't stand it anymore.He may be from Kansas, but performs more like Marquette did Saturday.As patient as I am I simply have to have a year of respite. His constant crying about no fish while the rest of us quietly release tens of lunkers per hour has taken its toll. I used to look forward to the day I could retire, but now I look more forward to losing my hearingso I can more easily ignore the overgrown Jayhawk's excuse making. You all seem like pretty good sorts, so I will simply ask you to consider the source. I am going to Canada two other trips this year, so I will still have plenty of opportunity to smile at old Mr. Glass eyes as I reel him in. I won't have to hear the old timer fussover no fish while another Lac Suel lunker spits out his jig for the 50th time. Fair winds to each of you."
529369,Guest,2003-04-07 11:59:00,0,"Euker, I have a resolution to this dilemma. You seem to keep refering to Mike as a Overgrown Jayhawk. I suggest if the Jayhawks beat the Orangeman you go with the boys and take your lumps and if the Orangeman win you stay home. Since you are obviously a quitter afraid of a good ##### whipping you probably dont have the Nads to accept this challenge."
529370,Mike KS,2003-04-07 12:23:00,18,"Im glad to see that Euker finally stuck his 2 cents in this post. Yes it is true that Im older than dirt but when Euker and I Walleye fish together I OWN HIM. When I first met Euker he was a Pike Fisherman and proud of it. It took several years for the fourth grade educated Mizzo fan to realize that Walleye fishing was for real men. Since the day he saw the light and the power of the Walleye he has found that the only fish he ever sees that are big enough to be a Kodak moment are mine. I do let him pose with my fish but his inability to catch anything bigger than his manhood (way below the Lac Seul slot) has obviously wore him down to the mere image of a man..... I knew someday the real Euker would appear. If he could only realize that this will leave a scar on him for life. But alas, Im used to his childish ways and his weak wristed fishing so I will hold a spot for him forever on every trip I make Walleye fishing.....NO MAN EVER STOOD TALLER THAN WHEN HE BENT DOWN TO HELP A MISGUIDED FOOL.....Come back Euker, come back."
529371,Guest,2003-04-07 12:37:00,0,"Dear Dad (Greatest Walleye Fisherman Ever), looks like JR (euker) cant stand the heat in the kitchen. We have to understand that he knows the total whipping two Polocks will give him. After all he cant stay in the boat with one of us let alone two. Im disappointed in JR dad, because you always told me I should look up to him but this appears that maybe you misjudged his fishing ability and his loyalty. Its a sad day but we will have to get over it the best we can. Maybe he will find the guts to go next year."
