529826,Eric,2003-04-14 19:20:00,114,"I fish the manitou 3 weeks each year for 5 years.2 commercial camps on a 55 mile chain of lakes, coves, and bays. Some private residences also. This is a big body of water and takes years to learn but I think camp manitou is all guided. The owner Jerry is a bit of a pain also. Muskie is above average, very clear water, lots of follows and few caught. This is big fish country however, our largest is 54"". Lake trout are abundant, we don't fish for them however but many do. Bass are hit and miss. Some good areas and lots of dead water. Fish are mostly small, a 3 pounder is a very, very nice small mouth on the manitou. Also an occasional largemouth(rare) There are also northern. No Walleye to speak of except a few in mosher bay about 25 miles from camp manitou. A lot depends on timing, some weeks we catch tons of fish, some weeks are slow. This is a big system of lakes and bays. The fish don't jump in the boat. If you are after nonstop action then there are better places.(do a fly-in somewhere). With that being said for beauty, solitude, adventure, and the chance of a record class muskie I will venture no where else"
