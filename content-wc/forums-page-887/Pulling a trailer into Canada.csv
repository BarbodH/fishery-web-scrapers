He asked a couple questions, looked in the car and went back and looked at the boat hookup. I can only guess that he was making sure the hooks were secured."
529726,Hammerhead Herb,2003-04-11 09:31:00,259,I have an oppurtunity to borrow my church trailer on this years fishing trip. Therefore my group can fit into one van (and put all our gear into the trailer) and we won't have to take 2 vehicles. Is there anything that I need to know or any special regs that I have to follow when bringing that trailer into Canada?
529727,Guest,2003-04-11 17:49:00,0,"You need nothing special. My group has been doing something similar for 31 years. You may have to empty it while crossing the border (bording inspection), but you will have no problem."
529728,bigfish1965,2003-04-11 19:45:00,3210,"There is an Ontario rule, somewhat vague and not always enforced, about a secondary clasp for your safety chains. You can also make rubber ones that will suffice. you can email me for directions on how to make them."
529729,Guest,2003-04-11 19:58:00,0,"Bigfish,Are you talking about the ones made from a bicycle inner tube? I cut a few 'rubber bands' and use them to hold the hooks on. They seem to work good (although I never had problems with the other hooks oming undone)and haven't ever been stopped in Canada.Fritz"
529730,Matches,2003-04-11 20:00:00,236,Bigfish1965What is a secondary clasp?
529731,bigfish1965,2003-04-12 07:22:00,3210,"Just like Fritz said, it can be made of a bicycle innertube. It is supposed to stop the chain from jiggling off the hook-up. I've never been stopped either, but I do know from time to time the police get a crayfish in their shorts about these things. Email me if you want more specifics and I'll try and make a diagram. It's a $2.00 fix and is not a bad idea anyway. Apparently someone had their trailer come off the hitch and the jostling made the chains shake off too and the trailer took off, so now we're supposed to use these thingys. It's amazing how few people actually do, though."
529732,Guest,2003-04-12 17:32:00,0,"One other thing, do us all a favour and make sure you have mirrors on your truck that actually see around the sides of your trailer.Nothing worse than following one of those enclosed quad or skidoo trailers, and you know the guy cannot possibly see behind him and is driving with huge blind spots.If their isn't a law there should be."
529733,Matches,2003-04-12 19:27:00,236,It's law you're suppose to have your head lights on at all times isn't it?? I also believe radar dectectors are against the law in Canada also?
529735,GR8WTHUNTER,2003-04-13 20:51:00,618,"The secondary clasp is a device that prevents the hooks on your chains from coming unattached. I use a simple technique that does the task. Duck tape, it fixes everything. Wrap the tape to close the hooks after they are attached. Even if you get something a bit fancier, put a couple of rolls in your truck. That being said, I have never been checked by anyone other than the fish warden at a check point and it was not an issue with them. Rich"
529734,bigfish1965,2003-04-13 21:07:00,3210,Headlights on at all times and the 'use' of radar detectors illegal in Ontario. Keep them in the trunk. Go with the flow of traffic and you won't get a ticket. ( Don't tow a boat at 125 km/h...that will get you a ticket.)
