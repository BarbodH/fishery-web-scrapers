Might help those going up there.Daily guide reports are turned in at the office and accumulate with little fanfare as the month progresses. But when the first of the new month arrives, the stats guys on the guide crew quickly sort the pages and the number crunching begins. We knew that the numbers for June 2002 would be good, but we were still surprised when the final rough counts were totalled. June, historically, has been a good month for walleye volume, big pike and numbers of smallmouth. This year we combined the expected good pike and smallie fishing with exceptional walleye volume, tremendous numbers of big fish as well. At a glance we released 12 pike over 40"" compared to 11 in 2001. We had 21 smallies over 18"" compared to 15 in 2001. We had 32 walleyes over 29"" versus 14 for 2001, and 12 eyes over 30"". The top end for walleyes is impressive, but the real story is the number of big walleyes caught and released for the month with 241 over 27 inches. Lac Seul is it for trophies, no question about it. This past week was excellent and helped to close out an excellent month, and hopefully July will be another great month. For the week we had 13 walleyes over 29 inches and 96 over 27 inches, including 2 over 30"". We are finding walleyes where we expect to find them based on the calendar. Traditional seasonal hot spots have turned on and we are boating numbers of big fish from the sand flats on the deep side of developing cabbage weed beds. Pitching jigs to shallow rock piles and sand beaches is still producing numbers of fish but most of the big ones are being caught from deeper water. Bottom bouncers with spinners and minnows or crawlers are turning most of the bigger fish from 9 to 14'. I am still doing very well with power worms on crawler harnesses as well. Many of the guides are also back trolling jigs/twisters in deep water. Big pike are starting to show up on the developing main lake cabbage but we are still picking up half our pike while walleye fishing. For the week we had 3 over 40"" and 11 in the upper 30"" range and all released. The smallmouth action was consistent for the week despite the attention given the walleye fishing. We know that there is more to life and guiding then stats, but it is hard not to get excited about numbers this strong. We hope our great fortune continues for our guests. Most guests are rebooking to hold their spots for next year, can't say that I blame them. Check out our reports on http://www.justfishontario.com"
