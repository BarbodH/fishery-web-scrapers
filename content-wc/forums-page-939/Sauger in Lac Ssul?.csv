522241,Big Tim,2002-07-07 09:25:00,63,"Got a bet going on, any body know if sauger are common in Lac seul? I'm saying most of the fish we catch in lac Seul are Walleyes. One of our ""experts"" said 10 to 20% of the fish we caught are actually Saugers. I think they were just walleyes with different coloring than others."
522242,Guest,2002-07-07 09:57:00,0,"Big Tim,The sauger is quite common in Lac Seul. These are not variations of the walleye as witnessed by the distinctive markings on their dorsal fin and the lack of a white spot on the base of the caudal (tail) fin.Jig'N'John"
522243,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-07 10:24:00,6,I agree there are Saugers caught in Lac Seul. I think the % caught is less than 10% but we have been catching them in Lac Seul for years.
522244,Guest,2002-07-07 18:09:00,0,"There are sauger in LS. Biggest one caught in my boat is a 21"" er by the wife 4 years ago in Fairwell Bay. During the warmer water temps>go back into Sawmill bay and troll Hot n Tot's in 8-10' of water and you'll find bunches as well as perch."
522245,guide7,2002-07-07 20:29:00,70,we had one sauger in one of our boats this year. 1 out of hundreds of of fish caught. all the others were walleye and a few jacks. Quite obvious when you see the markings. The % your experts mentions is waaaaaaaaaay off in my opinion though.7 out
522246,Jigger1,2002-07-08 07:22:00,234,"Ditto that - we caught a total of two in our boat as compared to several hundred walleye. Less than 1% in our boat.MP3553 - nice sauger, master angler is 22"" if I'm not mistaken."
522247,lunker99,2002-07-09 09:01:00,236,"I also agree. We only had two sauger for all the walleye that we caught this year. We usually fish pretty shallow, but the day we caught ours we were checking out main lake points out in deeper water."
522248,Guest,2002-07-09 19:58:00,0,Oh....forgot!This year in 2 weeks-zero sauger were caught in my boat.Would agree that the percentage is way off!
522249,Guest,2002-07-09 23:37:00,0,been fishing lac seul for one week of the summer for the past 11 or 12 years and have yet to have one sauger in my boat.Can't even recall seeing them in the fish cleaning house from the other guests.
522250,Guest,2002-07-10 04:47:00,0,"There certainly are sauger in Seul. Even caught some with red and black markings on them, looked radio active. I think they are more common in certain areas than others. But I think there is a pretty good population in some parts."
