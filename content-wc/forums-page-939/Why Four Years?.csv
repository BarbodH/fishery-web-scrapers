Eric Brown, 49, of Sioux Narrows, and Totem Lodge of Sioux Narrows Limited have been fined $17,000. Brown and Totem Lodge were fined $1,000 on May 15 for an over-possession of walleye, which happened at the lodge in June 1998. The guide involved in the operation had already been convicted and sentenced. On May 16, Brown was fined $5,000 and Totem Lodge was fined $10,000 for having 49 walleye over the limit at the lodge and at Brown's residence in June 1998. The convictions and sentencing end an undercover operation conducted by the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) on Lake of the Woods in 1998. Justice of the Peace Gordon Buterin took into account the amount of walleye, the commercial connection of the offence and the need for deterrence in arriving at the sentences. The public is asked to protect its natural resources by reporting violations to any MNR office or by calling Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477)."

522336,Thumper,2002-07-10 03:50:00,133,The MNR enforcement has changed a lot over the years. They actively soilicite information from conservation minded sportsman and will spend the time discussing other issues other than enforcement when in the field. Their public relations is getting really good. The end result being that sportsman who witness law breaking will now not turn a blind eye to it. We all win in the end.
