522256,Guest,2002-07-09 08:05:00,0,The best leeches we have found in the 6 years going to minaki is at a place in Sioux Narrows. Place called the Maple Leaf Motel telephone number 1-888-229-0405. They have true jumbo leeches and their price seems reasonable compared to the rest. Call them in advance to order jumbos. When we picked ours up this year he had them already bagged. The group in front of us did not order and their leeches were not near as nice as ours. In June the leeches that we couldve bought in Minaki were sunfish leeches. Hope that helps you out.

522258,Guest,2002-07-09 19:13:00,0,I do not remember. I ordered them but did not pay for them. It was less then they wanted to charge us in Minaki for small leeches. The number I gave is toll free and you will talk to the owners wife she can give you a price.
