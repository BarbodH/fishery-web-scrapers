522314,Guest,2002-07-10 04:43:00,0,"You don't need to worry about water levels on St. Joseph as it is the most hazardous lake in Ontario. The map is off, was made when the water was two feet above normal. Old Post makes you take a guide cause otherwise you have a very stong chance of hitting something. Boulder city is virtually impossible to get through unless you have experience. Hope you are not taking your own boat as there is no parking for private boats and camp catches the winds. Generally they fish with heavy jigs and twister tails. Jigs in 3/8 to 1/2 ounce. They don't worry about finessing up there. Be prepared for some long boat rides as they travel west from the lodge for about an hour and a half. By the way, don't leave anything in your car as the natives get restless up there, but for a price you can buy security."

We have chosen to a few times just for a different approach to the fishing.I have also found the maps to be quite accurate. The lake does contain many hazards, however if a person is careful they are pretty easy to avoid. I don't think there are any maps available that show all of the hazards in a given lake.Boulder City can be a problem if you don't follow the shore markers that are there. If you're lined up with those there won't be a problem.I also take my own boat every year. In fact, in our group there are three of us that take our own boats. We've never had a problem finding space on the beach. I have parked on the back beach a couple of times when the wind was blowing into the front of the camp quite strong. Again, plenty of room there also.You are correct that you don't need to worry about finesse on St. Joe. That's one of the things that I like about the lake. No light bites here. They smack em pretty good.I appreciate the fact that the camp has secure parking. The fact that I have to pay a little for that convenience is no problem at all. I realize that The old Post is a somewhat pricey camp in relation to some others, but what's an extra $25 in the overall scheme of it all. The fishing is fantastic, and the camp staff goes out of their way to make your stay the best possible. That's the most important things to me.Fred"
522316,Guest,2002-07-10 10:01:00,0,"Your right on Fred, I have had no problems with the map and really never needed a guide. Also, the best fishing I had there last year was in Soules Bay (10 minute drive). I have a buddy up there right now. I'll give you an update when he gets back. Fred, I'll see you in 3 weeks. Jim"
522318,Jim,2002-07-10 10:04:00,238,"Riceburner, have you been to St. Joes before? Email me at [email protected]."
522317,Fred_G,2002-07-10 10:29:00,908,"Hi Jim! I can't wait to get up there. I was at Wabaskang last week. Did ok, but nothing compares to St. Joe for me. Look forward to seeing you in camp.Fred"
