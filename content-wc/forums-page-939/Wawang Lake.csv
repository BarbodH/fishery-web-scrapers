522320,Tom,2002-07-09 19:21:00,1063,"Went to Wawang last summer. Fishing on main lake was not good, couldn,t find a walleye. Plenty of northern action. We went in Aug. so it did not supprise me. We took the fly in one day ($100/each)and had the best fishing possible. Many and big! Folks are very nice and helpful. They discussed doing more with portage in lakes in the future. Some of their regulars did just that one day and their stringer was impressive. Worst part was the drive on gravel. 40 miles off #17 pulling a boat was not fun. If I go back will not take my boat. No docks, just beach the boat, wind and waves really can on a windy day crash in. They pull their little rentals totally out of water every night. Hard to do with a bigger boat. Bottom line I,d go back but it ain't heaven. Have fun, Tom"
