I salvage the beads, blades, and clevices. When making them, I put a drop of super glue over the line wrap near the eye of the hook. Some glue gets into the eye and have used the wire brush on the bench grinder to remove the glue. Here is the question: Does the wire brush affect the integrity(strength) of the hook?? I know I have to watch to see if any rough spots/etc. are on the hooks. What else should I be aware of?? What line should I use in making the new harnesses - e.g. flurocarbon(?), fireline(?), what pound test(?). Thanks!!!"
521664,dctolle,2002-06-21 11:07:00,9,"Mal, i too make my own harnesses. its the only way to go, for your question, mono is the absolute best in my book. Fireline is great for fishing, but is terrible for harnesses. Dont even bother trying. it is too limp... I use berkley trilene 20 lb. test. it seems to withstand the best. It usually takes rocks or something like that to break them, and the heavier line doesnt twist as bad. As for the glue, I would experiment with new knots and do away with the glue. The knot i use, isnt really a knot at all, but the harder something pulls on the line, the tighter it gets.. No pulling them out.. and the best part, NO GLUE!!!! Let me know and i will try and explain it to you...good luck,dctolle"
521665,Mal,2002-06-21 13:23:00,55,"Your are absolutely 100% correct, I love making my own worm harnesses. Good winter-time activity and there have been many times that someone in our fishing party always wants to use one like mine when I get on the fish. Email me at [email protected] on how or what knots to use on the harness without the use of glue."
521666,Mal,2002-07-08 20:30:00,55,Sent you a personal message back. Have not heard from you on how you tie the harnesses without using any glue to reinforce the knots. Send info to [email protected]
521667,SWeed,2002-07-08 20:48:00,66,"Am wondering if you sharpen the old hooks after two or three years may be time to use new hooks.... I always use 20# berkley big game, have been real happy with it. Have thought about trying a flouracarbon anyone tried it, Thought it may be better for the finicky fish when casting the short harnesses????????? Trolling it probably doesn't matter, however on a slower presentation?"
521668,Mal,2002-07-09 05:24:00,55,Most of the harnesses that are 2 to 3 years old have never been off the spool. I find that those I use the most have dull hooks and got rid of them. Its those that never get used for one reason or another. I have been using #20 Sensithin line. Tried Fireline once and it caused nothing but problems.
