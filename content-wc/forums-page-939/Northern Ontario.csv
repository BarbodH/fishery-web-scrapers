Mostly trout but I do know some of the walleye lakes around Wawa and Chapleau.Also,If anyone is looking to buy a camp or cottage in Northern Ontario I can help. I have listings from Sault Ste Marie, Wawa, Chapleau, and St.Joesph Island. I also have land, lodges, resorts and summer homes.Email me at [email protected] or visit www.northalgoma.com if your interested."
