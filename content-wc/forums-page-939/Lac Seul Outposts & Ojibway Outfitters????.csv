522170,Guest,2002-07-04 14:36:00,0,I think this sounds like a very interesting adventure. I would appreciate any reports from people who have been there.

522172,Guest,2002-07-06 05:46:00,0,"Has anybody been to this camp on chamberlain narrows. Any comments about the acomadations, fishing, and in general, how was your time there would be apreciated.Here are some past comments about Ojibway Outfitters and the fishing in the Chamberlain Narrows area.1. ""RE: Lac Seul Outpost -Ojibway Outfitters""In response to message #0 Great fishing! Big Fish present. We have caught walleyes up to 30""(and many 25 ), (3) 40"" Northern (many 35"" to 38"", Perch up to 11"", smallmouth up to 19"" and Musky (our biggest is 42"" but they can run much bigger).Good place to catch some nice fish. I have fished there four times and have caught big fish on each trip.Make sure that you bring a camera and some good rain gear because we have always needed both.Usually fish live-bait rigs for walleyes.Cast spoons, bucktails, suicks and topwaters for northern and muskies. Flip: It's great fishing, but bring your own gas. Ken always has moisture in his tanks. Also plan for an 40mi in and a 40mi out. Some of my friends didn't plan for gas out and bought some there and had trouble keeping their motors running smooth. Good luck FISHING, THE ICE IS FORMING ON LOTW, GO ICE...KazKaz We have been there 3 times over the past 10 years. I would recommend it, the camp has improved greatly over the past 10 years and Ken and his wife are now living there during the summer. I was there with three fishing buddies during the week of September 11. Ken was very helpful and brought in newspapers, let us use his cell phone and made every effort to reduce our anxiety over the terrible events of that week.That said, the fishing is good as well. Good for Walleye, Pike and Muskie. Ken has a new fuel tank system and barge to bring it in so I think the water-in-the fuel issue in the previous post is past history. We burned a lot of gas during the week and had no problems.Paul Paul: I'm glad to hear that problem is gone. I also like the camp. Fishing north and east of camp was great for some huge Musky. I don't think I could make it back to the landing, even with GPS, by myself though. Good luck Fishing....KAZKaz Hey guys,THanks for all your help, it's greatly apreciated. sounds like you all bring your own boats in. I unfortunatly don't own a boat big enough to make that kind of trip, so I would be boating in with them. What kind of boats and motors do they provide for fishing, and how much gas can I except yo use. What was he charging for premixed. One more thing. I'm taking my wife along and while an acomplished angler, she prefers that the cabin and overall acomadations to be above average.How are they? Recomandations on when to go? Any words of wisdom would be helpful, thanks again. Flip,You will fish out of a 16-foot Lund boat with a false floor and fold up seats. The boat is equipped with a 25 HP Mercury motor. It is just your basic aluminum boat. Back in 1996 I fished out of a resort boat. We fished out of the resort for seven days and used approximately 36 gallons of mixed gas during the week. Buying gas at the camp is expensive.Your gas usuage and the price per gallon can really add to the cost of your trip. Gas has to be hauled in 40 miles on the barge and that is one of the reasons the price of gas is so high.I am telling you this so you are prepared for it.Remember, you are on vacation with some of the biggest fish swimming below your boat, so enjoy the experience and catch big fish. The Lac Seul trips I have taken have been great. Twice, I have seen bears swimming across the water and got some great pictures. I have seen Moose, Caribou, eagles and many loons while fishing the Chamberlain Narrows area.I like to explore and try new areas but you do not have to travel very far to catch fish in the Chamberlain Narrows area. I recommend bringing a portable depthfinder to help you find hidden hot spots.Your wife will definitely want a VIP cabin (more $) so you would have flush toilets and showers in the cabin. If you don't go the VIP cabin route there are a couple of outhouses and a camp shower that anyone can use.The accomadations are very basic. Make sure you prepare your wife for this. One of many examples are there are no curtains on the cabin windows. Mid-June you can catch some really big walleyes.My trips have been in either August or September.For walleyes we fish jig and minnows, or live-bait rigs with minnow or crawlers. Make sure you have plenty of bait because you will use it all. Last year we went through 35 dozen crawlers and 30 dozen minnows with five fisherman in a week.Another tip:Using a pair of talkabout 250 radios might not be a bad idea if you were out fishing and your wife was back relaxing at the cabin and needed to get a hold of you.Good luck,RubesExcellent camp with a great location for walleye, northern pike and muskie fishing. The walleye action is superb from May to the camp closing. As suggested by others, plan on bringing portable depthfinders is using one of Ken's camp boats. They are an excellent addition; also maps can be obtained from them. It is the basic Ministry map, which is a decent beginning. Have made 9 trips there and never had problems with the gasoline. Ken and Brenda are good operators and will try to do whatever to make the trip a success.Russ WaryeSenior Research EditorFishing Hot SpotsTLY Our group has stayed at the narrows twice, it was OK but since that time i understand there have been many improvements.Prior to that, I have dealt with them for many years and had excellent serice, cooperation and have had the most memorable trips ever. Just talked to them at the St Paul show this week. As for gas, he indicates it is about $1 more than from the pump in town. It doesn't get out there for free.You really need to go to Scaler lake for ssome good walleye action although you are also close to Skidoo and other good spots.Defintely a good choice.TLY"

522175,Guest,2002-07-08 08:05:00,0,Just came back from our fourth trip up there. Accomodations are fine and fishing is great. It is about an hour and fifteen minute trip in and out but worth it because you don't need to travel far to fish from there. We have never had any trouble with Ken's fuel. He has new tanks. A great getaway.
522176,Guest,2002-07-08 11:09:00,0,"Hey,Jiggin, how about a few details as far as the fishing goes.Thanks"
522177,Guest,2002-07-08 20:25:00,0,"Have been going to Chamberlain for the last 7 years and the fishing just keeps getting better.Usually catch 50-100 walleyes per day per boat. Many (10 or so per day) are over slot (longer than 21 inches). Last year our group caught a 9.5 and two 7.5 pounders with many 4-6 pounders. All were released.Sunken Islands in late July, August are best but fish are also off points of islands, all at 20-30 feet.Very diverse settings (large open waters or small bays and everything in between).Jigging with minnows works wonders but a slip bobber with a leech is fun also.Find your fish trolling and/or watching your fish finder. Then anchor over them.There are also some huge,world class muskie.We have caught Pike in the 10-18 pound range trolling plugs but the walleye is our main target and it is an unbelievable fishery.Ken and Brenda are excellent hosts and the camp is extremely comfortable for being so remote. The generator runs 24 hours/day and you never hear it. Plenty of ice available.If you want to catch walleye it is the place to go and I live near Lake Erie and the Detroit river."
522178,TomPGrouse,2002-07-09 06:10:00,124,Jim is that 100 fish per guy or boat?
522179,Jim,2002-07-09 06:35:00,238,In my experience it is about 100 walleye per boat per day. But we only fish about 6-8 hours for walleyes and the rest of the time is casting Muskie.
522180,TomPGrouse,2002-07-09 18:11:00,124,......and of course can you tell me about the muskie fishing please?
