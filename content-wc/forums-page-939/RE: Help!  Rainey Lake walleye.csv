522124,Guest,2002-07-04 15:01:00,0,You need to fine clean water or it's pretty dismal. Found some on the east end of Swell's and in Seine Bay. Still had to work for them but much better than in the water with all the sediment.
522125,old fisherman,2002-07-04 17:16:00,545,You'll find them in the frozen food section!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
522126,Guest,2002-07-05 07:37:00,0,Hey FSTTLKER:We have been finding big walleye cruising close to shorelines and mainlake weed beds in surprisingly shallow water. I sort of lucked into a nice mess of walleye this week fishing for smallies. Huskie Jerks and twister tails have been good for me. Of course you will catch a few smallmouth and the odd pike but you will be catching fish.Hope this helpsJackfish
522127,Guest,2002-07-05 20:53:00,0,I was just up on Red Gut on Tuesday 7-2. The water was way up about 5 feet and muddy. I found walleye on two reef tops near Gull Island. Nothing big. Fishing was slow. I hear they got another inch of rain today Sat. 7-5. There was lots of current. TGG
