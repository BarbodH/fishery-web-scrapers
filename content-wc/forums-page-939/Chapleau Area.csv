It is a boat in camp with very nice facilities, the cabins have running hot and cold water, with in door toilets. Propane appliances. the rates are very attractive. Our fishing was excellent, lots of small eyes and a few nice northerns. the owners of the camp Tom and Georgia Lee are extreamly friendly and made our trip enjoyable. do not remember the web site, but if you search Praire Bee Camp I am sure it will come up. Their equipment is newer, Honda 9.9 4strokes outboards with 14ft boats. Give them a look. Randy Van Den Heveul"
