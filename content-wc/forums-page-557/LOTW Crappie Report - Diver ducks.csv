We had more luck last week when it was 70. The diver ducks aren't down yet. But, that doesn't mean that 50,000 of them won't show up tonight. Just not here yet."
1140770,Red Tail Chub,2009-10-07 20:40:00,17,Still no crappies then? We were up on the 25th for a few days and found nothing going as far as crappies. Not much of anything as far as that goes. What's the water temp now? Was still 69f when we were up.
1140812,Obabikon,2009-10-08 07:18:00,2370,"The water temp has cooled, and I'm sure the crappies are up there. We've been catching them off and on since the beginning of September. I just haven't been in the past 5 days, so couldn't say for sure."
1140825,J-Man,2009-10-08 08:28:00,191,"Saw some 54-55 degrees on Monday. We have some very cold over night lows in the forecast for this weekend, especially factoring in the wind. Accuweather is showing possibly 1-3 inches of snow on Saturday.Crappies were better in Miles Bay instead of OB for our guests last weekend.Seems to be more reports of an afternoon bite than a morning bite the past week, but has been better in the morning at times previously."
1141606,Guest,2009-10-12 10:06:00,0,"I just returned Sunday pm from Morson. The weather was pretty foul. We fished Fri afternoon out west for walleye and caught a few. Saturday was going to be crappie day. Well things were pretty ugly, a couple of water lines started to freeze so we went into winterize mode. Stayed for a big feast on Sat night and came home sunday. I figured the weather would push some divers around but few to be seen. I want to thank everyone around Morson for the updates thruout the year. Be back up in Feb for some ice fishing. Til then... Jon"

Catching a lot of walleye in miles bay but not many crappie yet. Jinging off bottom. Would love to hear if anyone sees any divers. Never new this sight existed will have to keep it as a favorite.
1142917,Kevin R,2009-10-18 19:33:00,305,What is diver ducks ?
1143071,Lazy Fisherman,2009-10-19 15:29:00,276,"Divers are ducks that dive completely under the water to feed. Examples are Ring Necks, Canvasbacks, Red Heads, Scaup and several others. Also, divers run along the water to take off. Puddle ducks on the other hand are surface feeders or tip up with their tails in the air when feeding. Examples are Mallards, Teal, Gadwalls, Wigeon, and others. Also, puddle ducks flush straight up to take flight."
