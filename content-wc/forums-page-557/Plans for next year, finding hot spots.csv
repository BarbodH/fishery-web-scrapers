1142610,Moondog,2009-10-16 19:21:00,362,"When you fished the Keg this year did you fish the bouys? mouth of the Chukuni? or did you venture into the body of the lake itself and fish points and islands? The Keg has always spooked us because of its ability to remove your lower unit etc. Just wondering what your luck was this last summer, knowing full well that by next year all bets are off."
1142622,freespoolin,2009-10-16 21:00:00,472,"We fished points in Keg, 4 days, always with positive results."
1142739,1shooter,2009-10-17 18:52:00,1493,We havent used guides for years but have talked to the guides about advice and have tipped them well for it. Is this a no..no????
1140877,Babamel2,2009-10-08 13:08:00,414,"what are you planning to do different next year, fishing stratigies, meals, or equipment?I plan to go to the same camp, but this year we had trouble locatiing fish, they were not in the usual places. How do you go about finding the hot spots?"
1140891,trapper_john,2009-10-08 14:39:00,83,"The camp that we go to, Kingfisher on Wabaskang, will put us on fish."
1140898,Obabikon,2009-10-08 14:49:00,2370,"take out a guide for one day. Helps the local economy, and puts you on some new spots."
1140911,Steve of Madison,2009-10-08 15:51:00,230,"Ob is correct, if the guides are available, use one! They know the water and the patterns. But if they are not available or you are just set on figuring it out on your own, remember a couple of things, doing the same things over and over expecting different results is the definition of stupidity. Don't be afraid to try different tactics, baits, locations, depths etc, etc. This past year most will agree was tough on Lac Seul, but after a couple of ""interesting"" days, and some time spent going over the maps, and putting all of the pieces together we found fish, and they were hungry! And the best part was, we saw 2 other boats in 3 days. Even the lodge owner, when I told them where we were fishing was surprised. In normal years it was a spot that we would not even try, but 2009 was not a normal year. We backtroll spinner rigs, jig, slipbobber, troll stickbaits, and lindy-rig. All depending on what the wind, water temps, structure and weedlines are telling us. That's why it's fishing, not catching, and not to mention FUN."
1140933,rpieske,2009-10-08 19:01:00,1276,"One of the things I started doing some years back is concentrating on a single area for an entire day. Fish all the ""regular"" spots, but then look for those secondary spots near the old reliable spots. Look for smaller, less obvious areas. Fish slower and more thoroughly. Vary your presentation, lures, times, etc. It especially pays off on hard fished lakes, but it will surprise you how effective it is even on those remote lakes. Plus you save fuel. Win-Win.... Give it a try."
1140941,Obabikon,2009-10-08 19:34:00,2370,"I'm a big fan of taking guides. They've taken a big hit in employment the last 10-15 years. For you cheap skates out there... don't ask a guide where to fish. It's rude. Most guides (if asked) will give you information, however, they don't like being put on the spot. You don't ask a cook for their secret ingredients. You don't call a stock broker and ask for free tips. You don't go to a grocery store expecting free milk... Anyhow... spend the money on the service. It's worth it."
1142392,Guest,2009-10-15 15:40:00,0,"We fish LS and have a guide with us every day. It's worth it, but what am I going to do differently? Most of the time we jig, either vertically or pitching. What my plan this is is to have one pike pole always handy with a pretty big lure on it (soft plastics or large crank) and before we leave each spot, make a couple of casts with the pike set up and see what happens. Last year was interesting in that we got more large pike while walleye fishing than ever before. I am quite certain that it was due to the cold weather which caused the large pike to remain more shallow than they have been in the past (2nd week in June). As such, my plan is a bit weather dependent, but the variety the pike provided was fun even when the walleye were hitting well. Last year the largest was 38.5 on walleye gear, so perhaps this year by throwing something larger our party can break the 40 inch mark. Other than that, I cannot think of much other than continue to pick the brains of our guides so I can apply that knowledge when I fish without them (and do much worse). IA Walleye"
1142395,Steve of Madison,2009-10-15 15:56:00,230,"Your observations on the Pike are correct. We too, caught many more larger pike on walleye gear last season. 44"" while backtrolling a worm harness, and a 46"" on a fuzzy grub and minnow under a slip-bobber. Landing them was an adventure with nothing more than a rubber walleye net. But back to the original point, any guide worth his salt will accomodate the guests if asked to try some different presentations. My last time out with a guide we asked if there was a good spot to throw for Pike...his answer was anywhere in the weeds. But his next statement..""you wanna catch those things?"" was something we still talk and chuckle about.Fishing is all about putting the pieces together, what works one day may not the next, because something else has changed. The wind switched, it got colder/hotter, too many boats, sunny, cloudy, a big mother Pike strolled through the area, they all can effect the bite. But again...that's why it's so much fun!"
1142498,northernbite,2009-10-16 07:54:00,1186,"Just remember if you always fish where you fished last year and the year before your fishing memories. This year showed that dog didn't hunt. Every year is different; different spot, different depth and different presentation.That's why you have all that stuff in your tackle box. It is even more fun once you find them. I spent 2 weeks up there the end of May and the first of June plus 10 days the end of July. Nothing like last year either time.Paul"
1142518,freespoolin,2009-10-16 09:48:00,472,"We've been fishing Red Lake for 13 years. The first year we hired a guide. Since then we've explored and acquired knowledge of many different spots. What has been consistent is that it changes every year. This year the fishing in Keg was better than it's ever been. Spots in Red Lake that always produced in previous years were dead. But the key is to have more choices for changes in lake temperature, wind direction, lake level, time of the season. We take crawlers, leeches and minnows because again it changes. We change presentation, sometimes it's a spinner bite, sometimes a jig bite. The key is to be open to what the fish are telling you they want. And listen to the camp owner who sees the result of his guests fishing day after day."
