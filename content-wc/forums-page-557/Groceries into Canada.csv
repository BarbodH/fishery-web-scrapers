1142921,Kevin R,2009-10-18 19:56:00,305,They ask but may not ask all the time like they did years ago. My uncle paid duty on a Turkey he brought in. We still laugh about it to this day they asked him if he had any food & he went on about how good he was going to eat got me a great big Turkey.
1141907,Mike Kansas,2009-10-13 12:35:00,1463,We have crossed at IF 50 times or better in the last 20 years for stays of a week with groceries and have never been asked how much food we have.
1141912,JayM5209,2009-10-13 12:49:00,1050,"Same experience as Bill K's. Been crossing thru Intl. Falls for more than thirty years. In the early years the question about quantity of groceries was a regular one, but haven't heard it in the last 15 or more years."
1141928,Jimmy Jig,2009-10-13 15:04:00,1905,"At one time the rule was a ""reasonable"" amount of food was OK. I would say if you had a summer home up there and tried to carry in a 3 months supply, that is not reasonable."
1142039,steven paulson,2009-10-14 06:56:00,20,They used to ask all the time. I think it was no more than 3 days of food per person.
1142052,Mohleye,2009-10-14 07:58:00,368,"I think Jimmy Jig hit it on the head. With all the things they have to worry about, groceries is probably not a high priority. However, they do always ask,""How long will you be in Canada?"" If it looked like you had an outrageous amount of groceries for the time you were staying, it would probably raise some questions/problems."
1142069,onetimedave,2009-10-14 09:03:00,502,"On 49+ plus trips to the GREAT NORTH I have never paid a duty on groceries. In fact I can't remember if I was ever asked about the quanity of groceries I had. Just asked about, beer, liquor, tobacco, firearms, etc."
1142073,retire55,2009-10-14 09:12:00,1029,"Here's an excerpt from a publication from the Canada Border Services Agency entitled ""Information for Visitors to Canada and Seasonal Residents"" - the web reference is http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publicati...eng.html#s2x12 The CFIA and Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada have set limits on the quantity and/or dollar value of certain food products you can bring into Canada duty-free or that you can include in your personal exemption. Unless you have an import permit from Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada for quantities over and above the established limits, you will have to pay duty based on a rate ranging from 150% to 300% of the value of the goods. The following are some examples of the limits that apply to personal importations of food products from the United States: * 2 dozen eggs; * 20 kilograms of dairy products not exceeding $20 in value (e.g. cheese and butter); * 3 kilograms of margarine or butter substitutes; and * 20 kilograms of edible meats and meat products, including turkey and chicken. Within this limit, more CFIA and Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada restrictions apply as follows: * a maximum of one whole turkey or 10 kilograms of turkey products; * a maximum of 10 kilograms of chicken; and * a maximum of 5 kilograms of edible meats and meat products from cattle, sheep, goat bison and buffalo. My interpretation is that these are individual limits. I doubt these limits would impact anyone during a fishing or hunting trip."
1142096,trapper_john,2009-10-14 12:01:00,83,"having crossed at IF many times, we have never been asked about food being brought in. Potatos being the only exception. In any event it would be no problem for us because we do the biggest part of out shopping in Dryden anyway. The one thing I do find to be a bit over the top is the ""dirt"" that the crawlers are in. The worms the we buy here in Wisconsin come from Canada. I always take them out of the dirt, wash them well and put them in bedding. This is done well in advance. I make sure that before we leave I clean any dirt off just before we leave for camp."
1142127,PRD1,2009-10-14 14:10:00,458,"This is straight from the Canadian Border Services Agency Web Site. To make things easier 10 kilograms is 22 pounds. As you can see the limits are very generous. The Web site is:http://cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/...eng.html#s2x12 Food Products Canada has complex requirements, restrictions and limits on the importation of meat, eggs, dairy products, honey, fresh fruits and vegetables, and other food from around the world. For example, the importation of root crops may be regulated and that of potatoes is prohibited. You can avoid problems by not bringing these kinds of goods into Canada. You can import certain meat and dairy products from certain states in the United States. Before entering Canada with these products, contact BIS at one of the telephone numbers listed in the section called ""Additional information"", or refer to the Automated Import Reference System (AIRS) on the CFIA's Web site.

1142239,Larry L,2009-10-14 22:47:00,335,I just hate it when someone messes up a good thread with a bunch of facts.
1141665,walleyes4u,2009-10-12 14:21:00,12,"We cross into Ontario at the Grand Portage crossing and have never been asked how many days supply of groceries we have. We do have a mobile home we own on leased land and I don't know if that makes a difference, but some people I talked to have been told they are only allowed to bring 2 days worth of groceries across the border from the US to Canada. Any anyone heard about this? I would hate to have our weeks worth of groceries causing a problem on crossing. It's not that I couldn't use a little calorie restriction but I like to eat while I am on vacation and the only store we passed went out of business."
1141667,rockpt,2009-10-12 14:27:00,589,Only two days of groceries??? That's a new one. Been going to Canada twice/year for over 20 years and always do the housekeeping plan. Never once been asked how much food we're bringing over.
1141680,Nimstug,2009-10-12 15:24:00,2605,"No, I haven't heard of such a regulation. I certainly haven't been to Canada as Rockpt, but I've never been asked about the quantity of foodstuffs I have. For what it's worth, I cross at I.F.Nimstug"
1141752,SimilarIsland,2009-10-12 19:25:00,121,I've never been asked either crossing at IFalls. Maybe one of the other Provinces has a restriction.
1141755,Catman59,2009-10-12 19:28:00,345,I have crossed there for the last 5-6 years and have never been asked about my groceries ...... other than potatoes.
1141764,Larry L,2009-10-12 19:45:00,335,I was on the phone today to a friend in Wisconsin. He said his son just got back from a goose and duck hunt in Sask. He was complaining that they had to pay a duty because of extra groceries.
1141770,Moondog,2009-10-12 20:07:00,362,"Went spent 7 weeks in Canada this year and crossed at Pembina. Never asked about groceries, just guns, booze and taters. Coming back we had an ""Ag Specialist"" visit who took green onions, apples without ""made in the USA"" stickers and all our citrus."
1141771,SimilarIsland,2009-10-12 20:08:00,121,I've heard of being charged duty for extra gas in some provinces also.
1141782,Bill Krejca,2009-10-12 21:15:00,6107,"Many years ago, maybe 30 or 40, they used to regularly ask how many dollars in groceries we were bringing in. I used to save the receipts, don't remember ever paying duty, but back then, my groceries were purchased in Spartan quantities anyway, didn't need much for camping and eating fish every meal. Bill Krejca"
1141824,WalleyeWally28,2009-10-13 07:21:00,298,Have crossed at Pembina 15 times in last 13 years and have never been asked about quantity of groceries.
