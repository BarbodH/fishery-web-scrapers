1141130,Burr,2009-10-09 16:47:00,8612,Not sure on this weekends tourney - all I know is I couldn't get a room at Papertown 10 days ago - they are booked. I've heard around 50 for next weeks tournament. I'll be there for that one.
1141186,RyanG,2009-10-09 21:52:00,16,Sounds like the local economy has had a toll on the local anglers so there are only 45-46 entries so far. Any idea how the bait situation is looking? Sounds like salties are tough to come by.Ryan
1141211,Backwater Eddy,2009-10-10 04:12:00,3871,"Ryan if dropping through Fargo is a doable plan for you, I have large salted and frozen Fatheads on hand at Gander Mtn already prepacked in tubs, they work well too. I also have preserved Rainbow Shiners in large packages. Both are ""Border Friendly""."
