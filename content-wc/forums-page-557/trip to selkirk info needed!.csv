1142623,freespoolin,2009-10-16 21:03:00,472,Bring a large bottle of humility. The Red can be hot one day and cold the next. Be prepared to anchor and dead stick and troll crankbaits. Be prepared to try both north and south of Selkirk Park. You can stay in Selkirk and fish both the Red and Pine Falls or vice-versa. Or stay in between at Southbeach Casino and fish both Red and Winnipeg Rivers. There are maps of the Red posted on www.manitobaanglers.com

Salted Fatheads, Salted Shiners, Gulp minnows, all appear to work in turn."
1142733,fishncamp,2009-10-17 18:38:00,49,South Beach Casino is a nice place and a good choice for accomadation.....it is located between Selkirk and Pine Falls so you have a couple options for fall walleyes
1142736,fishncamp,2009-10-17 18:46:00,49,Some good hunting options nearby too.
1142745,Backwater Eddy,2009-10-17 19:39:00,3871,"I prefer to stay at ""Cats on the Red"" and have done so for many, many years now. The spring flooding did raise some havoc on the lodge but it is back up an operational again and will be even better when all planned renovations are completed. They also have a new American Plan if the guests wish to participate in it a gourmet cook comes in, her vi-tills are exceptional!Stu and the gang will keep guests well tuned in to the areas that are on the bite. What I also like is the other fellow guests tend to pitch in and it becomes a team effort and everyone get on fish. Stu has well over 30 years of on the water experience on the Red and the associated river and lake systems, so he's Da-Man as far as I'm concerned. And his guides are top notch if that is a option guests prefere over going it alone.As was mentioned, there are other options in the area too, but my pick is always ""Cats on the Red""."
1142771,fishncamp,2009-10-17 22:20:00,49,Stu knows the river and always helps you find the fish. Best to go during the weekdays too as the launches can get rather busy on weekends.
