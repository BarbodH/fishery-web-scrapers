1140652,trackerman,2009-10-07 11:01:00,20,Does anyone know when they draw down the Red River? Planning trip and would like to avoid any scheduled draw down of the river. Also has the river turned muddy from the recent rains?
1140674,freespoolin,2009-10-07 12:12:00,472,Drawdown starts Oct. 14.
1140686,trackerman,2009-10-07 13:08:00,20,How long does the draw down last? How long does this effect the fishing? Do you think the fishing will rebound by October 21 or 23. Planning trip around this time. Any info is greatly appreciated.
1140754,Bandit,2009-10-07 18:57:00,140,2 or 3 days if they open the locks on Oct 14 ( Estimated date ) ? You should be fine for Oct 21-23 if not Pinefalls 40 mins up the road will producing.
1140789,Backwater Eddy,2009-10-08 01:54:00,3871,"Water is up some here in the South on the Headwaters and Central Red River Basin and a bit muddy due to heavy rains. Yet the joint effect of the ""Drawdown"" and the rains should clear by then. Once the rains stop that is. A tip is by watching the USGS REAL TIME river levels at Grand Forks and Pembina real time river level gauge sites, it helps to determine the rainfall effects about 1-2 days ahead of the St. Andrews Dam, more or less.http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nd/nwis/rthttp://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?05092000Colder water clears faster than warm water, so as the water temps fall clarity improved more quickly. The water temps are falling nicely on the Red.Thanks for the confirmation on the date for the start of the St. Andrews Dam Drawdown guys. I dug this up too if it helps.Public Works and Government Services Canada Oct 08, 2008 11:07 ETSt. Andrews Lock and Dam, Lockport, Manitoba: Closing Date for 2008 Navigation Season WINNIPEG, MANITOBA--(Marketwire - Oct. 8, 2008) - St. Andrews Lock and Dam will be closed to marine vessels at midnight Tuesday, October 14, 2008, for the season.

From this date, water levels of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, in the vicinity of the City of Winnipeg and north to Lockport, will be lowered gradually over a two week period as the dam is removed. Should winter conditions set in, the dam will be completely removed as required.Owners of vessels, barges and all property on the Red and Assiniboine Rivers and their tributaries are hereby notified to protect their property.The gated areas below the dam, used for shore fishing, may be closed due to high turbulent waters and dangerous currents, inclement weather or operational requirements. Once closed, these areas will remain closed until spring 2009."

1142316,KEEBOY,2009-10-15 11:21:00,61,"We just got back from the Red River Tuesday. Fished Sat, Sun and Mon. Started off around the x35 marker and did some trolling only picked up 1 24"" walleye and lots of sauger. Finished the day jigging at the airport north of Sugar Island and caught 3 walleye one of which was 29""Sunday went north to Netly Creek and did some trolling but it didn't seem like the fish were interested in crankbaits. Jigged with chartruese with berkley gulp spray in garlic flavor seemed to work well. Caught good number of fish from 18"" up to 30""Monday went back to the same location and jigged all day. Caught similar number of walleye with 2 big fish. One 28"" and one just over 30"" again on chartrues jigs. Must have seen 12-15 big fish (28""+) caught in other boats throughout the day in this area.Good luck to you."
