They caught an average of 3 fish per day and even the guided boats were coming back with small northern as the catch of the day, and taking pictures on the dock of the days catch. Now maybe it was just a bad week, weather, etc. But he said his best fishing was at night off the dock, do what you want, but I can drowned minnows and nightcrawlers at home."

Yes pipestone can be the dead sea sometimes. but it has a ton of walleye, trout, muskie, bass, (largies and smallies) and northerns. Three of my buddies have guided up there and when the fish are on its unreal. I think it might have to do with the gin clear water. A 61"" muskie was caught up there earlier this year. the last time I went up there all I caught was five pound walleyes."
