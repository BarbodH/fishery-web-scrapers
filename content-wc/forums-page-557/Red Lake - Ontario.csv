1141994,maverick,2009-10-13 19:30:00,24,"A group of my friends and I go on an annual trip to the east side of Lac Seul and we have had very good luck over the years. In addition to Lac Seul; I own a cabin near Morson on LOTW, so I have experienced fishing there a lot too. Well....this year we are considering a trip to Red Lake but I do not know much about it. We fish walleye pretty much exclusively but will take Smallies if they come. We like good numbers (we have many days on Lac Seul where we get 100 eyes per boat/day), but we also like to catch quality fish. We are looking at going up to Red Lake sometime in the first half of June as I hear that is when the jig/minnow bite is the hottest. My question is for those of you who have fished (or do fish) Red Lake. What is the quality of the fishing in this lake as far as numbers and size? Have you ever fished the other two fisheries mentioned? If so, how does Red Lake compare? Did I miss anything that is worth mentioning??? Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you, Jim"
1142339,steve03,2009-10-15 12:27:00,22,Hey I do not know if this helps but we have been going to Nungesser Lake which is only about 40 miles north of Red Lake and the fishing has been great for numbers and size for walleye. The pike are not to be overlooked either with many going over forty. We go late June/early July. I believe you should look into it but if you are already sold on Red Lake that is ok.
1142483,tparker,2009-10-16 06:53:00,100,I second the vote for Nungesser Lake. Have gone to Birch Point Camp the last two years and couldn't have been happier with both size and numbers. This year the weather could have been better...maybe next year. Tim
1142506,AllenW,2009-10-16 08:31:00,11482,"I've fished Red for many many years and there are huge fish in that lake, also access by water to gullrock which is also noted for big walleyes, also a few other lakes and the chukuni river, another good place to get walleyes and northerns.Don't fish bass so can't help ya there.One thing, as in all big bodies of water, find a few spots to fish first, you can spend a lot of time wandering around Red looking for fish, find a section (bait stores, resort owners can help) and fish it thoroughly before moving on...imhoAl"
1142529,maverick,2009-10-16 10:27:00,24,"Thanks for the advice Allen... The reason we are considering Red Lake is that we found a really good deal on a cabin from a private party. He tells me that it is in the NW area of the lake near Post Narrows. I have yet to find a lake map online, other than Google maps and they do not show names of bays ore anything. Keep the info coming folks... Thanks, Jim"
1142540,AllenW,2009-10-16 10:58:00,11482,"If the good deal doesn't pan out....Haven't stayed there, but I have a freind who has a place on Mckenzie island and he reccomends Island Vacation Retreat, I think they're online if I remember right.We're gonna stay there next Sept when I finnaly get back to Red again.Either way, have fun.al"
1142554,stevensinks,2009-10-16 12:22:00,330,"I have been to red lake the past 2 years. In 08 I went with 3 other guys the first week of June. It was cold and wet. We wernt putting a hundred fish a day in the boat. But we landed plenty of fish and I would say that at least 80% were 25 inches or larger. We were the only first timers at the camp, some had been going there for 25 years. They all told us that the fishing was very slow due to the weather and that the norm was to catch way more fish. In 09 my wife and I went the last week of July. We all know about this years weather. One afternoon with out rain gear. Agine we had a hard time catching eyes to eat, everything was to big. In fact it was our 3rd day before I found a cove full of eating size fish. We didnt fish real hard and I would guess that the 2 of us averaged 20-25 fish a day. I have been to lakes were we caught more fish, I have never been to a lake were we caught as many big fish. My wife and I are planning on going back in 2010 and hope for good weather. I have also given Nungesser some thought for the pike fishing."
1142779,the Sandman,2009-10-17 23:34:00,13,"Red Lake is the only place I have ever been in Canada, so can't speak for any other place. It is a huge lake, but like StevenSinks told you, catching eater size fish can be a challange. Most of our fish the last couple of years have averaged 22-24 inches. We fish some portage lakes to catch eaters, but Red Lake has exceptional trophy potential. Biggest in our group ever is 9-9 and was caught the first week of June. Like all lakes, it takes some time to find the hot spots, but with some walleye catching experience, I am sure you would do fine."
1143666,AllenW,2009-10-22 06:42:00,11482,"We generally fish shallower for eaters and deeper for larger fish.Can't say for summer fishing, but don't see why it wouldn't work, Sept is when we go and 30-35 foot for big fish, under 15 for smaller ones, maybe try that next time.Maybe try smaller bait too?Al"
1143670,PRD1,2009-10-22 07:05:00,458,"Maverick, You might take a look at this map resource provided by Naural Resources Canada,http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/topo/map Just click on the area of interest and keep zooming in, it contains all of the detail of a topographic map. Set the map size (button on top) to large or extra large to get the most on your screen and you can just print it off if you want to keep it. Paul"
