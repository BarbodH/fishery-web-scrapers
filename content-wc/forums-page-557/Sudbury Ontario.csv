1144678,rapp,2009-10-27 11:25:00,48,Unfortunately not. I drive to all my fishing spot. There are very few lakes you have to fly in. In the winter month you can snowmobile to any lake. There are so many good lakes most fisherman don't spend the extra for the trophy lakes. I catch 4 to 8 pound walleye on the lake I live on but you have work for them. Depending on the species Ramsey lake (walleye) you can catch your limit in a few hrs have a shore lunch and go again problem only 2 to 5 pound. Frechette lake (pike) you can catch and release 60 a day you may catch a 10 to 15 lbs most are 2 to 6 lbs If you need info on sudbury aviation let me know the specific and I can call them or foward you the telephone number.
