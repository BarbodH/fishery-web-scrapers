Looking forward to next year, and hope to bring up a few more teams from our area. Wanted to take a moment to thank Laurant for a very well run tournament, hard working volunteers, and of course the staff at the motel (papertown inn). Renewed a lot of old friendships, met a lot of good people (Congratulations Roger and Susan!), even met another WCer Mr. Tony Shirley..man is his Ranger fast..(or at least when he gets on the river).. Steve"

1143118,demasterangler,2009-10-19 19:22:00,196,Just checking to see if I got it right .....8 fish entered and total weight 30 ish pounds ... I havent fished there for 25 years but there were monsters there ...my best 14 plus .... Are there still fish like that there ...
1143161,Burr,2009-10-19 23:36:00,8612,"There were quite a few over 10 weighed in the tournament, but nothing over 11. Each year is a learning experience. This year it doesn't appear the 11, 12, and 13 lb fish are too plentiful. The greenbacks we caught were mostly males, long skinny fish. The fat football fish weren't greenbacks. Maybe there is a baitfish issue out on the big lake this year, maybe the females aren't in yet?? But the greenbacks seemed thin to me.We had a 21.5"" fish that weighed less than either of 2, 20"" fish, a 27 that weighed less than 8. Usually they are a bit heavier than that. We ended up with 28.15 lbs, 8 fish. Winning weight was @ 37 lbs. One of our 8 was a half lb fish. Another 6 lb fish would have been a 5.5 lb upgrade, and we caught 9 fish during the tournament in that weight category The east wind on Sunday was brutal to our program, and I wasn't going to fish a program (tailpipe) we hadn't touched during prefishing.Like Reno said, it's always good to see the people of Pine Falls in October. There were quite a few missing this year. Had a bunch of fun with Tony and his crew. Tony's putt-putt motor-boat gets with it pretty good. I think we may have made a couple nervous when we scooted down the river. lol, it was fun anyway."
1143263,Guest,2009-10-20 12:32:00,0,Was nice meeting you Steve and Barry. We were in the room across from you having the fish fry Saturday evening. I see you guys placed 13th. Not bad! You had a good Saturday at least. It was still slow for us on Sunday but we managed a couple 24's.
1143365,mrwalleye5,2009-10-20 20:18:00,1922,"I agree with Burr, there may be a forage problem. I found the greenbacks that I caught the last few times I have been at Pine Falls have not been the footballs that I've become used to over the last few years. Hopefully this is a probelm that will correct itself next year if we get normal weather and heat patterns. W5"
1143384,Bandit,2009-10-20 22:58:00,140,"I have fished this system over 30 years & the last 3 year has been the best ever. Look at all the the nice fish taken over the last 3 years Ice fishing the South Basin? This year's high water level has played havic on forage locations. South basin has 3 strong fish class's 15""-16"", 20""-22"" & 24""-26"". Plus record breaking temperatures in the month of September slowed fish movement down? Fish in the North Basin are more healthy feeding on Rainbow Smelt. My co-worker claim while visiting his brother in the North Basin ( 3 weeks ago ) they caught many 24""-30"" fish? Some believe that the Rainbow Smelt are keeping the larger fish in the North Basin?"
