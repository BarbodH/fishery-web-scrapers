While fishing Obabikon Lake this fall for crappie, one of my friends caught a small bluegill. It has been many years since I have caught/seen any, and that was in Turtle Lake, when they apparently were spawning, or had just gotten finished. I am just wondering whether anyone else has had any catches on them in LOW. Bill Krejca"

Thats the only place I know of. I have never even had an incidental catch any where else in 38 years that I can recall. On another note how was your crappie fishing this year ? We did ok in Obabikon but had to sort many fish to get size I like to clean, And also had to fish 16ft and under as shallow as 10 ft. I was up 8th of oct but came home early bacause of inclimate weather. Only fished a short day out west by Rubber Island for Walleye with marginal results. Jon"

Someone in the boat caught a bluegill in the midst, so I assumed the beds were of bluegill creation. Never did get a large one, although I have spent a lot of time in Turtle (and also in Alfred's). In an earlier post, I shared my mid-September trip crappie results. In Sabaskong/Stevens, they just weren't congregated yet in the deep water. Several trips to Obabikon resulted in some nice fish, 13-1/2"" being the largest, but many 11-1/2 - 12"". Most fish were taken in 8-15 feet of water. Water temp when we left was 71 degrees, way too warm for the time of year. We did get some fairly nice ones in Stevens the last day, somewhat shallower, in the shade, off a steep rock.
