My wife and I just returned from a moose hunt/ fishing trip. the walleyes were biting well on jigs either pink or yellow even glow tipped with a salty,twister, or gulp, like i say they are not fussy! most fish hovered slightly above or below the 18 inch mark great color and healthy fish."

The only other place we did really well was right across from camp on the south side of the big island along the sand bars trolling rattle tots in the evenings till dark. The guys next to us fished the islands NE of camp and did OK. I am sure we could have figured more out about the lake - if we went back a second time but it wasn't for us. This was our first trip where we weren't the only cabin or even the only lodge on the lake. all in all it was a great trip - just different than what we were used to and a little more fishing pressure than we are used to I am sure you will have a great trip, what time of year are you going?"
1142808,deputy dog,2009-10-18 07:27:00,305,"we are goin july 10-17. while we enjoy catchin and eatin the 'eyes we are really after big-40"" and up-northerns. did you have any luck with pike? their, elliots, reputation and accommodations are really what steered us to their camps. we have always gone to one cabin per lake fly-ins but was ready for a change. we looked at their outposts but everyone said the big pike were on the big water-whitewater and ogoki so we booked there. thanks for the tips first time on a lake can be tough and we'll take all the info we can get!"
1142809,deputy dog,2009-10-18 07:28:00,305,"btw, did you see any groups from the other outfitters on the lake or only guys from mattice? thanks again"
1143039,lobo1,2009-10-19 12:13:00,734,"we worked for big pike as you will too. we only saw a couple 39 and 40"". I came to understand that this lake shines near the opener for the big girls and again in the fall, as most places do. I would plan on trying to fish deeper. spend some time this winter and mark up your maps with areas you think look good and when you get there see if there is a feeding shelf adjacent to some deep water and try trolling the deeper edges, IF you can establish a trolling run..... or maybe work the edges of some nice cabbage that are near deep water with the traditional spoons etc but try to get on it early/late as opposed to midday. there is a lot of water here and covering it with a small motor is a challenge - i would suggest having 5-6 places to fish lined up all in the same quadrant of the lake for each boat and then all meet up midday for lunch and compare notes and adjust. we only saw boats from another camp when we were at the north end on the west side of caribou island - these guys had some high end boats with 150-200 horse motors on them. i am not sure if it is available but if i were going for a week again i would try to find a guide for the first day. split the cost among your group and it wont cost much and then draw straws to see who gets to go with the guide........mark up your hand held GPS and then the whole group can pound these spots for the next 6 days. lobo1"
1143079,deputy dog,2009-10-19 16:14:00,305,"we are definitely going to get a guide the first day we are there, figured this would ""speed up"" our success for the week. do you by any chance remember what the rates were? usually $100 per day i think but well worth it to put us on some fish and learn what structure they seem to prefer. we picked july for going as our old lake seemed to hold the bigger, 40andup, in the lily pads. they really seemed to be up during this time of the year. our old lake and this lake are roughly the same distance north so we figured the pads should be up at the same time of the year. really looking forwrd to don and annette's hospitality as it seems everyone speaks so highly of them and the operation they run. but a little nervous about the prospect of starting over on a new lake, especially with my 70 year old uncle and 67 year old dad but it was time for a change. thanks again for the info you provided!"
