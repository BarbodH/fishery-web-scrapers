All have been caught on jigs and salted minnows in 19' to 20' of water...... Been one of my best years on the Red for both numbers and sizes...... Can only think it is going to get BETTER as the weather and water cools down.....Good luck to any and all .......this one went 29 7/8"".....(sorry, I don't weigh them....)http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...r/GEDC0023.jpgthis one went a full 31""......http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...r/GEDC0021.jpgTHESE ARE FROM SEPT 30th...... both 30"" or just over.....http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...w2sept3009.jpghttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...w1sept3009.jpg"
