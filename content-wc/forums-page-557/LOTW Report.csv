Caught a ton of walleye at the usual fall spots and good average size. Jigs and minnows in 18-22' on the flats outside the neck down areas with current. We didn't fish crappie but another group in camp caught well over 100 one day in Miles Bay that first weekend. Had a once in a lifetime experience while trolling for muskie. My brother's rod bent over and while he was bringing in his fish, I was steering boat away from rocks and my wife was fast reeling in her line to get it out of the way, another muskie slammed wife's lure. Two muskies on at the same time and me wondering how to land both of them. Got my brother's fish in the net and then decided to use the same net for my wife's fish while the first fish was still in net. Tight fit but it worked. Brother's was 41"" and wife's was 47"" and both very fat. Pics below.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...pictureid=3070https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...pictureid=3071 Also got my brother a nice 38"" northern while trolling.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...pictureid=3069 And this ambitious 19"" smallie hit a 10"" Jake while we were muskie trolling.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...pictureid=3072 Weather was perfect the first four days - temps in 40s, overcast and light wind. Got colder and windier later in the week and Friday night the wind howled so hard that it rattled the cabin windows and made our dog bark all night at the phantom intruder. We woke Saturday morning to a few inches of snow and wind still blowing hard from the west. Walleye tournament out of Morson was cancelled that day. Fortunately wind died down by Sunday morning when we crossed the lake to leave. Leaves were way behind schedule. Lots of green still up there due to the very mild Sept. I don't think they got a frost until last Friday night when it snowed. Another great trip."
