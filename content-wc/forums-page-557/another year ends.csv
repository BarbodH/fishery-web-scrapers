1141463,fishman10,2009-10-11 14:31:00,226,i will be pulling out the boat from abram in sioux lookout this week. i am working on the hospital project and had the opportunity to fish abram and minnitaki several times a week. the weather is getting cold and there is only 1.5 hours of light left after work. the bright side is i have 1 more year left to look forward to and was blessed with a great year in gods country.
