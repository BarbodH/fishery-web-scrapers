1130403,eyemike,2009-08-20 21:24:00,233,"Just returned from my first trip to Eagle Lake. I stayed at Stanley's West Arm Resort. I must say the resort was fabulous My wife and I booked a package and the resort upgraded the cabin to a 2 bedroom free. They also upgraded the boat from a 16ft. lund 25 hp to a 17.5 ft 40 hp free. For me the fishing on most days was tough to say the least it was quite humbling. People that were in camp that have fished Eagle for years (most of the people staying there) did fairly well. We had several severe storms on different days and 2 days that it got really hot. We did have several days of good fishing. a lot of our walleyes were in the 21 to 25 range with the largest being 25"". We caught some nice pike up to 35"". My only complaint is not knowing the lake better. fishinnut 3446 really helped with some locations. Most people in camp were catching eyes in 25 to 30 ft. using lindys or jigs. I got most of mine in the weeds 12 to 16ft using little joe spinners on a lindy. Just being in Canada for a week made the trip successful...Mike"

Robert and Chantal run a great resort and will do their utmost to make your stay a great one. (and I don't even stay there) but talking to the folks who stay there I've heard this first hand.I stay at the private camp next door to the tourist camp so I see all the action on the docks there."

1130834,fishinnut 3446,2009-08-23 09:31:00,638,"Hope some of the info helped Mike,It is a huge lake so I think it's wise to get a guide the first day or two then you will be on some fish,and other people in camp always help,I just think it's been 1 of those years of crappy fishing even here in Wi. hot,cold,hot,cold,but what do you do,looking forward to Bear hunting!(And yes I will go back to Eagle,so **** peaceful up there!) Jamie."
1130880,eyemike,2009-08-23 13:24:00,233,"Thanks for all your help Jamie. I made my biggest mistake by not getting a guide. I did get some real good information from some people in camp about where to fish. Hindsight being what it is, I would have got a guide first part of the week and greatly improved my odds. I did talk with a guide out on the water in Railroad Bay who said that the hot and cold weather was making it tough on fishing. I would go back to Eagle,I think it has much more fish catching potential than what I saw. Like I said just being in Canada is worth the trip. We did have several days of good fishing so I know the fish are there and I know there are big fish there... Mike"
1130901,Larry Mac,2009-08-23 15:16:00,530,"Hi Eyemike, Well stated. We were up in Canada the first week of August at our regular camp that we have fished for many years and had a challenging time locating our walleyes and we knew the water. They were all over. We dealt with the most challenging weather we have ever experienced in August. All in all we had a great time and would never trade the experience good or tough fishing with anything. We have never fished Eagle Lake but have heard it is a good fishery. Hopefully you and yours will have many more trips in the future.Thank you,Larry Mac"

1141337,squirt,2009-10-10 19:09:00,3,"JigWhere are you located in Wisconsin? If you wanna give Eagle another shot, I've been fishing it for over 16 years. I'd be glad to personally show you some good fishing. It took me a while to learn to pattern the fish on that lake, but once you realize the patterns, it's not that hard. Does take a while though. If you ever want to give it another shot, I guarantee you won't be disappointed.Squirt"
