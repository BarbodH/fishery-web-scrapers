My best friend and i are headin up to Lac Seul Evergreen Lodge near Ear Falls, ON, goin to be there on Sept 2 through Sept 9th, was wondering if any of you had been there and how it was. www.lacseulwalleye.com is there website, i think they are fairly close to Golden Eagle Lodge Also any advice on fishing there this time of year, wondering if the fall turnover has started, or is already done yet? have a good day all."

Nice cabins, and Lac Seul has great fishing. I was up there the week of a little cold front. I would consider the fishing below average, and we were pulling about 75 to 80 fish in the boat in a day. Prior years there we had the 100+++ fish days. E-mail me and I will give you a few spots. I would suggest getting a guide for at least the first day. I do it on all of my trips. It helps me settle into the pattern for that year, and I go from there. Ask Patty or Gary for a guide, and they have a few that will put you on fish."

SILVER WATER WHEEL LODGE FISHING REPORT Aug. 19, 2005 Fall arrives quickly up here and it blasted in this week with cool temps and solid winds. The lake surface temps have already dropped to the mid 60s. The weed beds are breaking off and dying and almost all major walleye action has been in and around the main lake basin. In the past we have had a slow down in mid August for mid sized walleyes. This year has been a bit different. The 22-26's are being caught at the normal pace, but we have slowed down a bit for top end fish. For the week there were 67 walleyes over 27 in. caught and released, including 11-28s, 1-29, and 2-30s. Volume was again very strong. The average # of walleyes over 18 in. reported per boat per day was 45. The highest daily total for the week was 85. We keep checking the bottom bouncer/spinner bite, but it just isn't producing up to par with jigs. Depending on depth and wind, the guides have been switching between 3/8 and ½ oz jigs. We really haven't been doing much with the ¾ oz jigs. Some guides have been using tails, some not, but all are using minnows as primary bait. The bite has been split even between rock and sand and the most productive depths have been 20-30 ft. The fire ban has been lifted (I think you would have trouble catching the bush on fire with a can of gas this week.). The summer has once again flown by. We have some guides heading back to school at the end of this next week. It won't be long before I am on my way to start my Fall deer guiding season. The lodge will remain open with cabins fully booked until the end of Sept., but the season is beginning to wind down."
