551817,Guest,2005-08-28 18:48:00,0,Hi Jimmy Legs. I am coming up next week and I am wondering if you know any good spots on Gullrock or any spot on the chain. I could sure use the help and I know you got some good ones. I hopr to meet you when I am there. Cheers Clark
551821,Guest,2005-08-28 23:00:00,0,"Clark, As a matter of fact I have some dandy spots on Gullrock Lake and other lakes close by. I heard that your back is still sore from reeling in big ones on one of my spots on Red Lake. I'm sure I'll probably bump into you once or twice (no pun intended), when you're up here. For a substantial fee (namely Kokanee and Crystal), I'd be happy to show you a spot or two. I guarantee you won't find a more dedicated guide. Who else do you know that's willing to get wet just to spot fish for you? You won't need a fishfinder!"

I have only fished this lake in June, does anyone have any recent reports of fishing / experience during this time of the year. Any help on patterns/depths/presentations etc.. would be very helpful. thanks in advance[email protected]"
551670,sifty,2005-08-22 08:12:00,46,I have been going up to Gullrock for about five years now. Lindys with a worm in 15 to 20 ft of water has always worked for me. Best fishing was found by Marker Island and three sisters. hope that helps alittle.
551720,grt1,2005-08-23 16:06:00,259,"Yesterday they walleye were all over and in 25 to 28 feet for most of them the odd ones were in 30+. Minnows on a spinner or jig, lots of eaters haven't heard of any BIG ones being caught recently, some in the 23-24 inch range."
551721,Guest,2005-08-23 16:29:00,0,"Grt1, could you please enlighten me on where you live on Gullrock?"

551767,tlars,2005-08-25 10:53:00,137,"Hey, bconn. Only 26 days for me until the next Ontario fishing trip. Refresh my memory, how long do you have to wait to go again? Gotcha!!!!!"
551796,Guest,2005-08-26 20:35:00,0,"Just returned from gullrock last week, Aug. 14 through Aug. 20. Caught fish almost every place the wind was blowing in. Mostly drifting with jig and minnow. Backtrolling into the wind with jig and minnow also worked very well when the wind was to strong for drifting. Crawlers also worked well. Mostly fished the sunken humps and windy points. Stayed at Wrights Wilderness Camp. Lee and his wife Stephanie were very good hosts. Had a great time, can't wait to go back next year. atm1"
551803,Guest,2005-08-27 22:58:00,0,does the grt1 stand for great one or gullrock tackle? Are you going to let your boy beat you again this year's tournament?Make sure to leave a few cold ones in the fridge for pre-fishing.
