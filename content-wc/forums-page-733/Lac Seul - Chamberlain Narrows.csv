If I were going to that area in September I would start fishing the area Southwest of the Narrows. We found some deeper water in that area and a good late summer pattern dictates that the fish will be a little deeper. I would be looking for 20' to 25'++++ water that is on the edge of drops. I would use Bottom Bouncers with a Minnow on a spinner or 3/4 oz to 1 oz jigs. Chamberlin Narrows is a great area to catch fish in and Im sure that the Lodge staff will do what ever they can to put you on fish. You might ask them if Scaler Lake is still producing fish. It was a good spot when we were there and has some good areas with deeper water. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
