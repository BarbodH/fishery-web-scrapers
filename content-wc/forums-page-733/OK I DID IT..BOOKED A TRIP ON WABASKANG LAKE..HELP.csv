Check in isn't until 2pm so if you stay in Dryden, you'll have alot of time to kill that morning. Although, we got there early one year and the old owner let us take a boat and fish until check in. We usually pick up groceries in Dryden and bait in Vermillion Bay (leeches and ciscoes). I think Tall Pines provides minnows. As far as tackle, we usually do the normal stuff - jigs and lindy rigs. Get with trailer guy before you go. He always has the scoop on Wabby. Good luck - Stu"
551729,Guest,2005-08-23 21:39:00,0,"Cross the border that evening and stay in Fort Francis so you don't have to mess with crossing with the ""hordes"" Saturday morning. Going pretty early in the season so there won't be a lot of weeds up yet. If early spring and weeds are up and out to at least 6-8 feet...troll the outside edge of the weeds with Lindy rigs, floating jigheads tipped with minnows or if the weather is warm...crank baits. You'll get nipped off quite a bit from northerns on the Lindys but will pick up bonus pike and smallies with the cranks. Early am and late pm fish the narrows with slip bobbers, colored hooks, split shots and minnows. If the reeds are up and you see/hear fish chasing minnows...throw floating raps in and work them out slowly for smallies. If your up for a 30 minutes ride...head back past Lundy's into Gawleys Bay...fish the island at the entrance for smallies and pike and the ""trough"" that runs from the backside of the island all the way into the back of the bay. The narrows on the northwest side of Gawleys is know as the ""hotel"" as the 'eyes check in there in the evening. Lot's of lake to fish and so little time, Have fun above all! Craig"

You can relax, grocery shop, and head to Tall Pines. Big IGA and a Safeway there in Dryden. One thing I noticed when I started going to Canada was that the hooks used for walleyes were much larger (for obvious reasons) than the hooks I used when I was fishing in Wisconsin. If you are tying your own spinners, take note of this. If you want to buy spinners, then buy them in Vermillion Bay, not in the states. Fish whatever way you are comfortable. This year on Lac Seul, the guys in the guide boat used jigs because the guide liked jigs. IN my boat we used spinners, and both boats caught fish about equal. We used mostly minnows but also caught fish when we used crawlers. Leaches were in short supply up north this year."
