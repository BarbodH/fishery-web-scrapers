551780,Superdad,2005-08-26 06:55:00,64,"Yes, buying a boat in the US and bringing it back is easy as pie. The first reply was to contact Customs and FIND out about the Export to Import paper req'd from US CUstoms. I didn't have one, BUT the border guy cut me a break as I had talked to that office twice and the US Custom paper was NEVER mentioned. Over that hurdle, I paid GST and PST on the value of the boat and GST on the trailer, Plus $185.00 for Transport Canada for road taxes ???. I rec'd a letter a couple weeks later to take the trailer to any Cdn Tire for an inspection and they faxed the results to Transport Canada, that was easy. Registering my old trailer to the new trailer took some effort. Ontario Transport want the title of the trailer, sound easy right? Well, in Ohio trailers under 4000 lbs don't require a title, it took two months of phone calls and faxes with Ohio BMV and MOT, BUT finally I got the right person in Ohio who was able to fax proof to Ontario that the trailer had been registered ( a letter with the proper letterhead) and another $58.00 and the trailer was properly registered. I could have just paid for a new plate, but why have two plates? All in all, it was an easy exercise and I sure saved a pile of $$$, buying in US.
