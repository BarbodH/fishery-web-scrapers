What's the best method on these lakes to bring them in. What areas should we target? What time of Day, bait, depth etc. We've never targeted them before and thought it might be fun to try and bring some in...any info and help is appreciated. Will our walleye gear work or should we bring some lighter stuff? Thanks!"

Don't know if this is still the case. We used the same gear as we did for walleye, just smaller minnows. Try to find the weed edges sand and small rocks."
551425,grt1,2005-08-13 15:56:00,259,the white worms are just more protein anyway. but if you don't want to eat them hold the fillet up to the light and you can see them and dig them out with your fillet knife.
