I fish barbless and if I don't horse the smallmouth, I lose some, which is OK. The 19 inch smallmouth was also caught in the Flat Rapids. Pike in the 20-30 inch range were caught, but not large numbers. A few walleye, the largest was 26 inches, were caught trolling Reef Runners and wiggle warts (and #11 Rapala shallow running minnow) over 60-80 feet of water, mainly below the flat rapids. Some walleye were taken shallow in the weeds in 10-12 FOW with tubes and Long 15A Bombers. The largest smallmouth was 20 inches by another in our group on a Zara Spook. We had great fishing down the Bad French at the island and rock complexes past Crombie Bay for smallmouth. During the week, a mid 30 inch muskie was boated, and at mid 40 inch muskie or pike took a Zara Spook and came out of the water, biting off the spiderwire and tossing the lure. Weather was great. Overall a great time. Don"
