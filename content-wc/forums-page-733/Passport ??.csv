551763,fishinnut,2005-08-25 09:38:00,642,It's a good idea for Homeland Security but $95 for a passport is a little steep.
551765,Hammerhead Herb,2005-08-25 10:15:00,259,"Was that young woman in Ft. Frances? My outfitter said that there is one that has been giving his clients a lot of static. I have never had a problem crossing either way a number of times per year since 1991, but I think she is new. As some of the posts say: be polite, have all of your passengers identification in one package, have a list of the tobacco products and alcohol prepared to hand it to the agent, etc. You have a lot more luck if you look like you got your 'scheiss' (German word) together. Coming back into the US (IF, MN), we've always been treated courteously. I had a closed trailer with all of our fishing stuff in it and the US agents had us go through the xray/bomb sniffer/ radiation detector/'?' shed. Didn't even have to open up the small 10' trailer. One item to be aware of is that, even though Canadian border agents want to see a birth certificate (or passport), US agents won't use the birth certificate; they want a government issued picture ID (drivers license/passport). The agent I dealt with at IF, MN said that our physical appearance has changed considerably since the birth certificate was issued (makes sense). Having worked in civilian and military nuclear power for over 30 years, I am used to a heightened need for security and am happy to oblige with whatever those folks (US and Canadian) want to do."
551576,TKCENTERLINE,2005-08-18 08:42:00,24,"We are leaving this weekend and crossing the boarder at International Falls, MN. I was just told that I need a passport to cross the boarder. Is that true?? We never needed a passport before. All we need was our B-Day Cert. Is needing a passport a new change. What else has changed??"
551577,Todd_NE,2005-08-18 08:54:00,1330,"You don't HAVE to have one but bring it if you do to be safe. Personally, I've carried my driver's license, birth certificate and passport and never been asked for anything but a driver's license in 25 border crossings. The passport issue is coming in 2007/8?? for coming BACK to the US. Bottomline, be polite, KNOW your booze and smoke count, have your licenses out, roll down your windows, and turn off you ignition. It's not the time to joke either. I've had more trouble getting back into the US, untarping boats, surly agents, etc. I know they are just doing their job and I imagine it can be stressful at times so just stay cool and polite. Todd 20"" is good. 30"" is better. ""Me First"" Irrigators + Barge Industry + Bought Politicians = Bad Fishing"
551616,grt1,2005-08-19 04:56:00,259,You can thank your Homeland Security department for this wrinkle.
551617,Guest,2005-08-19 06:07:00,0,Just trying to get a handle on things.
551618,Guest,2005-08-19 07:33:00,0,Thanks Homeland Security glad you on the job.
551650,Rich J,2005-08-20 20:11:00,65,"TK We just came back and all they asked for was a DL. This was also true in May and July. A birth certificate can also be asked for but I have never had a problem or been asked for more than a DL. In May and last week they also asked for ID crossing into Canada, all they wanted was a DL. Rich J"
551674,Guest,2005-08-22 10:31:00,0,Last 3 trips they asked for dl and birth cert. or passport.I had my passport and the gal told the other guys she could turn them around if she wanted to.I gave her mine and she really didnt look at it.She was more concerned about not letting us go in.I have never had a problem crossing the border 40+ times unless a young woman was working.Never been asked for more than DL crossing back into the USA although we did get tore down right after 9/11. I would just get a passport to make things easier.
551701,Guest,2005-08-23 06:16:00,0,"I believe that starting in December 2007 a passport will be required to enter Canada and to re-enter the US. Prices are supposed to increase for them in late 2006, I believe."
551750,haybaylarry,2005-08-24 21:32:00,55,The passport for canada coincides with the American passport requirement. Same timeframe is what is being proposed at this time....larry
551761,iamwalleye1,2005-08-25 09:13:00,1589,I would make sure you have a copy of you birth certificate. You also need a photo ID. I always give them my passport when I pull up. From what I was told you will need a passport to enter back into the great USA next year 2006! I just pull up TAKE OFF SUNGLASSES if you have them on Roll down you window so they can see into the back and be very polite to them know what you are bring into the country and how long you are staying and WHERE! You have to remember these are the people that are keeping the BAD ones OUT OF our Country! Bill
