551489,Guest,2005-08-15 19:42:00,0,MMMMMMMMM! Seelman better try some!
551693,Guest,2005-08-22 17:20:00,0,"Yup. Sleeman's gets my vote too. SMOOOOOOOOTH. A buddy and I polished off about 8 or 9 each one night sitting on the porch of the fishing camp we were at. It was still 94 degrees at 10 p.m. and the beer was cold!!! We were pretty ""SMOOTH"" too on our walk back to the cabin. :-)"
551699,Guest,2005-08-23 02:28:00,0,Tried that Kokanee on recommendation of this board and gotta say I was quite disapointed. $38 US per case and had a bitter after taste. Definitely would not recommend it to anyone else. I still have 6 left.
551746,Guest,2005-08-24 19:54:00,0,COLD CRYSTAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
551749,Guest,2005-08-24 21:29:00,0,afte our good beer ran out we had some northern beer and since it tasted so bad we used it to was the scum off the side of the boat. We wee also lucky enough to find a sucker that would let us trade him 2 cases of canadian beer for a case of american beer. Boy is he gonna be mad when he tastes it.

551255,Guest,2005-08-09 08:36:00,0,"If you want to give you tastebuds something to savour try some Sleemans Honey Brown, YUM. Others that might suit your fancy, Big Rock Traditional or Grasshopper. Caution trying these may ruin your taste for all those mass marketed beers."
551260,Guest,2005-08-09 12:53:00,0,I don't remember my best Canadian beer experience. I'd guess it was a good one though.
551261,Guest,2005-08-09 13:53:00,0,"I tried Kokanee a few years ago, and loved it."
551284,Guest,2005-08-10 06:10:00,0,Fishing must be slow huh? ;)
551299,Guest,2005-08-10 09:36:00,0,"I have tried a number of the canadian beers...Molson Canadian, Blue, Moosehead, Labatt Black, etc....the two that are by far the best I have had are Kokenee and OV (Old Vienna)...I have not tried Crystal but have heard good things...Hope this helps"
551302,Guest,2005-08-10 10:17:00,0,"best experience? i don't know about best, but it was an experience! started out with O.V. then switched V.O., somehow ended up with v.d."
551364,Guest,2005-08-11 21:15:00,0,"Well to start off cold beer, your beer, and free beer are all good to me. I like the Seelman beers (if i spelled it right) the cream ale is good. I also had some beer from Nova Scotia Alexnder Keiths #### good. Most of it is $9.++ Can. Plus dep. Not sure of the US price and maybe good thing I don't."
551432,Guest,2005-08-14 06:51:00,0,Sleemans Creamy Pale Ale is my favorite as well.
551436,Guest,2005-08-14 11:04:00,0,"Try some Labatts Wildcat (on the strong side), it's nice change of pace once in awhile from Blue and Blue Light (the standards!)."
551444,Guest,2005-08-14 22:52:00,0,proud member of the wildcat club too....
551214,Guest,2005-08-07 20:25:00,0,"Someone else is asking what the rudest beer is. I do not know what that means... I want to hear from you experts what the best Canadian Beer that I have never heard of is. I have had and like Blue, and Molson, but what is out there from the smaller breweries that are great."
551217,jerry bark,2005-08-08 04:57:00,822,"that is an easy question: Unibroue La Fin du Monde Unibroue make a bunch of REALLY good belgian styled beers and this one KICKS BUTT. i have not seen it in the beer store where i go, but if you see it and the price does not scare you it is amazing, quite strong and not at all what you are expecting. Take a chance and buy it. have fun jerry"
551219,Frankm,2005-08-08 06:41:00,154,One I like alot is Kokanee. Very smooth.
551220,Guest,2005-08-08 06:42:00,0,MooseHead (unless it is skunky like the Moosehead you can buy in the U.S.).....also Kokanee is pretty good too. Moosehead is made by the oldest independent brewery in Canada.
551229,snaggletooth,2005-08-08 09:11:00,135,LaBatts black label. Strong stuff.
551233,Todd_NE,2005-08-08 09:54:00,1330,"Kokanee Todd ""Me First"" Irrigators + Barge Industry + Bought Politicians = Bad Fishing"
551237,woods,2005-08-08 12:07:00,646,"I've tried all the brands mentioned, and my best experience with them was chilling them down, opening the bottle, and drinking it!"
551242,srj,2005-08-08 14:25:00,971,"For the fastest ""grin""--Labatts Maximum Ice. Some whiskeys are weaker, plus it tastes kinda good. But for pure, sweet flavor--Dow Cream Porter closely followed by Labatts Cream Porter. Both are a bit sweet and actually taste better as they warm. Too bad, but neither has been available in Ontario for a good 10 years."
551246,Guest,2005-08-08 18:57:00,0,"Living in northwestern Ontario and being the beer connisiour that I am, i must agree with some of the other posts.Kokanee is bar none the best beer out there. Smooth and tasty. It's a little more money, but like most things, you get what you pay for. If you're in Ontario,try Crystal made by Labatt's. It's a close second, but you can only get it in Ontario."
551248,Fishoil,2005-08-08 21:17:00,1277,I'd vote for one of the imports....... maybe Bud Light? }( :cheers:
