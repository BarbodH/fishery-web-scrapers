Since everyone says the walleye fishing is not so good we will probably fish more for musky,northern and smallmouth. We will be renting a private cabin on Gunn Lake and would appreciate any help on where and what to try this time of year. I like to fish for Musky but would also love to catch and release a bunch of smallies to keep things interesting. Thanks in advance for any suggestions."
551734,Reels,2005-08-24 07:20:00,2876,"Take plenty of floating rapallas, husky jerks, tube baits or grubs. (I like Chompers from walmart)(blue and white, gold and black, and firetiger for hard baits) Cast rocky shorelines that you see basketball or smaller rocks and you will get a good hodge podge of everything and will be a lot of fun. Stop at Jacks bait and talk to Curtis, and he will help you find fish. If you talk to his sister, all you will get is a dumb look. <{{}}><"
551735,Guest,2005-08-24 07:30:00,0,Doc......if your looking for good size smallies your going to have to go a bit deeper. They tend to school more this time of year and follow the bait fish around. Look for drop offs in 10-15 feet of water and try jigging with live bait ( I like leeches). Early morning and late evening try pitching plastics up along the weed lines. Since your going to be on Gunn work that lake and the River South of minaki. The musky fishing has been great up there this year and with the water temps coming down they should be coming on pretty good.
551762,iamwalleye1,2005-08-25 09:32:00,1589,Try on the north end of big sand there is a spot called the rock pile you can't miss it. Just move up a little shallower to find the smallies! They should be just a foot or 2 from the walleyes If there are any still there!
551769,Guest,2005-08-25 11:49:00,0,"first week of September -- where to look for walleye? Big or Little Sand? 30-foot flats? deeper? shallower? any suggestions greatly appreciated. Where to look for musky at this time of year? Any left in the weedy bays, or main lake rocks a better bet? TIA, skunkd"
551772,iamwalleye1,2005-08-25 13:34:00,1589,Rocks For the skies. Walleyes any reef in big or little sand. ( burnt green around that area). Use big minnow and I mean big with a spinner there are 3 reef just off of green island . Also if you get a south wind try deadboys island and wiskey island and always cast duck reef!
