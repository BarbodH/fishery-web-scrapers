551757,JLWalleye,2005-08-25 07:55:00,49,Anyone with GOOD information about this lake? We are flying in to it in October for a hunt and this lake is available for fishing for Eyes and Northerns. Any past history of visits and spots would be appreciated. What baits will be good for this time of year for either species? Thanks John
