Have talked to a few guys who have been there in last 2 weeks and sounds like the fishing is pretty darn good. Any reports or tips would be great, but I think we will do fine, got a bunch of good fisherman going. Will report after returning from trip. Getting excited now and mind on Canada not work. Charlie (Stevensink) just got back from Red Lake and Had a great trip with his wife and caught more fish than ever. So sounds like cool weather has not affected the bite to much."
1992593,deadhead1,2013-07-30 09:49:00,193,I live at Kenora and can report walleye has been very good jigging in 27 to 30 ft. They seem to have finally moved out to the mid lake humps. With the late spring it has been a challenge.
1993137,Flip Silverlake,2013-07-30 13:10:00,645,"Challenging is an understatement. I've been here since the 11th of June and can count on one hand the number of 17 inch walleye I've caught. I have never seen the fishing this slow. Caught a nice mess on the 13th of June and that's when it stopped. Just to make sure everyone understands that I know what I'm doing, I've fished this area since 1962. I've heard every excuse in the book except now the locals are netting in the Sioux Narrows area. That should give you some idea. Things better change around here soon or there will be very little sport fishing in this area. I'm not the only one finding this situation."
1993145,joeman79,2013-07-30 13:15:00,417,Sounds Great and Sounds Terrible. Oh well we will have a great time regardless.

The good old reefs that we parked on in past years were COVERED with bait fish and the walleye were not in the mood for jig and minnow. In past years, this was our bread and butter method and took us about a day or so to figure out that something was different. Rather than chew the fat about it, we went hunting for new spots and used bottom bouncers with crawler harness and floating Rapalas to locate and zoom in on the active fish. After a couple of days, we had established many new areas. To our surprise the 22' to 28' foot reefs that used to produce very good numbers were not producing much and the more SHALLOW reefs at about 14' to 18' produced. Especially true on overcast and choppy days. We tended to loose quite a few rigs, but didn't care since the fishing was exceptional. There were 4 in our crew this year and and I caught the smallest ""big"" fish at 28"", the other 3 had 29 1/2"", 30 1/2"" and 31"".... We had several days with many big fish in mid to high 20's. We rarely fished more than 6 hours a day. In the process we racked up nice numbers of 18 to 21 inch fish, not big numbers but at least a couple dozen a day. The moving crawler rigs and cranks seem to trigger the larger fish. Comparing this with past years were we would hit a reef and pull off 60 fish in 3 or 4 hours, and MAYBE one would be over 20"".Quite a change, but a good change. The systems seems completely OVERLOADED with bait and the walleye population and size looks very healthy. We fished away from SN and out in the big lake past the smiley face. Its quite a ride out there, but really worth it.Good luck on your trip, take lots of crawlers and have fun!"
1993929,downriverbob,2013-07-30 18:47:00,880,A lot of it depends on where you are going to stay with the houseboat. Where are you getting your houseboat from. House do you like to fish for walleye ? I have fished the area (Whitefish Bay) which is directly west of Sioux Narrow for almost 20 years. If you will let me know the answer for the questions I will try to help you out. I don't fish walleye a lot when we are there but do catch some nice fish when I do target them. BOB
1994441,joeman79,2013-07-31 05:40:00,417,Thanks for the responses and I think we are going to head towards Yellowgirl but nothing is set on stone. Half the group are Musky Fishing more than Walleye. We are all good fisherman and think we can figure the Walleyes out. Just first time on that side of the lake for me. there looks to be alot of reefs and structure west of Yellowgirl in the bigger water. I will look at map and look for Smiley point or island what u said. lol. Thanks again will check back here till we cross the border. 12 more hrs of workin then the phone goes in glove box and no worries for 8 days!!
