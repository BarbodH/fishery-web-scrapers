1984290,2746,2013-07-26 14:34:00,3206,X3 on shore lunch!
1984442,55walleyes,2013-07-26 15:32:00,131,Another plug for Shore Lunch Cafe. First timer this year for lunch and came away impressed.
1985098,eyemike,2013-07-26 21:52:00,233,America's Best is where my wife and I stayed on the 4th of July. You better like a hard bed if you stay there. Very clean. Man those beds were hard though!
1985674,houndog,2013-07-27 09:56:00,365,"America's Best and Days Inn are both clean and have adequate parking for your boat. We've stayed at both and have been happy with our visits.The BORDER BAR, on 53, north of the motels and on the east side of the street has some of the best PIZZA around. It has a family area for eating and a nice bar if you in the mind for and adult beverage. It's where the locals go to enjoy pizza. Parking is tough unless you drop your trailer at the motel.Have Fun! Wish I was headed up again this year. Next year I MUST plan two trips as a trip in June leaves a man needing another fishing trip to look forward to."
1985794,Rich B,2013-07-27 10:54:00,1081,Clean rooms and good beds.....decent prices and good service.http://hilltopmotelifalls.com
1986578,Glenman12,2013-07-27 19:45:00,762,you sound like youre on our trip..we drive straight thru on the way up but on the way back we stop in INt Falls and stay at Americas Best...after checking in we drop the trailers and head to the Border Bar for beer and pizza..or is it pizza and beer?..next morning we walk across the lot for breakfast at the Moose and then we are on our way home..
1987210,houndog,2013-07-28 08:14:00,365,"I certainly wish I was on your trip! We work the trip just the opposite, Overnight in the Falls going up and straight through coming home!Try the Border Bar Pizza and you'll not think you're close to any wilderness! Beer and Pizza are synergistic. Both are better when enjoyed together!"
1992761,deadhead1,2013-07-30 10:31:00,193,"We have stayed at various motels and never had a bad one. there are some smaller, older places that are cheap but old rooms. Good enough for the money you pay. My wife and I had a bad experience at the Chocolate Moose so we will never eat there again. Both of our steaks tasted sour like they had been sitting out too long."
1982746,potatoefarmer,2013-07-26 06:32:00,6,"Headed north early Sept, Looking for good place to stay on the US side at or very near International Falls?"
1982946,Camoclad,2013-07-26 07:31:00,628,"We stayed at Hilltop Motel in Int Falls. It was a nice place, clean, friendly staff. It really felt like they appreciated us staying there. I would recommend them to anyone. We will stay there again next summer. http://hilltopmotelifalls.com There were a lot of nice places in the area."
1983114,2746,2013-07-26 07:55:00,3206,"Hilltop is clean, reasonable and right on the highway coming in. You will also see super eight on the south side of town. Typical super 8 with lots of parking. Americainn on the west side of town. Pool and higher priced. Another option is to cross and stay in ft Francis. No morning wait....La Place Redevouse (sp) on Rainey lake is nice. A little pricey but with two sharing a room not bad."
1983202,camp chef,2013-07-26 08:22:00,915,The Thunderbird on Rainy Lake. Great food and Bar. On the water.Really nice ...........check out the website.
1983314,Pikeslayer8,2013-07-26 08:58:00,1460,"Larry, Didn't the Super 8 change hands. I don't remember the name of it but it's not Super 8. Our group had reservations at what we thought was the Intl. Falls Super 8 for when we come out of camp. Turned out that the reservations got switched to the Ft Francis Super 8. Lucky for us that we got out of camp early enough so we could cancel our reservations once we figured it out and head on down the pike.

We were just in intl falls last week but did not stay there and I guess I didn't pay any attention as we drove through. Always seemed busy but then we never saw it on any day but Friday and that's when they are all busy. Did you notice if it changed its name?"
1983442,wallydave,2013-07-26 09:51:00,2151,"http://www.rainbowmotel.ca/We have stayed here the last couple of trips, we cross the border Friday night, less waiting. Stop at Boston Pizza for dinner, Tim Hortons for beackfast and head North. Ask for one of the remodeled rooms! Reasonable rates and fairly quiet!"

1983610,IaDave,2013-07-26 11:00:00,476,"I always stay at the Falls Motel. It is clean,has remodeled rooms, inexpensive. Large flat parking lot if hauling a boat and they allow dogs. I tried the Shore Lunch Caf√© this year for breakfast and I will never go to the Chocolate Moose again. It is a small family run place- the food was great and they have the kids making sure your coffee cup is never empty."
1983642,Pikeslayer8,2013-07-26 11:08:00,1460,Shore Lunch Cafe is a great place for breakfast or lunch. It was going through remodeling or something in early June so it was the Chocolate Moose for us.
