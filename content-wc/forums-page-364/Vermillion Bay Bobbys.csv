1994913,Track792,2013-07-31 09:29:00,25,Just to let you know I just got back from Fishing up north and stayed in Vermillion Bay. I was talking with Ray that owns Bobby's and he was saying that he will be shut down the entire month of September due to putting in bigger gas tanks and also new pumps.
1995577,SinOrSwim,2013-07-31 12:06:00,1528,"So, are there other places right in that area to get gas? This is only our 3rd year to Lac Seul and we have stopped at Bobby's to get some last minute things, use the bathroom and put some fuel before we arrive at camp. That way, when it's time to leave we don't have to stop in the early morning on departure day. We went to Bobby's then backtracked a little towar Ear Falls on 105 (I think 105 is the hwy?)"
1995609,Hawkfan,2013-07-31 12:10:00,237,Thanks for the info. Our trip is the weekend after Labor Day and we usually get some gas there to get us back to Dryden for the way home. Will have to adjust.
1996113,Track792,2013-07-31 14:37:00,25,You can buy gas at the Eagle River store on 17 on your way in to Dryden but not sure on what there hours are.
1996673,Glenman12,2013-07-31 17:56:00,762,if that's the one at 17 and 594 that's the one we use..
1997450,tackleman,2013-07-31 22:34:00,444,"being the only game In town to get gas, they need more pumps. but when they close down in September, where will the travelling public get the gas they need?"
