It was windier than **** out there today....but the walleye loved it and the graph was lit up in 22'FOW. Some of the fish we kept still only had fish fly in their guts....but a couple had 5"" - 6"" half digested bait fish, safe to say the bite was ON today, even if it did shut down a bit before we left around 1pm. Jigs and minnows (big minnows) had the numbers, but the bigger ones smashed leeches half way up the water column before the jig could get down there....great fun watching a gigantic signal race up to hammer your bait.http://i263.photobucket.com/albums/i...l/IMG_5577.jpg"
