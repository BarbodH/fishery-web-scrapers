Nice cabin beautiful scenery, however the walleye fishing proved to be pretty tough. We traveled as far north and west as stairway point. We used a clicker and caught an average of 25 walleyes a day for 3 of us. 23"" being the biggest with a a couple 22"", 1 - 21"" 6 - 20"" all the way down to a fingerling. We found our best fishing in miles bay 20 to 25 FOW. Went through a flat of crawlers pulling spinner rigs. We finally got a leech bite going yesterday with 16th oz Jigs tipped with some nice leeches from gills in morson. The highlight of the trip for me was hooking 2 different muskies and having 2 other follow ups. All over 45"" fish and I am no Musky fisherman example is I don't even own a bucktail had to borrow one from my brother in law.. hahaAlso we got pulled over by the CO for a spotcheck and that was a very pleasant experience as he was very nice and happy to answer any questions we had. We felt a little better when he informed us that none of the other boats he had checked were having much for luck!We did try a bunch of reefs, however we only caught a handful of eyes on them and we didn't really mark any fish on them either. We even fished a couple reefs that are not mapped. Shorelines seemed to be our best bet. We had a great time what a great part of Canada! We did miss judge on the amount of gas to bring along as we thought we weren't going to have to run that far. We pulled into the dock and filled it up and I hope that is the last time I have to shell out $285 bucks to fill up my pro v! haha oh well that was my fault we usually bring all our own gas to Canada but now if we go back we know what to expect. Thanks guys for all the usefull info on here it helped out a bunch. I would be happy to share any info I have so if you guys have any questions feel free to ask.Top http://www.hotspotoutdoors.com/forum...reen/reply.gif"

My assumption is the cold front, winds, rain etc shut them down. Had to work a lot harder for our fish. We only used crawlers and caught most of our fish jigging. Also pulled spinners on bottom bouncers which worked pretty well. Pulled a few fish off the reefs but most were caught on sand off shore in 20 ft of water. We had one evening of fast and furious walleye action as fast as we could drop our jigs but otherwise it was spotty at best. Our group of 5 also spent a lot of time Muskie fishing and had quite a few follows but only hooked one 43"". People in camp had the same results as we did on murkies and walleyes. Even the pike were slower than normal. One word...weather."
