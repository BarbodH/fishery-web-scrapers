When I look up the names of lakes that are included, next to lotw it says (partial survey and navigational information) what does this mean? I have the Great Lakes chip which shows the Minaki area north of Kenora. I looked at it today in the boat and it appears to show lotw as well.....does anyone know if the Canada chip shows the same info that the great lakes chip shows? Do I need to spend the extra money on another chip?"

1987554,fishanytime,2013-07-28 10:05:00,63,I brought the LOTW's navigational map this spring and it does not have anywhere near the detail the Lakemaster chip has for the NE section of the lake.

The detail is low with 3 meter contours (9 foot), but that is the best available. I did see they include Big Sand on as newly listed on the Canada chip, but called Nav and it is the same low detail already on the North chip. Still really valuable compared to no information though."
