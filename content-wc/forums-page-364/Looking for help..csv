This means to me being able to catch lots fish including walleye, smallmouth bass and pike, and the average numbers being around 25 a day. I want a drive to with the american plan. It must have a big boat that is comfortable to fish from. The final thing is a price for around 900.00 for the week. If you have any idea's please let me know. My experience in Canada is mostly in the easter part of Ontario. I have been to Eagle Lake once and really enjoyed that but most of the lodges on this lake are a little out of my price range. I have been going to Canada for 15 years now. I live in West Virginia so the Western part of Ontario is about as far as I would like to drive. Any help will be great. Thanks in advance."

I'm from eastern Ohio, and I understand your issues with the drive up north of the border (my Spring opener trip to a Perrault Falls camp was 24 hours each way). Good luck with your search. Rich B"
