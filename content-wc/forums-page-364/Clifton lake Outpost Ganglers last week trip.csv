1991849,Mike Borger,2013-07-30 02:48:00,1554,Great stuff. What was the camp like? Being Ganglers I'll guess pretty nice.
1992329,pike50plus,2013-07-30 08:31:00,584,"Camp manager was great too. Bund beds with mattresses and sheets, pillows & sleeping bags included. Food top notch, same as at lodge we just had to cook. The camp Guy Dave grilled dinner for us, pork chops, steaks, ribs, chicken, and walleye at our request. Ran the generator when we were in camp and we shut it off when we went to bed. Had a propane heater besides the wood burner so we could just sue it as needed. Boats and motors all good , flat boards in floor for better standing. Looks pretty much like the photos on website.http://www.ganglers.com/pages/clifton_outpost.html"
