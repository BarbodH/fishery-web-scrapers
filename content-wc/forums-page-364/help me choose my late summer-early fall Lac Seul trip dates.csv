1993297,Bucky Goldstein,2013-07-30 14:08:00,3,We are planning a 3 day trip for late August/early September in search of big eyes. The latest we could go is September 16 or so because I'll be hunting geese in Sask on the 24th. Need to be home with mama for a few days before departing again. I have only gone to Lac Seul early season and mid summer so any advice on finding and catching trophy fish later in the year is greatly appreciated. We are familiar with NW and NE sections. Haven't been to NE for a couple years. Any input on which area would be better for trophies is welcome also. We have to plan this soon due to vacation scheduling at work. Here are the moon phase calendars for quick reference. THanks guyshttp://www.calendar-365.com/moon-cal...13/August.htmlhttp://www.calendar-365.com/moon-cal...September.html

Beautiful grouse hunting weather but walleye had moved deep. We fished every depth from shore line out and finally found them in 40-56'. Moose were going nuts in the weedy bays mornings and late afternoon. Beautiful fall colors. Fishing was as very slow. My suggestion would be is do not go that late in sept. we will be heading back in sept but it will be the first weekend this year. If you time it right late in the year you will boat some pigs. Miss that window be prepared to go deep. Good luck and be safe. Bad day fishing was still better than good day at work."

When they hit, the hit well but when it turned off, it really turned off. Everyone in the camp was very similar struggling to find anything consistent."
