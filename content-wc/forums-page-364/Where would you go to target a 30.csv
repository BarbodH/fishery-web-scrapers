1991522,falkopat,2013-07-29 20:02:00,44,"I know its not north like Canada, but I have had great luck on green bay in the fall. last year in two- 2day trips my 2 buddies and I caught 4 over 30 inches. I have caught so many 29 and 29.5 inche fish I cannot count. patrick"
1994465,MrSimon,2013-07-31 06:15:00,922,"I think your best chance at catching a 30+ walleye is on water that you are very familiar with. Almost all of the healthy walleye lakes in Ontario will produce big fish .... you just have to know where to look. I'd rather be on a mediocre lake that I know really well, than a great lake that I've never fished. Well, ideally, I'd rather be on a great lake that I know well ..... but you get my point."
1985490,BenBeattie,2013-07-27 08:47:00,232,"Yep, Quinte in the late fall would be my choice as well."
1985562,octanehi5,2013-07-27 09:18:00,1104,"Bay of Quinte,late fall or ice fishing on it,second choice lake erie,I think there is a woman on here who has fishing trips on erie her name is Juls top of page?"

1986226,ohiojmj,2013-07-27 15:09:00,1262,"Lake Erie in Ohio, 30"" is very achievable. Charters bring them in all the time. I read of many getting caught each year, early and late in the season, with fewer in the heat of summer. My fishing buddy caught a 31"" this year. I've caught two 29's and a 29.5 this year (Kelley's Island and Lorain area) on homemade worm harnesses and I'm just a common weekend warrior with a Lowe FM175."
1987274,Duflebag,2013-07-28 08:34:00,218,The majority of my over 30's have come from Lac Seul in the fall.
1987506,fishanytime,2013-07-28 09:59:00,63,"My wife and I both caught 30 inch walleyes one day apart in mid June of this year on Lake of the Woods west of Yellow Girl. Mine was two miles from her spot, jigging with a minnow for both of them. They were fat, healthy and released. Fishanytime"
1987706,TinmanDon,2013-07-28 11:31:00,194,"Lake Winnipeg in March.....lots of 30-33""rs caught....I could hook you up"
1989202,troutwater,2013-07-29 06:27:00,299,"Thanks for the responses. I'm going to start making two trips a year and may try to get that elusive 30 for my second trip. I've been on a Lake Erie charter in early September in Ohio, but the biggest was ""only"" 23 inches. Still a lot of fun though and perch fished for a lot of the time. Don, I've heard Lake Winnipeg is a good lake but never really thought about it since it's suppose to be really dangerous. Is there a good guide you could recommend for it?"
1989586,rsiminski,2013-07-29 07:28:00,53,"If you ever get the urge to try the Bay of Quintie out for fall walleye here is a link to the charter captain I have used for the past 15 years. We spend the night at his house, wake up to a huge breakfast and hit the water for a full day of fishing. We then return back to the house for a walleye dinner he makes and wake up to do it all over the second day. Lodging,meals (breakfast lunch dinner) and tackle all included. Dave Chatterton is a fantastic captain who works extreemly hard to get you on the fish. We have caught numerous walleye over 30"" My largest was a 13lb 32.5"" long. and we usually we catch 1-2 30 inch eyes per trip.http://www.fishfindercharters.com/"
1990098,troutwater,2013-07-29 10:09:00,299,"That sounds like a pretty good time, but I'm not sure I'd be able to convince anyone else to go with me on a trip like that unfortunately. By looking at the website it appears I'd need a few guys to go."
1984034,troutwater,2013-07-26 12:50:00,299,"I'm sure this has been discussed before but I'm didn't immediately find anything on a search. What body of water would you fish if you were wanting a 30 incher? I realize time of year plays a big factor in this, but I'm curious to see the responses. My personal best is a 27 out of Pipestone 6 years ago, and I would like to beat that some day."
1984050,Lovetofish,2013-07-26 12:55:00,458,Lake of The Woods or Rainey River in the fall.
1984074,rsiminski,2013-07-26 13:12:00,53,"The Bay of Quintie, I have caught a few over 30"". I go up the 3rd weekend in November every year."
1984234,Blades-n-Beads,2013-07-26 14:13:00,484,"Easy question for me, my 1st choice would be Lac Seul late summer/early fall, 2nd choice is Lake of the woods, 3rd choice Bay of Quintie. For those who haven't tried Lac Seul early fall are missing out. Whatever you choose good luck and I hope you land one."
1984754,Fisherman Ted,2013-07-26 18:24:00,461,Last year we caught more than fifty 30s here on Hawk Lake. This year we have easily blown by that number with a 34 inch caught by Al Lindner on camera a few days ago and a 36 inch 2 weeks ago.
1984762,Mike Kansas,2013-07-26 18:25:00,1463,"Red River at Selkirk Manitoba. Have caught more 30""++ Walleye there than anyplace else. Personal best came there at 35"" 14 1/2lbs. The Manitoba record came from there at a gigantic 39"". Best time of year is late september , early october. Lots of info on internet about this area. If I can be of any help let me know. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1984946,Glenman12,2013-07-26 19:43:00,762,youre talking about walleyes right??..any idea when that Lindner show is going to air??
1984978,Rich B,2013-07-26 19:58:00,1081,"Consider Lake Erie in the mid to later Fall (especially off of Huron) for trolling up eyes 30"" and over......it ain't ""up nort"" but lot's of hungry big fish not far off shore..... Rich B"
1985169,kzoofisher,2013-07-27 05:40:00,5144,"The Detroit River in early April. Good shot at a 5' musky or a 6' sturgeon while you're walleye jigging, too."
1985394,Fisherman Ted,2013-07-27 07:59:00,461,"Yes, walleyes. Lot's of fun.Lindner show will probably air sometime this winter so says Dan Sura who also fished with us. You can also catch shots of the fishery on The Wilderness Journal and The New Fly Fisher TV shows this winter, both of which are filming this summer."
