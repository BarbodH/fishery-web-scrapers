1583682,BornToFish,2013-03-21 16:16:00,1224,"I fish a particular lake in North West Ontario in spring and again in August and September. I catch a fair number of larger walleyes (25 inches and over) in the springtime, just after the opener. I catch good numbers of walleyes in August and September, but not the size that I encounter in springtime. It seems as though I have to happen to be on the right piece of structure (e.g. an off-shore rock hump) at just the right time to connect with bigger walleyes.This pattern has led me to believe that the bigger walleyes might be suspended over open water during August and September and happen to come to structure from time to time. Another gentleman on this website gave me some great words of encouragement that there is some merit to my suspicions about open water walleyes in the late season. I've tried trolling for these open water walleyes and have had no luck what-so-ever. I'm not too surprised by this because I am not an experienced troller. My limited experience has me wondering if I have great techniques, but am trolling in poor places to look for bigger walleyes. Alternatively, I might have lousy techniques but am trolling in great places. Can you offer any suggestions for trolling for open-water (away from structural elements) walleyes during August and September in Sunset Country? I'm wondering about things like types of water to focus my efforts on, selection of lures, depth, boat speed, and the like. Thanks in advance for your suggestions."
1584738,KTroller,2013-03-21 20:28:00,237,"I would search with your electronics the areas you have in the past, then work your way over deeper water and structure until you see suspended arcs. Note the depth and then begin trolling with stickbaits on leadcore line to reach the depth just above the fish. If those areas don't show anything on your electronics, then you'll need to broaden your search. Start by trying to find structure adjacent to deep water making note of any clouds of baitfish and trolling those areas. Good luck! KT"
1584874,BornToFish,2013-03-21 20:53:00,1224,"KTroller,I will put my trolling ignorance out front and center. I have a reel with lead core line but have never used it. I understand why someone would want to use lead core, but never got around to trying it. How do you connect the lead core line to a monofilament or fluorocarbon leader? What type of leader would you recommend?I like where your advice was taking me. Many thanks for your patience...."
1585026,KTroller,2013-03-21 21:39:00,237,"I use a fluoro leader roughly 3x the length of the rod (21 - 30 feet) and then trim it when it gets nicked up. I've tried various knots to attach the leader. Uni to uni and a double willis both work well but I prefer a tiny swivel that will go through the guides. The ones I use I call ""ant swivels"" as they are the size of a small ant you might see on your driveway. Palomar knot from the leadcore to the swivel and a trilene knot from swivel to the fluoro. I use the willis knot to connect the leadcore to a mono backing on the spool. Figure 5 feet of depth per color (10 yds) of lead unless you use the new Sufix 832 leadcore, then figure 7-8 feet of depth per color. Trolling lead is a lot of fun and offers a very repeatable process for finding fish and dialing in a bite.KT"
1589202,zeebee,2013-03-23 09:58:00,1144,"Come mid August and 90% of my time on the water is trolling. The key is depth. 'Eyes that time of the year for the most part are at depths of 20-40'+. Good success with Deep Husky Jerks #12 and Deep Taildancers #11. For line 10lbs mono works well. Speed I vary but generally med to med fast (1.5 - 2.5mph). Troll along rocky shorelines, submerged islands and bay mouths. Big northerns are at that depth too so I use tiable 12lbs leaders. Hate leadcore and winch reels...if I needed to go below 35' I'd opt for a downrigger so I could use lighter tackle (I take a portable on fly-ins for lakers) but the rate of fish mortality is too high below 30' or so."
1595210,Aaron-IN,2013-03-25 06:41:00,500,"My suggestion would be to hit the main lake basin after 8:00 pm, get your binocs out and look for two things, baitfish breaking the surface and seagulls. Once you find them take a #9 shad rap and troll around that area. You can thank me later."
1632378,bobbylfishermon,2013-04-03 13:48:00,241,"I've fished the Indian Lake chain of lakes for 14 years(Vermilion Bay, On) and I troll #5 &#7shad raps and NEVER get deeper than 9ft. of water! In the spring the fish(wallys, musky, smallys, notherns) are up shallow anyway, come summer, I troll early and late in the daybecause fish are up to feed, still no deeper than 9ft. Fall the fish move shallow as the water cools. I'm a hardcore troller and Never get deeper than 9ft."
1988626,BornToFish,2013-07-28 19:51:00,1224,I am leaving for Sunset Country in a few days. I refreshed this thread to see if others might have helpful suggestions when it comes to trolling for walleyes during August and September. Many kind thanks....
1988674,Guest,2013-07-28 20:06:00,0,"I love the open water trolling bite that aug and sept offer. During the day I troll deep reefs where the jig fisherman are at. I like reef runners, deep tail dancers, and 9 shad raps trolled 140 feet back behind boards and long lines. In the evening I troll higher running big baits over deep water ciscoes rising to the surface. 50 to 60 feet dep water 5 to 7 feet down....structure doesn't matter...find the bait and you are good! Musky lures are the ticket for this..sand cats, craves, and grandmas!!!"
