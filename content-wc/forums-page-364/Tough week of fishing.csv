1998314,Guest,2013-08-01 10:06:00,0,"3 of us went to hebert . weather sucked 4 foot waves and rain 2 !/2 days, had a 7 year old so we were camp bound 1/2 the time. fished 3 evenings near five sisters islands anchored in 22 feet same spot each evening. caught 100 wallaye each evening. fantastic fishing. caught fish 2afternoons same spot worms were the ticket. normal lures that we catch wallaye on Oneida lake every day worked poorly till we added a piece of worm. 400 wallaye caught in 3days. 7year old caught 25-30 each evening. camps boats motors were topnotch. care taker was excellent. air tamerac out fitter top notch. many walleye 18-22 ins. biggest 27 ins. no pike. pilots were excellent.... only deterent was poor weather. dirt roads were ok. again , a piece of meat on any lure produced excellent. was the trip of a lifetime!!!"
1998818,kzoofisher,2013-08-01 12:35:00,5144,"Great job getting into the fish when the weather allowed and getting the kid his bites. Lac Hebert sure sounds like a great location. I'll have to put it on the list of trips to consider when my youngest turns 16. Right now his list is Alaska, Argentina, Chile or New Zealand. None of which is very realistic (maybe Alaska)."
1968481,kzoofisher,2013-07-21 10:42:00,5144,"I fished Dog Lake, Missanabie from the 13th through the 19th and found it very frustrating. I had never been there before but my fishing partner had been the last six years and though he tends to go earlier than this, his brother usually goes in August so we felt like we had a pretty good handle on some summer locations. The weather was perfect, steady barometer, not too sunny and enough wind to put a chop on the water but not so much that we had trouble with it except mid-day a couple of days. The wind was also steadily out of the same direction, SSW. We prefer casting jigs so we figured to start on the windward side of shore, islands and humps, especially where there was access to deeper water and we caught some fish there, but mostly small and not too many. We worked deeper with the same results. We tried weed beds, same thing. We spent some time just cruising deep and looking for schools that might be moving in after dark. Nothing. We tried the inlet of the Dog River, same story. Narrows where the wind was making some current, back side of islands and humps, mud flats, looked in water 100' and deeper for fish targeting ciscoes, we rigged with bait (crawlers, leeches) and trolled crankbaits, slip bobbered, we got out before dawn and stayed after dark, you name it we tried it. Obviously, the question of just exactly how much we sucked started to be unavoidable so we started talking to other boats and they were all experiencing the same thing. Don't get me wrong, we got enough to have a meal everyday for the two of us and my two boys and some of them were pretty nice; a 28 walleye, a few 3+ pound smallmouth and plenty of 18-25 pike. That's not really what you're looking for in a Canada trip, though. Guys who had been coming there 20 years said they had never seen anything like it. The strangest part was the fish we kept, all walleye 16-18. We checked their stomachs for some clue as to what they had been feeding on and they were all empty, as though our baits were the first thing they had fed on in a day or two. Everyone else reported the same thing. It seemed that despite water in the low 70's and tons of bait fish everywhere we looked the walleye simply weren't feeding. Weird. Has anybody else experienced the same thing or have any theories?"
1969337,515,2013-07-21 18:27:00,254,We were in the area with exact same results last week as well. We fished hard all hours of the day and it was a tough week and what we did find was small. I was beginning to think it was us and how we were fishing nice to know it wasn't just us though.
1969785,kzoofisher,2013-07-22 03:21:00,5144,"That's how it goes sometimes, I guess. The only type of water we consistently marked fish was 80' and deeper, 55'-65' feet down. They weren't walleye. If we were both new to the lake I would have written it off, but Brad has done very well there in the early season and his brother does well in August. We probably just timed it right as they were transitioning to the summer pattern and they were scattered so thin with so much bait to feed on that we never found a big school. The empty stomachs still bug me though."
1969809,octanehi5,2013-07-22 05:20:00,1104,"I have a theory,The last week in june there was five days in a row of rainy weather and very cold low pressure, July 1 the bite started to improve, with high pressure building in and winds out of the south west for four days the bite improved every day until our last day it was off the hook. In a weeks time from june 30 to july 7th, I have never experiaced a bite in my lifetime as good as we had it. I had 6 guys in camp, everyone set their own personal bests, there was not anytime of the day that you could not catch the walleye, I mean big numbers, Our crew caught 2250 in 7 days, I personally doubled my preveios best of 450 to 900 that week. it was a week that a fisherman only dreams about. I think that every walleye in that lake was feeding that week. I have been on a few canadian shield lakes after such bites happened the week before, and hardly caught enough fish to have a fish fry.Giving the weather in canada this yr with the very long winter ,late ice outs, the bite was late ,first week the weather got good they all gorged themselfs. I do not expect to see that kind of bite in my lifetime again."
1970081,phishfearme,2013-07-22 07:28:00,1242,where did you go that you averaged 130 per day for the entire week? phish
1970249,octanehi5,2013-07-22 08:28:00,1104,"Air Tamarac Lac hebert, Lac is north of the gouin res in Quebec. Best walleye lake in quebec. This yr was my 10th yr on this lake"
1971233,Hank Jr,2013-07-22 12:59:00,10,I have fish this lake about 15 years ago there were 4 of us and we also did real well on Walleye not as good as you but I can almost believe your numbers are posible . We had a great week also some big Pike.
1971417,Mike Kansas,2013-07-22 13:45:00,1463,We had a week like that on Lac Seul the second week of June this year. New Moon perfect weather and 6 of us went through 160 doz minnows and 800 crawlers. Out of live bait the last day and still slayed them on plastics. Best week in Canada in over 70 trips. Probably never happen again. Mike Kansas
1972561,octanehi5,2013-07-22 18:43:00,1104,"Our six guys went through 2000 nightcrawlers, 3 lbs of leeches plus the leeches we caught at the dock 8 lbs of salted minnows,triggerX and gulp alive along with the wind out of the southwest for 4 days it was a new moon also. Its looking like the forth week in june in 2014. just starting to put the list together for next yr."
1972673,kzoofisher,2013-07-22 19:15:00,5144,"Sounds reasonable, the majority of fish may have been gorged, or gorging at night and laying tight during the day. Dog wasn't our first choice but we made the trip on fairly short notice and our options were limited. We obviously need to get our act together for next year and develop a better plan for searching water. I don't want to give the impression that numbers of fish were the primary reason for going, I spent a high quality week with my sons as they enter their teen years and that will pay dividends in the future. They certainly want to go back as soon as possible, which is great because while Erie, Saginaw Bay and St. Clair have a lot of fish, that experience is not one I enjoy nearly as much. The rivers around here and walleye/smallmouth lakes in the NW lower peninsula are a different story. Those are a blast. Thanks to everybody for the responses, I've really enjoyed reading them."
