1981554,Guest,2013-07-25 15:45:00,0,Hey Guys- I have done a little research and have found nothing but good things about this place and the owners. My question is this- has anyone specifically targeted muskies in this area? We have a diverse group of walleye and musky guys and we all want some place remote with good action on both. Is this that kind of place? Any help is appreciated! Poke

In the beginning the majority of our group fished Pike and we went the first week of July. The main lure used for pike was a 3/4oz V spinner bait. There were many days that two guys would catch 200++ Pike but never was one Musky caught. We now go the second week of June and fish mainly Walleye and Smallmouth. We have never caught a Musky there, but that doesen't mean that a late season guy with Musky know how couldn't get some hook ups. There are plenty of bays and great looking structure and a old river bed with deep water adjacent to some great shallow structure. The best Musky area on Lac Seul is reported to be the NE lake section around Chamberlain Narrows. Let me know if I can be of any further assistance. Mike Kansas"

We fish the fourth week a June, the Walleye a week to recover after the beat down that Mike and his crew put on them. We primarily fish for Walleye, but also spend a little time targeting Pike. We have caught thousands of pike but have never caught a Muskie. If they were there we would have caught one. I've read that some experts believe the next world record Muskie will come from Lac Seul. I love the Black Bay outpost, it's a very special place. However, if you're looking for a Walleye/Muskie combo trip you need to be 50 miles east of Black Bay. Best regards, Scott"
1983386,Guest,2013-07-26 09:28:00,0,Thanks guys. Very much appreciated. I'm probably going to look a little further east. Any recommendations?
1983730,Mike Kansas,2013-07-26 11:50:00,1463,Not on Lac Seul but if I was going Musky/Walleye fishing I would look at Sandys Blackhawk Lodge on LOTW. Mike Kansas

1990346,worthsr,2013-07-29 12:03:00,52,"I'd recommend trading your Muskie fishing friends for more Walleye fishing friends and heading to Black Bay! Just kidding. I'd ask Ben Beattie for a recommendation. I've never met Ben but I've read his posts, articles and website. I believe that if there's a remote outpost cabin in an area on Lac Seul that offers both quality Muskie and Walleye fishing opportunities Ben would know about it. Then I'd see if Ben was available to guide my boat the first couple days of my trip. http://www.benbeattieoutdoors.com/"
