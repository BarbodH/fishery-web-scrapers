I have a Huminbird 597ci HD DI Combo (GPS) unit that isn't portable, but I made into one.....you should be able to make most any unit portable. Just know that any unit with a GPS is going to suck alot of battery life if that's what you are using. It's a little more work to make your own portable, but it was worth it to me. You will need to have plenty of extra battery power which is gonna require more weight for you fly in. I took 2 batteries and was able to charge one in cabin from the battery bank that the solar system charged for cabin lights etc and used the other one in the boat with me. I also have a small solar panel (many on the market) and clipped that to my battery as it was running my locator/gps in the boat and it trickle charged the battery to run all day for me. Otherwise the battery would only last about 4 hrs. The other option is to be able to clip the unit to the boat battery if it has one and you won't need to worry at all, but most outposts don't have boats with batteries. OR, just buy a portable!!"

1992545,Glenman12,2013-07-30 09:41:00,762,me and my partner use the 571PT and another boat in our group has the 571PT/DI..both work great..
1992753,SinOrSwim,2013-07-30 10:30:00,1528,I have a Humminbird 595C and bought the portable kit. Came with the bag/cover and a place to mount the unit. Unit plugs into the base and then just connect the battery to the plugs in the back of the unit and off I go. Morgan is right. If you have GPS they are battery hogs. I also made a little pig tail so the finder plugs into one plug coming off the battery and a flexible solar panel plugs into the other pigtail so the battery is charging while we are fishing. It works very well but still need one battery per day.
