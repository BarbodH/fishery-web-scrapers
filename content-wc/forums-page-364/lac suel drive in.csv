Also heard good about Thaddeus lake, which is a lot small for first timers. We would like to drive in . Any help would be grateful.We are thing in the spring also. Ron"
1968513,wallydave,2013-07-21 10:55:00,2151,"http://www.lacseul.com/Ron, check out Goose Bay on the link above, spring is the best time of year for the NW end of LS!"
1968617,2746,2013-07-21 11:28:00,3206,"Excellent lake and lots of drive to lodges on the NW side. In addition to Goose Bay there is Evergreen, Lac Suel lodge and Onaway all easy to drive to. Lac Suel is big but with help from your camp owner and a GPS with a lake chip you will do fine. If you want smaller Gullrock lake is just a few miles up the road, has excellent walleye and Northern fishing with several very good lodges. Spring (late may through the middle of June) is a good time for a first timer to go."
1968633,SinOrSwim,2013-07-21 11:41:00,1528,"We have been going to Onaway for the last couple years and our group loves it. Would still like to return to our fly-in at some point but Onaway has been very popular with many in our group. Cabins are all new, boats are very nice, fish house is great etc. Can't say we have slayed the fish yet but we are still learning the lake. We know they are there."
1970273,Mark R,2013-07-22 08:35:00,1538,We have been going to Evergreen for the last 15 years. Good accomadations and boats and motors top notch and great folks that run it.
1970777,rockape,2013-07-22 10:57:00,215,"You can catch fish, and big ones, almost anywhere on Lac Seul. Someone caught a 28 off the dock at the ramp this year."

1972249,BreezyPoint,2013-07-22 16:52:00,1581,"I just got back from a week at Goose Bay Camp. I first went there in 1965 and he last time I was there was in 1987.I must say the best fishing was in MacKenzie Bay, but we went there only one day and that was the only day we used live bait. We caught fish everywhere we went that looked like a walleye spot with the wind blowing on it.Andrea also marked a map for us and we caught fish at every spot she marked.We caught our biggest walleye within sight of the camp and caught dozens trolling crank baits in eight feet of water or less. I do have to admit, the walleyes bit about three times faster on live bait, but the cranks produced larger fish on average.The fishing was far better than my previous experience. I would strongly recommend Andrea's camp. This was a great return experience after so many years."
