I noticed another route 614 a little further then heads north, Iâ€™m thinking the road is in bad shape and you need four wheel drive. Thank you, janitor"
6374970,lionfan19,2019-12-01 10:08:00,41,"JD, I have always wondered the same thing. Back in the 80's I went as far as Manitouwadge on 614 and I recall it being gravel back then. I believe that the road north from there is in very poor condition and subject to wash outs. I will be very curious to see what others have knowledge of on this subject. I remember my buddies dad back when I was a kid calling that section of road north of Manitouwadge the Caramat highway. If you look on a map its not a straight shot either."
6375018,Namegosikaa,2019-12-01 14:32:00,61,"The 614 to manitouwadge from the 17 is paved and in good condition, the caramat industrial road and 625 to highway 11 are terrible. I tried this route in September and that 55miles is tough, very rough lots of ups and downs and curves. I did it at night which made it worse but average speeds of 25-35 mph is as fast as I was comfortable with, as a comparison the blueberry and ogoki roads are far better."
6375024,kzoofisher,2019-12-01 14:42:00,5144,"Steer clear of the industrial highway, dirt with plenty of softball sized rocks. If more than one vehicle you need to stay a couple hundred yards apart to see through the dust when it's dry. And then there's the white knuckle fun when a semi comes barreling at you. Stick to the main roads and don't drive at night if you can avoid it, very moosey looking terrain between White River and 11."

6378136,lenray,2019-12-15 14:26:00,467,Been in that area at to Manitouwadge--yes that road is a rough go...............
6378400,pike50plus,2019-12-16 14:58:00,584,"travel safely maybe 1/2 to 3/4 hr difference, if dry extremely dusty and if wet I;'l bet not too safe?"
