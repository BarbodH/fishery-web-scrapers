6378982,prov1800,2019-12-19 06:50:00,5010,Just joking.Ontario on a whole is loaded with smallies.Even here in NWO we have huge bass and great numbers just look at the results from some of the smallmouth bass tournaments in the area.
6379010,fsz,2019-12-19 09:33:00,144,"I looked into such a trip as well (bass and walleye). While there are many bodies of water that have both, genuinely good fishing for both seems hard to come by. Of course good is a relative term. There seem to be some pretty good options in far NWO ontario, fly in and drive in. As other have said Algoma can be comparatively tough for walleye. I looked into Windermere, from what I have read it has both bass and walleye although the walleye can be difficult to find in good numbers and require some long boat runs. Do a search and youll see. Seems like good electronics is critical on that lake for walleye but again I've never been there just did a bunch of research. Winderemeres sister lake, Prarie Bee, has both species although the walleye seem to be reported as fewer in numbers than windermere. Another option is to pick a good ""bass only"" or ""walleye only"" lake and take out or day trips to a second ""drive to"" (or portage lake) for the other specie but this might be difficult on a drive in. My research also also indicated some of the drive in lakes had lots of bass but virtually nothing over 12""."
6379022,prov1800,2019-12-19 09:59:00,5010,"As a fishing guide in the vermillion bay area i fish a lot of lakes.Most of my guests do want walleye but have many multispecies fisherman to and all the lakes i fish here also have bass in them as well as perch,pike and musky.some have lake trout and crappie.Number of them have bass up 24"".Ill give you some lakes to look up.They all have both species your looking for in good numbers.

6377922,Carlbg7,2019-12-14 16:48:00,3,"Hi folks, Wife and I are planning our second fishing trip to Ontario next summer. We primarily fish for walleye but would also like to try some smallmouth bass fishing. Any suggestions for lakes that have decent fishing for both would be appreciated. Thanks"
6377946,Pooch,2019-12-14 18:41:00,4618,"Little Vermillion near Sioux Lookout, don't remember the name of the lodge, but no walleye in the lake. Smallies, Musky and Northern. Lac Seul has all species, but some areas better than others for the different species. There are lakes near Dryden that have walleye and smallies. Someone here will jump in. Pooch"
6377970,clearis,2019-12-14 20:58:00,47,"Cliff Lake Resorts (https://canadafishinghunting.com) has great multi species fishing, walleyes and smallmouth. Smallmouth is good in June, but great in September. Camp is a drive to, reasonably priced, and very well run. Cabins are excellent and the smallmouth fishing is some of best in northern Ontario. Oh, and Cliff Lake has muskies. Highly recommended."

6378148,Carlbg7,2019-12-15 15:11:00,3,Thanks you guys. I will look into these. Does anyone have any suggestions for tha Algoma district?
6378200,martinbns,2019-12-15 18:45:00,1520,Lake of the Woods has great Bass fishing as well as walleye. Pretty much has everything.
6378686,The tank,2019-12-17 17:57:00,340,Lake of the woods is a good choice. Rainy lake would be one of the best for smallies.
6378794,dhottle,2019-12-18 09:54:00,163,LaBelle's Birch Point Camp on Rainy Lake both for both walleye & smallies.
6378840,prov1800,2019-12-18 15:20:00,5010,My suggestion about algoma is forget about and come to sunset country.
6378974,MrSimon,2019-12-19 06:22:00,922,"For the walleye, maybe. But there is AMAZING smallie fishing in Algoma."
