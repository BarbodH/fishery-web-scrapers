6374888,David Anderson,2019-11-30 20:03:00,2073,"If you are coming from the south as you go through Dewey Narrows you are traveling ""down stream"" as defined by the old river system prior to it's life as a reservoir. When you take a right turn following the trail, at Taylor Island you will now be traveling up stream to the source past Chamberlain Narrows. If you notice on the map the Red buoy is on the left side at Dewey Narrows however at the Memorial you pass it's now on the right side following the old adage, Red-Right-Returning (to the source). This is where the official current change is noted as the buoys from that point north reflect the change in Channel marker position, or visa versa if you are going back south."
6374890,Pooch,2019-11-30 20:21:00,4618,"Thanks David. As far as I know the only buoy's remaining on LS are on maps. When I started fishing the lake twelve years ago there were buoys in place in the areas we fished. Maybe not all of them, but a few.Seems calling it a water flow change is nothing more than a convergence of two rivers?I've not fished the area on my posted map section. What are the memorials you speak of? I see the markings several places on various maps. One I'm sort of familiar with marks an old Anglican Mission near the N/W old ferry landing near Archie's Landing.Thanks for the response.Pooch"
6374926,Stringbean,2019-12-01 06:35:00,279,"The memorial cairns that you asked about are located all over Lac Seul. I always pass by one on my way to Mackenzie Bay while staying at Goldpines. I have seen them build some of the memorials on the east end of Lac Seul. The people come out there with a flat bottom boat with a pile of mason sand and a gas powered mixer. They start mixing mortar and then stack the stones in place and pack with mortar. If I remember correctly, they were built in the mid-80's. You can get a better history at this link. https://lacseulfloatinglodges.com/la...ial-cairns.php Just click on the ""Learn more"" tab in the center of the page. We stayed at Frog Rapids camp and trekked out to the Deception Bay landing every morning. If you go east in Deception Bay to the gap where the English River flows north there are 3 small islands that you pass between. Beyond the islands you turn left on your way to Manitou Rapids. The cairn that the men were building is located on the north side of the channel just before you make that right hand turn to enter the rapids. There are 5 more cairns between Taylor Island and Bear Narrows. You can see 2 of them on Pooch's map."
6374968,David Anderson,2019-12-01 10:05:00,2073,"There are still buoys. Every year I travel from Deception Bay to Chamberlain Narrows (usually 3 times/year). As stated in a previous response to another poster, there is a red buoy you must be to the left of as you turn 90 degrees right going into Bear Narrows. Up about a half mile or so there is a green buoy on the left. Quite honestly I rely (too much) on my GPS chart and my Navionics map and the trails. I like my map orientation North Up however it can be more difficult to do the fast calculation in your head if your staying on your ""safe"" trail. Heading up Bear Narrows I was to the left and looked around for the Green Buoy. it can take a few seconds to spot it, which I did and was heading to the left of that when I should be to the right. Making a correction I got what I was thought a safe distance however the ice had pushed the buoy up onto the reef quite far and it wasn't pretty. Generally the map buoy positions are probably where they are suppose to be. Most are close, some not so close. This year I switched the map orientation to Heading up, much easier to keep track of oneself!"
6375006,Pooch,2019-12-01 14:16:00,4618,"We fish the West and middle area to just past Pine Point of LS and I've not seen a buoy in years. The concrete and Rebar are still there, but no buoys. Someone really needs to mark the old buoy anchors. They are a very hard to see water hazard. Some of the footings (and rebar!) are right at water level or just barely under. They are boat killers.I've been lucky (so far) and only killed one prop when I got into an unknown area and was traveling just above idle trying to find my way out. Even the channel markings on the map take you very close to some nasty stuff.I always keep ""Heading up"" on my GPS when traveling. Sometimes when working a reef I will go ""North up"" to make it easier to keep my brain oriented.Pooch"
