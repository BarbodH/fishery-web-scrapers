With an environmentally responsible mentality, we are proud to offer a fully equipped solar powered cabin for 2 to 4 people, just 10 minutes flight from Clova, where you can enjoy isolation. The excellent fishing quality of this lake is recognized, thus we open it strictly under a catch and release policy, knowing that this new destination is a fishing paradise to preserve, with an unparalleled intimacy. You will eat fish on the spot, respecting a slot size limit same as Gouin, but without bringing any back. Do not miss your chance to book there this year! We thank our team for all the efforts put in that achievement. And the replacement in 2019 of our service plane (the little Piper Cub) by a larger and more efficient Cessna 180, coupled with a qualified crew assigned to your service ensure the best service you can find on a fly-in fishing or hunting trip. With excellent fishing quality, well maintained cabins, recent aluminum boats with new outboards, satellite phones at each camp and a young, reliable and courteous team, Air Tamarac intends to remain a must for anglers and hunters. Now with brook trout fishing and moose hunting, Air Tamarac has it all! Please note that, for the duration of your stay, Air Médic protection for emergency medical evacuation by helicopter will remain included in our packages. A big plus when booking with Air Tamarac!"
