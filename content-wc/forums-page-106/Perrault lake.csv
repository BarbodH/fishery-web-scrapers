6382018,fishinmaniac,2019-12-30 21:21:00,74,Im looking to goto Perrault lake this summer. Any good lodge recommendations? Any advise for fishing early July?
6382046,Sniper1980,2019-12-30 22:44:00,33,Now. Lake sucks. Always been over fished Good luck
6382118,The tank,2019-12-31 09:08:00,340,I've fished perrault some. We stayed at cedar point resort. Its right by the river that connects the lakes. Cedar in my opinion is better. Both are easy to fish both have great fishing for bass and walleye.
6382122,prov1800,2019-12-31 09:20:00,5010,"Ive fishèd perrault and cedar lakes for 30 years and both lakes have been getting better every year. Back in early 80,s they were a challenge as were a lot of lakes but now fishing is fantastic and would highly recommend either one.If your looking for a good lodge check out out Manotak Lodge very well run lodge and offers the American plan also."
6382132,jackpotjohnny48,2019-12-31 09:42:00,153,"I stopped in at Manotak Lodge a few years back to take a tour during a fishing trip to Cedar Lake. Manotak looked like it had nice accomodations. I believe there are two other resorts (Rocky Shore and Rainbow Point, if I remember correctly). Lindner's Angling Edge filmed a two part show up at Manotak about 2 or 3 years ago if I remember correctly. And they caught some REALLY BIG walleyes on Rapala jigging raps. I think you can watch these episodes on youtube, or on the Manotak website. Good luck! ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
6382134,prov1800,2019-12-31 09:45:00,5010,Ýour right but a new episode will be on this month from a fall show they did on the ontario experience with troy lindner
6382136,bearfvr13,2019-12-31 09:46:00,174,"And Perrault Lake Camp,.....owned and operated by Mark and Amy Tycholis."
6382148,jackpotjohnny48,2019-12-31 10:08:00,153,"You're right. I just looked at the website for ""The Ontario Experience"" with Troy Lindner. It appears as if their first episode at Dogtooth Lake airs this week. And then next week's episode is at Manotak Lodge on Perrault. I'm very much looking forward to watching these."
6382154,prov1800,2019-12-31 10:12:00,5010,Also keep your eyes peeled for a episode i did with troy on Anishinabi Lake for lake trout and pike.think that will air a bit later in year.
6384134,Blue walleye,2020-01-06 17:44:00,29,We stayed at Perrault lake camp last August. We had wind and rain all week but the walleye fishing was great. Mark and Amy are great hosts and have beautiful house cabins
