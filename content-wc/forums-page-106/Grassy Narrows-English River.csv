It looks like the main (only?) resort in the area is Last Resort out of Grassy Narrows? From what I've heard it invol a fair amount of running, as well as fishing more current-related/river-typr spots than traditional Canadian shield lakes? I do see that there still seems to be plenty of lakes in the chain, so I'm sure we'd be able to put plenty of fish in the boat. Also, how is that stretch of the river for navigating? Again, compared to normal Ontario lakes. I've fished on plenty of rivers of varying sizes, just wondering what to expect as far as hazards, shallow water, etc.Thanks very much guys!"
