6380874,ILScott,2019-12-26 17:32:00,139,I just got a Garmin Striker 4 and was wondering if anybody has used this model on a remote lake in Canada. Any suggestions that will help me out. Thanks

I use it with a Yak Attack box (I forget the name of the box which houses the small, 12 volt battery), as well as a Yak Attack ""Switchblade."" The Switchblade is essentially a bendable folding arm which lowers the transducer into the water. Then, when you want to portage the boat (or canoe) into a different lake, or if you wish to pull the boat up onto the beach for shore lunch, you simply bend the switchblade arm up in order to take the transducer out of the water so that it doesn't get scratched or damaged. I have found this to be a good setup, and I really like the Striker 4. It is a very user friendly depthfinder in my opinion. ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
6380970,jackpotjohnny48,2019-12-27 00:35:00,153,I just remembered the name of the Yak attack item which houses the battery. It is the Yak Attack cell block. The Yak Attack switchblade is attached to the cell block for lowering the transducer into the water when using either my canoe or a camp rental boat
