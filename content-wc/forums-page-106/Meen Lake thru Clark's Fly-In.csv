One suggestion is to go to their site and review their Northern Connection section and review past fishing reports.There are several updates from groups who have fished Meen and it looks like a good action lake for Walleye. Several posts mention good fishing right from the dock and we have experienced that for ourselves on other lakes. The scent from the free minnows that Wayne supplies really helps to congregate fish around the docks..It is a nice way to end your day by relaxing and catching fish right off the dock in the evenings. Good luck on your trip..
