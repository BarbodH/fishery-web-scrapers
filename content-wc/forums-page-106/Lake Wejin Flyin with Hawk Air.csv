Anybody fished Wejin recently? Any advise on hot spots, bait, colors, time of day, Northerns or Walleye, what to bring or not bring? Are the portage lakes worth doing? Many thanks for whatever you can tell me."

Could be a fun day and something different. The first portage to North Wejin looks fairly short and they even have a dock on that lake, so that's a nice bonus. It looks like their might even be a dock on Kabiskagami lake.I would recommend getting a handheld GPS and marking the coordinates for the portages if you can. The portages aren't too long and the lakes aren't that big, so it's probably OK if you don't, but it is definitely easier with a GPS."
