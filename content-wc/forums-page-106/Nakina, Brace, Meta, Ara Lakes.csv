6348418,MrSimon,2019-08-09 06:45:00,922,"I'm sorry Hit-Em had a bad trip. Nobody wants that. But it goes to show how important it is to REALLY do your homework on a lodge before going. Many issues can be avoided by asking specific questions of the owner. Like, what's the water situation, when are meals served, what's on the menu, what cabin will we be in etc. I always look closely at lots of pictures, speak with the outfitter multiple times, and find at least one person who has been there recently and contact them for advice and info."
6348436,PJHColdwater,2019-08-09 07:49:00,37,If you are looking for fantastic walleye fishing on that chain of lakes - Ara Lake was spectacular in June. We brought 6 guys and stayed at Ara Lake Camp. It is not the ritz - but that is not what we were looking for. Buck Smith ran the camp - and did a great job. Good food and clean cabins. Brad is the camp helper - and does an absolute fantastic job. He has 20+ years of experience and took us out an afternoon and put us on great fishing. He has minnows for sale - very reasonable. Boats were 14 ft aluminum with 9.9's. Nothing fancy - but modern 4 stroke motors. I would highly recommend Ara Lake Camp - if you are looking for a traditional fly in experience with the American Plan. As far as the walleye fishing - we had a great week catching tons of walleye. One evening we had great conditions and a good drift. (3 of us in the boat after dinner) We wanted to see just how many walleye we could catch in a 2 hour period. 72 walleye landed in a 2 hour period. We finally stopped because we ran out of minnows....and were getting tired.
6348444,adempsey2.0,2019-08-09 08:06:00,611,"Those water signs are required by law at every camp unless they filter the water, which is a huge commitment (annual testinh is $$). I make coffee with the lake water all the time, as do most people I imagine.What did you mean no full bath? As in no bathtub? Was there no toilet, sink and shower?I am somewhat surprised to read the negatives about the American Plan at Brace, but I have had enough similar experiences at other lodges that we dont do it anymore. It seems to be the first place camps try to cut costs and it ends up being a terrible experience. They are better off not offering it at all.Any pics of the cabin?Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk"
6349740,MMinMN,2019-08-13 11:12:00,5,"Have been fishing this area for quite some time. This year we did Abamasagi (to the east) returning home thursday 8/8. Typically we try to fish in June if possible, so this was the latest we've been up there. Observations, took us a couple of days to get the lake scoped out and weather was a bit to nice(dead calm). Pulled in a few, but not ""Canada Impressive"". Then a cool front(storm) came through and we had found a couple of the productive areas on the lake by then. Fishing improved dramatically. 15-19 was the norm, with a few twenties sprinkled in. Last day was terrific topped the week off with a 27. The outfitter(TLO) mentioned that a 31"" was pulled in at the other end of the lake(we didn't make it there) The fish were very fat!!! accommodations were typical, our cabin was a three bedroom unit capable of handling 10s that was in the process of getting upgrades. The interior was new knotty pine, with Hickory cabinets. Newer windows and doors were installed. Hot shower and water were available with an on demand water heater. Water has always been lake water where ever we have stayed for fly-ins. We bring in filter bags/pumps, bottled water and boil the filtered lake water for consumption(coffee etc..). 12V Power was supplied via solar collector and 2 car batteries using LED lighting. This cabin did have a large generator on site, but the cabins were not wired to use them and apparently the extensions cords went missing. So be aware if you use a CPAP machine you should probably bring your own power regardless of what the outfitter has. Propane powered Refrigerator/freezer were on the small side for a weeks worth of food. Boating equipment was also typical(and lacking as usual). 14 footers that are bit flat in the hull, swivel seats in various condition that were hard mounted so you couldn't adjust them. 9.9 Mercs which ran fine. Ideally a little deeper V would be preferred and 15HP motors as minimum equipment. Summary: I would definitely return to this lake, making the necessary adjustments to our equipment to fill the gap between the site deficiencies(as we always do) and our needs. Good luck on your trip regards, Mike"
6379710,Jack68133,2019-12-21 18:44:00,14,I have done a lot of Canadian fishing trips including a couple with Meta Lake Lodge. Brace Lake Outfitters is hands down the best camp we have ever been too. This guy is the first person I have ever seen any anything bad about the operation that Kyle and Terri run. I won't do a fly in trip anywhere else.
6379838,adempsey2.0,2019-12-22 13:46:00,611,"Yes, I was very skeptical when I read that post because I have read nothing but good reviews about the camp and the owners. It's almost as if he was at a completely different camp. That's why I wanted to see some pictures.Regardless, as we all know, there is no pleasing some people."
6379862,Carlbg7,2019-12-22 16:42:00,3,"In the past 5 years, I have stayed at both Brace Lake and Meta. 5 years ago I stayed at Brace Lake. Kyle tried very hard but the whole experience fell short. The cabin was OK but the toilet is a composting toilet. It never worked properly for the whole week. Kyle told us that the toilet was at capacity and that in order to flush, we had to go outside and crank the reservoir handle to make room. Not fun multiple time a day. We were on the modified American plan and the dinners were OK. The fishing was not good either. Kyle actually told us to go fish the river that connects Brace to Meta. They advertise that they catch all these pike over 30"" but 95% are around 20"" or so. The last 4 years we have gone to Meta. John and Cheryl run an excellent camp. 3 dock hands that help you dock your boat and help with your equipment. They have a camp fish fry on Wednesday and are always around to help with anything you need. I have recommended Meta to others but never Brace. I don't want them to be disappointed and I know they never will at Meta."
6344976,fishforlife,2019-07-28 18:48:00,77,"Anyone have any fishing reports for these lakes. 7 of us going in 26 days and would appreciate any updates on water levels, and fishing reports this year. Thanks in advance for your input."
6346966,Hit-em,2019-08-04 05:11:00,6,Fished with Brace Lake Outfitters this year ...not too impressed !The camp was very poorly run ..it seemed to us that they were doing everything on the cheap The cabins were mediocre at best ..boats were OK ..We had to laugh when we opened up our packed lunches ..the sandwich had one very thin slice of lunch meat ( paper thin ) between two slices of bread with allot of mustard ..we called them mustard sandwiches The lakes themselves are pretty shallow ..fishing was Ok ..we've had much better fishing on previous trips to other Canadian lodges I would look elsewhere if I was you Esganami Lodge out of Nakina would be a better choice ..much better run camp ..
6347070,Juls,2019-08-04 15:21:00,13414,"Sorry to hear about your bad experience. Move down to Meta Lake Lodge...John and Cheryl make your stay a memorable one! Great food, nice accommodations, and you can hit all three lakes from their lodge. Love their boats too...they use the wooden ones. It's a 23 minute flight out of Nakina."
6347212,Jdconins,2019-08-05 07:18:00,62,"Hello Juls:My names John the Janitor and I am here in Ohio and have been fishing the Erie Islands since I was a kid. My friend I believe is booking a spot on Meta next year, was wondering if you can give me some words of wisdom as to some of the good fishing spots on the lake? Connecting channel into Brace or Ara?Are you still booking charters for Walleye up that way? The central basis and eastern basin is on fire now. Thanks, Janitor"
6347734,fishforlife,2019-08-06 17:30:00,77,"Hit-em , thanks for your opinion. Personally I have been to Brace Lake since the current owners bought it and have had nothing but great experiences with them. I have taken almost 80 guests there who also share my sentiment. I can't help but think that if you would have shared your concerns with Kyle and Teri, they would have taken care of them. It's unfortunate that you feel this way, but I guess everyone's expectations are different. As far as the fishing, everyone's level of competency varies so there are to many variables to mention for failure. I hope you find what you're looking for at the other end of Meta, because my friends and I didn't. Wishing you the best in the future."
6347756,eyemike,2019-08-06 19:35:00,233,"I fished with Brace Lake Outfitters three years ago. Kyle and Teri are two of the most accommodating hosts that I have had the pleasure to meet. Their cabins were hand built by Kyle and Teri. Their boats are custom built wooden boats with casting decks, and I believe I had a 15 horse Johnson on it. Teri is in the cabins early am Saturday cleaning for the next guests. Their menu for the American Plan is as good as any high end restaurant. Between Brace and Meta we averaged 70 walleye a day between me and my wife, in August. I don't believe they just fell apart in such a short time."
6347838,MrSimon,2019-08-07 07:53:00,922,"I just looked at their website. The cabins are full log cabins with 24 hour electricity, wifi, full bath, running water, huge decks, and amazing views. They even include linens. The fishing in those lakes is widely known to be great ... with dozens of verifying reports posted on this site alone. To me it sounds like you couldn't catch fish and are just looking to complain .... and in reality the only thing you have to complain about is a sandwich."
6347856,Jdconins,2019-08-07 08:27:00,62,"Mr. Simon & fishforlife, I had thought my friend booked with Meta but found out that it is with Brace Lake Outfitters and looking forward to it. I'm sure we can find fish but was wondering if you could recommend any spots that you both thought were better than others. I have seen very positive things on this sight about this outfitter. Thank you!"
6348004,fishforlife,2019-08-07 16:33:00,77,"JD, when will you be going to Brace, and what is your target species ? Kyle will be more than happy to put you on fish."
6348294,Hit-em,2019-08-08 17:40:00,6,"LOL ..I guess everyone has a different opinion on what is first class & mediocre I guess we were put in the cabin that wasn't on the website ..our cabin has no full bath, the shower didn't work until we mentioned it to Kyle,after he fixed it we had a slow trickle ..the widows panes were made out cheap plastic, not plexiglass not glass but plastic that you could poke your finger through if you wanted too We were told when we got there we could make coffee in the cabin ..went to our cabin & find a sign over the sink ""Don't drink the water"" looked for drinking water found none in the cabin ..had to track Kyle down to get a case of water ..you would of thought every cabin would be stocked with bottled water...I guess that would be expecting too much We used the same towels for the whole week we were there, I guess the linden service missed our cabin The great views off the deck with no chairs were a few pine trees overlooking the lake The camp itself had muddy paths with a couple of boards thrown in them leading up to the lodge which was locked most of the day because Kyle & Teri were never there They had one kid that prepped the boats & that was it No extra help anywhere in the camp We were on the American plan & the only ones there at breakfast..not once could we order what we wanted for breakfast ..we were told Teri makes it before we get there, so we got what she made ..which was cold most of the time ..were told they have no Microwave to heat anything up We've been going up to Canada every year for over 20 years & perhaps have different expectations then some If you think this a first class & well run lodge then I hate to see what you think is isn't .. I'm not going to get into a pissing contest about this, if you like Brace Lodge that's great .. Good luck to anyone who's going there that hasn't been there before, I hope it works out for you & you have a great time .."
