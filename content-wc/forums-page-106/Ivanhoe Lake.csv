6376484,Lamp40,2019-12-08 07:21:00,30,Thanks tayzak15! I sent a pm.
6376606,MrSimon,2019-12-09 06:03:00,922,Sure!
6378360,Lamp40,2019-12-16 11:21:00,30,We ended up with Big Bear Camp on Horwood lake next August. Any info or suggestions would be great! Will definitely post a report then. Let the countdown begin!
6381504,Tayzak15,2019-12-29 00:43:00,48,Awesome you'll enjoy it there. Paul and Angie run a great Lodge. What time of year are you coming up you said? If you'd like a guide for a day feel free to send me a message!
6381722,Lamp40,2019-12-29 18:38:00,30,"We’ll be there the middle of August. Really looking forward to it! Hopefully the fishing is decent, and the bugs aren’t too bad, lol. we might be interested in a guide for a day, I will definitely keep you in mind, thanks!"
6381750,Sniper1980,2019-12-29 21:30:00,33,Yup. Excellent crappie fishing there as well
6381846,Lamp40,2019-12-30 09:20:00,30,First I’ve heard about crappie there. That’s a nice bonus.
6381866,Tayzak15,2019-12-30 10:38:00,48,There aren't any crappie there. Lamp depending on the weather beforehand the bugs shouldn't be too bad that time of year. August is probably my favorite month to fish for trophy's. I will pm you my email to get a hold of me.
6381898,Lamp40,2019-12-30 12:29:00,30,Thanks Tayzak! Sent a PM
6373728,Lamp40,2019-11-25 11:35:00,30,"I am looking for any info on fishing Ivanhoe lake in mid to late August. We are pretty restricted to that time frame. How crowded does Ivanhoe get that time of year? Also looking at Crotch Lake, although Crotch sounds more crowded. Thanks for any info."
6373730,MrSimon,2019-11-25 12:16:00,922,"There is a lot of info on both lakes on here. Run a search and you should find what you are looking for. If you mean Crotch Lake in SE Ontario .... it's a beautiful lake but the fishing is mediocre to bad for walleye and pike, but good for smallies."
6373744,Lamp40,2019-11-25 12:58:00,30,"Thanks MrSimon, I’ve searched on here so much I’m driving myself crazy trying to pick a lake! I’ve read several posts where the fishing seems to have changed from five years ago, so I’m just trying to getting the latest reports. We’re really looking for something less crowded, where we can catch some numbers, pike, bass, walleye, mostly catch and release. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Hopefully within 6 or 7 hours of the Soo."
6373758,MrSimon,2019-11-25 13:24:00,922,"That has always been my criteria as well .... ""lots of numbers and solitude within 7 hours of the Soo"". You can certainly get that at drive-in places around Wawa, Chapleau, Hornpayne, Longlac .... but man oh man what a difference an airplane makes. Take a flight out of White River, Nakina, or Hearst and you'll be blown away by how much better the whole experience is. Look up my recent report on Melchett Lake with Boreal Forrest Outfitters. I think you'll be surprised how cheap it is."
6373780,Lamp40,2019-11-25 14:38:00,30,"That does sound interesting, I will be checking that out, thanks."
6373930,adempsey2.0,2019-11-26 09:37:00,611,"I would look elsewhere. Check into Windemere (drive-to lodge and boat-in outpost), Lady Evelyn (boat-in lodges), Wenebegon (ATV-in outpost), Prairie Bee (drive-to lodge and boat-in outpost), Horwood (drive-to and boat-in lodges), Ramsey (boat-in lodge), Brunswick (boat-in lodge), Lac Kipawa (in Quebec, drive-to and boat-in lodges and outposts). Fishing on all those lakes is probably just ok. I have only been to 4 of them. Definitely fewer people though, especially if you choose an outpost.Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk"
6373964,Lamp40,2019-11-26 11:51:00,30,"Horwood is on the short list also, thanks for the reply!"
6373976,MrSimon,2019-11-26 13:26:00,922,"You can also look at Murray Lake Cottages, Five Mile Lake Lodge, and Moosehorn Lodge. All are nice drive-to lodges with very interesting options to get into less pressured lakes. Sometimes via an outpost, sometimes via long boat ride, and sometimes via logging roads in the bush. You kind of need to define what's most important to your group first. If it's just high numbers of fish, then a fly-in will crush almost all of the drive-to places (there are always exceptions to that rule). If it's a remote feel while on the water, then you're looking for big lakes or connected bodies of water to explore. If you want solitude while at the cabin, then you need an outpost. Also, you have to define ""high numbers"". If all you want is 10-20 fish per day, then by all means try any of the places listed. If you want 50-75 or more per day, then fly. Flying gives you numbers and ultimate solitude."
6376222,Lamp40,2019-12-06 16:20:00,30,Can I PM you MrSimon?
6376450,Tayzak15,2019-12-07 21:00:00,48,"Hey Lamp I'm from Timmins and do a bit of guiding on Horwood and Ivanhoe. There is alot of boat traffic on Ivanhoe for the size the lake is. That time of year is great for pulling crankbaits, jigging raps and harnesses. Out of the lakes you mentioned I would strongly recommend Horwood. There are 3 lodges on the lake, but boat traffic is pretty minimal. There's many types of structures and different ways to catch fish there as well. Out of the 3 Lodges I would recommend Big Bear. Feel free to ask any questions!"
