6340450,ziggyzag,2019-07-13 12:24:00,125,"This year a group of (12) of us headed to lake Kag out of Nakina using TLO the road trip up was great we saw 5 or 6 moose and black bears with no close calls. This would be our third trip to Kag over the past 30 years and we have always gone around the same time of year and the walleye and pike fishing has been great with an occasional lake trout thrown in for a change of pace. So the anticipation for this trip was very high concerning the fishing, the one thing we noticed the past two trips was the average size of the walleye and pike seemed to be above average on the Kag compared to other lakes we have fished out of Nakina. Sunday 6-2: Our flight in was on time and we needed two flights in to get our group in and as usual this happened without any hitches. The group was settled in to the two TLO cabins on the south west end of Kag around 9:00 am and the fishing began. As you might know Kag is a big body of water and we fished mostly around the camp the first day catching a few walleye (30) and some pike (25)with one laker (10lbs.) thrown in so we all thought we were off to a good start. Monday: The group split up to explore and try to locate some fish one group of (3) boats headed up Humble Bay while (3) boats headed out to the main lake to fish. To say we struggled would be an understatement as a group we caught around (50) walleye and (50) pike all day. Tuesday: The struggles continued trying to find active walleye fishing, we fished the incoming rivers which in the past trips was loaded with fish not to be this year and as a group we caught maybe (30) walleye and (50) pike for the day. Wednesday: We started to fish wind blown points and flats trying to figure things out with little success again we caught some fish (20) walleye and (30) pike with (1) laker thrown in. Just tough fishing, the one thing we noticed that we never seen before was the walleye had a white worm coming out of them we do not know what this was or how it might be effecting the fishing. Thursday, Friday & Saturday: Similar to Wednesday and maybe even a little slower we did pick up another Laker on Friday another nice fish around (10 lbs.) all and all this trip would turn out to be the slowest spring fishing we have ever experienced in all the years going to Nakina which has been for over 40 years. ""Better Luck Next Time"" As far as the trip goes we all had a great time being in camp together, we are almost all family and the few who are not family are considered family. I would like to thank Chad of TLO for his efforts the cabins, boats and motors where all up to snuff as usual. I would also like to thank Nakina Air Services for there on time and friendly flight services. Biggest Pike 40"" most pike averaged 30-36"" Biggest Walleye 28"" most walleye averaged 20-22"" Biggest Laker 10 lbs. we really do not fish for lakers just pick them up by accident trolling crank baits for pike and walleye. The trip back was uneventful which is a good thing, again we saw 5-6 moose and black bears and we all made it back to our home destination without incident. Thanks to all who went on this adventure as always it was a pleasure to spend a week bonding and enjoying the GREAT Canadian experience with you all. Until next spring when we will do it all over again (14) guys headed to Abamasagi with TLO can not wait! ""ZIGGYZAG"""
6340464,kona77,2019-07-13 13:58:00,236,Wow that was some challenging fishing.. Sounds like you tried a number of different approaches and locations to find fish.. Appreciate your perspective on the value of spending time with family/friends on a remote Canadian lake.
6340686,fishron,2019-07-14 12:03:00,317,Thanks for the report. Sounds like a great trip with friends which always trumps the fishing. Your note about the white worms caught my eye. Many of the walleye we cleaned on our Quebec trip had long white intestinal worms. I assume they were a type of fish tapeworm. They appeared confined to the gut and nothing in the flesh was evident. I always cook my fish well. No sushi.
6340716,stjoeguy,2019-07-14 13:25:00,979,"Thanks for the report. Sounds like a successful trip even though the fishing could have been better. 28"" and 40"" sound pretty good, though. Are countdown clowns still the bait of choice?"
6340920,gmattbruin,2019-07-15 07:03:00,174,"Hey Jeff....thx for the report on Kag. As you know our group stuck with Aba again.....for us, theres no point in changing up a good thing. Chad told us fri night prior to us going in, that across the board, all lakes in the 1st 2wks were having a tough go and the bite just wasnt happening yet. We lucked out.....the bite was on for week 3....and like we have nvr seen before...crazy good fishing. We are booked in for 3rd week again. Im guessing we will see your group on our way in or out. BTW....Make sure all 14 guys dont shower on fri ....it uses up all the battery for the pump..LOL See you next spring Jeff!!"
6340968,ziggyzag,2019-07-15 09:20:00,125,Yes the clown was in action but I would say the perch did a little better
