6287278,Rock Hound,2019-02-07 10:16:00,51,"I have stayed at both camps, but I have not stayed at Five Lakes Lodge with the new owners. I know they have improved the camp a great deal. I have also stayed at Golden Hook and Weaver's / Wright's. I have nothing but good things to say about Lee Wright, and his camp is where have stayed for the past several years. I have enjoyed every camp on Gullrock, and I think all of the owners work hard together to keep the lake thriving. If you are asking where to stay, I think you will have a great experience at either. Gullrock is a place you cannot lose. Enjoy your trip (I am really looking forward to ours)!"
6287698,Golden Eagle,2019-02-08 13:27:00,2642,"Bill, you left a great location. Same with Wendy. Not wanting to put down where you are now, but I sure liked your Gullrock home better. I met your wife around 1985 at her workplace and she gave me your name and phone number so I could contact you about a day of hunting muskies on Flat Lake. Tons of walleyes and huge pike on other waters kept my interest and Flat Lake never happened for me."
6289284,Habitual Eyer,2019-02-13 08:43:00,144,"I've stayed at most Camps around the lake. They are all good really. I am at Wrights mostly now. Location great, accommodations great, and Lee has been as good as any owners I have dealt with in the 30-40 years I have spent poking around Ontario walleye waters searching for a permanent spot. I'll bet Wrights return business and occupancy rate one of the highest on the whole system. If any truth to some of the garbage that got posted here I doubt that would be the case. Chsneyes pretty much exemplifies everything that is wrong with public forums and social media today."
6289344,Pezman38,2019-02-13 10:15:00,3196,"I have nothing but good things to say about Lee and Stephanie Wright. Went there for years until kids and a busy life kept me from going. I miss seeing them to be honest. My dad and my original crew are still going to Wrights camp, I think they have been for 32 years now and 3 different owners if I recall correctly.It is hard to find a cabin in July and August still.They invest a lot of money in new cabins and I think almost all are less than 10 years old now (guessing).Nice camp boats to rent as well.I have never seen Lee fish in the method mentioned earlier, he can find his own fish. When I see him take out a guest who might be struggling I usually see him all alone, looking just like most do. The only thing bad about Lee is that he is decent at poker and likes to take more of our money than just in lodging :-) Perhaps we just suck though.Glad to hear a few other places are good as well though.Picture below is when my boat was rigged at Wrights back in 2009!"
6289448,Habitual Eyer,2019-02-13 14:19:00,144,"Your post Chsneyes is so out of line, personal, and mean/hurtful. What kind of person jumps on out of the blue and does that? You're one messed up dude. Moderator..any way you can make this guy go away ?"
6340970,Guest,2019-07-15 09:25:00,0,Any updates? Did you go? How was it? Seem to be a lot guys asking for input but never follow thru.... Hope you had a great week!
6341278,Laker10,2019-07-16 07:19:00,100,"Here's a report from my stay from last week.....My wife and I stayed at 5 Lakes Lodge for the second year in a row, fishing was great even with a mayfly hatch. Ian is a great guy, knows the lakes and will help you get on fish. We will be going again next year."
6283242,martinbns,2019-01-27 18:53:00,1520,WE fished with Ian a couple of years ago and had a great time. Is your handle a development in Winnipeg?
6283266,Bergy,2019-01-27 19:55:00,83,How long does it take to get to these camps from International Falls/Fort Francis. Are there good numbers of Walleye to be caught? Are the lakes mappped for Humminbird electronics?
6283272,Guest,2019-01-27 20:23:00,0,"Roughly 5 hours, you could get it in 4 if leave pedal down. Very good numbers of walleye Navionics has OK map, not sure what the new lakemaster chip has"
6283274,Chsneyes,2019-01-27 20:31:00,2,"I've read as a guest for awhile and knew if I posted as a ""guest"" I would get slammed, guess it doesn't matter...... I guess when you guys stay here for a week to fish you know it all. I have a summer cabin up on red so am on lake a lot more. So I am just sharing what info I see and hear thru town. He has admitted he has lied about what being caught in his camp to make his camp look better what a joke. Just be honest and let the lake support your business. Not telling everyone a 28-29"" walleye is a 30+"". Either way it's a nice fish...."
6283276,jkwildhunting,2019-01-27 20:34:00,361,"Another vote for 5 lakes Lodge. Great location, great fishing and even better host!!!"
6283284,sagecreek,2019-01-27 21:18:00,24,"yup, originally I was tackleman, then I couldn't sign in with that when they changed some kind of protocol , then I went to gullrockguy, but seeing as how I am now a city dweller I figured it was time for a new name,"
6283286,sagecreek,2019-01-27 21:21:00,24,"hey joe, sorry I missed you this year, had to work too much, now that i'm fully retired I may see you if the wife lets me leave Winnipeg and get my boat out on the lake. \bill"
6283290,AllenW,2019-01-27 21:47:00,11482,"You could always stay at Red and skip the slot limit bs, some decent fishing in the ckuni (sp?) river also if you decide to fish Gullrock. fwiw, Gull was the only lake I ever had someone back troll into me while we were slow jigging, watch the tourists.. Good fishing though. If you come out of the river from Red, head north along the west side of the lake, you'll find a sandy beach in a little bay, fish the underwater point there or around that area. Jigs and minnows worked for us. Al"
6283324,martinbns,2019-01-28 05:53:00,1520,I could be called IslandLakesman
6286416,Mondo,2019-02-04 12:07:00,61,"Ian and Drew are the best hosts you can find. I've been coming up to Red Lake and Gull Rock for 25+ yrs, and multiple times per year at that. Nobody knows the lake better than Ian. He has won the Red Lake Fall Classic and frequently in the top 20 teams. That doesn't happen by luck! Clean camp, great people and amazing fishing. Many guests renew every year which says a lot in itself."
6282616,Bringwolski,2019-01-25 12:00:00,7,Hi does anybody have any recent experience between these two camps? I've looked through the searches and dont find much on Five lakes lodge from the past few years.
6282628,Walleye2242,2019-01-25 12:38:00,263,i can only comment on wrights. stayed there many times. Lee is awesome. great cabins and boats. I assume pretty much every camp on gullrock has nice cabins and boats or they couldnt compete. for me...i think wrights location is what makes if for me. closer to fishing spots and can get up towards Keg lake easier as well. Just my opinion and 5 lakes probably has great hosts and cabins as well.
6282680,johnboat,2019-01-25 16:48:00,2014,"Five Lakes for me. 17 years in a row, at least one trip a year. The up graded camp boats at 5 Lakes Lodge are better than what some people pull up there."
6282856,sagecreek,2019-01-26 15:28:00,24,"both camps are good, I would think it depends on what you are looking for, I haven't been into wrights in a few years but I heard they upgraded their cabins since I was last there. \\ five lakes is a great spot to be, the owners are friends of mine and used to be my neighbours up until they bought the camp a few years ago. I should say I just moved from living on gullrock this past winter and I use five lakes to gas up and get my minnows (as a favour to me) . ian and drew will ensure you have a great time at their camp and they also have outlying lakes you can day trip into. as far as fishing , it doesn't get much better for walleye, there are northerns of all sizes and trophy size walleye. BUT, you should note all camp owners on gullrock have a rule that NO walleye or northerns over the slot size be kept and brought into camp. this has been their practice for a number of years and the fishing has progressed impressively because of it. Even though the regs say you can keep 1 over the 18 inch size limit the camps don't allow it. hope this helps"
6282882,Chsneyes,2019-01-26 18:30:00,2,"Too me location means very little on lake like that. I would pick hospitality over location any day of week. Five lakes would be my pick. I have NEVER stayed at Wright's camp and I will NEVER STAY THERE!! I have seen how Lee is on the lake and how he ""bashes"" his American guest on not catching fish. (Obviously he can't find find fish himself ) Yet, he is the first guy to bust into or use the Iowa fish finder (binoculars) and fish right next to you. Then the next day he sends his entire camp to that spot. Pretty disrespectful for an owner which many may not know his boat. The lake is big there are a ton of spots to fish. I have friends who stay with Ian and Drew and have always heard positive reports from them. Ian use to be a guide and most def is the better fisherman and more respectful. They have told me how much he will help guest in camp get on fish, mark maps up for guest. Lee spends more time on the lake then he obviously does in his own camp. Which I guess if you have a dock hand you can go fish on other camp guest to find the ""spot""."
6282924,outdoorsron,2019-01-26 22:29:00,843,Hello: Have fished Gullrock for a long time. Was at Wrights before it was Wrights when it was Weavers. Stayed at Wrights many times. Never had a bad experience at Weavers or Wrights. Never noticed any thing like what Chasneyes talked about. Never been to Five Lakes so I can't comment on them. Just find it suspicious that Chsneyes just joined Walleye Central Jan. of 19. Just Sayin. Good Luck . O - R
6282930,tyeegs,2019-01-26 23:38:00,177,"Ian and Drew are great. Ian will guide on request and knows Red Lake down to Gull Rock like no other. I don't know Wrights, only Howey Bay and Five lakes, but Ian won't disappoint."
6282948,Jeler,2019-01-27 05:06:00,92,"I'd have to agree. Haven't fished either of these areas but it does smell a bit ""fishy""! Yet, perhaps it just a feud ramping up!"
6283000,Walleye2242,2019-01-27 07:20:00,263,"Agreed....I have known Lee for a long time. This is a complete lie. I have spoken to Ian a few times and he is very nice as well. You will not go wrong in either spot but to bash Lee is not right. Those camp owners on gullrock on running million dollar camps/business, you dont get that way by doing things wrong. I am sure both camps run a very nice business."
6283224,The tank,2019-01-27 18:11:00,340,Your first post is this??? Come on!! I agree with walleye2242.
