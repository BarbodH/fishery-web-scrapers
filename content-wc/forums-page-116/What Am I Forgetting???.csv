6340284,Sportdog,2019-07-12 22:18:00,6735,"I forgot three things. First, my fishing skills have deteriorated after 8 1/2 months away from fishing northern waters so I didn't bring my A game. Secondly, I brought my Michigan tackle box instead of my Canada tackle box. That actually proved not to be a problem. And last but not least, I forgot what a jerk a Canadian Customs Agent can be. I didn't let him ruin my trip though!!! Can't wait until next year to do it all again........ Thanks to The Lord for the opportunity to enjoy a week in a special place with special people."

6341152,dosxx,2019-07-15 18:49:00,60,"Despite my detailed list complete with check marks next to “underwear” I arrived at our island outpost this past week with only the pair I had on. Luckily I was loaned (OK, given) a pair and I washed a pair once a day and wore the other and repeated the process all week. In our group’s defense I was offered a total of three but I made due with one plus mine. That was a first for me with 25 plus years of Canadian adventures."
6337408,Aspencreek,2019-07-03 15:14:00,2911,"it seems that at least for me it's something that I get ready/pack and then just forget to put it in the truck.....so to overcome my dyslexia and forgetfullnes in my excitement to get going, I too have a list of items that dates back to 2000. Some thing are added and ones removed for lack of use or uselessness. So I open an area in the garage for all my things on the list and start a pile. Then everything is inventoried the night before leaving and placed in the truck. Try and get a good nights sleep and just load up the coffee cup and I'm out. Haven't forgotten anything for the last several trips. Good Luck, not everyone can be as anal about this stuff as I am."
6337630,andreindy,2019-07-04 12:45:00,308,"I get a chuckle reading these stories. Our issue last year on our fly-in came down to forgetting an Allen Wrench. THAT allen wrench is what tightens the transducer puck to the bracket. Missing that single, little wrench cost us a lot of grief...."
6337640,Hook_settr,2019-07-04 14:16:00,127,I also make lists and they serve many purposes. First and foremost they are an excellent way to dang near eliminate forgetting anything. They also help organize who is bringing what so that we don’t end up with 12 cans of Crisco and 1 box of breading. My buddies all poke fun at me and call me anal retentive which I will admit to. But I’m also quick to point out how smoothly our trips usually go because of my lists. Another upside to using lists is that it gives me something to fidget with during the long days leading up to our next trip.
6337668,Aspencreek,2019-07-04 15:32:00,2911,"Exactly, and the guy who gives me the most grief, last November on a 5 day trip to south Dakota Pheasant hunting, you will never guess who forgot to pack his boots. So he heads to Cabelas in Mitchell on day 1 for a new pair, an 1.5hr drive away, and then complains about having to break in his boots all week."
6337788,btyreprich,2019-07-05 04:49:00,1067,"I have been using two lists: one for groceries / meals and the other for other items. Have a clip board which I use when grocery shopping as well as packing the car. Happy to say that I have not forgotten anything i many years. One ride home, I go through the grocery list and make changes to reflect what food items were / were not popular. The clip board makes it easy to write on in the car. That list gets printed off the computer when I start shopping a good month before we leave for Canada. I know many guys buy their groceries on the ride up to Canada but I prefer to buy while at home. This allows me the opportunity to shop weekly sales and freeze certain items."
6337802,port1042,2019-07-05 06:53:00,509,"I always have a list. My grocery list the most fun. It includes both the shopping list and the menu. I play with it between trips and it keeps me feeling like I'm doing something useful. I've got 4 years (9 trips) of lists and menus in a single spreadsheet each on their own page so I can easily reference previous years and make adjustments. Being the chef I'm also the ""grocery getter"". If we forget something it's on me. One year I forgot to pack the frozen food in the cooler. What a shock when unloaded at the cabin. No brats, no steaks, no pizza. That was several years ago and I still hear about it. We wasted an afternoon driving to a grocery store. My spread sheet has a column for ""got it"" and also for ""packed"". I check it twice just like Santa."
6337872,Aspencreek,2019-07-05 09:39:00,2911,"My list is exactly the same as yours. great minds think alike. As camp cook you get a great deal of satisfaction from knowing everyone is getting fed and fed well, my wife has no idea how well we eat on these trips, and I'm not telling!! I buy everything at home and pack it and freeze it, with the exceptions of the items I can't bring across. Those items are purchased at the grocery store in Fort Francis on the trip up. Those items being, bread, buns, potatoes, onions, milk, OJ, Chicken and anything else that looks yummy, they have/had a really good bakery. besides if I left it up to some of these guys we would have cereal for breakfast, dry sandwiches for lunch, and fish for dinner everyday. We have our fish, but we also will have rib eyes, grilled chicken, I have done a whole Ham, Chicken Marinara, and much more."
6337948,Pink Unicorn,2019-07-05 12:44:00,83,"A few years ago, I forgot to purchase the entire second page of my checklist. No toilet paper, paper towels, etc. That was a rough year!"
6337996,PRO-V16,2019-07-05 15:59:00,454,No toilet paper is definitely a trip wrecker. Me and a buddy were grouse hunting way back in the bush once and he had to go. Asked if I had paper which I didn't used to carry back then. No green leaves to be found. I noted the nice new pair of fuzzy yellow work gloves he just bought. He came back out of the brush only sporting one but said it worked quite well.

6337168,Sportdog,2019-07-02 20:00:00,6735,"Headed north to Canada Friday for one of my yearly fishing trips and in the finishing touches of readiness. Soooo, what am I forgetting? Every time I go, I always forget something. But the worst item forgotten was a belt for my pants. Rope works, but not well and definitely not a fashion statement. Any horror stories or things forgotten that made a negative impact on your trip? Thanks for sharing."
6337176,ddeleo72,2019-07-02 20:14:00,1,I make my yearly list and take it with me on my trip. when I forget something or think of something else I want to bring I write it on the list right then. Works well for me. last trip I forgot my table and ziplock bags...
6337178,Carnhzkr,2019-07-02 20:14:00,964,"I had told this story once before but I remember one trip many years ago when I used to go to Canada. My mom was responsible for packing all of the food and my dad's clothes. Once we reached the primitive camp site, my mom realized she forgot to throw in the duffel containing all of my dad's clothes. That didn't bother my dad a lot since he was a farmer and used to being dirty. He wore the clothes he drove up with for as long as he could then my mom gave him a extra sweatshirt she'd packed for herself. He spent the rest of the trip wearing a light blue sweatshirt with a teddy bear on the front."
6337182,SteveJ715,2019-07-02 20:19:00,59,"Passport has been at the #1 spot in bold on my list for a few years now. 2-3 years ago, my Dad lost his passport somewhere along the way -- had it at the border, then lost it. He and his buddy went thru all their stuff at the cabin, twice. Eventually they boated back to their vehicle (they were staying at a boat-in cabin.) Eventually located his passport -- inside the ziplock bag he kept it in, sticking to the roof after the heavy rain in the days prior. He figures that when they were unloading to boat over to the cabin, he put it on the roof above the driver's side door, just to set it down and grab something else -- then left it there for 3 days. Because of the ziplock it was undamaged, and because of the rain, a good gust of wind didn't blow it into the lake. Amazing."
6337202,The tank,2019-07-02 23:18:00,340,One year a guy in our group forgot his tackle box with his jigs at home. We do a boat in resort so no real easy way to go get any. Lucky for him I have almost a tackle store in my boat. I have a Lakeland tackle box that holds 5 Plano 3700 boxes all full of different kinds-sizes and colors of jigs. People laugh at me for having that many but 2 years after that we had a boat of 3 guys with us who didnt have many jigs with them and we saved the trip for them too.

When we got back to the cabin, there was the bag with my rain gear, right next to the door where I wouldn't forget it! Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"

6337248,stjoeguy,2019-07-03 07:03:00,979,"Every trip has some sort of forgotten item. One year we forgot to pack the groceries from the downstairs freezer. Many years ago we used to buy groceries at the Safeway in Dryden on the way up. Everyone would grab a cart and head off into the store, reporting back occasionally to the guy with the list. It wasn't until later in the week after missing items that we realized we'd left one shopping cart in the store. The worst was forgetting two limits in the fly-in cabin freezer on the way back. Oh yeah, then there was the time I forgot to stop at the duty-free pickup shack before crossing the bridge into Canada to get the booze we had just purchased. There were long lines of trucks so we walked back across the bridge to get it. You only do that once (hopefully). Forgotten items just add to the trip memories. Have a great time!"
6337276,Ricky Spanish,2019-07-03 08:46:00,1298,"I forgot my belt and my wife forgot her new rain gear. Good thing her old stuff was still in the dry bag with mine and I had some anchor rope to encircle my oversized waist. The belt rack at Canadian Tire didn't come close to my size. On a side note, we drove to Dryden to replace the pump on my Engel bait cooler for the 2nd time in 3yrs. I won't be buying another Engel pump. Ended up with a Frabill that uses 2 D batteries but it worked well for the rest of our trip."
