Feel free to pm me if you would like. Thanks in advance, John"

6306500,MrSimon,2019-04-01 11:08:00,922,"I've been smallie fishing on Windermere (connected to Prairie Bee) in July and had a great time. We had our best luck in 4-12' of water that had big boulders. Or, in bays with rocky shores when the wind is blowing in. Wind was very important! There is endless habitat for smallies in Prairie Bee. Just keep moving until you hit a pod. It shouldn't take long."

6306550,pikeandtina,2019-04-01 13:07:00,145,"Thanks Mr. Simon, I'm sure the two lakes are similar! John"

6307136,pikeandtina,2019-04-03 03:56:00,145,"Appreciate it, Mondo. Think I read about that in one of the old threads/posts."
6334958,nightowl,2019-06-26 20:29:00,3,Went there for years in mid July. Stayed at the outpost camp so only fished that side mainly. Jig shallow water over humps for walleye. When we first started going in 2000 there we're no smallmouth. Only caught them when walleye fishing. If you have the opportunity to get over to soretooth lake it is worth it. Big pike and walleye.Are the boys still running the camp?
6335000,pikeandtina,2019-06-27 02:15:00,145,"Yes, apparently so, Nightowl."
