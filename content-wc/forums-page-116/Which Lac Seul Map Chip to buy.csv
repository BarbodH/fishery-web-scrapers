6341308,Pooch,2019-07-16 08:35:00,4618,"That there are many, many hazards that are NOT on any maps. You just can't go busting around LS wide open throttle and care free.Case in point: #1 Last week we were in camp and when we came back to camp someone was loading a boat back onto the trailer with an open gash in the bottom below the water line. Appeared to also be some engine damage. I did not see it, but our other boat watched as they loaded.#2 Also, last week I was in a known (to me) area with no marked hazards on my Navionics chip and moving at just above idle and killed a prop when I went from 10-15' of water to about one foot. With the lake a little below normal this year what was OK a couple years ago was not OK this year. I was gawking around and drifted too far to the side. I just wasn't thinking and good thing I carry a spare prop.#2 Again last week, Saw another guy changing out a prop at the dock the day we arrived.Don't assume anything regarding a safe depth on LS. The (only) one good thing about low water is it reveals a lot of hazards I did not know were there so I can mark them with a red X as a waypoint.Boat safe and leave a few (fish) for the rest of us.Pooch"
6341310,jb_wi,2019-07-16 08:39:00,212,Point taken and will definitely take it slow. Looking forward to our first ever trip to Lac Seul..hoping to come home with the lower unit...and lower boat..still in one piece!
6340496,jb_wi,2019-07-13 16:49:00,212,Headed to Lac Seul in a few weeks. I have a Gen 3 Helix...what would be the best mapping chip to buy? Mainly looking to avoid major hazards and will autochart any prime fishing areas if I want more accurate detail.Thanks
6340526,tandm,2019-07-13 18:03:00,679,"I have the Navionics HotMaps platinum, running on a Helix 9. Navigation routes are, or have been so far, accurate. Many navigation hazards are marked, but, it's not perfect. I have found a number of sunken islands and reefs that are not on the chart."
6340628,eyecatcher1,2019-07-14 08:18:00,323,I have an older Gen 2 touch unit with the Navionics North chip and it is really accurate up there. I do slow down when I get off the safe trail or go places that I'm not familiar with though.
6340664,David Anderson,2019-07-14 10:41:00,2073,"The only good chip out there is the Navionics. As previously stated the North includes the northern US plus a portion of Ontario which includes Lac Seul. The good thing about the Navionics is that it is quite accurate on the Land/water representation, as stated the ""houseboat"" routes are very accurate. Most of the hazards are marked, however not all hazards are marked and not all marks are hazards but it is good enough to pay close attention to any stated hazard. Go to Navionics website and you can look at all of their charts. This should be the Bear Narrows area of Lac Seul https://webapp.navionics.com/?lang=e...y=wztrHr%7BspP I was talking to the Navionics guy at Cabela's a few weeks ago. When you buy a new chip you will automatically have 1 year of free upgrades plus Sonar Charts Live. He showed me when running the Navionic chip make sure the Sonar Charts Live option is turned on. Basically as people use their Sonar Charts Live on Lac Seul it will up load the map data (Not way points or your personal information) then add them to your chip when you update yours. It is important to update your data often to take advantage of any new depth information. He did show me areas on Lac Seul where he had quite accurate depth information"
6340886,jb_wi,2019-07-14 21:50:00,212,Thank you for the info guys. Much appreciated
6340902,h8go4s,2019-07-15 05:56:00,1673,How do you deal with water level fluctuation from spring to fall on waters like Lac Seul? Seems you'd have to reference to a known spot every time you launch.
6340912,David Anderson,2019-07-15 06:29:00,2073,"Ron, When dealing with Lac Seul everything is a reference point. If there is a hazard it is usually based on the high water mark. In the spring you can see most of the red marks sticking out of the water. Common sense goes a long ways when boating on Lac Seul. For instance, the houseboat trails are good all season. Because of the water fluctuations and the fact that there is really no accurate depth maps anyway, even a Sonar Charts Live map is reference. If it shows a hump at 20 feet, it will be 18 in the spring and maybe 21 at the end of July, again reference. At least you know where the hump is, more than what is shown on the standard map."
6340946,jb_wi,2019-07-15 07:58:00,212,Just to verify..the one recommended here is the Navionics Hotmaps Platinum North..is that correct?
6341206,David Anderson,2019-07-15 22:33:00,2073,yes. https://www.navionics.com/usa/charts...sPlatinum&fn1/
6341306,Bob/MN,2019-07-16 08:35:00,178,Lake Master has a Kenora Lac Seul map. The Rep. could not tell me how far SE the map covered. :-(
