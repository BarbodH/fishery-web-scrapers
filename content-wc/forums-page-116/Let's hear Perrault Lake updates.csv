6331726,team walleye,2019-06-17 05:54:00,336,"Thank BornToFish! I will post a report when we get back. BearFvr was nice enough to give me a pretty detailed report of his first week. Looking forward to the trip! Like I told BearFvr before, we have a few first timers headed up with us."
6331836,Aspencreek,2019-06-17 10:42:00,2911,And that is why I LOVE my friday to friday camp!!!!!
6339810,bearfvr13,2019-07-11 21:02:00,174,"One more day of fishing left. Here is a couple photos of our week. Walleyes are on humps. (And suspended in deep water) Muskies seemed to go after smaller profile baits. We have boated around 45-50 walleyes between 24-27 inches. (That's not a typo) We only caught 6 eaters so far. (UGH). My son hasn't sent me all the pictures yet,.....so here is a couple that I had on my phone. The one muskie was anorexic!!!"
6339812,bearfvr13,2019-07-11 21:05:00,174,Here's a couple more.
6340790,bearfvr13,2019-07-14 16:35:00,174,"I'd like to also add that I caught quite a few walleyes on paddle tails and the curly tail grubs. I would sit on the humps and throw out into the deeper water, wait for it to sink a little, then start reeling and get ready. They meant business when they grabbed it. Jig and minnows was probably the best option, but plastics were definitely an option. Our camp put in quite a few waypoints in their new fish finders of humps and flats and drop offs where walleye are. Never found any crappie, and the bigger perch seemed to be a step ahead of us!! Bass, UGH, I couldn't stay away from them, I don't mind catching them, but they seemed to be everywhere I went!! (Deeper and shallow). Muskie seemed to be found in wind blown areas and definitely chased smaller sized baits. Good luck to anybody heading there! Chuck"
6340878,team walleye,2019-07-14 20:39:00,336,Sounds like you guys did fantastic! That's great your camp puts in waypoints for their guests! That would be a big selling point for them over some of the other camps in the lake I have stayed at.
6325058,bearfvr13,2019-05-25 19:49:00,174,"Perrault Lake people, let's hear your updates on this post. Heading up on the 7th of June and July 5th. Can't wait to hear some reports!! (Water temps, is the water high, low, average, etc. etc.) Thanks, Chuck"
6325332,BornToFish,2019-05-26 19:43:00,1224,"Greetings, I just returned from the Red Lake area. I stopped at the wayside on the west end of Perrault Lake - along Hwy 105. The lake level was up from last year. Having said this, the lake could still use some more water. I chatted with some anglers that were on Perrault Lake last week. They reported good success in Ord River, which suggests to me that there is enough current to keep the walleyes in the river. Even though ice-out was ""near normal"" (whatever that is), the spring weather thus far has been remarkably cool in Sunset Country. Water temperatures were running 48-52 degrees on the lakes that I was fishing - definitely cooler than the last several years. BearFvr: I hope that you and your son make some great memories together on your upcoming trips! Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6325340,bearfvr13,2019-05-26 19:52:00,174,"Thank you BTF, always great to hear from you!! Chuck"
6331498,bearfvr13,2019-06-16 10:33:00,174,"Very productive year. Found walleye in 6-14 feet of water. We actually didn't notice a ""morning"" or ""evening"" bite,...it was a solid bite ALL day long. When an area slowed, we moved on to another spot that they were biting. Live bait prevailed over anything else. We caught lots of eaters, lots of 20-22 inchers, and quite a few around the 25in mark. My son had the biggest, 25.5. He caught a couple muskies that were around the 38in mark. Most fish were caught in wind blown spots, not all, but most. We went lite this time, lighter line, lighter jigs, etc. Got another trip in July, I'm sure it's gonna be a little harder for us, but after this trip we feel pretty confident. Thanks to all who help people like me who need help!!!!! Chuck"
6331588,team walleye,2019-06-16 16:05:00,336,"Nice work! We head up on Saturday. After reading Borntofish's book, I will definitely being going lighter as well."
6331638,bearfvr13,2019-06-16 19:11:00,174,"I forgot to add about the road construction,......no problems or delays on any highway in Canada,......however,....coming back to the USA was a 1hr and 27min wait to get back across!! I've seen a long line before, but never this long!! (Lost my passport in the lake, was hoping the US wouldn't let me back in!!!!!!)"
6331642,team walleye,2019-06-16 19:18:00,336,"Wow, never seen it bat long coming back."
6331644,ILScott,2019-06-16 19:21:00,139,It was over an hour at 11 am on Saturday June 8th.
6331662,bearfvr13,2019-06-16 20:14:00,174,"We watched people running out of their vehicles and heading into McDonalds and other businesses just to relieve themselves!! The lady at the border asked how long we have waited, I told her and she said that's crazy!"
