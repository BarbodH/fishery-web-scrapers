6340524,johnboat,2019-07-13 18:01:00,2014,I tied mine into my home owners insurance for a fraction of the price with the same coverage.
6340554,Huntindave,2019-07-13 20:20:00,2194,I don't see how anyone would want to take the liability risk. Even if I only had a junker boat (or car for that matter) a personal injury accident could put you in the poor house.
6340556,GBS,2019-07-13 21:10:00,2271,"Give Bob at WorldWide Marine (noted in the Insurance part of this forum) a call. Fast, painless, and pretty inexpensive for all the coverages noted above - plus theft. Glad I had it a couple of years ago when someone lifted all my tackle bags and rods out of the boat!"
6340638,reddemon2,2019-07-14 08:44:00,255,"Guess I need to say I meant insurance on a camp boat, Kinda obvious if I had my own"
6340640,mlg,2019-07-14 08:54:00,9,"spend the $50 bucks, I fished the goon several yrs ago, destroyed lower unit. Didn't opt for the boat insurance, I had insurance on my own boat and they eventually paid off. For the peace of mind I wish I had bought it, however, get your current boat policy out and look at the section regarding temporary substitute."
