Water can be accessed by 4-wheeler and boat trailer from an old road and boat launch on the south/east side of the lake, or fly-in. Either jig and minnow, or night crawlers will catch you walleye. Look on a map, about three quarters of a mile from the cabin down the shoreline to the south-west there is an point with a small island 500' directly south of it, that area off the point will be a spot you will want to check out, there are a lot of the right things going on there."
