6340748,Hook_settr,2019-07-14 14:57:00,127,What’s the status of taking fresh produce into Canada? I’m heading up to LOTW at the end of August and thought the resort owner might like some garden grown tomatoes and/or sweet corn.
6340852,btyreprich,2019-07-14 19:16:00,1067,I'm pretty sure that all fresh vegetables & fruits must be commercially packaged. This way the border guards know the item has been washed and inspected for insects and diseases.
6340858,txk4,2019-07-14 20:04:00,31,"We cross 5-6 times a year at Warroad, on our way to the NWA/LOTW. Always take fresh produce that we have grown or bought at a farm stand. During the winter we take produce we have canned or frozen ourselves. Have never been asked about it and it has never been a problem. We find fresh sweet corn to be especially appreciated. Have a great trip.t"
