6337480,jsmyers,2019-07-03 20:32:00,198,"As I written before, my family has a long history on Wabaskang, but we unfortunately cannot still call ourselves regulars. We went most every year for about two decades starting in the early to mid 1970s. I started coming in 1985 when my dad took me out of kindergarten so I could join them at the age of five. We stopped going for a number of reasons in about 1994, chief of these was my grandfather Joe Myers' health and mobility. Grandpa died in 2007. My cousin Tom and I took the reins of the trip planning and returned to Wabaskang in 2011 to celebrate our tradition with him. New jobs, babies, etc got in the way, but we also got another trip to Wine Lake in 2016. This year we're brought our wives and children to introduce them to Wabaskang and to start a new tradition. We're a group of three couples and three children. We generally target northerns, using spoons, spinners, etc.My family flew to MSP, got a car and hit the road with Tom's family and made it to a hotel in Dryden late on Friday night (6/21). My parents had taken a lengthy road trip to beat us there earlier in the afternoon. Tom and I finished off our shopping list early in the morning. (I'll get the time-lapse video up for you to enjoy.)Saturday 6/22: We arrive at camp around noon. After getting unpacked and organized, we get on the water just before 3 PM to get everybody's feet wet, fishing at the first narrows, the nearby cove, and Perrault Falls. My cousin gets the first fish, a 24 northern (species #1). I get my first-ever musky (approximately 37) near the narrows (species #2). It was a little touch and go in the boat with a slightly too-small net. I was barking orders like a drill sergeant. The fish went into the net and back outwhich usually results in disaster. We got a bigger net from my cousin's boat and successfully landed the fish. Apparently, this particular fish has been caught many times already this season by Sleepy Dog guests. I removed a small gold hook on a snap swivel from her jaw, so somebody else almost caught it. Through the rest of the afternoon, most everybody gets a fish, but the action isn't fast. I am bummed to lose a nice bass to broken line after I'm hung up twice on the rocks and forget to check the line. (Doh!)In the evening, my cousin and I fish around gut island and the islands west of it, casting and trolling a number of different lures to the rock reefs and weedbeds. If I remember correctly, we are completely skunked. Surface water temps for the day are ~67-69 degrees."
6337482,jsmyers,2019-07-03 20:37:00,198,"Sunday 6/23: We head to Keynote very late in the morning, fishing on both sides and through the narrows. We do well on small pike, under breezy, partly cloudy skies midday. We also catch a few perch (species #3) and a walleye (#4). If I remember correctly, surface temps down there are in the low 70s. In the evening, the three camp veterans head to the mouth of the big lake, the island southwest of the narrows, and second narrows. The weather is pretty calm, and we don't catch anything in the weedbeds in the lake, getting a couple of small fish around the island and then a 29 slot northern trolling from the narrows toward the reservation. Surprisingly, temps are in the low 70s out in the big lake too. I now realize that they were cooler by the island, so I suspect that we could have found some weedbeds by cooler water away from the mount of the narrowsbut we never looked. My mom had baked a birthday cake with my youngest daughter for my oldest daughter, who turned ten a few days earlier, so we enjoy the cake about two hours after normal bedtime!"
6337484,jsmyers,2019-07-03 20:42:00,198,"Monday 6/24: Another late start. (We've found that the kids need more sleep than the four hours of dark can provide!) It is cool and cloudy. We stop briefly at second narrows. I catch a 32 northern. Then we head to the portage (Williams Falls) to fish that area and have lunch. My youngest (six) had been rigged up with a worm and bobber for perch. She caught a nice 12.5 perch. There are tailing fish just upstream of the falls, which causes some excitement. I tie on a black marabou hair jig and land two nice smallmouth in two casts (species #5, ~15 and ~18). One of them had fish eggs in its mouth. My theories are that either the current is pulling the perch spawn out of the weeds, or that suckers are spawning.Wine Lake Camp's new shuttle boat approaches, so we scramble to free up their dock space. My dad is casting a mepps and sees a huge school of small perch, and a light goes off. He motors over and grabs my six-year-old. She proceeds to land about a baker's dozen of them, having a lot of excitement from missing fish and watching them fight over her worm. She did well so far, but it was a real confidence boost for her to catch so many fish. She fills the livewell, though we threw the very small ones back after a picture at the dock. While the two of them are on one side of the river making a fun racket, the rest of us move over to the shore on the NE side of the river to keep the dock open. Some of us cast spoons downstream of the falls. I can now see that the tailing fish are suckers. My wife free-lines a half of crawler and catches one! (Species #6).I want to check out the humps in Mean Lake on the way to Gawleys Bay. I find one of the humps and then see that two marker bouys are already on it. What I find is a featureless bottom about 13-14' deep. I'd never fished these before, but I had been expecting weeds. Perhaps they haven't grown in yet? I fruitlessly cast different lures, hoping for a big northern. We then go to troll the weedbed northwest from the third narrows. I find that the weed edge is pretty consistent at ten feet. We don't get anything but one tentative follow. (There have been a lot of pike follows during the day.) The folks in Gawleys haven't caught anything (maybe one fish). It starts to rain just as we leave to head back. We get in before the bad rain. Later on, it dries up and we enjoy some smores after dinner."
6337488,jsmyers,2019-07-03 20:46:00,198,"Tuesday 6/25: Change of morning strategy; the camp veterans get up quietly at 5 AM to help everybody else sleep in without us carrying on about burning daylight. I grab some minnows and we head to the first narrows. I've got a drop-shot rig set up. I catch one smallish walleye pretty quickly. We don't usually target walleyes, and especially with bait. I'm feeling pretty good about showing my dad and cousin something new but we cannot repeat. No more walleye, but we do get a small bass from the narrows. We head over to the falls to try there, but don't get anything. We do catch pike in the weeds around the three camps. And then find some perch near the three islands in the first lake. It is very sunny and a little breezy, seems like a cold front, but the temperature isn't much different. In general, the fishing is slow.Later in the afternoon the wind has picked up. We try to duck behind the islands and head to the NW side of the second lake. My boat trolls deep cranks and casts around some reefs in the middle of that part of the lake. I'm optimistic that the water temps are a little lower, in the high 60s, thinking that big pike will only be in water 65 degrees and under. If I remember correctly, we get a small bass and one or two pike. The wind is nasty and we all head in a bit disappointed in the afternoon.Tuesday night is pizza night (http://sleepydogcabins.com/pizza-its-a-whole-lotta-fun/)! I find out that my walleye central reputation proceeds me, when Deena (I hope I spell her name right) asks which one of us is jsmyers! The pizza and the camaraderie are great. I learn bunch about trolling for trout, though we decide that time is short and kids aren't up for it this time."
6337554,sheepman,2019-07-04 08:04:00,98,"Jason, Nice report! Sorry the fishing wasn't better for you. We go to cabin #1 August 24, you mention Spike's narrows..where on the lake is that located?"
6337580,JAY221,2019-07-04 09:16:00,877,"Thanks for the report. Sounds like you had a good time including the annual getting caught in the rain! One question, Is the water level good or lower than normal? Thanks, Jay"
6337584,jsmyers,2019-07-04 09:26:00,198,"The fishing was good--just not up to my unreasonable expectations. That one morning I got about a dozen bass over 12"" in 2 hours. That was great. We had a couple of flurries of small pike after pike (which is what we were looking for).I'd never heard of Spike's Narrows either, that is where Aerobus, Keynote, and McLeod drain into the 2nd lake. Apparently Spike had a camp around the narrows decades ago.It's hard for me to know what a normal water level is. I think it was on the high side of normal. Certainly wasn't low.Sent from my SM-G960U using Tapatalk"
6337608,billy weaver,2019-07-04 10:50:00,470,Returned from Wabaskang on June 22. Fishing was good with many fish over 20 inches caught. Water level was normal to slightly high. Water temps were 65 to 70 degrees. We caught most of our fish in 10 to 15 ft. of water. A jig with a half of nightcrawler seemed to work the best when fished super slow. I would have too rate this year as very good.
6337614,Bill Krejca,2019-07-04 11:23:00,6107,"Good report, sounds like a fun time was had by all, or almost all, seems like some folks seem to have more fun than others in that environment. just shows that filling the boat with fish is not what it can be all about, lots of great memories for the kids!! Thanks for the detailed account of the trip!! Bill"
6339070,AB,2019-07-09 13:15:00,61,Thanks for the report! Nice Muskie!
6342000,jsmyers,2019-07-18 10:24:00,198,"I almost forgot to post this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGKn...nF44_3QhD2iHivThe playlist includes the grocery run time lapse, the musky madness, and my wife and youngest daughter bringing in a few fish. I've got a few good ones with my older daughter that need to be rotated 90 degrees. Anybody have any ideas on how to get that done?"
6342026,jsmyers,2019-07-18 11:18:00,198,"In the weeks since our trip, I've been mulling over the question, What did I do wrong? Maybe wrong is a strong word and I've been thinking, What should I do next time? I'd appreciate any feedback you might have on these or anything else you might suggest based on my trip report:Fish more evenings for walleyes using bait The last night by dad and I did well in the first narrows, a spot with a strong current, using slip bobbers and minnows. There are probably a lot of places we could have replicated that success and gotten more of the group to experience the bite. (I'm thinking other areas with current, weeds near a good dropoff, or shallow rock reefs.) We weren't on the water at that time much, and most of the times that we were, I was trying out lures, attempting to target both pike and walleye, but probably not targeting either very well.Jigs for bass At a few different times, I did well with small jigs (especially dark hair jigs) for smallmouths. Generally, wherever I found warm water and rocks and/or wood, I could get a smally to bite a hair jig. I should have done two things differently. First, I should have ran to the store and grabbed more of the jigs for the group and encouraged others to try that pattern. Second, there were times when we'd catch a smallish bass on a mepps spinner. I can think of two times that I did so over shallow mid-lake rock reefs. I never tried the jig over those spots. Partly, this is because I had a one-track (pike) mind at those times, but also because I didn't fully-form the hair jig pattern in my mind until the morning of day 6. I suspect I would have gotten more and bigger bass with the jig.Move to the weeds nearest deep water This is much more speculative, as Wabaskang reports from that time were generally down on the fishing for big pike (example: http://www.wabaskangcamp.com/4036). However, in retrospect, most of the time I was targeting pike in the weeds, I wasn't along the deepest edge and wasn't in a weedbed closest to the deep basin. As a for instance, we fished a few times out into the big lake from the second narrows, but the deepest water is much closer to the weedbed that I understand is on the north side of the big lake, near where the lake narrows, heading towards Gawley's Bay. Additionally, the water coming out of the narrows was pretty warm. Perhaps it would have been cooler on the other side of the lake. I can think of a few other places I should have checked for weeds near the deepest water. In the future, I should map out where the weed-edge is and make sure I'm spending time closest to it. A few times, I figured out that the weed line was a ten feet, and I'd troll at that depth, but these were not areas with a good dropoff nearby.Move more In general, we often got stuck fishing one area or spot without a lot of action. Many times, the lack of success could be attributed to the weather patterns at that moment, but I bet we would have been more productive covering more water. The other thing is getting three boats to stick together is like herding cats. I've got to be a little quicker to start up the motor and tell the other boats, Hey, I'm going to check over there. This is a lesson I've read enough about to have in the back of my mind and was probably better than past trips. I think the experience is helping to truly teach me the lesson. I have a few more in mind, but my lunch hour is up. Everybody enjoy your time on the water!"
6342064,billy weaver,2019-07-18 13:05:00,470,"I read it all and enjoyed the report. I enjoy reports that includes family members and the younger members. I started taking my grandson to Wabaskang when he was 6 years old, that was 12 years ago. I have been fishing for years but the time spent with him and my son are my highlights. Your trip was well worth the time and expense as you will always have those happy memories and more important so will they. Billy"
6337490,jsmyers,2019-07-03 20:50:00,198,"Wednesday 6/26: Another early morning for my cousin and I. (Dad slept inthough he didn't plan to!) We head to Aerobus bay, starting first at the entrance. No walleye as I'd hoped, and we get pike or two. Then we head to the weeds outside of the creek mouth targeting pike. We also head up the creek a little ways getting a lot little pike and looking for bass. We find some bass by the rocks, getting one on a hair jig again. We also head into the bay (Greenscum? Moose?) looking for perch for the kids. It is a beautiful morning, made even more impressive by the crystal clear water coming out of Aerobus Creek.We have to get back early so the ladies can participate in an art class at 9 AM (https://www.facebook.com/BlueberryBroadDiversions/). They have a great time and do some impressive artwork. The rest of us head back to that bay off of Aerobus and catch a few pike and perch.After lunch, we go to the bay on the north side of the second lake. It looks like a storm might be coming, so I'm hopefully that now will be the time to get the big one. It is slow at first, picking up for small fish as it gets darker. I believe that we can head over to Spike's Narrows, avoiding the storm that appears to be heading mostly west and staying to the north. There is a little rumble of thunder in the distance, so this strategy doesn't have unanimous support. We get to the narrows and it starts rainingthen pouring. We duck in next to shore to be safe from lightning. It looks absolutely nasty on the second lakeand then it hails on us (but still looks much worse out toward camp). We get soaked. There is a well-deserved spirit of I told you so in air. The sun comes out and we start to dry out. We catch fish in the narrows, first only perch, eventually also small pike with a random bass and walleye or two thrown in. That evening we have a wonderful fish fry with one pike and walleye, two bass, and a mess of perch."
6337492,jsmyers,2019-07-03 20:59:00,198,"Thursday 6/27: Deena lives in the cabin on the northeast side, opposite of Jim and Julie's Wabaskang Camp. After pizza on Tuesday, I asked her what folks call basin her cabin is on. We settle on Deena's Lake. My mom joins us in the early morning to head to Deena's Lake. We start by fishing around the island in front of Jim and Julies, casting cranks and spinners, only catching one bass. My cousin and I head over to the weedbed on the east side of the basin. Again, weedline is at 10' but no fish are biting in the weeds. I'm certainly bummed that the slot and big pike are not behaving as I'd expected them to. As we get north, I start casting the hair jig into the wood and rocks, eventually getting about a dozen bass and a couple of pike. My cousin uses mepps and topwater and gets quite a few pike too. It is calm and sunny. If I remember correctly, the surface water temps are in the high 60s.In the midday, there is a lot of non-fishing. The older kids explore the beach. Some folks enjoy a kayak on the calm water. My youngest does want to fish! She nails a 25 northern right by the first narrows. We head into the narrow part of the first lake and she catches perch while I catch a pike or two. Later on, the kids go swimming on the sand beach."
6337496,jsmyers,2019-07-03 21:03:00,198,"In the late afternoon, the entire group goes back to the second narrows and the east side of the big lake. We're mostly casting and trolling pike lures, but my youngest likes to watch the bobber, so I throw a minnow out there too. It is slow again, though my youngest draws first blood with a quick 23 northern when we first get there. Coming back into the narrows we do better, but nothing big, and the action is slow.After dinner, my dad and I head to the first narrows to burn through the last of the minnows. My cousin's wife is hopefully she'll be able to bring a couple of walleye home with her. I say that we'll keep anything over 15 (and under 18). We both have slip bobbers, but I'm not exactly sure where I should drift them. I'm pretty confident, but our family has a long history of failed or disappointing walleye fishing excursions. My dad has a hit pretty quickly, bringing in a 14.5 walleye. He is very pleasantly surprised. We decide to round up to 15 and put it in the livewell. He gets another pretty quickly; this one 17. Success!! I adjust the length of my bobber stop and we both release two more smaller walleye and have a missed strike or two before we decide the mosquitoes are too thick and that it is getting too dark. It seems that the bite slowed down as it got darker, making me wonder if we would have done better if we'd gone out there earlier."
6337498,jsmyers,2019-07-03 21:08:00,198,"On Friday, we eat as much of our food as we can for breakfast, settle up with Tom and Margaret, take some pictures, and hit the road before noon. We make it back to my cousin's place in MSP late in the evening to check out the tree fort.In closing, we loved Sleepy Dog!. The Cabin 1 is nice and it has a great deck for viewing the sunset. The boats were awesome! Comfortable, fast, and with great amenities. My only complaint about the boats might be that the motors are too powerful to troll very slowly. It was fun to read Irene William's book in the cabin (http://sleepydogcabins.com/in-the-wilds-of-northwest-ontario/) and then chat with Tom and Margaret a bit about their lives on Wabaskang. I wish I had more time to socialize with them. If you're a regular on Wabaskang or Wine, I encourage you to get both books. I finished my copies already. I'm sure we'll be back to Sleepy Dog in the future (but Wine Lake also beckons).Thanks again to everybody on Walleye Central that has helped me over the years with tips, spots, and encouragement!"
