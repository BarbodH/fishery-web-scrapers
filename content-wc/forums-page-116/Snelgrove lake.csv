6340728,UPnorth3,2019-07-14 14:17:00,22,"Got back from Snelgrove a few days ago. First off, Clarks is an absolutely top notch outfitter. Night and day compared to other fly-in outfitters we have experience with. Snelgrove was the first walleye trip we have been taken. So take this report with a grain of salt. We caught plenty of fish everyday, but it would take some time to find a school. Most of the walleye were caught in the main lake near rocks. Not many caught trolling, in weeds, or bays. With the live bait provided by Clarks, jig and minnow caught by far the most fish. They provide more minnows than two people could use. We bought a few dozen leeches and had moderate success. I would highly recommend Clarks. All of the gear and boats worked without issue."
6236362,Guest,2018-08-22 11:02:00,0,Was wondering if anyone has fished snelgrove lake with clarks fly in? Looking at that place as well as bow lake with north 51 outpost any help would be welcomed thank you

They fly in every other day and bring more minnows, water and ice for you. I also stayed at they're northern lights resorted was pleased as well."

6236470,kona77,2018-08-22 17:33:00,236,I have not fished Snelgrove but have fished four other lakes thru the Clarks and we have had great trips.. Next year will be lake #5.. Fishing has been good to outstanding on all their lakes and Wayne/Karla always take care of our group.. Free minnows and flown in bottle water are two great services and their cabins/equipment are always in good shape. They post weekly fishing reports on their site and I know there are some reports on Snelgrove from other guys.. I believe there is also a video on their site from a group who fished Snelgrove this year.
6236472,maddogg,2018-08-22 17:38:00,178,I was there in around 1982 and had no problems maybe they were too young then.

6236632,leachmin&worm,2018-08-23 07:51:00,32,"Fished Snelgrove lake June 2017. My son and I caught anywhere from 800-1000 walleye (with northern mixed-in) in a weeks time. We maybe fished 6-8 hrs a day. We were lazy. Lake is beautiful and cabin is well maintained. Largest wally was 24 inch, Northern 36 inch. Many great spots to fish. Off the dock, first two hours of our trip pulled up two chairs, a couple of beers and caught one right after another. Clark's is nothing short of spectacular."
