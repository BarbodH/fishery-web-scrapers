I have a cheap Garmin unit on my bow for use when fishing from the front with my trolling motor that shows many more fish the the Helix. Not sure why this is, but maybe I need some adjusting of the settings? Any thoughts?"

Now I have a bird chirp unit and it is much better, but still not as good as my garmin echomaps. I'm sure that a guy with a lot of knowledge could get more out of it by screwing around with the settings, but I'm the type that likes to turn it on and go. Garmin seems to be better than the others in this regard. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"

I didn't use the default clear mode ever because it really restricted the sonar signal returns. I turned the sensitivity up to around 8 sometimes higher. I allowed the unit to display a band of debris at the top. When it worked best there would be a certain amount of ""other"" clutter returns but I would be able to distinguish the fish arches and blobs. The unit will give a strong signal but it isn't going to be the default settings."
