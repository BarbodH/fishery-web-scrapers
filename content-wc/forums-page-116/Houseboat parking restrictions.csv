I have seen it happen on LOW when houseboat operators get perturbed if tent campers infringe on an area that houseboats frequent. If it happens enough, a new law is passed which benefits the entrepreneur. It is fully understandable, even if not liked by some of us. Bill"
6333164,tv4fish,2019-06-21 05:54:00,2694,Guys: We have been informed that the MNR has decided to restrict where houseboats can be parked on Lac Seul. Any of you know WHERE these restricted areas are??? I have tried to find any info. on the MNR regulations with no luck...........
6333168,Bill Krejca,2019-06-21 06:03:00,6107,"Sounds rather ""fishy"", can there be some sort of problem being created by mere parking? I'm assuming this is an overnight camping restriction. Bill"
6333190,tv4fish,2019-06-21 07:06:00,2694,"Bill: We were told that there have been some complaints about the houseboats ""tying up"" popular beach areas ??????????"
6333504,x4flatfish,2019-06-22 11:43:00,319,Who is telling you this? I would think your outfitter could answer your concerns...
6341966,Eddieshere1!,2019-07-18 08:16:00,1,According to our outfitter you are not allowed to park anywhere south of Taylor Island if you are not a Canadian resident.
6341984,pjshorthorn,2019-07-18 09:41:00,5654,"Has anyone seen this posted on any HB outfitter's website? It seems to be a new regulation ? In my past experience, never really saw HB's moored south of Taylor Island unless they were taking an overnight stay close to Hudson on a Thursday/Friday so they could leave pretty early from the docks the next morning. Maybe driven by the lodges at the lower end of Lac Seul ?. I would love to hear the rational behind it. PjShorthorn"
6341994,gowrlop,2019-07-18 10:16:00,109,"I just returned last Saturday. The pilot driving our LSFL Houseboat said no more parking south of Taylor Island for Non Canadians, unless it's a one night return stay in Morning Bay. I don't know if that's his perception of a rule or fact. Now, Andrea (LSFL) didn't say anything to us about this but, we had planned to stay on Taylor Island so maybe no need? That's what I heard and know, not saying it's factual, just what I was told.As for the fishing, no so good. Haze from the fires and all the Mayfly's didn't help. Our group totals were down about 20%. Can't wait to go back."
6341996,v-bay gord,2019-07-18 10:18:00,3168,It may be tied with the non resident crown land camping restrictions. A houseboat moored to shore may be defined as camping. Just guessing.
6342044,Skywagon,2019-07-18 12:25:00,1106,It was common to see houseboats parked on the east side of banana island (3 miles south of Taylor island) in the past. I was almost as far as Taylor island one day a couple of weeks ago and did not see any parked at banana on the way through.
6342136,pjshorthorn,2019-07-18 16:18:00,5654,Could be as you stated. I'm not sure at all as I haven't taken a HB trip in that neck of the woods since 2006. PjShorthorn
