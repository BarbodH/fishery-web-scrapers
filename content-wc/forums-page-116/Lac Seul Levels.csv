6336592,a_hershy,2019-07-01 12:08:00,36,Anyone able to comment on water levels at Lac Seul compared to last year at this time? I've seen the inflow/outflow charts but cannot say I understand them completely. Likely make more sense if I monitored them more.Our family will be heading up in a few more weeks. To the Scout Bay area.
6336610,Carnhzkr,2019-07-01 12:50:00,964,Water is good. Higher than last year. It's right at or maybe a little higher than average at this time of year. Right where you want it to be.
6336612,eyecatcher1,2019-07-01 12:51:00,323,I was there last week and I think that Lac Seul is exactly the same as this time last year. I looked at some pictures that I took last year and can't see a difference. I'm referring to rock reefs that were out of the water last year look the same now. I go to the Sioux Lookout area.

While I do monitor the www.lwcb.ca site, I also put more stock in the number of concrete pads out of the water at the Deception landing. Last year in June there were 15 out of the water. When I was there 3 weeks ago, there were 14 out, and I'll be curious as to the count when I go in again on the 12th of July."
6336924,eyecatcher1,2019-07-02 08:42:00,323,That's a good way to measure the level because I've been there when there were many more pads out of the water than now and also when there were stakes in the water marking where the concrete pads started. It's amazing how much the water levels can fluctuate up there.

6342054,a_hershy,2019-07-18 12:52:00,36,"Thanks for the update. We are headed up next week. Sounds like a pretty significant jump in a short time. Besides lost time, did it throw fishing off a bunch?"
6342090,bigwalleye1,2019-07-18 14:00:00,2632,"The bite was really inconsistent due to the varied weather, and, more importantly, wind. No warm or cool spots. Seems like everything we saw was about 71 surface temp, and the wind was from every direction of the compass. I've always said I don't care the direction, so long as I can have it the same for 2 days in a row."
6342356,mwh624,2019-07-19 08:59:00,183,Got back Wednesday from a 5 day trip. Water temp was 71-73 degrees and the fish where schooled up on rock structure in 12-27 FOW. Best fishing was 15-18ft
