Since then ive read many reports from the far NW, eg Red Lake area all the way across the north into Qc. I find it amazing how such a fast area, 100s and close to 1000kms of area experiences the same weather, mayflies, temperature for air and water, etc....all factors that play a role in a fish bite. There is a strong consistency even though the area is vast. One factor i didnt mention and havent noticed mentioned is tree pollen out of the cedar and hemlock trees. We were 3rd week June and a buddy was in Qc, KIpawa region 1st week July. We both chat about the tree pollen tht covered the lake so much it was similar to a lake turning itself over. His opinion and mine too and our groups, was tht this pollen had zero bearing on the fish bite. For the most part we had a great chop on the water, and even some heavy rollers some days where shores were getting pounded so the pollen was pushed off. Has anyone seen that much pollen before and has it affected your bite? In 20yrs it was the most we had seen."

The fishing was off the charts, even for Canada standards. The outfitter later told us that tree pollen was to minnows what mayflies were to walleyes. That minnows loved tree pollen and it put them in a feeding frenzy that made them very vulnerable to the walleyes. We laughed later that if the tree pollen was really part of the great fishing we would have avoided it if we could have."

This activity started long before the mayfly hatch began which wasnt till late thurs night into fri. The pollen was already covering the lake on the saturday at the beginning of the trip. My guess is tht activity was the bait fish
