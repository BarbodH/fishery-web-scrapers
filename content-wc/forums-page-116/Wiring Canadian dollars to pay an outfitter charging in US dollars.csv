6339950,phishfearme,2019-07-12 09:40:00,1242,"yes! exactly! when paying for these trips to Canada from the US there is no way to avoid some fees - I got it down to 1% which I think is a minimum - but my group would be fine with a 2% fee for credit card use. I've asked a number of outfitters why they do not take credit cards and either got ""I don't want to be bothered"" or ""would you pay an extra 2%?"" - when I answered ""yes"", they fall back on ""I don't want to be bothered"". old habits run deep. phish"
6339962,v-bay gord,2019-07-12 10:05:00,3168,I would assume camps that won't take credit cards would ask for deposits to be mailed to them in check form. Back in the day we did this...now I will only confirm a reservation with a credit card. It is instant and not a 2 week waiting period (if they put on the right stamp). During busy periods you would be possibly holding a cabin (and turning others away) hoping this check is actually sent. That is old school thinking.....bad form.
6340030,Aspencreek,2019-07-12 12:06:00,2911,"And those are the reasons that if a camp or outfitter will not take a CC, I won't go there. If they can't be bothered by accepting a credit cards to be paid , what else can't they be bothered with. It is the cost of doing business, and that cost (fees) are minimal."
6340036,phishfearme,2019-07-12 12:33:00,1242,"we should all at the least start the discussion with an outfitter about taking credit cards. this is the best way to make our (customer's) preferences known. but for certain outfitters that provide what I consider excellent lakes for very good prices, then I'll work out something else - like wiring Canadian funds from my US account. phish"
6340046,CI_Guy,2019-07-12 12:57:00,2118,I'm surprised that you've found the majority of outfitters don't take credit cards. Different groups I'm part of have used at least 3 different outfitters over the last 10 years and they all take credit cards. I can't recall the last time I wrote a check to a resort.
6340086,phishfearme,2019-07-12 15:00:00,1242,"none of the outfitters we've used for the last 10 years+ have taken credit cards. they are all fly-in outposts type outfitters departing from ""end of the road communities"" and have been around for decades - not sure if that's important though. phish"
6340440,Fisherman Ted,2019-07-13 12:01:00,461,"As an outfitter that does take cards upon check-out and for last minute reservations and in a pinch there is also another reason many are reluctant to take cards for deposits. Deposits, not at check-out. I have had many colleagues talk about situations where a card is used for a non-refundable deposit and then the customer cancels the trip. Some customers then call their card company and say the trip wasn't taken and they want their money back and they are refunded their money from the card issuer. Card company comes right in their account and takes the cash. That problem would never happen with a personal check that has cleared."
6340458,v-bay gord,2019-07-13 13:05:00,3168,I was surprised to learn that a US bank / credit card issuer would be able to reach into my Canadian bank accounts and take $.. After talking to my bank you are technically right...however their is a dispute mechanism for the merchant. In my case my booking policy clearly states deposits are not refundable....only transferrable...in which case the $ would be returned to me. All theoretical since it's never happened to me.
6340654,BreezyPoint,2019-07-14 10:03:00,1581,"On a dispute, the merchant always gets the chance to tell their side of the story. Some bank card companies will reverse the charge right away pending investigation, but the bank card company will redeposit the money if the merchant's response is compelling (such as deposits not refundable stated in camp policies).Bank card companies tend to give the customer the benefit of doubt in very gray areas but are not at all tolerant towards bogus claims like this.Frank"
6340674,That Minnesota guy,2019-07-14 11:18:00,8293,When I find a camp owner that refuses cash I will be concerned. Until then I just worry about the weather and if the screens in the cabin are good.
6338456,phishfearme,2019-07-07 14:18:00,1242,"In a previous post I presented my experience with paying an outfitter whose prices are listed in Canadian dollars. I was able to wire Canadian dollars from my US account for only a 1% conversion fee and no transfer fee. See:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=695520 But most outfitters seem to have their pricing in US dollars, mainly for the convenience of their US customers who represent the majority of their business. So how do they price for their Canadian customers? I posed this to an outfitter I've used previously and asked him to quote a trip price in Canadian dollars. I then calculated what the trip would cost me as a US citizen if I am able to wire the outfitter Canadian dollars as described in my previous post. The total cost was much cheaper. Why? Mainly because the outfitter was a Canadian citizen and had to use his bank to convert the check from a US bank in US dollars to Canadian dollars (each with fees) so he could pay his bills. He also priced in a ""currency risk"" factor for paying in US dollars. So, for my next trip with a Canadian outfitter who prices his trips in US dollars I plan to ask for a quote in Canadian dollars and see if I can save by doing the transfer I described in the previous post above. The outfitter I chatted with said that he would prefer to be paid in Canadian dollars anyway and would be happy to pass along a portion of any savings on fees and exchange rates. I'd like to hear from some of the Canadian citizen outfitters who hang out on this board to see what they think about this also. phish"
6339006,Aspencreek,2019-07-09 08:20:00,2911,"I don't know, just sounds like a lot of trouble to save a few bucks. I pay with my CC and get the accurate exchange rate at the time. I carry very little cash and pay for everything with my CC or debit card that I can."
6339120,v-bay gord,2019-07-09 16:10:00,3168,"Ah, this topic is always fun. You have a unique angle on this. It would be interesting to see what quotes in Canadian $ you would receive from many of these camps if they thought you were a potential Canadian guest. I'm thinking in some cases you might be very happy with the price quoted. In my situation I charge in Canadian $ because I live here, and I want to know that if I charge someone $100 I get $100...and not $93 because of some unexpected slip in the exchange rate. Of course I might be happy to end up with $130 for the same reason. It seems strange to run a business where doing something because of ""convenience"" impacts your bottom line negatively. I suspect though if most camps are doing it they are not losing money doing so. If they are they ain't so smart!~"
6339264,phishfearme,2019-07-10 06:57:00,1242,"if your outfitter accepts credit cards, he is in the vast minority, phish"
6339268,phishfearme,2019-07-10 07:18:00,1242,"thanks for the thoughts Gord. the statement ""priced in US dollars for customer convenience"" is from many outfitters and the price they quote in US dollars covers the very possibility you mention - unexpected slip in exchange rate. the one outfitter I asked about this said his Canadian dollar rate does not have to include this risk nor does it include bank fees associated with handling both a US check and US currency. in todays ""cashless"" world, there's no need to deal with the costs associated with ""priced in US dollars for customer convenience"" or other bank fees. I would hope that the outfitter would/should be willing to provide a quote in Canadian or US dollars to either US or Canadian citizens. not sure what your point is about "" if they thought you were a potential Canadian guest""?? out of curiosity, how do your US customers pay you? and would you accept a bank wire for payment? thanks, phish"
6339436,v-bay gord,2019-07-10 14:47:00,3168,"The point I was alluding to was that a potential ""Canadian"" guest might get a quote that is basically a discounted rate off of the published US rate. It would be easy to test this theory. I accept payment with credit cards (not American Express), cash, check, e-transfer and PayPal. Haven't had a bank wire but why not? If a guest wants to pay in US cash or check I need to build in a buffer should the exchange rate go down before I visit the bank."
6339880,Aspencreek,2019-07-12 07:16:00,2911,"I understand that Camps, and Outfitters in the great white north are a little slow on some of these things, But honestly getting set up to accept credit cards, debit cards, is easier than handling cash. I don't need to explain why getting paid in this manner is good for business. And being in a ""service industry"" making it as simple as possible for you to get paid should be a top priority. And yes there is a fee....so what, build that into the fee structure. And one more thing, and maybe it's just me, but if an outfitter or camp tells me ""cash only"" I look elsewhere, behind the times is one thing, in the stone age is another. And it's not like they don't have all winter to get it set up, which took me all of 10 min at my bank. It took me longer to drive there."
6339886,bthomas3333,2019-07-12 07:39:00,465,"Dear Outfitters,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stop the demands for checks. My check register is literally a record of my last four trips. I PAY EVERYTHING ELSE in my life with credit cards, online payments, Vendmo, and EFT. When you make me pay by check this is what happens.1. I have to find the **** checkbook2. I have to find some stamps. (I buy forever stamps...how much are these things worth?)3. I have to google search the cost to mail to Canada this year.4. I have to guess how many forever stamps this would cost.5. I give up and drive 15 mins to the post office and wait in line 5-20 minutes to buy an international stamp.6. I mail the check and hope it gets there.If they would just accept a credit card and charge me a ridiculous 5% sobeit. The max fee to type in a card AMEX is 3.5%. Most when typed in are 2.5% but whatever.Please take my **** card and stop the insanity.B-"
6339900,v-bay gord,2019-07-12 07:54:00,3168,"Interesting that some camps demand cash only. Trying to escape the credit card fees? Like someone mentioned, just build that cost into your rate structure. Right now there are very few ways to pay that does not involve an extra cost. My bank even dings me a fee for depositing cash (over a certain amount ""free"" per month)."
6339948,phishfearme,2019-07-12 09:33:00,1242,"HERE, HERE!! Credit cards make so much sense to me also and writing checks is a rarity. the only reason I went thru the wire transfer effort is that the majority of outfitters - maybe vast majority - simply won't do credit cards - and carrying cash is out for both safely and expense. we estimate that the wire transfer route saved us each close to $100US this past year. I think it will take those of us who are customers to simply start insisting on the credit card option - and Canadian banks to me seem to be quite modern (there's only a few of them). even if the outfitter adds a 2% fee to the trip cost to use credit cards - we would find this acceptable (although with the wire transfer route I only pay 1% - and a 1% savings on a $12000 trip for 6 will buy dinner for us). phish"
