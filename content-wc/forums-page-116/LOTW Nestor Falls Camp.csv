6340838,Bergy,2019-07-14 18:55:00,83,Looking for recommendations on a camp with housekeeping cabins in the Nestor Falls area on Lake of the Woods. Would like a drive to camp with good (prefer paved) road to bring our own boat. Also protected docks that are wind protected. Looking to mainly fish Walleye and donâ€™t want to have to travel 30 minutes by boat to get to good fishing.

You are centrally located then, more options. I did the Nestor Falls thing for 2 years, that was enough for me. Been going to Morson for 20+ now. You can PM me, if you like about details. Brett"
6341374,The tank,2019-07-16 11:16:00,340,X2 on morson. We stay on an island to get closer to the best fishing but there's a reason some guide boats from Nestor falls boat clear over in milesbay.
6341534,Guest,2019-07-16 19:42:00,0,Hey that sounds great. I've fished Nestor myself and ready for a change. Any dispensaries up that way? Fort Fran or Baudette?
6341674,1700SS,2019-07-17 08:22:00,104,Not sure on the dispensaries.
