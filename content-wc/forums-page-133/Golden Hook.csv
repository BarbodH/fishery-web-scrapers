In particular we are going up for big pike. The pictures of the camp and boats look nice. But, I'm more concerned about the quality of fishing in the area. If you have been up there can you please share your fishing experiences. Thanks in advance, safe travels, tight lines and sharp hooks."

We troll bays a lot for the kids with rapallas for walleyes but catch plenty of northerns along the way. I've never been a northern trophy hunter, so I think its just a matter of probability and numbers caught. You'll catch a big one here or there. I've never stayed at Golden Hook, just Howey Bay and Five Lakes Lodge. You'll have a great time."

I have caught way too many big pike there over the years, largest 44"" for me. I'm a walleye guy but we will occasionally target slimers by trolling plugs, I don't like to cast."
6292782,reconssd,2019-02-24 06:55:00,147,Tyeegs and Coyoteman - thank you for your inputs. I greatly appreciate it and August isn't going to come fast enough to get on the water. Thanks again.
