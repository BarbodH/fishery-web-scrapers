This method would only be preferred when minnows are free. Ontario Fishing Regulations indicate the following: Hooks and Lines Â– An angler may use only one line, unless otherwise stated in the regulations. Two lines may be used when angling from a boat in parts of the Great Lakes and for ice fishing in many areas. A fishing line must not have more than four hooks attached."
6292688,Jim Clark,2019-02-23 16:30:00,9,I am primarily a saltwater fisherman but am going to Snelgrove Lake this summer with Clark's. I usually use tandem jigs for saltwater species. Does anybody do this for walleyes? It's nice to catch two fish on one cast.
6292704,Eckohlt,2019-02-23 16:50:00,3685,"Jim i will be at the dock wen u arrive at snelgrove,as far as tandem jigs go i would worry about catching one fish at a time,kinda rare to get two fish in one cast lol,see u aug 8th,rod"
6292712,Eckohlt,2019-02-23 17:03:00,3685,"Jim if you start catching 2 fish per cast then youll want to go triple tandem and try for 3 fish per cast lol,if i was you just try for one fish per cast.I will be there a week before u get there so theres a chance every fish in the lake will have sore lips,so youll have to work extra hard just to get one fish to bite,talk to u later jim,see u at the dock,rod"
6292776,BornToFish,2019-02-24 06:17:00,1224,"Greetings, I'm not sure what a tandem jig is. The thought that came to mind is that a rig designed to catch more than one fish at the same time might not be legal in Ontario. The original poster might want to investigate this matter before his fishing trip. I believe that Ontario allows anglers to use up to four hooks per line, but I understand that this would be on the same lure. That is, a pike/musky fisherman can legally use a Suick jerk bait that has three treble hooks on it. The same fish could get hooked with all three treble hooks at the same time. Anglers are allowed one fishing line per angler when fishing open water. This means to me that the MNR does not want anglers to fish multiple lines, so as to possibly catch more than one fish at a time. Again, I don't know if a tandem jig is legal to use in Ontario. I would investigate this matter before I used such a lure. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6292842,Bill Krejca,2019-02-24 09:26:00,6107,"There is a reason why jig users prefer finishes which are not easily chipped. Much walleye fishing seems to be directly on the bottom, much bottom terrain in walleye country can be snag laden. Like the old Double-Mint Gum commercial, '""Double your pleasure, double your fun"", can also mean double your snags. Bill"
6292856,kona77,2019-02-24 10:11:00,236,Have seen guys use two hooks or jigs when they fish for whitefish here in WI. You really do not need to resort to these types of tactics on a good Canadian lake. As pointed out earlier it can just lead to multiple snags and extra work. Have fished now with the Clarks for several years and we will be trying our 5th lake this year. One of our favorite things to do is fish right off the docks at night and we have had numerous 25+ fish nights. Since the Clarks provide minnows the scent of the bait will usually lure walleyes (and Northerns) to the docks in the evenings. Assume the same thing will occur at Snellgrove. Good luck on your trip.. Wayne/Karla's team will treat you right..
6292894,adempsey2.0,2019-02-24 13:57:00,611,"As long as it is legal (which it likely is, but some lakes have specific restrictions), I say go for it! I have never used two jigs, but I have used two hooks with live bait many times. Mostly for perch fishing, but they are called pickerel rigs after all .Although not really jigs, I was hoping to try out some double fluke rigs for walleye this year myself. Such a cool looking presentation!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdxAIX9o9vE"
6292900,Jim Clark,2019-02-24 14:51:00,9,I always use two jigs or bucktails for flounder and trout and frequently catch two fish at a time. I was just curious as to whether anyone has tried it for walleye. The simplest way to rig is tie a loop knot or swivel onto a piece of leader. Leave 6-8 inches on the short end and 15-20 inches on the long end. Tie on your jigs and attach loop or swivel to the main line.
6292902,Jim Clark,2019-02-24 14:53:00,9,Looking forward to meeting you. Hope to hear some good fish stories.
6293068,camp chef,2019-02-25 08:44:00,915,In wisconsin rivers we sometimes fish with what we call a Winneconne rig. It is a lead head jig and a floating jig fished simultaneously off a three way swivel. Both hooks are tipped with minnow or crawler
