During past trips in 2008 and 2011, my wife and I found our way to the World renowned Tree River where world record char and many line class records have been caught. The experiences surely created that bug for more. But not until 2016, 17 & 18 had a new career move opened things up for again chasing char in some other regions which would normally be far too costly and even difficult to plan... I really love the pursuit of these immensely beautiful, strong, fresh and saltwater delicious and healthy fish. The footsteps taken to best find them always leads to true adventure with no certain outcome. Recently back in Nunavut with time on my hands one weekend, I spent a day reflecting on great char experiences while creating this article... If you want to see quite possibly the most incredibly vibrant fish Canada has to offer, enjoy the story.http://bunksoutdoorangle.com/fishing...s-arctic-char/Spring is coming... Hang in there everyone! Bunk."
