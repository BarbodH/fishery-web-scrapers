My group and I are looking to plan our annual fall trip, which usually takes place in the second or third week of September. We'd probably stay at the resort, I've emailed them but haven't heard back yet. I've heard a lot of interesting stuff about Dogtooth, it's a big fish lake but can be tough to figure out. We don't mind working hard for big fish, but knowing we have at least a place or two we can expect to be able to find our eaters would be nice. I know it has pike, bass, and trout in it as well, we'd definitely be interested in chasing those for a bit. I've done some research and have found a good amount of information about fishing it in the summer, but has anyone had the chance to fish it in the fall? We're pretty experienced anglers, but any information or advice you guys can give would be super helpful!"
