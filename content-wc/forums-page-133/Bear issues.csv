6267880,MikeinMN,2018-12-10 21:54:00,190,"I have been flying and driving into Canadian fishing camps for a long time. Last year was the first time we had a bear issue that was not easily resolved. We have had bears in camp several times, but we keep a clean camp and usually a little noise has kept things to a fun story later. Last year we had a habituated bear in camp and it was not a situation I'd like to repeat. Have any of you had bear problems and what did you do? It looks like bear spray is legal to cross the border with, has anyone tried it?"
6267896,Fisherman1792,2018-12-11 04:26:00,927,"If you use bear spray you had better be sure your with the wind and its pointed in the right direction. You could also try bear bangers that you point and shoot at the bear but again if the bear is facing you, you want to shoot in front of the bear not behind it. If its a problem bear there is really not much you can do about it, it will just keep coming back even with bangers and spray. At the remote mine I work at the company has to do all those techniques and call the MNR and if all fails unfortunately we have to put it down. Fisherman 1792"
6267992,Bill Krejca,2018-12-11 08:51:00,6107,"Several years ago, the camp owner habitually chased away a habitual visitor bear by throwing rocks at it. Problem started earlier in the year when a shed door was left open and bear got into the grease kept for bear baiting (it worked pretty good in the shed). We had a moose in camp last year - it visited several cabins and left on its own, quite unusual. Bill"
6268116,jambi,2018-12-11 15:32:00,504,We've crossed into Canada many times with bear spray; no issues. I've not had to try on a bear but have accidentally discharged in my vehicle. Very effective indeed.
6268126,Mr. Sauger,2018-12-11 16:41:00,285,"Had two bear problems resolved Ontario. Drive IN First problem was a big black bear repeatedly visiting the drive in resort on Lac Seul. Resort owner dispatched the nuisance and took the carcass to the dump. Asked us not to blab too much as it would be an effort to convince the authorities it was a nuisance bear. Fly In Night 1 I would not want to relive the week we has two cinnamon colored black bears visiting our cabin at a fly in. Four days into the trip we were playing poker and drinking beer in the cabin (around 11:00PM) when we heard something crash through the screen in the porch. We banged on the cabin's steel door and hear the nails scamper on the floor like a dog on the kitchen floor. The critter came back three more times  hmmm it wasn't afraid of us. We finally got a peek at them  the big bear was around 400 + pounds. Smaller was over 250lbs. Morning 1 Didn't get much sleep that night as we barricaded the door and tied filet knives to the end of broomsticks. First thing in the morning we used the emergency radio phone and squealed to our outfitter like Laura Petrie. He said he would try to stop in in the next day or two (oh gee thanks). Finally mustered up the courage to leave the cabin to make it to boats to fish for the day. Night2 Fished all day. We returned at dusk only to find our two unwanted visitors loitering around the cabin. By now the mosquitos were feasting on our flesh. After a while we decided if we stayed in our diamond formation with homemade weapons drawn we could make it to the cabin. Started to sound a bit like Cage, Kirby and Little John. Got halfway there and heard a growl from the bushes. Every man for himself ran the for boats. Our second attempt that was less eventful and we make it to the cabin. Morning 2 Made it to the boats OK. What a relief (pun intended as the cabin did not have toilet plumbing). That morning the cavalry arrived  our outfitter's float plane. The outfitter's helper immediately went into the bush tracking the bears. He carried a 444 Winchester lever action bush gun (complete with duct tape). 45 minutes later he returned reporting 'yep they're back. That explained the five vertical rips in each of the cabin window screens. The outfitter and sidekick were getting ready to leave (abandon?) us when we exclaimed, Whoa where ya goin with the rifle? Outfitter asked us what would you do if you saw the bear. Unanimous answer was, Blow his friggin head off. With that he said good answer and handed us the rifle. Ahh, what a difference. No longer having every shadow or sound making the hair on the back of your neck stand up. We could come and go as we pleased be it the boats, outhouse, cabin or anything in-between. For the next day and a half we saw the bears, but never had a line for a shot. Departure  Saturday morning Outfitter and sidekick also arrived as we started to pack our gear in a floatplane to depart. With seven of us in the area (4 fisherman, 2 outfitters and pilot) the 250 pound bear has the balls to tear into a garbage bag of beer cans leaning against the cabin. I guess the cabin door slamming 46 times that morning as we moved our gear from the cabin to the dock didn't alarm her. The sidekick asked for his rifle and we held out a handful of bullets. He took only one. Don't ya want more? we asked. He looked at us like noobs and said, There is only one bear. With that he scraped his boot on the ground and waited for the bear to look up. They later shipped the skin to us."
6268252,tv4fish,2018-12-12 06:38:00,2694,Mr. Sauger: Sorry for your bear trouble - but - I gotta say - you DO know how to tell a story. Great job - started my day off with a grin..............
6268294,unchained,2018-12-12 07:51:00,208,"I love the diamond formation and the strong plan...till you heard a growl then every man for himself! It's like the classic Mike Tyson quote 'everyone has a plan, until they get punched in the mouth'"

6268476,Beer King,2018-12-12 16:27:00,146,"Years ago good friends on fly in had constant problems with a bear. Came up with a plan to bait bear with bread down to lake and into one of the boats - they tied that boat to another with long rope and a guy laying low with motor running. Idea was to haul bear out to an island they had been using to dump fish guts. Beyond belief the bear does exactly as planned, down the trail and into the boat it goes. They give a hoot when bear is in boat, he hits it and of course bear quickly jumps out into lake and back to camp :-) Outfitter finally showed up and took care of business."
6272424,rockape,2018-12-27 09:21:00,215,"We had a bear problem many years back. We drove all night and got to our remote cabin late morning. We moved our crap in and took a nap, waiting for our other friends to show up. Got up, and we were clearing paths by the lake. I heard some noise and said something to my friend. He said it was probably just our friends unloading. I get to the clearing by the cabin, and there is Mr. Black Bear walking around checking out my friends truck. We determined the deer skull he had mounted on the top of the cap may have had a fragment of flesh on it from the previous year. We knew this bear wasn't going away. What does my friend say? ""Don't let him leave!"" So here I am. Bear at the top of the hill, me, and the lake. So I am now the bait. My friend runs around the other side of the cabin. I did my part on ""not letting him leave"". The bear walks around to the front of the cabin. I hear a loud bear noise. I run up to the front of the cabin. There is my friend with his bow in hand. Said it was a perfect shot. It was dusk, so we looked around in the bush where it ran with various weapons. Couldn't find him. Went in the cabin, drank, played euchre, slept. Got up and found the bear 20 feet in the bush. Can't figure out why we didn't step on him the night before. We disposed of properly. That bear wasn't going to leave. The previous guest told of his troubles. Never had a bear close to me like that in 15 years."
6272600,Ogoki,2018-12-27 16:57:00,291,"Unclaimed , I was speaking of sub 150 lb black bears . I do realize they can cause great bodily injury. Try holding down a 75 lb lab . Hard to do. A frightened black bear would do more damage ,than one of my 75 lb Labs. But if fishing and a black bear comes around , I have found i am better off to let them wonder on thru , than spook one. Just been my experience. Not saying it's the right of wrong thing to do , but letting them wonder on off has worked for me ."
6272730,vaquero01,2018-12-28 08:36:00,101,The bear was hanging around camp for a few days. This cat is tuff!Camp owner finally dispatched bear.
6273282,Lake Of The Woods,2018-12-29 23:55:00,124,"During the mid to late 90's we had a bear population explosion due to the mutton-head politicians who ran the MNR at that time. In their infinite wisdom they decided to ban the spring bear hunt which was mostly due to the pressure of animal activist groups in southern Ontario,... you know, the citiot people who haven't a clue about anything that goes on in the northern rural areas. Well, within a 2 year period we had bears roaming the street of Kenora like mice and or stray cats. The Sows were making their dens in the green areas of town and giving birth to their cubs. The cubs were taught by the Sows to get their food from restaurant garbage bins and any other convenient source.This learned behaviour began a cycle of bear intrusions.The MNR had live trapped 450 bears in the town one summer and amazingly there was not one incident where an attack took place. I had one big old Boar who decided to hang around my house for a few weeks,... of course every one seemed to have had a pet bear in their yard that summer. One afternoon I was doing some home renovations using a power sander to refinish a door. I decided to take a break and when I shut the sander off and turned around there was the bear,... standing there looking at me from about 15 feet away. I slowly backed away to give him space and he proceeded to walk around the side of the house and down the hill in the front yard and crossed the road to an open lot. My backyard was adjacent to a bush area which had trails through it as the high school students would use it as a shortcut,... and so would the bears into my yard. One warm June evening while watching some TV in the living room I heard what sounded like a banging thud against my house.I went to investigate and stepped out the side door to the deck in the backyard only to discover Mr.Boar Bear standing on his hind legs and rocking my aluminum shed against the house. I shouted out loud a few times and he reluctantly left,... only to return later on in the night while I was asleep upon which time he opened the shed like a tuna can by getting his claws underneath the panels and curling it back. Then reached in, grabbed the garbage and naturally just scattered it around the yard. On another occasion while arriving home from work one evening I walked into the backyard only to discover the bear belly down on the lawn with the bird-feeder between his front paws while lapping up the feeders contents. I thought this would be a good time to grab my camera and get some photos. I stood on the opposite side of the 3 foot hedge which separated me from the bear by 20 feet and took a few photos. Then I thought,.... ""hmmm, I could get a little closer,... the bear seems preoccupied with the bird-feeder"".So, I stepped on the bears side of the hedge which put me about 12 feet or so from him and proceeded to take photos. The bear looked up at me a couple times between mouthfuls of bird seed. Then, a couple minutes later he got up on all fours,... put his head down and began to rock side to side. Now, I knew this was a warning sign for me to back off so I retreated a few steps or so but continued to shoot film. Then, the second warning came when he lunged at me with three quick steps. I knew there would not be a third warning so I backed up slowly all the way to safety of the house where the family and I watched him through the window. However, there was one day when play time was over. My son and his friend were playing in the backyard one afternoon when the bear showed up. My wife spotted him and brought the kids in the house. We had instructed the kids to always drop to the ground any food they may have been snacking on if a bear showed up,...as was the case on this day. I grabbed my .30-06 rifle and went into the bush behind the house after the Boar. He eluded me but in hindsight I really never wanted to have to put him down. However the bears that the MNR live trapped were transported out of town and released with a number assigned to them. If they returned the bear would be released a second time,... if they returned a third time the MNR would put it down. After a while it seemed normal to have bears cross your path when taking a walk to the corner store for a loaf of bread and jug of milk or just taking a leisurely stroll. Going out for dinner was also interesting as bears would be climbing up on the grease-bins and dumpsters looking for an easy meal,... the kids thought it was like going to the zoo. Just give the bears their space and throw down any food you may be carrying as that's all they really want. Oh, and as most of us know,... if you see cubs but no Sow just remember that she is not far away. Just turn around walk in the opposite direction of the cubs or poop could really hit the fan,... and or the inside of your pants!"
6273296,tv4fish,2018-12-30 05:17:00,2694,WOW - That is another amazing story - I would have thought that any Moms with young kids would have gone bonkers with all those bears around town !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6277224,spw2350,2019-01-10 07:10:00,26,"We flew into our annual fishing camp. My brother caught an 18lb pike we threw it into my large locking coleman cooler and left it outside. The next morning I looked out on the path to the boats and there was a bear pawing and biting the cooler trying to get at the fish. I woke everybody when I yelled there's a bear outside! My brother jumped up and said ""I Catch the biggest fish I've ever caught and a BEAR is going to get it !!!"" I grabbed a piece of firewood and the others started shouting as I threw it (from inside lol) fortunately that was enough to discourage the bear and it trotted off. Lots of scratches and tooth marks on cooler but it never opened. Kept the cooler inside the cabin for remainder of the trip and never saw bear again. After that experience I bring a string of firecrackers just in case, never had to use them though."
6277812,fishron,2019-01-11 10:13:00,317,I can understand the pilot's caution with bear spray. If it let loose in the cabin it would be a serious problem. I wonder if it could be enclosed in a secondary container and carried in the pontoon?
6279652,unchained,2019-01-16 12:15:00,208,can we see them?
6292936,Fishertsl,2019-02-24 18:24:00,1,Does anyone know where Pete Kraft is referring to? I would love to know where the fishing lake was that he fished in 2015. Tried to PM him. No response. Thanks!
6277302,vteye3,2019-01-10 09:23:00,496,I've never had an issue in black bear country at least a dozen trips. I've been fortunate enough to do 4 float (unguided) fishing trips in AK. We float 50-70 miles of virgin river camping-fishing as we float. We never eat where we are going to sleep. Outpost camps have fish cleaning stations an lots of smells enticing the blacks. We see plenty of brown bears . I think a big camp fire helps.
6277494,Ricky Spanish,2019-01-10 14:36:00,1298,"This guy is about 300yds from my house:https://www.waupacanow.com/2018/12/2...close-to-home/ I have not gone over to bother the poor guy, and it's the first thing I think of when walking my dogs in the dark, but I'll let everyone know if there's trouble."
6277682,fishron,2019-01-11 06:01:00,317,"Had a few bear encounters over the years and I thought of one that occurred in Denali park during a visit. We saw several grizzlies and amazingly saw bike riders with backpacks heading into the park on the same road. Our driver referred to them as meals on wheels. Most of the bear sightings I've had were in Lavendre Park in Quebec. Sightings is the key word because the tribe in the park hunt them year round. Any bear we saw was only interested in getting away from us as fast as possible. No doubt behavior learned over the generations. We did have an amazing encounter at a spot called Iroquois Pass. It's a narrow passage between two lakes and we came upon a tiny cub swimming between the shores. I could have easily scruffed him an brought him aboard. Not a good idea as his mother was no doubt close by. At our visit to Yellowstone last September there was an incident a couple of weeks earlier where a Mom and Dad and a ten year old son had encountered a bear while hiking a trail. The boy ran and the bear pursued and caught him. Fortunately, they had bear spray and successfully drove the bear away. The boy sustained enough damage to merit a hospital trip but it could have been much worse. Bear spray might be a good thing to carry. I do."
6277764,vteye3,2019-01-11 08:53:00,496,Float plane pilot gave me one of the worse chewing outs I've every had when i mentioned we had bear spray in his plane. Just a heads up if you are flying in with it.
6269382,ChuckD,2018-12-17 08:50:00,1581,Try a pack of wolves that refused to leave my friend's outpost cabin this past August. Day and night they would not leave for a week. Didn't dare want to go to the outhouse at night...glowing eyes in the woods. Lots of video because it was unbelievable..
6269416,johnboat,2018-12-17 10:54:00,2014,No thanks on the Wolf pack. I'd rather take my chances with a Blackie.
6269556,dschiebel,2018-12-18 00:18:00,85,"A few years ago we had a small black bear that would come while we were cleaning fish. Anyway my fishing buddy was scared to death of the massive psycho grizzly, so the next year he brought up some bells he wore around his neck to scare the bears away. Wee to game wardens flew in 2 days later and checked us. We were all good, but one of them leaned over and asked, "" Why is tinkerbell over there wearing bells around his neck"" Well I tried to explain that he thought they would scare the bears away. They both almost **** themselves they laughed so hard, then one takes out a camera to take photos of my buddy. As they were on the dock ready to fly away the one told my buddy that that last fisherman that he new that wore ""Bear Bells"" was eaten by 3 bears, they further stated that the bells just alert the bears that supper is coming. But on a positive note they stated that when we are reported missing they know just ring some bells the bad bears will come running and they will take them. When my buddy wasn't looking the bells were deposited in the outhouse. We now have a wrist rocket with rocks and bear spray."

After one trip he stopped by and asked if we had bear problems at that camp, as they seem to always have bears hanging around. ? I replied no and i asked if they kept a clean camp. He said yes . No garbage left on deck , fish scrap was hauled to island away from camp immediately after cleaning fish etc. He said ""we even BURN the bacon grease after breakfast , in the fire pit"". Some who do not bear hunt do not realize ,this practice is sometimes used while bear hunting to draw bears in. They just didn't realize that. Me being a bear hunter ,got a good laugh out of that . He just didn't know that and then got a good laugh himself. He said wait until I tell the boys that . I have got to the point the past two years ,have not done a fly in ,but spent a couple weeks at Bear Camp. The young bears are easy to pull into baits ,but not the old ones."

Got to use common since ."
6272392,unchained,2018-12-27 07:53:00,208,"Black bears? Grizzly bears? I've seen lots of river footage of bears and fishermen. I guess when food is plentiful they're pretty relaxed although if you're on their section of river they would rather you moved on. It's easy to villainize them but at the end of the day they don't want a fight...they'd rather stand up or bluff charge you away than get into and risk injury, as an injured bear is likely a dead bear and they know it."
6269256,pete kraft,2018-12-16 17:11:00,28,"In 2015 my son and returned to a lake that we had fished the previous summer, at the end of August. The camp was used mainly as a moose camp, and we were the first ones in 2014. Camp was rustic, no running water, a couple of light bulbs run off a picnic generator, no dock(it's on a river), but it was a nice setting and the fishing was phenomenal.......the best that the two of us had experienced in our 15 years of outpost camps.In 2014 we were unable to get into camp until day three, first 3 days were at another lake because of storm damage and downed trees.It was a fun trip, got to do a split trip and see another camp where we stopped to pick up a boat and strap it to the pontoons. Fast forward to 2015. This time it was the first week of August. We were able to get into camp on Friday, a day early. Oh..... the cabin had fallen off the stumps that served as the foundation and was jacked up and shimmed. but still pretty crooked. Oh well, lt's all about the fishing.Oh.....the propane fridge ""might be finicky, so we'll fly 200 lbs of ice in for you guys in a 4 foot long cooler. OK, it's all about the fishing and we were the first ones into camp this year too. Yes, the fridge was useless, but the promise was made to fly in more ice midweek, so we were OK with it. Oh.............the door wouldn't shut because of the crooked cabin. It opened into the cabin and if you slammed it really hard it kind of stuck. When leaving there was some bailing wire that we would wrap from the doorknob to a 16 penny nail to keep it shut. You can see where this is going. Saturday at noon we walked up to camp, me first, and saw the door open and food wrap debris and an uneaten bag of peanuts laying on the deck. I stepped back to survey the situation, looking into the cabin and a look around to see lf he was still in there. Fortunately not. He had gotten into the fridge which we were using for veggies and dry goods (mouse proofing them) Ate everything in the fridge, but for some reason did not get into our cooler That night we put a barrier up at the door that didn't even close and tried to barrier the windows, some of which, were at floor level. All OK until Sunday night. At about 10:00 my son went out for a last pee and walked out on the deck for a face to face with bear. Ran inside white as a ghost. I jokingly asked if it was the skeeters or the bear. BEAR. The bear stalked us all night. He came up to the door 3 or 4 times. Each time we would open a window and bang pots and yell. When not on the deck, we could hear him circling the cabin. This went on until we finally both fell asleep at maybe 3 am. We did find a 2x4 that was the perfect length to jam under the 5 dollar doorknob which helped, but fell asleep with one eye shut and ears open. At about 5:30, Boom Boom Boom. The bear was ramming the door. I was about 5 feet from it and flew up and started screaming, opened the window and screamed some more. I watched him run down the path to the lake and disappear. This was the first year of bringing a Sat. phone into camp, and never will we not be out of contact again. Worth the 100 dollars, I think. 10 minutes after bear left camp I called the outfitter. He was able to pick us up by 10:00 that morning and fly us into another camp, which turned out to be good fishing. Talked with the outfitter later. The next group in were moose hunters. First night in while cooking out the bear walked up to the deck and met his demise. He was estimated to go around 450 lbs. The night we lived through it, we didn't know how things would end up. The outfitter was great, neither one of us wanted to hang around, even with a rifle and have to deal with the threat every day and night.It goes to show that you never know what can happen, and reinforces how important keeping a clean camp is, to be aware, and guys, bring the sat phone into camp. Things can go south in a minute."
