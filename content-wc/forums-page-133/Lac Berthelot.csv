We always caught walleyes and Northerns in areas that were necked down and had current. There is rapids about 10 miles form the lodge that was always good. We also caught a 36"" sturgeon while walleye fishing. I hope by now the road is improved. good luck, Seanik"

Rough road going in good people running a basic camp. We caught fish pretty much everywhere you would expect to not to far from camp. pulled a nice sturgeon out of the rapids."
