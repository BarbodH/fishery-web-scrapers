Finding lodging and launch access near or east of Long Point, Ontario would not only get you lots of HUGE Smallmouth bass but also Largemouth, Pike and of course WALLEYE..... It's not uncommon for bass anglers to catch 6-7 pound smallmouth bass daily on Erie these days."
6291020,kzoofisher,2019-02-18 15:58:00,5144,Thanks for the tip but I'm not far from Erie and many similar great smallmouth waters. The object of a trip like this is more than just getting fish over the gunwale.
6291024,Bobby Winds,2019-02-18 16:11:00,10817,"Although you're not far from Erie, you are not near Erie's best smallmouth waters by at least 150 miles nor did you post you wanted more than put fish over the gunwale."
6291060,fsz,2019-02-18 18:33:00,144,"Bobby winds- I think kzoo does clarify his intent in post #8. Plus, to say the long point area is the best bass fishing on erie is a difficult case to make. There are many great areas some are better at different times if the year, some are better for numbers some for size. I will admit I have not fished long point but other areas of the lake can easily produce â75 lb daysâ per angler (example 25 bass at 3lbs) any time of the year. The solitude and scenery of a remote northern lake is difficult to replicate on the Great Lakes. Hence,the original post. Unfortunately, I can't offer any suggestions based on personal experience for a northern Lake I've posted seeking input on this issue as well. I have read about Beauchene which is an hour east of north bay and talked to a few people who have been there. Fishing there is good for numbers and size from what I hear but pretty pricy. The lake is drive to but not open to the public the outfitter has exclusive rights."
6291062,kzoofisher,2019-02-18 18:41:00,5144,"Sigh, try reading posts 1&8. I'm sure you're right about how much better eastern Erie is than the water around here and I hope all the people wasting time in Michigan head that way. But, the trouble with Erie and the other Great Lakes is that they don't fish poppers well for a variety of reasons. And for me, the point of a vacation is to go do the things I really like to do, maybe better than I can do them at home. One of those things is catching walleye all day long on jigs and plastics, un-disturbed by the world at large. Another is catching smallmouth on poppers in the same sort of conditions. There's a little pond in Vermont that fits the bill for smallies except that more than two guys fish it out before a week is up. I'd like to try to find another one that 4-6 of us can fish."

6290528,kzoofisher,2019-02-17 06:44:00,5144,"Prefer a fly in and top water but a single cabin that is a drive or boat to is fine. Nothing further west than Vermillion Bay, can be east of Superior, any month but June is doable. Don't want to camp. Would consider a houseboat also but I'm concerned that fish might be hard to find on water that big and the solitude not that great. Am I wrong about that."
6290550,Namegosikaa,2019-02-17 07:55:00,61,"Hastie lake out of lauzon aviation, it's been profiled on a few shows and seems to have good reviews."
6290556,Baseline,2019-02-17 08:05:00,3207,Lower Manitou Lake. Barker Bay resort - They have a boat in resort and two outpost cabins. Excellent smallmouth and northern. Added bonus of lake trout fishing; musky too.
6290704,Obabikon,2019-02-17 17:08:00,2370,"Well... technically, it would barely be west of Vermillion. Quite a bit south of it though.... Kishkutena Lake has fantastic small mouth fishing. You'd fly out of Nestor Falls. There are 3-4 cabins on the entire lake. No resorts. It's a pretty big lake too. Shane at NorthWest has a very nice cabin.http://www.northwestflying.com/outpo...shkutena-lake/"
6290730,kzoofisher,2019-02-17 18:55:00,5144,"Thanks for the replies, lots of good options here."
6290784,jfaisten,2019-02-18 05:00:00,1060,because you're From Kalamazoo I'm guessing you've fished lake Saint Clair for smallmouth. Arguably the worlds best lake for smallies Seems that would be a lot less travel and a lot less cost for better results. Good luck
6290788,Hawker,2019-02-18 05:47:00,3967,I'd have to second Kishkutena as a premier smallmouth fishery! Perry & Carol of Young's Wilderness Camp (http://youngswildernesscamp.com/) have a very nice fly in outpost cabin there and nice boats with bow mount trolling motors (4).
6290822,kzoofisher,2019-02-18 07:08:00,5144,"Oh yeah, we've got great smallmouth and walleye in easy driving distance. I'm looking into shaking up my Canadian experience with something a little different. The place I go now has smallmouth but not great numbers and not up shallow in August. I'll be contacting these lodges about a trip for next year or the year after with a focus on fly fishing with poppers. Post spawn is usually good for that so early July can work early and late in the day. Other species to fill up the middle of the day is a definite bonus."
6290840,Bill Krejca,2019-02-18 07:39:00,6107,"Re: Something different, and fly fishing - A long time ago, I waded stretches of LOW using a fly rod and surface poppers/streamers for small mouth. This was during later June and July time frame. I can't remember seeing anyone, other than me, doing this. It is a fun time, and definitely unlike the typical lake experience. Bill"
6290910,DeBo,2019-02-18 10:45:00,211,A touch further west than what you mentioned but I have heard/read very good things about the Rex Lake outpost out of Halley's Camp. Couple portage options there too. Halley's gets great reviews. Great smallie outposts seem to be somewhat rare since smallies don't range very far north. Kish as mentioned has great reviews for smallies and you will probably hook or musky or 2 in the process if that interests you.
