6292004,DeBo,2019-02-21 11:05:00,211,Considering a crown land camping adventure on Nipigon. I don’t have a kicker and don’t want one normally but not comfortable without a 2nd form of propulsion on Nipigon.Do any places rent 10hp(Or similar) outboards for 4-5 days? Anywhere from the Twin Cities - Duluth - Thunder Bay -Nipigon.A quick google search didn’t help.
6292664,Aspencreek,2019-02-23 15:34:00,2911,There seems to me that camping on Crown Land by non-residents is frowned upon. Did I understand that right.
6292744,DeBo,2019-02-23 20:17:00,211,There is a permit to purchase for non-residents like my self. There are green zones that are off limits for non residents.So depending it could be frowned upon but done right seems like just fine in my research.

6292942,That Minnesota guy,2019-02-24 18:41:00,8293,What date you looking at? I have a 15hp Merc I might be talked into you using. I'm spliced into my main gas tank so you would need a tank & line.
