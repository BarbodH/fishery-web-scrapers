6287642,jambi,2019-02-08 09:55:00,504,Young's Wilderness Camp on LOTW. Excellent musky fishing near the camp in Stevens and Stoney Portage bays. Great walleye fishing (and smallmouth). I did 10 trips with my Dad here before switching to flyouts. Camp is the cleanest around. Staff is wonderful. Meals are outstanding. Can't wait to go back here when I get tired of flyouts. PS - leave your boat at home; their boats are super comfortable.

At least you have decided on where you MIGHT be able to get in for 2021. What you are experiencing is ""Paralysis by analysis"" it happens to people all the time."

6282886,Cover Dog,2019-01-26 18:32:00,303,"Wife wants to cast for Walleye, I’m looking for Musky. She doesn’t want to cook on vacation so we need American Plan. Will drive in, towing the boat in my signature.Any suggestions greatly appreciated. Have fished NE Ontario since the 60’s, now too commercial and need to GO WEST for great fishing.Thanks in advance,Cover Dog"
6282892,Obabikon,2019-01-26 19:15:00,2370,www.obabikon.com sounds like a decent option. I hear the owner does some husband/wife discounts where she comes at the youth rate.
6282920,prov1800,2019-01-26 21:44:00,5010,If you are looming for the American plan and still get vreat fishing checkout cedar point resort on cedar lake. Or checkout manotak lodge on perrault lake.both have good walleye and muskies and can get to either through a narrows.
6283436,rockape,2019-01-28 08:59:00,215,I 2nd Cedar Point Resort. GREAT central location on the lake. TONS of muskies in that lake. Great walleye fishing too.
6283492,camp chef,2019-01-28 10:39:00,915,Take a look at Big north Lodge on the Winnipeg river. we will be going back for our 6 th trip this spring. Check out the pics on their facebook page.
6283500,Cover Dog,2019-01-28 10:59:00,303,Thanks to all that have responded so far. I have some research ahead of me. Cover Dog
6283518,emma17,2019-01-28 11:54:00,436,I'll second Obabikon- it's a great camp and location for both species.
6283584,NARDA 1,2019-01-28 14:21:00,636,www.birchdalelodge.com They have a unique American plan where you order off of a menu instead of everyone having to eat the same thing each night. Check out the menu on the website. https://www.birchdalelodge.com/bullpitmenu.pdf The lodge is on Eagle Lake which is a great fishery for Walleye and Musky.
6285930,Ruddiger,2019-02-03 07:44:00,649,"Howdy, Depending upon you expectations for Muskie, Witch Bay Camp may work for you as well. I too live in northeast Ohio and can sympathize with you on the status of eastern Ontario waters. Take care, Ruddiger"
6285966,Bill Krejca,2019-02-03 08:41:00,6107,"Both the Obabikon area and Cedar are two of my favorites. Obabikon is a little farther off the beaten path, nice camp with fishing nearby. Bill"
