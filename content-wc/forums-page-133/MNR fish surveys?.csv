6291270,team walleye,2019-02-19 13:24:00,336,Does the Ontario MNR do any fish surveys of lakes? I was curious to look at one of the lake we fish up there.
6291272,Obabikon,2019-02-19 13:34:00,2370,"They have not posted anything that I have seen yet, but they certainly have been doing constant surveys in our area the past two years."
6291284,team walleye,2019-02-19 14:15:00,336,It would be cool to see the results.
6291302,Pooch,2019-02-19 14:56:00,4618,In 2009 we made a late season return trip (third trip of the year) to Lake Savant just for the reason of watching the MNR survey the lake. Never did see any data. Any information we received was just through conversations with the MNR staff. It was a large and time consuming operation. Mostly young folks working.Pooch
6291308,Obabikon,2019-02-19 15:11:00,2370,"I should have been clear with the surveying... In our area, a boat of college students drive around and ask all the fishermen what types and how many of each all the fishermen they have seen have caught."
6291326,Pooch,2019-02-19 16:10:00,4618,"I thought that was the how the Iowa guys ""surveyed"" a lake.Sorry BK I just couldn't help myself.Pooch"
6291348,fsz,2019-02-19 17:39:00,144,If you go to the fish ON-line feature from the MNR many lakes have mnr survey data that list average size and specie composition. These lakes all seem to be âreasonably accessibleâ (not fly-in only). I find the data very interesting.
6291360,team walleye,2019-02-19 18:25:00,336,Thank you. I will check it out!
