(Lake of the Woods, Eagle, Lac Seul, Rainy, etc) I have some buddies that just do not like tillers so looking to see if other options exist. Thanks"
6293196,emma17,2019-02-25 16:54:00,436,Witch Bay Camp offers both tiller and console. Pretty remote area of Lake of the Woods.
6293288,jimirjr,2019-02-26 06:05:00,1149,TOMAHAWK RESORT out of Sioux Narrows offers those options..

For some, the drawback is no walleyes. Great Small Mouth and Northern lake. Not too big, very easy to learn. I have been there several times and enjoyed every trip. Good luck wherever you go. Tx. Jig Tyr"
6293452,Obabikon,2019-02-26 12:42:00,2370,Terry at Morson Marina on Lake of the Woods has one or two nicer boat rentals. I believe 90hp deep v trackers. http://www.wildernesshouseboats.com/
