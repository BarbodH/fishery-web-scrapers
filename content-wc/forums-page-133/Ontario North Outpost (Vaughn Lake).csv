I would suffer through a few inconveniences to fish world class waters like that for free. Regardless of how bad the experience was deemed, I still think that's a pretty generous offer on the part of your outfitter."
1343904,phishfearme,2011-08-26 07:06:00,1242,"so, you bring up a group of 10 and he's giving you 2 slots for free - sorry solo but i don't think this is a reasonable deal at all - a 20% discount after ruining your one trip every year doesn't cut it. and, EYES on fritz - how was the fising? you provided no report. if you experienced similar in terms of numbers and size as did the original poster then you need to try someplace else. phish"
1344038,Pikeslayer8,2011-08-26 13:27:00,1460,"Yes, we have to overcome the obstacles we are faced with upon camp arrival. I certainly think all of Weby13 complaints do not rise to ruining the trip. I'm with Solo in that 20% is way generous resolution. Looks to me it was the fishing that was the problem(9"" to 17"" walleye in small numbers).Personally have never had a bad trip. Don't know what it's like. Flown into camps before after a bear had thrown the fridge through the wall but it was still a great trip. Been on plenty of trips where outgoing party leaves camp in shoddy shape, whatever, still great trips. Had broke seats, mice and critters, leaky boats and engine issues--still great trips but never been on trip struggling to catch 9"" to 17"" walleye. I've had days but never trips. Of course fishing is like golf. You always remember your last good shot(or fish).The camp I go to (NWO Wabakimi) is old, buillt in the 1970's by Ted Davis RIP, expanded and modernized in the late 90's. Rustic not fancy. We don't write our names on the walls but some have put pictures and shrines of lost loved ones who loved the place. Vic, don't change it please.Running water, solar powered lights has us spoiled nowadays. I'm sure enough guys remember how fun it was to haul all their water and lighting the mantles(where's the spares)"
1344107,Skywagon,2011-08-26 17:22:00,1106,"Even though they fly in, you can still get there by boat. Does not impress me (I have access to a boat cache there, big deal). If I had to spend that kind of money for a fly-in, I would expect more. There are better lakes available for the same money, without people boating in. I would add, writing your name on the wall is tacky, don't get that."
6290958,Guest,2019-02-18 13:16:00,0,Was out at Vaughn last year and everything was better than expected. The service was great and the fishing was fabulous ---- some of the best fishing I ever had. Walleyes were all 16-20 inches and many of them (usually 50-75 a day) the biggest was 28 inches. Northern fishing good with the biggest 44 inches what a whooper jumped out of the water 3 times.....almost like a Muskie with a lot of 30+ inch pike. We caught many perch which we like to do on trips that have perch....great eating. The smallmouth bass fishing was slow as it's a bigger body of water but when you found them it was a lot of fun.....biggest 18 inches. The cabin was in great shape and even has a flush toilet for those night time chores. No problems with anything. The boats are big (16' Lunds) and great motors Yamaha's 15hp 4 stroke that started on the first pull. I would recommend this out post to anyone......first class place and very good service from Wilderness Air
1324533,Weby13,2011-06-30 15:12:00,57,It would be nice if he offered us a little cash back! Nothing big. If hes willing to offer us 2 free trips just give us back the money the 2 trips would cost! The place was terrible and I would never want to go back to that outpost!!!
1324534,Mike Borger,2011-06-30 15:16:00,1554,Doesn't he have any other camps that might interest you?
1325473,Weby13,2011-07-03 08:22:00,57,He has 1 other camp that looks nice but I would be worried about diving 13 hours and have some of the same problems that we had at Vaughn Lake! If 1 camps conditions were so bad I'd be worried about how the other camp is!
1325490,TIGHTLINER,2011-07-03 09:43:00,223,Unless i missed it what outfitter has this lake??
1325545,rnnonmt,2011-07-03 13:46:00,992,"Weby, sorry for the kidding but the owner wants you back because it sounds like you cleaned up the place. Now all kidding aside I wouldn't go back either. I went and checked out their website and it is very misleading based on what you described happened to you and the conditions of everything. I looked at the ""rates"" page and for that kind of money which wasnt considerably less than what we pay for much nicer places. Once again sorry you had a less than favorable experience. We look forward to our annual trip as well and couldnt imagine having to go through the trouble you did!"
1325560,Skywagon,2011-07-03 15:12:00,1106,"Tightliner, read post #1 for your answer."
1325576,TIGHTLINER,2011-07-03 16:34:00,223,THANKS SKYWAGON I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE HAD ANOTHER CUP OF COFFEE TO GET THE MIND WORKING. HOWEVER I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS OUTFITTER BEFORE. HIS WEB SITE LOOKS GOOD AS ANYONE ELSES BUT THE FIRST POST TELLS IT ALL. THIS IS A GREAT WEB SITE WITH ALL KINDS OF INFO BOTH GOOD AND BAD.
1343795,EYES on Fritz,2011-08-25 16:42:00,1,"Got back a week ago from Vaughn Lake. I would go back in a minutes notice.The Place was great for a FLYin Fishing. Great Cabin, Generator worked Refrigerators worked Water was great the bugs were bad but the screen porch kept them at bay. I wonder if you had such a Bad time why would you write your name on the wall so everyone would know you were there. A BIG ""Weby 13"" on the wall I actually took a picture of it and some others I always find it funny when people write their names all over. I read your post before I went and was a tad nervous about the trip but everything was great. Loved the place and will go back as many times as my pocket book will let me. I am planning on a trip next year with my boys and grand kids. Cannot wait to see them catch some big fish.Not a true outdoorsmen I guess. Anyone else would not turn down a chance to fish those waters for free. Bring a tent and a sleeping bad and fish all day for free you are, well silly.EYES on Fritz"
1343842,JETSTER,2011-08-25 20:38:00,448,"Whats a little mouse turds right,I would of brought a bb gun and made it a blast and cast!!!!!"
1343865,Weby13,2011-08-25 22:13:00,57,When you plan a year for a trip and 75% of what the owner tells you is a lie its a bit disappointing!!! The owner blamed the fly in sevice for all the problems that were at the outpost and told me told me he would get back to me asap. That was the 3rd week of June and its now almost September. After 2 phone messages and 3 emails I have still not heard from Tom! Man up and at least return my phone call or take the easy road out and reurn a email!!! My contract was with Tom and not the L&m who flew us in!!! I dont care if he offered us 10 free trips why would I want to go back to a place where my group had a horrible experience and were lied to about so many things??? I put my name on the wall like everyone else because there was a marker on a rope hanging from the wall with hundreds of others names. If it makes you feel better next year when you head up there you can X out my name and I wont have any hard feelings!!! Im glad you had a great time! Maybe alot of the problems we had were corrected since we were there and thats what of should been done! Maybe Im not a true of a outdoorsman as you but the once a year I get to go to Canada with my family and friends Id like to have the best experience possible!!! I dont know about you but I take pride in everything I do and I wish Tom would too!!! Its easy to sit back 800 miles and south and put money in the bank! Maybe he should get up to his buisness once or twice a year and put some hard work into it!!!!
1323289,Weby13,2011-06-27 15:25:00,57,"My group of 9 just returned from Vaughn Lake. 75 percent of what the web site said was incorrect! We got off the plane and walked into the outpost. It was filthy dirty! Mouse droppings all over the beds, table counter tops anf floor. The furniture in the house and screened porch was about 20 years old with holes and mice and critters living inside. The dishes wre all filty and some of them were thrown in the fire because they were full of mold! He promised radio communication with the air base and there was none. The 2 cabins were completely disgusting!!! We didnt bring up bottled water because he said there was a well with graet drinking water. The well didnt work and looked like it hadnt in years! We had to spend 2 hours cutting the grass and 4 hours cleaning the place up to make it somewhat liveable for the week! Some of the boats had leaks, two of the engines stalled constantly, the gas tanks leaked and half of the boat seats were broken. If you are thinking of booking a trip with Tom Barz and Ontario North Outpost think about going elsewhere. The only thing that was great about our trip was Shane, Larry and Mary of L and M fly ins! They were great people to deal with!!!"
1323319,joeman79,2011-06-27 17:09:00,417,Sounds BAD to me. Other than that how was the fishing?? Maybe they dropped you off at the wrong lake LOL. No seriously that woud s#$k to pay to have to stay in that kind of conditions. What did they say to you when you asked them about the horrible conditions?
1323336,Skywagon,2011-06-27 17:45:00,1106,"Just curious, but if you spent the money on a fly-in, why not go to a remote lake? I am sure L&M could hook you up with something. Lots of remote lakes within 20 minutes flight of Vaughn, hopefully some with better accommodations."
1323431,Weby13,2011-06-27 20:40:00,57,"The fishing was so so. 9 guys went and we caught 9"" to 17"" Walleyes in small numbers. The biggest Walleye was 23"". Northerns averaged about 18"" and the largest was 38"". 80% of the group decided on Vaughn Lake so majority rules. Were kicking ourselves in the behind for not going with L and M as they had a opening at one of there camps. I guess you live and learn. I just wish our lesson wasnt so costly!!!!!"
1323441,JDP,2011-06-27 21:12:00,1457,"Have you spoken with Tom Barz regarding your terible experience with the cabins, grounds, boats and drinking water?"
1323723,Weby13,2011-06-28 15:24:00,57,I sent Tom a e mail and his reply was that he was very sorry. He thought everything was taken care of. He offered my group of 10 two free trips in the future. I dont think I would be able to convince anyone in my group to go back!
1323731,Mike Borger,2011-06-28 15:37:00,1554,"Kudos to the outfitter, that is an incredibly generous offer.Personally I'd take him up on it."
1323745,Knoxabilly,2011-06-28 15:59:00,225,Sounds like a horrible experience but that is amazing of the outfitter to offer you guys 2 free trips as a make up! Kudos to the owner for owning up and making things right.
1323894,walleye1952,2011-06-28 23:56:00,13,Based on what was posted here.......The owner should have offered a substancial refund of your $$ spent. Who really would want to go back to such a place even if it was free in the future? Most people would Not go back...perhaps this is the owner is counting on..no $$ out of his pocket.
1324312,SinOrSwim,2011-06-29 23:22:00,1528,"Interesting. Those pictures look really nice on the website. However, I don't know if I've seen a website be as ""preachy"" as they are on what to bring and how to do it. We have been doing fly-ins for about 15 to 18 years and our outfitter works with us for extra weight. They don't give us a ""recommended"" food list. I have no interest in eating canned soup when I'm up there. We actually go the opposite. We eat AMAZING food up there. But, we plan. Things that can be chopped and frozen are done before hand. We use tortillas for wraps for shore lunch. Little weight and throw some fried fish in there with some slaw and it's an amazing fish taco. There are ways to do it. But, they seemed awfully stringent.Sorry to hear you had a crappy trip. We had one a several years ago. Guy ""promised"" all kinds of stuff. Turned out, he sold his outpost cabins a few weeks prior so very little of the stuff he promised was actually done. The positive side, we met our new outfitter who flew us back. Have been with him for 13 or 14 years. I wouldn't take the free trip either"
