Thanks for putting up with this post that doesn't mean much this time of year"
6284490,Limeyangler,2019-01-30 14:03:00,563,"Kinda hard to determine water levels with 3 feet of snow on top of 3 feet of ice. Water levels were slightly up on the lakes before freeze up, but it was a long , dry summer, Lac Seul was pretty low at our end. I might be wrong on this, but from my observations over the years it decent water levels this year will depend on how much more snow we get between now and ice out and how wet spring is."
6284496,ia bhtr,2019-01-30 14:15:00,212,"Yep , I know it doesn't mean much now , hoping for more snow for you guys and hopefully with a lot more water content than last years snow , on a side note bringing the wife on her 1st trip ever to Canada fishing in August , going to try Dinorwic over in your neck of the woods , thought maybe the crappies would be a good starter trip for her"

It came back very nicely during the late fall months. You will also see that the outflow through the turbines at Ear Falls is also about average. Go back and click on the graph for Lake St. Joseph and you'll that this water level is also getting back to normal. Remember, Lake St. Joseph feeds in to Lac Seul on the east end. That's why there is always a current flow up there in Chamberlain Narrows."

6284648,ia bhtr,2019-01-30 20:30:00,212,"yep , 4 sure pro v , we actually will be in the English river below the Manitou ( or Ear Falls - not sure which name is proper ) dam , last year we could not get into our 2 favorite lakes because of no water , just really crossing my fingers , hoping for some help from winter precip and reeeaaally hoping for spring rains to maybe get water back to 2017 levels , no matter what , just like you said , we will have some really good fishing and if we have to , learn some new spots , Thanks for the thoughts guys , like I say , just getting a little impatient Hopefully this year doesn't "" require "" 2 props"
6285172,tv4fish,2019-02-01 05:39:00,2694,"Regarding the water levels on Lac Seul, etc. I was under the impression that it was/is pretty typical that the dam at Ear Falls will have to ""draw down"" the water level in the spring for required power supply demand?https://www.opg.com/generating-power...s-station.aspx"
6285496,ia bhtr,2019-02-01 18:31:00,212,"Yep , only thing worrying me a little is 2nd week of last June when we were there , not much snowfall the previous winter and limited rainfall last spring , water was so low we couldn't get into a couple lakes that the previous year we went into with the big motors trimmed down , just hoping there is plenty of water so the gates are open this June and levels closer to 2017"
6291530,tlee,2019-02-20 10:00:00,65,"I'm heading to Lac Seul the 8-15th of June. It will be our first time fishing there. Does anyone have any tips, tactics or general locations to give us a start. We will be staying at Whitewing Lodge up by Ear Falls."
