6282720,oldlund,2019-01-25 20:43:00,209,I've been to most of them. I like Best Western for good trailer parking with a plug-in and breakfast. Book early. I've stayed at many of the others because I have often forgot to book in time!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro
6290714,Hunts1,2019-02-17 17:35:00,123,Our group has been happy with the Best Western in Sioux Lookout. Have stayed there once or twice a year for the past 10 years. Good parking and breakfast included. There is a new hotel across the street. Opened up a year or two ago. We haven't stayed there as we are content with our experience at Best Western.
6290834,rockape,2019-02-18 07:33:00,215,I stayed at the Lamplighter about 10 years ago. Totally fine conditions. Good home cooked breakfast! Call Greg at Northumbrian too. He might have a cabin open for you and it is right there on 72.
6291228,Lovetofish,2019-02-19 10:56:00,458,"I have stayed at the Best Western many times with no complaints. Last year we stayed at the new motel across the street, Days Inn. I've been told that the Days Inn in Sioux Lookout is no longer in business? Anyone have the scoop on that?"
6291432,Skywagon,2019-02-20 04:25:00,1106,The short story is that the Natives are getting the Days Inn and it will no longer be used as a motel (Canadian tax payers dollars at work).
6282324,Willyboy123,2019-01-24 11:47:00,73,Hi. We're headed up to Lake St. Joseph the first week of June and will need a hotel one night on the way there. Any suggestions for something around Sioux Lookout? We don't need anything fancy. Just clean with a decent shower. Thanks much!
6282342,Skywagon,2019-01-24 13:41:00,1106,"The Best Western might be a good place to start looking, I have heard it is one of the better places in town, but have not stayed there. I would guess that the Lamplighter might be alright, it is an older style looking motel on the south side of town, but would guess it is clean. I rented a couple of rooms at the Sunset Inn last winter for guys that were helping me haul in material for a cabin build, bad choice, the place reeked of cigarette smoke and was dirty, that one is on the bottom of my list. The Forest Inn appears ok from the outside, but when I went through their lot a month or so on the way to the restaurant, it looked like they may be catering to some of the same type of clientel that Sunset Inn has, I would be suspect. It would be good to book now, Sioux Lookout gets busy in the summer."
6282384,maddogg,2019-01-24 14:22:00,178,We always stay at the Lamplighter Inn it's always was clean.
6282396,Willyboy123,2019-01-24 15:00:00,73,"Thanks for the info, guys. I'll make a couple of calls to see what's available."
6282402,stjoeguy,2019-01-24 15:09:00,979,We've stayed at Forest Inn and Lamplighter. Where are you going on Lake St. Joseph? Our group will be up there the 2nd week of June at the Winoga cabin.
6282458,coldtuna,2019-01-24 17:02:00,25,"My son and I stayed at Sunset Inn last summer. That place is gross. The guy at the front desk had his hand down his throat chewing his finger nails off when we checked in, among other charming goings on. Just say no to that place."
6282464,Slim03,2019-01-24 17:07:00,159,Best Western is nice. Stayed there last year. Free breakfast as well.
6282466,Willyboy123,2019-01-24 17:17:00,73,We go to Camp Lake St. Joseph. Favorite week of the year!
6282468,jaym,2019-01-24 17:29:00,89,"Always stay at Best Western, no complaints"
6282504,stjoeguy,2019-01-24 21:19:00,979,"If you happen to be at the landing when the Winoga barge is launching I'll be there. Just ask for Stjoeguy. I used to stay at Camp Lake St. Joseph. Merle, Doug & Shelley are great people."
