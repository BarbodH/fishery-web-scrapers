Too many of the closer places have not done that and the fishiing is hit and miss at beat. Sometimes it's better to spend a little more or drive/fly further to experience the best fishing experience, imho."
1084698,Heft Peterson,2009-03-01 14:40:00,4,You should check out Bluffy Lake. Always plenty of Pike for the taking. Casting the weeds and trolling the weed edges are excellent. Check out Bluffylake.com. There is a great video clip of Cody and Cody outdoors filming for their show. Keith and Deb have the only lodge on the lake. It is only four hours north of International Falls. They have openings for the end of June and on. This lake used to be fly in only until the logging roads got close enough. If you talk to them tell them Chad and Skye say hi
1084705,Captain Ron,2009-03-01 15:21:00,14,"Hi Deb We had 39 pike that were between 40 & 45 inches, with 180+ That were in the slot. { 27.5 to 35.5 } This was the best year we hav had yet.I im hoping our trip this year will be as good."
1084783,pike50plus,2009-03-01 20:32:00,584,They show an awful lot of big fish being keep? Is this cathc and realease on only the slot???
1084796,Captain Ron,2009-03-01 21:56:00,14,"We do catch alot of big pike,but we release them all. are group only eats walleye, we release all the big fish we catch. i wish every one would do that so the fishing can remain this good or even better for years to come. a picture is all anyone needs. if you want to mount a fish get a replica they last forever."
1083802,Buckfever1,2009-02-25 20:58:00,4,"Mikep, I live in Pittsburgh and spoke with a gentleman from Wanikewin Lodge. Looking for some good walleye fishing, the gentleman I spoke with said June and July are the best months. I am assuming since you spent 5 years there it must be good? Can you please give me some more info on this place? Thanks"
1084118,Captain Ron,2009-02-26 23:48:00,14,"try northwestern ontario, the red lake area has many great destinationsred lake, gullrock lake, pakwash lake, and many fly out lakes as well.this area has some real world class fishing."

1084436,Deb Martin,2009-02-28 08:32:00,9,"""Hello everyone. I've never been fishing on Canadian lakes before. I am looking for a place were I can take my father to go pike fishing. Years ago I heard stories of Lake Nipising. I live in Cleveland, Ohio and Im not sure what cottages/lakes are the best. Im planning a trip for summer. Any advice or information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks""Oh, man, have you got choices! Tell me more and I can better help. How old is your father and what is he capable of? How far can he travel? What kind of accommodations will he need? Are we talking 50 or 90 years old here? When in the summer? June? July? August? Makes a difference in some places.How light do you want to travel? Do you want to bring your own boat/motor and all your food or are you looking to show up and jump in the boat waiting at the dock after the kitchen has prepared your breakfast and packed your shore lunch?Is the adventure as important as the fishing or are you looking to get there quickly and fish hard?Tell me a little bit about what Northern Pike fishing is to you? Size? Numbers? Eating or just catching? I'm all ears.d"
1084445,Deb Martin,2009-02-28 09:14:00,9,"First of all, some full disclosure here. I am not employed by Cameron Lake Fishing Lodges nor do I have ownership in the camp (sure wish I did). But I do some work for them here in Michigan (shows and booking and website) in exchange for some fishing time. Secondly, I want to give the best advice I can here, which means Cameron Lake is not for everyone and I won't claim it is. Thirdly, I fish a ton of other lakes in N. Ontario each year and I'll gladly recommend other camps if I think they would be a better fit for someone. And lastly, I get no financial rewards for booking someone at Cameron Lake Fishing Lodges. I get to go fish whether I book 100 people or no people. Now that I've got that out of the way...Everything Walleyegetter is saying here is right on. Cameron Lake Fishing Lodges, however, is right on Cameron Lake. So once you've made the trip down the river to camp, no more traveling the river (unless you want to fish it) until the end of your week and you head back to catch the train. The boats have 15 hp Honda motors so your trip to camp is about one hour.If you are considering Cameron Lake, I highly recommend staying at the camp on Cameron rather than staying in Oba and running the river every day. Storms come up quick and that river run can get real boring.Oba's population is about 7 full-time residents right now with some additional summer folk and some RR employees. There's nothing to do in town--no stores, bars, restaurants--so, again, stay at the lake.7 pike and 3 walleye for every 10 casts is right on. My best week was 447 fish. My partner and I averaged a fish in the boat about every 3 1/2 minutes. My best day was 67 fish (mostly walleye) in 75 minutes. I'd just gotten to camp and I had about an hour and fifteen minutes before the sun went down. No partner that time. Just me. Granted I did not land every fish. If I saw it, I counted it. If I did not see it, no count.Now that I've got the best days out of the way, I have to tell you I've never had a ""bad"" day on Cameron Lake. Some days are Super Great and some days are just Great. It does not seem to matter what time of year. Both of my best days were in July, which is often a tough time to fish Walleye.In my opinion, minnows and crawlers are a waste of time on Cameron Lake. I do just fine with cheap Lucky Strike spoons. Take lots. The perch, if you can find them, are 12 to 18 inches. Just a wonderful place.DownsideIf you want to take your own boat, you've got to drive to Hearst and then come back down to Oba on 77 miles of some pretty rough roads.There is no fly-in service associated with the camp. You can book with Hawk Air or Air Dale but they will take care of their regular camps first.The Algoma Central Train is the best way in but for some that's not enjoyable.Pack well. Once you're there, you're there. No supplies in Oba and the camp has limited supplies.Do your own cooking. Personally, I prefer that. But some don't.That's about it for Cameron. Just wanted to chime in when I see one of my favorite lakes pop up.d"
1084538,pike50plus,2009-02-28 18:14:00,584,See the PM I sent you
1084555,Mikep007,2009-02-28 19:12:00,77,"Sure thing. My email is [email protected] if you want to reach me directly. First, Ken and Dee Baker and their family run the lodge and could not be nicer people. The food is great, the cabins are old but decent and their is plenty of water. We've gone mostly in August and walleyes SUCK in August...camp is lucky to get a few a day without going 17 miles to French. However, bass and pike are plentiful and you'll get plenty of shots at the river system in all the bays and areas. The walleye are probably great in June (we heard that all the time) but I'd avoid July. Actually, we were told the first weekend in July is the BEST because bass and pike open in the season on July 1 whereas before that you have to put them all back -- only walleye in June. The boats are 14' Lunds with 15HP motors -- we'd drive 17 miles to the French in about an hour, just for a change of scenery and shots at walleye. Boat traffic can be noticeable, as there are many cabins out there...out west is no problem, out east by the Indian reservation are some jet skis / rec boaters...not a tremendous amount though. The water is easy to navigate. Check this out http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=134127Shows you our spots last year and our path.Email if you want more details.Mike"
1084584,Captain Ron,2009-02-28 23:59:00,14,"hi Deb, i have been fishing northwestern onterio for the last 25 years. my group and I started out fishing red lake. the fishing there is quite good.about 7 years ago we changed to pakwash lake,the northern pike fishing there is great. last year we were there the second week of june. we cought over 600 pike between three of use for the week. we also got limits of walleye ever day and some nice smallmouth bass. we stay at Brownlee's holiday north lodge, its a nice place. the owner and his family are verry nice and verry helpful, will tell you were to go and what to use.there website is holidaynorthlodge.ca and email is [email protected] check it out."
1084621,Deb Martin,2009-03-01 08:48:00,9,"Thanks Cap'n Ron. I'm always looking for a new camp/lake to play at. I'm check 'em out! 600 Northerns for 3 in a week is impressive, indeed. That' would make my heart sing. I'd just as soon get out of bass waters. But if I can catch a lot of pike, I'd be one happy girl. What about the sizes of those 600 northerns, Ron?"

1083127,Hombre Robusto,2009-02-23 16:02:00,1499,"I went to Nippising two seasons ago. We stayed on the eastern side (I've heard that the west end is better fishing, for some reason). The lake and scenery was gorgeous. We saw very few other fishermen that were not in our group. The walleye fishing was very slow while we were there. We caught plenty of Pike, most of them seven pounds and under. Our group did manage a couple double digit pike, and a Musky that went about eighteen pounds. The best presentations were casting and trolling spinner baits. The place is relatively close compared to the other places I usually go, and the cost reflected it. I spent about half of what I usually do (for a Canadian trip). We all had a ball, and I'd go again."

1083469,Wallygetter,2009-02-24 21:18:00,312,"We took the train from Hawk Junction to the little town of Oba, a very nice train ride, seen lots of bear, moose, wolves, etc. during our ride. We stayed in Oba, population of 5 at that time. Cameron Lake was about a two hour run with 14 ft. alum. boats with 7 hp motors, we stopped and fished along the way. Cameron Lake is excellent fishing, with every ten casts you will average 7 pike and 3 walleyes, some really nice northens, and decent walleyes, we caught a fish on nearly every cast, using red-white daredevils, and rapalas. I would not hesitate to go back, great fishing."
1083656,Mikep007,2009-02-25 13:23:00,77,"All great advice here. I spent 5 years at the Pickerel / French River at Wanikewin Lodge, www.wanikewinlodge.com. Good pike, smallmouth, walleye fishing, particularly in the spring / fall. Lodge is three meals a day on American plan and it's reasonably priced around $800 US per week...ten hour trip for you in Cleveland. 15HP 14 foot lunds and worms for you too. Good luck!"
