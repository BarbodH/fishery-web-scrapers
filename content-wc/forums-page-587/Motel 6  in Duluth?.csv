1083023,Babamel2,2009-02-23 09:26:00,414,anyone ever stop to spend the night at the motel 6 in Duluth? How safe ist it? We would have a boat covered with a tarp and wondering about safety. Are there any other motels (mom & pop type) between Duluth & Virginia that some of you have used? And feel are safe places to park a rig with a boat overnight

Floor was all wet later that night beside the bed. Duluth is $$$, no deals to be had that I know of. We always stay outside of the city."

Good luck!"
1083183,elmo,2009-02-23 20:04:00,43,The AmericInn in Carlton Mn. $53.00 just south of Duluth is the place I will be staying this Aug. Cloquet is also a good place to stay. I also have spent the night in Eveleth also but I think the place has changed hands . It was just north of the hockey hall of fame. It had a nice place to eat and a large open game area with pool and some kind of golf putting area and rooms open to the inside of xtra large game room.

The only place with a room was an older motel right on 53. I mention it because it was definitely a mom and pop, and rooms emptied right onto the well lit parking lot, so it should be a safe place for a boat. There was a night manager on duty also. I left my pickup with the bed full of gear in the lot, and felt very comfortable that it would be safe. As I said, it was older, but nice and clean. The problem is, I can't remember the name of it.....I think it was the Budget Host.....maybe someone from the area can help identify it by my description."

1083440,rather-be-fishin,2009-02-24 19:13:00,429,"The ""mom & pop"" place on Hwy 53 between Eveleth and Virginia is indeed a Budget Host 218-741-6145"
