1083624,Jahloaf,2009-02-25 11:34:00,74,"I will be looking to purchase a nice cabin on a lake, which lake should I chose? I am thinking about the western Ontario area but cannot decide what lake is best. I've never been to Lac Seul but read alot on it. What about Eagle lake? I enjoy the Kenora area but Lake of the Woods is too big for my taste. My perfered prey is the walleye, but also love smack time with smalliesCan I even by a cabin if I am not a resident of Canada,,, I don't know?As you can see cabin fever has hit me hard!"
