Most of you have a head start on me regarding distance traveled - for the past 14 years I have started my annual Canadian fly-in trip with Northwest from Birmingham, England to the Twin Cities (an 11.000 mile round trip) and then a drive up to Red Lake after meeting up with my Minnesotan buddies. I consider myself very fortunate to be able to continue to do this as long as my age & health allows."

1083733,sptrix,2009-02-25 17:11:00,175,"Last year we fished in northern Manitoba (Lynn Lake area). Even with the incredibly high cost of fuel, a plane ticket for my fishing partner from Milwaukee to Minneapolis, and all the other costs associated with the trip, we were at $1400 apiece for 11 days.Like so many others have iterated, I really don't care what it costs. I'm going every year until I physically cannot do it. And if I can go more than once (like I was fortunate to do last year), I'll do that, too. I've seen far to many young people leave our world recently. Not many guys in their 30s or 40s expect not to have a lifetime of trips in front of them. When I go, I expect to have a lifetime of trips behind me, whether I go this year at age 38, or in another 70 years (****, that's still not going to be enough trips!).Steve Minneapolis"
1083089,Mike Kansas,2009-02-23 13:48:00,1463,One of the guys I go to Canada with says that his trip cost has gone up every year. He estimates that 2009 will be about $4.50 per pound of Walleye.
1083105,dutchboy,2009-02-23 14:47:00,5717,To those of you reading this thread who have NEVER been to Canada......... you can't put a price on the experience. Absolutely priceless!
1083147,Steve of Madison,2009-02-23 17:49:00,230,"Our weekly trip cost have gone up but for the most part the trip is still less than the places my wife wants (read; NEEDS) to go.The biggest cost increases since 2002 have been in Camp costs ($200) not bad, Gas per man only $50, staying the night before in Ft Francis used to be $30 US now $90, food, beer etc has all remained about the same depending on fishing crew. I now bring a flat of crawlers to offset minnows and leeches, and seem to be doing just as well.But like was stated earlier....nothing like Canada, Priceless! I will stop coming up when they pry the rod from my cold dead hand, to borrow a phrase from another great American."
1083162,Pooch,2009-02-23 18:29:00,4619,"When we started doing fly-ins in the early '90s we could go up and back from Central Illinois to Red Lake, Ontario for less than $900 easily. Including stops at a ""toy"" store here and there on the way. The same trips now run around $1500 for the same seven day trip. Factor in inflation and I suppose that isn't out of line. We no longer scrimp and gripe on these trips about cost since several of our group have died much to soon. Every year we have the discussion about our old friends gone and that they never expected to not be going on ""next years trip"". Life is fragile and nothing is a given. You don't have to go on a fly-in to have a great experience in Canada. Good drive in camps on good lakes are always full. There are so many options in Canada that there is a niche for everyone. Pooch"
1083164,Guest,2009-02-23 18:32:00,0,"We stay in international falls on the way up.....rooms can be found for under $50. Our thought was that there is a better selection of places for Drinks and Dinner,but don't know that for sure.If a restaurant or bar doesn't have a website it's unlikely that we would ever find it. Are there some good night spots in FF?"
1083175,Steve of Madison,2009-02-23 19:46:00,230,"We stay in FF just because we don't have to deal with the line in the AM. The first few years we stayed in IF, but discovered there is no line at 6pm and the motel in FF was cheaper due to the exchange rate. Now that it is for the most part, par, we still cross because of ""NO LINE"", and use the extra time to buy license, bait, and have a nice breakfast and still be at camp before noon and fishing by 12:30. While others are still in line. OH. and there are a couple of spots to enjoy a malted beverage or two."
1083271,Guest,2009-02-24 08:07:00,0,"It cost me way more than $4.50 a pound. About $2400 for the week and I eat about 10-12, 16in walleye that week. At least a couple hundred a pound."

525077,Guest,2002-10-30 10:23:00,0,"Went 400 miles northwest of Sault St. Marie, 2800 miles round trip. Did a drive in. My first time, but went with guys that go every other year. Spent about $600 each. Cabin, boat, food, motor, bait. The whole deal. Caught about 100 pike, and fished lightly. Most were slotted (27-35 inch). Caught 4- 35"" but nothing larger. Still had a great time. I will be back next year with my Grandson again. Now that I know a little more than I did, I'm looking to jack up the size and catch #'s. For $600 it was the best deal in the world! Good luck.:)"
525078,Guest,2002-10-30 10:42:00,0,"I agree with some of the other posts...all depends where you go, what you fish for, fly-in vs. not, housekeeping vs. american plan.We go to the French River area every year, about 8 hours from home in Buffalo.Fishing is good most of the time, but water temp and weather play key factors. If you rent a boat, probably costs you $400-$500 including food costs. Its never been about the fishing...gone for 26 years since my dad started me..know I have my own group...it's great to have no phones, tv, drink some beer, etc. Only problem now is Ontario has cracked down on beer in the boat!"
525079,Pooch,2002-10-31 07:16:00,4619,From central Illinois to Red Lake on fly out. One thousand bucks up and back. Includes three nights in motels going and coming. Used to drive straight thru but wasted the first few days fishing being dog tired.Pooch
525080,Guest,2002-10-31 19:24:00,0,"This was my first year going to Lac Seul. We are from the St. Cloud, MN area. It cost me $275.00. This included food, lodging, and beer. Probably spent around $50 on gear and tackle. Dad wouldn't let me pay for any of the gas, but I would guess my share would have been around $100.00. All totalled, including some souveniers, I would guess it cost $450-$500. Not bad for a week of fishing, fun and relaxation. And the fishing was awesome!!! Can't wait until next summer!!!"
1082779,Mr.Hayoka,2009-02-22 08:29:00,4,"I have to throw my 2 cents in here.Costs are as varied as much as people are.Some are cheap ..some are High Rollers...Lodges verses tents...New York strip verses Spam...good fishing for one guy...is anothers ..""is that all the bigger they get?""..You have asked a question that is nearly impossible to answer as there are so many different trips and ways to do it.My fun way is to go into places where most wouldnt go...but then I love the challenge.I tent it....I have an inflatable Zodiac rubber raft with a 4 hp Yamaha,a hot solar shower,a good water PROOF tent and I catch more fish than my boat can hold.But to the Holiday Inn man that drinks a case a beer a day and wants a big screen at nite...that would be **** for him. To each there own in life and enjoy the road that you have chosen to travel down....whether it be a mud road....or a super highway. Me I spend about $300.00 a trip, that includes camping permits,(catch my own crawlers, I like that)...fishing license,gas up and back FROM HOME!..round trip 1000 miles.But most of all have fun...."
1082804,brwhite,2009-02-22 09:22:00,41,"Wow, nice thread to dig up from 2002!I remember the trip for me was ~600-700 back then (maybe a bit earlier, now it's up to ~1600 when all is said and done.I'm curious for all of you who have been going every year for the past decade or more, where have you been seeing the cost go up? (gas is an obvious one, but what about food/lodging?)I've started keeping track of expendatures in an excel each year, here is where we stack up now, any suggestions for cutting costs?logde: 1150/pp (includes boat, gas, minnows)gas from central illinois (1500 miles round trip): 220.04/pp (this is 2008)Food: 73/ppbeer: 65/pphotel in international falls so we don't have to drive overnight: 50$/pp"
1082824,wolverine fan,2009-02-22 10:55:00,71,"geez some of you have it made, seems my trips are always 1500 or so at least. $500 for flight to winnipeg, $150 rental car and gas (3 guys), $40 gas to/from airport, $100 food/drink, $50 airport parking, $800 fishing lodge, $50 dry ice and shipping, lunches in airports etc etc etc!! You know all that wouldnt be bad except for the two months prior to the trip trying to stay out of cabelas store, catalogs and local sport shops for that ""one"" special lure!! HA"
1082856,Larry Mac,2009-02-22 13:08:00,530,"I get two weeks vacation a year and try to schedule trips 1 year in advance. Targeted species are Walleye and Pike. Because I take my boys with me I try to keep the price range under $2,000.00 for 3 people or $1,300.00 for 2 Total Cost. We prefer remote boat and portage in camps. we do not like crowds. We are extremely self sufficient given the basics. I realize this is difficult but we seem to get it done. As previously stated trips cost depending on what you want can vary as much a tackle choice.Hello Mr. Hayoka, I give you credit, we have canoed and fished the Boundary Waters and Quetico and I must say it is quite challenging. I am speculating you base camp, we traveled everyday do to the route selected by our non fishing partners. This limited our fishing time to almost none. Where do you go? Did you find your fishing Partner?Thank you,Larry Mac"
1083051,onetimedave,2009-02-23 10:50:00,502,"Our cost is approx. $1400 US for a fly in. This $$$$ includes the outfitteer charges, overnight stay, van rental for transportation, food, gasoline, etc. Trip mileage is approx. 2200 miles, rountrip from Ohio to Nakina."
1083076,Guest,2009-02-23 13:05:00,0,"I keep pretty good records of our trips ,including costs.Since 2002 gas costs,lodging costs,food costs andbait costs have all gone up of course,but what hasn't.The expensive blips on the cost radar over the years have all had to do with planning mistakes. One year the guy incharge of the grill forgot to bring it. Extra $120.....One year two guys brought the bait.Extra $100.Forget the downriggers.....$$$$.Forget the battery charger...$$$$$. A week of bad weather can also double the amount of Blue that gets consumed.All in all a week in Canada is still a super bargain."
525067,Guest,2002-10-21 12:38:00,0,"It would be interesting to hear from some of you fine fisherman how much you spend on your Canadian fishing trips. One week,from the time you leave home until you get back. Please note if your trip was a fly-in or drive in and estimate distance across Canadian border....Thanks"
525068,Guest,2002-10-21 13:23:00,0,Trip usually cost me 325-400 p/week p/person. 1700 miles round trip.
525069,Guest,2002-10-21 13:26:00,0,"We travel about 200 miles aross the border by car. We fish at a outpost camp and pay the outfitter about $500 per man for 6 of us. This includes cabin,2 boats,30 hp, 12 doz minnows,20 gal gas per boat. With food,beer,travel,lic...etc we spend about700 per man including the outfitters payment....and we catch bunchs of fish."
525070,ackermannsacre,2002-10-21 17:16:00,196,"Made my first trip last month. Went with 3 others that have been numerous times. We traveled from St. Louis to Vermilion Bay (about 150 miles above the border). Did a fly-in to a lodge with full American plan, all meals, shore lunchs, daily maid service, two brand new Lunds with 25hp Yamaha for every two fisherman (one on the main lake and one on the river system). Cost about $1300 per person total trip. Next year the wife is going also, $2600...YIKESBut, I caught 10 musky between 30-38"" in 5 hours, having never seen a live one before on one of the portage lakes. Worth every penny to me.Bill"
525071,Ivy,2002-10-22 13:14:00,556,"We travel approximately 1700 -1800 miles round trip. We usually rent a boat when we stay in a camp $500 a peice plus food and beer. We did a fly out a couple of years ago and spent almost $700 per guy. Been going to Canada for 20 years.We don't take a boat so there are pro's and con's both ways. A couple years ago My Dad (73) and I did the Fly-Out ( Wilderness -Air ) We had caught more fish on other trips. However in regards to quality time, peace of mind, cabin/operation, it was the best fishing trip I have ever had.And when it's all said and done, spending a week with your Dad fishing, telling lies, and drinking a few beers, it doesn't get any better than that.Ivy"
525072,Dave,2002-10-22 13:34:00,258,"Eye Guy:Door to door we are between $1100 to $1200 for a 7 day fly-in to an outpost 100 miles + north of Red Lake. The flights, cabin, boats, motors & gas are $700. The extra comes in the form of travel from Chicago, bait, food, beer, wine & liquor. Worth every penny!Dave"
525073,Guest,2002-10-22 13:48:00,0,Me and two of my Buddys travel from St Paul Minn to Flin Flon Manitoba every year and fish for a week. We stay with my brother who lives there and the trip costs us about $100 a piece. It wouldnt cost us that much but my cheap xxx brother makes us buy our own boat gas and our own minnows and we have to bring him Whiskey too. He tried one year to make us pay for food but we put our foot down at that. He has always been an ungrateful XXX. I wish he would get a couple of bigger boats and some better rods and reels ....Im getting tired of fishing with that old stuff. Last year his big screen was on the blink the first two days we were there and his refrigerator was out so we had to put our beer on ice. I told him he better get his act together or I wasnt going to be back.
525074,Guest,2002-10-22 15:12:00,0,"We've been driving about 200 miles Northeast of Winnipeg to a little airport to where we fly about 35 minutes north. The cost for 7 days fishing is about $1100.00 per person which includes everything. We use to go to Cranberry Portage where the cost is about half and 15 hours less driving. Like both places, bigger fish up north, better quantities down south. We average 100-150 walleye a day per boat in the 2lb and 3lb range. Up north we would average 35 a day with some occasional 8lb to 10lb caught."
525075,Behle,2002-10-23 12:38:00,51,"Eight of us travel from Ft. Wayne, IN to Rusty Meyers at Savant Lake north of Ignace. We rent a motor home for about 200 bucks each. It costs about 50-60 bucks each for gas. Food for the week is another 45 dollars. The last leg is a fly-in which runs 110 dollars each. The camp costs about 400 bucks. Bait runs us another 30 dollars. These costs are what every member needs to pay. It does not include your own personal items like beer, cigars etc. All told we get by at just under a grand."
525076,duffy,2002-10-23 16:49:00,49,"You can pay any amount you want to go to lodges in Canada. It depends what you want. You can go cheap and get dropped off on a lake with a roof and outhouse or you can go american plan lodge fully guided. depends on your priorities. Price ranges from $600 to $4500.00 per week. Warning, just like anything else you get what you pay for. Be carefull if you are looking to cut costs. Good luck"
