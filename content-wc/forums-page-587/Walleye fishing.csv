Morson is by far the least populated of the Lake of the Woods areas. No where near the traffic.www.obabikon.com is minewww.redwinglodge.netwww.buenavistaresort.comhttp://www.sportsmansresource.com/myliesplace/index.htm (Mylie's place) those three are good drive in locations."
1074882,Guest,2009-01-20 14:54:00,0,"There are lots of great lakes, who is to say this one is better than that. However, if your looking at Lac Seul, I would also consider Silver Water Wheel Lodge. Its in the center of LS and away from the more populated west and east end of the lakes. Great fishing, outstanding food and guides/boats, and wonderful cabins. Check out the web site and you can decide if its for you. I have been going there nearly 10 years now (one trip a year), and have never had a single bad experience. We will be back mid-June again this year, God willing. IA Walleye"

1084268,Robert Cardenas,2009-02-27 13:05:00,138,"You need to check out Bonny Bay Camp and Resort. I have been going there for the last 6 years and would not even consider going somewhere else. I have been going to canada for 20 years and Lake wabigoon is a walleye, northern, muskie, smallmouth bass fishery. Unbelievable fishing. The resort is first class and affordable. The resort owners will make you part of there family while your up there, if you need anything they are there for you. The rental boats are very nice also, we don't even pull our boats up. Check out there website, great pics of fish and resort."
1074505,Shmoo,2009-01-18 17:51:00,4,Would like to plan my first Walleye fishing trip to Canada. Would like some suggestions please. Looking for a nice place to stay with great fishing. Drive-in facilities would be better.
1074508,GNO,2009-01-18 18:01:00,153,"Check out Rainy Lake, it has an excellent walleye fishery and is going to be the next premier walleye destination in Ontario. Just google Rainy Lake and you will have lots of options for places to stay."
1074509,Shmoo,2009-01-18 18:04:00,4,Thanks GNO! I will.
1074514,rather-be-fishin,2009-01-18 18:28:00,429,"For GREAT Walleye fishing that won't dissapoint you, you can't beat Lac Seul Lake, Ontario. Below is a list of some great resorts near Ear Falls, Ontario 1. Fisherman's Cove www.fishermanscoverontario.com 2. Onaway Lodge www.onawaylodge.com 3. Lac Seul Lodge www.duenorth.net 4. Evergreen Resort www.lacseulwalleye.com Where will you be traveling from? This area is about 3 1/2 hours north of International Falls, MN....long drive, but a scenic drive and worth the extra miles! Rather-be-fishing!!!"
1074527,katrinnka,2009-01-18 18:59:00,1,"We've been fishing Lac Seul for more than 20 years now - both spring and summer fishing. All our summer adventures are tent camping and we had spent those at Fisherman's Cove. We always had a fabulous time. Two years ago Keith & Dan decided not to allow tent camping any longer - only RV camping for full summers. We were told this as we were settling our account at the end of our week. Needless to say, this was a huge disappointment and to do this to loyal customers seemed very rude. We have not been back to FC or Lac Seul since. We've spent our time on Lake of the Woods and Rainy the last 2 years. If anyone knows a good place that allows tenters on Lac Seul, I would be interested. We were treated badly and in this economy that's a mistake I would hope they have regretted."
1074536,v-bay gord,2009-01-18 19:41:00,3168,"Katrinka......N.W. Ontario and Lac Suel are spectacular destinations. Perhaps they shouldn't just be ""given away"" for the price of setting up your tent. I can see it as being a business decision....nothing rude about it....and you were given fair notice of the change. Perhaps check into the location of the nearest provincial park. The Provincial government who operates these does not have to worry about making a profit to keep them open."

1074542,GNO,2009-01-18 20:15:00,153,Country Camping & Cabins may be of interest if you want to fish Lac Seul and camp. They are only a few minutes away from the launch in Hudson and are located on Big Vermillon. Very reasonable rates and minutes from Lac Seul. Rainy is still at the top my walleye fishing list.
1074761,Guest,2009-01-20 05:51:00,0,"Katrinnka, Whitewing Resort has nice tenting facilities available. They are located about 5 miles south of Ear Falls. You can check it out at www.whitewingresort.com. WP - Sioux Falls"
