1085001,scotttheguide,2009-03-02 17:14:00,73,"Want to test your Trophy Walleye skill? Fish Whitefish Bay, LOTW from the second week in September on into October. Big Walleyes and you have to fish for them. Crystal clear water with depth's over 200'. This is not a 100 fish a day bite but if you are looking for 30-35"" Walleyes that are fat, it's awesome.The Lake will test your boat control skills and the fish will test your knowledge and techniques.Want more information check out our classified ad on Walleye Central under Guides & Lodges : Drop down list - Canada - Ontario Resorts"
1083753,scotttheguide,2009-02-25 18:08:00,73,"Thats tough if you don't fish them very often but they are catchable. In the middle of Summer go out in the evening to increase your odds. You can catch them using Zip lures or Sonars. You look for deep water on the map (100 ft Minimum). Once you find that area look for reefs or points that come up to 35 to 50 foot. Locate that reef on your graph and move around it trying to find clouds of bait fish suspended just off the reef. Lakers will be under them. Drop your sonars down and reel them right back up. It's a vertical presentation. Drop it down, reel it up. Keep moving around to find pods of bait fish. If you want to straight troll them set your rod up with 3 way rigg and a 3/4 to 1 oz weight with about a 4 foot mono leader. Tie on a White or White/Chart medium size minnow profile deep diving bait and troll those same areas. Troll fast enough to feel the bait flash. You should be able to put a couple in the boat during your trip. They are awesome smoked. Your making me hungry."
1083781,maverick,2009-02-25 19:52:00,24,"I fish LOW monthly in the spring, summer and fall. I own a trailer at Buena Vista Resort outside of Morson. I will be up in May and am always looking for additional information on quality fishing spots, etc....any help would be appreciated. I have fished spot from from Miles Bay to Hay Island, etc...any further info?"
1083790,Golden Eagle,2009-02-25 20:14:00,2642,I suggest asking Scott for fishing patterns and methods rather than hot spots. Hot spots have a way of fading.
1083830,scotttheguide,2009-02-25 23:46:00,73,"Maverick,Sorry can't really help you out with areas in Sabaskong Bay because I don't fish it any more. We used to go into Obabikon years ago before they dammed up Turtle Portage.You could try that, taking the Rail over Portage into Southern Whitefish Bay if it works. Crystal clear Deep water.Turtle Lake is just North of Hay Island, you just go into Turtle Lake and cut across it and go into the Channel and pull up on the rail cart and wheel your boat to the other side. You should check it out even if you don't cross over it's pretty cool."
1083975,maverick,2009-02-26 14:34:00,24,"G.E., Thanks for the tip...but that is what I was really asking...I don't really need waypoints... Scott...I have been up to the portage site...it is pretty cool. Do you know if there are any worries about putting a 21 foot Ranger on it? Not sure if it has a weight/size limit. Thanks"
1083976,Obabikon,2009-02-26 14:35:00,2370,I've pulled 18ft lunds and a 21ft nitro bass boat over... it's HARD work... but fun.
1084021,scotttheguide,2009-02-26 16:34:00,73,"There you go Mav. Obabikon would know that better than me. Thats his neck of the Woods. I have never crossed it but I have seen boats coming over it before.Just make sure if you do cross over that you use more natural color baits like perch, pumpkin seed, black and silver colors. The water is real clear.I may come down there and fish Muskies this year but I am going the other way through FP Narrows.Maverick, when I first read your post I thought you were kidding when you said you fish Miles to Hay Island. I thought you were talking about big Hay Island near Kenora and I was like jeez theres a thousand of spots to between there. Thats like a 60 mile ride, or more via the Track."
1084215,scotttheguide,2009-02-27 10:17:00,73,Any one else coming up? I'm bored and if I am not typing then the wife is going to find something for me to do!Send me a PM if you want more information on LOTW.
1084421,MN_Moose,2009-02-28 07:07:00,965,Hey Scott How about some spots to throw for some Northern Pike? From S.N. north to Kenora. Mostly north of the barrier islands. We get a few here and there pitching jigs but would like to get into some nice ones. This would be first / middle part of June. Thanks MM
1084453,MN_Moose,2009-02-28 10:44:00,965,Thanks Scot Have you ever been in the bowling alley? I've heard it is so full of big boulders it's hard to get in to. Are the rocks that treacherous that no one goes in there?
1083646,King Canada,2009-02-25 12:46:00,27,"Borderline behavior , Sir."
1083649,bassface44,2009-02-25 12:51:00,96,"Scotttheguide, I am going to be on LOTW in early to mid July. We will be south south east of Kenora mostly. Any preliminary thoughts about a trip at this time? We fish mostly walleye but some are lookin' to try for other species and see if they can't get a couple big 'uns too."
1083653,MN_Moose,2009-02-25 12:57:00,965,"Back to the topic at hand. Let's talk fishing. In the Northeast end, what are typical spawning grounds. I know some of the river flowing in creates current, but without in flow what areas are spawning areas? How far will fish travel for spawning grounds?"
1083659,scotttheguide,2009-02-25 13:43:00,73,"Teddi, We switched shows here at the last minute so we won't be at the Madison expo, we already did the AC Show in Madison earlier this year so we are doing a smaller show in Deerfield, IL."
1083669,joeman79,2009-02-25 14:04:00,417,Aint nothin borderline about it. I was serious and those were things I was told. And If I ever do want to pursue a career in Canada I want to know how to do it. I was not being an A$$. Or that was not my intentions at all. Sir
1083688,King Canada,2009-02-25 15:08:00,27,Never mind
1083692,teddi,2009-02-25 15:21:00,349,we all know his name so that is not abig deal. if he is not breaking the law he has nothing to worry about. as long as his paperwork is in order and his canadian taxes are paid it is fine.
1083699,joeman79,2009-02-25 15:40:00,417,Thanks Scott I will do that. Appreciate it.
1083705,Obabikon,2009-02-25 15:53:00,2370,"Scott... do you participate in the KBI? I'm guessing you're in the Kenora area, so figured you would. You're right, it's a beautiful lake... if you're down around Morson some time, feel free to swing in and say hello."
1083729,Wall-i-Lama,2009-02-25 16:53:00,1524,"Scott, My family has fished LOTW for a few years. We have had good success with walleye and northern and also caught small mouth, crappie, perch and 1 muskie (accidently). We have tried to catch lake trout to fill out the field, but simply can't land one. We fish there in the middle or last two weeks of July, which is probably the problem, but do see other catch a couple of lakers at this time. Can you provide any advice on a general area and technique for lake trout. My smoker is beggin me to throw one in it.Thanks."
1083384,scotttheguide,2009-02-24 16:27:00,73,I am a guide on LOTW and looking forward to another awesome season.The Outdoor Shows are winding down and Cabin Fever is starting to set in so lets talk fishing.
1083445,bassface44,2009-02-24 19:27:00,96,When is the small mouth spawn on LOTW? Specifically south of Kenora. Is there a water temp to look for?
1083451,Guest,2009-02-24 20:11:00,0,"ok so where or what part of that huge lake would you go to catch smallies, northerns or musky?? Never been there but look often at the websites, lodges, blogs etc. Not asking for lodges but areas that are good to fish and my teenagers would have fun catching some fish, dont have to be world records just fun.... and safe, ive read it can be big water."
1083468,v-bay gord,2009-02-24 21:12:00,3168,How do you handle the issue of working in a different country?
1083489,scotttheguide,2009-02-24 22:44:00,73,"Guest, Lake of the Woods is a huge body of water. 14,000 Islands and 60,000 miles of shore line. Pike and Bass are relatively easy to catch. Walleyes are more structure related so depending on when you are looking to take the kids fishing they could be a little tougher. Musky season opens the third Saturday in June. LOTW is one of the best Musky Lakes in North America and alot of them are caught by people Bass Fishing in June and July. PM me and I will give you more information."
1083530,v-bay gord,2009-02-25 07:04:00,3168,That's good you were able to obtain the proper permits. Generally they only allow non residents work permits if they are filling jobs that cannot be filled by Canadians. Must be a shortage of unemployed people that could guide around Lake of the Woods.
1083540,joeman79,2009-02-25 07:41:00,417,"Four years ago when I was looking for a change in career, some friends and I were going to purchase a lodge in Manitoba. We did not end up doing it. BUt after that I checked with several different Lodges including lodges on LOTW, none of the owners including the American owners said it was possible for them to hire an american citizen. Just wondering how and what permits you needed to get? I also did inquire with the Government when we were discussing Permits on different lakes and asking questions about hiring help to guide at different lakes and they gave me same answers when I asked them, and that was that we could only hire Canadian citizens to work. I guess I will do more research and see if they changed the laws. What is your name so I can use you as an example?"
1083559,Golden Eagle,2009-02-25 08:24:00,2642,"You got it right. Plenty of unemployed people who could guide, but very few who will show up every day. Many won't stay sober more than 2 or 3 days at a time. Many guides are inexperienced and merely follow another boat from a mile or so away and stay in touch by radio. Unfortunately I've experienced what I'm referring to when visiting a major camp on LOTW. I had a party of 38. We had 3 excellent guides, Four or five pretty good guides and the rest were inferior. The best showed up every day, but the others could only put together a 2 or 3 day streak.I can see why campowners would do whatever necessary to bring competent guides to their camps."
1083573,teddi,2009-02-25 09:13:00,349,"the laws have not been changed. a lot of camp owners have friends or friends kids who need jobs for the summer so they work at camps in canada under the table. this will hopefully change this year due to the economic conditions in canada. a lot of camp owners trade trips for work at their camps to fellow residents. this is against the law and they can be deported for doing it. not all canadian,s are drunks and do show up for work every day."
1083637,teddi,2009-02-25 12:21:00,349,maybe i will see you in madison this weekend at the show. i will make a point of dropping in at molongs booth.
