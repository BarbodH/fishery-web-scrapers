1083968,reelxtc,2009-02-26 14:17:00,173,"Hi, I went to the KC Sport Show and it was less than half the size of previous years. Only one fishing boat dealer, Cabela's."
1083977,Obabikon,2009-02-26 14:37:00,2370,"I of course go to lots of shows... seems that traffic is better this year than last. However, KC and Chicagoland (the one at Rosemont)... which were two of the biggest in the midwest for years, have fallen off dramatically. The Omaha show and Minneapolis show are still very good and well attended."
1083991,teddi,2009-02-26 15:03:00,349,i was at rosemont and it was very poorly run and attended. we are at omaha now and am hoping it will be better. sioux falls and mpls next
1083995,Juls,2009-02-26 15:12:00,13414,"We spent three days at the Indianapolis Boat, Sport, & Travel Show. It was packed! It was elbow to elbow Fri., Sat., and Sunday. There were a lot of tackle vendors, boat dealers, RV's, seminars, etc....oh yeah...and the Dock Dogs! They were cool. Renfro Productions know how to keep people coming in. The parking was only 3 dollars compared to 11.00 for the show at Rosemont and other places.However, the food and drink prices were rediculously high. I don't understand that at all. They could sell twice as much for a little cheaper price or keep the prices sky high and sell less. That just doesn't make sense to me. But, overall the show was fun!Juls"
1083999,teddi,2009-02-26 15:27:00,349,we will have to look at that show for next year. it is hard to pick which ones to do to get the most for your dollar.
1084228,JDP,2009-02-27 11:09:00,1457,"What resort, lodge or business do you exhibit at the shows? I will be going to the Northwest Sportshow (Mpls) and would like to chat with you regarding the Ear Falls area. I haven't been able to get to that side of Lac Seul for a few years and would like to catch up on the latest developments. Thanks. JDP"
1084286,teddi,2009-02-27 13:45:00,349,go to the ontario government booth and ask for jerry. he is going to be there. i am going to be in sioux falls at that time doing the show there. jerry represents sunset country up here. he can put you in touch with me.
1084292,JDP,2009-02-27 14:24:00,1457,Thanks...will do!!!
1084312,lcwhit,2009-02-27 15:14:00,104,that indy show is a good one. very well attended. not a lot of ontario guys there. probably would be a good one. always packed on the weekend. easy in and out. reasonable.
