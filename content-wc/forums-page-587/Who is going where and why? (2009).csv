1084281,Robert Cardenas,2009-02-27 13:30:00,138,"You have to check out Bonny Bay Camp and Resort. I use to go to Gull Rock, but chose a resort that was much more resonably priced and did not have to travel as far (gas). I have found the fishing to be just as good as Gull Rock, the problem with Gull Rock is the walleye fishing is good but the Pike and musky and smallies, and perch is not comparabile to Wabigoon. You will catch more fish at Wabigoon. And you need to check out this resort, they are a class act, check out the website www.bonnybay.comRobertfrom the Twin Cities"
1073067,1shooter,2009-01-11 11:04:00,1493,We always talk about trying another lake but I guess we are creatures of habit and will be returning to LOTW. We go in the spring and stay at Grassy Narrows out of Morson. Also this year we did a fall trip to the area and plan to do it again.
1073237,labsrus,2009-01-12 10:24:00,557,Our group goes to the same lake in Ontario each summer. My buddy liked the lake so much that last year he bought a cabin on the lake. We plan on going in August for a week of great fishing. In July we are going on a fly-in trip with Air Ivahhoe to Rush Lake. This will be our third trip with them. Second time to Rush. We went to Bromley in 2004 We cannot wait to go. Always catch a lot of fish and it is a great chance to get out side with my son.
1073258,Backwater Eddy,2009-01-12 12:03:00,3871,"Since this 08 season runs to late March in Manitoba, I'll be back up on Lake Winnipeg for sure in March.Last season the ice fishing was phenomenal, both for size and numbers of walleye. This season has proved to be amazing and should get even better as the days again grow longer.Back up to the Red River, and out to the Lake is my plan."
1073268,cowboyd,2009-01-12 13:48:00,33,Our group has done fall Wabakimi trips for a number of years and used all three outfitters. Obviously the fishing is terrible so go try another place! Spring trip looks like the Air-Dale group but I would really like to find someone who may have used them before esp if they fished Apisabigo in May.Dick

1075334,smallfry,2009-01-22 14:12:00,9,"Spruce Island Camp in the fall on Lake of The Woods, can't imagine going anywhere else, love the place and the fishing. Can't wait!"
1075617,Guest,2009-01-23 18:56:00,0,Our group will be fishing Kakagi(Crow)Lake/LOTW the first two weeks of September.Still after that Monster Musky-maybe this will be the year.
1075869,Dan G,2009-01-25 07:26:00,31,"Dear Larry,My wife and I go to Red Indian Lodge on Lake of the Woods. It is a great father/son location as well as a good place to take a group. They have a number of private/clean cabins that can house from 2 to 8 people. So, just about any size of group works. We choose to go guided, since our time is limited and we prefer to get ""on"" the fish quickly. Their guides are going out everyday...so they know where to fish! My wife once caught the nicest back to back walleyes I have ever seen. The first was almost 11.5 lbs. and the second was 7.5 lbs. My eyes almost popped out of my head, and her comment was, ""They're not lunchers!"" (Only a woman!!) Anyway, we certainly don't think you can go wrong with this place. Easy to get to, wonderful accommodations, and GREAT fishing. Best wishes to you in finding a place to go."
1075979,eyeman_1,2009-01-25 15:08:00,690,"This will be our 5th trip back to Wiley Point on LOTW. The cabins are great - AC/heat, full bathroom all the hot water you could want, hot tub on the deck for after a long day musky fishing, great food, great location and you can catch eyes and smallies all day, pike can be good in deeper water and the ski's are awesome. A day trip to Shoal lake for big pike or smallies is always a ball. Went the first time on our honeymoon and the next year with 16 friends. This year taking my dad back for his second trip. Great food, great accomodations, great locations and quality service. Worth every penny IMHO."
1072601,Moondog,2009-01-08 22:34:00,362,Where do you rent a houseboat on Lac Seul? We did that on LOTW when our son was in High school and we had a blast.
1072644,JDP,2009-01-09 09:24:00,1457,Here are two houseboat operations on Lac Seul that I know of:http://www.whitewingresort.com/index2.htmlhttp://www.lacseulfloatinglodges.com/ JDP
1072679,gowrlop,2009-01-09 12:01:00,109,brwhiteIt takes us about 8 hours if we can use the shortcuts. The drive up there is a great trip. Nothing better than sitting on top of the house boat taking in all that beauty and enjoing a cold Bud light. We like to deadhead it up to Wapesi Bay and stay there for 3 days then midweek move back 1/2 way around Taylor Island and spend the last couple days there. Up in Wapesi we catch a lot of walleye with most 19 inches and under but a few a day over 20. The biggest in our group has been 26 inches in the last few years but numbers of 19 inchers are pretty good. As far as other peole ya we see some but nothing like when I used to go to Mawkwa Lodge in the center of the lake. We do catch larger fish on average around Taylors Island but the numbers aren't as good. In Wapesi the pike fishing is pretty good also and I have talked to guys that make day trips up there hunting Muskies.
1072702,joeman79,2009-01-09 13:22:00,417,What's it cost to rent a Houseboat for a week? (Ballpark Figure) That sounds like fun.
1072706,JAY221,2009-01-09 13:44:00,877,"According to the Whitewing Resort listed aboves website it is 4100.00 per week + gas you use. Ouch!! Later, Jay"
1072761,Guest,2009-01-09 18:48:00,0,"I have done the houseboat deal on Lac Seul many times, it is absolutely fabulous. We used Lac Seul Floating lodges and go up just north of Chamberlain Narrows, about 8 hrs. We rented the 75 footer that sleeps 10 and tow our rigs behind. Spit up 10 ways it is really no more expensive than a resort per night. The solitude is great and unbelievable fishing is literally minutes away in your own rig. Actually, depending on the time of year, you catch all the walleye you want right off the back of the houseboat when it's parked ! Cannot beat this experience. Highly recommend this whether it's Lake of the Woods, Lac Seul or Rainy Lake."
1072894,Moondog,2009-01-10 14:06:00,362,Looked at both houseboat website but for some reason Lac Seul Floating Lodges is not publishing their rates. Hmmm. Does anyone know of any others??? It is a great way to fish a large lake and really see the beauty.
1072913,IMWalleye,2009-01-10 16:45:00,35,"I have fished the NE section of Lac Seul every year since 1982. I did the houseboats a couple of times, then I discovered Lac Seul Outposts camp (boat in) at Chamberlain Narrows. I much prefer the camp over the houseboats. Too many things can and do go wrong with the houseboats, and for one thing you lose a lot of valuable fishing time with the long trip up and back. Also, if you get a heavy west wind on the day you are supposed to return - not likely you will safely make the trip to Hudson. Lac Suel Outposts sits within a maximum 45 minute camp boat trip to anywhere you want to go to catch walleye , northern, musky and smallmouth. Or you can travel less than 5 minutes, stay in the Narrows and probably do just as well. One day I watched a couple have a 100+ walleye day off the dock. It is an excellent operation in every aspect. I'll be back there the 1st week of June, just like I always am. You can get the details at : http://www.lacseuloutposts.com/"
1072926,stevensinks,2009-01-10 18:09:00,330,My wife and I are going to Bow Narrows on Red Lake the last week of July. I went there last year with a group of guys and we got into som really nice walleye. I wanted to take my wife this year on the american plan so she can really have a vacation to.
1073039,woods,2009-01-11 09:51:00,646,"Our group of nine is going back to Minaki for the 24th year in a row. The fishing there has had it's ups and downs, and last year was one of the best. One day last year was the best day of walleye fishing I ever had! 30 walleyes in the 24 - 30"" range, with another 20 nice ones in my boat."
1070906,Golden Eagle,2008-12-31 15:14:00,2642,"Flat Lake holds muskies. South of Red Lake, just past Madsen. On your right as you go south. Might be tough launching boat with motor over 40 HP. I could be wrong on that."
1070920,AllenW,2008-12-31 16:00:00,11482,"Flat was the one I was thinking of, you go though a small creek to get to Russett.Ya the 16' Fisher with a 75hp was a tough launch, the 18' with a 150 isn't gonna make it if the launch hasn't been improved.ThanksCaught one musky in Red in all the years we fished there, o-well we can always go after big northerns.I guess considering Muskies aren't suppose to be in Red we did ok though..Al"
1070967,Golden Eagle,2008-12-31 21:45:00,2642,"Several years ago Babe Winkleman did a shoot on Flat Lake. He had decent success, but wish he wouldn't be so far off with his estimates of fish size."
1071047,AllenW,2009-01-01 14:11:00,11482,"I suppose he was talking 50"" plus knowing how it usually goes.We found a lot of ones in the 40's and down, nothing anybody who fishes muskies would call giant, we just hit a lot of them, mostly in the back lake or the little bay between the launch and the creek to get to russetAlso nice walleyes too in the under 5# rangeAl"
1071240,luv2fishcanada,2009-01-02 17:38:00,41,"In my opinion, you can't beat Gullrock. I started going to Gullrock in 1981 at 14 years of age with my father. Have been going to the same place year after year, started out as Stevens, then Horners, and now Goldenhook. Ontario has their act together when it comes to managing their resorces. Gullrock has the best of both worlds, quanity and quality. I have always gone the first week of June. Thirteen walleyes over 25"" last year in our group of 4. My two cents worth."
1071324,elmo,2009-01-03 09:13:00,43,"My wife and I are going back to Kashabowie Outpost. Reason, we love to fish and just get away from home, they treat us great and have good outpost with good lakes to fish."
1071783,Pooch,2009-01-05 17:21:00,4619,"Skipping Birch Lake (north of Red Lake, Ontario) this year. Haven't missed at least one week on that body of water for close to fifteen years and already missing it a bunch! Birch is a really nice lake to fish and there are fish everywhere in that puppy. Gives you a real feel for what Canadian fishing is all about. We are skipping Birch because it adds an extra day on the road for us and instead making two trips to Savant and depending on the season maybe a quick trip to Lac Seul. Pooch"
1071798,jhoeke,2009-01-05 18:51:00,23,For the money and the quality of fish. Hands down I would say The Red River or Winnipeg River in October. I have been several times and keep going back for a chance at a true trophy every day. I will be going from Oct 11 thru Oct 17th this year with college buddies and work friends. Simply unbelievable.
1071955,gowrlop,2009-01-06 15:35:00,109,We are once again taking a Houseboat out of Hudson and dead heading to Wapesi Bay on Lac Seul in July. Thats about as peacful as it gets and the fishing is pretty good also.
1072569,brwhite,2009-01-08 20:15:00,41,"Wow, thats all the way up there. My group has toyed with the idea of getting a house boat and doing something different. How long does it take to get up there? Ever see any other people out there? What size fish do you typically catch?"
1069674,prov1900,2008-12-22 09:34:00,544,"Donnelly's Minnitaki Resort at the end of May. This will be our third year in a row, and I am now dying to get there. Can't wait. My biggest northern and biggest laker came from there. I assume my biggest walleye will come from that lake as well. Everyone that goes in my group has caught their biggest fish, be it walleye, northern, or lake trout. One of these days I will get back to Lac Seul. Love that place too!!"

1070703,bassface44,2008-12-30 08:35:00,96,After 7 years going on a fly-in to Quebec with Berthelot Lake Lodge we are switching things up this year and heading to Lake of the Woods for a houseboat trip out of Kenora. We don't really know what to expect with the fishing but our group has been together for ten years now and we have a good time regardless. It will be fun just learning new water. Throw in a couple extra species and it should be a blast.
1070882,AllenW,2008-12-31 13:02:00,11482,"After close to 35 years of hitting red lake in Sept, last two years we missed, the crowd that went has dwindled to just me, some died off, some can't afford it and some just don't go anymore.This year I may have a younger friend that wants to go, and if all goes well, sept will find us at Red again....looking forward to it.Not sure where we'll stay, but we'll figure that out once the trip becomes for sure.Picked up a new boat and can't wait to get it up there..Have fun and be careful on the water, maybe see ya up there.Al"
1070886,Golden Eagle,2008-12-31 13:33:00,2642,"Allen, I hope you make it up there in 2009. Maybe stay twice as long to make up for lost fishing time. I'm heading to Red Lake for a flight to Little Vermilion on May 15 and will stay 15 days. August and October are looking good to me as well."
1070891,AllenW,2008-12-31 13:57:00,11482,"Hoping for 8-10 days but prob be 7, either way I'm sure it'll be fun.You (or anybody) don't know if the launch to get into Russett (I think its Russett just outside of Red) is still a bit poor?There's two musky lakes connected there we used to fish, the 16 foot boat got in easy enough, not sure about the 18' alumacraft I have now though.Al"

Each year we try a different lake to keep things new and exciting for us. I guess we keep going back cause they treat us well, have great a outpost camps and we know what we are getting. You were asking about accomodations in Nakina and there is some but I would suggest booking them early to make sure you have some."
1068912,Glenman12,2008-12-17 06:56:00,762,not sure what week in June you are going to Cedar Lake but we will be on the island June 13th. Same group as in the past..this will be my 25th year going there
1068922,Northtwin,2008-12-17 07:35:00,175,We will be fishing Minnitaki in Sioux Lookout. The walleye fishing keeps getting better. We will be there in June when the sanctuaries open and in August or Sept. when the fish are out on the humps. It is a boat in camp however someday I would like to experience a fly-in.
1068938,Mike Kansas,2008-12-17 08:30:00,1463,"Going back to Lac Seul just like the last 20 years. Staying at Black Bay Outpost out of Lac Seul Lodge the second week of June and going to Lost Island Lodge the last week of June. We have made some great friends at both Lodges and the fishing at both is very rewarding. My first trip is with a group of guys that have been together for a long time and it is the highlight of the year to spend time together. The trip to Lost Island Lodge is a couples trip with 3 to 4 couples every year. The wives love it and the fishing is fast enough to keep their interest up. My wife had two days last year that she caught over 70 Walleye and it is the first thing she talks about around friends. She also has a 31 1/2"" Walleye Replica hanging in our living room. Mike Kansas"
1069027,Fishin Fun,2008-12-17 17:45:00,218,"I stayed at Donnelly's resort many, many years ago and fished Minnitaki. I don't remember a lot about the fishing. I remember all the oil running out of the lower unit of the boat and it freezing up and being stranded on an island. Also remember the driver falling asleep and all of us going in the ditch on the way home. What a trip! I do remember fishing off of the resort dock while our boat was getting fixed and catching nice walleyes and some really nice northern. Have a great time fishing there this year. Thanks for mentioning the lake and bringing back some memories."
1069113,mike0212,2008-12-18 08:08:00,5,were heading back to Pym Island with Hearst Air. Last year we had Lots of big Pike and alot of big eyes. M
1069238,Tonyo,2008-12-19 06:26:00,212,"Just another vote for Gullrock Lake. We have been going for the past 10 or so years. The fishing was good 10 years ago but I would say that it has gotten better as time goes on. They have put great conservation limitations on the size and qty's of eyes taken from this great lake making the fishing outstanding over the past few years. Size is of eyes is better and the numbers of bigger fish are much better. I don't think you will be disappointed with any of the camps on the lake. Each one seems to have its advantages and they all seem to be very well run... We will be staying at Five Lakes Lodge the last few days of May and first few days of June. My opinion is, pick any spot in the Sunset Country and have a wonderful experience that will last a lifetime. Tonyo"
1069254,Roddy,2008-12-19 08:44:00,488,"Our group does a fly-in trip every other year which we started in 1994. We usually book 12-18 months in advance. We have used 5-6 outfitters. For the most part, the service was good. Sometimes the fishing was spotty. The past 3 trips we used Knobbys. The service was excellent and the fishing was pretty good. No big fish, but usually we would have 100+ fish days on the good days and 20-30 fish per boat on the slow days. This year we will be trying Mattice Lake Outfitters. We decided to try another outfitter in hopes of catching bigger fish. We found we were getting excited about 22"" walleyes, with the average size being 16-17"". After talking to a few WC members we settled on MLO. It will be tough to beat the service we received from Knobby's but from conversations I have had with MLO customers, it looks like we can expect 20-22"" fish to be the norm rather than the exception."

The lodge is owned by long time owners and is now up for sale since they want to retire. Any information about Moose territory lodge is appreciated, we will be booking soon."
1068504,Larry Mac,2008-12-14 15:06:00,530,"As a guy who is passionate about Canadian Wilderness fishing I often struggle on where to go. Do we repeat or try a new experience? Ontario or Manitoba? Fly-in or Boat in? Economy or Extravagant? I do realize the questions one must ask himself to determine their initial Canadian experience, but what does one do that has been on the adventure before. We are all blessed with so many options that sometimes it is overwhelming. This year (2009) we are going in June to Cedar Lake Ontario (New-Drive to), in August to Sioux Lookout Ontario (Repeat-Boat/Portage in). As a working guy with (2) weeks vacation a year, this time is very precious. We all have only so many trips left and we want to make them as fulfilling as possible. I have followed this forum and read many of its threads. There are many years of Canadian experience within this members list. Please share why and where you are going and how did you decided.Thank you,Larry Mac"

We used to go multiple times a year until my dad passed about 6 years ago. I have not been back since. I've spoken via email to Mary at South Bay numerous times this past summer and fall. Sounds like the fishing has been very good this past year. As always. So, needless to say, I'm very excited to go back there this summer and get back into the swing of things again. I have 2 boys ages 5 & 9 that I eventually would like to take up there. People think that Canada is like northern Minnesota. Ahhhh.....No. I have some clients that spend time at the English River and have a wonderful time. I've never done a fly-in trip, but I would like to do that some day too. I've never fished any where in Canada other than Ontario. There's no reason for me to try anything else. The fishing is always good and the scenery is to die for."
1068546,pike50plus,2008-12-14 18:39:00,584,Do you still want 2 weeks and what price range and species are you interested in?
1068557,Larry Mac,2008-12-14 19:48:00,530,"Fishing Fun, thank you for the reply. I am excited for you entering back into the Canadian Adventures. We have never been to Gull Rock Lake have read a lot about it. I noticed your trip date is in July. So many people do not realize that you can catch fish all season long in the North, just have to adjust. As a Father of (3) boys myself I can Identify in your excitement in wanting to share the Canadian experience with your boys. Your Father sounded like a great man and obviously instilled the yearning for the Canadian Wilderness in you. My youngest is now 13 and has been to Canada 9 times. In June we are going to Cedar Lake Camp on Cedar Lake. We have never fished this Lake before. We are taking a group of Family Ranging In age from 13 to 79 including 2 of my sons. In August we are going to Ghost River Camp in Sioux Lookout. This will be mostly Father and Sons. When fishing with kids we always look for action to keep them busy usually Walleye. As they get a little older they like to keep busy casting for pike. Please tell me about your experiences on Gull Rock. Do you do housekeeping pkgs, do you use a lodge boat or bring your own. You are so right about North of the border you have to experience it to appreciate it.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1068564,Larry Mac,2008-12-14 20:25:00,530,"Pike50Plus, thank you for the reply, I get two weeks vacation a year and try to schedule trips 1 year in advance. Targeted species are Walleye and Pike. Because I take my boys with me I try to keep the price range under $2,000.00 for 3 people or $1,300.00 for 2 Total. I realize this is difficult but we seem to get it done. When the kids were young I was able to go to Northern Manitoba to Grass River Lodge in Flin Flon Manitoba and flew out to Moody Lake. It was a great experience Large Pike and all the walleye you wanted. Barbless hooks and no live bait (didn't need it). It was amazing to wake up early in the morning and see Caribou swimming across the lake. It is fantastic to have a lake all to yourself. You really get the feel of true wilderness.Thank you,Larry Mac"

Our Father and Son August trip is also with clients and their sons. Spending 24 hours a day for seven days with clients builds amazing friendships. Our industry is close knit and many other clients who have heard about the trips and seen the pictures the other clients have taken, want to experience this Canadian Adventure. When putting trips like that together the more knowledge you have about where you are going the better. Thank you,Larry"
1068724,Fishin Fun,2008-12-15 20:06:00,218,"As I was growing up, my dad would take me on a lot of his fishing trips and the experiences, both good and bad, are things I will remember for a lifetime. We've been to so many different lakes in Ontario that I can't remember them all. Then a friend of my dad's recommended for us to try Gull Rock. For years we would stay in the cabins at Honer's Gull Rock Bay Camp. Now it is called Golden Hook. We switched to South Bay and fell in love with the camp and Harry and Mary. We've stayed in the cabins and brought up a camper and left it there all season. Harry and Mary were so accomodating and would let us keep the camper there all winter too. Fishing was always good. Days better than others of course. This lake was my dad's home away from home. It takes 12 hours for us to get there and it has always been worth it. I started bringing my father-in-law up there with me. He has been there 3 times with me and can't say enough good things about it. It isn't just the fishing. The fishing is just part of the whole experience. Although when the fishing is good, the experience is better. So yes, I'm very excited to go back. I've already purchased a new depth finder for my boat and a hand held gps. Kind of silly I guess because past experience should tell me where the fish are. Shouldn't need all the gizmos to tell me that. But I guess as long as I'm going for the 1st time without my dad, I want to be prepared."

Gull Rock and its chain of lakes looks pretty amazing. The whole Red Lake area looks amazing. 9 miles long , 16,000 acres that is a nice size lake. Fishin Fun you are right we heard it said many times that catching fish is just a bonus when it comes to the North experience. Glad to see you are sharing the experience with your Father-in-Law. In my case the experience begins at the time of trying to decide where to go, who to go with, what type of trip to take. I do find myself returning to the camp that started it all at least once a year. I have researched the Red Lake area for many years and hope to eventually visit it. Red Lake arguably one of the places that might be most famous when it comes to Canadian Fishing.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1068813,onetimedave,2008-12-16 12:03:00,502,Six of us are flying into Kayedon Lake out of Nakina with Arctic Watershed Outposts. We have used this outfitter 12 times with great success and have been to Kayedon once before. First trip was very good but we believe we did see the best of this lake. Therefor we are trying it the first week of June 2009.
1068881,Larry Mac,2008-12-16 19:03:00,530,"Hi Onetimedave, Thank you for the reply. We have really looked hard at this particular outfitter and have been very interested. You have been there 12 times so you must be very satisfied with the whole package. Which lakes have you been to and which ones impressed you most? Have you been to Hebner (their new outpost)? The whole area looks nice and remote. Are there overnight accommodations in the area? So many places, so little time. How does one choose?Thank you,Larry Mac"
