1084029,Golden Eagle,2009-02-26 17:03:00,2642,"Walleye opener last year in NW Ontario my guys were bringing them in on a bare jig - no plastic - no rubber - no stink, just a bare hook. Told them to bring powergrubs this May 16 and have a piece of crawler or salted minnow in case we need walleyes after a severe cold front."
1084053,Larry Mac,2009-02-26 18:34:00,530,"Hello Walleyeslayer1, My Favorite method is jigs, jigs and more jigs. We have caught thousands of walleyes jigging. Shallow, Deep, Current, Eddies, Drifting, Back trolling, Reefs, Weed lines, pitching it doesn't matter. There is something about that tap tap tap that gets my blood pumping. It is truly fishing in one of its simplest forms. A Plain Jig tipped with a piece of meat is a wonderful thing. When we go North with new guys and we get into the boat and they ask ""where is you tackle box"" and I reach into my pocket and pull out a handful a jigs they really look at me funny. By about the second or third day I usually ask them where is your Tackle box and they smile and hold out a handful of jigs. You got to love it, thanks for the post.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1084058,BenBeattie,2009-02-26 18:49:00,232,"My favourite is pitching jigs in the spring when they're still tight to shore. Hop the jig back towards the boat and watch your line as the jig falls back to bottom. You'll see the line 'twitch'..... reel up your slack and SET THE HOOK!!! Lots of fun. I also like lindy rigging when the bite is tough. Heck, I'm still having fun jigging through an 8"" hole in the ice"
1084087,Jahloaf,2009-02-26 20:01:00,74,"My favorite method is shine fishing...#4 Truturn with minnow, small lead splitshot dropped over the edge of theboat, beleive it or not it is the most effective way to catch eater 'eyes.Sometimes I slip bobber it for fun."
1084110,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-02-26 21:30:00,100,"My most effective method...The mighty jig/minnow combo (white glow)My favourite way to catch them is by accident....when slip bobbering for bass on their beds, as big walleyes are foraging in the same area(spring).I live for the surprise of having my bobber/tiny hook... go down to a ten pounder in 2 ft of water, while not expecting it."
1084162,walleyeslayer1,2009-02-27 07:59:00,19,thanks guys!....never really got into jig fishin much...usually use lindy rigs tipped with live bait... colors vary depending on light and weather...it really helps to have spots u know are holding fish.
1084171,Glenman12,2009-02-27 08:23:00,762,"We will troll until we start hitting fish consistently and then we will jig..for trolling my best luck has been with an SR5 shap rap in Canadian Pearl and then next would be the SR5 Shad rap in shad color..also, some guys in our group have luck with #5 Lindy Shadlings in firetiger, but they are hard to find now.."
1084364,Lundexp,2009-02-27 18:23:00,901,Up at the lake of the woods we use nothing but jigs tipped with a minnow. Works great in every situation we never had to try anything else.
