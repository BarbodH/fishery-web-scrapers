I'll have my two sons along for the first time. I am mostly interested in walleye but keeping the kids busy is my first priority. What do you suggest to put the most fish in the boat? What would work best and where that time of year for waldo, pike and smb? I don't think I'll have the extra scratch to hire a guide. Any advice you have is much appreciated, we're counting the days!!!."

That said, of the three species noted, I've found pike to be the most accommodating and easiest to find. Look for weeds, both cabbage type and reed types. You most likely will find them in the weeds and outside weeds. I usually start with something with some flash. I've has some success with a homemade 3/8 oz. spinnerbait with #5 willow blade with chartreuse skirt and sliver (nickle?) Daredelve spoons. My son likes the above spinnerbait or Johnson Silver Minnows with a plastic grub on the hook. Don't be surprised to get them vertical jigging, especially if you are using a chrome of chartreuse jig.

I have caught smb around H49 (look on the map for it) and I know there are bass on the way into vermilion bay in the narrows, but ask the camp people to mark the spots.watch out for the big muskies that hang around the rocky shoreline, i've lost a couple big ones, my buddy got one that was over 50"" (too bad it was out of season and had to be released).you should enjoy the west arm area, I've been fishing it a few times each year for the past 20 years ."
1084715,v-bay gord,2009-03-01 16:12:00,3168,"MN, You weren't specific on how old the kids are but I'm assuming they are on the younger side.....hence the need for action. When you say early June I am going to make the assumption the first week. This is a great time for smallmouth action and I would suggest you try and key in on this.....mainly because most kids like to cast and catching smallmouth is a blast. An area close to where you will be that I would try is the One Mile Rapids, or One Mile Lake area....cast the shallow shorelines for spawning bass. Another good area is what is referred to as Bass Lake, which can be reached by going up a short creek....it is on the very end of the West Arm. Once again cast the shorelines. I would work the walleyes at the prime times.....morning / evenings....good weather conditions, etc. The One Mile area would be a good choice. Also the Iowa Bay area, which is close as well. Spend the rest of the time mixing it up with some casting for bass and northern. Do some exploring as well.......the camp you are at offers some portage lakes that would be an adventure for a day that the kids might enjoy. My word of caution after 30 years of dealing with fishermen. Nothing sets you up for disaster when fishing with kids faster than over-hyping their expectations. Let them know that they are going to have the opportunity to catch fish...big fish...lots of fish....but they are going to have to work for them....they don't jump in the boat and you might have to go through slow times while you get to know what you are doing. If you need some further fishing tips that work on Eagle Lake you can check my profile page and the link there to my site. PM me if you have questions."
1084752,Larry Mac,2009-03-01 19:03:00,530,"Hello MNRambler, I think it is great that you are taking your two sons with you. I have 3 boys and they have been to Canada multiple times. My youngest who is 13 years old has been up north 9 times and is going twice this year. I believe there is no better time spent with your boys than what you are about to do. Reading your post you are already on the right path making your sons trip the first priority. You said “I'll have my two sons along for the first time”. Have you been to Eagle Lake before? If so you obviously have experience on that lake. It is a Big Lake. I bring kids, mine and others up North every year and the first focus has always been on them. Whether it is jigging walleyes or casting for Northern. I am always amazed at the excitement when a child catches his first Northern, small or not it is probably is the biggest fish that child has ever caught. Just like back home kids love action. The above advice from the experienced Eagle lake fisherman is invaluable, much more information on where and how will surely follow. IMHO if you have not fished Eagle Lake before I would strongly recommend trying your best to save the money to hire the services of a guide for one day early in your trip. He will familiarize yourself with the lake, fishing techniques and fish location not to mention the great share lunch he will prepare for you with the fish your sons caught. It is money well spent. Of course if you familiar with the lake and only looking to increase your catch ratio you will receive great advise on this site. Of course it is very important to make sure you sons have the proper foul weather and safety gear so they are comfortable head to toe. You and your sons have a great tip and I hope this is the first of many.Sincerely,Larry Mac"
1085027,MNRambler,2009-03-02 18:41:00,5,"Thank you all for your very helpful responses! I sincerly appreciate your thoughts. My boys are 10 and 12. Like all boys that age they much prefer catching to fishing. However, as suggested, I am taking pains to point out that the fish are not simply going to jump into the boat. We're very much looking forward to not only fishing, but spending quality time together and doing a little exploring. We're going the second full week in June so, I'm hopeful that the fishing will be good enough to keep them interested. The resort does have boats on Crabclaw, Edison, Buzzard, Clearwater, Trout and Walleye. Any dirt on what to target in those bodies of water? Again, thank you all for your help!!"
1085093,Bigfishhunter,2009-03-03 06:29:00,803,"How much do they fish at home? Are they familiar with the equipment, techniques and patience. If so then I am sure they will be fine. Take them out a few times early in the year for a half day somewhere near home. It doesn't even have to be to a good fishing location. Get them to just fish and understand how to spend time on the water. Hopefully the action is better at the resort that you are traveling a fair distance too than your home lake. If they have something to compare it to and understand fishing they will love it. I have done quite a bit of guiding and have had plenty of kids in the boat. Many similar ages to your boys. The best sports were almost always the kids and their enjoyment depended solely on their dads reaction and behavior. Stay calm through everything, smile constantly, laugh heartily and make light of any difficult circumstances. You are creating memories here. Take time out of the day to check out things that they want to do. I have had kids just want to skip rocks at shorelunch, while their dads forced them back into the boat. Don't do that, just have fun and relax it will be a blast, if you love it they will love it."

1085113,Guest,2009-03-03 07:28:00,0,"I have been to Eagle Lake in Mid May for two trips. Since you have your sons with you, I would recommend that you hire a guide for the first day or better for the first two days. A guide will put you on fish and provide you with a great shore lunch. This is a huge lake and getting some good ideas on where to fish will be the objective of your guide. The walleyes will still be shallow and a jig/ minnow rig will work well for you in this time of year. If you can locate Small Mouth Bass, your boys will have fun with them. Make certain they have warm clothing and good rain gear because June can be cool. Have FUN!"
