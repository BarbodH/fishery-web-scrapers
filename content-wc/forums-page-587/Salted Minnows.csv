1084006,old fisherman,2009-02-26 15:52:00,545,I'm a live bait fisherman. When going on a flyin would salted minnows be a good bait to take and can you buy them in Canada? Thanks.
1084020,walleyeslayer1,2009-02-26 16:32:00,19,"hey old fisherman! i have tried salted minnows once in canada. They were very messy and not very productive at all. Not sure if u can get them in canada, we got ours in the states before we left. Take live minnows,leeches, or crawlers if u can! GOOD LUCK!"
1084031,Golden Eagle,2009-02-26 17:05:00,2642,I've been using salted minnows for several years and haven't run into problems. I do my own. This spring I'll be using the ones I had ready for last October's trip that was aborted due to work.Never have tried any from the store.
1084050,Larry Mac,2009-02-26 18:21:00,530,"Hello Old Fisherman, I have fished with salted minnows on both fly in and portage lakes. On the fly in I purchased the salted minnows from our local bait shop in the states (I had him order them ahead of time for us). On the portage in we purchased them from the camp. Live minnows were not allowed on either lake. We found the salted minnow to work but were very messy. They were good for one fish (One Minnow, One Fish). They definitely out performed plastics but were not as good as live bait i.e. crawlers and leeches. I am a firm believer there is nothing better than a piece of meat on a jig. Nothing works better for us than a Live Minnow. You have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1084067,Golden Eagle,2009-02-26 19:24:00,2642,"I buy three pounds of large shiners. Drain them. Put them in a mixture of coarse salt, 20 Mule Team Borax and garlic powder. About 5 - 1 salt to Borax and just enough garlic powder to give the mixture some extra stink and flavor. Borax is a preservative. Separate the minnows so they touch salt instead of each other. Let them sit in a container for a few hours.Then spread them out on a towel outside in the sun. When they're dry, put about 5 dozen in a small ziploc bag with a zipper. Keep them in the freezer until you're ready to travel. I store mine in the freezer in camp and they aren't a bit messy. Yep, usually one minnow for one walleye. Have never tried live minnows in Canada, but I'm sure they'd be deadly. Have never needed live minnows."

1084096,drlee,2009-02-26 20:34:00,409,"I have used salted minnows that I purchase for about $1 per dozen from a bait shop in Fond du Lac, WI. My experience has been on fly-ins, drive-ins and boat-ins. I have fished right next to guys using live minnows on all occasions, except fly-ins, where live bait was not allowed. I have found absolutely no difference between salted and live minnows, except the price. I typically fish them on a jig, but also troll a little joe spinner with a salted minnow as bait. My experience has been on 7 different lakes in northern Ontario. I keep them in the refrig all week, or even for two weeks on one of my trips. Also, I have frozen them for several weeks, then thawed them out and fished them for two weeks with refrigeration as a preservative. I actually buy the minnows from a bait shop owned by a guide who works on Lake Winnebago and that is what he uses and encourages his clients to use, as well. During the later days of summer, I will also use crawlers since the walleyes have seen so many minnows that a change up seems to be productive. Again, I use the crawlers on jigs as well as on little joe spinners. One of my fishing partners, who is an expert on floating jigs, also uses salted minnows with great success. I think they are a lot less trouble, and certainly not as messy as live minnows. They are, of course, no problem to keep...I use a plastic folgers coffee container full of them in my boat all day, then refrigerate them at night. I crimp the barbs on my hooks, and do not lose my salted minnows any more frequently than the live ones. Finally, I nearly always leave 6 dozen or so with the guide on the Ontario lake I fish for two weeks at the end of July/early August. He loves them! Since he sells live minnows at his camp, he only uses them himself...does not tell his clients! I do NOT own a salted minnow company. Catch and Release! Dr. Lee"
