The first year I went there, we went to outlet bay (the only bay on Kirkness that has a creek flowing out of it) and every cast we had fish either a walleye or northern. We went through 3 doz minnows in 20 minutes then switched to twister tails and crank baits , everything worked.Fabulous fishing, fabulous lodge, great equipment (17 foot lund outfitters with 40 Hondas) this would be a great spot for you. (if you are getting back in the business, it is for sale)See you in the spring"
