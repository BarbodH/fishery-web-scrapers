1084467,Guest,2009-02-28 12:05:00,0,Thinking of going to Lac Seul Outposts for a week or 2 this summer/fall. Camp is run by Ojibway Outfitters. Ken and Brenda Robbins I believe. Any word to how good the fishing is and how good the hosts run the camp? Thanks for any/all input. Muskieman

1084490,IMWalleye,2009-02-28 13:54:00,35,"Here is my post from last yr's visit to Lac Seul Outposts. I've been going there since the 80's. I can't imagine a better place to go. NE Lac Seul Report 5/29-6/6 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rolled in last night from 9 fishing days at Lac Seul Outposts in Chamberlain Narrows. I've been fishing NE Lac Seul for last 26 yrs - I swear this was the best trip ever. Everything cooperated - the fish, the weather, the camp, the conservation officers, the airlines, the car rental agency - everything! Only problem was a broken rod tip from my brand new Cabela's rod hoisting in a 15"" fish! The walleye fishing was non-stop for both size and quantity. The first day out, my buddy and I caught 20 or so walleyes in the first hour right in the narrows - all of them were in or over the slot- no lie. We were thinking grilled cheese for dinner before a couple of eaters finally showed up. Chartreuse jig and minnow was the bait of choice. Little activity on spoons or cranks - all of the larger northern (15 between 30"" and 39"") came on jig/minnow fishing for walleyes. One of our boats did visit a shallow bay near Bear Narrows for an hour to cast for Northern. They got 15 pike on spoons, but all were 25"" and under. Biggest walleye was 27"", but we had many in the 24""-26"". I've never seen so many in the slot fish, though. Caught fish everywhere (Birch Narrows, Pecker Point, Tom's, 3 Sisters, Bear Narrows, entrance to Scaler), but by far most activity for the big walleyes and pike was in Chamberlain Narrows (approx 2 miles NW of camp) on rock/sand points. It was constant at many depths - 5', 12', 20'. Kudos again to Lac Seul Outposts - staff was great, equipment was great, cabin was great, bait was great. This is why I go back year after year after year. Only 51 weeks to go !"

Options are endless up there, and you can always find your own secluded fishin' hole, if you want.The owners(Ken and Brenda) have done a wonderful job with this camp, and be sure to ask for Chris Edwards, he will make sure that everything goes perfect for you. You may even luck into a monster muskie, while fishing walleyes here!"

1084872,Mike Kansas,2009-03-02 10:05:00,1463,Was there four years ago first week of July. Fishing was great and several guys caught Muskies while we were in camp (seven muskies I think). Walleye fishing was great and the Camp Personnel did a nice job. Mike Kansas
