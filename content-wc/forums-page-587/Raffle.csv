1084451,Jig Man,2009-02-28 10:31:00,95,Sound like nothing more than a money maker for who ever runs it. How many tickets are being sold? If it is any more than 70 the math says it it would not be worth it.
1084464,Obabikon,2009-02-28 12:03:00,2370,"I have my doubts that the number sold will reach anywhere close to 70... however, it's a way to make money for a site that charges you nothing."
1084480,joeman79,2009-02-28 13:13:00,417,It's a fund raiser! Who cares about odds. Like going to a DU banquet. You donate to assist a great organization or in this case a website stay up and running. I hope you sell hundreds of chances.
1083737,Obabikon,2009-02-25 17:25:00,2370,"I know it's stickied right above there, but I'd encourage everyone to consider buying a ticket. This is a good way to help raise money for walleye central, and ensure the site remains strong for years to come. If you have any questions about the trip, feel free to PM me or post here."
1083766,joeman79,2009-02-25 19:23:00,417,Excellent. I'll be at Lac Seul during those dates but bought a ticket anyways. I would go nuts without cking in here everyday and researching Canada fishing.
1083853,Obabikon,2009-02-26 06:02:00,2370,"Well, if you win, we'll figure out some different dates, that you can stop back by on your way South."

1083907,Hump,2009-02-26 09:45:00,578,I must be missing something. Where do you register? and what is the website?

1084055,Obabikon,2009-02-26 18:40:00,2370,"Yeah, that needs edited a little... but I was kind of impressed. A college budy of mine did that 2 years ago..."
1084056,Juls,2009-02-26 18:44:00,13414,"Hey ""Obabikon""...do you allow dogs? Juls"
1084126,Obabikon,2009-02-27 05:54:00,2370,As long as they're friendly dogs!
