1073278,SNOPRO,2009-01-12 14:31:00,108,I've been going to GullRock for 5 years now in late August. All 5 years have been fantastic!! Just wondering how Pakwash lake compares to GullRock for numbers and size of walleyes.

Gull Rock Lake has great fishing, with some great size walleye's, the local camp association has joined together to ask their guests to release the large fish. Hence you see many nice sized fish on Gull Rock Lake. Pakwash Lake has three main rivers feeding into it, the Chukuni(From Gull Rock), Trout River & English River(From Lac Seul) Fishing is a little different, there is a greater size difference and Spring has many large Northern and fantastic Walleye fishing, warmer summer waters we see the Bass turn on and the walleye ranging 13-22"" in size, hide in deeper waters within the vast structure of the Lake. The Muskie is very seldom seen in the waters, other than the south end of the lake. Northern trophies are seen around 42-46"" averages, with many keeper size up to 27.5"". Hope this helps."
