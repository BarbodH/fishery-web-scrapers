1070468,bluefin85,2008-12-28 17:33:00,31,Has anyone fished Pakwash Lake this summer? What camp did you stay at and why? Would like to go this fall and give it a try. thanks
1070851,REG,2008-12-31 09:47:00,445,"We always go up the 1st week of June but I would call that spring fishing, not summer. I've been on Pakwash a few times mid Sept. - nice time of year - leaves changing, water cooling, no bugs. You should be able to find Walleyes on Pakwash regardless of the time of year and I hear the Smallmouths do very well in fall. You also have the option of doing some Grouse hunting after mid Sept. We always stay at Snake Falls Camp. Outstanding cabins and service. Protected location on the lake. www.snakefalls.com Rob and Nancy will take good care of you. You also have the option for a 1 day fly in at one of Rob's remote lakes if you want to try that."
1070872,bluefin85,2008-12-31 11:26:00,31,Thanks for the help we just might try it. How many camps on the lake?
1071039,REG,2009-01-01 13:25:00,445,"I think there are at least 6 - 2 on the Chukuni R., including Snake Falls, 2 over on the Trout R., (these 4 are all on the north end of the lake) - one about half way down close to the Provincial Park, and at least one down at the south end of the lake. Just do a google of Pakwash resorts and you should be able to find most of them. There are lots of protected places to fish on the lake, but watch out if the wind is blowing hard out of the north or south as you can get some good sized waves out on the main lake. Wherever you go - have a great time!"
1071162,hawkeyepierce,2009-01-02 10:28:00,4,"We have been going to this camp on the river next to the highway for the last eight years fished early june, july and august even in september it is a short cruise to Packwash Lake And Bruce Lake And East Lake. Packwash is large and can be rough if the winds pick up fishing has always been excellent for both northerns and walleyes and smallmouth listen to lodge owners for placing you on the fish for the time of year you go there is so much area to fish that you will not be crowded. This year2008 we went the third week in june and you could catch all the walleye and occasional pike right on the docks or take a five minute boat ride to the mouth of the river at packwash lake ang anchor and jig for walleye and get doubles hooked on the same boat often. The camp prices are good and family friendlyhttp://www.holidaynorthlodge.ca/"
1077361,gary2242,2009-01-30 14:18:00,49,I recommend Pasha Lake Cabins. www.pashalake.com They have really nice cabins and facilities at a great price. Paska Lake is a super hot walleye lake.Gary

1085415,Pakwash Lake Camp,2009-03-04 10:42:00,17,"This is going to be our 4th season running Pakwash Lake Camp and todate I only know of one Muskie being caught this year. I was told it was trophy size and released. Back in 1966, 41 Muskie were released in Pakwash Lake, On, Canada. I was told of a small muskie caught years back in the Chukuni River. I have no pictures to offer to confirm. Does anyone have a Picture of a Pakwash Muskie or a story to share? Drop us a E-mail at [email protected]"
