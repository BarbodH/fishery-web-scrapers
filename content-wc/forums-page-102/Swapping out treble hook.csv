I understand I may loose a few fish but more interested in minimizing time out of the water and not ripping up the walleyes"

At first I used it on back and completely removed treble/hook from middle of the ratl trap. I soon found the middle hook is pretty important. I went w 2 inline hooks. I actually enjoy it. I imagine a treble catches more fish, but I figure the fish that mean business when they hit the lure will end up hooked."
6396240,adempsey2.0,2020-02-14 16:48:00,611,Consider just pinching down the barbs instead. Way easier and your catch rate wont suffer. Could also clip off one of the three tines.Otherwise you probably need a Siwash hook ans size will dependon the lure. I think you can buy single hooks made specifically for replacing trebles as well. I dont recall the namw. Maybe made by Owner.Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk
6396254,BreezyPoint,2020-02-14 18:01:00,1581,I swap trebles out all the time on spoons and muskie baits. I replace with single siwash hooks. Hook up rate for the toothy critters is as good or better.For walleyes I go a different way...I remove all but the last treble. I do as well this way as before.I really love fishing with fewer hooks. Life is much easier.Frank
6396268,DBH,2020-02-14 18:25:00,89,"I'll take the middle treble off Rapala's (or any 3 treble plug) and pinch the barbs on all my lures, typically as I use them. When replacing hooks, I'll go with red, same size, not sure if it really adds much but any advantage.Absolutely helps getting the fish back in the water quicker and with less damage, especially smaller ones"
