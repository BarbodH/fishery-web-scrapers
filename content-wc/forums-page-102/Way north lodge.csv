1358833,Knutson21,2011-10-18 12:02:00,348,I have been to Way North twice while Kevin owned it. My uncle and I were one of the first test fisherman for setting net to decide if they wanted to offer it as a day fly in location. That might of been one of the best pure fishing days of my life. We caught 100's of walleyes and my personal best northen. That was 15 years ago not sure what the fishing is like anymore. The whole experience of the place is cool. Lemonade was a fun lake too. Consistant 19 to 21 walleyes all day long. Again all of this was many years ago. We had a guy in his 80's with us and they flew him from lake to lake for free while we portaged to all the places then got in the boats and picked him up from the plan in the middle of the lakes. It was very nice of them to accomidate us like that.
1358912,Duflebag,2011-10-18 16:14:00,218,"Bob,The portages to north trout and favorable are very easy, the camp uses four wheelers. The portage to setting net is an adventure but guide only and requires walking."

1359175,Nebraska pike,2011-10-19 12:49:00,1,"Hello Bob, I too have been going to Canada for 10+ years now and have been to Way North several times, we have tried other camps and always come back to Way North and booked next years trip before we left camp this year. I have to agree that you will not find better camp owners than Clint and Laurie they are as good as it gets. Now onto the fishing we typically go in early spring as it works well with our schedules and we target big pike. Last year although we didn't get into as many of the 40""+ pike we did catch numerous in the mid to upper 30's but the large sized walleye made up for it we honestly had a hard time catching walleye under 18"" on Favourable with the largest being 27"". South trout (which is the lake the camp is on) is a very deep clear lake that has exceptionable Lake Trout fishing, and the Walleye fishing has gotten better every year and also has some large pike if you can find them. North trout has exceptionable lake trout that are also consistantly a bit larger than those on South trout with the opportunity for a magical day of big pike and the portage is very easy. Setting Net is the simply put ""a fisherman's paradise"" Walleye hitting Suiks and more upper 30"" pike than you can imagine with several over 40 mixed in on the right day. We used to fly in and last year we made the portage by land and it is definately an adventure but in my opinion is well worth it, it was snowing last year and we still went. Last but not least is the equipment, the boats on Favourable and South Trout are 18' lunds that are a couple years old, console, live wells, 40 horse, well maintained very comfortable to fish out of. I do not work for Way North I am simply a very satisfied customer that can't wait to get back there in May, Oh I forgot to mention if you do the American Plan bring your appetite Clint and Laurie definately have this mastered and if you do decide to choose Way North make sure to have Clint make you a batch of his famous Trout Chowder. If you would like to discuss any other details about the trip feel free to email me at [email protected] as I love talking fishing and your post got me all fired up about my upcoming trip."
1359191,Guest,2011-10-19 14:07:00,0,"I was at Way North several years ago when there was different management, at that time the camp and boats were crap. I hope the the current people are doing better. You will be on South Trout Lake which is not very big and is decent fishing. North trout lake is a reasonable portage and sometimes OK. Setting Net is a plane ride (not a portage) and when we were there an extra $200.00 dollars per day. Favourable is a boat ride the length of South Trout and then a fairly long portage. It is a very good lake but everybody in camp cannot fish there as they are restricted on the number of boats they can have on that lake. People from Way North cannot fish on Lemonade. There are other fly-ins in the same area that have cabins or lodges that are much easier to access and better fishing."
1359207,phishfearme,2011-10-19 14:57:00,1242,"you need to study their web site closely:http://www.waynorthlodge.com/ setting net now looks very expensive and weather you hike or fly it's about the same price. so for days that you can't get to favourable (and without lemonade) available you'll be restricted to n and s trout - mediocre (but big) walleye, some pike and mainly clear, deep, infertile (oligotropic) laker lakes. depending on the time of year you go you may need deeper trolling gear although we were there in early july and deep diving plugs (that run 10-12 ft) worked well. your wife should enjoy it - especially the american plan - it's what we consider luxury. i also think your proposed trip duration is kinda short but you can make it work. phish"
1359450,Guest,2011-10-20 11:46:00,0,"You won't find a better northern pike lake than Favourable.Our group caught & released hundreds of fish in the 12 - 16 lb. range.Our largest 43"" was 22lbs.There's a portage involved but it's worth it.Lots of walleye as well.Only fished N.Trout once caught some nice pike and lakers.The cabins,boats & motors,etc. were all very good.We would return."
1359611,Guest,2011-10-21 06:05:00,0,thanks guys... Indyguy- do you have any other recommendations? to avoid possible conflict and arguments please email me at [email protected] thanks !!!!
6397362,Guest,2020-02-18 09:40:00,0,"Bob, i have fished way north lodge several times. i heard it is no longer available to outsiders. a gold mining company uses it. fishing got poor as the local natives were allowed to use nets fishing for white fish. decimated the trophy pike fishing. Im headed back up there to the area. got any suggestions"
6397564,maddogg,2020-02-18 18:13:00,178,One thing I learned about some outfitters is they don't know the difference between 300 ft and 3oo yds.
1358544,Guest,2011-10-17 11:52:00,0,I have been all over northwest Ontario.... this coming summer I am loooking at Way North Lodge 185 miles north of Red Lake...anyone have info on this place... please let me know what you think because it will be my 25th anniversary celebration with my wonderful wife. my other option is Woman River Camp....a nice drive - to i have been to before... love the owner and the place.
1358558,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-10-17 12:26:00,235,You must like driving.
1358575,Guest,2011-10-17 12:57:00,0,no .....you fly 185 miles north from Red Lake...
1358581,HeHooksHimself,2011-10-17 13:14:00,725,"Bob, I have been to Woman River Camp three times. Paul and Deb are great hosts. It seems you spend a lot of time on the water getting to fishing spots, but it is quite scenic. Every time we have been there, the fishing has been so-so, seems like the closer to Big Woman Lake, the better the fishing. I love it that Paul doesn't nickel/dime you. No hidden charges and he provides everything you need. Also good opportunities with day trips to different lakes- all included in the price. Great people, i just wish the fishing was better. But- I did catch a 42"" northern in Big Woman Lake!"
1358624,phishfearme,2011-10-17 15:35:00,1242,"have been to way north and would definitly recommend them. although i was there when kevin geary owned it, i've heard nothing but praise about the new owner. two things i'd check with before i booked: 1 - ask him where's the generator? how loud is it? how much do you keep it on? (we had a cabin right next to it and it was miserable - i hear it's been moved and is new.). 2 - can i have a boat anytime i want to fish south trout (where the lodge is)? we could never seem to get a boat to just fish the excellent lake where the camp is. 3 - if you go, make sure you do at least one day trip to setting net lake. they used to take you there for free (or tips) but now i think it's a added fee (?). i also think they added another day fly-out lake. north and south trout lakes will provide very good lakers, favourable for large pike and walleye (a boat ride and long portage), lemonade for walleye (they may not be able to access this lake anymore but it's owrth it) and setting net for walleye and pike. we did the housekeeping plan but got stuck there an extra day due to weather and was provided meals and a bed by the owners - very nice meals and cabin arrangements. we flew via a DC3 from red lake and landed on an old gold mine dirt runway, then took a school bus from the runway to boats which took us to the cabins/lodge - a lengthly process but it works. could mark maps for you if you wish. phish"
1358771,Guest,2011-10-18 08:15:00,0,"phishfearme , would a 4 or 5 day trip be enough to get a feel for the fishing and lakes? have you been to Sportsman's Lodge on Little Vermillion just north of Red Lake? how does this compare? i hear South Trout is clear... is it tough to fish. what is the average size of the walleye? Hehookshimself, i have been to WRC once before and thought it was great, Paul is awesome and the portage to Spot lake was spectacular.... just looking for a different experience."
1358788,Duflebag,2011-10-18 08:48:00,218,The current owners Clint and Laurie are really doing a nice job with the camp. They are very dedicated and work hard at providing excellent service. I would highly recommend Way North Camp. No connection to the camp.
1358793,Larry S,2011-10-18 09:13:00,665,"Bob, I have never been to Way North,but have fished a number of times with phishfearme(Bob K) and if he recommends Way North then I trust that it is an excellent place Bob are you from Phoenix,and did I correspond with you a number of years ago about going on a fishing trip? I'm from Las Vegas Area Larry S"
1358807,Guest,2011-10-18 09:57:00,0,no.... I am from Indiana. been to Canada 17 times in 14 yrs. but have taken the last 3 years off due to kids in college. about WAY NORTH --- i am taking my wife up there so i am a little worried about the portages to setting net and favourable.
1358818,Guest,2011-10-18 10:20:00,0,Duflebag.... how tough are the portages? do they charge to go to Setting Net?
