As most fishing stories go - the catching wasnt the biggest event of the day lol Anyone else got some good ""the ones that got away stories"" My newest post is uphttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/n...on-your-leader Cheers Andrew"
6397316,Bill Krejca,2020-02-18 07:58:00,6107,"This happened in the 1960's, but I remember it like it was last week. LOW, Sabaskong Bay, one mile east of the inlet to Turtle Lake. My late father and a cousin fished a large weed bed, while a friend and I hit another area. As Dad retrieved his favorite top water bait, a Heddon Lucky 13, the musky hit right at the boat. Dad didn't get a good hook set(or any hook set), and it released the bait, after a very short splashing rod bender right at the boat, but only after they saw it was mighty big. The following day, we switched partners, Dad wanting to go back to the same spot where the musky got off. At the time, the method was to drop anchor (no electric) and cast over the weeds, then move a bit and repeat. After repeatedly plugging every inch of weeds, we moved slightly and continued. Dad had on his same Lucky 13 bait, and I had on a Musky jitterbug, Frog finish, a top water bait with a large metal scoop in front, which causes turbulence on the surface. Standing and retrieving, I was super primed for action, anxiously awaiting my chance to land the fish of my dreams. The action happened in a flash. One moment I was reeling in my bubbing Arbogast, perhaps 10 feet from the boat, and the next milli-second, (I was still standing) I was looking directly down the throat of the monster musky, which came up behind the bait, mouth wide, wide open.( Imagine videos of alligators doing same.)I would swear under oath the depth which I saw into the fishes mouth had to be at least a foot and a half, I remember the jaws, the teeth, and the pink, red, of the inside throat, a view seldom seen by an angler! Stopping here for a moment in the story, it would appear the fish was mine, huh? Unfortunately, it again was not to be for the Krejca family. As I related earlier, I was eagerly awaiting my turn at the monster. So eagerly, that in the split second the fish came after my bait, I reacted, perhaps recalling Dad's failed attempt to set the hook hard the day before, or just because a maybe life-time chance was awaiting, and I was too over ready. At any rate, I set the hook very quickly, too quickly and very hard, The bait, untouched by the fish, flew through the air, landing behind me on the water, out of the musky's almost bite-down, and the fish was gone. Had I been looking the other way, or had been slow to react, perhaps...... We continued to fish the area,(actually for years after) but never again saw the monster, several next days of trying produced no better, the fish of both of our dreams was gone, but the memories are still there, multi decades after. Such are dreams made. Bill"
6397366,gordy28,2020-02-18 09:46:00,437,Bill - thats a great story - thanks for sharing! I have never used them for musky but I learned how to fish for bass on a jitterbug and still wheel one out off the dock today I will say when my brother lost the musky referenced in my story I just saw its head shake - but I feel like the red of its gills flaring and big maw going side to side is imprinted in my brain many years later
6397508,Carnhzkr,2020-02-18 15:12:00,964,"Since the topic of this thread is the one that got away, you already know how this story ends. We were on our annual trip to the beautiful waters of the English River, north of Kenora, I'm guessing it must have been about 1977. We had fished that stretch of the river many times and had managed some really nice walleyes, but never hit the 10 pound mark (this was in the days when you measured fish by pounds rather than inches). My dad hooked into one that stayed down for a long time, and we were sure it must be a large pike  until he got her to the surface and we all yelled at once as it was easily the largest walleye any of us had ever seen. Now, I could jump to the end of the story and say that my mom tried to net the fish and it jumped out as she brought the trophy up out of the water, but a little background might add color. My mother was, and still is a good sport. These early Canadian trips were not her choice, but she always came along and endured without complaint. Eventually, she learned to love the family fishing trips, but one thing she has always hated and I mean HATED was netting fish. She always thought of it as a no-win proposition, kind of like kicking extra points. If you do it right, well, that's what is expected but if you screw up then everyone hates you. My dad was a farmer extraordinaire and as all good farmers do, he would routinely find and fix the design flaws in almost everything he purchased. When he'd buy a new feed grinder, for instance, the first thing he'd do is remove all of the safety guards so he could tighten and oil the numerous belts and chains. Safety? It's a miracle I still have all of my limbs. His fishing equipment was no exception. He had purchased a new net prior to this trip. Its design flaw was that it was much too deep which made it difficult to remove small pike and treble hooks. The fix was a simple one, just tie a knot in the middle to eliminate the excess, and as most of his fixes did, it worked like a charm. You could easily pop small walleye in and out with no tangles or fuss. So there was my mom, net in hand and dipped slightly into the water as my dad coaxed his walleye of a lifetime headfirst toward the boat. I'm sure he was already planning the place of honor in our home where the mount would forever reside. I still remember  headfirst into the net, she lifts the fish, then flop, back down into the deep. My dad's face went pale and he instantly turned to face mom. I could see his initial reaction was to scream and likely yell some profanity at the netter, but with the speed of an Intel microprocessor he changed his tone and the words came out, it was my fault, I shouldn't have tied that net. Good save, dad. You lost a fish but kept a wife."
6397532,Bill Krejca,2020-02-18 16:16:00,6107,"Re: tying the net - I can understand completely why it was tied. Deep nets are great for the sometime fish, but can be a real beach when trying to unhook a landed one. If the held net hoop hits the arm pit and the fish can not be held, the depth is just too deep. Sitting the fish down results in slime on the boat and because of the flopping can be detrimental to a good release. I have tied several of my nets in the past; room permitting, having 2 nets on board can usually be beneficial. Bill"
