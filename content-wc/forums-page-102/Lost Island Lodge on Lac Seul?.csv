6398424,Slim03,2020-02-21 17:03:00,159,When in August are you going up?
6396976,cpk,2020-02-17 08:02:00,27,"Very helpful, thank you!"
6397010,Slim03,2020-02-17 09:03:00,159,Stay there every year. Plenty of good fishing around the resort. Can also easily run about 30 minutes north and get into the big water.
6397294,Carnhzkr,2020-02-18 06:57:00,964,"Sniper and X4, or anyone else that drives past Lost Island on their daily commute, where do you stay, Sioux Lookout? There's no place to stay in Hudson, is there?"
6397304,Look-A-Like,2020-02-18 07:31:00,78,"Lac Seul Resort is just a short boat ride from Lost Island Lodge. I've stayed there 3 times, not fancy but the cabins are clean, nice protected harbor and good fishing close to the resort. http://www.lacseulresort.com/"
6397328,Sniper1980,2020-02-18 08:39:00,33,We stay at country cabins. Been there for over 15 years. Right next door is rivers edge resort as well. We like fishing big vermilion and lac seul. Our boats trailer great and load/unload super easy that we fish both lakes every day. Depending on our mood.
6397586,x4flatfish,2020-02-18 19:24:00,319,"We stay a River Edge Outfitters. Been there the past 7 years. About 3 miles from the public ramp on Lost Lake. This camp is on Big Vermillion where you can catch smallmouth, muskie and lake trout. Cabins are all redone and very nice. They are priced right as well. If you want to stay on Lac Seul you might look at Lac Seul Resort. A little too rustic for me at this stage of my life however. Where ever you pick you will most likely have a hard time getting reservations for this year. Try sooner than later...."
6397596,Carnhzkr,2020-02-18 19:54:00,964,Thanks Flarfish. I'm not looking for a lodge for this year. I'm already booked at Fisherman's Cove on the NW side of LS in June and Lost Island in August. I was just wondering where people that launch at Hudson are staying.
6397948,Tbayfisher,2020-02-19 20:49:00,31,"From where we fished when staying there, there was no need to travel up the lake, fishing was great within a mile or 2 from the lodge."
6398004,Sniper1980,2020-02-20 07:28:00,33,"Very true. Been going up there every year since 1991. We enjoy making a couple runs up the lake each trip. Plus it allows my kids to get familiar with the waters without using a map. Otherwise we do quite well from young narrows, crooked rapids, pelican etc etc"
6398052,eyecatcher1,2020-02-20 09:51:00,323,"I don't use the Hudson ramp anymore, but I do launch at Deception when I fish Lac Seul. I stay at Red Pine Lodge. www.fishredpine.com"
6396680,cpk,2020-02-16 11:25:00,27,"I recently posted looking for suggestions on places to stay within a shorter drive to Indian Island area on Lac Seul. We've fished that area for years and know it well. There were a couple resorts near there but they only allowed larger parties and there's only 2 of us going. As a result we had to look at other areas. We recently settled on Lost Island Lodge. The reviews have been excellent and posts here about it have been the same. Oddly enough, we can't find where it's located on Lac Seul! Their address listed on the website is just a mailing address and the directions listed say to drive 9 miles from Dryden to a boat launch sign...and that's it. Does anyone have a map that shows the location? Any tips on fishing spots in the area?"
6396692,icspinner,2020-02-16 12:19:00,92,"South of Sioux Lookout, take Hwy 664 west. Just before you get to Hudson, there is a public boat ramp for Lost Lake, they'll pick you up there. The camp is on a island a short ways out from that boat ramp. I went there two years, it's a long boat ride to Lac Seul lake. But, our first year there we caught more fish than we ever have for a Canada trip in Lost Lake itself and the river on the east side of Lost Lake (which actually takes you to Lac Seul). Second year the weather wasn't cooperative and the fishing was down, but still respectable. Shane and I had a disagreement on my final bill, it included a LOT of things I didn't expect. We should have communicated better, I regret the way I handled it."
6396732,cpk,2020-02-16 14:21:00,27,Care to expand on this part? Anything I should look out for on the bill? Feel free to PM if you don't want to post it publicly.
6396782,Sniper1980,2020-02-16 16:59:00,33,Photo of lost island lodge attached. From launchPersonally never stayed there. Prices too high but drive past it twice a day on our trip.
6396826,x4flatfish,2020-02-16 19:19:00,319,"We also travel by it daily on our trips. It is located in Lost Lake on the Southeast section of Lac Suel, and yes Lost Lake would be considered part of Lac Suel. More like 45-50 miles from Dryden. Been fishing that area for 45 years and never heard of Indian Island, so wondering how far you have to travel to get there? Might want to hire a guide if you are not familiar with SE part of the lake..."
6396886,rather-be-fishin,2020-02-16 22:19:00,429,Lost Island Lodge is a very long way from Indian Island & Kliener Point Area. Silver Water Wheel would be the closest Resort to that area. Don't think you will want to boat that far. Hire a guide & find new areas to fish closer to Lost Island Lodge. Attached is a map of Lac Seul with Indian Island circled on the left & Lost Island Lodge area on the right. Good luck! RBF
6396894,Tbayfisher,2020-02-17 03:13:00,31,"I stayed there twice several years ago, I had a 14 foot and a 20 hp. Fishing was excellent, within eyeshot of the lodge. Took my nephews there, travelled up the lake one day, nephew caught a 49 inch musky.one evening in a few hours we caught 96 walleye. Kids were counting. I was very happy with the lodge, nice comfortable cabins, fuel depot, during a heavy downpour, Shane was pumping boats( nice of him), we were picked up at the dock, truck was taken to a secure parking area. I would return."
6396964,cpk,2020-02-17 07:56:00,27,"This is great, thank you!"
6396968,cpk,2020-02-17 07:59:00,27,"This is exactly what I was looking for, thank you! Yeah, looks to be a long ways from our usual spot. When a place says they're on Lac Seul I automatically think they're on the main body of it. My brain couldn't put that together with the description of the location from their website. Looks like we'll be getting to know a new area from scratch!"
6396974,cpk,2020-02-17 08:02:00,27,Looks to be a long ways from Indian Island/Kleiner Point but it sounds like the fishing is still excellent. It will just take a little more to get familiar with the area and find them!
