6393564,mjames,2020-02-06 08:20:00,18,Yes but the new V2 chip coming out in March is rumored to have all of Lake of the Woods coverage up to Kenora. No sense buying the Woods/Rainy chip if the new chip has more coverage IMO.
6397374,Guest,2020-02-18 09:53:00,0,The LakeMaster chip does not have any info of the lake when you head east past Lobstick Bay and west out past Mouse and Rope Island which the LakeMaster chip does.
6397378,Guest,2020-02-18 09:56:00,0,Sorry !! I meant the Navionis has all the info needed
6392268,rommel,2020-02-02 11:26:00,369,i am trying to get opinions of the value of the lake master rainy/woods chip for the soiux narrows area of LOTW.i have HB and link so LM chip would work best if its worth it. I currently own navionics chip but have found it to be relatively inaccurate on the lakes ive used it on. we're trying that area for the first time this year. any insight would be greatly appreciated.
6392284,Carnhzkr,2020-02-02 12:40:00,964,"I have the Woods & Rainy chip for my Humminbird and have used it twice out of Morson. It is fantastic and worth every penny. The map is in HD and shows 1 foot contours and allows you to really hone in on the nooks and crannies on a reef to find that spot on the spot. Keep in mind that it doesn't cover all of LOTW, but I think it covers everything you'd need out of SN. Here's a link showing the coverage for the V3 map (mine is V4, not sure if that's the latest): https://www.humminbird.com/sites/hum...s-rainy_v3.pdfAre you using your Navionics in Canada? I use the Navionics on Lac Seul and it's better than nothing, but far from accurate but it's the only game in town."
6392552,rommel,2020-02-03 09:09:00,369,i have used navionics on lac suel and was not impressed.
6393292,G I Mike,2020-02-05 13:27:00,89,"I fish out of Sioux Narrows frequently. Go as far north as Yellow Girl Bay and as far south as Bell Island (Whitefish). HB with a Lakemaster coverage is excellent, very accurate.I have used Navionics and for that area not even close."
6393318,mjames,2020-02-05 14:16:00,18,"+1 to that! Abosultely the best chip for the area hands down! FYI, if you can wait a month or 2 Humminbird is releasing the Lakemaster Ontario V2 chip in March, which will include all of Lake of the Woods all the way to Kenora plus alot of smaller lakes in the area all on one chip. Apparently they finished surveying the entire lake!"
6393322,PRO-V16,2020-02-05 14:46:00,454,There doesn't exist a good map for Lac Suel. It has never been surveyed. The only fairly accurate thing on the chip is shore outline and navigation routes.
6393352,rommel,2020-02-05 16:11:00,369,great info. thanks. i looked at LM ontario and it did not list LOTW as a lake on the current version.
6393378,Carnhzkr,2020-02-05 17:18:00,964,"They make you buy the Woods & Rainy chip. If you're fishing LOTW and have a Bird, get the chip, the detail is incredible. There was one area I was fishing and noticed one small contour circle indicating a 1 foot rise in this small area, like a tiny little mini reef. I dropped a jig and picked up 3 or 4 on that one tiny spot. It was probably a 3 or 4 foot rock, but I'd have never known it was there if I hadn't had the chip."
6393444,Habitual Eyer,2020-02-05 19:44:00,144,Lake master have good coverage of Red Lake and Gullrock ?
6393452,Carnhzkr,2020-02-05 20:03:00,964,No. Nothing north of Woods & Rainy. NAVIONICS Canada is the only option at this time.
