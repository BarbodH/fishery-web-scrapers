6395116,ackvil,2020-02-11 12:24:00,177,Two years ago we hit a storm on Lac Seul. We were in a 14 ft boat and the waves were incredible. We started to head back to camp when we hit a wave headfirst. My hat flew off my head and a fishing rod and reel ended up in the Lake.
6395326,BornToFish,2020-02-12 05:54:00,1224,"Greetings, The threads mentioning jaw spreaders reminded me of something that happened on one of my first fishing trips in NW Ontario. I took two jaw spreaders with me on that trip - my favorite jaw spreader and a back-up. Both of these jaw spreaders ended up in the lake in the first few days of the trip. Relatively small pike shook them loose while removing hooks. I drove to Ear Falls and purchased another jaw spreader. I also purchased a small foam float on a bead-style chain. I thought the float would keep the jaw spreader from sinking if thrown by another pike. Wrong! A pike threw this jaw spreader the first day out with it. I watched it SLOWLYYYYYY sink to the bottom of the lake. Since then, I adjusted the size of the floats and tested them in advance of my trips by verifying they float. I haven't lost one since. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6393688,lenray,2020-02-06 13:40:00,467,"On Horseshoe Lake up the Pipestone River last August. Nephew of my wife and his 3 boys. Two boats. Nephew and his two boys had their boat go down. They had both sets of keys in a plastic tote along with passports and two birth certificates and money. All of that was lost--also cooking pans-camp stove-big flat of water-all of one boys clothes-cooking oil and many canned goods--just to name a few of the things lost....went up with 3 passports and 2 birth cert. and I was the only one at the border at the SOO to have a passport coming back into Michigan. Some items floated for a brief period of time, but with 3 of them trying to survive much was lost. About 120-130 miles north of the small village of Pickle Lake and no keys and at least 6 hours from the nearest GM Store in Dryden. Quite the trip and I WAS 74 AT THE TIME........"

6393810,kona77,2020-02-06 19:45:00,236,Looks like a number of folks have thrown a jaw spreader or pliers back in the lake after you take care of a fish.. Have seen that in my boat several times over the years.. We finally got smart and now just tie a string to these tools.. Have not had to rely on the string/rope but I know it is just a matter of time.. Have had two rods go over board in 25+ years but have also caught two rods/reels so I am even in that category..
6393826,srk-low,2020-02-06 20:18:00,78,I have enjoyed this string of posts. Not trying to rain on the parade but the two things I have lost at Lake of the Woods were my parents. Both of their ashes were spread in a special place in White Fish Bay. Keep up with the posts and be safe.

6394766,Carnhzkr,2020-02-10 13:53:00,964,"Wow. Really scare ordeal, I'm sure. Glad to hear everyone eventually made it home safe. I've fished that area a couple of times many years ago so I understand the remoteness, which makes any major mishap like this even worse. This is one of those stories that at the time, you're just glad to get it over and get back home, but years later when you look back you realize it's one of life's adventures that you learn from and grow as a result. I'm sure you retell the story every time your group gets together."
6393370,Wrktfsh,2020-02-05 16:46:00,492,Jigging I got a nasty tangle of line around the tip. In disgust I gave the rod a gentle toss to the bow and was going to fish another rod . The rod took a perfect bounce and into the water. Nice phenix rod with a smoke spinning reel. I scrambled to grab it and went into the lake. The waters pretty cold June 1st
6393376,GBS,2020-02-05 16:57:00,2271,"Fished for 5 days at a remote drive-in lodge. Caught the biggest northern I'll ever see - 52""! Packed up the car for the 2 day drive home. Wasn't till we got here, did I realize I had left all my rods and reels leaning against the wall inside the cabin. Hidden behind the door when the door was open for hauling stuff out. Spent the rest of the summer (July on) using the one pole I had at home - a trashy K-Mart special that was my daughters when she was 6. The lodge owner found them, but we had a devil of a hard time trying to figure out how to get them home. Mailing was out, as Canadian customs wasn't about to believe that they were personal use items. Even had a couple of fine folks here volunteer to try and get them the next time they went to Flin Flon. The lodge owner winters in Oklahoma, so dropped him off late in the fall, by making a detour on his way home. Yep, we bought him and his wife a great steak dinner for the trouble."
6393380,Pymbet,2020-02-05 17:20:00,42,Lost my entire tackle box in the first set of rapids in the Little Current River canoeing from O'Sullivan to Percy. Tipped over. Why I took my whole tackle box is beyond me. Didn't lose anything else...except my pride. That was nearly 30 years ago and the $150 in tackle lost seemed like a fortune to a 26 year old.
6393382,maddogg,2020-02-05 17:26:00,178,While fishing in Canada my friend and I pulled our boat up onto a island and took a break. We threw out a couple of slip bobbers in hope of a few bites while we were lounging on the island after a short time our boat came drifting by. Neither of us is a good swimmer but luckily we had a tackle box on shore with us. Two daredevils and 40 casts later we had our boat back. We still talk about how lucky we were that it floated the right way around the island.
6393416,Esoxfeign1313,2020-02-05 18:39:00,79,"Flipped a canoe twice. Lost all of my gear both times! Funny enough, the second time it happened, my brother lost all of his gear too, but about a year later he got a call from someone that lived on the lake (about a mile from where we flipped) who said his tackle box washed up on their beach!"

6393480,jackpotjohnny48,2020-02-06 02:28:00,153,"I also fished Pipestone last summer, and I'm going back again in 2020.... As for lost items, in 2012 my fishing partner and I were casting for muskies on the Winnipeg River in Minaki. I loaned him a new double bladed Ghosttail I had just purchased specifically for the trip. He attached it to his line, while using new Shimano Calcutta 400 reel and a new St. Croix rod, with split grip cork on the handle. About mid afternoon, his hands must have gotten sweaty, because the rod slipped completely out of his hand as he was following through on a cast. Threw his $600 rod and reel combo (with MY $26 Ghosttail attached!!!!) into the Winnipeg River. The split cork grip was not quite buoyant enough to keep the Shimano Calcutta afloat, and I couldn't quite reach his rod before it sank out of sight. When we got back to customs in International Falls, the customs officer asked, ""Did you leave anything in Canada."" ""Yup, we sure did,"" I replied. I then proceeded to tell her the story... Also, last year we took some waves over the bow of the canoe in the Rushing River Provincial Park. I had my camera sitting on the floor of the canoe in a NON-WATERPROOF camera bag. So the camera got waterlogged / destroyed. Had to buy a new camera at the Walmart in Kenora to get me through the rest of the trip... Here's hoping that 2020 goes a little more according to plan....

Me shopping for a new muskie net(again) reminded me of this topic. The backstory.....last summer on Pipestone Lake a mere 5 minutes into the trip my new muskie net broke the holder my cousin put it in, flew out of the boat, and proceeded to sink to the bottom in 100+ foot of water. There was $200 gone. Just wondering if anyone else has stories to share."

6393264,KSjim,2020-02-05 12:04:00,88,Using the pliers to unhook a fish and throw the pliers in the lake instead of the fish. This seems to happen to someone in our group every few years. Having the jaw spreaders fly out of a pike's mouth into the lake has happened a time or two over the years. Not really lost but one year on get away night I went to lay out my travel shirt and pants and could not find my clean jeans. Come to find out Uncle B had grabbed them by accident and had been wearing them most of the week!

I got lucky and did managed to snag it, some one was looking after me that day!"

Boat has all or gear, luggage, food and everything else we need to the weeks stay. As we are unloading the boat I notice water coming in from the back. Turns out that the bilge pump snapped off and water is just flowing in. Crestliner 1750 Lucky there was a hoist around the corner, just shoved a wine cork in the inlet and made that work. Next day we were running wide open and my partner yells ROCK, I pull back on the throttle only to go past neutral and jam the gears. Had to take off the lower unit to get to the gears and smack them with a hammer to get them un-jammed. Had a tick in the unit rest of the week. Snapped a St Croix on a sang on a super windy day that trip as well. And took a muskie treble hook into the hand. Not one of the best trips for me.."
