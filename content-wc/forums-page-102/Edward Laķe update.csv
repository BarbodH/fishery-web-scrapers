Got a couple but slow.changed to a few diff colirs but still slow.Grabbed my other rid with a vibrato on and started pickibg up fish right away.seemed they like the noise and the flash and the speed.They hit that lure hard so i just experimented with that lure in a few colors but definatly they liked the perch color.Never did use a minnow rest of my time there.Hooked into a real good pike to and that big girl gave my mojo rod a great workout.Another succesful few hours at KC,s Landing.Still plenty of ice fishing left.Give Clarks a look if you want a few days of some good fishing.www.clarksresorts.com"

6394996,prov1800,2020-02-11 06:58:00,5010,It happens in feb.usually picks up in march again. But 15 walleye in a couple of hrs is not bad.The pike was icing on the cake.Pike might of have been the culprit. Last week was same thing when i caught the big pike.If i was a walleye id be outta tgere to.when your up and weather is good we usually drill holes outside of the shacks.Did you see clarks facebook from last week.The folks fishing caught a 20# laker from the shack.
6395010,Eckohlt,2020-02-11 07:38:00,3685,That's a dandy laker is it rare to catch them around the shack John?also do I need to bring a auger? if it's nice out I like to move around outside and dunk plenty holes a pick off fish
6395014,prov1800,2020-02-11 07:40:00,5010,No.They have a auger there to use.
6395024,Eckohlt,2020-02-11 07:51:00,3685,Ok that will save me from hauling mine up thanks
6395090,prov1800,2020-02-11 10:44:00,5010,Once in a while they get caught there
