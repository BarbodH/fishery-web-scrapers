6394560,Whopper,2020-02-10 04:48:00,340,"Pikepro is correct, Brett and company will take good care of your group. Lot's of small walleyes and the lake has a great population of big thick pike. I'll be there for the walleye opener and it can't come soon enough"
6394572,fishin10,2020-02-10 06:08:00,2315,"Fished out of Sportsman Lodge 2 years ago at the opener with members from WC, had a great time. Lots of small Walleye and big Pike as mentioned before. Brett and family run a nice operation, you will not be disappointed. Would love to get back there, can't convince my brother to get on a float plane."
6394576,fldoc1,2020-02-10 06:09:00,69,Have been there the past 2 years in July. Lots of eater walleyes mostly relating to humps. The northerns in July are relating to the eater walleyes and each year we caught a few around 40 by casting Johnson spoons or 5 of Diamonds or red/white dardevle or the Williams spoons. The lake is not that big so easy to get around but not so small you are bumping into other fisherman in July. Brett will take of you and we had a super time. We took in worms and worked well tipping jigs. Hopefully they do the weekly fish fry. Randy from Duluth
6394870,Golden Eagle,2020-02-10 19:20:00,2642,Wanting you to know that Whopper is so tight that he catches walleyes with a bare jig. No meat on the jig. No plastic on the jig. Says he doesn't need them and he's right.
6397336,webbdog,2020-02-18 08:53:00,8,Been to Sportsman's 3 times most recent in 2017. Great Lake for Pike especially Big Pike. Shallow Lake with a lot of cabbage. Walleye are abundant and seem to be getting a bit larger then in the past. Accommodations are ok.
