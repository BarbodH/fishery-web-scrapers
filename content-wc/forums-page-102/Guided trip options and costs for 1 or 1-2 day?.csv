We're reasonably experienced fishermen but wonder if it might make more sense to hire a guide with boat rather than try to rent a boat and make sense of a brand new body of water we're only going to fish for a day. We've rarely had luck with lake trout this time of year and might be interested in chasing those a bit. Otherwise, we're interested in large walleye and pike and would plan to release all overs. Lac Seul is an obvious choice and certainly high on our list but we're open to other nearby lakes too. We'll have a truck to get ourselves there and back. With that said: I have a couple questions for the group: 1. What lake (and if LS maybe what area of LS) do you recommend and why? 2. How much should we expect to pay for a guide for a day? Apologies if this has been covered: I searched the forum and found more about tipping etiquette than I did on guide rates. I am open to PMs from guides and, in case it matters, can be pretty flexible regarding day of the week. Thanks in advance for sharing your ideas! Kevin"

He charged 100 for the full day and we had a great day fishing. Still think about it now and then when not having a good day or doing a less than desireable job. This has been quite a few years ago but was just a short drive up the road to the landing on LS. Don't know if he is still at the resort or not."

6396520,The tank,2020-02-15 18:55:00,340,Prov1800 I would say knows that area pretty well. I like LS and Cedar lake in that area. That time of year he maybe booked already.
