Was not a fan too much of freshwater fishing (vegetarian fish mostly) but sea fishing for seabass was my favourite. I wish I had been making videos back then, hopping along the rocks, dodging the tide and slamming 10 bass on live bait was heaven, and the southwest coast of England has some spectacular scenery."

My Pop was the one who got my brother and I fishing and he did most of his fishing for trout in Scotland on the fly- a lot ""on the banks of the Clyde"" as he used to say Very different than what I have gravitated towards - I never had the patience for fly fishing"
