6443872,prov1800,2020-05-25 11:23:00,5010,Thx.It is pretty nice except for the not working part.
6443874,prov1800,2020-05-25 11:24:00,5010,Just fish down there and pretend your here Ron.
6443880,Eckohlt,2020-05-25 12:10:00,3685,"I'm spoiled john I'll wait it out,I need to be deep in the jungle that's where I like to fish,ain't no jungle in Minnesota just concrete jungle,rod"
6443974,prov1800,2020-05-25 17:20:00,5010,I hear you.Hope somehow they can open border Ã nd keep people safe.Will be hard to do.
6440900,prov1800,2020-05-18 19:17:00,5010,"Wife and i got out on Cliff Lake to get some lake trout fishing in.Passed by a good spring walleye area and we decided to stop and try it.So glad we did.Caught around 60 walleyes all over 20""+.Amazing fishing so we hit a few other spots all close by.Caught a bunch of smallies also mixed up in with the walleyes and 2 incidental muskies.Never gt after the lake trout till around 1 oclock but gave them a try anyways.Put 2 in the boat and lost a couple.Always love fishing Cliff Lake.No boats on the lake today and absolutely beautifull day.Walleyes were in 3-5 ft of water and with little wind we could basically sight fish them today."
6440948,Eckohlt,2020-05-19 03:30:00,3685,"Nice to see john but it's pure torture,it's like your on a fly in lake not a soul in sight my friend"
6440964,prov1800,2020-05-19 06:15:00,5010,Your right Rod.Cliff is usually pretty quite.Even with border open.Its not a walleye lake and they are tough to fish.people get frustrated.Usually a bit busier now because of trout. Definatly a treat not that i mind seeing boats on any lake but that flyout feeling you said.
6440976,Bill Krejca,2020-05-19 06:44:00,6107,"Wow! Terrific day! Sorta like going back in time maybe 70 years! No other humans, and lots of dandy fish. Is this Heaven? Bill"
6440982,prov1800,2020-05-19 06:57:00,5010,Its definately a treat.wife and i are looking forward to the crappie spawn.I found that particular time was to busiest.We are planning on a Lac Suel trip to Broad Lake. 30 mi boat ride and dont think we will see a boat along the way there either.
6443068,prov1800,2020-05-22 15:39:00,5010,"We did go out on Cliff again on Wednesday and forgot to post it.Did have another good walleye bite but a bit slower.Again were into larger fish and kept 2 18"" as we havnt found a school of smaller fish yet. Lol.Whatcreally bit well were the smallmouths.We dont count fish but must of had at least into 50-60.Had some 20""bass hit our lures.Really great time catching them and they are so much fun to catch.Only one muskie was caught but i lost 2 brand new bass cranks to muskies.Plus we were sight fishing for both walleye and smallmouths again and could see muskies touring by and some pike.Toward us heading home we stopped at a couple of trout spots and jig a few of those up.kept one smaller laker. Hoping to take a trip tomorrow on Cedar and will see if water temps have the crappies spawning if not we will fish forwalkeye and try some casting for pike."
6443086,Eckohlt,2020-05-22 17:05:00,3685,"John when they do open the borders I don't recommend cliff as all the fish will have very sore lips and well educated from you and the wife,probably the wife out fished you would be my guess,watch out crappies the Jakob's family are on there way,OUCH,"
6443104,prov1800,2020-05-22 18:42:00,5010,Haha.we move around a lot.so not that hard on lips.if the crappies bite most we catch will end up on the livewell.If tgere not biting will try some walleye and pike.
6443826,prov1800,2020-05-25 08:12:00,5010,Did a solo trip on Cliff yesterday.beautifull weather and lake was like glass.Tried trout most of morning but only had 2 strikes and lost bith of them.Had around another dozen lakers chasing my lure but thats all they did so no trout.Tried for walleyes and could see them but tgey didnt want to bite either.tried all kinds of techniques.But of course the smallies bit on everything and saved the day.Tried several spots and caught a lot of smallies.everytime id hook one a dozen would be chasing it.Managed a couple of pike also so it turned out to be a fun day.
6443860,lassh,2020-05-25 10:45:00,553,Very nice John. You're living the dream.
