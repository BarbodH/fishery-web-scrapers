6441566,ogilville,2020-05-20 05:52:00,262,"I agree Billy, I have been going to the same lake and lodge since 1986. After they changed the limit and a few years with a slot size limit our fishing has gotten much better. We too tend to catch more fish and the average size is larger. We eat fish every day and bring home our 4 fish each. My June trip has been cancelled but still holding out hope for a late July trip we have scheduled. Monty"
6441610,MrSimon,2020-05-20 07:23:00,922,"Over-harvest in my opinion is WAY WAY worse for a lake than heavy fishing pressure. So having a one-season break from pressure AND harvest will obviously help all lakes .... but it won't really make a lasting difference on lakes where the over-harvest starts right back up next year. Regarding bass and walleye ... it's just my personal experience, but the best five walleye lakes I've ever fished don't have bass. And the top five bass lakes I've ever fished have poor and declining walleye populations. Just my experience, but I think there is at least somewhat of a correlation. Other factors are definitely involved though."
6441628,Lmbkiller,2020-05-20 07:51:00,639,"One thing is certain, I doubt many people on this forum go to Ontario for the great bass fishing"
6437404,valley366,2020-05-12 10:12:00,193,They really got detailed on areas and limits in zone 5.https://www.ontario.ca/document/onta...agement-zone-5
6437416,prov1800,2020-05-12 10:50:00,5010,It is what it is.I find more and mo≈ïe most guys really not interested in taking fish home.Have also heard the fish they did take never got used up.So if i have a couple of guests with me and they eat 24 walleyes during there week and dont takeca limit back thats 8 fish more in the lake.Adds up to a lot of fish on lets say Eagle over the season.
6440852,billy weaver,2020-05-18 17:13:00,470,"I have been fishing a lake in the Perrault Falls area for over 30 years. I have been going to the same camp at the same time every year. I will tell you the fishing is better now than it was in the 90s. The reason I believe is the limits have been reduced and promoting ""catch and release"". The average size is bigger by far. I realize I know the lake a lot better but the first timers in our group have better luck without a lot of help other than marking a map for them. If I was going to do one thing to help fishing I would make the limit two fish per day. You could do this by reducing the cost of a conservation license more than it is now. The camp I go to promotes ""catch and release"" with a drawing at the end of the season for a free trip. Maybe the guests wouldn't catch so many if they didn't have a guide to put them on fish. (just kidding). This year my 32 consecutive year run will be broken (June). I would consider a late August or early September trip if it can be arranged. Here is hoping. Billy"
6440956,tv4fish,2020-05-19 05:48:00,2694,"I agree Billy. My group has been fishing Lac Seul since 1985. We have hit basically the same areas on Lac Seul for all these years. When the protected slot limit was introduced (18""-21""), it did take a few years, but we could see a noticeable improvement in the size of the fish we were catching. I also think that this ""break"" on the fishing pressure will help improve the fishing slightly in the years to come - after all - there WILL be more fish still available and more to continue to reproduce........"
6440988,Bill Krejca,2020-05-19 07:04:00,6107,"As a young lad, I especially remember the time on LOW following WWII. Most of the male population had been involved in the war effort and did little fishing. U.S. fishermen were either in the services or could not get to the fishing waters due to gas and tire rationing. Following an exodus for 4-5 years, the fishing after was an incredible dream, simply unbelievable to those who were not there. This year, the absence of bunches of fishermen for this quite-a-bit-shorter duration (Hopefully), should result in a more productive spawn, for fish like crappie and walleye. As John remarked, probably no massive difference will be perceived for a few years. Bill"
6441284,v-bay gord,2020-05-19 18:05:00,3168,"That's an interesting scenario...glad you had a chance to experience it. A one year hiatus can only improve things. Bass will not be pulled off their spawning beds this year. Weed-beds might remain intact longer without daily musky anglers ripping them up. Birds / mammals will adapt to a new environment with fewer humans. More spawning age walleye will make it through the season to reproduce. Heck, maybe we should do this more often!"
6441290,Eckohlt,2020-05-19 18:15:00,3685,Ya let's do this more often but let's do it from November to may I'm in
6441304,Lmbkiller,2020-05-19 19:26:00,639,"Bass are way overabundant at this latitude now. Not sure why anyone including resort owners would want this. Don't believe me, talk to anyone that used to fish walleyes on mille lacs, key point being used too"
6441310,v-bay gord,2020-05-19 19:43:00,3168,"Well, I'm not so sure. Eagle was stocked in the 30's, as were most lakes in the NW. I've been fishing the lake since the late 70's and the population of bass seems to be static to this day. Some trophy fish but they are not a primary species. Perhaps it's the musky or other predators that mille lacs doesn't have.....not sure on that one. As far as being a camp owner having multiple species to fish for is exciting and good for business. I have multiple groups from the south that love to target bass in early June. After that bass are not a usual catch....I don't see any till maybe in the fall. So overabundant might apply to your situation, but not here."
6441540,tv4fish,2020-05-20 05:01:00,2694,"This is just a FYI: I live on the north shore of Lake Mille Lacs and the fishing regs. for Mille Lacs this year only allow ""catch and release"" (NO keeping of any walleyes this year due to over harvesting this past Winter from ice fishing). To show the impact of COVID-19 (and the fact that hardly anyone is working) -- there were probably just as many boats out fishing on walleye opener (May 9th) this year as there used to be ""back in the day"". We had not seen that many boats out there for at least 5 years. Mille Lacs DOES now have an abundance of smallmouth bass and we do also have muskies."
6436588,johnboat,2020-05-10 21:21:00,2014,"With a large percentage of US fisherman cancelling their trips, Canadian camps not opening this year, and tourist not being able to cross the border, obviously the numbers of walleyes being harvested will be at a low from many years prior.What numbers of fish NOT harvested from Ontario alone would be a good guess and how many years will it be when there is a noticeable population expolosion?Assuming half of the season is shot."
6436620,ProFishingGuide,2020-05-10 22:15:00,6,"I was thinking about this the other day. My parents have run a fly-in lodge since 1997. First year they went with a selective harvest catch and consume. No walleyes kept over 18"", no limits brought home - keep what you want to eat for shore lunch. In my time guiding up there, we'd bring in 4-6 walleyes a day a boat for lunch. I'd say the average guest ate two walleyes a day. Average trip length was 4 days. Average season was about 300 guests. That's 2,400 slot walleyes that won't get eaten this season. Guides also eat walleye at shore lunch - that's easily another 500 walleyes. Throw in a few staff fish fries we are easily looking at 3,000 walleyes uneaten during the 2020 summer. These shore lunch numbers may seem pretty big, but I think there will be bigger influences at play due to the lack of fishermen on Shikag. The bass aren't going to get pounded while they're spawning. The northerns will get free predatory range. The big walleye spots will be untouched. The pressure is off the fish completely in 2020. That's something the lake hasn't seen in at least 60 years. I'd like to take a few months off of real work in 2021, get a canadian work visa and guide again for the 2021 season. It's not like these fish weren't hungry before, but a sure bet is that they'll be hungrier in 21 than they were in 19. (You know the week before you get up there )."
6436992,prov1800,2020-05-11 14:07:00,5010,Definatly will be a plus for the fish population but you won't see any results from it for years as our walleyes grow slow.If the fall season would not happen the amount of fish that would be safe from fisherman that fish to deep would have a bigger impact on tge sizeable fish allready there.Fall time is the worst mortality rate of the season.Unfortunately i see a lot of boats fishing in places way to deep.
6437010,Guest,2020-05-11 14:47:00,0,"I would make a guess with all the resorts and lodges on Eagle plus the cabins and cottage owners not harvesting walleyes on Eagle that the number of Walleye not harvested could be over 100,000? Let's say a very big resort on Eagle has 1,000 guests a year ( yes there are resorts there that get that many, one used to get 3,000 before the new owners cut back). A rough outlook and a fun guess on how good next year could be! 4 fish limit to take home. Plus 2 walleyes per day for shorelunch times 6 days= 16 walleyes per fisher-person. Plus guides everyday on the water. Now they all don't eat that many or take them home but it's an example of how many more fish could be swimming in Eagle if the season doesn't happen this summer. And those Muskie would have all those extra walleyes to eat and could put on some girth! You think the ministry would increase our bag limit for the next year? Nah! You think the fish would become more stupid on what a jig and minnow are? Nah! Good luck hope we can get there this summer but I don't think so. Our lodge owner says he's open but not sure we can get there."
6437036,prov1800,2020-05-11 16:04:00,5010,"With the new rule last year on eagle the guests i had ,had a tough time taking 4 walleyes home.They wanted a shorelunch each day.so each day they had there 2 alotted fish each they could keep for the day.So cant keep any more that day as you have caught your legal posesion .next day and the next day,etc kept having shorelunch so end of week no take homes.So that new rule itself will add more fish to the population in itself."
6437056,kzoofisher,2020-05-11 17:18:00,5144,A one year blip is unlikely to have long term effects. Another thing to consider. If this year does have a strong impact on any lake it's safe to assume that lake is being seriously over fished.
6437100,RichA$1970,2020-05-11 19:38:00,1159,"I agree on 1 year should not make much of a difference, but good post to kill time until the liberals open things up as I really do t need them telling me how to live"
6437114,sagecreek,2020-05-11 20:10:00,24,"prov 1800, what new rule on eagle lake are you talking about?"
6437248,Mrxlh,2020-05-12 06:04:00,210,"Sage, the new rule in Zone 5 is 2 walleye per day, S or C license, the S license is still 4 total."
6437258,prov1800,2020-05-12 06:21:00,5010,That new rule is for non resident fisherman only.
