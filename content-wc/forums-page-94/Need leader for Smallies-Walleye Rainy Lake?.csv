6444984,Bill Krejca,2020-05-27 19:08:00,6107,"If pike are fairly common, I use a small short wire leader which I make myself, just thin uncoated wire, swivel and snap. I don't feel I lose much action/scare the fish away. Bill"
6444986,PA troutguy,2020-05-27 19:09:00,58,I used to use steel leader I have switched to 40 or 60 pound fluoro. I am not sure if it reduces the bite. I have caught pike on 4 inch grubs and small crank baits when fishing for smallies. Just my opinion. If I am chasing pike I still use a wire leader sometimes I will pick up a smallie.
6445006,martinbns,2020-05-27 20:00:00,1520,"I catch pike all the time while fishing for smallies in LOTW, I use a 3-4' flouro 10lb test leader over power pro. Get bit off occasionally but not enough to use a steel leader."
6445066,Aspencreek,2020-05-27 21:02:00,2911,"I fish Lac Seul, but don't use leader material. I get bit off all the time by Pike, but not enough to concern myself with losing a few jigs or spinner rigs. It's the cost of doing business in those waters."
6445152,BornToFish,2020-05-28 07:24:00,1224,"Greetings, We use a lot of jigs while fishing for walleyes. My main line is always tied to a Spro #10 swivel to minimize line twist when vertical jigging. I have a piece of six pound Vanish fluorocarbon about eighteen inches long between the swivel and the jig. I have long believed that less is more when it comes to terminal tackle used to target walleyes. Thus, I don't use leaders or snap swivels to attach my lures. I always directly tie to the jig. I typically do not fish in pike-rich locations such as within weeds. Nevertheless, bite-offs do happen from time to time. As Aspen mentioned, I view bite-offs as being the price of doing walleye business. I make and paint my own jigs, thus my jigs are relatively inexpensive. I am not concerned about my wife and I losing a dozen jigs over the course of a week's vacation. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6445192,MrSimon,2020-05-28 09:02:00,922,"If I'm targeting walleye with a jig, I use as light a line I can with no extra snaps, swivels, or leaders. That stuff absolutely cuts down on bites. If I'm casting spoons, spinners, cranks etc anywhere near pike, I put on a thin black steel leader. You never know when a giant is gonna hit, and I don't want to lose it!"
