6443526,78dave,2020-05-24 04:41:00,53,My first fly in with the wife we had everything weighed to the ounce. Our load was spot on. Got to the dock and the evening before we were to depart that next day and a plane had just come in and off-loaded people and gear. The outfitter said you want to go now and of course we said yes. We backed up the car and loaded our well weighed bags of food and gear and the guy said through it all in so all our extra stuff went in with a new hot water heater for another cabin. Weight was totally cast aside. Got to the cabin and the guys befor us left two pounds of butter - yes that was awesome. Upon retrun we realized we packed about 80% more stuff than we needed.

6439984,rockpt,2020-05-16 20:15:00,589,"Packing for three seasons is spot on. I've taken many people on their first Canadian fishing trip and regardless of what I tell them about the unpredictable weather, the first timers are never prepared. And for cold weather fishing, have a system to keep your hands dry. From a thread on here from about 12 years ago or so, I learned to use the latex surgical gloves. I think the black nitrile mechanic's gloves might work even better."
6440788,MrSimon,2020-05-18 14:00:00,922,"Cool post! I loved the ""Ditch the Maybes"" section, it's so true! For me personally I do something similar called ""pick one maybe"". I always have tons of ideas, like fly-fishing for pike, taking awesome drone videos, fishing at night, trolling deep for lakers etc. All these ""maybes"" take a lot of gear and they hardly ever happen. Now I just pick one, take the appropriate gear, and then make it happen."
6440806,gmattbruin,2020-05-18 14:51:00,174,"Learning the concept of ""pacing yourself' and all you do on a 7day fly-in trip.Its so darn easy to wanna eat too much, drink too much, fish too much, tell every joke and story....too much. All on the 1st dayIve lost count of how many trips our group has been on now, but i know we have all learned to pace ourselves1 bottle of caribou at a time now, no more greasy bacon, peameal on the bbq or healthy cereal and yoghurt is the go to breakfast to give us a better start to each day, instead of mad rushes to the outhouse before we even get in the boat.We love this trip so much, we are all like kids on the trip to the cottage....ya wanna do everything all at once.Age has given us the patience to pace"

6440932,LoDo,2020-05-18 22:17:00,721,"THIS!! Our group has been doing this trip for 10+ yrs. Individually with family for longer. We bought 9acres together and building camp. Our first few yrs, we partied. I mean, we fished, but f'ing partied. Today, its an investment. Its the same trip, but better... hope that makes sense. Tight lines!!"
