6440994,Bill Krejca,2020-05-19 07:12:00,6107,"The first picture with the bass is a familiar landmark, I think. Seems like you can sit there most of the day and get a variety of the different species in the lake. I never got any huge fish right there, however. An abundance of bottom jig grabbers, right there, also! Nice looking bunch of fish in the pictures, however! Bill"
6441006,prov1800,2020-05-19 07:28:00,5010,"Thx Bill.Its amazing the amount of bass we caught that shallow and i looked at that picture again and think it was in that narrow opening behind the small shorelunch opening across from nuns island.going in toward 4 oclock bay.I could be wrong.Sometimes i forget where ive been.lol.Today no fishing.Need some supplies,its our dump day to.and a couple of little projects around to house.Also a very windy few daýs in forecast.Yesterday already on Cliff we had 30 km winds."

6440532,BornToFish,2020-05-18 05:03:00,1224,"Greetings, I wonder as to how long it has been since there wasn't a parade of boats on Ord River on opening day of the open water season? I recall seasons when it seemed as though every boat from every lodge on Perrault Lake and Cedar Lake was fishing on Ord River. Kindest regards...."
6440536,pjshorthorn,2020-05-18 05:09:00,5654,Everyone in my tribe at home and their's are doing well. Let your wife know I'll need a good haircut when I can get back north Be safe dude. PjShorthorn

6440680,BornToFish,2020-05-18 09:29:00,1224,"Greetings, ProV: I know exactly what you mean about fishing Ord River on opening week - especially if it's a high water or late spring type of season. The boat traffic there can be daunting - almost like bumper boats. I like to catch fish as much as any other angler, but there is more to the Canada experience. I fished Ord River one time in the spring and that was enough for me! I'm glad that I did it once - and only once. I found plenty of other places to fish opening week that were more to my liking. Ecko: I know what you mean. It would be nice to be on the water right now and bending some fishing rods. I have already canceled two trips to Ontario this year - ice fishing for lake trout and this (opening) week. My next trip is the week spanning June and July. I give that trip a 50/50 chance. I sense that all will depend on whether the virus situation continues to improve over the next month or if it blows back up. Better times are ahead for all, we just don't know right now as to when those times will return. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6440752,Eckohlt,2020-05-18 12:03:00,3685,"If I was 30 yrs old I wouldn't mind so much if I lost a cpl of trips,but when your in your 60 n 70 range you don't know how trips are left in ya,not much we can do about it,takecare n stay safe,rod"
6440862,Da' Walleye Assassun,2020-05-18 17:47:00,358,Life is like a roll of toliet paper. The closer to the end you get the faster it goes.
6440006,prov1800,2020-05-16 21:20:00,5010,I drove over to clarks northern lights this morning normally i would be guiding but not today.So instead i got to take my wife out instead which is allright to.Very quite at camp.only a couple of planes by dock and one boat in the water.Strange feeling in camp.whow.Grabbed some minnows and drove along the empty cabins.Unloaded the boat and took off.The good part is the fishing was great.water temp 45 f and toward end of our day it was 52 f.coolish day with walleyes in about 5-7 ft.Very light bite for the most.Few perch and some shallow bass and pike.Every spot we fished had great action.So open day for fishing was great.will go tomorrow agaim and go to east end.Today i was low on fuel.lol.
6440032,pjshorthorn,2020-05-17 04:32:00,5654,"What a nice way to spend opening day regardless of the current circumstances. I do have to say your post bummed me out a bit since I was supposed to be fishing Eagle Lake yesterday on opener.....LOL. Oh well, we are all safe right now and that is all that really matters. There will be other openers and day trips to Zizania in the future.....I just might be a touch slower getting in and out of the boat Hope you and yours are doing well. PjShorthorn"
6440046,Eckohlt,2020-05-17 04:51:00,3685,"John I didn't see you in the pictures,but the gal looks like she really can slay the eyes,she sure doesn't need no guide,right now we can only dream"
6440056,BornToFish,2020-05-17 06:09:00,1224,"Greetings,PJ: I noticed that you brought up the name of Zizania Lake. That lake brings back some fabulous memories!My first trip to Zizania was was on a cold day in late September 2002. We left the dock and headed to ""gull rock"" in the middle of the lake. My friend was running the motor, while I was sitting near the bow. He told me to ""bait up"" on the ride out, so I did. I dropped in my jig as the boat slowed and immediately hooked up with a 25 incher. As I was bringing my fish to the boat, he baited his jig and dropped it into the lake. He immediately hooked up with a 30+ incher. It was like that for nearly the entire day!I made around 10-12 trips to Zizania Lake in the following years. Our standard routine was to take about twelve dozen minnows with us to start the day, and then switch to crawlers or leeches. On my wife's first trip, she had a walleye shake off the minnow at the side of the boat. I told her to grab that minnow before it sank. She had a look of disbelief on her face. I then said that she would need that minnow before lunch. She became a believer that day.We had numerous contests while fishing on Zizania Lake. One such contest was the number of walleyes that could be caught on the same leech. I won that contest with thirteen walleyes. Ironically, I lost that leech to a weed. We also had contests as to who could catch a walleyes on the most unusually bait. The winners were things such as a cigarette butt and a piece of Walmart bag.Like all good things, my trips to Zizania Lake came to an end. But, we still have those memories!Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6440060,prov1800,2020-05-17 06:31:00,5010,Hope every thing is good PJ.Little different here but it is what it is.
6440064,pjshorthorn,2020-05-17 06:55:00,5654,"Great story. The fishing on Zizania can be Insania....LOL. Last year we flew in for the day and we never made it more than a third of the way around the lake....fishing was that good. We spent some time fishing the bays at the end of the lake looking for northerns and once we found them it was game on !!!! I think our best that day was 37 with many in the mid 30s. We didn't catch the size of walleyes you did, but it was constant catching all day long on both live bait, cranks and plastics. I even had to loan Prov1800 some of my HotnTots as we invited him along and he didn't have the right color with him.....LOL. With two boats, 4 guys, we caught roughly 527 fish in 7 hours of fishing. In fact, Breezy Point landed two or three fish off the float plane dock before we could get the camp boats in the water. We may never duplicate that type of catching again. The flights in and out were awesome and on the way back we made a quick stop at Anishanabi Lodge to pick up and drop off supplies for guests there. Although we never got out of the plane, it was cool to see the lodge and put it on the list for future trips to consider. Just an wonderful experience all the way around. The boats were very nice and the oversized boat seats were amazing to the point where we were saying...hey, we need these for the boats back home. PS......tell your wife that saving a minnow is a boat requirement with me , along with any salvaged from inside a walleye's mouth !!!!! PjShorthorn"
6440068,prov1800,2020-05-17 07:09:00,5010,That was a fantastic trip.Maybe still a chance of that happening.
6440082,BornToFish,2020-05-17 07:40:00,1224,"Greetings, PJ: your stories and pictures reminded me of another fabulous memory. I was fishing near ""Gull Rock"" on Zizania Lake in late September 2003. I encountered a bite-off that was likely a northern pike. I quickly tied on a new jig and cast over to the same spot. I felt the bite and immediately set the hook, so as to hook the fish in the corner of its mouth. The battle went for a long time as I was using a light power spinning rod with six pound monofilament line on the reel. I realized this pike was in the mid-40s when I finally got it to the boat. It took many tries for my boat partner to get the pike in the piece of crap net that came with the boat. He had a huge smile on his face when he finally netted the fish. The smile didn't last long as the bottom of the net tore when he tried to lift the fish into the boat. Needless to say, the line broke when the fish fell through the net. I fished Zizania Lake many times when we just camped in one spot. That spot was often the first point on the left as we came out of the bay with the plane dock. The boat ride was no more than two minutes from the dock. My friends and I thought the fishing on Zizania Lake declined over the years that we fished it. We didn't know why as the lake was ""catch and release"" only over the years that we fished it. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6440342,Bill Krejca,2020-05-17 16:28:00,6107,"Good to see some pic's, must feel kinda strange out on the lake without at least some accompanying boats! Bill"
6440436,prov1800,2020-05-17 19:49:00,5010,Very strange Bill.Today saw 2 boats.Think from private cabins. Good today but somewhat slower.To hot and calm.Few fish here anď there.One spot real good in morning around around 30 in a hr.slowed in afternoon.We fished east end.Beautifull day.
