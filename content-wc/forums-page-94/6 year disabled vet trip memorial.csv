Wayne was a resident of Sandusky veterans home and has since passed away. My best friend (even though he was a marine) Brad Rauscher has lost his battle with cancer. He was invaluable on this trip. I received lures and miscellaneous fishing gear from 42 posters on WC. Here are the guys that I still have contacts for.. I apologize to everyone else who contributed but I lost contact info for. if you are not on this short list PLEASE send me a quick e-mail note so I can have some history for this trip.. Scott Gruns..,Rocky Richards... Jay... Larry S...Kyle and Teri...Bill Bess... Paul and Steph...Sam Harmon...Mike Saresky... Curt Main...Mark Terwell SFTPOSFABDIA (wahtever that means).... Dave and Sue.... I know a lot are missing so i am including a link to one of the reports on WC after the trip. The lures and gear that were left over I contributed to the auction at Amvets 55 for Brad Rauschers widow.. Love you guys Joe [email protected]https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=322329"
