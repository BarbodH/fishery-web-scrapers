I miss the push, the rush, the double checking, the excitement and anticipation. This morning, we would have been up early getting minnows for guests, hearing the sound of the boat motors starting, listening to the call of the loons, and waiting for the first group to come back with their catch and their stories. It is a sad day with uncertainty of not knowing. There has been a lot of stress, sleepless nights, confusion, frustration, and hope that God will help us all through this. I wish everyone the very best in health, safety, and are looking forward to being there as soon as we can. In closing, being a camp owner, meeting guests, and being there for them has been a very important part of our life. As I said earlier, today is a very hard day for us as owners. However, we want to remember those who have sacrificed, risked their own lives, and lastly lost someone close to them during these times. Hope to see you on the water soon! Bob, Sondra, and family"

6439748,That Minnesota guy,2020-05-16 06:55:00,8293,Stay strong Canada. If you resort owners can survive until the borders open the American fisherman will return. I'm praying for you and hoping you all can hang in there.
6439844,kettyspanky,2020-05-16 11:59:00,271,Sad times. I hope all of the outfitters and resort owners can make it through this. I'm sure that there are a ton of people sitting home that would love to be in Ontario fishing right now. Hang in there and hopefully we can come up there and join you all up there for some great fishing and relaxation.

I have always camped or done outposts so not too worried as I only see the owner to pay them, fly me in and pick me up. Hang in there and I am counting the days til September 10th to depart if it does open."
