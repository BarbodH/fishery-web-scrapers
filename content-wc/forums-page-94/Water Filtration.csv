6442252,Bigtaproot,2020-05-21 09:59:00,900,"Dear Friends, Hoping to go on my first fly in trip if the border opens. Wanting to keep weight down and eliminate bringing bottled water if possible. Do you guys have any advice on water filtration? I know I could just drink beer but need to watch my quarantine gut"
6442258,'Taterguy,2020-05-21 10:31:00,33,"I use an MSR MiniWorks EX Microfilter. I use a nalgene bottle that screws on the bottom of the filter. It works great and is easy to clean. The charcoal filter takes any bad taste away. The lakes we go to the outfitter says they drink water right out of the lake but the Canadian Govt requires them to tell us we should to boil the water. It tastes OK right out of the tap, but I like to filter the fish poop out. Link: https://www.msrgear.com/water-treatm...ter/56425.htmlOne other guy brings a bigger gravity flow bag. Probably weighs the same but takes longer."
6442300,MrSimon,2020-05-21 13:17:00,922,"Platypus water filtration system is fantastic! High volume, easy to use, effective. I also use one of those top-of-the-nalgene pump filters as a back-up."
6442310,vteye3,2020-05-21 13:48:00,496,I had beaver fever once upon a time when I was young an stupid an trust me nothing anyone wants. Even though we go up in the spring we still boil or treat with a filter. Beaver fever is a great way to ruin a trip.
6442318,Hewhocookstomuch,2020-05-21 13:59:00,66,"I also do not like the thought of drinking fish poop. However as vteyes3 said Beaver Fever is a greater concern. bottled, boiled water for me only. I usually boil a big pot first day in camp to save the bottle water for the boats."
6442338,kzoofisher,2020-05-21 14:37:00,5144,Second the platypus. Filter 1.5-2 gallons in a few minutes. If the water is really dirty it should go through some sort of prefilter to keep the speed up. Filter will last 10-12 days for 5 guys with clear water going in. You can get a carbon filter for it too if taste is a worry.
6442842,Bigtaproot,2020-05-22 05:32:00,900,Thank you for the help on the water filtration. I am always impressed with her knowledge on this board and find it very helpful
6442854,andreindy,2020-05-22 06:21:00,308,"The Platypus is one of the most practical and impactful tools we brought to our fly in. They are a little pricey (we got the bigger one), but you recover that value almost immediately in how convenient it makes life at camp. No boiling, waiting, etc, etc. I would buy it 10 times over. It filters gallons in minutes. Sometimes it slows down and you simply need to backflush the filter. The other ""convenience"" game changer is we bought a big collapsable water container to store the filtered water in that has a spigot. Less than $15 and weighs a few ounces. Something like this. https://www.amazon.com/WaterStorageC...s%2C158&sr=8-5"
6442882,prov1800,2020-05-22 07:29:00,5010,Not sure who you are flying out with but Clarks resorts bring in bottled water to there outposts so weight isnt a issue and shouldnt be if outfitter doesnt have drinkable water available.Ive been on moose hunts where we boiled water and had containers to store it.Wasnt a problem.kinda added to the hunt
6442888,jambi,2020-05-22 07:34:00,504,"Great idea, thanks"
