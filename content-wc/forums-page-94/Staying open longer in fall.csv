6438610,mms3rd,2020-05-14 13:26:00,148,"Before falling in love with Canada, we did all of our fishing in northern MN and went at the end of May before MN schools let out....same thing in fall when kids go back to school. Often spring/fall specials and a lot less pressure. I don't need any specials now, just a lake. I raise this only for those groups who travel with kids and whether a late trip is feasible. Even if schools aren't open, I assume there will be book learning to do----just stay in a place with reliable wi-fi?"
6439902,mixedbag,2020-05-16 17:14:00,76,"Its a pipe dream to think the border will open to tourism in the short term. Up here we generally pay attention to scientists and in my home province theres been no new cases for 5 straight days. We look at the state of affairs south of the border and shake our heads in disbelief. And, you guys are opening up???? And you guys wanna come up here???? The average Canadian does not want to see a cascade of Americans crossing into the country until there is accurate real time testing of every person crossing. Weve given up so much over the last couple of months doing things right that until you get your act together we wont risk border openings. The consequences of opening the border too early are too dire to support the risk."
6439922,fsz,2020-05-16 18:05:00,144,Americans come to Canada late spring thru early fall for fishing and hunting. Canadians come to the US late fall they early spring to warm weather areas. 75% of Canadian exports come to the US. Conclusion- our relationship is not one sided- both countries benefit by respecting each other's differences. Labels like âyou guysâ....doesn't help. Our respective governments need to cooperate on the reopening. If we can't do that then the paradigm of Our relationship will change for the worse. # no bashing
6439930,That Minnesota guy,2020-05-16 18:14:00,8293,This American agrees. We can fish and if need be hunt in the states this year. It's fish vs lives we are talking about after all.
6440920,v-bay gord,2020-05-18 20:58:00,3168,"All true. We are talking about a few months of sacrifice. For some business's that might be too much, but the risk needs to be minimized. As a business owner I need to feel confident that the health of my guests, and my community are not compromised. Hopefully something will be in place to help struggling business's."
6441694,emma17,2020-05-20 09:13:00,436,Well said Fsz- terrific respect and tolerance on your part to a powder keg post.
6441846,v-bay gord,2020-05-20 15:00:00,3168,"If by a powder keg post the use of ""you guys"" was inappropriate I suggest the revision ""you guys and gals""....not that's much more polite and what I would expect from a fellow Canadian. By the way, how the border is opened should be a collaborative endeavor. The decision to open the border is solely the decision of a sovereign nation."
6441892,mms3rd,2020-05-20 17:29:00,148,"These are not supposed to be ""political"" posts I thought. I don't care if ""it's you guys, girls and rabbits,"" I have no control over what the ""leaders"" of this country do....no one appointed me to make any decisions....sadly. That said, I already indicated that I would keep Americans out for the foreseeable future....but not because of what ""this guy"" did."
6442254,emma17,2020-05-21 10:18:00,436,"As usual you cherry pick to make a weak point. The entire context of the post is negative, highlighted by ..until you get your act together..."
6437514,rockpt,2020-05-12 13:18:00,589,"Ditto on the cold, snow and freezing temps in October. I think it was early October 2006 when the snowstorm came through and we were stranded in camp for three days and the pipes froze. But you can also get some beautiful Indian summer days and the fishing can be outstanding. It's my favorite time of the year to be in Canada."

6438384,Bill Krejca,2020-05-14 07:34:00,6107,"Hi John, Yeah,I remember a number of camping trips in the 1980's and 90's to LOW in late Sep, early Oct, and had sleet, relatively heavy snow, miserable wind, all around very poor weather. Fishing, however, was excellent. The last few years seems to have mellowed out somewhat, although, as stated, the wind now seems to blow every day everywhere, almost regardless of the season. Bill"
6438434,prov1800,2020-05-14 08:15:00,5010,It suŕe does.Fishing Eagle and Lac suel you really notice it more than you would on Cedar.Many places to hide and even running the lake there is never that bad as the big lakes.The beauty of being a rogue guide is i càn go where i please on those bad days and my guests dont really care.Ill be on Cedar on Saturday with my wife for the opener.Weather is looking great with a high of 18-20c and 9-12 km winds.About as perfect as it comes.
6438448,Golden Eagle,2020-05-14 08:46:00,2642,"Good for you. My streak of consecutive openers on the same lake in NW Ontario began in 1984. Until 2020, my only miss was in 2017 when my wife had health issues. If I could slip across the border, I'd be fishing for pike Friday and eating a walleye dinner Saturday. Would be keeping a nice 26"" pike for Friday's meal."
6438492,prov1800,2020-05-14 09:41:00,5010,I feel bad for all of you guys that cant make it up here at this time.Hopefully at some time soon you guys you will be able to get up here and get your canada fix.
6438542,Golden Eagle,2020-05-14 11:11:00,2642,"Thanks, but I haven't been cheated and won't be in future years. Will catch up, expecting to start July 18."
6438572,prov1800,2020-05-14 12:14:00,5010,Golden thats where iam putting my money on.Our MPP from Kenora said 2 months so that about is in the ball park.Allthough that would be after Ontario opens up and all the essential businesses would have to be open to except US business at the camps.Theres hope.
6438584,Eckohlt,2020-05-14 12:26:00,3685,Golden hope your right on
6437212,Eckohlt,2020-05-12 05:16:00,3685,"Let's say the borders open mid July or start of aug,is it possible the resorts and lodges and fly in operators would stay open longer in the fall if there is a demand for business,I realize the weather can play an important roll also,for me I probably will lose 2 early trip so I'm gearing up for fall to make up for the lost trip"
6437224,That Minnesota guy,2020-05-12 05:31:00,8293,"You will be better served to gear up for 2021. It's a labor driven, weather driven business. When the weather turns and the help leaves so does the business. There will be a handful of camps that do Bear hunts and stuff but I imagine they will be full."
6437246,BornToFish,2020-05-12 06:03:00,1224,"Greetings, I have known a handful of lodge operators over the years. They all have said the same thing regarding closing during the autumn. Even though they might want to stay open an extra week or two in autumn, it just isn't worth the grief that comes with being open during cold weather. Consider water lines for example. The black poly water lines are typically laying above ground, or maybe buried a few inches. It just gets to be a hassle thawing frozen water lines, fittings and valves throughout their camp every morning, knowing it will happen again the next morning. I expect that some lodge owners will extend their season an extra week or two (assuming demand warrants it) to offset lost revenue from the spring, but they know in advance their will be some grief ahead of them to do so. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6437254,prov1800,2020-05-12 06:13:00,5010,I fish well into fall and do have some guys come up. Besides some cooler weather the fishing can be very good and well worth it if you need a fishing fix.Mostly see muskie fisherman at that time of the year.There is a fair number of camps open and i would say there is always a opening.As mn guy said there could be bear hunters in camps but not every camp has a bear area.Also could have moose hunters.Most camps shut down through sept.Flyouts will also start closing earlier as water pipes could freeze depending on weather.But Sept is a awesome month of fishing with some beautifull weather and no bugs.October can be iffy vut doable
6437274,Bill Krejca,2020-05-12 06:41:00,6107,"I had raised the same question several weeks ago and the post was removed, hum..! ............................. It's OK.Yeah, as said, it seems like the main potential problems would be freezing water lines and availability of help, with younger help going back to school. I do wonder if maybe the season has shifted a little, and it is somewhat warmer than it was some years back. Also a number of camps stay open for hunters, so perhaps they'd be there anyway.Bill"
6437286,prov1800,2020-05-12 07:00:00,5010,Morning Bill.fall weather seems to be warmer lately.Moose hunts are in first week of Oct and seems like some nice sunny days in those first 2 weeks.Ive guided moose hunters at a number if camps and of course some cooler evenings have frozen water lines as most are not buried. Have let water dripple through the night.lol.always have water available in mornings.during day pipes thaw out.lol.It all adds to the adventure.Always take off in tge boat with hunting and fishing gear.Have had to take off the heavy clothing during the day many times.Its a great time but some days can be ugly to.lol.
6437452,martinbns,2020-05-12 11:41:00,1520,In NW Ont Sept is usually nice but Oct can be nasty. The last 4 season it's been so windy fishing has hard to do at all. The last two years my last outing was right around our thanksgiving and both times it was my last time out because it was actually scary. Keep in mind I work and live two hours from Kenora so I can't just get up and go on a nice day.
6437464,prov1800,2020-05-12 12:00:00,5010,I aģree with the wind.i find it windier lately all year.Iam close so i can pick nice days for myself but when i have guide dates i got to go.Fish lots on Eagle and Lac Suel and yes there are many days on either lake i actually put a life jacket on.Fall winds make it feel a lot colder than it really is
6437480,Eckohlt,2020-05-12 12:29:00,3685,"October throw the ice fishing clothes on,shovel the snow out of the boat,saddle up ride out on the lake and go get'e'm,it's between me and the fish,I love that time of year"
6437510,prov1800,2020-05-12 13:11:00,5010,Yeah but your tough.lol.
