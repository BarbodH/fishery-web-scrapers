Canada wants another 30 days and US will most likely agree. So we should get a new Jun 21 date soon. This is just the next line in the sand so to speak. It also says the hard debate on opening will come next month as views between the two countries are less likely to align.[/QUOTE] Yes, this is the next update/decision point in the process keeping border closed. That is easy to keep the status quo given current situation. No mention of opening criteria or discussions so that will likely happen after June 21 given how things have developed so far. As you stated that is the hard part of the issue that needs to be tackled. The next thing to look for is mention of opening discussions and negotiations between the two countries. Until that happens status quo."
6437828,Hookhunter135,2020-05-13 09:30:00,129,I hope an agreement can happen soon. The outdoor financial resources that are shared between the two countries is so significant. To cut the throat of that industry for a season could be devastating.

The per capita rate of infection is a lot higher south of the border than north. In NY State it is almost 10 times higher. Who thinks it's logical that we are still locked up in Ontario but we're going to open the border soon to NY state with 10 times the infection rate? ........................link deleted."

6437278,kettyspanky,2020-05-12 06:47:00,271,I talked with the resort owner that we go to yesterday. He is still stuck in Wisconsin yet but claims he will be able to cross the border June 1st. I hope he is right. He has a couple helpers up there and they are pretty much ready for the summer. We are scheduled for the last week of July. Hopefully things will straighten out by then. Wishful thinking.
6437288,78dave,2020-05-12 07:02:00,53,Take a look at Kenora's tourism board and their reluctance for people to come to the area. Remember Winnipeg is just next door and they don't want those folks or anyone from Ontario coming to the area. Hard to believe in regard to tourism $ but being smart and safe lead the charge.

My opinion is things won't open up soon and with the big push to open up businesses in the states, even though they haven't made the guidelines set, ie: downward trend of cases for 14 consecutive days, i think the numbers will climb again and our friends to the north may not open up to us at all this year if this happens. I hope I'm wrong but time will tell."
