5981346,Cheeky44,2018-02-02 19:20:00,1,"Hi everyone, I'm new to the board long time lurker. I can chime in on this one I've fished it twice over the last 5 years. Walleye action is steady a day on the water targeting eyes should produce 50 per day per angler. Fishing is easy especially in the areas with current. Walleye are in the 16-20 range up too 28 for my pb. Perch fishing is surprisingly good considering the amount of 30+ pike swimming around. The brook trout fishing isn't crazy numbers but decent size, 10 being the smallest 16 being the biggest but I didn't spend a long time targeting them. I wasn't aware this camp has a new owner but I plan on going back, it's a good bang for the buck."

5993089,Pymbet,2018-02-09 10:58:00,42,"In 1991, as a prelude to our fly-in fishing trip, we canoed the section of the Little Current River from O-Sullivan through Superb to Percy. We caught fish off and on throughout the entire Little Current, mainly just by pulling a crawler harness or Hot-n-Tot while paddling. Caught plenty to eat for dinner without really trying. Everything we caught was either a walleye or a pike and we did not go after Brookies although there was much good looking water. I remember pulling into the camp on Two Mile Lake on our second night and camping outside the cabin (no one was there).We did this in early August and the water level in the Little Current was low. Lots of lining small rapids and several portages. I am not sure how far up or down you can motor in August and there is a significant falls (I think it is called Irene Falls) downstream a ways from your camp that will be the definite end of motoring. Its pretty to take a look at if you can. We ran some water we probably shouldn't have attempted on that trip and took a spill in one where I lost my entire tackle box (why I brought the whole thing, I'll never know). We learned a lot on that trip including: 1) Ontario Rivers don't look much like the Pere Marquette in Michigan where I grew up or even the more challenging rivers in Virginia where I lived for several years, and 2) know what type of canoe you are going to be renting from the outfitters in Nakina before you show up. They gave us one decent-sized one and one about 15 feet long with not much draft. Both were aluminum which I hate. The small one was brand new when we took it and was pretty dented and had a nice crease when we returned it. It nearly folded like a taco while pinned to the side of a rock in a rapids we were wading. We didn't rent it from Leuenbergers and I remember Malcolm's look when he came to pick it up and fly it out. He was the one who had to take it back to the guy who rented it to us.To this day we laugh about that trip. What a bunch of rookies we were. We brought so many extras (a large cooler full of beer) and still ran out of food by the third night (we thought it would only take two). We straggled into the Percy Lake camp a day late and looking whipped and met our buddy's, who flew right in three days earlier and were wondering if we'd met our end."
6339474,Mike1201,2019-07-10 17:46:00,2,Hello. Thinking about a trip to two Mile for next June. Any chance thoughts as to what to expect during the third week of June? Will weed beds have grown by then? There appears to be falls at the lower end of the lake. Any at the upper end? Thanks. Mike1201
6340210,"6'3""",2019-07-12 20:03:00,47,We fished 2 mile last year. It was the last week of May. Jason is a straight shooter. There are falls/rapids on the upper end and that is where we caught the most walleyes. Nice sized fish. We caught fish all over the lake trolling body baits too. I recommend
6341102,Mike1201,2019-07-15 16:36:00,2,Thanks for the info.
6440230,AndyT,2020-05-17 12:11:00,3,I am heading there end of July. The only walleye fishing I do is on Lake Erie with heavier gear running dypsy divers. Has any one ever tried that method there or is it to shallow?
