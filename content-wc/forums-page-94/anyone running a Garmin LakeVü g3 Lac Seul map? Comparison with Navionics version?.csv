I currently have a Navionics chip which is ok- but wondering about whether to get the LakeVü chip for Lac Seul, Rainy, LOW. Thanks"
6436490,Lmbkiller,2020-05-10 17:07:00,639,It will be the same as navionics

6437150,Aspencreek,2020-05-11 21:33:00,2911,"Easy, the entire lake mapped in 1"" increments. Is that too much to ask, Oh!! and all of your best spots bookmarked too. After all, I spent all this money on this fancy new graph, you don't expect me to find them on my own do you?? That was sarcasm, for those who didn't get it."
6437270,prov1800,2020-05-12 06:30:00,5010,Haha.funny.iam satified with mine.i bought a second lowrance unit (hook 7)my old chip of 12+ years was missing a few lakes i fish.Basically no much of a difference.The map is fine and basically good enough for me.As far as rocks you can find tgem pretty easy some days when you hit one.Can be some good fishing around those rocks.lol.
6437572,thatvoodoothatyoudo,2020-05-12 17:08:00,79,Just wanted to check to see whether the lake I g3 maps show s as anymore detail than my current Navionics chip. The Most recent update shows 1’ depth variances- has anyone got that map chip and can give me any insight? This will be my 45th year fishing the eastern half of Lac Seul— I am very familiar with the lake& the rocks!! But I am trying to find more sunken islands and large sand flats.
6437706,David Anderson,2020-05-12 21:59:00,2073,"Well, I suspect that it is exactly the same as the newer Navionics map as Garmin did buy Navionics. My newer Navionics maps show the 1 foot contours with the SonarCharts live activated. If you have an updated card, it may well have some SonarChart live recordings that were downloaded however the general 1 foot increment contours are not very accurate at all, rather a simple suggestion to what it 'could"" look like if SonarCharts live was used to map the contours."
