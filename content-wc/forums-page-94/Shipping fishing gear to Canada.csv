If you confirm your trip is happening and you need to mail/ship some gear to Winnipeg you could mail it to me then pick it up. Send me a PM if interested, but need to make sure you can actually get here...grin Good luck"
6440036,skimottaret,2020-05-17 04:40:00,40,"Ahh nice, my Mrs. grew up in Wicklow... A very kind offer on the shipping. Hopefully we can get in via roads but I will keep you in mind. Cheers and tight lines !"
6440838,Tbayfisher,2020-05-18 16:28:00,31,"Trying to skirt the system to go fishing during this pandemic? Self quarantine , non essential travel. It ain't happening, period! Save your cash, and enjoy yourself when things get better, AND the borders are open."
6438290,skimottaret,2020-05-14 04:44:00,40,with the border closed to car traffic we are looking at flying into Winnipeg and renting a car to get to Red Lake. Has anyone pre shipped up their fishing gear and flown commercial with hand luggage? Or is it better value to take all gear on commercial flight and pay the airlines.. We usually drive up from Milwaukee but want to have an option to keep our hopes alive for our July trip.. Two man crew and our fly in limit is 150 lbs each.. Any ideas or links gratefully received
6438296,Eckohlt,2020-05-14 05:32:00,3685,"Myself I wouldn't have anything flown up to Canada without being along with it,let alone my fishing gear I don't use ugly sticks,that's my thoughts anyway"
6438436,prov1800,2020-05-14 08:23:00,5010,If you know car traffic is closed at the border what makes you think you can fly in to canada.
6438438,Mojo-NC,2020-05-14 08:23:00,1929,"We have flown into INL and driven across the border and into Winnipeg and gone through customs at the airport. We always carry on our electronics and check our rods and other fishing gear. If you get a credit card for the airline you are flying, you will be able to check your first bag for free. That'll save you a little money. I prefer flying to INL and driving across the border in a rental. Winnipeg is a difficult city to get out of from the airport as there is no convenient way to get out of the city without zig zagging through a bunch of downtown city streets. Either way, I don't think they will allow you to travel to Winnipeg or anywhere else in Canada from the US until the border opens officially. It is my understanding that the border is closed to all US unless it is considered essential."
6438440,LoDo,2020-05-14 08:23:00,721,"We fly with gear to Winnipeg. We've flown Amik and Adventure Air out of Winnipeg to our dock. Both will shuttle you to their hanger. Otherwise, we've driven from Winnipeg to Red Lake. Highly recommend not going through the town of Winnipeg and drive the north loop. Kenora surprisingly can take a minute going through as well. I will say, if going through Kenora to/from, be sure and stop at Lake of the Woods brewery if open. Kenora has improved significantly from 10+ years ago. If you don't have the time, by pass Kenora. You can make Red Lake in 5hrs. Pretty drive once you get into Ontario."
6438442,v-bay gord,2020-05-14 08:36:00,3168,"Conditions for foreign nationals travelling from the United States into Canada All foreign nationals (a person who is not a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident) must be aware that they may be refused entry to Canada when travelling by air from the United States. The Government of Canada has restricted non-essential travel across its border, and therefore travel that is for optional or discretionary purposes, including tourism, recreation, or entertainment purposes will not be permitted. If a foreign national travelling from the United States is denied entry into Canada, further travel arrangements will be at the traveller's expense. Good luck!"
6438484,skimottaret,2020-05-14 09:28:00,40,"Thanks all good info, although the land border is closed I'm Irish and will be flying in from Europe and info here shows I may be able to get in, but advise here is vague. All my fishing gear is in the US and just thinking of contingency plans.."
6438586,Eckohlt,2020-05-14 12:29:00,3685,Skimottaret can u whip up a good fish n chips?
6439448,martinbns,2020-05-15 17:05:00,1520,"If you can get in, you will be required to self isolate for 14 days immediately upon arrival. Won't be able to drive to Red Lake and then self isolate. The drive to Red Lake from Winnipeg is an easy 5 1/2 hours, the first 1 1/2 hours is on a four lane highway then 2 lane in Ontario. When is your trip planned for? My now deceased parents were both born in Ireland, we were they two summers ago, where in Ireland are you from?"
6439686,skimottaret,2020-05-16 02:26:00,40,"Bummer, Wasn't clear on how strict the quarantine rules are and thought driving to a destination and sitting in isolation for two weeks on an outpost camp might just about count, but doesn't sound so We are still hopeful as our fly in is mid July but trying to come up with options. I'm dual US/Irish citizen been living in UK for 30 years.. family is from Dublin area, Leopardstown area if you know it but lots of relatives in Cork, Bantry Bay and on the border in Monaghan."
