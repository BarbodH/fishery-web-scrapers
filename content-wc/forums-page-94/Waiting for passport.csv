Interesting, only took me and bro 5min with a drivers lc and birth certificate to get back into us...this is the type of bs I've been trying to tell people isn't the case, for about 12yrs. U guys believe what u want, I already know the facts, the world is flat btw"

6438328,walleyecheek,2020-05-14 06:21:00,2231,I'VE been using my passport ever since THEY said we needed one 2009 or 2010 it really doesn't matter when. I'VE had 0 issues at the border. But I'm going to take the scissors and cut mine up because Lmbkiller says i dont need it.............GET REAL !!!
6438362,rockape,2020-05-14 07:11:00,215,"I was referring to a passport card. No trouble at all over the last 5 years. And to reinforce, you DON'T NEED A PASSPORT TO GO TO CANADA AND BACK!!!!! If you are a US Citizen, the HAVE to let you back in! All of this **** about hours of hassle is BS. Call the guard shack in International Falls and the one in Fort Frances. Ask them. I did. Had a friend whose passport expired and he didn't figure that out until the day before we left. ZERO issues. You must have an extensive criminal history to get held up like that."
6438468,CI_Guy,2020-05-14 09:02:00,2118,Lmbkiller is there some way you could reconfigure the keyboard on your phone so it doesn't generate odd symbols when you use an apostrophe for contractions?

6436686,reddemon2,2020-05-11 05:28:00,255,"Entry into Canada: Canadian law requires that all persons entering Canada carry both proof of citizenship and proof of identity. A valid U.S. passport, passport card,NEXUS card, Enhanced DL or Real ID satisfies these requirements for U.S. citizens. Children under 16 need only present proof of U.S. citizenship."
6436738,walleyecheek,2020-05-11 06:25:00,2231,Is your passport a book or a card ?
6436742,Skywagon,2020-05-11 06:29:00,1106,"Let's keep to the facts. Ontario Premier Doug Ford did not say each phase was 4 weeks, he repeatedly stated that the plan is a roadmap, not a calendar. Each phase will be assessed before going on to the next phase, there is no specific time frame."

I didn't read the entire string, but I talked to customs officers in International Falls and Fort Frances. Birth certificate and drivers license is totally fine each way."
6437340,Larry S,2020-05-12 08:14:00,665,Card is great to Get In to Canada.

With a Passport No Trouble at all You Buzz right thru the border check

I rolled down all the windows in the truck, presented the ID's answered a couple of questions and entered Canada. Don't know if a Passport was required or not. I do know we needed one to get back into Minnesota."

That doesn't mean it will always be a pleasant or swift process. Twice members of our group have been detained while the border agents looked into their citizenship. The 1st time they delayed us about 45 minutes while they checked him out. He had to sit inside while we waited outside. Everyone was polite and professional with no problems besides the delay. The second time it was a 2 1/2 hour delay. This time the guy from our group was confrontational and combative, much like your response, and the border agents responded in kind. Since then the rule for our group is if you don't have a passport you drive on your own. The guy who was detained bragged for a couple months about how he wrote his senator and there would be ""**** to pay for those nazi border guards"". We know from his wife that he received a response, but since he never shared it with us I can only assume his senator didn't agree with him."

On our trip of 6 guys, three have passport renewal or applications in process and we are supposed to go June 20. I plan to call the state dept next week if they are not received and see if I can get someone on the phone and get their guidance. Back up plan at this point is to take a birth certificate and driver's license."

Available at the following states Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont and Washington. You will not require to have your birth certificate if you have an EDL. You can also use a NEXUS card or a FAST (Free and Secure Trade) card. to cross the border as a form of citizenship and ID If flying into Canada, you must have a passport."
6435030,bthomas3333,2020-05-07 15:33:00,465,I have heard getting into Canada isn't the issue. It will be coming back into the US without a passport or card.Brett
6435118,martinbns,2020-05-07 19:47:00,1520,There is zero chance of LESS restrictive border conditions any time soon going in either direction. Our Govt has taken a lot of flak over the border for maybe the first time ever in the past year. Your's attitude towards it goes without saying.
6435728,fishsammich,2020-05-09 07:54:00,169,Wife and I sent our old US passports in with our applications to renew. Check was cash by them on 3/17/20. Nothing yet.
6435740,Camoclad,2020-05-09 09:05:00,628,"Maybe so, that also means less chance of seeing any of the tourism dollars that cross the border. There are plenty of resorts in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan who won't be complaining this year, and, if the fishing is decent, for many years."
6435822,rockpt,2020-05-09 11:48:00,589,"According to this website you need a passport to enter Canada from the US only if entering by air, if by land or water you need proof of citizenship and photo ID:https://www.tripsavvy.com/americans-...canada-1481664"
6435828,walleyecheek,2020-05-09 12:12:00,2231,Well if thats the case why did i and alot of others go crazy over 10 years ago trying to get a passport to get into CANADA ??
6435832,rockpt,2020-05-09 12:18:00,589,"I did the same thing in 2009, ran out and got a passport when I heard it was needed. I guess if the border reopens soon we'll find out if a passport is really needed because a lot of us don't have a valid passport and it's going to be months for the US govt to process renewal applications."
6436084,Lmbkiller,2020-05-09 22:30:00,639,"U guys went and bought them cuz u took the bait. Next time do some extensive research.

I also checked the website and the status said processing, it's been like that for the past two weeks. The rub for me is it doesn't sound like we are going to get them anytime soon but they cashed my check two days after they received my application ."
6434474,Baseline,2020-05-06 10:26:00,3207,Here is a suggestion for everyone who has a passport. Take a photo of the passport and keep it on your phone.
6434510,mms3rd,2020-05-06 12:28:00,148,"That might be a good idea but you have to send in your existing passport, book and card, when you renew, which I did in February. But, I have no idea if I'll get new one in time for trip. I find it hard to believe that the countries will allow border crossings without the passport.... I only requested card if that speeds things up at all."
6434556,pjshorthorn,2020-05-06 13:51:00,5654,If you don't call the borders you will never know what they will require to get into Canada or back in the US once it is open for tourists. PjShorthorn
6434576,CreteHusker,2020-05-06 14:30:00,20,I called the US Customs agent in Pembina and they told me they have not heard of any directives on how to approach this situation coming from Washington as of yet. Sounds like what may work at one border crossing may not work at another or on a different day. One thing they did sound sure about is they will not rely on the fact that you crossed the border in years past.
6434636,Guest,2020-05-06 16:12:00,0,"To enter Canada at a land border crossing, all you need is proof of citizenship and proof of identity. A birth certificate and government issued photo ID, like a drivers license. Heading home the the USA over a land border port of entry, yes technically you need to provide a passport. However, I spoke directly with a US border agent in International Falls. He told me they would not deny a US citizen entry into the USA IF they can provide proof of citizenship and proof of identity. May take some more time to sort it out rather than with a passport, but you will get home."
6434638,eyecatcher1,2020-05-06 16:17:00,323,"I have never tried that, but have heard the same on Walleye Central from people who have crossed both ways with only a regular driver's license."
6434726,johnboat,2020-05-06 20:09:00,2014,2 years ago I was not sure my re newed passport would be in my possession in time for a Canada Trip. I called Fort Francis and they said I would be able to get in and back out with my EXPIRED PASSPORT. #1. Doesn't say much for the actual expiration date.#2. Old passport is usually sent in upon renewal.
6434770,Lmbkiller,2020-05-06 22:22:00,639,"Been saying it for 12yrs, u don't need a passport to get into Canada, u don't need a passport to get back into the US"
6434890,Jesse-WI,2020-05-07 08:40:00,534,we had a guy use drivers license and birth certificate and he got no hassle from either side of the border. Passports kick in when traveling via air to Canada

6434028,eyecatcher1,2020-05-05 08:19:00,323,My wife's enhanced license expired in March and mine will in a few weeks. Not sure if that will be a problem or not since we can't renew now. That's if we can even cross the border in June.
6434032,CreteHusker,2020-05-05 08:23:00,20,Even if Canada would let us in on an expired passport I'm still out of luck since the State Department has it.

Fortunately I still have my passport in hand, although I doubt if the restriction is lifted they would make an exception for expired passports. Tough situation. It's really going to suck if the border opens back up, and I don't have a valid passport to let me into Canada."
6434156,elway12,2020-05-05 13:09:00,335,"My son needed one so we literally went to our local government passport services office on March 16th - the LAST day they took applications! We turned it in and they cashed the checks on the 20th. The US Passport center says they would not be processing any applications after March 20th! When we look at the status of receiving the passport it says ""In Process"" Thus, we will wait and see when arrives. Our Canada trip is in July. Crossing fingers & toes on both having possession of the passport and the border being OPEN!!"
6434246,3M TA3,2020-05-05 18:23:00,2846,"Mine expires soon however the State of Michigan has published that expired Enhanced DL's will be automatically extended. Typically you don't need special IDs's to get into Canada but you do to get back to US. The Department of Homeland Security requirement for Real ID's has been extended to October 1, 2021. If you have gotten a new DL lately perhaps you already have a Real ID which is as good as a Passport at the Canadian Border."
6434350,pjshorthorn,2020-05-06 05:59:00,5654,"I have no solid information to back up my gut reaction on what would happen in the event ,that when the border does open, passports could not have been renewed in time. Having said that.... I think that it is very likely when the border opens back up that we will be able to use old passport information, driver licenses and/or birth certificates ( ala the old days) to gain entry to Canada and the US on the way home. The entire world has had to adjust in so many ways already that this type of issue will be just another adjustment that will be figured out ( hopefully not on the fly) with safety and security in mind. I'm not in the same position, but I do have friends who are and I can completely understand that stress is added just thinking about the what ifs when the border does open. Work on pulling together copies of birth certificates, call the border security offices for both countries and let's all hope for the best. Stay positive and strong. PjShorthorn"
