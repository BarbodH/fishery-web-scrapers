6327890,olderfart,2019-06-03 15:50:00,18,"Our outfitter takes personal checks for payment ( after getting to know us) so no need to carry a bunch of cash...take some cash, but use a credit card for any big purchase i.e. room the night before, etc. Cash for pilot tips, etc."
6327980,Aspencreek,2019-06-03 22:23:00,2911,"So for you guys that worry about taking cash, your outfitter or camp doesn't take a credit card? I used to carry cash, and then because I know I'm getting the current exchange rate on my card I use that for everything I can, and only the small purchases are done in cash. In fact the camp I go to prefers that I pay with a card because they get the monies deposited in their acct. right away, rather than having a stack of cash sitting around the camp at the end of the week waiting for them to make the trek to a bank to make a deposit......Mastercard only, no Visa or AE. Just wondering!"
6328004,Mojo-NC,2019-06-04 06:17:00,1929,"Our lodge rates are paid in $US and they do not have charge card capabilities. They are not a large operation and probably don't want to deal with paying the fees required by the charge card companies. They will accept checks but I don't write checks any more. Therefore, we bring cash. Of course, the rest of our expenses like hotel, car rental, gas, groceries, beer/liquor, and other incidentals are all charged on cards."

6443120,RichA$1970,2020-05-22 20:33:00,1159,"No way, too many variables out of your hands. Pay the deposit, bank the $ and then it takes 10 minutes to pay the balance."
6443124,bbheli,2020-05-22 20:56:00,1387,"I never pay in full in advance, that's not a good idea. Camp could go out of business, if your not able to make it even with ample notice a refund may be hard. Right now with border closing a camp does not want to refund my deposit for the group. Risky business."
6443698,rnnonmt,2020-05-24 15:45:00,992,I only pay how and what the outfitter has established in the T's & C's. I certainly wouldn't pay anything earlier than what is established. Take this year for example. Had you paid in full and not been able to go because of the border remaining closed would you expect your money back? Would the outfitter give it back? From what I read a couple weeks ago the Canadian government was recommending to not even return deposits.... to keep 100% of consumers depositis. I realize we are going through the largest depression since the 20's and certainly a majority of the outfitters are counting on all of their yearly income coming from a fishing season. I'm out a few hundred bucks in deposits which isn't going determine whether or not I survive this year. Our outfitter wouldnt return our deposits but offered to roll them over to the same week the following year. That is perfectly acceptable to me if there is still an outpost to go to......

6444864,stumcfar,2020-05-27 15:55:00,451,Had a camp in Manitoba get closed up as the owner was poaching bear and selling their parts. We lost our deposits. Glad we hadn't paid all in advance or that would have been gone too. Things happen!
6444920,Eckohlt,2020-05-27 17:30:00,3685,That guy sounds like a crook from the get go
6327048,troutwater,2019-05-31 20:47:00,299,"I was just curious if anyone pays for their entire base package(boat and cabin) up front. I can see where there would be some risk involved in case you can't make it, but it would be a nice feeling."
6327060,bearfvr13,2019-05-31 23:08:00,174,"Yes, I pay for mine up front. Usually the second I get home from my Canadian trip, I send the full amount for my next years trip or trips. I always send more than the trip/trips cost, that way I can grab shirts, hats, etc. etc. Chuck"
6327092,tv4fish,2019-06-01 05:02:00,2694,"IMHO --- There ARE too many ""variables"" involved for that to be a good idea............. I believe the norm is to pay a deposit to hold your dates for the next year prior to leaving --- to me that makes good logic -- then you have a certain time period prior to your trip where you can cancel and even get your deposit refunded. Most good resorts do not have trouble filling their cabins with customers. They usually have a ""waiting list"" ................. (provided the economy has not gone South...........)"
6327096,RichA$1970,2019-06-01 05:08:00,1159,I just make a deposit as the prices are advertised n sometimes the tax is the only variable. Last year my outfitter sold before my trip but the new owner honored the deposits. I’m booked this year for July 1 n then in August usually start calling for a September opening as a last minute trip.
6327102,Camoclad,2019-06-01 05:33:00,628,We pay the deposit and then send in a coupleof payments over the course of the year so that when we arrive we are all paid up. Has worked out well for us. Then all we pay for when we get there are groceries and bait. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
6327120,Wrktfsh,2019-06-01 06:35:00,492,I get trip insurance. Cheap. But it gives me some peace of mind that I won't lose a chunk of change in the event something happens
6327126,Freytown,2019-06-01 07:08:00,770,"I usually pay-up front the total bill when the exchange rate good. I know the rates fluctuate but if I feel I got a good one, I'll take it. $CAD moves with the price of oil, so with oil falling the $USD is strong. I trust my outfitter to refund everything but my deposit if I can't make it. Been going 9 yrs in a row to La Pointe Aux Dorés and I always get what the bank gives them. Win-win in my book....honest folks for sure. FT"
6327248,Bstar,2019-06-01 14:12:00,564,This year and two years ago we paid the good majority of our trip upfront just so we wouldn't have to carry so much cash with us. Last year we paid at the time of the trip because we went with a new outfitter.
6327798,vteye3,2019-06-03 11:40:00,496,We usually send the deposit and then based on exchange may send additional payments. I paid my trip this year about 4 months early taking advantage of the exchange rates.
6327844,Mojo-NC,2019-06-03 13:32:00,1929,"We send all in of our deposits between Thanksgiving and Christmas and then pay the balance on the afternoon before leaving to go home if we're leaving really early, or on the morning of our departure if we are not in a hurry to catch our return flights home. It works well but it does cause us all to carry a pocket full of cash to cover the outstanding portion of the bill."
