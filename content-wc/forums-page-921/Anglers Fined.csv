524105,Hammerhead Herb,2002-09-12 12:37:00,259,Good point about the exchange rate. I now use credit cards to get a more accurate and fair rate. The guy at the gas station just on the north end of Ear Falls was real indignant when I gave him my VISA; he wanted me to give him US$ and swallow his arbitrary exchange rate (about 10% less than the going rate).
524123,Andyeye,2002-09-13 05:30:00,179,"Musky Man, you sound like a good man and I also respect you for sounding off on your opinion. I could care less about which country a poacher is from, he is still a criminal in my book. Thanks for admitting you were sounding off, I do the same thing sometimes. I also agree with Canadian Guy that many game laws are broken because of ignorance,that is never an acceptable reason. Sportsmen need to put on a good public image to combat the wacko's like PETA, and the worst of the bunch the Animal Liberation Front. Musky Man ""No Harm NO Foul"""
524124,Guest,2002-09-13 09:28:00,0,In response to message 3l. Does PETA stand for People Eating Tasty Animals???
524122,phishfearme,2002-09-13 12:41:00,1242,rick - this is an excellent idea (requiring outfitters to provide regulations for their lakes) and one that our outfitters this past year (lac seul/amik) did for us but even they got it wrong telling us slot limit was in effect when there was none. a private cabin owner (from MN) on the lake corrected us and we corrected the outfitter. the rules get more and more complex every year.thanks for the good ideaphish
524096,Guest,2002-09-20 15:00:00,0,"agreed,those individuals names should be made public.after all, whould you want to go on a fishing trip with a guy who breaks the laws. I would like to know, this is from personal experiance. All Provinces and States should publish the names of Game Laws violators."
524110,Guest,2002-09-21 05:31:00,0,"get of the ""American"" and ""Canadian"" soapbox. these guys were poachers and game law violators, doesn't matter where they are from! do you think only Americans break the law in Canada. give me a Break. You do not read of the ""Canadian"" who come to the US to hunt and fish and get fines , because it is not our practice to make that public, but you would be supprised.anyway.... these guys were slops, and should not e allowed a fishing permit again for 5 years. If you break a Game Law in many states, you loose your Hunting privliges fro 5 years . same shouldgo for fishing, no matter where they are from."
524115,2 DOGS,2002-09-10 15:41:00,361,"My hat's off to you Musky Man. It takes a hellofa man to admit he erred and bigger yet to apologize. Way to go! I just found out some friends of mine were caught with a ""slot"" walleye. They knew the regs and I know they knew the size of the fish. I made their slotbox. I have no sympathy for such foolishness and they deserve what they got, a nice hefty fine!!"
524116,bobnalong,2002-09-10 17:20:00,10,"m-man:poachers are poachers, at home or away. they don't respect your country, its laws or its resources. they act the same at home. glad they were caught.have to agree with the beef about the ""variable"" exchange rate, based upon perceived need, value of fishing time lost, and distance from a bank.see you next year.bobnalong, wisconsin"
524117,fishcop,2002-09-10 17:47:00,11,"good to see support for fisheries enforcement-and yes, poachers are not just out of Canada visitors, we in Canada have MORE than our share of game hogs-remember, most provinces have a TIP line or report a poacher-please use it!"
524107,Guest,2002-09-10 18:37:00,0,"6"" Walleye??..Com'on now........ why would any local keep a 6"" walleye when you can simply catch 100 over 20"" ??Not trying to stir the pot but I would have to think they were NOT Locals if thats what they were keeping....... Maybe Chineese.... you would have to be ""Loco"" to keep a 6"" walleye...... ??"
524109,Guest,2002-09-10 19:21:00,0,"It may not have to do with angling, but I know Canadians who come to the US and work, (which we are not allowed to do in Canada), not pay any US taxes then complain about how terriable they are treated. I realize they are the minority, as I hope most of the violators are. If you would like, I'll keep the +$1,500 I and my son spent for our week in Canada, and go else where next year. And yes we did follow all the rules and regulations of your providences."
524118,Rick,2002-09-10 21:03:00,226,"At the risk of agreeing with Canadian Guy:), I believe that many of the laws are broken out of ignorance or confusion. I AM NOT TRYING TO MAKE ANY EXCUSES HERE, but the book of fishing regulations gets larger and more specific to smaller areas and individual lakes and it seems to be more confusing each year. You can spend hours studying the Ontario regs booklet (I have) and still not be 100% certain you're legal.I would like to see a regulation included that would require any licensed outfitter or lodge to distribute a one or two page set of rules or regs for the particular lake or lakes that they serve. When you are from out of the area and at at outpost, its impossible to know which area you might be in or if you are north or south of some highway, and know with some assurance what the limits, sizes, seasons, allowed baits, hooks, number of poles, etc. are for your lake. Just my 2 cents."
524119,retire55,2002-09-11 10:12:00,1029,"Rick:Alternatively, one could email the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR) and request clarification of the regulations for the area one is going to fish. This process has helped our group to better understand Quebec fishing regulations (e.g. transportation of your catch, transporting live leeches, use of frozen smelt as bait, etc).Unfortunately, the OMNR does not presently provide email addresses for each of the three regions of Ontario. Consequently, at this time, one can only direct enquiries to [email protected]It is far easier to enjoy a fishing trip if you are postive you understand the fishing regulations. Jay"
524103,chrism,2002-09-11 11:49:00,429,I agree...well said!cm
524120,Guest,2002-09-11 15:45:00,0,Awww...... I'm glad we have some common ground Rick. Every year the boys go through the new regs for the lakes that we fish. There are lake specific rules that change from time to time. It is dificult enough for us here to understand the rules...I could imagine the dificulties that people have from another country. The other rule we have is that we offer the Game Warden only the information that he asks about. We are polite but offer no more than the bare minimum. I have nothing to hide but if I'm doing something wrong and not knowing it...I would prefer to be told by another angler.
524121,Guest,2002-09-11 19:55:00,0,Rick you have made a good point the outfitter you are staying with should make available condensed regulations pertaining to the lake or lakes you will be fishing. I also think they should have some responsibility as to making sure their guests do obey the regulations as far as size and catch limits as these are the people who have the most to gain from this valuable resource.
524100,River Rat,2002-09-08 20:31:00,43,"Did I run into you on Little Vermilion in 1982? My buddy and I were catching a LOT of nice smallmouth, releasing all but a few smaller ones for dinner (and not taking any home). A local motored up to rail at us for being U S citizens and raping the resource, while he was slipping a 3-4 lb smallie into the gunny sack. He suggested that we stay south of the border. I decided that if that was the attituded of Canadians, I would keep my money in the U S. And I have. However I was considering a Canadian fly-in to celebrate graduations from High School and College. I had always enjoyed my trips to Andersons, Knobbys and Nestor Falls. You, Sir, have convinced me to scrap that plan and keep my money south of the Canadian border."
524101,BD,2002-09-08 21:05:00,739,Don't stay home. That will make Musky Man the winner. He want's to be enough of a pain to turn people away. There are a lot of good people in Canada and in the States. Enjoy the country and the people you meet. Respect breeds respect. Report the poachers you see and let the MNR take care of them.
524111,Guest,2002-09-08 21:35:00,0,"Whew, no guys from Illinois to be ashamed about."
524102,Rick,2002-09-09 07:20:00,226,"Here we go again. Another Canadian ranting and raving about the ""ugly Americans"" ignoring Canadian laws. Those rude Americans from places like Missouri, Indiana, Wisconsin, Manitoba, Winnipeg, etc. Oh wait a minute, Manitoba and Winnipeg, aren't they in... hmmm, let me think ... oh yeah, CANADA!!! This can't be. Canadians breaking the fishing laws. Must be a misprint. They must have some American blood in them. Once again, lets go through this step at a time. About 90-95% of the people on both sides of the border obey the laws. The balance do not. Lumping all Canadians into one group (good guys) and all Americans into another group (bad guys) is not particularly constructive. So please get off of your soapbox (or Molson case) and open your eyes."
524104,Andyeye,2002-09-09 08:22:00,179,"I have seen Canadians violate pheasant laws and bag limits here in Iowa. My friend who is a DNR officer here caught a group from Ontario several years ago with about 20 birds over the possesion limit and half of them were hens. I do not group all Canadians as poachers though. As far as contributing to the economy, I buy supplies and really enjoy getting 40% exchange from merchants when the exchange rate was 54%. I will make sure from now on I will have plenty of Canadian money to spend while I'm up there to keep from getting gouged. Canada is a great place and does deserve American respect of the game laws and its people, but that goes both ways."
524112,eyedoktr,2002-09-09 09:45:00,2426,"Thanks for the post. It embarasses me as a sportsman (hunt/fish) that any of our fellow brethern , American or Canadian, would do this. I personally feel that the fines were way too lenient. I didn't see any mention of vehicle (car/truck/boat) confiscation and/or revocation of fishing rights."
524106,larry c,2002-09-09 12:23:00,3,Fines don't seem very high.As for game hogs I agree it goes both ways.Watched some locals in Eastern Ontario filling a gunny sack with 6 inch walleyes just below a falls.What we saw them catch would have been at least a hundred over the limit.
524113,Guest,2002-09-09 15:10:00,0,Anyone who breaks the game laws wherever he's from deserves the consequences. A lot of folks south of the border do not read the Ontario regulations or do not understand them. I have corrected US anglers on several occasions who do not understand the catch per day and the possession limits. A CO would have had a field day and they would have made the papers. I think a lot of laws are broken because of ignorance of the regulations.
524108,IaCraig,2002-09-09 20:28:00,434,"Musky Man, I have no time for anyone who breaks game and fish laws, and I hope they get max fines despite of their race, gender, social class or nation of origin. I also am glad to see people such as yourself take pride of ownership of their natural resources, however your negative prejudiced attitude is such a very ugly character flaw that I doubt if most people take you serious. IaCraig"
524114,Guest,2002-09-10 13:48:00,0,"Ok, I owe everyone an apology.I know that all American anglers are not all bad, and I sure know that not all Canadian fisherman are all good. There is a bad bunch in every crowd be it American or Canadian.I guess I should have stopped and thought about it more before I put my foot in my mouth, but most of the dealings I have had were with American anglers who just did't follow our regulations and did not care.I think ALL anglers need to be more educated on why there are such regulations and the impacts that over harvesting will do.Once again, I apologize. I am not Anti-American, heck I even have a few US friends. I just went on a rampage and I apologize for that. Canada is a beautiful country with awesome resources and is to be enjoyed by all as long as they follow the regulations that will keep it a country with awesome resources.Sincerly Musky Man"

524090,BD,2002-09-06 14:24:00,739,It's good that game hogs get caught but I don't understand why some are fined only $100 each and others are fined $400 or $700 each for the same offense. Why aren't the fines for similar offenses similar? All the cases were apparently tried by the same judge.
524091,Guest,2002-09-06 14:28:00,0,I'm from the states. This type of behavior makes me very angry! I am glad to see that these individuals got caught!I think it would be a good idea to post this information over on either the General Discussion or Fishing Reports boards. In fact both would be a good idea! There has to be some fishermen that know some of these individuals. I think it is time that they ARE held accountable for their actions.Thank you for giving us the facts! It is people like these that give other fishermen a bad name.

524093,Guest,2002-09-08 07:00:00,0,"I saw the one fine was for packaging frozen fish in a manner that they could not be easily identified. We usually filet our take-home fish in a ""butterfly"" fashion (the two fillets still connetcted by belly skin), and place two fish, back to back, in a baggie, with the skin showing out on all four fillets. Haven't been checked in recent years - does any one know if this packaging method is acceptable?"

Probably a decent bunch of guys, just ignorant.Pooch"
524098,Guest,2002-09-08 18:36:00,0,"This type of thing enrages me. I am Canadian and it burns me that people like this come up to ""Canada"" and do things like this. There is no reason to take the quantities of fish that they did. It makes us Candians look at the American fisherman as idiots. It gives us an attitude toward the American fisherman. There is absolutly no reason for it. Why the heck don't they stay south of the border and catch their own fish, or maybe its because they are all gone.I see Americans come up here with their boats, huts, atvs, food, tents, gas cans and contribute as less as possible to our economy nor do they care to, heck I have even seen one guy keep a 6 inch bass and the ##### thing wasn't even in season. If you want to pull these stunts stay in the states where you belong and leave our resources alone. I know that there are good Americans out there and I know that I probably have offended a few but remember it is not your country and you are a visitor please set an example so things like this don't happen as frequently as they do. How would you Americans like it if us Canadians came and did what these guys did, hurting the fishery and just leaving wothout a care in the world. Heck they didn't even show up for court. Think about it, I think you would be saying the same thing I am saying.Musky Man"
524099,timeout,2002-09-08 20:24:00,28,"Musky man, settle your butt down. If you read the linked information you would also see the people from manitoba and Ontario. Being born and raised in Canada. I assure you and I think you also know, that there are groups of people here, who do not care about the regulations and do exactly what they want. Around these parts you do not have to look for bootleg fish, it will find you. By bootleg I refer to the pickerel that you get for between $c3 and 5 a pound without a receipt. I fish a fair to middling amount and I see violations by our citizens more than a fair bit. Personally I think this is just your excuse to go off on an anti-american rant. I personally think that they are idiots (the cheats) and I hope they ALL get caught. Having said that, I personally would find you a bit more credible if you referenced all the cheats, and made a valid complaint about the depletion of resources from all sources. Until your postulating has a more reasonable tone ie. lose your emotional and nationalistic posturing, I intend to ignore you."
