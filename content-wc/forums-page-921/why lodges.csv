524386,aaron,2002-09-20 22:31:00,6,why would anyone come to northwestern ontario and comit to one lake?
524387,lenray,2002-09-21 06:27:00,467,Interesting question--most aren't capable of tenting on islands or have the equipment that can take them off the gravel road and back into the bush on quads with a canoe then into river lake systems that takes them into the interior where few dare to tread.For me it is the challenge of geting to those lakes that is as much fun as the actual fishing.And oh my those lakes are SOMETHING ELSE always fishing on a lake where noone else is fishing and when we go back there isn't any changes that show others have been there since ouor last visit.
524389,Guest,2002-09-21 12:07:00,0,That's like asking why you would comit to one woman. Maybe you like the chase'n more than the catche'n?
524390,sdyer,2002-09-21 16:09:00,34,I agree but i still to go to a lodge. the fly-in i go to fishes five lakes from the base camp via portage. We fish a differnt lake every day. It's one of the main reasons I go there every year.
524391,oneforseed,2002-09-21 18:35:00,65,5 lakes a week? how about a url/web address? looking for something like that.
524392,stewart,2002-09-22 10:43:00,100,Ever hear the story about the scientist who spent his whole summer exploring? He got half way across his back yard...Some lakes are worth a lifetime.
524388,aaron,2002-09-22 17:22:00,6,then you smell what i'm cooking?Come to nwo.

524394,Guest,2002-09-22 17:30:00,0,So does that mean you married your first lodge?
524395,phishfearme,2002-09-22 17:32:00,1242,"are there two questions here? ""why lodges (as opposed to a private lake - fly-in or portage in)?"" is a different question than ""why commit to one lake?"". we prefer a different lake(s) every trip - there's soooo much variety to pick from. and we prefer a private lake - why travel that far to see crowds? but certainly canada offers both and it's a personal preference.phish"
