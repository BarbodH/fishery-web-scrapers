524282,Guest,2002-09-17 07:39:00,0,"Fished Machawaian and Kenozha with Trophy Fish Outposts. Mid-August and early September. Fished primarily for walleye. Good numbers (to 4 lbs) but never found great size. Flight, cabin, equipment, service, etc. all fine. Jim and Yvonne run a good operation. Would not hesitate to spend a week at one of their places again, and likely will in another year or two. Eagle Beak Baits in Armstrong (807) 583-2344 did a nice job of supplying us with minnows to lfy in. Hope this helps."
