522724,Guest,2002-08-02 14:45:00,0,Did you hook up for a trip as yet? Will be going to Morson Sept 12. Reply if interested.
522722,Guest,2002-08-04 16:48:00,0,That only works for residents. Non-residents buy the tag they want. They don't need numbers
522723,Guest,2002-08-05 14:27:00,0,"I hunt moose close to Ignace and there are alot of moose in that area.We (group of 3) have a 100% sucess rate over 9yrs in my area and it keeps getting better. I am a Resident of Ontario and if you apply in a group you will do much better for tags than those who apply single, heck... how much can one eat anyway......As for Non-resident buying tags of there choice, that going to be getting harder to do as the MNR are on the chopping block and outfitters are starting to get there tags reduced... going to be very expensive..."
