523397,Guest,2002-08-11 04:37:00,0,Just returned from Holinshead and had great fishing even tho we experienced a pretty good mayfly hatch which is really quite unusual for this time of year. It seemed to suspend quite a few fish for the week. Largest walleye was 25 and largest Northern was 37 but had on walleye to the boat between 27-30 which straightened the hook completely out on a floating jig. Great trip!
523398,Guest,2002-08-13 09:15:00,0,Fished there last year....had a great time with lots of fish. You get flyin fishing without the flyin. My only complaint was the noseeums...brutallll...
523399,Guest,2002-08-14 06:57:00,0,"I have fished this lake for over 15 years. The numbers are always great, but the size of the fish is 16-18 inches. Just wondering if anybody who has fished this lake has gotten any big fish out of it."
523400,Guest,2002-08-14 16:02:00,0,Walleye to six pounds. Lots in the 20-22in range. Yanks at the resort caught to 10lbs.
