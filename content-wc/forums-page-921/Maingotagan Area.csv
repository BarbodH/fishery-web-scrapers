But why not check out Traverse Bay - Its a world class Walleye fishery. #####, go during the week when there are fewer people. There's lots of room out there to fish."

It was kind of spooky driving around because you didn't have a clue where all the rocks where.All I can say is we gave it half a day and had two boats and know one caught anything. Boy was that water like light colored choloate milk up there, I thought Traverse bay was bad when the wind was blow in.Oh ya, we took a left at the boat landing and went up the river to the water falls, that was the highlight. It was pretty. And I just remembered we caught a dogfish in the spillway below it. Those things are always followin me. That's how I got the name WI-dogfish. They like to leave teeth marks in my shad raps.good luck,Jason"
