He's a transplanted Aussie and is a magician while filleting fish. The cabins, however, are showing their age. Our cabin had a leaky refrigerator and the deck was soft plywood. I wondered when one of would fall through. If I go there again I would consider another resort on Wabaskang with newer cabins."
523428,Guest,2002-09-23 06:09:00,0,We just returned from a week at Tall Pines. This is our 4th year there! As usual we had a great time & caught some very nice walleye every day! Pete & Donna are the best. We highly recommend you stop by & check out their camp. Thanks again Pete & Donna!

523418,hgf,2002-08-11 19:43:00,199,"I just got back from three days of fishing there. First time on the lake. It was slow the first day, mostly small northern. Second day got into some walleyes, 12 to 18 feet, lindy rig, no spinners, only minnows. Fished along some long points where the window was coming off the lake and pushing the waves against the shoreline. Best fishing seemed to be pretty close to the shore. Other people were hitting smallmouths, in very narrow channels. There were some nice bays with cabbage, had lots of northerns follow the weedless lures, and some walleyes. I stayed at Tall Pines, nice resort. The lake is really about five lakes, quite a few houses, several resorts. I was not familiar with the lake, so was experimenting. But I did not see other people having huge success. But I liked the lake, the camp, and will go back again. Had to quit early, caught a really nice walleye, and then proceeded to let him jam a treble hook deep into the back of my hand. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Got back ok, then long drive to emergency room. Fine now, but was pretty nervous for a while."
523419,Guest,2002-08-12 06:44:00,0,"Thanks for the info. I was there about 25 years ago. I don't suppose that the lake has changed all that much. I didn't have a chance to go too far though, was in a canoe. Caught a lot of smallies right below the dam. Pulling a Lindy with a crawler is one of my fav. ways of fishing walleye. A crawler, put a little bubble of air in his tail and drift, or slow troll."
523420,Guest,2002-08-22 07:55:00,0,Swing into Tall Pines and we will give you a lake map with the present hot spots.

523424,Rocky,2002-08-26 23:11:00,5,"Hello Casey, I am interested to hear how your trip went and what you thought of Kingfisher lodge and Wabaskang. I spent the first week of July at Kingfisher and wasn't really impressed with the camp, accommodations, or the boats however the owners Bill & Charlotte Iverson were really nice folks. I thought the young man working at the camp (I believe his name was Smithers) was knowledgable and helpful. As for Wabaskang, I thought it was a beautiful lake with some good fishing. Caught 100 plus walleyes in a couple of days--some nice jumbo perch and some real nice smallies. Tall pines camp looked very nice from what I could see. If I do return I will give Tall Pines a try. I may be wrong but it seemed a litle crowded to me--I believe there is eight camps on the lake. Hope you had a good trip let us know how it went."
523425,Guest,2002-08-28 08:40:00,0,"I agree with your assment of Kingfisher. I did stop at Tall Pines and was very impressed. While staying at Kingfisher all I was told about the ""hot spots"" is that ""there are fish all over out there."" That may well be true, but it was Tall Pines that told me where they were biting. The camp at Kingfisher didn't impress me all that much, but as far as boats go, I took my own up. The price at Tall Pines would be less for me with my own boat. As you mentioned, Char and Bill are very nice. Smithers is a real piece of work, isn't he. Very nice young man, and I have never seen fish fileted faster. I'm not slow and he can do at least four to my one. We went in there right after a cold front and had a tough bite. The saving feature were the Jumbo Perch. Some of them went up to 13 inches. All in all it was a nice week. The next time I think it will be a Tall Pines."
523426,Rocky,2002-08-28 22:59:00,5,"Casey, Thanks for your assesment of Kingfisher and Wabaskang it is nice to get some feedback from other folks. You are right about the jumbo perch fishing it was great. I agree with you about Tall Pines if I go back that is where I'll stay."
