524227,Guest,2002-09-12 19:13:00,0,"I would check with Pat's Marine in Kenora or Tompkin's in Emo, Ontario. Both places will give you great prices and excellent service."
524228,Guest,2002-09-13 22:31:00,0,"Hello:Sorry, but Pat's in Kenora went belly up early this spring.Dealers in Winnipeg.*Winnipeg Yamaha---Alumacraft and Misty River with Yamaha outboards. Great bunch of guys.*Ronds Marine---Lund and Merc. Dennis is a great(he's in service) *AVO Marine---Lund and Merc or Honda. Good guys and fair deals.There are other dealers but I can't think of any more selling Lund or Misty River. My first choice would be Winnipeg Yamaha but I would have a look at the Alumacraft, on the other hand out of all the brands mentioned above, you will probably get the nicest package in a Misty for around 10K.If you have any questions feel free to e-mail me as I used to be in the industry and know quite a few of the guys in Winnipeg. Email ad is: [email protected]Good luckLawrence"

524230,Guest,2002-09-15 06:35:00,0,"Just returned from the Lynn lake area, man what a drive, but if i remember correctly i saw what you are looking for setting in a yard with a for sale sign on it south of Winnepeg on the right heading for Pembina i just don't recall how far south of town, it was a 16 foot misty river."
524231,Guest,2002-09-15 07:33:00,0,"Thanks guys for all the information...to date I am still looking, so post any 'for sale' boats which you may find and/or hear of.Thanks again,"
524232,Guest,2002-09-15 19:45:00,0,"Be sure to check out the Alumarine line of boats (they are made in Winnipeg). I have used them extensively, as do many resorts especially further north on the bigger lakes. They are extremely well built, and handle well under tough conditions. The downfall is that they are made by a small company which does not produce a lot of boats (therefor a little hard to come across). My opinion is they are twice the boat a Lund is and are made locally. Not sure on web site but check your phone book."
524233,Guest,2002-09-16 04:44:00,0,"I have a Lund Pro Angler 16 ft. with a Johnson 40 hp. and E-E loader roller trl. , many many extras , I have had it since new , very very good condition call 1-320-587-2733 eves after 9 pm.. I am in central MN. $3500 us. funds"
