Unfortunately, at every tackle shop I go in southern Ontario, people look at me like I'm a psycho when I inquire about it.Does anyone at all know where I can buy Rapala's Dr. Juice Trout Attractant?I'm mostly looking for Canadian tackle shops and stores, but I'm willing to look elsewhere, even on the internet.If you can help, just drop me an e-mail.-Carleen (Heeeeere FISHYFISHYFISHY!)[email protected]"

I had an old free sample bottle from a sport show in the barn, but it is now gone. You may need to try something or a more modern vintage. Sorry that I cannot help you. Ohio fisherman"
