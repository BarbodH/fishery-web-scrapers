524356,Guest,2002-09-18 05:33:00,0,Anyone been up 17 to Ignace from Thunder Bay recently? I'm heading up for a moose hunt-walleye trip and just wondering how much construction is involved through this stretch. Thanks and good luck.

524358,Guest,2002-09-20 20:00:00,0,There was construction on 17 for a 10 mile stretch between Raith and Upsala. Haven't travelled the highway for a couple of months so cannot tell you if it is completed yet.
524359,Guest,2002-09-21 07:23:00,0,Just came back from Sioux Lookout on the 19th and they are almost finished the construction. There was only a short wait (a couple minutes). It looks like they will be finished in within the next week or so..Good Luck.
