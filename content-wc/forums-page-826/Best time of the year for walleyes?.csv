537937,Guest,2004-03-04 22:00:00,0,I fish out of Morson on all the reefs from Painted Rock down to Dawson.
537938,Guest,2004-03-04 22:09:00,0,I got too busy to up-date the journal but I'm floating the San Juan next week and should have some stories by then. The newsletter should out next week. It has a photo of a father and son walleye fishing on the reefs - you might be interested. I got an invite to float the Green in a dory below Flaming Gorge and fly fish. If I get to it there might be some journal material in that trip. I Been fishing with Ry Cooder lately.

537985,Guest,2004-03-08 12:05:00,0,"Honestly......I think it really depends on ice out....whether is happens early, normal or late. Been going up around Minaki for 24 years......been fishing late June early July for the past five years and have decided that on average the best fishing is had the second week of June....just my experiance."
537986,Guest,2004-03-08 12:23:00,0,I think the best time to catch big Walleye on lakes is in the spring when they are making the transistion from spawning to the main lake. In the fall I like to river fish when the big girls are moving to the dams to gorge themselves for the winter.
537988,Guest,2004-03-08 16:47:00,0,I find the best time for the big ones is late April early May when they are up at the rapids. Just go out with a dip net late at night and you can take your pick. You have to be carefull when handling them as they tend to make a mess with all those eggs dripping out onto the ground.

I have had various lodge owners tell me that us Americans always come in June when the best bite is in July,agree or disagree? Vince W."

One being during the alewife spawn and the other in late fall. If you look at the historical average of catching the monsters in places like Quinte, you'll find that October/November to be the best time.November night fishing for the behemoths is very challenging to say the least!"

537881,phern,2004-03-02 12:44:00,151,"Here is what I have noticed about fishing walleye at that time of the year (early to mid july). First of all, it's about the most comfortable time of the year to fish and at least at that time of the year, you will not be bothered by the post spawn blues where walleye are so unpredictable. Walleye will be feeding at more predictable times of the day in more predictable areas. Nothing nicer than spending a nice July evening just as night falls and catching walleye on jigs in shallow water. Or bottom bouncing in deeper water during the day. Nice lazy time of the year where fishing lazy pays dividends. Bring a fly rod too in case you run into some white fish. You will see their dorsal fins cutting the surface of the water at night fall or dawn while feeding on large mayflies. I like to use a muddler minnow rigged ""dry"" with deer hair body on a number 10 short shank dry fly hook. The white fish can be found in rather shallow water, often where there is a bit of current flow (mouth of a river) yet near deep cold water. I've even seen walleye come up for those large mayflies too. At this time of the year, the minnow population is not all that big. The recently hatched minnows are not large yet and the adult population has been affected by predation so walleye are always ready to grab an easy lunch. Pike can be anywhere at this time of the year. It all depends on water temperature, cover or weed growth etc. I seem to catch many in about 10 feet of water and again I like to use a large streamer on a fly rod. I like to go pike fishing after the early morning walleye fishing is over."

537908,Guest,2004-03-03 19:29:00,0,On Lake of the Woods I think July is the best for big walleyes on the reefs and the weather is usually great then. The next best time would be in October - fishing in about 30ft to 35ft of water where there is some current. Both times using big jigs and minnows.
537910,Guest,2004-03-03 23:29:00,0,"Hi rgate. we usually go up in june but this is the 1st time we go in july, july10th to be exact. We allways stay at sioux narrows and go out to about 5 miles past yellow girl bay. Out [past the smiley face and then left to the next channel and down another 4 miles or so. I think they call it sunset. Where do you go?"
537911,River_eye,2004-03-04 00:19:00,1486,"on LOTW, I would have to say that late June has been the best for me in terms of ease of finding fish. It seems that the bigger fish are around, but it is hard to nail down a pattern on them. Once the warm water rolls around, you can locate the big ones a little more easily by fishing the shallow humps as was said in an earlier post. You can also locate more intense fishing in the warmer weather. The only problem is, all it takes is one weather change and you're left scratching your head until you find the intense action again, either at different locations or different baits or depths. This is also somwhat similar to the Wpg river, which I've fished for much longer, except the added dynamic of changing river flows and water levels makes it a lot more variable from year to year."
537936,PJM,2004-03-04 21:54:00,3516,Rgate Have you every taken out a guy fishing on the reefs named Van Morrison and when are you going to do an update?
