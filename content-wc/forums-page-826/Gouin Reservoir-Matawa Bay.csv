The group has booked a trip through Tamarac air service's. Does anyone have any input on the services provided by this outfitter or any information on the fishing in this part of the reservoir? Any general information or tips on techniques used to catch walleyes and pike would also be appreciated. Thank you, Tom"

June fishing is excellent and you should have success chasing pike shallow at that time of the season, Johnson Silver Minnows tipped with a Berkley power leech Or 3"" curly works for me, white spinner baits and a variety of spoons will complete your arsenal. Walleye can be jigged, cranked or bottom bounced for. I like chartreuses and orange for color and also gold for spinners."

538053,Guest,2004-03-11 09:43:00,0,"MrQ, Thanks for your reply. Two of the guys going use Tamarac service for hunting in the Fall. Just wanted to verify what they have said about there service and reputation. Looking forward to giving the Gouin a whirl. Have read on previous web pages that the Reservoir does not have pike habitat typical of most bodies of water, weedy bays. The bays mostly contain flooded timber from logging. Is there any truth to this and if so what type of structure will hold trophy size pike, ex. points, shoals? Thank you, Tom"

Double headers are common. If you're on walleye and the bite goes off, upsize your bait and keep on fishing the area. Schools of pike will put the walleye tight to bottom, fish a couple of feet up."
