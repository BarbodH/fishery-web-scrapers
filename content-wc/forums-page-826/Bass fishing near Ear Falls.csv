He loves to fish smallies on top water lures. I will be staying at GooseBay and was wondering if anyone could give me the name of a close by lake that had bass. They don't need to be big just plentiful. Thanks"

Nothing big, but lots of fun. We found them hanging tight to shorelines with broken rock and used 1/4 oz mepps xtra deep spinners. White was definitely the best color. Not to many fish for them up there and thats fine with me."
