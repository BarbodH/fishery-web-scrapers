Looking to fish the Wabaskang/Perrualt/Cedar area. Let me hear the who's, what's, where's and how's of early August fishing. I know I can count on the posters to fill it up. Thanks, Craig"

We targeted walleye and could catch a limit in the morning and in the afternoon easily. We kept only enough to eat and released all the rest. The fish were in the 14-16 inch range. The largest for the week was a 22 incher. The guys that went after smallies did well and released everything they caught. The bass are not big, but are agressive and good fighters. The Northern Pike were all ""Hammerhandles,"" abunbdant, but small. The Perch fishing was fair once we located the schools. August fishing may not as good as Mid June, but the weather is a lot warmer and you are not as likely to get a ""All Day Soaker"" rain in August. Enjoy your trip to Wabaskang"

The Small Mouth Bass were around rocky shorelines with big rocks in the water. Most of the guys got their Walleyes by drifting or slow trolling the outside edges of weedlines 11+ feet with live bait behind spinner blades."
