537772,Wisconeye,2004-02-29 09:09:00,79,"The whole concept of banning lead and for that matter the mercury issue deals with the human side of this problem. While direct ingestion of lead by birds or most animals is certainly not healthly for the species, how much of this ingestion is of a human source ie:sinkers, jigs ? I'm continually amazed that we treat lead and mercury as ""toxins"" only when they come from human sources, when most of the ""toxin"" is naturally occurring. For example, the leading sources of mercury which is partially converted to methylmercury (an ingestible source of mercury for fish and the type fisherman are concerned about) is simply volcanoes and forest fires. While I can agree that some forest fires are of human origins- I haven't seen anyone build a volcano lately. They spew tons of mercury into the atmosphere annually where it is GLOBALLY deposited. The same is true of lead. In southwestern Wisconsin for example, lead was mined from the countryside for many years. It is found in almost all soil and rock types. Small rocks- the type eaten by birds often contain high concentrations of lead. In fact, in the more iron laden rocks you'll even find considerable amounts of uranium. So if you were to extend the MNR concerns the next stretch will be to ban smoke detectors. Since smoke detectors use radioactive material in small amounts they emit radiation and since some birds could be found to contain small amounts of radioactive material then it must be due to smoke detectors. Logical? No, but neither is a ban on lead if your goal is to reduce lead ingestion by birds. Finally, toxilogical studies of birds containing mercury and lead show that these elements were present in bird carcasses examined in the early 1900's- and even more important at almost the same level as found today. Every fisherman and hunter should be aware of junk science. You should also be aware of the argument that will be raised by others saying ""prove to me that sinkers don't cause the problem"". Science CANNOT prove a negative- yet proponents of regulations banning a substance will almost always raise this question. Sorry to ramble on, but it extremely important that we fight fiction with facts and we obtain facts with sound science and WE need to require sound science as the basis for regulation."

537927,Guest,2004-03-04 15:03:00,0,"Just a reminder folks the US EPA banned use of lead fishing products and lead shot for waterfowl hunting over 15 years ago. The EPA enforced the legislation banning lead shot for waterfowl. The EPA has not yet enforced legislation banning sinkers, jigs et al."
537961,Guest,2004-03-06 12:16:00,0,Does this lead ban in Canada mean I have to pay a visit to my proctologist before I go? Just wondering?
537962,Guest,2004-03-06 13:09:00,0,They'll have to pry my right foot from my cold dead hands!!!!

537698,Guest,2004-02-25 08:02:00,0,"Petaluvr, I agree with your statement 100%. I lose a jig thats tied onto 20 lb test fishing line and they are trying to say that the loonies are digging these jigs out when there is a lake bottem full of easy to get stones>? Now I can see loonies eating fish that had a jig swallowed and die from that but the fact that it was a lead jig probably has little bearing as much as the hook itself!"
537699,Wawajake,2004-02-25 10:31:00,413,"Glad to see that a few see the junk science in this, The only advantage that a policy change like this will be in the ""Optics"" of our sport. Because realistically unless you spend most of the summer jigging in 3ft of water, this lead is going nowhere. As for it mysteriously disolving because it is immersed in water, I would suggest if that scinece is true , we all have bigger problems to worry about. We all probably live in houses where the copper pipes were soldered together between the 1900 and 1980's with lead based solder. So if the ""disolving "" science suggested is true then every house in North America and the world should have the pipes ripped out. Yes in the later part of 1990's solder has changed , but it was not deemed that important. Hopefully the silent majority will see thru this ""peta"" type thinking. I for one will be the one buying all the lead jigs on sale the few months before this ever goes in effect. jake"

537742,Guest,2004-02-26 17:27:00,0,"Leave it to the MP to do another knee-jerk reaction to false info. No offense bigfish1965. This lead ban has the same smell to it as the spring bear season. Remember, the spring bear season was responsible for 1,000's of black bear cubs starving to death because mommy was shot dead. The same people that got that pushed through are now crying because the high bear pop. are being a problem. Now when I go to Canada this year, I've got to bring in a couple of thousand of lbs. of jigs so I can stash them across the border for future fishing years. Does anybody know what the penalty is going to be for fishing with a lead headed jig, or should I just leave me poles at home, stock up with a boat full of blue on ice and take my chances. Remember, common sense will never prevail because the people making these decisions and spinning these lies don't have any."

537747,bigfish1965,2004-02-26 19:49:00,3210,"No offense taken. I think the lead ban is stupid as well. Stash me some jigs while you're at it. If this proceeeds at the pace of most other government action, we're probably safe for a few years yet."

It won't be long before it is illegal to use lead jigs and sinkers anywhere. I would bet within 10 years. I have been trying to find a source of tin that I can melt to make jigs, but so far I've been unsuccessful. Any tips someone could give me would be appreciated."

537689,Guest,2004-02-24 16:42:00,0,"Good points. It won't catch fire so quickly. It weighs less. Plus, an added benefit, it doesn't rust like lead does."

537697,Guest,2004-02-25 07:42:00,0,"It always baffles me as to how the Loon will dive down and work with great determination to dislodge my jig, split shot or sinker from the rocky crevice in which it is eternally wedged. Skillfull birds I guess they are. And as I'm no expert on lead in the environment, I do know that it is a natural element. There will never be anymore lead out there than there already is. And from what little I do know, I've been told that inorder for lead to become a health hazzard, it has to be dissolved into the blood stream somehow. Birds with gizzards for instance, kids eating paint chips etc... . In short, I believe the Loon theory to be junk science. The lead shot vs. steel shot in gunning circles I can see the correlation in heavily gunned areas,(shallow water, ducks searching for grit), but to tell me that Loons are eating lead fishing tackle, that is 99.99% lodged in a rocky formation that you or I couldn't free it from, is almost laughable."
