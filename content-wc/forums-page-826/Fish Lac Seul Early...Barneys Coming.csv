537998,Larry S,2004-03-08 21:30:00,666,"Be advised it has been learned that the Canadian National Zoo in cooperation with the American National Zoo in Washington DC will be at Lac Seul this June.Lac Seul will be closed to all fishing starting June 1st.A large contingent from both zoo's will be at Lac Seul in full force to contain and trap the big purple guy,Alias{Barney} for transportation to a new permanant resident at the Washington National Zoo.Upon completion of this task Lac Seul will be safe to fish and be reopened"
538003,Guest,2004-03-09 06:48:00,0,"Wow, this is going to be exciting. Many of the worlds finest Zoos have tried this tactic before on Barney. Thank God that Barney is the master of disguise. He once was pursued for the entire summer on LOTW and they never did come close to catching him. However during his summer at LOTW there was one time that his want to be captors were very close to him. Barney disguised himself as an outside biffy and they used him for two days but never once suspected that Barney had them by the rear."
538011,Guest,2004-03-09 13:57:00,0,"I have worked for BarneyInc for several years now. Master Barney ( he insists we call him Master) has told me on several occasions that he is the worlds best fisherman. He also always tells me that he is a gem to work for. He promised me that starting next year he is going to add me to his payroll. I dont mind working for him and not getting paid because he does give me Thanksgiving and Christmas off, well at least a half a day on each day. He also promised me that I could wax his boat and restring his fishing poles next week. I love to sneak into the basement of his Mobile Home and look at all his trophies and the pictures he has on the walls of him holding fish. Barney has lots of pictures that look like he glued his face over somebody else's face holding fish. I noticed that in a lot of the pictures he looks like he is 6'6"" tall which is kind of confusing since Barney is only 4'9"" tall and is as wide as he is tall. Oh well I still love working for Barney even if he is a legend in his own mind."
538017,Larry S,2004-03-09 19:59:00,666,"This time Barney will not get away.His repeated insistence on the singing of the phrase{I Love You,You Love Me}Will Doom the Purple Guy this year,and put him in a zoo environment made specially for him.He will be able to eat all the fish he wants,and sing for as long as he wants each day.The children will visit him,and he will be happy that he doesnot live in a restricting trailor,with no room to romp around. He can now enjoy the large pool made for him by the zoo.Yes Barney will be Happy,and Lac Seul will be left for the real fishermen"
537920,Guest,2004-03-04 12:34:00,0,"Barney, I found out that you are going to be in our group of fisherman this year at Lac Seul. I cant wait to meet you and have the privilege of fishing at your side. I hope you can teach me how to catch Walleye. I have been going to Lac Seul for many years but I just cant seem to ever catch any fish. I bought a new pole this year it is a ""Snoopy Special"". I work hard selling insurance all year so I can save up enough money to go to Canada and with you there this year I think I might finally be able to use my stringer. The rest of the guys in our group always laugh at me and give me a hard time because I cant catch fish...they call me ""Skunk Boy"". It really hurts Barney...please teach me. Thanks, Euker"
537924,Guest,2004-03-04 12:57:00,0,"i'll be there the end of may, what kind of boat does barney have? i want to stay clear of him if i see him on the some 400,000 acre lake. see ya in may"
537932,Guest,2004-03-04 17:59:00,0,"Barney has a Purple Lund Tyree. But if you see him you should go over to his boat and ask him for an autographed picture. It may be worth big $$$$$$ someday. It wont be hard to see what area of Lac Seul Barney is fishing on because there will be camera boats, camera helicopters and ESPN people all over the place."
537942,Guest,2004-03-05 07:14:00,0,Does anybody have an e email address for Barney. I would like to contact him so I may attend one of his seminars. Always looking for tips from experts who can improve my fishing.
537946,Guest,2004-03-05 14:32:00,0,I got an autographed picture of Barney last year at the World Walleye Championship. I was running low on cash last month and sold the picture on E Bay. I took the money and bought a new boat and a four bedroom home on Red Lake in Ontario. I also got a new truck and a helicopter with a 25 year old female pilot....life is good...Thanks Barney
537947,Guest,2004-03-05 14:58:00,0,"They had a special on Barney on Discovery Channel. It was a new series called ""Rural Legends"". The funny part was they could find nothing to de-bunk. The show was sponsored by LaBatt brewery."
537950,Guest,2004-03-05 16:59:00,0,Barney owns 51% of the Brewery.
537951,Guest,2004-03-05 18:35:00,0,"Is he related to the bear, then?"
537955,Guest,2004-03-06 07:51:00,0,"Barney is 51% Bear and 49% short. But all 4'9"" of him can catch fish."
537979,Guest,2004-03-08 09:24:00,0,"I was reading my latest Walleye Master Magazine and I saw the ad for Barneys new line of Rod & Reels. A 15 ball bearing reel with an 98,000 module IM 9 graphite Rod. Sells for only $699 and includes a box of Barneys hand made Walleye jigs. This is one good deal. Im ordering mine today. Also includes a vieo showing Barney catching the Walleye that still stands as the biggest Walleye ever caught in Stockton Ill."
537867,Guest,2004-03-01 08:58:00,0,"I have recieved several emails from fellow fisherman wanting to know more about Barney. Barney is a retired Chemical Engineer whose main field of endeavor while working was resin research and application. Barney currently holds over 400 patents in the field of resin application. The majority of these patents pertain to the application of resin based materials in the fishing equipment that we all use. Everytime you feel the tap of a Walleye on your rod you should think of Barney because the sensitivity of your rod is based on Barneys research. His patents also apply to fishing line,hooks and reel components. Barney is now retired and spends every day he possibly can enjoying his favorite passion ...fishing. He travels all over the USA and Canada fishing every drop of water that has a Walleye population. I have had the great honor of not only meeting Barney but also fishing with him on several occasions. He is a wealth of fishing knowledge and one of the finest gentleman I have ever met. In my opinion he should someday be in the Fishing Hall Of Fame. His contributions to fishing and mankind set an example for all of us. He is a man among men."

537876,Guest,2004-03-02 06:31:00,0,Barney fished Colorado when he was young and not the Conservationest that he is today. Back then Barney thought that Walleye looked best when it was next to fried potatoes and sweet corn. Today Barney leads the fishermans mission of catch and release and with as many Walleye as Barney catchs its good that he embraces catch and release because it is the only thing that will save Lac Seul this year.

The information he provided in that article was so precise that after I started useing his method I begin catching some really big Walleye. Does anybody have any idea where I can get an autographed picture of Barney? I would love to have one so future generations of my family can see what the best looked like."

I heard that it is one of the biggest clubs in the country and to be its Champion is an awesome achievment. I too would like to have an autographed picture of Barney. I would put it on my wall next to my autographed pictures of Babe Ruth,Johnny Unitas,Michael Jordan, Dale Earnhardt,Jack Nicklaus,Bear Bryant,Wayne Gretzky and Michael Jackson."

It would be best that all of you who plan on fishing Lac Seul in 2004 get there in May prior to Barneys arrival. This will afford you the opportunity to catch some fish because once Barney has been on Lac Seul the Walleye population will be severly limited. If history repeats itself Barneys Walleye predetation rate will have a disastrous effect on the Lac Seul Walleye population. The foundation President Wally Wallace stated that "" When Barney has unleashed his Walleye fishing talents on other impoundments it has taken years for them to recover.

537752,Guest,2004-02-27 08:36:00,0,I have heard of this Barney before. I think he is the same guy who fished out the Red River. I certainly hope that enough cash can be raised to keep him off of Lac Seul. I would hate to see this magnificent fishery be depleted at the hands of Barney.

He gave details on how to stand on a bucket and cast without loseing your balance and falling down. Its a good thing they had a barrel on stage for him to stand on or we wouldnt have been able to see him.
