538004,Guest,2004-03-09 08:58:00,0,">Try a straight shaft spinner with a white bucktail, Mepps, >Vibrax, etc. I concur. The Vibrax is a sleeper. Fan cast the sucker over structure and hang on. Only suggestion is to remove stock hook and replace with a gamakatsu of the same size (use split ring). Deadly. #4 in chrome/blue is the fave. Tubes, soft-sticks (senkos) and a topwater should always be at hand. How those on this site can compare the hunt for bronze against sleepy walleye pursuits is beyond me. Wallys are nice, but bronze rules! let 'er rip! J"

Course when they want something on top, the Yellow Magic draws em from all around. Hawker"

537539,eyedoktr,2004-02-18 11:55:00,2426,C'mon guys. This is a walleye site. Find a suitable web site to talk about garbage fish :-) Bass are just too easy to catch.
537541,Guest,2004-02-18 12:44:00,0,eyedoktr....Thats what Im talking about. Walleye is King those Smallmouth are trash fish and should not even be mentioned in the same breath as Walleye. I have caught 2 lb Walleye with 3 lb Smallmouth in their mouths.
537549,Guest,2004-02-18 19:20:00,0,Well I'm still learning how to fish them but have had a lot of success with the berkley power tubes ... darker colors seemed to get more but can't say that I gave the bright colors much of a test yet. Also had some success catching some small ones fly fishing with some larger pike flies ... they went nuts for these larger flies. For some odd reason had no luck fly fishing with poppers (larger fly that pops a little like a hula popper and is supposed to be for bass??). But I'm learning the ropes with the fly rod as well so could be more technique than anything ... still tons of fun catching them. As for the dinks who are posting anti-bass messages ... great keep ignoring bass as a gamefish ... more for the rest of us to catch !!
537550,Guest,2004-02-18 19:30:00,0,Got a bite...oh yeah set the hook...wow I got me a KRUSTY
537568,Guest,2004-02-19 12:51:00,0,Hey LugNutz ... I just thought of another good technique for smallies. For the berkley power tubes ... I wasn't catching too much one time in an area that I had already fished with the power tube... so I added a brighter colored worm or twister through the hook and it really adds to the presentation. Got a few more to bite after I cast it in front of them a few times. I think sometimes they just get angry and bite for the heck of it !!!

537625,rabbit,2004-02-21 08:13:00,1065,"I don't target smallies on a regular bases, but I did have the chance to go with some friends up into Ontario Canada and we walked up this mountain portaging canoes and paddled accross a lake then portaged again through the woods to what they call second lake...Awesome country-beautiful!!! Anyhow the lake's main fish were smallies. It was cold (50 degrees), windy and rainy...Small cranks were working and drifting a plain hook with tiny splits and crawlers seemed to outproduce most...We pulled in the canoes to swim and have shorelunch(had the kids with us,I for sure wasn't going in-burrrr!!!) and for fun I rigged a pink and white floating jig with a slip sinker about 1-foot off the bottom with the tail end of a crawler and let the line (mono) go slack and I just hammered the smallies. It was just a fluke that turned out to be the ticket...Give it a try"
537281,Guest,2004-02-10 08:16:00,0,"Since smallmouth bass are my favorite fish, I am wondering what others use as thier favorite or most productive lure for smallies. Personally I have found that a 1/4 lead head jig with a yellow twister tail reeled over the rocks has been by far the best producer."
537295,River_eye,2004-02-10 12:33:00,1486,"Jig and twister tail for sure, but no heavier than 1/8th oz. 1/16 oz is preferable and dark twister tail, black, brown, or somtimes white. Toss her out, and wait for the bite on the drop. Let it sit on the bottom for a few seconds at a time, then lift towards the boat and drop."
537309,BuckeyeWilly,2004-02-10 18:50:00,41,"I like a jig and 3"" twister tail. Also a 4"" tube with a 1/16 or 1/32 oz. weight which produces a slow tantalizing fall. My favorite way to catch them though is topwater (when they will cooperate) on a 1/8 oz phillips crippled killer. This bait resembles a tiny torpedo except that it has props on the front and rear. What a blast!!"

537524,bronzeback77,2004-02-17 17:40:00,97,I can't pick just one 1. 1/8 ounce jig head with a 4 or 5 inch pumpkinseed Zoom Fat Albert Grub 2. Chrome/Black BPS Nito Minnow 3. 4 inch Senko style bait in Shad or Black
