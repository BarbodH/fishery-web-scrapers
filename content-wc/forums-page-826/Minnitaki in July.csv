537921,Guest,2004-03-04 12:46:00,0,We are staying in a cabin on an island. Don't know for sure where it is at. I assume in Norhteast Bay somewhere. I looked at my map of Minnitaki (good map) and am having a little difficulty locating the spot you mentioned. Based on your directions to Harvey's Narrows I assume you're traveling south. Right? The rock you are referring to is to the right north) but the hump is more toward the south side of the lake! If I am reading things right it is not too far from the flasing light beacon. Does this sound right? I thought about buying a flat of nightcrawlers. Good idea or not? I assume if I fish the windy side of the islands we should be able to eventually locate a walleye or two. I also would like for my boys to hook into a large northern so I can just sit back and watch and video tape. Where is the best place to buy gas for the boat on the NE part of the lake? Any minnows? Thanks again for the help! I'm getting fired up.

537925,IaDave,2004-03-04 13:28:00,476,W-If you email me with your address I would be glad to mark a map and mail it to you. Its kind of hard to explain but I could mark a map. I didn't use nightcrawlers but some of my buddies did. It seems like minnows worked better but once you get into them it didn't make much difference. As far as gas and minnows you can either go thru Abrams chutes and there are a couple of resorts there or you can down the Pickeral Arm and there are resorts there. Keep in mind we go in Sept and the Northerns we catch are when we are catching walleyes. There were many times we were bringing in a walleye and a huge Pike would grab it.

537949,IaDave,2004-03-05 15:37:00,476,AVS- I'm pretty sure there was a post at the end of last year about Karl passing away. Maybe someone out there knows for sure. He knew alot about fishing Minnitaki and the surrounding lakes.
537953,Guest,2004-03-06 03:43:00,0,"Karl passed Jan. 10th 2004. He was 53 years old. We have both met at Pickerel Arm Camp For the past 10 years. Yes, he was very knowledgable about Minnitaki. He will be sorely missed. I'll be up there for 2 weeks in July, so will Karl, he'll always be there. Bo"

536987,Whitetail,2004-01-28 20:55:00,25,"We are thinking about fishing early July or the 3rd week in July at Minnitaki near Sioux Lookout. Does either date make a big difference? How is the fishing those times of the year? Any experience in fishing Minnitaki for eyes or northerns. I am taking my kids and wife so I would like them see some action. Any tips/advice greatly appreciated. Know of any nice, reasonable resorts? Thanks!!!!"
537033,scar,2004-01-30 13:23:00,196,"whitetail, i tried e-mailing you direct. did you get it?"
537035,Whitetail,2004-01-30 13:35:00,25,No I didn't. Any suggestions?
537080,DanL,2004-02-01 21:40:00,262,I have fished Minnitaki the second week in August for the last 6 years. The 2 resorts on the lake are Pickeral Arm Camps and Donnellys. I have stayed at both resorts and they both are nice and reasonable resorts. The fishing for walleyes and pike is excellent when we go in August and I have herd it is good in July also. Walleyes are on the reefs and off of the islands this time of year. Red Pine Bay is good also but I prefer to find spots with fewer boats. As for pike southwest bay is good. Fish the rocky islands and the weed beds. The arm also has good pike fishing. If you want more of a detailed report E-Mail me.
537637,Guest,2004-02-21 15:08:00,0,"Try contacting Northern Sunrise Outfiters in Sioux Lookout, been there 4 times ,always a blast, tell them mike schmidt told you about them."
537909,Guest,2004-03-03 20:49:00,0,I live in Sioux Lookout. Minnitaki lake is great in July. The fish are normally on humps by early July at the latest.Your usual assortment of jigs tipped with a minnow or leech work well. Rigs also work very well at this time of the year.
537912,Guest,2004-03-04 06:49:00,0,Looks like we'll be up the last week in June. We'll fish mainly around the Northeast Bay. I thought I'd also try Lyons Bay and Troutfish Bay. Any thoughts on these areas in June. I also want to try my luck at Lake Trout. Do you think the water level will come up? Have you had much luck trolling this time of year? Thanks for the help!!
537916,IaDave,2004-03-04 09:07:00,476,W- I have been up there in Mid-Sept and there are a few humps & reefs we had good luck on. In Northeast Bay in the main part of the bay there is a reef that extends out from the big Island by the chutes. Before you get to Harvey's Narrows there is a red marker. Left of the marker to the island there is a decent hump(30'). When you go thru Harvey's Narrows into the main lake stay to the right and look for a good sized rock sticking up. Once you find that head towards the island that is across the lake and there is a great spot in between. Goes from like 100' to 30' in a hurry. Its not real big and you may see some boats there. Never had much luck in Lyons Bay but they all say that is the spot for lakers. Good luck.
537917,Guest,2004-03-04 09:35:00,0,"Thanks for the great advice. Do you know if there is a ""Hot Spot Map"" I can buy and download on my GPS? I find the GPS is a great way to locate some of these more difficult spots. My two boys are getting excited. They have never been to Canada and are looking forward to it. I anticipate chartreuse jigs work well. Have you ever fished Lac Suel? How does that compare to Minnitaki for fishing quality? Thanks Again!!"
537919,IaDave,2004-03-04 09:59:00,476,"W- I don't believe there is a Hot Spots Map. I know good maps are avail at the bait shop before you get to Sioux Lookout. What resort are you staying at?,they will have them too. If you want to order one now go to Red Lake Digital website. We had our best luck using heavy (1/2 oz) plain white jigs with a long shank hook and a large minnow. We hooked the minnow by going in thru the mouth and out a gill and then hooked in the side. Dead or alive didn't make a difference just need to get the flash of the white belly. Explaination I got was that there are alot of smelt in the lake which are fairly white. Never been to Lac Suel but a WC member who passed away recently(Karl) explained it best. You may find larger fish in Lac Suel but if you are happy catching alot of walleye between 20"" & 27"" you can't go wrong with Minnitaki. If you have any questions feel free to email me."
