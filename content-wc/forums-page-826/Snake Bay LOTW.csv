538023,Guest,2004-03-09 23:56:00,0,bronzeback I meant to ask do you own whitepines or that is the place you stay? I found it to be very nice although the launch ramp needs work to get my boat in. The owner was very nice he hooked my trailer to his avalanche and pulled it around to the north side where some rocks make a decent enough ramp. next time I will launch at sioux narrows anyway and drive the boat back now that I know the way. hope the water level is up. the docks are very nice and no extra charge for having your own boat which is very refreshing. I dont think I will go to any place that charges a dockage fee.

Jeff and Gina are my good friends and I usually see them a couple times a year away from the lodge. Twin Rock is located on the way out of Snake Bay before you get to the powerlines. There are two boulders (twin rock) sticking well out of the water on one side and on the other is a long rock point with a orange navigational triangle or arrow on the top of it. It is impossible to miss if you are heading out of the back of Snake Bay. I have caught many Walleye and Lake Trout right out in front of that area. As for the docks I think they are very nice and they going to work on making them better this year (I think). I believe that the poor launching conditions were compounded by the low water, in the past I have never had any problems. I think they are working on improving that as well. I hear that there is allot of snow on the ground right now so hopefully the water level is much better this year. That will make the Walleye fishing even better in Snake Bay."

537992,Guest,2004-03-08 19:01:00,0,"Has anyone fished Snake Bay on Lake of The Woods. I've fished, for the last 19 years, mainly in the Kenora area. This year we are going to try fishing in Snake Bay and the Sioux Narrows area. Heading up around the end of July. Thanks"
537994,Guest,2004-03-08 20:09:00,0,If your out to catch walleyes you may not get the numbers that your acustom to up in the Kenora area but the overall size will good.Snakebay does hold some good bas fishing as well as some northerns. You may want to venture into the Whitefish bay area and fish the reefs out their (Bell Island area is usually a good area)Good Luck
537995,Guest,2004-03-08 20:44:00,0,How is it for running a boat???What I mean is there any hidden spots that you need to stay away from. I know this sounds silly but up around Kenora the routes are marked. On my maps there are no nav bouys. I have always relied on those markers to set up my runs down the lake. I've got a GPS so getting lost is not so much a fear now. Thanks for the reply.
538007,Guest,2004-03-09 11:11:00,0,"This area does not have as many Nav bouy's as Kenora area but it is fairly easy to get around.Drop me a line as you get closer to your trip date and i can give you a update as to what the fishing is like, may help get you on the fish a quicker."
538013,bronzeback77,2004-03-09 17:00:00,97,"I have fished Snake Bay for the past seven years. It does hold some very nice size Walleye, Bass and Northern. I have never fished in July I always am up the last week of May. My personal best Northern (42inches) and Walleye (31 inches) came from Snake Bay. If you go to the very back of Snake Bay you can get into some really nice Largemouth 4-5lbs. You will go right past White Pine Lodge (my lodge). There are quite a few reefs in Snake Bay that I would think would hold a lot of Smallies in July, but southern Whitefish is better for Smallmouth. I would say the best Walleye fishing in July in Snake would be near the Power lines or near twin rock."
538015,Guest,2004-03-09 19:38:00,0,"We're staying at White Pine. Sounds like you've had pretty good luck there. Really looking forward to this summer, we missed last year and can't wait to get back up to Canada. Are the docks at White Pine pretty good????????"
538016,Guest,2004-03-09 19:42:00,0,"Thanks, I'll take you up on that. Do you have an email address??"

538022,Guest,2004-03-09 23:48:00,0,We stayed at white pines the last week they were open last september. By the back end of snake bay right past white pines do you mean up that little channel that is pretty shallow past their docks? I know the power lines but what are the twin rocks? Is that the area where you turn to go toward the power lines? Last september we generally had to go out to the area past yellow girl bay past the rock painted with the smiley face and over the where the sunset trail is around chishold island to catch any walleyes. Its a long ride but pleasant. the only problem is you can only have a pocession limit of 2 walleye per license. For 4 fish thats a long way to go. The dnr guy blames it on the minnesota gov ventura somehow.
