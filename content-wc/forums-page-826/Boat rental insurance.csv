538000,Guest,2004-03-08 23:24:00,0,generally the resort owner has a little rider that covers the equipment for 50 or a hundred dollors. it all depends how lucky you feel bucky!
538001,Guest,2004-03-09 04:31:00,0,"I would assume that the resort owner does not have a rider on his insurance, but is self insuring. As odd as it seems, insurance companies do not offer a rider that the customer can pay for to insure the equipment separately from the resort's insurance. Not affecting the resort's ""experience rating"". Another thing you could look into is to what extent your own homeowner's policy will help. I know of a number of people that were able to file claims with their own companies, to reimburse the resort for damage done to rented boats. Frank Walsh"

538024,Guest,2004-03-10 00:09:00,0,those rocks have a habit of coming out of nowhere especially when the water is low. the worse I ever did was bend up the prop. 70 bucks canadian. I bring my own boat now. although I must say I did see some texans calling home about the d*** F****** Indians that could not speak english. I must say to hear the conversation - they were really mad and yelling on the phone the whole camp could here it- It seemed that they were the ones that could not speak english because every other word was the F word. I think they wrecked the lower unit and did not have the insurance the lodge offered for the 50 dollors.
