526172,Guest,2002-12-29 18:04:00,0,Does anyone have any experience/info on resorts in western Quebec? I would be driving from Michigan and meeting people driving from New York. We would like to find something that would be in western Quebec so we would have equal driving time.
526173,nemio,2002-12-30 04:59:00,96,There is a link with outfitters located west in Quebec: http://www.fpq.com/fpq/owa/fper.cons...&p_noatr=ATR13And if you want the cream of the cream: www.beauchene.comHope it will help you and if you want more infos I'm there.

526174,McQ,2002-12-30 07:51:00,615,"There are hundreds of lodges and fishing opportunities in Western Quebec from rough camping to full American Plan fly-ins. There are many websites available for information - Start with this one and look at the Abitibi-Temiskaminque, Mauricie and Outaouais regions.http://www.bonjourquebec.com/anglais...che/index.htmlYou can also email me at [email protected] for more specific info.McQ"
526176,Guest,2002-12-30 17:52:00,0,"Thanks for the info guys. We would be targeting walleye and pike the most but are up for anything. As far as driving times, we would be travelling from Rome, NY., and Sault Ste. Marie, Mi."
526177,retire55,2002-12-30 19:03:00,1029,"Hi again:Nemio provided a good reference web site but you need to go back one page (click top left) from Outaouais to the following URL: http://www.fpq.com/entregeo.htmlThere you will see the map of the complete province of Quebec and its various divisions. Divisions A, B (Outaouais), C and D probably afford the most potential.Our group of walleye enthusiasts has been frequenting Division A - Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue. We have been fishing Lake Kipawa where there are walleyes, northern pike, lake trout and white fish. You can visit Kipawa.com for more information if interested. As well, a search of this board on Lake Kipawa will provide more information. I have no personal knowledge of outfitters/resorts in Divisions C or D. Jay"

538120,winkdink,2004-03-12 17:55:00,13,"Pavillion Richer without a doubt. Huge Walleye (the last 14 years we have been going we got one Walleye over 15lbs,one over 14lbs and at least 15 over ten lbs)(just for the record I caught only one of the 10 pounders and have been there 16 times). Early season big big pike.It takes a real man to get there(85 miles of dirt logging road with plenty of washouts from those ####(pun intended)beavers.The good news is the lake is 15 miles long and 3 mile wide at certain points and his campers /fisherman/hunters have exclusive rights to the lake,that means no one else but his customers,and you do not see many people during the day quite often none. To find his website search: Lac Echouani. Also just so you know out in the deep bush he has hot showers and sinks and flush toilets in the cabins(except outpost).Trust me it is really worht the trip the only reason I am going elsewhere this year for the first time since""90"" is he has no Bass and I just wanted to catch some bass this trip.But I will be back next year without a doubt. Good luck & Godspeed Vince W. in New Jersey"
