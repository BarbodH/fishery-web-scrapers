No more Hockey for Bertuzzi this year for sure and maybe not next year either. Good for the NHL. The NBA should start getting serious, too. Baseball needs some leaders who have some. Baseball has a drug problem, literally, on steroids. Sports used to be good, now it is a concoction of freaks and nuts. So, I say, let us go fish and no longer contribute to the deliquency of these spoiled millionaire misfits and brats."
