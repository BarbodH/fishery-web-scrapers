537993,Guest,2004-03-08 19:47:00,0,"Hi Everyone, Can anyone help me out with some general information on these two lakes, such as basic structure types and water depths/clarity, predominant shoreline features/composition, shoreline development, if any (cottages, lodges), etc.? Is most of the Dogpaw shoreline Reserve land? Any access issues at the landing at Dogpaw? Thinking of day launching from the Prov. Park, or perhaps camping on either of the two lakes, if possible. Are there many beaches at all, or campsites/clearings/firepits on the many islands? What's the current like at Dogpaw ""rapids."" Problems for a small boat (or canoe)? Portages? I've read that Caviar is excellent for bass; what about other species? Any great spots/techniques to share? Are depth maps of these two lakes available in Sioux Narrows? Anybody got 'em in .jpgs? :) Thanks a lot to anyone who can help."
538006,MN_Moose,2004-03-09 09:10:00,965,"Hi Joe, answers inserted, Q: Can anyone help me out with some general information on these two lakes, such as basic structure types and water depths/clarity, predominant shoreline features/composition, shoreline development, if any (cottages, lodges), etc.? A: Caviar and Dogpaw are primarily Lake Trout waters if read Dick Pearson's articles and book. The water can reach very deep to over 100 feet. Water is very clear. There are some areas with rock reefs that do well for smallies. Shoreline is mostly shield rock much like you see along the road passing through Nestor Falls and Sioux Narrows. There aren't many if any cottages. There are two camp on Caviar. Is most of the Dogpaw shoreline Reserve land? The area has many small islands. Q: Any access issues at the landing at Dogpaw? Thinking of day launching from the Prov. Park, or perhaps camping on either of the two lakes, if possible. A: There is one boat landing to get on the two lakes. It is very primitive with a steep incline and virtually no dock. The ramp is located on the I.R. Pay chief to park on their land. If you're from the states I don't think you can camp. I might be wrong. Q: Are there many beaches at all, or campsites/clearings/firepits on the many islands? A: There are few if any beaches. Most of the small islands have shore lunch staions. No fire rings per say but some have rock fire rings. Q: What's the current like at Dogpaw ""rapids."" Problems for a small boat (or canoe)? Portages? A: There is a dam where Dogpaw enters Regina Bay LOTW. You can't boat from LOTW to Dogpaw. You might be able to canoe. It would be about 200 metre portage around the dam. Q: I've read that Caviar is excellent for bass; what about other species? Any great spots/techniques to share? A: Dogpaw and Caviar are excellent for smallies. I'm not sure of Large Mouth. Both lakes are primarily Northern Pike, Lake Trout. No Walleyes to speak of. It's been a while since I was there so I wouldn't be of much help on any spots. We mostly trolled #9 Shad Raps and Risto Raps. Black/gold and clown color. Q: Are depth maps of these two lakes available in Sioux Narrows? Anybody got 'em in .jpgs? A: I don't think there are any depth maps. Certainly no digital maps. No GPS marked maps. If this is your first time on the lake, you might be well off to stay at one of the camps. One I know of is Jim's caviar Camp. The other further east I don't know the name."
538010,Guest,2004-03-09 13:47:00,0,"WOW!! Great information, and such a quick response. Thanks! By Dogpaw rapids I meant the current in the narrows between Caviar and Dogpaw. The 1:40,000 CHS map indicates current/rapids. I guess the ""landing"" is not too great for launching a big boat that easily. Perhaps a canoe trip is more in order. If one pays the Chief for parking, is there also a charge (how much?) for simply launching a canoe (or boat), with a pickup later? If anyone knows? It would save the paddle across Regina Bay and the portage. Yes, I know it's lazy of me. :) I'm considering an early-May canoe trip (~two weeks+) to Atikwa Lake via Dogpaw, Caviar and Waterfall Lakes. I figure the water will still be cold enough for relatively shallow Lakers and Pike; any idea of how active the Smallmouths might be at that time?"
538012,River_eye,2004-03-09 16:17:00,1486,"Totem lodge portages their boats in there, 20' with 115 hp motors, so boats up to that size at least shouldn't be a problem. Navigation would be an issue, as there are no good maps of the lake. One of the most experienced guides ripped the gears out of his bottom end last year."

A: The flow between Dogpaw and Caviar is not so much of a rapids. There is nice flow through there but nothing to be concerned about navigation wise. When the ice goes out in spring there is enough current to affect navigation. Jim's camp takes their pontoon through with many barrels of gasoline and they have some stories to tell. We have caught some nice pike right in that area. Q: I guess the ""landing"" is not too great for launching a big boat that easily. Perhaps a canoe trip is more in order. A: The launch is ok for even the bigger boats. Like the other response noted, Totem puts their big cruisers in. Q: If one pays the Chief for parking, is there also a charge (how much?) for simply launching a canoe (or boat), with a pickup later? If anyone knows? It would save the paddle across Regina Bay and the portage. Yes, I know it's lazy of me. A: The charge is for parking. If you simply launch a canoe and don't park you likely won't see anyone around. It would still be best to offer to pay. There are one or two houses near the launch. Q: I'm considering an early-May canoe trip (~two weeks+) to Atikwa Lake via Dogpaw, Caviar and Waterfall Lakes. I figure the water will still be cold enough for relatively shallow Lakers and Pike; any idea of how active the Smallmouths might be at that time? A: I'm not sure where Waterfall lake is. Is that west of Atikwa? From Caviar to Atikwa would be a very long, rough portage. Early May will have great shallow pikle action. Lakers should be good too. Smallmouth, I don't know that might be early for them. They could be schooled up in deeper water."
