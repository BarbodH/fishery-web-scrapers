537649,Guest,2004-02-22 07:28:00,0,"Went on our first trip to the Witchbay area last year and got a nice size walleye 27"". Now I'm hooked and want to concentrate on how to find the bigger fish in this area. I want to go after big walleye and northerns. What tackle (rods, reels, line lures, etc.), structure and areas do you recommend? We will be going up in mid June. Thanks for any advice you can give."
537652,Guest,2004-02-22 19:09:00,0,Not real sure where to look that time of year. I fish Lobstick Bay area that time. I know Shore Island (south of Witch bay) is good in June. Check out justfishontario.com w/ Phil & Marv. Phil will definately fill you in!! Dennis
537898,budphilly,2004-03-03 10:49:00,1,"I would check out the bays and the humps that are close to main lake shorelines as the fish have not hit their summer strides quite yet. I would look for humps or reefs that top out shallow and have splines coming off them. Husky Jerks and my favorites, Shad Raps do a nice job there. Shallow hump fish are usually bigger. Do neglect the Shore Island Area and also Riches Bay.:P"
537902,Guest,2004-03-03 12:46:00,0,Bud: Would you troll or cast the cranks and if so would use recommend regular monofilament or one of the special lines. I am a newbie and it is a little confusing to me. Thanks
537914,Guest,2004-03-04 07:06:00,0,"I fished out of Witch Bay in the third week of June a few years ago, and there were still plenty of nice sized fish (24""+) in Witch Bay on the points, and in the island complex just as you go past Clam Island into Andrews Bay. We caught some of the bigger walleye jigging in those spots, but trolling a shad rap (SR-7 or larger sized) along the west shore of Clam produced some nice fish for us in the evenings. Our biggest walleye on that trip came off the SW side of Bunn Island which is down toward Shore Island with a bottom bouncer. That spot is ""known"" to be a big fish spot, but you usually don't catch numbers of fish off of it. We caught some nice fish off of some of the other islands out in the ""big lake"" area with bottom bouncers. As far as crankbaits go, casting or trolling seem to work equally well that time of year. While we did not catch any big fish casting jigs and shad raps shallow, we did catch lots of walleye and smallmouth, a few northern and even a small muskie doing so. One morning after fishing the points and humps in the main lake area with decent luck, we decided to cast some shoreline for bass before having shore lunch. We pulled into a small west facing sandy bottom bay and proceeded to catch over 40 walleye in the matter of an hour or so casting jigs up into 3 to 4' of water. At one point I caught fish on 12 straight casts. I know it sounds like a fish story, but its true. After having shore lunch on the point of the bay, we went back to the same spot and caught another dozen or so. None of the fish were over 18"", but most were in the 15"" to 17"" range. Lots of fun."

Can you tell me what size/color of line you used or if line color makes any difference. Thanks,hoosier."
537941,Guest,2004-03-05 07:05:00,0,"When walleye and smallmouth fishing, I almost always use a medium action spinning rod with a Shimano reel spooled with 8 lb Trilene XT in the greenish color. For reels, I prefer the rear drag models so I can more easily tinker with the drag when a fish is on. I usually have an extra spool of 6 lb test line in the Trilene XT in clear color in case the water is very clear (not usually the case on most areas of LOTW) or if the fish are in a negative mood and I need to down size. Last 4 trips to LOTW, I haven't even pulled out that 6 lb test spool. I have used the spiderline, fireline, and other similar super lines in the past, and while they are great for sensitivity while jigging, and they are great. For some reason, I have just migrated back to the mono line. I guess the mono is a little easier to use. You're going to love your trip. Good luck."
537970,Guest,2004-03-07 07:02:00,0,Thanks for all the info. I picked up that nice walleye last year in Bottle Bay trolling a rapala. How long of a boat ride do you think it is from Witchbay Camp to Shore Island? I guess I'm a little intimidated by the distance and don't want to get lost. Can you recommend a good map for this area? I did hear some good news from Gail at Witchbay. They have gotten alot of snow this winter and expect the water level to be close to normal as long as the people in charge of the Dams don't mess with the water too much.
537978,Guest,2004-03-08 06:43:00,0,"Wingmann -- The boat ride down to Shore Island isn't bad. In the camp boats, I would estimate it at 30 minutes or so. But, I usually hit spots along the way, so the only time I might do it straight through would be heading back to camp at dinner time. For navigation, get the Canadian Hydrographic map -- I believe it is #2612. It is by far the most detailed and accurate. In addition, it has medium shade blue color for depths 12' and shallower, which helps visually pick out structure, food shelves, etc. If you are tenative about navigation, follow one of the ""pros"" out a time or two, and you will be much more comfortable. If you want do so some long-line trolling closer to camp, try the deep weed edge in Riches Bay, and as I mentioned before, the South and West sides of Clam Island in the evenings. Both produce nice fish (24""+) regularly."

We were there last year mid July and had our best luck jigging by the markers just out of the bay 3 of us got 25 nice fish one day ranging from 23-30"". 1 Muskie in the evening. Good Luck There"
