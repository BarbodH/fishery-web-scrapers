2383289,Pikeslayer8,2014-01-25 08:39:00,1460,"No matter what obstacles we've had to overcome, never had a bad trip. The absolute worst situation for us fly-in guys is getting weathered out of our flight into camp. I've been extremely lucky in that it's only happened a few times to my group and we always made it into camp with a somewhat abbreviated trip. I'm pretty sure the flood of 1993 was the first time we got weathered out for a couple days. It was real tough on us as we were all Iowans at that time and we were worried about our homeland. I believe this was the year we took our wives which is another story. The flood that Glenman and Larry S referred to was in 2003 if I remember correctly. We were stuck in the Rendez-Vous in Ft Francis for 3 days just waiting for the weather to subside. My oldest son was about 11 years old at the time just couldn't sit around and he just started being the ""busboy"" in the restaurant. By the end of the 3 days, the wait staff started to tip him out, he was such good help. Lol Other obstacles to overcome were arriving at our camp on Wapikimanski to find that Mr. Bear was there prior to our arrival. He decided that our fridge needed to be thrown through the wall. No big deal as the fishing and comradery were good. One of the bigger obstacles to overcome a few times is to have contaminated gas. Straining gas through MacGyver rigged funneling is not fun but we have always overcome as a group, each man offering something. Part of what makes our adventures so real. Yup, the old adage of you never remember a trip that goes perfect but you never forget the trips where things go wrong."

The car was totaled, I picked glass out of my forehead for 15 yrs, my friend broke his arm & wrist. Spent a day in the hospital in Duluth, then rented a car and returned to Chicago"
2383873,Jigger1,2014-01-25 12:47:00,234,"Even the worst Canadian fishing trip will always rank as one of the best trips ever. Probably the most challenged year was 5 or 6 years ago when the chemistry of the group really didn't work, even with that it was an awesome trip with lots of great memories that we laugh about today."
2384729,Glenman12,2014-01-25 20:35:00,762,luckily after going up for 31 years we've never had a chemistry problem...we've had as few as 4 or as many as 16..that trip it was 4 in one cabin and 12 in the other..
2385401,Ruddiger,2014-01-26 07:44:00,649,"Howdy,Ive been to Canada dozens of times and have experienced great fishing with great operators and bad fishing with outright crooks. All of those trips still conjure happy memories when I look at the photo albums. HOWEVER....The worst trip I ever took was with a former camp operator I had become ""friends"" with. He had never been to a fly in before so we went to one of my favorite lakes so he could finally catch a big pike. For six days we had good fishing and a good time. The last day, however, we went out and I started to crush the big northerns from the back of the boat. He was not (same lures, same spot). It got more and more awkward with each big pike. He went from netting my fish, to reluctantly netting my fish, to not even looking while I landed them by hand. Finally I was feeling uncomfortable and guilty with each hook set. Eventually he insisted on going in to ""eat"" in the middle of the bite. When I suggested one more drift he snapped at me like I was some rotten customer from the old days. At that point we went in as he requested as it wasn't worth arguing.Needless to say the rest of the day, and the 12 hour drive home was pretty icy. I mailed him the photos from the trip and left a gracious message on his phone but never heard from him again. To this day, even though the fishing was great, its my least favorite trip of all time, especially when I look at the photos and am reminded of how it ended.Take care,Ruddiger"
2386377,MrSimon,2014-01-26 12:02:00,922,"I've been really lucky to never have any ""chemistry"" issues .... but then again I'm REALLY REALLY picky with who I invite. I also have two distinct groups of guys I fish with .... no crossover. I have an awesome time with each group, but I wouldn't want to mix them. Its funny, there are two or three guys that I only see and talk to once a year - on the trip. But it totally works and we don't miss a beat."
2386985,Pooch,2014-01-26 15:35:00,4619,"Never had a really bad trip. Some were just better than others. Even the slow trips had their great moments. Wife and I did leave a camp after a few days because I hadn't done enough research and found that there were no walleye on the south end of the lake. (Sturgeon Lake north of Ignace, ON.) Not the camps fault, but they did advertise walleye, but failed to say that the walleye were an hour or so north! Like I said, it was my fault plus a little stretching of the truth on the camps part. That was a very early in my trips lesson never forgotten. I'm fortunate enough to have bunch of very different ""characters"" to fish with. Not sure all of them would be compatible at any given moment. So I kind of dodge co-mingling groups. Love all of them like brothers and want to keep it that way. Each group has it's own sense of humor and ""rhythm"". Some are really laid back while others are pretty intense.I've heard some horror stories on these pages of WC. Interesting thread.Pooch"
2388065,roscoe33,2014-01-26 23:15:00,653,"Let me just say, not everyone that decides to buy a resort, should. Some people should just not be dealing with customers. My only bad trip, was a very very cold week of rain and snow, in August. It was 97 in Madison WI when we left, 37 when we arrived in Ignace. THe fishing was pretty much dead, as was the furnace in our cabin. If you can't fix the furnace, give us a space heater."
2388201,SinOrSwim,2014-01-27 05:46:00,1528,"We have had one bad trip in about 20 years. Went to an all canada show and fell for a sales pitch. Was a person who owned a 5 star resort along with outposts. We went with teh idea the ony thing we needed to bring was our clothes and fishign gear. Everything else will be provided. Food, beer etc. Got up to Ft Francis and while it was sunny where we were, they were socked in where we were going. waited at airport literally all day. Went and got hotel and went back next day. Long delay and finally like 3 planes showed up. Very small so we all split up. We got to the main lodge and were greeted nicely and had a muffin while waiting for rest of group who had mechanical issues. Listened to the owner of the camp absolutely REAM out whoever was on teh other end of the radio making very very negative remarks about people in our group and how they needed to STFU and get on the plane. Then, get out to our lake via boat portage. We had ordered X number of cases of beer. Food was supposed to be provided. WE got tehre and there was like 2 and 1/2 cases of cheap beer and the most random sampling of food you can imagine. Stuff that had been opened etc. Pancake batter, some potatoes, carrots and lettuce. Anyway, we called for more beer and fish batter. They said they were out and were waiting on a shipment. Use the pancake batter for fish. yuck. Sent more beer the next day with some other random supplies and very very little bait. Like a case and 1/2 of beer with a random sampling of different brands thrown together. We went the whole 5 days with very little bait, left over food that was hit and miss and hardly any beer. Turns out he was selling the outposts and we were the last group to use them before the new owner took over. Was an awful trip and it got ugly when we got back. The new owner helped smooth things over and we ended up using him as an outiftter for the next 10 years."
2390665,DMella,2014-01-27 16:02:00,32,"I have said that for years to my kids, and it is true, that the times you ""bite it"" on a trip are the ones you remember clearly and tell stories about.Like my first trip to CA north of Mine Center. We camped - but all we brought for the tent was a large roll of plastic that we fastened to a frame we built out of lashed together bracing logs. It was about 160 degrees in there during the day and once the flies got in the buzzing against the plastic at night was very loud. However, we also portaged a square back canoe and motor to a remote lake and the four of us had the greatest day of pike fishing I have experienced to this day. I love CA"
2391265,TMF89,2014-01-27 17:58:00,77,"Two outfitters come to mind, one we went to once, the other for a few years. We have a group of 5-7 guys that have been going for about a decade and a half. We've been to many different fly-in outfitters, along with a few lodges, fly and drive-in. One year we went through a lodge in Ear Falls, their main camp was on Lac Seul, but they had a drive-to/boat-in cabin on a small lake. So we swung by their main camp, chatted for a bit, and off we went. Well the drive seemed to take forever, down a grass path with trees scrapping the SUV, and some areas we were worried about getting through. Not a huge issue, but it'd take a day or two for them to trim back the growth a bit, if we had to go back I have no idea how we would have done it. So we get to the area where we park and bring our stuff to the boats. That was about a hundred yard hike through very crappy mud, with only a few logs thrown down as bridges. Again I know rain happens and it's rustic up there, but getting our boots/socks/pants mud-soaked just to get to the boats wasn't ideal. Oh and when we got to the two boats, they were both underwater, like literally. I don't know how we got the motors to start, but we started one and got across the lake. The cabin was tiny, no water or electricity, just bunks on one side and kitchen on the other. Again not a deal breaker, but by far the smallest we've stayed in. It was in a great location though, right next to a beautiful set of rapids. Well we fished the lake for a few days, I don't think we found a spot deeper than 20 feet or so. No real rocks or anything that would point to a decent walleye population. We got so sick of it that we actually went back a couple days early. To the main camp's credit, they did put us up in a cabin and gave us boats to fish Lac Seul for a day or two. My problems with this trip were all workable and mainly the fault of the weather. Having said that, I think they should have kept the trail better, and it was literally the worst fishing I've ever had in Canada. Next oufitter was one we've been doing for a few years, fly-in trips, and they're pretty cheap compared to other places we've gone. Every time we've gone through them they've flown us out late. Most of those times we could see the weather was crap, but towards the end of each wait they would always talk about how the weather was poor in the directions the cabins we were going to were, while other outfitters flew planes out, apparently they just had incredibly bad luck...My problem with their handling of the weather was that they would send staff home early, so when a window to fly appeared, we'd have to wait for a pilot to show up, which of course took forever, if it happened at all. One year the only reason we flew out was because the guy in line behind us threatened to take his business elsewhere, as he had his own cabin and just needed to charter a plane. They had to fly us out or they'd lose his regular business.Every year they picked us up late, which caused problems ranging from ""We could have been fishing!"" to showing up home seven hours late and losing sleep before work the next morning. Again the tardiness COULD be from legitimate reasons, and last year was. The fires going on up there threatened some of their camps, and they had to fly people around to evacuate certain camps. That's understandable, but the way they went about it wasn't. The cabin next to ours (two cabins on the lake) had a sat phone and called them. ""Hey this is ________ lake we're just wondering how late you guys are gonna be, is everything alright?"" ""It'll be awhile!"" Click. It was a few hours after that, and they wasted our time by using one plane to fly gas barrels and garbage out. I realize it makes sense to save money, but when you have waiting guests you put that crap off until later in the week. The icing on the cake was the pilot of our plane flying further away from our outpost to pick up another party at a different lake. We arrive, and as they walk up to him on the dock, he jumps out and shouts ""Don't even ask!!"" as they obviously want to know why the plane is so late. Just straight up rude. Well that rant was very cleansing, thanks to the original author for starting this thread! lol"
2392633,big popi,2014-01-28 05:37:00,635,"Since I started going up with Mom & Dad back in '72, the ""worst"" trip I had was back in 1996. I had finally got my first Lund, a sweet S16 with a 25 Rude on the back. I had just refurbished the trailer, new paint, lights, tires and side guides. We had planned for a 2 week trip. Well on the 2nd day my boy (who was 12 at the time) and I went to do some smallmouth fishing on a lake about 15 minute drive from camp. Well, as is typical in July a wicked T-storm came up on us. we put our heads down and headed back to the launch. As we got closer to the ramp I could see my Chevy van through the torrential rain, but no trailer. I beached the boat and looked around, thinking maybe it came unhooked or something, but nope someone decided they liked it better than I did. So, since the rain was letting up, I told the boy to keep the boat running and stay just off shore until I got back from camp. I went back to camp, talked to my Dad and we went to the camp owners and asked to borrow a trailer. They were gracious in letting me use their trailer (used it for the duration of the trip) and just then decided to mention that there was a rash of thefts around the area, specifically trailers. We went back, picked up the boy & boat (he caught a few while waiting, gotta love him!). So after calming down some and a few hours scouring backroads for the stashed trailer, I decided to launch the boat & fish for a few hours on the lake the camp is on. I normally fish another lake about 10 minutes away, but I just wanted to relax for a while. I backed the boat down and hit a dip in the ramp. Well the back tires were almost underwater at this point and spun a little. My Dad coaxed me to back a little further to get some traction, NOT a good idea! Basically, I could touch the water from the drivers seat in my full-size van. My Mom took video of me getting pulled out with the camp owners 4x4, when I open the back doors it had to be 200 gallons of water pouring out. Luckily she was far enough away not to hear the string of F-bombs I was spewing. Well, I almost left that day but decided to try & fish another day. Good thing because even though it rained much more than normal, the walleye fishing was some of the best we had since I was kid. It seems like all these trials & tribulations are just good stories after you get over them."

2392673,big popi,2014-01-28 05:57:00,635,"Juls, Dad had the same model S16, so we cut some 2x4s for spacers, took out everything & clam-shelled my boat on top. That's the way my Grandfather always hauled his S14 & S16. I worked great, luckily those boat (it was a '78) were really light. I lifted the back and Dad, Mom & my wife were on the front end (I am 6'4"" 350+) not problem."

2396801,pjshorthorn,2014-01-28 21:13:00,5654,"Yup, my grandfather did the same thing hauling his boats. Unfortunately he believed that this was a ""great"" way to haul all of the gear regardless of the overall weight. On my first trip to Canada, somewhere around Orr, MN we stopped for a creature comfort break at a bait shop and noticed the trailer was a little ""off"" ....... couple of welds were broken. The bait shop owner knew a fella in the woods who was able to weld the trailer back together and made a couple of other improvements to get us back on the road heading north. Wouldn't take a dime for the effort. In this case that bait shop owner saved our bacon. To this day I make it a point to patronize the small business owner as they are typically in the game for the right reasons...."
2408257,chrismo,2014-02-01 08:52:00,22,"in my 20+ years of going north i have had a few bad trips but it has never been about the fishing. in the early years we would try a new resort or lake every year and we had our share of really bad accommodations. on more than one occasion we actually left the resort after seeing that our cabin was either full of mice or was falling apart. on one trip there were so many mice in the cabin that they were in our boxes/bags of food before we were finished unloading the truck. on another trip the bathroom was an add-on to the cabin and there was a gap in the wall where it connected to the main cabin, you couldn't go to the bathroom without getting bit by hordes of mosquitoes. it's a shame that resort owners don't want to be completely upfront with you on the condition of their resort and then you have to find out about it after driving 1000 miles. after those early years if we ever stayed at a new place we always asked for references so that we could talk to past guests ourselves. if you don't find pictures of their cabins (interior) on their website or brochures definitely ask for references or for additional pics. that has saved us a lot of problems more than once. i dont need anything like the taj mahal but it does need to be livable. just my opinion"

Funny how it was always the last day there and the realization that I had to leave came over me. I've enjoyed all the trips, even the ones when the weather was bad, the fishing was terrible, or the camp may have fallen short of expectations. Just being able to be there makes it a success."
2409177,Downrigger,2014-02-01 15:41:00,60,"Married in 1992. Bought 1st bass boat in 1995. Bride (2nd marriage for both of us) had never been on a two week vacation, and to my good fortune it turned out she loved to fish. Desiring to provide her with a 1st class trip during 1995 (and myself), got on internet exploring lakes and lodges in northern Minnesota. Settled on a lodge on Leach lake and phoned the owner explaining my plans, was sent a video showing the layout, cabins, dock facilities, lodge/bar/library, etc. Having done considerable (?) homework booked a 2 week period, American Plan, and sent deposit. Both very excited.Our log cabin - etched in our mind forever - turned out to have been built in the year 1900 as a one room unit. Over time a lean to addition to the front was added housing the kitchen/dining area. Apparently when they discovered plumbing (got rid of outhouse) added a lean -to shower/toilet. Being yet fairly newly weds, requested a queen size bed with the unit. !st the bed - turned out it was 2 singles pushed together, but did have a single headboard. Won't comment on how we discover there were 2 beds. Now the shower - before we were finished showering we were standing in soapy, we hoped, water over our ankles. We asked to be transferred to another unit, but was told the reservations were booked and none available. Not all was bad. The owners son was a bonifide chef and the evening meals which they allowed us to choose were outstanding and daily packed lunches of our choosing were great. The fishing on Leach was so-so the first week, so the 2nd week explored other lakes in the area and ended up doing well. I am blessed I partnered with such an understanding person, as she still claims it was a great time, and laughs about ending up on the floor. The following year we discovered NW Ontario, and have only missed one year since then, exploring LOW. Eagle, Lac Seul - NW(Ear Falls) an SW(Sioux Lookout). Booked for Sioux Lookout this year and anxious. All's well that end well!!"
2410401,tv4fish,2014-02-02 06:01:00,2694,"AH - another ""rustic"" cabin story. On one of our trips to the Sioux Lookout area we decided to do a ""boat-in"" to an outpost camp. Pull up to the boat launch area - off load all our gear from the Suburban to the boat (and we seemed to have plenty for 3 guys). Follow the rest of the caravan to the outpost camp (about a 1 hour boat ride). As we pass through all this ""new"" water, we see great fishing spots. Get to the camp and it's pretty full. We get directed to our cabin - Cabin No. 5. The thing had to have been designed for midgets, as the door height was about 4 1/2 feet. Every time we had to go in or out - you either ducked your head or banged your head. For heating there was a stove in the center of the cabin in a dirt circle. For friends, we had numerous mice who liked to make their presence known ALL night - anybody else that can relate to mice getting into a bag of potato chips at 2 a.m? The ""crowning"" item - a V.I.P. cabin next door that had a generator running all night! That trip was one where EVERY day it rained like a banshee. Needless to say, we have not been back. It is the trip fondly referred to as - ""When we stayed in rustic Cabin No. 5""."
2410561,packpro,2014-02-02 07:18:00,695,"Numerous transportation issue i.e. Water pump, blown tire, forgot to pay for gas (Did you pay, no I thought you paid), out of gas on 105, drinking gas while siphoning (thank you milk and Pepto Bismol.), missing a turn and running down a rail road track just outside of Fort Francis, etc. Then the weather. We always go second week of June. One year 5 straight days over 95. We had 12 guys in an undersized cabin that year. The very next year, average temp for the week around 40F. Lots of wind and sleet mixed in. Some motor failures, and water in the gas once after a portage. Small boats, big waves and a camp owner who didn't fish the lake his camp was on. The bad compared to the good is just a drop in the bucket.. In the moment the events are aggravating. From a distance, lots of great stories came from those circumstances, and we would go through them double for the great times, laughter, and camaraderie of that week. The peace of mind offered up by a week in the Canadian Wilderness trumps any of the miniscule events that may occur."

Over fifty years and only a few times have we had a DUD on our trips. Just don't take one guys recommendation on a guy, must be known to multiple members and never let one of the guys bring a client or a business client.

Their guide, a native who likely never spent much time out of the bush, was taking them out for there 1st morning fish. They came across a cow moose and calf swimming across the lake. The couple was thrilled with their good luck and so was the guide but, for very different reasons. The guide moved the boat in close to the calf and the couple started to snap some wonderful pics for the folks back home. The guide, he picked up a paddle and started whacking the calf over the head...he wanted to share some tenderloin with the folks back home. The woman was screaming and the guide was a little confused but continued till the calf was dead. The woman was so traumatized the lodge had to fly her out that morning. I recall the lodge owner trying to explain to the guide why the woman was upset but the native fellow just couldnt quite understand....he walked around with a silly grin confused but quite proud of himself, receiving several pats on the back from the other guides.We ate tenderloin that night. City culture....bush culture."
2424609,v-bay gord,2014-02-06 10:23:00,3168,"There's ""city culture"", ""bush culture"" and ""reserve culture"".....you are talking the latter. Most who live in the ""bush"" have a different perspective than what you are describing. Killing an animal with a paddle is stupid in any culture.

I'm sure it was a horrific site to the couple who appreciated seeing the wildlife in it's natural element. A wondrous site for ""city folk"", who don't get to see that kind of thing every day.

It occurred an a very remote fly in....hundreds of miles from the nearest urban center. I doubt the guy had ever seen a city in his life. You wanna beat everyone that displays ""ignorance"" in this world according to our standards.....go ahead but get an early start....you gotta lifetime of swinging.I found the whole episode rather interesting as it truly reflected,albeit it in a most dramatic fashion, differences in norms between two cultures.

The wife and son didn't want to go because it had been raining for the last couple of days and they didn't want to make the portage through the woods because the trail was muddy but I talked them into it with the promise of excellent fishing. We found the logging road and drove down about a mile until it stopped and we could see the small foot trail that we would walk to the lake. I parked the truck next to a puddle of water and when we got out of the truck the hundreds mosquitoes immediately attacked us. Not to worry because I brought the bus spray. I saturated the wife and stepson with bug spray and then turned the can on me........empty........the only thing I could do was put my rain gear on over my T-shirt & shorts and make the 3/4 mile hike through the very humid' hot woods. It was the end of august with the temp that day pushing 95 with no breeze. I think I lost 5 pounds on that walk. We put the boat in and the fishing was slower than slow and the wife and son were ready to go back so I told them just a few more casts. I was using the small outboard as a trolling motor and somehow I managed to get my fishing line wrapped around the prop. So I stopped the boat a half mile from shore and lifted the small motor up to remove my fishing line. I took my needle nose pliers and removed the cotter pin to take off the prop, my wife said ""be careful, don't drop the prop in the water"" and I looked at her and said, do you really think that I would be so stupid as to drop the prop in the.............plop! The look on both their faces was priceless, I was glad the fillet knife wasn't in the boat, I think they would have used it on me. There was dead silence for a few seconds and then I let loose with every curse word that had been invented. At the end of my rant I finished it off by throwing the needle nose pliers as hard as I could.........right into the bottom of the boat. The 3 of us sat there looking at each other in disbelief as a 6 inch fountain of water shot up out of the new hole that I put in the boat. My wife looked at me and uttered "" I told you so"" again, good thing no fillet knife, I thought the safest thing to do was get away from them so I jumped in the lake and pulled the boat back to shore. On the walk back to the car not a word was said and I was taking up the rear with all of the fishing rods and junk with both hands full wearing my rain suit in 90+ weather and I slipped and fell flat on my butt in the mud on the trail......they never even stopped, didn't even turn around.........that trip cost me over 3 hundred bucks to fix the hole in the boat and a new prop, not to mention thousands of dollars of hurt to my pride. Stay well"
2392977,tv4fish,2014-01-28 07:31:00,2694,"Oh Geez: I have a few --- but, you need to keep in mind that we, like a lot of others, have been going ""North"" for a few years, so ""stuff"" IS going to happen. Our very first trip to Canada -1985 - My 2 buddies and I attend the All Canada Show in Mpls. in Feb. - talk to a resort owner that convinces us that we just HAVE to spend a week at his place as the fishing is great and anyone can catch tons of big fish. We buy into it and head north in June. Upon arrival, the owner gives us a map of the lake with ""hot spots"" marked - N for northerns - W for walleyes - S for smallmouth. We think this is just great and head out on the first day with great anticipation. We get to the first W spot - a big beautiful bay - we hit it hard and nothing! Time to try the next spot - same thing - Nada! The next spot is quite a boat trip down the lake - away we go. Guess what - same result. NOW - we're getting concerned - for 3 reasons - we wonder if the resort owner knows anything - we're low on gas - AND we are now lost! So, there we are in the middle of a big body of water and my 2 buddies are studying our map and then they start arguing about where we ARE and what direction we need to head to get back to camp. Now, it's getting close to dark and things are getting serious. We start scouting out the islands that are around us and are convinced that we ARE going to spend the night on one of them.We decide that we at least need to ""try"" and find our way back (as there are bears around), so we motor up and head in the direction that we think we need to go. We head towards the point of an island that looks familiar and promptly run out of gas. Heck, we didn't have any extra gas, as we were SURE we wouldn't need any. Out comes the bow mount trolling motor (and we hope the battery is still good). We get around the point and what do you know- we see our camp in the distance - YEA !!! We limp in with the trolling motor and all 3 of us kiss the ground when we land..........."
2394433,jimirjr,2014-01-28 12:04:00,1149,"Way back in the early 80's, My ex roomie purchased a New to Him, 22' Bayliner Cuddy with a 350 hp Chevy engine, equipped with a NEW GULL 2hp trolling motor, which he had recently purchased. This thing looks like something from Star Trek . Or a MIXMASTER mixer it has a 1.5 Gal tank on the top of it He talks Me and another buddy into going fishing with Him up to Flaming Gorge Res. Gonna try for some Lake Trout..Okay, we say. We leave mid morning from Denver on Sunday in early May, He driving His 1972 Chevy Van and pulling the Bayliner with Me and My bud in My ½ ton Chev. With a pop-up Camper As we were running late, due to the fact that The infamous Wyoming Winds had torn His new Boat Cover to shreds, We decide to bypass purchasing our fishing licenses in Green River, Wyo. And head to Buckboard Marina, on the lake, which We were told sold licenses. Uhhh That Marina does not have a permit to sell licenses The lady there tells us that We need to go 70 miles down the lake to Lucerne valley marina to get our licenses Okay, its around 5:00, BUT we head South towards Lucerne and get there around 6:30pm. The Bait Shop portion is closed already. Can't but a license. We decide to screw it and just camp for the eve. Of course, we were now all drinking a few cool ones and we were pretty cheap back then, so we tried to search out some free camping spots, somewhere instead of paying $7 a nite at the Lucerne Valley Campground. We find a spot, and set up, and John tells Us he has to buy gas for the boat . WTF? So, we jump in John's Van, start heading the 25 miles back to Lucerne valley. I notice that John is acting really loaded He is actually stammering and shaking pretty bad, after only 4 or 5 beers. I finally realize that He is going into Insulin Shock as he is diabetic I Make him pull over and eat a sandwich with some O.J. He comes out of it quickly. We make it to the Marina and The gas station is closed for the nite.. Un Fk'n believable . Get back to camp around 9pm and decide to just screw it and wake up early to figure it out.. The next Morn. We decide to siphon gas out of My truck to use in the boat AND .the Gull trolling motor Okay, we manage to get about 3 Gals into the Bayliner and ½ gal into the Gull. John decides He dosen't want to drive back (25m) to the public Launch and He would just launch from the shoreline. Oh Yeah, and skip paying the $5 launch fee. After about a ½ hour of maneuvering, We get the Boat launched, from the rocky, mud shoreline. We drive down the lake and pick a good looking area to fish. Of course, We try to get the GULL fired up and after 45 mins of fk'n with it, Give up John decides to pull the float bowl on the GULL, and blow some dirt out of it. By now, the wind is blowing about 20mph. We pull into a semi-sheltered shore line and pull the bowl Of course, The boat is rocking with every wave that hits it increasing every 10 mins or so. AND, its getting colder. And, of course, John drops the knurled screw that holds the float bowl on, into the water . About 1' deep. We cannot find it after 30 mins We decide to screw it and just try to fish. Its VERY hard to fish from a 22' boat going 3.5 mph as You would all agree. It is now very cold, and blowing about 25 mph from the North . As We run out of gas. Luckily, another fisherman gives Us a tow towards Lucerne marina and the Gas Pumps about 10 miles from where we were, a good 20 miles down from where we launched. We get some gas, just as the snow begins and the wind is intensifying. We head back North towards the launch spot, into 4-5' breakers that are getting bigger as We go. By the time We get near the launch spot, there is about 3-4s of snow on Us, the boat, AND the shoreline . Somehow, John gets the trailer down the Hill, and I get the Boat kinda loaded on the trailer Then . We can't get His Van up the slippery, muddy, snow encased hill. I had to go up and walk about a mile back to my truck (4 wheel drive) and chain up His Van, Boat and trailer and pull it all out I'm starting to lose momentum as we crawl up the snowbound hill and John decides to gun His Van, throwing mud, rocks and snow all over his Bayliner.. inside AND out busting out a portion of the windshield on The Bayliner to boot. And, there is probably 5s of snow on the ground by now. We spent that nite drinking whiskey and beer in my pop-up and decided to give it up the next morning and head home. BUT, We didn't We spent two more days at SEMINOE RES. In Wyoming But, that's another hairaising, costly, adventure to be told another time....."
2394737,Simple Man,2014-01-28 13:25:00,92,"Not sure how anyone can be on a lake in Canada and not have a good time...regardless of the bite or weather! If the fishing is tough and the weather sucks, drink a bear or twenty and enjoy the fact that your on a trip with your buddies and there is no honey-do list and not a worry in the world! However, some people are always the ""Fun Police"" regardless of how great of a time the rest of the group is having. Unfortunately, sometimes you dont discover the ""Fun Police"" until you're already in the middle of the trip. Best you can do is simply not invite them back. However, once you lock on to the rigth group its a blast and yearly planning becomes simple and automatic."
2394841,jimirjr,2014-01-28 13:48:00,1149,"Well said.... You WILL have a few incidents when North of the border... Its just gonna happen. BUT, its how YOU react to and solve them that makes the trip. I've NEVER had a BAD trip up North... I made it that way..."

2389209,Bassmandpe,2014-01-27 10:38:00,42,"Our group of 8-10 Fathers & sons have been going to Canada for over thirty years. I was usually in charge of finding us a place to go every year. Well one year, several years ago, I selected a well known outfitter out of Cochrane, Ontario. We arrived, boarded our plane to fly out to our outpost cabin. Our pilot was in his seventies and told us this was his last year to fly for the outfitter. We landed and taxcied towards our cabin, where was the dock? It was in the water, so I proceeded to jump out and pull the dock up and secured it the best I could. That was our first clue! The cabin door was wide open and mice could be seen running aound inside as we entered. My Dad started cleaning and sweeping out the place. We learned the pilot was in charge of the cabin and he had not been there once this year. Now we were not arriving the first week of the season, it was the middle of July. The boys were about twelve this year and loved to go exploring. They took off and went down a river for most of the next day. Darkness came and no boys, I could hear my wife questioning my intelligence. Finally about midnight they came back. Next day we sent them out to get firewood, it was cold at night. They proceeded to chop down a dead tree nearby. Problem was the tree fell on the outhouse! yep, right on top of it. Had to rebuild it. We had plenty of motors but few of them worked. The ones that did took about a dozen pulls. But to this day, ask the boys of their favorite Canada trip? it was this one. Make the most of every trip and enjoy your friends and the beauty of Canada. No, we never mentioned the problems to the outfitter, we just never went back to this place. We still go, now twice a year to the same two places. Com'on springtime!"
2382177,MrSimon,2014-01-24 18:13:00,922,The one thing I simply won't do anymore is stay at a camp with an audible 24/7 generator. I go to Canada to escape noise and distraction ... hearing a diesel motor constantly is a deal breaker for me.
2382201,Carnhzkr,2014-01-24 18:27:00,964,"That's a good point. But evidently, not all generators are created equal. I was at Camp Narrows on Rainy last year and they run a big diesel generator 24/7 and I never heard it. It's down, secluded from the lodge. Come to think of it, the lodge I'm flying into this summer runs a 24/7 generator. I'll have to ask about that."
2382225,mudpusher,2014-01-24 19:09:00,248,"Only bad trip was when a trailer came off the hitch, jackknifed the truck and slammed a jersey barrier. Totaled the truck and boat. No one seriously hurt. And we caught lots of fish! Memories for a lifetime."

2382593,Larry S,2014-01-24 21:03:00,665,I remember driving past all the cars parked from the people flying in underwater at Nestor Falls What a Horrible thing to come out of a fly-in and find your car underwater
2382833,ftfarms,2014-01-25 03:02:00,444,Hers a bad trip. Truck motor blew up around osseo wi. Tire on boat trailer blew around nester falls got a big spoons treble hook in my hand. Big wind and massive rain took tent and cook tent and destroyed them both on the way home blew anther boat trailer tire put the other boat trailers spare on and than the lug bolts broke while driving down the road had to find parts on Sunday to fix the mess finally got home. But the walleye and smallmouth fishing was awesome.
2382929,pjshorthorn,2014-01-25 05:37:00,5654,"1996 - Started to head north for opening week and when we hit Duluth, Lake Superior was still frozen solid. Uh fellas, we have a small problem. Got to the houseboat outfitter and Lac Seul was a skating rink. Supposed to leave the dock on Friday afternoon -no go. Saturday night around 2 am a big blow comes through and literally tosses us out of our bunks. Nothing like a 75ft tin can tied up to a dock beating the heck out of you. Didn't leave the dock till Tuesday and then only made it 1/3 way up the lake dodging ice the whole time. Next day made it halfway to our desired destination and gave up......beached the HB at Taylor Island. Fished that afternoon and didn't have one bite... Finally made it up to the area we wanted to be at on Thursday and found good fishing just long runs in our boats back and forth. Got about 2 days of fishing in on a 7 day trip. We stopped going on opening week. I'd rather watch ice form in the fall than wait for it to go out in the spring. PjShorthorn"

2383049,gordy28,2014-01-25 06:56:00,437,Our first trip was a tough intro. Left Toronto and it was 18 degree short weather By the time we got to our destination it was 5 degrees and dropping. For the week it rained or snowed most days We were new to the lake and the lodge was fine but on its last week before winter shut down so for fishing help we felt like we were on our own. On 3rd day we fished are through rain and snow and got on a good small mouth bite. A few gentlemen in the camp took pity on us (or were impressed w our doggedness) and pulled out there map and marked a bunch of spots for us that night. Didn't exactly light it up but it got better and it's a fond memory not a negative one
2383065,tooski,2014-01-25 07:33:00,393,2009-Headed to Nakina. At 4 AM the wife swerves to avoid a moose. Van flips end over end and rolls twice. Somehow ends up sliding down the hi-way with my foot under it. Spent three days in Geraldton hospital with fractured back and ankle. Wife and three sons miraculously with only minor injuries. Still one of our favorite trips to talk about.
2381473,LOW1,2014-01-24 14:38:00,2828,"No bad trips. A few unfortunate events/decisions, such as not bringing invoices for items brought through customs, telling people to call me for work if they wanted to, and Minnesota's unending construction on I35. But the good certainly far outweighs the bad. I think that for anyone who likes to fish that (except for tragic accidents or other such events) it has to be hard to have a bad trip to Canada."
2381545,Lovetofish,2014-01-24 15:12:00,458,Quite a few years ago we were on the road north and my friends fiberglass boat caught fire. A complete loss and it had all our gear in it. You could see black smoke for miles. That set us back a couple hours. We were lucky to not burn up the tow vehicle or start a forest fire. Also lucky we all had our clothes and food in the vehicle. We continued on and stopped at a sports shop and bought what we needed to fish and rented a boat at the camp we were at. We still had a good trip with a fond memory.
2381641,Larry S,2014-01-24 15:32:00,665,"In the late 90's a friend's son asked me to go on a trip for 2 he had won to an American Plan Lodge on the largest lake in Saskatchewan. My friend doesn't fish. The first day at the lodge we were given a 15yr old Indian guide who promptly got us lost for half the day. When we returned to the lodge we requested a new guide, the owner said Sorry the lodge is full, there are no more guides, and I don't want to upset any of the other guests. The next day we were told the young Indian would follow his uncle ,after lunch the uncle told the young Indian to stop following him We caught fish the rest of the week ,but were still motored around too much, and again got lost several times. We complained every day to the owner , but he just blew us off. Later we found out that the owner had sold his camp, this was the last season. He had bought another camp in Manitoba and didn't want to upset the larger groups by saddling them with this incompetent guide Anyway I got a free trip which should have been a lot better fishing wise and after the way we were treated by this owner I told everyone I knew and all the fishing websites about the poor treatment. I will Never go to this persons Lodges as he now owns several lodges with his son."

Not long afterwards I received a confirmation of our trip in the mail.Two days before our trip in July I was attempting to call said outfitter to touch base. Finally got through to him and he said that he had no record of our booking. The issue was that he bumped my group of two out of the slot for a larger group of six.At first he wasn't going to do anything, then in the end he offered one of his other camps to us instead for the same time frame. It wasn't my first choice but beggars can't be choosers.I know for a fact he never would have called me himself and that if I hadn't reached him just before our trip we'd have arrived at the airbase to a very nasty surprise.Anyhow it gets better. We were scheduled to fly out of our new lake on a Wed. He said to us please take the motors off the boats and pull the boats out of the water Wed morning, and have all your stuff waiting on the dock ready to go.Well Wednesday rolled around and we did as he asked. It was a beautiful bluebird day perfect for flying.Well guess what? We weren't picked up until Friday at noon, two full days later. We were literally losing our minds LOL!Pilot apologized and told us our outfitter had called and rebooked our flight for Fri because he had another flight in the same area and wanted to avoid a deadhead flight. He did this with no way of telling us of the change.Top that LOL!"

2381993,Carnhzkr,2014-01-24 17:11:00,964,"I've been on several trips that, at the time, if any one of us could have twitched our nose and been magically transported home, we would have done it in a second. There was the trip when we headed across Lake Umfreville and pitched an old canvas tent on an island near Kettle Falls. The wind came up on the first night and swamped my dad's Merc 50. He worked on it for a couple days and couldn't get it going. I remember my mom crying and my dad talking about erecting a sail on the boat in hopes he could get to the middle of the lake and flag someone down. Eventually, he managed to get someone's attention and they got word to old man Halley of Halley's Camps. He towed us back in and didn't accept a dime for payment. Another year, we came back from a tent trip on Cormorant Lake in northern Manitoba. After loading our gear for the trip home, we headed down a rut-lined dirt road. We hadn't gotten 3 miles when a large wooden plank took out our gas tank. Someone had used the plank to unstick a stuck vehicle and left in the road for us to find. We were miles from the nearest town. I remember my dad in a panic trying to think of a way out of this mess. Eventually he put the five gallon outboard tank in the trunk and ran the fuel line to that tank. We made it home, about 800 miles, with a five gallon tank. There've been a few other trips that we would have ended in a second if we could've. The funny thing is that now, those trips are priceless. Those are the stories we tell over and over. Every time I go back to the farm, I hear my mom begin, remember the time when  Yes mom, I remember."

We booked the same week for the second year. 10 inches of snow on the ground and cold, even with the proper clothes I about froze to death. From that time on I go on the fifth week of the season.

Even though there are different ways of doing things, everyone seems to have a great time and wants to go back ASAP. And typically, people could change their habits on just about any of the things mentioned and still have a blast. Just out of curiosity though .... are there certain types of trips that you just plain don't like. Is there something that you just simply won't do? Has something happened on a trip that was so bad you refuse to do it again, regardless of how good the fishing is?"

No help to a new group, one even said, we dont like to new groups have a bad time, but he sure didnt offer to help!

I was trying to give my money to a camp during the slow season and couldn't get a reply from many camp owners. I guess in this economy there is so much money rolling north, my $1200 isn't needed. I did have several reply and many provided great information. Hope things warm up soon for most of you. Instead of stealing copper down here in Georgia, bad guys are stealing firewood and reselling.
