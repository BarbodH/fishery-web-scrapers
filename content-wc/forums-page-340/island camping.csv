2522258,roscoe33,2014-03-05 20:19:00,653,"There are areas called ""Green Zones"", which are off limits to non Canadian residents. Here is a map.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodcons...l02_178735.pdf Contact the MNR district office in either Red Lake or Sioux Lookout and get the info directly from the authorities. If anyone has a map or website showing where camping is permitted on Crown land, they will have it. Red Lake 227 Howey Street, Box 5003, P0V 2M0 (807) 727-2253 Sioux Lookout 49 Prince Street, Box 309 P8T 1A6 (807) 737-1140"
2522442,BreezyPoint,2014-03-05 21:10:00,1581,"I believe the area of interest to you is in a green zone. The map noted above is iffy, but looks like that entire stretch is off limits. It is also part of the West English River Provincial Park. This park is listed as a 'non operating park', whatever that means.As a youth (many years ago), I used to camp all the time on the Island in the east end of Wilcox.This is part of the Kenora district."
2523050,Skywagon,2014-03-06 06:49:00,1106,"I just pulled out one of the Kestrel Forestry maps. It clearly identifies the whole Lac Seul system (including the road that goes around the north side of Lac Seul) is all off limits to non-resident camping. I personally think this is a fair rule, as all the other visitors (and locals) fishing this lake, are contributing in a significant financial way to the local economy. In a sense, paying their way for the privilege of using this great Canadian resource."
2526602,Wolfwasp,2014-03-07 00:44:00,9,"Here you go. I learned a little too.

2526610,Wolfwasp,2014-03-07 01:04:00,9,Here is a link to the Provincial map of Green Zone.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodcons...l02_178735.pdfI was sorry to see that Sturgeon Lake is blocked out. It's not a great map. It doesn't show how far back from the lake you have to be. If its just the shoreline I have an idea......
2526618,Wolfwasp,2014-03-07 01:25:00,9,It looks like Sturgeon Squash (used to be Squaw) and Vista. But there is not a big area around them. It might just be the shoreline. I will have to call and ask. Other areas are large enough to tell.
