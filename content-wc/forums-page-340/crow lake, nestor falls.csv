2543545,LundDriver,2014-03-11 17:13:00,30,Wife and I have been going to LOTW in the spring for 25+ years. Have never been over to crow for lakers yet. Can anyone tell me if there is a spring (end of May) bite going on for lake trout? We are looking for a jigging or casting cranks pattern. We don't like trolling and bank/carp fishing is out of the question. Have thought about Whitefish Bay but the last time I saw the trolley at Turtle Portage I would not trust my PRO-V on it. Leaving my truck at a public launch is also out. Is it worth the time and effort (pay to launch at a resort) to go for lakers on crow? We are interested in numbers not size. I have only caught lake trout on Lake Michigan on a charter. Wife has never caught one. Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

One of the most picturesque lakes around. As with your fear of leaving your truck at a boat launch on Whitefish, there is a good launch at Vic and Dots Resort only $10 and very secure."
