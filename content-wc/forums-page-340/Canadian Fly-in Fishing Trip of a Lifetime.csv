That's 9 days of pure adventure on one of the most pristine Walleye & Pike lakes in northern Quebec. We need a fourth fisherman to accompany us because the outfitter requires at least 4 men to occupy this 6 man camp. It's all about the bucks! We can go as 4 or 6; if you have 2 friends that want to fish with you, the cabin sleeps 6 comfortably. The outfitter has a two (2) men in a boat policy for safety reasons. The outfitter has a quality operation and it shows itself at the end of the week after you caught your fill of big walleyes and pike. 20hp Mercury 4 strokes aboard 16 foot Lunds with padded seats with unlimited fuel provided. $1500 P.P approximately this includes food travel, beer etc. Also, the outfitter said this can be a 7 or 9 day trip ending on the 29th of June. Contact 860 402 3209 Ron; E-mail [email protected], or PM me on this site for all the facts."
