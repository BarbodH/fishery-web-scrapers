2524170,LoDo,2014-03-06 10:31:00,721,"Drive further north to Lac Seul. Stay at one of the lodges south of Ear Falls. Lac Seul Lodge, Onaway or Fishermans Cove are good spots. Onaway is 5*! Huge lake, low pressure. Depending on the time of year you may have 20-40min boat rides to Mackenzie bay for big walleye / northern. IMO MacKenzie is the best in early spring with all the current, rivers, water temps, spawning....Either way, you'll have a blast! Have fun!"
2520802,rdunk,2014-03-05 16:01:00,20,Looking for some info on a good resort to go to with our own boat. This will be new to us but we're not new to canada. Prefer to stay close to US-Canada border.( Lake of the Woods/rainy lake)
2520970,nicko,2014-03-05 16:27:00,508,What type of trip are you looking for? Near towns? American plan? Lots of lodges on LOW. What fish do you want to target? Numbers or size? Cost? Do you have kids going? Tons of choices. Nick
2521002,rdunk,2014-03-05 16:35:00,20,"we would like to try lake of the woods. Walleye, muskie, small mouth. Want a housekeeping cabin."
2521042,jiggster,2014-03-05 16:42:00,183,Look at Tomahawk Lodge.
2521074,Hawker,2014-03-05 16:47:00,3967,Check out Young's Wilderness Camp (http://youngswildernesscamp.com/) Everything your looking for and more!!

2521098,nicko,2014-03-05 16:54:00,508,"Ok, Lots of lodges fit that bill. This is our 7 the season fishing LOW. We tend to stick with areas farther from main towns. Tomahawk is a nice place, but it's in up the middle of Sioux Narrows. Lots of pressure in that area so you may have to work to get some spots. I've stayed at lodges in snake bay as well. White pine is not a bad lodge. Small, rustic. But snake bay is not a great walleye bay. Pike yes, walleye no. Some SM but again, you need to work a bit. I'd have a look at Obabikon or some of the lodges out in areas less traveled. Some of the island lodges are a bit more remote and can offer some fishing without taking a 60 minute boat ride. Every time we stayed by Sioux narrows and Nestor falls we fished yellow girl for walleye. It was the only consistent bite. Not saying you won't catch any, but it's just a little tougher with the pressure. We stay at Wiley point lodge on the far west side of the lake. More$$$ but I travel 5 minutes and catch as many walleye as I want any time I want. No boats, no pressure. You can look for similar places out of Morsen too. After fishing out by Wiley, we got spoiled. I just think you're putting yourself in a better position if you stay away from the big crowds. N"
2523650,1700SS,2014-03-06 08:25:00,104,"Morson area. We have been staying at Red Wing Lodge for years. Great place, good price, housekeeping, drive to, close to great fishing. If looking for American plan I would look at Obabikon."
2523786,Gregking,2014-03-06 08:54:00,2658,My LOTW trip is always a ton of fun. Started going to Witchbay camps back in 94. I cannot say enough great things about this place.http://www.witchbay.com/
2523818,Blades-n-Beads,2014-03-06 09:04:00,484,"Gregking, I was going to suggest witch bay but I see you have been there, maybe try Pipestonepoint? It's a boat too resort on a peninsula. American plan or housekeeping. Great people and nice cabins! They run on gen power for the whole camp. Very very reasonable . Maybe 10 miles by water from witch bay"
