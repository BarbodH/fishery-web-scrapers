Take for example the requirement for Canadian Approved life jackets....this would mean most non-residents would be breaking the law by wearing US Coast Guard approved life jackets.......which is not the case. A flashlight is a good idea but not necessarily required if operating a US boat in Canadian waters.

2520394,jimmie,2014-03-05 14:28:00,123,"Last year I stayed a few days at Cedar lake Camp and was told that I needed a flashlight onboard. I only knew of life vest, whistle/horn, throw rope, fire extinguisher, paddle. I serached the regulation book for 2013 ans could not find any mention of needing a flasklight. Any up-to-date info or where to find relevant list would be appreciated. Could not find on MNR site either. Thanks guys! See ya on the water."
2520434,Nimstug,2014-03-05 14:36:00,2605,"If you are taking your own boat and it will be in Canada less than 45 days (I think-some one help me here) and if you comply with you own states requirements for safety equipment you comply with Ontario. That said, why would you not want a flashlight in your boat? It's dark up there! Nimstug...I mean real dark."
2520514,115 optimax,2014-03-05 14:57:00,650,"Yes you need a working flashlight,it has to be floating rope,a bailing can and you only need a fire extinguisher if you have a built in fuel tank.You can buy the legal kit that comes in an orange bailing can @ Canadian Tire for $20.00.Buy it and throw it in your boat somewhere and you won't have to worry about it.And yes they do check for that stuff if you get stopped on the lake."
2520522,wallydave,2014-03-05 14:58:00,2151,"After many trips to Lac Seul, last year I took a second trip to Red Lake, on Red Lake they require a floating flashlight with you on the water. It was not a big deal anyway, Black Bear Lodge is a rustic camp, limited lighting in the cabins, so some extra light was welcome!It is a safety concern, hopefully when we go out for a day of fishing, we can make it back to camp, the light is just a good safety item to have in the boat."
2520578,btyreprich,2014-03-05 15:19:00,1067,"A few years ago, we purchased one of the million candle power spotlight for the boat. It operated by clipping onto the battery posts. Not expensive at all - under $30 I think. This same flashlight has come in very handy changing flat tires late at night on 502! I now see similar lights that are recgargeable. Then again these lights will not float. A DNR officer did not say anything about the flashlight not being a floatable type when we showed it to him."
2520650,v-bay gord,2014-03-05 15:28:00,3168,"Nimstug is correct. You need to comply with the regulations from the State you live in if using your boat in Canada. If they do not require a flashlight....then you don't need one. From Transport Canada's website:Safety Equipment Requirements Foreign pleasure craft (pleasure craft that are licensed or registered in a country other than Canada) need to comply with equipment requirements of the country in which the vessel is usually kept. If you are not a resident of Canada and are using a pleasure craft licensed or registered in Canada, all of the required safety equipment must meet Canadian safety requirements. However, you may opt to bring your own PFD for your own personal use."
2522194,rnnonmt,2014-03-05 20:03:00,992,+1 V-bay. Comply with the regulations for the state that your boat is registered in.**** - I have rented boats on lac seul since 1982 and have yet to see a flashlight onboard the canadian boats.
2522210,rnnonmt,2014-03-05 20:06:00,992,You only need a flasklight if you lose track of your adult beverage!
2523482,yurtman,2014-03-06 07:58:00,46,"Boating regulations are under the jurisdiction of the Canadian government, not MNR. See the following link for hwat is required in your boat. http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety...t_requirements"
2523618,Algoma Guy,2014-03-06 08:21:00,48,From experience I know 100 percent that you need a WORKING waterproof flashlight on board. My recommendation to travellers coming to Ontario with their own boats is like someone already mentioned pick up a safety kit BUT do not throw it in the bottom of the boat and forget about it. Keep it some wear dry and ensure you have working batteries. I know in some states this may be not required but do you really want to argue with an OPP or MNR officer on the water.
