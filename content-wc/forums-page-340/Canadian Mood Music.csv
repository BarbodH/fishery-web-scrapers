For me, it's Gordon Lightfoot. On the occasions when I used to drive north by myself, I used to drop in Gord's Gold and I'd practically be in International Falls by the end of the two CD set. By that time, I would definitely be in the mood for something a little more powerful yet still Canadian, so I'd drop in some Rush to cleanse the acoustic from my brain. Whenever I'm flipping the radio stations and come across a GL tune, I can't help but to think about heading north. This morning, my wife asked me if I wanted a ""Second Cup of Coffee"", and that got me started. I had to fire up ""Song for a Winter's Night"" and ""Alberta Bound"" to keep the mood going. Now I'm all mellowed out. I'd better get Geddy Lee screaming in my ear or I'll never get off the couch today."
