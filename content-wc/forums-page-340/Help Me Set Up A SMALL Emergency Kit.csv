2543449,zeebee,2014-03-11 16:29:00,1144,"A polaroid pic of me with my head bent down as I kiss my *** goodbye.On a more serious note, realize you are not on some far off lunar landscape....its as simple as the lighter being most important. Build a fire. Rescue comes pretty quick. If you are truly out in the middle of nowhere then more will be required but otherwise a fire will keep you warm until you get picked up.Been there done it...referring to being stranded with two young kids to boot. Most important thing is to leave the panic behind...keep your wits. Panic/high anxiety at some level is the first thing that sets in (unfamiliar territory for most of us) until you deal with it. A leadership role, relaxed and confident, will help relax everyone. Most important is to keep your wits and not get excited. Cant emphasize that enough. Good bottle of single malt too. Anything else and they wont take you seriously."
2528890,Sportdog,2014-03-07 13:33:00,6735,"I purchased a water resistant plastic storage box with the ""O"" ring seal snap lid at BPS, to use as an emergency kit container for my boat while in the Canadian outback fishing this summer and hope in the fall too. It measures 10""x6""x4 1/2"". Give me some ideas besides fire starter stuff and a small first aid kit that I could fit in the box that would be useful if I get stranded. I doubt I'll ever need it but I guess it's better to have and not need rather than need but not have. Thanks for the input."
2529354,JOE WALLEYE,2014-03-07 15:09:00,753,A knife and a good flash light. And one of those compact reflective survival blankets
2529386,keek,2014-03-07 15:18:00,1003,"You would want some signaling devises. An old CD makes a great daytime signal device as it already has an ""aiming hole"" in the center like the commercial ones. Also: 6' section of Duct tape wrapped around a secondary light source like a Micro Maglite. Whistle Paracord Roll of Gauze (with this and the duct tape you can cover some pretty nasty injuries or make small bandaids) Water Treatment Pills Compass A picture of a loved one. Seriously. The will to survive is more valuable than a box of stuff."

Carry this with you instead Because if you don't make it , Its going to be some dude like him your wife hooks up with and after her grief is over.And he gets your Toys.....Thats motivation Right there Oh Ya and Fire Small Magnisuim Striker , Chap stick and cotton baton or Que tips and a small metal tin to hold your stuff in and melt water or cook in like a sardine can size ( And you can make a fire anywhere . Also Water Purifier Pills . You need Fire and water don't need food for a long time AND IF YOU DON'T NEED FIRE MAKE IT ANYWAYS VERY COMFORTING IN THE DARK Heres a rule collect what you think you need for the night and then go get that amount 2 more times Most important thing is to accept that your lost , Don't wait to take action Trust me I spend time every year in the Sub arctic ocean environment Be Prepared . No Matter how close to civilization you are. A lot of people run into big problems by thinking they will only go out 5 miles from town or just a day trip Theres more to it than that but get a small survival book to carry. Helps remind you as to what to do if need be"
2529682,prov1800,2014-03-07 16:21:00,5010,"Ive been fortunate to have spent a few unscheduled nights outside in both summer and winter.winter being the most critical and life threatening. Won't get into big details but the most valuable article you can have with you is something that starts a fire, especially in the dead of winter when your sled goes in the creek and your by yourself on a trapline. Summer is not that critical.all the stuff mentioned was great.I mean theres no end to the stuff you could bring along in a boat.as long as you can get to it.other stuff for cuts, hooks, burns, all good.if your ever out on island or shoreline nothing like a fire to look at.just like being out in the back.lol.bugs could ruin your evening so I always carry bug juice.buddy of mine uses wd-40.if your one of those paranoid people rent a sat phone for the week.they has garmin spot units now that will text and sent emails.those would be the ultimate to have as most of the time you wont have cell service.I really don't have those electronics with me.guess I should.iam out there all the time.I do have a cell booster which works great.but at times iam to far away for it to work.so hopefully my batteries have enough omppphhh to get me a few miles closer before they die.but they sure go a long way.always let somebody know where your going so they have some idea where to start looking for you."
