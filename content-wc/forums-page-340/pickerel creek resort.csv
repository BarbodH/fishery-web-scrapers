He had good things to say about the owner - that he was really good at knowing what's going on around the neighboring lakes, and always got them on fish. However, they now use Rainbow Point on Perrault lake instead. Rainbow Point is closer to the ramp on LS and they do well fishing on Perrault, compared to the lake that Pickerel Creek is on. He told me they typically fish Perrault early in the morning, then travel to LS after breakfast. He bragged about the slab perch on Perrault and they did well with walleye too. In summary, according to my buddy anyway, Rainbow Point is cheaper, closer, and better fishing. For whatever that's worth."

2528658,Mrnovice,2014-03-07 12:16:00,75,I have been there twice and I am a terrible fisherman and had luck. I have never been to Canada in Sept so not sure but have been there twice in June and July. I fished the main lake and 2 other lakes that were nearby and had luck. Always heard about the small mouth but never went those lakes. Went for walleye and pike. Go on his website and read his old blogs for the Sept months. He is usually good about updates and tells it like it is. One of the better guys you will meet
