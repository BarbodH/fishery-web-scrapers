1224548,Big Mike,2010-08-02 17:55:00,35,Can't wait either Andy...will be up next week and give you a report. The eyes are really starting to stack up on the reefs it sounds like so should be easy fishing for change in August instead of weedwhacking.
1224679,Guest,2010-08-03 07:16:00,0,"Mike, Hope all goes well the week prior to our arrival for you! We'll be in bright and early on Saturday and hit the water. I stopped by your office last week and asked Mitch if you were around...the reply I got, ""It's summer...you don't see him in the summer."" Priceless. See you in Ontario...Safe travel and tight lines!"
1225325,jsmyers,2010-08-05 11:13:00,198,"Has anybody seen the map/data?How precise is it. If it is just a digitization of the MNR contour map that you can find online for free, then I fear it is of limited use."
1226428,walleyehawki,2010-08-09 21:51:00,21,I just received the Garmin software for inland Ontario lake that included Wabaskang. According to the info that came with the SD it indicated all the contours etc were included. I guess in a couple of weeks I will know if the $100+ that I spent was worth it or not!
2539041,JAY221,2014-03-10 12:37:00,877,"Walleyehawki. I sent you a pm but you can answer here if you like as to your opinion of the software you received as far as Wabaskang is concerned. Thanks, Jay"
1222126,walleyehawki,2010-07-24 21:01:00,21,"Can anyone help me if there is any lake map software available for Wabaskang, Ontario that will work on my Lowrance HDS10 insight? I do not see that it is available on Navonics! Going up there on August 19th, any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!!"
1223284,walleyehawki,2010-07-28 21:55:00,21,"60+ reviews and no replies, it looks like all of us are looking for the SAME ANSWER!!!!!!!!!!!"
1223338,jsmyers,2010-07-29 06:59:00,198,"I was going to reply that the only paper/pdf maps I've seen weren't very accurate or precise, so I'm not sure how helpful an electronic version would be.I didn't figure it was really a productive answer to the question."
1223487,walleyehawki,2010-07-29 15:01:00,21,"Thanks for the reply, I did however find my own answer after doing a bunch of searching. Garmin makes a nautical map for Ontario and Wabaskang is included in the software, but it is only compatible with Garmin products. I have the new Lowrance HDS10 insight, my first thoughts were CRAP, until I checked and found that my Garmin nuvi 305W was on the compatible list. I will be able to make that work even though the screen is pretty small. I sometimes wonder why I bought a Lowrance unit again!!"
1223562,Guest,2010-07-29 18:41:00,0,Verne...is that you? We'll get you on fish buddy...no worries.
1223824,walleyehawki,2010-07-30 14:43:00,21,"andy buff, it is me. I found software on Garmin's website that will work on my nuvi."
1223849,Big Mike,2010-07-30 15:53:00,35,"Hey Andy...how are you? I will try to leave a few in the lake for ya on your end of August trip bud. Is Verne a fellow Jim/Julies person? Maybe you can give him some of your secrets that you won't tell me up at the fish house!!! Later, Mike"
1224051,walleyehawki,2010-07-31 12:32:00,21,"Big Mike, no Andy is our nephew. First time for us at Wabby and he says they will put us on fish. The pressure is on them, he would not want us to come back home and tell the relatives! Just kidding, just being there is enough for us, catching fish is a bonus."
1224067,Big Mike,2010-07-31 16:07:00,35,Sounds great...Andy will show you the ropes! Are you staying at camp with him and his group? Fishing will be excellent that week if you enjoy jig fishing for walleyes!
1224115,walleyehawki,2010-07-31 21:05:00,21,"Big Mike, we will be staying at the Wine Lake outpost located near the falls. I love to vertical jig fish so this should be fun! My twin fourteen year old grandson's think I have more of a jig assortment than Cabela's!If we can find the fish (Andy & Eric's job) we should have everything on board for color and size and I would probably be better off with just plain old jig heads in the 1/4 oz size, but just in case, I do have others!"
