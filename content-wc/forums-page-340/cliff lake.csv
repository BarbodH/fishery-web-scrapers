From what ive heard and experienced on all lakes in the area as well as around dryden and sioux lookou**** all bad unless you have a larger track and larger lugs.this time of the year usually has some of the best fishing and now its going to be hard to enjoy it.hope the ice lifts soon.anybody thinking of coming up might want to think a little later."

It took a handyman jack to lift the machine up, clean the slush out as good as possible, then slip the pallet under. After letting the disturbed area freeze for a day, I went back with a hammer and bar, got all the ice out of the track/tunnel area, then drove the machine out on top of the frozen slush, no problem. Good times. Have been hearing horror stories about slush all last week.Connie, send some of that warm weather up here, we could stand to lose about two feet of this white stuff that is on top of the ice."
