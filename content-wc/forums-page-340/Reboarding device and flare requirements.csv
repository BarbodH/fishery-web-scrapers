2524850,tv4fish,2014-03-06 13:32:00,2694,"Aaron: YOUR story reminded me of our first trip up to Minnitaki - we're cruising along in my boat and my buddy sitting up front had a gust of wind blow his hat off - being the good friend I am, I turned the boat around and came back up upon his hat floating in the water. As I said - he was in the front - he reached over to grab his hat and went completely overboard! My other buddy and I reached out and grabbed him as he went by us and yanked him back into the boat. We did it all so fast that his wallet in his back pocket did not even get the money wet. (And WE can't blame it on any alcohol) !!"
2517994,roscoe33,2014-03-05 01:11:00,653,"How do you all handle the flares requirement? Any trouble getting them across the border? And what about the reboarding (ladder) rule for boats with more than 20"" of freeboard? Many of us have moved up to larger boats over the years, and most fishing boats don't have swim platforms. So what do you use, or carry on the boat? I've had a collapsable rope ladder in the splash well for years. But on the new project boat, I purchased a transom mounted telescoping ladder. Its under 12"" wide, and 16"" long, and fits nicely on the transom of my Starcraft.http://www.ebay.com/itm/291000797953...84.m1439.l2649 Even if not required, how do you plan to get back in the boat in the event of going overboard?https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafet...t_requirements"
2518570,Bill Krejca,2014-03-05 07:33:00,6107,Previous posts on this subject have indicated that non Canadian resident visitors with brought in boats shall have on board the equipment required in the home residence (state). Bill
2518674,fisherman 1,2014-03-05 07:50:00,39,Bill That is correct as long as they do not stay more than 45 consecutive days. If so you require the boating card and all safety equipment required by the Canadian Coast Guard.
2519706,roscoe33,2014-03-05 11:50:00,653,"So, no one has a plan to get back in the boat if they happen to go overboard? If you boat alone, or are larger, or only boat with a couple kids or wife in the boat that can't pull you in, could YOU get back into the boat? I could do it 15 years ago, can't do it now without the ladder . Try it, its not as easy as you think."
2519786,Aaron-IN,2014-03-05 12:09:00,500,Just have the wife throw you a line and then body surf back to the dock. If alone just swim back to shore
2521050,roscoe33,2014-03-05 16:44:00,653,"Yeah, try that from the middle of Lake Erie, LOTW, Winnebago, or Green Bay. No wife, she couldn't swim to shore, and I haven't seen her since."
2521314,balsl6,2014-03-05 17:38:00,426,"I have a swim ladder just for these purposes. Anyone who thinks they can easily get back in a boat should try it, you may or may not be surprised."
2522154,Bill Krejca,2014-03-05 19:59:00,6107,"Remembering back when I started to water ski, it is very difficult to reenter the boat without some kind of ladder, which is the first thing I bought when I realized the amount of effort required. An inexpensive free swinging portable which hooks over the gunnel can work very well. It has been suggested that it is possible, maybe not super easy, but possible, to put your foot on the motor skeg and hit the tilt button. This allegedly will swing the motor up enough to enable a crawl into the boat. If fishing alone, and falling out, just being able to catch up with the boat while in the water on a somewhat windy day is another potential hazard, which just about would require somehow rope fastening oneself to the boat. Bill"

Those work well only if you're willing to leave it hang over the side while your out there fishing, or whatever. I know of a couple of fellas that have these on their boat but I've never seen them hanging over the side. I guess you gotta grab it as you're falling in."
2524746,Aaron-IN,2014-03-06 12:54:00,500,"This thread made me think of a time when my brother in law and I were out fishing, it was early spring in NW Ontario and he had one too many cocktails over dinner. He fell completely out of the boat, I have never seen someone hit the water and be back in the boat so quickly, it was like dropping a housecat in the water. Granted we were younger and in good shape at the time so getting back in the boat wasn't really an issue for him. Still makes me laugh when I think about it."
