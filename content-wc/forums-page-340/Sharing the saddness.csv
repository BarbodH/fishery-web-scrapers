My 6 foot tall daughter tore her ACL National Volleyball Tourney between her freshman and sophomore year in High School. Was a handful of Div 1 coaches there to watch her. Final game tore her ACL, meniscus, inside and out. I haul her off the court, coaches are gone. She get's surgery, re habs, works her butt off to get back to square one, gets a scholarship, team does great, starts her freshman year and team is Nationally ranked. This year she will be a sophomore in college. Calls yesterday, tore her other one playing basketball with the team. Poor thing!! Don't get me wrong, I am well aware there is worse news a parent can get about their child. But the fact I know what she is about to go through again makes water run out of my eyes. In a few years it won't matter. But having something your child loves sooooo much taken away from her is just so dis heartening. Thanks for listening. JohnB.O.A.T."
2546377,johnboat,2014-03-12 11:57:00,2014,See. It's got me so upset that I thought I was in the General discussion board..................................
2546385,MN_Moose,2014-03-12 12:00:00,964,"I've gone through it. I tore up my right knee. ACL, MCL and meniscus. separated the knee cap was most painful. I'm confident your daughter is super competitive. A PA told me only competitive people tear up joints. You might say it will all be passed in a couple years but, the rest of her life she'll have to deal with the pain. Difficult to bend down to pick up her child. etc. I feel for her."
2546505,IaDave,2014-03-12 12:41:00,476,Does she go to Texas? A guy at work his daughter is friends with a girl from Waterloo that plays volleyball at Texas.
2546729,Lovetofish,2014-03-12 13:22:00,458,That happened to my daughter in high school. A three sport athlete she blew her ACL and tore the meniscus warming up for the first volleyball game of the season. Lost her entire senior year. She worked very hard to rehab and she got back on the college court the next fall. I think she did this just to prove she could. After one year she hung up her competitve shoes to concentrate on her studies. Hope all works out for your daughter.
2546953,johnboat,2014-03-12 14:17:00,2014,"Nope. That's Hailey Eckerman. From East High in Waterloo. She played some with her tho and know each other well. Hailey just so happens to be the repeating National Player of the Year for Division 1, in her Junior year! Her serve is unbelievable. We wouldn't be able to get out of the way fast enough before it broke our nose."
