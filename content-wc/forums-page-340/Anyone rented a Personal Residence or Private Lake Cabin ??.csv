2547553,swamp donkey,2014-03-12 16:41:00,2,it sounds like you are looking at renting a cabin in what is called the black market tourism industry
2528282,bushead11,2014-03-07 10:50:00,151,"With websites like www.vrbo.com (vacation rentals by owner) you can rent a personal residence for a week or month for a flat rate here in the states. I am wondering if anyone has rented a fishing cabin from somone personally and not though an outfitter in a similar fashion? I am looking for a place that would hold 10 people and trying to get around paying the 700-800 per head through an outfitter and just pay a $2000 fee for the week use of the property instead. We would bring our own boats, food, bait, etc. Does something like that exist?"

2528434,MrSimon,2014-03-07 11:28:00,922,"I have a lakefront cottage in upstate NY near the Thousand Islands that I rent out to fisherman. I use the VRBO site and have been very happy from the property owners perspective. Just like you mentioned, renters generally bring their own boats and gear. So I'm sure it happens all the time in the US, but I don't know about Canada. Usually there is contact info on VRBO for the owner. I highly suggest getting them on the phone and asking a lot of questions before renting. The search feature on VRBO is a bit clunky, so make sure to spend plenty of time sorting through the options. Just because a cottage is listed first and has big shiny pictures doesn't mean its the best place for you."
2528930,deadhead1,2014-03-07 13:37:00,193,"I live on Lake of The Woods near Kenora, On and I rent out my guest cottage. It sleeps up to 6 but really designed for 4. Full bathroom and small kitchen. It was built for use by friends and relatives so it is located close to our house but still far enough away to be private. We just started renting it last summer so we don't know how much it will be rented but I think it will work out good. So far we haven't advertised, just by word of mouth."
