I just checked mine and it does not cover anything outside of the USA. My old Blue Cross/Blue Shield covered Mexico as well as Canada.

2538881,polaris-pete,2014-03-10 11:36:00,343,We snowmobile a lot in Canada and a couple Friends found ou the hard way ( expensive to) that after having an accident they either had to pay with cash or credit card to get looked at from the medical people. Then when back in the USA try and get re-imbursement from the medical provider.One of them broke his leg and decided to get a ride back to the States where they set the leg. I now have Medical insurance from ROAM RITE.Well worth the few bucks.
