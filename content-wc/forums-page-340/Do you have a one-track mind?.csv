Case in point, I'm watching NCAA women's basketball (of all things), and Nebraska has Rachel Theriot (pronounced ""tario"") playing against Michigan State's Analise Pickrel. The announcer says, ""Pickrel is on tario"". That's all it takes. Maybe I'll go put new line on my reels."

2533841,Knoxabilly,2014-03-08 23:17:00,225,Guilty- can't stop thinking about landing Walleyes up north lately. Been watching every fishing show on youtube in my downtime and buying so much unnecessary gear@!
2533857,btmbncr,2014-03-08 23:41:00,492,CarnhzhrAs an old hippie my mind has a tendency to focus on something other than walleye fishing.Peace out.Bill

She saw the additional 10 more 3700's for cranks and 2 tubs for the spinner spools and kind of flipped out. Told me that's enough, stop it. I told her I just reorganized my cranks. Lol. She didn't buy it."
