2546193,Pete eer,2014-03-12 11:13:00,14,I agree I have used the route to Bloomington for years it may be a little longer but saves around two hours of sitting in traffic.
2546577,BuckeyeBill,2014-03-12 12:55:00,76,"Hey Pete eer, we are practically neighbors. I'm about 8 miles west of Martins Ferry, O. which is right across the river from Wheeling. Do you have a trip planned to Ontario this year?"
2537065,roscoe33,2014-03-09 21:14:00,653,"Used to drive through Chicago 3-5 times a week. Forget the bypass. Always a mess. Hit the city between 10am and 1pm, or after 8pm, and take I94 through downtown. Alternate is I80 west to I39."
2537138,bigdaddyguns,2014-03-09 22:13:00,608,You have four bypass possibilities: 1. I80W to I39N to I90W (1 toll) 2. I80W to I355N to I90W (3 tolls) 3. I80W to I294N to I90W (4 tolls) 4. I80W to I355N to I88W to I39N to I90W (4 toll) I suggest 1 or 4 as I90 between Rockford and OHare Airport will be under major construction again in 2014. As noted in other posts it may be worth the trouble to get an electronic toll unit for you vehicle as the cash rates are 2x the electronic rates. The Illinois tollway web site has all the toll information published there.Quote: Originally Posted by BuckeyeBillBest time?After a couple of decades of travel on this system my recommendation is to avoid all roads between 5:30AM - 8:30AM and 4:00PM - 7:00PM as a general rule.

If you have a smartphone there are several methods for checking traffic before entering the region. I prefer google maps to look at the traffic flow before I get on a route to minimize my chances of getting stuck in a traffic jam. Also for your own safety ignore the speed limits signs and stay at the minimum speed of actual traffic which is at least 70MPH. Let the good times roll!
2537378,BuckeyeBill,2014-03-10 06:05:00,76,"Wow, thanks guys for all the replies. Will be gone most of the day but will respond to comments this evening. I live in eastern ohio, about 12 miles from Wheeling, West Virginia. 9 miles from I-70."
2537402,Hot Runr Guy,2014-03-10 06:17:00,16061,"Aw, it's a no-brainer then. Take I-70 thru Indy to Bloomington IL, and head north from there. There will still be 1 toll north of Rockford IL, but that's it. HRG"
2539689,bellbuoy,2014-03-10 15:53:00,490,"As I said earlier it's only 30 miles further going the I-74 route, and if you have been heading north from Indy you avoid the I-65 traffic from Indy to Chicago which really needs 3 lanes in each direction. You'll have one toll the before you hit the WI border. The most traffic then on the trip then will be Rockford to Madison or Rockford to Portage."
2540146,goldman,2014-03-10 18:27:00,1036,"I 70 thru Indy, grab I 465 north, I 74 west (it angles) then at Bloomington catch I 39 north. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
2540425,PA troutguy,2014-03-10 20:02:00,58,"If I am towing my boat I run 80 out to I 39 and then go north. If I am not towing a boat I use the toll route you mentioned buy I have an EZ pass, it does reduce the tolls and saves time. That route is usually busy as you have stated."
2543073,Aaron-IN,2014-03-11 14:01:00,500,"Been going to Canada forever, the option posted previously is how I always go from Indiana, with no issues. It's been my experience that it adds about 30 miles to the trip but it can save hours depending on when you would normally be going through Chicago. ""take it to Indy then take 74 west from Indy to Bloomington/Normal, IL and take 39 north from there up to Rockford, IL. It's about 30 miles farther but a lot less headaches and less tolls."""
2544729,jimmie,2014-03-12 01:04:00,123,If you want to avoid major traffic congestion and numerous tolls then I'd utilize the suggestion of others to head to I-39 then North to I90/94 then US 53 to Duluth to I'falls. Its about 35 miles further so you might wish to weigh the aggrevation and tols against two tolls(?) to Wisconsin line after hitting Illinois and a much saner drive. If you live closer to I-70/74 in Indiana then go that way no tolls except for Upper part of I-39 ($1.00) to Beloit then your favorite way to your destination. Have a safe trip and leave a few fish for me to catch!!
2545369,BuckeyeBill,2014-03-12 07:56:00,76,"Aaron, this sounds like the best route for us. I believe this is the way we came home last time. I have lived rural my whole life and am used to that kind of driving. I drove 15 minutes to work for 43 years and saw more deer and turkeys than cars, especially in the mornings. Driving in traffic like Chicago is not in my comfort zone. Especially towing!! Thanks guys for all the responses. Here's to everyone having a safe and great Canada trip this year!!"
2535561,BuckeyeBill,2014-03-09 13:57:00,76,"Ok guys, we will be heading to northwest Ontario in early June. Coming from the east (Ohio). The last time we made this trip we hit an absolute mess trying to drive around Chicago. Toll booths every so many miles caused major traffic jams. Add to this our vehicle began to make a clunking noise on every start and stop. Also we were towing our boat. With all the traffic it was impossible to pull off anywhere to check things out. 4 hours later we finally cleared the congestion and was able to pull off to check things out. I had myself convinced it was a tranny issue. Wrong!! The nut on the trailer ball was gone. The boat trailer had been jumping up off the truck and only the safety chains kept us from losing the trailer & boat. What is the best route around Chicago to avoid all this traffic? Best time? Appreciate any help. Side note - we have also driven up through Michigan to Saulte Ste Marie, Ontario and then driven around Superior to Sioux Lookout. A beautiful drive with great scenery and wildlife but it does add hours to the trip."
2535673,Fisherman Ted,2014-03-09 14:27:00,461,I do the route twice a year to/from as I travel from Boston to Kenora. I have found that it is the fastest route but it is all about the timing. I almost always blow through Chicago after 8 PM at which point it's pretty painless. Even if there is traffic it's maybe 30 minutes worth before things open up. I use my Fast Pass for tollbooths. Speeds up my 30 hour trip considerably.
2535793,bellbuoy,2014-03-09 15:03:00,490,"Where in OH? If around I-70, take it to Indy then take 74 west from Indy to Bloomington/Normal, IL and take 39 north from there up to Rockford, IL. It's about 30 miles farther but a lot less headaches and less tolls. I haven't gone thru Chicago in years since I-39 has been completed."
2535801,pjshorthorn,2014-03-09 15:05:00,5654,"There aren't too many other efficient choices outside of the ones you have already used if you are locked into driving. I've made the trip around Chicago 50-60+ times when living in PA and OH. Both to visit family in Wisconsin and heading to Canada on fishing trips. As Fisherman Ted noted, timing is everything and the tolls are inevitable....the big difference from years past is that toll passes nowadays make it much easier to get through the toll booths. I would pay for the toll pass in a heartbeat instead of adding possible time due to backups. I've also taken an extra travel day on my fishing trips to avoid the long drives and traffic issues, but that is not always an option for everyone. The last part of the story, "" clunking noise "" made me think, YIKES!!! PjShorthorn"
2535817,Hot Runr Guy,2014-03-09 15:06:00,16061,"OK, I live in the Chicago area, so I've got to ask. With ""toll boths every so many miles"" and multiple oasis's along the route, how could you NOT find an opportunity to pull over and inspect your rig? HRG"
2535825,Skywagon,2014-03-09 15:13:00,1106,"BuckeyeBill, Don't you have any pull with a Community Planner from Chicago? He can get you a police escort around town. If that doesn't work, bellbouy's plan on taking 70 to Indy then catching 74 to 39 is a good one, depending on your location."
2535905,tooski,2014-03-09 15:42:00,393,"Depending on where in OHIO but the route we take now is 75 through Michigan and then 17 after the Sault. ""MIGHT"" take a bit longer , not always. And the gorgeous route north of Superior beats the hellll out of the Chicago mess...."
2536281,goldman,2014-03-09 17:45:00,1036,"I would recommend investing in a good Rand McNally atlas. You don't need the big Motor Carrier edition, but just a good atlas made by a reputable company such as Rand McNally. Also, Any way you go, if you avoid morning and evening drive times you'll be better off. I drive truck and occasionally am loaded at a shipper and tossed out in the streets at approx. evening rush hour. Not fun."
2536393,btyreprich,2014-03-09 18:18:00,1067,My suggestion is to travel I80 west throughout Illinois to I39 north. I39 north will take you to Rockford. This route will have you avoid traffic congestion in Chicago and the suburbs as well as tolls. Safe travels!
2536817,Babamel2,2014-03-09 19:56:00,414,"I travel from northern Indiana around chicago to go to Canada. the smartest thing is to get an Ipass (EZpass or whatever they call it). It drasticly cuts the cost of the tolls, plus no stopping. Try to avoid the rush hours, but other wise take I 80 to the 294, then I take 290 till it meets the westbound toll road and take it to Rockford. This year there is construction on the the westbound from chicago to Rockford, I will most likely go north to Milwaukee, then west to Madison. with an Ipass, and non rush hour traffic the 294 can be quite open."
