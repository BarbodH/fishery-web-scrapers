2537234,forgop,2014-03-10 00:44:00,880,"My foursome last September (3 of us were first timers) was something like 280# over weight. The outfitter obviously had to make a separate flight (which BTW, I highly recommend the critical stuff with you as the others in our group had fishing gear of theirs that didn't make the first flight). We took in a lot of food and then stuff that we would just do without the next time around. I would never sell myself short of leaving something behind that I think I need and regret not having it with me. That said, how do you even come remotely close to staying within your limit if you have any inclination to drink beer? I'm contemplating taking 100# worth of beer alone for myself as I found that on the 2nd day last year, I would have to ration myself the rest of the week. To me, the only way you could reasonably stay within their limit is to do it sober. I understand liquor will get you there quicker minus without nearly as much weight, but I just want to be able to drink beer all day for the whole week. This year I'll be cutting back quite a bit o the amount of tackle I take with me. I'd hate to guess what that thing weighed. I'm also of the mindset to only take enough food to accompany fish rather than carrying in in full meals planned over several days that we still didn't eat all of it. The outfitter's website recommends not using those rod tubes for the plane, but I'm not too fond of not protecting the poles from breaking an eyelet or anything in the process. Since we're going almost a full month earlier (early-mid Aug vs early-Mid September), I don't know we'll see quite as much of a drastic temp change like we had, so the amount of cold gear we take will be a little lighter. Anyone have any tips for success? I think I've already accepted the fact we'll just need to upgrade to the Otter to fly in all the additional weight in beer."
2537266,roscoe33,2014-03-10 01:10:00,653,"Did one fly-in about 10 years ago.Yes we stayed under the limit.Not that hard to do, especially if the outpost is well stocked.Seems easier for the guys that had military background.We took in 10 rods, wrapped in a sleeping bag, so that added no additional weight.Our food was mainly staples, dehydrated potatoes, fish batter, pancake mix, powered lemonade and punch, oatmeal and cereal--with lemonade instead of milk, coffee, peanut butter, cheese, butter, a bag of apples and oranges, and bread. We also had a couple dried instant meals, chicken ala king, in case we were kept off the water by storms.No cans, no glass.We kept the fishing gear and food weight to under 120#, That left 70# each for misc gear, clothes and boots, no problem.The four of us shared 1 pint, on the last night.If you really drink 5 1/2 cases of beer in the week, do you even remember being there?"
2537314,forgop,2014-03-10 03:47:00,880,"If I took in 5 cases (120), that comes out to 17/day. Not a big stretch to drink 2 beers/hour on the boat and a handful before bed. I may cut back to 4 cases. I smoked about 25 cigars last year as well. I know I realized pretty early that I wasn't going to have enough with 2-1/2 cases last year at the rate I started off the week. But back in the real world at home, I may get through a 12 pack and 1-2 cigars/month. Just my time to unwind and make up for 51 other weeks out of the year."
2537322,wallydave,2014-03-10 05:09:00,2151,"My first flyin we stayed under on beer, the outfitter flew the beer in on the take out flight for the group ahead of us. Plan your meals, some of the replies have good tips! Go over your tackle box to lighten things up. Good luck!"
2537626,SinOrSwim,2014-03-10 07:25:00,1528,"I'm surprised nobody has mentioned it is illegal to drink in the boat. LOL We drank in the boat on fly-ins. Figured the chances of getting caught were pretty slim. Now we go to Lac Seul and don't drink in the boat. it just doesn't seem right to be on the water and not enjoy a cold beverage????? It is possible for people to drink and not get wasted.But, to the OP, I'm with you. We flew in for about 17 years before changing to a drive in camp. Our outfitter didnt' charge extra for overages. He brought overflow stuff in on a check flight. I dont' think there is any possible way to stay under those weight limits. Especially with beer. We used to take a case per person per day. That was A LOT, yes. But, like you said if you drink a couple beers per hour you are not getting wasted. It's a long day in the boat. Then, if you do actually drink more at the cabin that adds up. Add in the beer for beer batter, spillage and those beers that get opened and not drank. I'm the same as you. I don't enjoy hard liquor like I enjoy beer. Ice is also an issue. We made sure we had our clothes, rain gear, fishing essentials and then they flew in extra beer, soda, ice etc later in the day or the next day. You have to pack with the idea your stuff is going to get separated. Easier said than done.Word of advice. Number your cases of beer. If you are flying in 15 to 20 cases of beer it's pretty easy for someone in the ""chain of command"" to snag one or two without you knowing it's not there. My opinion, you are spending a lot of money on a trip. Spend the few extra dollars to take the beer and supplies you want. It IS a vacation after all.As for clothes. It doesn't cut a ton of weight but we went in September as well. But, I didn't take any pants with me. Only shorts. I always put shorts on and then my rain gear bibs. Those were my pants in the boat and when it got warmer, off came the rain gear. If it stayed cold, my rain gear was always on. A really good dry bag is essential. You can store extra layers or take off extra layers and know they won't get soaking wet for the next day."
2537690,MrSimon,2014-03-10 07:57:00,922,"I might be in the minority with this opinion, but that much drinking in the boat is illegal, dangerous, un-healthy, expensive, and its cumbersome to transport all that beer via plane. If drinking in the boat is that important to you, why not just stay home and fish local lakes where its legal and a LOT cheaper??? If you drink two beers per hour all day long, you are drunk. If you aren't drunk, you have a serious problem. But all that aside, if you are intent on taking all that beer, staying under weight is going to be difficult, but possible. You'd have to take a lot of dehydrated food, only take one large Plano box of tackle (entirely possible by the way), take only one change of clothes, one pair of shoes, and do without things like big lanterns, books/cards/games, camera equipment etc. You certainly won't be able to take in a generator or deep cycle batteries (usually for CPAP machines). Also, its a GREAT idea to call the outfitter ahead of time to find out what is already at camp. Some things we've taken in the past that was already there were; an axe, hatchet, saw, lantern, propane bottles, cooking gear, chairs, playing cards, water buckets, landing nets etc."
2537738,GNO,2014-03-10 08:02:00,153,"Most outfitters will fly beer in for you in advance so it won't count against your limit. Other than beverages, it should be easy to stay within the 100# limit."
2537906,packpro,2014-03-10 08:33:00,695,"1 case= 18 lbs. Adds up quick, but how could you do a shore lunch without it. That would really minimize the experience. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! We sit on the porch at night exhausted after a long day of fishing. The goal is to solve the worlds problems as the sun goes down. With that being said, it is really not beer. More like problem solving solution."
2537922,Aaron-IN,2014-03-10 08:37:00,500,Six of us flew in 18 cases of beer for 5 days last year. We just pony up and pay for the extra flight with the beer and ice we need. If you are able to buy the beer in advance your outfitter might fly it in prior to your arrival.
2547769,115 optimax,2014-03-12 17:23:00,650,"I was going to mention that earlier,but I thought twice.Then need something like Labbat's Maximum Ice,I think it's 7.9%"
2548937,roscoe33,2014-03-12 21:23:00,653,"Question on cost for: 1. Having gear flown in early? 2. Having to pay an overweight up charge? 3. Having to pay for an additional gear flight when you go in? I can see another fly-in in a couple years, and am curious what charges may amount to."
2549250,forgop,2014-03-13 04:42:00,880,"I haven't shopped a lot of outfitters, but from the handful of those I've seen, it amounts to about 50-60 cents/lb."
2549402,MrSimon,2014-03-13 06:18:00,922,"If the outfitter charters their planes, then having a second flight for extra gear is going to be WAY more expensive than the other options."
2549506,SinOrSwim,2014-03-13 06:49:00,1528,"We went for years with Slate Falls Outposts and Red Pine Lodge out of Sioux Lookout. At one point they were all owned by Verne but are split up now. But, in about 12 or 13 years of fly-ins, we were never charged for being overweight. They had enough flights and check flights they sent any overages on a flight later that day or sometimes in the next day or two. So, extra beer, water, ice, minnows etc didn't necessarily go in with us. Many times they came later but we always got our stuff and were never charge an overweight surcharge.And, we were a group who ""liked"" their beer. So, there is no way we were ever even close to that 100lb per person limit."
2549690,gmattbruin,2014-03-13 07:36:00,174,"I guess I didnt thk 2x...I unfortunately do tht alot..lol I will admit, as much as I prefer our brands of beer here, the prices we pay are nuts compared to the US...you guys have us beat on tht one bigtime!! I cld be wrong but I believe if you are on a 7day flyin, the outfitter is obligated to do a midweek chck flight...thts a great time to hav your extra beer,etc flown in. Most of these guys are very accommondating...thy want your business back. there has been alot of talk abt beer and its weight and tht goes without saying..but ""gear"" can always be reduced. The pilots almost always say they shake their heads at wht alot of guys will bring in to a camp. Most of these lakes are simple walleye&pike..it doesnt take a ton of tackle..2-4 rods at most and limited gear unless you are a end of may,1st week of june group. It definately can be done! The whole Cabellas or Bass pro stores dont need to go into every camp!"
2543729,Mike Borger,2014-03-11 18:11:00,1554,That made me laugh outright.
2543881,adempsey,2014-03-11 18:40:00,963,One thing you can do is switch from beer to whiskey .Pre-weighing your gear on a bathroom scale is a good way to know where you are at as well.
2544545,MikeinMN,2014-03-11 21:54:00,190,"Talk to the outfit you fly with. When I have flown in we never attempted to make weight. We paid way too much for doing that, paid nothing at all, and paid what was probably reasonable. It seemed every air service was a little different, although they all used 75-100 pounds of gear per person as a weight limit. As far as drinking in the boat on a fly in, we were checked once. No ticket or fine (really lucky!), but even on a fly in it is a definitely possiblity."
2544721,roscoe33,2014-03-12 00:42:00,653,"Really? Where we go, maybe 1 in 20 are over 250. Of all the people that I have gone with since 1971, only 2 in our group have ever been 250#. And we're all from Wisconsin. As far as the drinking goes, some of our gang drinks, and heavily, just not on the Canada trips. Not what the trip is about for us."
2544817,kzoofisher,2014-03-12 04:15:00,5144,You guys looking to put a buzz on are working too hard. Get one of those 7 day pill dispensers and put a hit of acid and some vitamin C in each day. Adds less than an ounce to your fly in weight. Customs will never think twice about an old guy with his helpful little reminder case and you get to take two trips in one! The preceding is a joke. Please remain calm.
2545625,Guest,2014-03-12 08:58:00,0,"[QUOTE=kzoofisher;2544817 The preceding is a joke. Please remain calm.[/QUOTE] Having previously lived in Kzoo in a previous life, I like your sense of humor. I'm sure the holier-than-thou crowd will be seriously offended at the mere mention, however. A long time ago, 25 yrs or so, our beer ration was a 12 pack per person per day. 3 cases per person for the week. That equates to about 1 beer per hour while on the boat (yes, drinking in the boat, the shame!). 1 beer per hour basically replaces what you sweat in the summer; 144 oz. of beer and almost no P stops. Anyway, we just paid the price for the extra trip; cost of doing vacation. These days, including the beer, usually one case/person, we can make the 100 lbs. per person w/out much trouble. Tackle box used to be huge, these days its small but more effective. Clothes; very few. Food; nothing canned; too much weight. Lots of ways to cut back weight. I have always thought fat people should get smaller allowance or the normal size people should get a larger weight allowance. My buddy is 260#, I'm 160 (we're the same height). If he gets 100 lbs. I should get 200, both total 360 each. Never happen but when I'm emperor of the world....look out."

YEars ago, we have had the Canada Border people have multiple people check our vehicle to see all the beer. 6 guys, 5 day trip and about 28 cases of beer. We started over taking since we ran out a couple times in years past. This trip is all about the fishing and drinking for us. Can't do that at home with a wife and kids. If we want to drink ourselves silly, play poker and swear like sailors..........Canada IS the time to do it."
2546809,Tylumps,2014-03-12 13:35:00,73,Less beer and more of the hard stuff makes the planes lighter!!!!! I do bring a 12 pack of Summer Shandy from Leiny. I don't share it with nobody and have 2 a day.

I would be willing to bet that they are the same guy and he is a regular here who is too much of a coward to post under his normal ID. OK my own lecture to those who lecture is done, onto the question.Like others have said, I would check with your outfitter on flying in your drinks before hand. Take notes on this next trip on what was left over, what you didn't use, and things you wished you had, it will help you pack in the future. You will find that in a few years you will have it down to a science and making weight won't be a problem. The key is to get the drinks flown in prior to your arrival. There is plenty of good advive already posted; powdered drink mixes, reduce clothes to bare minimium and go through tackle box."

We stay at a private lodge that is solar powered. The lodge has a washer and dryer. Huge! Very little clothes make the trip. Haven't had an issue with weight. Fish on!!
2542521,MrSimon,2014-03-11 11:37:00,922,"It's funny. We have one guy in our group who shows up every year with a back pack, a small tackle box from 1984, one rod, and a pillow. We also have a guy who will bring three huge military style duffel bags, multiple accessory bags, and 5 rods. Both guys catch fish and both guys have a blast. We try to let guys be themselves and bring what they want. It always works out. But then again we only bring one case of beer for the entire week for five guys, and we don't usually finish it."
2543177,michigan walleye guy,2014-03-11 14:28:00,95,"Boy, can I relate to this topic....It seems every year we are lopping off anywhere from 50-100 pounds of excess gear (usually due to first-timers, even though I generate a very good packing list.) And we do fly in our beer and pop ahead of time, too. Bringing 100+ dozen minnows adds up as well.Usually the new guys end up bringing way too much gear/clothing, and/or I pack too much food. Luckily, Dave at Nestor Falls usually flies in our extra stuff later in the week, we pay a reasonable surcharge for this. I guess I should just arrange for the extra flight going forward. But its all part of the hullabaloo that goes with the best weeks of the year. Speaking of extra weight, I just returned from my annual spring Cabela's trip. It was 54 degrees in Mpls. and felt like heaven."

2539097,Larry Mac,2014-03-10 13:02:00,530,"Hi Asian Angler, that was very sound advice. We enjoy the planning and challenge and have been very successful without wanting for anything. Having the outfitter fly in the beverages ahead of time obviously would cut a lot of weight. We have refined our gear over many trips i.e. I do not bring a tackle box I use 2 small Plano boxes, one for jigs and terminal tackle one for select lures. I limit clothing like stated before. We drink powdered drinks i.e. coffee and lemonade. There are many great ideas on this subject on this site. I do believe it is your vacation and you should have what you want. With a little thought and planning along with flying in your beverages ect. you will achieve this goal. Like I stated earlier we enjoy the planning and packing (it adds to our excitement) but we do not stress over it. I know many a group that brings everything they want and just pays the overweight. It is your vacation.P.S. The largest beer cargo I have seen was a group of 10 guys 72 cases Thank you,Larry Mac"
2539321,forgop,2014-03-10 14:04:00,880,"Not true at all. I encounter people with drinking problems all of the time in my line of work. I know all about putting people on ativan drips as they go through withdrawal, seizures, you name it. If this were my lifestyle every day of the year, you may have a point, but 1-2 beers an hour over 16-18 hours of wakefulness isn't going to reach the level of drunken intoxication you are picturing."
2539329,MrSimon,2014-03-10 14:05:00,922,"For the outfitters that don't weigh the people, just the gear ...... does anyone ""wear"" as much weight as possible? Like wear your jeans, boots, and jacket instead of shorts and sandals. And maybe stuff your pockets full of jigs and batteries? It kind of feels like cheating, but I bet you could save 10 pounds per person. That would be 50 pounds for our group ... fairly significant. Mike - do you know how Hearst Air handles things?"

Never once have I paid extra with either.Not surprisingly they both fly their own planes, so there you go.You'll love dealing with Hearst Air, they're a breath of fresh air."
2539849,Guest,2014-03-10 17:16:00,0,So it's your intent to violate to laws of Ontario and drink while you're out in the boat??? Great. What other laws do you think you will disregard???

2540057,dutchboy,2014-03-10 18:07:00,5717,He makes a good point. We seem to forget we are the guests of Canada. We should follow their laws or stay home. Has nothing to do with the internet. Just common curtousy.
2540353,Basser,2014-03-10 19:17:00,31,I must be in the minority. I like my beer as well as anyone. Enjoying a few cold ones tonight. When we go on our annual outpost trip we take NO BEER or alcohol. I treasure that one week a year and don't want a minute of it to be dimmed by too much beer or drinks. And boy does that first cold beer taste good after a week in the bush!
2540401,Mike Borger,2014-03-10 19:51:00,1554,Agreed. I talked to forgop directly on the phone a couple days ago and I can tell anyone who cares he's a solid guy.
2538201,onetimedave,2014-03-10 09:39:00,502,Our limit is 110# per person. Ole Joe makes sure we stay within that weight
2538553,Walleye_Wrangler,2014-03-10 10:45:00,138,What I always found peculiar was all the attention to how much our gear weighs and nothing said when me and my stout friends climb into the plane and it **** near sinks ?
2538593,Ferrispata,2014-03-10 10:54:00,63,I was wondering that myself. I am in diet mode now to make me feel more comfortable/safe on the flyin. 4 months to go.
2538649,Mike Borger,2014-03-10 11:03:00,1554,They allow for some variance in passenger weight.The actual payload of the plane is always in excess of your allowed weight limit per man.
2538697,SinOrSwim,2014-03-10 11:11:00,1528,"They always made our group get on the scale. Then, the amount of weight they could add to the plane was calculated and all gear was weighed before it went on. Granted, we didn't have limits but were asked to limit gear. He would fly extras in on check flights or other flights going to cabins in the area. It's about how much they want to juggle and deal with. Our outfitter always busted his hump to make sure we got what we wanted/needed. Then he would mock us for it. LOL"
2538713,dutchboy,2014-03-10 11:13:00,5717,Why don't you just stay home & drink?
2538737,SinOrSwim,2014-03-10 11:16:00,1528,Why don't people stay home and drink instead of going to the beach or a football game or a race. You don't drink........fine. Others do.....fine. Some people like to enjoy a little of it all. If drinking beer and fishing is their thing why is it for your to question?
2538817,Mike Borger,2014-03-10 11:23:00,1554,"I hear you, but still when outfitters post weight limits on their website it's always with a bit of wiggle room factored in.Also depends on the outfitter. If they don't own the plane and are paying for a charter then ""usually"" you get the full payload and that means guests jumping on the scales as well. That's the way Nakina Air operates.On one of my recent trips flying with them they made us remove a 6 pack of Gatorade so we'd be within the planes weight limit LOL!"
2538849,dutchboy,2014-03-10 11:30:00,5717,"I'm not questioning anything, the issue seemed to be to much weight.If you can't get under weight without leaving gear for the fishing trip why go? People can drink themselves into a stupor for all I care. It's like paying $100 for a ticket to a pro football game and getting drunker then a pig, making a a$$ out of yourself. Why bother with the game?"
2538993,AsianAngler,2014-03-10 12:17:00,67,"We took a very hard look at everything we normally pack and cut back. Think about how much heavy terminal tackle you lug along. Do you really need 50 of those lead weights? Since my husband and I have been on many, many trips I pointed out that we usually come home with a lot of unused clothing. Try bringing a small container of laundry soap in case you run out. Also, one warm pair of pants and several pairs of nylon pants are a lot lighter than blue jeans. Foot wear is another heavy subject. Finally, avoid canned food if possible and know what you will really eat. At the end of the week, you could fit what we didn't consume in a shoebox. Send beer and other items ahead of your party... most resorts encourage this. I guess most folks don't do this. The workers at the resort were impressed. Good Luck!"
