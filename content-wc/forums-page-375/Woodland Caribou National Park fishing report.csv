Hundreds of fish caught by six fisherman daily. At one point a pink and white rapala #9 was 7 for 7 casting in the shallows catching walleye. Largest walleye caught was 27"", several 24"" and hundreds of 20-23"". Largest northern was 40"" with several in the 33-38"" range. Best water temps were 68 degrees or warmer. Nothing caught in temps lower than 64 degrees. White and pink were the colors this year. White jig with crawler or minnow worked best! No lakers were caught. Have fun!"
