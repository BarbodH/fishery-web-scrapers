My fishing partner on a good day were only able to catch 25 walleyes on a good day, from past years average 75 per day with good days 175+. I have fished this area for years and the bite was never this slow. At the end of the week the water temp were at 69. We fished areas as far west as dead broke channel. I am just curious if anyone else was up there during this time and had the same results."

The water temps appeared to be rising but walleyes were still in transition. Many of the big walleyes in camp were caught by trollers. Small mouth fishing was outstanding and kept us entertained. Northern were still shallow."
