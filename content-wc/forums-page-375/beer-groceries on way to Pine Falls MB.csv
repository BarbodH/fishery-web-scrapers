1863073,lassh,2013-06-13 09:45:00,553,"We're flying out of Pine Falls, MB this year. Its a different route for us than the usual Ontario crossing at IF/Ft. Francis. We will be crossing at Pembina/Emerson from ND to Manitoba. Where is a good place to buy beer and produce along the way as the beer store will be closed in Pine Falls when we get there? We will be taking 29N which turns into 75 in Canada to Winnipeg B/P to 101 to 59 to 11. Thanks for your help. Go hawks!"
1863233,pike50plus,2013-06-13 10:14:00,584,"We have found that the grocery stores in the Peg are very good and fresh produce. Adult beverage stores are usually near them, also buy at dutyfree on way in?http://www.bing.com/entities/search?...ipeg&FORM=LARE"
1865505,lassh,2013-06-14 04:39:00,553,Thanks for the info and the link. Does anyone have specific info on where they shop and buy beer on way north with easy access to the perimeter road?
1866873,freespoolin,2013-06-14 14:55:00,472,"When you approach Winnipeg on 75 you will be crossing Hwy 101. A few blocks north of 101, on the right is a Safeway grocery store. Immediately across 75 (which is now called Pembina Hwy) is a Liquor Mart which sells beer, wine, spirits. Once your shopping is done, proceed a few blocks south (through the construction), back onto the Perimeter Hwy (101), East around to 59 and north to Pine Falls. Have fun."
1867009,lassh,2013-06-14 17:47:00,553,"Thanks freespoolin. There is no doubt that we will have fun. We'll probably be at that location around 5 o'clock on Sunday. I think the Liquor mart is open till 6 on Sunday, so we can't be lolly gagging around on the way. Thanks again."
1870321,freespoolin,2013-06-16 11:59:00,472,"Pick up some ""Angry Fish Pilsner"" in the tall cans at the Liquor Mart."
1871033,LeeMB,2013-06-16 17:23:00,83,if your running late there is a grocery-liquor store in lockport. When on #59 North take #44 exit to lockport. Just a mile or so off 59. I think they are open till 11:00.
1873082,BlueJayBert,2013-06-17 10:21:00,15,"At the duty free store in Pembina do they sell Canadian beer or is it American? Is that the way to go? Any idea on the cost per case? What kind of selection do they have? Thanks for info, will be there Friday."
