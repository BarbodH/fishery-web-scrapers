1857809,NY Walleye,2013-06-11 18:31:00,78,One of the best reports I have seen. Awesome
1862665,TIGHTLINER,2013-06-13 08:10:00,223,Mike.... Thanks for another great report. Sounds like you took something very small and mad it into a big hit. Anymore trips planned for the 2013 season??
1869977,515,2013-06-16 09:49:00,254,"Awesome job Mike, congrats on the fish and Thanks for the report."
1852626,Mike Borger,2013-06-10 08:16:00,1554,You actually made me look LOL!If anyone does check the site there is no mention of this new camp downstream from Pym. You'll have to call them directly.Cheers
1852786,rsiminski,2013-06-10 09:12:00,53,Wow is all I can say. I'll have to add this trip to my bucket list.
1852866,gatorchaser1,2013-06-10 09:33:00,4,"Outstanding report as usual, that looks amazing, I will have to give Mel a call and find out more about this location. Our Pym Island trip last year was amazing but I believe this tops it. Did you have to have guides on this trip or were you on your own with your other boat?"
1853138,wallydave,2013-06-10 11:07:00,2151,"I saw the Attawapiskat River Trophies tab on the toolbar, the fishing looked fantastic, I guess I got carried away! Must be my pre-trip brain, I think a big part of my mind is focussed on Lac Seul! At least the contact info is on the site! I know...my bad!"
1853418,Mike Borger,2013-06-10 12:33:00,1554,"We were on our own. I think initially they wanted us to have a guide, but the river was so high and there was zero hazards so they figured we'd be okay."
1853426,Mike Borger,2013-06-10 12:34:00,1554,"I know all about the pre trip brain. Have a great time on Lac Seul, I think your timing is perfect!"
1853474,pegasis0066,2013-06-10 12:38:00,64,"Don't see it referenced for fishing, just moose hunting. I have an email into them, and will call.Thanks"
1854090,RickOnt,2013-06-10 16:37:00,217,"MikeSimply Amazing!!!A fantastic Fishing Trip/Adventure.Those Freighter Canoes look like great boats for Fishing as well as travelling.You guys had some extremes with the weather, The forecast for Chapleau next week looks pretty good.CheersRick"
1854586,go dart,2013-06-10 19:50:00,77,Mike I've read your post for 3 or 4 years now and can't wait to share them with my son. I'm still buzzing from all the fish pics and want to say thank you.
1855210,Catman59,2013-06-11 04:26:00,345,I too look forward to your posts Mike ! Your trips are outstanding .
1850937,Mike Borger,2013-06-09 17:15:00,1554,"Last week my group of four was priveleged to fish Hearst Air's brand new outpost camp located downstream from their existing camp at Pym Island. It's not open to the general public yet and they frankly they weren't really ready to accomodate us as the trip was put together just two days before we flew in. They jumped through hoops to have boats, motors and gas flown in for us in time.The camp was formerly a privately owned affair which they recently aquired. While it wasn't truly cleaned up and ready for guests it was definitely a cut above and was a great venue to spend a week.The fishing was in a word spectacular. Numerous and I mean numerous pike over 40"". Walleye were almost entirely incidental catches for us yet we still managed several over 30"" in the 10lb class and numerous fish in the high 20's. I believe if one was to actually target these fish the results would be astounding.The conditions were tough too. The river was running 6' high and turbid from spring runoff. It was cold as well, with large blocks of ice still lining the river in spots.I truly believe that once the water drops to a normal level, warms up and the weeds grow in the fishing will be even better. And that's saying a lot!If anyone is interested I just put together a detailed online report of the trip complete with photos and video.You can check it out here:http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...howtopic=70067All the best,Mike"
1851161,new hips,2013-06-09 18:36:00,498,Great trip report (as usual) all pics and video worked fine. You always find a way to top your previous trip.Thanks for sharing..............

1852178,pegasis0066,2013-06-10 06:18:00,64,Any idea when it will be open to the general public?
