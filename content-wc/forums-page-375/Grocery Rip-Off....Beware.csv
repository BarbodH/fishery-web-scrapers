If you don't have the ""card"" you will pay through the nose for anything in the store. The ""card"" gives you the discount....which amounts to the normal price that you will find in any other store in Dryden. IGA and Extra Foods can be found on the highway (17) and don't require this nonsense. I bring this up because three recent groups of tourists that I have talked to were either not made aware of the ""card"" or had it mentioned but did not understand how they would get gouged without it. It only takes a minute to get a ""card"" but unless you realize the nature of this scam (my opinion) you get hosed. I called the manager of the Dryden store, voiced my concerns, and was assured that everyone is made fully aware of the ""card"". This is not the experience that the 3 above mentioned groups had though. So beware......."
1872146,Golden Eagle,2013-06-17 07:06:00,2642,Good advice. I've been a Safeway card holder for well over a decade.
1872594,camp chef,2013-06-17 08:52:00,915,It happens in the states too. I refuse to buy groceries at a store that makes you give them your information in order to get the best price. I hate being marketed to and that is exactly what they do with the information they get (what your buying preferences are)
1872882,Golden Eagle,2013-06-17 09:39:00,2642,"I use the card, but none of the information I provided is correct."
1875626,Nimstug,2013-06-17 20:20:00,2605,"If someone has a card from 'Dominicks' stores found in the Chicago area, you have 'the card.' Just about 'everyone' is going toward some sort card and I find it irritating to say the least..."
1875642,zeebee,2013-06-17 20:21:00,1144,Safeway was recently bought out by Sobeys....hopefully they will end this nonsense.
1875882,dutchboy,2013-06-17 21:05:00,5717,"It will never end, the minions love thinking they are getting something for nothing."
1875978,tackleman,2013-06-17 21:21:00,444,"you probably gave them a Red Lake address,"
1876706,Mohleye,2013-06-18 07:34:00,368,"The card thing seems to be common practice in many places.....thankfully not where I live yet. We stopped at the Safeway in Ft Frances for some groceries last week, and when the very pleasant lady who rang us up learned we didn't have a card, she swiped her own."
