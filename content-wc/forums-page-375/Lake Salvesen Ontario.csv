A small ,slow, weed banked river enters at one end. Up the river a short ways was a small creek with a waterfall at the end. Constant action there. We would drift back down that shallow river and catch lots and lots of small walleye on bare jigs. At the other end were some impressive rapids and the fishing was excellent there as well."

We definately had a few days where the fishing patterns changed on us, making us change our routines. We probably caught 600-700 pike, 300 ish walleyes, and just a handfull of small mouth. We mainly targeted pike and caught the others while throwing for pike. Our biggest was 36, with many others coming close. A 33 inch musky was a bonus. The walleyes were on the small side, reaching 20 inches. The water was stained with silt, something I was not use too in canada. The accomodations were beyond exeptional!! Our cabin was nicer than some peoples homes. Halley's Camps, once again, was above and beyond helpfull and accomodating. I wish some company's in the states worked half as hard to make their guests feel that comfortable. Thanks again to the Halley's family ! Great Trip !"

Halley's does provide great service overall..I never thought of Musky being in salvaston. I guess you never know what's on the end of the line.Joe"
1871513,pikeman14,2013-06-16 20:33:00,144,Joeflip...Let us know how your trip to Caribou falls goes. Maybe Sharpstone for me next time. It might be a couple years until I get to travel north again. Have a great trip. Tell Gene we said hi
