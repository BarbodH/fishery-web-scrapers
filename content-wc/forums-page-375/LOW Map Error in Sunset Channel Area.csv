1869697,bob888,2013-06-16 08:34:00,244,Came close to totaling my rig as my Navionics MSD/PREM-N6 Vol.22 did not show a shallow water area in blue. The area that this occurred is traversed by many boats daily. Attached are images taken from my Lowrance HDS 5 unit and from the paper map to show the error. My assumption is that a data transfer error occured as other areas of the lake show blue. My partner who has a Lakemaster chip in his Hummingbird did show the shallow area. I also have an older Gold Navionics chip the is exclusively for LOW and the same error occurs on the chip.

Small enough spot, off the beaten path, but enough to ruin a trip. I also had a spot last year that showed as 5-6' below water, and was actually 2-4 feet ABOVE water."

If your simply pointing out that one is not shaded blue and you rely on colour in your navigation endeavours, then I would suggest you stay on the track routes. News flash.....there are lots of marker buoys that are not in the water where they say they are on the map either."
1871737,DEMolishedyou2,2013-06-16 21:43:00,6,"Thanks for pointing this out! This is a perfect reason why these map chips in GPS units are not to be used for navigation, which almost if not all units say on start-up. Save yourself and your boat by planning a few trips on the water ahead of time and if you decide to change up the route drive slowly and attentively."

It was visible on his GPS, had just taken off while the GPS was zoomed out and missed it. Be careful out there, familiarize yourself with the area you are fishing on a paper map along with your mapping chips. Stuff Happens."
