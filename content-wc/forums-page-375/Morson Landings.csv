1838569,bigtimeelectric,2013-06-05 06:06:00,174,"Hello, I searched and can't find any details. Is there 2 landings in Morson where you can park for the week? Is one of them safer or better than the other? Coming up in July for a week. Also where would one get some leeches up there? Thanks"
1838969,Shorelunch,2013-06-05 07:48:00,554,"Morson has a government dock that is free and has good parking. Otherwise, you can launch and park at Morson Marina or Pier North, I'm not sure of the rate, but are private docks. For leeches, I'd try Gate's bait shop (about 2 miles before Bergland), Buena Vista or the Morson Marina."

It is just a very well run professional fishing resort. We are fired up for a week of fishing!Keep the reports coming and I will report back when we get home.Thanks,Dodger"
1842729,rwl,2013-06-06 09:15:00,1655,"One in Morson is Gills Morson Marina, have parked there for 20+ years with no issues to the trucks/trailers. I couldn't tell you what it costs as we just launch and leave, it is part of the resort cost. Ramp is good enough, parking is safe, I heard of some vandalism/theft issues at the government pier, but only rumors so I couldn't comment."
1844145,Guest,2013-06-06 17:08:00,0,we have used this landing for guests every summer for over 10 years. we have had no one mention they had vandilism or theft from their vehicle or trailers. i hope that keeps up. good luck
1846641,PJM,2013-06-07 13:22:00,3516,Big Time Buena Vista Resort was a great boat landing and they sell bait because they own minnow blocks and do a lot of trapping. The harbour is protected and they have a nice restaurant and a store and a camp ground and plenty of parking. Give them a call...............
1860569,johnboat,2013-06-12 15:33:00,2014,"Last year Pier North's charge was $37.50 for the week. ( I think) You will have no problems there. Usually a fairly busy place. John B.O.A,T."
1861025,1shooter,2013-06-12 18:31:00,1493,Is there anywhere to buy beer around the landing?
1861081,birddogger,2013-06-12 19:09:00,43,"I believe the closest place is the LCBO store on the right side of hwy 11 as you enter rainy river from the USA. They have standard business hours, i.e. no evenings or Sundays. Check their schedule."
