1859417,SinOrSwim,2013-06-12 09:52:00,1528,I have one I use when I clean fish. The palm area is puncture resistant but the tops are not. They are great for cleaing fish though. Sometimes it's sort of dark and one of the worst things ever is to have a sliced finger and have to deal with it on your index finger or something all week.I would NEVER not take a net though. Would you want the fish of your life sitting in the water until you got a glove on?
1860097,Kmanster,2013-06-12 13:12:00,26,"I use the one's from Menards with the rubber palms and the thin, mesh-like backing. They really grip the fish and in fact, they work great when cleaning/fileting. They're like $5 to $10 bucks at menards, Home Depot, etc. Why pay upwards of $30 for Lindy gloves when these work the same.Just my 2 cents and tight lines all. (46 days and counting until the trip north)"
1860697,freespoolin,2013-06-12 15:52:00,472,I use the Lindy glove regularly. Great for griping fish. They shrink after getting wet a few times so buy a bigger size. I have girly sized hands and the small-medium is tight.
1865057,Glenman12,2013-06-13 20:20:00,762,that sounds like the way to go because last I saw the Lindys gloves were $29.99 per glove...
1856529,rsiminski,2013-06-11 10:36:00,53,Has anyone used the Lindy fish handling gloves? I'm considering buying a pair for my gouin reservoir trip. Since it will be a fly-in trip I was looking at these gloves so I dont have to take a net or fish cradle. Im trying to cut down on weight and bulky items and thought some sort of puncture resistant glove might do the trick. Any insight would be appreciated.
1856777,UKBDM,2013-06-11 11:50:00,178,"... uses them all the time. He got hooked when he was 11 and has been ""hook shy"" ever since. I'm letting him work thru it on his own time. Didn't help when I buried a treble in my finger on Super Bowl Sunday. I fiddled with it for 45 min before making the trip to the ER. We both have a healthy respect for hooks now. A little on the expensive side (cheaper than ER) but they do protect well. I believe they come in 2 or 3 sizes so order accordingly."
1857025,JOE WALLEYE,2013-06-11 13:15:00,753,"they are good, but they don't replace a net or cradle as far as I am concerned."
1857089,NYBowHunter,2013-06-11 13:49:00,35,Never leave for Canada with out them - especially useful when handling small pikes/large lures!
1857481,keek,2013-06-11 15:39:00,1003,I love mine. Also use it to get a better grip on them when I fillet.
1858609,rsiminski,2013-06-12 05:37:00,53,Thanks guys. Im going to order them today.
1858817,Guest,2013-06-12 07:10:00,0,"I keep a pair of release gloves with me when in Canada. These are indispensable to me when handling unhappy fish. I have done many one day fly-in trips where I simply used my hand to grasp the fish in the water and then lift it into the boat. This is very tough on the hands in terms of scratches and pokes. The gloves would be helpful in this regards. However, I question how well they would work when left on at all times, in terms of sensitivity of feeling the rod/reel and being able to use my finger tips when baiting hooks and such. I would find it problematic to put the glove on and then take them off after handling each fish. I wouldn't be at all surprised if your outfitter would have a landing net for you in the boats. It might not be much of a net, but a net nevertheless. Good luck on your trip. Keep those lines tight!"
1858985,gatorchaser1,2013-06-12 08:10:00,4,"I would recommend taking a net with you, one that is telescopic so it takes up less room and weight is minimal. Did a trip to Pym Island last year and bought the gloves because of the added size of the pike. once the fish was netted, slip the gloves on and remove hooks and release. Saves on the thrashing treble hooks from sudden head shakes and added grip for release. On a fly in you don`t want your trip ruined by an emergency flight out for repairs from a hook."
1859057,5richards,2013-06-12 08:19:00,131,I bought a right and left -- I found them to be cumbersome -- I used them when I had a big fish on -- you won't want to work a reel with them on -- just my opinion
1859161,rsiminski,2013-06-12 08:42:00,53,I'm excited to try these gloves out. I have read on reviews that they do tend to be a bit bulky and cumbersome. So with this in mind I dont plan on wearing them all of the time. I have also decided to take a folding net since the outfitter does not supply them. So if I do manage to land a really big pike that doesnt fit in the net I'll put the gloves to the test.
