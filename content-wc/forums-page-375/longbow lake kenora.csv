548911,Guest,2005-06-07 20:21:00,0,"The group I go to with stayed on Longbow for about 28 years. I personally was ther for 13 years. We rarely fished Longbow, mostly portaged onto Lake of the Woods. When we wdid fish Longbow for walleye we caught them on the eastern arm, the end away from the poratge. There is a little island that is very shallow all around. We fished the edges of the shallow area and did ok. Directly in front of Reddens camp is a small island with a huge submerged,sometimes, boulder beside it. We also caught fish in that area. I don't know where you are staying but beware of the submerged boulder. If the water is up it is just under the water and very hittable. If you don't know it's there you can have a bad day. Lots of northern in Longbow. Saw a huge northern caught in there about 10 years ago. Biggest on I've year seen. Don't know if any of this helps. have a good trip"
548914,Guest,2005-06-07 20:51:00,0,Thanks alot brett.Will give us a place to start.Any ideas on Lake of the woods THANKS. PETE.
548941,tjsker,2005-06-08 10:37:00,301,"There is a bay south of the portage to LOW. Drag some crawlers or leeches around there in about 13-18 feet of water. If you can find the island on the east side of the lake that Brett talked about, there is a point that comes out just north of there. Fish the southeast corner of that point. I've had good luck around points and sunken islands that have emerging weed growth. Fish the weed edges down to about 18 feed with crawlers and leeches. You'll get snagged-up a few times, but that's common, floats help. Leave some fish for me, I'll be up there June 18-25. I would also love to get any info on spots on LOW that are close to the Longbow inlet."
548966,Guest,2005-06-08 20:04:00,0,"If you come out of the portage onto LOTW go south I think. I'm poor with direction but know where I'm going, kinda sounds stupid but it's true. There is a bay called Route Bay. Go all the way to the back of it. You can always catch decent sized wallys in there. Have never caught many big ones but there is usually good quantity in there. Watch out for rocks on the right hand side going in. Stay near the side with the houses and docks and you will be ok. There is a channel that goes back to a small dam and portage. Stay to the left side of that and work towards the back. Usually lots of emerging weeds. If you have a map it will be a cinch to find. Don't know many other places that are real close to the portage. I think the other post may have been talking about the same place as me."
548986,tjsker,2005-06-09 11:40:00,301,"Thanks, looks like a lot of good places to try according to my map."
548987,tjsker,2005-06-09 11:43:00,301,"I just remembered. Fishing Hot Spots has a map of Longbow on their L.O.W NE section map. They didn't mark any spots, but the depth info is fairly accurate."
549041,MN_Moose,2005-06-11 06:32:00,964,"tjsker we'll be at Longbow the same week as you. June 18-25. I'll be in a 18' Alumacraft Gold/Green. The other boat will be a blue/white Starcraft. Stop and say hi if you see us. We're staying at Crest resort far eastern end of Longbow. We have been out on LOTW before but coming from Sioux Narrows we fished around Yellow Girl, Chisolm and Cliff. Will share some notes with you."
549044,Larry S,2005-06-11 07:23:00,665,"Tjsker, If you are going to Longbow with a certain John Jerina from Chicago Area tell him Larry Schroeder formerly from Schaumburg,now living in Henderson Nevada says Hi. I fished many years at the same place,Silver Birch camp in Redditt Ontario that John did. I am leaving tonight for a 2 week trip. Fishing for trout for 4 days at Sturgeon Lake, then going on a fly-in out of Pickle Lake on the 17th of June. Have a great trip tell John I will e-mail him when I return Larry S"
549065,tjsker,2005-06-11 16:59:00,301,"I'm his cousin Tony Jerina. John reads WalleyeCentral so I'm sure he'll get this message, but I'm meeting him up there so I'll relay it anyway. I went to Silver Birch a couple of years also. I think John said that Carl the resort owner died."
