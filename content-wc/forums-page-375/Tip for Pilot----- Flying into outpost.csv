1871585,pikeman14,2013-06-16 20:50:00,144,"Just got back..we tipped our pilots 50$ each way. For a group of 5, only 10$ a guy. I also gave him an ample supply of homemade jerky."
1857305,grizzley,2013-06-11 15:03:00,2518,"Been reading the last couple of threads on tipping. I'm beginning to feel like you should tip everyone!What about the airline pilot that got you there safely, the ferry operator, the checkout person at the grocery store, the guy that got you the right part at the marina or auto parts store, the gunsmith that did work on your gun, the subway/ Amtrac engineer. the garbage man, the postal worker, your dentist, your lawyer, your CPA, the Fed Ex/UPS driver, and a lot of others.Maby should tip the general contractor that built your home?Other than someone that is paid less than min. wage and relies on tips, or someone that cut me a break, or maby a parking attendant (added insurance), or maby a guide that went out of his way for you. I don't think that everyone that you cross paths with should expect a tip, and it seems it's slowly getting to that."
1858921,stumcfar,2013-06-12 07:43:00,451,"So with 8 of us going, we should tip the pilot $160 each way??"
1859201,Pikeslayer8,2013-06-12 08:47:00,1460,PM sent
1859377,hawg,2013-06-12 09:40:00,2008,"I think that $20 each way is crazy high also, and I'm the guy in our group thats always accused of overtipping."
1861457,rnnonmt,2013-06-12 20:48:00,992,Tip because you want to NOT because you think you should. It should be for someone that has gone above and beyond what is expected of their job duty/responsibility. This is the approach I take for any occupation that makes at least minimum wage. If you don't make federal minimum wage then I will tip you for doing your job.
1861969,octanehi5,2013-06-13 05:20:00,1104,$20 a plane load not each
1865457,MorganMan,2013-06-14 01:00:00,341,"This question has come up before if you seach older threads. It has been a few years since we have flown, but I think we did $50 each way? We did not start off tipping when we first started going as we were not aware or think of it. I think just putting something together for them is appreciated?"
1869561,polaris-pete,2013-06-16 08:12:00,343,"Just back from the Chapleau area and used Hawk Air Service.Very nice people to do businesss with.Pilots and dock guys were very polite and did their jobs very weel, especially when packing the Plane.Tried to tip both the Pilot and the dock guys but was flatly refused.Finally shoved the money into the Pilots hand and he took it to split up. We gave the Pilots both $20 in and out as we had 2 different Pilots. .Nice planes and very good Pilots.Would fly with them again anytime."
1869937,epiepenburg,2013-06-16 09:41:00,365,"Yes, having just returned from a week trip thru Nestor Falls. We make a decision on what to tip on the way up. The sign on the desk at Nestor Falls reads ""Tipping your pilot ensures he remembers where he left you"""
1869953,515,2013-06-16 09:45:00,254,We flew with them last year and had the same experience with the tipping the pilot he flat out refused to accept it. I was impressed with the service in and out. We always like to offer and usually do 10 bucks a head(per adult) each way.
1850737,RickOnt,2013-06-09 15:21:00,217,Do you tip your pilot when flying into an outpost?If Yes How much would be reasonable?ThanksRick
1850825,NY Walleye,2013-06-09 16:16:00,78,$20 on the way in and $20 out.
1850961,Terwalleye,2013-06-09 17:21:00,166,"One year we had a guy that flipped over boats; put motors on and help set everything up. Even buzzed a moose at tree top height so we could all see him. $100Next year guy said ""be careful not to scratch the boats when you flip them over."" Real warm fuzzy guy. We likened him to the drill sergeant R. Lee Ermee Gave him $50. Should've gave him nothing. What a crab ***."
1851097,dutchboy,2013-06-09 18:23:00,5717,"If you decide to tip say $20, rip the bill in half when he drops you off. Tell him when he has you safely on the ground after picking you up he will get the other half."
1853282,octanehi5,2013-06-10 11:45:00,1104,"$20 going in and $20 coming out, here is another tip do not rip your bills in half he may not come back to get you.He flew you in safe tip ,out safe tip. No games. your life is in his hands."
1853290,stumcfar,2013-06-10 11:47:00,451,$20 per person?
1853746,fshfktry,2013-06-10 14:18:00,6,$20.00 to $50.00 each way is reasonable. If they do any extras for you maybe a little more. They are not paid very much when they are first starting bush flying. They are supplying a service just like a waitress in a restaurant and it does cost to fly and do camp checks and such.
1853858,Mike Borger,2013-06-10 15:00:00,1554,Considering who you're flying with Rick not a dime.
1855913,rsiminski,2013-06-11 08:29:00,53,"What if your pilot is the camp owner, do you still tip him?"
1856705,Aaron-IN,2013-06-11 11:37:00,500,We always do $20/person in and out.
