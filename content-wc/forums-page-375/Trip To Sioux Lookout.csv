1864441,Bassmandpe,2013-06-13 17:23:00,42,"Just got back from trip. Weather got better as week progressed. Ice out just ten days before we arrived. Water highest we ever have seen. Water temps were cold. Aqua View camera showed 43 degrees at 14 feet. Surface temps were in the 50's. Bass were not active but did catch good numbers on Livingston crankbaits- shallow running. Walleye were active on minnows & leeches. Also caught many on 6-10 ft diving slash baits. Fire Tiger color. Jigs, drop shot and Lindy Rigs worked with live bait. Northern hit bass swimbaits from Gambler- Big Easy's. Stayed at Red Pine Lodge. Good rental boats with four stoke engines.Good operation with well equiped cabins. Close to all good fishing areas. Email me for any more info [email protected]"
1864849,RapShad,2013-06-13 19:22:00,76,Thanks for the report! We are heading up to Red Pine next week. Which lakes did you fish?
1866337,Bassmandpe,2013-06-14 11:02:00,42,"We fished Northeast Pelican Bay for bass, Walleye in Abrams by the chuts and Bass in Minnitaki in the Donut & East Bay. Northerns were everywhere on bass swimbaits gold colored."
1867121,RapShad,2013-06-14 19:08:00,76,Sounds great! We hit a lot of those areas when we're there. Did you make it down to the English River at all?
1867881,Bassmandpe,2013-06-15 07:09:00,42,We fished the Minnikau River which is just above the English River. Up against the falls we got some nice Smallmouth and a few Pike. Had to be some Walleye there but we did not get any that day. Deeper diving stick baits caught walleye & smallmouth. Hope you have a good time and let me know how you do. I go on a second trip to Canada in the middle of July to the Wawa area. Nice contrast from Florida where we all live.

1869513,Bassmandpe,2013-06-16 08:01:00,42,I think you are right.
1870337,RapShad,2013-06-16 12:03:00,76,That is right I forgot about that. We always go up after all of the sanctuaries open. This time next week we will be on our second day of fishing in SL. We usually hit Lac Seul on sunday though.
1872290,tv4fish,2013-06-17 07:48:00,2694,Gotta agree with you there John runs a good operation. My group also heads up there on this coming Saturday (6/22). We will get a chance to see a couple of guys from Tennessee again.
