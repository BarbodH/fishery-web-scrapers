1868185,catran3,2013-06-15 09:52:00,29,We're leaving Saturday the 22nd. Bringing the wife and 14yo son this year. Heard the water levels are up this year compared to last year. Fished the north end last year and this year we are going to try the south end. I've heard the walleye fishing isn't as good on the south end but I'm sure we will still have a good time....can't wait!
