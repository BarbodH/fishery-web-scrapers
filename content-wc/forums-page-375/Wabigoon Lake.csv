1195291,ranger22,2010-04-30 17:20:00,124,I will be there around the same time. I am staying at a familys cabin. It isn't on the goon but that is where I am fishing. I think I will be there on the 9 or 10th and leave on the 19th or 20th. I know some people there I will let you know the water levels soon as I talk to them.
1195428,HighTech,2010-05-01 07:46:00,75,"Based on My mark on the bridge in Wabigoon, the lake is down about a foot from the high mark last summer. That's still higher than some of the lows I've seen. Rain this weekend but not a lot will bring it up a bit but not much. Ice was out Apr 12th the earliest ever breaking all records."

1163630,ranger22,2010-01-26 21:12:00,124,Going to wabigoon lake for the first time in early june. Anyone want to share any hotspots with me. Maybe early season community holes. I found a gps map with all the underwater hazards. I hear the lake has taken a lot of skegs off motors.
1163641,Bandit,2010-01-26 22:13:00,140,"Fish the wind swept points, rock piles & mud humps? Fish can be shallow if the lake has a good wind going."
1163648,SSA,2010-01-26 23:09:00,19,"Mile and Trap areas are good to start with that have good fishing. Rocks all over Wabigoon and hide very well in the muddy water. When the wind blows, this lake gets very nasty rough."
1163720,fisherman 1,2010-01-27 08:11:00,39,"Fish shallow and the slower the better. usualy 2' to 8' of water at that time of the year. Stewart Island, Christie's Island (off of the pebble beaches. Bandit hit the nail on the head shallow on windswept points. If you want to head into Butler lake the shallower lakes off of that like Olsen and Paulson lakes as well as mud bay can be productive as the water warms up quicker there.As for rocks if your gps will take a navionics chip the Canada chip is very good and has 95% of the major hazards on it (which are great spots mid summer) Unfortunatly it only has the larger lakes in the system Wabigoon and Dinorwic, but the smaller ajoining lakes are clear anyway. Otherwise if you go to this site you can download hazards to some garmin units. http://www.drydenyachtclub.ca/Hazards/Hazards.htmFish ON"
1164097,brn2fsh,2010-01-28 11:18:00,49,"Where you staying?? Trap and mile are good, as is the entrace to contact bay. Good fishing in dunalis bay also. Last year, we did much better staying away from the islands and concentrated on the mainland shoreline weed areas. a 11 pounder came off of the clay banks area. vertical jig in 2-3 feet (Seems shallow, doesn't it?) I'd get a guide (Scott if you stay at Indian point) the 1st full day. Mark the spots you get fish and you can always explore from there. You'll have a great time. Rob"
1168098,Guest,2010-02-11 10:18:00,0,Depending on where you are staying I would consider hitting Lake Dinorwic harder than Wabigoon. It has been several years since I've been there but we used to stay at a cabin on Wabigoon but it was a short boat ride to Dinorwic. The fishing was always better on Dinorwic. They used to be very good Musky lakes although I don't know if that has changed over the years. I haven't been there since the mid 90's.
1168821,Babamel2,2010-02-14 09:17:00,414,"I have been fishing Dinorwic for a number of years. I really appreciate the camp we stay at and the people who run it. It is great to fish a lake that one knows well. However, I have noticed that the average size of Pike we catch has gone down. I recent years the number of bass has increased. We have become more proficient at cattching walleye and those numbers have gone up. Average size of walleyes is about 2 lb for us."
1172611,IowaDave,2010-02-27 09:07:00,69,"I'll be making my 4th trip to Wabigoon this June. The friend I'm going with has been going there for 20+ years. The first year I went we spent most of our time on Wabigoon lake, concentrating around Devil's & Eagle Islands. Between those 2 islands we usually had pretty decent fishing. The last 2 years, we didn't have nearly as much luck on Wabigoon and focused our efforts on Butler, Larson, Olsen & Paulsen lakes. Personally, I like fishing those lakes a lot better because they're much smaller and when the wind is howling (which is seems to be a majority of the days) you're not getting beat up the way you are on the big lake. Not only that, being in a smaller lake just feels more 'north woodsy' to me, but that's just a personal thing. We have been concentrating on shoreline structure, points, etc and having fair luck. Try different baits & presentations. Last year we were working a shoreline that we'd seen another group fishing for several days. We made a few passes pulling a Lindy Rig with a crawler & didn't pick anything. I switched to a leech & immediately caught a nice fish. We went back over the spot 2 more times & I caught 2 more fish while my buddy caught 0 on the crawler. After my 3rd fish he switched and we had the best fishing I've ever had on the lake for the next 3 hours. All becuase I switched to a leech. I'd be interested to know when you're going up & where you're staying as well. Good luck!"
1172858,Bigfishhunter,2010-02-28 08:20:00,803,"My brother lived there for a few years. When he was exploring and figuring out the lake, he discovered that it had a really good weed bite in mid summer. Bigger fish came from mid lake reefs and deeper points, but for action a doubled up gulp on a 1/8 oz jig got him thousands of fish in the cabbage."
1195255,IowaDave,2010-04-30 16:00:00,69,"Ranger, you still planning on your trip to Wabigoon in June? What dates & where are you staying? I'll be up there June 11-18. I hear the water is down quite a bit this year, which could make it a little more interesting than usual for the rocks. Can anyone confirm or dispute the current water levels up there?"
