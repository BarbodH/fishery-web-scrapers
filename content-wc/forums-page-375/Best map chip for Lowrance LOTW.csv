1857129,rwl,2013-06-11 14:07:00,1655,"I have one Navionics Canada 2009 I think, but cant find it, plus I need two now for both GPS's if I want, so what is better. The Lake Insight HD or Navionics Platiinum, or are there any other choices. Fishing Falcon, McPhearson, FireBag, Tug Channel, need the travel routes from Morson, south track etc."
1857265,Gregking,2013-06-11 14:44:00,2658,same question cept andrew?
1857649,Obabikon,2013-06-11 17:02:00,2370,"Lowrance came out with their own brand of chip... I think it's called Lake Insight. Anyhow, I have it on three new GPS units for the camp, and it's exactly like the Lake Master chip. Looks great, very accurate!"
1857729,Gregking,2013-06-11 17:46:00,2658,I have it on 2 of mine and my spot I fish isn't good at all. I might look into insite HD.
1858873,DMella,2013-06-12 07:33:00,32,"Obabkon or others that have Insight... could you tell me if the insight detail continue up into yellow girl, bath island, the funnel and those general areas in the lake?"
1862937,rwl,2013-06-13 09:07:00,1655,"thanks for the help, I never had issue with the navionics map, well yeah sorta did, sometimes you were driving over the end of islands! According to the map of course. But is that the GPS or the map chip? I just can't decide to get the newest navionics canada or the Insight HD. Seems the Insight HD might be better seeing it includes all my home waters too, green bay, lake Michigan and all the inland in WI. Could anyone post a screen shot of the Insight HD, say tug channel area or how the nav trails look from Morson, south track heading to tug? That would be great, I might try to get Gander in GB or Scheels to let me look at one in a unit, but that might be a stretch."
1863649,Obabikon,2013-06-13 12:38:00,2370,"I checked this morning, and I have insight Pro. I haven't been up north with it (no point, as the fishing rocks close by). All I can say is that it is exactly like the Lake Master chip in our area (around Miles Bay)."
1864081,KHedquist,2013-06-13 14:15:00,4367,"I have the latest Navionics Canada chip I would be happy to get some screen shots for yah, direct me to the areas you would like to see. Navonics is also launching NAV+ where you select the area you want and download it to the chip, it includes SonarCharts details. http://www.navionics.com/en/navionics-1"
1864089,rwl,2013-06-13 14:31:00,1655,"KHedquist I'm not falling for that, you just want my spots! No really, I will pull up a few waypoints tonight and PM you. Oh wait, I had the Navionics and like it well, that's the one I can not find. I will buy another but was just wondering if the Insight HD was as good or better. Hopefully I find the Navionics and I will still buy the Insight HD. The HDS can have two chips anyway so I can compare, or put one in the bow GPS. My navionics was from '09 or'10 though so a new one might be better. I took my chip last fall up there deer hunting in another guys boat, and I took it out at the ramp and promptly forgot where I put it, I thought I put it where I wouldn't forget it."
1864113,KHedquist,2013-06-13 14:38:00,4367,"My eyes are closed, sounds good."
