1866401,oleJoe,2013-06-14 11:26:00,114,"We have fished Kayedon lake which Ogoki LAKE flows into. Fished on Ogoki from there twice. Ogoki being a big lake, it would be tough getting out on it safely if the wind is blowing hard. We trolled jointed rebels and hot n tots and jigs and twister tails."
1866417,vteye,2013-06-14 11:30:00,812,"AWO has a camp on Kayedon part of the Ogoki system about1/2 hour from the main lake. Yes camp is fishable in all kinds ofweather. We found the walleye average at about 19 with a lot of fish to 23 inches. It was common to struggle to catchthe under 18 inch fish. We also caught a lot of pike 20-30 incheswith a couple of nice fish thrown in including a 41.5. We were there week of 5/24 camp was clean, large, easily accomodate10, nice location, everything worked well. Recommend...Your welcome to email me with any specific questions and glad to forward maps."

1866577,dog2,2013-06-14 12:28:00,198,"Hoppy; we fished kayedon 2011 .This is a good lake [river ] system to fish in windy conditions ,but Ogoki is another story .We got on it 2 times during our week there.fished the southern end up to the wide waters.The walleye fishing on Ogoki that we had was great we trolled Rapalas on 3/4 oz inlines. Cleaned house but the y were all over 20in. We were there in July at the end of the mayfly hatch.at one spot we caught 150 fish in about an hour all 20 in or so,hard to take. These fish were all caught on plastic's w 1/4 oz jig heads. On kayedon we did weel at the inlet any current break narrows all the typical walleye haunts. pike were in the weed beds .Our goto bait for them were spinner baits . We did not catch any giants but good numbers. Feel free to drop an email will share info freeely."
