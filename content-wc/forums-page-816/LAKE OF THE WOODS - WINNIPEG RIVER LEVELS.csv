Issued: 2004.05.19 OUTFLOW INCREASE LAKE OF THE WOODS / WINNIPEG RIVER LEVELS CONTINUE TO RISE The Lake of the Woods Control Board has authorized a further increase in outflow from Lake of the Woods to slow the rise of the lake following last week's storm. Discharge from the lake into the Winnipeg River will be increased from 700 to 850 m3/s on Wednesday, May 19. This is the third flow increase in a week made necessary by the storm that left more than 100 mm of water in rain and snow in the area. The level of Lake of the Woods is 323.06 m (1059.9 ft). It has risen more than 30 cm (12 inches) due to the storm event. This level is 32 cm (13 in) above median for this time of year and is 67 cm (26 in) above the level on the same date in 2003, which was a dry year. The current rate of rise is estimated at 5-10 cm (2 -4 inches) per week and the level will continue to rise for at least the next 2-3 weeks. It is important for anyone concerned with water levels, especially on the Winnipeg River, to stay informed by frequently accessing one of the information services listed below. The outflow change to 850 m3/s will cause Winnipeg River levels to increase by 65 cm (26 inches) immediately below the Norman Dam and by 55 cm (22 inches) downstream at Locke Bay. Minaki will also be affected by the outflow increase, with river levels rising by about 30 cm (12 in) over the next 1-2 weeks. Nutimik Lake in the Whiteshell in Manitoba is expected to rise 30-50 cm (12-20 in) over the next 2-3 weeks with a peak level possibly over 275.4 m (903.5 ft). Further rain is forecast this week and could lead to additional increases in flows and water levels. The level of Lac Seul is 355.5 m (1166.3 ft). The lake rose 34 cm (13 in) over the past week and is expected to rise 15-25 cm (6-10 in)over the next week. Lac Seul outflow will be increased from 100 to 150 m3/s effective Thursday, May 20. If further information is required, please call toll-free to the Board's Secretariat at 1-800-661-5922."
