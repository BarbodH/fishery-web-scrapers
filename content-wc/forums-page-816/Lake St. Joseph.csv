That's where I was when I heard the news about 9/11. I agree that a guide is necessary for the first time or two. A GPS is almost indispensable thereafter. I'm a little worried about the cold spring so far. I hope things have warmed up enough for a ""typical"" hot bite. Last spring we did very well for #s of walleyes with lots and lots of 18-22 inchers. Our largest were two 26 inchers. You'll really appreciate the average size, but a 30 incher is almost unheard of. One day in the fall (with a guide) we had 5 from 27 to 28 inches, but 28 in. is our tops up there. No large northerns to speak of last spring. I think this time of year is a little early for them, but we have to go while before our kid's summer jobs start. We've done well for large northerns in the fall. I'll provide you with a report. Please let me know your e-mail address."
