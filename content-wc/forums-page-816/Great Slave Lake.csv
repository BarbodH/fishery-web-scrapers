Anything you read say its great fishing but they say that about the Red also, and it has been slow or at least not what it has been in the past. Interested in anyone that has fished in Yellowknife in the past few years."
539421,Guest,2004-05-10 20:20:00,0,Was there many years ago and it was awesome. You will have much better luck there than on the Red the last few years....been there too.

Once we came back from Point, we were looking for some Northern Pike fishing, which are highly disregarded by the locals. We rented a pickup and a small boat and headed out to some lake that one of the local bait shops recommended for Northerns. Un-believable Northern fishing up there, and the locals hate em with a passion. We didnt have a net, and I hand landed pike of many sizes, but when that one came up near the waterfalls, I can still remember the look in her eyes as she looked at me, like ""Dont even think about it"" hehehe I didnt, and she rocketed away, Great memories. I think that one day on Point Lake, I caught at least one lake trout for every pound between between 12 and 31 lbs and many multiples in the 20s."
