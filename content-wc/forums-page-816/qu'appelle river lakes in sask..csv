539730,Guest,2004-05-20 09:13:00,0,"does any one know if all the dams onthis river are open and and not holding back any water.apparently the natives want a govt. pmt. or they won't let the dams be closed to fill lakes. was at crooked and round lakes this wk. and couldn't get boat in either one cause of low water.wondering about katepwa, echo etc. thanks"
539738,Mike M (Sask),2004-05-20 11:09:00,374,Hi Frosty40! Or can I call you Jack! :D :D :D Here is a link to all the current lake levels for lakes in Southern Saskatchewan.http://www.swa.ca/WaterManagement/St...LakeLevels.asp
539740,Guest,2004-05-20 12:35:00,0,i am not jack and i can't understand the info i.m getting on the site you suggested.i live in n. dak. 10 mi. s. of sask. border and we take vacations there every year. last year these lakes were low but worse now.maybe you know whatis going on? thanks
539745,Mike M (Sask),2004-05-20 13:59:00,374,"Jack was a punn, as in Jack Frost. Anyway, I don't know alot except that I know the provincial government settled some of the Native issues on some of the lakes. When I look at the site I listed above I select the current water level. From there I look at, for an example, Diefenbaker Lake. I compare the first column number which is the Desirable Summer Range, in this case its 556.86 Then I look at the current level which is 551.77 Subtract the second from the first, which in this case is 5.09 Now this shows as of May 1/04 Diefenbaker Lake is 5.09 meters low. This translates to 16.97 verticl feet low. That's quit a bit I know, I've been on it this year and it is very low, however Dief is a 200 ft deep reservoir that is 580 miles around it and that is it's intended purpose. Here is a text forcast from the same site that will probably answer more your question more than anything. Hope this helps you out. Provincial Forecast Qu'Appelle River Basin Forecast The very dry soil moisture conditions throughout the entire basin have had a significant impact on the 2004 spring runoff volumes. Despite good snowpack conditions in most areas, the 2004 spring runoff was limited throughout the basin. The spring runoff helped fill most of the smaller dugouts and reservoirs; however, the larger lakes only recorded a minor rise in water levels. Flows in the Qu'Appelle River continue to be augmented with releases from the Qu'Appelle Dam. Releases were staged up to 10 cms by mid April to help supplement the limited spring runoff flows in the Qu'Appelle River. The interim agreements reached with the Pasqua and Muscowpetung First Nations allow replacement of the logs at the Echo Lake control structure. In early April the Craven control structure was opened, allowing the augmented flows to split naturally between Last Mountain Lake and the downstream Qu'Appelle lakes. The structures at Crooked and Round Lakes have remained open since the fall of 2002 and will most likely remain open during 2004. The upper Qu'Appelle Lakes (above the Katepwa Lake control structure) are expected to be at their normal operating levels this summer. Crooked and Round Lakes are expected to be well below their normal operating levels this summer.

539751,Guest,2004-05-20 15:32:00,0,thanks mike.how is fishing at dief. now days?was up there a couple times but run off had water so muddy didn't have very good luck.that was at kyle. good fishing i got water levels figured out now.
539758,Mike M (Sask),2004-05-20 15:58:00,374,"Spring time is usually good at Diefenbaker for big walleye. I've only been there once this year (last Sunday) and it was a little slow but we did manage to get a few including a 9 lber. I probably won't get a chance to get back up there for a few weeks though, I'm heading to Nothern Manitoba for a week. Good luck & Good Fish'n"
