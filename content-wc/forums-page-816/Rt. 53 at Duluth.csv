539775,Guest,2004-05-21 00:00:00,0,just as the other guy said turn left sometime before the big bridge at dluth . we stop for the night at the black bear cosino by the expressway. makes for an interesting evening. sometimes it pays for the trip!
539509,happy,2004-05-13 21:22:00,34,Is Rt. 53 still detoured at Duluth? If yes when is the new work to be finished?
539510,Guest,2004-05-13 21:35:00,0,"Yes, just came through there today. Don't know how long it will be closed."
539564,Guest,2004-05-16 09:47:00,0,"If you are heading north on 35 to Duluth, go through Cloquet, missing Duluth, and pick up 53 north of Dulth. Saves a LOT of time"

539612,downriverbob,2004-05-18 06:17:00,880,I went that way last year and basically was drive on a road with no one else around. It will save you a lot of time and trouble.
539637,Guest,2004-05-18 17:38:00,0,"Take the Hwy 33 exit at Cloquet. That will take you through Cloquet, and catches Hwy 53 north of there."
539645,rebelrn2001,2004-05-18 21:39:00,1563,What about 53 coming from Superior? Is that much of a problem? We will be driving through there Friday.
539715,Guest,2004-05-19 18:33:00,0,Anyone: We will be coming from Rice lake WI. to I/Falls. Is this the best way or how should we go around. Thanks in advance.
539725,Guest,2004-05-20 07:37:00,0,"I'm in the same boat as Confused. We are coming up Hwy 53, northbound on Thursday, 5/27 and am wondering if we should be concerned about this construction. If so, what is the best way around it? Thanks in advance."
539727,Guest,2004-05-20 08:02:00,0,"I was in Duluth yesterday. Here is what I do: There are 2 bridges connecting Duluth/Superior from Highway 53--you need to take the Bong Bridge. When driving through Superior, take a left turn on Belknap Avenue (stoplight across from the Barkers Island exit and just before Perkins). Stay on Belknap as you go through town (just keep driving straight for a few miles). You will cross a bridge over the railroad yard and at the stoplights after that, the Bong Bridge is to the right. After crossing the Bong Bridge, turn Rt. again at the second set of lights and turn Lt. after 3 blocks at the second set of lights (40th avenue). Once on 40th, just keep going straight past stop signs and stoplights for a few miles until you hit highway 53 on top of the hill. Sounds complicated, but is really an easy drive. 40th Avenue is uphill all the way."
