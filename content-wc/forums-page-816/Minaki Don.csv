539802,Guest,2004-05-21 12:59:00,0,"Reels, You might want to try me May 30th after 3 days of fishing, and then again 2 or 3 days later for an update. I will e-mail you the particulars. The water temp yesterday at the Birch Island Resort dock was 42 and across the lake on the shoreline that leads to the main river 47. If the water temperature doesn't get up in to the 53 plus range, I am concerned that the crappie and smallmouth might not be shallow. The forecast temperature wise for the first few days that we will be fishing looks to be 5-8 degrees below normal at this time. Don PS: You can feel free to post the fishing report here if you want when I am up there."
