539597,Gary_IA,2004-05-17 13:29:00,144,"My brother and wife, my 13 year old nephew, myself and perhaps another brother are looking for a drive to resort for a few days vacation in the first part of August. We may go to Canada or a resort in Minnesota(Chippewa National Forest area) or Wisconsin (Eau Claire chain of lakes). As a general statement it appears that the Ontario resorts may be more willing to taylor the schedule to fit needs in August than Minneosta or Wisconsin resorts and it appears you get more for your dollar for the type of resort that we are interested in. Its the long drive from northwest Iowa that gets me and my brother who will be driving up from New Mexico. We have been to Canada before but not to Coppen's Resort or The Fisheries. Where is ""Bears Pass""? Anyone have any comments on August fishing and the quality of the resorts? Any other nice resorts near border?"
539622,Guest,2004-05-18 09:22:00,0,You might try Buena Vista Resort on Lake of the Woods. It's 45 minutes from the boarder if you cross at Baudette and Rainy River. Reef walleye fishing is usually still good in August. Look at buenavistaresort.com for info

The fishing is great for big Pike (up to 20 pounds, but expect only 10 pounders). We catch our best Eyes in the grass while Pike fishing. Our biggest Eye was 10 pounds, but there quite a few in the 4 - 5 pound range. Smallmouth is also very good with the largest near 5 pounds. We normally fish the end of June, so don't know what to expect in August. Just contact Frank at the Fisheries for August info. By the way, the Fisheries is 25 miles east (route 11) of Fort Francis on Bear Pass which then takes you into Red Gut bay. This is the North East arm of Rainy Lake. Hope this helps. Pathfinder"
539726,DAVIS_VIEHBECK,2004-05-20 07:48:00,15,"Depending on what you want to fish for, I'd suggest ""LaBelles Birch Point Camp"" in Northwest Bay or Campfire Island near the causeway in Fort. Campfire does almost exclusive smallie and pike trips while LaBelles will cater to your needs in terms of species. -davis viehbeck"
539752,Gary_IA,2004-05-20 15:32:00,144,"Thanks for input for all those posting. I enjoy reading the recommendations and learning about new places to fish. As with many multi party fishing trips + family events, scheduling will affect where we fish this year. Even if we don't make Canada this time, you have pointed to some interesting resorts for future Canada trip. Thanks again, Gary"
