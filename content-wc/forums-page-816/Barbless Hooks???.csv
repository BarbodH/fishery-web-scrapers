Rumor of some returning fisherman said that there hooks were all taken at the border to include crank baits. I know there are certain areas which require barbless hooks but, I did not think all of Canada had this regulation. Also, has anyone had any trouble taking fresh meat or milk accross the border? Thanks for all the information."
