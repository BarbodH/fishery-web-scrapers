539746,Guest,2004-05-20 14:02:00,0,We are leaving for Canada on June 4th and are traveling from Northern Illinois. We will be on I-94 till Eau Claire and then take US 53 North. Is there some way to bypass going through town that will be easy with the boat trailers?
539749,Guest,2004-05-20 15:12:00,0,There really is nothing that is going to save you any time. Its a pain. Just pray to the stoplight gods for mercy.
539754,rpieske,2004-05-20 15:39:00,1276,Not yet! But there is one being built that will come in before you hit town and rejoin right at Chippewa Falls. It might be ready next year.

When it is finished, it should be a snap to get through ....."
