Will be doing our first fly in trip through Big Hooks Resort about 185 miles north of Red Lake. Here are my questions;1. What about live bait? Is it even necessary to bring crawlers along?2. What takes up the majority of a person's fly in weight? We have a 100 lb limit per guy including groceries although much of the necessaties are provided through the camp.3. Anything you forgot on your first trip that you won't be without on future trips?4. Anyone familiar with Big Hooks and their operation? They seem like a great bunch of people up to this point in our planning.Thanks for any help.'tick"

We have been with Big Hook three times, It is an adventure getting to but we enjoy it and Steve and family are great people and will take care of all your needs. Most of our weight is bottled drinks. and of course a couple extra tackle boxes that never leave the cabin. Don't forget a couple cans of spray for the facilities. We have never failed to catch a ton of fish . I am pretty sure you will be happy with Big Hook."

We consider them to be very cheap insurance. Some times we never get them out. Other times things seem real slow until we do. Never know how it's going to be until we are there. Divided among several guys, the cost and weight of a flat of crawlers is minimal. If the Gulp is working, great. If not, break out the worms and give them a try."
1298873,SinOrSwim,2011-04-24 19:24:00,1528,"Take the live bait. Save weight by taking things out of packages. For instance, if you take advil don't each one of you take a bottle of 500. Take one bottle or take them out and put in a zip lock bag. If it's a fly in, you can take 1/2 the amount of underwear and socks you are planning on. I know, you are thinking no way. Trust me. Take a pair for each day and see how many come back unworn. LOLYour suitcase itself is heavy. Find lightweight duffle type of bag.DRY BAG!!!!!! DRY BAG!!!!!! RAIN GEAR!!!!! Good quality RAIN GEAR. Nothing worse that getting everything wet. Including feet and clothes.And, good luck. We dont' have weight limits. They complain but they just fly stuff in a day or so later. Extra beer, soda etc. They are coming in anyway. Plus, one BIG reason we keep going back to the same place. We enjoy our trip and like to take extra stuff. If I had to have a weight limit, I probably wouldn't go. But, that's just me."

1298923,trapperbob,2011-04-24 20:52:00,45,"Ask them to fly in water ahead of time and bring powdered drink mixes like propel etc. Freeze a few liquid plastic drinks and use for ice in cooler on trip to camp. Thaw drink and remix for drinking later. No glass, too heavy. Beer in cans helps keep weight down. Instead of usual coolers get styrofoam disposable. They are alot lighter and can be burned when you leave. Less to carry home. Wear your heavy clothes rather than pack. Also wear your heavy boots. Don`t count against weight if you are wearing them. Have a good time and dont forget portable fishfinder."

Seems we all think we need to bring a 10lb box of jigs. When in reality for a group of 6, a couple well stocked Jig boxes would be plenty. A couple dozen spinners and Crankbaits and you have enough for Walleyes, and an assortment of Spoons, Spinners,Topwater baits, and Husky Jerks and you have what you need for Northerns. It all adds up in wieght. As far as food try putting all the ingredients for a meal for your group size out before you go and see actual portions needed. No sense in taking to much extra of anything. Eat lots of fish. The less crap you take the more BEER you can take!!!! 3. Take a roll of duct tape, a small assortment of Rod Tips and a little tube of super glue and a couple extra rods for the group. Accidents will and do happen and something is always broke. A Vise Grip, medium size Crescent and Screwdriver with changeable tips and a pair of pliers always is nice insurance. But only one set for group! 2 pr underwear, 1 Swimmin suit or pair of shorts, pair or 2 of jeans or warm-ups, couple fishin shirts, couple T-shirts, wool sweater, Hoodie, good raingear, waterproof shoes or boots. couple pairs socks, stocking cap, ballcap, and sunglasses. All that can fit in a small Dry Bag or duffel Bag. And don't forget a pillow(old pillow u can burn or leave in cabin) and sleeping bag(light weight). 4. By the looks of thier website looks like a great place and a good price. You will have a BLAST!!!"
