1299255,tlee,2011-04-25 20:00:00,65,I'm heading to The Pas / Flin Flon MB area fishing for Walleye and Lake Trout in mid June. What is the best way to fish for Lake Trout? I have access to down riggers but I don't want to install them in the boat if I don't have to.
1299296,kliph,2011-04-25 21:44:00,2337,I don't know what the water temperatures will be there.But Lakers like cold water and will be close to the bottom.Try running 3 ways on the bottom in water 50 deg or colder.Troll slow(2.0 mph+-) with spoons.Good luck.
1299298,oldblue2008,2011-04-25 21:47:00,313,"At that time of year they should still be near the surface. When we used to fish for them in northern Sask, early June they would be in the top 20 feet of water, and we trolled for them, using spoons, len thompson's and kitimats worked well. maybe bigfishhunter will chip in, he is from Flin Flon area"
1299632,Gibson,2011-04-26 17:55:00,17,"If your fishing the Flin Flon area, the lake is Athapapuskow and we anchor, chum hard with sucker, tip a 3/4 or 1 ounce jig with sucker sitting right on the bottom with your chum. The big ones,(30-40 pounders) are on bottom, look for structure in at least 80 feet. Structure being a hump or wall, we scan with sonars and look for the fish before anchoring.The majority of the floatilla will be found at McKenzie point on the big lake. Bakers Narrows Lodge can point you in the right direction as far as getting there, lodging ,etc. Very few downrig but it will pay off in numbers, but the hogs are deep.Walleye in that area can be caught in Pickerel Bay on the small lake of Athapap. or Barrow narrows, again the lodge has maps. Most Walleye hunters don't spend too much time on Athapap. but key in on several of the other closer lakes like Neosap, Neso, Alberts(bring a quad) hogs in Alberts....Good luck in Gods country....."
1299691,Thor29,2011-04-26 20:12:00,36,"Gibson is right. At that time of year the lakers are anywhere. Troll around and you wil get numbers but if you want something big, jigging is the way to go. The humps off Mckenzie is a good place as well as fishermans point. The far end of Clearwater at the fish bowl is also a good place to start. Jigs and sucker is the way to go."
1299835,tlee,2011-04-27 07:56:00,65,Great info.....Tell me more about using chum? Where do you get the sucker?
1299988,Gibson,2011-04-27 13:10:00,17,"We dip net them this time of year when they are in spawn mode. Although if you can't get out and get your own, most lodges up north sell them(pricey though). Cut a hunk of bait for your jig and cut your chum the same size as what you baited up with. I leave my jig right on the bottom with as tight a line as you can and wait. Most hits (even the bigguns) are usually nothing more than what seems to be a perch tap. Hit it hard and fast."
1300074,tlee,2011-04-27 17:03:00,65,I have access to frozen smelt. Would they work like the suckers?
1300575,Thor29,2011-04-28 19:54:00,36,"smelts are not as good as sucker. you can get some up here at almost any gas station or at the lodges. Bakers Narrows should have some if your around there. Viking Lodge in Cranberry would if you decide to go to Second Cranberry lake or Athap from there. If you go to Clearwater, the gas stations or the two tackle shops in The Pas would have sucker. You will need afew, so buy afew bags when you find some."
1300610,Northern Manitoban,2011-04-28 21:08:00,195,"I fish Reed alot for lakers as i have a seasonal campsite there its close to Flin Flon and some lakes you might be fishing, Mid June if you have a downrigger i would bring it, if you dont want to haul it, buy some deepsixes to get your lines down , they work amazing and catch fish, i always have a few in the boat, usually mid june in this area temps are warmer and fish are starting to go deeper, last year we were out on the 12th of June and we were already catching lakers at 40+ feet some were shallow but not many. Im guessing ice will be off 3rd week in May on these lakes so wont take long for the lakers to head to deeper water. deepsixes in a few different sizes for deeper depths is a must, they are well worth it, i've got many laker anglers onto using these over the years."
