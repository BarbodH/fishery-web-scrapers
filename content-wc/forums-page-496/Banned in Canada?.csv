I can personally attest to the fact that after our 22 hour drive, they were both still frozen solid. Had to pour beer on our rice krispies that morning when we got there! Snap, crackle, and burp!"
1298078,Mr Ranger,2011-04-22 11:14:00,272,That is because all the Bears and VIkings Fans are hiding in Canada and there is no more room Actually I will fish with anybody including B & V fans. Where is springtime?
1298545,Mark R,2011-04-23 19:36:00,1538,"Steve, How would you say the prices at Wilson's were compared to what you pay in the US? What about selection? Would the price of groceries in Ear Falls be off set by driving a smaller vehicle that got better gas mileage?"
1298554,whitedot,2011-04-23 19:49:00,8,"Best answer anyone can give you, call border services Canada. Also the main stuff like your fishing gear, food (potentially not potatoes), and non alcoholic bevs can be brought in. What EXACTLY do you have questions about? And banned in Canada? Nothing fishing related that I know of. Also if you south of the border folks want to bring your own groceries in, who cares its not a big deal. Its more convenient to you, you're saving a couple bucks, you dont have to worry about currency, and you're still supporting the fundamental reason why you're coming up in the first place through fishing licence/crown land permit sales. Have a good trip!"
1299280,Burr,2011-04-25 20:54:00,8612,"Once you get to know some of the Canada store owners, I've found them to be extremely accommodating to match our travel times. Pro-Am Tackle in Winnipeg is one that comes to mind. We call ahead, and he typically offers to open his store when we come through - he has us call again when we are leaving customs and he has the timing down when we would arrive. Simply unbelievable. Those evenings he sticks around so we can purchase our licenses on our way, I typically drop an extra 50-100 buying some things that I could get elsewhere for less.Anyhow - seems to me there are special rules for bringing meat over the border as well. It has to be labeled by a commercial processor or something like that. We almost lost our Venison jerky one year, but the processor's label was accepted."

IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO THE SHOE WAS ON THE OTHER FOOT"
1297455,CI_Guy,2011-04-20 19:38:00,2118,Dan Quayle must have taught spelling at Walleye Central Elementary School. Only 2 people can spell potato!
1297470,midwest,2011-04-20 20:04:00,25,I'll keep my $10 and spend $5 buying a 15 lb bag down here.
1297482,JayM5209,2011-04-20 20:32:00,1050,"Huh?? I only saw one misspelling. Someone left the ""e"" out of the plural form.Merriam-Webster says it's spelled potato (singular) and potatoes (plural).Didn't Danny boy put an ""e"" on the singular form of the word?P.S. The way around the issue is to leave all the spuds at home. A bag of rice, a box or two of dried au gratins, a box or two of pasta...... But, then what would we talk about the last two months before the 3rd Saturday in May?"
1297489,Guest,2011-04-20 20:59:00,0,Ya but for the extra 5 bucks I include a map of the lake your going to fish and mark an X on the honey hole
1297561,tv4fish,2011-04-21 07:21:00,2694,Excellent reply there midwest
1297604,chocho1971,2011-04-21 08:50:00,16,Just take frozen french fries they cook faster and use less oil to fry. If you want them for breakfast cut them into pieces and fry them in a skillet.

1297667,Steve Ediger,2011-04-21 11:23:00,97,"We have been going to the Ear Falls area of Lac Seul for a long time and we took all our food the first year because we didn't know if there were grocery stores near our destination or not. We needed to go to Ear Falls to get bait and fishing licenses and discovered that yes, they do sell food in Canada. Over the past few years we have gotten to know Mr. Wilson at Wilsons' Food Store quite well and consider him a good Canadian friend. We look forward to stopping in to see him every June and August. He gets to see how our son has grown and we get to see the latest pictures of his grandchildren. I think the shopkeepers in Canada really appreciate our business and I enjoy seeing them. By the way, Mr. Wilsons' potatoes and produce are usually much better quality than we can get at home anyway. It makes packing for the trip easier when you don't have to worry about the groceries."
1297759,chocho1971,2011-04-21 16:19:00,16,Maybe you should stay home and go to Long John Silvers People are giving ideas to help other people
1297294,SteveJ715,2011-04-20 12:54:00,59,"Does anybody have a link to a list of items that you can't bring in to Canada? Obviously the big ones they seem to ask about are booze, guns, knives and bait, and we're well-versed in the rules on those items. But I seem to recall some years where they've had some restrictions on food (potatoes, for example). Are there food items you buy after crossing the border because of these restrictions, or have they mostly been lifted? I'm asking because it would be nice to cut out a trip to the grocery store on the drive up. We still have to stop and buy some items anyway -- milk, eggs and so on. But it would save time if we could cut out a stop on the way up and just stock up on those last few perishable items before we get near camp.Thanks as always, everybody. - Steve"
1297348,Guest,2011-04-20 14:48:00,0,potatoes are not allowed (buy the gallon cans of pot. there already cooked )we take every thing else with us so dont have to stop. we dont worry about fresh veggies they dont go well with fish and beer.
1297359,Freytown,2011-04-20 15:09:00,770,"Q. What is prohibited to bring into Canada?A. List as follows, *Radar Detector. *Live minnows, leeches, or worms (night crawlers) unless not packed in dirt.*Dog Food. *Potatoes. *Fire Wood. *Military style attack rifles.*Large Capacity Cartridge Magazines (Exceeding 5 rounds for centre fire rifles)http://www.canadawelcomesyou.net/faq.html"
1297373,JDP,2011-04-20 15:46:00,1457,"There was a WC great debate last year on potatoes going across the border into Canada. I believe the final word was potatoes are OK...check this website, scroll down the page:http://www.beaware.gc.ca/english/brirape.shtml#a120 kilograms = 44 pounds per person--------------------------------------I think the Canada Welcomes You website is not reflecting the change."
1297379,JayM5209,2011-04-20 15:58:00,1050,"Freytown, this web page was last modified in February, 2009. Last year (2010) the potato ban was lifted. However, when bringing potatoes you must be able to show that they come from a source that allows them to be imported, i.e., from a producer that meets the Canadian standards for being disease free. The easy way to do that is to bring an unopened 5 lb. or 10 lb. bag that has the pertinent information printed on the label. Do not grab a plastic bag in the grocery store and fill it up with potatoes from a bin of loose ones. I don't think you'll have a problem with potatoes . . . didn't last year."
1297394,oleJoe,2011-04-20 17:03:00,114,"Great, I was just going to post about the potatoes to get the debate going again LOL . We cross at Soo Ste Marie and have never been asked about poatoes. Although they did ask a lot of different questions last year. We had no problem taking 10# in for fries."

1297447,Guest,2011-04-20 19:19:00,0,Every time i see the potato post I just sit and laugh My god if you can't afford to buy spuds up here Why bother coming. You should stay at home and look for a better job....LOL
1297450,midwest,2011-04-20 19:23:00,25,It's not about affording them. No stores are open during the late hours of the night when many people travel to their camp. I don't drive to Canada to go shopping. I want to spend my time fishing.
