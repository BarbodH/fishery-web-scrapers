1300898,rdbalmer,2011-04-29 16:59:00,279,the owners are very nice people. The cabins are clean and rain and bug proof. The cabins are in no way fancy but were in my opinion very acceptable. Some had indoor bathrooms and showers and some didn't. If it matters to you tou should clarify that before booking. The resort is on Big Vermillion Lake which is an excellent muskie/smallmouth lake and a so-so lake trout lake. I saw the average size lake trout drop off alot in the 20 years I vacationed up there. There isn't a fishable walleye population in that lake. You are about 5 miles from the boat landing on Lost Lake which is on the SE corner of Lac Seul. It is a nice landing and there is some excellent fishing within just a few miles. You don't have to travel all the way up north to catch all the walleyes you want. Rick (the owner) has a boat landing right at the resort to access Big Vermillion. One other thing I really liked was the 3 small brook trout lakes you can portage to. Check them out on the days the wind blows too hard to enjoy a day in the boat. We had lots of fun over there. There is a nice fish cleaning house and an extra shower house available also. I won't tell you it is a 5 star resort because it isn't but I found it adequate and the prices were very fair. It has been 4 years since I was up there last but it will be where I go when I can make it back.

Rick is a great guy and I'm sure you will enjoy your stay there. I love the smallie action on the lake (Big V) and also fishing for the Lake Trout. Rick helped put me on both fish. Also lots of muskies in the lake though I didn't target them. Had quite a few chasing my topwater smallie baits. Would agree with the other poster concerning the cabins, I have stayed in better ones but they are clean and get the job done."

As other posters said, some cabins have bathrooms and others don't so make sure you know what you are reserving. We trailered to Deception Bay landing for walleye fishing and fished right on Big Vermilion for smallies. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."
