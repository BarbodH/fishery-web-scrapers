1299521,Mike Kansas,2011-04-26 12:37:00,1463,"Bill, I sent you another PM. Call me I think I know how you and your buddy can have a GREAT TRIP. I left my home number in the PM. Mike Kansas"
1299528,Mike Kansas,2011-04-26 13:05:00,1463,"You are allowed to use a livewell on Lac Seul but the fish must be dead. We put ice in the livewell and place the dead fish in it. Best Regards, Mike Kansas"
1294806,wallydave,2011-04-14 16:12:00,2151,"Lac Seul does not allow you to use live wells. Some have posted here they use the live wells on their own boats for minnows, Your catch on LS has to be dead in your boat, boats come with coolers and ice at Goose Bay."
1299043,DROP SHOT,2011-04-25 09:39:00,10,black bear camp in nestor falls has nice boats family owned and operated and will take go care of you and do anything to make your trip one of a kind.
1299053,J Arendt,2011-04-25 10:12:00,45,"In the Red Lake area I would suggest Golden Hook Camp located just south of Red Lake on the Gullrock chain. Everything about this camp is first class. Cabins are clean, camp boats are better then what I fish out of and the access to the big lake and other hot spots is very easy. Gullrock is an easy lake to get around on all kinds of pike and walleye fishing within a 5 minute ride from camp."
1299064,nd89sc88,2011-04-25 10:46:00,92,"I looked at Golden Hook, and it looked really nice. The problem is that they have cabin minimums (3 is the smallest), and I'm just going with one buddy, so we'd have to pay extra . . . maybe a different year when I can assemble a larger group. Thanks, Bill"
1299068,wallydave,2011-04-25 10:54:00,2151,"Check out Goose Bay near Ear Falls, they have smaller cabins available."
1299072,teddi,2011-04-25 11:06:00,349,evergreen on lac seul also has smaller sleeping cabins for a resonable price. gold eagle also has a smaller cabin for a couple people.
1299082,Pezman38,2011-04-25 11:40:00,3196,"Wrights camp will accomodate 2 guests and their cabins are top notch. Excellent rental boats if you need one, and great docks if you bring your own boat. Been going there for 7 years now, has a great location if you have a smaller rig, or rent a camp boat. Fish Keg when it is blowing, gull rock all other times. Tackleman is right on too, if you don't catch fish on either Keg or Gull Rock I would give up on fishing."
1299108,J Arendt,2011-04-25 12:50:00,45,nd89-- The folks at Golden Hook will work with you on the cabin min.-- check it out.
1299125,Mike Kansas,2011-04-25 14:16:00,1463,I second the recommendation of Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul. They are as good as it gets and will meet your requirements. If you want to talk let me know. Mike Kansas
1299390,GWC,2011-04-26 07:47:00,1021,We've used Poplar Point Resort on Gullrock for the last 4 years. They can accommodate 2 & their equipment is top notch. The owners have made our trips close to perfect every trip & we're headed back again this year.http://poplarpoint.com/
1292940,nd89sc88,2011-04-10 06:23:00,92,"As I understand it, you drive almost there and then take a short boat ride to the resort . . . And the costs are in line with your typical drive-to . . . I'm trying to avoid the big price jump that accompanies many fly-ins . . . Plus I'm a little cautious about planes. ;-)Bill"
1293070,teddi,2011-04-10 12:27:00,349,"50 miles down a gravel logging road , then a boat trip up the river, then a portage, then another boat trip to the camp. your choice."
1293204,chosenone_intraining,2011-04-10 18:29:00,55,"I was talking about Tomahawk resort. It is a drive-to, about 2 hours north of International Falls. Sorry I wasn't clear. Good Luck where ever you choose."
1293296,teddi,2011-04-11 04:52:00,349,i was talking about anglers kingdom.
1293343,camp chef,2011-04-11 07:37:00,915,"I'll send you a p.m. when I get time....I can't wait to get back there,but it is not for every body."
1293347,tackleman,2011-04-11 07:47:00,444,"try Gullrock Lake just south of Red Lake.There are 5 lodges on the lake and they are all good. The lake is very productive and if you can't get fish on Gullrock, they you should give up fishing.5 Lakes Lodge was just bought by my neighbour and they are really a great young couple who love to fish and enjoy the outdoors. South Bay on Gullrock is basically an RV type camp but they have 2 big cabins and a 1 bedroom cabin. they have great docks and all the facilities you would needBoth these camps also have corporate membership at the Red Lake Golf and Country Club and you can take advantage of these for a day of golf if you get bored with the fishing.Poplar point Camps has many new cabins and is in a sheltered area up the bug river and this would allow you to fish even if it is blowing like a son of a gun on the big lake.Golden Hook is a larger camp (more cabins) and has good docking and is operated by another great couple who know how to take care of their guests.Procyks camp is on the two island lake portion and is just a quick 5 minute run into Gullrock, it is an older camp but the facilities have been well maintained and the owners are a nice young couple.Wrights wilderness camp is on the Starrat Channel and is between Red Lake and Gullrock and is 5 minutes into the main portion of Gullrock.All these camps will make you feel welcome and help you in any manner they can. Check their web sites out for more information.Gullrock has walleye, perch, northerns, whitefish, some rock bass, burbot (but they are rarely caught in the summer) and the odd lake trout ( that forgot to swim back to Red Lake before the ice went out)."
1293796,wolverine fan,2011-04-12 10:30:00,71,"Take a look at Rough Rock Lodge, short boat ride and great boats. I mainly fish for smallmouth and northerns and its a great fishery for both."
1293805,Ralfeee,2011-04-12 10:47:00,33,"I have not been to Anglers Kingdom, but my neighbor went and had some issues a couple of years back, but he was also sick during the trip, had the flu. There has been some conversations on this board from time to time about this camp, but Kevin does give his side of what happened, so I will not pass judgment, as I have never been to his camp. My neighbor did say the boats were really nice.My group goes to a differentl lodge on the same lake, and all I can say is it is a great lake for trophy Northern and lots of walleye."
1294662,outdoorsron,2011-04-14 10:52:00,843,Hello: I also would look for one with a livewell. I just can't drag my fish around on a stringer all day. Either that or take a cooler of Ice with you. Good Luck O R
1294664,Guest,2011-04-14 10:59:00,0,"Hawk Lake Lodge, about 30 miles East of Kenora. Its right off of the Trans Canada highway and is the only lodge on the lake. It also has a whole bunch of other lakes with private access. They have nice boats and I think the new owner said he was buying newer ones this year with live-wells, 18 feet long, electric start engines etc. hawk-lake.com is the web-site. Great fishing."
1292374,nd89sc88,2011-04-08 08:30:00,92,"Looking for recommendations for a northern Ontario resort that is drive-to and which has nice rental boats. By nice, I'm thinking well maintained and include depth finders, and in perfect world, trolling motors. Will be heading north the last week of June hunting for bigger pike (so cooler water) and frying pan walleye. Maybe Lac Seul? Other lakes recommended? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks, Bill"

1292390,wallydave,2011-04-08 08:59:00,2151,"www.lacsuel.comAndrea has up grade boats available, sorry no trolling motors. gas and minnows are included in the package."
1292422,jswinter40,2011-04-08 10:19:00,127,On Lac Seul the lodges you want to look at are Lost Island Lodge and Silver Water Wheel Lodge. If money is not an object then SWWL is the one for sure. If you don't want to break the bank and have a great resort with excellent boats then LIL is the one I would recommend. lostislandlodge.com There are many many lodges on the west side of LS that I don't have experience with but many on WC do. I would imagine they will chime in.good luck.
1292615,Robert Cardenas,2011-04-08 19:33:00,138,"Check out Bonny Bay Resort. There boats have 50 horse 4 strokes with RPM adjustment, depth finders, trolling motors. These boats are nice and the kicker is you get free gas each day. Check it out www.bonnybay.com they are located on Lake Wabigoon. Good fishin. I will be up there first week of June, this will be my 10th year."
1292759,NARDA 1,2011-04-09 10:04:00,636,Check out www.birchdalelodge.com or call 807-227-5262 Nice drive in facillity and they have upgrade boats with 40hp electric start and graphs. 1 or 2 of the upgrades is available with trolling motors.
1292825,teddi,2011-04-09 16:14:00,349,not a drive to camp
1292834,chosenone_intraining,2011-04-09 16:54:00,55,"I would be very impressed if you could tell me of a resort that exceeds everyone's expectations better than Tomahawk Resort. Outstanding facility! The docks are the best I've seen in the area, the lodges are top notch, and the staff is first class. Only negative I can say is they're a little stingy with their minnows. As for your preferences to boat rental, the pictures of their equipment s exactly what you'll get. New Lund with Yamaha's, Lowrance HDS 5, and Minn Kota trolling motor on every rental. I feel like I'm a publicist for this place. http://www.tomahawkcottages.com/"
1292847,nd89sc88,2011-04-09 18:34:00,92,"True, but not a fly-in either. This is fine. I'm seriously considering this Anglers Kingdom. Anyone who has been there who can give some insight? Looking for both pluses and minuses. Be objective y Thanks, Bill"
1292865,chosenone_intraining,2011-04-09 19:46:00,55,i thought you said a drive-to.
