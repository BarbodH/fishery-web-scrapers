I had a bunch of guys tell me they wanted to do the trip all winter, until we got down to brass tacks, and then suddenly I was down to just one. And he just bailed out because he boss told him the other day that he couldn't take a full week off at that time. So now I'm on my own, and looks like I won't get any takers, which means I'm out, too. It really bums me out. Bill"
1300720,5thsuit,2011-04-29 07:49:00,54,"Our normal trip is the last week in May, moved it this year due to my youngests graduation. Our group is around that 50 age group and I never envisioned having issues finding 5. I have always had a large backup list, As we have 4 guys who can only make the trip every other year, of course this is the off year for them. Several years ago a Canadian resort owner told me the 4th was their slowest week due to family commitments, maybe I should have listened! Hopefully we can fill in 60 days, its a great fishing area!"
1300726,wallydave,2011-04-29 07:55:00,2151,"Bill, I have been there myself. Several years ago my boat and cabin buddy, plus the rest of our group, 6-8 guys switched weeks and alke due to a pregnancy. I was not able to switch my vacation, so foe about a month, I wondered what to do, so I ended up taking my son, at that time in jr. high, up north for a son and dad tent camp trip. We had a good trip, had some weather, caught some fish, enjoyed spending some time together. Now our group is down to my boat and cabin buddy, his two boys, his wife in one cabin, I am taking a new guy this year in a different cabin. We could put a cot in for ya, we leave Cen. Il June 3rd, and head north to Lac Seul, Ear Falls area. Good luck!"
1300892,teddi,2011-04-29 16:40:00,349,try evergreen lodge in ear falls. they have small sleeping cabins for one or two at a good price
1300946,Golden Eagle,2011-04-29 19:26:00,2642,"Bill, one person trips work fine. It might cost a little more money for only one in a boat. Just don't empty the fuel tank every day and don't knock off any lower units. Take the camp owner a couple gallons of fresh strawberries, 5 dozen ears of sweet corn or whatever is in season. They don't especially like booking a singleton, so come up with something they do like. I've made several October trips alone. A few times I've been out the driveway only 16 hours after deciding to head up yonder. It works. Look for solutions. They exist."
1301106,bpetersen,2011-04-30 08:15:00,251,Having very hard time getting people to commit to go this time. Combination of economy and gas. We had two drop out a couple of years ago because of DUI from a few years ago.

1300390,5thsuit,2011-04-28 11:13:00,54,"We have been making the journey north since 84 and have never struggled to fill up. This year we are heading to Headwaters Lake/Cobham river and seem stuck at 3, would like 4 or 5. Flyin cost $1250 leaving June 30 returning July 8. Our second trip to this lake. The July 4th week seems to be the problem. Group takes off from Madison, Eau Claire and River falls area if anyone is interested, shoot me a message? Are other groups having issues filling? Is it the economy or is the 4th just a bad time/ to many family conflicts?"
1300481,Guest,2011-04-28 14:56:00,0,We lost two because of DUI issues and not wanting to do the PW and spend the $ to get back into Canada. So we are down to 4
1300484,5richards,2011-04-28 15:10:00,131,I'm curious about your past success at this location -- pls send a pm
1300516,NARDA 1,2011-04-28 17:16:00,636,My group is down by 2 due to the economy.
1300578,Fishin Fun,2011-04-28 20:02:00,218,Currently we are doing ok. We have 6 and a possible 7th with 2 boats. Last year we were down to 4 though. We're hoping for the 7th to split some of the gas cost. That's getting out of sight.
1300592,Further North,2011-04-28 20:21:00,2008,"Yep.Worked hard at it for a couple of months...then said screw it, just two are going."
1300625,rather-be-fishin,2011-04-28 21:46:00,429,"Yes, I am finding it harder & harder to fill our group. This year our group is down to 4 ......normally we have 8 up to 12 going. Group getting older, problems getting time off work for others, don't want to commit so far in advance, wedding conflicts & rising gas prices...."
1300663,Pooch,2011-04-29 06:00:00,4619,"My wife and I always make a 4th of July trip to one of several lakes in Canada. Many years ago the camps were not busy then, but the last few years we've noticed that the camps are busier during that time period. ""Guy"" trips during that same period may be harder to put together as most of us want to be with family over the ""fourth"" as that is the big summer get together for a lot of families.The ongoing problem for most groups is getting everyone to commit early to the trip. I mean commit with cash for the deposit! A small dedicated group of four is the easiest to hold together over the years. Then as the group grows larger from time to time there is always one person who has something come up and bails and then we are scrambling for a replacement at the last minute.Everyone has the same problems when planning trips with friends. Not a big deal, but sometimes frustrating as what one guy does can effect everyone's vacation. Doesn't always have as big of an impact on trips using our own boats, it's more of a problem when using camp boats and trying to keep it to two guys per boat. Or the number of guys effects the cost per man for the cabin rental. One guy jumping ship can then raise the price of the remaining friends trip.Always in interesting annual conversation at this time of year on this board.Pooch"
1300672,jdoaks,2011-04-29 06:11:00,89,like was stated we have 4 that always go we bring our own boats 2 per boat always want a fifth to hlp with gas cost. we always have lots of yeses until money is due.5 work perfect for cabin and boats we like to switch up in boats so none fish with the same people all week it makes it fun.
1300679,Bill Krejca,2011-04-29 06:31:00,6107,"No problem finding folks to go, we have a ""reserve line"", in case someone, or more can't go. Bill"
