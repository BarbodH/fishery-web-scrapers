Will be there for the opener and want to have some new senery other than tons of boatsAny info would be great thanks
1300269,teddi,2011-04-28 06:38:00,349,"go from ear falls to steamboat and then to shanty and then to poplar narrows and then to altimiter creek. go up the creek to get to broad lake. watch for rocks in a couple of places on the creek. if you don,t want to see a lot of other boats go some place else. broad and sunlight are very busy the first month or so"
1300285,JDP,2011-04-28 06:47:00,1457,The signs I am seeing is the water level will be quite good for the spring. Travel to Broad and Sunlight should be quite easy? How is ice out coming along?
1300301,teddi,2011-04-28 07:18:00,349,"the water is quite low right now,should come up with the melt up north soon. looking at normal levels for opener. the ice is slow melting this year. calling for snow and cold this weekend."
1300315,wallydave,2011-04-28 07:50:00,2151,"I just heard from Andrea, at Goose Bay, near Ear Falls. She is predicting a May 15th ice-out. No word on the water levels yet, that will depend on the rain and the melt!"
1300321,teddi,2011-04-28 07:56:00,349,"the big part of the lake,east of manitoba point will still have ice on it by may 15. sawmill,steamboat and south bay will be open. just my guess looking at past years."
1300370,JDP,2011-04-28 09:51:00,1457,Very much appreciated!
1300372,MikeMcC,2011-04-28 10:20:00,72,"It will be a long haul, depending on the wind/waves. I probably don't need to warn you to be careful, but plenty of areas to smoke a lower unit. I wouldn't make the run without a kicker."
1300667,gravelrash30,2011-04-29 06:04:00,14,"We have fished this end for 12 years and can catch walleye after walleyeand we have a blast , just wanting to see what can be so much better by the big sand banks and the two smaller lakes (broad and sunlight), we had a couple groups in camp that went there every day and didnt have much to say about the fishing . they always had fish and always went back so must be good. I know if you fish lac seul a cant catch fish you should sell your boat because its more like going catching not fishing love this lake.Also would like to take my dad to try for big pike. does anyone have some suggestions on where to find them."
1300676,JDP,2011-04-29 06:18:00,1457,"What are the dates for your trip?Timing is important when answering your Sunlight, Broad, Sandbank and big Pike questions.Thanks."
