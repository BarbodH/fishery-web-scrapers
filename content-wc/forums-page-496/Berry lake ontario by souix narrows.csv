It has not been surveyed so no lake map or chip with depth/structure. Anything as to locations to try, colors, rigging, bait etc. would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"
1298113,camp chef,2011-04-22 12:53:00,915,Do you mean Dryberry Lake?
1298525,Guest,2011-04-23 18:37:00,0,"Berry Lake is just north of Dryberry,you can portage into Dryberry from Berry Lake.""Carks"" is probably asking about Berry Lake Lodge.Good lake trout fishing,northerns and smallies fair to good at times.Theres no walleye in Berry that I know of,if were talking about the same Berry Lake that is."
1298610,troutaholic,2011-04-23 22:49:00,827,"Dryberry is trophy Muskie/Lake Trout lake with a great abundance of Smallies......the alkaline level does not support walleyes at all. Last time I was there, no lodges existed on Dryberry Berry lake loaded with walleyes and Northerns. Berry Lake Camp is located on Berry Lake. You used to be able to portage from Berry to Dryberry, but I do not think that the lodge that used to be at the mouth of the river is no longer there.......he leased all the cabins off. Fishing on Berry is excellent. Our party was interested in catching eater-sized walleyes, and we never went hungry. We always fished northeast of the Berry Lake Camp above/between the islands."

I am going to Berry for Walleyes and have never been there, just was hoping to get some good info to get on some spots and catch some fish. So if you have any specific locations, colors and baits that worked I would very much appreciate any info you can give. Thanks"
