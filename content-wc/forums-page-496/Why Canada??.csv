1301674,Golden Eagle,2011-05-01 16:30:00,2642,"wmd, be on time. If Peter Kay says he'll meet you at 7 a.m. that means his airplane engines will be hot by 6:30 a.m. and he'll be ready to head north well before 7. With Pete you can count on a great experience."
1301679,wmd,2011-05-01 16:42:00,388,"Golden Eagle- Fished at Birch 3 years ago with Peter, absolutely the best fishing I have ever had in both numbers and quality. I know what you mean, the man is ON TIME.wmd"
1301709,Golden Eagle,2011-05-01 17:44:00,2642,"Pete won't hire an employee who smokes, drinks coffee, or drinks cokes. He wants somebody to work with both hands. Coffee drinkers should be school teachers. All in fun, of course."
1300909,T Mac,2011-04-29 17:31:00,10084,"I like buying gas for $4 a litre. Naw...really it's dealing with those wonderful US Customs officials when you come back. Or, maybe it is 'cuz I get to speak with my impeccable ""Canadian"" accent. Seriously... it is the terrific fishing opportunities and hanging out with the friendliest folks on earth- The Canadians!."
1300976,captaincanada56,2011-04-29 20:22:00,17,"thats because we need to be on our guard when were in the US. we still think that you all are still mad after the vancouver 2010 games. hahahahahahahaha!!! joking!!! i always thought that canadians pride themselves on friendliness . especially while socializing with non-canadian citizens. i know i do, and enjoy socializing with americans when in travel south of the border. sorry to hear that. even our country has a few bad seeds!!!"
1300985,captaincanada56,2011-04-29 20:32:00,17,"hahahahahahahahahaha!!!! ahhhh, the ol canadian accent!!! gives you the chance to use the word ""hoser"" and sleep on the chesterfield, clean your face with a serviette and drink ""pop"" instead of soda. i swear, we have more fun making fun of ourselves than anything else. glad you appreciate Canada as much as we do!!!!! happy fishing this year!!!"
1300986,MidWestFishman,2011-04-29 20:33:00,44,"Wow- where to start on this one! My Dad and I went in 1979 and while where we went was lousy fishing, poor equipment, and we almost went down in a terrible storm, we had a blast of a time. We made many trips back to a variety of lodges in 3 provinces. While the fishing was usually excellent with many trophies, it became a special time each year for us to get together. We could have fished where we lived but the solitude, fresh air, remoteness, and total relaxation where we could just leave our world behind, drew us back over and over. The call of the loon, seeing wildlife, the wonderful shorelunches and having a great time with the guides was icing on the cake. We also found the people of Canada to be friendly and always helpful. Dad is gone now and I have made 2 trips alone because I love fishing there and partly because I think Dad would be dissapointed if I wasn't still going- it was a tradition. I am going to a new lodge this year and at 56 I know I have more trips behind me than ahead of me so I savor every minute of the planning, the travel and the fishing. I will keep going to Canada as long as I am physically and financialy able. I can't imagine a better vacation."
1300994,Bigstorm,2011-04-29 20:43:00,799,my thoughts exactly
1301058,tv4fish,2011-04-30 05:23:00,2694,"The beautiful scenery, the remoteness, chance to see moose (at a distance, of course ), much better Northern Lights than here in the U.S. and the chance to spend a solid week with good friends."
1301069,Babamel2,2011-04-30 05:58:00,414,"I took a year of schooling in Canada. One thing I noticed and appreciated was an attitude about the world that was different. It seemed more like we are all in this together, compaired to what I have often felt in the US that often I sense an attitude of ""we are number 1 and we will do what it takes to keep anyone from being here with us."" I realize this is a quick generalization and may well be no more than one person's experience. I love my country, as well as, have a love for Canada."
1301097,Freytown,2011-04-30 07:42:00,770,"Why Canada? Probably because it is our northern neighbor. If it was another country, I would still head north...if I was welcome.We Americans are lucky to have such friendly northern neighbors."
1301326,Nimstug,2011-04-30 20:32:00,2605,"Yeah, how many other countries in the world could we share a ~4000 mile border with? For how many years?Back to the subject at hand:1. Quality fishing.2. Remote but not distant (for me anyway).3. Quiet.4. No phones, voice mail, computers, or cars - we do a boat-in.5. Nice people from the stores to the motels, baitshops, and lodges. 6. Getting to see the Milky Way reflecting off the water on moonless nights.7. No Canada, no hockey. No hockey, no Blackhawks."
1301672,wmd,2011-05-01 16:24:00,388,"Because I live on the prairie and get to spend a week with nothing but trees, rocks and water surrounding us. A week of remoteness, quiet surroundings, not much noise except loons, and boat motors. No phones, no computers, no email and no pressure but to catch fish, which is low on my priority list but important. I am going this year on a fly-in with KayAir out of Ear Falls to Birch Lake. Going with 2 of my best friends and most importantly we are taking our sons. They will most certaintly enjoy it even though they are all adults, at times they never grow up in a dads eyes. Just filled our turkey tags today with my son. He is my buddy and hunting and fishing partner.wmd"
1300807,captaincanada56,2011-04-29 12:36:00,17,"That thread about the best memories in Canada was a fun read with lots of great stories. I thought this one may be a good one. Asides from the fantastic fishing in northern Canada, what else do you love about the great north? And how did you decide to come to Canada? For me, my favourite part of this country is the scenery on the drive up north, and I love being out on the lake in the evening with the sun setting, and theres not a soul around for miles except your family and friends who came with you. i cant wait until my daughter is old enough to bring her up north for a week of fishing and truly enjoying what Canada is really about. And of course, the fishing not too bad either!!!"
1300811,camp chef,2011-04-29 12:43:00,915,"No phone,No television,no phone,no computer,no phone"
1300813,Jack77,2011-04-29 12:57:00,168,"Other than the exceptional fishing which of course is number one.We love the adventure that is invovled in going that far north. The experiences that can be had in northern Ontario, shore lunches, sun sets at 11:00 PM, stories that are retold for years, desolation, and of course friendships."
1300831,IaDave,2011-04-29 13:40:00,476,The scenery was great the first couple of trips but hiway 502 now is 2 hrs of boredom. Besides the fishing being great I totally agree with what campchef wrote.
1300834,Bill Krejca,2011-04-29 13:57:00,6107,"Sorry, just reminds me of another country song,""Too Much of a Good Thing is a Good Thing."" Bill"
1300875,NARDA 1,2011-04-29 15:39:00,636,I agree with all the above. And yes the 502 is a PAIN!!!!!
1300880,phishfearme,2011-04-29 15:48:00,1242,in the US you (and everybody else) can drive to every lake - in NW ontario you can drive to SOME lakes - most require a significant effort - either by float plane or canoe tripping or portaging. that's why canada for me. phish
1300893,wallydave,2011-04-29 16:41:00,2151,"I keep coming back to Canada for several reasons.1. Excellent fishing, size, numbers and tasty! 2. Remoteness, remoteness, remoteness.3. The lack of development, no tv, phones, pagers, e-mail.4. Peace and quiet.5. Making memories and building relationships.6. The adventure of fishing in the wilderness."
1300894,teddi,2011-04-29 16:44:00,349,so take 71 instead
1300904,rebs,2011-04-29 17:22:00,7587,"Canada seems to be cleaner without all the trash along the highways and parking lots. I like all the wilderness and fresh air.What I don't understand is Canadians seem to be more friendly over there than they are when they come over here. I know some of them get a rap for throwing crap out in walmart parking lots, but thats only a few and we have that kind right here as well."
