Everything seemed positive that I read so I ordered some Dr Juice and bought some preparation H.Now I stumbled across a web site for Northern Walleye Lodge in Ontario. The owner clearly states that in northern waters in Ontario if you use scent you will not catch walleye. I know that where I fish by Red Lake Ontario, my friends that have tried Gulp have had no success with it.Should I use the stuff I bought in Ontario for walleye or not? I would hate to stink up my boat and my jigs and ruin my trip."
1298695,troutaholic,2011-04-24 08:37:00,827,"Perhaps the scent of ""X brand"" does not match the food source the walleye are used to? I know that using Willowcats on the Mississippi is one of the greatest 'eye candy available. Try using willowcats in Mille Lacs/Lake of the Woods/Rainy Lake/other major lakes, and you might as well stay back in the cabon - no bites!!!! Based on your data, it does give more credence to the use of scents than before. If it doesn't work on ""XYZ"" lake, but does work on ""ABC"" lake, that tells me that it is a viable option on certain lakes. Boy, that will Berkley some additional Marketing/Sales!!!"
1298699,SoulFulCry,2011-04-24 08:58:00,158,"not sure what lake u fished by red lake ontario but i know for a fact that scents n scented baits work well on red lake such things as gulp alive n trigger x stuff i use alot of the artificials n have had really good success with them, also us the scents on my crank baits n i noticed a better catch n hook up ratio with gulp alive sprays in minnow n crawler, give them an honest try n u will see that it will work on any lake, mind ya live bait can work great to but id rrahter save alot more money on artificials than pay the prices for leeches n minnows n crawlers pretty spendy i can catch just as many fish on those products n its cheaper in the long run , hope this helps ya some"
1298735,Basinman72,2011-04-24 11:09:00,29,"Thanks for the input, I fish Gullrock. My fishing partner has tried gulp for about 3 seasons now with no noticeable difference. This year he is leaving it home. Have not had luck with plastics either. 6 to 8 inch minnows seem to work best. I'm willing to try anything, but I know once I get that scent on my fingers it will be there all week so I want to make sure I get this experiment right."
1298801,T Mac,2011-04-24 16:19:00,10084,"Think about that... If scent works, then scent works everywhere. Do some lakes have walleyes with no ability to ""smell""? If you don't bring the scent...at least bring the Prep H...it may save the day for ya."
1298811,jiggster,2011-04-24 17:12:00,183,"My son and I have used gulp by Ear Falls for the past few years. For us it has worked well. I still prefer live bait, my son will catch the same amount on gulp. It does make a difference for us if you put the gulp on straight or if you rush and leave a little curve. Our success goes down when we rushed. We now are vary careful with measuring where the hook will come out so the gulp is straight."
1299019,Freytown,2011-04-25 08:26:00,770,I use Smelly Jelly as a cover scent & attractor with good results. SJ lasts a long time & is easy to apply.Have applied it on cranks & plastic tails/swim baits. Try it.
1299370,troutaholic,2011-04-26 07:16:00,827,"I am thinking that if the walleye in a specific lake is not used to that scent, it would not hit it. If the scent is something that they can relate to, they will eat it. MY analogy of willowcats is a good example of what some walleyes see as ""good eats"" and others wondering where that ugly critter came from."
1299825,BrianZ,2011-04-27 07:30:00,18,"same here. i always figured it covered up my scent and being doused in bug srpay up there, i always had a jar handy and applied every couple dozen casts."
