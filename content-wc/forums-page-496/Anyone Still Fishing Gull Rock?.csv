1299936,Guest,2011-04-27 11:28:00,0,Anybody know where to fish northerne at ice out. Going there May 12? Got some frozer creek chubs and taking my kids. Would say many thanks to any replys. TC
1300072,tackleman,2011-04-27 16:53:00,444,"look for shallow bays, I know a lot of guys fish the stone bay and around the mouth of bug river in the early days after ice out. they just put a big dead minnow or cisco on a line and then sit and wait for the fun to start.I tried it one year with a camp owner and wasted 3 hours just talking to him and never had a bite. but who knows, maybe you got the right stuff to get the job done."
1300193,Guest,2011-04-27 21:05:00,0,I would go with a quick strike rig if using live or dead bait. Two years ago I saw a large stick bobber moving around by shore in the Bug and was lucky enough to snag the line. One end was the bobber and the other a 41 inch northern that was gut hooked so all I could do was cut the leader and hope it lived. There are some nice northern in there and good fishing practices should be used to keem them swimming. Kevin C
1058039,Moondog,2008-09-30 09:17:00,362,So is anyone still fishing Gull Rock? Are those big mommas still biting. Just wondering........been home 2 weeks and wish we were still there.
1061171,Guest,2008-10-19 18:40:00,0,Went out on Gullrock Lake Oct.16/08. Two resort owners got together to try our luck. Temp was around 45 F. We caught 30-40 oversize walleye in about 10-14 feet of water using a jig & minnows. We decided to end our day at 3.00 pm no matter what was happening. We end our trip with another double header of walleye. Both took our limit of eaters home. Perfect ending to another fishing season.
1061208,tackleman,2008-10-19 22:26:00,444,"I was out the past couple days fishing off the point in front of my house, I spent 2 hours and got 5 eaters (all released) and 1 27 inch northern the first day then on day 2 I spent an hour and trolled the shoreline to the mouth of bug river and only got a perch but I marked a lot of fish so i guess they are still out there, just not hungry or too keen on chasing bait."
1061620,Moondog,2008-10-22 08:42:00,362,"Tackleman, Do you live on that point by South Bay? Do you know Mary Spencely?"
1061726,tackleman,2008-10-22 18:59:00,444,"Yup, that's my place. Mary will be heading south sometime in the next couple weeks for the winter. She is still looking for a place to rent for the winter and she has a couple of areas she is checking out.I'm heading out tomorrow to try my luck one last time, unless it's going to be nice for the weekend , then I might keep the boat in a little longer.It's been a little cool here but I guess as long as the snow isn't flying, it's fishing weather."
1061744,Moondog,2008-10-22 21:46:00,362,We spent 5 weeks there Aug 6 to Sept 11th. We are worried about Mary since Harry died. If you see her tell her that Mike and MJ asked about her. Thanks.
1063123,tackleman,2008-11-02 16:32:00,444,"went fishing off my dock today for an hour,got 1 small northern and a 13 inch walleye. The temperature was +10 and the lake was flat like pee on a plate. Wish I had the boat in."
1063128,Golden Eagle,2008-11-02 17:01:00,2642,"Tackleman, does your neighbor, Kim, ever help you catch a meal of walleyes."
1063284,tackleman,2008-11-03 18:17:00,444,"No, right now he's busy trolling the shorelines for moose."
1063935,tackleman,2008-11-10 14:39:00,444,"Bug river is frozen solid and there is 30 feet of ice and ice crystals along the shorelines, I guess the walleye are in for the break until we get enough ice for snow machines (late december)."
