My uncle used to count on Mid May for Gouin area, early June for Mistissini/Albanel. These accurate predictions were 1970-80 era but we had a old fashion winter in NE. Most of the VT lakes went out this week with a lake or two at elevation still holding on."

I clicked on AERONET Subsets map on the rectangle that includes the southern tip of James Bay (it's called AERONET_Chapais). I chose the MODIS Terra view (250m). You can see that lake Evans is completely iced over except where the Broadback River comes in near Kirk Island"
