1299972,GNO,2011-04-27 12:37:00,153,"The Canadian govt makes the rules. The rules are the rules of each country, but the big problem is with the discretionary part at the border. If it was cut and dry it would be allot simpler and less of a problem. A simple solution would be to not allow anyone with a DUI to drive while they are in Canada. It would be pretty simple to put in the system or hold the persons drivers license until they leave the country. It is not as easy as changing the law that is currently in place, MADD will protest it to no end and which ever politican pushes for the change is committing political suicide. The biggest issue to resolve is the discretionary part and eliminate the $200 rehab fee. Last I knew paying $200 did not make anyone less of a criminal or rehabilitated. If that is all it takes to get rehabilitated they tell everyone at AA to pay $200 and be saved."
1299991,teddi,2011-04-27 13:16:00,349,you could be like some other camp owners and just hire another american instead. there are more americans working at canadian camps than canadians. a friend of a friend or someones kid that needs a job for the summer.
1300007,Fisherman Ted,2011-04-27 13:44:00,461,"Easier said than done. Very difficult to get a foreign worker into a Canadian business. Its a long process an owner has to go through to do so and the Canadian government frowns upon it. Just to get ME into Canada to run my own lodge took 3 months! You have to show that you were not able to hire locally, with job postings etc. before you can even consider bringing in someone from across the border. Normally you can do that with highly specialized skills. Not the same for a cabin cleaner. With the job market pretty tough in Canada there is no way I could say I was not able to find a dock hand in Canada. I have received hundreds of resumes. But you are not getting my point. If I can't have a guest come across the border due to past indiscretions I am not hiring anyone, Canadian or otherwise....."
1300018,teddi,2011-04-27 14:20:00,349,sorry but you miss my point. lots of americans hired under the table for camps. not saying you do this but some do. also this thread is getting off the topic.
1300194,cruiseforever,2011-04-27 21:05:00,177,What I find sad is that there are so many Americans with DWIs to make this a big issue. I know in Minnesota there are many vehicles with the whiskey plates. A ton of money going to the insurance companies and lawyers.
1300243,Skywagon,2011-04-28 05:13:00,1106,"Have you noticed the last couple of years, how there seems to be a lot less emphasis on WC, about how much people are going to drink when coming to Canada to fish? I think the % of WC readers talking about that were probably small, but they were vocal. Maybe the economy is weeding that segment of society out and some had to make the choice between drinking hard at home all the time, or a Canadian fishing trip. Maybe the DUI's being talked about were some of those guys that finally got caught. At any rate, it is too bad for the the occasional drinker that got caught with a DUI and can now not come to Canada, but getting drunk drivers off the road, no matter what the circumstances, is a good thing. Being held an example is only a bad thing if it effects you. It is also too bad that things have gotten slow enough that camp owners need these people to survive. For the rehabilitation fee, maybe Canada is sending a message, the US should do the same. Nothing wrong with drinking, it is a Canadian institution, just don't drink and drive, all will be well."

Is it only the same crime WITHIN the first 10 years or is it any misdemeaner or petty misdemeanor AFTER those first 10 years? I don't understand what what be classified as a ""suitable"" offense to be turned away after 10 years of a DUI?secondly, after you have gone through the entrance process and ""rehabilitated"" do you have to go throught the same thing at the border each time afterward or is ""rehabilitated"" in your Canadian file at a touch of a button at the border?Jinx, Do you really believe that there isn't any vigilante patrols that are taking money on there own or is there really a hard fast rule and process when dealing with all people crossing the border with these rules? seems hard to believe with what seems of hundreds of storys of different processes depending an what border patrol you get. be careful who you condemn. not everybodies story is of grossly drunk people driving down the wrong sides of roads. with 0.08, really means who can't have any alcohol and drive home, not even 1-2 while having a meal with your wife on your anniversary. 0.08 is really minimal. Hold on before you blow your top. i am not making excuses for people as dead loved ones is a serious matter, but just saying a am willing to bet 90% of DUI's Canada is turning away are of people who don't pose any more threat than a bus of Prohibitionists"

1299814,GNO,2011-04-27 07:16:00,153,"This is ridiculous. I am Canadian and am in the tourism industry. I talk with people from both sides of the border. Drinking and driving is not a good thing and no one condones it. That being said, I would guess that most everyone has done it at one point or another. They might not admit it and were lucky enough not to get caught. We do not want hardened criminals crossing the border, but to classify DUI's in that category is crazy. If the penalties and sentences are fullfilled, they have paid their dues. I know many locals(Canadians) that get pulled over and are over the legal limit and are told to go home immediately or even followed home by the OPP. It seems that the penalties are so stiff that not all OPP want to issue a DUI unless the person is severly intoxicated. Do I think this is wrong, not the common senses part of it, but if the penalties are to severe that not all the law enforcement wants to issue the citation is. I would have to say that I know just a many Canadians that drink and drive as Americans. If the law was the same crossing the border for DUIs going each way, it would more than likely make some changes. The worst is that there are no strict guidelines that are followed when crossing the border. It is up to the discretion of the officer handling the case. Should be a simple list to follow, then no one would get confused. I would just like to know how all the hardened criminals that have DUI's and play profeesional sports are allowed into the country, I would bet there is another set of rules for them."

1299910,Guest,2011-04-27 10:04:00,0,"Well the Canadian Gvernment decides on what consitutes a infraction that puts Canadians at risk. Same as the American government decides what border rules apply to Canadians when we enter or fly over your country.....and considering the airport rules that now apply (because Canadian governments want to cooperate with American concerns for 'terrorism"") despite some of the flight rules being ridiculous , we do our best to understand. I guess we hope the same understanding would occur from American tourists coming here."
1299921,Fisherman Ted,2011-04-27 10:47:00,461,"I just lost a reservation today because one of the two guys realized he had a DWI in the last 3 years and would have a huge hassle getting in, if he could at all. Cost me nearly $3,000 or to put it another way, two months of my electric bill. But its not just me that gets hurt. The crown lost all the revenue they would have generated from HST and fishing licenses. Sad thing is other companies lost too: the airline, car rental, tackle store, beer store etc. Multiply one reservation by say 3 or 4 and now I hire one less Canadian to work at my lodge this summer. Nearly ALL of that lost revenue would have been re-invested back into the Canadian economy. From motors to food to staff. Economically, turning away guests at the border hurts many more than just the lodge owner. It also affects the Canadians themselves. The crown is just shooting themselves in the foot. Ted"
1299925,Mohleye,2011-04-27 10:52:00,368,"I think GNO hit the nail on the head. I have no time for those who complain about the rules and laws when they travel to another country. If you don't like it, stay home. The problem here is no one seems to know what the heck the rules are...you may be this, you might be that.... who decides? And based on what? If the Canadians want to take such a hard line, then just say no admittance for 10 years (or forever or whatever) and be done with it."

If one pays a sufficient amount of money, he is then considered ""rehabilitated"". No psychological exams administered by The Crown or anything of that nature, just pay your money and magically you are an acceptable person. He is referring to a person pulled into the customs building and being told he can't come to canada because of a Dwi 6 years ago and then the guys asks ""isn't there anyway I can go"" and then the immigration officer says if you pay $200-$250 you will be deemed rehabilitated and let him go on his way fishing for a week. I have seem this happen a few times over the past 7 years at the Fort Frances Customs while paying duty on goods. It only takes a few minutes.I believe this is what he is calling a money grab, there are not tests or exams - its a couple hundred bucks and you are through.

A tourist with a 4 year old DUI, nothing else, is refused entry to Canada to come and fish.......contribute to the economy. Nobody can show statistics proving the ""apparent rampage"" that existed before this crackdown. Was NW Ontario awash in drunken US tourists raising cain and endangering the lives of the local residents? I don't believe so. I do know the results of this has caused a decline in tourism revenues for NW Ontario businesses. Of course, this doesn't impact the major centres where politicians can spin this crack-down on crime to their own advantage. So back to your question.....""who wants US tourists here who are convicted criminals""? If there only crime is a fresh DUI, or several in fact, I would say YES. When you can prove to me how they are a danger to Canadians, then I may reconsider."

You make very clear and concise sense on the heart of the subject about why it makes sense for the Canadian Gov. to rethink it's position concerning DUI and their # 1 tourism trade being the USA fisherman. "" We"" need to understand that politicians will always put the dollar ahead of the common sense approach reasoning. We are one people on both sides of the border that drink alcohol but differ about the severity of the punishment. I personally think it hypocritical that that the severity of the crime of a USA citizen is taken more seriously than a Canadian. The punishment doesn't fit the ""crime"". I have a very personal issue with this being ,my son can't come fishing with me because of one mistake that didn't hurt a soul 2 years ago. By the time the Canadian Gov. forgives him, I'll be gone, and so will the memories we could have made while I was here. Too bad. Ok, i'm finished, but thanks for listening. Good Fishing to all !!!"

You'd rather CANADIANS pay the fee from our already outrageous taxes so some idiot with no common sense can come fishing here and buy a few worms? Give me a freakin break.There is NO excuse for drinking and driving in this day and age. Cabs are available, common sense is available if you choose to use it, and if you do something so stupid in your own country what would prevent you from getting hammered and behind the wheel of your boat only to either kill some poor kid or themselves. Either way we then have to pay for a rescue or search to find bodies. Our police and coast guard have to respond on OUR tax dollars for their stupidity. I have no sympathy at all."

Now most of the time it's just the 1 guy that stays back but I have heard many stories of the entire group staying back. Over the past 7 years, the resorts on the us side of rainy like Thurderbird Lodge, Island View, and Sha Sha have really benefited from the DWI rule at the border, the guys still want to fish - so they just fish in the US.I agree that if the US border would stop canadians with DWI from coming into the US (especially now that canadians are crossing like crazy in I.

I have more problems coming back to the states than going north, but I have very few problems either way. I have had a border guard ask for the key to my truck cap when coming home and when I got out of my truck she put her hand on her pistol and told me to get back in the truck and stay there unless told to get out.

He is 28 now, but three years ago he had his first and hopefully last DWI. He completed all the community service, is paying $100 more a month for insurance, etc. etc. The official policy is that anyone with a DWI conviction in the U.S. may not be admitted until 5 years has elapsed and the lengthy certificate of rehabilation has been completed. This is the same application which a murderer or rapist would use, so you can imagine how labor lntensive it is. We actually tried it and stopped halfway through the process because eventhe Canadian government was confused and after we had photos, signatures, etc. they sent us the wrong form and we would have needed to start the process all over again .So for the last two years we hold our breath, I drive and then we have made it across the border, but this has really added a level of stress to the trip.Does anyone know of anyone who has been turned away for this? I could see where they would not allow him to drive in Canada, but this seems extreme. He knows he made a mistake and has totally changed his behavior and it is the only time he has ever done anything like that. Awaiting others answers...."

My cousin hired a lawfirm to fix the issue for him. All said and done, it cost $450 (US) for him to get it removed. However, the firm did all the paper work for him.

I found out that a DUI in Canada is a felony. I paide a lawyer $500 to fix this only to be turn down the next time when I went to training school in Winnepeg. It is simple I think as the Canadians don't care to have us come and spend all that money up there anymore. I also think they are tired of us showing them how to catch their own walleyes!!!!MJV
1122199,WalleyeWally28,2009-07-19 16:32:00,298,I have heard of several people being turned back at the border. Several years ago 3 guys I know had a bear hunt and fishing trip planned and mostly paid for. Two of them had DWIs and were not allowed into Canada. The customs official told them not to try another crossing as they were in the computer and would not make it their ether. Two years ago the owner of our camp told me that so far that summer a dozen of his guests had been turned back. Sounds like it's just the luck of the draw if you get caught or not.

Our group of five or six fishermen always takes a couple cases of beer. I always take my Old Grandad and have one on the rocks when we get back to camp in the evening and before heading to the fish cleaning house. I have absolutely no problems with Canada's policy on DWIs. There is nothing unreasonable about barring entry for five years to noncitizens who have what is defined as a felony by the host country. I wish first offense DWIs were a felony in every state in the US, with mandatory jail time that escalates with each offense. No problem to me if the third offense means lifetime forfeiture of the driver's license. Humbledbyexperience, my comments are not directed to you and your son. I hope things work out and you have a great trip together. I just need to rant occasionally when I keep reading about how import alcohol is to many people's fishing experiences (just count the number of threads and posts in this forum on the subject), and how many people think we Americans are so much wiser than our good neighbors to the north....or to the south or the west or the east for that matter."
1122315,Guest,2009-07-20 07:22:00,0,Excellent post....Our laws have been tightened even more. The limit now is .05 for a suspension of 12 hrs and a fine. This is 1 or two beers for the average person. Over .08 is DUI. Impaired boating brings the same penalties as DUI.
1123783,humbledbyexperience,2009-07-25 10:16:00,2,"Hi, Thanks for responding. I agree that people shouldn't drive drunk and that there should be penalties, but the whole idea is to change behavior and the punishment should fit the crime. Especially when one is young and makes a mistake and has paid for it. After all, this is just about a kid wanting to fish with his father. I could see where he wouldn't be allowed to drive in Canada, post a bond, pay more for a fishing license (to have proceeds to to educate people on the hazards of drinking and driving, etc.) I just think that one DWI should have the same status of other felonies and even so, there should be a way to prove that one has changed. To me, it is about a measured and sensible reponse. Not to mention that there are lots of dollars at stake for local communities. I'll let you know if we make it this year. We have for the last two. Thanks for the respectful discussion."

1297578,Guest,2011-04-21 08:04:00,0,Since the Canadians prevent American tourist with a DUI from entering their country I would like to see the United States institute the same law for Canadian tourists entering the US and see how they like it! I bet they would repeal their law then.
1297590,orchard frank,2011-04-21 08:27:00,1900,"I can understand your frustration. There are instances where the policies seem to be pretty harsh, but we are visitors there, privilege to cross border going in either direstion, for citizens of both countries. I also know a few folks who have attempted the paperwork, often just giving up. Doesn't seem to be a clear-cut procedure. Two of the groups that have been affected by the DUI situation have just changed destinations, and are staying in the US. One group goes to Devils Lake, ND, loves it there. The other has tried different locales from Minnesota, Great Lakes, and even the Gulf Coast of Texas, had lots of fun and good fishing. It is not the fly-in experience, but it is still about friends, family, and a road trip, without the stress of the border."
