1298423,Jahloaf,2011-04-23 11:07:00,74,"This year I want to try and bring back a few perch for a fish fry back home.Always caught nuisance perch when jigging for eyes and never targeted them. That being said looking for what works best for landing some decent perch. I have heard the night crawlers provide good results but would smaller red worms work better? What about presentation? Slipbobbers, jigs,?I can catch all the walleyes that I want but with the limit of perch being generious I thought might be something to target so I can bring a few back to the states,, ,Thanks in advance"

In fact, some years when we've hit the weather/water temps right we've brought limits of 50 jumbos each home.1. The most productive, by far, over the years has been a 1/16 oz. maribou crappie jig, chartreuse or yellow, under a slip bobber with a 1"" or 1 1/2"" piece of crawler. If they're really hitting and you're in a school of them, just drop the jig over the side of the boat minus the bobber.2. 1/32 oz. Mini-Mite jig under a slip bobber with 1"" piece of crawler. Assorted colors, but yellow, white, chartreuse seem best.3. If you want to do some casting with your ultralight rig, use a small Beetle Spin (yellow or white) with a 1"" piece of crawler.Finally, a 1/16 or 1/32 oz. panfish jig with a little tinsel mixed in with the maribou is often good. Don't forget the piece of crawler.You won't get into the jumbos just any old day you decide to go for them. A shallow, weedy bay where the water is warming faster than the main lake is where I'd start looking. Anchor or drift in 3' - 8' of water. Moving around until you find 'em, often they'll br buried right down in the weeds. Many times a bright sun with chop no more than moderate is best. Use ultralight rigs or a fly rod. It's a blast. . . and excellent table fare. When walleye fishing (which is what I go to Canada for), I always have one or two ultralight rigs in the boat so if we pick up a jumbo perch or two we can spend 45 minutes or an hour filling the livewell with them before we go back for the 'eyes.Good luck. You'll have a ton of fun."

1299007,wallydave,2011-04-25 08:05:00,2151,"I have been to the Ear Falls section of Lac Seul for over ten years. At the beginning we never caught perch, but over the last several trips without targeting them, we are catching maybe 5-10 per day and niced sized ones as well. Jigs and minnows while looking for walleye. The pattern seems to be weeds and humps, the perch are first, then walleyes are next, followed by pike! Nothing like pike on your light or ultra light gear!"
