Saw a resort in Sioux Narrows post/picture this week that showed 16"" of ice on Regina Bay. Got me to thinking, did I schedule too early? Do I need to move my trip back?"
1298756,rpieske,2011-04-24 12:30:00,1276,"The ice will be well gone by then. The latest I ever remember in over 50 years was May 16th. And that year the season started a couple days later and we caught lots of walleye. All you have to do is locate them. They might still be pretty deep depending on water temps. If there is still rotten ice on the lake (highly unlikely) you will witness one of God's nicest pictures. Sparkling ice, tinkling sounds and a real serenity. Regardless, you will enjoy the trip. No need to reschedule."
1298785,djmz1998,2011-04-24 15:16:00,2,I will be up in the Sioux Narrows area the same week and I am looking forward to it. The Walleye bite will be fine ( once you figure out the pattern). With a late ice out the Lake Trout will be very shallow and I would imagine the Pike fishing should be pretty strong as well. Not sure if my normal Walleye spots will work but looking for new ones makes it fun too.
1298875,Wall-i-Lama,2011-04-24 19:32:00,1524,Take warm clothes! I've fished it in early June and and that was too early for me. We go up on July now. Fish can be caught here at mid day on the hottest day in July. Have a good trip!

1301085,bellbuoy,2011-04-30 07:06:00,490,"Looked at Tomahawk site today, they had pics from 4/29 and it was much better. Redwing is encouraging, too. Thank you gentlemen! I think we'll go. I've been to the Boundary Waters that early, but not LOTW that early. I know weather can be more iffy, but that time slot in the vacation schedule at work and the openings at Witch Bay, this time period fit our scheule best. My son will definitely want to move the trip back next year, he'll be 15-1/2 on 6/2/12 and can get his Learner's permit so he can help drive."
