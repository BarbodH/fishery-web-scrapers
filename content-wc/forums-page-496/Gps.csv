I'm looking for a GPS unit that I can take to Canada fishing when I'm using the resort's rental boat. I'm guessing that I'm limited to a handheld unit, but since I'm not too techy, someone can correct me if I'm wrong. What are you guys using? Do you like what you have? What would you recommend? Also what chip should I buy? Navionics? Thanks, Bill"
1299040,stinkycat,2011-04-25 09:30:00,2018,https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...light=portable I followed Jim's advise and put mine on a Blue Genz box. Now I will find a portable bracket for the transducer and then I will be set. I have an HDS unit that I did this with for ice fishing and it worked great.
1299047,joeman79,2011-04-25 09:51:00,417,We have done both ways with GPS. One guy has a Lowrance H2O Handheld with a Map Chip and we have 2 HDS Depthfinder/Gps Combos made portable. Have Hot Maps Navonics Canada Chips that work well on Lac Seul but I do not know if they have many outposts lakes on them. I know that ours have worked great on Lac Seul. And Handheld and HDS units I am sure would work great on any lakes but do not know what lakes would be on the chips.
1299083,Pezman38,2011-04-25 11:43:00,3196,"Great suggestions here. Used an H2O for a year when nothing else was around. Both Humminbird and Lowrance make portable units, and conversion kits. Just find a suction cup for your trasducer, or mount a transducer to a board and use a C clamp on the transom. I have done both and they both work well. Now I bring my own boat and just leave the electronics where they are."
1299153,new hips,2011-04-25 15:30:00,498,"I bought a Garmin etrex for $79 at Bass Pro earlier this year, it works great and use it Canada or if I'm going hiking. (small handheld 2 AA Batt)"
1299284,SinOrSwim,2011-04-25 21:00:00,1528,"I have a Humminbird 595c and love it. It is a power hog however. So, I have a flexible solar panel that weights nothing and takes up no room that I attach to the unit while fishing. About the size, shape and consistency of a flexible cutting board. I essentially made a dual connector to attach to the battery. Then, one pigtail goes to the solar panel and the other pigtail goes to the unit. This way, it charges the battery as I go along with anytime I turn the unit off. For shore lunch etc. It is in a portable case. You can buy the conversion kits on-line for about $100. Comes with the case, battery and suction cup transducer. So, when we go back to canada and can literally go back to the exact spots. Plus, there is a group of rocks outside our cabin that we have to slow down for. I have plotted the middle and can now buzz through there quickly without fear of hitting a rock."
1299679,jkoebel,2011-04-26 19:58:00,10,I use my iphone. We used it last year and it works great. The Nav maps only cost $10 on the itunes store and they are the same you get on the chip. This year I upgraded to the HD version for the iPad since we use that for the navigation on the houseboat. It works great for Lac Seul.
1299837,rnnonmt,2011-04-27 07:59:00,992,"Hello!I have a Garmin Colorado 300 that I picked up about 3 years ago ($250.00) and spent $79.00 for the Lac Seul specific lake map from Trakmaps.com. What you will most likely find is that if you want a good lake map you will end up buying a separate detailed map. Most of the mapping that is included (built in base mapping) with the GPS unit is not detailed enough on the lakes. You will get very jagged shore lines, usually no hazards or even navigational aids. If you don't have a portable fishfinder to use in the rental boat there are plenty of combo Fishfinder/GPS units. You will still most likely have to get either a canadian map with Lac Seul or a seperate Lac Seul Map. If you go this route I would recommeng a combo unit with an internal GPS antenna so that you do not have to run a separate GPS antenna in the boat. Typically the Eagle/Lowrance are compatible with Navionics Maps and Garmin has their own maps for their units and Trakmaps.com works with Garmin. I personally prefer a separate fishfinder from the handheld GPS as I do a lot of hiking, hunting, dirtbiking so being able to put my handheld GPS in my pocket or in a backpack is a snap. Would be happy to send you some screen shots of the Trakmaps Lac Seul Map if you are interested."
