When I come back into the US, I hide my guns, knives and throwing stars inside my cheap Canadian prescription drug bag or my crate of south american oranges."

1300359,Fish_Heads,2011-04-28 09:20:00,154,We quit packing hand guns on our trips after we got our new suburban. All the power you need for protection & towing that heavy walleye boat all in one ! Plus it also cuts firewood for us as well. Too bad the color choices are somewhat limited.Follow the link:New suburban tow rig !
1300482,Guest,2011-04-28 15:06:00,0,Hard to hit skeeters with a hand gun
1300505,Jack77,2011-04-28 16:20:00,168,Not Canadian Skeeters.

1300786,captaincanada56,2011-04-29 10:40:00,17,they are our airforce
1300798,wallydave,2011-04-29 11:51:00,2151,Is that what they mean by friendly fire? Come on man where is the love?!
1301240,Dacotah Eye,2011-04-30 17:03:00,2722,The ND state bird got loose and migrated north.
1300023,Iowa Farm Boy,2011-04-27 14:29:00,44,Where is the best place to hide you hand guns when crossing the border? My thought is to keep it on my person so they don't find it if they search the truck or boat. My partner thinks he will just keep it in the console as it is easier to access if the Border patrol gives us any trouble.Your thoughts.
1300026,ranger22,2011-04-27 14:36:00,124,You should be banned from Walleyecentral.
1300028,Walleye_Wrangler,2011-04-27 14:39:00,138,I think you need to lighten up. Pretty obvious it was a joke.
1300039,polaris-pete,2011-04-27 15:20:00,343,"I could tell you a "" really good place "" to conceal it and then you gotta hope it doesn't go off accidentally!"
1300076,tackleman,2011-04-27 17:05:00,444,try your sock drawer at home.
1300082,bigwalleye1,2011-04-27 17:26:00,2632,"When are you going? There's a stop sign on 71 at the T south of I-Falls. Post here, tell me when you're going, and put your guns in a plastic bag and leave them at the base of the stop sign. I'll pick 'em up and hold 'em for you til you get back. Post here when you're back, and I'll put them by the stop sign again. Knucklehead."

1300094,Jahloaf,2011-04-27 18:03:00,74,"Iowa Farm Boy, you really caught them, I wonder if you can catch walleye as well as you can troll these people . LOL"
1300103,Iowa Farm Boy,2011-04-27 18:33:00,44,Wow! Just trying to have a little fun here. Didn't think people would take it serious and go on the attack. I think the messed up weather must have people on the edge.
1300121,rsako,2011-04-27 19:03:00,159,"it doesn't matter where you hide your handgun in the car or truck, because as soon as you cross the border you must use the borders' long term parking for your vehicle. That's because cars and trucks are not allowed in Canada...not since NAFTA accords were signed way back in Camp David! Where have you been boy? Geez...But, you can rent dog sleds from Hertz or National Rent a Car at the Canuck border to get around while you are up here. Accommodations is another story by god! sure hope you bring an ice/snow knife (which is legal) to build your own igloo. They are pretty ""cool"" actually. And you know that the Canuck dollar is actually a few percentage points higher than the US green back these days eh! well...here's another tip...Save your money...don't dare use the corrupt ""Duty Free my A**"" shops at the border. Just buy your REAL Canadian Whiskey at the first Hudson's Bay trading company you happen to come by...save yourself a bunch of dough! That said...any US made ""Bourbon"" will land ya in crowbar (pun intended) Hotel faster than trying to ""import"" a handgun or a long gun! But it's worth a bundle on the 'grey market' up here my boy! so if you're thinkin' of...ur'...concealin' anything in body cavities...you should consider crammin' a few ceramic jugs of the good stuff in there instead. Oh...darn near forgot. We have something democratic happening up here next Monday. It's called an Election. Not sure if you have 'dem down south. Anyways...if'n you care, we have a ""party"" runnin' fer election up yonder...and if'n they git 'lected, dey said dey wood wan us all to fetch hour own food and stuff (must be a taxasion thingy)...and dey would cancel da 'longgun' registry...YEAH Kool eh! Dat' might even change da fishin' regs up yonder here. so uh...yeah eh!...be sure and read the regs..if'n the new govnmint changs dem next week. hope dat hepls...I need another doubl shot O' dat burbin'...I mean Canadian Whiski..."
