6254878,Overwatchmike,2018-10-21 11:32:00,201,Size and #'s of fish? May or the opener depending on where you go. Find the spawning areas and its game on. Size only? Late fall... October / November.... fish are putting on the feed bags....Sent from my SM-G955U using Tapatalk
6255066,BornToFish,2018-10-22 07:53:00,1224,"Greetings, The original post sets forth interesting questions. When is the best time of the season for numbers of walleye? Similarly, when is the best time of the season for size of walleyes? I've come to view these questions as being somewhat irrelevant. To me, the two questions become one of selecting a body of water to fish that has the numbers and size of walleyes that I want to target. A lake with insufficient numbers of walleyes will never offer the number of walleyes that I want to catch per day. Similarly, a lake without the size of walleyes that I want to catch will never offer the size of walleyes that I want to catch. However, selecting a body of water with the numbers and size of walleyes that I want to catch will give me the opportunity to consistently catch such fish as the fish are in that body of water! These fish will on average be eating every day. It's up to me as the angler to find the location of the fish on any given day/time, and use an appropriate technique to approach these fish. I believe that most anglers have their preferred fishing techniques and techniques that they do not like to use. For example, some anglers enjoy trolling and dislike vertical jigging, whereas other anglers might enjoy vertical jigging and dislike rigging. There is another phenomenon with many anglers - temperament. Some anglers would go crazy vertical jigging for hours in an area of the lake the size of an ordinary household kitchen, as they need to be constantly moving. Other anglers might be uncomfortable constantly moving from spot to spot while casting crankbaits to shorelines. So, any response to the questions in the original post may or may not be relevant to any one angler depending upon the individual preferences (preferred techniques and temperament) of that angler. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6255174,Mojo-NC,2018-10-22 14:29:00,1929,"Like BornToFish already said, you first have to be on a lake that can provide both size and numbers. Once you have that combination, you just have to find them and know how to best catch them. We generally go up Week #3 of the walleye season, but the fishing still varies a lot from year-to-year based on the water levels and the weather. One year we fished the opener and the fish were still pre-spawn. Other years when the fish spawned back in April, they were already several weeks to a month post-spawn by the opener. The amount of time between when the fish spawn and the time when you arrive to fish is an important factor. If it was a cold spring the fish will generally be shallower. If it has been a warm spring, the fish will most likely be deeper. Finding the fish and figuring out the pattern can put one boat on both size and numbers while other boats struggle. Mastering the techniques and knowing when to use one over another is also a key factor. Some guys like trolling, while others like jigging, or casting. I personally like to mix it up and let the fish tell me which method to use. The one who figures it out and makes the right choices will likely catch the most fish and biggest fish. Then there's also the luck factor - being in the right place at the right time. When you figure that one out, please let me know."
6255230,The tank,2018-10-22 19:17:00,340,"Ive fished most weeks from opening week till mid september in the last 35 years. I say the best is up to you what type of weather do like to fish. 11 of 16 of the over 28"" walleyes ive caught have been late july-mid august. The other 5 was caught opening week. I go mostly july- mid august because thats when most of us can go. I dont like fishing when its hot but sometime you dont have an option. I say weather paterns have more efect on fishing than anything. The only real bad walleye fishing ive had was both times i went 3rd week in september. Both weeks the weather was colder than normal and windy every day."
6255254,cclawman,2018-10-22 21:32:00,351,"Without question the best time for big fish is mid-Feb through March, prespawn.Numbers is about the same time but a couple more weeks on each end.There is no longer a limit on size or numbers on the Columbia so 50 fish days for two guys in February is not unheard of."
6257590,IMT00FIERCE,2018-11-02 14:42:00,8,All depends on what you are looking for. A lot of people still believe the spring is the best fishing time. I have found this to be false after the advent of depth finders. Its pretty nuts what can happen out on a big reef in August.
