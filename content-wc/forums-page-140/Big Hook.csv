6254238,Jig Man,2018-10-18 11:09:00,95,Based on a Resorts for Sale web site it looks like Big Hook Outposts has changed ownership. Can anyone confirm this or know anything about the new owners?

They had cabins on some really great lakes, but our group never clicked with the owner (to put it as nicely as I can) and after a few trips with him we decided to move on and find another outfitter. Id be very interested in returning if it has been sold or changed owners in some other way."
