6601692,bthomas3333,2021-10-05 20:09:00,465,I'm hearing Elk Island Lodge sold Edmund Lake outpost and Kistigan outpost. Super super disappointed. I have always wanted to fish Edmund and now I am hearing it will become a hunting only camp. Another side effect of the COVID situation lodges selling assets for cash... Brett
