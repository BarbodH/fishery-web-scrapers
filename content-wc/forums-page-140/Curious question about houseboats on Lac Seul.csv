3623882,Pooch,2015-03-07 11:51:00,4618,Sometimes Lac Seul or other big water lakes can really get whipped up by wind with some serious rough water. What happens to you folks who have a houseboat rented either moored or traveling when this happens?Just something I was pondering.Pooch
3623922,jimirjr,2015-03-07 11:58:00,1149,"Well, It's tough to ""rough up"" a 20 ton HB... even on very rough seas.. As for being moored.. (parked)... We usually try to locate a sheltered cove of some sort... Of course, You have to secure the mooring ropes well..."
3623954,SinOrSwim,2015-03-07 12:12:00,1528,"I have owned a few different houseboats over the years. I have seen Lac Seul with some pretty rough water and I can tell you I would not want to be on the water with one of those. Only options you really have are to go directly into the wind. Especially iwth a pontoon style. Sideways would not be an option. Had one very scary trip back to the marina many years ago. Granted, that boat was only 43ft long but yikes."
3626449,pjshorthorn,2015-03-08 08:58:00,5654,"I spent 10 years using HBs on the NE section of Lac Seul out of Hudson,ON. We always enjoyed our trips as it was a relaxing way to see the lake and scenery while getting to ""home base"" for the week - wherever that ended up. We never said "" X"" marks the spot, but did try to have general areas in mind that kept us within easy reach of our desired fishing areas and would be well protected in the event of a big blow. In many cases, you would be competing for great spots so you had to have a game plan on where else you could tie up for the week. We had plenty of weather over the years,but only one trip where we took a beating for a day and a half while tied up ( unfishable ). That year we wanted to be in the general area of previous trips, but a forest fire had come through the year before due to a lightning strike. Much of the vegetation and trees where gone so tieing up was going to be a challenge.The outfitter pointed out a spot on the map and said it was protected from all kinds of storms except for one coming out of the SE....."" and that never happens"". Yeah well, it happened and 3 footers were beaking over the stern of the HB for the better part of a day. Talk about pucker time...... We actually went out and cut the canopy off of the two trees that the stern ropes were tied off to for fear that the wind was ging to uproot the trees. They were a ""swayin"" for sure. Since we were taking it right up the stern,we replaced the front two ropes using our back up anchor rope and moved the front HB ropes to the stern to double up the back two ropes so we were tied off at 4 points from the stern. The worst thing you want to have happen is for a stern rope to come loose and then swing you sideways onto shore. We made it through the storm and made the best out of the rest of the trip. Never moved the HB after that event.What happens when you are navigating......??? We have always pushed ahead in moderate seas < 2ft if we weren't catching heck from the side where we would be pushed off course too much. We never had to find a bay to hide and wait it out,but that would be advisable if you get into the larger seas. Trying to control a 75' floating ""sail"" is not easy as it takes a bit to get the HB to turn quickly if you get in a bad spot ( upcoming reef or hazard). One year we were heading back down the lake at the end of the trip on a high sky day ( cirrus clouds only) and we had been tied up in a proteted area so we really weren't aware that a pretty good blow was taking place out on the big water. As we came out of Kekabeka Narrows heading towards Bear Narrows, I could see that the seas were pretty stirred up at Bear Narrows. Mind you, this is 45-50 miles from base camp and radio coverage can be spotty on a day like this in order to get an idea on the weather...not to mention they can't see what is going on 50 miles away from base camp. The best bet is raising another HB that may be moving in the same general area to see what they are experiencing. As we approached those narrows, it became clear we would take a beating when we made the left turn to head south down the lake. I told the fellas to get everything secured that they could. As we started to come out of Bear Narrows I said "" hold on boys"" and tried to stay focused on the long reef to our left to make sure we weren't being pushed that way by the wind. Well, what I didn't anticipate was the height of the waves and the period between them. When we made our hard turn around the buoy ( waited longer than normal ), open came the cabinets above the countertops and emptied everything including the fine china After we got through there, the good news was that we had following seas the remainder of the trip and we didn't lose any of the 3 boats we were pulling behind us.The outfitter was very understanding about the broken dishes and even said "" this isn't the first time that has happened""........It was interesting on those two occasions, but I would do it again in a heartbeat. The outfitters offer a guide to move the HB up and down the lake at a reasonable price so that is always a great option if you don't want to worry about the responsibility. You can also enojy your favorite beverage during the trip without a worry about the OPP or Ministry checking you out along the way. I have never seen that happen, but have heard that they have been pushing the checks over the last few years on HBs while in transit.Last piece of advice, never,never, never let anyone untie the ropes until you are absolutely sure the engine has warmed up for at least 5 minutes regardless if it is a calm day or not......She is a big sail waitng to catch any breeze. If she isn't warmed up it is a sure bet it will stall when you try and push off the shore in reverse. Once the engine is good and warm, untie and collect the ropes on board as you push away from shore.Take care,PjShorthorn"
3628769,rnnonmt,2015-03-08 21:30:00,992,"I have plenty of driving time with the houseboats. Mostly 65 footers. Although driving them can be compared to herding turtles, big wind and waves don't do much to the driveability. What IS dangerous is poor visibility caused by heavy rain with wind. Other than that they just keep plowing. I have had the cabinets empty out and crashing of dishes too. Worst year I can remember was at the end of one of our trips. Heavy rain and big winds. The water level was so low that year we had to load and unload our gear from the roof of the house boat. We were coming back into Hudson. We called for a guide to pick us up at Lost Island lodge because I didn't want to try to dock the boat it was so bad out. We got no response on the radio. After trying to call numerous times I took it in to the docks. Literally.... Wind blew us side ways into the dock and the corner of the dock (with the water level so low) came right through the side of the houseboat. Another year we had a fresh rebuilt engine on the houseboat. That was back when they were still putting small blocks 350's in them.... not the crappy V6's they have now. We were cruising back at a whopping 9 mph when the engine shut down on its own. Yes this was during a decent storm too. Tried to start it up and got about one crank out of it and that was it. All of the guys in our fishing group are mechanics. After checking the obvious we noticed a screw missing from the carb butterfly. Uh-oh. The third spark plug we pulled had water in the cylinder. We got to stay an extra day ""on the house"" while one of the owners techs swapped out another small block for us. Pretty impressive. I think we were around Banana/ Taylor Island area."
3628825,rnnonmt,2015-03-08 21:54:00,992,I forgot to answer the mooring question. The rear mooring lines are the most important. Take them out as wide as you can securely tie them. If you are on Lac Seul in the spring while the water is rising you may have to re-tie them off a couple times in a week to take up the slack from the rising water. Obviously try to park the houseboat in a sandy cove with shelter from the wind.
3629737,sloughboy,2015-03-09 08:19:00,13,"Good post Pooch, this post has finally answered some questions I have always had about renting a houseboat. Sticking with outposts and lodges."
3629745,SinOrSwim,2015-03-09 08:20:00,1528,"Absolutely. It is a huge test in patience sometimes too. Especially around the dock. If you correct something, it is hard to NOT have an immediate response. So, you over do it. More power. THe problem is then you over correct and to get that back you have to over correct again. We were out on mine last summer. I was letting my father in law drive. I kept telling him to not over steer because it takes awhile for what he does with the wheel to actually happen on the water. We were heading toward a bridge. Now, the space between the pillars was HUGE. But, I had to jump in and take over because he was over steering and by the time he figure it out we were moving way too far in that direction. I think he would have literally run into the bridge if I let him keep going. LOL One nice thing with twin motors. I steer with my throttles vs the wheel."
3630706,pjshorthorn,2015-03-09 12:17:00,5654,Yes. How else would I have been invited to take that many HB trips on Lac Seul to chronical the TRUE adventures that I've posted ???? PjShorthorn
3631986,rnnonmt,2015-03-09 18:03:00,992,"I totally agree about the over steer and the tendency to chase it. I do all the houseboat driving. Ive gotten used to it over the years and know to be patient and let the boat respond. It gets quite boring driving it so I would typically ask for some one to take over from time to time for 15 minutes or so I could walk around a bit. I would come back and look at the GPS screen on my laptop and see the very evident zig zag weave from the inexperienced drivers. lol. We would go all the way to Wapesi, Birch or another area way up north. That is about 7 hrs in a straight line or 9 if you zig zag the whole way. Houseboats don't have an ""Economy button"" to save on gas either. lol Its full throttle the whole way at about 7-9 mph."
6259640,fishmanric,2018-11-12 04:37:00,219,We had two to three footers coming back to dock this year and the only thing I noticed was the extra time it took. About 45 minutes longer. We also had strong winds two days during the trip and had to adjust the mooring ropes to compensate. All part of the intrigue of houseboating.
6259642,tv4fish,2018-11-12 05:11:00,2694,"IMHO - You are ""missing out"" on a great experience. Obviously it depends on what is more important to you - actual ""fishing time"" or ""boating time"".For many years we would boat from Deception Bay up to our favorite fishing spots - my boat will cruise at about 40 mph - it still took 35 minutes to get to our spots. We would leave about 8:00 a.m. and we would spend the entire day in the boat and then head back around 3:30 to allow time for a few drinks, cleaning fish and then eating and then dishes back at the cabin.If we had any bad weather coming in (which seemed to happen a lot) - THAT could/would cut short the fishing - the boating time still remained the same up/back for that day.We had gone the ""outpost cabin"" bit also a number of times - we just seem to prefer a bit more privacy and don't appreciate ""noisy neighbors"" at a camp.Granted - a houseboat rental HAD been on our bucket list for a few years. 2 years ago, we went that route and that WILL remain our plan for as long as we will be able to head up to Lac Seul.It has proven to be much more relaxing to have ""home base"" so close to our fishing spots. It allows for much more flexibility.Yeah, it's a bit more expensive than our old routine, but we will never go back."
6260298,WALI4VR,2018-11-14 17:00:00,68,"Holy smokes! 8 mph x 7hr.= ~60ml. How many gallons of fuel do the HB hold and how many gph do they burn? Curiously, do they run a closed or open cooling system on those motors??'98 Merc why still carburetored?"
3629153,pjshorthorn,2015-03-09 05:28:00,5654,"Another year we had a fresh rebuilt engine on the houseboat. That was back when they were still putting small blocks 350's in them.... not the crappy V6's they have now. Yup, had that happen to us as well on the way up the lake. Pushed the HB to shore with our fishing boats and waited for the outfitter to push us up the lake with his big guide boat. They dropped a new motor in the next morning while we were out fishing. Unfortunately, they forgot to tighten the steering linkage and it came off halfway back down the lake. The old motor was left on the rear deck so we scavenged parts off of it to make it back to the dock. Alway an adventure!!!! PjShorthorn"
3629209,pjshorthorn,2015-03-09 05:50:00,5654,"Check that........now that I thought about it more, it was the throttle cable that came loose at the motor. PjShorthorn."
3629305,SinOrSwim,2015-03-09 06:36:00,1528,"Are you really Brian Williams??????? There is not much more disconcerting when you are on teh water and an engine fails. Especially with a single motor. My current boat now has twin V-8s. I have only had to dock it with one motor once. Even though there is still power, it is really hard. I can't imagine being on the boat and the feeling you all must have had when the dock came through the side of the boat??? yowza. They are just a big sail. They just don't have a deep draft. So, nothing below the water line keeping them on course. Get sideways and it's over."
3629673,rnnonmt,2015-03-09 08:08:00,992,"Yes lots of ""adventures"" out there over the years!!!! The moment you reduce power on a house boat you might as well throw away the steering wheel because its not worth a ----->"
