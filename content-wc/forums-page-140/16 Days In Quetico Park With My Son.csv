6257598,Walleye2242,2018-11-02 15:23:00,263,Mike....want to thank you for always sharing your stories and adventures. I really enjoy your videos. I love watching them as it takes into Canada and love i have for fishing in Canada. Been going since i was 7 with dad and gramps but they have passed on. didnt miss a trip in about 25 years but have missed the last 4 years to do living very far away and coaching. Recently moved back to Wiscosnin so I am going next year even if i have to go alone. Watching your videos puts me into Canada and i just love watching them. Thank you for sharing kind Sir.

Needless to say things have been pretty chaotic for some time now and I'm just now getting caught up on my writing and editing.Back in July I spent 16 days paddling and fishing Quetico Park with my 11 year old son Brendan. It was an incredible experience.In my younger years I spent many months paddling the park solo and for me this was a return to my roots.Introducing my son to the park and revisiting many of my old haunts with him at my side was a pretty special experience.I recently pieced together an hour long video chronicling the experience, have a look. https://youtu.be/sWQgXksDOYU?t=1"
6256248,pjshorthorn,2018-10-27 07:28:00,5654,"Nicely done . I know how difficult it was going to be for you to get ready for this trip just after getting back from Athabasca, but it looks like you guys had a fabulous trip. I wish I could turn back the clock to when my son was 11 and spend 16 straight days with him off the grid like you were able to. I'm glad to see you were able to invest in Brendan in such a meaningful way....there isn't anything better than being able to do so with our kids. On an even brighter note, you actually meant to paddle for hours on end and didn't have to worry about running out of gas this trip. PjShorthorn"
6256260,Mike Borger,2018-10-27 07:47:00,1554,Thanks Pat LOL!I finally sent you the Athabasca pic's as well.
