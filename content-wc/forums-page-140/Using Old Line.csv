Also, what do you consider ""old"" for line that has never been spooled and used on a reel? I have several spools of ""new"" line that are about 2-3 years old. Are most of you tossing that out and buying new? Lately, I seem to be having a lot of issues with line that just seems stiff and difficult to use."
6255282,Bill Krejca,2018-10-23 06:55:00,6107,"It depends. Braid seems to last forever, discounting color change to white. Deterioration seems nil, although some brands may tend to fray due usage,just cut it off. Mono can last many years if kept out of the heat/sun. If it breaks easily, it is time to change. Also, most mono may indicate it's age by becoming more stiff. Bill"
6255284,tv4fish,2018-10-23 06:57:00,2694,"I think the ""quality"" of older line depends somewhat on how it is stored -- I have used line older than 2-3 years without any ""apparent"" issues. At the start of each year - I check out the line for memory twist and easy breaking - if either issue occurs - it gets replaced."
6255290,Jwendt15,2018-10-23 07:19:00,72,"Should have mentioned that this is primarily mono that I am dealing with. In the past, I have stored everything in our garage which I am sure is not ideal with our Michigan winters."
6255294,BornToFish,2018-10-23 07:41:00,1224,"Greetings,I fish in NW Ontario several times each season, for one to two weeks at a time. I always strip monofilament line from my spools shortly after I return home and have them re-spooled prior to my next trip. I probably could re-use the line on a future trip, but it's simply not worth the chance to me. The reels see plenty of sun while in the boat. The line gets stretched on snags and fish. Taking the chance on having bad fishing line on the spool just isn't worth the risk to me, given that it costs about $2-3 dollars to have the line replaced.I have other reels that I use when fishing on local area lakes. These reels might be used a few hours each week. I replace the monofilament line on these reels at the end of the season.I store my reels in my basement, so the temperature is fairly steady throughout the year. I have used line that is 1-3 years on the spool with no apparent problems.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6255298,CI_Guy,2018-10-23 08:16:00,2118,"From what I've always been told heat and sunlight, not cold, are the enemies of mono. Storing in a cool dark place is supposed to be best. I'm sure the wide temp swing in your garage are not good for the line. I know my garage is sometimes over 100 degrees in the summer and sub zero occasionally in the winter."
6255300,camp chef,2018-10-23 08:18:00,915,We use Bagelys Silver thread excalibur. It is a copolymer. We buy it in bulk spools and have no problem using it for several years in a row with no sign of deterioration. In fact the bulk spool we refill from is over 5 years old. Never had an issue. It is still as strong as ever.
6257476,Scratcher,2018-11-02 08:10:00,170,"I think it really depends on the line and then the storage. I had an ultralight rod break in May in Canada. Picked up an ultralight and bought some Gamma 6# line up there. The line was great, very limp off the spool. Rod sat in the garage most of the summer and this week used it and it was was curly, memory coming off the spool made it almost unusable. The other rod i was using had Trilene XL 6#, was re-spooled last spring, stored the same over summer, and it was still great. I had bought two spools of the Gamma, used one in the spring and the other spent the summer in the basement. I took the Gamma spool from the basement and re-spooled the reel. That line is as good as it was in the spring. Seems some brands can handle the varied storage better than others. I do re-spool mono every wither and if I have line in the basement I use that before getting new and had never had an issue."
6257596,last chance,2018-11-02 15:06:00,3262,I have a bulk spool of 17# ande that i've had for over 10 yrs and its still good. but I store in in the closet where it stays about the same temp and gets very little light. and thats from a light bulb. but I use it mostly for backing on my trolling reels. but I test it when I use it and it still to strong for me to break it with my bare hands.
