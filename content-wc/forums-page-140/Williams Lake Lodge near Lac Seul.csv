Also would like any info about the road from Dryden to their camp. Would a minivan make it or is higher wheel base needed? Thanks in advance for any info. Did do a search but did not see any reports after about 2015."
6254908,cpk,2018-10-21 14:32:00,27,"Hey bode,Just now seeing this as I just registered today. I've been to WLL Outpost a few times in the past 3 years. In years past the road from Dryden only went as far as a boat launch, where you'd meet someone there and transport all your gear from there to the outpost. This year was the first time the road went directly to the Lodge. A minivan would do just fine on it and is actually what we used one year.The cabin itself is no frills, but it's an outpost so what do you expect, right? It sleeps 8, all bunk beds. They say they require a minimum of 4 (I think) to rent it but we've been up with 2 or 3. The stove and fridge run on propane and the electricity (lights) run on a gas generator. The main lodge changed to solar power a couple years ago and there's been talk about doing the same at the outpost but that hasn't happened yet. You'll see field mice running around the cabin from time to time so protecting your food is still necessary. The location of the cabin is perfect if you want solitude. It's up on a hill and on a point and you're the only cabin there so you feel like you're on your own. You still have access to showers, ice, etc, and at the main lodge which is only a 7 minute boat ride away from the outpost. There's a nice drop-off from the dock so lighted slip bobbers at night can land some decent pike and walleyes while you sip some beers. We primarily fish Lac Seul, about a 20 mile radius from Kleiner Point and have always done well. Getting there is the hard part as it requires a 25 minute ride each day. Getting through the winding channel that connects Williams Lake and Lac Seul is easy and well marked with buoys. There is a risk of the water level being so low that you can't get to Lac Seul through the channel, locking you in to only fishing Williams Lake, but that's only happened once in the 20 years that Ken and Kathy have owned the place. Even this year with the water level being down a couple feet, getting through the channel was do-able. We have always upgraded our boat to the Crestliner Kodiak with 50hp and it's been fine. This year they added a 60hp motor with aTerrova trolling motor and Humminbird Helix 7 for an upgrade. However, it's not an option for the outpost since charging it requires electrical current not available at the outpost.Ken and Kathy are good about taking care of whatever it is you need. One year, the boat wasn't planing well with 3 of us and Ken changed the prop blades on it pretty quickly. Another year the graph we were using capped out and Ken took care of it. Another time the motor we were using just completely died and Ken got us changed to another rig pretty quickly. What I'm saying is that things have usually gone pretty well overall but when it hasn't, they've responded pretty quickly and have plenty of equipment to take care of you. For the price it's hard to beat the Outpost. Again, no frills and no luxury but that's not what people usually look for in an outpost. Let me know if there's anything else you want to know."
6255136,bode,2018-10-22 12:36:00,39,Thanks for your reply. Was beginning to think nobody was using this outfitter. Sounds like the type of place our group likes. We are a no frill type of group. Have always done outposts except early on when we stayed in tents at 68 those days are long gone. We will probably give WLL a try as we are looking for a new place after 16 years at the same camp. Thanks again cpk.
6255196,cpk,2018-10-22 15:38:00,27,"Yep, did the tent thing for a few years too. After a week one year where night temps were in the 30s and many more weeks of sore hips and backs after the trip, we went the outpost route. Going from tents to an outpost is luxury! Good luck bode!"
6255214,new hips,2018-10-22 17:59:00,498,when we were there the outpost was on a island????
6255260,cpk,2018-10-22 22:34:00,27,Not quite an island but sits on a point/short peninsula that makes it look like an island. You can only get to it by boat but it isn't quite totally surrounded by water to be an island.
6256724,bode,2018-10-29 15:54:00,39,cpk Was wondering if the fishing around Kleiners Point was mainly for walleye or northern as we usually target eyes especially near humps. We typically go a little later about the first of August and fishing 20 to 30 feet deep. Thanks.
6256753,cpk,2018-10-29 18:11:00,27,"bode,We've usually gone around the third week in September and have done really well with 1/4 oz. chartreuse/red hook jigs with medium minnows in the depth range you just listed. Every once in a while we'll find them in thermoclines but 95%of the time they're hugging the bottom in those depth ranges. We fish walleyes almost exclusively around that area. The last couple years, however, have been...interesting. I don't know if water temps are affecting patterns or what, but our usual techniques haven't worked as well the past couple years. We've had to work for them more so than in the past. Don't get me wrong, it's still the best walleye fishing I've experienced anywhere overall, but it's been less Lac Seul-like lately. I don't know if it's the beginning of a longer trend or just a fluke. My goal this off season is to try to figure it out with data and through the experience of others who ave been fishing it lately. It's the big reason I registered here.On occasions where we fished northerns, we've found them during that time of year a bit shallower and in inlets or bays where the water is still warm, using spoons and big spinners. We've still gotten our share of northerns while fishing for walleyes but the bigger ones we found were in shallow, warmer water."
6257220,MikeMcC,2018-11-01 08:57:00,72,"Hey cpk, sounds like you are interested in data and angler experiences. For the south cental basin of Lac Seul studying the SWWL reports is about as good as it gets.https://www.sww-lodge.com/category/fishing-report/"
6257554,cpk,2018-11-02 11:18:00,27,Nice! Thanks brother!
