If I go to Canada 1x per year (which I do - but I do fish a few tournaments outside of that, so maybe 14 days total all year), I'd rather spend the $500 and be warm, dry and comfortable. I used to use the old Columbia gear and Frog Toggs, and they just sucked. It was a miserable week long trip. Always wet, body not breathing, never drying out. It's worth the upfront cost, AND, they'll essentially last forever."
6257996,bushead11,2018-11-04 21:36:00,151,In the market for some new rain gear. I really only wear then as a wind blocker and rain jacket for the week I go to Canada each year. I don't want to break the bank but these looked like a pretty good deal and I checked them out in store as well. Jacket https://www.ganderoutdoors.com/product/details?i=261436 Bibs https://www.ganderoutdoors.com/product/details?i=261437 Just wondering if anyone has any experience with these or if there is a similar lifetime warranty like Cabela's Guidewear. Appreciate any insight.
6258044,GBS,2018-11-05 07:21:00,2271,"Highly unlikely for something that only costs $60. No mention on their web site of any kind of warranty - par for the course for Camping World, so would expect it to be the same here. You have 90 days to return UNUSED items, with all tags, etc. attached."
6258064,wooglin,2018-11-05 08:31:00,371,"Best investment I've ever made for fishing was dropping the money on Cabela's Guidewear rain gear. Watch their sales, often-times 10% off and free shipping. If you open a card for the purchase, you get some more off. Well worth it....."
6258088,camp chef,2018-11-05 09:44:00,915,No match for the Guidewear. Do you self a favor and get Guidewear It is the last rain gear you will ever need to buy.
6258098,bushead11,2018-11-05 10:07:00,151,Are you guys talking about the $600 set of Gore-tex? I'm having a hard time justifying the spend. My Stearns Walleye Hunter jacket I bought at Fleet Farm for $50 has lasted about 10 years. Just started to leak a little on this last trip. Only when the water started to pool as I drove the tiller... If I fished at home in the rain a bunch I can see spending that money but for one week a year I'm not sure. I do see the amortization value of spending that money once and never buying another set but looking at $100 vs. $600 is tough with 3 kids and the fact my car needs new tires before winter...!
6258154,wooglin,2018-11-05 12:29:00,371,"Yep, it's the expensive stuff. HOWEVER, don't settle for paying retail. Watch for sales, clearance, end of year deals - and the 10% off plus free ship. It's worth it, trust me. Not only do you stay dry, but you stay warm, your body is able to breath and you have plenty of opportunities with pockets and the snug sleeves to keep water from running up your arm. it is pricey, but it's worth it. Watch clearance!!"
6258174,martinbns,2018-11-05 13:19:00,1520,"Find good stuff on sale, Guidewear is great. In my experience from hunting, fishing and golf, you get you pay for with outerwear."
6258198,phishfearme,2018-11-05 14:22:00,1242,"for fishing in the northland, you cannot spend too much for raingear. I would not be afraid of breaking the bank in this area - great rain gear is ALWAYS re saleable. in addition to the Cabela's stuff, I think the next level up is bass pro's bone dry gear - check their website. and for me, the pants are more important than the jacket - or more precisely, the seams of the pants - and none is better than the bone dry stuff. a wet butt means you're heading back to the cabin. yes they are expensive - but drop hints for the holidays!! worked for me! phish"

Got them on sale for $70. I can not see paying $400.00 plus for a rain suiet that I would use so few times. These bibs have always kept me dry."
6258706,Mr. Sauger,2018-11-07 11:56:00,285,"Looks like they will do the job at a reasonable price. My only concern is the ""waterproof zipper"" on the jacket. Inspect it on arrival for final approval. I mostly use lighter raingear like this set instead of my Cabelas Guideware. Most days I bring rain gear on the boat (every day in Canada). The smaller/lighter sets fits in my boat bag. Guideware is heavier/larger and is one more item to bring on board and take up space. If it is warm I prefer the lighter stuff. Also - guideware is not 100% perfect. Water can pool in the crotch when sitting and wick through the seams. I do use it for nasty days - but would not spend $500+ for one summer week."
