Its construction through a frog pond precluded the use of the original portage at the NE end where the cabins now sit. I used to stay the the then camp, and have many memories of the great fishing before and after the canal was dug. Responsibility for maintenance (and perhaps liability) seems to be one reason that a simple cure for portaging has been so elusive. Bill"
6256314,Lake Of The Woods,2018-10-27 15:11:00,124,"Thanks for posting the link to the article as it brought back vivid memories as a young man.Back in 1986-87 while working for the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources in the Kenora area I was part of the crew constructing the lock system at Turtle Portage.Originally it was constructed with gates that would open and close by use of a manual capstan wheel and cable system.However,it was not as effective as anticipated in keeping the tainted water from Turtle Lake entering into the pristine waters of Whitefish Bay as well as the lock doors not working properly thus threatening the Lake Trout habitat and population.I also remember lead engineer in charge of the construction having his doubts on the effectiveness of the design. There were a few instances where changes had to be made in order for the gate to function as designed. Initially it took great effort to turn the capstan wheel that opened and closed the gates. Equipment would also break down out of the blue and on one occasion a form collapsed and one crew member suffered a fractured shin and two broken fingers. We also had to halt construction as during one phase we were unearthing artifacts and human bones from which was identified as an Ojibway Native settlement dating back 150 - 200 years as was determined by local anthropologists. I and others on the crew had also spent some nights alone on that site during weekends on a security rotation and there were some strange things that would occur every now and then. At times the hair on the back of your neck would stand on end,... it was if something was present that was unexplainable. Perhaps this has something to do with why this portage has always had difficulties in operating properly,... mysteries of the unexplained ,... Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha,..... ha. Lake Trout fishing in Whitefish Bay remains very good.I remember when we were living at the construction site at Turtle Portage during the initial construction.In the evenings we would fish Whitefish Bay for Lake Trout and without too much effort catch the allowed limit which supplied the crew with a fresh Lake Trout dinner on a daily basis if wanted."

There is a portage system from Longbow Lake to LOTW that is maintained by the Cottage owners of Longbow, but now has been taken over by Reddens Camp. I was talking to the owners there earlier this year and they had nothing good to say about having responsibility for it, basically that no one wanted to pay. If used by locals I wonder if it would be worthwhile for the Municipality of Sioux Narrows/Nestor Falls could take it over."
6257024,LOW1,2018-10-31 09:49:00,2828,"I don't know how much it is used by locals. It seems to me that locals are more likely to trailer their boat to either Nestor Falls or Sioux Narrows or whatever other access they want and put in there.And I assume that resorts don't consider it be a ""big draw"" for their customers but I could be wrong on that.The locals I have talked to seemed reluctant to plan a trip to use it because it may not be working when they get there. Perhaps it has always been more of an ""amusement ride"" or an ""adventure"" than a true transportation route?"
6257038,Hawker,2018-10-31 10:40:00,3967,"While up there in late May we didn't use it at all as we fished primarily Steven's Bay and Stony, but while there the last week of June and first week of July and again two weeks in the middle of August we used it almost every day. On some days (depending on what time of the morning we got there) we'd have to wait up to an hour or more as there would be anywhere from 3-8 (or more) boats from YWC and another camp or two portaging thru. It'd be a shame to shut it down completely (which I hope they don't), but until people quit trying to take boats across that are too big for it and quit breaking things because they do, I can understand the reasoning and logic for shutting it down."
6257100,jambi,2018-10-31 15:15:00,504,"Dang Steve; you may as well stay up there from May 20 to Aug 20 my friend! I seem to recall a couple sweet trips up there to Whitefish Bay with you on some of those ""warmer"" Late May years. Good memories with you guys and my Dad. I learned all about X-Raps in Whitefish Bay! Scott"
6257290,Obabikon,2018-11-01 11:49:00,2370,"Actually... the ""locals"" who use it are from Morson. So, it is not easy to trailer from Morson to Sioux."
6257392,martinbns,2018-11-01 19:54:00,1520,That's what I was thinking.
