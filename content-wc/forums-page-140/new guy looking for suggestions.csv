I am looking to get started in making my own Walleye rigs as it gets expensive losing so many over the course of the season. Could someone please recommend a Canadian supplier of walleye harness kits. Beads,clevises,hooks,blades one in one kit. thanks Waba"

6257722,BornToFish,2018-11-03 13:03:00,1224,"Greetings,I am aware of LureMaking.com as a supplier within Canada of lure making components:http://www.luremaking.com/catalogue/...components.htmI have not done business with this company, so I am not recommending it, just mentioning it. I have been very satisfied with Jann's Netcraft and LurePartsOnline in the US.I encourage you to do a search on Walleye Central on the topic of spinner rigs. Adam Dempsey has referenced on several occasions an article that he wrote about making spinner rigs. The only thing that Adam left out of his article is the kitchen sink. It's an article worth the effort to track down.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6257772,adempsey2.0,2018-11-03 22:06:00,611,"Kits will probably be just as much as pre-made, possibly even more, than just getting the components you need in bulk.Beads - order them from eBay, but they are coming from China and take a while to get so order them early as possible; or hit your local craft store. luremaking.com also has a good selection and beads are not that expensive.Line - get large spools of 20-25lb Trilene Big Game - it is good and inexpensiveBlades - order from luremaking.com. I have used them many times in the past. Otherwise, you can consider a large order from somewhere like https://www.worthco.com/ which is from the USA, but it might still be cheaper.Clevises - order from luremaking.com Just use the folded clevises. You do not need quick change.Hooks - Octopus from luremaking.com or captainhookswarehouse.com. Eagle Claw, VMC or Mustad will be just fine. The Matzuo or ok, I just do not like the bend as it causes them to break easier. Not a huge deal though really.https://fishingoutposts.com/how-to-t...inner-harness/Add some Slow Death type rigs into the mix as well. They work great and you only need a hook and a swivel."
6258294,gullrockguy,2018-11-05 19:47:00,44,"i made and sold spinner rigs for 15 years up here in the northwest and i would order in bulk from Hagens in Mitchell South Dakota toll free 1-800-541-4586 web site is www.hagensfish.com I also have dealt with luremaking.com they are in southern ontario and are great to deal with. especially if you only want smaller quantities. Ask Hagens to send you a catalog. you may need a business licence to get wholesale pricing from some distributors. good luck, its a great way to spend a winter night, tying next years trophy catchers."
6258912,Waba,2018-11-08 10:34:00,25,Thanks for the help guy's!Just put a order in with Luremaking.com . Looks like Ill be tying flies and making rigs all winter!Tight LinesWaba
6259020,BornToFish,2018-11-08 18:28:00,1224,"Greetings,Waba: I'm glad that it's coming together for you. You will find that the range of available materials is truly amazing. You will find the various combinations of materials and design are without end. You will come up with your own designs and then swap with your buddies for even more and designs. You might want to send a private message to Adempsey2.0 (see above) and ask him about his article for making spinner rigs. This article was an excellent foundation when I began making my own spinner rigs.I took a class to learn how to tie trout fishing flies several winters ago. I found that the techniques, materials and equipment allowed me to make hair jigs and some impressive pike and musky bucktails.Making spinner rigs for walleyes and tying flies/bucktails/jigs is a great way to spend a winter afternoon or evening. It's very rewarding to design and make a fishing lure and then use it to catch a nice fish!Good fishing and tight lines!!"
