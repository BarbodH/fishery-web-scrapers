6258918,Guest,2018-11-08 11:05:00,0,"I have been the English River just below Maynard Lake once a year for the past 15yrs. I can only assume the fishing above Maynard Falls is as good as it is below. While I cant provide an opinion on Maynard Lake Lodge, the fishing on the system itself is amazing for walleyes, smallies, northern and there are musky there (we mostly fish for walleye)"
6258924,Seanik,2018-11-08 11:14:00,218,"I have been going on fishing trips to Ontario and Quebec for 40+ years, fly ins, drive ins outpost, Housekeeping and American plans. The trip I went on in August of 2018 was absolutely the best ever. The Fishing was fantastic, the food was 5 Star with a salad bar and breakfast fruit bar. The boats were 16' mirrocraft with 20hp Yamaha motors, flat floors deptfinder and a dock boy to help you in or out + posts to help you get out of the boats. Shore lunch each day consisted of a tote with everything needed, the tote had oil, breading, potatoes, onions, bread, a jar of homemade pickles cookies and all necessary utensils for cooking. I am a disabled veteran with foot issues, I was supplied with a golf cart for my exclusive use to get around the lodge areas. Kaby Lodge a fly in out of White River, Ontario is absolutely the best Ever, I highly recommend them and have booked a week in July before I left last August. Kaby is usually booked solid by returning guests, but they may have a few openings. Seanik"

6258672,bthomas3333,2018-11-07 10:04:00,465,What is the budget? Length of stay? Location preference?B-
6258688,Hit-em,2018-11-07 11:00:00,6,"We're figuring something in neighborhood $1,500 to $2,000 for 4-5 days of fishing not real particular as far as location"
6258696,KSjim,2018-11-07 11:14:00,88,I believe Maynard Lake Lodge checks all your boxes. We have had several great trips to Maynard over the years. One of the highlights is their daily shore lunch. Great variety and everyone is welcome. It does not matter if you are fishing with a guide or not. Josh runs a first class operation and the fishing has never disappointed.
6258704,bthomas3333,2018-11-07 11:52:00,465,Hey - Well if you want all-inclusive you are asking for food service which takes out some of the very interesting outposts I have been studying. You also asked for fly in which limits some of the nice boat in / drive in locations.If you wanted to target big walleyes with lower numbers I would suggest Hawk Lake Lodge. It is a drive in. The SM bass fishing is very good for numbers and size. The boats / cabins / food are all FIRST class. I have fished here 5 times in the last 4 years.http://hawk-lake.comI have been studying Kesagami for a trip. It is very well know for BIG pike and very highly rated. Many guys travel here specifically for trophy pike but the walleye fishing is pretty insane for walleye numbers. Lots of 100+ fish days. Note the prices listed are in Canadian so you can do the conversion and see it fits into your USD budget.https://kesagami.comCheck out the websites. Check out Tripadvisor ratings.Brett
6258726,Hit-em,2018-11-07 12:29:00,6,"We fished Hawk Lake this past year & was very disappointed We were there for 4 days & caught a total of 7 fish a couple of decent walleyes, a small lake trout & a few hammerheads Went out with a guide one day my brother caught a small walleye & a couple of small pike ..I was blanked Most of the guys in camp looking for walleye were pretty disappointed one fella said he had one bite in 4 days of fishing There were some in camp that were getting into the smallmouths, but when we booked the trip we told them our main focus was walleyes We were told that it was a private lake & they had the only public access to the lake..not so there were a number of summer homes on the lake which kind of threw us. We asked about that & was told that the homes had private access & weren't considered public The lake itself is pretty small ..they had a number portages to other small lakes buy mainly for smallmouths The accommodations were very nice & the food was decent & the boats & equipment were excellent The weather was hot & I'm sure it affected the fishing but I don't think we'd ever go back, not what we were looking for .."

6258828,Guest,2018-11-07 21:04:00,0,Oh wow. 3 words. Hidden Bay Lodge. You can not go wrong. They run an outstanding operation. The Walleye and Northern fishing on Blackstone and Miniss is Amazing. Walleyes are fighter on Miniss
