6251764,onetimedave,2018-10-07 06:38:00,502,Info on your experience with the above outfitter. What lake(s) have you fished and would recommend?
6251940,HeHooksHimself,2018-10-08 07:03:00,725,"Hii Dave, we were at Tennant Lake in June through TLO. Chad and his crew really were interested in making sure we would have a great time. However, they do not fly their own planes, the are at the mercy of Nakina Air. Typically, I don't think there is much downside to this but it does require another communication link. In our case, we expanded our party from 4 to 6 and somehow this piece of information was not clear to Nakina Air and our flight was delayed and we were split between two planes. Nothing earth-shattering with this, but it was rather confusing. Another thing that happened was the cabin slipped off its foundation on day 2. Chad was quick to come out the next day and spend a day with a coworker jacking it back up and securing it while we were fishing. Again, not a great dilemma but it did happen. As far as Tennant Lake goes, there are a few pockets of walleye there and some +30"" pike, but we did most of our fishing in the river and as it empties into Kat Lake. The river is full of rocks and swift current and if the water is low you cannot help but hit a few. One thing about TLO is you cannot beat their prices. They were 100's of dollars cheaper per person than most others. Fish On! Hooks"

I can easily say 100% both are top notch operations. TLO under Chad will do ANYTHING and EVERYTHING to make your groups trip safe and enjoyable and successful. Nakina Air run by and owned by Greg might be the safest and best run airline up there. Once you get to know him and how he operates you will ALWAYS feel safe. He and Chad have a fantastic relationship when working together. I obviously have no idea what happened in regards to a communicatiion breakdown with your grp switch from 4 to 6. But as you know these early weeks of June are busy as **** and prime time for Chad and Greg and on a saturday morning at 530am its crazy down at the dock....but Greg and his crew run a tight ship. Our group was there when Chad was heading into your Tenant camp to repair the damage. All our guys said to him was we were not surprised at him doing this. IMO there arent many outfitters that would drop everything to go in and do what he did. I know 2yrs ago i wrote a post in regards to an emergency health issue our group had at Abamasagi, so i wont bore with those details. BUT, the important part is how Chad and Greg dropped everything on tht Fri morning and brought a plane into our camp(Greg himself) and had our member and whole group out as fast as possible. We were impressed!!!!! Its those moments you know you are always in good hands with great people."
6255316,HeHooksHimself,2018-10-23 09:28:00,725,"Hi Matt, I agree and tried to portray the fact that Chad was quick to solve the issues we encountered. He is a great guy and a great operation and a very good deal. I should have mentioned that I would recommend him. I was a little disappointed with Tennant Lake as I said, but I would not hesitate to use TLO in the future. Hooks"
6255474,gmattbruin,2018-10-24 06:59:00,174,"Hey, no worries. Our group has never fished Tenant. We have fished Hebner(many yrs ago), Washi, Esser, maybe another too. Than we went into Abamasagi 1 yr....abt 12yrs ago or so and have only fished Abamasagi since. Its close to Cordingley, so a 25min or so flight into the lake. We LOVE it there. Being close to base paid off the yr my dad got injured. We have 3 guys over 70yrs old so we all feel comfortable there. We have gotten to know the lake like the back of our hand. Each yr fishing is different than the previous so always something new to learn. BUT, this lake is a walleye factory as many of us who have fished it can attest to. Never monster sizes in either walleye or pike. Although there have been MANY 35-39"" pike caught and i can vouch for 2 well over 40"" lost at the side of the boat. Its our go to lake each June and will remain the same for a long time to come. Good luck next spring Hookhimself and hope you are with Chad again!!"
6255478,gmattbruin,2018-10-24 07:04:00,174,"Also...Onetime....if you have any questions at all about TLO or Abamasagi or Nakina Air....PM me and ill offer up any help to you i can. NOTE: There is 1 other outfit operation on tht lake as well. Our group had to use this operation 1 yr as mixup on our part caused us to be out of a cabin for Abamasagi. IMO id AVOID!!!!!!!!!! that choice and i can offer info in a PM, not openly."
