6255650,Lake Of The Woods,2018-10-24 19:08:00,124,"Good to hear these two men were found alive and able to recover from their experience. When I lived in Kenora there was at least a couple tragedies on the waters of Lake of the Woods and some of the inland lakes each year.I had a friend from Winnipeg lose his life on Keys Lake,(an inland lake), while fishing with his family one summer. For three days I watched the Ontario Provincial Police and divers search for his body,... they never did find him and every time I fish Keys Lake I am reminded of that day as if it happened yesterday. Always prepare for the worse case scenario and survival will be easier if such an event should occur. I have found myself in such situations on a couple occasions having to spend a night in the wilderness in cold temperatures during hunting season. Carrying a back pack with enough to survive the elements saved my skin. Staying calm an not going into a state of panic is easier said than done but being prepared and confident in your survival skills can make the difference of life or death. It sticks with you for a long time and never really leaves you memory but the experience certainly reminds you of how to prepare while planning the next fishing or hunting excursion. I never take anything for granted anymore when heading into the wilderness and some say I over think it a times but as they say an ounce of prevention is with a pound of cure.Stay safe all you late season Muskie and big game hunters."

6255884,MN_Moose,2018-10-25 15:21:00,964,Got me to thinking... making a small survival kit this winter will be on the to do list. This guy has an awesome plan!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QJ9...ature=youtu.be Survival Kit Build - Altoids Style Tin
6253202,MN_Moose,2018-10-13 20:06:00,964,"This is from a FB Buenavista walleye club The rest of the story .... This afternoon I talked with the officer who found the lost Muskie fishermen. There are too many details to relate but the bare bones of the story is as follows: They were found north of Falcon Island near Lilly Island almost 40 miles from where they thought they were when they called for help. They were in a 16ft. skiff with a 25 Yamaha that had run out of gas. After 5 calls their cell phone battery went dead. They were out for 3 nights in a snow storm with the wind blowing and temperatures near freezing. They were able to make a fire the first night but couldn't keep it going after that. .... from the clues they gave us on the phone we thought they were in Sabaskong - they mentioned fishing at Turtle Portage and said they could see Rabbit Point from where they were on shore. So we searched every island between Tar Vat and Rabbit Point to Stevens and Stony Bay for 3 days. In the last call the first evening, they said they saw me go by and for the next two days they were convinced I would come back and find them. Eventually office Chevallier did find them. The older fellow was severely hypothermic and the younger fellow cold and dehydrated but both were alive. They were found because Ryan Kirkrude reported that he saw a boat and two people that matched their description on the west side of Painted Rock heading toward Fadden Island and another fisherman reported seeing them in Deep Water Bay headed toward Sturgeon Channel.... sharp eyes and attention to detail made locating them possible. Many people named and unnamed helped with this successful search and rescue - John Tennessen, Nick & Don Beyak, Rob Gate, Dean Sr. & Dean Jr. and Mike Gate searched for hours and contributed boats and gas. April answered the phone calls and Ryan Kirkrude reported he saw them and of course Officer Chevallier found them. Thanks also to all of the unnamed police boat drivers and helicopter pilots and plane pilots who did their job and also to those who searched on their own with out being asked or acknowledged... Finally, on the lake in the Fall, always take a paper map, always have a way to make a fire, have a flashlight, take something extra to to eat, have a space blanket and a blaze orange vinyl or plastic tarp to signal and to keep the rain and snow off. Thankfully this story had a happy ending ..."

6253518,gowrlop,2018-10-15 11:06:00,109,"I was fishing the Morson area when the two went missing. So happy they were found safe. The conditions were extremely cold, windy and wet. All boats in our group were stopped and questioned by the OPP about the missing men. We looked all over the Boomstick, Faddens and North Island area for the men. As a fellow fisherman my hats off to the OPP and all that helped find these men. The pictures give a look into the conditions they were dealing with."
6253600,Lazy Fisherman,2018-10-15 17:43:00,276,Glad they were found. Thanks to all who searched.
6253752,Bill Krejca,2018-10-16 11:08:00,6107,"It is a blessing when stranded folks are found. Now that the hunt is over, I'm still wondering what happened, and what lessons can be learned. It seems that the folks must have done a pile of running to expend their gas, and just wonder about how where they were found differed so much from where they though they were. I easily understand how one can get turned around out on the water, just asking for more details which perhaps could help others in a similar situation. Not to beat a dead fish, so to speak.... Bill"
6254290,Obabikon,2018-10-18 16:18:00,2370,"While this one had a happy ending, the next story out of Morson did not. 3 men were killed 2 days ago in a boating accident on the water. Two of the bodies have been recovered, and a dive crew has come in looking for the third. They struck a reef, and their boat capsized. All three were from the Big Grassy reserve. While I didn't know any of them personally, I do know all of their families very well. Incredibly tragic!"
6254314,muskyman73,2018-10-18 18:57:00,401,My condolences go out to the families of the victims.
6254316,Obabikon,2018-10-18 19:00:00,2370,They did recover the third body this afternoon.
6254436,Pooch,2018-10-19 10:19:00,4618,"Obabikon,What are water temps up there now? Just curious as I would think that hypothermia would be a big factor in a boating accident this time of the year?Pooch"
6254488,Obabikon,2018-10-19 13:16:00,2370,"I'm guessing upper 40's, but I don't really know. I'm sure hypothermia would be big."

The two were last seen on a boat near Fadden's Island on Tuesday. OPP are searching for a silver 16-foot Alumamarine boat with a 25 horsepower Yamaha motor. The first man is 43-years-old, about 6-foot-3, 230-pounds, wearing camo overalls, a blue rain jacket, a red hoodie and brown boots. The second man is 75-years-old, wearing a camo snow suit, with green boots and an orange hat. The OPP Marine and Trails Unit and the OPP Emergency Response Team have been dispatched to the area, with air support on its way pending weather conditions.

6252992,That Minnesota guy,2018-10-12 13:06:00,8293,Thoughts & prayers go out but at some point people have to be smart enough not to challenge mother nature. 16' boat with a small outboard on a lake as big as LOTW when the winds blows is not a good place to be.

6253080,Bill Krejca,2018-10-13 08:01:00,6107,"Not much info in the above story, there has to be more to it than that. More details might help others in a similar situation, or to be able to avoid the experience. Maybe Bill"
6253124,NARDA 1,2018-10-13 12:36:00,636,"I agree, but unless someone that has first hand knowledge chimes in, we will probably never know the whole story."
6253132,Pooch,2018-10-13 13:39:00,4618,"I'd ""assume"" there are only a few ways to be ""stranded"". Mechanical failure, ran out of fuel, got lost. At least they were found.About three years ago two guys from our area drowned on LOW. OPP suspected that their anchor got stuck and both tried to pull it and rolled the boat over. Anchor and fishing tackle found on the bottom near where their bodies were found. That's what filtered back to a friend of mine who knew them.This incident had a fortunate outcome.Pooch"
6253156,Obabikon,2018-10-13 15:01:00,2370,"From what I have heard, they were lost. (staying at Buena Vista). They were able to make a phone call, and describe where they were... near a red buoy and a brown cabin. They spent the night out on an island. Not sure if they managed to get into the cabin for shelter or not. I assume they did. There were a ton of people looking, including other lodges trying to pitch in to help out."
6253192,Pooch,2018-10-13 18:28:00,4618,"From the pictures Skywagon sent me the other day, winter is at hand in the area. Those boys had a cold night out in the open. Hope they were dressed well and had some way to make a fire. I wish them well.Pooch"
