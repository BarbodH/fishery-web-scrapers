6257728,andreindy,2018-11-03 14:54:00,308,"We think we found an outpost lake that we are going to fly-in to consistently (Abamasagi) every year. I have some younger boys (and older boys like myself) who take an interest in building upon our explorations and experiences. We all would enjoy building a contour map during our time there and adding to it over the years and then all the fun that comes with making maps, taking notes, etc. Does anyone have any suggestions on locators currently on the market that could lend themselves to this kind of fly-in experience, and if you do this yourself, how do you manage batteries? Do you bring several 8ah batteries and keep charging the others on the generator while out fishing? Christmas is coming."
6257750,BornToFish,2018-11-03 15:47:00,1224,"Greetings, Andre: You posed an interesting topic in the original post. I have been using Humminbird Helix units for two full seasons. I was drawn to these units by the AutoCharting functionality - seeing depth contour maps materialize in front of my eyes. Without a doubt, these depth contour maps have taken my walleye game to an entire new level! I will offer some comments and observations. First, autocharting is not for everyone. It has the mystique and fascination of watching paint dry. You will soon have to make a choice of whether you want to fish or conducting mapping. It's hard to do both at the same time. I think many folks would quickly lose their interest in autocharting and stop doing it, once they find out how boring it is. I conduct most of my mapping during the early morning or evening when the wife is not in the boat. Second, I have shown some of my depth contour maps to others. Some of these folks basically shrugged their shoulders and said ""so what?"". The information made available through the maps was irrelevant to them. In contrast, it wasn't hard to see the gleam in the eyes of other folks. Third, you don't map everything at once. It's best done in small bites. That is, prioritize the sections of the lake that interest you and take them one at a time. A challenge is that an individual piece of structure is often connected to something else. Thus, it's sometimes hard to stop mapping. Fourth, autocharting might well be a good thing for you if you plan to fish on the same body of water for the foreseeable future. You will build your body of knowledge over time. As I mentioned above, my depth contour maps have really made a HUGE positive difference for me! I started another thread about one month ago on the Canada Forum that addressed a mounting system that I now use (from Cisco Fishing). I also use an aluminum bracket from Cabela's (Sully Manufacturing) to mount my transducer. I have alligator clips on the electrical leads that allow connection to the starter/cranking battery. It takes me less than two minutes to install my Helix unit in the lodge boat. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6257774,adempsey2.0,2018-11-03 22:22:00,611,"I believe they all have that capability nowadays.https://www.navionics.com/usa/charts...onarchart-livehttps://www.humminbird.com/learn/mapping/autocharthttps://buy.garmin.com/en-CA/CA/p/543340https://deepersonar.com/ca/en_ca/explore/lakebookhttp://www.genesismaps.com/As for batteries. If you have access to a generator or solar inverter then you will have no problems at all. Personally, I bring two 7 to 10 Ah AGM SLA batteries so I can have one charging as I use the other. I am sure you could get away with bringing 1 for most units. Unless you bring in a sonar with a huge color screen and GPS you should be more than fine with 1 battery/day. Although, one trip last year one of our group brought in a large unit with sidescan etc.. and he did just fine with just charging his battery every night. One thing to keep in mind is to be sure the battery you bring holds a full charge. The AGM SLA batteries are not great for longevity. I would suggest buying a new one for each trip."
6257804,SkWalter,2018-11-04 07:07:00,515,"I just picked up a Humminbird Helix 5 G2 CHIRP GPS PT. This unit comes with a portable case, battery, and a transducer with a suction cup mount for use on any boat you wish. It has the Autochart capability that you are looking for as well. I have the bigger Helix units on my boat so I can just pull my Autochart map data, waypoints, and tracks off of those and put them on this little guy. I plan on picking up the XI 9 1521 ice transducer for it and using it for ice fishing as well. https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...d7256bdab5.jpg"
6257828,andreindy,2018-11-04 08:03:00,308,"Thank you. I ask because it appears as though it not that expensive to get in the game. I see you can get HELIX 7 CHIRP DI GPS for around $400. A unit like this draws about 800 mA. Which, in full use, would technically get me about 12.5 hours from a single 10 AH battery. This last trip I took the Humminbird 798c (about 10 to 11 years old) from my own boat (admittedly, rarely used) and made it portable. We have not updated our technology in a while. Looks like I could upgrade and bring the 798c for my Dad/brother's boat on the fly in. We then have a little PiranhaMax for the 3rd boat."
6257832,port1042,2018-11-04 08:56:00,509,"I went with a Garmin Striker 4 Plus which I bought for $129.00. It includes both GPS and EchoMap technology. It's small enough to easily pack even though we drive in to our Canada lake so space isn't much of a problem. I carry an 5AH battery which easily covers my use for a full day. I think I could probably get two full days out of a charge. This ""Striker"" model does not have ""maps"" built into them but they do record contours and routes so rather than seeing the shape of the lake you only see what you have mapped. I've used it on 2 trips so far. I just turn on mapping when I fish (but watch the sonar function) and shut off mapping when we're traveling. I've mapped, without trying, most of the areas we commonly fish and also a few areas that I always thought I ought to try. I usually try to cover areas I missed simply fishing before moving on. That just takes a few minutes and the system works great. On the downside, this unit cannot communicate with other units. Therefore the data I have mapped is not transferable. If you fishing with a large group you may want to make sure you can share the data with other units at some point."
6257858,SkWalter,2018-11-04 10:11:00,515,"Humminbird makes a Portable Kit that fits the Helix 5 and 7 models which includes the shuttle, battery, cover, and portable transducer. This is a great option if you already have one of these units in your boat. If you are getting one simply to use for portable reasons it is likely cheaper to get a PT version that includes all of the above from the outset. Higher cost than the regular unit though. The Garmin Stryker mentioned sounds like a good option too."
6258268,kzoofisher,2018-11-05 17:52:00,5144,"I don't believe you can. Live can only be read on a ZLC and a head that is loaded with Live. If you convert recordings to Lakemaster maps with Pro or PC they can be put on any SD card and read on any unit. Live recordings and Pro/PC recordings aren't interchangeable without renaming the files. Copying Live files to a computer is easy with an SD card reader, then you copy them back to another ZLC. When I share files I make a folder for each guy's card and sub folders to cover the dates the data was gathered; first recordings labeled May 1-June 23, second recordings July 7-July 19 and so on. I also back up my master card that all the recording went on twice a year just in case something happens to it."
6258516,Remi,2018-11-06 18:08:00,41,"The main advantage I see for the Zero Lines SD card, you have a huge amount of recording space, so for me the first year up in Canada, I could only record the first day, then the internal memory was full. When I got back home, called up Hummingbird and talked with them for awhile, asking questions, it convinced me to try to the Zero Lines SD card. Now I record all week long, never have to worry about it.I never tried to share with others or transfer the data, so that's nice to hear from the post above. Agree, it probably only works with other Hummingbird Auto Chart Live units and only from the paid for Zero Lines card. They got us for the $$$, but I've been very happy with it. Going to the same lake for many years, I have all our normal spots with nice contour maps and some years, I add a new sport or two."
6258540,kzoofisher,2018-11-07 03:56:00,5144,"Live files are small, very different that the recordings for PC and Pro. There's a thread from a while back in the electronics forum about the difference but yes, you're right, you can record Live for many years without filling up a ZLC. With the files being so small they're easy to share by email which I have done with a couple other guys for the unmapped Canadian lake we all fish. Some folks worry that they will give away their secret spot if they share and it just hasn't worked out that way for several reasons. One, spots on isolated lakes usually aren't as secret as you think, you're just the only people around the week you're there. Two, if a good spot can be fished out for the season before you get there you probably need to find a better lake. Three, we check out lots of spots that aren't as good as they look and those go on the map just like the hotspots. Four, many spots that don't work out for you when you're there may be awesome spots a month later when someone else is there. Or during a different wind tomorrow. I try to check out at least one new likely looking spot every day and I map them all while I'm looking at them. That's quite a few misses for a few hits. Finding other guys who are also mapping the lake cuts way down on the time needed to get a good base map by getting you many weeks worth of mapping every year. Check out the LiveShare site to see what has been done on some popular drive to lakes."
6259170,joevan46,2018-11-09 10:00:00,5,"easy battery solution, and works on all batteries and units. Most fly-ins are now using 9.9 or 15 horse motors with electric start and self charging battery systems connected to the motor. Make a connection for your unit with two alligitor clips, some wire, and connections that fit whatever portable depth finder unit you are using and you never have to worry about charging the battery. Connect to unit, clips on the battery and you're good to go."
6259332,andreindy,2018-11-10 06:56:00,308,"I wish it was that easy. No electric start with batteries where I have gone. My question involves length of time needed to charge 7aH 12v batteries from the generator. Last year was my first fly in and I was armed with three 7aH 12 batteries. Admittedly, I had a low-level, but continuous paranoia regarding battery life and my locator. Without the locator, we obviously would become very impaired. While using the one battery, I would have the other battery trying to charge off the generator at the cabin. This seemed to take a very long time even though they were new batteries. It became a running joke with my Dad about how that generator running was disrupting the serenity, and he was right. Dad would sometimes opt to stay back at the cabin and soak in the sights and sounds...with my running generator."
6259416,pan-man,2018-11-10 17:15:00,299,I just started using lithium batteries this past year for ice augers and sonars. I found I was able to run 3 times the time that normal batteries do for the same size. 2 downsides cost (7ah $69 vs $15 10ah $99 vs $22) and I found that lithium gives no notice of going dead (just quits). I found the chatging time seems to be the same. Just my 2 cents.
6259568,Skywagon,2018-11-11 14:33:00,1106,"A 7 amp is not much battery, especially if you're unit is GPS equipped, it would make a good weight for a marker bouy. I would suggest going with a 10 amp Lithium, they are a lot lighter in weight, do cost more money, but as pan-man said they last way longer. I have them in a couple of portable units I use for remote lakes and ice fishing, would never consider a non-lithium battery again."

But are you saying that a 10 amp hour lithium battery would last significantly longer than a 10 amp hour standard battery? I thought the amp hour rating communicates the general capabilities of the battery assuming a constant draw. Wouldn't both both 10 amp hour batteries run the same locator for the same duration of time?"
6257978,kzoofisher,2018-11-04 18:47:00,5144,"Good advice given here so far. Like Bornto I use Helix so my advice may not be 100% applicable to other brands. First, I would seriously consider getting a unit with side imaging even if it means upping your power source. By looking 150'-200' to the side as you travel the lake you'll find mid lake structure that you would otherwise have to drive over to see. When you see something interesting just put a waypoint on it and check it out or come back to it later. Staggering your daily runs will let you see a huge area of the lake in just a few days. Use Auto Chart Live anytime you are moving and you will have highly visible trails of everywhere you have been. Spots you want to map can be done done in 10-20 minutes for a basic map unless they are huge. Moving at about 6mph covers water quickly and gives good returns. Run parallel lines one way and then another set perpendicular to those. Go well past the structure before you turn because turning sharply can give you bad data from cavitation and you want to be running straight and true when you return to the structure. How far the lines are apart does effect the accuracy of the map and that is determined by your 2D bottom coverage. Contour mapping uses only the 2D returns. Deeper water means you can have wider centers and maintain accuracy. I don't worry about it much for my initial map. If the spot is good I'll be back and I'll add mapping every time. I run ACL any time the boat is moving between .5 and 10 mph. You can map forever with a zero line card using Live. The ZLC also has very accurate shorelines. Here's something I learned after a couple years. Find a good size flat, a really flat one, and establish a standard depth you can go back to with several waypoints. You'll need this if the lake level changes from year to year. If your base depth is 12' the first year and the lake drops 18"" the second year your new maps will be a mess unless you do an offset. So long as you have a standard you can always correct so that your maps are accurate. Live is really nice because you get the map instantly and you get a good shoreline with the zero line card. Garmin and Lowrance may offer the same feature but I would want to know for sure before I spent my money. AutoChart Pro is very cool and has really interesting features for overlays. It's also a completely different animal than Live and requires quite a bit of computer work that isn't really feasible on a fly in. If it does interest you some guys do the full recording on their trips and build the maps for next year after they get home. Here's a screenshot of a spot I mapped and a side image of what the bottom looked like. Since it is a point I had a hard time flipping directions and doing perpendicular lines. I was a little shy about getting too close to shore where there were plenty of hazardous rocks."
6258024,Remi,2018-11-05 06:15:00,41,"I've used the Auto Chart Live for a few years now on our drive-to camp. I would HIGHLY suggest getting the Zero Lines SD card, then the records save to the SD card. Hummingbird told me that you could basically record for 30 years straight before it would fill-up the card. I think you get about 8 hours of recording with the internal memory, that only lasted me 1 day. So, my approach has been to fish as ""Normal"". I just set to the Auto Chart Live Recording = Yes, and leave it that way the whole week, letting it record every minute of time on the water. After doing that for a few years, now I only record when going to a new area. When driving across the lake, also helped me find some mid-lake humps and better understand those as well. As long as your getting a good bottom reading it will record on-plane, if you loose bottom the graph thinks you are off the charts deep and the Auto Chart Live map will reflect that as well. Finally, I absolutely LOVE this feature. We do a lot of trolling with crawler harness, and I follow the contours that are producing fish, which lets me put a few more fish in the boat. I'm a big fan of Auto Chart Live."
6258216,Fisherman Ted,2018-11-05 14:54:00,461,How do you copy data from a zero lines SD card to a blank SC card so that you can use that data in other finders? Thanks -FT
