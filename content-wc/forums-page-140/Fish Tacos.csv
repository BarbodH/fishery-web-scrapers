6258248,Paul H,2018-11-05 17:00:00,1232,"My fav is Mahi-Mahi, I prefer breaded, but no breading works as well. If I do my own I use cabbage, Crema, a salsa, Pico da Gallo, or Picante. I've had memorable ones from several places on the East Coast. One was served with a black bean dish, a side of Guac and some rice dish. In a pinch some of the frozen breaded (the good ones) cut into pieces will do."
6258342,bushead11,2018-11-06 07:06:00,151,Our group likes spicy and we have gone away from the deep fried mess after a long day of fishing... Our new preferred method is just pan frying with a little butter. After a number of different seasoning options our group keeps coming back to one... Shorelunch Cajun!! The difference is that we use it as a dry rub of sorts not a batter. We just wash the fillets really well and dry them off the best we can so they are not soaking wet but damp enough to hold some seasoning. Then we dump the dry shorelunch into a ziplock with the 6-8 fillets and shake them around until lightly coated. Throw them in the pan and your good to go! We've found that its the perfect blend of spices and you can still taste the flavor of the fish. If you wanted to add tortillas or some coleslaw or pico de gallo or guacamole you could easily do tacos which we have. The other trick is to put the flour tortillas on the open burner flame for about 15 seconds each side to give them a nice crisp texture. I just made myself hungry...!!!
6258352,tparker,2018-11-06 07:38:00,100,Another vote for Shorelunch Cajun. Having some fresh cilantro on hand really helps too.

6258970,KSjim,2018-11-08 13:36:00,88,"Our group really likes to pan fry using Chef Prudhome's Blackened Redfish Magic for our tacos.The sauce we use is equal parts mayo/sour cream with lime juice, cumin, oregano, dill and cayenne pepper. Top with cabbage and a another shot of lime juice. Good stuff!We have used both flour and corn tortillas."
6258996,justaguy2454,2018-11-08 16:30:00,220,ive done whitefish in light beer batter then into Panko bread crumbs then into the deep fryer. The Pank holds onto any sauce and they are super crunchy.

6259784,Limeyangler,2018-11-12 13:55:00,563,"I love Fish Tacos, I like to use the soft wraps with fried walleye. I make my own coating with flour, cornmeal and seasonings and do a double egg wash dip method. Then you just add what you like. I like to lay out homemade guacamole, homemade bruschetta, cilantro, flat leaf parsley, red onions, capers,pepperoncini,olives,shaved parmesan, sour cream, capers, homemade taco sauce (lots of chilli and cumin), shredded lettuce, sliced sweet peppers, lemon and lime wedges and oriental sweet chilli sauce. Here is a picture of one I made for myself a couple summers ago...lol...now i need to go catch a walleye or two!"
