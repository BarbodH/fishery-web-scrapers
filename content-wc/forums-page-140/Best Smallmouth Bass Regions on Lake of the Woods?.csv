I've been to the Crow Rock areas, plus a day on Shoal Lake. What part of LOW offers the best June smallie fishing? How is Sabaskong vs Clearwater Bay vs Whitefish for smallie fishing? Or is there really all similar to the Crow Island upper mid lake area? I realize the water clarity can vary widely between these parts of the lake."
6260310,The tank,2018-11-14 18:23:00,340,I dont fish for smallmouth much but during the KBI tournament boats come clear from Kenora to fish Milesbay. But thats in July i think. Must be something there to travel 50 miles??
6260318,TRFDDS,2018-11-14 19:42:00,13,I have fished once per year in June in the areas west and north of Morson. Mostly target Walleye. I go out early and late in the day and target SMB. Not necessarily prime time for Smallies but always catch on the shorelines or just off. Been to Reel Em Inn Lodge (7yrs)and Obabikon bay Lodge (1yr) Obabikon is near Miles bay. Different types of resorts except they are both mostly American plans. Jared from Obabikon has been accommodating to our groups. Smallies are fun!

6260926,Bill Krejca,2018-11-17 09:24:00,6107,"Small mouth are fairly easy to catch in most areas mentioned. Shore areas with rocks can be great. My experience with the clear water, as Jared mentioned, has been that the fish seem to get a little more spooky when approached. One answer, when fishing shorelines, is to stay farther away, use a combination of lighter line to enable further casts, and heavy enough baits to be able to cast farther. Makes a world of difference. Bill"
