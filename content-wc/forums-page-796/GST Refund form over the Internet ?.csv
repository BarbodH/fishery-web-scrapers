542305,Trailerguy,2004-08-03 06:39:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]They generally want proof the goods either are leaving or have left Canada. How do they handle that on the net?
542307,McQ,2004-08-03 07:19:00,615,"Application for refund is mailed in, the transaction is not over the net. All eligible receipts must be included ( originals not copies ). Your entry and departure dates are specified on the form. Be sure to follow the guidelines correctly and only claim what is legitimate."
