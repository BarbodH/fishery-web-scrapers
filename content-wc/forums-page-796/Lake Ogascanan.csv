We caught 4 that were 25 inches the rest 16 - 24. We caught 75 little ones (9 - 15 inches) that we released (mostly in Taylor Bay). Most of the large ones came from the last northern point in the big bay heading into Ferguson Bay. Just as you said, only when it was raining or about to rain. We caught 20 - 25 Lake Trout when it was sunny and calm and did not walleye fish. Fishing wire and lead core line over 50-100 feet of water. Best day I had was 12 on my boat with several in the 10 LB range. We also caught 7 pike fishing that way. Biggest was about 32 inches. We release all but two lake trout. We had a 11 year old catch a 30 inch laker that he kept. He was excited! Eight colors of lead core with one of those 2 oz. Krocodile spoons was the most consistent producer. Two groups hiked to the catch and release Pike Lake off Taylor Bay a couple of afternoons and caught 30 or so. Nothing huge, mid 20's average. Sounds like they had fun ... I did not go .... Deer fly's and skeeter's were too bad on the hike. All in all pretty slow considering we had 3 boats fishing 6 of the 7 days. We got blown off one day (played horse shoes and dice)! That was fun too! We all liked Smith Pass cabin! Had a great view of the northern lights a couple of nights! According to Brad, one group did well at the Main. He said he got a couple of pic's that will make the brochure. They were fishing the spots on the main bay. I went up and made a telephone call one day and the cleaning bucket was full of nice fish. Go figure, we did not fish the main bay much!"
