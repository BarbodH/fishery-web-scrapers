Made my fifth trip to Goose Bay Camp on Lac Seul this year. End of May. Numbers were down a little, but caught nice size. Walleyefisher, where do you like to fish in the area?"

541551,Walleyefisher,2004-07-09 12:21:00,159,I live in Lees Summit. Where do you fish then??? or do you just not fish locally? Email me if you want. Walleyefisher at yahoo.com
541554,Guest,2004-07-09 14:16:00,0,I go on four or five trips a year mostly to Canada. Last year my wife and I went Red Fishing at Venice La. and had a ball. I dont own a boat and feel I cant really justify one. It seems such a waste to haul a boat to Canada. There are times I have considered buying a boat to fish some of the local Walleye lakes but I always chicken out at the last. Mike Kansas
