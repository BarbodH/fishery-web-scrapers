542228,Guest,2004-07-30 08:46:00,0,"Guys, this is gonna sound very noobish. So, be gentle. Once in a while when I am on Lac Seul I like to troll a Dardevle, Silver Minnow, etc. More often than not, they spin and twist the living crap out of the line. Thus, when I switch back to a rapala, the line is so twisted it is almost not castable without knoting up. 1. What specific brand of leader or swivel will FOR SURE stop this nuisance? 2. If the line does twist, how can I get it untwisted while on the water in the middle of no where? Looking forward to some great technical answers and links to awesome products, Avg. Joe"
542232,Guest,2004-07-30 09:26:00,0,MAke sure your leader has a ball bearing swivel and you shouldn't have this problem. I've been trolling with dardevils etc for over 20 years and have never had a line twisting problem unless I used a cheap leader without a ball bearing swivel.
542234,Gary_IA,2004-07-30 12:31:00,144,"I agree about using a ball bearing swivel, then a wire leader or other leader-designed for toothy fish-that has a swivel built in and a snap which is connected to the daredevel, etc. I recall years ago a particuliarly active cresent shaped spoon that would twist the line (braided nylon) even with a ball bearing swivel. We put on two ball bearing swivels, back to back,then the leader and then the spoon and that solved that problem. I like the cross lock type of closure on the spoons. I have difficulty opening and closing the standard snap on the swivel. I sometimes need to use my needle nose pliers to do the job. We used to troll daredevil of similar spoons for hours on end, so having a good ball bearing swivel and leader was a necessity."
542235,Guest,2004-07-30 12:42:00,0,I always rig with a ball bearing swivel and a ball bearing steel leader. Sampo makes some great swivels and leaders for this. To get your line straight let it out the back of the boat and drag it with nothing on it for a few minutes ...it should straighten out. I use nothing but Power Pro 20 lb test for dragging Pike lures. You will get no twist with it. You just have to set your clutch a little looser for strikes because of the no-strech property of Power Pro. It results in great hook sets. I also use 10lb Power Pro for Walleye jigging and dragging crankbaits ...it is a great line and 10lb is only 2lb diameter. Good Luck
542251,Guest,2004-07-31 11:45:00,0,HI. ditto the stuff above. If you go cheap with the swivels and other stuff bad things happen. you might think they cost alot but when you loose that big fish the 5 bucks for that best snap lock and best swivel wont even seem a concern. spend the money after all you probably spent thousands already on other stuff anyway.
542252,Guest,2004-07-31 12:14:00,0,"Thanks guys!!!!! Great feedback. I went to Gander Mountain last night and got the SAMPO Leaders, 30 lbs. There are steel and hefty. The barrel holding the bearings is huge...should turn easy. Yes, they were expensive. I also like the ideas about the swivel-line-swivel idea!!! Thank you again. I am putting up a new post about ""how far back"" to put a bait on a ""bottom bouner. Looking for more info on that post THANX AGAIN!!!! Avg Joe"
