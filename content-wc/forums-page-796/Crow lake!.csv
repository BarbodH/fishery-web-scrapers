542255,Guest,2004-07-31 18:22:00,0,"If you are looking for walleye action Crow lake is a poor choice. Its deep clear water is home to great lake trout action which are deep (60-90 ft) this time of year. Troll w downriggers. Crow is also gained a great reputation for smallmouth and musky action. If you are looking for walleye action Lake of the Woods (sabaskong bay) is right there most of the resorts on Crow lake have an acess for their guests to lake of the Woods. I have been fishing this area for the last 32 years and staying at Allen's Crow Lake Lodge, Crawfords Resort, or Black Bear Camp. They all are on Crow and have a shared LOW acess along with Lakeview,Bull Moose, and Musky Bay(maybe more). Hope this helps."
542256,Guest,2004-07-31 18:29:00,0,If you are looking for walleyes: You can do a very short portage from Crow across a dam to Cedartree lake. Most of the resorts have boats to rent there. Cedartree is a relatively small lake with good walleye and northern action.This time of year late in the day and evening should provide best action.
542257,Guest,2004-07-31 18:37:00,0,I said Sabaskong Bay LOW. To be more specific the LOW Resort owners launch is on Stevens Bay which is NorthEastern part of Sabaskong across the hyway(west) from Crow Lake if you are looking at a map.
