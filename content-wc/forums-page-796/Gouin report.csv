Four americans and 18 canadians were caught two groups had 42 and 41 walleyes over the limit and the others ranged from 6 to 2 over the limit. Remember that as a non-resident you have to front the money (canadian funds)right away before you are allowed to leave the country. The walleye are so abundant that it is very easy to overfish as a group, be carefull the posession and daily limits are individual, not as a group. Hope Atlanta Dave had a good time at the Oasis, sorry I could not be with you, as you can see I was very busy all over the reservoir. The full moon is a thing of the past and the walleye should be biting again, august and september are big guys month as the fishes go deeper in the evening. Have fun"
