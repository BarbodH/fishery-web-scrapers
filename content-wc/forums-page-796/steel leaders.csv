542222,Guest,2004-07-30 05:11:00,0,"This past June we were trolling in northern Quebec when the fish of a lifetime grabbed my Husky Jerk. I have landed a 24 lb pike with 30lb test line and no leader. The fish I hooked on this particular day was bigger than that. I had 35lb super braid line and a 12"", 30lb steel leader. Pike have a tendancy to roll and wrap line around their snout. That's what this behemoth did. I had him to the boat three times before he kind of casually swam away and the line went limp. He had cut the braid clean. Next time I'm going to upgrade all my terminal tackle and if something like that takes my bait again (if only!) I will stand a better shot at snapping a picture before he's released (on MY terms). The bottom line is this: Pike fishing is not usually a finesse game. You'll be able to get away without a leader at times for most pike. But when that one big opportunity confronts you and you're tangled up with a monster, he'll test every knot, every snap, he'll challenge your line, your pole, your reel's drag and your skill, the size of your net and every other element of your plan... THAT'S the fish you're fishing for. Big line, big leaders, big net, big lures, big everything is the only way you'll have a shot at a big pike. These things will eat a muskrat. They're not concerned about some whimpy 50lb leader."
