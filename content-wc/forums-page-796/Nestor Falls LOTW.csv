541856,Matches,2004-07-20 21:32:00,236,"Bubbalou, your post mentions the possibility of fishing both Miles and Whitefish. Unless your going to take the real long way around, the only way between those two spots is Turtle Portage. I would say that is very relevant."
541877,bubbalou,2004-07-21 10:46:00,29,I trailer to go between the two lakes. That portage is for camp boats as far as I am concerned. My boat is to big and to heavy to ruin my body hauling it across that thing. I can think of some really slick ways to improve that portage but it would take electricity and some I-beams to make it easy to use. :-)

541769,bubbalou,2004-07-18 08:38:00,29,Heading up to NF next weekend. Wondering how the fishing has been on Sabaskong. Would also like to know how deep the fish are and the areas they can be found. Do I need to go out to Miles Bay or can you catch fish in closer. I will also do some fishing on Whitefish Bay. Any info would be appreciated. :)
541775,Guest,2004-07-18 11:28:00,0,"We used to fish approx. 1/4 from the Govn't boat landing. I'll have to pull out a map to find the names of islands. We would troll cranks, like Thundersticks in a large circle between couple islands in approx. 20-25'. Always caught lots of eyes and some nice northern. I'll post when I get map out of boat. Was up to Sioux Narrows last week,and fish were in 20-35fow. I did find some as shallow as 17' and heard they were moving shallower. Water temp was approx. 75 when I left. Good Luck., Dennis"
541776,bubbalou,2004-07-18 13:58:00,29,Thanks for the info. It would be really great if you let me know the names of the islands. That 75 degree water sounds great for the family. Can't wait to get out of town. Thanks:D
541780,bubbalou,2004-07-18 15:59:00,29,Here's my e-mail address is you want to send me the information there[email protected]
541785,rpieske,2004-07-18 20:26:00,1276,"Water is in the low 70's. Eyes are scattered...small ones already up on the reefs, larger ones anywhere from 35' up to 8'. Miles Bay has been good. But fish are on the move."
541786,Matches,2004-07-18 20:27:00,236,"Go the Miles to Miles! PS, anyone been through Turtle Portage lately? How is it?"
541787,bellbuoy,2004-07-18 20:51:00,490,When I was there on 7/1 the portage was not working. Bellbuoy
541790,bubbalou,2004-07-18 21:19:00,29,"rpieske, are there any good reefs around the Blueberry pass area. We have fished from Split Rock out past Blueberry but never really found any reefs that produce that well. How do you like to fish them this time of the year? Troll, jig, Lindy rig, or spinners. I would love to be able to stay for 2 weeks and be able to experiment more but, I fall back into my Lindy rig rut. Your thoughts would be helpful. Miles Bay is a long run but I will do it if I have to."

541801,Cooker,2004-07-19 12:02:00,164,"Went through the Turtle Lake Portage last Weds. Worked okay but was a little tricky. The cable is kinked up a little bit and requires some mothering. When taking the trolly down the south side you need to use a stick to guide the cable (on the south side of the roller) in the roller groove. If you don't the cable will bind on itself on the way down. If the cable is crammed against one edge already, you will need to use the stick to ""push"" the cable(going on to the roller from the north) over a couple of grooves as you are bringing the tolley up the south side. Thank goodness someone that knew what they were doing went across in front of us and let us in on the secret."
