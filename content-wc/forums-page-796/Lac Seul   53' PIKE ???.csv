542231,Guest,2004-07-30 09:24:00,0,"A couple of years ago I caught a 45"" pike that weighed 27lbs so a 53 incher has to top out in the upper 30's maybe 40 depending on how fat it was...."
542236,Guest,2004-07-30 12:45:00,0,This Pike was supposed to have been caught last week. Is that when the Muskie was caught. If so they probably are the same fish.
