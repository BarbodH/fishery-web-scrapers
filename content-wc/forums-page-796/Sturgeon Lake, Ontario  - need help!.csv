540866,Guest,2004-06-16 12:41:00,0,Catman59: We're staying at Whiskey Jack's. It is on a narrows at the NW corner of the lake.
540873,Catman59,2004-06-16 14:14:00,345,"I stay at White Sands , its back to the west in a secluded stained water bay. Caught most of our Walleyes there in the bay. Its loaded. Northerns are fabulous in there too , caught several 40+ inchers last year. I have been to Whiskey Jack and toured while in my boat. I think they will take you over to smaller areas on Sturgeon, we found some very good spots out on the big lake last year. White Sands has a cache on a small lake north of Savant Lake. Its a great Walleye lake too. Im not sure , but would imagine that Whiskey jack has caches on smaller lakes too. Sorry I cant help much more , but remember they should put you onto fish as they want you to come back. The camp owners will show you on a map where the good fishing is out in the main lake. Sturgeon Lake is 96% underfished. Ill be there from the 25th of June to the 4th of July...........Cant wait"

540900,Catman59,2004-06-17 04:42:00,345,Im leavin in a week. Our camp owner and W Jack owner are buddies and they party hardy on Canada Day. Ill see if I can get some info for you. Cant wait.
541379,Catman59,2004-07-04 05:56:00,345,"Well we just got back from Sturgeon Lake last night. The fishing was pretty tough. Rained and stormed and blew every day but 2. The lake is up about 4-5 ft from last year. There are no weeds and cabbages yet , They say its about 2 weeks behind. We did very well on the ""on"" days and had to work very hard on the ""off"" days. the fish are there , just figuring them out is the tough part.With 2 annual regular licenses , we were able to fill the livewell with 8 17 - 18 inchers after about 4 hours on Monday . Then it was hit or miss through the week until Thursday and Friday , then the water temps were up around 65 and the fish were ready. Friday was our best day ever. We limited with biggies early and fished until 5 that that evening , released a bunch of nice fish. My 8 year old son caught a 20 incher on that day and he was excited beyond ......Very few Northerns yet as they are still deep waiting for the weeds. We did hit a couple , but only 26 - 28 inchers. Your trip should be better as you are going later. We had a 30+ inch Eye caught by someone else in the camp. They go to the northeast arm of Sturgeon , thats about 35 miles from camp and Im not that brave yet. I know the WJack guys will put you onto fish . One quick little honeyhole------take a left at your camp exit to the main lake , go through the narrows that head to the stained bay at White Sands. Then take an immediate left into that old camp . Awesome Walleyes and if the weeds are there hang on....The Northern love it there. Enough babbling and good luck.By the way , check out White Sands while you are there. Its a great camp with great hosts. Not a big fancy one but , they have everything and are great people and very reasonable....and their Thursday night fishfry is unbelievable. My moneys there for next year already !"

542058,Guest,2004-07-26 15:01:00,0,"Had a great week. Walleye were in the NE end, called ""northern lights"" and Nipigon bay. It is worth the motoring, if you have a decent boat, and the weather is fairly stable. Caught a 27.5 "" Walleye on Friday pm. Great way to end the trip. Lake Trout jigging was a blast as well."
542061,Catman59,2004-07-26 15:16:00,345,Im glad you had a good week. Any big Northerns ?
542264,Guest,2004-08-01 08:28:00,0,"We did not fish for them, though one of our group caught a 34"" while jigging for trout. One of the kids in camp caught a 39.5"". Somewhere up near the Rusty Meyers camp."
540758,Guest,2004-06-15 09:44:00,0,"I am heading to Sturgeon lake, north of Ignace, the third week of July, and I am looking for anyone that has experience on that lake chasing walleye. It is a big body of water. We are staying in the northwest corner of the lake. What locations, depths, etc would you recommend? I am taking my kids and want to make sure we have lots of activity. Thanks in advance!"
540785,Mwazzy,2004-06-15 18:21:00,9,"That end of the Lake is know for Lake Trout, THe last time I was up there we had to run to other lakes to get eyes"

540788,Guest,2004-06-15 20:19:00,0,We stayed at a place on a bay at the very northend of Sturgeon. We would fish rocky points using minnows back trolling very slow jigging just off the bottom or use leechs near weedbeds on a slipbobber rig. We would do this early in the morning and then travel to smaller lakes by mid morning. But we went in September and that was a few years ago.

540789,Pooch,2004-06-15 20:34:00,4619,My wife and I went to Sturgeon several years ago thnking we would do ok for walleye. We were wrong. Nice lake but if you are only going to fish Sturgeon Lake you better brush up on your lake trout fishing. Guys warned us that walleye were hard to come by and they were right. Maybe we didn't give it a fair shot. We left after a couple of fishless days. My fault for not listening to fellows on this board that warned me. If you like lake trout fishing then it is an entirely different story. Pooch

540790,Catman59,2004-06-15 21:08:00,345,What camp do you stay at ? I go every year and can possibly help if its the same camp. I take my family and we caught many many Walleyes and Northern last year. Our camp has a cache on a small lake that was loaded with Eyes too. you can send me a personal email if youd like.
