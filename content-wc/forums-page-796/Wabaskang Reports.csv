542269,Guest,2004-08-01 12:29:00,0,I will be going to Tall Pines camp next week and I am looking for a few GPS coordinates to test. Can you let me know the location you found the deep water for the Lake Traout as well as a couple of locations to drift for Walleye's. I am taking my 13 year old son and I am hoping to keep hime excited by finding some fishing action. Thanks
541206,Fred_G,2004-06-28 11:00:00,908,Anyone have any reports on the fishing on Lake Wabaskang? I'm leaving Friday with my nephew for a week. Can't wait!
541208,Trailerguy,2004-06-28 11:30:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I'm heading up this weekend as well, Big Mike, and Kingsway4, who post on this board are on Wabby now. It's been a month since I was there last, but my contacts indicate fishing has been good when the weather cooperates. They've had wind and rain for a while now so it should be turning nice again."
541414,cough6609,2004-07-05 16:42:00,48,Hey Big Mike and Kingsway...how was the week up on Wabby? Craig
541418,kingsway2,2004-07-05 17:08:00,15,"We returned from Wabaskang Lake Late saturday 7/3/04. The fishing was sloooow to start the week, windy (N/W 15 - 20 mph) the high temp for 6/26/04 was 58 deg F. & water was 56 deg F. cold nights. It warmed up to the high 80's by week's end and the water temp rose to 65 deg. We had fish for supper 1st day and all that we wanted the whole week. The 3 of us brought back 4 fish each, (3 each in the 17 1/4"" to 17 3/4"" range) and 1 each in the 19 1/2"" to 20"" range. The largest walleye for the week was 21"" We fished pretty hard (10-12 hr days) with breaks for lunch in the mid-day. The water is stained and we started off with night crawlers as we brought a flat of them to use. We trolled the crawlers in 12' to 16' F.O.W. on spinner harnesses rigs (red or chartreuse beads gold metal spinner blade, single hook and a treble trailer hook) using Offshore Inline Planer Boards, trolled at 1.1 to 1.5 mph on GPS. We picked up some this way and the other method was to drift with the help of the trolling motor to position us. We used 1/4 oz. jigs in chartreuse; orange; white; pink color dressed with 3/4 of a night crawler or a minnow and bottom bouncers. We did catch quite a few northern to 27"" while fishing for walleyes. They were all released, as were all of the extra walleyes. On Tuesday 6/29 we fished near Doe Island for Lake trout and marked lots of fish in the 65' to 96' F.O.W range. We used 1# balls in Combination with dodger flashers and spoons or flies and also Tin-flashers (they resemble a school of baitfish) and tried several different spoons also Rapala #11 in rainbow color. We ran a 150' wide pattern back and forth on the GPS The bite was off i.e. we didn't catch any, LOL. One evening as we were heading back to camp we spotted a cow moose with twin calves swimming across a narrow spot between two lakes. We also watched an eagle swooped down to pick a walleye off of the water and return to its nest. I sorry we didn't make contact with Big Mike while we were up there. All in all we had a very nice trip and enjoyed our stay at Lundy's Camp. If anyone wants more info or particulars let me know and I will reply to your e-mail directly. I just want to thank all of the great people here on this site for the useful information that they provided me when I asked for it. Thanks again, Kingsway2 Rich King"

541429,Guest,2004-07-05 22:31:00,0,"Here's me take on last weeks fishing...walleye, Excellent, Northern, Horrible. This trip is one of two that my wife goes along, and she loves to cast for northern, and also ""catch"" them. Upon arrival on Sat morning and seeing the water temps and lack of weed growth from two weeks prior, I knew I was in trouble. We casted all of my usual favorite spots along with several others and couldn't raise anything decent...who am I kidding...we couldn't even catch small norherns on our baits. It wasn't until the last couple days of the week that we started to move some decent fish on large baits. My largest was 39"" and 15 lbs, with only 3 others in the slot! My wife was less than impressed with the northern fishing, rightfully so, so we spent alot more time walleye fishing and even spent some afternoons back at camp just relaxing. Thats why I probably didn't run into Kingsway while I was out there because I spent alot of time away from the Big Lake where I just couldn't coax northerns into biting. Walleyes on the other hand were easy to catch with alot of 18-21"" fish coming to the net. North bay was ridiculous this trip, along with points in the middle lake. Funny thing we caught quality fish anywhere from 8' all the way out to 32'! This has been a weird year to say the least. On a positive note, with the warmer temps inevitable its just a matter of days and the northern fishing is going to go crazy. I'll be back up the 17th for another week with the wife so hopefully I'll have better report and also a happier wife. My dad and some of my friends are leaving this fri so I'll post when I hear from them."
541627,Trailerguy,2004-07-12 18:15:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I have just returned from Wabby. We were plagued by nice CALM days, or pouring rain. :( I guess I always have a tough time when the water is like a mirror, I don't know where the fish go but I don't catch them. Every time we got a little chop the walleye fishing was hot, especially in the cabbage. Not many Pike last week either, but a few in the slot and above."
541637,Guest,2004-07-12 23:17:00,0,"Trailerguy, I'm heading up Fri night, hope the Pike decide its finally time to start smashing baits, any walleye will be just a bonus. I plan on trolling lead core alot this week for walleyes out in deeper water, but will definately pitch jigs in the cabbage if thats whats working. As far as Pike, I think it will be good. Mike"
541638,Fred_G,2004-07-13 05:47:00,908,"Got home Staurday night from Wabaskang. Trailerguy hit it right on the weather, crazy. The walleye and pike fishing was tough, but we had some great smallmouth action on topwaters. Steve and Andrea, the new owners of Tall Pines Camp were excellent hosts and I'm looking forward to many years of fun at their camp. My wife and I will be back there in September. We're already planning for next year."
541657,Guest,2004-07-13 16:29:00,0,"Fred, surprisingly, our first trip in June was actually highlighted with nonstop smallmouth action....the best i've seen in years. Jim told me last night that the smallies are still on a tear and that guys in his camp are getting alot of them out of the reeds along the shorlines, and they are spawning right now. I normally fish Jim's part of the lake for them or up in the narrows and areas around North Bay, any other spots I should try that are hot? Thanks, Mike"
