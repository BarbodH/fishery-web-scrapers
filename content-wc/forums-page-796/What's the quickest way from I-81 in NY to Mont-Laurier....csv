I guess what I really want to know is the quickest way through or around Ottawa? I've done the mapquest and Yahoo Maps search, but figured some regulars that go up that way would be able to help me out. Thanks."

Keep right on Lee's Ave. Turn left at stop, continue on Lee's until it becomes King Edward. Continue north into Hull and stay on Rt. 5 which runs into 105 north to Maniwaki. Keep driving north through Maniwaki until you reach Grand Remous, then turn right at 117 straight on to Mont-Laurier. This is a time tested route. Ottawa can be a mess during drive times but it used to be worse."

TI bridge to 401 East to 416 (401 and 416 interconnect) 416 to 417 East (about 60 miles) Follow 417 East until you exit at the Nichlolas/Lees ramp Stay left on the ramp and follow Nicholas til you turn right on Besserer Go two blocks on Besserer and turn left on King Edward (at the light) Go North on King Edward and cross the MacDonald Cartier bridge to Quebec You are now on Quebec highway #5 Soon after, take the exit ramp to the right to connect with Quebec #50 Stay on #50 until it ends where it ramps onto Quebec highway 309 Stay on Quebec highway 309 north to Mont Laurier."
542210,Guest,2004-07-29 17:27:00,0,bean- retire 55 is correct as to the best way to mt laurial from ottawa is up 309 and thunderstick is correct as to the best way thru ottawa to hull- with the new highway it is not bad at all and all you are really doing is following the signs to hull and rt 5 nord. you will have no problems just follow the signs by the way where are you going - i am going up thru mt lauriel myself in 2 weeks onto clova? who camp are you staying at thanks and good luck
542211,Bean,2004-07-29 18:05:00,20,"WG, I'm starting to make plans for next june or july for a Gouin trip. I haven't picked an outfitter yet. I've been mostly looking at La Pointe Aux Dores, Nemio River, and Oasis Du Gouin outfitters. Thanks for everyone's help."
542213,Guest,2004-07-29 19:04:00,0,"bean- be sure to check out tamarac air , look up their website- i have been with them last 15 years eiter at goin or lak herbert- he flies you from clove to either mattawa bay, saran bay or plemonton bay on the west side of the gouin- never a bad trip and alway great camp and service. we are going in 2 weeks to lak herbert this year, which you also fly from clova -about 100 miles. another outfitter who has great camps on the gouin is air melegon- he flies from the i beleive the baskatong resevoir, avoiding the dirt road- our next years trip is taking houseboatd on the gouin- we have fished both end on the gouin and the shallower west side has better fishing and bigger fish because of all the weeed beds for the bait fish. just some thoughts to concider wg"
542219,Guest,2004-07-29 22:41:00,0,"General, Have to agree with you about the services offered by Air Tamarac. Went with a group to the Mattawa Bay camp in Mid June of this year. Accomodations where very comfortable with a very nice shower facility. Boats were very roomy 16 foot fiberglass with a new 9.9 hp Mercury and to top it it off the fishing was unbeleivable. We found a bay that was holding eyes anywhere from 4-15 foot of water. We went searching for new areas to fish everyday but always ended back at the honey hole. The shallow walleye activity seemed to decrease at the end of our trip as the pike activity in the bay increased. The guy that organized the trip uses the outfitters services for hunting excursions in the fall. He has stated that the walleye fishing on Herbert is fantastic."
542241,Guest,2004-07-30 19:12:00,0,"hi- i have fished mattawa bay and we always do great in that 6 to 12 ft range on cool or rainy days. by the way - i helped build that shower so i hope you enjoyed it very much. lak herbert is very good fishing for walleys and fair for pike - the fish are bigger at herbert in general, the pike fishing is better in the gouin. jean at tamarc has always done right by us and we go no other place for our main trip. what did you use for walleyes last week- what worked the best, what colors other than white? and how was the weather , temp? did you drive the parent road to clova and how was it and how long from moung laurier so i can plan- we always took the other clova road but i hear it is real bad- cant be any worse than our first time 18 years ago- 9 hrs to clova- 1520 mile max speed. just a little info that might help me next week- thanks"

542246,Guest,2004-07-30 23:21:00,0,"General, No problem about the post. Have to commend you on the great job you did with the shower facility. This was my first trip to the area and God willing won't be my last. I usually don't put many expectations on my first trip to a new body of water, but I have to say that this had to be one of the best trips I have had the opportunity to attend. We traveled the Parent road to Clova. Have not traveled many logging roads but would have to say this one is in good shape. Some areas were rippled, like riding on speed bumps, but for the most part you could go 45-50 mph. Saw many people travleing faster but we did not feel the abuse on our vehicle was necessary. Total ride time to Clova was 3.5-4 hours. We tried the Clova road on the way home but turned around and went back through Parent. Road has not been maintained for a few years. We stayed over night in Clova, Jean set us up with rooms at the Old School House. Very nice setup as compared to the old bunk house that the organizer of the trip was used to staying in. The water temps in the middle of June were in the low 60's. We caught the majority of our fish from a bay just south east from the cabins, if you are looking out from the dock. You can see another cabin from the area we were fishing which is apparently not part of Jean's setup. All I used were 1/4 oz orange and chartruese jigheads with a 4 inch yellow Berkley Gulp minnow or a 4 inch chartruese glitter Berkley twister tail. Was out fishing my partner that was using a jighead and worm. Then he got smart and started using the scented jigs. We would start outside the bay in around 15 foot of water and drift in. We would catch fish in all depth ranges. Biggest walleye caught was 24 inches. Last day and a half of our trip, the pike became more aggresive in the area we were fishing which seemed to slow down the walleye bite."
