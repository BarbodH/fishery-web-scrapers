542283,Guest,2004-08-02 08:40:00,0,I just tried using them recently fishing bellow a dam. We had been catching a ton of eyes using raps so i thought I would try somthing new once. I didn't have one hit and like i said we could not keep them off of our raps. My bait realy looked like the shad that they were spitting up. I don't have much confidence in the stuff.

I put on the bio-salt orange and yellow power grub behind a spinner and outfished the other 2 in the boat, one using minnows the other using crawlers. This was on Lac Seul in July. Was able to average about 5 fish before grub was totalled. At $3 a dozen for minnows, the power grubs were cheaper. Don't know if they'd perform that way consistently, but sure would be easier on a fly-in."
