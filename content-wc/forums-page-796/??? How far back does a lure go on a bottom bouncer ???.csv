542253,Guest,2004-07-31 12:18:00,0,"Okay, another NOOB question. Again, be gentle. I want to run some non-diving rapalas and shallow shad raps in deeper water on lac seul. I have some bottom bouncers that feel like and ounce or two. Each is about 9 inches high. How far back to a run a line to the lure so I don't get it snagged and lose an expensive lure??? Is there a better way to get these baits down deep to troll them? Looking forward to your responses. Avg. Joe"

542266,Guest,2004-08-01 10:44:00,0,I dont think that it is as good a presentation behind a bottom bouncer. There are plenty of deep diving crankbaits that will get you down in deep water. If I still cant get deep enough I will put a 1/2 oz egg sinker two or three feet in front of the crank . This way I feel I can move faster and not reduce the baits action. When fishing in deeper water I sometimes put a night crawler on the last treble hook. Seems like when they are deep the meat increases the number of srikes. To each his own....Good Luck
542276,bigfish1965,2004-08-01 22:00:00,3210,I do quite well with this set up. It allows you to use a crank at any depth and at any speed. A nice wide slow wobble from a jointed crank can really wake up river walleye! Hold it over and in the holes and let the current do the wrok.
