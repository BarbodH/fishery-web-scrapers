We would be looking for a business near/on the way to Ear Falls. I've contacted a few operations, but was wondering if there were any positive experiences or recommendations out there to help us out.Thanks"

1528736,jkrawchu,2013-01-25 10:51:00,26,We are staying at Evergreen Lodge in Ear Falls. We would like to do a one day fly-in the day before our Lac Seul adventure begins.
1528753,packpro,2013-01-25 11:29:00,695,We have used Wilderness Air out of Vermillion Bay for two trips. Our trip last year was so good two other groups in camp signed up for later that week. They had great experiences also. if you go to the web site you will see a good variety of daily options and prices. The pricing is usually based on air miles. Bob (owner) can pick you up at your camp and take you to the Lake of your choice. Looks like he flys right over Lac Seul to get to most of them anyway. PM me if you need additional information.
1528763,Duflebag,2013-01-25 11:52:00,218,Northwinds Canadian Outfitters can set you up with a one day fly in also. Teir base camp is at the crossroads in Vermillion Bay and you would be flying in and out of Vermilion Bay.
