1525159,tooski,2013-01-17 16:16:00,393,"Going to be the first (maybe only?) group this year into Eddie's Windsor Lake outpost come the first week of July. As most know it hasn't been fished for approximately 4 years. That's the good news, the bad news is the cabin has been vacant and basically ransacked. It will be like the old days when a tent camp meant just that. Windsor is really three similar lakes connected by separate narrows. Each ""arm"" is approximately six miles by a bit less than a mile wide. As if that wasn't enough water there is another mid-size lake at the top of the triplet lakes. One of the things Eddie asked us to do is to determine if that lake is actually accessible as there are twin rapids entering from the top lake. Windsor is north of Beteau on the same river system so the fishing should be outstanding. Unfortunately our fishing time will be limited as the main reason for our trip will be to map what we can of the huge system to include any reefs, navigable rapids, hazards etc. for Eddie's future clients. He is hoping that Windsor will possibly be accessed by boat from his base at Beteau. That would be a helluva ride. At any rate- if you are considering Windsor as a future destination feel free to e-mail me any specific request that you may have which may not be addressed in our mappings for Eddie. Through Walleye Central or at my home e-mail- [email protected]... PS- I think Eddie might be persuaded to allow some late summer or fall fisherman into Windsor that wouldn't mind a less than fully equipped outing. That is ONLY MY OPINION..."
1525167,5richards,2013-01-17 16:34:00,131,sounds like a great trip -- take a lot of pictures and maybe write an article that you can post on a couple of sites. It would be a good guide for future fishermen.
1525206,adempsey,2013-01-17 18:06:00,963,"Sounds like it would be a good trip. Some of the members on this board have been there before, I am sure they know about some of those things."
1525346,Larry S,2013-01-18 07:36:00,665,"Joe,As communicated to you previously Windsor will be an excellent trip,I was there in 2006 and anyone on this website can read my report in the archives.The rapids to the left of the cabin were unpassable when we were there due to very low water,hopefully the water will be up so you can get over them.Take lots of pictures,I'll go through my pictures of the 2006 trip and send you some. As I said in our previous communications maybe I'll see you in the fall at the Bears--Browns game in Cleveland Larry S"
1525389,tooski,2013-01-18 08:40:00,393,"Larry, I would like to send you a map if you wouldn't mind marking any areas you remember, whether fish or hazard... You may see me when you come up for the Browns-Bears game but it won't be in the stadium. Now that they have hired Lombardi as GM you would have a better chance of seeing me in a canoe with Mike Borger than at Browns stadium..."
1525732,Larry S,2013-01-19 07:39:00,665,"Joe,having gone only once to Windsor I probably wouldn't remember much about the lake.If you still want to send me the copy of your map, I'll look at it and try to remember any areas of the lake. Went out to diner with my Cleveland friend and he said the same thing about Lombardi,that he sucks, that you said.If we go to Cleveland for the game I'll get in touch with you.Still going thru all my stuff and by monday should know if I still have a marked map of Windsor.I still think your best bet is to call Ryan Brady for former customers phone # who fished Windsor. If you want ,I'll call Ryan for you Larry"
