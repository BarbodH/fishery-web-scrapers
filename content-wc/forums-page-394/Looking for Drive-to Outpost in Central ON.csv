Complete seclusion - looking to be the only cabin on the lake. 2. Pike, walleye and bass 3. Portage and bush lakes are a lot of fun for us 4. Decent rental boats and ideally the ability to bring our own boat 5. Located within 5 hours of the Sault"

Prairie Bee Camps also has an outpost on Prairee Bee Lake.Camp Anjigami has some remote cabins on their main lake as well as fly-in outposts. They have a bunch of portage lakes as well."
