Not sure I would see them as a true outpost as there are 3 other sizable boat in camps on Nungeeser. Having said that, the fishing on Nungesser can be very good.....it's just not a remote location usuallly associated with an outpost."
1525556,packpro,2013-01-18 14:56:00,695,"Our group of 12 fished Nungesser in 08 with another outfitter. We had a great trip. It is a good lake for walleye (good numbers and good size). It is also a great lake for plus size Northerns. Our outfitter was a noted Northern Pike hunter. We were fishing for walleye nearby when we saw him land a 48"" pike ( pics on his web site) on a sucker rig. We have some guys in our group who like to mix in bass and lake trout, so we never made it back. As for walleye and pike fishing I give it a A- to B+ rating. I'll look up my notes and see if I have any preferred spots. If so I will PM them to you. Have a great trip."
1525639,King Canada,2013-01-18 18:50:00,27,I like rustic. Won't be able to swing a Fly-in this year. I've been up the Nungesser Road and I'd like to fish the lake. Just wondering if anybody has actually used the facility.
