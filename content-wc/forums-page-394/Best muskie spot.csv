1527448,Guest,2013-01-22 20:36:00,0,"just wanted to see other peoples thoughts. Personally fish the lower manitou quite a bit. Going to the manitou and bought a trip to andy myers on eagle at a charity auction and looking foward to that esp after talking to steve herbeck at tha expo. Always wanted to give lake of the woods a try. St. Clair is a good thought and not to far from me. Caught a few out of Cave run lake in Ky also. Keep it going, got cabin fever. Eric"

1526854,Guest,2013-01-21 19:43:00,0,"So guys where is the best location in ontario for numbers and for a trophy. LOW, Eagle, Manitou, LacS etc. Lets hear your preference and why?"
1526888,Glenman12,2013-01-21 20:48:00,762,"I would first look at the Class A musky lakes..I beleive they are LOTW, Eagle, Lac Suel, Cedar Lake and I believe the Indian Chain..not sure on the last one..at least to my knowledge those are the ones.."
1526938,Obabikon,2013-01-22 04:31:00,2370,LOTW of course is going to be tough to beat. I've heard great things of the Winnipeg river system
1526968,v-bay gord,2013-01-22 06:37:00,3168,"A ""numbers"" lake is likely to not have the trophy potential...other than the rare exception. Of the lakes you list I would say Lake of the Woods seems to fit your criteria. Of course Eagle has heavier fish ......"
1527093,Richard B,2013-01-22 10:25:00,735,It is not on your list but I would have to nominate Lake St. Clair on either the Canadian or U.S. side.
1527104,fishguide1800,2013-01-22 10:37:00,84,"This kind of subject could go on and on,you have beginners and seasond vets,so its different for everybody out there as long as fisherman have a goodd time,all the lakes mentioned have the potential,wanigoon wasnt mentioned so i will add that lake yo the list,as the largest fish the last couple of years have come from there,indian lake for sure has the numberd but it also produces some good fish every year,cliff lake also is a numbers lake and some giants also,i like fishing all the lakes mentionedas i like to change the scenery every once in a while and still have fun catching small ones as well"
1527118,2746,2013-01-22 10:56:00,3206,"we are not Musky fishermen and target walley mostly and occassioanly Pike. We have fished Eagle, Lac Seul and LOTW over tha past 30 years and Eagle is the only place we have caught Musky.....and that was accidently. We would run onto them (mostly small but one or two heart stoppers) in Vermillion Bay. Never stumbled onto one in Lac Seul or LOTW by accident but know they are there."

1527387,zeebee,2013-01-22 18:31:00,1144,Cant ignore the Ottawa and St Lawrence rivers. Best bet for the next record.
1527428,BenBeattie,2013-01-22 19:19:00,232,Are you only interested in NW Ontario? And what time of year... summer or fall?
