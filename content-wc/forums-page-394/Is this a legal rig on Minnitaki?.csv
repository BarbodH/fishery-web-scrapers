1528291,TomO,2013-01-24 13:39:00,16,I hear what you are saying but with all the different opinions it makes you wonder. And I do think there could be some intrepretation with the spinners (is a spinner considered a seperate lure) but I also believe the rig would be legal
1527909,TomO,2013-01-23 18:32:00,16,"Sorry, from what I found I got some conflicting information and didnt know the area well enough to determine the zone or whatever. thanks!http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shop...2090605215036/"
1527915,tackleman,2013-01-23 18:45:00,444,"one weekend i watched a Real Fishing episode that featured the alabama lure, the host said that in Ontario it would have to be modified from 5 hooks down to 4 hooks to make it legal. Given that, the picture looked like this rig would handle 3 hooks so it could be considered legal in Ontario."
1527923,TomO,2013-01-23 19:00:00,16,"In-Fisherman also said 4 hooked rigs in recent edition. Local bait shop said 1, outfitter did not think my rig would be legal but didnt seem sure. My research when I guessed the zone said 3. LOL."
1527983,1jigfish2,2013-01-23 21:25:00,110,"From my understanding, it would NOT be legal. That is because you are adding the hooks, they are not attatched from the factory. It is like a stinger hook, not legal."
1527987,adempsey,2013-01-23 21:48:00,963,"You are allowed a maximum of 4 single or treble hooks (or a combo) on your line. The zone doesn't matter for that regulation, it's province wide."
1527988,1jigfish2,2013-01-23 21:55:00,110,"adempsey, that is a fact if they are stock from the factory. I was told by a MNR warden, when we were checked, that any add ons are illegal. That means stinger hooks, adding another jig like a crappie rig, two spinners, etc.. He was very explicit in his definition, it has never left me. I would say that that rig qualifies as illegal, because the hooks are not attached from the factory."
1528013,TomO,2013-01-24 05:12:00,16,"That seems a bit odd- so if bass pro sent the rig connected with the jigs and swimbaits it would be legal? How would they know what the factory rigged? And why would In-Fisherman in an article from 2013 about umbrella rigs note that 4 hooks are legal in Ontario? So confusing, seems like depends on the kind of day the warden is having"
1528014,TomO,2013-01-24 05:15:00,16,"So, just found this, http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...OD_097331.htmlDo the spinners count as a lure itself?Otherwise it seems to be legal, no?"
1528050,1jigfish2,2013-01-24 06:27:00,110,"TomO, I think that you hit the nail on the head, it depends on the warden and his mood. We were legal when we got checked, but we talked about a lot of rules. I can only take what he told us as fact. We did get checked about 5 years ago, maybe the laws have changed since then. I just abide by what he told us, no problem then."
1528283,adempsey,2013-01-24 13:25:00,963,"The regs are pretty straightforward. Not sure how they can be interpreted any differently than four hooks per line.There have definitely been reports of differences in how some regulations are interpreted by the MNR staff. I don't see how the four hook rule would be one of them.If it were me, I would use that rig without any fear of breaking regs. As long as I only used a max of four hooks. For example, three jigs with stingers would obviously be illegal since that's six hooks."
