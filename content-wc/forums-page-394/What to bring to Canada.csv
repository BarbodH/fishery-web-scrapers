1527352,Duflebag,2013-01-22 17:33:00,218,"This will be my 24th trip to Northwinds Canadian Outfitters this year. I have taken both of my sons and many friends to visit the Munford family for the first time through the years. One constant question is what do I need to bring with me? I will attempt to answer this question the best I can using what I have learned through many years of fishing in Northwest Ontario and valuable experience shared by Brad and Scott Munford. First I want to say that those who know me will tell you that I don't necessarily follow everything I am going to tell you. You don't need to bring every piece of fishing tackle you own with you. Less is better, bring what you need and get to know how to use the tackle and techniques thoroughly. The better you know how to use your gear the better your chances are for locating and catching fish in a changing structure or pattern. Fishing in Northwest Ontario typically involves four species; walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass and musky. Generally speaking, you can successfully fish for all four species with two outfits. One spinning rig for Walleye and smallmouth bass and one bait casting rig for casting to northern pike and musky. As one gets more experienced you can add more specialized gear for specific species and patterns but you can catch the fish of a lifetime with just two good outfits. Of course equipment often does break making backup outfits a good idea. For those learning to fish the area, a shared use of backup equipment is a good idea. For walleye and smallmouth bass fishing a spinning rig is the way to go. A good quality 6 to 7 foot graphite medium light spinning rod with a fast action tip will work well. This is one area where buying higher quality equipment results in catching more fish. Many times fishermen miss walleye hits because they hit so light. A lack of sensitivity in the rod results in the fisherman not feeling the light tap of a walleye taking a minnow. I have seen many times a fisherman missing several walleye strikes changing to a more sensitive rod suddenly catching significantly more fish simply because they could feel bites they missed with the less sensitive rod. I recommend a minimum of an IM7 medium light spinning rod. A good quality spinning reel with a good drag in a 100 or 200 size is perfect for catching both walleye and smallmouth bass. Line capacity of 125 to 200 yards of 8 pound test is what you are looking for. To me one issue that takes a high priority in my tackle decisions is weight. I will be holding this outfit in my hand for many hours. The lighter the better on my hands, wrists, shoulders and back after many hours of casting and jigging. There are several store brand rods sold by Gander Mountain, Bass Pro Shops and Cabelas that are not expensive and are of a high quality. Shimano Spirex or Sahara and the Pflueger Supreme or President are all good quality reels that are not too expensive. For a few more dollars, A Pflueger Patriarch or St Croix Stradic matched up to a St Croix Premier rod would be a good combination. For fishing line, 8 pound test in green is a good choice. I personally have used Trilene XT in 8 pound green for many years and are happy with the performance. For northern pike and musky casting heavier bait casting rig is required. Again, you will be making many casts with this outfit so weight is important. You can really tire out your hands, wrists, shoulders and back while casting. A graphite 6 ½ to 7 foot medium heavy trigger casting rod with a fast action tip is a good starting rod for casting to both northern pike and musky. A heavier action bait-casting reel is needed to muscle in a big aggressive musky. Shimano Compre or St Croix musky Mojo or premier rods are good choices. A good starting reel choice would be an Abu Garcia C3 or C4 in the 5600 or 6500 size. These rods and reels have all proven themselves through the years to be tough and good for years of use. For fishing line, 80 or 100 pound test braid is a good choice. There are many brands of good quality braid line available. I have seen spiderwire stealth and power pro used commonly. For the size reels I have recommended a 300 yard spool is needed. Let's discuss the terminal tackle you will need to bring next. As I discussed earlier, we tend to bring a lot more than we will ever use. Many folks bring enough lures and tackle to fish one of the bass tournaments you see on TV. At the end of their fishing trip to Canada they realized that very little tackle was actually used to catch hundreds of fish with many of them trophy size. The truth is a small box will get you by in Canada. Sure you can bring the latest lures and try them out. You might catch fish but in my experience, I consistently catch more and bigger fish by using the simple techniques suggested by my guides. Jigs, hooks, sinkers and swivels in a small box will catch all the walleye and smallmouth bass I can handle. A few casting lures will work fine for catching a lot of northern pike and musky casting. Sure there are a lot of lures you can collect for musky and pike fishing but we are talking about what a person coming up for the first time should bring. Jigs in a few sizes for jigging for walleye and Smallmouth bass with the occasional hungry northern pike and musky causing havoc and excitement. Colors aren't as important as a quality hook in jigs. I have seen too many really nice fish lost because of a hook breaking or bending on a cheap jig. I have also seen just as many fish caught on plain lead unpainted jigs as fancy colors through the years. Sure there are sometimes where a particular color seems to catch more fish but not enough to require every color. I would rather spend my money on a jig with a quality hook built in that will not fail and cause me to lose a fish of a lifetime. For the most part an assortment of lead jigs with the majority in 1/4 and 3/8 ounce with a few in 1/8 and 1/2 ounce sizes is what you need. Bring enough for the week, as you will lose a lot to snags in rocks. The other rig you will use for walleye and smallmouth bass fishing is a live bait or lindy rig. Very simply, a lindy rig uses a sinker with a hole that allows line to run through it, a swivel to stop the sinker from sliding to the hook, a leader and a hook. I bring both number 1 and number 2 circle hooks and J hooks for lindy rigs. For sinkers, either walleye sinker or egg sinkers in 1/4, 3/8 and 1/2 ounce sizes. The items you should bring for casting to northern pike and musky are pretty simple for your first trip. A few 12-inch musky leaders in either fluorocarbon or wire with good cross lock snaps. A few 9-inch original bull dawgs. Walleye, black with orange tail and twinkie are traditionally good colors. 9-inch original suick thrillers. Black is the most used with fire tiger being next. A large one-ounce musky sized spinner bait with black skirt and nickel blades. One item that every person coming to Canada for a fishing trip should bring is a good rain suit. I have spent some wonderful weeks fishing in Canada where I have spent the entire week wearing my rain suit. Because I have worn decent rain suits through the years, those weeks have been pleasurable experiences rather than wet and cold ones. You don't need to spend a fortune. Good affordable rain suits like frogg toggs won't break the bank and will keep you dry if needed. When buying a rain suit think about being in that suit for a full day. Buy a suit that is made of breathable material. A rain suit that is not breathable will be miserable when worn for hours. When packing clothing for the trip think changing weather conditions. A day fishing in Canada might start out cold and rainy and turn hot and sunny mid day. The opposite can be true. Nothing makes a day fishing more unpleasant than not having appropriate clothes for the weather. Just because it is summer and there have been temperatures in the 100's does not mean that you won't see cold days in the 40's when you get there. Bring clothes from shorts and tee shirts to long pants and sweat shirts. Layers that can be added or taken off are the best bet as the conditions often change during the day. A dry bag of some type is also recommended. Something like a water proof gym bag to put your camera, sun block, extra clothes and other items. When I say waterproof I do not mean water-resistant. If water can get through or into something, it will on a fishing boat. A good pair of polarized sunglasses is a necessity. In sunglasses you get what you pay for. A good pair of sunglasses will allow you to see fish you will miss with a cheaper pair. You don't have to spend a fortune. There are many Internet articles on the subject and many great glasses for not a lot of money. Next to your tackle sunglasses are the next most important, especially when casting. Other items brought are up to the individual. Remember, you have to carry what you bring and it has to fit in the boat with the guide, fishermen and fishing tackle. Think what you need and what you will use, not what you have and can possibly bring. Some items to think of are a decent camera. Remember, it may get wet, sunscreen, insect repellant, a good knife, needle nose pliers or multitool, toilet paper in a plastic bag (several times vital), pain relievers like aspirin, ibuprofen or acetaminophen, fishing towel (you will get slimed), gloves, a hat to screen the sun and a spare, Extra line, back up fishing tackle (things will break, get lost and go over the side), something to drink both on the boat and at night in the cabin, snacks if you want them, a cooler for your drinks and to bring fish home (for on the boat, smaller is better), your passport for the border, clothes from shorts and tee shirts to long johns, long sleeve shirts, sweat shirts, jacket and spare shoes or boots because they may get wet. The last thing to bring is a good attitude. Leave work and problems at home, you are on vacation. Enjoy the scenery. Look for the wildlife. Learn to be a better fisherman from your guide. Share stories with your friends. Bring your children and grandchildren so that they can enjoy this wonderful experience. Life is much faster paced these days. Going on a fishing trip to Northwest Ontario forces you to slow down, enjoy the day going on around you and enjoy the people you are with."
1527727,DD73,2013-01-23 13:02:00,131,"Good list. I primarily fish musky, and 80-100 lb braid with wire or fluoro leader is right on.One thing I'd add is a quality pair of boltcutters. If you have a large musky or pike get a treble hook in you, you absolutely need a way to get that hook out, or at least no longer attached to a thrashing fish and lure."
1528045,MrSimon,2013-01-24 06:21:00,922,"Boy aint that the truth! Last year I had a treble buried deep in the meaty part of my thumb with a small pike thrashing still attached to the lure. If it were a bigger fish, I would have been in serious trouble. My buddy had a good pair of pliers and quickly cut the hook shank so I was free of the fish. I still had to pull the hook out, but I was sure glad to no longer be attached to the pike."
1528744,misanthrope,2013-01-25 11:13:00,43,"Excellent info, gents. I've been heading up for almost 35 years, and still look forward to every trip like a kid. Just to add my $0.02 in the ""pimp my boat"" category: a drift sock with line attached to a carabiner, a couple of marker buoys, clamp on rod holders, portable sonar, batts and transom mount transponder bracket (from Cabelas), laminated copy of lake map and a grease pencil. And the pièce de résistance, the beverage holder. http://images.cabelas.com/is/image/c...vmdygvJ2lzn5Mx Spilling beer is alcohol abuse. Misanthrope"

I've been heading up for almost 35 years, and still look forward to every trip like a kid.Just to add my $0.02 in the ""pimp my boat"" category: LOL...I too have picked up a beverage holder for extra boat comforts.I also throw a couple small bungy cords in my tackle box for the boat. They help keep all extra poles secure and ""In"" the boat. Another idea is to cut off a section of ""noodle"". ( That floating piece of foam you use in the pool) I cut a slit down one side about 12 inches long and wrap this around some of the metal straps in the rental boat. I hang all of my lures on the foam that I switch back and forth too. The hooks dont get tangled up, the lures stay in place, and im not stepping on them while driving the boat. I dont know why, but I cant ever find the time to put them back in the tackle box."
1527375,fishguide1800,2013-01-22 18:14:00,84,"Right on the money there,i love those mornings when i get 2-3 guest coming with every piece of tackle over to my boat and then asking me if therr is anything in there they could use,and i come up with a handfull,and tell thats it,kinda funny,people definetly bring to much,"
1527383,stillangling,2013-01-22 18:24:00,149,"Only problem is that you forgot a couple of obvious things. First and foremost...rye. Might as well wait until you get to Canada to buy that because you will got hosed on the duty as you cross the border. Get beer in the US but not rye (duty is cheap on beer, ugly on hard liquor). Cigars are next on the list. If you are really keen on high end stuff you can wait to get the illicit Cuban variety once you get up here. My tastes tend to be somewhat lower end so I go for the small Canadian versions."
1527434,zeebee,2013-01-22 19:42:00,1144,"Well thought out post....comprehensive for sure except...tip money. You need lots and lots of tip money. If someone smiles at you...tip'em. If you hear someone say ""EH""....tip em double. If you see a moose....tip everyone in camp. If you catch a PB ...shake your wallet out on the lake and tip the Great Manitou. Well there you go, consider this my tip of the day!"
1527451,Duflebag,2013-01-22 20:38:00,218,Great reply Zee. In the many ears i have gone fishing in Canada I have made the trip with a variety of folks. I always use a guide. If I spend the time and hard earned money to make the trip I want to make that trip as successful as possible. One constant through the years had been that my guides consistently work hard to put me on the fish. They get as excited as the guest when someone catches a trophy. To me I always want to show my thanks to them for working so hard for me. I also think that in a way my helping them with the extra income gives me a better chance of having the great fishing guides there in the future. I look forward to my trips so much through the working part of my year how could i not show my appreciation to the guys that make it happen.
1527453,3M TA3,2013-01-22 20:46:00,2846,Well I'm glad we got all that cleared up.
1527462,keek,2013-01-22 21:23:00,1003,Good stuff Duflebag.
1527482,Mike Borger,2013-01-23 04:49:00,1554,HAHA! Awesome.
1527673,Pikeslayer8,2013-01-23 11:27:00,1460,"Duflebag, Again, a tip of my cap for starting this thread."
1527706,packpro,2013-01-23 12:19:00,695,"This will be our fifteenth year. Every you we have one or two rookies joining our group of twelve. One of our traditions is to start a countdown that gets updated 2-4 times a month. The first one includes the countdown and a general packing list. We have added and improved the list over the last 15 years. As we get nearer the ""Spring Fishing Sales"" we include a picture from the ""virtual tackle box"". Years ago we sorted a tackle box and separated components into different categories, walleye, Northern pike, smallmouth, lake trout, perch, terminal tackle, and misc equipment (jig punch, knife, stringer, etc.). The rookies could take the picture, hit up their friends and head off to the stores when everythng was on sale. In addition to countdown, and the virtual tackle box, we always included a picture from a previous trip. Could be wild life, sunset, trophy size, or full stringer. On occasion, someone would recap a story. In the end the rookies got everything they needed to take advantage of sale prices (shopping for the trip is as fun as the trip). Just our way of keep the dream alive during the cold winter months"
