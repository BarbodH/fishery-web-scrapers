1525476,JayM5209,2013-01-18 11:36:00,1050,"Fresh walleye (occasionally jumbo perch, never northern) for dinner every night. For 30+ years Wednesday night is reserved for homemade walleye chowder. . . . lots and lots of chowder with slabs of warm garlic bread! Out of a group of six, two of us do 90% of the cooking. Since the group swore off any deep frying about ten years ago, every year since someone brings a new fish recipe to surprise the group. Never had a bad one yet!!"
1525967,reconssd,2013-01-19 20:50:00,147,"The big fish trophy is brought on the trip and put on the table in the cabin. Everyone is gunning for the trophy. It is a traveling trophy and when you are in possession of it, you are king for the year. The trophy has 4 sides. You get your name on a brass plate along with the size of the fish and the lake it was caught on. Each trip we also do commemorative T-shirts. Additionally, smallest fish caught for the day means you fish the next day wearing a sun dress. It is a mandatory rule with our group that if you don't have a picture of the fish you claim to have caught, the fish does not exist."
1526024,2746,2013-01-20 06:44:00,3206,"We also have a traveling trophy but it's not for the biggest fish. It's for the biggest screw up. It's called the MFA award but I can't tell you what that means on this site. It's made from an old knarled piece of ceader, once used as an improvised boat plug, that is mounted on a broken tip from a loomis rod that in turn is set in a turned base I made. The name and year of the winner is written on the trophy with an ink pen and the ceader, as well as the base. is now nearly covered with names. Winners have accomplished such things as knocking off a trophy walley while netting, accidently turning off the kill switch causing several tense minutes in starting the boat. One guy drank to much, fell asleep in his underwear on the picnic table and woke up hours later with a sunburn he took home with him. I'm a winner from ""98"" for passing gas so bad it cleared the cabin.....and the list goes on. The trophy also sits on the kitchen table all week and inevitably someone picks it up most evenings saying ""hey Joe, what did you win for in 2001""? The memories then start to flow while we play the nights card game. (by the way, Joe fell in while netting a pike in a really windy bay)"
1526055,zeebee,2013-01-20 08:13:00,1144,"My ""tradition"" is simple. Get settled in...get my gear out...flip the top off a cold beer and start tying my terminal tackle for the week. I then thank god for walleye and the great outdoors and the opportunity and then, ....the sun and hangover kills me the next day."
1526605,EyeMagic,2013-01-21 12:42:00,10,"Larry- I like that concept of your Trophy as it works well with my tradition which is very similar that of ZeeBee. Get to Canada and start enjoying the Cold Brew not realizing the next day, It will be sunny, hot and hangover is part of the forecast before we leave the dock...lol funny stuff. Of course, I wear Black Jeans and a Black T-shirt and I am on fire before we have lunch. I'd be better off wearing a roasting bag! Pattern appears to be ""day-on"" ""day-off"" as far as drinking and hangovers coincide."
1527922,Terwalleye,2013-01-23 19:00:00,166,"Like most camps, ours has check in at 3 PM. Being overly excited and a firm beleiver in Karma; we have always called a few days before our arrival and do two things:First verify which hard to find things from the States our hosts might crave the most (Bratwurst, cheese curds, case of spotted cow and a bottle of rum)Second, ask if it's ok if we arrive early to maybe just fish of the peir while our cabin is cleaned or maybe even hop in a camp boat provided they had a chance to prep them.After three years of this; we pulled in at 9 AM last year to find our cabin cleaned and ready to go and a couple of boats with 50 hp vs the 40 hp most of the camp boats have.I like to think of it as paying it forward."
1527957,Glenman12,2013-01-23 20:09:00,762,"Yeah we have that too..we call it the boner award..its an ugly spoon in purple, yellow and orange..its on a lanyard and if you get it you have to wear it around your neck 24/7, even at dinner in the lodge until someone else ""wins"" it..some examples are throwing the stringer or minnow bucket overboard when they arent tied to the boat..had one guy launch his boat without the plug in it..but the best one and he still holds the award for this..my fishing partners son is a fireman and was bragging about he can get get Oakley sunglasses at dirt cheap prices..that year he had a pair that would cost $250 retail but he got them for just under $100..so we go on a long road trip on a smokin hot day..he's sweating so bad that he tears the sleeve off of his tee shirt and uses it as a head band..on the way back he's driving the tiller on the camp boat but forgot that he had the sunglasses on the top of his head..he goes to take off the makeshift headband and knocks the Oakleys off and they go into the water..off course they are gone by the time he can turn the boat around..so many stories that Im sure more will come back to me later.."
1527993,RolandDeschain,2013-01-23 22:39:00,30,"My main and most regular tradition is to get airsick on the fly in. My daughter has been going with us the past 8 years (she is 19 now), and sad to say, she is doing her best to continue the tradition. Past that - fresh walleye and fried taters every chance we get. Steaks first night in. Popcorn and cards"
1528017,CSH Kucinski,2013-01-24 05:32:00,1340,"Our (Dad & two brothers) tradition started the summer of 2001 when we did a fly-in on a small lake N of Barrie Ontario. Since then we have tried a lot of different lakes with two other outfitters and for the past eight we have used the same one. This June will be the third year in a row on the same lake. Instead of having a stag on our side of the family for my brother, we decided to go on our first trip and it has continued every year since then except for 2010 when my one niece was born. Specific traditions regarding the trip are that we stop for a chinese dinner prior to leaving Buffalo, I do all of the driving up North, we stop at the same Tim Horton's in North Bay which is the half way point for us, we stop at the same Tim Horton's just prior to arriving in Cochrane and there are other routines we follow like a map throughout the trip. The big "" Event "" that we all look forward to is the trophy presentation (see attached picture) which is done before we leave base camp for home. It is passed on every year to the person who caught the biggest fish. Not species specific, meaning if you catch the longest and heaviest Northern you will most likely beat out the biggest walleye. But I will tell you that there has been years where a walleye has won because the northerns were small."
1523288,Glenman12,2013-01-13 18:51:00,762,"You would think that after going up over 30 yrs we would have some traditions but the faces have changed so much over the years we really dont..on the first time out my partner drives and we go to the same spot..on the last day, I drive and the last spot we hit is the one from the first day..thats been constant for about 20 yrs.."
1523290,Guest,2013-01-13 18:54:00,0,We used to have one of our gang tell the same joke every year for the benefit of any new people in camp. He would tell it after we were in bed and the lights off.. Even though we have heard this joke countless times it still gets us laughing hysterically. The tears and eventual headache are worth it. What makes it so funny is he tells it as a hairlip and believe me he does a GREAT hairlip
1523359,HeHooksHimself,2013-01-13 21:51:00,725,"Our tradition is a poker game on Friday night before we get to camp. Most of the time this takes place at the Pine Grove in V Bay. The first one out gets last choice on chores and bed choices. We also have a grid with boats and determine who fishes with who on what day based upon the number you are in the poker game. Winner is #1 and so forth. The winner is also the one that gets to make decisions if we have a disagreement. If a rookie wins we tell him we were just kidding. We also put in 5 bucks a guy in the poker game. We also put 5 bucks each on each species: walleye, pike, bass and trout. (no whitefish, no lings, no suckers, no perch, no clams or snails, no crawdads) Whoever catches the biggest one of each wins that species pot. We finalize this at breakfast on Saturday morning on the way out at Busters. We usually just pass money around."

1523494,Mike Kansas,2013-01-14 09:42:00,1463,"On our June trip to Lac Seul with 7 to 9 guys we have trophys for the biggest Walleye, Pike and Smallmouth that are presented to the winners the last night in camp. It makes for a lot of fun competion and last year the winners were as follows. This will be our 30th year with this group and it is always fun to hear the bragging from those who have won the most Trophies. I do not allow myself to compete with the guys because it is unfair for me to fish against all the amateurs on the trip. Besides that I always buy 6 Trophies and keep three at home for myself. Walleye: 29 1/2"" Pike: 43"" Smallmouth: 20 1/2"" Mike Kansas"
1523517,camp chef,2013-01-14 10:33:00,915,We traditionally:Have breakfast in the same place.Buy the same liquor at the duty freeTurn off our cell phones and put in glove box at the borderIce down 2 cold ones for when we pull onto the last gravel driveway into camp.have grilled lobster one nigjht

1524011,MrSimon,2013-01-15 08:50:00,922,"We do a combined longest fish competition. Everyone adds up their longest walleye, pike, and smallie and we compare totals. Its a lot of fun throughout the week to see who is in first place. Typically, the guy who catches the longest pike wins, but not always. Its also funny how you often catch your largest of one species while fishing for another."
1525437,revitup,2013-01-18 10:26:00,140,"After picking up my brother at Minneapolis airport, we eat a nice steak dinner at Mancini's in Minneapolis (excellent fillet!), drive to Hinckley and play a little blackjack, then head to the border and beat the rush at International Falls/Fort Frances. Have breakfast, and get to the lodge as soon as allowed. Fish as soon as we can. Fish is main meal all week, until Friday. Have another steak meal in the cabin so that we can be in catch and release all day on Friday. We have $5 bets for biggest walleye, most walleye, and biggest pike."

As an adult I have continued the tradition.Bill"
1523028,Ranger319,2013-01-13 07:24:00,166,"After 14 years of hard core fishing on Lac Suel I can honestly say my least favorite tradition is NOT catching that 30"" Walleye. I am getting pretty darn good at it though! lolEach year we start in the exact same place. There is a very distinct looking rock and that is the starting line. No one puts a line in the water until we get to the ""starting rock""! In June it will be 15 years. Going to Canada fishing is such an addiction for my group that we already have a countdown started for 2014!This will be a great thread. I might have to steal a few traditions and incorporate them into our group."
1523051,pikeman14,2013-01-13 08:17:00,144,"Whoever catches the biggest fish of the week, gets to go through everyones tackle box and take 1 lure to keep. Theres always 1 guy who talked up a certain lure all week. The look on his face is priceless when you take it from him."
1523052,wallydave,2013-01-13 08:19:00,2151,"My wife buys me new fishing t-shirt for each trip. That shirt goes on the first morning of the trip North. We used to stop at the Village Corner for cigars, gas, and dry ice. Now we stop at Dutchies for Canadian beer, Cuban cigars and dry ice. Most mornings at camp I greet the rising sun with a cup of coffee and one of those cigars on the dock!"
1523073,3M TA3,2013-01-13 09:01:00,2846,"We do rock/paper/scissors to see who has to be Svetlana on the trip. I suppose I should explain further. Svetlana has long blonde hair, wears sexy clothes (beauty in the eye of the beholder) and smells nice. She also cooks and cleans for us all for an entire day. Last time MNR came to camp and saw Svetlana he didn't even check our licenses. He also about fell in his boat from laughing so hard. The guys are really lucky that I haven't lost yet."

1523093,nitrodude,2013-01-13 09:43:00,60,"In our 18 consecutive years, our group's tradition is as soon as we get to our cabin, before unpacking or anything else, we all assemble one rod each and head out to the dock and catch the first fish of the trip. After that first fish we'll settle in, but not until."
1523145,pikeman14,2013-01-13 12:03:00,144,"LOL! Almost spit out my drink....we had a ""Dookie Island"" years ago. Never got lost around that area."
