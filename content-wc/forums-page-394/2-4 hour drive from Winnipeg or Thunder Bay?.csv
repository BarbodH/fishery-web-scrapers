1524350,mrwalleye5,2013-01-15 19:52:00,1922,Excellent choice. I was there three years ago. I rated it right up with Aiken's Lake Wilderness Lodge which is a hard act to follow.
1525962,Davis Viehbeck,2013-01-19 20:27:00,48,"There are piles of options within two hours of Thunder Bay. There are large lake options as well as smaller lake options. You can have fantastic drive-to fishing for walleye, pike, bass, lake trout, brook trout, etc. Lake Nipigon is around a 2 hour drive and has FANTASTIC trophy lake trout, brook trout and pike fishing with options for walleye as well. There are also a number of fly-in options based out of the Thunder Bay area."

1526442,stillangling,2013-01-21 06:29:00,149,Just signed up. Total of 4 posts and every one is a recommendation for McIntosh Lodge. What gives? Forum is too small for that to go unnoticed.
1526476,Obabikon,2013-01-21 07:52:00,2370,Some of us like to recommend our camps lol

1510894,bassnblast,2012-12-06 20:16:00,56,"My brother and I are planning our annual fishing trip to Canada. We usually fly on United miles, so we have to go through Winnepeg or Thunder Bay.Would like recommendations for lodges within 2-4 hour drive of either airport. We prefer American plan with guide, but are entertaining the idea of an outpost as well (if they will take a party of two).We have fished Hawk Lake, Crow Rock (LOTW) and Camp Narrows (Rainy Lake) all on the advice of forum members. Really enjoyed all of them -- for different reasons -- but we like to try something new each year. After trying out a few more places, we hope to settle on a permanent lodge for the annual trip.We enjoy fishing for pike, smallies and walleye. Numbers are more important than trophies, though an occasional trophy is always nice (my brother caught a 33"" walleye last year ). Money isn't really an issue, as it is our one trip of the year...Any suggestions are appreciated.Thanks!"

1510949,camp chef,2012-12-07 07:20:00,915,Give www.bignorthlodge.com a call. They have taken great care of us off and on for 7 or 8 yrs.

1511242,MN_Moose,2012-12-08 07:00:00,964,Smith Camps near Kenora. http://www.smithcamps.com/ They have an outpost too
1513052,zeebee,2012-12-14 06:52:00,1144,Couldnt remember the name of this lodge when I was posting earlier but is likely the best kept secret in the Kenora area; price likely has something to do with it but the fishing quality is reputed to be awesome for all major species including the current world record catch and release eye:http://www.hawk-lake.com/index.htm
1513086,Larry S,2012-12-14 08:38:00,665,"Fished at Amphibian Lake Lodge twice in late 90's, also at several outposts with the outfit,I believe they were Whiteshell Lodges who were the owners of Amphibian at the time . Amphibian is an American plan lodge on the Pidgeon River system. The fishing was excellent,lots of good sized walleyes,20 to 28 in.Pike were also plentiful and good sized,several over 40in The outpost camps at the time we went were also very good fishing,the camp itself was a bit rustic,but I'm sure they are now upgraded Drove all four times to the fly out point from Chicago,I do know the fly out point is about 2 hours from Winnepig,and that they can probibly pick you up at the airport or you can use a service to take you to the fly out point Started going with friends to camps out of Armstrong so we quit going to Manitoba Larry S"
1513087,Larry S,2012-12-14 08:40:00,665,You can find out info on the lodge & outposts at jacksonslodge.com
1524344,bassnblast,2013-01-15 19:38:00,56,"Decided on Eagle Nest Lodge on the Winnipeg River in Manitoba. We've looked at it for a couple of years and things just sort of worked out with dates, distance, etc. Now just counting the days...Thanks for all of the recommendations! I've contacted many of the lodges about a possible fall trip (or next spring) and my bucket list has now doubled. Wish I lived closer than Texas!"
