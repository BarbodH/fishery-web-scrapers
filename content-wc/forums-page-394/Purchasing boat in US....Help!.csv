1525705,Gunner_Fletch,2013-01-19 03:25:00,74,"[QUOTE=Shellback;1525487]Spoke to Iowa tax agency. If you pick up your boat in Iowa, you would be responsible for sales tax. If your dealer can deliver the boat outside of Iowa, no sales tax should be charged. You need to speak to the dealer and see if he or a shipping company will deliver the boat outside Iowa. I would imagine all you would have to do is meet them at a predetermined place outside of Iowa. Depending on the tax due, versus the delivery charge, maybe you can save a few Toonies! Question....would it matter that the boat is being sold to me under consignment from a dealer? Not sure what the Iowa tax agency that you were speaking to would say about that. To my understanding under the definition of consignment....the boat is still rightfully owned by the private owner whom I don't believe can charge sales tax??? Thoughts?"
1525717,Shellback,2013-01-19 06:03:00,8083,"Didn't ask about a boat is being sold under consignment. If you were buying it from a private seller, I think you would pay him only the asking price, as he has no obligation or authority to collect sales tax. The buyer would then be responsible to pay tax where he registered the boat. Not sure what a licensed dealers obligation would be in a consignment situation. Here's what I would try to do. Arrange with the owner to pay the dealership their commission for the sale and take the boat back to his home. The dealership got their money, and can write it off as the owner changing his mind or whatever. Then pay the fellow for the boat, get the paperwork and head north to register it in Canada."

If you buy a used boat you have to get a hold of U.S. customs 7 days ahead of the day you drag it home,it has something to do if the boat still has a lean on it.Give me a e mail if you have any other questions"
1524081,MrSimon,2013-01-15 11:13:00,922,"To import a boat to Canada, does it already have to be registered and titled? If so, you will have to register and title it in the state where you bought it, then transfer everything once you import it to Canada."
1524082,3M TA3,2013-01-15 11:14:00,2846,"That sorta sounds right. For example, I bought my Gold Wing from Arkansas without paying sales tax but did pay it when I registered it here at home. I sold the Gold Wing to a guy from Red Deer, Alberta and he paid no sales tax. We even went to the Secretary of State to formalize the entire transaction. All we paid for was a 10 day transport permit. Didn't think they were after a cut at all."
1524224,Gunner_Fletch,2013-01-15 15:06:00,74,"Thanks for the replys. No, the boat does not have to be registered until brought back to Canada. As far as the person that said you pay the tax in the state your new vehicle is to be registered, hey, I'll buy that. BUT...we're talking apples and oranges here. You are not importing a purchase to another country...I am."
1524251,Shellback,2013-01-15 16:14:00,8083,"That's why you need to talk the the state tax agency, in the state of purchase, regarding buying the boat in the US and registering it in Canada. You haven't mentioned what state you are buying the boat in, so you could get 50 different opinions here, one for each state in the US."
1524274,Skywagon,2013-01-15 17:11:00,1106,"I have some experience in this. You did not mention the state you are importing from, but if it is Mn, you will have to pay their sales tax, since you are bringing it back to Canada (yes, it can be transfered to another state without tax, but that does not apply to you, importing into Canada). No you do not have to register it in the state you buy it in (you know that) as it will be going to Canada. Yes Canadian Tire is where you will probably end up doing the inspection. Proving there are no re-calls on the trailer can be challeging, but mostly just more work. It is really not a big deal after you have went through it the first time, but paying double tax always sucks. I feel your pain."

1523929,Gunner_Fletch,2013-01-15 05:05:00,74,"I am in the process of purchasing a used boat in the states. I'm pretty sure I have all my ducks in a row wrt the proper documentation required at the border to import the boat/trailor. This includes separate bill of sales for trailor and boat, VIN (statement of compliance for trailor), proof of ownership (title). My biggest question is....do I pay state sales tax for the used boat package if importing and registering the boat in Canada for non-commercial use? I'm fairly certain I don't because I will pay the tax at the border when crossing into Canada. The ""dude"" at the dealer is adamant that I will be charged state tax on the purchase price. Can someone show me a document that spells out the laws with respect to this issue. Thanks."
1523935,Shellback,2013-01-15 05:37:00,8083,"Laws from state to state vary, it would be in your best interest to contact the state govt you are buying the boat at. Get the facts in writing or in an email from the state agency. If you take the dealers word, and pay the tax, you may be in for a long wait for a refund. I have never heard of paying tax twice on a boat within the states. If you were required to pay the tax at the selling state, there would probably be a credit issued to the state it would be registered in."
1523938,Hawker,2013-01-15 05:54:00,3967,"Pretty sure you'll be required to pay the State sales tax buying from a dealer as the ""tax"" you'll be required to pay at the border isn't State sales tax, but more of a ""duty tax"" instead. Had you bought from an individual (depending on state) you may have gotten around paying a State sales tax, but buying from a dealer, I'm betting it'll be anty up time! Hope ya got a GREAT deal on the boat!"
1523940,Gunner_Fletch,2013-01-15 06:04:00,74,"I'm aware of the state to state laws wrt to sales tax issues. However, this is a federal import/export issue which may or may not supersede state tax laws."
1523974,Andre (wallyandre),2013-01-15 07:17:00,2274,If you are buying from a dealer I'm pretty sure you will have to pay the states tx except if the boat is deliver in another state. If you are buying from a private there is no tax.Once at the border you pay the fed and prov. taxes + prov. taxes on the trailer value and $200 something for the trailer compliancy and inspection of the trailer once in Canada; Canadian Tire are habitually the one that does the inspection. You alo need a official letter of Canadian compliancy from the trailer builder.
1524009,MrSimon,2013-01-15 08:47:00,922,"Yup, if you buy and take delivery of the boat in a state that charges sales tax, you have to pay it. The state doesn't care if you stay in that state or take it to Russia .... they'll get their cut."
1524012,camp chef,2013-01-15 08:52:00,915,"I don't about boats, but with cars and trucks if bought in Wisconsin.....tax is paid to the Sate in which it is titled, not Wisconsin."
1524015,clarkend,2013-01-15 08:56:00,140,I believe if you are a Canadian buying in ND....then you can apply to get a refund on the ND sales tax.
1524028,Shellback,2013-01-15 09:42:00,8083,"Here's some info about taxes on a vehicle purchased in Pennsylvania, but to be registered in another state. I would assume it would be the same for a boat, as they are titled also. The tax is paid where it will be registered. I just typed the question in my browser window for PA, I imagine you could do the same for the state you plan to purchase the boat from. I am a resident of another state. I plan on purchasing a car in PA. The car will be licensed & registered in my state of residence. Must I pay PA sales tax?

1524077,Guest,2013-01-15 11:10:00,0,"Wrong. Many states have agreements with other states to not collect taxes and/or collect taxes and pass them onto the state of registration. Florida, for example, would not collect taxes if the vehicle was going to be registered in Michigan. And some states don't collect taxes at all on boats. But you already knew that. So getting their cut isn't nesseccarily an accurate staement."
