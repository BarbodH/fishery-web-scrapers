1527868,Duflebag,2013-01-23 16:58:00,218,Thank you for the great slideshow he Hooks. It sure did brighten a cold January day. Seeing you in front of cabin 9 at Pine Grove reminded me of the many nights spent there hearing the train at night behind the cabin. Can't wait to head north.
1527887,Glenman12,2013-01-23 17:42:00,762,"Hooks...about 20 yrs or so ago we were one of those red boats..we took a break from Cedar Lake and fished Wabaskang for a week..did the portage down to Wine Lake..what a blast it was and some great fishing..We did so much running around trying spots that we ran low on gas..stopped in to WLC met the owner..he gave us a tour of the place and sold us some gas.. As for the gravesite, we also came across that, got out of the boat and checked it out..I seem to recall, at least back then, that there was a tip jar there with a few coins in it."

1527718,HeHooksHimself,2013-01-23 12:42:00,725,"We finally got our YouTube slide show up from our trip in 2012 walleye opener. One of our guys, a rookie, is quite into photography and drawing, so we got some pretty good pictures that captured our week at Wine Lake Camp. I hope you enjoy!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY9Et...ature=youtu.be"
1527730,wallydave,2013-01-23 13:05:00,2151,"Hooks, thanks sharing for the video! Nothing like wacthing these video's to help with the dreaded ""cabin fever"" this time of year! Have a great year!"
1527731,Glenman12,2013-01-23 13:07:00,762,That was really well done..thanks for sharing..
1527732,HeHooksHimself,2013-01-23 13:08:00,725,"I have been bugging my son to get this up for eight months. I finally shamed him into it. I am on WC a couple times a day this time of year! 113 days to go, not that anybody's counting..."
1527738,adempsey,2013-01-23 13:21:00,963,Good show! Thanks for putting that together. Looks like a great place to spend a few weeks at.
1527744,UKBDM,2013-01-23 13:34:00,178,"That will generate memories for a lifetime!I didn't see any of those ""**** red boats"" from Wabby. I thought they were everywhere!"
1527774,Pikeslayer8,2013-01-23 14:21:00,1460,Very cool video Hooks! I liked how it showed you guys power washing out your boats at the end of your trip. Also liked the way the Wine Lake Camp's watercolor paintings were incorporated into the video. What was the well maintained grave with the picket fence all about?
1527795,Larry S,2013-01-23 15:04:00,665,"Excellent pictures Hooks,I especially enjoyed all the Chicago White Sox shirts & jerseys worn by your group. I get sick and tired of the many people wearing Cubs shirts out here in the Las Vegas Area Wine Lake looks like a great camp for multi species.I usually fly to Minnesota and meet friends,then we drive up to Canada thru Pidgeon Falls and go on a fly-in out of Pickle Lake Good Fishing Larry S"
1527803,HeHooksHimself,2013-01-23 15:23:00,725,"All credit goes to Skidwad and Pikemaster. Skidwad did the video with the help of his wife (my daughter) and Pikemaster took most of the pics. Pikemaster and the Hamster did the watercolors and drawings. As far as the Sox stuff goes, we all are big fans except Dunkin' Bob (Tigers). We all hate the Cubs with a passion.Dempsey- I would recommend it! We go there almost every years (since 2000)UK- It was too early in the year and the Wabby wimps don't usually try the portage when the water's low plus Wabby is producing at this time too. If we see them though, I will wave and smile- I'm a new man!Pikeslayer- That wasn't us powerwashing, that was Herb, the owner, and his help. they do that every Friday and that's why the equipment is in good shape. The grave is a landmark appropriately named ""baby's grave."" The legend has it that a native family had a baby die and buried it there. Some time in the 50's, a regular found it and took it upon himself to keep it looking good. His family has kept up the grave since then, attending to it on their yearly fishing trips. That's the story I have been told, I am sure some other WLC regular will correct me if I have that wrong."
1527835,ILScott,2013-01-23 16:03:00,139,That was a great video and I also go to Wine and I can imagine every place that each picture was taken at. I told my wife my pictures look almost identical. I also stay in the moose and although it is a little older a darker than the other cabins it has an awesome deck and you are a little more secluded. The first time I went to Wine I stayed in the Dynamite Bay outpost and boy was that fun.
