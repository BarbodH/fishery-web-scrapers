We have 6 or 7 spots we fish between the cabins and Maynard. We are arriving this year on 7/20 and leaving on 7/26, which week ar eyou going to be there?"
1524411,Guest,2013-01-16 05:35:00,0,I talked to josh owner of maynard lake camp english river must fly in to lodge from kenora the oupost cabin could be in our budget;have any of guys ever fished the camp very remote according to owner big northerns and walleyes on a regular basis caught also a portage smallmouth bass lake as part of package;anyone who fished lodge appreciate a feed back the fishing sounds to good to be true jim wolf chicago boys planning on possibility mid september trip
1525547,KSjim,2013-01-18 14:42:00,88,"We fished out of the Lodge in 03 and 05. Caught walleye to 26"",pike to 42"", and smallmouth to 19"". Overall fishing was very good. Josh runs a first class operation. If there is a draw back it would be that Maynard is not a huge lake. You will be at times fishing around other people."
1525587,Guest,2013-01-18 16:05:00,0,dear sir thanks for input on maynard were you guys able to catch 50 walleyes/man/day and how many big northerns did you catch also did you fish the smallmouth bass lake and how was it;what month did you fish jim wolf
1526242,KSjim,2013-01-20 16:09:00,88,"On our two trips we fished the first week of June and the first week of July. The June trip we caught more walleye daily but smaller on average than the July trip. 30 to 50 a day per man would be a guess.We fished the bass lake in June, caught bass all day on topwater to 17"", had a blast. The July trip my fishing partner was not up to the portage, it is not an easy one.We rarely target Northern. Most of our big fish were caught on a jig and minnow. Still we caught several 34"" or bigger on each trip. We had two good trips to Maynard."
1526446,Guest,2013-01-21 06:32:00,0,kj sim thanks for all your on maynard lake jim wolf I think we make the trip
1526466,fishnuts,2013-01-21 07:36:00,79,"We used to tent camp in that area back in the 80's. Being on the English River system, you are not just limited to Mayard. I remember getting into Oak, Ball, Lount, and the northern part of Separation. All have great walleye, northen, and smallmouth. ENJOY!"
1526595,Bigstorm,2013-01-21 12:20:00,799,"I have been staying 20 miles down river of Maynard for the past 8 years, I'm not aware of a way to get below Maynard Falls when you start in Maynard Lake though. We always make a trip up to Maynard Falls for a day but we cant get above the falls."
1526760,Guest,2013-01-21 18:02:00,0,bigstorm the only way in maynard lake is by plane or can have someone from lost resort take you to maynard falls and do a difficult hilly portage into the lake we have fished grassy narrows resort and ball lake lodge in the past both run nby the same tribe and fished close to falls;must be very careful near falls several people have been killed going over falls after being sucked into falls by rapid current be very careful jim wolf
1526986,Bigstorm,2013-01-22 07:20:00,799,"wolf, thats what I was thinking - that Maynard Lake was pretty much only accessable by plane. I used to fish out of Grrassy Narrows Resort as well, but thats been shut down for the last 3 or 4 years. Our group goes thru someone else on that system now"
1527349,Guest,2013-01-22 17:28:00,0,bigstorm bonnie and trevor have broken off from the indian tribe politics and opened a new 3 cabin resort (all new fully equiped cabins) called lost resort checkout website great people always treated us well cannot beat the price and fishing on the english river have you ever visited the ball lake lodge run by some of the indians complete diaster 3 years would never go again have you gone far enough north to fish dumpy lake and maynard falls;thinking of a late july trip to lost resort jim wolf
