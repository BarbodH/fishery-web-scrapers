1521760,dogrodder,2013-01-10 06:04:00,400,"x2 on the letter and documentation. I crossed a couple of years ago with my 12 year old and was asked to produce a letter from my wife. I had downloaded an authorization to travel consent form off the web, my wife filled it out and it worked fine. Passport card for the youngster is probably in order to have. Lots of drive to camps within two hours of Ft. Frances."
1522605,Shotgun,2013-01-12 05:35:00,759,"Have crossed several times with a nephew. If from a divorced family take a copy of the divorce to show custody, letter of permission explaining your relationship that is notarized and where you are going. Enjoy the trip!"

1520717,Mudpuippy,2013-01-07 15:34:00,23,"I'm thinking of taking my 6 year old grandson to Canada this summer. North of International Falls somewhere. The kid never quits and lives to fish. I need to do this before health problems catch up to me.Probosbly drive in, house keeping, have my own boat,June time frame.I'm making two trips to Seul for musky fishing this year, just not the venue for a young guy....Average walleye, average Northern yes.Would you folks be kind enough to share a good spot that will give my grandson those memories we all share....Thanks in advanceMudpuppy"
1520719,fishforlife,2013-01-07 15:39:00,77,Where will you be coming from? I am taking my 7 year old grandson to Nakina on a fly in to Brace Lake in August. My grandson is the same way about fishing.
1520756,NMG,2013-01-07 16:53:00,1053,"Can't help with locations Mudpuippy, but just make sure you have everything you need since he is not your child and per your post, I assume that his parents won't be joining him. Here is some info from the Citizenship and Immigration Canada website:http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/arriving.asp""Children under the age of 18 should have valid identification with them. If you are travelling with a child and you are not the child’s parent or guardian, you should have a letter from the child’s parent or guardian authorizing entry into Canada. If you are the child’s only guardian, you should have documents to show there is no other guardian. For example, a birth certificate that does not identify the father would be suitable""I'm not sure how stringent they are on this stuff at the border, but better safe than sorry. Hope you get some good info so you can have a great trip!"
1520757,bigwalleye1,2013-01-07 17:00:00,2632,"There are a number of drive-to housekeeping camps near Lac Seul that are on different bodies of water, but you have the option of trailering to the big lake for a day or launching at the camp and leaving the boat at the doc to fish nearby waters. I stay at Frog Rapids camp, and have been vary happy there. Lots of surrounding water to boat to, but trailering to Deception Landing on the SE side is ony 10 miles away. PM me if you like. We go there in June as well."
1520794,CI_Guy,2013-01-07 18:01:00,2118,"I'd also recomend Frog Rapids camp near Sioux Lookout.Drive in camp,safe dockage, access to 3 lakes with bays and islands to stay out of the wind if needed and a short drive to Lac Seul if you want to take a day trip. www.frograpidscamp.ca"
1520902,tackleman,2013-01-07 22:02:00,444,"take a look at south bay on gullrock, she has 3 cabins, so i think she may have openings in June but it is a great lake for kids to fish, lots of walleye and fishing is good off the dock too. she has paddle boats for the kids and a relatively good beach for swimming. prices are reasonable for this area and she has a good fish house. for a kid who loves to fish, there should be no problem with him catching a pile of fish."
1521037,Babamel2,2013-01-08 10:36:00,414,"I hope you have a great time with him. International Boarder crossings are very concerned about child trafficing. Make sure you have adequate documentation from both parents that it is ok for you to take him to canada.I would include in the letter, where you are going, how long you plan to stay and maybe even notorize the signatures. I would hate to see the trip end at the boarder with you not being able to take him across.Best to you."
1521138,Mudpuippy,2013-01-08 14:10:00,23,Thanks for all the suggestions.....wonderful group we have here.
1521148,Stu,2013-01-08 14:30:00,472,"I took my son on his 1st trip when he was 9. We stayed at Tall Pines on Wabaskang, but there are several other nice resorts on the lake too. Your grandson is a lucky young fellow to have a grandpa like you. Please let us know how your trip goes. Good luck - Stu"
1521368,LOW1,2013-01-09 08:42:00,2828,And include in the letter a telephone number for both parents.I cross with our kids about four times a year and am asked for the letter about 60% of the time.
