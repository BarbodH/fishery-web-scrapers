Its me, my daughter, and my fishin buddy of 30 years. His son got promoted, now has to work, so can't go. Only cabin on lake - Lake trout, smallies, and pike. http://gatewaynorthoutfitters.net/flyin_dogfly.html Never been to this lake before but have used this same outfitter for 10 years and always happy with trips. If interested give me a call for details Jeff (812) 480-4878"
