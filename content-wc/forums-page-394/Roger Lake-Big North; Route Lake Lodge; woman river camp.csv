We are looking at a few but the Roger Lake Fly in Outpost is the most compelling at this point. If someone has been there if you can please give me some highlights/lowlights of your trip i would greatly appreciate it. we are looking at going the 2nd week in July. 2 dads and 6 kids all 16 and under. Looks like a great place. Also, the 2 other lodges we are looking at are Route Lake Lodge which is appealing and Women River Camp. The week we spend in canada is easily the highlight of every year. You guys know how cool that is to take your kids - words don't do it justice. thanks. would be great if anyone was willing to chat with me for a few minutes. i need to pull the trigger this week."
