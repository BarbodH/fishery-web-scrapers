1525171,jWN,2013-01-17 16:44:00,62,"What lake/port would you recomend if you wanted to take trip on a house boat but fishing was 1st priority. My experiance in Canada have been nearly exclusive to Northern Manitoba, I am sure I have seen some of the best fishing so I expect this trip not to be to that level but I am sure some are better then others and at times can compare soe what. The reason why I am looking this direction is I think it will be my dads last trip and would like to have my sister and her family involved also. They are lets say non fisherman so a house boat can help with the non fishing time I think. I have limited knoladge of the lakes that are in southern Ontario. So any feed back is appreciated."

1525235,zeebee,2013-01-17 19:21:00,1144,"Lac Seul or LOW. If travel distance can be rationalized, Lake Tobin would be a great trip and possibly the best fishery of the three.http://www.aurorahouseboats.com/"
1525591,WalleyeWally28,2013-01-18 16:12:00,298,Check out www.whitewingresort.com. They have two nice houseboats that they park in the middle of the best fishing in the NW/SW sections of Lac Seul.

1525646,Lonefisherman,2013-01-18 19:14:00,13,There may be several outfitters that provide excellent fishing from a houseboat all across North America and Canada. I have fished Lac Suel from a houseboat many times with WhiteWing Resort near Ear Falls. They can provide you with excellent service and the fishing is awesome. We usually have gone the first week of August. The Walleye fishing has always been awesome. If you want to shoot me an e-mail can tell you more about our experience. [email protected]
1525703,KTroller,2013-01-19 00:59:00,237,"If the extended family is not big into fishing you might want to consider a drive to location where the fishing is good but that allows for driving to scenic, historic or shopping areas rather than having to remain on a houseboat during the times not spent fishing. Just offering it up as an alternative. Of course a houseboat might be perfect if when not fishing you're wanting to spend time isolated yet together."
1526085,fishguide1800,2013-01-20 09:20:00,84,"Not only is the fishing fantastic,but if your bringing people who dont want to fish much,they will definetly enjoy the hundreds of some of the best beaches anywhere around"
1526524,LOW1,2013-01-21 09:33:00,2828,"I would consider the Whitefish Bay area of Lake of the Woods. The Floating Lodges website in a previous post would be a good place to start. Tomahawk Resort also rents houseboats.Throw on a few kayaks for the nonfishermen-lots of islands, rock paintings, etc to explore. I am assuming you would be towing a fishing boat or two, so it's also convenient to run the nonfishermen into town so they can go up to Kenora for shopping, a movie, etc."
