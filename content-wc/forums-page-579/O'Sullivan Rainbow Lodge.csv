1103878,Larry Mac,2009-05-10 19:01:00,530,"Hi Burdman, I have not personally fished O'Sullivan Lake but have read some great things about it. Do a search of this forum with O'Sullivan Lake as your key words. IMHO Mr. Bill Krejca is probably the most knowledgeable person on this topic. Look up his posts they are full of good info. Have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1103913,Bill Krejca,2009-05-10 21:04:00,6107,"LM, Thanks for the vote of confidence! Burdman, I am not an expert on O'Sullivan (nor on anything else!). I have shared info on it on WC, and would be happy to share with you. Fire away. We will be there starting July 11, for the 4th year, when are you going to be there? Bill Krejca"
1103924,Mich_Fisherman,2009-05-10 22:33:00,292,"Burdman, Our group fished O'Sullivan for 8 years, but we are taking a break this year and trying a fly-in. Our trips were always in June. We stayed at the camp up the river at O'Sullivan Outfitters. Much of our success was pulling bottom bouncers with crawlers/harnesses for the larger fish. Our group of 6 or 8 fishermen always caught some fish between 28-30"" with the average fish being 19-20"". Catching a limit was never a problem fishing the wind blown bays and the wind blown points or the mouth of the river. Our first year we were very successful pulling cranks in the lake and the river but subsequent years we were not as successful. The biggest fish every year came on crawlers. We did fish minnows.... but never any size using them. Marginal success using plastics with jigs. A great lake with alot of terriffic structure. You will have a blast. Good luck and be safe."
1104412,Burdman,2009-05-12 14:22:00,11,Should be arriving same day. Would like to discuss locations and tactics. Have you done much with the Lake Trout? Last year was the first year I missed since 1985. I enjoy talking about the place. What cabin will you be staying in? Just 2 months to go
1104434,hawks_rule,2009-05-12 15:23:00,115,"Burdman, I am part of the same party as Bill, we don't typically target trout but one of the group caught one by accident. We can share some walleye ideas with you for sure. I think we are in the blue cabin #7 I believe, Bill can probably confirm or give you the correct information. Look forward to chatting with you and share a few beers if you are so inclined."
