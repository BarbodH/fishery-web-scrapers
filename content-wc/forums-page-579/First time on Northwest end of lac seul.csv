I recommend Sawmill Bay, we've always caught larger fish here instead of the sanctuary or mouth. The fish are shallow, 15 feet being the deepest i've fished at that time. Gary will give you lots of pointers if you need them. Find a point and the Eyes will be there, Lac Seul is amazing!"
1104720,Guest,2009-05-13 11:31:00,0,Dress warm and Pat and Gary will get you pointed in the right direction. Sawmill will be your best bet. They will get you a map and go over it with you and get you to the right places. You will have fun. Dress warm.
1104765,Guest,2009-05-13 13:55:00,0,"I am looking for a place to go for a few days in June (25th-29th) with my wife and 17 year old son. We are not choosy at all, and we can either bring a boat or rent one up there. We have not fished up north before, but we are both pretty decent anglers. Anyway, I put out a feeler with some good friends that I thought would be ""in the know"", and one of them told me that he knows a guy from Knoxville, Ia., that goes up to Lac Suel, that might know of a place. I wonder if that guy is you! If so, I just talked to him and he was going to try to contact you tonight. He has moved down to Lake of the Ozarks and his name is Jeff B. If you are ""him"", what a small world this has become! I just happened on this forum while doing a search."

Weve always fished in front of the sancuaries.we may scoot over to sawmill this year. See you up there."
1104872,Knoxabilly,2009-05-14 00:09:00,225,"Hey Iowa guy, Unfortunately that guy is not me my name just happens to be Knox. I'm from Des Moines originally. I would definitly recommend Lac Seul for you and your family. The fishing is amazing and it honestly doesn't take a lot of skill to catch them there! And Likewalleye- Do yourself a favor and at least motor down to sawmill one day. The fishing down there is amazing, we've always caught our fish shallower there and tend to be larger. Seems like you catch a lot of numbers in the sanctuary and in front of it but never the size. Good luck to ALL!!! How is Timberlodge? I always see their boats toolin around and I like their location."
