Boundary Dam is now full to capacity, and they are spilling water from Boundary thru the diversion channel into Rafferty, as well as down the Souris river. I am guessing that Boundary is up about 5 feet, maybe 6, and lots still coming in, but being diverted back out. Rafferty is getting something like 50 cubic metres per second(about 13,200 US gal per sec.) from boundary, so the ice at the east end is breaking up. Lots of water also coming down the Souris river from the west, which will end up in Rafferty as well. Hopefully we will get the 3 metres of water they are predicting. They have got the docks at Boundary set in properly to match the new level, so it should be good for the May 2nd Walleye tourney. oldblue2008"

1100359,oldblue2008,2009-04-26 21:01:00,313,"Was out there this morning to check on water leves, ice and watch the pelicans. Rafferty has come up probably 6 feet and is close to full level. They are letting some out from the little gate by the pumphouse. Lots of water still coming from the souris, judging by the flow at Weyburn. Fair amount of open water by the dam, but still lots of rotten ice. Was not up to the docks today. This week is supposed to be relatively cool, so no guarantees of all the ice being off by next weekend. Will try and get out to the docks tomorrow to see what it is like there. oldblue2008"
1100471,oldblue2008,2009-04-27 11:07:00,313,"Was out to the boat launch this morning. should be able to launch this weekend. Still some rotten ice out in the main part of the resovoir, but should/may all be gone by Saturday. This weeks forecast is not real great, supposed to be windy as well, so that should help getting rid of the ice. The reefs will be covered so caution is advised. docks are sort of in/out of the water right now, so not sure if they will be in place or not by the weekend. The cement ramp is 2/3's in the water, so launching should be better than last year. haven't been out to Boundary for the past 10 days or so, but it is full and still overflowing into Rafferty. Docks are in place. both places may have floating debris with the high water levels. oldblue2008"

1100945,oldblue2008,2009-04-28 22:00:00,313,"not a problem, just leave a couple for me! Hope to be out there Saturday, if not I can fish whenever, only 7 miles to the launch, so it is handy oldblue2008"
1101741,oldblue2008,2009-05-01 11:35:00,313,"was out to have a look this morning, Friday. Docks are in, although not as far as they could be, but then, if the water comes up more, they don't need to be in any farther. Water at the end of the north dock is about 30 inches deep. There are rocks in that area under water, due to the high water levels so be careful. Probably best to back straight out 50 feet or more before doing anything else. Keep in mind the 2 ??? reefs that will now be underwater, along with the rocky points. Have a safe one! All the ice is gone. oldblue2008"
1101784,skeeter 1880,2009-05-01 15:50:00,157,oldblue2008 Thanks for the updates. I will be with a couple buddies in a 1785 Yar Craft with a 115 Yamaha. If you see us give us a wave.
1101841,oldblue2008,2009-05-01 20:43:00,313,"If it is as windy tomorrow as it was today, it won't be real nice out there. They are saying 25 km/hr out of the north, NW or about 15 mph, maybe not as bad as today. rafferty had some 3 ft + rollers on the east end and Boundary was rocking as well."
1105101,pilli1k,2009-05-14 20:55:00,1,I went out to Boundary on May 8th and managed to catch two walleyes (2lbs and 3lbs) and and large mouth (2 1/2 lbs) at the far South end. The only thing they were biting on was a pink and black jig anything else they seemed to ignore. I had tried Rafferty the weekend before but only managed to catch a small jack. I'll be trying Alameda reservoir next week so any suggestions on where to fish from the shore for either of these three would be appreciated. Thanks.
