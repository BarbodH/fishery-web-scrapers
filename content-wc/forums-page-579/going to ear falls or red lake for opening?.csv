1105050,teddi,2009-05-14 16:18:00,349,there is a severe winter storm watch out for the area for friday thru saturday. upto 10 inches of snow possible and poor driving conditions. this is not a joke. check with enivormental canada for weather warnings for the area.
1105054,Moondog,2009-05-14 16:38:00,362,"Thanks, Teddi........bummer. At least we won't be coming thru there until Monday. Hopefully by then it will have melted or been plowed. Is there a road condition phone number so we can check?"
1105059,teddi,2009-05-14 16:56:00,349,it should be melted by sunday. the worst is going to be friday thru saturday morning. i am going to be there friday nite so i should have a poor trip up. i guess just drive slow and careful
1105099,Tonyo,2009-05-14 20:38:00,212,good thing I'm not going to be traveling this week. We will be leaving in 2 weeks from today. Hope the snow and cold are on their last legs for everyone up north. Good luck to you guys this weekend. TonyO.
