1105092,guidedfishing,2009-05-14 19:47:00,531,"Yup thats the one they mean, much nicer since they paved the river road along the Kami, the OPP watch it pretty close on the speed. and I have seen the Ministry setup up a check point more than once were 130 connects to 61 checking fisherman on the way back. good luck GF"
1105345,MGretz,2009-05-15 19:55:00,4,"FYI .. I have been driving from Iowa to Ignace for the past 15 years or so. First 10 years was through Int. Falls. Since then Thunder Bay. I concur that Thunder Bay is a lot more enjoyable .. short, if any, wait at the crossing, better scenery, less traffic, etc. I don't plan on ever going back to the Int. Falls route.7 days and counting!!!Mike"
1104608,JJJMN,2009-05-13 06:56:00,153,For years we have driven to Sturgeon Lake in NW Ontario from Minneapolis going up the north shore via Thunder Bay. On the Computer this is 559 miles. But the computer shows 503 miles going via Fort Frances. Question is how are the roads from Fort Frances up to Ignace. Route show's 11 Hwy to Turtle River Road (622) going north to 17 Hwy and into Ignace. Any recommendations? If given the choice I'd rather drive the extra 50 miles if it saves me a trailer tire or worse yet an axel. Thanks
1104649,Fishoil,2009-05-13 08:48:00,1277,"The roads through Pigeon River are better. When we go through International Falls we take 11 east to 622, then go north to 17 and east to Ignace. The past couple of years we have began crossing at Pigeon River because of the better roads and quicker crossing times. Just make sure you take the shortcut right after you cross the border instead of going all the way to Thunder Bay. You can pick up a free map showing it at Rydens just before you cross the border if you're not familiar with it."
1104654,Lovetofish,2009-05-13 09:03:00,458,Your suppose to be working.
1104667,JJJMN,2009-05-13 09:33:00,153,"I am working, A Little anyway. Ya, Mainly working on Planning the Trip. You should be working too!"
1104674,Lovetofish,2009-05-13 09:52:00,458,"LOL I was referring to Fishoil, but I guess the work thing pertains to you too. Both of you will be on the road Friday while I sit here for another 8 weeks. I sent you a PM about your roads. Fishoil hit it right on the head. Fishoil, I'm having some problems with my email. I'll have it fixed yet today."
1104738,plumberjoe,2009-05-13 12:40:00,54,We like the Pigeon River crossing. We have crossed at International Falls but it can take alot longer to get across. We're leaving for Sturgeon Fri. morning can't wait.
1104754,JJJMN,2009-05-13 13:14:00,153,"Thanks for the feedback. I hadn't thought about the time to get thru customs. Our routine has been about the same over the past 17 years. Grand Portage Casino and hotel, Gas station has been about the only change. Nice to have a little competition on gas prices so close to the border. I think we'll stick with Pigeon River. We also take the shortcut and don't go into Thunder bay. Hope you all have a great time. Rain or shine it's always a great trip."
1104772,Fishoil,2009-05-13 14:23:00,1277,"I AM working. Why do you think it took so long for me to see this? I was wondering about your e-mail, I sent you a couple and hadn't heard back. OK, I admit it I'm not working real hard today or tomorrow. ;-)"
1104779,Catman59,2009-05-13 14:57:00,345,"Ditto on Pigeon River crossing. Its farther than IFalls , but takes about the same amt of time. The crossing is usually very quick. I also grab my licenses at the Ontario welcome center right after you get through customs. It saves time and they take plastic."
1104782,Lovetofish,2009-05-13 15:09:00,458,All three of you are going this week? Hope there's some beer left for me in July.
