1104428,Guest,2009-05-12 15:09:00,0,but rebates ARE available by mail - got mine the last two years - detailed receipts are the key
1104439,eyefanatic,2009-05-12 15:30:00,25,So if I send my GST tax in via mail I can get a refund? The only item that I would have is the bill from the lodge that I stay at. It is a standard lodge package and it does not include an American plan. (no meals included) Can I send this in via mail and get a gst tax refund? Is it easy to do? Why did they stop offering the refund to the people at the duty free stores?
1104545,GNO,2009-05-12 21:05:00,153,"It has to be a packaged trip. Lodging only stays do not qualify. Cabin, boat, and meals or guide or ect. would qualify. The camps are elgible to do this for you if they choose and teh package qualifies. We do it for all of our guests for the packages that qualify. My guess for changing the rules on the rebate and convenience to do it at the border is to save money. Make it more difficult and less people will apply for it. Just lucky it is only on your vacation and not everything you buy living North of the border."
