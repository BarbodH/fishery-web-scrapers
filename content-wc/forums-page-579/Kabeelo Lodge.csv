For all of you seasoned fly in fishermen, any advice on what to pack and how to pack will be greatly appreciated. As for the lodge, have any of you fished with them and what lake did you fish? Sincere thanks and appreciation for any information you can share. Have a great summer and good luck on the water."

The furniture is awesome. You will see colors of green that you have never seen before. Don't worry about the fishing. The pilot and staff will put you on fish. When you are as remote as Kabeelo lodge the fishing pressure is minimal. They used to have a sign at their dock, ""no fishing"". the had a 'pet' northern that they used to feed. As far as what to bring; just do a search here. Everyone will say bring clothes for 32 degrees to 90 degrees, a great rainsuit, the best bug spray, a camera. Pack lite for the fly out. Canned beer, not bottles, and minimize tackle; jigs should suffice on a fly out. The fishing will be very simple, fun and easy."
