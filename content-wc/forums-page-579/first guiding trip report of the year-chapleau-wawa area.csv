The water temperature is 40 degrees and cold. We caught 9 smallmouth bass and 5 pike. 7 of the bass were over 17 inches. Of those 7 bass 2 were 19 3/4 inches. I caught one of the 19 3/4 inch bass.(my personal best so far) Of the 5 pike 2 of them were over 30 inches. I also caught one of the pike over 30 inches.(not my best but still good) Some of the pike still haven't spawned yet so we realesed all of our pike. We were using bobbers with large minnows. We set the minnow 2 feet deep and was fishing in about 4 feet of water in a small bay with a little stream flowing in. We fished for about 1 1/2 hours and the guys had a great time. Yesterday 2 of our guest caught 2 pike over 34 inches and several under 30 inches. They were using spoons and reeling slow and most of the pike hit near the boat after they stoped reeling and jigged the spoon up and down.(a trick my dad told them after their first day when they missed a few fish) If anybody wants any reports for fishing, water temperaturs, and weather for the Chaleau / Wawa area let me know. We just got our satlite internet set up so the days of the radio phone are gone. If you get bored with school go fishing- youngcanadianguide"
