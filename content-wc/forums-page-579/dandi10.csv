1104834,joeman79,2009-05-13 18:43:00,417,google ontario beer store and u can get a good idea. I think duty on a case of beer is 8.00 I think we paid 36-40 bucks a case for beer last year.
1104836,LIKEWALLEYE,2009-05-13 18:56:00,70,Joeman is right around 40 $ u.s. A case. But you should be able to cross with 1 case per person. I do it every year and no problems
