1105274,jarheadjohn,2009-05-15 13:00:00,3,"44"" caught on a 6"" Storm stickbait. What a ride on a medium action casting rod and small abu reel! Luckily I had plenty of help from other boats in our group - even the muskie net was not big enough. Once we got her landed, the lure was not attached to anything but the net. Really don't think you hook the big ones - they just bite and don't let go! Got to find the video my son took but mute the volume for obvious reasons. Only one week to go before I get another shot at another one - hopefully a flyline this time!"

1103373,boyd,2009-05-08 08:54:00,2,"While fishing for walleye I hooked one and when I started to bring it in all of a sudden it felt like a much bigger fish. When I finally got the fish to the surface I saw that a large northern had the walleye T-boned, it refused to let the walleye go so I said to my friend get the net and lets see if we can net it. I then worked the fish to the boat and we netted it and brought it into the boat. The northern did not let go of the walleye until I picked it up out of the net. The northern was 40"", the biggest I ever caught. Both the northern and walleye were released and both swam away. The walleye did have a few holes in it, but I am sure it made it.Locopoco"

Just a huge head. Got it to the side of the boat and it just laid there. Too big for our walleye net and as we tried to grab it......it spit the walleye and leisurely rolled and slowly dove.
