1103077,Tonyo,2009-05-07 05:25:00,212,"Just a quick note, we used to cross on Saturday morning but have learned it is much easier to plan your trip around the long wait times. We now go through the border on Friday late afternoon so we can be in Dryden BEFORE dark. We just stay over night at the Holiday Inn Express. This leaves us with just a couple of hours drive time to Gullrock Lake from their. We can usually cross in about 20 to 30 minutes time. That's all 4 trucks and boats. Take all of the advice already given and you will have no trouble at the border. Enjoy your trip. TonyO"
1103223,Guest,2009-05-07 14:38:00,0,"When crossing the boarder your vehicle will be guided through a handful of lanes (like a bank drive through). The customs official will then stick his/her head out of the window and want to ask a few questions. Just shout 2 big Macs and a happy meal and zoom away. They work long hours and appreciate the humor. Some of them are just crabby and no matter how hard you try to lighten them up, they still want to mess with you. They might get nosy and want to look in your vehicle. Just about the time the approach the driver side window, pull up another 10 feet. Do it again and again. Cracks them up every time. If they ask you to pull over to one of the inspection areas, just tell them I'm in a hurry - I'll tell you all about it on the way back. They're professionals and should understand. I'll provide more boarder tips when I get out of prison."
1103308,nitroman,2009-05-07 22:01:00,368,"The first question is always ""where you guys headed?"" Just reply ""Canada.... DUH!"" That always get's a chuckle out them."
1103320,wiggle,2009-05-08 05:13:00,400,"First, have all paperwork ready for them when you drive up. Answer their questions truthfully and quickly. Only answer their questions and don't offer them any more info. They will ask where you are headed, tell them the resort and the town you are going to or out of. Don't wear sunglasses, don't have the radio on, make sure all windows of the vehicle are down on the drivers side of the vehicle, don't have topper windows locked, make sure everyone is awake, if your driving a diesel, turn it off(you probably know that anyway), no live bait unless in commercial bedding. If you follow all of this advice, you should have no problems at all. FYI, same goes for coming back into the U.S. Brad"
1103390,JinxCanada,2009-05-08 09:53:00,1306,thank you for that. it's nice to know we are appreciated sometimes....
1103391,JinxCanada,2009-05-08 09:55:00,1306,best advice is always be truthful. if you declare somethign and it is prohibited the worst that will happen is you will lose it. the worst that will happen if you do not declare it cause you were unsure fi you should will be jail/fines/prosecution.and btw..when the nice officer asks you if you have any weapons or firearms... PLEASE DO NOT REACH FOR ANYTHING!!! just answer the question. TIA
1104368,tilldawg,2009-05-12 11:53:00,55,What papaerwork can we do ahead of time? Is it something we can download or do we get it at the border?
1104578,wiggle,2009-05-13 04:56:00,400,The paperwork I referred too was your passports. Everyone needs a passport book or passport card. Brad
1102891,tilldawg,2009-05-06 10:26:00,55,This will be my first time doing a border crossing by car. Have flown in for past trips. Will be doing a week long drive-in trip this time. So we will have food and gear. I know we are planing to get persishable food in Canada.Any advice on making it easier to get through customs at International Fall/Ft. Francis would be appreciated. We will going through about 11 am on Saturday. Anything we can prepare ahead of time to make it easier?Thanks
1102897,Guest,2009-05-06 10:57:00,0,"Just answer the questions truthfully and maintain eye contact with the agent in the booth. Declare your fillet knives as weapons. If there is a bear coming, you may need it. If you have a lake map, lay it on the dash so it is readable through the windshield. That way, the agent knows where you're going before he asks."
1102898,jigman 2003,2009-05-06 11:01:00,981,"Bring your patience and leave the attitude behind, especially at 11:00 a.m. on a Saturday. Have your passports ready, answer truthfully, everyone in the vehicle should remove their sunglasses and don't have hat brims tilted down."
1102928,v-bay gord,2009-05-06 12:39:00,3168,"I have sometimes found that if you have an itemized list of items you are bringing with you it seems to convey to the border agent that you are sincere about not trying to hide anything. I would only bring it out if asked specifically that question. A list of the major items (ie beer, liquor, cigarettes, some food items, etc.) might be worthwhile putting together while you are on the long drive.....if nothing else, it will remind you what you forgot! Throw in any confirmation letter you might have received from your outfitter....won't hurt."
1102939,IaDave,2009-05-06 13:22:00,476,Good advice- I also put the truck in park so it doesn't seem like you are in a big hurry.
1102941,jswinter40,2009-05-06 13:25:00,127,Doesn't hurt to look decent (shave) and nobody likes a comedian at the border.
1102967,Guest,2009-05-06 14:53:00,0,"All good pieces of advice. Let me add, 1) Read the info on the web that tells you what you can bring in and not, and then follow it to the letter. Sneaking in a extra bottle of booze or a six-pack may give you a feeling of being an outlaw or that you saved a few bucks vs buying it in Canada, but the delay in having your car totally unpacked and paying the fine is not worth the money you might save and if you want to feel like an outlaw, just buy a Harley. 2. Have your passport out and in hand when you pull up. Know the lodge your going to stay and and the exact dates of your stay and provide those when asked. 3. If you have anybody under 18 along without both parents, then have a noterized letter from the missing spouce(s) that give you permission to take the child out of the country. It's the law, so follow it. I have traveled to Canada with my youngster since they were small and the second I produce the kids passports and norterized letter, the Custom Officers lights up and I am greenlighted ahead. The like people that follow the rules Speaking of that, follow the stop signs/lights exactly until your motioned to move forward. You show signs of being in a hurry or nervous and that is one of the reason they have to ask you for a detailed look at your vehicle. 4. In cars that have tinted windows, offer to open the doors so that all can be seen. Plan for that, so don't pile stuff on the left side of the car that interferes with opening the door. I know one year I heard of people that had their rods laying right next to the sliding door in a van and when the officer opened the door, one of the rods had it tip busted off. 5. As said, be clean shaving, and have a pleasant attitude. Remember, the officers are doing their job and their job is to protect the citizens of the their country (same for the US Customs Officers). We complain vigorously about how terrorist could get into this country, and yet a day latter we complain that it took more than a minute to get through customs. Well duh, I really doubt if terrorists have signs that say ""I have come to kill you"" on their foreheads. Customs officers (on both sides of the border) have a thankless job, nobody tells them they are doing a good job, they will only here about their performance if, God forbid, they make a mistake. So as you work with them, be courtious and thank them, they will appreciate it. So, simply follow the rules, be polite and remember, the US and Canada are two of the greatest countries in the world, so while it make take a minute to get through customs, enjoy the moment and while its happening, just think of what it was like to go from East Germany to West Germany not that long ago. It was impossible, so the delay of a few minutes to help secure our borders is no big deal....IA Walleye"
1102980,Mr Walleye,2009-05-06 16:17:00,29,"I'd rethink crossing at I Falls at that time on a Saturday. If you can't avoid that time frame, plan on a LONG wait. 2+ hours is not unheard of. Been there, done that!"
1102999,joeman79,2009-05-06 17:54:00,417,"we are planning to cross the border around 7-8 pm on a saturday night what kind of wait times do u think we will be looking at. Also knowing exactley how much booze and cigarettes is a great deal. Last year we stopped at liquor store at Int'l Falls and had the case of booze in plain site and I told them exactley what we had, and don't say Yup or you betcha. Yes sir (Maam) Been thru the whole thing of complete removal of all possesions- suitcases gone thru."
1103017,Bill Krejca,2009-05-06 19:52:00,6107,"If you notice the official writing down the answers to the questions you are being asked, plan on a delay; this may mean you'll be asked to show what's in the vehicle/trailer. As long as you are truthful, and do not exceed quotas, etc, you'll be OK. Bill Krejca"
