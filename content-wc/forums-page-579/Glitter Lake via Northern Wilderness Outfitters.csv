Does anyone have any experience with this lake that they care to share? As a trade, our group has traveled to Holly, Carillon, and Lil Shab. Thanks."

While their cabins may not always be as "" nice"" as let's say Rusty Meyers they are always clean, dry and their boats stay in good condition even in Sept when we go up. I am sure they will take good care of you and don't forget to ask them for some fishing spots, I am sure they will be more than willing to help you! After all what is better for business than a happy group catching lots of fish? Good Luck and let us know how you do.Dick"

1104517,Guest,2009-05-12 19:44:00,0,"Actually it was two years ago already. Our group was at Lil Shab the last two years. We did however spend two years at Carillon. Carillon was a great lake with a nice cabin up on a hill overlooking the lake. Walleyes were abundant but of normal size nothing over 20"" for us. Although we went in August, most eyes came on jigs and crawlers and Gulp. Biggest pike if I remember was in the mid 30 inch range. If you would like, email me at [email protected] and I can provide a marked map. We will probably see you at NWO as we are leaving for Glitter on July 12th too."
