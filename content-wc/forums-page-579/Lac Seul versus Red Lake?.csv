I ,ve got a cabin on Lac Seul and been fishing it for the last 20 years. Would you be willing to trade info? Or maybe trips? Post up here if you are interested."

Lots of good spots Let me check my map and I'll get back to ya with a PMAledit...just looked though previous posts and see if this helps at all..Try Points with weed lines, bays with access to deeper water for a start, there are some big northerns in that lake if you’re interested and they seem to like these spots. We've had reasonable luck taking the boat up to where the Chukuni enters in red, then upstream to the rapids, casting raps in those has worked, although jigs and minnows seem to be a better deal, also we've hit big northerns there too.Gets a bit crowded up there so maybe get there early, good walleye spot too.Colors in lures that have worked the best are natural colors, gold and black is my favorite, white and black would be next, green seems to work too.We usually use the 4"" rap but I'd vary it a bit and see what works for you.No real secret to the retrieve, cast upstream and reel fast enough to give the rap some action, kind of depends on how fast the river is.We use med action fast tip spinning rods with 8# test, being the old timer I still use stren blue, but have tried some of the newer lines like power pro with fair success.Weather to rough to fish?Here's where my short term memory loss is going to cause trouble, IF I remember right, you head out of the town of Red Lake to the Nugassor road, then down that for a few miles then take a left and you should end up going over a bridge that spans the Chukuni.Maybe someone can correct these directions if I'm wrong??Anyway, this is where we've had the best luck on the river.As you come up on the river it should be going from right to left in stream direction, going to the left side of the bridge you can walk down and fish from shore, short walk, maybe 50 yards or so max.From there you can cast the raps up into the rapids that start at the bridge, try and keep the lure from going deep, waters pretty shallow and you'll snag enough as it is.I get the feeling the walleyes are facing upstream and nailing the bait fish as they come down the rapids.Fan cast the rapids and you should hit them at different spots.Other wise, go to the right of the bridge on the side before crossing the bridge and walk down the trail about maybe a mile or so, you'll come across several places to fish from shore at, pretty popular spot so it'd be hard to miss any of the spots.There we still casted upstream, not sure why but it just seemed to work better, but try different approaches and see what happens.Same baits here too.The bridge site is a great place to go if the weather is too poor to get a boat out.It seems you can hit this spot to late in the year and fishing will be spotty, 3 weekend in Sept is when we usually go, we went the 4th week once and found few walleyes in this part of the river, guy at the bait store mentioned they become scare in the river very late in the season.We've had some luck going downstream from the Chukuni campgrounds, maybe about three miles, you'll come to where the river narrows down and there's a island, fish the west side of the island, casting or jigs and minnows work there.Nothing of any real size there usually, but a good place to get shore lunch from.That doesn't work, try off of Forestry Point and throw or troll some bigger stuff, like a husky jerk, bit tricky to troll but set out marker buoys and try zig zagging a bit, you'll either hit walleyes or a northern or two.And jigs and minnows will work there too...Bump up into the shallow waters for fish count, when you have enough of that wander out into deeper water and the fish count will prob go down, but they'll get bigger.Bouncing chartreuse or green jigs and minnows off the bottom or casting raps that are black and gold or black and white have always been go to baits for me.Our go to bait is the chartreuse or green jig, usually half oz (we fish during the late fall and the bigger fish are deep, 30-40 fow) at least depending on wind and how slow we can keep the boat.Have fun, it’s a big lake with lots of structure, use a planed attack versus just running from spot to spot as you can waste a lot of time just driving on that lake.I’ll try and remember a few more spots, but the lake is full of them, I’d pick a spot and work it from shallow to deep, live bait seems to always be the go to bait, so I’d try fairly decent sized minnows on a big hook jig and try to keep the jig about 4-6” off the bottom, helps keep them from getting snagged."
