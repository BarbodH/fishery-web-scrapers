1105214,Enid Elizabeth,2009-05-15 09:33:00,59,Weather report does not call for lots of snow here or to the north but at the moment it is snowing pretty hard. No flying for now. Check my blog for updates and pictures. Viking Blog or call your outfitter.
1105253,teddi,2009-05-15 11:26:00,349,weather network is calling for 15 to 20 cm more by saturday morning. not very nice but it could be worse i guess.
1105293,tackleman,2009-05-15 15:23:00,444,"I just shovelled my front steps, have 5 inches and it is still a whiteout condition. all the highways are closed by the police."
1105299,Golden Eagle,2009-05-15 15:35:00,2642,"You've gotta be kidding about snow. Whoops, you're right. I just looked out my window at the Balmer Annex. Sure is pretty and I'll bet we have great fishing around Sunday. I'm willing to wait until we can fly safely."

1105331,dewyg,2009-05-15 18:26:00,1006,light snow in kenora right now it melts when it hits the ground
1105344,Glenman12,2009-05-15 19:43:00,762,I feel bad for the guys going up that way for the opener..but thats why we dont do it anymore..weather is too iffy..heck its even iffy the first week of June..hopefully it will stop soon so the planes can get in the air
1105348,rockpt,2009-05-15 19:59:00,589,"Is this a record snowfall for mid-May? Definitely don't know what you'll get in NW Ontario early in the season or late. Mid-Oct. 2006 on LOTW we got hit with that three day snowstorm that froze cabin pipes and made fishing impossible. Keeps things interesting up there, no?"
1105363,v-bay gord,2009-05-15 21:13:00,3168,"Apparently this type of weather is not abnormal for mid May here in NW Ontario. It is a crap shoot whether the cold weather systems win out over the warm weather systems this time of year. While it may not be statistically abnormal, I think the fact that the road guys have there snowplows stored for the summer means that we don't really expect any amount of snow this time of year. I feel sorry for the people trying to fish, and the folks looking after them. The forecast improves somewhat over the weekend, so all is not lost."
1105365,Tonyo,2009-05-15 21:49:00,212,Another good reason we wait until the first week of June to go. Still a chance of this in early June but we haven't experienced really cold weather in about 10 years. It was just cold in the morning a day or so and by the end of the week it was in the 80's every day. Go figure. Good luck to all who have traveled north for the opener. I hope you all find your destination without any troubles and you leave a few for the rest of us that are coming up in a couple of weeks. TonyO.
