1103857,Guest,2009-05-10 17:18:00,0,"Good news, the ice has just our left bay this afternooon. The main section of the lake is still white looking but it will go soon. I would say we are about four days ahead of last year. Wishing you all a good fishing season!"
1103911,Glenman12,2009-05-10 20:52:00,762,For what its worth...the ice on Cedar Lake in Perrault Falls went out on the 5th..thats about 30 miles or so south of Ear Falls...granted Cedar is only 6500 acres but its 8 days earlier than last year
1103971,eyefanatic,2009-05-11 07:22:00,25,I am hoping that the water warms up a little quicker than last year. We are going to be up there the sec. week of June. Last year at this time the water was 42-50 degrees F depending on where you went. If the ice goes out 4-8 days earlier than last year it would help a little. I just hope that we get some nice warm weather to move things along. As things warm up it will be interesting to hear progressive water temps as we move into spring. Good luck to all for fishing opener.
1104276,Guest,2009-05-12 07:59:00,0,Hi Eyefanatic! I too will be on lac seul the 2nd week of june. Do you stay at a base camp or do the houseboat thing? My fam ily and friends have been going up there since 1982.
1104688,Guest,2009-05-13 10:24:00,0,Talked to Dave at Whitewing this morning. He said the ice went out on Lac Seul yesterday.
1104915,Guest,2009-05-14 07:16:00,0,"anyone have any ideas about water temp and the pre and post spawn timing, iam ona planned outing on lac suel first week on june... is this going to be affected by the spaning?"
1105098,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-05-14 20:32:00,100,"The ice has been gone from the SE section for over a week now, and I was told the mid east area busted up in the last few days of high winds and driving rain. I have no idea about the central portion, but I'm sure that the ice there is finished as well, with this weather.Miserably cold here today!I hope that everyone has a great opener, and delicately handles those late spawners.We are about a week ahead of last year."
1102349,Guest,2009-05-04 15:51:00,0,"Looking at web cams & satellite photos, things are going fast!"
1102496,stumcfar,2009-05-05 07:32:00,451,Who has a website for a satellite photo that will show Lac Seul?
1102556,Guest,2009-05-05 10:34:00,0,"google MODIS today & use the ""usa3"" satelitte"
1103388,eyefanatic,2009-05-08 09:39:00,25,"Hey Guys... I have been checking out the web cams and it looks like things are beginning to thaw a little. Are there any locals out there that might be able to give us an update on Lac Seul? Thanks,"
1103520,Skywagon,2009-05-08 19:17:00,1106,Our home lake (40 miles south of Sioux Lookout) thawed out on Wednesday the 6th.
1103570,teddi,2009-05-09 05:41:00,349,snowing today and colder. i would say you are looking at 2 more weeks for the whole lake to be open
1103589,BenBeattie,2009-05-09 07:42:00,232,Definitely coming along but NOT ready yet. Opener could be okay.... maybe.
1103608,brwhite,2009-05-09 08:49:00,41,"So can anyone explain to an amateur what this means with respect to spawn, post spawn, pre summer, and summer peak periods and what to expect for someone coming up to Lost Lake/Hudson area the first or second week in June?"
1103776,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-05-10 07:21:00,100,"Things will be fine, and pretty much on schedule with last year. Walleyes are just entering their spawn, so by the 2nd week in June, they will be shallow and scattered through various spots in Lost lake.The sioux/hudson end is 90% ice free, so I imagine the main basin will break up within the next week."
1103792,jswinter40,2009-05-10 09:07:00,127,wasn't last year late ice out and water was a few weeks behind on normal standards throughout most of the summer with the highest water I have ever seen on LS? HOw is the water level?? I think this will be your main indicator on fishing spots.. Still early June would be shallow shoreline structure and weed lines (if any). 10-18 FOW maybe shallower IMO.
1099126,Tonyo,2009-04-21 21:43:00,212,I might have to change my vote for a little earlier than what I thought.
1099633,Guest,2009-04-23 18:12:00,0,go to www.fishredpine.com they have a web cam set up. It doesn't look pretty. Ice is thick
1099677,JDP,2009-04-23 21:37:00,1457,Thanks for the webcam link!
1100680,eyefanatic,2009-04-27 23:46:00,25,"Less than 3 weeks to opener! I am chomping at the bit! I believe that the ice out last year was somewhere around the 20th-23rd. (Depending on what section of the lake you call home) Are people still driving on the ice? I would think/hope that we should start to see the ice breaking away from shore within a couple weeks. +30"" is a lot of ice to melt. Does anyone know what section of LS normally has the first ice out? NW, SE? Thanks"
1100697,teddi,2009-04-28 05:27:00,349,north west [ear falls end]
1100725,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-04-28 07:05:00,100,"The ice is finally starting to leave the shorelines on the SE end. Black ice is starting to show through. Frog Rapids and The Iron Bridge are wide open(current, of course). Warm weather and lots of rainfall/wind predicted this week, still it's gonna be a miracle for the mid section, but I think that the SE end will be clear for opener, with the occassional ice berg....lolWalleyes should be in full spawn, and things may be a bit messy at times, so please handle all fish with care."
1101291,Guest,2009-04-30 07:13:00,0,www.sweetwatercruises.com has a live web cam on Pelican lake near Frog rapids. It looks like its getting nice & black. Though I'm assuming it will still be quite a while on the big lake.
1101316,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-04-30 08:06:00,100,"It's above zero, and raining today here is Sioux Lookout! Warmer temperatures forecasted for the next week, things are looking way better for opener!!!"
1101816,eyefanatic,2009-05-01 18:52:00,25,Thanks for the web cam jabs.
1102137,Guest,2009-05-03 18:48:00,0,The ice around the end of my dock is starting to melt here in Goose bay. There are small patches of water. Yesterday I tryed to get to Mckenzie Bay by going down Turkey creek by boat from the logging road. I only got as far as Cox lake and the boat would not break the ice. I did get to my cabin at the mouth of turkey creek by four wheeler and it was white ice as far as I could see. We have had high winds but it won't help much until the ice melts around the shore. The water has come up a little in the last week.
1094038,eyefanatic,2009-04-04 11:49:00,25,Any predictions for ice out this year? As we get closer to May any updates on the ice conditions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
1094265,fishman10,2009-04-05 11:06:00,226,"i am currently working in sioux lookout and let me tell you my friend, it is closer to january than april. this is one of the latest springs that i have seen in years. monday night forecast is -20. but the daytime temps are above 0 all week. the ice is 3 feet thick and driving a truck on it is no problem. ice out will be well into may, without question but i will keep you posted with up to date info."
1094545,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-04-06 08:45:00,100,"In April, it is usually thawing a bit day by day.....but it is making ice every evening. Walleyes are staging closer to spawning grounds, but they are going to have a longer than usual wait. I am booked solid for guiding right from May 16th on, and thank god we have moving water on the southeast end, as my options may be very limited. Unless we get some Florida like weather, driving rains and wind, it's gonna be a late one, especially in the central portion....again! Here's a clip from the run up to Chamberlain last spring; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4sxhRbFyIWe are all praying for an earlier spring!"
1094814,Skywagon,2009-04-07 05:44:00,1106,"I went ice fishing yesterday and dug holes in the area that I have been fishing all winter and just about ran out of auger length. Supposed to start getting above freezing during the day for the rest of the week. The snow has melted some on our lake and you can get around on a 4-wheeler now, if need be."
1096639,eyefanatic,2009-04-13 11:11:00,25,Thanks for the heads up guys! Sounds like there is some warm weather and rain on the way. That should help some.
1096646,Pakwash Lake Camp,2009-04-13 11:28:00,17,"Pakwash Lake Still has 2 feet of ice and snow. Lets hope the warm weather sticks this week. Yes we are down river, but we are hoping for ice free fishing opener too! Good Luck Lac Seul."
1097391,eyefanatic,2009-04-15 15:59:00,25,Has anyone kept a log of previous ice out dates?
1097394,Glenman12,2009-04-15 16:04:00,762,"Last year on Cedar Lake about 40 miles south of Lac Seul it went out on Tuesday, May 13th"
1098517,Glenman12,2009-04-20 06:39:00,762,"I just read that Howey Bay on Red Lake lost 6"" of ice in the last week. its down to 26"" and losing its density..this game from a blog on the Viking Island Resort website.."
1099124,joeman79,2009-04-21 21:36:00,417,Supposed to be 64 degrees farn. tommorow at Red Lake that oughta melt a little ice.
