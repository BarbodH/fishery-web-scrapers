Are all the crossing points congested?We will be crossing somewhere in North Dakota, where US-52 meets Provincial Highway 39.Thanks for any guidance you might have. I'm very excited about the trip as I have heard wonderful things about Lac La Ronge.Mr. Chris"

I think the long lines are more of a problem in the more populated areas. I had some friends that always crossed there on their way to Tobin. They claimed that they were always searched entering Canada and waved through coming home. I cross at Regway (north of Plentywood, Montana and have always just been asked a couple of questions and waved through going north. Coming home they have done a cursory check. This includes coming home on Sept 22nd last year. Good luck on your trip."
