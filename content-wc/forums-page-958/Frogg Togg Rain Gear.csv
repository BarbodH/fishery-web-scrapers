520468,Guest,2002-05-18 14:36:00,0,has anyone had any experience with this brand of rain gear? It is fairly affordable but is it sturdy?
520469,lobo1,2002-05-18 15:50:00,734,It is very very lightweight and you can not count on it for any warmth. Almost like a heavy soft paper towel material.I specifically ordered mine in a size or two bigger than I needed but on the third day of wearing the suit - the jacket split at the seam under the arm almost to the waist. Once repaired was good as new but a pain in the a55. I only wore it the one week in Canada and then one day since.I was in some heavy rains and stayed dry (before the split) but did wish I had my gortex jacket once it turned cold out.lobo

I had a seam pull apart on me too, so I contacted Frogg Toggs by E-mail and they sent me a new pair of pants with reinforced seams at no charge. They're lightweight and comfortable and the company stands behind their product 100%, no questions asked. I highly reccommend them."
