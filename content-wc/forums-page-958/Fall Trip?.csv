520490,slick2526,2002-05-19 14:28:00,290,Just wondering. If you could choose a place in canada to go for a fall walleye trip where would you go? Im looking to catch and release a trophy walleye. I could really care less on keeping them to eat. Also do you have any resorts to suggest? or any websites with information about lakes and resorts? thanks

520493,Guest,2002-05-19 17:02:00,0,"Try Tobin Lake and the Saskatchewan River at Nipawin,Saskatchewan. It has large numbers of trophy walleye and northerns. The end of Sept. to halloween would be a good time to go but dress warm, very warm. The largest walleye ever caught in Saskatchewan was taken in there and it was over 18 pounds and the largest northern from Tobin was over 38. The river section, that is within 1 mile of town, has all the facilities and lodging that you can want, with the regional park having good launching facilities. Tobin lake doesn't get anywhere near the pressure that the river section gets but be carefull of old timber in the lake. Tobin lake wasn't logged before it was flooded in the 60's but Coddette Lake on the other side of the second dam was, and is also known for large walleye but not the numbers that the North Saskatchewan river and Tobin Lake have. Check out the pictures in the 10 pound club under Tobin Lake or the North Saskatchewan river to see some of the walleyes that get caught there every year.Or do a search on the town of Nipawin to see what they have to offer."
520494,Walleye Wacker,2002-05-20 05:50:00,6,Last year four of us went to Manitoba and fished the Red River in the middle of October. We all caught Walleye over 10 lbs and two over 13. We fished three days and had many fish over 7 and saw at least 15 other fish caught by boats close to us that were trophy size. Fish from the dam in Selkirk north to the lake......IT IS AWESOME.
