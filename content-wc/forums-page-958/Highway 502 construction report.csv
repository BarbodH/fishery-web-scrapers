They were only working on the edges and haven't started resurfacing yet.Otherwise 502 is in the best shape I've seen it in 10 years. The potholes were already filled in (except one that sure enough I hit).East of Dryden two bridges are being repaired and have traffic lights. Highway 72 was in excellent condition."
