520214,Guest,2002-05-15 07:06:00,0,anyone been to Rand Thomas's canada outfitters out of Kenora before. Im going in July to Walleye lake. Just looking for some input on this place.
520215,Guest,2002-05-15 08:38:00,0,"A group of us went to Walleye Lake with Randy for 3 years running. We started at Norse Lake for a year, then did Walleye lake for 3 years, and now we head further north. Walleye lake is a productive lake for walleye, but we never caught anything over 21 inches. We did catch a lot of fish, however (a reasonable day would be 20 fish per man). The lake itself has 2 nice cabins (we never shared the lake with anyone because our group was large enough to fill both), and a short portage to little Walleye was productive. The pike action was similar to the walleye action: lots of fish, but not much over 30"". I recommend him; he's a great guy and runs a good outfitting service. Tell him the guys from Iowa State say hello."
520216,Guest,2002-05-15 11:37:00,0,what is the best gear and lures to take to Walleye lake for beginning of july for both walleye and northern
520217,Guest,2002-05-22 20:01:00,0,"We were at Walleye Lake in 1999...late June. Fishing was fantastic. The other poster is reasonably accurate. Lots of Northerns approaching 30, we pulled in one 34 incher, andsaw some with shoulders attack 18 inch walleye at the boat side. And, at least for us, 20 fish per man happened several times each day. Most were around 18 inches, but there were some in the 21 inch category. We didn't spend much time with small mouth.Absolutely a beautiful lake. Lots of Eagles, saw a bear, loons, etc. It was productive on hot days, windy days, morning, daytime or night.Rand ran a top notch campHave Fun"
