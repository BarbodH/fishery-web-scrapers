520420,Guest,2002-05-17 00:55:00,0,"Heading up to Canada to fish walleye. Fished this area before but never had much success. Contacted a local guide & he is willing to do trip. Gonna use hime for a few days. My question is (before I confirm the trip) is $180.00 us dollars per day outta line ? He provides bait/beverages/equipment & fishes ""till the cow comes home"".Is this a good rate ? There will be two of us fishing with him, so the cost is actually 90 bucks per man. Don't want to come off as a cheapskate, but I am on a budget & just want to be sure that I won't be ""over paying"" & hopefully get a return for my investment. I know that no guide in the world can be ""perfect"" but this guy does have a rep & is recommended by many."
520421,Guest,2002-05-17 05:15:00,0,"180.00 is a reasonable price for a well reputed independent (meaning not assoc with a lodge) guide, especially if they are supplying the boat. If you ever go down to Florida, you will standardly pay 350.00-400.00 for a small boat guide."
520422,Happy Landing Guide,2002-05-17 05:21:00,7,Very good price!!My question he must be new or not very good!!
520424,Guest,2002-05-17 06:02:00,0,That sounds like a very reasonable price. I have paid more for guides who didn't supply all the fixin's you described. I felt that price was fair.
520425,Northern Manitoban,2002-05-17 12:55:00,195,Good price some guys charge more.Myself i'm in the 120 to 150 ball park for guiding everything included.But with me there is really no travel time to fishing here.I'm surrounded by water.So thats why my rates are cheeper.Go for it.FISH ON.
520426,Guest,2002-05-17 23:03:00,0,Just spoke to my guy. His normal price is $300us per day. He's giving me a deal @ 180us per day because of my/our connection thru WalleyeCentral. Sounds like a good guy to me
