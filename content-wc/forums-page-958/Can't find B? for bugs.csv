520305,Guest,2002-05-20 17:20:00,0,"Yes, It really does work. I take B1 regularly as a preventative for neropothy due to diabetes. I could'nt figure out why I was the onlyone not getting bit last year. Well, after reading the latest posts I've come to the conclusion that it must be the B1. You can't take to much and Yes you will pee Y E L L O W......Remember eat a few and release a lot....."

I checked the archives and it was said that B1 was the vitamin, but I can't find it. Am I looking for the right stuff. If I am where have you found it.Thanks,Tim Blanchette"
520295,lobo1,2002-05-16 00:02:00,734,"Any health food store, drug store, walmart, kmart etc etc - just about anywhere except a gas station or 7-11 ! I have never tried it myself but good luck.If my lake thaws in time I don't think bugs will be an issue.lobo"
520296,Big Tim,2002-05-16 04:19:00,63,"B 1 is the right item to get. Got mine at Wal-mart, used it last year & all 4 of us were amazed!"
520297,phidelt157,2002-05-16 07:07:00,191,I'm confused....how does B vitamin help with bugs?
520298,Big Tim,2002-05-16 08:54:00,63,"Supposedly changes the aroma of your sweat. Bugs don't recognize you as food so they leave you alone. Start taking 1 piil a day at least 10 days before you go & 1 pill a day when you are in bug country. We had guys slapping all around us(4 guys)last year & none of us that took the b1 had any problem. Some guys suggest checking with your MD just to be safe. The only side effect I noticed is you pee yellow till you stop taking the pills. Pills are cheap, about $4 at wal-mart--enuff for 5 or 6 guys for 17 days. As long as the doc ok's it, why not?"
520299,phidelt157,2002-05-20 07:25:00,191,"pee yellow, eh? Sounds pretty normal to me, I'd rather pee yellow and any other color! Thanks for the help...."
520300,Big Tim,2002-05-20 07:28:00,63,"Not just yellow, I mean YELLOW!!"
520301,phidelt157,2002-05-20 08:57:00,191,eesh......
520302,jack,2002-05-20 12:38:00,17,"I wish these B1 pills, garlic and other remedies for bugs worked for me and my crew. The bugs just love me like a big juicy steak and as a result we go up in August or Sept when they not too many of the little critters around."
520303,Guest,2002-05-20 13:01:00,0,"You mean they dont work for everyone? I am just concerned about the black flies, By the time the (minnesota state bird) comes out most people in are party are not only bug proof but bullet proof as well lol!"
