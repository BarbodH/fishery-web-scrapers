520407,Guest,2002-05-20 14:28:00,0,Buy the beer at the Duty-Free on the US side and keep 'Canadian Guy' happy. Even the Bud(and probably the Miller) is brewed by LaBatt's in Canada. You just don't have to pay the Canadian taxes(unless you go over one case per person). At $13.00 (5 for $55) you can't do much better.Minaki-Bound.
520403,Guest,2002-05-20 15:34:00,0,Awww come on Rick....I love Americans...I just love Americans who spend some money in our great country better than the skinflints who carry everything over but the kitchen sink. I also like the ones best of all who respect our laws even though they may not agree with them.
520404,Guest,2002-05-20 16:37:00,0,Only 18 days away from cold canadian beer WOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! There is nothing stopping me now! Oh wait thats right THE BORDER! I need to find a beer store up there that will fedex me some Labatt Genuine Draft! Dang that stuff is good. Canadian guy whats your flavor of choice ??????
520405,Guest,2002-05-20 17:00:00,0,"Anything thats cold when I'm walleye fishing!! Blue,Crystal, Genuine Draft are all good beers. Stay away from the head banger stuff JH, if you are headed in that direction pick up the pure imported german brewed stuff at the LCBO. The bock beers are great and push 7.7.I've tipped a few of the Canadian ice beers and had a viscious hangover after only a few. Have a great trip ....."
520406,Rick,2002-05-21 06:57:00,226,"Due to our locations in the states, the guys in our group usually cross the border between 10:00p.m. and midnight and fly-out around 7-8:00 a.m. next morning. If you can point us to a beer store open during these hours, we'll be happy to buy your beer, but until then we'll continue to bring it with us.We also spend between $1,000 and $1,200 (US) per man on these fly-outs by the time we pay the outfitter for groceries and bait. If bringing a few extra cases of beer across the border puts us into your ""skinflint"" category, I guess that a label we'll have to live with.As to as your claim to love Americans, I'm reminded of a comment by W.C. Fields that goes something like: "" I like children....if they're cooked properly."""
520408,Guest,2002-05-21 10:21:00,0,Love Pickerel Lake. A lot of northerns and small mouth. Only fished it a couple of times. Do you know if there is any walleye in the lake.I've caught one but was fishing for northerns. I'll be in Minaki the first week of June. Coming up with 7 guys from Kansas City.(Paradise Cove) Say Hi Rob
520395,Guest,2002-05-21 14:21:00,0,"You best bring in your own miller lite because its hard to find girl beer in Canada.Its also hard to find a tutu, wine spritzers and gerbils."
520396,phidelt157,2002-05-21 18:04:00,191,wow
520391,Guest,2002-05-16 13:44:00,0,"Wondering how much beer if any can you take across the border. Nothing against the eh's but Miller Lite sure is good. If you take more than is accepted can you pay tax and still take what you have brought? Also, has anyone fished Pickrel Lake by Minaki. Great lake, no traffic and excellent fishing and wildlife. Respond kindly.Big Fish- no kiddin"
520392,Guest,2002-05-16 15:47:00,0,"You get to take a two-four per person eh. That's an American case. If you don't drink that fairy lite beer you still get 24 beers but get 48 lite beers worth of alcohol and taste (Sierra Nevada=5.6%, Miller lite= 3.2%). Instead, each person can transport 750 ml of wine or liquor.Good idea to ask first. Don't lie about it and definately bring in as much as you can. Its not cheap up there.swampwaffle."
520393,Guest,2002-05-16 16:40:00,0,one case or one bottle of liquor not more than 40 ounces per adult person are duty free! Now if you buy a case here(usa) for lets say $15.99+ tax 9%= $17.43 a case! You could in turn by a good a canadian beer like LGD for $35.00 canadian = about $23.00 american and avoid the duty on the $17.43 which will be about $8.00 making that case of water a grand total of $25.43!!! And have a smooth crisp 5% draft beer which is a great beer labatt genuine draft!! Thank you and have a good day!!
520394,Guest,2002-05-16 20:37:00,0,Are you an accountant or a tax planner?
520397,Rick,2002-05-17 12:23:00,226,"Beer: one case per person free. Up to 4 more per person and pay duty of about $9 Canadian per case. No more than total of 5 cases each. Can't say about the hard stuff. Just tell them that you have extra to pay duty on and you go inside to the cashier. They will ask what you paid per case in the states. Duty is based on what it cost in the US. We always give them the list and pay the toll. No big deal. By the way, while you are inside paying the duty, they will be outside going through your car. No big deal if you if you tell the truth and have nothing in the car to hide."
520398,Karl,2002-05-18 19:18:00,63,"fyi, at Intl. Falls they doubled the customs lanes (to four) and quadrupled the ""parking"" area set aside for vehicle searches."
520399,Guest,2002-05-19 08:39:00,0,"Locals like Americans who buy locally. When you ""go in"" to pay you also run the risk of getting the full treatment and getting held up. I'd love to be a border clerk and make a guy wait a half hour or longer to pay on a couple cases of beer.....it would be the patriotic thing to do."
520400,Guest,2002-05-19 12:27:00,0,"What about bringing beer back? How much is ""legal""?"
520401,Guest,2002-05-19 20:47:00,0,IF YOUR BRINGING BEER BACK. YOU SHOULD STAY LONGER.(U.S.A.1)
520402,Rick,2002-05-20 13:56:00,226,"Coming back once we were told by customs ""One liter of alcoholic beverage. Period."" He said it didn't matter if it was pure grain alcohol or beer. One liter.Two of us were bringing back about a 12-pack in the cooler and he nearly made us give up 6 cans. He let us go with the ""one liter only"" lecture. Note to Reply #6, Canadian Guy:If your overly-regulated beer stores were open for more reasonable hours, we wouldn't have to bring beer across the border. By the way, your obvious dislike of Americans is showing, again."
