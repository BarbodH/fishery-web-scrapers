520333,Guest,2002-05-20 08:49:00,0,There is no possible way they would have time to ask everybody those questions. There would be a line of cars from Ft.Frances to St.Louis Missouri!!!!!
520334,Guest,2002-05-20 15:04:00,0,"I am leaving St.Louis on the 24th and haven't seen a line yet, but when I do I'll let everyone know."
520331,Guest,2002-05-20 18:43:00,0,"WE ARE LEAVING 5/24/02 -- WILL BE CROSSING AT INTERNATIONAL FALLS -- HAD DUI 18 YEARS AGO -- DOESN'T SHOW UP ON MY DRIVING RECORD -- ARE THEY ASKING EVERYONE ABOUT DUI CONVICTIONS? -- IF IT DOESN'T SHOW UP ON YOUR DRIVING RECORD, IS IT BEST TO BE HONEST AND TELL THEM ABOUT IT OR WHAT?"

520336,Guest,2002-05-22 12:09:00,0,"Anybody out there that has time before their trip and a D.U.I. should apply for a permit to enter ahead of time. A guy in our group got one last year(first and only), made the mistake of stopping for pizza and beer after shooting trap. Its amazing the hoops you have to jump through to get one. He started the process in Feb. and just recieved his permit in mail Mon the 21st. They told him if his D.U.I. hadn't just been last year they would have given him a three year permit. Now he will have to reapply next year. But I'll tell you what, he sure is relieved to know he will get in for sure."
520325,Guest,2002-05-17 09:49:00,0,"We are leaving Sat the 25th if anyone crosses back across the border before then please tell us how things went.... we also have a ""criminal"" in our group"
520326,Geno,2002-05-18 05:37:00,91,"We crossed into Ontario at Ft. Erie (N.Y. State) on the 9th and came back through yesterday, no wait or problems, went right through. For those of you who couldn't make it up for the opener, you didn't miss a thing except for rain, wind, and snow. One particular day we had all three at the same time. The fishing was as slow as we've ever had, so it can only get better for the rest of you, good luck and don't worry about the boarder.Geno"
520327,Karl,2002-05-18 14:49:00,63,Just got back last night. No different than any other crossings over the last years. People worry too much. If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to worry about.
520328,Karl,2002-05-18 14:50:00,63,forgot to mention - I crossed at International Falls.
520318,Guest,2002-05-18 15:23:00,0,Greetings 157.....The ice is gone now and your trip is getting near............I'm watching the playout of all of your best laid plans..... Share all the details with the boys....This is better than Survivor.....Just remember 157 ....your post in the winter started the all time WC posts on a topic......

520329,jimbo,2002-05-18 15:35:00,223,"Karl,Do thery have a new crossing at International Falls? I heard they have opened a new crossing and it is faster. Do you still pay a toll?Thanks Jimbo"
520330,Karl,2002-05-18 19:10:00,63,"The toll is US$6.00 or C$9.00 and they only charge it on the way in. They moved it to where the old customs building used to be, so you pay the toll before you get to customs. Customs is a new building with four lanes. When I crossed last week Sunday at about 5:00 P.M. there wasn't another vehicle in sight, and accordingly they only had one lane open.When I came back on Friday morning at 10:00 A.M. I couldn't see how many northbound lanes were open, but traffic was backed up to Border Bob's."
520323,Guest,2002-05-19 08:51:00,0,here's to good friends....see ya soon canada
520319,phidelt157,2002-05-19 18:29:00,191,"Canadian guy:It's true, I did start one of the longest threads on WC, but I wasn't the one continuing it......FYI: The one guy we had worried about with the DWI has dropped the trip, so I'm sorry to say there won't be any exciting border crossing stories coming from 'ol 157. Just about a month away......can't wait!"
520311,Guest,2002-05-16 05:17:00,0,Is anybody getting a little nervous? As long as your not bringing up anything illeagal and your honest you should be just fine! Would like to hear from you guys/gals going up on opener next week sometime and here how things went. Just remember a shore lunch and a cold blue is only a few days away for some of you!!!!!
520312,docIN,2002-05-16 05:45:00,120,...and if you have a cold blue with your shore lunch away from your primary residence you will be very blue if the OPP catches you. Just a word of advice and be safe.
520313,Guest,2002-05-16 05:51:00,0,More than a little nervous. Crossing Saturday with an American felon (DWI). He's got his rehabilitation (extortion) fee ready.
520314,Toolman,2002-05-16 06:11:00,2570,"Walleyeone,I was wondering how much the rehabilitation fee is? Not that I need it, but just curious. Thanks.Tim"
520315,phidelt157,2002-05-16 06:46:00,191,Be sure to post next week and let us know what happened.
520316,Guest,2002-05-16 07:58:00,0,$200 CanadianI will post a border crossing report when we get back (5/26).
520320,Guest,2002-05-16 08:15:00,0,OPP...Overly Penal Policies. but when in Rome right? yeah right:)
520317,Trophymuskie,2002-05-16 12:56:00,254,"Wow that $200 is Canadian and you get in right away, thats only $130US and a bargain. The US customs blackmail (for pot smoking not DUI) is $195US (+$50Can for stuff you need for the aplication) or $300 (+ $50) Canadian and is a 9 month process that must be done every year.My buddy has decided to pass on Disney World, his kids are the ones that are going to miss it.I think you guys got the better deal again. :-(Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com"
520322,Guest,2002-05-16 13:39:00,0,What is the reason for your question?
520324,Guest,2002-05-16 13:45:00,0,"I crossed into Washington from British Columbia last week for a few days fishing. I had absolutely no problem either way. Showed them my passport, boat and trailer registration, answered a couple of questions and I was on my way. 30 seconds each direction.Don't know what the big deal is!Maybe if I was a felon I would had a problem but this works equally whether you are a Canadian going into the US or an American coming to Canada."
