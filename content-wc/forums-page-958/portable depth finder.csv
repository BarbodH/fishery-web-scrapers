520226,Walleye Wacker,2002-05-15 09:24:00,6,Try Humminbird 200DX Portable. Bought mine from Bass Pro and have been very pleased with it. Use it on flyins and batterys will last a full week even fishing 12 hours a day.
520227,Toolman,2002-05-15 09:28:00,2570,"Wilson, I converted one of my x-85's to portable. Cost around $50. Need portable transducer/cable (suction cup) and a set of power cables with alligator clips (so you don't have to take the one out of the boat. Add 12v gel cell battery for about $30 more. I put mine on a micro RAM mount. Works great.Tim"
520228,Guest,2002-05-15 11:01:00,0,Hey I was in the same situation last year. Bought a portable Bottomline Fishing Buddy for ~$125. It runs for about 20 hours on 3 C batteries and does a good job of identifying fish and depth. If I was going to use it for more than 1-2 fly-ins per year I would spend a bit more but for occational use this is perfect.Bob
520229,Guest,2002-05-15 17:05:00,0,"I've had a Humminbird 200 for 2 years now and I wouldn't trade it for anything. They run forever if you put decent batteries in them. Also easy to transport and use. My brother has a Fishin Buddy that we also bring, it also does a decent job but is a bit more awkward to transort -- plus, you have to be careful the handle (where you insert the D size batteries) doesn't come loose and fall in the lake!(It happened to us!)"

520232,Guest,2002-05-15 22:42:00,0,"I just bought the new Humminbird Pirahna 1 Portable for $200 CDN at my local tackle shop. This is the average price for the portable unit. The non-portable unit goes for $129 CDN. It uses 8AA batteries and it lasted me about 28 hrs total, so far on the 8 batteries. Not the best portable out there but it's VERY small, and gets the job done. Fish ID actually works on this Humminbird unit. I'm going to jury-rig it to work on the 8mAh rechargable gel-cel packs and will let others know if this works good.Humminbird website: http://www.humminbird.com/hb_Products.asp?ID=230Hope this helps."
520233,zugbug,2002-05-19 16:48:00,67,"Garmin's Portable 100 is a good one to look at, also the New eagle fish easy 2, 240 pixels in a low cost Portable. But if you have an X-85 already pick up the ppp and your ready to go. The garmin and eagle products are availeable at most full line fishing retailers.Zugbug"
