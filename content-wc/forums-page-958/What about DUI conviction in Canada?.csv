This guy basically was let out on bail two years ago and never returned and has never really found out whether he was convicted (if that can be done in his absence) or whether a warrant exists (which would be the case here). He did get a letter that his driving privileges were ""reinstated"" sometime after the incident.Aside from him needing to check for himself what his legal status actually is up there, is immigration asking about any convictions or just convictions in the USA? Thanks."

They can't grab him through the phone line and this way he will be forwarned to not come to Canada untill he takes care of the matter.Forgot to mention that here in Ontario when one fails to appear for a court apearance a plea of guilty in entered on his part, now thats for traffic violations so not sure about DUI's they are a criminal offence here so they may have a warrant for his arrest till he shows in court to defend himself.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com"

Amazing how people will just ignore something with such potentially serious consequences. I am assuming border computers will check U.S. and Canada criminal histories, just didn't know for sure."
520525,Guest,2002-05-20 19:02:00,0,They can/will check you for US and Canada and Interpol warrents/ criminal issues. You basically need to assume if you did something wrong that they will catch you.Brett
520526,Wally,2002-05-21 23:15:00,38,I wouldn't cross the border.
520527,Guest,2002-05-22 19:22:00,0,He should atay in the USA. If a check was done he'd be in a little bit of trouble.
