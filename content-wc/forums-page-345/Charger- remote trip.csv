2384073,NY Walleye,2014-01-25 14:52:00,78,Looking for any info on a charger that can be hooked to a solar powered battery bank. Looking to charge a fish finder while off the grid. Searched the site but most info was about boat batteries. Battery banks has four batteries. Need to know what I can buy to hook to the batteries and then to the finder. Any help- pictures ect would be great.
2384281,Pooch,2014-01-25 17:14:00,4619,"Camp have a solar system or are you taking one of the small portable panels?What voltage do you need to charge? 110v to 12v? Or 12v to 12v?Charging just a battery then using it in the boat?How big is the battery you want to charge?What is the output of the solar system?Someone on this board will be able to point you in the right direction, just give them more specifics.I want to hear what folks have to say, too. Good question.Pooch"
2384329,adempsey,2014-01-25 17:43:00,963,"I believe you need to find out the voltage of the battery pack and buy an inverter that uses the same voltage. It should be 12V, 24V or 48V. Depends on how the batteries are connected etc.. You then connect the inverter to the lead battery (the one that is connected to the controller) with clamps. Plug your charger into the inverter and charge up your battery. However, not all inverters are equal, so I would do your research on that. Definitely something to discuss with your outfitter as well. They should have an idea what you need."

Would like charge from a 110 to 12volt battery for portable fish finder. Would like to run clips on the solar panels batteries, to an actual plug, plug in fish finder charge to that plug. I would need to know what to buy to accomplish this. Is it even possible? I do not know the output of the solar system. Any ideas or thoughts would be great."
2387249,adempsey,2014-01-26 17:56:00,963,"I'd imagine it's a 12V system, but keep in mind, water pumps can require 24V so the solar panel setup could be 24V. I'd imagine they would opt for a 12V pump though. So let's assume it's 12V. You will need an inverter which converts the 12V DC to 120V AC. All the 120V chargers for my 12V SLA batteries are between 20W and 30W, so you want an inverter that provides 50W+. Maybe something like this?http://www.theinverterstore.com/180-...-inverter.htmlIt's a pure sine wave inverter, which are a bit more expensive, but provides the best conversion [there are three types of inverters, square wave - very cheap, modified sine wave and pure sine wave - most expensive]. You might be able to use a modified sine wave inverter, but for charging batteries I am not sure if works well or not. I really don't have enough practical experience with this, so hopefully some others will chime in and offer some more practical advice on what inverter to use."
2388185,SinOrSwim,2014-01-27 05:31:00,1528,"If all you are doing is charging a fish finder battery, get a cheap inverter and use the alligator clips to plug it to the house battery or the battery for the water pump and plug your fish finder battery charger into the inverter. You do not need a high end inverter for this. The only reasons you would is if you were running computer equipment etc. We have been doing this for years and years and never had a problem. We had a bank of batteries in the cabin along with one battery down on the dock for the water pump. Both have worked perfectly fine. I do take a voltmeter with me just in case but have rarely used it."
2389265,adempsey,2014-01-27 11:00:00,963,"I was reading up a bit more on the types of inverters and indeed a modified sine wave inverter should be more than adequate for charging the 12V battery. The only reason I thought there might be an issue is because I read about problems with charging battery packs used in power tools, but those are a different animal anyway."
