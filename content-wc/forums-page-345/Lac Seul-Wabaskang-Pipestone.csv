If I get followed up the lake, I'll either just stop, or take the challenging route. I may be biased here, because lots of knowledge equals lots of places to stay from the pack. This lake is huge, and can't see it ever getting to the point of wall to wall boats."
2405241,BreezyPoint,2014-01-31 08:17:00,1581,"I've fished Lake of the Woods, Lac Seul, the Winnipeg River and the English River. On all of these places, I've been able to fish and catch plenty of fish without ever sharing a spot. There are many places to fish and when I go to Canada, I have always done well fishing without companion boats. Yes, if you go to the well known spots (MacKenzie Bay on Lac Seul, for example), you will see a lot of boats), but if you are willing to explore, you can have a true wilderness experience on all of these waters."
2405265,prov1800,2014-01-31 08:21:00,5010,"Got to remember that in the scout bay area there are 3 camps located there.plus lac suel lodge comes into the bay of islands also and a lot of the earfalls camps come toward this area to.everybody blows through steamboat narrows area.that area is fantastic walleye waters and hardly anybody fishes there.good for me thats where I go late summer.also not a lot of fishing being done south past Manitoba point, indigo point and into the big water.south inlet is pretty much left alone also.I hardly ever see boats where I take my guests.few times over the years ive encountered a couple of losers trying to fish to close to me.I just bring out a backdated with a double cowgirl and if I hit the boat there to close usually they leave.lol.yup that was me if you were one of those guys.otherwise its been good.ive been out there since the mid 80, s and used to be real quite out there then has gotten real busy hey why not its a awesome fishery.but there are areas to hide."
2406105,prov1800,2014-01-31 11:37:00,5010,Good point colin.over here on the west side its busy were the camp spots are.I just pretty much avoid those places and go to my spots which are basically void of other boats.if i see other boats around i just dont fish there to long.if you stay to long theyll think your catcing fish and will come closer o check you out.
2406425,Guest,2014-01-31 13:40:00,0,"Get in touch with Goldpines Camp on the NW end of Lac Seul. Great accommodations, great people to work with."
2407561,btmbncr,2014-01-31 23:06:00,492,"Colin,how many camps are located on the part of Lac Seul you fish? Nothing like the NW corner I'll willing bet.You have much less pressure.I'm sure you have spots to fish by yourself as do some of us NW end dieheards.As soon as there is a camp on the NE/SE side of Lac Seul where my wife and I can stay for a month with our boat for $2800.00 I'll switch ends.It's all relative .Bill aka Backtroller Billy"
2409401,billy weaver,2014-02-01 17:04:00,470,"Check Peffley's Canadian Wilderness Camp website. Plenty of pictures, clean as they come, no guide needed, plenty of fish, a lot of coves and bays to get away from the wind if needed. The smallmouth fishing has been good the last few years. Walleyes galore."
2402929,icepro680,2014-01-30 15:05:00,74,"I want to go to to Canada in late August. I am looking for the best ""Canada experience"" for myself and my wife, if there is such a thing. I would like good fishing and remoteness, i.e i dont mind seeing a couple boats but don't wanna share a spot with 5 or more boats. I am not looking for lodges just an opinon on which of these three laks would suit me best. I have some formed opinions on these three and just want verification if i am correct. Lac Seul lots of fish and lots of other people. Wabaskang ok fishery but less traffic. Pipestone pretty remote with the big portage but fishing can be very tough."
2403337,pjshorthorn,2014-01-30 16:57:00,5654,"Of your three choices, I've only fished Lac Seul. Big lake with a ton of options to choose from.....some outfitters offer both lodge and outpost options. Using the search option on Lac Seul will probably give you more feedback to fill your time for the next few years. I love Lac Seul for the fishing, scenery, multiple species and lodging options. I'm heading to a different lake for the first time to try a new adventure.....time to explore. Enjoy your trip no matter where you land."
2403913,ftfarms,2014-01-30 19:03:00,444,I've fished both lac seul and wabaskang Love lac seul for walleye but stopped fishing there because of people thinking they needed too follow use around and fish right next to me it's a big lake they can fish somewhere else. I like the lodge owners on wabaskang where we stay walleye fishings not as good as lac seul but we always catch a lot. (Gawleys parkview camp). Your third choice should be cedar lake by them both. The walleye and smallmouth fishing is really good there and a easy lake to fish. We now fish Lotw out of morson haven't had anyone play bumper boats with us yet and fishings as good as lac seul. iMO.
2404089,wallydave,2014-01-30 19:59:00,2151,"Lac Seul can have some traffic, but in August the traffic is nothing like early spring. Its also a big lake, which end are you looking at? Plus what type of lodging are you thinking about? There are some high end places and some nice housekeeping places too! Try the search function for info."
2404313,icepro680,2014-01-30 21:09:00,74,"I have been looking in what I would call NW or west, places like Goose Bay and out to Onaway and Lac Seul lodge. I am looking for a housekeeping cabin, probably bringing my own boat but not sure about that one yet."
2404361,prov1800,2014-01-30 21:32:00,5010,"Goose bay lodge is a decent place great owner.bit of a run back to the bay of island and the shanty narrows.lac suel lodge would ideal as well as onaway and there is also fisherman's cove both in scout bay.bigwater and can be rough on windy days and lac suel ddoesn't need much wind to get it going.especially with camp boats.great fishing.good pike and smallmouth.few m uskies on the west side.the sioux lookout side has the same fishing with the m uskies.cedar lake has great walleye fishing plus m uskies and fairly quiet by the end of August. Smaller lake and easier to fish in rough weather with the option to go into perrault lake.nice camps there.Clarke's northern light, cedar point resort, cedar lake lodge.if you want total seclusion might want to take a look at lost bay resort on cliff lake, w alleyes are tough but huge, fantastic muskie fishery and lake trout and smallies everywhere.one of my favourites for peace and quiet. Smaller camp boats there your own would be best every hazard is marked there."
2404601,ftfarms,2014-01-31 05:16:00,444,We fished lac seul from1991-2005'and in the spring we stayed at white wing resort close to ear falls and in august we stayed at scoutbay resort. Both at that time of year were close to the better fishing. Both places had nice boats and cabins. Lac seul lodge scoutbay that area is where you want to stay that time of year. Great summer fishing area if you don't mind a few boats around.
2404609,elkman99,2014-01-31 05:23:00,180,"I've been on all 3 of those lakes, and I don't think you could make a bad choice. If you want the remote feel with the least amount of pressure, then go to Pipestone Lodge. Art is a hoot and runs a great camp. This would also be the best of the bunch for multi-species. For trout water, Pipestone is outstanding for walleye. It doesn't have the numbers that you would get at Lac Seul, or even Wabby, but it sure does have some hawgs in there. If the wife doesn't want stuck on an island for a week, then the others would fit the bill better. There is one more thing to consider in August, and that is algae blooms. You wouldn't have to deal with those on Pipestone. It might not bug the walleye folks too much, but me as a musky guy, I don't like fishing in pea soup."
2404809,btmbncr,2014-01-31 06:54:00,492,Don't kid yourself there is as much boat traffic on Lac Seul in August as the spring.The fish are more spread out later.The fisherman are more spread out.I have fished spots on Lac Seul in August on schools of active fish and have never seen a boat close by. If you want solitude go on a fly out.I can't seem to find a drive to lake that produces more and bigger fish than Lac Seul.Bill
2405169,ftfarms,2014-01-31 08:07:00,444,I'll agree with as many boats in August as spring time. And it's hard to find a lake with the numbers of wallye a day and size but English river north of kenora and Lotw out of morson for us have ben as close as it gets. And there is a lot of boat traffic on lotw. It's a lot like lac suel in the summer every point or reef has walleye on it.
