2407633,KurtG,2014-02-01 00:57:00,259,"Bought a couple of 8' trout rods off ebay last year. 2 rods including shipping were under $50, Rated for 1/32 oz to 1/2 oz and 4-10# line Fast taper and light action graphite. Take some getting used to but these are great with smaller jigs. Plenty of backbone but kinda soft which helps with long rod. Hook setting is more of a sweep than a snap. Good feel for sensitive bites and strong enough for a 25# Whisker fish on 6# tatsu A suggestion is to consider your choice based on bait weight I rarely use over a 1/8th oz jig and use a lot of 1/48 - 1/24 so I really wanted a rod specifically made for the lighter weights. Definitely go with graphite these light weight (mass) rods are a dream when you spend 6-8 hours jigging. the 8 - 10 ounce weight saving is blessing in disguise. The longer rods take some getting used to especially when setting hooks. Overall, match your rod to what you are fishing. Makes a tremendous difference"

2404065,Yarhcaz,2014-01-30 19:49:00,1389,A rod that actually isnt all too bad and fits your price range is a Berkley Lightning Rod. They can be had your local Walmart for 29 to 39 bucks. I bought one for one of my kids...and I was very surprised by it.I would also recommend the cheaper Scheels rods...plus they come with probably the best warranty.
2404105,Los Pollos Hermanos,2014-01-30 20:06:00,10,"If you are on a budget, I highly suggest you start looking in the Bargain Cave on the Cabelas website. You can pull a good rod at half price or less if you check daily. Their name brand rods are not a St Croix but they are good rods. They have quite a few on there right now in your range. I always laugh about my first trip to Canada about 15 years ago. I loaded up my boat with my $150 rods and Stradic reels, 25 pound tackle box filled with more lures than what a car should be worth. I looked like I was king Sh$#. We hired a guide for the first day on Lac Seul and he showed up with a $12.99 Quantum combo spinning rod and reel. The rod had slightly more backbone than a weeping willow branch. His tackle box was a bleach container that he cut a hole in. He worked the motor and me and my buddy fished all day with him. I looked at him and thought what a waste of money he will be. He caught 4 fish for every one me or my buddy caught. Nice tip at shore lunch and this guy set us up all week on the lake patterns. I learned a lot from that guy. Namely that the guy holding the rod is far more important than what rod you are holding. Spend wisely, and then work the lake. Find the humps, the dropoffs and keep the boat where it should be. The rod will bend."

2404697,Jack77,2014-01-31 06:23:00,168,"I was going to suggest the Ugly Stik as well. I have a 2 piece ML 7' that I have used for jigging, casting, and trolling. I have purchased more expensive application specific Okuma and St. Croix rods but the Ugly Stik always goes north with me. I have caught many a walleye jigging with that Ugly Stik over the years."

I bought 2 of them. I don't know if they are any good or not but I liked the price. Felt good to me for $15
2405489,SeulAreaWalleye,2014-01-31 09:13:00,100,"Although I personally only use St. Croix, Thorne. Bros custom and Loomis, as do many of my repeat clients. The best cheap walleye rod that I have seen in 20 plus years of guiding would have to be the Ugly Stick Lite, buy this over the Lightning rod, as it is a more sturdy fishing rod."
2405593,adempsey,2014-01-31 09:30:00,963,"At that price point I would opt for a store brand. Cabelas, BPS, Gander Mountain etc.. Should be able to get a decent rod for around $40 to $50.Cabelas Tourney TrailCabelas Pro GuideBPS Pro Tourney (This model comes in a 5'8"" and 6' Medium Fast, which sound perfect to me)BPS Graphite Series"
