It's a huge lake, very long and deep, with three cabins on it, and a small portage or two. Lake trout, northern, and walleye inhabit the lake. Just wondering if anyone's experienced this lake or Viking Outposts in general before, any information I could get would be appreciated. Thanks guys!"
2398361,The Donger,2014-01-29 11:30:00,48,"We fished Critchell Lake through Viking Outposts several years ago and I portaged into McInnes for an afternoon of fishing. We are going to the Middle camp on McInnes this year with a group of six in June. Several members of our party have fished McInnes in the past and really wanted to go back. I consider Viking to be a very good outfitter. I wouldn't call their outposts luxury accommodations but then again I don't go on a fly-in to experience luxury. I want to be out in the boonies and actually feel like I am roughing it a bit. Their outposts are comfortable, well maintained, well equipped, and they have all the basics plus a bit. Their weight limit on fly-ins is 150 pounds which is nice. They will bring your beer to the outpost in advance so it doesn't count against you weight limit. 2 check flights during the week if I remember correctly. I think their rates are a steal for everything you get. Boats are Naden's with 10 h.p. motors and unlimited gas."

I suggest you provide Hugh or Enid with information about your needs and expectations so they can fill you in. They know more about their camps than any fisherman spending a week or two a year fishing the lakes and you can be assured that they are giving you the whole story. What they say is what you'll get."

Has all the characteristics of a good lake that I look for and would bet it has trophy potential. If you decide to go, would really like to hear about your experience."

I have not been to McInnes Lake, but will vouch for the Enid & Hugh Carlson operation as well worth the trip & effort! Set the Hook, CRJohn"
