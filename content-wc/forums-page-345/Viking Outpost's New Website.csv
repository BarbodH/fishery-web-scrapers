We're going up there in August and I'd love to hear some first-hand info on the lake. As far as their website goes, I can tell you it's been that way for me for at least the last month or two, that's how long we've been looking at going there. Thanks for any info, if not, have a great trip!"

The inlet at the Northern end is a walleye factory.First time on McInnes, we screwed up and let two newbies out in a boat by themselves. They were throwing spoons in over 100 feet of featureless water in the middle of the lake. I get back to the cabin, and these guys are beaming. They can't wait to show me the huge ""walleye"" they caught. On the cleaning table are three monster lake trout.Freakin' beginners luck....."
