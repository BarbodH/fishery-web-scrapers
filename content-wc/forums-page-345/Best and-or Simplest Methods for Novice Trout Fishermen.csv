Last year we were on trout water and had planned on taking a few short hours to pursue some trout. Admittedly, we had no idea what we are doing so we purchased a few River2Sea Diver Vibe (80s I think) at the suggestion of the Camp Owner as well as some heavier jig setups. However, we never really took the time to try it out (very hard to put down the Musky rods). We are going back to trout water again this year (early July). I realize there is quite a bit of skill involved in targeting trout, but let me know if you have any advice on simple methods to catch a few trout while on our trip. One of the guys in our group actually caught a trout while casting for Musky last year which was very cool for our group to see! Bottom-line is that everyone in our group thinks trout are delicious so we would love to be able to catch a few for dinner on the trip. Thanks in advance for the help!"
2406617,adempsey,2014-01-31 14:58:00,963,"In July I would assume the fish will be in 60+ FOW (probably suspended over 90+ FOW). Personally, I don't think there is any more skill in catching lake trout than any other fish. It's more a technical problem. You need to get down deep enough to where they are and attract them.1) Vertical jig heavy jigs with swimbaits, tubes etc.. Easy to do, but IMO, not always easy to execute well. If your boat is moving too fast, your jig isn't where you think it is. I haven't done this too much, so maybe it works great for others. Just not for me so far.2) Troll. To get down deep you can use a portable down rigger (ideally with a rigger rod), jet diver/dipsy divers (ideally with a dipsy rod), lead core, steel line, three-way rigs, inline weights or snap-on weights.I think the easiest, from a technical standpoint, would be to use snap-on weights, in-line weights or a three-way rig. Personally I use a three-way setup (with 4 to 6oz of lead weight) since I don't fish lakers in the summer that often. It's pretty archaic, but effective enough. However, I just made some snap-on weights today to try this summer."
2407217,Mike Borger,2014-01-31 19:37:00,1554,"Easiest way in the summer is jigging.I like large peodominantly white bucktail jigs in the 1-3oz range tipped with a strip of belly meat or a minnow. Stinger hook helps. Also any heavy jigging spoon. Hopkins, Buckshot Rattle spoons, large Swedish Pimples, they all work.Use your electronics to find the fish and lower your jig to the correct depth. Important to be as verticle as possible which can be an issue with no electric motor if it's windy. Braid is a must when fishing that deep.Should be fairly easy to find the lakers as they should be concentrated in the deeper basins by July. Studying a good depth map beforehand is where your search should start.I rip these baits pretty good, most hits come either at rest or on the upswing.Sometimes dropping the jig right to the bottom then working it fast back up through the water column will trigger strikes."
2408689,Simple Man,2014-02-01 11:55:00,92,Thanks for the input. Hope we can covince ourselves to put down the murky rods for a little while to try our hand at the trout.
