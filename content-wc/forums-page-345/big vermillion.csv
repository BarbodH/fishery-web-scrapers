2394921,PA troutguy,2014-01-28 14:07:00,58,"I am headed to Big Vermillion Lake near Sioux Lookout from mid May through early June. Any advice on where to fish, navigation tips, lures to use? How is the pike and smallmouth fishing?"
2396201,Lambertson Rock Guy,2014-01-28 18:32:00,20,It has been several years since I have fished on Big V. My group stayed at Deerpath Lodge and mainly fished walleyes on Lac Seul. One day on each trip we would fish for smallmouth on Big V and had tons of action. We just asked the camp owner where to go and what to use and he gave us a map with spots marked and hazards to avoid. We didn't target pike at all. We were usually there the second week in June.
2396681,Pooch,2014-01-28 20:33:00,4619,There are some guides and a sportswriter in Sioux Lookout that may be able to help you. I believe they sometimes frequent this board. I apologize for not remembering their names. Someone will see your post sooner or later and respond.One part of our group hired a guide two years ago to give them advice on Lake trout fishing. Then fished Big V following the advice. Had they not hired a guide for advice they would probably have choked if they had gone out without some advice before hitting the water.Pooch

2400753,BuckeyeBill,2014-01-29 23:06:00,76,"We are going to be staying at River Edge outfitters on Big V beginning Saturday, June 7th. The smallie fishing is outstanding, the pike not so much. You would be better on lost lake which is just a few minutes away for pike and walleye. Big V has smallies, lake trout, muskie and some pike. Any questions you might have ask away or send me a private message. Glad to help."
2401057,prov1800,2014-01-30 06:00:00,5010,"Lost lake is basically lac suel, could also launch into pelican, abram and then you would also get access to m innitaki.great walleye, bass, pike, lake trout and some muskie fishing in these waters to.if the water is high you can go through the falls on pelican and go into lac suel."
2403985,pjshorthorn,2014-01-30 19:33:00,5654,Do they still run the portage tractor rig around Pelican Falls when the water is low ? It has been a long time since used it.
2405577,SeulAreaWalleye,2014-01-31 09:26:00,100,"Big V has endless smallmouth on every shoreline in June. Visibilty is about 15 ft down, so on a calm day you should be able to spot them well. You will encounter the odd pike or musky, but size wise head to Lac Seul. Lake trout population is healthy and well protected with a slot size(which most are right in), and artificial baits only. Every Trout angler has their own style and lure for catching, which all work well. a bit of research can show you the right baits to put in your box. Downrigging works well here too. Shallow early, and deep late....but not the pattern for all lake trout. Lakers swim the whole water column. The Pelican Portage is no longer run by the MNR, and local camp owners will have access to portage with their own rigs if it is a low water year. Asking a camp may get you across and pick you up, only if they are heading there for their own boats, and for a small fee. Most of us just run the rapids all year, but you HAVE to know exactly what you are doing in here. Hudson and Deception launches are the main access to Lac Seul."
