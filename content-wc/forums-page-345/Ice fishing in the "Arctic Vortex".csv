Then we got a brief warm spell that melted some of the snow (water on top of the ice). Then we got the extreme cold weather - but the ice making was slowed by the insulation of the snow. The resort owners couldn't put out their rental houses until well after the first of January. They would try to plow for a road and they would hit the slush on top of the ice and get stuck. It is now safe and the houses have been put out.I feel bad for the resort owners to have to deal with this AND the restricted fish limit."
2393385,v-bay gord,2014-01-28 08:55:00,3168,"tv4fish........the trout lakes up here froze after the first few big dumps of snow. That's why there's good ice and not that much slush. Now, other lakes such as Eagle have plenty of ice, but way more snow and lots of slush. I can't remember the last time we've had so much snow here...."
2398585,briand,2014-01-29 12:48:00,48,I would have to agree about the snow.We go for lakers in the area but down the gorden lake rd.Some of the smaller lakes had lots of slush.
2385809,v-bay gord,2014-01-26 09:27:00,3168,It's not all about huddling around the wood stove and soaring LP prices. Some of us actually go fishing in these conditions.... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EhgE...aEQwO3VCD_OQRw
2386265,NARDA 1,2014-01-26 11:38:00,636,"Nice video!!! I've never been ice fishing, I'll have to try that someday."
2386273,Fishoil,2014-01-26 11:39:00,1277,"Awesome video Gord!! There's nothing that compares to the smile on a young one's face and excitement after a good battle. That ""drawing"" at the end of Joe holding up Scar Face is cool. Is that done with your editing software?"
2386449,NWwalleye,2014-01-26 12:21:00,223,Thanks for sharing Gord ..Good to see that 3 West Eagle Lodge owner can get out and fish on there days off in the winter months..Bet that doesn't happen to often in the summer ..Keep the videos coming ...
2386489,v-bay gord,2014-01-26 12:39:00,3168,"Thanks Fishoil. The ""drawing"" is just some form of photo enhancement that I have on Windows 7. It's in the same program that I use to edit the video and photos, and upload to my blog. Don't ask me how anything works....it's all rocket science to me."
2386513,v-bay gord,2014-01-26 12:42:00,3168,It is actually cool that we get along as fellow camp owners on Eagle Lake. Doesn't hurt that we are all on the fire department as well. Sucks that Pat always catches the trout though.
2387585,Catman59,2014-01-26 19:51:00,345,Great Video !!!!! Thanks for sharing Gord.
2388897,NWwalleye,2014-01-27 09:26:00,223,[QUOTE=v-bay gord;2386513Sucks that Pat always catches the trout though.[/QUOTE]looks like he shared his catch though... Nothing like a fresh fish fry..
2390201,tv4fish,2014-01-27 14:27:00,2694,"Gord: I'm kind of surprised at the thickness of the ice -What was it?I didn't think that you guys ""suffered"" from the same problem that we had down on Mille Lacs this year!"
2390249,v-bay gord,2014-01-27 14:38:00,3168,I think there was maybe 18 inches of ice there. Not familiar with the problem you are having down your way?
