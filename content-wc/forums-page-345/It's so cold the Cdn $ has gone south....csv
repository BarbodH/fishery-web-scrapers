2377977,Skywagon,2014-01-23 15:03:00,1106,That will be good for trade. May slow down trips south of the border though. Overall a good thing in my opinion.
2378097,fishguide1800,2014-01-23 15:32:00,84,Its about time.hope it drops more.that will be good for us poor guides.
2378321,Fishoil,2014-01-23 16:20:00,1277,The lodge I go to deals in US dollars but if it goes to 25% I'm going to have to find one that does business in Canadian dollars and take an extra trip.

2384761,Obabikon,2014-01-25 20:45:00,2370,"It'll be nice even for us lodges that charge in US funds. We can either keep the prices the same, or (gasp) actually lower prices!"
