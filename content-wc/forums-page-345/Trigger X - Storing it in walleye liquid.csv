2374073,bones82,2014-01-22 13:49:00,121,"I prefer to have my baits in buckets and store them in the Plano liqua bait containers. I want to take my Trigger X out of the packaging and store it in the Trigger X Walleye pheromone spray. Can I do this? And if so, can I mix colors of Trigger X and not have to worry about bleeding of color or fusing of baits?Also, does anyone know the difference between Dr. Juice Walleye and Trigger X Walleye? They're both Normark products I believe. Both pheromone type sprays. What type of results have you had with either? Might soak the Trigger X baits in Dr Juice Walleye. Thoughts?Please help if you can."
2374281,camp chef,2014-01-22 15:00:00,915,My guess is that they are probably the same stuff packaged differently. It is just a guess but I am a pretty good guesser. LOL
2374753,bones82,2014-01-22 17:36:00,121,"Ha. Thanks Chef! I talked to a Rapala customer service rep and they didn't know the answer. Have any of you stored Trigger X either in the walleye liquid or Dr Juice walleye? If so, did you mix colors?"
2394593,bones82,2014-01-28 12:56:00,121,Has anyone ever done this?
2397113,manitobawalleye,2014-01-29 04:57:00,885,"I have mixed a variety of baits without colours mixing, including the Trigger X that was individually packaged in juice. Did not notice a big loss or mixing of colours over a summer. This was about 3-4 years ago. Not sure if any formulas have changed. Do it right before your season starts and try it out in a small batch."
2397305,bones82,2014-01-29 06:35:00,121,Thank you Manitobawalleye. What types of baits did you mix? I was thinking about throwing them in with like colored Gulp Alive. Maybe adding some Dr Juice Walleye liquid to the mix too.
2400905,manitobawalleye,2014-01-30 04:47:00,885,"I did not put any Gulp Alive in, Trigger x and Northland products. I would not mix up Gulp Alive products."
