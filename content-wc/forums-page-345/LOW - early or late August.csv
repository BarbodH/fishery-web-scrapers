There's a huge advantage to knowing which weed beds get choked and which weed beds are late blooming. Lots of options. Like I mentioned before, weather is unpredictable. I've seen both time frames unbelievable for northerns and tough."
2396257,fldoc,2014-01-28 18:46:00,47,"Our group is thinking of going to the Miles Bay, Obabikon Lake area in August. Some like casting for northerns or ?? much more than jigging, fishing for walleyes. Would you recommend early August or later August when casting is important. I would love to fish in September but work is in the way. Randy from Duluth"
2396361,jimirjr,2014-01-28 19:10:00,1149,Also interested.... going up mid-Sept.....
2396433,zeebee,2014-01-28 19:25:00,1144,"If I were targeting NP's in August and into Sept it would be throwing large swimbaits and cranks off points and around saddles. Dont hesitate to present a lure down to 20'. You can troll the larger sized HJ's and expect to catch plenty of walleye too, again off rocky points and underwater humps. Musky will be there so an appropriate leader would be a good idea. Come August I like to troll and will go as deep as 30' chasing eyes but the larger NP's Ive caught seem to be 15- 20' down.Its a great time of year to go as weather will have likely stabilized, bugs are all but gone and nights are cool for sleeping."
2396457,Obabikon,2014-01-28 19:28:00,2370,"Randy, It's hard to say, as every year the weather can be different. The one thing that will be a guarantee is the moon. I'd suggest picking your dates to be in front of the full moon. (starting 4 days or so before) (this year, it is August 10th)"
2396601,Golden Eagle,2014-01-28 20:07:00,2642,"Moon phases determine every one of my fishing trips, except for the annual walleye opener. Many times I go in a week before for a two week stay or stick around for second week after walleye opener to enjoy a favorable moon."
2396633,BreezyPoint,2014-01-28 20:18:00,1581,"Zeebee is right. I have fished the area a lot in all seasons, but find northern fishing tough in late summer unless fishing much deeper. We have had our best luck at that time fishing bull dawgs in 20-25 fow. We have caught some very nice fish that way. Muskies too, but I still find most muskies in less than 10 fow at that time. When I catch northerns in Obabikon and Miles Bay, there are often oriented to rock bars and boulders. Never have had fantastic numbers, but the average size has been big, most over 30 inches..One thing to note is that I often find northerns move up shallow when it gets cloudy, even at that time of year.If you are going to fish Obabikon Lake, I would guess you will find the northerns shallower. There is not a lot of deep water there and there are extensive weed beds. We have caught hundreds of northerns there, most not really big, but an occasional nice one in the mix.Be careful motoring into Obabikon Lake. There are a few tight spots on the way in with some big rocks to boot."
2396641,BreezyPoint,2014-01-28 20:24:00,1581,"Or the new moon for muskies (and the period leading in as Obabikon stated).Here is a chart of more the 12000 muskies by moon phase. The difference between phases is small, but there is an observable pattern.http://www.redwinglodge.net/wp-conte...Moon-Phase.pdf"
2396665,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2014-01-28 20:31:00,629,"Over the 30+ years of being on LOTW waters, there have been multiple times during the month of August that ""Obabikon Lake"" can be very ""Weedy"". To the point that I have had to come back out because of the weeds in the prop & or struggling with weeds on every cast. It is true that I do not travel into Obabikon Lake every year, but I'm only cautioning you of a possibility that can particularly exist when we have a hot summer in conjunction with low water. I'm sure that Obabikon can certainly provide the last word regarding my concern. Miles Bay water in August will not provide the same weed conditions. LOTW is a great fishery with a lot of places to hunt the N. Pike. Set the Hook & enjoy your trip, CRJohn"
2396689,BreezyPoint,2014-01-28 20:35:00,1581,"But there is a nice bar about half way into the lake, running n-s that produces a lot of fish and I have always found fishable, even when the lake is at its weediest..."
2397513,LOW1,2014-01-29 07:44:00,2828,"I think that you will find far fewer boats on the lake in late August than you will in early August, if that is important to you. But LOTW is a big place, so either time will be nice."
