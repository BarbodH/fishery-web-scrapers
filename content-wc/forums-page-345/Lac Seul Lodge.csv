2393001,Shotgun,2014-01-28 07:34:00,759,"Pooch, nice lodge and good operators. As mentioned lake is full of hazards more so than many other fisheries I've been on. I've run across rock piles out where you think the lake is wide open and all of a sudden the depth alarm goes off. Took out a prop the first year I was there. For me the most annoying thing on this lake was the poor fishing etiquette exhibited by other fisherman. Some of the worst I've seen in my 16 years fishing Canada, i.e., going by you WOT, crossing your trolling lines, etc... However, the fishing is very good with some nice fish caught. My advice is to just take your time when moving around the lake vs. running WOT. For some fun late in the evening troll the the bank across the bay from the lodge tossing some spoons for pike. Good Luck!"

They DO show reefs and hazards that you cannot see while on the water.Again Thanks.Pooch[/QUOTE]Pooch have you tried Google Earth for Aerial shots of LS?"
2393753,Pooch,2014-01-28 10:05:00,4619,"I look at Google Earth a lot, but the aerial photos from the MNR are by far superior. They are just really expensive anymore.I've fished LS for several years now and I agree, it is not a lake to run WOT on if you are not very familiar with the area. Even then the water fluctuations will offer up a surprise if not careful.Thanks for everyone's replies. I'm just always wary going into a new area or camp and like to avoid any surprises. Knowing some what to expect makes things go much smoother I've learned.I'll take all the advice you guys have to offer.Pooch"
2395217,tlars,2014-01-28 15:12:00,137,"Pooch, I'm lucky enough to have fished a fair amount of Lac Seul from Ear Falls to Hudson; some on my own and some with guides. I learned one tactic from the guides very early - establish your normal travel routes and use them to get from one major area to the next (i.e. from South Bay to McKenzie Bay). When you move away from the route towards your fishing spot, slow way down until you're comfortable with the water (and what's under it!). I've found that the Navionics map is helpful."
2402049,KHedquist,2014-01-30 11:02:00,4367,If you fish Canada Navionics released SonarCharts in Jan here is the link http://www.navionics.com/en/news/can...84%A2-now-live

Sounds like a tall skinny drink of water wearing plaid pants pink shirt and selling really quality used cars to the unwary?You lost me on the ""couple 40's"". I'm just an old farm boy and slow on the uptake so have patience with me and explain.Sounds like you should keep your reservation and we can visit. Maybe you can meet skywagon and then he can harass you too. When he can't be out fishing or flying he gets a little kermunchity. Pooch"
2379721,Skywagon,2014-01-24 06:05:00,1106,"Pooch, Since this new information has come to light (we now know who Carnhzkr is) I think you may have met your match. It is a well known fact that Slim Shady is part of the Scuzz Twittly group. I won't post a link to his Utube video ""Keep Yer Hands Off My PBR"" but would suggest you look it up and judge for yourself. This may get interesting enough I may have to come over and witness this first hand."

2380145,Pooch,2014-01-24 07:52:00,4619,Who is Honest Pod? Man you guys are really confusing me. I might need need to double up on my meds to keep up with this bunch.Decatur huh? ADM still going to bail out of there? Leaving their processing I assume (hope)? Send the suits to Chicago?Pooch
2380417,elkman99,2014-01-24 09:17:00,180,"The world hq's are moving to Chicago, but the plant will stay here. Honest Pod was a legendary used car salesman back in the 70's and 80's here in Decatur. He drove a pink cadillac and wore these funky plaid suits LOL."
2380577,Carnhzkr,2014-01-24 09:59:00,964,"Skywagon said you played loud rap music, so I assumed you spoke urban gangsta. Slim Shady (aka Eminem) is the only raper that came to mind. 40s are 40 ounce beers popular in ""the hood"". Know what I'm say'n? I'm fluent in Farm Boy too, so I'll speak that from now on. Okie dokie?"
2380953,Pooch,2014-01-24 12:11:00,4619,Okie Dokie!So explain to the rest of us how you know so much about rap and forty ounce hooch?The only guys I know that speak urban are my cop friends or young dudes.What is a Carnhzkr? Pooch
2385585,Steve Ediger,2014-01-26 08:20:00,97,"Pooch & Carnhzkr, It looks like I will be at LSL the two weeks before you get there. We will be there June 7 - 21. I have been fishing out of LSL for the past fifteen years or so and have found my share (plus a few ) of hazards. I got to know the prop repair guy in Ear Falls quite well my first few years up there. There are a few hazards in Rat Bay, Otter Bay, and the two bays before you get into the Bay of Islands or Farewell Bay but Rod and Lorita do a good job of keeping them marked with jugs. Rod will be able to tell you if the water is high enough to use the short cut into the bay of islands. If it is high enough, just take your time, and stay pretty much in the middle of the channel and close to the standing tree (you will know it when you see it) and you should be fine. One good thing, the hazards in the short cut are trees, not rock. Trees seem to be much more forgiving. There are several large reefs in the Bay of islands and depending on the water depth, you may not be able to see them until it's too late. They are marked on both paper and electronic maps quite well. It's the ones not marked that scare the crap out of you when you see them. If you would like, I can mark up a couple of maps with the hazards I know of, and leave them with Rod and Lorita so you have them when you get there. Good Luck, Steve"
2386161,Pooch,2014-01-26 11:13:00,4619,"I'll take you up on that map thing for sure!LS fishes differently than any other lake we fish. Lots more sand and transition areas. Far more hazards than any lake I've been on over the years.I'm using a navionics chip in one of my HDS units and it helps, but there is a lot of nasties that are not on the chip. Also using Tracmaps, but they too are lacking a lot of detail. Wish there was a way to share data with the map makers to continually update current map data. I thought Navionics had a way of using community data, but I don't know anything about it.LS also fluctuates as the season goes on and that alone will keep the wary on their toes when moving through an unfamiliar area.I've got a set of aerial photos of Lake Savant that are great. Wanted to do the same for Lac Seul, but the MNR raised the price to $25 for each photo. It would cost many hundreds of dollars just to get the areas I want to fish.

2377313,Pooch,2014-01-23 12:39:00,4619,"I've booked my wife and myself in this camp for our first trip this summer. I've not stayed at this camp before, but the people who own the camp were quite nice on the phone with us. We are well adapted to fishing Canada, but a new camp makes for a nice change of pace for us.Looking at the maps of that area it looks like you need to go through a couple narrow and shallow areas to reach the main lake. Are these areas as shallow as they appear on TracMaps? What about rocks and other hazards in that entire area? I've been through shanty narrows and that is a nasty area. Lac Seul seems to have a lot of hazards as the water fluctuates throughout the season.Anyone willing to share a map of hazards that you are aware of? A map would be great. I'm not looking for your hot spots, just trying to avoid grief when fishing with my wife.We will be there the end of June through the first week of July. By chance anyone else going to be there at that time?Pooch"
2377569,Carnhzkr,2014-01-23 13:44:00,964,"I'm booked in to LSL that same week, although I've asked Lorita to move us up a week or two earlier if they get a cancellation. Sorry, I can't help with the hazards, since this is my first time staying at the lodge too. Last year, I stayed at their Sunlight outpost the first week of August. When the water's high enough, there's a shortcut to take you out to the Bay of Islands. Rod said it's not open early in the season, but would likely be open when we're there. It could be shallow in that spot, but I think the remainder of the channel going out from the lodge should be fine. Come to think of it, I remember seeing at least one plastic jug in the channel, marking a hazard. I think once you make it through the shortcut and you're in the Bay of Islands, you're on your own. If you get a map marking hazards, I'd appreciate if you'd share with me too. I don't think the Garmin maps are that accurate, and I'd hate to ruin a prop - or worse."
2377625,drlee,2014-01-23 13:53:00,409,"The journey to the main lake is really not difficult. One route, it would be to the right on your map as you head toward the main lake, is only open when the water is fairly high. The opening to the left is always open and is well marked with ""cans"" or ""bouys."" Simply ask the dock person which route to take. We could get through both ways, but the easier/safer passage is the one that is marked."
2377713,wallydave,2014-01-23 14:07:00,2151,"Pooch, check with Mike Kansas, he has a group that fishes out of LSL, they mostly fish out of the Outpost, but he fished from the main camp too."
2377809,dutchboy,2014-01-23 14:26:00,5717,"Take a couple cans of that aerosol spray stuff in case you need to patch the boat with a screen door. Sorry, brain freeze might be setting in."
2377953,Skywagon,2014-01-23 14:56:00,1106,"My condolences Carnhzkr, that Pooch parties all night and plays loud rap music. You will never get any sleep. I hear that is why he is banned from the last camp he stayed at."
2378025,Pooch,2014-01-23 15:18:00,4619,"Skywagon, you are not helping things here at all! Besides that, why are you not out poking holes in the ice instead of harassing us flatlanders?Hey, we're getting all of your Canadian cold stuff down here. Grave diggers said two foot of frost in the ground. Could be a problem for any too shallow water lines.What's happening up your way for snow?Gotta go work on my new bigger boom box for next summers trip. Wonder which cabin Carnhzkr is gonna be in. I've got this really long extension cord....Wanna meet up again next summer so I can show you guys how it's done?Pooch"
2378193,SinOrSwim,2014-01-23 15:52:00,1528,We go to Onaway which I believe is just to the south of LSL. We take the route almost straight out from our camp which would be to the right of yours. It seems like it might be shallow but it is not and you can go through that little narrow very quickly. There are some stumps etc but they are visible.
2378361,Skywagon,2014-01-23 16:37:00,1106,"Pooch, Lot of snow here, breaking trails with the snow machine always involves getting stuck this year. Picking my days to fish, as it has been unusually chilly, with more days -0 F than not. Heading for the Upper Manitou tomorrow to feed minnows to the trout, supposed to reach a balmy +16 F, will probably wear my speedo's. Think you will like your location on the lake better this year than where you were your first trip last year. Don't worry about those rocks, since the value of the loony is going down, your net cost of a lower unit will be less this year."
2378753,Carnhzkr,2014-01-23 18:36:00,964,"Sounds like my kind of party! They call me Slim Shady. I'll bring a couple 40s, know what I'm say'n?"
