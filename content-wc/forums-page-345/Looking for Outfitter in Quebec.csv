2397657,feathersandfins,2014-01-29 08:12:00,10,"We're planning a fishing trip to Quebec this summer (Aug 2014). Looking for decent fishing (plenty of walleye to catch in the 15 - 22 inch range with a lunker or two a day, pike, lake trout). Want to be within a day's drive of Upstate NY (no more than 10 hours).Looking for a nice cabin (no need for electricity, but don't want to sleep with mice) well distanced from other cabins (outpost?).Looked into Taggart Lodge (Lake Kipawa), but read too much bad press about it. Also the fishing is not reported to be that great. Looked at O'Sullivan Lake, heard mostly good things.Headed to Harrisburg next week to look at more outfitters.Any recommendations?"

2398553,Freytown,2014-01-29 12:44:00,770,La Pointe aux Dor√©s Outfitter is my favorite in Quebec. The good weeks get booked fast. Email is returned quickly. Give them a look. PS: No lakers thohttp://www.pointe-aux-dores.com/en/apropos.shtml

2400305,keek,2014-01-29 19:40:00,1003,My experience with Air Tamarac was amazing. Spent a week on Lake Hebert riding around in Lund boats with brand new merc. outboards. Fishing was superb. The lake is big enough to give you room but easy enough to get to know it well in a week. The cabins are very nice as well.
2400321,keek,2014-01-29 19:41:00,1003,Here is a video of Hebert I put together:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiPCqmilG3I
2400841,Andre (wallyandre),2014-01-30 02:41:00,2274,But no lakers.
2407737,F250,2014-02-01 05:29:00,75,"Stramond Lake Lodge. Walleyes, pike, Lakers. We have been there dozens of times when it was owned by Austin and Madelene Gagne. New owners have torn down, and rebuilt the camp with new cabins. This will be our first stay with them. We are booked for mid June. Stramond Lake (Lake des Augustines on some maps) is off the road into O'Sullivan. About an 11 hour drive from the Champlain NY border crossing. The last leg of the trip is on about 60 miles of gravel road."
