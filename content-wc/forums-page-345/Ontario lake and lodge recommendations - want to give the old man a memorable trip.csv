2373489,iowafishingdude,2014-01-22 09:30:00,9,"Thanks again all, checking out the Lac Seul and LOTW lodges. Hopefully I can find a place with open dates. We had a great time at Ghost River Lodges (it's a boat-in) in the Sioux Lookout area several years ago in case anyone is familiar with them...good walleye fishing. I also do photography and filming, very scenic area."

2374457,NARDA 1,2014-01-22 15:48:00,636,Check out www.birchdalelodge.com on Eagle Lake. This was caught this year while jigging for walleye.....
2395929,luv2fishcanada,2014-01-28 17:53:00,41,Take a good look at goldenhookcamp on Gullrock. Been going there since 1981. Not a bad drive and a great resort with reasonable prices. New owners last year that treat you very well.
2368321,iowafishingdude,2014-01-20 15:54:00,9,"Hey guys,Was hoping to get some recommendations on some great lakes and mid-priced lodges to bring a small group of friends and family to this year. For years I have had to postpone our annual fishing trip because of school and work, but no longer! Previously we've stayed in some smaller lodges around Dryden/Eagle Lake and have been as far north as Lac Seul, but this a long time ago and am open to about anywhere (although Lac Seul was pushing it for distance). Have had some inconsistent experiences over the years (good fishing but bad service, great service but bad fishing) and would really like to find a spot that we could settle in to for a long while. Catching ""the big one"" has always been our top goal, but really looking for a place that offers a great all-around experience, reliable fishing, and lots to experience (and even better if it's a bit off the beaten path )Anyway, thank you very much for reading this and sharing your thoughts. Really want to do best by my father, although it did feel good finally one-upping his 30.5"" marble eye with a 31"" of my own last summer at a friend's farm pond Feel free to pm me or e-mail me too: [email protected]-PatrickEDIT: Should probably have posted that we are on a bit of a budget too ha probably can't spend much more than 850/person. We do have our own boat, which can help with cost."
2368473,Pikeslayer8,2014-01-20 16:26:00,1460,"This is where I'd go. http://www.moosepointlodge.com/ Amazing fishery on Shikag Lake, guided American plan. Take Dad there."
2368945,Pooch,2014-01-20 18:35:00,4619,"Most all of the popular and more affordable camps are booked solid even though this is only January. Especially on Lac Seul. Some camps in or near to Ear Falls may yet have openings.Your price range makes a lot of drive in camps available, if you could have started sooner.Search the web and see who might still have an opening for your size group then re-post on this forum for guys experience with the camp or camps.There is some pretty good fishing on Rainy Lake and numerous camps. For what you are asking for, I'd take a look there asap. Rainy is on my radar, but I've not got there yet.Red Lake area too far? Red Lake itself and Gull Rock are popular and good fisheries.Good luck.Pooch"
2369249,iowafishingdude,2014-01-20 20:37:00,9,"Pooch, Thanks for the heads up! And yes I am a bit behind...just moved from NYC to Des Moines about three weeks ago so this wasn't an option until very recent. Hope I can still snag a September date somewhere if I can't find any May dates. Red Lake might be a bit too far, but will definitely look in to it. I've heard a lot of great things about Nungesser Lake which is even farther north, but ""worth the drive"", or so I've been told. Any word on that area? Will do some browsing around Rainy Lake, thank you"
2369345,BreezyPoint,2014-01-20 21:00:00,1581,"You should also consider Lake of the Woods on the Canadian side near Morson. Great multi-species fishery and the opportunity to feel very remote if you want to. I think there are fish at your doorstep at every lodge in that area. 250 miles closer than Ear Falls. Plenty of reasonable lodges to choose from, both drive in and boat in.It's right on the US border and I don't think you can find Ontario fishing much closer than that."
2369353,btmbncr,2014-01-20 21:03:00,492,sent you an email.Bill
2369545,Tamarack,2014-01-20 23:05:00,16,"We will definitely fit your needs. Remote, affordable and excellent fishing. Lots of numbers with real big fish potential and at least 6 multiple species to boot. We are closer than you think. We are also set up great for your own boat too with electrical at the dock and assigned docking.We own Tamarack Island Wilderness Lodge, and we bend over backwards for our customers. Other remotes in our general area, are Obabikon Bay, Grassy Narrows and Spruce Island.Good luck and feel free to contact me if you have any questions at all.Tight lines;Todd"
2369585,roscoe33,2014-01-21 00:10:00,653,"We have been to many resorts over the years. Used to travel to Eagle Lake and Lac Seul, then started working our way east. First the Ignace area, and more recently the Upsala area. We prefer housekeeping cabins, no meals, and take our own boats. Went to check out a half dozen resorts on Lac des Mille a few years ago, and to our surprise, hit on a nice quaint little place at a bargain price.http://www.lacdesmille.com/index.html on the west end of the lake. $310 per person, for the week. Their rental boats are basic fishing boats. We rent a slip to keep our boats in, for $80. THe lake is 60,000 acres, but you don't need to go far to fill the cooler. Northern, walleye, smallmouth, and perch. 690 miles from Des Moines."
2370153,camp chef,2014-01-21 08:20:00,915,"Try WWW.Bignorthlodge.com on the Winnipeg river. Great fishing. chance for big walleyes, muskie,pike and Smallies. Great accomodations as well."
2370313,BreezyPoint,2014-01-21 09:08:00,1581,"You might also want to look at Red Wing Lodge out of Morson. Drive to, great fishing nearby. I caught four muskies there last year within sight of the camp.http://www.redwinglodge.net"
