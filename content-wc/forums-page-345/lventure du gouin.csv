The cabins are well spaced apart, no surprises when we got there and the couple who own it are nice and helpful (I cant remember their names for the life of me). Fishing was ok only because we had never fished walleye before and we got there 2 days after ice out. I would recommend them for your trip. We still go to the Gouin just a different outfitter."
