2748513,kzoofisher,2014-05-01 17:20:00,5144,"I don't count fish except for two and those are the ones in the livewell. Having said that, action is a part of why I go to Canada. All of the ingredients of a Canada trip (scenic beauty, quiet, fish, camaraderie, wildlife) are available to me elsewhere, but only in Canada are they available all in one place. I don't need or expect to catch 80-100 fish every day, but I do expect to catch 40-60 most days and I sure like the days when we get 'em non-stop. I don't need or expect to catch half a dozen 6# or bigger each day, but I don't mind getting some big ones. It's a fishing trip and I want to catch fish. More than that I want to catch them on jigs and shield lakes are the place to go for consistent jig bites. I can get drunk at home or at my cabin. I can catch a lot of fish, big ones and of more species right here in Michigan. I can spend quality time with my kids in the same places. I can have a family trip to Quebec, New Brunswick and Maine and bond with them. We can go to the Pigeon River Country or the Sylvania Wilderness and not see anyone else for days while we see elk and eagles and bears and moose and loons and otters and.... you get the picture. The OP asked how many fish a day qualifies as good fishing, if the answer was zero I wouldn't bother going to Canada at all. Some days the fishing is better, some days it's worse, but there has to be that expectation that it will be better on average. Some of the places I've gone have fallen short fish wise, others had plenty of fish but lacked other ingredients. One of these days I'll find the one that is perfect but until then I'll continue to enjoy the search."

2749401,rockrunner,2014-05-01 21:16:00,205,"It's surprising what qualifies as a good day on the water. I am from Northern Ontario and I have a different spin on this. I feel if your on a lake that offers 150 fish days then your not on a lake that I want to fish. What exactly is the challenge ? Lakes like that, which I am familiar with do not challenge my ability as a walleye fisherman. They do not allow my electronics to work for me. Don't get me wrong if I was coming up to Canada from a office job and was going to fish for a week and go back to work until next year then maybe I would want that 150 fish day experience but if your on this site then your probably more avid than that. I want to be challenged, that's more important to me. I want to be on the lake trying to figure out the bite, do I bottom bounce , pull cranks , rock run, vertically jig etc...worms,minnows leeches etc... What depth are they at etc... I camp on a lake where most don't know there are walleye in it. What I like about it is the fact that it's always challenging but at the same time I have enough tricks in the bag to break the code on the lake 95 % of the time. I started camping on this lake with my wife 9 years ago she has been on the lake fishing it avid with her dad and family for 25+ years. When I take her out with the kids and she says, hey I have never fished here before or I have never fished this presentation or the best one was...if I didn't know I was on this lake, I would swear that I was on a flyin. THAT IS A GOOD DAY TO ME. That's when you know you have put together your experience and knowledge of walleye fishing not when you can pull up to any given wind blowin point and score a 150 walleye. My buddies and I get a charge out of going to not so popular walleye waters or big time cottage lakes and pound walleye like were on some flyin fishing trip on some lake in the middle of know where , while sitting in our Lund Pro V and in comfort. I'm not a big fan of catching walleye that are under 14"" or over 18"" I know where there are big fish and stay clear of those ares . I have no desire to crank in 25-30 inch walleye. When it comes to numbers , as long as I'm getting entertained with a fish every 5-10 min. we're all good. That's just my spin on what is rewarding to me as a walleye fisherman."
2750089,v-bay gord,2014-05-02 06:59:00,3168,"I lean to your point of view RR. I want every fish I catch to be entertaining in some way (challenge, technique, new spot, etc)....not just fish number 79 or 105. Of course we are spoilt living where we do, and for the poor city angler who only experiences it for a week then numbers might be more meaningful. Yes, and what about those pesky 30 inchers..."
2750257,tv4fish,2014-05-02 07:42:00,2694,"Yes, you two are spoiled --- I think you get ""all kinds"" of guys coming up to your great fishing country for a lot of different reasons. For my group of 3 - it is the opportunity to spend a week together and ""catch up"" on what has been going on in our lives over the past year AND have some good fishing. That is something that we do not do otherwise. When we go to Canada on our annual trip - it's something that we have to PLAN. That doesn't happen any other time of the year since we don't live close to each other."
2783001,Kenny_Ross,2014-05-11 19:25:00,103,"Here in Sk I would think a good day is 20-30 per day with avg around 16"". When we go to NW Ontario the no.s are much higher (80-100 per day) with avg around the 20"" mark. The difference is in Sk the big fish of the day is usually bigger than our biggest of day in Ont."
2786641,MuskyMaster,2014-05-12 15:52:00,79,"10 years ago we found a hot spot on the chapleau river in 7fow just jigging, 3 guys in the boat would catch 100 in the morning and 100 at night total without a problem. Then a few years ago my uncle and i were jigging at windemere and it was another 100 fish day with the only problem being we couldn't catch one small enough to keep. Didn't catch any over 5lbs but still a great day. Those are my definitons of a great day of fishing, now i would take one 8+lber over 100 small ones any day."
2798369,CMesserschmidt,2014-05-15 11:58:00,1006,"We had the same question last year. We always heard people say ""200-300 fish a day per person""..... I have been to Canada a few times and I just say BS!!!We had golf shot clickers in the boat, one for each of us, so we kept track of our fish for a couple days just for chits.....Now granted we're not ones to get up at the *** crack of dawn and get out, but we're usually fishing by 8:30-9am and go till the fish stop biting which is usually about 3:30.The first day we didn't use clicker counters, so I would assumed 75-100 fish for me alone and my buddy and his dad agreed.The next day we used the clicker counters and averaged 41 fish per person.Which doesn't seem like a lot, but when you think of setting the hook, fighting the fish, netting, getting the hook out, measuring and a picture, then re-baiting and dropping your jig down only to wait another 30-seconds to a minute or 2 for another fish its amazing that it makes sense.It felt like it was fish after fish after fish, but all that fun stuff in between fish takes up time and really skewed reality.After 2 days of clickers I stopped using them. My hands are so beat to crap from gill plates, dorsal fins and teeth, that my average 41 fish a day is plenty for me. Yeah you get disappointed when you run out of bait but by then I am ready to head in.Get some golf shot clickers to see how your numbers really stack up... I bet you would be surprised. They're cheap to.... like $3-4$ at Wal-Mart."
2798585,MrSimon,2014-05-15 13:20:00,922,So you are only fishing from 8:30 till 3? I bet you could triple your numbers by starting earlier and by fishing the evening bite. But I do agree with you that 40+ fish a day is more than enough .... and its not all about numbers.
2816849,tooski,2014-05-20 14:43:00,393,You must attend a Browns game. After one of those you'll never miscount again.

The counting is done by both people in the boat, It may be hard for some of you guys who run out of fingers and toes, Mr Simon is correct in zeroing in on the bite takes Yrs. My 11th yr on the same fly to. There are spots on the lake if you miss by 50' you will get nothing. If you never had such a trip with that many fish I suggest you put it on your bucket list, My trip next yr will be the same week, contact me and I will show you personally Next yr.I can only speak for Quebec You will not find better fishing than on Lac Hebert"
2818801,P&y only,2014-05-21 05:46:00,133,"Thanks Jack! Someone who got it. Most of my stories in Canada involve a particular fish, or a bear, or a moose. I truly love the wild outdoors. I do NOT go to Canada to count fish. But if some guy drove 12-14 hours up there and is catching a dozen fish on a ""good"" day, I thought this post might help him realize what Canada is REALLY capable of. Why fish in a dry hole when theres better fishing up the road a few miles. So now that we know how many a ""LOT"" is, let's hear everyones bear story!"
2819801,Guest,2014-05-21 10:17:00,0,"""I've fished several places in Canada. Some better than others. Everybody says ""we caught a lot of walleyes"" But the term ""a lot"" seems to vary immensely. So, my 2 questions are these: 1) When they are biting good, how many do you think you catch in one day? 2) How long is the ""average"" fish you catch? Talking walleyes here. Thanks for replies. Feel free to withhold your fishing spot. I'm not after your honey hole. Just want to do some comparing. "" In my younger years a lot of fish would be 100-150 per day with three people. However, i find that fishing to get very boring rather quickly. Now I only fish lakes where you have shot at true trophy (28+) on every bite. On my favorite lake 25 fish/day with three guys is a lot!"
2799873,mudpusher,2014-05-15 20:14:00,248,only tell the truth when a lie won't fit
2812113,rockape,2014-05-19 12:09:00,215,"We never count. Except once. We hit a walleye sanctuary at 9am the day it opened. We counted for 1 hour, and my partner and I boated 56. I then switched to hunting BIG gators. Success there too. A few have mentioned it in this string. I like the adventure and the whole experience. I always try new spots, new lures, and new techniques. And that pays off BIG TIME. Sometimes I drop my jig to the bottom, crank up 1 turn, and lie down for a nap with my rod in my hand. Always fun truly fighting fish in your sleep! If you have a hot walleye bite that stops suddenly, it usually means a big pike or musky is in the area. I always put down my walleye rod, and start casting the big stuff when this happens. And I usually catch a larger sized gator. I love NW Ontario. I want to catch a decent amount of fish, and big fish too. I always have. But I also want to enjoy the company of my friends, have some good laughs, and create new memories to talk about on future trips. In 4 weeks, I'll be there!"
2812337,Draco1206,2014-05-19 13:04:00,175,"I think we all go to NWO and especially outposts for many different reasons. One of them being to catch more fish than we can normally catch at home. I think counting fish is a barometer only for how the fishing is compared to previous years and how you personally are doing compared to the rest of the group (maybe you're not doing as good as everyone and need to change your methods, or maybe you are doing better then everyone else and need to share your secrets) not a bragging rite. Counting fish and the number, whether high or low has never been a measure for me on how good the trip was. My brother and I once decided to try and catch 100 walleyes one day, we did it but it took all day and I have to say it wasn't that much fun. I have enjoyed some tremendous fishing in my lifetime, from Canada to Alaska to North Carolina to the Florida keys and in my home state of Michigan, and I have also had some horrible fishing days (numbers wise) in those same places. I have never thought that the number of fish is what made the trip a good one or a bad one. There are so many other factors that matter more to me. Number one is just being out there, seeing and enjoying the outdoors. Waking up at the crack of dawn and listening to the loons cry. Watching the sunrise and set. Seeing deer, bears, moose, otter, wolves, lynx and bobcats. Things that most people never see because they are not out there. Number two is being with the friends and family that enjoy those same things. I can only feel pity for those that have never enjoyed the outdoors. We still count our fish every year and post the results on the wall or piece of driftwood for others to see but to answer the question : How many walleyes does it take to make a good trip? I would answer: zero!"
2814273,Jack77,2014-05-20 04:36:00,168,"I know that I shouldn't kick this dead horse but I feel the need to get something straight. The orginal post never asked how many walleye made for a good trip or how many walleye made for a good day. He wanted to quantify what catching ""a lot"" of walleye meant to different people, I have often wondered that myself. Unfortunanley this simple question was mis construed by some as a way to quantify what a good day meant and that poster even went on to apply his confusion to all americans in general. I admit that I got caught up in it as well. All of this becasue the guy wanted to know what ""a lot"" meant, not what a good day meant. I enjoyed reading what a good day meant to everyone, I think it is safe to say that most of us on this forum just enjoy the northern Canadian wilderness."
2815097,rockape,2014-05-20 08:12:00,215,50 walleyes in one day for one person is a lot.
2815225,muskyroller,2014-05-20 08:30:00,56,"35 to 50 constitutes a lot in my opinion... 15 to 20 pike and one over 36 is a lot in my opinion... To me, that would be a lot AND a very good day. Time with family, scenery, beer, etc. is all great but I'm not spending a week away from my girls to not catch fish. Always funny when I hear ""caught our limit."" I hope you did...you're in Canada, not some Metro lake."

With two guys in a boat,If we do not catch 100 walleyes in a day its just a so so day, 150 is a good day, 200 is a great day,250 to300 is something that most fishermen only dream about,But has been done on this lake, Last yr the first week in July I set a personal best for the week over 900+ walleye,Thats an average of 130 a day for me. Lac Hebert is a vertual walleye factory,Being only spring fed,only brooks and rivers flow out of the lake. On our last night my friend and I caught 28 walleye in a 100yd drift in less than 15 mins At which point we stopped fishing headed for the cabin for a few Cubins and some Bleue, We sat and smoked and drank not believing what just happened at the end of our trip.The beauty of your trip is in the eye of the beholder,as long as your trip lives up to your expectations.

So I guess to answer the original question I would say anywhere from 30-50 walleyes a day would be ""a lot"" in Canada in my opinion."
2816513,MrSimon,2014-05-20 12:51:00,922,"I think its important to mention that there are also days when the fishing stinks and catching double digits is a chore and a half. And, we can't just lump all lakes in Canada together. Comparing a remote fly-in lake with excellent habitat to a so-so lake along the side of the highway isn't a fair comparison. Also, it often takes years of going to the same lake over and over to dial-in the technique and spots before you can rack up triple digit days like people are talking about. Not always, but usually."

2734169,Guest,2014-04-28 17:45:00,0,"On the Cabonga Reservoir in Quebec during the good years when they didn't mess with the water level, we would have our traveling fish, 6 at around 20 inches after the first day. We didn't keep count after that because we switched to lake trout and pike. We never went for numbers but enjoyed seeing different parts of the reservoir and on occasion seeing some really neat wildlife. But in the end it comes down to catching walleye and when they messed with the water level, it killed the walleye and pike fishing we enjoyed. I hope to go back some day and relieve past trips."
2734225,LoDo,2014-04-28 18:00:00,721,"Agree with all this we fish a primarily private lake (only three cabins) and never have an issue catching walleyes. Pre, during or post spawn, bring it on! I can't imagine there are more than 500 fisherman on this lake annually. We often times like to explore new areas which may damper our walleye count, but sometimes exploring is part of the NWO experience. Last year, second week of June, a few of us starting fishing new spots and absolutely crushed walleyes in spots that were never marked on the ""hot spot map"". 23 days and counting! Still need some warm weather!"
2734409,jimmie,2014-04-28 18:56:00,123,"I usually fish alone and on one occasion I caught 49 'eyes and another fish in just over two hours over a sunken reef. I'll let you guess what the other fish was to end my run of good luck ? Some guuys brag about how as a group they caught 125/150 walleyes in a day. Others the 30 incher. To me I brag about the great day I had on the water and the adventure that I enjoyed. I keep track somewhat in general for future reference. Just recall one of my first trips to Lac Seul and came upon what I affectionately refer to as hole ""49"". Oddly enough I stop by this area every trip and once in a great while I'll catch an 'eye. Never repeated my luck that day in such a short period of time. I hunt for the bigeer ones now. My largest has been 28 1/2"" 'eye and 20 1/2"" smallie and 39 1/2"" Northern to date. So much water so little time. Gudied boats have topped 125 many times for four people but after shore lunch they more often than not throw spoons for big pike."
2734714,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-28 19:50:00,1460,"That's what she said! Sorry Sin, you just put it on a tee! Lol I pretty much agree with everything said on this thread about good days on a good Canadian lake. 100 fish days are not uncommon but I can think of a few times up there so extraordinary, so spectacular that I dare even tell. The time was 23 years ago on my honeymoon trip to Shikag. My wife and I portaged into this little lake off Shikag called Ted's Lake. Twas one of those deals where the fish would bite anything. We were both using Fuzzy Grubs tipped with crawler and couldn't get our respective jigs to the bottom. Wasn't long before we tired of putting on crawler and still couldn't hit bottom. Was so fast and furious that in no time at all, the walleye ate the plastic bodies off the jigs. Still didn't hardly make a difference. I'd venture to say that as a boat, we caught 500 fish that day but nothing over 16""."
2734746,walleye IA,2014-04-28 19:53:00,129,"This a good topic. I have wounder the same thing. I remember a time when the bite was so good. I used a jig tipped with a Slim Jim, and one after anther. We still laugh about that day.These 80-100 fish day are spacial!"
2734922,billy weaver,2014-04-28 20:25:00,470,"I have been fishing north-west Ontario for nearly 30 years, 26 years at the same camp. While I consider myself an average fisherman at best there are areas where we catch 60 to 80 walleye a day, average 18 to 22"" is the norm. While this a good area I don't feel it will give me a 30""+ fish. There is another area that gives me few if any fish but one was 31 1/2"". I always give it some time every year. (one fish is all I want). In later years I take out one day for smallmouth and one for pike. THIS WILL BE THE YEAR 5TH WEEK OF THE SEASON."
2735410,Jack77,2014-04-29 05:44:00,168,"Nothing new to add really but I agree with the majority of posts. 100 walleye a day per guy is a good day. Last time up to Brace Lake we actually had a difficult time catching fish below 18"" to eat, most were between 18- 24"". We will sometime get bored catching fish after fish in spots and go hunting new spots or troll just to take a break. An average day would be somewhere between 60-80 fish a day. We do take a long shore lunch break every day just to get together to compare notes and plan the afternoon. I would agree that if you are only catching your limit than you need to find a new place to fish. We can fish off the dock at our outfitter and catch a limit in 20 minutes. The record off the dock is 47 casts with 47 walleye in a row."
2735442,P&y only,2014-04-29 06:02:00,133,Hopefully this post will help someone see that they should try other places if they are only catching a few each day. Canada has so much to offer. Just be sure to treat the resource with respect.
2735474,troutwater,2014-04-29 06:14:00,299,"This is a great thread. I've always wanted to do a fly in sometime, but really have no idea what to expect....or where to go for that matter. What are some of the outfitters everyone has used?"
2735522,prov1800,2014-04-29 06:19:00,5010,"As a guide the last thing I would want to do is count fish every day.I usually loose track aftet 6-7 fish.some of my guests have counters but you still have to remember to click the counter.doesnt matter which lake I happen to be on a particular day my routine is 10 dozen minnows a day for 2-3 guests and myself.sometimes we run out of bait by 1 or 2 in the afternoon or some days we have some left, everyday day is different, depending on weather or wind conditions, some days I fish lakes that are hard to catch to catch walleye but the ones we catch are huge, so we dont catch to many that day, but every one takes about having had a great day, I guess everyone has different ideas about a day of fishing.if goal is to boat 100 a day you could be in fora lot of ddisappointments."
2731913,P&y only,2014-04-28 08:57:00,133,"I've fished several places in Canada. Some better than others. Everybody says ""we caught a lot of walleyes"" But the term ""a lot"" seems to vary immensely.So, my 2 questions are these:1) When they are biting good, how many do you think you catch in one day?2) How long is the ""average"" fish you catch? Talking walleyes here. Thanks for replies. Feel free to withhold your fishing spot. I'm not after your honey hole. Just want to do some comparing."
2731953,The Donger,2014-04-28 09:08:00,48,"I catch enough that after about five days I am trying to find something in my tackle box that won't catch fish just for the heck of it. I never keep count but it is pretty difficult to catch fewer than 20 per day on a decent lake and 40+ is probably the norm if you are trying at all. We catch plenty of eaters and a whole bunch over 20"" and I think the largest one of our crew has caught is 27"". Catching walleyes in NW Ontario is not a problem."
2731993,Ranger319,2014-04-28 09:14:00,166,"1) On a good bite, average would be 100 Walleyes or so a person. Have had times when that number was closer to 150 walleyes per person. Typical day with 2 in my boat we catch around 100-125 walleyes total. If I get on a crankbait bite, especially casting, that number can increase pretty quick. On the flip side of that, we've had 2 seperate weeks were the 2 of us didn't catch 150 total for the week! 2) Average size is about 21"". For the past 4-5 years, we've had troubles finding fish below the slot. Towards the end of the week we had to change our approach and search for smaller fish. Still no 10lb or 30"" walleye...yet!"
2732001,Golden Eagle,2014-04-28 09:16:00,2642,"Anything over half a ton for two guys on a 7 day trip would be flirting with ""a lot of walleyes""."
2732097,Mike Kansas,2014-04-28 09:45:00,1463,"Best I have ever seen was on a fly in with eight of us. The place we went to was a river with 5 lakes attached to it. The water was 10' low and the Walleye had moved out of the lakes into the river and we literally caught eyes all day every day. 20 to 25 fish per hour per man was the norm. Actually tried to find spots that we had to ""fish"" for them instead of just setting hooks and pulling them in. Worst ever was two of us only caught 170 in 5 days. Average fish runs 20"" and biggest ever was 35"". Mike Kansas"
2732145,LoDo,2014-04-28 09:56:00,721,"Lets assume two in a boat x 10hrs/daily. I'd say ""a lot"" is 80+ combined fish per day. With all the props hitting rocks, lines in the motor, snags, lost tackle, birds nest in spoils, casting lines that get caught on shore, moving around, drinking, laughs, etc... 8+ fish per hour is pretty solid. That's two every 15mins! Now, we have had our moments where we are catching a fish every cast. Insane! Avg fish is 21"". The largest walleyes caught within our group is 28-30""."
2733465,SinOrSwim,2014-04-28 15:18:00,1528,"I have never kept count. For us, it's one of those we know it when we see it. For instance, some think great fishing is 100 per day. I can't imagine a ton of those fish are 20-22"" or bigger. But, then again if you catch fewer fish in a day but most of those are 22"" to 27"" that is a very good day.Say you fish 10 hours per day. I don't know how one catches 10 fish per hour for 10 straight hours? One fish every 6 minutes??? You have snags, you have to move around, drive in and out to your spot, bait hooks, take fish out of nets etc. Unless you find a spot where you are essentially dipping it down and pulling them out like you would perch or bluegills. But, my guess is those fish aren't very big.So, it's not about numbers or size alone. It's a combination or the two."
2733569,kzoofisher,2014-04-28 15:41:00,5144,"Total numbers depends entirely on how many hours you fish, but I would say that averaging 6-8 fish per hour is a good day. There will be that lull where you are looking for a school and that flurry where you are pulling them in so fast you never put the net away and it will average out fine. I don't think you can pile up the numbers as fast trolling as you can casting cranks or jig and plastic, there's just too much time reeling them in from 100' back and re-rigging to put one in the boat every 8 minutes, let alone every three or four minutes when you are on a shallow water bite. On the other hand, some days are insane and defy explanation. It's really good to have one or two of those each trip."
2733705,P&y only,2014-04-28 16:07:00,133,"I mostly asked so others could see the numbers. I know the place I went to first, years ago I thought was awesome because I could limit out most days. After trying different places I soon learned that that place was a waste of my time and money. But if you have nothing better to compare it to, you might think you are in a good place when in reality you are not. The place I go now is Soooo much better. 6-8 walleyes an hour would be easy to do in late may and early June. EASY to do. But I can't stay there all day knowing theres 40"" pike and 5 lbs smallmouth swimming around. I just wish I had known that the first place wasn't (normal) Canada fishing a little sooner. Thought this might help others avoid the same."
2733969,bigwalleye1,2014-04-28 16:57:00,2632,"""because I could limit out most days"" Glad your criteria has changed. I've done that while waiting for the other boat to quit dinking around and get moving in the morning. Seriously, though, for numbers, my target is 100 walleyes per day for my boat (2 guys). Usually allows for a nice mix of eaters, over slots and a few hawgs (27+) Most days, we're pretty close. Every once in a while, there are those days where you'll talk about it as long as you walk the earth, but that's another thread...."
