2763833,Freytown,2014-05-06 12:03:00,770,"""The maximum capacity level of the Gouin reservoir is 405.08 meters. At 403.15 meters, as of yesterday, it is therefore almost full""This message was from Hydro-Quebec..BTW, 60 degrees for the next 10days...bye, bye ice."
2763897,East coast,2014-05-06 12:30:00,32,"Awesome, thanks Freytown. I've been following some comments on QUEBECPECHE.com and it sounds like it will be close for the opener on the 16th. We are not there until the 29th, so we should be fine. The Pike fishing (our main target) was amazing last year. High water into the blueberry bushes and top water weedless lures makes for entertainment you can't beat anywhere. Largest landed fish last year came in at 47"""
2763953,East coast,2014-05-06 12:44:00,32,"Did you e-mail hydro quebec directly or is there a link to find out about the water levels? Thats still 5 feet from full, i wonder how it compares to the first of June last year???"
2764577,Freytown,2014-05-06 15:44:00,770,"Hi, I went to their website and asked my question...reply came to me by email. Last year reservoir was at max in spring. I think with all the melting snow & rain it will continue to rise. But even at these current levels you will be able to go just about anywhere. I will be there 5/30. Good luck."

2813225,octanehi5,2014-05-19 17:34:00,1104,"Hi Freytown, I saw a little ice left in the north east corner of the Gouin today, It will have no effect on were you are fishing in the west end, With the high water and cold water temps your crew should put some good size pike in the boats,as well as walleyes coming off the spawn. Hebert is still 90%covered in ice, should be gone by this weekend. Good luck up there ,Keep us posted as to how you did"

2816353,Freytown,2014-05-20 12:14:00,770,"Kartman, I can't comment on the road condition by viewing satellite image but all the snow in that area is long gone."
2817417,Kartman35,2014-05-20 17:17:00,245,"haha I thought when Octane said ""I saw some ice in the northeast corner"" ...he meant he was at the northeast corner and he saw some ice..."
2825769,East coast,2014-05-22 17:31:00,32,Reports are water temps are generally in the 43 degree range and the spawn has started. Warm temps all week should really get things going.
