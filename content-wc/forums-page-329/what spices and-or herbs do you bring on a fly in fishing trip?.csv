2827009,Paul H,2014-05-23 06:58:00,1232,"Years ago I started making my own flavoring mix that I add to pancake mix for fish coating. Came as close as needed to the Gary Roach mix. I also took the Emeril BAM recipie (you can find it anywhere) and mix it up a pint at a time. I tweak a little and no celery as I hate celery. It's a cross between Emeril's and Old Bay (minus the celery ) . I use it on anything/everything. I mix it a a pint jar - have the recipe taped to the jar, and then move to a spice jar. Of course salt - which was always at the camp anyway - but I always took a cheap 1lb box - also clean cast iron with it. And a pepper grinder."
