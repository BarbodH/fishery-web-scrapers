2560969,Freytown,2014-03-16 15:33:00,770,I have never seen them turn around and fly back!
2562313,UKBDM,2014-03-17 05:53:00,178,Good news: some small ponds have partially or completely thawed here in central Indiana. Bad news: Lots of dead fish floating. Not unexpected after the winter we have had but still not fun to see 5lb plus largemouth bass floating on the surface. Temp this am was 18 degrees F.
2562521,Swamp_Donkey_Slayer,2014-03-17 07:26:00,42,Headed up to Donald Lake on 22nd of May for my 7th year up North. Usually fly in the week later never had a problem but given the early week and what seemed to be a colder and more snowy winter I became curiosity about the ice. Great news is the curiosity led me to walleye central which is phenomenal. Also great to hear all the positive statements around the ice..
2562721,Mike Borger,2014-03-17 08:10:00,1554,Welcome! Kind of cool having an Aussie on board.
2563073,Swamp_Donkey_Slayer,2014-03-17 09:52:00,42,Sorry mate I'm an American just living over there for a few years. Makes the fly-in every year one heck of a portage.
2563385,LoDo,2014-03-17 11:36:00,721,"Whats up buddy! 64 days and counting. I booked your flight from Denver to MSP. 8 deep in the Forrester is going to be tight, but fun! Road sodas!!! Timmy is set with the borax/minnows and plenty of crawlers. Small prayers on warm weather up north. Fish are going to be in the shallows again. 4-10' of water will be full of walleyes and swamp donkeys!!! Love casting rapalas near shore and reelin 22 - 28"" 'eyes!! I'm jazzed for the first trip through the narrows to Black Otter! Lets get those shirts rollin!!! America!!!!"
2564777,Flip Silverlake,2014-03-17 17:54:00,645,I have friends in Winnipeg and they still can't drill holes to ice fish even using extensions! Ice out middle of June!
2564881,LoDo,2014-03-17 18:38:00,721,Ice out in June doesn't bode well for those with fishing plans in late May.
2564969,zeebee,2014-03-17 19:10:00,1144,Too early to play red or black...but if I was gonnaplay ice out neuvorious (sp)?... I'd bet on ...????..your OK.
2523858,BreezyPoint,2014-03-06 09:11:00,1581,"Weather is a hobby for me and I have been following these outlooks for seven years. To say they are never accurate is completely wrong. The accuracy varies over time, but the overall accuracy has been remarkable, especially for three months or less. Of course, the farther out you go, the more variability there is.They have been very accurate with precipitation and slightly less accurate for temps. This winter they have been spot on.To say they are never accurate tells me that a person hasn't been following the predictions."
2523970,zeebee,2014-03-06 09:41:00,1144,Funny too that the ones that say it is unpredictable...are always making predictions.
2524674,octanehi5,2014-03-06 12:31:00,1104,"It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out the extreem winter we have had and still have the great lakes are 91% frozen, the last time it was that frozen was in 1979 thats 35 yrs ago. Last yrs winter was not near as bad it was a late ice out. We do live in the real world. This morning on the lake I fish in northern Quebec Lac Hebert it was -35 f its march 6th, I say that that lac does not ice out until the second week in May maybe?? Its very good for my last full week in June on Hebert"
2524722,Aaron-IN,2014-03-06 12:43:00,500,"I am on the ""late ice out"" bandwagon this year for sure but having said that ice out is something I've been following closely for the past 25 years (sorry, can tell why, LOL). Having said that I do have to agree with previous posters about how quickly things can change regardless of how cold its been and how thick the ice is in March. I can remember one or two years when I thought for sure it would be a late ice out then things changed drastically and the warm and wet weather arrived and the ice out was pretty much normal. It's certainly possible this year to."
2534377,123chadder,2014-03-09 08:21:00,429,i know through 25 years being screwd by long range forecasts.....dont tell me what you think i know.....just
2556354,Freytown,2014-03-15 07:26:00,770,"Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be) That saying pretty much sums up my feelings. The last really cold winter I believe was spring 2003. Most hydro reservoirs in Quebec were drawn way down, I think the Gouin was down 20 ft that spring. Anyway, ice out was pretty normal that spring. Last winter just lingered on, it wasn't that cold overall. As has been said...things can turn on a dime. But, Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)"
2557146,Skywagon,2014-03-15 10:13:00,1106,"An update. I live on a walleye lake, it is not all that deep, so froze up early this winter. We went out a couple of days ago fishing. With all the snow, the auger was not long enough to go through, so I ended up shoveling a foot of snow off the top in order to make it through. SOUNDS BAD DOESN'T IT? Actually the top foot was packed snow, then a thin layer of ice (frozen slush) then a layer of water, a layer of ice (frozen slush), water then not all that much good ice and finally open water. With so little good ice, I predict after warm weather comes, the ice will not take that long to go. If that prediction does not come true, this message is set to self destruct on May 30th."
2557170,Freytown,2014-03-15 10:18:00,770,"Update...the geese are comin' Just spent a few hours outside here in NEPA, wave after wave of Snows and Canadian geese headed NW....not a better sign of Spring. Skywagon got it right."

2518914,revitup,2014-03-05 08:36:00,140,"We fished Cedar last year June 8-15. With delayed spawn last spring we hit a fabulous week. We were definitely in post spawn frenzy. Best size, best numbers ever for our group. So I definitely am hoping for a similar ice out date. We are up June 7-14 this year."
2518922,Golden Eagle,2014-03-05 08:36:00,2642,"Fish new, green, growth in shallow water. If none, check the shoreline for green growth. Find it and there'll be warmer water seeping in where there's a little creek/crick. Big pike probably found it before you. Be nice to the fish since they're likely to be stressed from recent spawning. Stay in camp another 3 weeks or so for the rewards of fishing a shiner spawn."
2519266,123chadder,2014-03-05 09:36:00,429,"i think it will be ok,as long as we get warmer temps and rain in april-early may....."
2520442,jimmie,2014-03-05 14:36:00,123,To early to tell but late enough to know it won't be early. Hopefully it will not be as late as last year which was on opener in NW Ontario and after opener in most of Minnesota!

Water temps. will not raise very quikly . the farther north you go the later it will be.. with the thirty day oulook for below normal temps.April looks to be the same. May Ice out lets say the middle of the month puts post spawn about mid to the end of June.Givin the thickness of the ice reports in Canada,its going to be a very late ice out"

2511922,Skywagon,2014-03-03 15:31:00,1106,"So Prov 1800, I am in need of a super slush machine that will break trail in waist deep snow. What are you running? Seriously. From what I gathered at Timmy Ho's this morning, plus a friends call to a CO, nobody is out, lots of (stuck in the slush) stories. Ice fishing withdrawal is at a fever pitch, this is more serious than a delayed opener."
2512338,Aaron-IN,2014-03-03 17:20:00,500,"Based on what I have been told as far as ice thickness and such up in and around Kenora ( I would suspect everywhere else up there) it would take an unusually warm, raining spring (starting soon, which doesn't appear likely) for it to be a ""normal/average"" ice out. I would almost guarantee an ice out at least if not later than last years late ice out up there."
2512394,prov1800,2014-03-03 17:49:00,5010,"I run a polaris 800 rmk 155""x2 1/4 lugs.go anywhere, like a jet ski in slush.have a rack I built on the back and I carry everything I need.just hang on.lol."
2514082,REG,2014-03-04 07:20:00,445,Ice out was later than average last year and it was one of our best fishing years ever. Get ready for some hungry fish!
2515546,ftfarms,2014-03-04 12:15:00,444,I disagree with that. We went last week of may last year and it was the worst fishing we've had in twenty two years
2515634,prov1800,2014-03-04 12:38:00,5010,"Well tell us where you were.I tried 3 different lakes on the opener weekend,clay lake and cedar lake were good, lac suel was slow but the following week it was on fire, but ran all the way to brood lake, well worth the trip as I knew it would be."
2515666,camp chef,2014-03-04 12:49:00,915,We had by far the best Week of fishing we ever had in Canada the last week of May 2013. We were on Rainy. The ice had gone off only a week prior to our arrival.
2515850,LOW1,2014-03-04 13:31:00,2828,"If my memory is right, it was only two years ago that the ice was out on Lake of The Woods near Sioux Narrows by April 15 or so."
2518178,octanehi5,2014-03-05 05:23:00,1104,"Ice out in northern Quebec was 3 weeks later than normal,putting everything at least 3 weeks behind, With the winter we are still having, 30 day outlook is for below normal temps. This yrs ice out maybe later than last yr.For you guys that go in early May might be in trouble. last yr our group was on a lac in northern Quebec,the first week in July,The fishing was like it is the second week in June"
2518474,ftfarms,2014-03-05 07:11:00,444,We was fishing wabaskang We talked to several others on the way home and most anyone that was in that area said the same. Lac suel. Cedar. A few other lakes they were on. They all said first five days of opener was some of the best and than fishing just died. I've ben up when ice out was late and it was awesome but never seen the ice out that late. There was still ice on the lake the day before opener. I do fish cedar in July and the camp owner there said fishing was fantastic on cedar last week of may.
2505802,Mike Borger,2014-03-02 06:04:00,1554,"Yes Doug, but the last second replacement was pretty good, wasn't it?I'm slated to fly May 23-30 with Hearst Air this year. Just like last year it'll probably come right down to the wire.Fortunately I have a back up plan in place again.I sincerely think you'll be just fine going the first week of June."
2506002,octanehi5,2014-03-02 06:51:00,1104,"The long range outlook is for below normal temps for the next 30 days, Last yr on Hebert,in Quebec, everything was at least three weeks late. first week in July fishing was off the hook"
2507362,kzoofisher,2014-03-02 11:57:00,5144,"I'm wondering how the flip side might effect me. I've got a trip planned for the last week of August so.... If the summer is relatively cool and the lake never really warms up where will the fish be? I'm expecting them to still be in a solid summer, deepwater pattern but if the water tops out at a few degrees below normal that might move things around a lot. How much would the thermocline move in that case and would it be up or down? A cold spring could definitely retard weed growth. The long term forecast for the summer is a super helpful even chance that temp and precip are above normal, normal or below normal. At least I'll have lots of scouting reports."
2509162,Glenman12,2014-03-02 20:08:00,762,I cant see how ice out wont be later than average....hard to say if the openers will be affected..
2509914,jds22,2014-03-03 06:43:00,9,Last year was a relatively cool summer up here and the lake temps at the cabin we're at 80+ degrees for a couple days but avg 75. August should be fine. Ice will be out for opener on a lot of lakes. Last year i'd say 50% were open on the saturday and the rest by sunday/monday..
2510330,prov1800,2014-03-03 08:20:00,5010,"August is August, it will be the same as always, same structure only thing being they might be on the deep edge or the shallow edge.deep structure lakes like eagle or lac suel always have fish deep in august and september, but have found fish in shallow weed beds also in both warm and cooler water temps.t"
2511010,Jack77,2014-03-03 10:45:00,168,Personally I think that April weather has more to do with ice out than February or March weather. Canada could end up with a warm and rainy April and the ice out will be right on time. I know it is hard not to think about it but I wouldn't start sweating it just yet. Sound like water levels will be affected no matter what.
2511170,zeebee,2014-03-03 11:52:00,1144,correct...but if I were a bettin man
2511210,zeebee,2014-03-03 12:02:00,1144,"Zero correlation between late ice out, assuming we even have one, and August fishing.Have always found fish are more predictable in August than any other month. Come mid August I dont even bother to get scouting reports."
2511290,prov1800,2014-03-03 12:24:00,5010,"Always seems people start panicking around this time of the year.god its only march.settle down guys long way to go.anything could happen with weather swings.I've had my boat in at some of out trout lakes way before the walleye season opens up and have never missed the opener yet.always seems to work out.fishing might be crappie but I'm out, trout are biting like crazy that time of the year.theres more species here than walleye.if you want a perfect world book in mid july and you'll have nothing to worry about.we have two feet of ice and a bunch of snow on top and some places (a lot) theres 15-16""of water.tough going anywhere right now by snowmobile.not a lot of ice fishing getting done this year unless your fishing on a ice road.i can pretty much go anywhere on my sled but a regular trail machine is in trouble not only on the lakes but in the bush could be anywhere from two ft of snow up to five ft depending where.if its going to be a slow melt water levels will be fantastic but if it gets hot and goes fast it will jyst evaporate and water levels will be low as they were headed into last fall.just have to read the pists on when the ice lifts here its got to do that first before any ice starts melting.usually that doesnt happen till end of march or early april.last year on eagle it looked like the ice was going to be there forever and then within a week and a half it was gone.."

2503578,Skywagon,2014-03-01 11:02:00,1106,"May 30th is awful late to be worrying about ice out. I don't think the ice is as thick as normal because of all the snow cover (insulation), quality of ice is not all that special either on some lakes. A lot will depend on what the temps do between now and May. My greatest concern is what is going to happen when all this snow melts, flooding is almost a given. Right now fishing has almost come to a standstill, cold temps, super deep snow and lots of new slush since last weekend's dump, have made getting out on the ice difficult. Some lakes that are usually fished in the winter will not be this year, as there is no way to get to them. Crazy winter."

I have been doing up North trips since the late 60's.3/4 of them fly-in trips and in all those Years we have been cancelled 3 times. Hoping this Year won't be the 4th. I know locally from ice fishing that the ice is double thickness from what it usually is.Cross our fingers."
2503866,GNO,2014-03-01 12:34:00,153,Don't worry yet. I would bet ice out is normal time as usual. Lots of snow equals less ice and when it warms up we will have lots of water on the ice drain threw and honey comb it.
2504602,walleye-bum,2014-03-01 17:27:00,356,We have had more snow down here than in the last 15 years and the ice is thicker than I have seen in as many years. There is 30 plus inches of ice on saginaw bay!!! And with temps touching -20 to -30 below 2 nights ago it is still making ice like crazy. I think it is going to be a late spring for sure.
2504794,zeebee,2014-03-01 18:27:00,1144,All depends on how warm Mid April thru mid May are. Its been the coldest winter in this area (Kenora/Winnipeg) in some 35 years. Ice is very thick.If you are gonna bet on a late ice out this would be the year...gonna need you guys down south to send up some warm winds in a few weeks.
2504842,kzoofisher,2014-03-01 18:37:00,5144,"Yeah, I've got a trip planned to the Detroit River on 4/14 and if there aren't ice floes the river might still be all mud. Been hitting Mio for some early big browns the last couple of years too, that may not work out either. Heard it's been unfloatable for a while and the hardcore winter guys have been pretty disappointed. I'll just have to fish more in May and June to make up for it."
2505194,corvette1,2014-03-01 20:32:00,243,i lost my trip last year due to ice out of naknia same date this year 1st week of june its not looking good.
2505322,Blades-n-Beads,2014-03-01 20:52:00,484,"I was hoping for normal ice out and slow thaw to prevent flooding but it ain't looking good for either. Mega snow levels = high likely hood of run off= flooding. Deep ice = later than normal ice out usually. But on the positive there's plenty of time for mother nature to be nice after throwing all of us her husband ol man winter for an extended stay. Read some reports the big lakes (superior, Michigan ) water temps won't warm up till August ! Go figure."
2505626,roscoe33,2014-03-02 03:20:00,653,"Many lakes were iced in for the opener last year, in the Upsala and Ignace areas. Ice went out 3 days before the opener on Las des Mille. Really screwed the fishing up. The fish went on a crazy feed for about 5 days, then shut down and went into spawning mode. Taking a few new guys up there this year. I sure hope it is a more normal year."
