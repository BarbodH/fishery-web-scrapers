2823905,micropterus,2014-05-22 08:19:00,450,"No shower or tub, washed down as far as possible, up as far as possible, then you washed possible."
2823937,MrSimon,2014-05-22 08:23:00,922,"Back then I had zero problems with killing twelve fish a day, per person. Now, I can hardly bring myself to keep a few for lunch. Back then, being in a remote place didn't seem like a big deal. There was no ""grid"" to be off of. There were no cell phones to leave behind, no internet to miss, and no worries about expensive roaming charges for our 4G tablets. We just went fishing. Nowadays, it seems like we've all gone soft and make this huge deal about ""being all remote and secluded"". We talk about contingency plans, sat phones, etc etc etc. Our grandfathers would laugh at us."
2823985,tooski,2014-05-22 08:29:00,393,"Made me laugh ... ""last but not least, hair"" and ""No shower or tub, washed down as far as possible, up as far as possible, then you washed possible."""
2824057,The Donger,2014-05-22 08:52:00,48,I still take a fiberglass rod with me every trip as my backup. Thing must be over 30 years old by now. Going to use it this year just to see if it holds up.
2826737,btmbncr,2014-05-23 02:21:00,492,"TooskiI'll catch fish for you.Call Showalters and pay for a two week outpost trip for me and my wife. If you are really referring to the advances in fishing,isn't it amazing! I can now run down a rock reef,hump or a ""mega sand area on Lac Seul in mid July through August and see bait fish and walleyes( I know they were walleyes as we caught them shortly after marking them).I'm using Side Imaging and Down Imaging on my Hummingbirds.Just bought a pair of 1100 series Humminbirds for my new Backtroller Avid.If my wife found out I put $6300.00 worth of electronics on the new boat she may at least raise her eyebrows.Then again she bought me the Backtroller as a belated Anniversary present.Bill AKA Backtroller Billy"
2826897,tooski,2014-05-23 06:10:00,393,"BB, Thanks so much for the offer and I will take it under advisement, but why do I have to pay your wife's way? No doubt you can catch fish for me with all that gear. I am envious...."
2830169,Kenny_Ross,2014-05-24 13:47:00,103,We have decided to go the opposite way... We sold our fifth wheel and were contemplating a new one when the thought of a truckbox camper or an outfitters tent occurred. It gets stupid sometimes yanking a 5th wheel and boat to some of the more remote places. We are going with the tent and small genset.....this is gonna be great for bear season too.
2830713,btmbncr,2014-05-24 20:28:00,492,"TooskiI'm just kidding you.You would want to fish with my wife not me,she is a big walleye ""magnet"".It doesn't matter if it's Canada or South Dakota she caught more big walleyes than I did last year.I'll run the boat,clean and cook fish and you two set the hook.I might have to run a bouncer,spinner and leech every once in awhile ""just to keep my hand in"".Bill"
2820993,tooski,2014-05-21 14:15:00,393,"Camp was a canvas roof on four walls. Canvas got HOT. Coleman lanterns.. and then-- Metal roofs, propane lights and stove.. and then-- Propane fridges.. Ice houses under moss were better. Lasted all summer. and then-- Sources for lake maps regardless how far north you went... and then-- Portable fish finders, never found fish but would show depth.. and then-- Running water and a sink. Usually a pump but beat toting from the lake. and then-- Electricity (solar or generator) and showers. Miss jumping into the lake in May, I think I do anyhow.. and then-- Indoor plumbing, internet, sat phones. and then-- I can't imagine. Maybe someone to catch the fish for you?"
2821017,camp chef,2014-05-21 14:23:00,915,Headed out tomorrow a.m. for a camp with propane lights and fridge. It has a very nice outhouse and a shower house where you can pump water from the lake and let it warm up if you want a shower. Old school is relaxing.
2821089,wallydave,2014-05-21 14:40:00,2151,"Taking my second trip to Black Bear Lodge, rustic American plan operation. Meals are home cooking style, lodge is great for meals and telling lies, (fishing tails). Cabins are basic with comfortable beds. Outhouse and shower house too. Good boats with Honda or Mercury motors. Last August only 10 boats on the water, no crowding and the fishing got better each day. 620 a week including all meals, plus portage lakes to try!"
2821161,Gregking,2014-05-21 15:10:00,2658,"Back then we had: 1974 3/4 ton 454 and dad put a camper on back and his boat with the green box 1885 dad got a bird 4000 1987 moved into cabins. Still no AC, still cleaned and cooked our meals 1994 went to different Canada camp with a cabin, they cleaned and cooked. Bout my first boat and a lowrance x70a and a eagle on the bow with a minn Kota. Current, somewhere along the yrs we got AC, I have access to Internet and I got a 620."

2822305,itsme,2014-05-21 20:17:00,31,Tooski Go to wine Lake Camp...Its for sale per the internet...Old real log cabins...Propane lamps...3 burner stove ...no oven///out house up on the hill. Yes a common shower but not much warm water:
2822393,HeHooksHimself,2014-05-21 20:35:00,725,"GlenMan, you know that is my camp. Leaving tomorrow. really need to do this! I have a feeling we are going to hit the post spawn, good thing the lakers are big in wine Lake!"

2823505,big popi,2014-05-22 07:17:00,635,"Our 1st Canada trip we went up in the family trickster, a sweet '68 Chevy wagon. Stayed in a canvas tent, Dad told us not to touch the sides when it rained (of course we did) and it rained so hard there was 2"" of water in the tent. Pops had a 16' flatboat with a Evinrude 18, great boat really tough. Now Mom & Pops stay in my brothers 5th wheel, the wife & I stay in a cabin (never thought I would). Pops runs a 98 1650 Explorer & I am taking my Impact up for the 1st time this year. It's all good, maybe just gets a little more comfortable."
