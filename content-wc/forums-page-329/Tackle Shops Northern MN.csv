2818481,rather-be-fishin,2014-05-20 22:45:00,429,"Fish Fry ~ What are you going to be fishing for? What lake are you going to? If your fishing mostly Walleye you will want to get jigs 1/4 & 3/8 oz & Klass spinners only found in Canada work great!. If your talking ""big"" stores, Gander Mt. before Forest Lake is on your main route. If your fishing Muskies, Bobby's In Vermilion Bay has decent choice of Muskie lures. If your going through Dryden, there is a small gas station/bait shop on left side after you go over the river bridge with good selection of ""aspirin"" jigs which work great for walleye. If your going as far as Ear Falls, there is Four Season's Bait shop too. There is the Outdoorsman Tackle shop in Cloquet, MN on your route too. As well as previously mentioned shop in Int'l Falls MN. Good Luck and have fun! RBF"
2818497,MikeinMN,2014-05-20 22:58:00,190,"X2 on Thorne Brothers in Blaine, giant selection of musky tackle, very good selection of everything else. Also a fly fishing shop in the same building if you're into that. www.thornebros.com If you need live bait, a few miles south of Thorne Bros is Vados Bait. Not a whole lot of tackle, but more live bait than I thought possible. www.vadosbait.comThere is also a Gander Mountain just a mile or 2 north of Thorne Bros if you like their selection of sporting goods."
2819105,LOW1,2014-05-21 07:38:00,2828,"I have always thought that the intersection of I35 and Highway 33 at Cloquet would be a great location for a Cabelas. The Walmart at Cloquet carries a much better fishing/boating selection than does the Walmarts where we live-it's not Cabelas or Thorne Bros., however."
2823281,Kevin R,2014-05-22 06:14:00,305,In Duluth right off Highway 53 on Haines road is Gander Mountain this is a very large store with a huge selection.
2816881,FishFry2012,2014-05-20 14:52:00,27,"Any good (large selection) tackle shops between Minneapolis and International falls? Flying in this Friday to head up north of Vermilion Bay for a week. I have some tackle I left at my family, but looking to purchase some other items as there are different options from what is here in NC. I know there's a gander mountain in Forest Lake, not sure what else. Thanks!"
2816921,muskyroller,2014-05-20 14:57:00,56,Thorne bros. over by the Blaine sports center is heaven!
2816945,IaDave,2014-05-20 14:59:00,476,The gas station/bait shop where you turn to go to Lake Kabetogma(look for the big walleye) has a decent selection. In International Falls there is a place on the left hand side(white bldg) before you turn to head to the border. I don't recall the name it's across the street from Border Pizza.
2816961,WallyNut,2014-05-20 15:03:00,79,"Joe's Sporting Goods is close. Located in St. Paul, just off of 35E. http://www.joessportinggoods.com/"
2816969,dutchboy,2014-05-20 15:04:00,5717,"If you like a ma & pa type shop, right outside Clouqet on the right side. Is right where you turn to WalMart. I think it's Adventure something. Nice shop good selection nice guy."
2817033,Pikeslayer8,2014-05-20 15:23:00,1460,Sportsman's Service good place for tackle and we get our dry ice there.
2817057,SinOrSwim,2014-05-20 15:36:00,1528,sportsmans service sounds like something else entirely.
2817329,Yaba,2014-05-20 17:03:00,88,Bobbys corner in Vermillion Bay!
2817385,MorganMan,2014-05-20 17:13:00,341,"Gander Mountain would be a great spot to stop. Otherwise, there is a Cabelas in Rogers, MN and one just opened in Woodbury this last week. Neither of those are too far out of you way considering you coming from NC! If you can't get to any of those, Outdoorsman's Headquarters is a nice place with a pretty good selection of most anything fishing or hunting. They are located next door to a Holiday Gas Station and Liquor Store...one stop shopping."
2817401,MorganMan,2014-05-20 17:16:00,341,"Sorry, the Outdoorsman's Headquarters/Holiday Gas Station/Liquor store are in International Falls. Never been to Joe's in St Paul, but sounds like I may have to stop by sometime."
