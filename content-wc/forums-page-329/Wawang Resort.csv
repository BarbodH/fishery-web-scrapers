2203873,pastorted,2013-11-05 10:21:00,19,I've noticed there are a lot of posts on WC regarding Wawang several years ago but nothing in the past three years. Wondering how you'all are feeling about this place especially around the first of July. Any information would be greatly appreciated.
2213826,roscoe33,2013-11-10 22:23:00,653,"Our family has been doing Ontario trips since the early 60's, so we have been to a lot of places. Our family had been going to wawang for 10 years. One relative had a permanent camper there, and stayed all summer. The fishing is about the same as it was. Not as good as other places we have been to. This year it was abnormal the first week of the season, because of the late ice, the fish hadn't spawned yet, and were on a feed, for about 5 days. Then they went into spawning mode and it really slowed down for a couple weeks. You can find walleyes in July for sure. Pike action is picking up by then too. There are a lot of bears in the Wawang area, so if you want to do a fall bear hunt, its a good place to go. Reasons why 2012 was our last year at wawang: the road is real tough on vehicles and trailers the prices are higher than other resorts very limited docking available if you bring your own boat, you beach (sand) launch, and retrieve every day. Have seen many swamped and sand filled boats that were left in over night. the fishing is not spectacular cabins are average, been in worse, but prefer better. We now go to a nicer resort for half the price, and only 8 miles off the highway instead of 2 hours.http://www.lacdesmille.com/index.html"
2265649,astefanski,2013-12-10 09:59:00,2,"8 people at Wawang mid July 2013. First time there. Many times up North. Primarily pike fishing. Weather was horrible. Rainy and mid forties low fifties for daytime temps. Used 8 person cabin. Acceptable,but not much more. Food was plentiful and edible. Boats were the quality of outpost boats. They were gassed every morning. The camp manager was terrific,especially given the camp's remote location. The owners were available and more than willing to help. Now the fishing. Given the weather, we still had the best fishing of any ""drive to"" camp we've visited in over twenty years. Solid high 30's and low 40's are to be expected. Two wallye fisherman averaged over 50 fish per day per person the same week. We caught incidental walleye with 20 in. + common on pike baits. Now the downside. GRAHAM ROAD. Still repairing the one boat we brought to camp. I would highly recommend using the so so camp boats and saving yours. Takes 1-1/2 hours to drive 20 miles on Graham and camp road. The lake itself is quite small and could be problematic if camp is full. Still best ""drive to"" fishing to date. But oh! what a drive."
2271761,stillangling,2013-12-12 20:22:00,149,"Here is my advice. Don't do it. There are far too many great drive to lakes in NW Ontario to even consider pulling a boat on a road like that. I have not fished the lake personally but know people who have. Reports are not great. In my opinion you would be better served if you went just a little farther west. The Ignace/Sioux Lookout area has awesome drive to fisheries. Go big if you are going to drive this far. Get yourself on the English River system (starts in Ignace area and goes to Manitoba border). Lakes like Indian, Barrel, Press, Kukukus, Basket, Lac Seul..all have two things in common. Awesome walleye fishing and part of the English River."
2274194,pastorted,2013-12-14 10:39:00,19,"Hey guys, Thanks for the information. It sounds like I can eliminate Wawang and go on to other locations that have great reviews."
2274234,drlee,2013-12-14 10:53:00,409,"""StillAngling"" nailed it. Take his/her advice. Been to the area mentioned and the walleye fishing is kick a$$."
2778961,jaxxon,2014-05-10 08:13:00,2,"As mentioned the Graham Road is kind of tough but apparently they are now logging it again full time and it is better. I have fished that lake several times and have always caught way more fish than expected. As others have mentioned, it is more like an outpost camp and is outfitted as such so that is what to expect but in turn, it has indoor plumbing and tv for those rainy days and the fish truly are that big. I have received many Ontario angler awards for my fish and the staff submits my pictures and info for me and the certificate comes in the mail. I have gone on the Ontario angler website to see where I line up and they always have tons of entries and lots of pictures so I know it isn't just me In the end, I will continue to go back because I love the staff and they seem to know the lake very well....I would like updated boats though! I honestly have caught more big fish here (pike and walleye) than anywhere I have fished."
2831809,Wawang,2014-05-25 14:32:00,2,"Hi folks Trish here from Wawang Lake. Thanks for all reviews (good and bad) I always appreciate seeing where we are succeeding and where we need improvement Yes we are 1.5 hours on gravel and though we dont have much say in that area, it is scheduled for a 5 year contract for solid logging so the road will be maintained much better than in years past but of course it will still be gravel In the end, if we were on the black top, we couldnt boast such a private surrounding so it is the trade off that we have to make Thanks astefanski for the nice comments, I had such a great time with you guys last year and you will be happy to know that I have landed a really nice 40.5""pike on that lil louie you left for me.....that is one helluva lure with action to die for!! Thanks so much! As this is my fourth season at Wawang, many things have been changing and improving each season and we look forward to more improvements and I always welcome any suggestions or questions so dont hesitate to ask.One thing that wont change is that we will stay the only residents on our lake and we will manage our fishery with stringent catch and release trophy policies (eaters are always welcome to be had of course) and we will always back up any and all claims of trophy sized fish with pictures We love that our guests participate by submitting such great photos year after year.We also participate in the Ontario Federation of Angler and Hunter awards program which can be found at http://www.ontarioanglerawards.com and boast being the lodge with the most supporting photos for entries in the history of the program. Wawang anglers have recorded 3682 trophy fish with this program since 2005 and will continue to in the future.Feel free to keep up to date with the most up to date action on our facebook page http://www.facebook.com/wawangresortI look forward to updating you all on the season progression and answering any questions or concerns you may have.Tight lines!TrishGeneral Manager Wawang Lake Resort"
