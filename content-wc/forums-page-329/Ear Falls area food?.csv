2823633,Mohleye,2014-05-22 07:40:00,368,"Both the motels along the highway have restaurants. The Trillium also has a bar, never stayed at the 105 but I'm sure it does too. There's a small mall behind the Trillium with a grocery store, there's also a pizza/Italian place in the mall. I can't think of the name, but we've gotten pizza there several times, and it's pretty good. Smitty's convenience store on the north end of town has bait and tackle."
2823761,geomax,2014-05-22 08:03:00,29,"Smitty's in the summer used to sell chicken as well, not sure how that all works these days though. Otherwise Mohleye has Ear Falls covered for you as best possible.If your looking for something on the way up, check out Busters BBQ Restaurant in Vermillion Bay, it does not disappoint. And if you go up to Red Lake and want the best food stop in at Antonios."

2824457,Steve Ediger,2014-05-22 10:45:00,97,It's hard to beat the meals at the 105. Good food and plenty of it.
2824497,Steve Ediger,2014-05-22 10:49:00,97,"Oh, I forgot to mention Mr. Wilsons grocery store in the strip mall in Ear Falls is a great place to stock up. Mrs Wilson makes really good banana bread and pies and sells them in the store. Very nice people. Ask Mr. Wilson if he has any Canadian bacon."

2827017,wallydave,2014-05-23 07:00:00,2151,"Last year my wife and I dodged a storm while having lunch at Pape's, (Pappy's in the States) The food was pretty good, everything was pretty clean, a must when my wife is with me. You can't go wrong with the pies from Wilsons! Busters has great food too, worth the stop at V Bay! Pooch where you fishing out of?"
