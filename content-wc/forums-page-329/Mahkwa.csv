Sounded like a docking fee for the week if I remember right. But I would hope it would be a better situation than in the past. We've had people move our boats before, unplug extension cords, steal dock fenders, etc. Not to mention the old docks were pretty terrible shape, and dangerous electrical conditions."
2829545,Pooch,2014-05-24 08:36:00,4619,"Have to agree about the old docks and electrical hazards! Mahkwa seems like it's just open to anything as far as guests doing what they want. Camp is poorly run and nobody seems to be in charge. Folks that work in the office are very nice and pleasant, just disorganized. That said it is located in a nice area to fish. Maybe I'm getting used to it as it seems to be getting better. The new road two years ago was a HUGE improvement and greatly appreciated by everyone who had ever experienced the old road.The camp has it's plus's, too. So we just go with the flow when there. All camps are different and have their up and down sides. Not really a big deal, but I'd not take my wife there, but I wish I could.Pooch"
