We used Hubert Ballentyne and was awesome. Took us to the SPOTS. Knows the lake well. If your bringing your boat, make sure to bring a few extra Aluminum props. I was careful and spent $700 on repairs when I got home. Awesome pretty lake for sure!Have fun, 9 days is about perfect. we went for 5 last year and it wasn't long enough. One of my favorite lakes...Cheers"

Spoons/Cranks/Rogues have worked great for the pike and jigs for the walleye. We have caught big pike 40""+ and average walleye.Let us know how the fishing was when you return, thanks"
