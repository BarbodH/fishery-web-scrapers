2803057,northernbite,2014-05-16 15:07:00,1186,"I like this one, we camp way back in on lake and my grandson came last year and surprised the heck out of me. His willingness to set up camp and work everyday was great. Always asking if or where we needed help. So we let up on him because we all want him to come back. Great dish washer and water retriever. paul"
2805945,danforth,2014-05-17 17:51:00,117,"We have a blooper award for our trip and it always adds a little fun to the trip, We start a list as soon as we get there of the mistakes everyone makes and at the end of camp the group votes on who pulled the dumbest stunt. The most senior person picks up a gag gift from a local gift shop and it is given after the camp vote. Hint we have a very good idea which one or two people will win it anyway due to their ability to find trouble."
2806817,theeyeshaveit,2014-05-18 05:34:00,15,"A few years ago our Newbie was obviously a joker. First night in camp he slipped a walleye head in my pillow case...NOT in a plastic bag.... you can imagine my surprise and we all had a good laugh the next morning. We all know how paybacks are. Newbie had one weak spot, he slept late every morning. Soooooooo, we all gathered around his bed. Me with a hot dog in my hand and my schlong hanging out of my jeans.... I stood right next to him, rubbed that hot dog across his face and watched his eyes pop out of his head... He's never come back!~!!!!"
2807505,Cumminsram2010,2014-05-18 08:06:00,396,That's GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY! Just kidding I got a good laugh out of that one .
2820753,MuskyMaster,2014-05-21 12:45:00,79,"NICE!!We have a thing here with CumminsRam: You see the poor kid can't control his laughter to save his life. Last year I was in the cabin and he was messing around in the boat, a kid maybe 15 was fishing a couple docks down. He gets a snag and from inside the cabin i yell, ""Hey kid! did ya lose your lure?"" Mike (cummins) starts laughing uncontrollably bc i said 1 more thing i can remember, He starts getting out of the boat and running on the dock, then i go again with ""Here ill come help"" as hes running. Even though we caught 1,000 fish, thats still the highlight of the trip. It shall happen again, in 3 days"
2797809,MrSimon,2014-05-15 09:26:00,922,I like to just sit back and watch them. Early in the week they struggle with little things. By mid week they have gotten used to the routine and are catching fish. By the end of the week they are all smiles and already talking about next year.
2798225,scottydawg,2014-05-15 11:16:00,1,"It is essential to give newbies the lowest jobs on the totem pole, so that way you can keep the seniority rights in place. Not only will it keep them humble, but it will give them initiative to keep coming back, only with newbies of their own, so they gradually move up the food chain!"
2798361,beer slayer,2014-05-15 11:58:00,33,"Some good one's here fella's! In my old brotherhood of the"" ignore the no hunting & fishing signs"" club the tenderfoots always had to pay their dues, some tenfold! It was always good natured, examples were ""fetcher of the beer"" Keeper of the flame"" Cleaner of the fish"" ""Dragger of the deer"" etc. Very few complained as we were a pretty succesful gang"
2798721,MuskyMaster,2014-05-15 13:56:00,79,"good ones and less cruel than the others here. I have brought many non fisherman with me only to teach them and my goal is to put them on fish. Tell them what to use and how to work it and as it always happens, I put on my #2,3 choice lure and catch fish. I know I will catch them but I want the guys that don't know how to have just as much fun."
2800121,muskyman73,2014-05-15 21:42:00,402,"I think FNG's should do the loading and unloading of the boats and allllll the groceries. But then again, I like to eat and I don't want them dropping all the eggs ! I have a bigfoot event planned this year. I have a feeling the video will go viral ! lol"
2800153,Nimstug,2014-05-15 21:59:00,2605,"Assuming the greenhorn in question is a youngster - up into the teens, give the greenhorn the subtle message that they may not be big enough, strong enough, responsible etc. to do a particular task. The greenhorn usually will go to great lengths to prove you wrong. I belive this approach will allow you to get the most out of your greenhorn. Nimstug"
2801265,Pikeslayer8,2014-05-16 07:47:00,1460,"Usually are greenhorns are kids, we tell them on the way to fishcamp that they have 2 duties to fullfill, waxing the boats and crushing cans. Usually doesn't take long for um to figure out that boat waxing is a bit far-fetched but we are entirely serious about the can crushing duties."
2802713,Cumminsram2010,2014-05-16 13:24:00,396,Go send them into the cabin to look for the left handed fillet knife or the anchor floats!
2802721,Cash,2014-05-16 13:25:00,73,"This^...I have a 16 YO daughter that is as bull headed as they come. Many times I've told her, ""i'll get than honey it's too heavy for you."" The next thing you know she's toting a 50 lb. trolling motor battery down to the dock."
2802897,btyreprich,2014-05-16 14:10:00,1067,"Our group has a policy of treating everyone equally. If you want to eat, then you do your fair share of the jobs. What we ask of the newbies is nothing that a ""senior member"" of our group has not already done in the past. Only assign then tasks that they can do easily and safely. Would you expect a greenhorn to fillet the days catch of fish?? If you want the greenhorns to come back for future trips, I feel you need to show them how things are done and treat them equally. I remember the expression on my brother-in-laws face when he caught his first slot fish Walleye. If he smiled any wider, his nose would have fallen in his mouth."
2794641,bigwalleye1,2014-05-14 12:12:00,2632,"I couldn't find much of anything in a search, so here goes. Greenhorns. We've all seen 'em, we've fished with 'em, some have even had them in our boats. Young 'uns, older folks, but all freshly minted for the Candian Shield newbies. Any break-in rituals? Special hats? Cabin duties? Hazing? What do you like? I see this as different from the ""prankster"" thread. That for sure, but you only get a chance at THIS greenhorn once.... Got a couple older greenies going this year, one who is a sometime poster here. Here's your chance. Tell him what he's in for...Sometimes the fear alone is enough..."
2794657,Cumminsram2010,2014-05-14 12:24:00,396,You take them fishing for pike and make them throw the biggest ugliest heaviest lure you can find up in the back bays. Then you throw something normal and tell them you guys need to have a variety out there. Have fun watching them pull in cast after cast of swamp monster weeds. All the while assuring them that they are doing great and have a shot at a real trophy! After a couple hours of them being dog tired it's usually kind to let them relax before their arms fall off.
2794745,Mike Kansas,2014-05-14 12:56:00,1463,If you can on the first day cut their line about 10' back on the spool and than rewind it. Give them what you say is a Killer Lure and tell them to throw it as far as they can. When the lure flys away just look at them with that WTH look.
2794817,bigwalleye1,2014-05-14 13:15:00,2632,"That's actually one of MY old jokes. I'm looking for some special hazing you only do one time and only because they're horns, like dish duty, or a hat with a horn on it, something to signify they're the newbie. Kind of a ""right of passage"" deal, like the old Navy ""Shellback"" cards."
2794825,NathanH,2014-05-14 13:17:00,697,Eat a minnow or bite the head off of one. Had to do that when smelting for the first time.
2795089,bigwalleye1,2014-05-14 14:44:00,2632,"Dude...Knife River, 1979??? That was YOU????? We laughed for a week!!!"
2795977,MorganMan,2014-05-14 19:01:00,341,"Newbies always had to do dishes, gas up the boats, bait in buckets, etc. Now most of that is done for us so dishes is about it. We could use some new ""newbie ideas"" too."
2796649,Guest,2014-05-14 23:37:00,0,"Get the biggest daredevil and take off the hooks. Cast it next to his head a few times. Then let it sit right on his ear and cast hard. YOU CAN""T LAUGH WHILE YOU ARE DOING THIS> When he complains, just say your sorry. And continue"
2796873,thyme to fish,2014-05-15 06:00:00,307,"the old ""snipehunt"" is a requirement in our group...."
2797705,btmbncr,2014-05-15 09:00:00,492,No harassment for newbies.Just let them enjoy the trip.They get enough stress in their lives just from their jobs.Bill
