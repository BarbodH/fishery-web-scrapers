Very service friendly and great fishing. Go to Miniss lake if you can. I could go on, but best you try them for your own. You wont be disappointed!"
2780401,polaris-pete,2014-05-10 20:03:00,343,Last time we were at Pasha there was no American plan unless Chad has done something different.
2780585,wallydave,2014-05-10 21:31:00,2151,"They are on Red Lake, 620 a week including meals boat and gas. It is a rustic camp, the lodge is nice, pretty remote for a drive-in. To keep costs down you do your own dishes at breakfast and dinner, each group helps serve and clean up with one meal, lunches, sandwiches or a shore lunch kit. We had a good week of fishing last year in mid August despite sunny no wind weather. Each day our catch was better! Thanks to Share a Seat, a group of 4 is heading to Red Lake.www.fishblackbear.com"
2780649,Knoxabilly,2014-05-10 22:34:00,225,I have to throw Evergreen Lodge in the ring. Pat and Gary are awesome and the camp and fishing are A+ www.lacseulwalleye.com
2787041,ftfarms,2014-05-12 17:07:00,444,I would say Amasons Obabikon out of morson Ontario. Jared's a great guy and its in a awesome spot for fishing.
2787217,The Donger,2014-05-12 17:46:00,48,"Goose Bay Camp has their main setup on Lac Seul at Ear Falls. I've never stayed there but we did go to their really cool boat in outpost on Nungesser. I have to say the Nungesser trip was one of the top two trips I have had up there. Nice cabin and a really fair price plus they have an ice house there. Too much fun climbing into the ice house and chopping your own lake ice for cocktail hour. Excellent walleye and pike fishing on Nungesser. Viking Outposts out of Red Lake has some great fly in outposts. I really like Critchell Lake. Great fishing, several waterfalls and a selection of nice portage lakes for day trips. Very reasonable pricing for their fly in camps and a 150 lb. weight limit which is way more than you see with most fly in outfitters. We are going to McInnes Lake with Viking in a couple weeks. Looking forward to the big water and the Lake Trout fishing. It's all good!"
2787433,KM1,2014-05-12 18:38:00,374,Love Witch Bay Camp...why switch??? Anything specific???
2818985,mas1959,2014-05-21 07:04:00,2,"Ok, need some help. Looking for somewhere to fish near Niagria a falls, Lakawanna NY or on the Canadian side. Resort facility with boat launch. Never been up that far in that direction. Going for a week thanks"
2819513,Danbear,2014-05-21 08:57:00,72,"I have to second NARDA 1's recommendation. My small gang will be going to Birch Dale for our 7th year this year. Fishing is good, Cabins are very nice, Food is excellent and I love ordering off the menu. Marcel will ensure you are well taken care of. We are going the 3rd week of August this year."
2157922,Guest,2013-10-09 17:00:00,0,I am looking for a Canadian lodge that has american plan - fishing for walleye and Northern Pike. Have been at Witchbay lodge a number of times - looking for some others Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks. lesurfishrman
2157994,Duflebag,2013-10-09 17:32:00,218,"Leisure, i have been going to Northwinds for 23 years now. Family owned in Vermilion Bay, NW Ontario. American plan and fishing in a boat with a guide every day. A fishing camp for fishermen. Every day you can fish a different lake. After breakfast you ride in a huge Tundra to the lake you are fishing that day. 20 foot lund impact with a 200hp verado and 101lb terrova. If you want walleyes you can fish Lac Seul. If you want muskies you can go for numbers on Indian or Cedar or a fish of a lifetime on Eagle Lake. Smallmouths on a lake where you can put 250 in the boat every day. casting for big pike on Clay. One of the problems i have experienced at camps on one lake is that you are tied to that lake. The species that live there and if fishing is good. Northwinds gives me the ability to change up where i go. I would highly recommend it. Mom Munford does the coooking and her boys are your guides. Brad and Scott Munford are by far two of the best guides in the Vermilion Bay, Eagle Lake area. www.northwindsoutfitters.com"
2167529,115 optimax,2013-10-15 17:08:00,650,"Trust me,go to Silver Water Wheel Lodge on Lac Seul just north of Dyden On.At least check out their web site.Fishing is absolutely awesome on this lake and the lodge is 5 star in my opinion!!!"

2173729,Hawker,2013-10-18 18:27:00,3967,"Hands down, Young's Wilderness Camp! Great owners/hosts (Perry & Carol Anniuck), clean, spacious modern cabins, GREAT food, excellent boats & motors, always a helpful staff & dock hands and top that off with excellent fishing for Walleye, Pike, Crappie, Smallmouth and of course Muskie!Been going there for the past 23 years, gets better and better every year. YWC is located on an island about a five minute boat ride from the landing. Can't speak highly enough about YWC!!(http://youngswildernesscamp.com/)"
2176089,weston,2013-10-20 11:31:00,18,"check out www.tinkersplaces.com , we are in Nestor Falls, we are an American Plan lodge with fly-in outposts also. Fish LOTW on Sabaskong or Whitefish Bay and also there is numerous day fly-in trips to choose from. I'm a guide there you can ask me any questions you have."
2176337,NARDA 1,2013-10-20 15:24:00,636,"Check out www.birchdalelodge.com located on Eagle Lake, Vermillion Bay, Ontario. You can fish for Walleye. Northern Pike, Musky, Lake Trout, Smallmouth Bass, Perch and Whitefish. Their American plan is unique in that you order off of a menu from their ""Grill your own steakhouse"" instead of everyone eating the same thing. They have well maintained equipment and cabins. My group has been fishing there for 25 years. You can also call the lodge and speak with the owner, Marcel at 807-227-5262. You won't be disappointed. Terry"
2277650,fishguide1800,2013-12-16 06:47:00,84,For walleye action a lot of lakes here are good.pike fishing basically sucks on most lakes.clay lake is by far the best pike lake in our area.and some great walleye action to boot.one camp on the lake (north star lodge) that's where I normally would take my guests for pike days.also check out. (Johnsoutdooradventures).good luck.
2277986,zeebee,2013-12-16 09:44:00,1144,Are you looking for fly-in or drive to?Hard to beat a good fly-in especially if trophy pike or lake trout are desired.Ive caught both on consecutive years going to Trout Lake north of Red Lake. Nice diversion from the excellent walleye fishery in that lake.Couple of outfitters ...Boois and Cat Island. Both upper tier in quality and offer American Plan with shore lunches is that's desired.
2727425,mrmusky14,2014-04-26 20:03:00,148,Any reason why you are not going back to witch bay?
