2813209,BenBeattie,2014-05-19 17:17:00,232,"Ya, there's a lot of water in there right now. Tons of current and large standing waves. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're very comfortable with running them from past experiences and you've got a big boat."
2814137,115 optimax,2014-05-19 21:38:00,650,"The Walleye are getting hammered at the Bear Narrows bridge on Eagle Lk,18-22ft of water.25"",26"" were the biggest with lots from 15""-20"".Females had no eggs and only a few males had milk.People are catching off shore,but not as good as the boats in deeper water."
2814457,Wawajake,2014-05-20 06:02:00,413,"I was fishing an hour east of the Sault (South of Chapleau) and the Walleye (or anything) was unable to be found. Even though air temperatures were 70 degrees F , the main body of water was 45 degrees F and the warmest we could find was 49 degrees in a large shallow bay. Even the river mouth was only 47.5 F Lots of boats and any I talked to had no luck. Tried all the normal spring locations and then went deep. We marked them at 40 feet a few locations........ but they had lock jaw. Going to be an interesting spring/Summer."
2817969,stillangling,2014-05-20 19:49:00,149,Lake of the Woods still had some ice at the north end until Monday so there wasn't too much fishing action near Kenora on the lake but the fish were snapping on the Winnipeg River. Temps were just over 40 F so fish are still in a pre spawn pattern. Big females in 22 to 23' in calmer water. Males were holding in more current. Took time to find fish because they were not in the typical opening weekend spots. Standard jig and minnow but almost had to drag it along the bottom to get bites. Sure felt good to be in a boat.

2823057,Skywagon,2014-05-22 04:59:00,1106,They were biting on Eagle yesterday.
2823857,geomax,2014-05-22 08:13:00,29,"Fished the Marchington system North of Sioux Lookout right through Monday, floating ice and pre-spawn conditions. Big fish were hitting with lots in the high teens and 20""s, pitching back females full of eggs and males milking all over the boat."
2805825,bushead11,2014-05-17 17:24:00,151,"Been long awaited and I'm curious to hear how groups did today... Pre-spawn, spawn or post spawn patterns? Anyone land a monster to start the season?"
2806089,Cumminsram2010,2014-05-17 19:16:00,396,Everyone must still be fishing. Can't wait to hearths results.
2806985,Fisherman1792,2014-05-18 06:43:00,927,"The lake I fish (White Lake between Marathon and White River) the north end still had ice but down the south end was ice free. Fishing was pretty good considering the water temp was 35F. Fish must be in pre spawn still, didnt catch a walleye with eggs, and one was milking. Largest was 18.5"". Did catch a real nice perch and she was full of eggs. Fisherman 1792"
2807161,Limeyangler,2014-05-18 07:16:00,563,"I managed to get an hour from the lawn after work, nice big pike and one ready to burst perch but no walleye. The west end of Wabigoon is clear of ice, some still around other main body though. BIG pike and perch videohttp://youtu.be/5J7U5m59SyE"
2809737,bushead11,2014-05-18 20:19:00,151,Anyone else?
2809977,JJJMN,2014-05-18 21:40:00,153,"Sturgeon Lake on North End near the town of Savant Lake(6miles). Bay is wide open with plenty of open water. Main lake is ice covered. Our Bay has Walleye spawning area that is closed to fishing until June sometime. Ice on bay has only been out about 4 day's. Walleye started Spawning Friday May 16 from what they tell us. Camp is full (6 cabins) and fish have been caught (plenty of 18-22) but very slow compared to last year at same time. I think limits are being caught and plenty of shore lunch activity on Sat and Sun. Things should improve over the next few days when they start moving off of the spawning beds. Drive up, St Paul to Duluth to Ignace were excellent this year. I35 before Twin City's has lots of 1 lane construction that caused a backup of 30minutes. Leach's are available on route and we paid $40.00 lb for very nice jumbo's. Larry's Bait in Kakabkca Falls. Camp has plenty of minnow's and of nice size. Monday we might have some storms moving in later in day so will be out early. Will try to give day by day update. Hope you all have great trips. Water Temp this morning was 43 and 47 around 7pm."
2810457,Yaba,2014-05-19 06:55:00,88,"Spent a couple hours on Wabigoon yesterday. The west end was open, south and east ends still iced in. In the couple hours we were out, lost alot of ice though! Tried to launch on Thunder but the whole east end was still iced in and couldnt use the ramp at the park."
2810489,Cumminsram2010,2014-05-19 07:01:00,396,Any news on the wawa/chapleau area?
2811833,BenBeattie,2014-05-19 11:09:00,232,"I fished lac seul by running pelican falls. Had to dodge a lot of ice on Pelican on opening day but it's all gone now. Still no access via Hudson or Deception launch, however. Definitely pre-spawn. Temp only 39 deg. Females fat with eggs but not dropping yet. Males all milting. Fish were deeper than normalâ€¦ 15-20 feet was best. We did really well though, biggest was 28.5"""
2813081,Limeyangler,2014-05-19 16:28:00,563,Sounds fun Ben your friggin crazy though Pelican Falls is pretty gnarly ... no?
