2822241,rnnonmt,2014-05-21 20:01:00,992,"So true! ""Someone has to start it"" is hilarious."
2823049,Skywagon,2014-05-22 04:57:00,1106,"With the high water levels, there is nothing to talk about."
2824161,bigwillies,2014-05-22 09:16:00,515,acually lac suel is the opposite super low in the spring and rises as the summer goes on.talked to a guy yesterday that has a camp not far from deception landing.said the water is about six feet away from the cribbing on his dock.don't know about the rags though.
2824345,cuamb,2014-05-22 10:11:00,203,He must have been pulling your leg. The water level is very high for this time of year. check out the web site.http://www.lwcb.ca/pdf/LacSeulGraph2014.05.21.pdf
2824473,BenBeattie,2014-05-22 10:45:00,232,"Agreed. Lac Seul is very high for this time of year. Water isn't usually this high on Lac Seul until late June. i'll be blowing through the rags in a boat full speed ahead. Can't comment about houseboats though, I have no idea how much water they need."
2824681,Ranger319,2014-05-22 11:46:00,166,"Just to hijack my own thread, Hey Ben or anyone else for that matter, I would venture a guess that the Chute (Abrams/Minnitaki) will have plenty of water as well?"
2824705,geomax,2014-05-22 11:49:00,29,"Chutes are a non-issue, could drive right up the middle right now."
2825297,bigwillies,2014-05-22 14:44:00,515,a few too many beers i guess.
2825793,rnnonmt,2014-05-22 17:39:00,992,Over the years I have passed through the rags in a 65' houseboat as early as the first week of June. GPS elevation including the antenna offset was at 1169 feet (actual water level). This is the lowest reading I have ever had going through there. Watch out for the stump at the north end. I know that stump fairly well.
