2832265,jaym,2014-05-25 17:53:00,89,"Thanks for the number Ben, yes they are open Sundays"
2826193,Wensel,2014-05-22 19:42:00,132,Who eats when your fishing in Canada?
2826337,BuckeyeBill,2014-05-22 20:40:00,76,"Ok guys, what happened to Knobbys? It's been a few years since I have been to Sioux Lookout but I can remember enjoying eating there and watching the planes take off. It's going to be my sons first trip to this area and I was wanting to take him to Knobbys."
2826433,BenBeattie,2014-05-22 21:12:00,232,There's nothing wrong with it. A different catering company took it over. It's a little fancier and a little more expensive. I use the term fancy loosely! Its still got the mounts on the wall but new carpeting and the bulletin board of dollar bills etc. is gone.
2828545,BuckeyeBill,2014-05-23 18:43:00,76,"Thanks Ben. I will definitely take him to Knobbys for a meal. Getting close, can't wait!!"
2829265,tv4fish,2014-05-24 05:56:00,2694,"Ben - I think we noticed that some of the items WERE gone - in particular that nice walleye stringer that used to be hanging on the south wall. Knobby's was REALLY great back when they had the ""all you can eat"" breakfast buffet."
2829345,zeebee,2014-05-24 06:26:00,1144,Tims for good food? They cant even make coffee with flavour. All their offerings are made to have no taste. Mass marketed vanilla.
2829385,BenBeattie,2014-05-24 07:06:00,232,"That stringer of walleye on the South wall was there 2 weeks ago, so unless they moved it since then it's there. They cleaned the place up a bit but the menu is definitely the biggest change. The food isn't bad at all. They'll continue to do well."
2829905,pjshorthorn,2014-05-24 10:36:00,5654,"The Lamplighter definitely has had a great breakfast over the years. Started staying there in 1982 on my first trip to Lac Seul where we camped on Taylor Island in tents. Knobby's was good back in the day and sounds like it is doing well for both breakfast and dinner. Dick and Nellie's was a place we would hit to watch the latest hockey games ( conference finals or finals) after coming out of the woods - sports bar atmosphere and menu similar for that type of place. We usually finished up the last night of the houseboat trip at the ""Hudson Hilton"" ( we made up the name) - old white house/bar up the hill and above the houseboat landing in Hudson. Heard it burned down a number of years ago......it was a joint, but back in the day you could get a steak/lobster dinner. Anybody remember that place? Ran into a group there from Marshfield, WI one year.....the drive home the next day was no bueno PjShorthorn"
2830433,jaym,2014-05-24 17:33:00,89,Is the Wellington open on Sundays for dinner?
2830465,BenBeattie,2014-05-24 18:12:00,232,I'm not sure give em a call. 807 737 4030
2822425,Bitinlight,2014-05-21 20:47:00,95,I will be in Sioux Lookout a week from Sunday. Looking for a place with good food. Looking for a menu better than what Knobby's was last year. Anybody got any suggestions? Can't understand why more places are not open on Sundays.
2822889,Yaba,2014-05-21 23:52:00,88,"You can try the golf club, dick and nellies and Sioux now has a Tim Hortens....Tims will be open for sure!"
2823041,Skywagon,2014-05-22 04:53:00,1106,Not much selection in Sioux Lookout.
2823345,bigwalleye1,2014-05-22 06:29:00,2632,"Took 2 trips to Lac Seul last year, and we typically stop for coffee and donuts on the way to the lake every morning. I like Horton's in general, and tried hard to give them my busiess every day for 2 different weeks, one in June and one in July. The last straw was when we showed up, we could have our choice of any of the ONE flavor of donuts, but we'd have to wait for coffee. Lots of staff weren't there yet. Not to turn this into a Horton's rant thread, but if you're gonna depend on Tim's to feed you, you better bring food."
2823353,tv4fish,2014-05-22 06:31:00,2694,For a good breakfast - we now go to the Wellington - we used to go to Knobby's (no more). The Wellington is on the main drag - west of Knobby's - it is right east of the new Tim Horton's. They have gas pumps out front (on the east side of their bldg.).
2823809,geomax,2014-05-22 08:09:00,29,"For Breakfast you can go to the Lamplighter Motel, one of the better places.For Supper outside of Sunday the Forest Inn is pretty good, but ya Sundays you are very limited."
2823849,BenBeattie,2014-05-22 08:13:00,232,x2 on the wellington!
2823953,tv4fish,2014-05-22 08:28:00,2694,Well - there you go We ALL know that the locals know the best place(s) to eat.
2824273,rockape,2014-05-22 09:49:00,215,Wellington for me too!
2824737,Yaba,2014-05-22 11:56:00,88,Forest Inn used to have a good breakfeast.
