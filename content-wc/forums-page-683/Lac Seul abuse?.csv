Like I said if the lodge is good the word will get out by word of mouth. I can get in anywhere I please, have been going to Canadian resorts for over 30 years but go to lodges that other fisherman have promoted, not hte lodge owner. So a word of advice, let others promote you and the magazines and you just run your lodge to the best you can. Thanks"

560444,Guest,2006-08-18 17:01:00,0,"On a lake in the Dryden area I know of three lodges and at least two guiding businesses that are taking people up to Lac Seul for day trips. Just wondering how lodge owners and locals on Lac Seul feel about this situation. I can't see the business sense in doing this, nor do I think it's very ethical. Perhaps this is one of the pitfalls of overpromoting a good thing. Would be curious to hear of anyones experience with one of these trips and why you wouldn't just stay on Lac Seul."
560445,Guest,2006-08-18 17:48:00,0,"What difference does it make? If you pay for a guided fishing service you expect to catch fish. Know if I were given a choice it would be ""take me to the best lake"". Worse part is word of mouth will hurt a fishery more than anything else."
560448,Guest,2006-08-18 20:36:00,0,I guess I don't see any issues with it.
560452,Guest,2006-08-18 21:35:00,0,"Dont think it will hurt Lac Seul. Limits and slots protect that fishery. Lots of water,lots of fish."
560453,Jimmy Jig,2006-08-18 21:39:00,1905,What difference does it make whether you stay in Sioux Lookout or Dryden? If you stay on or around Lac Seul you fish it every day. If you drive up from Dryden on a day trip you take one limit out. This site promotes Lac Seul more that any other. Its no wonder everyone wants to go there.
560460,Guest,2006-08-19 09:54:00,0,I see you promote your camp quite often. do you have a web site? Is it a brand new camp? Where are you located? How has your year been?
560461,Guest,2006-08-19 11:51:00,0,"Yes, lets get some more details. It's likely fair to assume you are located on the reserve, as it's next-to-impossible to get MNR approval for a new resort anywhere else in the central part of the lake. Thus you must be very close to Mahkwa. Have you built up a whole new resort there? New cabins? Is it a boat-in? (because the bridge isn't finished yet. And that's another thing, don't get me started on that) What do you offer that Mahkwa wouldn't?"
560466,Skyraptor,2006-08-19 13:45:00,291,"I don't see any issues with it either, it's like the people who live in Illinois and come to Wisconsin all the time. Do you think that they should just stay in their own state or venture into other parts of the country and taste what the other states have to offer. Sounds like LS Adventures is greedy and wants the people all to himselves. I hate lodge owners that have to promote themselves hear. If you run a good,clean, quality camp other people will promote it for you."
