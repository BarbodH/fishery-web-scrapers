559974,NAV165,2006-08-03 09:07:00,412,Any comments on fishing this lake? I have a chance to go for a few days next week. Short notice and an 8 hour drive for 2 1/2 days of fishing and wondering if it's worth the time and expense? I prefer fishing for walleyes and smallies but I've heard the perch fishing is good too but I really don't want to make the trip just for perch.

He told me that this lake was a perfect walleye lake. ON the way up we stopped at Rydens and they asked where we were going. The just said that the lake was ""DEAD""."
560524,Guest,2006-08-21 18:49:00,0,Whiefish is a great winter lake. It is shallow and very weedy. You would be better off going to Lac Des Mille Lacs. About the same distance with great Walleye and Northern.

There are plenty of walleye and perch in there, but you need to know the spots on spots to get many walleye. I mainly fish walleye on Whitefish in the winter, but they are there all the time.

But remember, that comes from a NWO resident perspective, by someone surrounded by several outstanding fisheries, so it is all relative. If you catch zero fish wherever you're from, then perhaps yes, it would be worth it. But as was mentioned in another response, you could go a short distance further and likely get better fishing. Also, you should post your question on the thunderbayfishing.com message board. That board is filled with us NWO residents who fish places like Whitefish often, because of its proximity to Thunder Bay (particularly in winter) as an inland lake. NWO Fishing Bum"
