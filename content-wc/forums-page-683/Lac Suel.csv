Last year we stayed arounf Taylor, fished Pine Point, Chamberlain Narrows areas W/out much success. Numbers were down, but size was decent. Seems whenever we moved, we'd pick up a few fish, but then it would die. Any tips out there would be appreciated in terms of keeping our kids busy catching fish, thanks folks."
