560296,eyewitness,2006-08-14 13:29:00,680,"Am leaving for Lac Seul Friday (I know this is last minute) and need some good big pike areas to focus on or my buddies flying in from Texas are gonna string me up.. I just found out my 'go to' spot is all but impossible to get to due to low water conditions and so I am in a quandry over where to go. I will be staying in the central part of the lake near Makwa Lodge and know the lake fairly well from Rocky point all the way to the East almost to the Bear Narrows area. I will have limited time to focus on finding some big pike areas as we will be spending most of our three days catching eyes, so any help anyone can give me to point me to some key areas would be a God send. If posting that info. on here is uncomfortable, I can direct email. Thanks in advance for your help!"

With the water temp what it is and the water levels a bit low, spoons, spinners, and larger stick baits run slowly through and around the weeds will produce. I understand that your buddies want to fish Pike, but personally I don't really want them in my boat, slimey, stinky, bug attracting B######s. Get them fishing for walleyes and they will thank you. Good luck."

I was staying in the area you are going. There are alot of weedbeds to the east of BN, so check it out. I imagine the water temps are still fairly high, so remember to check the deep water, especially on points for deep pike..............but be very slow and careful when bringing them up. good fishing"

However I have been told by a reputable source that the water is low right now. Of course I will know when I get there what that truly means.....Have you ever tried back up in the far north of Aldous Bay? Never been up there, but it looks like it might have some flow coming into it and possible some good weed beds too."
