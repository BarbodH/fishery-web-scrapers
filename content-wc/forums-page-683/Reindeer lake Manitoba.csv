558974,Northern Manitoban,2006-06-29 23:41:00,195,"Looking at planning a trip to Reindeer lake for trout and Pike and possibly Arctic Greyling, anyone have any info to share on there experiences fishing this massive lake I would appreciatte it. It will be a 6 to 7 hour drive for me as I live in Northern Manitoba and I know the road conditions heading up this way so road info I'm familiar with just lake info and launch info from Kinnasao would be great.Thanks....NM"
559015,Guest,2006-07-02 20:07:00,0,"N.M. there is a public boat launch right there in town, the road up there is gravel with several washboard areas, it is hard on your rig. Have fished Reindeer twice, both times were right around the first of September and we were after trout, they were spawning around the shore line and the action was hot. If you leave the launch and keep the shoreline to your right for 12 to 15 miles it will keep you in Manitoba waters, can't help you with the pike, haven't had time to fish for them there yet, too much water, too little time."
559094,Northern Manitoban,2006-07-05 20:28:00,195,Thanks for the reply we are thinking next June trout will be shallow still. Is there some kind of store at the boat launch? we were thinking about camping on a Island. Thanks again...NMhttp://www.xtremesportfishing.com/forum

559643,Northern Manitoban,2006-07-22 15:37:00,195,"Is there any hotels one could stay at in Kinasao? we were thinking that if not then there are many Islands to camp on, What is the reef situation like on Reindeer I would like to travel maybe an hour or two to some far area's to get away from more heavely fished area's and to maybe find where the bigger trout are.I also heard that if it does storm out it's easy to get out of the elements waves etc because of the amount of Islands on this lake... Thanks...NM"
559657,Guest,2006-07-22 22:49:00,0,"N.M., I don't think there is any hotels in Kinasao, but when you come into town and go past the general store on your left, and the public boat launch on your right, if you follow the trail to the end it will take you to Grand Slam lodge. www.grandslamlodge.com Floyd olson is the owner he could hook you up with a place to stay either there or farther out on the lake. He will also guide you to whatever you want to go after. For me , the lake is so big that hiring a guide at least for the first time is almost a must, we hired Floyd 2 years ago for trout, would have never made it on our own, but last year we did go out without a guide , using a gps and good maps and were able to find the trout and return safely. As for the reefs, yes they are there, the water is crystal clear and you can see them on a sunny day, but that won't help you on a cloudy day. Floyd's phone is 204-356-8648 that is a answer machine in lynn Lake or 356-758-3188 at the lodge."

560475,Guest,2006-08-19 20:16:00,0,"N.M I've made two trips so far to the Lynn Lake area and getting ready to make a third around labor day, but haven't made it up to Reindeer yet this year. Been searching to find closer lakes to the cabin that has good lake trout, as it is a 3 hour drive from Lynn lake to Kinasao over a washboard road. And gas at Lynn Lake was 1.26 a litre, but if you've never fished there you should make the trip, you may even prefer it over Reed. First week of September the trout will be spawning and striking at a dinner spoon with a treble hook on it. The road from Thompson to Lynn Lake ,you should carry with you a can of fix a flat, as the rocks that are on the road are like razors. Was driving a rental car the last trip with brand new tires on it and ruined one on that road, cost me an extra 110 dollars."
560499,Northern Manitoban,2006-08-20 17:21:00,195,"Thanks again, have you heard of Todd lake its up around Lynn guys from town here fish this lake and it has lakers not far from lynn kind of a rough road into it but they got a 20 foot Alaskan in there I believe they went up Laurie river also to some lake trout lake. I looked at the info you gave me and that fellow said he would guide us for one day on Reindeer and we would cabin it for a day or two then camp on a Island this is what we hope to do next year.I just want to experience a different body of water. I recently fished the Red River for cats was awesome anyways let me know how you do this fall up this way do you still have the two cabins you mentioned selling one? Dave"
560503,Guest,2006-08-20 19:22:00,0,"Dave, sold the cabin closest to Lynn Lake, the taxes where high , kept one 25 miles east of town. Fished Todd in June , good lake, hard to get into , really need a 4 wheel drive and a rig you don't mind giving abuse to. Will be going back through you're neck of the woods in about a week and a half, can't wait."
