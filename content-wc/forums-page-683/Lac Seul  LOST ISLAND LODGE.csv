559905,Guest,2006-08-01 15:29:00,0,"You do not need a guide to catch walleyes on Lac Seul. Use your sonar and look around wind blown points, islands and mid-lake reefs until the bottom of your screen has a steady line of fish. Then hover right over the fish with either a jig and minnow, jig and half a crawler or a jig and plastic. It is not hard. I have never had a guide on Lac Seul and I don't even stay at a lodge, where the staff should give you a map with proven spots and hazards. Have a great trip."
559944,Guest,2006-08-02 09:22:00,0,"Big Louie, I agree you dont NEED a guide to catch fish on Lac Seul. However a guide who is on the lake everyday and knows the spots that are currently holding fish at the time you are there will allow you to increase your catch amount and increase the quality of the fish you catch. Besides that most of these guides cook a shore lunch that is to die for. Even on Lac Seul 80% of the fish are in 20% of the water....and most guides know where that 20% is."

560438,Guest,2006-08-18 12:21:00,0,"They travel to different parts of the lake that produce better at that time of year. You can catch fish all over Lac Seul, but different areas are better for big fish different times of the year. The reason that people go there are that they run a first class operation and have terrific track record. How's yours? We will keep going with one of the best on Lac Seul and that is Lost Island Lodge"
560442,Guest,2006-08-18 14:47:00,0,"We were up at Lac Seul last week for the 1st time. We're usually at Minaki. But, one thing I can say without hessitation is that nobody needs a guide on Lac Seul. I fished every main lake hump I could find between our cabin (Goose Bay Lodege)and McKenzie Bay and caught fish at every single stop. Our first fishing stop out of Goose Bay Camp on the 1st morning wasn't 500 yards from the dock. I dropped my line in at 16' and within less than a minute I caught my first Lac Seul Walleye. It was 24"". During the depths of summer you're more likely to find points and shoreline structure without fish. Walleyes, on every lake, prefer main lake, wind driven, reefs during the heat of summer. The best reefs top out at roughly 6 feet and when the wind is really blowing you'll often find the biggest fish right on top. That can be said about virtually every quality Walleye fishery with the possible exception of the Great Lakes. There is an unmarked reef on McKenzie just to the east and slightly north of the channel entrance to the bay (from the west) that tops out at 2 feet (be careful). We were out there by the morning of day two. The wind was prevailing out of the south for a few days so I knew they'd be packed in on the south side of the reef. From 6 to 20 feet we caught all we could in a stetch of several hours. Many, many triples. Average again in the 20"" class. Just fish anything that is main lake and tops out at less than 25 feet. Every single one will have fish. Always start on the side the wind has been driving into. They are always the most aggressive. Usually, the bigger fish will be on the next deeper shelf than the 17-20 inchers. It doesn't matter what you use. Minnows, leeches, crawlers, lindy's or jigs. Heck, I even caught them on bare jigs. They all work very, very well. I like a jig tipped with a leech because they can often last for several fish. If you know how to locate schools and properly work srtucture you'll have no problem getting tired from all the fish you'll reel in. One other thing, you need a boat that can get you there in a reasonable amount of time. The farthest I went was the main Lac Seul body roughly 38-42 miles out. I found a 20 foot reef in the largest section of open water. Far and away the most fish and very few under 18 inches. It was baron of boats and it was windy and the fish were voracious. So, you don't need help you need your eyes (on your graph) and you need your brain to implement what you already know. Just remember to stay on your GPS trails when you go home. The danger is all over the place. In the end I ended up with over 80 waypoints of productive fishing spots. That's a lot of places to fish in 6 days."
560446,Mike Kansas,2006-08-18 19:00:00,1463,Lost Island is an excellent Resort with a reputation for service. I would think that if I was just starting a new Lodge like Lac Seul Adventures that I would try to learn from the successful operations and not take potshots at them. You have done yourself no favors by your action and if Lac Seul Adventures is going to be succesful you should take your foot out of your mouth and put it back on the ground.
560454,Guest,2006-08-18 22:07:00,0,Pretty sad Lac Suel Adventures has to go on a make their own postings about them selves...seeings as no one else has n e thing good to say about them....

We caught a few that day and one of the guys with you caught a 32"" walleye. Do you remember me I was in the green boat that followed you out that day."

559865,Guest,2006-07-31 11:33:00,0,Good thinking.....It's well worth it to make sure you get on fish. Lac Seul is a great Walleye Fishery but you have to be on the fish and the late summer pattern requires knowledge of the lake to get on schools of fish. Hope you have a great first time Lac Seul experience and catch one for me. Katchabigone
559344,Mike Kansas,2006-07-12 18:22:00,1463,"During the summer with the Walleye being on main lake structure you will have to make some decent runs at almost any Lodge you stay at. The runs from Lost Island are not that bad and they are to some excellent fishing areas. The outdoor biffies worked well for us and we had four women along. The camp is well lighted at night and mosquitos surprisingly enough were almost non existent. Your gas with the boat they supply you is included so the long run is not more expensive and we saw Moose everyday. To each his own but I started fishing Canada in 1955 and I liked and will be back to Lost Island Lodge and its friendly staff. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
559346,wooglin,2006-07-12 19:34:00,371,"If people are really concerned about Lost Island and fish in that area, I can attest to it that there are fish within 5 miles of that place - I've been catching them in that area for 4 years. Now, when the weather goes arry, we do have to work for them. But, that goes for ALL parts of the lake. Plus, boating to and from your 'hot spot' is half the fun. The wildlife and scenery is amazing. It's still neat to see where the fires went through a few years back over North of Deception."
559378,Guest,2006-07-13 14:25:00,0,""">But the deciding reason was the fact that they have no indoor toilets. You have to walk outside in the middle of the night, swat >mosquitos, take your flashlight and stumble over to the common >biffy area. That didn't apeal to me at all."" Sounds like the lady across the street who wanted to go camping with us but needed an indoor toiler and a shower.... not camping. I'd rather have this situation than some of the dilapatated septic systems I've seen at other camps where you might as well do your business at the shores edge as that's where it ends up anyway."
559385,orchard frank,2006-07-13 19:36:00,1900,"Went to Lost Island, usually twice a year for 13 years.Been to many lodges over the years, once we went there, no reason to go elsewhere.Believe me, lots of fish in sight of the island. The Narrows, Sen Bay, Grassy, all are GREAT places, no doubt, and lots of unexplored reefs and points up there. After years of driving all over the place, we decided to try and stick close except for a day or two. Lots of great places amoung the islands just to the west of the lodge, can be seen from the end dock. Kewatin Bay could provide a lifetime of fishing, maybe 10 minutes away. English River mouth, same story. We always stayed in cabin 6, caught a ton of fish casting from shore right in front of it in the evenings. Basil is one of the all time great guides, ask him about the custom rod he won for being the best. Tell him Frank is still growing apples and shooting deer, and will be up to see him and everybody else one of these years. Good Luck"

Don't get me riled or I'll come over there to MN.(land of perpetually lame football teams) and take the belt to your punk ####. Why, back in my days we had it rough. Try sleeping in water filled stinking leech holes in the swamps of Guadalcanal,Borneo or Mindanao,never knowing if you'll wake up or have your throat cut in the night by some Jap. We didn't have no mosquito spray,game boys,suntan lotion,or GPS. Men were men and sissy boys like you couldn't make it past the first 20 mile march. Just because I am a geezer now and like to pee inside is no reason to call me a lady. I've earned my luxury."

559225,Guest,2006-07-10 16:05:00,0,"Tim, Take 1/4 oz and 3/8 0z jigs ( charteruse, orange, white, yellow) use as light a jig as you can that allows you to get to the bottom...stay on or close to the bottom.. You can get minnows at the camp but going in August it might be a good idea to pick up a lb of leechs at a bait shop before you get there. The Lodge Owner will give you a map of the area and they will be happy to help you get to the fish. They also have Guides avaliable for $150 a day and you might want to try to schedule one your first day to get the lay of the land. Good Luck, Mike PS take a good camera for the boys pictures with fish."
559232,Guest,2006-07-10 17:14:00,0,"Mike: Always enjoy your posts, as it appears you have a lot of experience with Lac Seul and are willing to check out various resorts; we have been going to Lost Island for the last six years and think it is first rate; however, this year, in order to save the long runs, we have decided to rent a houseboat and park it up by Sen or Bear Narrows; if you don't mind I would like your opinion on how fishing in this area of Lac Seul compares to other areas you have been to, and, how Lost Island compares to other Lodges. Tim: We will be up there the week after you; you might want to bring crawlers also; worked on a jig or crawler harness, they can be a hot ticket; I would also stongly suggest to try to get Basil as a guide for the first day or so; he is top notch and a great guy.

Ill tell you what, dosnt sound like much fun to me...:banging:"
559244,Mike Kansas,2006-07-10 21:44:00,1463,"Surfer, I would rate Lost Island as one of the top two Resorts I have been to on Lac Seul. Have only been to six so its unfair to say anymore than that. Since it was our first time there we used Basil as a guide. Had to keep the wives happy and put them on fish. He made the week for all of us especially our wives. It was a new part of the lake and he put us on fish every day. I have been going to Lac Seul four times a year for the last few years and my trip with my wife is always great. She loves to fish but my favorite trip every year is in June to Black Bay Outpost out of Lac Seul Lodge. It is a chance to fish shallow water and catch Walleye in post spawn moving out to the main lake. Our group has been there the last 17 years so we are very familar with that part of the lake and that really helps us be on fish. It has been the same group almost every year and it is the only time we fish together except for a fall trip to Venice La. Great bunch of guys and good friends. After all fishing is about having fun with the people who are important in your life....catching fish is a nice bonus. Good Luck, Mike"

559295,Guest,2006-07-12 08:16:00,0,"the long runs to good fishing areas are one of the reasons I bypassed Lost Island when booking a camp this summer.

You have to walk outside in the middle of the night, swat mosquitos, take your flashlight and stumble over to the common biffy area. That didn't apeal to me at all.

559210,Guest,2006-07-10 13:20:00,0,"Mike Just curious what size of walleye you are catching in Lac Seul. You said you caught 1200 but are they 14 inchers, 18 inchers or 20 inchers. Also, how many people are in your camp and how long did how many days did you fish. If there are 10 peolpe in your group and you fish 7 days that is 17 fish per person a day. Scott"
559211,Guest,2006-07-10 13:23:00,0,Mike I hate to be the negative person but an hour and a half to get to a spot to fish. Isn't there any place closer where you could catch fish. Where I go I have a 5 minute boat ride and the rod and reel are out. scott
559215,Guest,2006-07-10 14:48:00,0,I dont disagree but when the place you are staying is a spring structure area and the fish are main lake on humps it seems best to ride and enjoy the scenery and catch fish. Besides that we fish our way out there but our first stop is still 40 minutes from camp. We spend about 9 hours a day on the lake with 2 1/2 hours of total travel time.
559217,Guest,2006-07-10 14:57:00,0,"Five days....4 to 8 people (wives say in sometime)....70% of fish 19"" to 22""...biggest 28"" my wife caught 5 over 26""...average around 40 fish per person per day. Does not count Pike which were thick and heavy a couple of days...YUK I dislike Pike....but fun to catch ...just keep them out of the boat."
