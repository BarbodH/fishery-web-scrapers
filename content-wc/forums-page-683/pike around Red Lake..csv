560103,Guest,2006-08-08 11:06:00,0,"I've always heard the first week that the camps are open is the best week for big Pike. I haven't gone then, but I've seen the pictures. Big Fish!"
560119,Guest,2006-08-08 20:28:00,0,"Pikeman, I can't speak for Red Lake itself, but just south of there around Perrault Falls I fish several different weeks with the main target big northern, and I would say that fall...late fall...is your best shot at a true trophy. Here's why: The big ones that have spent the entire summer out in cool, deep water, are moving back into shallower weed edges and rock points with one thing in mind, feeding. They are feeding on larger ciscos and tullibees that migrate into shallower water in late fall. In addition, they have accumulated alot of eggs to go along with there increased body fat which really makes them look girthy for CPR photos! Also, alot of the areas that are too weedy to troll in the summer now have the weeds going down and you can cover alot of ground without reeling in all the time to clean hooks. If I had my choice I would go anytime in the month of Sept, the middle part probably being ideal. If you get too much later than that your playing Russian roullette with the weather. Mike"

560394,Guest,2006-08-16 18:15:00,0,I second the middle of Sept. Dress warm. I target the weed edges of large flats near main lake points and shallow areas between two islands or an island and shore. Last year I stayed just south in the chain on Gullrock Lake. Most luck using larger baits. I also fished the Winnipeg and English Rivers for many years and found the same to be true. Most of my largest were caught early morning and late afternoon.
560443,Guest,2006-08-18 16:18:00,0,Fall is very good for monster Pike. I've caught some monsters while tracking down the big Walleyes. 40 inch + is common in Red Lake and we've caught them deep. They seem to be feeding on the eyes. Battle scars are also common on the big ones while they fight for home turf. I've pulled in some 10 pounders with teeth marks covering the whole belly. Last year I was spinning for wallees and caught a 25 pounder. This guy was so old he's teeth were black.... I was using my ugly stick with 20 lbs test and trolling with my big motor in high winds. I use that techniques once in a blue moon to cover large areas. Also caught a 27 inch walleye that same day. GO figure. Happy Hunting... Mista W
560514,Guest,2006-08-21 09:36:00,0,"Fishing on Red Lake this past weekend and I could not believe how aggressive the Northerns were.....We were trying to pre-fish for the upcoming Walleye Classic this labor day weekend and everywhere we went, the northerns were aggressively chasing down our walleyes. On at least five occassions, we would set the hook on a monster and by the time the fish got to the boat, it was a small walleye thankful that it escaped the jaws of a northern. On three other occassions, northerns followed our walleyes right to the boat. Some of these walleyes were not small either. In addition to all of this activity, we probably caught 10 plus northerns. One northern we caught twice. I know this as it still had the jig in its mouth from previously snapping my partners line. Biggest northern of the day was 44"". It was a fun day but not a successful pre-fish outing for the upcoming walleye tournament. Biggest walleye was 24"". Good luck anglers....."
