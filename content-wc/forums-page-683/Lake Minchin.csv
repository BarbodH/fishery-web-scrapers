560395,guidedfishing,2006-08-16 18:46:00,531,Has anyone fished this lake located north of Ignace actually north of Savant. It appears to be right off the main high way. I like to try something new and will be up in the area again in a few weeks. Any information at all on Minchin would be appreciated. GF
560401,Mlaker,2006-08-16 21:08:00,81,We used to fish there a lot.Mostly in the 80's. Somewhere around the early 90's numbers and quality of walleye's dropped dramtically. I used to know a few people that would go there routinely as well. I don't know of anyone that has been back in the last 3-4 years as the walleye fishing had dropped off that much. There are still some real quality northerns in the lake tho. Our info was that the natives netted the lake quite heavily. There is some kind of a native camp on the south shore. If you give it a try please post how you did.

Patterns lures etc. I usually head up 2 to 3 times each year and make it a point to explore at least one lake I have not fished before so any input / advice is welcome. Thanks GF"

At the boat launch, which is very steep by the way, wouldn't even try it without a 4 wheel drive. Anyway go right from the launch as the lake opens up you will see an island, troll around it ,we used night crawler harneses. Then as you go further down the lake from there just fish the points and around islands, and like almost every lake, fish the windy side of them. There is also a good sized lake across the road from Minchin that has a camp ground on it."
560479,guidedfishing,2006-08-19 22:20:00,531,"Thanks for the info, Is the landing solid enough to get traction when taking a boat out? Any other info is appreciated, is the landing easy to find off the main road, what should a person be looking for, or know when they have gone to far?"
560502,Guest,2006-08-20 19:15:00,0,"The road runs pretty close to the lake, the trail to the landing is on a curve , the road curves to the right, the lake is on your left, it is about 45 miles north of Savant Lake, the lake that has the campground, can't think of the name right now, it is a bit farther up on the right , if you get to there then you've gone passsed Minchin. The landing is usually dry but very steep, it is gravel, sand mix, to pull out a heavy boat you will need a 4 wheel drive, the risk would be too great with a 2 wheel drive as it might not bring it up out of there. i've put myself in that situation before and it wasn't pretty. Minchin is the first big lake on the left after traveling quite a distance north of Savant Lake."
560506,guidedfishing,2006-08-20 19:50:00,531,"Thanks H-C so many lake so little time, will try and make a day of it. We will be on Sturgeon, very comfortable, my trips earlier in the year are all camping so look forward to September and the bunk at the end of the day. Any other lakes in the area you would suggest. I have fished Flat Rock, Arethusa, Press, Sturgeon, Lake of Bays on a regular basis. Flat Rock and Arethusa really get pounded and I have seen the numbers and size go down in the last few years, press has good numbers not much size, still good producers but better lakes in the area by far. Look forward to giving Minchin a go, always like to give new water a try. Other than a couple of 15 - 17 inchers for lunch everything else goes back anyway. Have really come to chase Lakers in the last few years as well. Thanks for the info, understood on the landing had a truck that would not go into 4 wheel one day, that got a little hairy, good thing I was not fishing along and we had a tow strap. Things can go bad very quickly. I always chalk the tires now. Thanks GF"
