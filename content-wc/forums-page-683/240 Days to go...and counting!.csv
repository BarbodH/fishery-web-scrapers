We'll have to go to Dryden to get to their new place next year, they're moving from Clearwater. We'll be doing Dogfly Lake...Pike, Lakers, Smallmouth, and a portage to get the walleyes. I hope each of you had a good summer and that all is well in the land. Regards, Rob in Florida."

560459,Skylane,2006-08-19 06:13:00,101,Is L and M going to be operating out of Dryden? Any details? Just curious. Thanks.
560470,Guest,2006-08-19 16:15:00,0,Yea L&M moving? The Off Lake camp was a good place to stay onernight the night before you fly-out. Guess Dryden will work out better for them. Never been to Dogfly but it looks like a good camp.

Not sure I would do it again but the Sept trip is on and should be much cooler.Soon, I will be at 350 days again. I don't start counting until I'm unpacked and over the euphoria of the trip. I really don't get excited until I'm under 180 days! Enjoy."
