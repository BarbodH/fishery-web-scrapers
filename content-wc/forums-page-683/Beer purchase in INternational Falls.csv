560540,Guest,2006-08-22 11:36:00,0,I am traveling through International Falls on Friday late could be as late as 11:30pm or 12:00am Saturday. Do the Beer stores stay open late or are they closed by then? If they close early is there a place around Diluth to buy beer? I need about 18 cases and I don't want to haul it from Illinios if I don't have to.
560543,Guest,2006-08-22 12:53:00,0,The beer stores aren't open that late. There are several places to get beer in Duluth but your best bet is just south of the bridge as your going through Superior on the left hand side of the road.

I just felt the need to throw that out there, just in case you were one of the truly uninformed. Unless of course you have a bus load then have fun. Or you were going to try your luck and try lying to the border patrol, in that case....well, good luck with that!"

The border crossing folks heading into CA were professional, courteous and friendly. Heading back into the US they were strictly business."
560563,Guest,2006-08-22 17:45:00,0,"Do the math. I went up the last week of June. I brought 3 cases of Miller Lite & paid duty on 2 of the cases. In Illinois the beer cost $13 a case. I had to pay $9 duty per case. Total cost $66 dollars. Now go to a beer store and pay $48 a case for molson. $144 OUCH. Oh yeah, cigarettes are now $11.00 per pack with the new tax increase from July 1st. Enjoy."
