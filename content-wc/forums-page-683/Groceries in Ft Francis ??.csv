560469,Guest,2006-08-19 16:08:00,0,Hey fishing people... did I read a post here stating that there was a Wal-Mart in Ft Francis? Is it a Super W.M. that sells food and liqour or just a regular W.M.?
560478,Guest,2006-08-19 22:19:00,0,Why go to wall-mart when the best grocery store is the Safeway just three blocks east on 11 from the border crossing. Its open 8to11 Monday thru Saturday. You can get everything you need except for the beer.

Going to safeway takes you out of your way by about ten blocks, unless you're heading up towards Dryden. Don't bother with Walmart, they have groceries, but not everything you need."
