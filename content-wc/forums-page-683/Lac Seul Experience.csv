560378,Whitewater,2006-08-16 08:24:00,6,"tharder, I had the same experience. After 13 years of fishing at Minaki we went to Lac Suel on the NW side this year. I can only say I must have been an idiot to have waited so long to switch. Minaki and Sand Lake are barren of fish compared to Lac Suel. The guys were giggled like girls over the quantity and quality of the fish. I've done fly-ins that werent nearly this good. We didn't use a guide, just had the camp owner point out some good areas and we found the fish ourselves."
560381,Mike Kansas,2006-08-16 09:18:00,1463,"Jim, Four of the Resorts are on Lac Seul and all of them have excellent cabins and service. Evergreen is by Ear Falls on the north end of the lake, Lac seul Lodge is on the west shore about 15 miles south of Ear Falls, Lost Island Lodge is on the south shore near the town of Hudson Ontario. All three of these Resorts have housekeeping cabins that allow you to do your own cooking and their prices are very comparable. Silver Water Wheel is on the south shore and has a deluxe Amercian Plan. Little Canada Camp is on the English River below the dam at Ear Falls. It has easy access to town and is very comfortable. You will catch fish at all these Resorts and they all will treat you great. Check out the websites and if you have any nother questions feel free to email me at [email protected] Good Luck, Mike Kansas"

560384,tlars,2006-08-16 11:19:00,137,"I have also stayed at Lost Island Lodge and Evergreen with my wife. Great place that are well run by very knowledgable folks. We were on a housekeeping plan at both places. Both are very clean. Last I knew, Lost Island offered a limited American Plan service. Evergreen is strictly housekeeping. Silver Water Wheel is another story. They offer a different level of service at a different price point. I'm heading back there in 5 weeks for my third trip. They offer excellent service at a fair price. All in all, Lac Seul offers the trip of a lifetime year after year."
560385,tharder,2006-08-16 11:44:00,192,"We spent the first three days on McKenzie Bay and closer. The fishing was excellent on McKenzie. We were hoping for bigger fish and decided to move to the next bay. The map didn't give the bay a name but it appeared to be Manitou Narrows. The fishing was even better in the narrows. Beyond the narrows is the main Lac Seul body. It's dotted with islands with many unidentified main lake humps. Every single hump I pulled up on (topping out at roughly 20 feet) had fish, and in big numbers. There is no doubt the further you're willing to go pays you big dividends. The last spot my boat fished was loaded with 20-24"" fish. I stayed on the one reef for 5 hours and the three guys in my boat (including me) caught somewhere around 200 fish, all in the 20-24"" class. Heck, I quit fishing for an hour cuz it was really rough and I had caught so darn many. I decided to take a break and just run the boat for a little while. It was so rough that I even had one wave come over my splash guards (Yar-Craft 2095 BT, Yam F150, Power tiller steering) and absolutely soaked me. The winds had to be close to 25 mph and quartering the waves to get back was a bit uncomfortable. I was really impressed by my boat as well. It appears to be designed for lakes like this. All said it is an amazing fishery. And yes, to the poster above, hazards are not marked as they should be. It surely would not take much to get some kind of marking on them. There is a rock sticking several inches out of the water on the North side of McKenzie bay that has no marking and is a serious danger. It is the size of a small house. I went by it at 50mph and didn't see it. I'm certain it might have killed one of us and surely destoyed my boat. We went back and fished it and, you guessed it, it was loaded with fish! Still, it really bothered me that we came that close (30 feet) to really causing some major personal harm and damage to property. You have to be on guard at all times while your running the lake. It doesn't matter where you are or what you think you know. The mountains come out of nowhere and you better be ready for them. All said, it was the best fishing trip, overall, that our group has ever had. We'll definitely be returning in the near distant future. One last thing, Lake of the Woods remains the number one lake (in my mind) when it comes to Walleye size. Every single time you drop your line on LOW you have a chance at a 10 pounder. It may not be fast and furious and it may be too rough to fish at times but, overall, if you're looking for a trophy I'm aware of no lake that can produce like Lake of the Woods."
560397,Guest,2006-08-16 18:55:00,0,"Wev'e been going up for 6 yrs now, it's true the average size is 18"" up to 28"" every year. During the week of fishing your lucky to catch a dozen fish under 18"". Our best day we caught every inch up from 17"" top being 28"". 20"" doubles are not that uncommon"
560400,tharder,2006-08-16 21:07:00,192,"By the way, one last thing; we caught fish from 6 feet to 39 feet. They are just everywhere. As for bait, most of our group (3 boats, 8 guys) used Lindy type rigs but I used, almost to exclusion, the Northland Fireball jig tipped with a leach. I really like this jig. It is flat on the sides so it can get down there quickly and I find the fish, for whatever reason, don't let go. I used a 3/8th oz jig for 6 feet to 40 feet, calm or rough. This is the only jig I've ever used that can be used at any depth and any level of rough conditions. We fished for 6 days and I went through roughly 6-8 of them. One I had to retire cuz it got dull. On average, I out fished my counterparts by 2 or 3 to one. The jig really worked very well. Oh, the color? Metallic Chartreuse. I really like jigs because fish can be released unharmed. Lots of fish had to be released with cut lines from the Lindy fisherman. That's an awful lot of re-tying and a lot of fish down there with hardware in their gullet."
560406,Guest,2006-08-17 08:38:00,0,"Tharder, Can you confirm that is was the Northland Fireball jig that you used? I checked Northland website and the fireball is totally round. You said it has flat sides.Was it a different jig from Northland? I tried several jigs for the first two days on Lac Suel and got so many hang ups that i went to a bottom bouncer even though i tried to fish very vertical. It seemed with 3 guys in the boat we could never get shallower then 14 ft. without someone getting snagged. So we all went with bottom bouncers and that helped for the most part. The most useless weight was the Lindy black ""snagless"" slip sinker. That thing was terrible. We all tried it and gave up on them. thanks"
560410,tharder,2006-08-17 09:48:00,192,"Sorry, it is a Fireball but its the ""Fireball Metallic"". Here it is. I love the short shank and the way the hook is above the weight. It makes for great hook sets.http://www.northlandtackle.com/Category/main.taf?cat=72 The Lindy guys did get hung up a lot and it irritated the heck out of me. You get pretty sick of going back right as you make an approach to go over the school again. When I got hung up (rarely) I just broke it off. I wasn't going to screw up my run, and their chances, just cuz I was hung up. Besides, I can tie on a new one and be down there by the time I reach the school. Most of the time I'd drop it down, reel up the slack and a fish would already have taken it, ahh, one more! Some of these guys aren't all that proficient so it makes problems on bodies that require better acumen. Thank god it wasn't Lake of the Woods, I'd have been going in circles all the time just to get them out. It really is simple; you need to know where the bottom is at all times and stay close to it. If your dragging your Lindy or jig around your going to lose it and probably sooner than later. My boat has a graph on the front also so all they need to do is pay attention. Besides, it's not hard to know when you're coming up an incline, heck, you can feel it, so start bringing in some line otherwise all your doing is dragging an anchor and you can be sure it will set somewhere in that bottom."
560405,Guest,2006-08-17 08:23:00,0,"I was on Lac Seul last week too. As usual the fishing was great, 8th year. How did you like the wind? My wife had to shut her eyes going down Steamboat when the waves made my 17' stand on end. Nasty wind but you have to expect in on that lake. Caught many fish over 22 and largest was 28."
560358,tharder,2006-08-15 17:49:00,192,"Just got back from 6 days of Lac Seul. All I can say is ""amazing"". We've gone to Minaki for the past 11 years (maybe more) and it doesn't hold a candle to Lac Seul. This is an amazing fishery, abosutely amazing! Lac Seul is fairly common, but, working your way back from the west to the main lake is more than I expected. Obviously not many boats, or the operators, have the horse power to do it in a reasonable time (maybe 30+ miles). Well, we do and it was simply amazing. 50-100 fish a day was not uncommon and the size averaged 20 inches with not one over 24.5"". I didn't catch a dozen fish under 16""! Three boats, incredible fishery, great comrodery. It just was an amazing week. It doesn't get better than Lac Seul!!!!!!!!! We had calm days, rough days, storm days and anything in between. It didn't matter!! We just had to change our depths. Just a phenomenal lake, That comes from a seasoned veteran of many Canadian, Quetico, Basswood Lake, Boundary Waters, Lake of the Woods, Mille Lacs and Minaki fishing trips. Lac Seul is an incredible fishery!!!!! The only thing left for me is the English River (in the fall and part of Lac Seul) and Red Lake. They might be able to do it all, lot's of numbers and tremandous size! By the way, we stayed at Goose Bay Camp. It is the cheapest of the Lac Seul resorts. Andria and her crew did a good job but the cabins were lacking. Actually, it was quite primative. Still, the service was very good! It was some 25% less than the neighboring resorts and for those of you that go to fish, not be pampered, this is an excellent choice!"
560361,Guest,2006-08-15 19:05:00,0,Which Lodge do you own???
560362,Illini Bill,2006-08-15 19:19:00,53,That wasn't called for.
560364,tharder,2006-08-15 20:13:00,192,"I live in Bloomington, MN. I don't own any of the lodges. If I did I doubt I'd call one a ""Dump"" would I? Oh well, It was a great trip and the fishing exceptional! This sounds like someone who didn't do so well. If so I'm sorry for that! Next time go farther!"
560365,Guest,2006-08-15 20:31:00,0,"hello, sounds like you guys had a awesome trip, I too was to lac seul for the first time, and I'm hooked we didn't figure out how a nd where to catch em till late in the trip, but once we did, oh yeh. as far as lodges go we stayed at gawleys little beaver lodge witch Is 5 miles south of ear falls. I would highly recomend it is only 45.00 per person per night. they only have 3 cabins but they are very nice and they also have air conditioning plus he has a huge ice maker down by the lake and it is free, witch is a big plus, we fill our livewells everymorning so we can keep our fish cold what a difference that makes. anyway I've been to 5 other canadian lakes and resorts and this is the one I'm stickin with. good luck.... over"
560366,Guest,2006-08-15 20:48:00,0,"tharder, you didn't call it a dump. In fact you complimented the resort. I for one don't like it when lodge owners blow their own horn on WC. It happens and if you are not one.... and I assume you aren't.....I APOLOGIZE!!!!"
560368,Reels,2006-08-15 21:06:00,2876,"I agree Tharder. I have been going to Minaki for 20 years and this year I did both, Minaki and Lac Seul. No Comparison at all. <{{}}><"
560370,Guest,2006-08-15 21:27:00,0,"I know exactly what you're talking about. We were there the second week of July. Only problem we had was it was so hot on Wednesday, (97 degrees) that we had to get off the water. Just no shade out there."
560371,GMANNN,2006-08-15 21:56:00,8,I went to Lac Suel for the first time this past June second that it is a great lake! We did very well. We fished Mckenzie bay for the most part. It was a long boat ride from Timberlane lodge. The one thing that we did not like about it is the amount of underwater obstructions. We chipped the skeg of my buddies 200 optimax and had some one else at the resort do the same. The dock hand said that it happens to a couple of boats a week. I know it is hard however it would be nice if some of the major hazards would get marked. Returning home with a broken skeg put a big damper on a great trip!
560374,Mike Kansas,2006-08-16 07:22:00,1463,"We have been going to Lac Seul for 17 years. The last few years we have made 3 to 4 trips a year. It is a great fishery and the management of it through the slot limit has made it even better. I have been to 6 different Resorts on the lake and all of them but one have been excellent. I would recommend the following Resorts to any Lac Seul first timers. Lac Seul Lodge Evergreen Silver Water Wheel Lost Island Lodge Little Canada Camp (below dam at Ear Falls, great fall fishing) Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
