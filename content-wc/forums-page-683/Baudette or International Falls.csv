560510,CROW BAIT,2006-08-20 21:04:00,3,"I came back across Sunday night 10:30 pm no wait in I Falls. Baudette may only have a 2 lane road but you can make good time. And the duty free coming back to the states does not give you a big choice, but is cheap. We used to stay in Brainerd at the Super8 and shoot up to Baudette from there. That was the best way for us to go."
560221,Guest,2006-08-10 18:15:00,0,How much further is it to Baudette from the Twin Cites then it is to Intrnational Falls.
560225,Guest,2006-08-10 20:30:00,0,My trip planner shows it to be about 56-58 miles. The problem is is that there is no major highway south from Baudette.
560231,Guest,2006-08-10 23:16:00,0,"Get off I35 at Moose Lake, then to Floodwood, to Grand Rapids, to Northome, then up 72 to Baudette. Can make great time on this route, and the drive through the Chippewa National Forest is nice, especially in the fall. Border crossing at Baudette/Rainy River is fast. This route makes sense only if you're staying in Baudette or out of Morson."
560233,Guest,2006-08-10 23:58:00,0,"For coming home, no matter what, I would go through Rainy river. Earlier this year, I had to go to Duluth to pick up neices after our trip to Lake of the woods. Went through Fort Francis and the line to go through the border was EXTREMELY LONG....definitely a 2 - 3 hour wait time. Baudette-Rainy river: 10 minutes MAX. Once you start south of Baudette, things move pretty fast. Not much traffic either, even though it is only a 2 lane road. DEFINITELY worth it, and a lot more miles gained with the gas you would use sitting at the border to come home on 53. Steve"
560243,Guest,2006-08-11 10:03:00,0,I thought Baudette may be the longer route with less 4 lane but I thought we could make it up with shorter lines. Last year we got to the border at Ft Frances and saw the line and drove to Baudette. We still had to wait as the line there was backed up over the bridge. I guess it's a cr*p shoot
560245,Guest,2006-08-11 10:42:00,0,"The bridge is fixed this year, so no lines due to construction. When we crossed two weeks ago on a Friday afternoon we drove across the bridge and right up to the booth, no line at all. Also, you'd be surprised how fast you can go on the two lane, and it's four lane part of the way."
560283,Guest,2006-08-13 20:20:00,0,Just spent 2 hours in line returning to I Falls..saturday afternoon the line was 4 miles long. Aug 12. My son went through Baudette and there was no one in line..you decide.
560285,brian1785,2006-08-13 21:08:00,1534,Coming from N. Illinois I use I.Falls going up and Baudette coming back. I've crossed at Baudette about the last 5 times and it's been no more than a 5 minute wait. I've crossed on Saturdays and weekdays and it's been about the same all those times.
560289,Guest,2006-08-13 22:51:00,0,"Come to think about it, that line at Baudette is about 6 miles long ;-)"
560483,Guest,2006-08-20 07:41:00,0,"Someone tell me if there is a duty free shop at the Rainy River border crossing and if it is set up much the same as Ft. Francis. I usually stop there on the way home to pick up my GST rebate. Its really convenient, no paperwork to send in."
