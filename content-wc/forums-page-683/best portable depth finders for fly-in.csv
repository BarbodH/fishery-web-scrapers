560426,MoWalleyeguy,2006-08-18 08:07:00,409,I think any system you use which is best for YOU can not be all bad. What I like about my system is that I use my 102C and my 3500C on my main boat so this kept me from having another finder just for fly ins...plus the fact that once you use color its hard to go back to b/w or anything smaller. My box cost me $28.00 on ebay. The Ram mount I got on sale for $19.00. The Box (Pelican) is indestructable... you can drive a truck over it. Battery was $19 ea and have lasted 3+ years with no problems. I bought a portable transducer mount for about $25 and I was set.
560431,voyaguer,2006-08-18 09:36:00,54,"And you are welcome. Again, I agree with ""Mo"" - use what you want. Personally I didn't find the arcarde fish blips to catch much of anything by themselves, but if that worked for you - have at it. Now if they could just create a pac man blip that virtually chases down the fish a catches (or eats) them for you - I'd give that a look again. have fun"
560434,Guest,2006-08-18 10:32:00,0,I bought a Clearwater Classic because you could get a different transducer with it that allows me to use it for ice fishing also. I don't think they make the model I have anymore but you might keep it in mind while shopping for yours if you do any ice fishing. I got one of the tip up arms to hold the transducer and it works slick.
560463,Guest,2006-08-19 12:36:00,0,I use an old small childs tackle box with guts and tray removed. Small chunk of foam rubber in the bottom of the box to keep the 2 6volt batts from bouncing around while in travel. The screen of the finder lays on the foam rubber to protect it when not in use. The mount for the fishfinder is mounted in the lid of the old box so when open the battries are in the bottom of box and the screen is in the lid. the transducer is on a Alum. bracket made to clap on the back of the boat. I can use the battries for 2 weeks with out and rundown on battries. So a $89.00 on sale Eagle was the best way to go for me.
560467,Guest,2006-08-19 13:55:00,0,"Eagle and Lowrance seem to be pretty much the same units. I've had them both. Maybe the software in the Lowrance is a more recent release, but I couldn't tell the difference. Most people just turn it on and don't use all the features. Both seemed to eat the same amount of battery and seem to break in the same amount of time. I'm on my second Eagle 320 and it has a very detailed picture and marks the fish very well. All for $150!"
560255,lassh,2006-08-11 14:35:00,553,"I was wondering what the best portable depthfinder is for a fly-in. Consider detail, definition, battery life, type of battery etc. I sometimes can not get the depthfinder to work when at full speed. Any suggestions?"
560262,TECK,2006-08-11 21:03:00,151,still can't beat the green box
560267,Skyraptor,2006-08-12 07:14:00,291,I just bought this year the Eagle Fishmark 320 portable locator and took it to Canada 2 weeks ago and it worked like a charm. Comes in a soft carrying case and has a small motorcycle battery to run the locator and in 5 days of fishing I did not have to charge it at all. The locator runs about $199 and does a great job of marking fish and giving accurate depths. Worth it's weight in gold.
560268,bugsy,2006-08-12 07:21:00,49,Eagle FishEasy II works great & an 8-pack of Duracell D-cells lasts about 1-1/2 weeks. I believe it cost $139.
560274,Dacotah Eye,2006-08-12 12:30:00,2722,I have an Eagle fisheasy also and I found that I could leave the battery holder for the D cells at home as the battery for my Vex fits right in the compartment.
560277,jerry bark,2006-08-13 08:25:00,822,"yep my fisheasy II is great, one pack of batteries will get you by if you don't fish at night a lot. cheers jerry"
560290,thunderatwork,2006-08-14 08:01:00,79,"i have a eagle 500C, dodn't get one unless you carry extra battery packs. it works great, and i like the color definition, however it must be the color that eats batteries, was on the third set on a five day trip."
560292,MoWalleyeguy,2006-08-14 09:49:00,409,"You said the ""best""... well I think its what I have. Lowrance 102c mounted on a pelican 1200 box (can get off ebay fairly cheap) and using a protable transom mount for the transducer you will be in business. I use a basic ""hobby"" battery... its a 12v gel type battery you can get at any hobby store or even Cabelas. I take 2 or 3 depending on how long I will be gone. If I have access to power I just take the 1 battery and recharge overnight. This setup is awesome and its really not hard to do at all. I can switch the 102c from my boat to portable in less then a minute the way I have it hooked up. I made my 3500c Lowrance GPS portable also! Take a look at a picture of it- http://s110.photobucket.com/albums/n...gAnch=imgAnch1"
560424,voyaguer,2006-08-17 23:06:00,54,"Mo looks to have a good solution. I would not go with the video game portables typically sold by the major stores. Get a good sonar or sonar\gps combo and mount on a box like Mo's. I dont think the blue box is practical for flyins, but fine for ice fishing. If you go with Lowarance, look at LEI for a portable box that is custom made for many higher end units. I have the 334i mounted on a LEI box with gimbral brackets sized for it. I use the gel cells like Mo and if have power, can recharge each nite and works fine. The better units do take more power than the video game units like Eagles etc. My experience was I had to do my own research to find what I want. The major retailers were basically clueless on getting something other than the pre-packaged ""portable"" units offered by the major players. good luck"
560425,Skyraptor,2006-08-18 06:33:00,291,"Well voyaguer my so called ""video game portable"" sure caught me a lot of fish and did jsut as well as any other portable out there whether it was from a big box outlet or made with parts. I'll stick with my Eagle 320 thank you!"
