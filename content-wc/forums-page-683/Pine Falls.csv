560336,canuk1100,2006-08-15 12:59:00,43,The walleye classic is on that weekend or the next so the fish may be a little finicky if you have fished there before try your usual spots but look for a building on a point on the right side when you are entering the big bay at the mouth of the lake there is a flat there it is about 15-20ft. pink jig with a live minnow also try the two bays on the left early in the A.M. as you leave the dock in Pine Falls watch your depth stay in the 9ft and pull a spinner rig (minnow) in either yellow or red depends on the day. Also if the fish turn off use a jig and minnow just go down in size and use some split shot above your flourocarbon leader to get the bait to flutter a bit keep your finger on the line and set the hook if you feel anything bump on your finger. Good Luck and I may see you that weekend.

560436,lund115,2006-08-18 10:46:00,698,"We will also be up there in Ocotber from the 17-22. Always a great trip, and every bite could be that 12+. I love the feeling that every bite you have, you always think this is the ONE!!!. If your buddy misses a bite, letting him know that he just missed a 15 lber, because yuo could tell by the bite. Hope for North winds 5-10 mph!!!!!! Last year, we didn't get to the bay 2 out of the 4 days due to waves. First time, We were in the river and took a wave over the bow of the pro-v, and decided the bay wasn't possible, so we went to the Red. Second time we got to the bay, and it was a couple of guys first time there. We were rolling 3 footers out to Robinspon's Rock, and the two new guys were holding the bottom of their seats real tight and looked really scared. We were getting some splash, and catching a few waves, but I wasn't scared. We anchored up in the bay, and the two guys were just scared and didn't enjoy it out there, so we packed it up and went to the Red. What size wave is generally to big out on Traverse Bay do you think?"
560441,cnem,2006-08-18 14:31:00,50,We were fishing the river a few years back and we come around the corner to head through the rapids back to the landing. We knew it was windy and that's why we weren't out on the bay. When we came through the rapids we ran into some 6'ers at least. I think the winds were forcasted at 50+ that day blowing straight out of the NW. We finally made it back to the landing. I was scared shi!less. I had never been in anything like that before. We were soaking from all of the water coming over the bow. My buddy did a great job getting us in. cnem
