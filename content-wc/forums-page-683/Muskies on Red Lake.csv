Recently a couple has managed to net two Muskies (that I know of) on Red Lake waters. The largest caught yesterday, measured at 55"" long. Anyone else catching them?"
560536,sifty,2006-08-22 09:17:00,46,I just asked a question on the gullrock lake topic that I thought that I had caught two smaller muskies on gullrock in july. I was always under the impression that there were no musky's in this lake- quess I was wrong.

On my very first trip over 15 years ago to Red Lake someone in our party of 4 caught a smaller tiger musky or hybrid about 20 inches or so. it had very pronounced stripes and it was definitely not a northern... that's the only one that i've ever seen. over the years we have caught some blue pike, which is somewhat of an oddity. can I ask what part of the lake they were netted?"
560558,Guest,2006-08-22 16:22:00,0,Surrounding lakes have Muskies.....and some of these lakes connect to Red Lake via small creeks/streams. I heard the Muskies were caught around the Forestry Point area. I've seen hybrid northerns before but not in Red Lake. Little V. we caught two of them ice fishing three years ago.
