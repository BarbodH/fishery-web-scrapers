Can anyone tell me what to expect for fishing patterns in mid-September? Depth, structure, etc. This is my third year to LS, the other times I stayed at Lost Island Lodge and Evergreen, but went in July both times. Also, will crawlers work this time of year or would I do better sticking with minnows? Is there anyone familiar with thelocation of this resort tell me if I will be making long runs to find fish? Thanks for sharing. Steve"
560391,Guest,2006-08-16 17:55:00,0,You will find fish pretty much all over. for quantities and quality you will have to make some longer runs.( main lake ) Are you familiar with that area of the lake? I have been at fisherman's Cove and before it was fisherman's cove for 43 years. Fishing is great that time of year although weather is unpredictable. We will be there sept. 19 - 24. E-mail me at [email protected] and we can go over the area.

Generally they are 24ft to deeper. 2 years ago we found alot of sauger, you hit 40ft and you had a sauger on. Just fish where the wind is blowing into or funneling thru a narrows, always produces fish"
