558865,bronzeback77,2006-06-26 21:17:00,97,"I remember last year about this time reading countless messages about Indian netting on LOTWs and how bad it had gotten. Now, I have not been on the site as much this spring as last but I do not believe I have seen any mention of the subject. Did something change? Did they come to some type of agreement with First Nation? I am just wondering if anyone has seen any evidence this year as they have in the past of this being a big problem. Not trying to bring up a sore subject just curious."
558995,Guest,2006-07-01 15:35:00,0,Around the Morson area there is less netting this year due to several of the natives building houses on their reserve. I have seen very few nets and the fishing has been fantastic.
558996,Guest,2006-07-01 15:37:00,0,Still bad as ever! Situation with natives will never go away.
559020,Guest,2006-07-02 21:52:00,0,I heard a few problem netters were busted and there is more enforcement on this matter since the spotlight was turned on this subject last year.A few high profile outdoor media types and a few guides also put more exposure on the subject.
559065,bronzeback77,2006-07-04 11:50:00,97,I hope it is true that some of the biggest culprits were punished and it is good to hear that some of the posts on this site might have made a difference. I am 29 and have been going to the lake since I was 18; I hope that when I retire (35 yrs) that I can have a cabin on the lake and take my grandchildren fishing.
559072,Bill Krejca,2006-07-04 16:36:00,6107,"It is good to hear that the rules are being more closely enforced. I guess I'm not very well informed, though, as I am really not aware of what the rules are. Perhaps if we tourist fishermen understood the rules, we might have a better(or worse?) feel for the situation. Along with the capability to share viewed situations."
559119,Guest,2006-07-06 23:00:00,0,"I TO HAVE TALKED TO SOME IN THE NESTOR FALLS AREA THAT THE INDIANS ARE MAKING MORE MONEY BUILDING AND VERY LITTLE NETTING GOING ON. JUST A COUPLE OF GUYS OUT ON WEEKEND. I PERSONALLY TALKED TO 6 DIFFERENT INDIANS ABOUT THIS. SEEMS THEY ARE GUN SHY ABOUT GOING OUT NETTING VERY MUCH, MAYBE SOME HAVE BEEN BUSTED FOR OVER THIER QUOTA? THEY ARE PLAYING DOWN THEM NETTING MUCH. I HOPE THIS CONTINUES. THE CRAPPIES HAVE BEEN HURT BY THEM NETTING"

I received a very disturbing phone call last evening from Lee Winterton (Guy Winterton's brother) about the extent of First Nation commercial netting on Lake of the Woods, which corroborates what many people (including myself) have been observing and reporting to you repeatedly for well over a year now. I suggested to Lee that he call, and/or meet, with you as soon as possible to fill you in on the details. As Lee reported, one of the principals in the new commercial fish packing plant here in Kenora, advised him that he has been shipping ""40,000 pounds of a fish a week, all winter long, from Lake of the Woods."" Lee also related a first hand account of an Indian commercial fisherman who told him that he was taking all of his ""quotas"" from all the lakes he was ""licensed to fish"" solely from the Lake of the Woods. The commercial fisherman also suggested to Lee that this was now a common practise with many other commercial fishermen. I am sure Lee will relate the specifics when he meets with you. If this is true, the harvest is entirely unsustainable and will severely threaten fish stocks in Lake of the Woods. As you know, the accelerated level of commercial netting on the lake over the past year has been unprecedented and is cause for concern. It now appears to be totally out of control. If it continues, I have no doubt, whatsoever, that we will shortly see very serious responses within the fishery. Indeed, if what Lee is relating is factual, and I have no doubt that it is, given what many of us have witnessed ourselves and reported to you repeatedly, the impact on the walleye and pike populations is unsustainable. And the effect on other species, especially muskellunge, that are being netted, killed and dumped as an unwanted by-catch is disgraceful. If 40,000 pounds of fish a week are being shipped from the new local fish processing plant alone, the implications are unmistakable. It translates into 160,000 pounds of fish a month or over 2 million pounds a year! And that is from only one source. Given the early ice out conditions that now present themselves, if uncontrolled commercial netting continues throughout the upcoming spring spawning period, the impact on the fishery will be particularly harmful. Perhaps irreversible. I would urge you to take immediate and responsible action to reduce and control the harvest to sustainable levels, else risk losing one of the most important fisheries in Ontario. A friend.

559841,Guest,2006-07-29 22:04:00,0,"I think you said it all. the last time we were up there we had to go all the way to little girlfrom sioux narrows to catch fish and then it was slow. an old timer had told me when he first started coming up to lake of the woods he only had to go around the corner literally from the lodge to catch all the fish he wanted, now you have to go 20 miles to catch any fish. dont tell me that netting is not hurting this fishing resource"
560457,Guest,2006-08-19 05:03:00,0,"Netting is only one issue here and why fishing might be off. I read an article about the alge on Lake Winnipeg and how it was suffocating their fish. We have one heck of a bloom here on LOTW. Yet they claim it does not hurt fishing. I once had a high quality underwater camera with a 75ft cord. I dropped this in deep water and could not see a thing under I was right on bottm and even then my distance was only a few feet. No one can tell me, the bloom here is any different than Lake Winnipeg. It IS hurting not only the water qualtiy, but also fishing itself. Why do you think that the Health Dept has made all the resorts/lodges/restaurants who use lake water in their establishments install high priced water treatment facilities."
