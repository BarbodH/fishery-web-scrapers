510885,Guest,2001-02-01 04:12:00,0,I think that Tough Guy might fit your requirements for your worst areas of the world if your post is about recruitment. I think he will insist on wearing a Walleye Central T Shirt though. :-).
510886,Mean Mike,2001-02-01 04:39:00,115,"Nigel, thank god you have arrived!! Your services will be needed as I take my annual trek to the great white north. Last year at O-Pee-Chee Lake a gang calling themselves the Water Wolves stole my red and white daredevel, they are now holding it hostage for ransom and demanding I give them all of my spoons, crankbaits, rods, reels, and all other tackle I own. That spoon has been in my family for generations and is very valuable to me and my family. The leader of their pack, or school, is Gator. He is who I have been negotiating with, be careful he is very slimy and has a sharp toung. I need your help, please call me at 555-PIKE.Mike"
510887,Guest,2001-02-01 05:43:00,0,"Mike, I've had some terrible :-). experiences with Gator as well. An anti terrorist group might just be the ticket. We could start them out at camp doing the cooking and cleaning fish and all. We would not want them to get hurt by gator. They could also guard the coolers of beer and steaks. We could not give them guns though...strictly primitive. Hand to Fin with gator."
510888,Mean Mike,2001-02-01 11:11:00,115,"LOL, hand to fin, that is funny. Your idea sounds good to me, except I will choose the walleye over the steak. We gotta pay Nigel in English LBS., ya know what the exchange rate is??"
510889,Guest,2001-02-01 12:12:00,0,I think its about 10 Pike for one Walleye........oh thats the Canadian fish exchange rate....the English one and judging by Nigels post is probably around 4 walleye for one pike. He sounds a little confused.
