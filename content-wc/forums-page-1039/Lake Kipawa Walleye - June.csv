Went up last year in early August and caught nice numbers of walleye near Corbeau Island and Sunnyside. I was advised this past weekend that the walleye in early June are located only near the spawning areas at the Northern and Southern areas of the lake. We stayed at Corbeau Island last year and did not have to go far for walleye. This source told me that if we stay at Corbeau in June, we'd have to travel great distances to get walleyes as they are no where near Corbeau Island in early June. Is this true? What are the primary locations for walleye the second week of June? Please advise...any insights and knowledge are greatly appreciated. Thanks."

I'm responding because I'm aware through our research that there are two major spawning areas in the north eastern arm of Lake Kipawa - one is called Chemagan bay while the other is called Belisle Bay. I measured on the topographical map and those two bays would be approximately 20 miles from Corbeau Island. We are staying at 3 Season's Camp - about 15 minutes by boat (15 HP) from these spawning areas. The outfitter has advised me that these bays are where most people fish until July. I have no knowledge of where the southern spawning areas are. This information won't make you happy but at least you have one confirmation of the information you have received. Good fishing!Jay"
