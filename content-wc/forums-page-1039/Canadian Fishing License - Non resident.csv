510891,Mal,2001-02-01 12:41:00,55,I am in need of information (whom to phone or email) in order to purchase an Ontario Fishing License for the 2001 year. I make 3 trips to Ontario during the spring to fall season and want to get this taken care of ahead of time. I also have two brothers that fish in Ontario during the year and they would be interested and 3 other fishing buddies that will also be going with me at one time or another. Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated!

510893,Homer,2001-02-01 17:22:00,1127,"I don't believe that U.S. citizens can buy non-resident Ontario licenses on-line through the MNR. Lakeside Tackle near Detroit provides a service where you send them the pertinent information (and money,) and once a week they drive over the border to Canada and purchase licenses. They will then mail you the license if you're unable to come to their store and pick it up. Their web-site is:http://www.lakesidefishingshop.comI believe you can do the whole process on-line with a credit card. Living close enough to the border, I've never had to use this service myself, but I can vouch for Lakeside's reputability in all other manners."

Filling it out is a matter of listing your credit card number, your name and address and chosing what type of license you want. License fees are in Canadian funds and you will automatically get the discount using your credit card. Fred"
