510760,Guest,2001-01-26 20:52:00,0,Its our first time on this lake and was wondering if anyone out there had fished this lake before and if so how was the fishing. Also wondering where i could find a good detailed map of this lake (need all the help we can get). Thanks in advance all your suggestions and fish stories greatly appreciated.
510761,Guest,2001-01-28 09:42:00,0,"Jamie,I haven't fished it, but I considered it last year. I bumped into a guy at Fleet talking about Canada, and I butted into the conversation. He has been going to Packwash for years and had trips planned last summer.His advice was to troll Lindy/Little Joe spinners real slow. He mainly used crawlers. Also, get out of site of the camp. He said a lot fisherman did not. He also cautioned me on rocks which are just below the surface.I am sure the resort where you are staying will want you to catch fish and will mark maps as to where to try and what to use. If it was me, I would contact them now and ask what is the normal hot bite at the time of year you are going. Then contact them again a couple of days before you go and see what is hot.Sorry I don't have more,Good luck"

510763,Guest,2001-01-29 17:34:00,0,"Fished there last June out of Northwoods Bay Resort. The water was very high last year but we got fish. I got and excellant map from Red lake maps sales. I know I found the website but can't now. G. Worral Box 345 Red lake,ON POV 2MO (807)727-3005It's water proof,same as fishing hotspots maps.Most walleye's came in about 8' of water. We also brought home alot of nice perch. My son caught a 42"" northern on Lost lake,(which is at the bottom of Pakwash).I was told by the resort owners later that a 54"" was caught later."
510764,Guest,2001-01-30 09:09:00,0,"Jamie, have fished the lake approximately 20 times. As with any lake, have had excellent fishing, and also tough fishing. As mentioned before, there is alot of structure, and some is near the surface. Some days all you need are jigs with plastic. Other days you might have to use live bait on slip sinkers. If the walleye won't cooperate, the smallmouth alway's seem willing. E-mail me, and let me know where you're staying, and time of year you're going, and I'd be happy to give you directions to all the sunken islands I have found. Good fishing canaloon"
