510881,Guest,2001-02-01 06:53:00,0,We are going to Trout Lake Camp arriving on 6/24/01. Really looking forward to it.
510882,Guest,2001-02-01 10:28:00,0,I was up there thefirst 2 weeks in June of 93 not at trout lake we camped about 6 mi. west of there. We were a little early for pike but the lakers were shallow. We walked in to a small lake some locals told us about and we were catching 100's of walleye a day between 2 and 5 lbs.There was a boat there with Trout Lake on it so I know they know about it. I'd say 3 of us caught well over 1000 walleyes in 4 days out of that lake! My dad has the maps if you'd like I could give you more dettailed instruchens on where it is let me know.
