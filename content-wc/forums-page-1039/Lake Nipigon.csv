We have caught Specks yearly to 8# out of there. It is a huge cold lake with very little usage. It is not a lake to learn on. The weather and conditions can be very brutal. There are a number of guiding services out of Poplar Point. Fishinitus charters is very good for lakers. Trout over 40# every year. Lyle is a great guy. There are also charters that run out of commercial fishing boats. They run up the lake,you fish out of small boats and then stay in the large tug. I have a very healthy respect for that lake. It is beautiful in the wilderness way. However you learn very quickly that if you have problems and the weather is bad, help is a long ways away and you are in a world of hurt. There are severe restrictions on trophy fish and everything is barbless. No strigers or livewells. If you catch it you keep it or let it go. There are a lot of regs. Frank"
