510720,Guest,2001-01-29 04:50:00,0,"MarkThanks for the feedback on Sask. however my goal is to fish Ontario due to the cost effectiveness that it provides. Just as a side note, I know of places that rival Sask for pike and walleye fishing (not lakers) in Ontario but wanted to solicit the experts on this board for their knowledge nontheless. So again I will ask, what is the northern most facility that I can get to flying out of Red Lake?"
510721,Guest,2001-01-30 19:30:00,0,"Jay, I have been with an outfit out of Pickle Lake a couple times that flies quite far north 150 miles+. He puts together camps and books for various groups of northern ontario natives. Every year or two he opens a new camp on ""new"" waters. Of course these waters have seen trappers and have been used by the locals but for the most part they are virgin waters. Anyhow, I have been twice (including last year) to two differant camps and all I can say is that it was outstanding - in every way (unless you can't cook your own meals - SOL). Most of the lengthy flights require a group of 6 or atleast pay for 6. This is the reason I did not book again this year; It's difficult for me to get 6 guys. He does offer some great trips for 4 guys. I thought I would try this Waynorth camp I have been hearing about.Email me if you want his info. He runs a top notch outfit but I am not into advertising or slamming on the board. lobo"
