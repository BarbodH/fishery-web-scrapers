It's just south of Lake Seul and Perralt Falls, but north of Eagle Lake.Has anybody fished this lake? I've heard there's some good walleyes here. Is this true? Are there any muskys or lake trout?Any info would be appreciated."

510811,Tom/MN,2001-01-31 15:50:00,35,I've fished Cedar for about 7 or 8 days. IMO there are a lot better waters in that area for just about everything but smallmouth. If you're looking for walleyes I'd do Lac Seul or Gull Rock. Only 45 minutes to an hour further up Red Lake Road.
