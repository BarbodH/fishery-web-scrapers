510834,Guest,2001-01-31 10:58:00,0,Wondering if anyone has fished this lake and if so how was your luck. It is a big lake that seems full of fish. Went there last June and ran into some horse ---- weather. Fishing was average. Any personal experiences would be greatly appreciated. We stayed at Fin And Feather resort.
