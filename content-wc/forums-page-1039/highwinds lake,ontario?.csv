I was there only once, just for a visit (had relatives staying there). The lake is a classic oligotrophic lake, extremely clear & deep, but very beautiful. This is a lake trout lake with some pike fishing thrown in. The camp itself seemed very rustic with few conveniences. Check the post about Dogtooth Lake for info on this lake."
