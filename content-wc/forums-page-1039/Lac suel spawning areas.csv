I am going to try to catch some of the late mid lake spawners(weather permitting). Thanks for any suggestions."

Broad lake and Sunlight lake also are good areas. Your best bet is to find out when you get there as to when the spawn was and where the fish are being caught (expecially what depth). Knowing where and how deep will eliminate a bunch of areas. Sure you can get many ""hot spots"" from those who have a good knowledge of the lake, but in January we are just speculating as to where the fish are going to be. Fishing reports in May are going to be more precise. Last years ""hot spots"" could be a bust this year due to changing water levels and weather conditions. Good luck....."

I realize that things can change significantly year to year, but this is such a big body of water I am still getting my bearings."
