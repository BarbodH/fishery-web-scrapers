510926,Guest,2001-02-03 09:41:00,0,I am interested in talking to anyone who has been to Browns Clearwater West lodge on clearwater west lake north of Atikokan Ont. We have had fantastic luck with large walleyes & lake trout (White Otter Lake). There are many other lakes (boats cached) to fish. The hosts are great & helpful (Barry & Carol). We have been fishing there for fifteen years & have a great time every trip.
