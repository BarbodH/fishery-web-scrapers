510788,Guest,2001-01-28 22:16:00,0,I do most of my fishing in Parc De Lavendrye and anywhere up there that you want to drop a line is usually pretty good. Cabonga Reservoir is good and I've heard that Whiskey Lake is real good but I've never tried that one myself.

510790,Guest,2001-02-01 08:37:00,0,the cabonga reservoir is classed as one of the best walleye holes in quebec. the La Verendrye Park is a nice wildlife reserve that can offer superbe surprises for walleye and northern pike. For more info e-mail me.
