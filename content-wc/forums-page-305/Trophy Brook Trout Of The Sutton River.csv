In a word it was ""speck""tacular.Literally hundreds of trophy class fish were caught, some swinging streamers but most were caught skating mouse patterns across the surface. Can't even begin to describe how awesome it was!The full story will be published early in 2015 in Ontario Out Of Doors magazine. Until then here's a link to a short teaser with a pretty cool video clip and a bunch of photos.Cheershttp://www.canadafishingguide.net/re...tton-a-teaser/"

3154721,vteye,2014-09-05 13:16:00,812,HI MIke - yep that is definitely a teaser report. Weigh any of the brookieslook like 4-6 pounds? Great photography (no trip this year) needed a Canada fix..
3154817,Mike Borger,2014-09-05 14:06:00,1554,"Thanks! Didn't weigh any, but we had lots over 5lb's no doubt about that. Don't think we broke 6, but I'm not complaining."
