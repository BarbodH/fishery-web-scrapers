3132985,Tayzak15,2014-08-28 22:44:00,48,"I live in the area and fish it multiple times per year there is no cell service at all on the lake. Maybe right at horwood lake lodge as I have never gone all the way up there, but there is no coverage at all on the lake. Fishing is generally pretty good there."
