2418321,WanderNFish,2014-02-04 10:56:00,7,"You are right Pete, Pasha Lake itself is not the best fishing lake. That said, there are 30+ other lakes in the area with fantastic fishing. They have boats cached on many of them or you can trailer one of their boats. The fishing in this area is second to none! They have numbers as well as trophy fish. Our biggest walleye so far is a little over 31"" and our largest northern 42 1/2""."

3128969,revitup,2014-08-27 15:55:00,140,Does Bush Lake Resorts have boats for Onaman?
3129161,biotroller,2014-08-27 17:37:00,437,"If you go to Endys Bush lake or Pasha, be prepared to drive, a lot! I've been to Endys Bush lake & wouldn't return. I met some guys at the launch on Northwind, they were staying out of Pasha, about 45 minute ride to the lake, they had their gas can & all of their gear, ready to fish but, no key to unlock the boats that were cached! Another 90 minutes worth of driving & they were ready to launch. Even though I was staying at Endys Bush lake, Chad at Pasha was willing & able to help us out with maps & directions. He seemed like he ran a great operation, I can't say that about Endys Bush lake..... They drove almost 3 hours that day alone! I obviously don't care for driving aspect, some guys like it, to each their own."
3131497,dan lollar,2014-08-28 15:27:00,10,"Bush does not have boats on Onaman, it is a long hard road from what I hear, with about a mile hike into the lake, so I never tried it with my wife and daughters. Usually fish Northwind and Paint chain. I don't know when the last fellow stayed at Bush and don't want any disagreements with anyone, but I found Bush more to my liking and Terry more helpful. Any one with questions about either can E-mail me at [email protected] for a more detailed viewpoint. Dan"
3137537,Skiball,2014-08-30 17:19:00,82,"This was from ma person who went there and is posted on the site where the map is: Just wanting to warn anybody get ready to book a trip here. The owner, Chad, is not honest when dealing with customers. I had booked a guide trip with him to Lake Nipigon 6 months before heading there last week. He told me the night before that he had to cancel because Babe Winkelman was coming in for the week. The next morning I saw him leaving with another group to go fishing. He really doesn't seem to care about people. Seventeen hours of driving one way and my first trip to Canada with my 14 year old daughter. Our water heater for the shower was broke and we had to take cold showers all week. The area is beautiful...just find a different resort."

3143185,dan lollar,2014-09-02 08:56:00,10,"Skiball Can't disagree with your post. When up there this last June, for the second year in a row, every group at Bush said they used to go to Pasha, some for many years, all tell similar stories to mine. Bush gets most of their business from people like me, who used to go to the other camp. Check out Bush, you won't be disappointed in the facilities or the cost. I saved over $500.00 for my week trip. The cabins are second to none, clean, good cookware, drinkable water, etc. Also wife approved. Terry is easy going and fun to be around and will try to help you. Look forward to the next time up."
2336002,Walleye_Guru,2014-01-09 10:49:00,62,"Dcravan - Thanks for checking us out. I'd love to chat with you about the services we offer. Looks like most of the posts are fairly accurate. I just talked to Babe Winkelman's staff and it looks like the 2013 brook trout show will be airing soon, followed by a 2nd show where they stayed in one of our outfitter tents on Lake Nipigon. I haven't seen the shows yet, but have been told they are awesome. What dates are you thinking about coming up? July, depending on species, by far is my favorite time! Great weather and even better fishing. Can't beat it. Thanks Chad"
2340106,123chadder,2014-01-10 15:36:00,429,the $550 includes all cached boats on all the lakes
2340298,revitup,2014-01-10 16:37:00,140,so they have boats already on all of those inland walleye lakes? After your comment I looked at their website and still couldn't tell. That walleye dream trip does sound fun. And I know Onaman is fabulous. Does $550 include going to Onaman as many times as you want?
2344962,WanderNFish,2014-01-12 19:48:00,7,I have been to Pasha several times in the past few years. The accommodations and fishing is second to none! They have boats one many of the lakes otherwise they have boats that you can trailer to the lakes that don't have them.
2345346,revitup,2014-01-13 05:17:00,140,"Back when I was fishing this area (until about 2003) you had to rent the Onaman boats (extra fee)each time you used them. Is it different now at Pasha Lake cabins? How many boats does he have on Onaman? Can you go there more than once? Do you put in your request for boats on each lake well ahead of time so there is not confusion between groups as to who has rights to the boats? Sounds like it would be alot of fun to go back with all those options and using their boats, trailers. Those roads made me a little uneasy trailering my own boat each day."
2346042,WanderNFish,2014-01-13 10:02:00,7,"I was up there several times last year and am planning on taking my RV up there this year and stay a couple of months. Onaman has probably the best walleye fishing I have ever seen but it is hard to beat the fishing on Northwind as well. June is probably the busiest time however. There are 4-5 boats on Onaman. I have never had a problem getting a boat a couple times a week. You just need to let them know what day(s) you want to reserve a boat when you check in. As far as I know, there is no extra charge when you book the package that includes everything... cabin, boat, motor... The roads can be rough, especially if they aren't maintained by the loggers. Chad usually keeps us up to date on hot lakes and hazards we may encounter along the way. I'm getting excited to get back up there and can't wait for the winter to be done! Headed out locally tomorrow, I hear the bite is picking up in northern WI"
2346978,Pikeslayer8,2014-01-13 14:42:00,1460,Talk about livin the dream! Majorly jealous.
2351594,Northerneyehunter,2014-01-14 17:01:00,15,I am 5.5 hours from pasha lakes...if its out near Geraldton...between thunder bay and Cochrane. Nippigon has some of the best brooke trout fishing as well. sure is some great untouched lakes. Northern Ontario walleye trail has a good eye tournament in that area as well.
2374801,123chadder,2014-01-22 17:40:00,429,"all cached boats are included for the $550,unlimited bait as well i believe"
2418169,bpetersen,2014-02-04 09:56:00,251,Unless Pasha has changed when I was there several years ago mainly for bear hunting. The lake itself was a very poor fishery. Maybe a lake trout and white fish could be caught but that was it. We had to trailer our boats to do walleye and northern fishing.
2322281,dcraven,2014-01-05 09:35:00,47,Anyone heard of anything from Pasha Lake Cabins recently? I can't get their website to come up and the most recent Facebook entries I see are from October... D. Craven
2322681,stjoeguy,2014-01-05 11:13:00,979,Try the website again. It worked for me.http://www.pashalake.com
2323137,dcraven,2014-01-05 13:50:00,47,"Yup - worked for me too, now. Thanks"
2323297,123chadder,2014-01-05 14:45:00,429,would love to go there one of these days
2323737,MrSimon,2014-01-05 16:59:00,922,There are lots of videos on YouTube of Pasha Lake Cabins .... quite a few fishing shoes have been filmed up there. Seems like a great place.
2325666,MikeMcC,2014-01-06 09:01:00,72,Research diligently
2326058,tooski,2014-01-06 10:21:00,393,Exactly Mike... Recommendations from fishing shows would be 6th on my list of the top 5 reasons to visit a camp...
2326170,123chadder,2014-01-06 10:49:00,429,"i did tons of research for a trip and it seemed to be the best bet for amazing fishing....you cant beat $550 for 7 days with a rented boat and motor,bait,accomodations for the week,access to all cached boats on inland lakes and free first tank of gas..... really doesnt get better than that,i just got a good deal on a fly in...but i will be going to pasha in the next 3 years 100%....its the 22 hour drive that made my descision. plus,they offer tent camping for cheap,and prospector tent camping on crown land....these prospector tents are big and id love to try them"
2327034,dcraven,2014-01-06 13:53:00,47,"Right up the road is Onaman River Resort. I've stayed there before and am going there again this summer in July. I just couldn't get on Pasha's website for about an hour and was curious as, at least on that day, the latest Facebook entry was from October. Something must have been up with my server. That whole area has fabulous fishing. It sounds like Pasha LC would be a good place too... Onaman RR is something like $44 per day and $305 per person for a week. I went in 2008 and it was only $28 per day! We saw wolves, moose and woodland caribou and caught fish like there was no tomorrow. Very pleased. DC"
2327778,revitup,2014-01-06 16:59:00,140,If you are fishing for walleye the included boat motor package will do you no good as there really are not any walleye to speak of on the chain of lakes pasha is on. We went to that area several years and had to take our own boats and trailer into different lakes each day. Onamon Lake is fabulous but that is a walk in lake and rent the boats that are there.
