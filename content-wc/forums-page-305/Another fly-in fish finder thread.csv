3119129,forgop,2014-08-24 13:30:00,880,"Saw a thread from last fall but looking maybe for more info. I've fished the past 2 trips with the aid of the Humminbird 571 DI PT. I like it because it's a workhorse as far as the battery is concerned. It literally can go almost the entire week without needing recharged. I go on lakes where we have access to a solar charging/generator system is available, so I'm not interested in anything that takes AA or D batteries. The 571 DI does a good job marking structure but I'm not convinced it does a great job marking fish. It doesn't show fish very often even in waters we're catching several. Looks like I'll need to pick up my own since I won't be going on trip in 2015 with the guy who provided it the last 2 years. Would like to stay at under $400 (not above buying used/discontinued) I have looked a bit into the Garmin Echo 550c and seems like it can be converted to a nice portable. I read one review that stated it's a battery hog, but not sure what exactly that means. GPS would be nice but not absolutely needed. I've looked a little at the Humminbird 385CI a bit too. What models would be at the top of your list without getting outrageous on price? TIA"

I ended up a few years ago getting a Humminbird 595c. THey don't make it anymore but it has a color screen and GPS.Batteries. It's hard on batteried because of the GPS I think. So, I bought a flexible solar panel. Power Film I believe. It is lightweight and I can roll it up. I basically created a dual pigtail coming off the battery. One of the pigtails I connect to the fish finder and the other to the solar panel. The battery is charging in the boat while we are fishing. One battery then works all day. Best of both worlds. Lightweight (heaviest part is the gel cell battery) and I have a color monitor and GPS. All my waypoints are stored for the following year. There are a few things I don't mind spending the money on because we use them for many many years before replacing. One is rain gear and another is the electronics. We are on Lac Seul now and I wouldn't do that place without a GPS. Even the simplicity of marking areas that are shallow as we go through. Rocks on a couple sides but I will mark the channel with way points as we navigate. Comfort level coming back and forth each time is big. Good luck. If you have solar power/generator at the cabin I would go with whatever you can get in your budget. You will be find battery wise."
3119905,forgop,2014-08-24 22:22:00,880,Just came across what appears to be a great deal on a 398ci Si for less than $275. Regular price is $450+. May just have to score that with the portable case for another $100.
3119985,octanehi5,2014-08-25 04:57:00,1104,"You do not need to spend a whole lot of money. Making a portable is very easy. I use an old 300 cuda,suction cup transducer,small fishing box with a 5lb acid battery, Mount the screen holder to the top of the box. Alot of guys do not set the angle of the transducer correctly, it takes a little adjusting,Once its adjusted properly you can see your jig on the screen.If you have fished the lake before you should have a few go to spots and use the fishfinder for depth mostly."
3126817,forgop,2014-08-26 18:56:00,880,Bummed. Found out there's not a portable transducer with SI capability from what Humminbird told me. Wish there was an easy way to really figure out what the difference is between all of the Lowrance Elite 5's.
3127737,SinOrSwim,2014-08-27 06:11:00,1528,I don't think it matters one way or another. Just get a transducer bracket. This is what we use to avoid the suction cup. You should be able to make ANY fish finder you want into a portable. I never had a suction cup come off but I also had to put it at a depth that didn't work if we were moving very fast because I couldn't get it deep enough on the hull. This way I can get it down there. Set it and forget it. http://www.cabelas.com/product/Porta...h-All+Products
3148593,forgop,2014-09-03 16:57:00,880,Received the 398ci SI today and got it mounted in the portable setup and battery already charged. I have the transducer bracket on order with cabelas.
