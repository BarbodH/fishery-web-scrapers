3151297,Guest,2014-09-04 10:51:00,0,I use to go up to Ear Falls with my father. Golden was then the premier Lodge in the area. It's to bad it has fallen on bad times. They use to have fly in planes for hunting and fishing.
3151409,btmbncr,2014-09-04 11:16:00,492,"I drove in and checked it out in August.There were two native families staying in two of the cabins.They told me it was now""a private bush camp"".Bill"
3152881,lunker99,2014-09-04 18:57:00,236,We were told when we were up there this year that a lumber company had bought it for an outpost camp for workers and storing equipment. Shame as that is too nice of a location to not be a fishing camp. Have a lot of good memories from that place before it went downhill.
3156777,flntknp17,2014-09-06 10:41:00,151,There's a sick boulder about 30 yards off the Golden Fawn dock I fish every year......'eyes stack in behind it. The lumber company story is true. Sad because its such an amazing location. I heard the cost to bring it up to code would be large since it sat derelict for a while and basically rotted. A guy I know looked into buying it but it appeared the balance sheet wasn't going to have much chance of working out. Matt
1387803,WOLF123,2012-01-30 17:15:00,30,"I plan on possibly fishing golden fawn lodge on lac out of ear falls the last week in may has anyone stayed at the camp and what type of experience did you have cabins decent, motors in good running shape etc. their price for housekeeping seems extremely reasonable jim wolf chicago illinois"
1387942,teddi,2012-01-31 04:24:00,349,poor cabins and poorer boats. i would stay any where else but there.
1387947,Guest,2012-01-31 05:04:00,0,Thought you were heading to Goose Bay Camp?
1387948,teddi,2012-01-31 05:07:00,349,goose bay is a much better choice. you get what you pay for.
1387958,WOLF123,2012-01-31 06:02:00,30,the price was approximately $150 cheaper/week but my buddies over road me stating that since we already paid $50 deposit we should with goose bay we plan on visiting golden fawn one evening to check out for a future trip they like the 40 hp w/electric starter and 17' rather 16' they are probably right vs. standard 25hp I didn't like the fact that goose bay charges and extra $55 for fishing on saturday we plan to arrive and start fishing around 11 am we have never been charged for sat. in past jim wolf chicago boys your thoughts or comments are always appreciated
1387997,lcwhit,2012-01-31 07:56:00,104,"dont believe shes charging you extra for saturday, but discounting her normal daily rate. agree with teddi. you almost always get what you pay for. they are not getting rich up there and i consider these canada vacations some of the cheapest around."
1388292,lunker99,2012-01-31 19:28:00,236,"Stayed there for several years. When Al ran the camp, wasn't fancy but everything worked and was one of the most reasonably priced camps which suited us just fine. Once Al passed and Barb made the decision she kinda wanted to sell the camp, not much money was put back in and things went downhill fairly quickly. We are now across the bay at Gold Pines. Pete and Bill run a nice camp."
1389886,Guest,2012-02-04 18:57:00,0,I agree on Gold Pines. Been there for 12 yrs. Bill and Pete go out of there way to run a good camp and very fair prices.
1390583,WOLF123,2012-02-06 14:22:00,30,thanks for all the help we have decided to stay with goose bay lodge jim wolf chicago boys
1390587,wallydave,2012-02-06 14:28:00,2151,"Wolf, good call, Andrea will take care of you, and the upgrade boats are a must for safe and smooth fishing! The Lund outfitters ride well when it gets bumpy, and are great to spend a day on the water on! Have a good trip and let us know it your trip went!"
