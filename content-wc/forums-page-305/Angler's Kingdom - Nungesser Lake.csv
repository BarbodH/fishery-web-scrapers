3145329,eyeman_1,2014-09-02 18:13:00,690,"TJAndy, Yes, I was looking at their website and it states that the boats are equipped with trolling motors, so I assumed bow mounts? I'm just hoping the cabins are clean, tidy, and no mice. That would be a deal breaker for my wife. She's a trooper so I want to make it enjoyable for her too. Any suggestions on what to bring to camp? Should we consider a fan at least if it looks like a warm week? how bad were the bugs, by Canadian standards? We always bring the bug candles, spray etc... Is there an ice machine in camp? Where would you suggest for picking up bait on the way in? How about place to spend the night if coming up from IL? We usually stay in Int. Falls but we only had an hour & 1/2 drive from the border to the boat pick up. In this case we would have about 5.5hrs. Thanks for all your advice."
3145601,Golden Eagle,2014-09-02 19:08:00,2642,"Two other couples, my wife and I spent a very enjoyable week at Angler's Kingdom and we were treated as royalty. Fishing was good, cabins were fine and boats were as good as I've ever had. The week went smooth for us. However there were a few, uncontrollable incidents that we took in stride, but from reading your posts I'm thinking they might become deal breakers for you on your trip. In my 55 years of fishing in Ontario I've discovered that fishermen are the most important part of making a successful fishing trip. Look for the good and you'll find it. I've fished NW Ontario 2-7 weeks every year beginning in 1959 and have not run across a camp that could keep me from having a good fishing experience. I'm the most important ingredient in putting together a good trip for my crew."
3151721,Guest,2014-09-04 12:49:00,0,Are you sure about the drive from INT Falls to the boat pick up? It's no way 1.5 hours. You need to check on that.
3151849,btyreprich,2014-09-04 13:37:00,1067,"Must be a typo - 1.5 hours from the border? No way.Unless you have a very, very fast car!!!"
3152745,eyeman_1,2014-09-04 17:56:00,690,I meant 5.5hr. Thanks.
3159913,tjandy,2014-09-08 07:17:00,107,"We take up crawlers in bedding, about 1 per person for the week. We vertical jig or drag crawler harnesses. Typically in August, we do not need a fan, if you are concerned, I would see if they have one you can borrow. We either spend the night in International Falls or Dryden. I have yet to be in a camp that didn't have a mouse, I would think that would work really hard to make sure a cabin is free of them for you if you stated you needed that ahead of time. We don't go to 5 star locations, we go for the best fishing. We had some biting flies for the first time in several years and we only had them a couple days when it was in the 80's. The Boats do not actually have the trolling motors mounted, I think you need to ask for it, I've never used one up there."
3161705,eyeman_1,2014-09-08 18:19:00,690,"Thinking of staying in Dryden. That would give us about 13hrs driving the Friday before. I think the wife will be fine with the lodge. I'm looking forward to trying the pike fishing. Eyes should be fairly easy to figure out. Any suggestions on what items we should bring as far as gear, Therma Cell, Pike baits? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks again."
3161713,BreezyPoint,2014-09-08 18:21:00,1581,"If you want to do northerns, bring some silver Doctor Spoons. In 50 years of Canada fishing, I have never seen a better pike bait.Frank"
3161729,tjandy,2014-09-08 18:34:00,107,"I use a 6'-6"" lite power with a 1000 reel for jigging and I low profile bait caster with a 6'-6"" medium rod for crawler harnesses. I have caught most of my pike up there reeling in walleye. If I was to target them, I would throw a medium diving crank bait in 10-18 foot of water."
3161993,5richards,2014-09-08 19:51:00,131,Kevin is big on dead baits with a slip bobber -- and they work -- Also large stick baits like the Suick -- he has several articles -- at least he used to -- on his web site --

3082585,papsage,2014-08-12 13:52:00,7,"We are flying from Cleveland to Winnipeg Friday AM then staying at Kenora Friday night. We will be arriving at Nungesser pick up point this Saturday @ 12:00. We will be staying at Angler's Kingdom for 2 weeks! We have been fishing Canada in the Kapuskasing/Gowanda vicinity and Lake Erie for more than 50 years-this year, from what I have gathered from Walleye Central's member comments about Nungesser Lake on this lake I can hardly wait! If you or any other member of Walleye Central will be up at Angler's Kingdom during this time, let's get together! My name is Paul and I will be fishing with my my wife Donna-my best catch! Looking forward to sharing this trip!"
3082833,tjandy,2014-08-12 15:43:00,107,Yes those are marine radio antennas. You will not be disappointed on nungesser. It's a great fishery.

3137017,eyeman_1,2014-08-30 12:33:00,690,"So, my wife has agreed to go up with me next year to this resort. She's not a girly girl so I just need to know if the cabins are clean and comfy an the indoor facilities are decent. Also, how is the food? The website says there are bow mounts on the boats? Some photos of the boats on site, I don't see any bow mounts? I like to troll bouncers and spinner so was hoping for bow mounts? Any suggestion on baits to bring up, additional items to bring that are not supplied, things that we should have at the cabin? Areas to look for big pike or big eyes? We've been going to LOTW for a number of years so this is a lot longer drive, suggestions on where to stay overnight on our way up? We'll be coming up from IL the Friday before. We usually stay the night before in Int. Falls, but with the added drive was planning on crossing the border, but uncertain where to stay? Dryden, Red Lake? Also, any suggestion on where to pick up crawlers and leeches before going into camp? I'd love to hear from folks that have been there. Feel free to PM me if you'd like. Thanks all."
3143305,tjandy,2014-09-02 09:39:00,107,"Cabins are nice, stoves, fridges and hot and cold water. There are always women in camp. Are you looking for bow mounted trolling motors? I use the tiller for trolling, works great. Kevin or one of his crew will show you their spots. There are Walleye around every corner in that lake. I haven't had the food, but everyone tells me its good."
2874433,Guest,2014-06-07 06:11:00,0,This was the thread I have been looking for. Plan on booking a trip to the Kingdom for next year after reading the positive reviews posted here. Going to do the American plan for the first time as well. Many thanks to all who have posted here.
2874569,Carnhzkr,2014-06-07 07:55:00,964,Please post a report when you return. I'm keeping an eye on AK on Nungessor.
2884009,shagookin,2014-06-10 10:06:00,5,"I have been to AK twice, once with a group of buddies and once with my older father and my son. The lake is awesome, just be careful of marked reefs and rocks. My buddy took off a prop. The boats were great, and we had a problem with one, and Great fishing... and get Kevin as a guide, he will put you on fish! We did our own cooking, so can't address the lodges meals. The only negative would be that when I took my dad and son, Kevin had overbooked and we were staying with kevin.. not what we had been promised. He moved some things around and accommodated us, but a headache I really didn't want when I was with my family. The cabins are straight forward, nice and tight.. no bugs and the trip in was easy. I want to go back to Nunguesser again sometime! if you go, go all the way to the inlet, where the river comes in and fish the pool, right after the rapids.... we killed them there!"
2913993,tjandy,2014-06-19 09:25:00,107,Has anyone been up there yet this year? We will be up there in August.

3081761,tjandy,2014-08-12 09:47:00,107,"Still up here and it hasn't disappointed at all. If you want to catch 70 - 100 walleye a day you can. Then you can also target the monsters. Caught this, this morning. My biggest. 29"". Super fat. http://img.tapatalk.com/d/14/08/12/ga2y4yhe.jpg"
3081849,Bakefish,2014-08-12 10:15:00,1077,Is that an antenna? What for?

2000521,packpro,2013-08-02 08:41:00,695,"I've been there twice. Very nice camp and great support staff. Kevin Geary owns it. He used to film fishing shows in the past. With that experience he knows what makes a good camp. Great boats, 50HP motors and locators on board. Camp has older cabins and new cabins. I have stayed in both and they are comfortable. Kevin did a great job of determining what we were fishing for, and gave us a marked map. Almost every spot produced. We had trouble finding a deep water hump, that was our issue. Lots of water to fish, never had an issue with other boats on a spot. Full sand beach on the island where the cabins are located. Other sand beaches and picnic tables on shore lunch spots. We had action days with eater size walleye, and we had a few 24""-28"" thrown in on some of the spots. Good food as well. The kitchen was small, but they were adding on when we left. It is huge now. It is also a Trophy Pike lake. We saw Kevin land a 48"" monster while fishing near his boat. One bonus is that it is pretty far north so you can fish late as the sun goes down in June around 10:30. Their is a great reef right in front of the camp. Nice to hit on the way back in. Produced eaters for us all week. Caribou came into camp one night, that was pretty cool. One concern was that it was all salted minnows. They are OK, but a bit of pain when thawed. On our second trip, Kevin arranged to have 144 dozen minnows for us in a large cage at the end of dock. They are available, but you'll have to make arrangements."
2000585,camp chef,2013-08-02 09:08:00,915,Fished there in the fall of 2007. We loved it and hope to go back some day. It is quite an experience.
2004905,eyeman_1,2013-08-04 13:28:00,690,"Thanks all who have replied. I'm looking at this for both pike and eyes and want to hear good and bad. How was the overall experience, did you run into many other boats from other camps? How was the food, what did you need to remember to bring or what wasn't provided that you'd bring next time? I typically fish spinners anc crawlers or leeches in the summer and don't mess iwth minnows so not too concerned about the minnow availability. How was the pike fishing? Looking for the week of the 4th of July. Would love to get onto a good / large pike bite. Is it a casting weedy bays, outside weeds, or rock bite. Is trolling for bigger pike effective up there? Did the cabins have their own bathrooms? How about bugs? Is there any kind of lodge or place to hang out on those stormy days? How is the dining room and what types of meals can you expect? I've been tot he site and corresponded with Kevin a few times. Just looking for feedback on lake and lodge. Thanks again."
2007385,tjandy,2013-08-05 13:18:00,107,"I have stayed at Anglers Kingdom three times and have stayed previously at another lodge 5 or 6 times. The lake is a great Walleye and Pike lake. 50"" pike and 30"" Walleyes caught every year. I do mostly Walleye fishing and go in August. In fact we leave Thursday morning. Mostly a spinner rig or jigging and use nothing but crawlers and catch a ton of fish every day, all day long. I get some nice Pike while Walleye fishing, either on the spinner rig or they eat my Walleye. Kevin is a huge Pike fishermen. He can put you on some monsters. You will see a few boats every once in a while, but not many at all. I think there is a total of 3 lodges on this 11 or 17 (can't remember) mile long lake. I have never had a bug problem on Nungesser either. We do all our own cooking, but I have heard the meals are great and I am not sure if he got his community cabin done yet either. We usually hang out at our own cabin and play Euchre. The cabins do have their own bathrooms with running water and the cabins are very nice. 17- 18 foot Lund boats with either 40 or 50 horse four stroke honda tillers, real nice rigs for up there. Hope that helps"
2007425,Golden Eagle,2013-08-05 13:26:00,2642,"eyeman_1, I think your main problem, due to the excitement trip, is that you might peak too soon. Save a little for your week of fishing.Enjoy your trip and good luck."

2010161,Ralfeee,2013-08-06 11:31:00,33,"I have not stayed at Angler's Kingdom, but I have been to the lake multiple times and I am heading up again next year. I can't speak for the experience at AK, but you will not be disappointed in the lake. As far as seeing other boats, the lake is very large with a lot of great fishing and you rarely come across an area where there are multiple boats. This only usually happens when it is really windy and people are seeking shelter from the large wave that can develop."
2026642,eyeman_1,2013-08-13 19:43:00,690,"Okay I've talked to my father about going up and he's very interested! He's 71 and a diabetic but in pretty good condition otherwise. He watches his diet so that shouldn't be an issue for him. Are there any other physically demanding items accessing this resort we need to be aware of? What other questions am I missing to ask? Anyone have any more pro's or con's about this resort? Any more little things that didn't go right or went wrong, or were really good? How large is the dinning room? How are the cabins and restrooms. Anyplace to to spend a day if there is bad weather? If the weather is windy, are there areas nearby to fish out of the weather? I've been told that lake can get rough? Just looking to make the best decision possible and see what others have experienced. Thanks again."
