2531970,fergiefish,2014-03-08 10:28:00,197,"We have been going to Canada for 35 years and the last 12 to Lac Seul. Shore lunch is an integral part of our experience, but we keep it simple. A Coleman stove , a small shore lunch box, a 12"" fry pan with a small bottle of oil along with snacks such as fruit or vegetables, yogurt or Jello, and our favorite mixture of breading with a couple of eggs for dipping the fish is all we typically take. Just add the fish and tarter sauce. Sometimes we will take bread to make fish sandwiches. Other times we will have a taco seasoning breading along with lettuce and taco shells, salsa, a little shredded lettuce and cheese, and you have a great change of pace with fish tacos. Our crew restocks the shore lunch box each night, and the rest goes into the cooler in the morning and we are set. We can typically get set up, clean fish, cook, and clean up in less than an hour if we want. Everyone has a job and pitches in so it goes fast. Nothing better than to take a quick break and look at the scenery and eat some of the finest table fare on this planet. Will be up to Lac Seul first week of July. Can't wait after this winter we have experienced. Ice should be off by then."
2531994,packpro,2014-03-08 10:51:00,695,"This is what we have done in the past. It has been refined over 17 years to make it more efficient. The lunch consists of fish, packaged beer batter, potatoes, peppers, bacon, onions. Some guys bring tarter sauce.We figure 3 fillets per man, and try to have them cleaned and ready to go. If we are at our limit we take them right our of the freezer and they thaw before lunch. You just have to keep a good count to make sure you are within procession and limit regulations. Our camp provides a shore lunch box with all the utensils, plates, pots, pans, paper towels,oil etc. All of that is in a plastic tote. We have a large group so we bring a camp stove, and the camp provides a propane tank. We deep fry them to speed the process up. All the stuff, stove, propane, and shore lunch box ( this is the stuff that clutters the boat-PITA.) gets dropped off at the designated location. We keep the fish and the beverages in the boat in the cooler. No need to invite the local wildlife to the party. Our camp has 4-5 places that provide good boat access and great scenery. The seating is the bow of the boat or an old log. If not those locations we try to scout out potential spots during the previous days fishing. We agree on the spot the night before and make sure it is near the fishing for that day and convenient for all. The two burner propane stove saves time. We learned that trick from the guide. Potatoes are cooked in the bacon grease, with peppers onion, and the bacon. The batter is easy one can of beer (terrible sacrifice to one package of the batter mix. One dip and into the oil. Potatoes cook next to the fish. There is enough space between the two burners to get the beans hot right in there own can. From landing to final clean up about 1.5 hours. Could be faster but we enjoy it. We bring a few other things to make it easy and just throw them in the box. Fire glove- the pans get hot. Also, an oil thermometer. I am sure we a cheating without the wood fire, but this is efficient/fast without the wind and smoke disrupting the process."
2532530,btyreprich,2014-03-08 14:45:00,1067,"Pretty sure you'll get a ticket if the game warden or police catch you on the lake with a can of beer. Even if it is for fish breading, you might check with the lodge owner just to be safe. I boil the potatoes the night before and cut them up in the morning- really saves time. The other post have some great ideas for you. We too use a Rubbermaid storage tub and it holds everything. One thing I did a few years ago was to bring an old grill grate from gas grill my neighbor threw out. Really helps to have a grate to place the pans on resuscitation trying to balance on a log or rock"
2532545,Baitslinger,2014-03-08 14:57:00,93,"We like the shore lunch experience, but don't like the work of filleting and prepping fish on shore. None of us are huge lunch eaters, so we often do a shore supper.We often will go out in the morning near camp, catch our fish for the meal, then head in and clean them in the comfort of the camp fish house. Wash & rinse there, and bring out a zip loc bag of coating. A couple cans of potatoes (they are already cooked and ready in just a few minutes) along with pre-diced onion and some crumbled bacon from a breakfast, all go into plastic bags. Everybody eats a few snacks as a light lunch to tide us over to dinner.We pull up on shore, late in the afternoon, start up the single burner gas stove, cook the taters (5 minutes), while someone wets the fish with some milk we carry out in a plastic water bottle. Shake them in the plastic bag of mix, and drop into the oil. Simple meal, but we all want to eat fish, not so much the beans, salad, potatoes, etc. Paper plates and plastic forks all go into a single garbage bag, and we are done in around 30 minutes. A nice quick nap, or a few minutes in the water on the sandy beach, and we are ready for the evening bite, with almost no clean up when we get back to camp.We only do this a few times each week, but the pictures we take are some of my favorites. Nothing like looking back at pictures of Grandpa sleeping on a rock while his boys are prepping fish, and the grandkids are resting, fishing, or reading a book in the sun."
2532745,SinOrSwim,2014-03-08 16:21:00,1528,"Shore lunch is one of the best parts of the Canada experience. Breaks up the day a little too. We take the propane cooker from camp. They have miniature propane tanks that fit in a compartment on the boat. Cooking over a fire is not as easy as it may seem. Getting temperatures right is hard. We also take a long turkey fryer thermometer with. We can always tell the temp of the oil. Yes, you can use a match or whatever but we know even when putting more fish in. You can ruin several pieces of fish if the temp isn't rightTake garbage bags. Put the pans in when you are done, putt he cooker in. Keeps the boat clean. Put all your stuff like silverware, plates, batter, utensils in a tote. We make a list and it's packed so we don't forget something. Use plastic silverware, paper plates etc to cut down on dishes.Canned potatoes are a great idea. Add some onions, peppers, bacon etc. When heating your oil put a can of beans in the oil to heat the beans in the can. Or if you can boil water while you are cleaning fish. Leave the bean can closed and put it in there. Cooks perfectly and no it wont' explode.We take buns or tortillas with and make fish sandwiches or tacos. Better than just a plain fish plank. Anoterh tip. Clean the fish and toss the fillet in one of your nets. Then, take the net to the back of the boat and run it trhough the water. All your fish will be clean and it's easier than bending over to clean them all. Honestly, I'm not sure there is a better meal than a well done shore lunch?We use Zatarains SEASONED fish fri. There are bunch of kinds of batter and we take a couple different ones each year to test. The Zatarains has always been the winner. But, we still like to tinker."

My wife and I have worked out a system for the evenings we cook/fry fish.We have the whole meals duties split up and it goes as fast as any other meal we'd make in the evening.I bought a propane fish cooker for our next trip so we can fry outside.I also make Cajun Blackened Walleye or some nights Walleye in garlic Butter on the grill.Those evenings my wife kicks back with an ice cold Kokanee or 3 and watches the master at work.Bill"

I bought a big campfire skillet at cabelas and cooked over a wood fire which I built between 2 big driftwood logs on a sand beach. We used canned sliced potatoes with a onion fried in cooking oil, got them done then wrapped in tin foil. Then fried up 8 walleyes with a seasoning blend I premixed at camp in a Ziploc also cooked pork and beans in the can. Tasted great and cant wait to do it again. Thanks again"

Takes a lot less time doing it this way. We used to use a whole stock of margarine for the potatoes but now use extra virgin olive oil as it's healthier. With regards to onions, we LOVE the Vidalia brand! These taste great mixed in with the potatoes. One or tow lemons which are cut up while the fish is cooking. No beans for our group though. By the way, last year we tried cracker crumbs on one shore lunch and everyone loved the taste. First cover the fillets in flour, then dip in a milk / egg wash, followed by the finely ground cracker crumbs."

Big pan with long handle, heat oil on open fire. fry two batchs of potatoes until almost done, remove from oil and set aside. shake fish in flour with whatever spices you like, chili, garlic salt, pepper etc., fry fish till done. Then toss precooked fries into oil to re-heat and gets them super crispy. add seasoned salt to taste. Toss second batch of fries into oil and add one sliced onion, cook for a few minutes--it's a nice change from regular fries. Usually have a can of beans or corn heating on edge of fire. Depending on number of people I sometimes use two pans at once, one for fish and one for fries.I will only cook fresh walleye and never worry about egg wash as I find just wash in water and straight into the flour works for me.I use a sack for the equipment but the tub idea sounds like a good idea."

2604185,jimmie,2014-03-27 20:00:00,123,"Juat be certain that you utilize one of the shore luch stations. There is uaully a fire ring set up in a safe area. If not make sure all duff ( leaves, needles & debis wood) and overhanging tree limbs are not at all close by. When carring any shore luch goodies avoid using any glaas if possible. I have seen many a broken piece of glass that could have a two that did start forest fires. Recall using glass or maginifying piece when we were kids then think of how hot that can get. If you should break any glass or come upon any safely store it and bring it back to camp to dispose of it. As for suggestions make it simple and google making a shore lunch kit (box). The source of your fire is your biz except when extreme drought conditions exist then you may have a Coleman as your only option. THey can be stored compactly and offer qucik heat for getting your tummy food quickly. Don't forget the breadding and stay safe. Enjoy the fish! Use the dogs as backup only! Don't forget to clean up and put the fire out! All the way out! Dead out! A Smokey quote."
2549202,Mike Borger,2014-03-13 03:25:00,1554,Our tartar sauce is made by Tibetan monks. The sour cream is crafted from fermented free range llama milk. The relish from organically grown cucumbers harvested from a plantation located in the foothills of the Andes. It's processed and packed by a team of vestal virgins then blessed by a priest before being delivered by a magic unicorn.It's delicious on everything.

The side pockets hold the oil, beans, and shore lunch mix. The small front pocket holds the needle nose pliers, spatula, garbage bag and fire starter. Pretty compact.

2546881,Mr. Sauger,2014-03-12 13:57:00,285,"As you have read so for, there are many best ways to do shore lunch. Lots of tradeoffs between convenience and equipment. Our Lac Seul shore lunch kit fits inside a medium sized plastic cooler. · Coleman white gas double burner suitcase stove· Two medium size cast iron pans (one for fish, one for spuds)· Pot (some days we also want baked beans or corn)· Sturdy paper plates· Plastic forks (byo knife)· Serving/stirring spoons· Fish flipper· oil· Fish batter· batter Bowl (sometimes just use a ziplock)· Paper towels· Cleaning stuff (scrub sponge, small bottle detergent)· Fillet board· Highly illegal can of beer for batter - oooh ooohWe like this system because everything fits into one container so we don't forget things. Put the whole darn box of plastic forks in the tub and leave them in there. Same for pots, pans, cleaning stuff Only maintenance is to reload the consumables (can of bakes beans, batter mix, brewski, and taters). Each year Jack gets a gold star for pre-making jacktaters. He fills a heavy-duty ziplock bag with par boiled potatoes, sautéed onions & mushrooms and some salt & pepper. Each bag is made and frozen before the trip. We just take a bag out of the cabin freezer in the morning and drop it in the shore lunch box. By lunchtime the jacktaters are thawed and ready for the skillet. Our shorelunches usually take 60 minutes  by then we are sick of the bugs & gulls and want to get back fishin.Finding a clean flat surface to cook & prep can be a challenge. Big flat rocks are only easy to find with a lower unit (however, there are some dandy rocks by big sand banks). Coolers can do double duty but where can you put all the stuff you take out? We eventually started bringing a small folding table (not in my boat). We also like sandy beaches for shorelunch so the boats don't get too beat and we have flat ground to walk on. Dip the tub in the lake to wash off the sand and you're ready to go. Cooking over open fires took too long to gather the wood, get tinder started, wait for right size logs to get going, wait for big flames to die down/coals ready to cook. Maintaining the correct fire heat gets old. Keeping it level can be tricky. More smoke in your eyes. Cooking beans in an opened can is fun, but washing a pot is easier in the long run."
2547169,forgop,2014-03-12 15:11:00,880,"I don't care if it's the best tartar sauce on the face of the earth. I don't cover up the taste of high quality fish or beef with sauce (unless it's a true chef prepared sauce, not a bottle). Bottled sauces are meant to mask the flavor of low grade foods."
2547353,camp chef,2014-03-12 15:57:00,915,"Our Tartar sauce is Chef prepared by a 3rd generation restaurant owner. High quality fish is good on it's own,but it is Great with well prepared tartar."

2533529,Pikeslayer8,2014-03-08 21:21:00,1460,"Yeah, I pretty much agree with what Danforth is saying, we just pack everything needed in the tupperware box and the fastest boat gets to lug it to the predetermined shore lunch site to drop it off. By doing that we claim our spot and frees up the boat all morning. If you go old school with a wood fire like we do, raid a beaver house for your wood. When you are done cooking your fish flip your skillet upside down on your fire, get the skillet as red hot as you can and take it and dunk it in the lake, wipe it off and you are good to go. Always make for dang sure your fire is out before leaving."

Shore lunch is part of the Canadian experience, and in 15 years of going, 10 years 2x per year, I can count on one hand the days we DIDN'T have shore lunch. Bigtime, you are missing out. Nothing like the sounds of the silence, watching the world spin, having a meal with friends, sharing and not sharing your own personal thoughts on the day, the meal, the world. Al lthat said, we took a turkey fryer with 3/8 steel rod legs, and cut the legs off, added some pipe stems, and now I can pop the legs off to make it pack better. I get that, my paper stuff, plastic silverware, crisco, 2 cans of spuds, spices, fish coatings, a can of beans, and an 8 quart cast iron dutch oven and a deep frying pan with a lid. I clean fish on a board that fits under the floor in a hold while somebody starts the spuds and onions. When they're done, we dump the beans in, give it a stir, put the lid on, and set it on a rock. The grease is ready when the fish are cleaned. All the stuff goes in a tupperware box, and it goes in the bow ahead of the console. I use a 10lb LP cylinder and it goes in one of the holds under the floor. We typically fish until 12 or 12;30, when the moring bite slacks off, have lunch, and plan the afternoon strategy."

2533337,danforth,2014-03-08 20:33:00,117,"Im starting to think guys overthink shore lunch way to much, its really quite simple, each boat hauls out some part of the equipment in a plastic tote when you start you trip in the morning to a designated spot, drop it off go fishing in a empty boat, bring back your catch at a set time you all decide on, clean what you need, the 2 best fish cleaners clean what you need for lunch while the others set up the other equipment, buy the time thats done your fresh fish are ready to fry. As for other things salt pepper shakers in a ziplock, your favorite fish seasoning in a box and a extra ziplock bag to shake the fish in with the seasoning. small jug of oil, eggs if you want them already mixed in a sealed dish, all the other stuff is canned, corn, spuds, baked beans, and any thing you like in cans, only open what you want and need, as for tools bring a portable coleman stove (we take 2) pans you want and tools and pans you need for cooking, when you are done put your dirty stuff in a couple of trash bags back in the totes close everything up, fish the rest of the day, each boat picks up there tote on the way back at the end of the day, I have yet to leave a shore lunch hungry and its by far the best food you will get, shore lunch always tastes better."
2531522,bigtimeelectric,2014-03-08 08:01:00,174,We just booked our trip to Lac Seul for late August. This will be our 9th year on the Lac. I have been thinking about doing a shore lunch this year for the first time. I have been going to Canada for 15 years and have never done the shore lunch thing. So I have a few questions for some of you experienced shore lunch folks. 1. We bring our own boats and the one common theme amongst most of us is to keep the clutter to a minimum. I want to confine all the items for lunch to a very compact area. I don't want to be tripping on pans and lp cylinders or whatever. does anyone have any tricks to avoid the clutter? 2. I am thinking building a small wood fire and cooking over that in a large man pan would be the way to go. Any advice on that? 3.Any other advice you can give would be great? We usually run 20 miles from camp so coming back for lunch isn't a option. We usually pack sandwiches And after fishing all day we grow tired of all the effort involved of preparing a fresh fish meal at the end of a long day on the water. Would rather sit back have a cocktail and enjoy some easy table fare at the end of the day. I am curious if anyone has some of the same thoughts on this.
2531570,bushead11,2014-03-08 08:11:00,151,"15 Years and no shore lunch... Crazy! My first recommendation is to ask your outfitter if they have any shore lunch stations set up. The camp we go to has 3 different shore lunch locations set up and different distances from the lodge so you dont have to make the whole trip back. Each station has a lock box with oil, pans, cooking utensils. All we have to bring is spuds, beans, chips and our fresh catch..."
2531586,camp chef,2014-03-08 08:15:00,915,"When we have a big group and plan on having shore lunch we usually have lunch several times during the week. We haul our cooker, table, shore lunch chairs etc. to our shore lunch location and set it up for the week in advance. One trip in with all the stuff one trip out at the end of the week. We take fish and side dishes, tartar says bread etc, in daily for lunch."
2531610,Kansas Bound,2014-03-08 08:26:00,152,"Maybe not much help here because we pack our coleman powerhouse stove and 14"" cast iron skillet each day for lunch."
2531626,pjshorthorn,2014-03-08 08:29:00,5654,"BigTime:The easiest way we have found to keep shore lunch stuff organized is to use a large Tupperware tote that may have been along as a container for groceries or other camp items on the trip in. One normally is enough for pans, food and utensils.If you are cooking over an open fire, build a small fire pit out of rocks from the area you decide to eat at and utilize a grill grate that spans the fire pit. Let the fire die down to a good bed of coals before starting to fry fish, potatos , etc. In the meantime, if you have beans as part of the meal, cook them right in the can with the lid opened and still attached ( easy to handle moving them around the fire with needle nose pliers ) while the fire is burning down into coals. If you decide to spruce up the fish with other fixings like tarter sauce or other sauces, have that ready the night before and packaged so it can go in the drink cooler that you would carry. We try to keep shore lunch pretty simple. Hotdogs are also a good add on for anyone that has a big appetite.Have fun with shore lunch and make it your own tradition.PjShorthorn"
2531810,michigan walleye guy,2014-03-08 09:44:00,95,"I would go to YouTube and search RealOutdoors for their 26+ minute episode on catching and cooking shore lunch. Everything that could possibly matter, filleting the fish, preparing the fire, all utensils needed, etc. is included in this show. For that matter, just searching ""shore lunch"" on YouTube is a literally endless diversion to the winter blues. There are some real excellent clips online.The episode I am referring to takes place at South Shore Lodge on Eagle Lake, and since the Whitens guy who produces the show is a fellow yooper, I like to watch it. Great show."
2531842,bigtimeelectric,2014-03-08 09:54:00,174,"camp chef, I do like the idea of dropping your equipment off in the bush for the week. One person in our group used to do shorelunch with a different group and his stories of that don't sound that appealing, although they used to do it on flyins which would be more of a challenge than having your own larger boat and the ability to bring more things from home."
2531874,Glenman12,2014-03-08 10:02:00,762,"Our lodge, as Im sure many others have shore lunch kits..ours consist of two crates, which really aren't that big and they hold the pans, plates forks etc you will need..we just let the owners know we will need them the day before and they are on our cabin porch the next morning...to save time we dice up the potatoes and onions the night before and put them in Ziploc bags and then throw them along with the fillets in the cooler the next morning.."
2531890,bigtimeelectric,2014-03-08 10:02:00,174,"Maybe a dumb question, but what is a yooper? And yes you are right about you tube I have watched a few videos on there and am gonna watch a few more as soon as I finish watching Al"
