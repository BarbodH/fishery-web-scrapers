Jig fishing with minnows was the preferred method as we tried Leeches which worked ok and plastics that didn't work at all. As far as numbers 27"" eye was largest followed by 5 between 25"" and 26"" 4 24"" 4 23"" and lots of 19 to 22""eyes And way more than we would ever need for keepers Also we caught several Large northerns including a 40"",36"" and 35"" on medium light spinning rod with 6lb line awesome fight! Gawleys run a fantastic resort with everything you need. Doug gave me a couple spots to try that produced very well and his Minnows were some of the best I have seen in all my trips to Canada. It rained hard on Friday so now I have my boat in the shed with all compartments open and my gear laying on the gunwales drying out. Fishing was so good we kept fishing in the downpour... Excellent experience can't wait till next year!!!!!"
3138993,MorganMan,2014-08-31 09:37:00,341,"Great to hear! Do you know what the water temp was? How deep were you finding active fish? We are headed to Onaway in a few days, can't wait."
3141081,bigtimeelectric,2014-09-01 10:27:00,174,Water temp 67 fish were caught between 14 and 22'. If the weather cooperates you should have a awesome bite. I heard chatter on the radio that lots of guys were doing very well down in the Manitoba pt area as well.
3142353,BChris,2014-09-01 21:07:00,11,"We are heading up Monday to fish out of Whitewing, which appears to be located very close to Gawleys. We have not been up there before, so are hiring a guide to show us some ""safe"" routes on day 1, then we are on our own. Did you travel very far from the resort? With all the stories about rocks & stumps, we intend to be fairly cautious, so we may not run too far until we get a bit of confidence in our routes. We planned to throw the tackle box at them, but we'll definitely plan to use minnows, based on your experience. Thanks."
3144961,vaquero01,2014-09-02 16:53:00,101,"Morgan, I am at Onaway right now. The water temp is about 66 every where I have been, from here to South Inlet (go see the water fall). Fishing in South Inlet didn't work for us, but just outside of Hungry Narrows, the entrance to South Inlet, is a big white rock. Caught a 25"" walleye and a 34"" northern on the E/NNE side of it about 30 feet off in 25 foot of water. My wife and I have caught many fish just outside of the entrance to Bay of Islands. There are two islands just about due north as you enter. A great spot for us has been north of the east island off about 300 feet in 25 foot of water. Just sit there and jig. I want to try casting but we have a yellow lab with us that will chase the lure. Maybe we will leave him in the cabin (7) tomorrow. I want to meet you and your brothers. Maybe next year. We are trying to arrange a ten day stay. Good luck."

3147625,MikeinMN,2014-09-03 11:37:00,190,"BChris, since you have never been to Lac Seul before I highly recommend a GPS with a Lac Seul chip. If you don't have one on your boat get a handheld. There used to be channel and hazard marker buoys placed on the lake but many of these are no longer where they should be. The GPS map chip will at least show their proper location. The chip does not show every hazard, but with a little additional advice from your guide you should have no problems. Unfortunately I do think you will have to run some distance to find numbers of fish this time of year and the GPS with a chip will help you do so."
3147777,BChris,2014-09-03 12:24:00,11,"Thanks Mike. I picked up a Navionics Plus, USA & Canada chip and it appears to work like it is supposed to in my Humminbird (with a little help from Kirt Hedquist from this site). From what I understand, there is some extrapolation of depths/contours rather than a true lake survey, so l can't trust it 100%. It should help me keep oriented, and give me an idea of where we are, and where we are heading.We have 3 boats, so all should have GPS tracks to follow after our day with the guide. The other 2 boats went to the south central part of the lake last year. One of them ruined a prop, and beat up his lower unit pretty bad. I decided to buy the chip based on their experiences, and after reviewing messages left on this site."
