Up river rapids not able to tackle this late in the season. Went down 3 rapids on the down river side, but the 4th was non-negotiable. Down lake neck down that returns to river was the hottest walleye bite. Jigs and Gulp worked just fine. Decent size pike if you are into that. This fly in is run by Twin Lake outfitters out of Nakina. The cabin is only a little over a year old and is very nice. Solar electric interior lighting, solar electric water pump out of lake for showers, gas ref. ,gas cook stove, gas hot water and wood heat. Exterior portajohn. Plusses, private lake with only our two boats on it. Great eye, pike and perch fishing. As mentioned very nice cabin, safe lake even with fairly strong winds. Chad from twin lakes is a great host. Neg. Mosquitos were heavy and fishing options some what limited."
