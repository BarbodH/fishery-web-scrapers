1469683,gobblestopper,2012-08-02 14:07:00,36,Reports?
1469737,Golden Eagle,2012-08-02 15:20:00,2642,Fished it one day in 1963. Haven't heard anything about it since. Thanks for bringing it up. Looking forward to your report.
1469856,Ogoki,2012-08-02 19:03:00,291,"Golden Eagle , was that the year 17 opened connecting The Soo to Thunder Bay ? Just on a hunch I thought you may have driven 17 then ??"
1469858,Golden Eagle,2012-08-02 19:11:00,2642,It opened a few years before I fished the lake. We had good brookie fishing at about every stream we tried along the highway. Walking a few hundred feet put us onto fish.
1470093,Ogoki,2012-08-03 09:46:00,291,Curiosity got the best of me and I found Rt 17 was completed and and opened in 1960 . Also both camps on Kabenung Lake are For Sale . Forgot to mention that on my earlier post . I ran across that a couple months ago as a friend was looking into going there . I fished it in September in the early 1990's but never returned .
