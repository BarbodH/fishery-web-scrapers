3162017,Glenman12,2014-09-08 19:58:00,762,my question is where did they come from...been going to Cedar for 33 yrs and have only been aware of their presence for 5 yrs or so..

3162913,Bill Krejca,2014-09-09 08:15:00,6107,"According to one resort owner I talked with at a sports show last spring, the crappies got into the lake some years ago when high water connected another lake which had crappies in it. How they got there wasn't explained. Perhaps a little know fact, many of the lakes in that part of the province were stocked with crappies, them not being native to the water. For example, LOW was stocked, I believe, in the 1920's. My dad caught an 18 incher in the 1930's, let it go to help keep them in the waters. Bill"
3163801,prov1800,2014-09-09 13:05:00,5010,From what i know and i dont know much is that someone putvthem in a small lake a few years ago with a small creek that connects to cedar and on high water they can get through it into cedar.dont think they will harm the system.but they might eat a lot of the fry that hatches every year especially muskie fry being they spawn so late.as far as fishing for iam all for that.they are a blast to catch and great table fare.only a couple of years ago we did start hearing about them.but have also heard they are in eagle lake as well as wabigoon.they have a limit of 15 per angler.two people in the boat and they fill up the livewell in a hurry.havnt heard any reports that there in perrault or wabaskang that ive heard of although cant see why that wont happen as they spread out.
3164321,bigwillies,2014-09-09 15:49:00,515,back when wogenstahls still had the camp(now clarkes)they would say every so often a guest would bring in a crappie cuaght by accident.that was in the neighborhood of 15 years ago.so they have been there for a while.
3164873,Glenman12,2014-09-09 20:03:00,762,ok..sounds right..just speaking from my experience and what my lodge owner has said...this past June me and my partner were going to spend some time targeting them but the walleyes fishing was just too good..
