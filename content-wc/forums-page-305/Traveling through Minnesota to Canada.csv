You need A.I.S. training and a sticker just to drive through our great state next year even if you are not going to be launching here!!! And the money goes to a third party,am I the only one who thinks this is nuts!!!!!!!! Here is the link. http://www.trailers.mndnr.gov/"

3145897,dutchboy,2014-09-02 20:14:00,5717,Write a letter to the Minnesota dept. of tourism voicing your complaint. They are the only people who can stop the tyrants in the DNR.
3145913,BreezyPoint,2014-09-02 20:17:00,1581,The letters need to go to your legislators. They passed the bill. Hardly makes the DNR tyrants.Frank
3146313,troutwater,2014-09-03 05:10:00,299,I've exchanged some e-mails with the DNR and this is pretty much what they told me.
3146377,dutchboy,2014-09-03 05:43:00,5717,Which legislator would author a bill like this without checking with the DNR first?
3146585,BreezyPoint,2014-09-03 07:24:00,1581,"In Minnesota, legislators do that all the time, without regard to science or biology. You can go to the legislatures website and find the authors of the bill. They are most likely from the metro area. Although I personally do not have much problems with the bill, I do have a major problem with the way the legislature acts on these issues and I keep in close touch with my legislators on bills like this.Here is the link to the bill. The chief author is from Bemidji.https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bil...2&ssn=0&y=2013Frank"
