3145009,Andyeye,2014-09-02 17:01:00,179,"Sorry, to hear about the weather. I'm glad to hear you got into the crappies though. We were hoping to catch some but never did. Most of our fishing was 18' of depth or less and we fished wind blown points and reefs the week of the 9th to the 16th. We did well on the reefs. If you want to send me a pm I would like to to swap some info with you. P.S. take your own boat my Alumacraft Navigator is much more comfortable than the bench seats boats I have fished out of on fly in trips. Can you say Preparation H I could after 10 days on those metal seats."
3145865,Glenman12,2014-09-02 20:08:00,762,its funny about the crappies...Ive going to Cedar for 33 yrs and never saw a crappie til about 7-8 yrs ago..not sure how they got in there but they are there..
3099633,Andyeye,2014-08-18 08:11:00,179,"We just got back yesterday from Cedar Lake. Ray and Kathi are great people and the fishing was very good considering it was our first time on this lake. A special thanks to Fellow WC member Rich and his group for putting us on some fish right away up there. Our group caught 14 walleyes over 20"" the biggest two were 25"" and 26"" we caught lots of 18"" to 19"" fish and had plenty the 15"" and 16"" fish for dinner and take home fish. Lots of smallies but no big ones with 16.5"" the biggest. 10' to 12' seemed to be the best and we had a ball fishing slip bobbers on the reefs in 10' catching lots of 18""s and 19""s this way."
3100905,Guest,2014-08-18 14:39:00,0,Andy eye thanks for report we have party of 5 from chicago going to resort 1st week of September good report did you fish for northerns and muskies any large ones; did you fish gull island for walleyes any good areas would be appreciated what depth most walleyes? Thanks jim wolf chicago boys
3101201,Andyeye,2014-08-18 16:35:00,179,"We did not fish for Muskie or Northern we did catch some but we did not target them. We saw a lot of Muskie fisherman around the lake but only heard of a few being caught nothing huge. We fished the Gull Island area and caught fish jigging with the green core shot 3"" tails and motor oil 3"" tails dressed with 1/3 of a crawler. We caught 95% of our fish with crawlers. It was about 65% walleyes and 35% smallmouth for our group. We caught fish in 7' to 18' of water but most were 9' to 12' it seemed to me. Good Luck! and I hope you have as much fun as we did"
3101385,Rich B,2014-08-18 17:34:00,1081,"Our group (my twin brother Dave from Milwaukee and friend Brad from Cincinnati) were also up at CPR last week. My brother is 14 hours away (pulling his Lund), while Brad and I had another 12 hours to drive to get home.Had a very fun week and met Andy, John and their other 2 friends from Iowa; and had 2 nice young men next to us in another cabin from northern UP. They both will be heading into Marine boot camp in a few weeks; so they were enjoying a fun week ""up north"" before leaving civilian life for 4+ years of service to our country.We fished points/drops and flats with Kalin twister tails (5"" in Bluegill), crank baits, jigging spoons, V-b's, and a swimming jig (with a 5"" power leech). Caught walleyes up to 28"" and pike into the low 30's....also caught 4 Muskies (small to upper 30s) so we had a good week though no trophies.Early and late the fish were shallow, though during the day we found the fish in '16 - 28' of water. My friend Brad lost a heavy walleye deep off a rock pile, and then later picked up a 24"" walleye off the same rock pile.Weather was really too good for fishing, with mid-week bring cloud-less ""blue bird"" sky for several days....the camp's Tues evening Fish Fry was a fun time, and we were able to talk with other guests. Ray and Kathi run a clean, well organized camp that has a great location on the Cedar chain, new docks and stairways and a number of new decks off their cabins.My thanks to Andy and his buddies for sharing a large plate of chicken legs they had grilled out with us on Thursday evening (we drove into camp a day early as we needed to leave a day early); so as we were packing my brother's Lund our dinner arrived (tasty and warm). Andy and his friends are class acts, and it was great to meet other WC's north of the border.This is the first time I or our group have fished Cedar Lake chain mid-august as we normally fish it on the Opener (we did not this year, and rescheduled to last week). What was great to see was the lake has a high number of younger walleyes in several year classes, so the lake is very healthy (all the fish we caught - i.e. perch/pike/SM Bass/Musky/walleye were all heavy for their size).Am already thinking about the '15 Spring Opener at CPR.Faith, Family, Friends.....and fishing,Rich B"
3101953,JOE WALLEYE,2014-08-18 19:37:00,753,I will be at CPR starting this Saturday the 23rd of August. This will be my first time on cedar lake. These reports are really getting me pumped up!
3102561,Guest,2014-08-19 04:36:00,0,andy eye rich b thanks for reports will issue my trip report on 9/8 jim wolf Chicago boys
3139977,JOE WALLEYE,2014-08-31 20:06:00,753,"Just returned yesterday from my week at Cedar Point Resort. This was my first time at CPR and my first time on cedar lake. we had major variations in weather each day from overcast and drizzle rain, to high blue sky and sun, to torrential down pours. we managed to catch fish in all of the variable conditions. Monday and Tuesday were our best days with a good stiff breeze and overcast conditions. Ray and Kathie run a good operation and the cabin worked out great for our group. The boats left something to be desired but served us well and had reliable outboards. The biggest surprise for me were the Crappie. I have never caught crappie like this. Crappie up to 15"" were easy to catch, they were mixed in with the walleye and we caught them all day long. The walleye we caught were mostly small, we would sort thru 10 little cigars before picking up a 15 incher for lunch. walleye and crappie were in 10' to 22' of water on wind blown points. depth depended on sun conditions and time of day. we did catch some bass up to 16"" mixed in with the walleye and crappie, we never targeted the bass. we spent one afternoon pike/Muskie fishing and my boat partner landed a nice northern that was near 40"". overall it was a great trip and I am looking foreword to going back. I just don't think I will be spending a week in those little camp boats again."
3142241,Glenman12,2014-09-01 20:01:00,762,What was wrong with their camp boats..according to their website they are 16footers..were you fishing 3 to a boat?..I go to Cedar Lake Lodge and theres ample room in their 16 footers..
3142361,JOE WALLEYE,2014-09-01 21:11:00,753,"The boats are 16' long, but narrow and have bench seats so moving from stern to bow is difficult. They have swivel seats mounted on the benches but they are just plastic with no padding. After 7 days on the water I was ready for some more creature comforts. I wish I would have towed my Alumacraft up there."
3142873,Glenman12,2014-09-02 07:43:00,762,"Ok I see..yes, that wouldnt be fun for 7 days.."
