3139897,Moosebunk,2014-08-31 19:32:00,211,If I lived where you do I'd break down efforts like this only because I'm familiar with the two fisheries. October Lake St. Clair anytime. Windier days you can still hit the Detroit and other protected areas. November BOQ. The walleye fishing can be incredible for big fish.
3140017,KraTToR,2014-08-31 20:43:00,681,"Thanks Moose, makes sense for sure."
3166969,KraTToR,2014-09-10 17:34:00,681,So what kind of depth and presentation should I be considering?
3128497,KraTToR,2014-08-27 12:04:00,681,"Hi everyone, time to book some vacation for fall fishing trips. I live in KW so I don't want to hear about Nipigon or LOTW..Places that are 4 hours or less one way. Here is what i'm thinking:Lake St. Clair on days w/o a ton of windWhat about long point? Are there walleyes there?Kawarthas, any preference?North Kawarthas (Jacks Lake?)Bay of Quinte, is this a good as May?NosbonsingFrench RiverI'm a multi species fishermen but usually start fishing for walleye (dinner) then move onto something more exciting (Bass, Pike, Muskie)."
3128753,Blue Lk,2014-08-27 14:23:00,269,"I find it very interesting that our friends from south of the border will travel for days to fish NWO (saw several plates from Arizona today),but fishermen from southern ont won't come here for some of the best drive to fishing in the province."
3128945,KraTToR,2014-08-27 15:49:00,681,"Hey Blue, I totally agree! I'm definately coming up to NWO but I'm waiting until I can spend 2-3 weeks in the area. For this fall I'm looking at weekends only as I have no other time off work.Guess I should have mentioned that."
3129001,Blue Lk,2014-08-27 16:02:00,269,"Ok,now your question makes total sense,hopefully somebody from that area will chime in.Maybe ask the same question OFN,lots of info about your area on there."
3129529,Jacob's Dream,2014-08-27 20:11:00,259,Quinte is the place to go in the fall for the biggest walleye in the world. Adolphous Reach.
3130929,KraTToR,2014-08-28 11:54:00,681,Nice!I'm back from our trip to Europe on September 27th so maybe the thanksgiving long weekend would be an idea.Anyone interested?
3132905,FrankLeigh,2014-08-28 21:58:00,80,"We have fished Hay Bay, Long Reach, Telegraph Narrows and the Napanee River in May, June, September and October, many times. Also the Telegraph Narrows area through the ice in January and February various times. Our best trips were in May and June (but not this year).I have heard from many others, and seen some evidence, that November is the best time for the monster walleye that come in from Lake Ontario, through Adolphous Reach. Most cabins/cottages close after Thanksgiving weekend, but there is an outfitter just outside of Picton that stays open a little longer. Do a search for Bay of Quinte fishing on Google. Also search on here for older threads on ""Bay of Quinte"".If you have your own boat, then you can just rent a motel at Picton.If you stayed on Hay Bay or towards Deseronto, you would have a long, cold run down to Adolphous.Good luck to you, and be sure to tell us how it was.FrankLeigh"
3133497,Consigliere,2014-08-29 07:15:00,132,"It's pretty likely that the timeframe for big walleye in Quinte will be moved up. The big girls have been staging on the shoals at the entrance areas to the spawning grounds for a few weeks now. Probably won't be too long and they will move into the Reach, if some aren't there already.We've been doing well fishing out of Kingston on Melville shoal area. Bite seems to be best around dusk till 11PM. Usually 3-4 fish per trip and some good size. Average about 24"" probably. Can send me a PM if you are coming down and can give you additional details."
3133689,KraTToR,2014-08-29 08:23:00,681,PM sent.
3138433,FISH HUNTER,2014-08-31 06:48:00,161,Since you are so close Quinte should be a no brainer. Fall walleye on quinte is a world class trophy fishery. FISH HUNTER
