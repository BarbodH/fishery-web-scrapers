2362722,kzoofisher,2014-01-18 12:13:00,5144,217 days to lake Windermere. Hate to wait that long but that's life. I think it's harder on my 12 yo then me. On the plus side he shows me every good walleye video he finds and that saves me a lot of time. Also Mom sees it as bonding so she's cool with us watching fishing shows. That's real different.
