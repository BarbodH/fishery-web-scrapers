3142081,KraTToR,2014-09-01 19:24:00,681,Thanks Big... Is the access road gravel? Do they have overnight parking? Are there any campsites on the river (islands?) or is it best to go with one of the camps? Thanks in advance!
3142681,bigcreekdad,2014-09-02 06:56:00,74,"Access road is gravel....about 16 miles of it. I would guess the store at the launch would charge you for overnite, but not really sure. I used to stay at one of the lodges (Casa Blanca...now closed I believe) and parking was in the package. I know nothing about campsites there. There are two very good lodges in that area.....Lunge Lodge and Chaudiere Lodge.If camping is your interest, you might think about the ""lower upper french""....the section just below the dams near the Dokis reserve. That area is accessible via Wolsey Bay. There are plenty of campsites in that section of the French. Also, some fine lodges....two right at the bay (Totem Point and Wolsey Lodge), and my favorite, Crane's Lochaven Lodge, about a 20 minute boat ride from the bay. If you are interested in a housekeeping lodge in that section, I'd recommend Bryer Lodge. I fish this area of the French 3 to 4 times a season.Hope this helps.PM me if you wish."

Casablanca is still open and there is a new camp but for all three the pickup point is Dokis. The marina has two concrete ramps I'm aware of, with a small store and rentable accommodation - very small number, like 3 or four I would say. I've never camped but have observed several kayakers camping in places -- many of the islands are privately leased with cabins but it seems like there are plenty of places you can find to camp if you would like -- absolutely no facilities though and the area has designated fire rings. Like Big Creek Dad, I recommend one of the camps and Lunge is my favorite (though I have not tried the others)."
