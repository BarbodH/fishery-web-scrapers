539346,Guest,2004-05-06 17:03:00,0,"Man, this is one of the most hilarious posts I have ever seen...I'm posting it on the Floridasportsman.com East Central Florida Forum for the laugh... We have a group from Florida that goes up to NW Ontario every year...We have a way year over year to make sure the guys we want on the trip are there...One guy runs the invite list for the next year and asks for a 500 deposit as soon as we get back for the next year...first come first serve...works every time...especially if your trying to dump a penny pincher..you should try it. We'll be in the North Woods at the end of May... Can't wait..."
539347,Guest,2004-05-06 18:04:00,0,"i've been enjoying it too rob. and feeling thankful that the guys i go with always pay their share, we all get along pretty well to. i do think your idea has real merit for the original poster's situation, if the guy shows up ask for deposit on the way home. other nice thing about that is next year is paid for in advance, just need pocket (and license) money!"
539358,Guest,2004-05-07 22:48:00,0,"I got dumped from a group once. Funny thing is I would have never gone back a second time with that group. The ""leader"" had to have everything done his way. When it was my turn to do the dishes he wouldn't get out of the kitchen (housekeeping cabin) and let me take care of the dishes and cleanup without sticking his nose in. I was doing it ""wrong"". In fact I did ""everything"" wrong! Even the homemade pancakes and other special stuff that I made, at no charge to the group, to make everyone a special breakfast weren't good enough. Maybe I shouldn't have let him hold up my stringer when the pictures were being taken. Oh well! There are a couple of other groups that I have been in for 20+ years and they allways invite me back. Maybe they do everything wrong also! ;)"
539378,eyeman_1,2004-05-09 07:33:00,690,"We've just experienced almost the exact same thing on our annual trip to Lake Erie. This guy has been going since we began taking our own boats 13yrs ago. This guy brings his boat but he has lousy equipment, rarely catches many fish, constantly moans about what we buy for groceries(even though he sees the list every year before we go shopping), constantly does things on the cheap and wonders why his stuff falls apart, and then at the end of the trip has to be the guy to divey up the catch:""Because everyone should get their fair share."" This guy is so tight that when he opens his wallet moths fly out. This year we brought his son with, he's always wanted to bring his son and we had a guy cancel so it was a perfect chance to do so. He was such a jerk even his son was embarrased that he walked out of the house to get away. Not to sound too corny but the tribe has spoken and he's out. Now it's up to me to tell him. Just going without inviting him wont do. Not telling him we're going isn't right either. It wont be easy but I'm planning on telling him in the spring that nobody enjoyed his company last year and for much of the past several years. We go to fish and enjoy each others company and what they have to offer. He's no longer welcom. It wont be easy but it's the best and honest way to go about it. At least that's what I think and what I intend to try to do."
539380,phern,2004-05-09 10:24:00,151,Wow....you guys go fishing with other men!!!???
539223,Ivy,2004-04-30 08:28:00,556,We worked out that on the front end with our Fly-out service. There was no way we could stay under the weight restrictions and bring all the beer we wanted ( i.e. needed ) for the week. Our Fly-out service picked up the beer in town and flew it in before we got there. We paid them for the beer when we settled up. No extra charge for the delivery as he was going there anyway. Ivy Brings his own anchor?
539229,RK,2004-04-30 10:30:00,35,"Hiya, I wasn't on this particulr trip (thank God) but I think the worst fiasco I've ever heard was a group that went to Rainy Lake for a few days. They all divided up the pre-trip tasks - food, beer, camp arrangements, etc. 'Bob,' the guy responsible for the food was a new member of the group. Before the trip he'd planned the menu for the entire trip, priced out the food and asked all to kick in as usual. Bill was pretty cheap and the guys were pretty impressed. When they got to the camp they discovered that the 'menu' was 32 boxes of Pop Tarts. One box per person per meal. Nothing else. From what I was told, there was serious discussion about smearing pop tarts on the guy, tying him to a tree as bear bait, then killing and eating the bear - once it got done working Bob over. He didn't go the next year. Guess he couldn't get the time off or something :) RK"
539240,Guest,2004-04-30 14:19:00,0,"Your responses have excited me so much that Im going to tell the rest of the story. Actually I have to do everything in camp. I do all the cooking, dishwashing, fish cleaning, cabin cleaning and the boat chores. The rest of the guys just sit around get drunk and play poker. It sounds bad but I dont mind because the guys I fish with are barely smart enough to come in out of the rain. There are nine of us on our trip and since I catch 80% of the fish its OK that I have to do the work. I even let them hold my fish to get their pictures taken so their families will think they caught some fish. Its sad but I figure anytime a man can reach out and help the 8 worst fisherman on the planet that the good Lord will have me in his book when I check into that walleye hole in the sky."
539259,Kilroy,2004-05-02 07:57:00,59,"Hmmmmmmm, Mike you sound like a helluva guy, you wanna go fishing? Our group is smaller and we use paper plates......the fish are so big we have to throw them back. We do provide rubber gloves so you wont ruin your hands in the dishwater. Kilroy ~~~o00o~(_)~o00o~~~"
539267,Guest,2004-05-02 20:00:00,0,Sounds like your group might appreciate a great guy like me. Do you have those rubber gloves in extra large?
539270,Guest,2004-05-03 05:24:00,0,Tell him the trip is dry this year. Most guys I know..I mean all the guys I know would bail.
539287,Guest,2004-05-04 03:15:00,0,NOW THAT'S FUNNY!!
539291,Pooch,2004-05-04 06:27:00,4619,"It seems that every group sooner or later gets a chump. Like most groups our's has changed over the years. Four of our original guys have passed away over the last few years. So there are friends or brothers that fill in. Some have been great while others give you a slow boil. I seem to have ended up as the organizer over the years and I just will not invite anyone who is a pain. Everyone looks forward to our trips too much to deal with a cheapskate, slacker, whiner, leech or whatever. It is hard to know who is compatable with your group until it is too late. If you get stuck with a chump you just have to roll with it. Don't let it ruin your trip. The last bonehead we had had about a thousand jokes and was a good teller. That seemed to be the only thing he was good for. Every group gets one from time to time. On the flip side some guys who you are worried about turn out to be great and stay with and contribute to the group. It is hard to tell most of the time. Pooch"
539337,Guest,2004-05-06 08:04:00,0,"We had invited a guy who claimed to love fishing. Turns out he would not touch any fish (even minnows) without first putting on this Rapala Fillet Glove, and even with the glove would not touch a leech. He then cast into a tree and pulled straight back.. His line snapped and he hit his boatmate in the face with the pole, causing the guy to fall back and drop his rod in the water. After that we just tortured him all week with dead minnows in his bed, leaches in his hat and other things. He did not want to come back. We daily would put a minnow in a shot glass and everyone would throw $20 on the table to get the guy to drink it. For $180 he would not touch it. As a parting shot I put a pile of dead minnows and leeches under his front seat for the ride home."

539197,Guest,2004-04-29 10:15:00,0,I took the advice of the majority and went over to the bums house and told him he was not going because he is a butt head. His wife overheard the conversation and was very upset that she would have to put up with him for that week. By the time I left the house she had given me his boat his rods and reels his Rolex and 50% interest in their home equity. Needless to say he is going back to Canada this year with the group. I however will be in Aruba that week with his wife.
539199,Guest,2004-04-29 10:19:00,0,Good job....There are three winners here. You have the makings of a good Apprentice. This whole thing has me thinking...it's perfect for as new series with viewer participation.

Only the few like me and thee ( and I'm not sure about thee ) Twain; will use his God given ability to out-think his opponent. Anyway, when you are in Aruba, I would recommend "" Baby Beach "". It's called that because it is knee deep for hundreds of yards with snow white sand. Oh yeah and the women typically only wear a one piece bathing suit. ( If ya know what I mean. ) Ivy"

539209,Guest,2004-04-29 13:42:00,0,"No joke. I know some guys that had the same problem. After two years of stuff like you described they planned trip #3. They had their meeting and everybody was given the list of what they were supposed to bring, and the cheap guy, lets call him ""Ned"", was told (one more time) that he had yet to cough up his share of the deposit on the cabin. ""Ned"" didn't have it on him (again). So Saturday morning, the boys drove around and gathered up in two rigs and left for Canada. Nobody picked up ""Ned"". He burned his vacation for nothing. End of problem. I hate them guys!"
539210,Guest,2004-04-29 13:48:00,0,"Simple solution: 3 guys go out fishing, only 2 return. Accidents do happen. I'm sure his wife won't mind either.hehehe"
539214,Guest,2004-04-29 17:22:00,0,Try a different camp and forget to tell him or just change the date.
539219,kingfisher42,2004-04-30 05:47:00,1,"We had a guy that refused to help and bragged about his wife always doing everything at home. When his turn to do the dishes, he said he don't do dishes at home so he ain't doing them here. I did the dishes, but left his on the table. After a while, he asked why his were not done. I told him I was waiting for his wife to come up and do them. End of discussion, and he got the message. Whats worse is the guy that backs out at the last minute and stiffs the others for picking up his share. We ended that by requiring all money up front. One guy does all the food purchases. We send him enough to cover the cost, plus some, and we use this left over money for extras needed at the camp. One man takes care of the camp deposit and cost. We send him that money months ahead of time. Everyone tosses a fifty in a zip lock bag for gas up and back. Booze is one your own as some don't drink. Whats left over when we return is split up between the men and no problems this way. At camp, we are lucky now in that one guy likes to cook and is good at it. One guy fillets all the fish and he's great at that. One guy cleans the boats and tops of the gas in each every night. I do the dishes. Everyone good at what they do, and no one person overwhelmed. Works for us and we know up front whats expected and agree. Makes for a good week."
539220,Guest,2004-04-30 06:31:00,0,"Our biggest problem is a guy (lets call him Tex) who shows up for the fly-in trip with about 140 pounds of gear when we have a 100 lb/person limt. He's got a 10-gallon jug of peanut oil???, boots that weigh ten pounds each and his own anchor. This is the same guy who wants to consume more alcohol than any body else, so when were at the beer store he pushes for enormous quantities that put us further over the weight limit. How do you tell a guy like this to shape up?"
539178,Guest,2004-04-28 20:06:00,0,"send him to iraq for the summer, tell him the food is free from the govt. and the fishing is good, hey"
539181,Guest,2004-04-28 21:42:00,0,We took a friend of ours a couple of years to Canada only to find out how cheap he really was. We took our boats and motors even though he had a motor as large a HP as ours. He paid for his groceries and gas like everyone else but drank our booze even though we went to town to buy extra booze he would not pitch in. The corker was when we would go in a resturant we left a tip but not him and he would be the last to leave the table and my wife watched him at a distance and when he left the table he picked up our tips and put it in his pocket. We went to another lodge and told him there is no room as we fill up the cabin and also our boats are full.
539185,Guest,2004-04-29 05:36:00,0,"You guys are all whimps...Tell him ""You're Fired"". End of discussion."
539186,Sam,2004-04-29 06:38:00,16,"I was thinking the same thing. Quit acting like a bunch of little girls. If he is being cheap, tell him to pay up. If he is sitting around, tell him to do the dishes. If he is complaining, tell him to shut up."
539189,Guest,2004-04-29 07:46:00,0,"Please tell the poor guy he can't go, immediately. He definately should skip a year to see what he is missing.....he might find out he isn't missing anything at all. Do yourselves a favor and find some wonderful gentleman to take his place, (from Iowa is always a safe bet) and move on. Let him start his own trip and see what kind of people he gets stuck with, bet they are all chumps like him."
539190,Guest,2004-04-29 08:21:00,0,Tell him the truth! You can't stand his #### and you don't want him along. Don't treat him like a #### and you guys shouldn't act like *****s'. Tell him to #### off! Be Aggresive Bomber Bob

539155,Guest,2004-04-28 10:08:00,0,"We have a guy who goes to Canada with us every year and we cant get rid of him. He never takes a bath, he cant catch fish, he sits on his can at night and drinks beer and wont do a thing to help. He always complains about everything and normally wont pay his fair share because he says his wife wont give him the money. Last year we told him we were not going and when we got to the cabin he was there. He insists on buying the food every year and he buys the cheapest he can find and I think he lies to us about how much it cost and stiffs us on the food. We have been putting up with this for years and we need some suggestions on how to dump this bum."
539157,Guest,2004-04-28 10:47:00,0,"We have been fortunate not to have this problem, but this comes to mind... 1. If he was already at camp, did the owners let him in? 2. Is he someone you hang around with the rest of the year? 3. Will it be a loss if you cut ties with this guy completely? 4. Same week...go somewhere else? or different week same place? 5. If you don't like the food he bought, why does your group let him still buy it? Sounds like more issues in your group than just this...."
539158,Guest,2004-04-28 10:47:00,0,"Well, I'd go with honesty as the first route. Just tell him that his presence and demeanor diminishes the enjoyment of the trip for others and that, as a group, you don't want him there anymore. If you don't want to do that, invite someone else to ""take his place"" and let him know that he was the one to go...kind of like getting booted on one of those reality TV shows. The Canada trip is far too important to have a 'wet blanket' around. And if you take the time to travel, spend money, prepare, plan the trip...etc. you should be able to completely enjoy the trip. We had a similar situation several years ago, and just simply did not invite the person anymore. We're still friends back home, but we explained to hiim that his personality in that environment was too much. He understood. I hope this helps."
539159,AL,2004-04-28 11:41:00,89,"This is not an easy task. I agree with T-Bones suggestion. I had to eliminate a regular from our trip this year due to ""attitude"" problems and from the best I can tell this has ended our friendship. I look forward to this trip the entire year and it is difficult when one person does the complaining. Good Luck!"
539161,Hawker,2004-04-28 11:50:00,3967,"Mike: I'm pretty much in agreement with T-Bone that honesty is the best policy. I'd simply tell the guy as a group that because of his past behavior that you have decided to replace him with someone else this year. Kinda been there done that with a fella in our old group. Once we let him know he was out and someone else was in and the reasons why he was not welcome with us on that trip anymore sure changed him. He ended up going with another group one time and they un-invited him as well for the following year. Nice guy and all at home / work, but a changed man on fishing trips. Don't go through another year with this guy, end it now and get someone to replace him. Hawker"
539170,Guest,2004-04-28 15:45:00,0,"Had one like that with us. It broke up our trip. He was a slob, a cheapskate and lied. We had a kitty for expenses and he was always owing the kitty, on top of everything else. We pretty well quit going because of him, because we have to deal with him the rest of the year, too. But, we all have a lifetime of amazing slob and cheapskate stories to tell about stuff he did. So that is some consolation."
539172,rebelrn2001,2004-04-28 16:48:00,1563,Print this post and its contents and send it to him in the mail signed by everyone in the group. He won't be there when you get there....if he is call the police first and have them enter the cabin ahead of you. LOL
539173,Ivy,2004-04-28 17:11:00,556,"Yeah, you could confront him. But how about being a little more creative. How about planting some Plans for a Nuclear Weapon ( I believe you can get this from the internet )in his basment and calling the Dept. of Homeland Security. They detain him for the Summer and you head off to Canada for the 3-months, with out a care in the world. You come back from Canada feeling great. Your buddy, by this time is looking for anyone that could save him. Sooo you call Homeland Security and tell them it was just a silly prank. Everyone has a good laugh and problem solved. But here is the good part. After a while your buddy starts to think about the Summer he spent in solitary and gets some hard feelings. And HE dumps you guys. Not bad huh? Ivy"
539175,Guest,2004-04-28 19:19:00,0,"Yup, be honest and up front and tell him he is not wanted. Then call the camp owner, tell the owner what is going on, and make sure the camp will not tell your ""buddy"" whether you will be in Canada at all. Not fun. But better than not going."
539176,Guest,2004-04-28 19:32:00,0,"I unfortunately had to deal with this issue one year. I had gone on a trip with this person before and we had a great time. Then we have a good size group on another trip and he just starts causing problems. He is an alright fisherman but all of a sudden becomes the expert and of course the advice he is giving is all wrong. He starts to wreck the trip for the people he is fishing with and of course I get dragged into the middle of it all. There are huge fights and he starts threatening to ruin the trip for everyone. You can imagine how much fun this trip is turning out since I was one of the orgainzers. This is my only vacation I get during the year and am lucky my wife allows me to go on it since its expensive and she doesn't get a vacation like this. So we pretty much didn't talk about a future trip and avioded the subject at all costs around him. Future trips have been nice, peaceful, fun and I really look forward to them again. Wingmann"
