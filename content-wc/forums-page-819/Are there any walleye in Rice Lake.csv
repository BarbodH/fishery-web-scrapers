About the only place I ever had success was the channel that leads to Hastings. I've heard that the population is down because of the netting in the spring. I enjoy Rice Lake and it's tranquility, but I figured why go back when I can catch walleye from Lake Erie. Please help an average fisherman find a few walleye holes so I can enjoy the peace and quiet of this wonderful Lake. I appreciate any help I can get."
