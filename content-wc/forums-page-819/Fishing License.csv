539314,Guest,2004-05-05 09:32:00,0,Thanks for the idea but this trip just came up at the last minute so I am driving up tonight. I would like be able to fish right away tomorrow morning rather than wait to purchase a license.
539321,Guest,2004-05-05 12:54:00,0,When does the fishing season for walleye open in the Thunder Bay area? I was under the impression it opens 5/22 am I wrong?

539332,Larry S,2004-05-05 16:47:00,666,"Yellowlab,Picked up friends at the Thunder Bay airport last year,took them to Canadian Tire Store where they bought licenses. Not sure where it is,you can access mahumba's site listed under walleye links to find out. Larry S"
