Never fished Sherlock lake, but the cabins are coozy and the boats and motors are all in good shape. I would recomend Silver coloured spoons and anything flashy for the pike, for the walleye the usual suspects worked. All in all I was very happy with his service. I am actually flying with his brother this year (Air Ivanhoe), due to JTair closes his camps the last 2 weeks of July, and that is when my Vacation is. Have fun. Tight Lines pikey man"

If you are on your first trip to Canada, you might enjoy reading the ""planner"" that another outfitter provides for his guests. The planner offers a lot of sound advice. Good luck with your trip!!!http://www.slatefallsoutposts.com/planner/index.html"

I went into Sahler lake last week of August, and not a lot of bugs at all, hardly any mosqitoes and definately no black flies or horse or deer flies. tight lines pikey man"
539296,Guest,2004-05-04 11:59:00,0,"How was the fishing for you there. The water will still be cold when were there, going to try some stick baits and the spoons.The outfitter said to use jigs for the walleye.What did you use?"
539298,Guest,2004-05-04 13:26:00,0,"Depending on when you go, the water should be cold. Except if you are there in later july early august, it does warm up. Yes Jigs and minnows work. Also jigs and plastics work as well. In Sahler lake we had a tuff time finding them, but when did jigs and minnows were the key. At Biggs lake crankbaits then jigs were the choice of the walleye there, silver and Black raps were the key Tight Lines pikeyman"
