I've done drive ins and they called me walmart cause I had everything.Never having done a fly in, any help will be appreciated! thanx jim"
539238,Guest,2004-04-30 13:11:00,0,"For our fly-in right after Labor day, we go with 1 lb. of leeches/man + an extra pound just in case + a half to a full flat of crawlers."

Anyway - Blakemore Roadrunner jigs (look like a normal jig with a little spinner on the back of the head) tipped with powerbait grubs (3"") were the ticket. We caught as many with these as we did with minnows or crawlers and it's a lot less fuss/mess. Bring plenty of the powerbait grubs as they will get chewed up. Chartreuse was #1, White #2. Pink was hot off and on. Scott"
539241,AL,2004-04-30 14:21:00,89,I agree with this post. Power Grubs or similar brands is all we fish with on Canadian Fly-Ins. We leave two weeks from today and we are once again not taking any live bait. Most of our live bait was wasted in the past and we couldn't tell any real difference in size or quantity.
539271,jigman 2003,2004-05-03 06:14:00,981,"Pretty sure the guy is asking for artificials, not how many lbs. of live bait to take. Roadrunner jigs, regular jigs (darn pike sure like those flashy blades on the roadrunners)in weights from 1/16 to 3/8 oz. along with LOTS of powertails, regular 2""-4"" plastic twister tails, some of the new GULP bait and artificial(power bait, GULP, YUM, etc.) crawlers. The crawlers to be used on the spinner rigs and 1/2 oz. to 2 oz. bottom walkers you will be taking. To round it out a big handful of shallow, mid-range, and deep diving crank baits in your favorite colors. Maybe a few spoons if you have room. Works for me year after year. Good luck."
