The fishing was unbelievable at the right time and spots. Huge walleye over 11+ #'s, and northern over 20#'s. Unfortunately, with each passing year, the place got busier and busier. It is right next to a major highway, and a lot of Quebecans vacation there. The spots that we had close to the camp started to get fished out. There's miles and miles of water, we just had to explore, sometimes running over 20 miles to spots. It paid off, the more remote the water the better the fishing. Trolling is also a great way to learn a lake and find new spots."
