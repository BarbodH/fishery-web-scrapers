What type of structure or areas do you typically fish? I am not looking for exact locations but just general type areas to look for. (creek inlets, points, sand or mud) We are going out of the NW Angle but fishing in Canada. Any help would be appreciated"

The best producing areas for me were creek inlets and their adjacent areas, chutes between islands near flats and, if the weaather is uncooperative, deep water points. We used to slow troll spinner rigs along the shoreline near the creeks in 5-6 feet of water and pick up a lot of walleyes."

Good walleye action, northern and smallmouth with the occasional muskie by accident. I understand the resort has been sold. I have always (for 50 years) fished the summers out of Nestor Falls. I now live there 4 months each year. Mostly a muskie fisherman, but love to eat walleye. Hope you have a good trip."
