Perhaps some clarification would help. Regular gas (unleaded) here in Ottawa, Ontario sells for about 85 cents Cdn per litre at the pump. One imperial gallon (4.546 litres) would cost $3.86 Cdn or $2.82 US at todays exchange rate of 1 USD = 1.37 Cdn dollars. Similarly, one US gallon (3.785 litres) would cost $3.22 Cdn or $2.35 US. And last year, the Cdn dollar was no where near the exchange rate it enjoys now against the US dollar. Consequently, if you bought gas at a Canadian gas station pump and paid with your credit card, there's no way you would have legally paid $4.50 US per imperial gallon. However, if you bought gas at the outfitter location, many outfitters last year were charging $30 Cdn for 5 imperial gallons (cost at the pump at 85 cents per litre would have been $19.32 Cdn). Five imperial gallons at $30 Cdn equates to $21.89 US or about $4.38 US per imperial gallon. So if you talking about buying gas at the outfitters, then its quite possible that you paid $4.50 US for an imperial gallon (equates to $3.64 US for a US gallon). Its highly unlikely that outfitters would provide gas at pump prices."

539340,Guest,2004-05-06 11:13:00,0,"Thanks for that information, it will come in handy. With all the travel I have done down to Mexico and the Carribean, I should have known better to use my Credit Card. Next time, I will. The place we used was on the corner of HWY 664 and HWY 72 (I am pretty sure that was where it was). Anyway, it was two younger girls that ran the joint, one had to have been a junior in High School - I am sure they weren't honing up on their algebra when charging us for gas. Gas was about $4.50 US per Gallon and probably $6.00 US for a 4 pack of AAA batteries..."
539348,Guest,2004-05-06 20:12:00,0,Buy it all in Canada. The gas is better there anyways. I find it hard to believe that someone would pull a bomb behind them. The cost of gas between the U.S. and Canada is not much of an issue any more. Besides towing all that weight can't be good for your pet rig. Can't beat a cold CRYSTAL and a CUBAN cigar!!!!!!!!!
539288,Guest,2004-05-04 05:28:00,0,"I'm sure this has been asked before, but I can't seem to find it via ""search"", so would someone please help me. How much boat gas can you take across the border with you? Also, I need a link to the best Canadian government web site which answers this and all other border questions? Thanks, Mike (only 17 more days) Gretz"
539290,FREIGHT,2004-05-04 06:09:00,6,I DONT THINK THERE IS A LIMIT...WE TAKE OVER AS MUCH AS WE WANT AND ARE NEVER ASKED HOW MUCH WE HAVE .
539292,retire55,2004-05-04 07:12:00,1029,MGretz: The Canadian government organization responsible is the Canada Border Services Agency. Their site for information for visitors to Canada is http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/E/pub/cp/.../rc4161-e.html I'm unfamiliar with the amount of outboard motor gasoline you are allowed. You can telephone the Automated Custom Information Services folks at 204-983-3500 or 506-636-5064 (neither number is toll free).
539295,Reels,2004-05-04 11:54:00,2876,"Back before NAFTA you could only bring as much as your boat held. Since then, they have lifted the limits. <{{}}><"
539300,Guest,2004-05-04 13:50:00,0,"It depends on which agent checks you at the border. Each has their own pet area of concern. Whether they are up to speed and 100% correct on the rules or not, really doesn't matter, because aguing with them is something you do NOT want to do. You will never win. Ever."
539301,FlyBoy,2004-05-04 16:02:00,631,"We've been told a ""reasonable"" amount. I take (6) 6 gallon cans with me in the back of the boat in plain view, and they never say a word. -John"
539304,Guest,2004-05-04 19:22:00,0,"Out of the last 6 times I crossed at the Soo, I was asked how much extra gas I had 3 times. All 6 times I had 3 extra 6 gallon cans with. When I told them how much I had you could see the cash register working in their heads. and then they finally said OK after a long pause. So to answer your question it appears that 18 extra gallons is Ok (who knows for sure). One time four years ago we went up with two boats and put all extra gas inside of one boat in plain view. The driver of that truck forgot he had the gas and when they asked him he said he didn't have any extra with him. He had to change his shorts when he remembered later that he had all the extra gas."
539313,retire55,2004-05-05 09:30:00,1029,"I researched this topic a little further today by telephoning the Automated Customs Information Services. The news is not good. Legally speaking, when a visitor brings his boat and motor into Canada, only the gasoline in his boat gas tank is allowed into Canada duty and tax exempt. However, most port authorities, as a rule of thumb, will also allow one (1) extra 5 gallon container of gasoline into Canada duty and tax exempt. The duty and taxes payable on any gasoline over the one extra 5 gallon container varies, depending upon the province entered, but is approximately $2 US per 5 US gallons. I requested a web reference for this information but unfortunately one does not exist. The only way to obtain such information is to call the Automated Customs Information Services at 204-983-3500 or 506-636-5064 (neither number is toll free).

539320,Guest,2004-05-05 12:12:00,0,Isn't a bit dangerous to be hauling all that extra gas around? I'm surprized the camp owners allow it.
539324,Guest,2004-05-05 12:58:00,0,"I don't think its all that dangerous if it is properly packed and transported. I will be brining all my gas with me this year, filling up pre-International Falls. Last year, the ladies at the gas station near Sioux Falls charged us nearly $4.50 per gallon U.S.. Screw that...."
