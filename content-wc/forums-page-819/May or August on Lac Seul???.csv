539052,Opie,2004-04-22 06:12:00,129,"I need a little advice from some of you regulars that go to Lac Seul. My wife and I are planning our first Canadian fishing trip and have decided on Lac Seul. We originally thought about going in June, but it is very hard to get reservations at this late of a time. July is out as my wife's work schedule is just too hectic that whole month. There are some openings for later in May (a week or two after opener) or we are looking at August. We primarily fish for walleye and my wife has never been on a ""hot walleye bite"" - somewhere that 100+ fish a day is not uncommon. Both of us are decent sticks as I am a tourny angler and she has also been my partner in a few events. We both love to jig fish and she is getting into trolling cranks and spinners. In your opinion, which would be better fishing, late May or August? Also, which end of the lake do you recommend, the East or West end? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks, Dean Thorn"
539054,Guest,2004-04-22 11:01:00,0,"The lake is terrific, and you can do great both seasons. As you would guess, August is going to be better for big fish, than May, because depending on the year, in mid-May the LS females may still be in spawn mode or in immediate post-spawn, which means they are just tougher to bite. May is a terrific time for numbers and remeber in LS, numbers fish are still very, very nice walleye's. Some days is hard to catch fish for shore lunch because what you catch is the slot (nice problem to have). Finally, the bites are definately different. May to middle June is shallow water bite, with pitch jigs, trolled spinners and cranks in 3 - 10 feet of water (for the most part). In August, you will be in 25 - 40 feet most of the time (sometimes shallower on windy days) working sand flats and breaks. Presentations are the same, but a lot more bottom bouncing to find aggressive fish. In spring, the odds good of getting a nice pike or two, along with some bass, but in August the big pike go nomadic and are harder to find. The bass also seem to get tougher in late summer than in spring. As to east or west, I cannot answer as I fish the middle, which is nice because very few resorts and hardly any boats. The middle lacks the muskies (virtually none) and has a smaller (but growing) bass population. So, perhaps my answers above are tainted by my experience being based only on the middle part of the lack. I have fished Eagle Lake which is about an hour south of LS for spring, summer and fall, and I would say the two are about the same in terms of style of fishing, but in my opinion, LS has the better walleye fishing. Eagle is fine too, but I just like LS better."
539066,hawkeye,2004-04-22 20:30:00,112,"I have fished out of Sioux Lookout 28yrs two times a year, late June, July,Agust,up to Sept 16. Favorite is last week in june. I feel rest of of time may be just as good. Don't get me wrong the fishing can be great anytime,But a huge number of walleye migrate up beyond Chamberland Narrows into four rivers and spawn up there in the spring. Some years on a late spawn they don't get down to Bear Narrows, a large feeding flat untill the middle of June and they may be a little weird up to 2 weeks after spawn. I like to fish Bear Narrows, and anywhere up to 10miles south of Bear Narrow and East and West,Or any where North of Manitou Rapids. I fly into some lakes that aren't any better for bass and walleye and I like to fish out of my boat. Its a big lake. It took us old timmers years to find our way up North where I feel the best fishing is. But with a GPS showing land features you can go out a long way and find your way home or follow some one. Be sure to cast Bass lures into rocky shore lines you'll also catch a lot of Northern and Walleyes. A little pricey but Anderson Camp furnishs all meals, experienced guides.you will learn the lake and pick up fishing experiene that other wise may take years"
539068,hawkeye,2004-04-22 20:42:00,112,"PS. For you I would vote for a August trip. Fishing is bound to be good. Warm and less chanch of cold rain to make momma happy,if momma ain't happy,nobody happy."
539079,Guest,2004-04-23 12:20:00,0,August my man....The days will be nicer and your Resort Owner will put you on fish. Lac Seul is such a Walleye Factory that anybody who can read a map and get their bait to the bottom can catch fish. You will have a great time. Just study up on August patterns by getting some WC posts out there. Good Luck
539110,Guest,2004-04-26 11:19:00,0,"I haven't fished the East end but I have been fishing the west end for about 16 years. Give August a try. It's a little better weather and you can catch them any way you want. If you want to jig or troll, it doesn't matter. It's easy to navigate also. (most of the time)."
539111,Guest,2004-04-26 11:22:00,0,ps. I just realized you had the choice of May. The weather is a little unpredictable but the fishing is outstanding. You may need a vacation to recover from the fishing.
539183,2 DOGS,2004-04-28 22:08:00,361,"If you're taking your wife go in August, much better weather, by August the black flies have pretty well had their fill. Spend the bucks and hire a guide for a day or two and show her a real good time, then chances of her going again are much better, plus you'll get to learn part of the lake and a few of the hazards. I think the east side has more smallies and muskie than the west. Most everybody is able to catch some nice walleye."
539338,Guest,2004-05-06 09:52:00,0,"I have never fished in June, but we have been going to Lac Seul in August for the last 9 years and the weather is usually pretty nice and we have always caught tons of Walleyes. We have never been dissappointed with the number or the size of the fish that we have caught. We have fished both sides of the lake and prefer the west side. We go out of one of the resorts just south of Ear Falls and fish by Stoney Point, Manitoba Point and all areas around there. We sometimes go into Broad Lake and Sun Light lake. I have friends that have fished in June and they have always said that the weather is very unpredictable sometimes they even wear their winter bibs. We have had rain in august and its been a little chilly before but never had to put on winter coats."
