538971,Guest,2004-04-19 08:42:00,0,I wish we had a the same regulations as L.S. this is the only way to mantain a fishery as far as I'm concerned. The camp owner on Gullrock put thier own slot limit in. ( no walleye over 18in. & no northern over 351/2in. can be eaten they can only be kept as a trophy for mounting only) By doing this it's still pretty easy to get those 25-100 fish a day. You can use livewell on Gullrock.
538977,2 DOGS,2004-04-19 10:34:00,361,"I've talked to a number of people who raved about the fishing on Gullrock and not a single one complained about any restrictions. Evidently the camps are doing a good job of explaining it's a limited resource, just too bad the MNR won't give some assistance. It doesn't appear that it's stopped people from fishing."
538933,Guest,2004-04-17 18:06:00,0,Can anybody tell me the Walleye slot size for this year?
538936,Larry S,2004-04-17 19:42:00,666,Straight from the 2004 Ontario Fishing regulations. Slot size for walleye on Lac Seul 0 between 46 and 53cm (18.1--20.8in) and only (1) greater than 53cm(20.8in)
538938,Guest,2004-04-17 19:53:00,0,"So very true, Larry. If only it read 0 over 46cm."
538943,Guest,2004-04-17 21:46:00,0,Fishin Bum: You'd get my vote on that suggestion.
538946,Guest,2004-04-18 07:25:00,0,Just wondering do you L.S. groupies think that having a slot size on Lac Seul has help for fish size and numbers.
538947,Guest,2004-04-18 08:00:00,0,"We've been fishing Lac Seul for a dozen years or so. They've had the slot limits on for most of that time, and over the last 5 years or so the fishing has greatly improved. It could be that we've just learned the lake and have adapted to fishing there, but the surveys by the Ministry have shown that the numbers and size of walleye has improved over that time. I've definitely seen an improvement - just need to find more of those 17 1/2 inchers!"
538949,Guest,2004-04-18 09:12:00,0,"Answer: Absolutely!!! Though the management intention of the slot limit was designed to increase and/or maintain numbers of fish in the population by protecting a size class of fish which can produce the largest # of viable eggs, it also has the additional benefit of protecting a portion of the population as it grows to trophy proportions. My educational background was in fisheries biology and I currently own and operate a lodge on Lac Seul. My operation has a camp policy which prohibits the harvest of any species above the slot limit and my guests fully support this policy because we take the time to explain the rationale and science behind it. Though I may not agree with every MNR policy and management decision, I do agree that the vibrant trophy walleye population on Lac Seul is a direct result of management policies enacted by the MNR including the closing of commercial fishing targeting walleye and the slot size limit. I would strongly support any regulation change that would protect more of the larger individual fish in the population, be it a wider slot going up to 24 or 28 inches, or simply a regulation that only allows harvest of fish under the slot. Based on current response from the MNR, I doubt that any of these policies will be adopted in the short term. In the meantime, I would suggest that we continue to lead by example and carefully release walleyes over slot size. I thank those conservation minded anglers who have done so in the past, as they are also directly responsible the strength of Lac Seul's walleye fishery. Though it may not be considered for policy at this time, I hope that in the future that anglers (resident and nonresident), fishery managers, lodge owners, and local municipalities consider the overall benefit of a ""trophy fishery management policy"" for some bodies of water. In my view, it is a scenario where all parties involved can ""win."" Anglers who enjoy the opportunity to fish for quantity as well as quality will seek out and return to that quality fishery time and again. The overall health of the fishery will be improved and more closely resemble the balance and dynamic of a system before angling. Lodge owners benefit from consistently returning business. And the local community benefits from generation of tax revenue and the spin off from added business. Yes there are some potential bioligical concerns that would require monitoring, but overall I see this as one of the few shared resource opportunities where all parties involved can benefit and yet it decreases our overall impact on that natural resource. Regardless of policy change, we will continue to do our part to carefully release adult walleye, continue to educate our guests and the public, and to enjoy Lac Seul's awesome walleye fishery.

538952,Guest,2004-04-18 11:28:00,0,"This will be my 21st year to Lac Seul. YES It has made a difference by having a slot size! When we first started coming up it was a big deal getting one or two walleyes in the 6 or 7 lbs range within a week. Now its typical to get 4-10 or more. I would love to see the slot limit to change to only one walleye over 28"". Where else can you get 25-100 walleyes a day on a consistant basis? The thing that has gone down hill though is the number of big Northerns we use to catch. Hopefully the slot on them will soon help the numbers of those too."
538958,2 DOGS,2004-04-18 17:07:00,361,"Bud: Are there any size restictions in place on Gullrock? Plus, you can keep live fish if I recall."
538966,Guest,2004-04-19 06:05:00,0,"I agree with the lousy northern fishing, it would be fun to catch and release big ones. I have been going to Lac Seul since 1981 and the Northern fishing has gone down hill since. I like walleyes better anyway. I would like to see the slot size change a bit. I would like to be able to keep anything up to 20"", but not be able to keep anything over 20"". All the good eaters are up to 20"" and sometimes during the opener all we catch are fish in the slot. The only way I would keep a fish over the slot if it was a near record for mounting on the wall; they don't taste that great when they are that big. Good luck on the 15th!!! Mark"
