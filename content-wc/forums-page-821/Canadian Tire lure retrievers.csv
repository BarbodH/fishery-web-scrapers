539034,Guest,2004-04-21 08:39:00,0,"Yeah....I saw them too. What you do is, tie a line to the back of the thing. Use a thin (but very strong) line....like a nylon surveyors line. Next, take the thing, and slide it on your line (which is apparently snagged). Let her go....the lead thing will zoom down your line and either bump the snag loose or accually attach itself to your 'lost' lure. When it has hold, pull your nylon line to dislodge the hook. Now, I'm not sure who uses these things, but as far as I can tell, they would mostly be used for WOOD snags. I can't see this thing getting my tube jig out when snagged up in the Canadian Shield. A wedged jig is likely gone unless a diver goes in to get it. -J"
