538956,Guest,2004-04-18 15:52:00,0,Going up to Totem for the opener. What is Bob's last name? Our regular guide won't be up there until June. The service up there is incredible. Good Luck this year.

538961,Guest,2004-04-18 19:34:00,0,"You must have. He did have 4 other offers & he chose Totem. I do know he was offered also a chance to produce a radio program here in Winnipeg, and he still took the gig at Totem. To get him out of Minaki is amazing ! WrD"
538989,River_eye,2004-04-19 18:04:00,1486,who's your regular guide?
538995,Guest,2004-04-19 19:12:00,0,"E, our regular guide was Byron, missed him last year and had the famous Bortgo. Also on my list was Shawn or Dean. I heard Byron was going part time, so gave Bonnie my top three other guides if he can't make it up for us. The guides up there have been great. See you on the 15th!! Hope the ice is out."
538998,River_eye,2004-04-19 21:23:00,1486,"Byron was one of my favourite guys out there last year and I learned a lot from him and we became friends. I lived with Borgo for the first little while, he's a character that guy. I got a lot of days last year as a first year guide on the lake, but my previous 5 years experience on the winnipeg river helped me out a lot. Look up my boat number and say hi when you come. I'm sure the ice will be out by then."
