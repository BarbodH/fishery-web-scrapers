I have flown with him before in '96, but that was to a different lake. I will be going up the last week of July, so was wondering what worked the best for the Walleyes in terms of lures and colours...and if you have the depths that you were finding that would be great.

They are strict, but run a very good operation. Regarding McConnel lake - I talked with one guy who went there when I was talking with Jim at one of the shows. They used crawler harnesses and bottom bouncers to find the walleyes or honey holes. Then later sit on top and jigged for them. Use 5/8 or 3/4 oz bottom bouncers with gold, chart, or various white blades in size #3 or #4. They used 1/4 oz jigheads but I would make sure to bring some 3/8 oz size. He didn't mention if he used minnows or curly tails or jig head color."
539005,Guest,2004-04-20 09:41:00,0,Thanks for the info. I have read and posted on the fourm site. Just seeing if anyone who lurks around here had any additional info. Will definately use the harness. Tight Lines Pikey Man
