Duck Bay Lodge has a great reputation with excellent service, quality boats and good guides. Obabkion (sorry for the spelling) also has great accomidations, good service and fishing but the owner could be a little more service oriented. Mylies place is also a good place to stay. If you are up by Kenora check out Witchbay Camp. They have excellent service, food, boats, fishing and fishing pros on staff that will put you on fish."
539046,rpieske,2004-04-21 19:15:00,1276,I have visited the Duck Bay Camp a couple of times. The folks who I know that stay there come back year after year. It is also well located for fishing muskies. Water access only.
538979,Guest,2004-04-19 11:08:00,0,Haven't been to Canada on a fishing vacation and this place looked pretty nice. Any suggestions on a nice drive to place would be greatly appreciated. Trying to avoid the tourist areas where i feel like i'm a disney world rather than a fishing trip in Canada with less people around.
538983,rpieske,2004-04-19 15:20:00,1276,"I have never stayed at LeCuyer's but I live down the road from their resort. I have walked the grounds and met the folks. It all seems pretty decent. They are certainly on some of the best muskie fishing waters on LOTW. If walleyes are your game, them you would probably do better at one of the island lodges like Miles Bay Camp or Rex Tolton's Obabikong Lodge. They are in the prime walleye areas in that part of LOTW. That doesn't mean that you can't catch really nice walleyes out of LeCuyer's. Dogtooth Lake is another excellent walleye lake just north of Sioux Narrows. Of course there are numerous good walleye areas in Whitefish Bay out of Sioux Narrows. All that being said, I don't think you would be disappointed with LeCuyer's."
538992,Guest,2004-04-19 18:38:00,0,"I HAVE stayed at LeCuyers Lodge and was not at all impressed! I usually go to Obabikon Bay Lodge out of Morson but that particular fall, our group decided to give LeCuyers a try as I was promised great fishing and they were promised more ducks. Well, the food was great but I get pretty good food here at home. The service was non-exsistant. I had one fishing guide who told me during the summer, they always would run all the way over to Miles Bay to fish. Miles bay is in the obabikon bay back yard. The facility is decent and the equipment is ok but the owner is a first class BS'ER. I think you can do better!"
538996,rpieske,2004-04-19 19:23:00,1276,"I agree that Obabilong Bay Lodge is well placed for catching walleyes and crappie. Sorry to hear that about LeCuyer's. That resort has a long family tradition. Personality means everything in that business. It won't take long to ruin the camp if the patrons don't like the owner. Rex Tolton who owned Miles Bay Camp died this past year. But the family is still operating the camp and I am sure the service will remain good. You have to ask yourself, ""Why would I run 30 miles each way from Nestor Falls to Miles Bay to catch my walleye?"" You might as well stay there in Miles Bay."
539001,PJM,2004-04-19 23:08:00,3516,"FOOTDOC 1 I met the guy who owns the Obabikon resort at a boat show and also had a friend who stayed there and he said that guys is not to friendly but maybe he is burned out by October. His resort is in a nice location for fall crappie fishing but I don't think he too in tune with fall Walleye fishing. I myself go up to LOTW with a large group the first week end of October and the fishing is very good. I have done it for several years, and for some reason every year someone catches a large muskie fishing for crappies or walleyes. So the fishing is unpredictable................."
539016,rpieske,2004-04-20 16:05:00,1276,You've got that burn out thing right. I don't know how they handle it for those months. Some people can really be a pain and the effect is cumulative. Crappies are always biting at Obabikong Bay Lodge.
539018,Guest,2004-04-20 16:18:00,0,we always stay a Canadian Haven at Nestor Falls.They are great people and bend over backwards to make your trip a perfect Canadian vaction.The walleye fishing is excellent with in a short distance of the camp.
539021,bronzeback77,2004-04-20 18:17:00,97,"I stay at White Pine Lodge in Sioux Narrows and would not consider going anywhere else. Great fishing, great owners, great equipment. All around awesome place, I could not recommend any place any more highly. If you want more info email me at [email protected]. As for LeCuyers Lodge, I have spoken with them at the boat show in St. Louis and they seem very nice but White Pine is the best for me."
539022,rpieske,2004-04-20 19:04:00,1276,I agree about Canadian Haven...nice folks who really make your trip a pleasure.
539029,Guest,2004-04-20 23:37:00,0,"I don't know much about the place, but I remember one fall (it was the weekend of Canadian Thanksgiving) about 5 years ago there was a guy staying there that was stranded out on a point somewhere on the lake. He didn't even know where he was because it was his first time up to LOW. Apparantly, someone is his group was deer hunting and they shot a deer so the guide and left this guy set up duck hunting and went to get a 4 wheeler or something to haul out this deer. The poor guy was out tehre with only a hand held radio and was barely transmitting to Morson where we were able to talk with him sporadically about what was going on. I was making phone calls to the office there with no luck and finally reached someone at the grocery store in Nestor that said they lived by the resort and would stop there on their way home to make sure they knew they had a guest on the lake. It was close to time for it to get dark and chilly and windy of course in the second week or October. Can't imagine that happening, but I was talking with the stranded guy myself. I doubt that guy or any of his friends will go near Nestor Falls again. I can never figure out why people want to run all that way to Miles and Burrow and Obakikon Bays to fish when there is about a dozen resorts on Morson. Oh well. It's nice being in the hidden jewel of LOW. Happy Spring all."
