Locals and guides really favour Lindy rigging for walleyes. In June, its usually up to the fish as what they want. I've had luck with minnows, leeches and crawlers. Email me directly if you want more specific info or I can hook you up with a guide/campowner who has lots of info. Are you staying at Godin's or LaBelles. -Davis"
