538911,Guest,2004-04-16 10:44:00,0,"Not sure about KM...but it's 120 miles, will take about 2-2 1/2 hours."
538918,rpieske,2004-04-16 14:16:00,1276,Approximately 210 Km. It will take at least 2 and 1/2 hours to drive. I live in Nestor Falls which is approx. half way there.
538926,Guest,2004-04-17 05:28:00,0,"1 hr. to Nestor, 30 mins. to Sioux Narrows, 45 minutes to Kenora= 1.5 hrs or 2 max."
538986,rpieske,2004-04-19 15:38:00,1276,">1 hr. to Nestor, 30 mins. to Sioux Narrows, 45 minutes to >Kenora= 1.5 hrs or 2 max. I guess I drive slower than you. Especially in the summer when the traffic is bad on the weekends. I usually wind up behind a truck and trailer doing about 60 km/hr. I guess I need to speed up! The real problem is crossing the bridge from International Falls to Fort Frances. That can take hours if it is on a busy weekend. But your times are right from Ft. Frances to Kenora, but probably a little short when having to go through customs at the bridge."

539015,rpieske,2004-04-20 16:02:00,1276,You must be the engineer. You actually did the math! Thanks for putting all straight.
539017,Reels,2004-04-20 16:14:00,2876,What is that in Metric? <{{}}><
