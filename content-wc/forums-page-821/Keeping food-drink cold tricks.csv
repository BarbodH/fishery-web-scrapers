538414,Guest,2004-03-23 13:32:00,0,Make sure all meat is frozen and pack it in one cooler and only go into that cooler when you need to get meat out. Plan what meat you are going to need first and pack it at the top accordingly. Most importantly open and close lid quickly and only when you have to. Don't be like the kids hanging onto the fridge door looking in to see what will be their next morsel. Pack your other less perishable food in another cooler like drinks.

Good Luck. > > JT, I just couldn't help jumping in here. Ice can go from just below freezing temperature to as cold as you can get the freezer. At -20 degrees, ice is also -20 degrees. If the ice has salt in it, it's temperature will also be -20 degrees. The only thing that changes when you add salt to water will be the fact that it will solidify at a lower temperature. So instead of ice at 32F (0 Celsius) you will have cold salty water at 32F. At 28F you will have ice at 28F in one hand and cold salty water on the verge of solidifying at 28F in the other hand. So, adding salt to water or not adding salt to water only affects when that water will solidify."
538424,Guest,2004-03-23 18:41:00,0,"On the salt idea, your ice will melt alot faster with the salt. The salt will lower the freezing point of the ice, causing it to melt. It will however pull heat from your beverages more quickly, so if you have warm drinks that you want to make cold put them in ice and add salt to the ice. We have frozen kegs at parties doing this. Kind of neat the first time we did it, but not after we had to drink slushy beer, and it takes five minutes to get one through the tap."
538450,phern,2004-03-25 12:42:00,151,"Yes....water does have a better contact to the bottle than a block of ice. With that in mind, having very cold salty ice water will cool bottles of beer quicker. Where I live in Quebec, keeping beer and softdrinks cool is not much of a problem. Snow is readily available until the end of june where I fish and camp. Ice can be found under the moss in mid-july. The lakes usually warm up to a maximum of bout 65 degrees at the surface. I have seen snow fall in all of the summer months. Blocks of ice usually last 5 days in the inexpensive coolers. If the question of keeping something cool is crucial, well nothing beats dry ice. With a couple of blocks of dry ice in one cooler that is rarely opened, you can even re-freeze the water in the containers originally containing ice and you can freeze your fish if you want."
538456,DaveIN,2004-03-26 06:41:00,191,I thought it interesting that no one mentioned to keep a wet towel or piece of carpet laying over the top of the cooler. Another trick is several layers of wet newspaper right under the lid in the cooler. Been there done that and both work.
538463,Guest,2004-03-27 04:57:00,0,"Phern, sounds like you may have tried the salt experiment. One of the articles I read mentioned that the reason the salt was effective was that at a freezing point of -20F the salt water is too dense to allow for convection currents. Warm water cannot rise to the surface as the salt water begins to melt. In fresh water, the ice would float to the surface and be surrounded by the warmest water in the container while the cold water is forced to the bottom. In the ice solution which is too dense for convection, the ice is surrounded by cold water, the melting process is considerably slowed. Is this a bunch of hogwash? I'm interested to hear from someone who has actually tried it before I waste my time on my next camping trip."
538477,lobo1,2004-03-27 23:14:00,734,One last little thing to add to all the other great suggestions is to cool your cooler before you load it with your cold/frozen items and your ice. Pre-chilled cooler can add one more day of cool. lobo1
539024,Guest,2004-04-20 19:24:00,0,"I have done the salt solution ice jugs and it works great. Keeps things colder, longer. Word of caution: do not put cans of pop or beer directly against the ice jugs, put a piece of cardboard or something between them. I have exploded pop cans in the cooler on a 90 degree July day."
539041,Guest,2004-04-21 15:35:00,0,"We have been able to keep ice for upwards of six days by freezing water in milk cartons, as someone suggested, and then lining the cooler with newspaper."
539061,Guest,2004-04-22 16:26:00,0,We will pack peat moss around the cooler and keep it moist. Works wonders. Adds a number of days to your set. we also pack an additional cooler with just ice. we freeze the meat ect beforehand. The new coolers are great and better than the old. Get good coolers with lots of insulation. Worth the extra dollars. The beverages are packed in a different cooler. Try and limit the open and close.
538373,Guest,2004-03-22 07:42:00,0,"Anyone know of any clever ways to keep your food/drinks cold for a week? We keep all our food and drinks in Coleman coolers for about a week, and stuff starts to get soggy and warm by weeks end. What worked good last year was gallon milk jugs filled with water and frozen - they tended to stay frozen for most of the trip. Bags of ice would be gone in a day. Thanks guys!"
538375,Reels,2004-03-22 08:33:00,2876,Dry Ice has worked well for us in the boundery waters. Not sure about a week though. <{{}}><

538384,Guest,2004-03-22 12:39:00,0,"What do you consider a ""good"" cooler"
538387,Stormsearch,2004-03-22 12:49:00,1392,"A coleman ""5 day @ 90F"" cooler. They are now other companies following suit and are coming in different sizes. They have extra insulation in the tops and sides so you lose internal space. I took a 58 qt. cooler on a trip last year which had 1 gallon water frozen and several frozen drinks that I used during the trip. Was gone 6 days and my 1 gallon jug still had ice. Anything that you can pre-freeze do so, mainly extra drinks. Those frozen drinks then go into my boat cooler bag (www.polarbearcoolers.com are great) that keeps my snacks, drinks good for the day. If you have the capability, having dry ice on hand is the way to go. We use the dry ice to make ice by placing plastic zip bags of water on top and let freeze overnight. But, you have to keep it well insulated also and make sure it is not used except for making ice. We have done this on 10 day trips and worked great. Problem is with weight, just hauling the stuff in."
538388,michric,2004-03-22 12:53:00,46,We have had good success using two coolers. One packed normal and the second one with a block of ice and the items. We make sure we eliminate air space with a bag of cubed ice and put a folded newspaper across the top. Seems like the lid is the weak link on some coolers. I think what helps though is that we don't get in and out of this cooler with any frequency.
538397,Guest,2004-03-22 16:37:00,0,"This may not apply to your needs, but I've got a great tip for canoe trippers or for anyone who doesn't have access to ice or refrigeration. When I'm in the bush in the summer and am craving a cold drink I simply sink my drink bottle in deep water (usually 30ft. on average). Once you get below the thermocline the water is COLD! Takes about 30-40mins. and your beverage of choice is ice cold! Works great. I usually use a mesh anchor bag weighted with a rock, with my drinking bottle along for the ride."
538400,retire55,2004-03-22 16:56:00,1029,"Wooglin: I'll assume your question relates to fishing in places without access to electricity or generators. You also didn't say what time of year you were asking about or how far north you fish. Depending on your answers, you might be able to take advantage of a couple of things. First choice would be to try to find ice still left over from winter. That might sound silly but there's usually some ice to be found even in late May if one knows where to look. Second might be ground frost. Many times during the second half of May, while tent camping in the ""outback"" on speckled trout trips, we'd dig a 2-3 foot deep hole close to a tree root to get close to the frost level. We could keep stuff very cold, almost freezing sometimes, during our 5 and 6 day trips. The further north one fishes, the later these methods can work. Anything to refrain from traveling over portages with coolers and blocks of ice."

538410,Guest,2004-03-23 09:59:00,0,"Thanks guys for all the tips. We camp at Country Camping, near Sioux Lookout and Hudson - there is electricity. Last year we brought a dorm fridge, which proved to be a waste of space for the little it could hold. We are going to try some chunks of dry ice this year, freeze as much as possibe (including all jugs of drinking water) as well as some gallon milk jugs too. Thanks again!"
