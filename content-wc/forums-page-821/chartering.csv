What I'd love to do at that point is to take a boat across the lake to Niagara on the lake. I will be alone with my bicycle. Is that a possibility? Of course I would pay for the trip. If you could help me locate any charter company etc. that would be awesome. I will be in Oshawa on Wednesday, May 5th. Thank you in advance. Here's hoping to miss Toronto Tim :)[email protected]"
