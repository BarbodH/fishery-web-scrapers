538950,Guest,2004-04-18 10:13:00,0,It does. And it is Ft. FrancEs. Don't know about the web site.
538951,Hammerhead Herb,2004-04-18 10:47:00,259,Try and contact someone on this website.http://www.fortfranceschamber.com/ It is the Chamber of Commerce in Fort Frances. They should be able to get you the phone number that you need. I use these people and the chamber folks at Dryden quite a bit.

539019,Matches,2004-04-20 16:31:00,236,"Me Too, I can't resist. Oakland California Banned Them, so what does that tell you? Critics accuse the company of leading a race to the bottom with low pay, by shifting the burden of health care to local taxpayers and by pushing small shops out of business. San Diego is considering a ban on mega-stores. Oakland, in northern California, has passed one. And plans for another store in the central town of Bakersfield are on hold because of a union-backed lawsuit. Here is link to the story.http://www.sundayherald.com/41211"
539023,rpieske,2004-04-20 19:08:00,1276,"You can't hold back the tide. Business changes, critics usually have an adgenda and progress continues. Not to say that WalMart is faultless, but using California as a basis for sound business planning is an oxymoron. Costco is probably doing it a little better with how they treat their employees, but don't believe ALL the bad stuff you hear about WalMart."
539026,Matches,2004-04-20 20:25:00,236,"It's been proven in countless communities throughout the U.S., Mega-Stores Rip the soul out of small towns. I hate to see that happen in Canada."
539036,rpieske,2004-04-21 12:12:00,1276,"I asked that same question about the effect Walmart would have on the small stores in Ft. Frances and was told by folks in the Fort that there really weren't that many small retailers left once you take away the specialty stores (tourist). For some communities, a store like Walmart may be a boon not a bust."
