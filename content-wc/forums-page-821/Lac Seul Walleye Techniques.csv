What kind of bait and presentation and what kind of structure. All help would be appreciated. Want to have the boys have a great trip. Thanks, Grandpa"
538978,Guest,2004-04-19 10:38:00,0,"Grandpa, How old and how experienced are your grandsons (i.e., can they work a jig)? In the first week of June, most of your walleye on L.S. will come from 6-12' of water, depending on water temperature, turbidity (wind), lake water levels, overall spring conditions, and recent weather. Working a jig this shallow is obviously easier than jigging in 20 to 30'. It is easier to detect bottom and the boat can move along at a decent speed. If conditions permit and the fish are active, jigging is the way to go early in the year (in my opinion). Now, if your grandsons are young or inexperienced, some type of bottom-running rig is probably your best bet. A bottom-bouncer and in-line spinner combination is the most obvious. Though it does require some care to not tangle while lowering the rig to the bottom, it should minimize hang ups. A keel weight or some other weight could replace the bottom bouncer. If you have extremely young children who have never fished, I suppose still fishing (bobber) is an option. The problem is that on Lac Seul, being so large with a widespread forage supply and having large structures holding fish, I find you really need to keep on the move. In my guiding experience, even if the walleye fishing is incredible, children will get bored. This is partly due to the nature of walleye fishing, and partly due to the simple fact that children have short attention spans. In such cases, even a brief stint of casting for pike will often re-energize children, if for no other reason than to simply change things up. This plan however, is contingent on the ability of all boat members to cast without taking someone's eye out. In short Grandpa, it is Lac Seul. Barring a major climatological anomoly or biological collapse, you will catch plenty of fish. I can pretty much guarantee you that, without even knowing you. NWO Fishing Bum"

Here brother started going to Canada when he was eight. Each year my kids go north with myself and their grandfather and its been a blast. My advice is definately to start out with bottom bouncers and spinners. You cover ground fast, find the aggresive fish (most are up there), they don't get hung up as often, pick up walleye, northern and bass, and are easier to fish initially. Lots depends on their age and how much they have fished before.. If they are as young as mine, then bring other things to do in the boat. My daughter will draw pictures for 40 minutes and then fish for another hour. My son took great pleasure in disecting a couple of perch every once in while and would also play with some toys the first year up. Now at 11, he will fish solid 80% of the day. The idea of casting for pike is great, but you will also get some nice walleye that way. My son caught a 30 1/4 inch walleye last year pitching a crankbait on a sand flat. I had told him only the pike would hit it, so now he is an expert and I have lost my standing. Its great to pass the mantel of smartest guy in the boat on to the 11-year old. Take a nice shore lunch break, look for bear and moose tracks and again, depending on the age, remember not to burn them out. Do it right and you have partner for life. Only other advice, if you can afford it, get a guide for the trip or for the first couple of days of it. We always have a guide and its worth the extra expense because they know the lake, they know what has been happening, and on Lac Seul with the water being down this coming year (like last year) they know where the lower unit eating rocks are. Better than that, they make the trip a lot of fun if you have a good one. If your going to be in the middle part of Lac Seul, that is where we will be. Best of luck, 7 weeks to go!.....IA Walleye"

539007,scar,2004-04-20 09:56:00,196,"grandpa, i have been able to take my son and other fathers with kids along with me to canada the last three years. he is 12 now and our trips have been extremely special. i fish on headwaters for lac seul(minnitaki) so the fishing should be similar. i have found the easiest way for the young kids we have brought with us is to fish with spinners while back trolling. we use northland 1 hook spinners and 1/2 a crawler with 3/8 oz. of wieght.this method is easier for young kids then using bottom bouncers or jigging as they don't snag often and a bite is real obvius. just throw it out and let it get about 20-30 yards behind the boat. if you are in water 6 - 12 feet deep it will be in the strike zone.most times the fish set the hook themselves and it is easy to keep crawlers alive.if you try this method you need to doctor the rig a little. what i mean is that when you buy the spinners(crawler harnasses) they are about 3 feet long and need to be shortened to about 20-22 inches as that seams to work best. just cut the swivel off the end and re-tie it to that length. once we really hit them (often) we will come back and jig that area as we already know there are many active fish in that area.the kids usually have no trouble jigging for and hooking active concentrated fish. this method also lets you cover lots of water. hope this helps. scar"
539020,Guest,2004-04-20 18:06:00,0,"NWO Fishing Bum, are you going to SWWL? If so, when will you be up there? My 11-year son is not going this year, he is goint to Australia for most of June as a student ambassador, so this year, its my daughter's turn to have time only with myself and her Grandfather. It will be interesting to see how she does. We took her for a week in Northern WI last year and she did great. With 7 weeks to go, is it too much too start counting the hours till another trip the best place on earth?.....IA Walleye"
