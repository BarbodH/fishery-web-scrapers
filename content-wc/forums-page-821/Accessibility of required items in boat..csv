538930,Guest,2004-04-17 08:49:00,0,"Hello matches. I just had the coast guard auxillary do their complimentary boat inspection on my 19 foot Lund IO and I would understand as long as you have them somewhere on the boat is the important thing. How important it is to you to be able get them is up to you. They require a number of things to get the inspection sticker. nav lights, flairs, life jackets, noise maker- preferably the canned air powered type after all if you need help do you want to save a buck or save your life and a number of other safety devices. A little lake maybe no big deal but on bigger water you are betting your life."
538963,PJM,2004-04-18 22:33:00,3516,Matches Do you even have storage compartments in your boat?
538975,Matches,2004-04-19 09:33:00,236,"PJM, I have 5! One in front and two on each side. Though I do have a question about my anchor. Do you think there is a minimum size? The one I have is small and I only have it to meet the requirement. I don't think it would hold the boat if the wind was more than 5mph. I also read that on a boat under 19 feet that you need either an anchor or a paddle, but not both. Does that sound right? Thanks"
538976,Stormsearch,2004-04-19 09:40:00,1392,Doesn't the Canadian Coast Guard also require a manual bailer and a paddle???
538981,Guest,2004-04-19 12:18:00,0,It is my understanding that you are required to have 2 paddles onboard. This came about several years back. Happy fishing.
