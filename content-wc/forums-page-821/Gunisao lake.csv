538893,Guest,2004-04-15 13:55:00,0,"Looking at Gunisao for a 2005 trip, but it almost looks too good to be true. I know it's not cheap, but most truly spectacular things in life are. Can you shed any light on the fishing, accommodations at Budd's...etc.? Thanks."
538908,Guest,2004-04-16 09:09:00,0,"Yup, still reading the board fairly often :). I'll send you an e-mail. T-bone, if you'd like some pictures of the accomodations I have a few pictures I could send you if you'd like of the cabins and the lodge. What I've heard from guests is that the accomodations are fair compared to other lodges in the same price range, but it's the fishing that really keeps them comming back. As for the fishing it's been really great the last two years. They have a web site, buddsgunisaolakelodge, and they have a list of the master anglers that could give you some idea. Spring is best for numbers and long fish, and summer for better average size and weight. Depends what you really want out of your experience.In spring you just have to keep catching fish until one of them is big, while in summer they are a bit less mixed. Spring is shallow fishing, 4'to 8' deep usually, lindy rigging, jigs, crankbaits too. Summer is 15' to 40' with jigs for the most part. Spring is the safer bet for your first trip for sure. Anything specific you'd like to know?"
538910,Guest,2004-04-16 10:10:00,0,"Thanks for the info MJS. I've got a brochure from Budd's and the accommodations seem meet our needs in those pictures. We're not too particular...it's the fishing we're after. From what I can see in Manitoba's Master Angler list, Gunisao has about 50% of the walleye MA awards for the whole province! That's something special. We love to jig fish and are quite good at it so I'd guess we head up in the summer. What do you consider ""summer""? July - August? What period in that timeframe would you consider to maximize both numbers AND size? I know that's asking a lot, sometimes a two-week difference makes all the difference. We really dislike the bugs (black flies mostly) too, so the May-June timeframe does not appeal to us either. I know that Budd's sends you out with a guide, and I've heard that most camps that do this do not include 'evening' fishing after dinner. Is that the case with Budds? Also, we're also considering Bolton Lake and Aikens Lake in Manitoba. Do you know anything about these lakes? We're leaning hard toward Gunisao though...the numbers speak for themselves. Thanks again."
538919,Guest,2004-04-16 14:29:00,0,"Actually, the bugs really aren't bad at all. I'm not sure why. I don't even bring bug spray anymore, but there are musquitos on shore sometimes. Yes, you get a guide for two people, and you can go out after supper. You just have to make the arrangements with your guide. You can fish jigs in the spring too. Kind of different to vertical fish in 6' of water, but it works. The advantage to spring is you fish a big complex bay 5 minutes from camp, but in the summer you have to head 20-40 minutes away. Summer is more fun for me since you have to hunt them. As for the best time, as you say it can be hard to nail down from year to year with the weather. The summer peak on the lake is what I think you'd like best. Early July maybe? Have talked to people who have fished Bolton. What I hear is that it has numbers of decent sized walleyes and bigger pike. Nobody raved about their laker fishing, but it is more of an option than at Gunisao. Gunisao has some nice 34-38"" lakers to be had early in the season, but we're not quite sure how to get them in the summer since no one seems interested in looking. Anyways, off track. At Bolton they let you take the boat out to a close reef in the evening last I heard too. Bolton seems like a fun fishing place. Aiken's I know is less expensive if that is a concern, but I don't know much about it other than seeing Bob Izumi catch some walleyes there on TV. I think a guide is optional as well there."
538968,Guest,2004-04-19 07:02:00,0,"Thanks for the info...you've been a great help. Have a great season, stay safe, and good luck to you in the never-ending pursuit for the 'fish of a lifetime'."
538993,Guest,2004-04-19 18:47:00,0,"T-BONE, if you are looking at Bolton, consider God's Lake River Lodge. Don't confuse this with Elk Island Lodge. I have been to both and God's Lake River Lodge is superior. It is at the headwaters of God's River. My son and I are avid fishermen and really had unbelieveable fishing at God's River Lodge. The lodge sits right on the bend as the river begins. After supper, I would put on a head net and go out on the rocks that extend comfortably into the river and lay out my 3700 tackle boxes and just cast about everything in my box. I was throwing with a 9' St. Croix wild river series rod I usually use for spring cohos and I could throw a lure a mile it seemed with fireline. In the river, there was a good number of beautiful brook trout. So, between Eric and I, in a 6 day stretch, we had 11 master anglers. The largest northern was 44"", walleye was 32"" (taken casting a little ripper in clown), brook trout was 24"" and vicious from the river, laker was 30"" and fat and we even caught a trophy whitefish! One person in our party caught a 35 lb laker! We were there on there first week open. Had great accomodations, meals and above all fishing!"
