538700,Guest,2004-04-08 15:54:00,0,"I talked to a group of guys in June 2002 that were busted out on the lake with swimmers in their livewell and since each of them had some fish in the well it cost all of them. I believe (???) it cost them about $100.00 per fillet, not per fish. They sure had long faces when they pulled up to the dock. ;( 7 out"
538714,Guest,2004-04-09 07:54:00,0,"Livewells save many fish. If a person catches a fish right away, puts it in the livewell, then catches no more fish, he often releases that fish when he decides it is time to quit fishing, because he does not want to be bothered with cleaning only one."
538719,Guest,2004-04-09 10:05:00,0,"Keeping a walleye in a live well for a period of time and then releasing it, may seem like a ""no harm, no foul play"", but the reality is much different. My background is in fisheries biology and I use to maintain an aquarium display for Cabelas. In handling and transporting many different species of fish for display, we found a clear difference in stress tolerance between species. Most catfish are tough, bass transport well and can take some handling, trout do well in cool water transfer, and panfish are pretty hardy. Stripers, shad, white bass(including hybrids), and walleye are just a few species that we found very difficult to transport. Walleyes in particular would often seem to do OK immediately upon transfer, but would then end up dying 2-5 days later in quarentine. The longer the fish spent in the live well, the warmer the water, and the more fish kept all increased mortality levels. The complicating factors are consistent with reduced available oxygen levels that may have resulted in permanent and fatal neurological damage. We also found that bigger fish were less tolerant of transportation in live wells. We found that most walleye transportation stress mortality occurred several days after the handling. The bottom line is that just because the fish swims away, does not mean that it is going to be OK. I currently own and operate a lodge on Lac Seul and am in extremely strong support of this regulation. As an unexpected benefit, we have also found that the fillet quality from fish immediately killed and put on ice is considerably better than from fish kept in a warm live well or drug on a stringer.

538721,Guest,2004-04-09 11:10:00,0,"Interesting. Thus, in reality, to inflict the least harm to a walleye population, one would kill the first (however many is the legal) limit caught. Probably makes sense, but not as much fun, of course. Thanks."
539000,Guest,2004-04-19 22:09:00,0,Our guide taught us to break the fish's spine. Otherwise they could revive and you'd be stuck with a huge fine.
538515,Matches,2004-03-29 18:48:00,236,"It's just a matter of time before it's law in more and more places. I believe most sportsmen will stick with their decision of keeping a fish even when they catch a bigger one. I have to say, it makes sense to me. Throw it in the cooler or release it immediately."
538516,retire55,2004-03-29 19:51:00,1029,"Ontario's 2004 fishing regs are available at http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/pubmenu.html#fish You can download map E (PDF file) to see exceptions to Lac Seul (Division 30). And on page 12 of 20 you'll see the following: Walleye and sauger must be less than 46 cm (18 in.) or greater than 53 cm (20.9 in.) and not more than one (1) over 53 cm (20.9 in.) in length. No person shall possess any live fish taken by angling other than bait-fish. Rumour mill has it that the fine for culling (i.e. throwing dead walleyes back into the water) will be loss of all equipment or $5000, whichever is less.Hmmmmmm!"
538521,Guest,2004-03-30 06:05:00,0,I wish we had this regulation on Gullrock. Lets face it culling a fish from a livewell has a 50% chance of living and culling off a stringer has none.Like I tell my guest go out catch a ton of fish keep 4 under the slot come back to camp drink a couple beers life is good.
538533,Walleye_Slayer,2004-03-30 15:49:00,134,just a little trick that might help someone else my 1675 has 2 livewells and i talked to a conservation warden last year and he said this was ok. i use my main livewell for the minnows but my rear has a standpipe. so i plug with a rubber plug the livewell and turn off the filling nozzle and put 3 frozen ice cream buckets in it. it keeps the fish well as the sun can't get at it and you don't have to store a cooler above deck. fish make it in their a whole day during mid june and its a snap to clean as on the way out the next morning you cycle the pump no mess just my 2 cents if anyone is looking for ideas A Bad Day Fishing is Better than the Best Day at Work Best Reguards Walleye_Slayer

538536,2 DOGS,2004-03-30 16:47:00,361,Bud: I didn't think culling was a problem on Gullrock. The fish there were all in the slot or over!! Is the ice starting to disappear just a little bit?
538552,Guest,2004-03-31 06:56:00,0,"2 Dogs: That's the problem we don't have a slot on Gullrock (except for what the camp owner enforce)the MNR will not give us one I guess we have two many fish. I was ice fishing the other day and had to hide behind some guy shack just to bait my hook. In all serious now there is alot of slush on all the lakes up here,and about 30 plus inches of good ice under the slush. Days are above freezing won't be long now! I'll tell Ernie you said Hi."

538553,bigfish1965,2004-03-31 07:29:00,3210,Walleye Slayer; I did the same with my bow livewell. I would also add a bunch of cubes and I used some double faced tape to adhere rigid blue insulation board to all walls of the livewell. Ice lasted more than a few days. Keeps refreshements cool as well.

538492,Guest,2004-03-29 12:19:00,0,Heard a rumor that all kept fish on Lac Seul have to be killed immediatly....is this true??
538494,Tyee Guy,2004-03-29 12:54:00,717,Yup......No culling the herd!!!!!!!!
538495,68 starcraft,2004-03-29 13:02:00,32,So much for the livewell more like a good place for a couple bags of to keep fish fresh. Does this include all species of fish on Lac Suel or just walleyes. Come on May 27th!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
538496,Guest,2004-03-29 13:59:00,0,"Dont see how this will stop culling. Im sure some people will throw back dead fish. Oh well, lets just enjoy the fishing."
538498,68 starcraft,2004-03-29 14:30:00,32,"Yep, Like they say (not what I say) the Seagulls got to eat to>>>>>>>x("
538500,Dano,2004-03-29 15:06:00,83,Does anyone know the intended purpose of this law? Or how they intend to enforce it?
538502,Trailerguy,2004-03-29 15:09:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Lac Suel does have a kill rule. Read up on the regulations, or you won't be the first nailed by the MNR, they spend a lot of time in that area."
538509,Guest,2004-03-29 17:29:00,0,Purpose is to keep fisherman from culling. Which should not be a problem on Lac Seul...just keep the last few fish you catch below the slot....make sure they are dead. We have been checked in years past and I have heard some ugly stories about fisherman caught with live Walleye. Check with your outfitter and read the rule book you get with your fishing permit.
538512,2746,2004-03-29 18:12:00,3206,Is that just for Lac Suele or does it apply to other lakes in the area as well?
538514,Trailerguy,2004-03-29 18:44:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I haven't seen this years regulations, but in the past the kill rule on Lac Suel didn't apply to the majority of the lakes in the ""area"",(22A). Specific regulations can be put in place on any lake or group of lakes each year by the MNR. A person needs to study the regulations applying to the body of water you're fishing."
