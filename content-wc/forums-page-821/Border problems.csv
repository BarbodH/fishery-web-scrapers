538896,2 DOGS,2004-04-15 16:45:00,361,Just need a statement from your vet that shows he's current on all his shots. No problem! They have far fewer instances of dogs smuggling contraband across than humans.

538909,Guest,2004-04-16 09:19:00,0,"Wow Lakertaker for somebody that has made a living off of Americans for over 30 years you sure dont seem to like em much. Whiners from Minnesota? whats with that? I'm from Wisconsin and have been going to Canada every year at least once some years twice and even three times. I love your country almost as much as mine and will be living there summers when I retire. What would the economy of northwest Ontario be without hunters and fishermen from the US. I know the attitudes of some say it would be a better place without us, but you all know without the millions of dollars we spend there every year your local economy would be a lot worse off. 5 weeks till the opener and I'll be there spending my money and catching and eating the best tasting fish on earth!"
538916,Guest,2004-04-16 13:40:00,0,You may want to check into pet food going across as it is animal by products. Resort owner friend of mine got a memo from the canadian government.
538931,Guest,2004-04-17 13:44:00,0,"C'mon Lakertaker!!!!!!!!!! Us Minnesotans have to be one of your biggest supporters in NW Ontario. When you fall in the trench and bash us we get a bit more angry and you think it is all us with the problem. We all tend to get a bit frustrated with beaurocrats. I have been fishing your country since 1980 and many years it has been multiple trips. We do most of our shopping stateside simply because we value our time at the lake and try to minimize the stops on the way to the lodge. I'm sure your food is good too. I wish you would find some bigger leeches though or go back on your transport ban so we can bring in our quality leeches. Our current party drops between $3000-$4000 per trip north of the border, so we do indeed support your country's economy. I've already got 3 trips planned this year and don't intend on stopping unless the restrictions make it totally rediculous. For me, it's all about fishing and fun with family and friends! Guide07"
539053,Guest,2004-04-22 06:42:00,0,Band on meats and potatoes has been changed for personal use. Canada Custom's will clear up for anyone who is concerned ...1-807-852-3341
539060,fishmaster,2004-04-22 15:18:00,209,Anyone know what the changes are? Post if you have the latest update.
539071,Guest,2004-04-23 07:43:00,0,"I called the above no. No potatos allowed. Up to 5 kg of beef per person OK, other meats OK. Other fruits and vegies (like salad mix, onions, etc.) OK. Unless I asked the wrong questions, it looks straight forward except for the spuds ban."

539081,hammer_gold_spinner,2004-04-23 13:07:00,151,"Getting into canada and what to bring is no problem. As stated no potatoes, limits on beef and pork. For the most part your better off getting everything there. The big thing to remember is what to have to get back to the USA. Bring your birth certificate or passport and you will have no problem."
538784,idapaul,2004-04-12 19:37:00,82,thanks mcQ. i just hate it when i see these people get on the boards with their lousy attitudes and bad mouth the us. i know that the ugly american still lives but hopefully not at my house.there is good and bad in all societies and we just have to learn to live with it i guess.i ran into some canadians one time at a campground in new york state who had a pretty bad attitude towards the us and made it known. that didn't stop them from asking me to smuggle liquor and cigarettes over the border for them. i bet you can guess my answer.i also saw things the other way. i do a trip with scouts every year and we used to have a camp in voyager national park on the minn. side of the border until the feds decided to make it to hard to have. the canadian govt leased us land on the other side of the lake and came to the boy scouts rescue. nice deal huh the us govt kicks us out and the canadian govt takes us in.
538787,Guest,2004-04-12 20:50:00,0,I heard a rumor that boats from the US were not allowed in Canada this year because of fear of spreading zebra mussels into Canada. Has anyone heard anything about this? I go to Tobin Lake twice a year and bring our boats from SD. ;-)
538791,DAVIS_VIEHBECK,2004-04-13 05:12:00,15,"I've never heard of that. All boaters must be responsible and ensure their bilge, wells and boat are free of any species that may enter another aquatic system. -Davis FYI My part time business is called Extreme Angling Promotions and it is not to be mistaken with the user who logged in under ExtremeAngling."

538862,Guest,2004-04-14 07:28:00,0,"folks - 10 years ago crossing the border in these times would have been a chore. cross with what you want. if they dump some of your stuff make it up in canada, check the internet for where to get the stuff........you'd be surprised at those - these new canadians.heck they even got electricity! seriously..........where we fish there's a brand new IGA - we could buy everything there and cheaper...it's easier to pre-plan but if we had to we could do - have a good vacation"
538876,Guest,2004-04-14 18:01:00,0,"Brax, dont be surprised if you HAVE met me before, have owned a resort on Lake of the Woods for 34 years. We just get so sick and tired of all the cry babies. Almost all of them are from Minnesota. There isnt a day goes by when I am in the states where I am not pulling out my wallet and paying over inflated prices for everything there too, but if I am going to go thats my own decision, I am not a whiner. See ya on Lake of the Woods."
538895,1shooter,2004-04-15 16:17:00,1493,I'm heading up in June and plan to take my dog. What do I need to do this? Is this even a good idea?
538738,Guest,2004-04-09 19:21:00,0,"Does anybody out there know if there are any items banned at the Candadian border this year.Last year it was potatoes of all things. Just wondering with all those silly cows and chickens with the flu I don't what to bring for food. We don't like to stop and shop, its straight up and ""GONE FISH'N"""
538742,Guest,2004-04-10 14:21:00,0,"Most guns, leeches, minnows, nightcrawlers packed in soil, explosives, potatoes, fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, processed migratory waterfowl, pornographic material, and for sure, some things I never was asked about."
538743,Guest,2004-04-10 16:01:00,0,"You're best to bring absolutely nothing. You won't get into trouble and the locals will love you. In the Nipigon area wher I live ""Pork and Beaners"" are loathed. Bring nothing and shop locally we love you. You just might get some local tips."
538746,Matches,2004-04-10 20:05:00,236,"If you're going to or through Kenora, you will be able to buy every item you need at the brand new Wal-Mart! Isn't that great? Anyone know when or if it's open yet? How's it look?"
538754,Matches,2004-04-11 18:26:00,236,"Brax, I would rather give my money to the locals then to Wal-Mart. It's great that you spend your money at the cafe's and buy shirts and groceries and all your gas in Canada, but I don't think everyone does. I think many buy groceries, Crawlers, ice, fill up their truck and boats with gas so all they have to do when they cross the border is get to the resort and fish. Tourism is big business and locals need to profit. My guess would be that Canadians visiting the U.S. for vacation probably do spend more per person then we do in Canada. Just my opinion."
538755,Brax,2004-04-11 18:47:00,52,"Matches, Here's the thing. I like to buy a flat of worms two weeks before my trip. I do this so I can fatten them up. After two weeks in Buss bedding they are like small snakes, something you can't buy at the resort. Something with leeches, I can get a pound of jumbo's here 4-6' ones, that I can't get in Canada. I also bring some food, not to save money but cooking time. A frozen bowl of chile is easy to bring but a pain to make up there. I travel from southern Wisconsin and my average money spent is $2000-$3000 per trip, not including the stuff I bring from home. Last year, I crossed the border and stayed in a motel in Canada. This year I will not because crossing the boarder at that time stinks, so I will stay on the US side and cross in the morning. I will stop for breakfest as soon as I cross though. Most all the people I meet in Canada are great. I know they make a living from the fishermen and I don't mind paying reasonable prices for anything up there. I guess my biggest problem is with the ministry that keeps making it harder and more costly to go to Canada."
538765,Guest,2004-04-12 09:39:00,0,Check with Canada Immigration call 807-852-3968 They'll let you know whats banned. I ylaked to them at the Minneapolis Sports Show and at that time it was meat and spuds. If your going to Ear Falls you can fax your list to the local grocery and he'll have it ready for you when you get there.
538768,McQ,2004-04-12 12:29:00,615,"idapaul, that's a great observation - not sure of the IRAQI connection but certainly tourism terrorists with a poor understanding of what constitutes good humor amongst neighbours. Nobody has problems unless they choose to ignore the habits and customs of the territory they are travelling in, both countries have their own set of rules and being aware is priority #1. I welcome you all to enjoy true Canadian hospitality regardless the reason for coming up here, we sure do appreciate your company and from personal experience the same good times apply to us folks who enjoy travelling south of the border."
538776,DAVIS_VIEHBECK,2004-04-12 18:18:00,15,"Guys (and gals), As a Canadian, I can honestly say MOST of us, value our US visitors (especially anglers and hunters). Our tourism industry in Nortwestern Ontario relies on you guys so lets not worry about where you shop or how much you spend just keep coming up and enjoy the fishing!. -Davis Viehbeck"
538781,Brax,2004-04-12 19:05:00,52,"Davis Viehbeck, The people I meet in Canada are more like you, I find the people friendly and the resorts reasonably priced. I plan to make yearly fishing trips to Canada until I am too old to travel. I guess it just irks me the way they keep banning new things year after year. I have never met anyone like ExtemeAngler or Lakertaker while in Canada, I would assume they are pissed off because we are up there on ""their lakes""."
