6692164,Lazy Fisherman,2022-10-16 03:55:00,276,We always bought our dry ice at the Cenex gas station at south end of town (International Falls). I doubt they would have it at this time of the year.
6208280,Guest,2018-06-13 08:15:00,0,Does anyone sell dry ice in Sioux Lookout?
6208308,pjshorthorn,2018-06-13 09:00:00,5654,Check out Camcarb in Sioux Lookout. They are a compressed gas cylinder distributor there and may have it for retail sale. Their phone number is 416-745-1304. My guess is that it is going to be pricey. Camcarb.com PjShorthorn
6208384,x4flatfish,2018-06-13 11:48:00,319,Have never been able to find it there. We get ours in Dryden on the way home.
6208408,johnboat,2018-06-13 12:50:00,2014,"How far of a drive does one have to take to require dry ice for fish? After a 17 hour drive home mine is still frozen, just using a cooler with maybe a couple of gatoraid bottles of frozen water. Are you at out post camps that have no freezer?"
6208421,btyreprich,2018-06-13 13:25:00,1067,"Was thinking the same thing. When we leave Ear Falls to return home to Chicago, we place frozen fillets in a cooler filed with frozen blue ices. The cooler is not a Yeti quality cooler - just one of those 3day extreme cooler. Now granted the cooler Hass been on the inside of our air conditioned vehicle. However I don't think dry ice is really necessary unless you are traveling a long distance home. Just my two cents."
6208463,Guest,2018-06-13 16:33:00,0,We are two day drive. We leave the camp at 5 in the morning and going to North Dakota the first day. .
6208471,bigwalleye1,2018-06-13 16:54:00,2632,Couple spots in I falls has dry ice. Nice stops for lunch anyway.
6209118,Jabs,2018-06-15 18:10:00,24,Back in the 80's we would buy dry ice from a diary in Dryden . Now with coolers like the yeti. Regular ice gets us at least 11 hours
6691254,Mathew23sds,2022-10-12 03:32:00,2,I've never seen a dry ice shop here either word hurdle
6691270,Luckydawg13,2022-10-12 04:43:00,363,If you're traveling through North Dakota South Dakota where there's a lot of big game hunting check out a meat processing place they probably sell dry ice too
