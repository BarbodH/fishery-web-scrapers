6691328,Bakefish,2022-10-12 07:49:00,1077,"I fished Pakuni Lodge since it went public back in the 80's. I quit going there in 2014 just because I needed a change of pace. The camp is nothing special, but no complaints. The lake is full of big northern. My biggest was 26 lbs. Pakuni Lodge is located on the south end of Pakwash which is 15 miles long and 5 miles wide which means that when the wind is honking out of the north the south end can become unfishable. Don't be surprised if you have to spend a day or two in the cabin because that lake can be a beast. Walleye can be tough, but they are there, and abundant. If you decide to go get in touch with me and I'll give you the lowdown."

6691802,SGM,2022-10-13 21:11:00,2,I have been going to Pakuni since 2003 and thoroughly enjoy it. We usually fish it early to mid August and find the walleye very cooperative dragging worm harnesses with the occasional throwing of crarkbaits. There are lots of spots to fish depending on the wind. Find 8 to 12 feet of water on weed edges and youâ€™ve found the walleye. Lots of Northern 36 to 40+ inches. Cabins are nothing special but certainly adequate. They were late opening last year due to high water / wind damage. I believe it was 4 August before the road in was opened. Good luck.
6691832,Eckohlt,2022-10-14 05:34:00,3685,Thanks SGM.

6692234,Eckohlt,2022-10-16 10:13:00,3685,"If the wash is roll'n I'm heading into the English river,right around the corner from camp.should be very quiet around there in late fall."
6692256,Bakefish,2022-10-16 12:23:00,1077,"Rod, when that lake gets it's dander up just going around that corner to the river can be a come to Jesus experience."
6692258,Eckohlt,2022-10-16 12:42:00,3685,"Just have to see in the morning if the winds blowing n what direction,then get a game plan on where to go or not to go,I'm sure everyone on this site has dealt with killer waves before,for me several times,gotta respect them."
