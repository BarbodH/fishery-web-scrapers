6691222,jb_wi,2022-10-11 20:49:00,212,Finalizing a trip for next year and have been to Cherob before it got sold and renamed as Lac Seul Wilderness Lodge. Had a good experience at Cherobs when we were there in 2018. Have also heard Onaway is in a great spot and and has a great resort. Anyone have any advice on one or the other..or specifically your experience with Onaway? Thanks

Nice cabins, awesome dock with electricity posts plug ins, good camp boats & motors, nice fish cleaning house, get 30 gallons of gas & 21 dozen minnows. Located in a protected Scout Bay. Good fishing nearby & close access to good fishing in Bay of Islands, McKenzie Bay, South Bay, South Inlet, Manitoba Point, Manitou Narrows. Current owners of 25 years are retiring end of March. New owners will take over on April 1st. They are a young couple with 2 young kids who have lived in the area for several years & operate a fly in out post fishing camp & have resort experience. Present owners feel confident the new owners will continue to offer the same good service that they had provided for 25 years! Check out their website: https://www.onawaylodge.com/ I have been going to Lac Seul for 20 years. 1 year at Golden Eagle & 1 year at Timberlane, then wanted to stay further South on the Lake. So, spent 13 years at Fisherman's Cove (also a nice resort located right by Onaway) & then the last 5 years at Onaway. If you have any other questions, send me a message. Good luck with making your decision. RBF. üëç‚ù§Ô∏èüé£üá®üá¶"

Before I had retired, to go to Onaway would require me to take off 7 days of work, and 6 days at all the other Sat - Sat lodges, so I've always chosen to pass on Onaway for that reason. But the folks that go there love it. We've been going to Fisherman's Cove for the past 8 or so trips. FC is about a mile or two further down Scout Bay. Also, it seems that all of Onaway's cabins have about a 6-person minimum, which doesn't work for my small group of 2 or 3."
