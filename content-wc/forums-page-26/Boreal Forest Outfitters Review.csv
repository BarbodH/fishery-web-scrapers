I asked several of you on here about them and got very positive feedback. Thank you guys . Prior to flying in ,in late August ,I asked Sue and Jay about a moose tag. They responded they would know by the time we came out . We had a good trip on fly in ,but high winds and much rain. Everything great with camp,boats ,motors and plenty of gas and ice. Ate walleye everyday !! We flew out and found out they had a bull moose tag for my wife and i. Made our minds up very quickly and 3 weeks later we were back to hunt . The lake we wanted to hunt was one of 2 available . We had fished that lake several years prior with MLO. I studied the aerial pictures of the lake and with help from Jay ,had a good idea of areas to try. Sue flew us in on Sunday morning in Nakina Air Otter. Got settled into camp. Fishing poles rigged and rifles in soft cases. Went fishing, hunting and scouting . The SpotX communication worked fine . On Wednesday we connected on a bull. Sue would have flown in to get it ,but with the 30-40 degree temps the meat was fine ,hanging in camp. Thursday - Saturday we had snow squalls and at times whiteout conditions . Fished in between . Walleye fishing got tougher but pike really turned on. Jay flew in with Nakina Air pilot and winterized camp ,while we loaded the Otter. Sue and Jay were absolutely GREAT to deal with . Lord willing we will be using them more ."

Nice touch we all thought, 3 trips later we feel like family when we show up. Our group did not cancel in 2022 unlike many others. BFO has reinvested in the camps (our camp) adding solar refrigerators which work better than gas powered. They added SpotX, phone chargers and have always provided plenty of fuel never cutting it close. The morning we were due to fly out (see my post June 2022) the area was hit with 50-60 mile per hour winds grounding us at the camp. Late in the day Nakina Air flew in to take us out and dock broke off tie downs. Jason faced with ""another financial loss"" was cool, calm, an never became angry/p'd off like he had every right to be. Jason & Sue are great camp owners. We look forward to our next trip 6th with BFO."
