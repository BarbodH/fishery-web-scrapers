6685858,jjk,2022-09-12 15:48:00,103,Thank you everyone that has responded I appreciate all of the info. Guess a couple of things I should have added this will be in August due to son's baseball schedule and not as hard set on the budget number as I am in firsthand experiences of great locations and some fantastic fishing.
6686728,winger,2022-09-18 04:48:00,8,"Had a great father son trip at Ash Rapids. Access to Shoal lake for great pike/bass fishing is very close. Boat in from Kenora and fully guided with all meals/shore lunch if you want it. Lots of nice pike in the 30's and high 20's walleyes. If you go later, some nice Musky fishing available."
6690826,Waba,2022-10-10 07:16:00,25,"Without a doubt, check out Erringtons wilderness Islands. Great fishing, great cabins, great owners and staff."
6690852,bthomas3333,2022-10-10 09:33:00,465,"Hello, I just did a father son trip in Sept to God's River Lodge. They have a 50% off the second person deal after June. American Plan / Guided / Big lake and river to fish. I posted a report here. I did 5 days for a little over $4300 so pretty decent deal and good water. Take a look at their website. Brett"
6691132,OldFootdoc,2022-10-11 15:42:00,393,Second vote for God's River Lodge... My son and I went every year for 5 or 6 years pre covid and always caught numbers and large fish in several species... Brookies; Walleyes; Northern Pike and Lake Trout and a whitefish or two; We would ususally target ice out and actually had to navigate around ice from time to time. Little God's Bay and Graveyard were spectacular as was a day excursion to Siemons lake. You will not be disappointed.
6691204,Sylvanboat,2022-10-11 19:22:00,94,Look into Lac LaMartre in NW Territories. Along Great Slave Lake. Northern and lake trout. When we fished there years ago 15 lb northern were routine. My biggest was 25 pounder.

6684980,NWwalleye,2022-09-08 19:26:00,223,I think I might have guided you at BCLL ..Does the name Ken ring a bell
6684996,prov1800,2022-09-08 20:04:00,5010,As far as a trip to NWO in the Vermilion Bay area I would suggest Anishinabi Lake Lodge.Great pike and Lake trout action plus unreal smallmouth bass.All walleye fishing would be in Portage lakes accessible by atv on great trails.check out www.clarksresorts.com
6685060,Jeler,2022-09-09 06:42:00,92,"Please, give us a break! Mike Borger would be a great person to get ahold of."
6685084,prov1800,2022-09-09 07:47:00,5010,Here's your break.Caught 2 weeks ago.15 minute flight from the air base on Cedar.COMFY 17.5 ft boats with floors and 25 hp Yamaha 4 stroke engine.Crystal clear water to 300 ft deep.option of a cabin on main island or a more private cabin on other end of the lake in the William Narrows.Ive fished there.Hard to beat.
6685184,proguidedream,2022-09-09 11:51:00,345,"sounds like wilderness might be an option if that is the case check out ""outposts"" that some camps offer. will be a bit smaller lake and sometimes 100% secluded by yourself. fishing is normally great just ask what species you prefer. https://jacksonslodge.com/packages/outposts/ Cat island offers what you are asking for , pike , lots of walleye, and your shot at lake trout. fairly easy to be succesful self guiding.https://exc-adventures.com/cat-islan...american-plan/ Aikens lake is top tier water and has huge fish of all species. run very well and profesional https://www.aikenslake.com/fishing"
6685358,prov1800,2022-09-10 09:11:00,5010,Here is a view of the cabin at the William Narrows at far end of Anishinabi Lake.Very sheltered area.very scenic area and within a 1/2 mile to Halverson Lake by creek to some great pike and smallmouth bass.
6685378,7 Mag,2022-09-10 11:47:00,1887,Thatâ€™s a nice pike!
6685400,prov1800,2022-09-10 13:37:00,5010,There's some dandies in there.Plenty of 3 footers.My wife and I have had 200 pike days there.One hook lures the best and pinched barbs for quick release.Water very clear and can see pike coming after your lure.Can try to crank in fast to avoid smaller ones eating your lure but there pretty quick.lots of pike like in pic
6685402,last chance,2022-09-10 13:41:00,3262,"I have fished with my 2 sons from the time they were in diapers. we have never been anywhere north of Manistee Michigan fishing for salmon in Manistee lake. never been to Canada because my budget wasn't high enough to go. but have found lake Erie to be awesome for eyes. on your trip, I can only give a little advice to what I would want for my sons and myself. I would want a medium to large lake that offers the fish you are targeting. but with little or no experience on the type of fishing you want to do or with the lake I would want a guide for 1 or 2 days to learn the lay of the lake and what technics that will catch fish with 2 days being better to have time to try different ways of fishing for your target species. I would want shore lunch on those days for sure. then I would want to be totally on our own for the rest of the trip. after all, you are there to make memories that will last your son a lifetime after you are gone. when I started fishing the central basin of lake Erie I didn't know anything about using dipsy divers to get my lures down to the fish. but after only 2 days on a good charter, we were able to go on our own and use 3 divers on each side of the boat and catch fish. but after yrs, I'm still learning. but those 2 days were priceless as we learned more in 2 days than we could have learned in 10 yrs going on our own knowing nothing."
6684886,jjk,2022-09-08 13:36:00,103,"Looking to book a trip for my 14 yo son and I for next August. We are coming from SD and looking for a fly in location. Torn on guided or self guided but open to either. Species we would like to target would be in this order Large Pike, Walleye and possibly Lake Trout. Looking for suggestions for folks that have been to fantastic locations as want this to be a special one. Thank you in advance to anyone that takes time out of your busy lives to help a guy out."

6684906,Carnhzkr,2022-09-08 14:56:00,964,"Good on you for taking your son. I started taking both of mine when they turned 6 and have gone on many father/son, father/son/son, father/wife/son/son, etc. trips since then. In fact, I'm leaving on a father/son trip with my youngest on Saturday. Would be very helpful if you'd indicate what price-point you're thinking about. Since you're starting in Rapid City, you've got both Sask and Manitoba straight north of you. There's plenty of great pike, walleye, & lake trout fishing in both northern Sask and Manitoba, but like anything, the further north you go the better the fishing and the more expensive it gets."
6684912,jjk,2022-09-08 15:20:00,103,I am thinking I would like to stay under the $5000 mark for the 2 of us but not real stuck on a budget number if anyone has first hand experiences of amazing spots they consider as prime locations for that time of year. Hope you have a great trip!!
6684916,proguidedream,2022-09-08 15:26:00,345,are you looking for dinner served and shore lunches everyday ? or looking for a wilderness retreat with the son bringing a cooler of food and cooking yourself. both are equally as fun in their own way. guide or no guide should depend on the size of lake and at the ease you can go out and find fish.
6684928,jjk,2022-09-08 16:11:00,103,Pro that is a great question could be persuaded either way.....if the fishing is way better and I have pack the food and cook everything that works fine. I agree both could be fun and neither way would be a deal breaker for us.
6684932,CiscoKid,2022-09-08 16:36:00,28,"I'm the son in the father son equation, been going with my dad since I was 12. This is just my preferance, to each their own... If you go to a large lake, go to one that has both a guided and non-guided option. Getting a guide to show you around and give you technique tips can be valuable for a day. But the most memorable parts of the father son trips I have had are just the two of us sharing time in the boat. My dad would also always let me decide where to explore. A guide in the boat can take away from that time a little in my opinion. I personally enjoy going to a smaller lake that is manageable without a guide. My dad is getting older now and i do most of the planning, driving, etc., but still the best few days of my year. Not sure how many more trips we have together, so enjoy making memories. One other tip- bring something that will allow you to take pictures with the two of you in them. I have all these pictures of me holding fish, but none of both my dad and I in the same picture. I now bring a mount that i can attach to my phone and set a timer to get shots with bot of us in the picture."
6684938,adempsey2.0,2022-09-08 17:05:00,611,"If your primary goal is big pike, I would try to find somewhere in northern Saskatchewan or Manitoba first. Problem is, the price might be outside your budget. The places that I am familiar with tend to be quite expensive, unless you opt for a short trip. Ontario will be less expensive. Look for camps on larger bodies of water. Look at the camps/lodges on: Whitewater Lake (Thunderhook Fly-Ins, Wilderness North Striker's Point, Wilderness North Whitewater Lodge) Mojikit Lake (Mattice Lake Outfitters, Wilderness North) Lake St. Joseph (Slate Falls Outposts) North Caribou Lake (North Caribou Camps) Smoothrock Lake (Thunderhook Fly-Ins) Birch Lake (Birch Lake Lodge) Bamaji Lake (Knobby's Fly-In Lodge and Outposts)"
6684944,bthomas3333,2022-09-08 17:45:00,465,Saskatchewan is where I would want to be for bigger pike. I'd look at Broken Arrow outpost on Cree Lake. Good multiple species lake and price is around $2400 of course it is unguided. I visited this past June and had a really good trip. The trip report is on here. Planning a return trip in June 24. Kississing Lake Lodge has outposts around N SK and N MB they would fit your price point and get you into good water. Brett
