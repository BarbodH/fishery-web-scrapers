6693440,prov1800,2022-10-22 19:03:00,5010,Forced myself to have another piece after supper.
6693082,Carnhzkr,2022-10-20 07:53:00,964,I'm interested in how you cover up your boat for the winter. Do you build a frame to hold a tarp like an A-frame to keep the snow off? Or do you just cover it with a tarp and let the snow build up?
6693086,prov1800,2022-10-20 08:10:00,5010,I have 3 supports about 3 ft high and a 20 ft long beam made from 2x4 the slides in center supports and then put tarp over and tie down to trailer.its always held up.Once in a while I'll brush snow off like I did last year with our incredible snow load.Ill take pic if I get to it today or tomorrow.Be out checking deer baits today and a little grouse hunting.
6693092,Fisherman Ted,2022-10-20 08:35:00,461,I have them vacuum wrapped with the accompanying support structure underneath. We wrap the main fleet (@ 20 boats). The 35+ boats in the bush are just tipped over for the winter.
6693096,prov1800,2022-10-20 08:44:00,5010,Do you service engines in bush or bring them out Ted.
6693124,Fisherman Ted,2022-10-20 10:38:00,461,All out-lake boats are stripped and brought back to the lodge (not the boats). We then service the engines and store for the winter. -FT
6693146,Eckohlt,2022-10-20 11:45:00,3685,John fire up your vacum cleaner n shrink wrap that prov!
6693168,prov1800,2022-10-20 14:21:00,5010,Here's pic.18 1/2 ft boat.Wheels get put on wood and tarp is 20 ft.Same tarp for about 12 years now.Takes 1/2 hr to cover it.Super easy
6693174,RichA$1970,2022-10-20 15:35:00,1159,Beautiful background and what a deer blind potential….we used to park an old grain buggy in a corner of a field and your boat has potential
6693176,prov1800,2022-10-20 16:15:00,5010,Get deer in our back yard and in good old days would have a few moose come through to.Creek in my back yard.There all safe here.I hunt 10 miles from home down old logging road atv access only.
6693186,Eckohlt,2022-10-20 17:36:00,3685,Do you hunt on crown land or private?
6692882,prov1800,2022-10-19 08:01:00,5010,Had to pick up some items yesterday at Northern Lights and figured I would make a grouse run up Cedar Point Resorts rd.Lots of grouse and only had 4 shells left.Used up those shells on way in.Saw some moose tracks also and noticed ice forming by the brokeback bridge.-7c this morning.Boat going to get put in backyard in next couple of days.Dont think I'll be going out anymore with deer hunting now.Be ice fishing soon when those conditions get good.
6692910,Golden Eagle,2022-10-19 09:25:00,2642,Thanks for the post. I've been north of Red Lake after the first 2 weeks of moose season. I was in camp with 3 guys who owned their camps. They talked. I mostly listened. Interesting. They chased moose. I fished. A storm pinned us down for 2+ days. We burned a lot of wood.
6692934,prov1800,2022-10-19 10:46:00,5010,Spent 5 days at Clarks Grace lake and only saw a cow Heard 2 cows bawling and heard one bull.First week was warm fishing was fantastic in 5-8ft of water.Last week at Solitary lake for 5 days to and saw nothing and no fresh tracks either.But again fishing was great in about same depth.Both outposts had good fishing from dock also
6692960,Eckohlt,2022-10-19 12:24:00,3685,Did you fly with wilderness air to solitary?
6692962,prov1800,2022-10-19 12:32:00,5010,"Sure did.Theres a 40"" pike there swimming around with one of my vibratos.lol.No live bait allowed there worms worked well.rubbers not that great.vibratoes killed them."
6693000,prov1800,2022-10-19 15:29:00,5010,Well that's it for fishing from the boat.All winterized and will get her covered up tomorrow.Will be dropping a jig through a few inches of ice next.
6693002,That Minnesota guy,2022-10-19 17:03:00,8293,Is that a 17' Lund with a 60hp Yamaha?

6693074,Skywagon,2022-10-20 06:58:00,1106,"I winterized the cabin this week, water line and pump pulled from the lake, all the floating docks pulled to shore, cabin stocked with firewood. The next time in will be over the ice by snowmobile.The grouse have been out in full force on my 1/4-mile driveway and yard at home. This one was looking in the office window."
6693076,prov1800,2022-10-20 07:07:00,5010,Let's hope we don't get a repeat of last winter.Ice is forming now and ice fishing will start soon.Grouse hunting has been very good.Hoping to visit you in your awesome ice hut this winter.
