6694242,prov1800,2022-10-27 18:42:00,5010,Depends where your hunting Eck..You have driven up here and seen the terrain.Can either bait and hope to bring some deer in or hunt trails.Most guys want baited stands.Easier way to hunt.If your on farm felds than easier yet.Depends on the hunter.
6694246,Eckohlt,2022-10-27 18:58:00,3685,Gonna bait those eyes with freebies very soon.lol
6694250,prov1800,2022-10-27 19:08:00,5010,Nothing like bait.freebies are the best.Times coming fast be fun seeing you.
6694302,walleyecheek,2022-10-28 04:37:00,2231,If you've got room ! Throw in a couple 50# bags of shelled corn will ya ?
6694316,Eckohlt,2022-10-28 05:28:00,3685,"Ok!once I cross the border I'll open a bag n let it trickle out from fort Francis to vermillion bay,they'll be hundreds of deer feeding on the road,be an easy hunt,no far to drag the critter to the truck."
6693522,Eagle1,2022-10-23 19:56:00,28,"Heading up through Intl Falls next week for whitetail hunting. My guide is asking us to bring some 50# bags of shell corn along for baiting. I called the border, but I can’t seem to get a straight answer if it’s allowed to be brought across the border. Anyone have experience with this, or know the specific ruling on this?"
6693538,Eckohlt,2022-10-24 04:38:00,3685,"All's I know is sweet corn is allowed,I would assume corn is corn."
6693698,smalljaw,2022-10-25 08:31:00,7,"I live on Rainy Lake and have brought corn over the border several times, no problem."
6693710,Billswest,2022-10-25 10:05:00,32,You're paying for a guided hunt and you need to bring the corn? What am I missing here ?
6693730,Huntindave,2022-10-25 11:53:00,2194,"Corn is probably higher priced for the outfitter to purchase locally. If the client can get corn at x dollars per bag and get y dollars per bag deducted from the bill, then it is a win win for both parties."
6693732,Eagle1,2022-10-25 12:14:00,28,Exactly!
6693794,RichA$1970,2022-10-25 23:29:00,1159,Hopefully the outfitter is already baiting as dumping a bag a corn doesn’t automatically pull in deer & can take time to get them set.
6693818,Baseline,2022-10-26 07:01:00,3207,The outfitter ought to be able to tell you the rules and regs.
6693944,Wawajake,2022-10-26 19:27:00,413,I buy 50# bags of corn feed for my deerstand here in Northern Ont and it is only $20 cdn a bag at the COOP store or TSC store so seems silly to have to bring your own for a guided hunt.
6693946,Eckohlt,2022-10-26 19:31:00,3685,Do you need corn to shoot a deer in ont?
