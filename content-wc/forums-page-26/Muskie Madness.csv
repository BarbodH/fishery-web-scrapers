6693348,pjshorthorn,2022-10-22 00:57:00,5654,"The fishing was a bit tough for a couple of days, but musky were caught throughout the week. Our group boated 1 and had a number of follows. I think the winning fish came in at 47 1/2  or thereabouts. Overall , it was a really fun week at a beautiful time of year in Canada. PjShorthorn"
6693352,fishin779,2022-10-22 04:47:00,63,I'm jealous !! Good luck and I hope the fishing is good and the memories made are great!
6685668,pjshorthorn,2022-09-12 04:20:00,5654,"In 9 days I'm going to embark on another adventure named Muskie Madness. I am so excited to finally go on this trip as I've wanted to do this trip in late September for a few years now, but either timing or no slots available , or just life stuff always got in the way. It is more exciting as I have two dear friends coming along which is going to rekindle some of our past fishing and camping trips we have taken together over the years. We leave O'Dark early next Tuesday to embark on an epic road trip of a 1000 miles. We are also blessed to also be able to spend the night in the northern most area of Minnesota ,on the way up and back, to see another dear friend who has graciously opened up their home to us. So you may be wondering what Muskie Madness is . I'm not sure I can describe it accurately with the exception of learning that Muskie and Madness are the two words that describe the week well. We are going to be part of the  somewhat world famous and the largest unsanctioned Muskie tournament on Eagle Lake. The event has been developed, nurtured and honed by none other than the WC wild child himself; known as Lord Gord/ VBay Gord the keeper of all things real . This event is legit ..complete with an awards event at the end where 1st,2nd and 3rd place get cool prizes of various kinds whether or be a rod, lures and other fishing accessories of course there is always some of the VBay Lodge bling thrown in is well. That might be a nice hat, fishing towel , shirt or possibly an awesome hoodie. The 1st place winner is also presented with a hand carved Muskie trophy made by a long time guest and artisan ..also a WC member. To wrap it all up, the evening includes the entire camp invading the Bayview Bar and Motel to have fun sharing lies, the one got away, etc along with some shuffleboard and a few beverages to close out what will be an awesome trip. I most look forward to receiving the PJPA .PJ's Participation Award. Stay tuned for a trip report as long as I don't get eaten by an Eagle Lake monster. PjShorthorn"
