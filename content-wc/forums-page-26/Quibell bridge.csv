Residents on 609 were notified last winter the bridge was slated for replacement. I believe the reason given was it was nearing the end of its expected life span, not that there was anything in particular wrong with."

6692508,N_of_Quibell,2022-10-17 10:16:00,151,"Yes,compared to this spring, the Quibell Rd. is now a super highway. Relative to this spring, I was shocked how low the water levels were last week - the flow over the dam at McIntosh (Forest Lk?) was the lowest I've seen it in many years."
6692528,prov1800,2022-10-17 10:56:00,5010,Low pretty much everywhere now.
6692654,Bill Krejca,2022-10-18 06:19:00,6107,"Re: Low water - During the Cedar Lake trip several weeks ago, we boated up to the rapids to show it to our new-to- the-lake folks. We were surprised that there was little, if any, water (no rapids). This was the first time for me to see no incoming water. Bill"
