6689622,Lktrician,2022-10-03 09:59:00,32,"I'm looking for a portable unit to take to a flyin next year. I see where some are able to post that they see schools near the bottom. My unit is great for depth and structure but doesn't have enough definition to display fish at or nearly on the bottom. Unfortunately I can only do 1 flyin per year, so cost is an issue. I'd appreciate some feed back if others have a preference"
6689800,last chance,2022-10-04 09:10:00,3262,"it might help to know what unit you're using now. on some units, you just need to adjust the gain on the unit for a better definition of fish."
6689828,Mojo-NC,2022-10-04 11:44:00,1929,"You can either purchase a portable unit or convert your current fish finder to portable. To do that you would need an extra transducer with a suction cup mounting bracket, a power supply, and a spare mounting bracket. I would highly recommend getting a unit with GPS capabilities. Also, fish lying right on the bottom are difficult if not impossible to differentiate from the bottom structure with any standard sonar unit."
6689836,adempsey2.0,2022-10-04 12:48:00,611,"Last when I looked into this, the Humminbird Helix 5 was a pretty solid unit for use on a fly-in.It comes in various models with DI, SI, GPS etc.. I would probably go with the CHIRP Sonar + GPS version. The DI and SI are nice, but personal preference if you really want that for a fly-in. Double check what the current models are - you will see G2, G3, G4...not sure what the benefits of the newer ones are.https://humminbird.johnsonoutdoors.c...5-chirp-gps-g3The Helix 5 comes in a portable version if you prefer a turnkey set-up.https://humminbird.johnsonoutdoors.c...hirp-gps-g3-ptYou could probably get away with the Helix 7 as well, but that really depends on what is most important for you.I'd recommend a 12V lithium battery as well - 10Ah is good, 12Ah is better.I should mention, what is actually MOST important are the maps you can use with the various units. Look at that first and then decide which brand to move forward with. All the big brands have good sonar units."
6689862,last chance,2022-10-04 14:48:00,3262,"for me I wouldn't want any 5"" just because of the small screen. I had a helix seven and the size of the screen was so much better than a 5"". but I ended up with a Lowrance hds 8 unit that just had so many good options on it than my old gen 1 helix. I do recommend you get at least a seven-inch unit. and try to go with the new-gen units."
6689892,Old Timer,2022-10-04 16:37:00,255,"I've gone on many fly-in trips. Early on, we had no electronics and caught plenty. Then we went to the original Lowrance Green Box and used those devices for 15-20 years and caught plenty. My present unit is a small Vexilar Boundary Waters that I bought used for fifty bucks years ago and don't see myself looking for something else. On any fly-in you can usually start with the outfitter's spots and a simple map showing the key points, narrows and moving water. Then read the wind and understand seasonal weather patterns, and you're ninety percent there. On remote walleye lakes I'm interested in depth and structure breaks. Not much else is required for a good day on the water. Just about any unit will give you that information. I suspect this isn't what you wanted to hear."
6690284,MrSimon,2022-10-06 12:53:00,922,I use a Helix 5 with a homemade clamp-on transducer and a small lithium 12V battery. I LOVE the auto-chart live that allows me to map out all the good spots on the lake and find the spot on the spot. Learning to use this tool effectively literally doubled our fish catches .... and helped tremendously in locating big fish spots.
6690468,proguidedream,2022-10-07 11:44:00,345,"lowrance is fairly undisputed as the best unit for 2D sonar. even an elite 4 can mark fish pretty good. lots of portable packs available, i use a ratcheting clamp and ducer on a 1x2 piece of wood. works well , and wood floats if it ever decides to come off. lots of portable packs available."
6690510,andreindy,2022-10-07 18:54:00,308,"Three Helix 5's come with us for each of the boats. Generally very inexpensive, especially if you get the base model without down imaging. All 3 units allow GPS saving so you can always get back to the good spot you found. For us, we spent the $79 for a Zero Lines card so we could map the contours. And then share this data between all the units. I appreciate those who use less to catch more. My group rarely gets to fish all year. So spending the money for the locator to help us maximize our opportunities there is worth it for us."
6691456,MrSimon,2022-10-12 14:38:00,922,"I know this is a can of worms, but people who ""use less to catch more"" do not exist. More information leads to better decision making which leads to catching more fish. It's true, you don't NEED electronics on a fly-in to catch a boat load of walleye ... but I guarantee that properly using a good unit will bring even more and bigger fish in. And more importantly, it cuts WAY down on the time it takes to figure out the structure."
