Early Friday morning to the border where we dealt with the drill sargent like border guard who barked at us 70 year old men like we were children. His final remark to us was ""you are here to fish, what are you going to do if someone asks you to work?"" I wanted to answer ""what's the pay?"" but my response was ""My answer is no Drill Sargent!"" He was a noob. After crossing the border Nick, our camp operator, suggested we drive to Dryden and give him a call since the situation with the 105 was changing by the moment. When we got to Dryden we gave him a call and he responded that the detour out of V Bay was closed and the only way to get there was to turn in Richan Road and follow the orange arrows. We found Richan Rd. just fine but there was not an orange arrow to be found. We drove to the end of the road and found ourselves in what looked like someone's yard. We saw a 4WD road off to the left but know our Family Truckster was no match. We turned around looking for answers when God sent to very nice ladies who pointed out the turnoff and suggested that, though they had never done it themselves, we should find the old rail bed. Off we went seeing a few possibilities but we couldn't identify the old rail bed. We sat there confused when God again sent a very nice young couple who provided clearer directions and finally we found the old rail bed road. A 40 mile ride, as two semis sailed by us going the opposite direction chewed up the road finally dumped us out on the 105. We went five miles south to Dutchies to meet Nick, which happened. Off we went to the loading dock which was under water for the first half. Luckily NIck's crew was there to load our gear in the boat. We all wore our rubbers in an attempt to stay dry, but the rain snow mix started about then and lasted the entire trip to the portage. The only good thing about the higher than ever water was that the skiff that held our gear was able to run the falls! A short walk across the rock and we loaded into another skiff and finally ended up in camp with our gear already loaded on the porch. What a mess we saw upon our arrival. The main dock had lifted off it's moorings and was floating. Tied to the boathouse to hold it there was lots of pressures that I am sure will take a toll. While we were in camp the crew made a temporary access to the temporary new setup and by the end of the week had constructed a new set of stairs to allow us to get to the boats without endangering us. The water rose at least 6"" during the week and one of the newly constructed cabins, The Icehouse, is in jeopardy. It appears it will take years for the Lake to return to ""normal"" levels. We went out to see how the fishing might be but of course the opener was the next day so we just messed around for the afternoon in the sleet and rain, freezing our tushies off. The rest of the week, the fishing was kind of off and on primarily due to the spawn which was happening as the weather warmed and the water shot over 42 degrees. Through the week we had a great day at Anishinabi falls but did not repeat that level of bites as the week progressed. We ended up catching plenty of walleye to eat and pack out, but they had not grouped up as of the time we left. We had several walleyes over 24"", plenty in the 23's and most of them over the slot. Still we ate well. Smallies appeared at the end of the week and a brownback just under 19"" was the largest. We never fished specifically for large pike but two over 36"" were pulled into the boat We caught many smaller ones since, as you probably know, there is no shortage of snot rockets in most Canadian lakes. Trout were not to be found at the beginning of the week but Dock finished strong taking the largest one and a PB at 37 1/2"" He also caught two over 28"". He had one hooked and we got a look at it before it spit the lure and agreed it was certainly over 30"" All in all, it was a great week but I feel so sorry for the camps that are greatly affected by the high water, like Nick. In spite of it all, he and his crew had nothing but smiles as they worked to fix the problems and made sure we had a great time. We are scheduled back in July but booked in the Ice House, which right now is uninhabitable. On our trip back to the States on Friday (27TH)we were able to take Quilbell Road back to the 17. They are constantly working on this detour because so much is at stake. Hopefully it will stay open until the damage to the 105 is fixed It added about 45 minutes to our trip but the way Nick gets you in and out so quick we left camp at 6 am and were back to our cars by 7. PM if you want more information on our experience with the roads. Fish ON! Hooks"

6660320,Golden Eagle,2022-05-30 19:44:00,2642,"Pretty much the same for me except: I arrived May 18 and flew in May 19. Taking the Blue Lake detour, I looked at how muddy Quilbell Road was and didn't see the detour sign that instructed me to make the right turn onto Quilbell. I wasted about 45 minutes, but met a lot of nice people when asking about how to make it to Red Lake. I had to drive past a large truck that carried a large road grader. The truck was stuck in the middle of the road, in mud up to it's axles. We drove around it, traveling on a farmer's pasture. Yep, there were huge ruts. 4wh drive helped. 2 big rig tractor trailers got stuck in the field, closing the detour to traffic, but guys in 2 of our vehicles ignored the closure and made it on Friday. A bear, fresh out of hibernation, broke into the kitchen area and dining area of the main cabin, totally destroying everything it found. Later in the week she broke into a cabin while guests were having dinner. Not cool. Fishing was great. Walleyes tried to eat all of our jiggs. Big pike were eating Suicks and JSM. No live bait or dead bait was needed. All 7 of us had to buy rubber boots on the way up to Red Lake so we could wade from the dock to the cabins and to get to the fish cleaning house. I would have stayed a second week, but heavy rain is expected from yesterday through Wednesday or Thursday. I'm thinking that traveling from Red Lake to Vermilion Bay would have been difficult this coming Saturday morning. For now I've quit fishing. Until I'm back up yonder for the July 23 week. Hey Guys, if you're on the fence about fishing Ontario this season, get off the fence and do what you can to support your favorite camp owners. They've been good to us in past years or we wouldn't keep going back and now they need our financial support. Help them survive until they begin to show profit, which may take a season or two. What I'm saying is, don't try to pencil whip them on pricing. Absorb the surcharges they are facing. Not suggesting anything for you that all 24 in camp last week didn't do. We told our camp owner that he's been underpricing his product and we want him to be there for us in the future."

6664178,ILScott,2022-06-13 17:05:00,139,"Just returned from Wine Lake Camp. The water is really high and I think it finally peaked and it is slowly going down. We stayed June 4th to June 11th. Day 1 - Traveled to the south end of the lake system and had a good walleye bite and the two boats that went down there caught limits and we had a great fish fry the first night. Day 2 - Went to Beaver Lake and had to work for the walleye but caught a bunch and many pike. Day 3 -Went back to the south end of the lake. Caught walleye and my son thought he lost the stringer. While he was looking over the boat he accidentally knock in his rod in the lake. He went in shoulder deep but no pole just a wet head. He later caught a 37"" pike so he forgot about the pole. Day 4 - Went to Beaver lake and had success on walleye and of course many pike. That night two boats in my group went out ling fishing and caught 11 of them and kept 5. Also, back to my son losing his pole a person in my group caught it while fishing in the same place as we were. So my son was happy. Day 5 - Went to Beaver lake and had success on walleye and of course many pike. Day 6- Went to ghost lake and Turn Around lake and caught a few walleye but they are not schooled up in those lakes. The evening went to the falls and person in my group caught a 39.5"" pike and a half hour later I got a 40.5"" pike down stream.Once again many pike. Many people have tried those lakes this week with little success. Day 7- Needed two walleyes for the group to limit out for fish to take home. Fished north end and then went lake trout fishing with no luck except a keeper northern. The fishing was a little tough because all the factors we dealt with. First the water was really high and people in camp were catching walleye next to bushes and trees that normally are on land. The fish were scattered all over and hard to find a school until the end of the week. Surface temp started in the low 50's but warmed up to low 60's by the end of the week. We had unusual weather. Everyday was between 65-70 and not much for clouds and hardly any wind. The lake was like glass everyday and I have never seen it like that. But once again it was a great trip ate a lot of fish and great company. Can't wait until next year. ILScott"
