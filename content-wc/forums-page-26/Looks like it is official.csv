6690194,RickOnt,2022-10-06 07:30:00,217,What about a Canadian going to USA by land border? What are requirements? I am being told you still need vaccination Its confusing that they are different
6690448,Andre (wallyandre),2022-10-07 10:32:00,2274,I'm a Canadian and I croos at least 10 times since May and the US border officer ask me maybe 3 times if I was vaccinated and I am so I don't know what would happen if I was not but I'm pretty sure that would have no impact on my entry.
6690452,RickOnt,2022-10-07 10:42:00,217,Thanks Andre I was hoping you would reply It looks like a chance game.
6690654,jackpotjohnny48,2022-10-08 21:55:00,153,"Zenfish,In terms of the Upper Peninsula, unfortunately I'm sworn to secrecy on that one, because I was invited there by a friend who said he'd show me a few spots, provided that I agreed not to disclose the exact location. So I can't give that one away. But having said that, I think that the entire Upper Peninsula looks good (based on a few days I've spent exploring some other areas). I would suggest buying the ""Sportman's Connection"" map books if you want to explore the area. Sportman's Connection has two different guide books, one for the Eastern UP, and other for the Western UP.The Western UP seems to be the more remote of the two sections, as it's located further away from the Lower Peninsula, so I think there are some really good options in the west. However, the Eastern UP book contains places like Deer Lake Basin and Lake Michigamme, which both look really good to me. Based on what I've seen so far during the past 4 or 5 years in the UP, I think there's a whole lot of good water up there, with relatively low fishing pressure. Pressure seems to decrease the further west you go.As far as Minnesota, we went to Snowbank Lodge and Outfitters, located on Snowbank Lake, just 20 miles northeast of Ely.It's a very deep, clear, cisco based lake trout lake, which is actually my preferred type of lake for walleye fishing, since I enjoy trolling crankbaits after dark out in the middle of the abyss, looking for suspended trophy-caliber fish.So, we weren't expecting to catch a lot of numbers, as we were targeting quality fish. Much to our surprise, we did fairly well on the numbers (even when fishing suspended fish in 80 feet of water after dark).Based on what we saw at Snowbank, I think it has a very high walleye population, much higher than you would typically expect on an oligotrophic lake. Lots and lots of 15 to 17 inch fish.We didn't do real well on the size though. Biggest of the trip was 24 1/2 inches.I think the trophy fish may have been really turned off though. The weather was really cold, and really unstable. On a typical trip, we do well on warm, humid, muggy, calm nights when the mosquitos are out in really big numbers.On our Snowbank trip from August 6-13th, however, we had very cold, windy, unstable nights, and we didn't even need our mosquito netting suits. I don't think I ever wore my mosquito suit during the entire trip, and somehow I didn't get a mosquito bite the entire 7 days. But despite the weather conditions being very unfavorable, we still did quite well during the night bite out in open water.I think our best night, we ended up catching 17 walleyes between 9pm and midnight, trolling Smithwick Perfect 10s and Top 20s, running them 10 to 20 feet down in 80 feet of water.That's actually pretty good in terms of numbers, because the open water bite on lake trout lakes tends to be slower action, but with bigger fish. So I'm wondering how good it would have been had the weather conditions been more favorable.We didn't really spend a whole lot of time fishing during the daylight hours. Spent a lot of time sightseeing in Ely. But given the limited amount of effort we put into daytime fishing, we still did quite well on Snowbank, trolling jointed size 5 Rapala Shad Raps in 16 to 20 feet of water around island shorelines and points.So we went to Snowbank expecting low quantity but high quality, and we ended up catching high quantity but relatively low quality. We encountered lots of eater sized walleyes in the 15 to 17 inch range, regardless of whether we were fishing the shallow water structures (daytime) or out in the middle of nowhere (nighttime).Overall, our initial impression of Snowbank was that it's a beautiful lake (looks like Canada), with a surprisingly high walleye population given the clear, cold, deep, infertile water.Hopefully we encounter warmer, more stable weather on our next trip to Snowbank.Hope that helps,""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"

6690890,zenfish,2022-10-10 17:35:00,14,Thanks Jackpot. I used to live in the U.P. so I have a few honey holes there myself. Snowbank is one I looked hard at a couple years ago. Guess I should have pulled the trigger on that trip!
6688514,NM_Trout,2022-09-27 09:32:00,1094,Hey! You kids get off my lawn. I mean... stay away from my fish!
6688686,bigwalleye1,2022-09-28 08:17:00,2632,"Yee-Haw! I went twice this year anyway, but it'll be nice to see the camps and towns doing better, having suffered so long with minimal help from Ottawa."
6688988,ogilville,2022-09-30 07:38:00,262,I am very happy about the government removing the restrictions to enter Canada. My question is does anyone know the status of restrictions to be able to return to the US after entering Canada?
6688992,hoppy63,2022-09-30 07:49:00,367,I read where the random testing upon entry has gone away for entry via air but did not see anything for land entry. Does anyone have any solid info on this?
6689034,Spurgery,2022-09-30 10:14:00,79,"There are no longer pre-entry nor arrival tests to enter Canada. Period. Doesn’t matter if by air, ground, rail, etc…."
6689384,AsianAngler,2022-10-02 08:29:00,67,We've been back and forth across the border a number of times this season. No special reentry requirements for US.
6689394,hoppy63,2022-10-02 08:52:00,367,Thank you. I knew there was no pre testing but wasn't sure about the randoms
6689576,cuamb,2022-10-03 07:09:00,203,"Good for you Jackpot, I admire your decision to honor your commitments. Too many did not do that this year with Canadian resorts."
6690086,Andre (wallyandre),2022-10-05 13:08:00,2274,I just cross the border today and I tried to fill-up the ArrivCan but it doesn't work by car only by plane.
6690098,zenfish,2022-10-05 13:44:00,14,Any chance you'd be willing to share where you went on your UP and MN trips? &#x1f609;

6688288,RickOnt,2022-09-26 09:41:00,217,About time!! The mandate is way past its best before date I hope the outfitters have a busy year
6688320,farmnfish,2022-09-26 11:20:00,130,I'm one of Those calling.
6688322,Old Timer,2022-09-26 12:11:00,255,2023 will be an interesting year. Will all of those who sat on the sidelines for the past three years return to Canadian camps like they said they would? We'll see.
6688324,MrSimon,2022-09-26 12:29:00,922,Of course they will! I know I am.
6688328,jackpotjohnny48,2022-09-26 12:53:00,153,"I think I'll actually return in 2024, because at the time of taking my 2022 trips to the Upper Peninsula and northern Minnesota, I rebooked for 2023.I was assuming (at the time of rebooking for 2023 in Michigan and Minnesota) that the Canadian border would still be closed, for the foreseeable future, to those of us who did not get the vax.So, since I want to honor the commitments I've already made for 2023, I don't see any way that I will be able to go to Canada in 2023. (I just don't have enough free time left over, after committing to one week in Michigan and one week in Minnesota).So, yes. I do plan on returning to Pipestone Lake in NW Ontario, but I just don't see it happening until 2024. (And the fishing in both Michigan and Minnesota was pretty spectacular for us. Lots of really monstrous pike in Michigan, and very good numbers of walleyes in Minnesota. Better numbers than on Pipestone, but Pipestone had better trophy potential on the walleyes. So, I'm willing to wait until 2024 before jumping back into the trophy walleye hunting in Canada at Pipestone).""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
6688332,prov1800,2022-09-26 13:25:00,5010,Oh no.
6688354,RickOnt,2022-09-26 15:05:00,217,Oh yea!! I hope they are busy!!
