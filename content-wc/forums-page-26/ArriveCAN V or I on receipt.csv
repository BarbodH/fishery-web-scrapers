6589342,fishingfever,2021-08-12 04:37:00,85,My ArriveCan receipt has a V vaccination - please speak with the Canada Border Services Officer on entry to Canada on it. My buddies filled theirs out the same as far as we know and theirs says I on it. What does the difference mean? We had identical vaccination records as far as what vaccine we took and all were months ago. Thanks for your help.

I have been vaccinated in Canada and uploaded the proof provided by Provincial Gov. I wanted to know if you have any experience or knowledge on this matter. What does it mean?"
6619202,maddogg,2021-12-22 08:56:00,178,What does one do if they don't have a cell phone and has to travel 2 days to get to the border?
6619216,guidedfishing,2021-12-22 10:18:00,531,good question to contact Canadian customs with. If you are traveling with someone that does have a mobile phone they can list multiple individuals for entry on their ArriveCAN app. I have seen folks in our group list as singles and groups neither had issues.

6624052,Lokira,2022-01-10 20:49:00,1,V means your vaccination is was uploaded successfully but unable to be read by OCR I means your vaccination was successfully uploaded and read by OCR A means your vaccination was authenticated by provincial QR code.
