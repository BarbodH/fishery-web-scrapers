6692146,Pink Unicorn,2022-10-15 18:59:00,83,Has anyone been to Cherrington? I've heard good things about the Amik folks and looking for opinions on Cherrington specifically. Thanks in advance!
6692502,jambi,2022-10-17 10:09:00,504,"I've stayed at the Showalter's camp. Very big lake, but can split in two 'halves' being the west half deep and clear w/ lake trout and east half being traditional stained waters. We went early June 2014 after a late ice out. Water was cold but we still found walleye in a few areas but not in the deep water yet. Avg size here bigger, like 18-19"" easy. Had booked July 2020 blah blah I still want to go back."
6692596,Bstar,2022-10-17 14:42:00,564,We went to Cobham Lake with Amik several years ago. They're a top notch outfitter. You won't regret going with them. Can't help you out with a Cherrington though.
6692606,Pink Unicorn,2022-10-17 15:07:00,83,Would you recommend I go to the Schowalters camp? We're you finding walleye on the west end or is it mostly just trout?
6692622,Pink Unicorn,2022-10-17 17:07:00,83,That's what I've heard!
6692630,'Taterguy,2022-10-17 17:45:00,33,"I was at Cherrington a couple years ago. Fishing was good, facilities were nice, plenty of good fishing spots. We even saw a woodlands caribou. We went out to the big lake one day, it is a bit of a boat ride and it's a good thing I wasn't driving cause Ida been lost. We did go past the Showalter cabin, it is situated so that on a windy day it would be a booger to get away from the dock. Amik has two cabins on Cherrington, they are in the same cove but you can't see the other forom the cabin. I think we could see the other dock though. There is a third cabin between the two, it used to be the base of Amik's operation before they started running things out of Red Lake. The fish I remember the most from that trip was big. How big? Beats me. By the time I got it in the boat and untangled from the net I was trying to hold it against my abdomen to get the hook out and it pooped in the pocket of my rain coat. I couldn't get that fish back in the water fast enough. I was cold, I was frustrated and now I had fish poop in my pocket. It was upper 20's for sure. I have only been on fly ins with Amik so I don't have anything to compare to, but the guys I go with have been with other outfitters and consider Amik to be their favorite. John, Rena and the family are great folks, John is an exceptionally safe pilot, they are organized and accommodating. I've been on 7 trips with them and have two more planned for next year."
6692680,jambi,2022-10-18 09:16:00,504,I've used Showalters for a long time. Their camp is more centrally located on Cherrington. He built a new kitchen cabin a few years ago. There are some days when the wind is just right that it does blow into camp but that wasnt that big of a deal. There are a few spots in the big west lake that are true walleye madness in the summer. That is why i booked a summer vs a spring trip in 2020 but didn't make it. Amik is a great outfitter too. I haven't used but I would in a heartbeat. I'll PM you my email & phone number if you want to talk more about Cherrington. Scott
6693068,Larry S,2022-10-20 06:26:00,665,I was at Cherrington in 1987 when Loon Haunt had a cabin there. Had excellent walleye fishing at river at North East on lake We caught hundreds of walleye's on jigs & tails Also caught our limits of Lake trout. On guy got a 25 LB Lkae trout on a J-Plug Larry Schroeder
6693662,kona77,2022-10-25 01:44:00,236,"Our group fished Cherrington 5 times with Loon Haunt and it is a great walleye lake. We found fish on both ends of the lake and had great fishing in the ""Z-Channel"" that separates the two parts of the lake. Would always go in early June and also had some decent Lake Trout fishing a couple of years."
