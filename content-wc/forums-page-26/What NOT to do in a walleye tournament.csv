6690052,last chance,2022-10-05 11:36:00,3262,someone would come up with glass balls that wouldn't show up on a metal detector. but what they need is an X-RAY machine like used at the airport. but even then all money fish should be gutted and inspected for any foreign objects like other fish fillets.
6690060,grizzley,2022-10-05 11:56:00,2518,"I remember some of the bass tournaments where fish were wither placed in cages or just released in an area and then fished for figuring they wouldn't move too far, our local shad contest experienced the ""lead additive"" several years ago, now there's this! These guys got caught, I would guess there are a few that didn't!!!! Where there's a will, there's a way, often wondered if anyone was injecting water into the fish to add some weight,"

6690710,Obabikon,2022-10-09 08:01:00,2370,"Tournaments need to stop basing off of weight, and instead base off of length. Glad these guys got caught. They will be lucky not to end up with jail time."
6690976,tv4fish,2022-10-11 07:29:00,2694,"Code:Tournaments need to stop basing off of weight, and instead base off of length.I will agree with that ----- Just look at the difference in the weight of a big female right before she spawns................."

6689916,kettyspanky,2022-10-04 18:44:00,271,There has been cheating going on for years. All those that cheat sooner or later get caught. All those tournaments should be discontinued. That's just my opinion.
