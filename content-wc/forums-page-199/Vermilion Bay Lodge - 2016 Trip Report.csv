5422898,pjshorthorn,2017-03-25 09:15:00,5654,"Yup, you read the thread title correctly. This is the trip report from our late July 2016 trip. There is no time better to publish this report and video to get all of you pumped up for your upcoming trips this season. I might even get motivated to start tying up some new crawler harnesses with my 10 year old mono for our 2017 trip in June Some of you may remember that our 2015 trip to Vermilion Bay Lodge was full of strange happenings, some beaver dam jumping, a lot of relaxing, fun and a few nice fish in between all of the silliness we somehow created on a daily basis.Well, our 2016 trip was no different with the exception that almost the entire trip could be categorized into two distinct areas of ""oddities"" and ""pleasant surprises "". But hey, every fishing trip to Canada has some twists and turns that make it into a new adventure!!!!!There really was no clear explanation as to why so many odd things came up during the week, but it definitely made for an interesting and enjoyable time with some stories to be told for years to come.Stickman and I flew into Minneapolis to meet Gramps for the start of the journey. As we get on the 494 to head north to Breezy Point's place, Gramps starts telling us a story about how a stunning blonde keeps talking to him, from her vehicle, at every stop light on his way to a casino the evening before......I couldn't stop laughing as he thought she knew him from somewhere ?????? At 76 years old, I guess a fella can still get propositioned !!!!! Now that was a little odd.The drive to V-Bay Lodge on Saturday morning was easy with little to no delay at the Baudette crossing, but pee breaks for Gramps became a burden with a stop every 60 miles or so whether there was a bathroom or not......I had to cut him off from drinking O'Douls once we got past Nestor Falls.....geeezz. Once we made it to Vermilion Bay and started down the road to the lodge, we came to a brand new sign on the side of the road that said "" Eelpout Guide Service "". Huh??? First I had no idea that Eelpout existed in Eagle Lake nor that Gord had started guiding Eelpout excursions in 2016....that was odd????Our home for the week was cabin #3 again and everything was immaculate. It felt good to be back in camp. Then I hear Gramps yelling about how he can't get in the washroom to get rid of the last bit of O'Douls. Well, there was a sign on the door explaining that the washroom was now a ""pay as you go"" facility. What???? Really???? A Pee costs $.25, poo $.50 and a $1.00 for both ??? I didn't have time to worry about this kind of nonsense so I told Gramps to saddle up behind a tree and let it fly....geeezzz.Something was definitely different in camp this year......it seemed like every day there was a new sign advertising some sort of new offering. It was almost like the song "" Signs, Signs, Everywhere a Sign "". I really didn't think much about it until I saw the sign if front of the office that offered "" Moonlight Canoe Trips - Clothing Optional "". What the heck, had the camp turned into another one of those Hedonism resorts ???? The fishhouse was now "" The House of Gord - Worship Services Held Daily "" ???? Hey, who am I as a guest to question a business owner on how to make money.....a small donation at a worship service adds up over a summer I guess ???? Do Moonlight Canoe trips have to be rescheduled if there is no moon ??? The weather was pretty variable throughout the week with a few days of good wind and rain. That did put a damper on the Moonlight Canoe Trip business I'm sure, but it did turn the walleye fishing on. Most fish were found on mid lake humps and reefs anywhere from 10 - 28 fow depending on the structure. We pulled cranks and jigged primarily, but I found on those windy days the best presentation was drifting a crawler harness on a bottom bouncer over the structure. There were some pretty bumpy days with 2+ rollers, but that was a small price to pay. Our 18' upgrade boat handled the water well and we were comfortable even with a little bumpy weather. I will say that after 4-5 hours of rolling along in the waves, it does make for an interesting time when back on land. Apparently Gramps was affected a little more than others by the waves, one particular day, as he had a hard time keeping his toilet aim on target.......too much swaying I guess. The next day when we came in for lunch, there were wave wackers installed on the wall behind the toilet. About mid week I mentioned to Gord that Stickman and I wanted to try one of the remote lakes during our stay. We had not done much smallmouth fishing in the past and I thought that would be a great adventure to try. Of course the best lake for smallies was the furthest one to get to. Gord asked if we were up for a true trek into the bush, ""It is not for the faint of heart "" he says. After we established that guided canoe trips were not part of this adventure, my thought was......bring it !!!! Gord graciously offered to take time away from camp, which is rare, to go along with us and make sure we would have a great experience. It was what I will always consider "" The Trip Within The Trip "" and it was a trek, but an amazing time for my son and I. I think Gord had a good time making fun of us a little bit. It ranks in the top three trips I have taken with my son in Canada. His first trip to Lac Seul when he was 10 years old, this remote trip and our trip to V-Bay Lodge in 2016.After 4 boat rides and 4 portages on foot, we made it to our destination lake to fish smallmouth and northern. I would venture to say that it took a solid 90 minutes to hike and boat in once we reached the first portage, but it was well worth it. We caught 34 fish trolling and casting various baits ,including topwaters, over the course of a few hours with an 18 1/2"" smallie and 34"" northern being the best fish caught. We were only the second group that season to fish this lake and we could have stayed all day...the fishing was that good, but the weather was stormy. At one point a crack of lightning hit pretty close to us just as I was casting. Ummm Gord, time to hit an island. Gord says, holy crap, I thought that flash was your lure when you cast out. We pulled up on shore and waited for the storm to pass, catching fish frequently from the island we were on. It was a wonderful experience and one I hope to do again this year even though we did sight a Sasquatch on the hike in.As I mentioned, the weather was variable with good winds and rain on occasion ( that is summertime fishing ), but we managed to catch some walleye, northern, smallmouth and perch. The best walleye was a 27"" fish caught on a crawler in the heavy chop. We did not boat a musky this year...that is Breezy's fault though since he is the musky master. I guess I should have been guiding him again on this trip as he boated a 47""+ fish due to my precision helmsmanship ( is that a new word ?) on LOTW during a prior trip we took in June. Stickman did hook a musky on his UL rod and it was one of those slow motion moments when it made a nice leap and then was gone just that quick.I would be remiss if I didn't mention a few other things that stood out during our visit which were very pleasant surprises. Gord continues to make nice upgrades each year to the cabins and facilities. Two cabins had new spacious screened porches added over the winter...I'm guessing a 10' x 20' addition on each. The rumor is that our cabin is receiving a screened porch for this season and another cabin is being expanded to give guests a little more room during their visit. It will be so nice to enjoy the evenings on the porch without fighting the skeeters. Rumors also include that Susanne has made him build a new outbuilding further away from the lodge to hide his hoarding addiction of everything and anything.Although this is not an American Plan lodge, the housekeeping aspect provided as part of one's stay, is outstanding. Linens, pillows and Hudson Bay wool blankets are provided. The cabin receives a touch up cleaning and towels are changed, twice during the week with the bathroom being cleaned as well. I think we got a third bathroom cleaning due to Gramp's poor aim ...sorry Bonnie !!!!Gord had a boat slip with a handpole reserved for our upgrade boat so Gramps could hold on when getting in and out of the boat. That was a huge help so he didn't pull me into the water or the boat helping him get in and out.Sunday's fish fry in the lodge....., yummy......one of the best with whitefish as the main course. Our group having a nice ribeye dinner with Gord and Susanne with other guests joining the party as they wandered into the lodge....that was a lot of fun.And without a doubt, the best change in 2016 was that there were two lovely ladies that met you at the dock each time you left or came back to camp. Imagine having a person that greets you with , "" It so nice to see you, how is your morning going or how was your day ? "" vs. some crusty old guy eating a liverwurst sandwich, with poutine cheese in his beard who just wants to know, "" Did you catch anything ?"". I hope these two lovely ladies will be back this season.With all great Canadian fishing experiences, they come to an end, but great memories are born and old ones renewed. I'll end with a new memory from our 2016 trip; outside of everything written so far in this report.On our first full day of fishing, Stickman and I had to return to camp to get some more crawlers due to my inability to count worms. Yeah, I know....rookie mistake. As we started walking to the cabin, Gord met us and asked "" Did ya catch anything? Hey, do you know anything about a sign on my road that says Eelpout Guide Services? Someone put up a fancy sign."" Of course, I told him I didn't know anything about who may have put it up, but I smiled all the way to cabin thinking about the fact that he had been pranked by somebody in camp. Now that I think about it....maybe there is a correlation with all of the other signs that showed up in camp that week. Oh yeah, last year I posted some events from our 2015 trip that would qualify for the Weenie Award and everyone voted for Breezy Point for peeing in his own boat since he didn't notice that the cap was missing on the bucket. This year no voting is needed. Gramps wins the award ""hands off ?"" for swaying and spraying the entire bathroom ( call it poor sea legs) that required wave wackers to be installed on the walls surrounding the toilet for the rest of the week. That is classic.As we pulled away from camp at the end of the week, I noticed an old tractor. Wouldn't you know it, on the front of the tractor was GORD. Who names a tractor after themselves.?????? That is just odd.Thanks for reading and hope you enjoy the video too.PjShorthorn"

5427634,pjshorthorn,2017-03-27 06:41:00,5654,"Howdy Jeff,Wow, your trip with Doc is coming up quick !!!! Don't give up on those spinner rigs. Put them on a bottom bouncer when it is windy and drift or use a trolling motor if you have one on the camp boat. If not, the main motor may be slow enough for you back troll against the wind. You'll catch fish I hear you about the old man dribble syndrome. Just don't be a sway and spray guy like Gramps. The person using the washroom after your visit will appreciate it.We may make it up to ND for a game this year, but I leave that up to the wife since she is the alumnus. The daughter and her husband are going back in a week or two so he can participate in a reunion of the 2014 National Championship soccer team. They are jazzed up to see a lot of friends. It would be nice to share a couple of brews again on campus so I'll let you know if we get plans in place. Retirement ???? Where am I going to get those sweet pink tennis shoes with shamrocks that you were always able to find me ?.... LOLWe should do a trip together at the House of Gord . I can show you how to push all of Gord's buttons and have him a tizzy by the first full day of fishing. We could even take a quick fly-in to that remote lake for SM fishing It would be a hoot to spend a trip with you and Doc. Keep me posted on your retirement plans.PjShorthorn"
5427658,pjshorthorn,2017-03-27 06:46:00,5654,"Thanks Capt. There are always some laughs in camp when I'm around. Everybody is usually laughing at me Oh well, there always has to be one court jester in the crowd ....LOL PjShorthorn"

Gord and Susanne are 2 of the friendliest people around. We were very impressed with the cabins, boats and all around layout of this camp. Even though we only brought home 4 fish we didn't hesitate to re-book for 2017, This year will be end of July into August. Now if he would only get wifi in the cabins lol. Best to luck to all who are staying at VBL"
5471658,v-bay gord,2017-04-13 17:13:00,3168,"I guess I can refer to you as the ""Red Demon"" from now on! I must say that it was a slow week, although Breezy Point was also there which makes me start questioning the caliber of anglers on the water...?? Regardless, I was pretty much gob smacked when you rebooked as you were paying your bill. Now for the average WC reader, these were two fairly large, mostly unsmiling guests questioning whether there where actually fish in the lake. Seemed most of my recommendations didn't produce which does happen.......just ask Susanne. There was good reason for the average angler to chock that trip up as a lost cause and move on....apparently you are too stubborn. Your upcoming late July / early August trip this year will be better, even if I have to set the hook for you. I commend your ability to work through the tough times............."
5471818,pjshorthorn,2017-04-13 18:49:00,5654,"Red Demon , Send me a PM if you want any info. On how to make Gord's life more interesting than it is already. I have a few Super Secret Squirrel Spots that I can share with you that even Gord doesn't know about. We will be there the last week of June so hopefully I'll find a few more spots that I can help you out with...... PjShorthorn"
5472890,Ricky Spanish,2017-04-14 09:11:00,1298,"reddemon, did Gord even suggest that you sprinkle some tobacco on Spirit Rock to change your luck? Shame on him if he didn't. It worked for Jeremy Wade. It was tougher for us the 3x I fished Eagle in Sept, too. I like June/July best."

I felt a tear come to my eye, and a lump in my pants. My take from this video is this. The experience is so much more than catching 100 fish per day. Those that can recognize that will always be happy campers... Here's to everyone having a fun time in 2017..."
5424882,retire55,2017-03-26 08:35:00,1029,Thanks for taking the time to put together your report and video. Very enjoyable.

I was somewhat concerned that you may have been converted to using ""Si ""instead of ""eh"" in your conversations moving forward. As a reminder, my pennings are always truthful and only as deep as your ugly anklet boots. Pull that tissue out of your sleeve and wipe away the tears. It is time to cowboy up and be a big boy again.

5425834,HeHooksHimself,2017-03-26 14:05:00,725,"Pat, now I have to try to get some work done while snickering at your video and post and trying not to think about leaving for da nort in 53 long days. I really enjoy your insightful perspective and find myself turning into Gramps since I am having trouble hitting the water as I get older and having to wipe up after myself when I use the bathroom (particularly at other people's houses). I also wanted you to know that I am not giving up on those lindy rigs you sent me even though I can't get 'em to work like you do. Maybe it is only if you pay as you go or leave a tithe at the House of Gord, which I am planning to do some day. I think it is a time of the year thing for me. Are you coming to the Land of the Irish this year? If so I would love to sit on the steps and tip another Kokanee with you and discuss how hard the game of football is for some teams or try together to figure out what the heck they do in all those new buildings on campus. Someday, we have to spend some time together in Canada. I can't imagine how much fun we could have, even if we had to spend some time at the House of Gord. I have my eyes on retirement this year so I might have a little more vacation time! Thanks again for the post, can't wait for soft water! Fish On! Hooks"

I sure took a lot of blame during the week, but I can't accept the accusations that Gord made that week. I would be lying if I said I wasn't a little nervous about what might come up during our week in camp this year. Hope you are doing well and getting ready for your new adventures this year.

That is V-Bay Gord's other brother named Gord. Gordon Lightfoot is Canadian and I really enjoy his music so it is somewhat fitting to use it for a video of our trip to Canada. PjShorthorn"

5424322,pjshorthorn,2017-03-26 01:42:00,5654,"Keith, You pretty well summed up the way I view my trips. Catching fish is always a bonus, but not really the main priority for myself. I get more enjoyment watching everyone else have a great time and along the way some silliness just happens. Those become my lasting memories. I'm not sure Mike would really want to glean anything from my writing style. If he adapted anything from my ""random creativity "" approach, folks would most likely start whispering behind his back and we surely don't want that to happen.... I would agree that Mike doesn't mention pee in his publications as much as I do. I guess I need to do some self reflection. I may have a peeing problem that I need some help with.... PjShorthorn"
