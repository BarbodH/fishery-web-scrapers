These boats do not have any kind of ladder to re-enter the boat should someone fall out of the boat. Fortunately, this has never happened to me, as I would be on my own given that I fish by myself quite a lot. This happened to a good friend a few years ago. He was unable to re-enter his boat, even with his wife helping him.I was wondering what you guys might use on your personal boats that could be taken to Canada and used on a lodge boat. I came across this item on the Cabela's website:http://www.cabelas.com/product/LEWIS...Dboat%2BladderAny suggestions? Good fishing and tight lines!!"

Having ladder in an available position from the water is also something to consider. One suggestion that has been shared is try to step on the skeg of the non running motor, and, assuming it has electric tilt, engage the tilt to lift oneself in. This obviously would not be the preferred entry procedure, but could be used if alone, etc. Bill"
5459978,last chance,2017-04-08 06:34:00,3262,I was alone fishing the Intracoastal water down in fl. I fell out and had a very hard time getting back to the boat. I made it to the back of the boat and after resting for a few minutes I was able to use the cavitation plate on the motor to make it back in the boat. now when I fish the Intracoastal or fish alone I wear an automatic inflate life jacket.
5460522,PatSea,2017-04-08 11:11:00,112,One simple method is to have a short length of rope tied to the transom within reach from the water. The rope should have one or two loops tied into it for foot holds. Simple but works.
5466514,Mojo-NC,2017-04-11 09:51:00,1929,I looks like a good idea to me and the other suggestions are excellent as well. Another consideration - in case you fall out I've been told do not wear boots when fishing because if you do fall out you cannot swim while wearing boots.
5466610,Multispecies Guy,2017-04-11 10:41:00,447,Trailing a rope is a technique I've used frequently when fishing solo on cold water. I have knots in it to make grasping it easier but hadn't thought of loops for a foothold. Thanks for the tip.
