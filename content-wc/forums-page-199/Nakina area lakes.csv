5448994,onetimedave,2017-04-04 05:37:00,502,"Take a look at Brace Lake. GREAT young couple doing everything to make your trip successful. You also have Ara, Meta Lakes and Meta river to fish along with Brace."
5468434,Herkyhawk00,2017-04-12 07:23:00,33,"Had taken my three children to Brace a couple of years ago on Mike's advice. Unfortunately never got to Ara with the kids and all, but I really liked Meta while we were there. Brace has a beautiful cabin setting. Kyle and Teri are really great people and Kyle is such an interesting guy to talk to. Meta was interesting as we fished primarily in 4-6 ft of water the whole time. Never have I come up on places slowing the boat down and literally seeing several Northern darting off in different directions around me. I have no doubts that in an hard day of fishing, you could easily pull in 40+ Northern. I love Northern fishing so it was pretty exciting."
5468706,Mike Borger,2017-04-12 09:04:00,1554,"Most people who go to Brace don't bother with Ara, there's no need."
5439874,fsz,2017-03-31 08:01:00,144,"Considering a trip to one of the larger Nakina area lakes. Esnagami, O'sullivan, Abamasagi, Ara, Meta, Brace, Stone. Open to other lakes as well but we would want to come in less than $1,000 CDN. Also want decent average size (say 18"") and a reasonable chance to get a fish or two over 22"" each day. I'm guessing this is most possible on the larger lakes as opposed to some of the tiny ones. We prefer to troll for walleye then once located, jig. In other words, we don't like to have to troll all day to get decent numbers of fish. As such, a darker water lake is probably preferable but not a requirement if we can find the type of fishing we are looking for. We target pike here and there; of course a 40"" plus would be nice but being able to catch decent (not necessarily ""high"") numbers of pike in the 30-36"" range is what we would be looking for. Fishing is fishing (not just catching!), but for a fly in I would want to be able to have a realistic chance at averaging 75 walleye per two fisherman per 8 hrs of fishing time. We are easy to please as far as the cabin and for that matter boats. As far as outboards, quality is important to us (we can tolerate a few rivet leaks, but motors that are hard to start, don't troll smooth, won't cut it). With the above said, we are looking for the best ""value"" in the area (fishing quality, remoteness, good outboards, price). ."

5439954,vteye2,2017-03-31 08:15:00,123,"Hello Fsz - I've only done 2 trips out of Nakina. The reports I've read on all of the inquired upon lakes will suit your needs. Suggest using the search feature and then PM the person who sent in the report for add'l details.This site is great, folks are wonderful about providing details of where they have fished, tactics, baits, etc. We fly in for our third trip in 2 months an 9 days."
5439978,Mike Borger,2017-03-31 08:20:00,1554,"Abamasagi was fantastic for me, just incredible numbers of walleye! Pretty sure it's within your budget.Also had an amazing time at Brace but it might not fit budget-wise. However my advice would be simply to call the outfitter and talk with them, often they can be really accommodating.I've heard tremendous things about Stone. An MNR bio in Geraldton told me it was the most underutilized lake in the region. Very clear water, a lot like Ara, with good numbers and size of walleyes. If AMS is still operating on Stone I'm fairly sure they'd be within your budget as well. Nakina North Outfitters (new to the game) has a camp on Percy and I know their prices are well within your budget too. The owner Mark Cassidy seems like a very nice young man as well and from what he told me the camp is really nice. I think you'd like that lake, it's a good one.Esnagami is a pretty great choice as well, zero doubt about that, but again may not fit your budget (I could be wrong about that).There are more great options and the honest truth is they're all pretty great. Doubt you'd have a bad trip anywhere north of Nakina."
5440130,fsz,2017-03-31 08:50:00,144,"Wow, thanks for the quick replies guys! Had my eye on Stone didn't know what the water clarity was like so thanks."
5440490,adempsey2.0,2017-03-31 10:36:00,612,"As mentioned, ALL great optionsCouple more to think about if you're interested in lodges.Kagianagami Lake. Definitely a lake for both numbers and trophy potential. Lake Trout too.http://www.leuenberger.ca/housekeep.html$1290 Canadian INCLUDING TAXWent in early July, fish were still moving in from spawning grounds. Once we hit the incoming rivers it was gangbusters. Walleye from 14 to 22"" non-stop, many smaller pike and even got me one 40""er. Caught a few monster whitefish too. Didn't fish for lakers much, but others in the camp were pulling in some really nice ones. We had some bad wind for most of the week though, which made travel tough many days. Onaman Lake.http://www.onamanlake.com/Haven't been, but would love to."
5440746,Mike Borger,2017-03-31 11:54:00,1554,"Both great options! Regarding Bauer's camp on Onaman, it's just an unreal fishery. The biggest issue with that camp is getting a booking. They're constantly booked solid.I think if I ever fish Kag again I'd stay at one of the outposts (either Twin Lakes or Mattice Lake Outfitter's)"
5441050,adempsey2.0,2017-03-31 14:51:00,612,"For sure. The nice thing about the Twin Lakes camps is their location. You might as well be fishing a different lake unless you do some serious milk runs across the lake. The camp on Van Poele Lake is an option too. Probably an excellent one if the fish are still migrating. That's where we fished, the outflow from Van Poele and it was insane."
5441066,fsz,2017-03-31 15:10:00,144,Onaman is on my radar. Fished it last year one day in Sept. Not many boats out at that time. We did well. Just concerned it might not have a remote feeling in the summer with the boats from the south end plus near full bookings for Bauers. Plus not sure we'd get many decent pike. I know some of the lakes I mentioned will have some traffic as well. Never considered Kag I'll have to look into it.
