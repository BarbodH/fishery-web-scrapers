5436194,Baseline,2017-03-30 07:06:00,3207,I like the shorter days in the fall. Lower light conditions last longer in the AM and come earlier in the evening. The walleye bite stays strong. We take a break about 2:00 in in the afternoon for a big mea. Out again for the evening bite and back in by 7:00 which allows for plenty of campfire time. Fall is just a great time of the year to be up north.
5436210,Baseline,2017-03-30 07:14:00,3207,"By September the rug rats go back to school and the schools activities/ sports start, the husband and wife teams came in the summer and are back a work, lots of guys start their hunting seasons, etc., etc. All these factors make it difficult to put the larger groups together and travel long distances. Much less traffic and not so busy resorts makes for a great trip. Saturday border crossings become 15 minutes instead of 2 hours.PS: I have cut some very sweet deals with a few of the resorts for a Monday-Friday stay in the fall."
5436602,The tank,2017-03-30 08:35:00,340,It's funny too me that so many like September. We was the lucky ones the year we tried September and hit a week of record lows with sleet and cold rain. For two days it was so foggy it was hard to see on the lake. Walleye fishing was though but we did alright. But that was our first year on the lake. Not going to stop me from going again I think I'm going mid September this year. Nice to see all the positive post on September it's making me want to call and get a week in the books more and more.
5436682,BornToFish,2017-03-30 09:00:00,1224,"Greetings,I was reading through this thread and thought of two points to mention as follow-up to a post by Mojo-NC. Others might benefit from these thoughts as well. I have spent many weeks fishing on lakes in NW Ontario during mid to late September. It's far and away my favorite time of the year to fish, for many reasons as set forth by others. There are two noteworthy things about fishing in NW Ontario at this time of the year.First, you can experience the best of the fishing season's weather, and the worst of the fishing season's weather, within the same day during later September. I caught my personal best musky five years ago during a blistering sleet storm. You would never have known there was a sleet storm by the picture that was taken of me holding my fish.Second, I have met many fishermen during September that normally fished during the opening weeks of the season. Most of these fishermen mightily struggled during their week of fishing in September. They were fishing the same techniques and places that they normally fished during the opening weeks of the season. They simply failed to adjust for the seasonal movements of the fish species they were targeting. One thing about fishing on many lakes in NW Ontario during September is that the walleyes are typically bunched up on off-shore structure. The depth of water holding fish is often much deeper than many anglers are comfortable with or have experience with. If I can pull up to a off-shore rock hump during September and catch one walleye, I am thinking ""game on!"" as I then know where they all are. I might fish for several hours, and catch dozens of walleyes, and never move the boat more than fifty feet.If you think you can handle the weather, I encourage you to consider fishing in mid to late September. However, do your homework and understand where the fish will be located, such that you can have suitable techniques and equipment to pursue these fish. Your lodge owner and possibly a guide should be able to get you and your group off to a good start.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5436778,Mojo-NC,2017-03-30 09:34:00,1929,"September/October has always been my favorite time to go to the NC beach or to the Outer Banks for a vacation. The reason being the crowds are gone, the restaurants are still open but no longer busy with waiting lists, the locals are much more friendly, and off-season discounts are fairly significant. Using this same analogy, I would like to assume that a September trip to Canada might be similar. It would consist of other fishermen who were more welcoming and helpful in identifying a fishing pattern that would work to help us out rather than being competitive and keeping it to themselves. Would that be a correct assumption? I wouldn't say our current lake is busy, but the boats do tend to stack up in certain areas during the prime season and other guests of the lodge are not overly friendly or willing to share their successful techniques."
5436930,SterlingArcher,2017-03-30 10:04:00,92,"I have gone in June, July, and August, and had fantastic trips in all three months. My core group has settled on late June/early July and made it semi-permanent for a few reasons: 1) The longest days of the year mean the most fishable light. We have some real nuts in the mix (myself included) who are keen on fishing pre-dawn til dusk many days, and at the time of year we go, we can fish 17 hours in a day without worrying about safety. 2) Great multispecies fishing. It's not the best time of year for pike, but it's usually really good. We can either find them in shallow bays or in transition spots on their way to their summer haunts. Same with walleyes. Most years, they are either in or on the way to their summer hangouts, which allows us to fish all over the lake and pile up both numbers and size. Ditto for lake trout. 3) Little risk of cold weather, though this time of year does bring the occasional thunderstorm. We are all trained to keep an eye on the sky, and find shelter until the popcorn storms pass. Getting wet doesn't bother us as much as getting cold. I'm hoping to get up to Savant Lake in the fall sometime to test the fall bite, too."
5437330,Pooch,2017-03-30 11:57:00,4618,"I'm hoping to get up to Savant Lake in the fall sometime to test the fall bite, too. It's as good as any..... Especially if you are targeting lakers and larger than average walleye.Pooch"
5437378,BornToFish,2017-03-30 12:20:00,1224,"Greetings,I've noticed a few things about fishing in NW Ontario in September. One is that the camp's overall ""atmosphere"" seems to be more relaxed in September than earlier in the season. For example, the lodge owner and staff are working ""shorter"" days, simply due to there being less daylight. The staff is getting more sleep, but this doesn't mean they are getting a lot of sleep.The lodges generally tend to have completed most of their bigger projects for the season. The lodge owners and staff are gravitating towards their lodge shutdown projects. This shift of focus can also lighten the lodge's atmosphere.Guests in September tend to be more experienced anglers, rather than families with young children or other novices. The experienced anglers generally don't need as much attentive care from the staff. Anglers in September typically know where they are going and what they will do when they get there. Again, fewer demands on the lodge owner and staff lighten their load and things are more relaxed.Many lodges offer promotions during September as a way to increase traffic. For example, some lodges offer a ""second angler at half price"" autumn special. This might be something to pay attention to when shopping for an autumn fishing trip.I believe there is flip side to the above observations. Some lodges offer various hunting packages during the autumn, along with their standard fishing packages. If so, I'm left to wonder if the lodges are geared more towards hunters, rather than fishermen. If so, will fishermen be more or less on their own?Based on my experience alone, I don't know as though anglers are any more or less willing to share information during September than they are at any other time of the year. Saying a heart-felt hello, offering a hand shake or beverage can go a very long way to building a network. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5442554,LoDo,2017-04-01 15:56:00,721,"Dad started taking me to NW Ontario at a young age. I haven't stopped. I personally prefer June and late Aug/Sept. As mentioned the fishing spots in June are completely different in late Aug and Sept. General rule is you have to fish much deeper water. Fall fishing is for the more seasoned fisherman. 30'+ humps in the middle of the lake hold big walleyes and northerns. If you like to troll, you can still do this at these depths. Its a blast! 20' deep runners are fun over these humps. 36""+ northerns are found with walleyes on deep humps. Spring fishing is probably easier which is perhaps why more families w/ kids go at this time. That and most folks believe summer is their favorite season and a spring fishing trip is a great way to start your summer. Spring holds most all species in the shallows and near spawning areas. Jig n minnow will catch all species in 6-15' of water. Lastly a common mistake for many is spending too much time in one area they've had luck with in the past. Fish move and you need to do the same. If you haven't had a bite or caught fish within 10-15m, its time to move. Tight lines!!"

5437458,Ricky Spanish,2017-03-30 12:59:00,1298,Got that right! I have been fishing out of a certain lodge on Eagle Lake for quite a few years and can point to some very reliable spots right from my barstool. A couple more if we go out on the deck. I just can't listen to someone talk about only catching a few fish all day without offering to help them. We have received our fair share of alcohol based tips in return.
5438274,Pooch,2017-03-30 17:39:00,4618,"July through Mid September. Have had some really uncomfortably cold Labor Day trips, too. Like some have mentioned above the later in the season the more settled down things are such as weather, boat traffic, road traffic and camp atmosphere as their summer rush is gradually winding down. Fish are tending to be fatter and many times more of a strong bite is happening when you are in the right place at the same time.Actually, anytime I can make it to Canada and there isn't ice on the water or my rod tip is my favorite time. Do appreciate a good wood burner and tight cabin as the season progresses.Pooch"
5434562,The tank,2017-03-29 12:35:00,340,Opening week or two for smallmouths and crappie have been great for us. Walleyes can be good but I like mid july to late august for walleyes. My wife can get her fill of the sun and I cautch a ton of walleyes. Everyone's happy. Some days the high sun makes it alittle miserable but theres a sand beach close usually. I like that time for musky also. Couple hours early morning and a hour or two before dark.

5434946,Multispecies Guy,2017-03-29 15:57:00,447,Interesting that so many people cite less traffic as a good reason to go in September.
5435146,Obabikon,2017-03-29 17:59:00,2370,"It is... but I also notice that is when many of the ""serious"" fishermen come. Not a lot of casual fishermen take the time to post on fishing websites. At least with our resort, many family trips are done in June and July while some are out of school."
5435162,fishron,2017-03-29 18:05:00,317,This year we're going to try the walleye opener in southern Ontario. We haven't done this for many years preferring to fish in late June and again in late September. The last time we tried an opener trip in Quebec we engaged in boat to boat snowball fights and froze our !!! off. In Southern Ontario we've had all kinds of weather but hopefully we'll catch a decent week. The fish will be biting regardless so all that's left for us is the ability to feel the bite.
5435258,Mojo-NC,2017-03-29 18:53:00,1929,"****it, now you guys have me all fired up to take a fall trip. I like everything that has been said about going up North in mid-September. Now I just need to convince the rest of my group to switch from spring to fall. That could take some doing but I trust they'll believe you guys. Thanks!"

5436130,Mojo-NC,2017-03-30 06:48:00,1929,"^^^I'm looking for the silver lining in this response^^^ Does that mean I won't be waking up at 5:00 AM every morning when the sun starts coming up as it does in June??? It's a good point, but I think I can live with it. We generally don't fish after dinner and the older I get the less important I consider it to get up early."
5436170,Mike Borger,2017-03-30 07:02:00,1554,"September can be amazing, I really like that month as well, but beware. This is what we woke up to on a September trip to Whitewater Lake a couple falls ago."
5436178,BornToFish,2017-03-30 07:03:00,1224,"Greetings,In the spirit of finding the silver lining, I will note that I fished a particular lake in NW Ontario that was notorious for having an early morning and evening walleye bite. There were occasional days that I would have a good mid-day walleye bite, but in no way could I ever count on something like this to happen.It's true that there are about three hours less daylight in September compared to June. This means to me that during the day, I have three hours less waiting for the next good walleye bite. I'm exchanging these three hours during the day for three more hours of sleep during the night.Fishing during June can be a real grind. I would fish until 10:00 p.m. or so, asleep by 11:00 p.m. and up again at 4:15 a.m.. I would feel the lack of sleep by the end of the week, just in time for a long drive home.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

Probably done a dozen or more trips in Sept and I have to say, We love that time the most !! Cooler temps, usually stable weather, fishing is really good, and NO BUGS ! It seems once You establish a pattern, it sticks for the whole week (or 10 days, as We have done) Unless there is a severe weather change....

I have fished in NW Ontario in March, April, May, June, July, August and September. However, my favorite time of the season is mid-September, for the reasons mentioned by Obabikon. It's very rewarding to me to be the only boat on the lake in mid-September - just me and the fish!Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5431458,vteye2,2017-03-28 12:02:00,123,"We have fished in various parts of Canada from ice out - shore ice at Kayedon in late may. Early June at Kayedon, mid to late June at Gouin,last week June at Lac Albanel and late July early Aug to Baffin, Island not counting numerous family vacations New Brunswick, Quebec City, Montreal, Nova Scotia, etc.The one consistency is the great friendly people you encounter and typically fantastic fishing. Yeah the bugs can be bad early season and crowds can form at touristy spots like Nova Scotia in July. The people are great, eager to assist people from other countries, US an elsewhere and fishing is always great. I just look forward to my next trip to Canada.PS Yeah have a few stories to tell as a result: outdoor disco at Quebec's City' carnival at -10 farenheit, like spectacular northern lights or having to cross ice berg's one after another carrying a guide freighter canoe as the wind changed and started pushing us out of Pangnirtung fiord.

Truly enjoy working the shorelines, as well as fishing the rivers; and not knowing what will bite (walleyes, crappie, Musky, Pike, SM Bass, etc). Also enjoy the early weeks of September, with no bugs and cooler weather. Roads and lakes are less populated, and the fishing can be excellent.

5430506,Mojo-NC,2017-03-28 07:41:00,1929,"We usually head up to Canada around the first week of June when the fish are a few weeks to a month or so post-spawn. One year a couple of us had kids graduating high school the first week of June so we went opening weekend instead. It was a very cold spring that year and we arrived only a couple of days after ice out, so the walleyes were pre-spawn (2008). The fish were really stacked up in a relatively small area and we caught a lot of very nice fish, but because everyone on the lake was fishing the same general area, it wasn't an enjoyable experience but instead a race to see who could get to the best spot first. Most years the fish have spread out over the lake by the time we arrive and we catch them anywhere from 6-14 feet deep. One year we had a mayfly hatch while we were there that impacted the fishing somewhat. We've also experienced a lot of weather during that time of year - rain, wind, snow, sleet, cold, and one year it was beautiful and pushing 90 degrees F. We go up prepared and we deal with the elements because the fishing is generally good to great. What time of year do you go and do you choose your week based on the fishing, weather, bugs, tradition, or based on some other logistical reason like company shutdown, etc?"
5430538,Obabikon,2017-03-28 07:51:00,2370,My absolute favorite time of the year is mid September. Absolutely no bugs Cooler days Typically stable weather Less traffic Some of the best fishing of the entire year for all the species (except bass)
5430586,wallydave,2017-03-28 08:04:00,2151,"We started fishing the NW section of Lac Seul in late May early June. The post spawn bite was great, lots of traffic, no fun. Last couple of years September trips have been great, less traffic, the fishing has been great too! Less bugs to deal with, nothing like a nice campfire after a great day of fishing! For me I like Ontario for the peace and quiet, the fishing and the scenery not to mention Northern lights ! Each season has its perks and problems​, give them a try and determine which one fits you the best."
5430610,Bstar,2017-03-28 08:08:00,564,"We typically go in August for the stable weather, long days and somewhat lack of bugs. If we're lucky we'll see the Northern Lights. We've had great fishing on mid lake humps and deep points. Usually in the 15-22 fow. I've never been up in June so no way to compare but we're more than happy with the fishing in August. Usually not as crowded. This year we'll be at an outpost on Aug 12 so crowds won't be a problem anyway. We have gone as late as the 1st week in Sept."

Actually, I'd prefer to always go opening week, a week or two earlier, but the other five guys in our annual early trip are locked into Memorial Day. Minimal to no bugs. Weather is variable but usually do not have to suffer through hot, sun-burny days. Beside walleyes, the big draw for me is the Cliff Lake trout up in 2'-20' of water.2.) Last week of August thru late September. Among my most memorable Ontario trips over 40 years are the solo trips I've enjoyed during late summer/early fall. Little traffic, no crowds (on the water and even in Bobby's), no bugs, usually great cooler weather, good fishing, and quiet . . . blessed quietness. Aaaaah .......... I just talked myself into planning a fall solo trip that hasn't been on the schedule."

Been there every week of July, the first couple weeks of August, and a couple times in mid-September. Never had a bad trip. My favorite is probably early August but it's hard to wait for. Usually warm weather, less bugs and bears, warm enough water to swim in, and the walleye are on their summer patterns. Then we escape the summer heat and humidity of southern Minnesota. Oh, can't forget the fresh blueberries."

I guess my favorite time of the year has been going on opening week in May or the first week of June. The fishing has been great for me during that time and there is just something about having a fire in the stove to dry out and warm up when getting back to camp. As I get older, I may change my mind about the colder temps and unstable weather,but I actually enjoy fishing in the rain. For some reason, it feels like everything just slows down that much more when fishing in the rain and the bite can be more active. PjShorthorn"
5431074,Mike Borger,2017-03-28 10:23:00,1554,"It depends on what my objective is. Strictly speaking walleye I love August. Cooler temps, few if any bugs, and very easy predictable fishing."
