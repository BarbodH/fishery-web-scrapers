5479066,KevinSB,2017-04-17 07:51:00,73,"Tank, I appreciate the ideas on where and how for June lakers. We've picked up some nice pike where you mention in Aerobus before. I also appreciate the suggestion that the suspended fish we found may have been whitefish. Thanks again!Kevin"
5479250,warrior2090,2017-04-17 09:00:00,12,Been going to Peffleys (and previous owners) in September since 85. Dave does a great job. Will be there again this year (opening week in May and closing week in September). You get more fishing time since you aren't making the long boat ride to get to the best fishing.
5479378,billy weaver,2017-04-17 09:40:00,470,"I also have been going to Peffleys since the days it was Morgan's. I have fished in May, June and August. I finally settled on the forth or fifth week of the season (early June). The first week was sometimes too cold for my old hands. My question is how would you compare September with maybe early June ? I usually like to fish the west side of Mean or around Doe as my favorites."
5466266,pjshorthorn,2017-04-11 08:05:00,5654,"Well, let me offer a pre-retirement congratulations!!!!!!. My BIL is going with us this year on his first trip to Canada and he will literally be officially retired one week when we go. It should be a blast to watch him unwind during the trip. There is no way to make Gord's life better. We can only hope to make it interesting while we are in camp. It would be great to have you and Doc along on a 2018 trip adventure. Check out the lodge's new website. They just posted some pictures of updates to a couple of the cabins which will be very nice for our group. The wife briefly mentioned that our daughter and her husband wanted to meet up for a game,but we are limited by their schedules this fall. Right now it sounds like NC State weekend, but I'll keep you tuned in as I know more. If it were me, I would just casually drift into some of those new boats and trade a little paint. Rubbing is fishing........a little rubbing rash never hurt no one.......unless someone gets poked in the eye with a rod or a pike is launched into your boat and latches on to a sensitive body part....and such. Enjoy the trip and I'm sure you'll post a literary masterpiece of the trip upon your return. Be safe and have fun. PjShorthorn"
5466330,billy weaver,2017-04-11 08:26:00,470,"I figured the first week of the walleye season, you were probably fishing for lake trout at the portage where room is very restricted and the only route between Wabaskang and Wine. If that is the case you would be a lot closer to Wabaskang than Wine."
5467074,HeHooksHimself,2017-04-11 13:43:00,725,"Yeah, there are some groups of guys from WLC that will go back to the portage to try to hook into a trout there. We prefer to troll for them in some of our best spots with crankbaits. They are so much fun to catch this way cuz the fight like he** and when they see the boat they always take another run. We have Anishinabi Falls and that is where the incident I described took place. I have seen people on the Wabby side of the portage catch trout right in that little bay though. Lots of water, lots of fish. 37 days. Good luck to you at Wabby Billy, hope you have a great time! Fish On! Hooks"
5467418,billy weaver,2017-04-11 16:06:00,470,"I know some guys that fish at Wine Lake Camp. Have you ever ran into some guys from Burlington, Iowa? They use to go up and cut ice with the former owner. I think they use to go the first week sometimes. What do you think of the new owner? I went up to Wabby the first week a couple of times but after running into 10 inches of snow I switched to the forth week. My hands don't take the cold very well anymore.Good fishing, please keep us posted on fishing, conditions etc.Billy"
5468698,HeHooksHimself,2017-04-12 09:03:00,725,"I am very familiar with the Iowa boys. Usually about 6 of them who stayed in the Moose Cabin, if it is the group I am thinking of. They partied pretty hard. At least one of them was a doctor who got a little crazy in the wilderness. They were drinking beer before they left the dock. They have not been there the last two years I think. New Owners- Nick is not Herb, which has it's advantages and disadvantages. I am not sure that Nick is as skilled as Herb when it comes to keeping things in good shape. Herb's experience as a carpenter served him well. However, Nick is more like one of us. He knows what a good experience at a resort is. Herb and Ann got better with this the last few years, but the thing that annoyed me about them was the nickling and diming. Want a boat seat? 20 bucks! Want to try a portage lake? 50 bucks! Want an electric start? 25 bucks! Nick is not like that at all. He doesn't feel that he should charge extra for portage trip nor does he sweat the small stuff. I think Nick has kept the best parts of what Ann and Herb were about, especially great interest in preserving the fishery. They are very interested in keeping the breeders in the water and eating the eaters. His kids are awesome, especially Maddie who is there the most. She enjoys Wine Lake Camp almost as much as we do. I am very excited to be departing northern Indiana for there in 36 days! Fish On! Hooks"
5470578,eyegator,2017-04-13 08:41:00,29,"Has anyone here fished Wabaskang in September? I was kicking around an early/mid September trip to Peffley's, but I've never fished Wabaskang at all. How is the fall fishing on this lake, and Peffleys in particular?"
5470626,The tank,2017-04-13 09:10:00,340,I would go mid September and stay at Gawleys Parkview camp. Pretty much get the same for less money drive right up to the cabin and dutchies store just 1/2 mile away. I'm sure Phefflys is a good place but it's not as convenient as others on the lake. All the years I've stayed up there and have been on walleye central I've never read or seen anything bad about Phefflys. If you want to boat in or drive in would be the difference.
5470690,eyegator,2017-04-13 09:57:00,29,I really don't have a preference where I stay- I am more concerned about how the walleye fishing is on that lake in September.... any thoughts on the fishing up there at that time?
5470914,KevinSB,2017-04-13 11:15:00,73,"Best friend and I will be up for the annual trip to Wabby starting June 3. We've never had luck for lakers, mostly I think because they've gone deeper most years. (We have fished the following week about half the time.) We did some deep jigging near the island in Aerobus Bay with little luck.Also, last year we spotted fish down deep at the very NE part of Second Lake - basically just E of Big Nose against the rock walls. Would those have been lakers? They were at least 40' deep in early June but wouldn't bite. I'd have guessed they were too deep for 'eyes that time of year but regardless the fish wouldn't bite (mostly spoons and jigs with minnows).Anyway, we've never caught a single laker, although it's true we haven't targeted them much. I've tried jigging deep especially in Aerobus Lake but that's about it. Any tips for ideas we might try in early June? Thanks in advance for any input!Kevin"
5471018,The tank,2017-04-13 11:48:00,340,We've caught them on crank baits and whistler jig on the way up into aerobus on the left hand side where the private cabins are at. We fish 8-16ft of water. The bay behind Indian island toward the A frame can hold them in early June. Not that I know everything but my guess the fish you marked might have been white fish.
5462194,Guest,2017-04-09 12:39:00,0,bill could you call me or email ( if you want me to call you)jim wolf [email protected] 9542054808 fort lauderdale fl appreciate it would like to talk to you about camp and lake jim wolf
5462714,Joek3,2017-04-09 19:07:00,244,"Great fishing on Wabaskang and portage lakes. Make sure sure to take the time to portage to Wine lake and all those fisheries. Respect the catch and release rules and all is great. Given that anyone who camps on Wine takes the same portage, if they feel you shouldn't be there, they couldn't be more wrong."
5462770,HeHooksHimself,2017-04-09 19:28:00,725,Didn't mean red boats aren't welcome. I will wave at you as you putt by. Doesn't mean I can't cringe when you bump into my boat so you can anchor at the falls I happen to be fishing. I will just smile and go fish elsewhere and come back later. But that portage is rough and the fishing is really bad.
5462802,pjshorthorn,2017-04-09 19:35:00,5654,"You are a glutton for punishment aren't you Hooks ? Terrible fishing, rough portages, etc........ PjShorthorn"
5463258,UKBDM,2017-04-10 07:19:00,178,I'll be at Jim and Julie's on the south end for the 8th year in a row. Great fishing all over the lake! We usually find the walleye in 8-12' of water in or near the emerging weeds. Last year was an earlier spring and they were deeper or transitioning to deeper structure.
5463266,HeHooksHimself,2017-04-10 07:22:00,725,"Just stirring the pot, Pat"
5463274,pjshorthorn,2017-04-10 07:26:00,5654,"It must be a Notre Dame thing You guys have to be down to less than 40 days by now, eh ? PjShorthorn"
5463386,The tank,2017-04-10 08:18:00,340,I like wabaskang early in the year. For what we have found first part of august can be the toughest time on this lake. I will say the reef on the north side of doe can be hot and the flat on the south side of the island just south west of peffleys can be hot. It's not easy to find but when you find it; it can be really good. We've got into some good pike fishing for size on wabaskang. For walleyes its just not a numbers lake like others we fish that time of year.
5464274,billy weaver,2017-04-10 14:36:00,470,"Good news, Peffley's new boats at black, won't be long and you won't have to cringe."
5466130,HeHooksHimself,2017-04-11 07:32:00,725,"Pat, 37 days until departure. By the way, all indications are that retirement is happening at the end of the year. Let us know when you plan to be at VBL in '18 and perhaps we can schedule the same week and collaborate on ways to make Gord's life better! Keep in touch. Billy, thanks for the news! By the way, I don't really cringe, there is plenty of spots on the Wine Lake system. This year should be great for opener as it sounds like the spawn will be over and we should be rockin' the walleye bite, pike will be beat up but hungry and trout will be shallow. But of course the fishing sucks and the portage is rough. My reference is that I did have some Peffley guys putt right into the spot we were fishing and anchor. After casting right next to their boat we just figured they didn't get and we moved on. Fish On! Hooks"
5454178,sheepman,2017-04-05 18:39:00,98,"Anyone going this year? Our group is headed up September 17, never been up that late ever. Any tips or places to go? What is the lake trout fishing and big pike like that time of year? Any information is greatly appreciated!"
5454362,billy weaver,2017-04-05 19:59:00,470,"I have been going to the Peffley's Camp every year for 28 years. I have been to other lakes but I like fishing Wabaskang. It is like 5 lakes connected by narrows. Usually there are places to fish even in windy conditions. I go in early June and sometimes in August. The lake can be feast or famine sometimes. For a example my boat caught over 100 walleye one day last year but could only get 2 in the boat the next day. I have had people tell me the fishing in July is very tough. August and September produces some big pike while June can be tough for big ones. I have always fished the north end of the lake but never the south end. I can send you info on the north end but nothing on the south. The last 10 years has seen some good smallmouth fishing, fish to about 19 inches. I have never caught a Lake trout in Wabaskang as they are very deep when I am there. I have seen guys catch a few using down riggers but I don't fish deep enough 30 ft. max. they are fishing 50 to 60 ft.. If I can be of any help let me know."
5454874,Guest,2017-04-06 04:04:00,0,keeper we have group going to peffley's 8/5-12 we wanted to go last week of September but some fishermen could not make it : housekeeping 4-6 out of Chicago we have done about 40 trips to Canada fishing 75% walleyes (jigging and trolling) 25% northerns (casting and trolling) I know august can be hot and difficult fishing ( we might go out early come in around noon rest eat and go out around 4 to 10 ;owner stated lost lake (catch and release portage lake can produce good numbers of walleyes ??) is it worth a trip have you guys gone?? any suggestions of areas to work and depths for walleyes in august?? probably stay within 5 miles from camp we are using camp boats appreciate any suggestions or help jim wolf Chicago boys
5455898,billy weaver,2017-04-06 10:05:00,470,"Lost Lake is a trip we always make and its a blast. I would recommend a couple of the younger guys make a trip early in the week weather permitting. The trail can be muddy the last 50 yards if there has been a lot of rain. The bugs can be very bad on the hike but not to bad on the lake. In any case use plenty of bug repellant and even your rain suit top on the hike over. The lake is small I would say about 200 acres (guess) and round. The boats are on shore upside down and the 4 hp motors are in a box along with a gas can. We fish the north shore and when we find fish we anchor and fish straight down in about 12 ft. of water. Drop your jig straight down raise it up about 6 inches and let it set. About every 15 seconds give it a light slow jig. Usually you will feel weight and then fish on. We use a half a nightcrawler on a 1/8 oz. jig sometimes with a plastic grub. It is hard to believe that there is that many fish just under the boat.If you fish the hour before dark ask Peffley about the ""Hotel"". It is hot spot just before dark where you anchor in 10 ft. of water on the edge of deep water and fish like you do at Lost Lake. It is just a short run from the camp and easy to navigate in low light.Good luck on your trip and if I can provide any more info. let me know.Billy"
5458562,Guest,2017-04-07 09:02:00,0,dear sir any suggestions where to fish for walleyes and northerns early august maybe a couple of bays or general areas you like to fish ;we probably stay within 5 miles of camp are generally not roaming all over the lake thanks again on all your help are there any other portage lakes worth visiting jim wolf Chicago boys
5458906,billy weaver,2017-04-07 10:58:00,470,"In August we fish the west side of what is called ""Mean Lake"" which is the far northwest body of water on Wabaskang. There is also good fishing south of the camp around Doe Island. Peffley can direct you to these locations and both are close to camp. We fish a shallow water bay northeast of camp ""Gawley's Bay"" in early June but it doesn't produce in August for us. If you have a nice day you might consider a portage to Wine Lake and Beaver Lake. There is a boat portage at the far northwest corner of Wabaskang into a small river that will take you to Wine Lake and then into Beaver Lake. It is very scenic and the trip is worth the effort. I like to fish Beaver Lake and have our annual shore lunch. There is a nice location for a shore lunch at southeast corner of Beaver. There is some good perch fishing in Beaver along with walleye. Get the lake map on Peffley's website its a pretty good topo. Check Wine Lake Camp's website for info on Wine Lake. If you have a nice day without the threat of wind and rain I would highly recommend a trip to Wine and Beaver Lakes.P.S. The portage to Wine should be made with camp boats a bigger boat wouldn't be possible. (On purpose)"
5459474,Guest,2017-04-07 17:54:00,0,dear sir thanks again for some spots to work will definitely try them our group actually stayed at wine lake about 7 yrs ago (very poor fishing the last week of may (very disappointing ) fished hard 10 hrs /day never had a great day we probably went into beaver also :the portage getting into wine lake was rough I think our group will stay with lost lake and the other spots you suggested thanks again please report on your trip when are you fellows going ??? jim wolf Chicago boys we are also going the last week in may to the last resort about 1 hr north of kenora run by the Indians on the English river will report
5459618,billy weaver,2017-04-07 19:27:00,470,"We are going the week of June 17. That is a little later than usual because of the late start on the walleye season. I was a little surprised you did not have any luck at Wine Lake. We go directly to Beaver Lake when in that area. We usually always catch nice fish. The Lake Trout guys fish Wine Lake south of the camp in the deep chute with down riggers. I have fished a lake near Kenora the end of May or first week of June. The smallmouth were getting ready to spawn and five pounders were common. (Black Sturgeon). In any case ""Good Luck"" Billy"
5459778,Joek3,2017-04-07 20:43:00,244,"Have fished Wine, Beaver and other lakes accessible when on Wine. Absolutely a fantastic fishery."
5459986,HeHooksHimself,2017-04-08 06:40:00,725,"As a veteran of Wine Lake, just go with what Wolf says, poor fishery, rough portage. I will be there for the opener and we always cringe at the red boat invasion. But then again, we have covered this before, havent we?"
