2899673,Mike Borger,2014-06-15 12:55:00,1554,"Just returned from Dayohessarah Lake with White River Air. Dayo is a lake trout lake which was a nice change from my usual pike/walleye trips. The lake is a beauty, about 8km's long, clear, deep and rocky and filled with trout off all sizes.Dayo is known for trophy sized fish but we didn't get any giants although we did have our chances. One in particular was easily over 20, perhaps even 25. Was a real heartbreaker when we lost it!Despite that fishing was amazing for fish in the 2-6lb range. They were abundant and fought like crazy, lots of fun!We caught them flatlining stickbaits and cranks as well as deeper with leadcore rods/reels. The most fun by far was jigging for them with light tackle though, what a blast. white X Zone Swammers, white tubes and twisters all worked rigged on heavier 11/2-2oz jig heads. Hopkins jigging spoons also caught a lot of fish.If you're interested my full report with lots of photos can be seen here:http://www.canadafishingguide.net/wh...trout-bonanza/I also made a fairly lengthy video of the trip with lots of cool underwater footage and some nice fish which you can see here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0meBvFcS2kCheers, Mike"
