I found an edited un-posted video today from a Perfect Weather day out at Ucluelet Last August. I uploaded to youtube and posted the link above. This is out on the Banks about 4 to 6 miles off shore.http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a3...827_145417.jpghttp://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a3...827_021054.jpghttp://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a3...827_020105.jpghttp://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a3...827_013948.jpghttp://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a3...826_181209.jpg
