5471082,The tank,2017-04-13 12:14:00,340,Yes I did. I go two times a year and never had any problems before that day or after.

5462130,v-bay gord,2017-04-09 12:03:00,3168,I believe for the last couple of years the border has been granting these on a one time basis in the cases where there is only one offence and it is between 5 to 10 years old. Your best bet would be to contact the border office where you will be crossing.
5463930,Baseline,2017-04-10 12:43:00,3207,"There are a number of attorneys who advertise to smooth the way for the permit. You can do it yourself by consulting the Canadian Immigration Offices. There website has the process detailed. I know they changed some of rules around, but it is hard to get a straight story about it. Like previously suggested a call to the border location where you will cross would be my first step. One our group had a 2009 D-dub and couldn't get a permit until he was off probation in 2015. He had an aggravated charge because there was a passenger in his vehicle that was injured when he hit a tree."

5465338,Ghost,2017-04-10 19:12:00,43,"What's ARD?[/QUOTE] Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition, in a nutshell it means that she was never convicted of a DUI, theres a class involved but no DUI on her record, it can be found but only with a court order I believe. Now her driving record, thats another story."

If you have a conviction and Canada considers it a felony you can't enter without a permit. That's what I think so take it for what its worth."
5465690,The tank,2017-04-10 21:13:00,340,At the border you have two organizations. Customs the one you talk to at the window and imagration the ones on the inside. When they run your passport imagration are the ones looking at that. They are hooked up with the FBI and it will show up on her FBI record. Everything you've been arrested for or got a ticket for is on that. I know this for a fact. I was arrested in 2008 for a DUI and found not guilty. So in 2010 at ft Francis they pull me over and tell me to come in. 45 minutes later we have a talk. He said my DUI came back as a non conviction so he run it again. I asked how he found that because it was never on my record that's when he told me everythings on my record FBI record he's not looking at your dmv record. All my tickets I got court supervision on are all on there. So if you can look at your FBI record and it shows on it as not guilty or charges dropped that would help. Not sure if that's possible or not.

Homelands must not of wanted me back. LOL. I started going with a big group that has been going up every year for over 20 years and they've had ppl with DUIs along before. In their experience as long as it's been five years they haven't been denied entrance. They had a guy one year that had been convicted of DUI 4 years prior and he was denied. Wife had to make the 16 hour round trip to pick him up at the border.What's the typical punishment in Canada for a DUI? Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
