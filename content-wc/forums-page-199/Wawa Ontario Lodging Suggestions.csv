5324193,Overwatchmike,2017-02-09 20:30:00,201,Unfortunately I'll be home by the time you guys roll into town or I'd offer you a free nights stay at my cabin.... problem is you wouldn't want to leave! Sent from my SM-G920V using Tapatalk
5324257,pjshorthorn,2017-02-09 20:49:00,5654,"Poutine seems to be this national Canadian treasure and all these years I have never tried the dish. Do French fries, gravy and cheese qualify as a dish ? LOL. Subconsciously, I may be hung up on whether you can eat these fries with ketchup or is that a major faux pas in the realm of Canadian fine dining. Actually, I may be even more hung up on why Canadian bacon looks like a piece of round ham instead of those nice fatty strips of pork that can be served with almost anything ,and there never be a question if it breaks dining protocol. These are things that make me ponder life in Canada while drifting along in the boat waiting for a nice walleye to become the next volunteer to be fried and wrapped in real bacon ..... PjShorthorn"
5324265,pjshorthorn,2017-02-09 20:52:00,5654,"Well, thanks for the offer!!! You may be right about the leaving part.....I'm pretty handy at grounds and structure maintenance so I could earn my keep if necessary .....LOL. PjShorthorn"
5324273,Overwatchmike,2017-02-09 20:53:00,201,And cheese whiz on every table in the restaurant! If you have a couple extra minutes to spare you have to go into the grocery store! It's like the testing ground for new flavors before it hits the states. White chocolate Reese's was there a year before the states.... ketchup potato chips.... same thing..... I will say that I am glad All Dressed chips are now offered in the states! Yummy!Sent from my SM-G920V using Tapatalk
5324281,pjshorthorn,2017-02-09 20:58:00,5654,I'm starting to think that I may not ever make it over to Eagle Lake for fishing with all of these spots to stop at and try some food PjShorthorn
5328665,Rls825,2017-02-12 10:50:00,9,"I have also stayed in several Wawa hotels and agree that Mystic Isle, just south of town, is probably the nicest. The restaurant right across the street ( walk across the highway ) is very good. In town the 'North of 17' Restaurant is excellent for breakfast."

5472642,pjshorthorn,2017-04-14 07:38:00,5654,Just a quick note to thank everyone for all of the suggestions and tips regarding our new adventure driving around the north shore of Lake Superior. I think we have all of the logistics stuff nailed down so now it is just the waiting game in order to kick off the trip. All the help has been very much appreciated. I'll be sure to include feedback on our travels as part of our trip report to Vermilion Bay Lodge at the end of June. Thanks !!!! PjShorthorn

5319881,Crackback,2017-02-08 02:19:00,257,"Don't do it unless you want to do it for the first time.....the Drive to Thunder Bay is 2 lane, slow and boring. It will take you 8-10 hours just to get from the Soo to Thunder bay and it will add and extra day if your fishing destination is Northwest Ontario. Traveling the length of Michigan's U.P to Duluth, MN is just as bad. I can get on Michigan's I-94 west and boogie to I-80 and North on Illinois 39 and shoot straight north through WI to international Falls/ Ft Francis at 65- 70 mph and be in Northwest Ontario in no time flat!"
5320033,UKBDM,2017-02-08 05:54:00,178,I would concur with the above. I'm from central Indiana and we went thru the Soo one year due to flooding in Duluth. The scenery is great but I will never do it again. Added 4 hours to our trip compared to going thru IL/WI/MN to IFalls.We fish on Wabaskang which is north of Vbay.
5320073,pjshorthorn,2017-02-08 06:07:00,5654,"I've driven your suggested route more than I care to remember and there is no ""no time flat"" timeframe associated with the route as you suggest. In reality, both routes from our starting destination to final destination are within 15 minutes or so of each other and I'm not in a big hurry........... PjShorthorn"
5321393,kzoofisher,2017-02-08 15:22:00,5144,"Interesting debate on times. According to Google maps it the trip to Eagle Lake would take me about two hours longer to go up 17 instead of around Chicago. I'm sure this assumes that I would have no traffic slowdowns in Illinois which is assuming a lot. Heading north from my house the traffic thins out in about 1 1/2 hrs and its an easy cruise to Wawa, set the cruise at 5 over and don't worry about a thing. Last time I drove 94 into southern Wisconsin it was heavy traffic from the on ramp in Kalamazoo 'til we got off the highway near Lake Geneva. How far north from there do you have to go before the traffic lightens up?"
5321593,adempsey2.0,2017-02-08 17:13:00,612,"Sure! Sounds like a plan. Not sure on our ETA though, but I am guessing around the same time or a bit later."
5322593,Bstar,2017-02-09 07:26:00,564,"I live in Northwest Indiana and we take I80 west to I355 north to I90 west which will take you into Wisconsin. The traffic definitely lightens up once you get north of Elgin,IL on I90. I might add that we leave at 4am and the Chicago area traffic is pretty light at that time. You can also take Crackback's route which takes you farther west on I80 to I39 north but it will add some time and mileage to your route. The I80 to I355 route runs on the outskirts of the Chicago area and is best to be avoided during the rush hours of 6-8am and 3-6pm but it still is better then taking I94 thru the city. It takes us approx. 10-11 hours to get to IFalls depending on our stops which includes a sit down breakfast in Stoughton,WI."
5322625,pjshorthorn,2017-02-09 07:34:00,5654,"Mapquest has the Chicago route ( through town ) 23 minutes quicker than the Hwy. 17 route. The third route through the UP is about an hour longer than Hwy. 17. Going way around Chicago to I-39 and north to I-90 is at least 40 miles longer. That additional mileage can easily be offset by traffic in the Chicagoland area, but according to Mapquest the time difference is negligible.In all the years of heading through Wisconsin on the way using I -90/94, we never planned on traffic thinning out until we were north of Madison, and that was assuming there was no construction on the highway north of Madison. The unknown time factor is crossing at I-Falls on Saturday morning vs. the Soo on a Friday night. It can be 2 hours waiting in line at I-Falls.......not sure what the wait in the Soo would be on a Friday night. Regardless, I will have two long days of travel no matter what route we choose to take. As long as I catch my flight up and back ......all is good. Driving and reminiscing about trips gone by are something I look forward to so windshield time is not a big deal. Remember, I'm used to sitting in Atlanta traffic daily. PjShorthorn"
5322633,Bstar,2017-02-09 07:41:00,564,I agree. There is no easy route from Georgia. I have driven the route through the Soo on 17 as far as White River. I can tell you it will be slower because of the 2 lane road and the reduced speed limits but the scenery along Lake Superior is spectacular. If you have the time and your not in a hurry then it might be worth going that route just for a change of scenery.
5324177,Live to jig,2017-02-09 20:20:00,159,"Love the town of Wawa, stop there every year on the way up and back for some of the best Poutine and Burgers. It is a true tradition for us. It is just into the town past Tim Hortons on the right. I stayed at http://www.bestnorthern.ca/ with the wife last year and it was really nice we had our own cabin with everything for maybe $125.00 us."
5315865,pjshorthorn,2017-02-06 07:09:00,5654,"Thanks for the help Mike ! I was able to get reservations for both ends of our trip at the Mystic Isle motel. Free cancellation policy and a really reasonable rate for a room with two queen beds. The Wawa Moter Inn looked nice too with comparable pricing so I'll keep that place in my hip pocket for future trips. Thanks again, PjShorthorn"
5315873,pjshorthorn,2017-02-06 07:14:00,5654,Thanks for the suggestion. I always enjoy stopping in a local trinket shop to stretch and see what they have to offer. Is that on Hwy 17 ? PjShorthorn

5317433,Bstar,2017-02-06 19:07:00,564,High Falls motel has nice clean kitchenette cabins and motel rooms. Mom and pop type of operation. Very clean rooms and nice owners. Reasonable prices and very good tripadvisor re views. Embassy has a good breakfast and Young's is a must see in Wawa.

5313913,Mike Borger,2017-02-05 05:48:00,1554,"Pat, having stayed in Wawa many times I have my favorites. I don't like any of the motels right in town. Best one I've found is the Mystyic Isle a mile or so south of the cutoff to town on hwy 17. It's way up on a hill set back in the trees with zero road noise. Shockingly nice rooms that you can back your vehicle right up to. http://www.mysticisle.com/Right in town I really like the cabins that the Wawa Motor Inn rents. You go down this steep hill next to the motel and there's a little village of cabins tucked away down there. VERY nice! Maybe even cheaper slightly to rent one of those chalets rather than two or more motel rooms side by side if you have a big group.http://wawamotorinn.ca/index.php/our-facilities/On another note, the Kinniwabi Pines also right on 17 not far from the Mystic Isle has the best food in town in my experience."

Pretty great wings.If you want a sit down breakfast the Embassy is good and open early.
