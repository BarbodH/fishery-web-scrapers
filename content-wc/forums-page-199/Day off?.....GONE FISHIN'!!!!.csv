The ice is worse than I thought, drilled a couple holes in the morning and although there is 18""+ it is honeycomb already for the most part, auger went through it like a hot knife through butter, guess its down to the thaw we had earlier in the year and then almost zero snow since without a mother thaw afterwards. the crappie decided to show up on my spot on Wabigoon really late, oh well, will be hunting them in the boat pretty soon. The walleye I caught in the evening were at another lake just up the road. I usually quad all the way there from my house across the lakes and skidoo trails but wanted to take Roloff with me so we trailered up there. Landing was toast and had to travel half a click to find ice strong enough to walk out on, drilled a couple holes, same deal as Wabigoon, 18"" of honeycomb sketchiness, lol...so I jumped on the quad and pinned it to my spot. Got 4 walleye, one female 3 males, not anywhere near their spawning ground yet, which was a good thing for me as there was no way I was going near the creek! Here's the video as usual.https://youtu.be/QdQ-kZb1gYI Tight lines all!"
