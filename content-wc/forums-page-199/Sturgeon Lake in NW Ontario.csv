5468522,fldoc1,2017-04-12 08:02:00,69,"Our group went to Trappers Point Camp a few years ago in early August , 2014. The new owners went out of their way to help us. Our group split into 2 groups, one going mostly to a nearby smaller, stained lake and did well with mostly walleyes. They needed my 4X4 as the landing was more difficult. Sturgeon Lake is big, with clear water, and is known for its unmarked dangerous rocks. On the first day the owners took us all out for a ride and we marked some super dangerous spots on our depth finder. They also guided us that first day and casting the the shores with the Mepps Syclops (orange) was the lure they recommended. There are some great bays facing south about 15 miles down the lake and we fished them hard with little luck. (I would think they would be excellent in early June) Later in the week we started fishing for northerns off points and drop-offs casting into the deeper water farther out from the point and started to pick up more / nice northerns. We fished some for Lakers (spots they recommended) and got some. Our crew are not laker fisherman. My hunch is if you like fishing for and catching lakers it could be a very good lake. We trolled with downriggers but did well jigging big, white jigs. I do not know much about Whiskey Lack Lodge but looked at their web-site and liked that they had a good number of small lake options. I have heard very good things about Squaw Lake. Summary - I am fascinated by the lake and it nearby smaller lakes. The owners of Trappers worked hard for us. If you would go in early June the walleyes should be near the camps (stained water) as the camp areas are in a no-fishing sanctuary. There was not much fishing pressure on the main lake when we were there in early August. Randy from Duluth"

5469114,Bill Krejca,2017-04-12 12:54:00,6107,"We fished the lake in early spring quite a number of years ago, camped at a resort on the north part of the lake. We were not hugely successful on walleyes, but I believe that was mostly our fault, not familiar with the lake, nor willing to make any longer runs*. We did quite well on trout, not far from camp, caught them all on still fished meat. The lake is a great and interesting body of water, probably still under fished. *It would be wise to understand where the many reefs not shown on the map are at, get the lodge folks to show you, one way or the other; do not take the map as being completely accurate, even folks who have gone there for years occasionally discover a new obstacle.

Walleyes are very abundant if you get them found. Like Bill says, Its got a lot of ROCKS and obstacles so pay attention to the camp owner's instructions. The Navionics map for the lake is pretty good too if you decide to give it a try."
