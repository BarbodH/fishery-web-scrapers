Well the ice is too sketchy for my comfort level now and so its time to get inventive for fishing opportunities while we wait for the ice to go. Still another 4 days till walleye season closes so I headed to a small dam an hour away from my place. There was plenty of room to cast as it turned out. As I was arriving a group of 5 people were leaving, they had a bucket with them and I thought it was full of fish, turns out it was empty and they had caught NOTHING! Undeterred I set up a slip bobber and cast up current, first pass and the bobber went under and I pulled in a nice walleye that proceeded to cough up have a dozen fresh minnows, lol, looks like it had fun with the group that just left. No other bites despite walking 1km up and down the shore eventually returning to where I caught the first one. It was bloody cold and only the fact that I had to drive an hour to get there kept me there till it started to get dark, glad I did as the bite was insane! Got four keepers and some smaller ones went back, and it was really cool to see thousands of glowing eyes moving around the shallows in the dark with the aid of my headlamp, can't wait to show my boy Jack. Did not manage to get any footage of that as the footage was too dark too see but here is the video of some of the fish I caught.VIDEO LINKhttps://youtu.be/UlQMNjnaP5Q Tight lines all, open water season is upon us!"
