5469810,515,2017-04-12 19:05:00,254,One of my favorite fly-in lakes. We found fish bigger than average size for both walleye and pike and again the lake was a bigger than average size lake for a fly-in lake. Venture over to the falls at Elbow lake and you'll find some huge walleyes at the falls into Elbow and you can fish it from shore there easily.
