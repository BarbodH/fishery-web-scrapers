5464250,mjayn,2017-04-10 14:33:00,1188,Very nice. Looks like the Bonham slam... 3 drums.
5466058,pjshorthorn,2017-04-11 07:16:00,5654,"It sure sounds like you had a very nice visit to the Big Easy. A couple of nice fish doesn't hurt either. That 30"" fish is a beauty and I bet it put up a nice fight. Out of curiosity, did the guide catch the bait you were using or do you think it was purchased ? When I would fish reds in the March timeframe, we would always have to buy bait as it hadn't typically started to show up yet due to water temps below 70 degrees. Shrimp is a go to bait all year long, but cast netting big shad was always a preferred bait for catching decent sized redfish. Attached is a picture from many years ago when my son and I had a magical morning where we caught our limit using shad, in about an hour, with other fish released that were over the slot. PjShorthorn"
5466098,Multispecies Guy,2017-04-11 07:28:00,447,"The guide had a bait tank installed in his garage so that he no longer had to leave early to get in line to buy shrimp before every trip. Plus maybe he could keep enough in the tank to tide himself through the lean periods when shrimp weren't available. The tank was relatively new and he was happy to have it. Nice reds in your picture. I'm a little worried because I really got hooked on redfishing, another obsession to deal with. My next trip I'd like to fish 3 days, one just like I did this time, one strictly for bulls and then a day of fishing the rigs for whatever we can catch. Only problem is that it gets a little pricey as a solo fisherman but, hey, you only live once, right?"
5466346,pjshorthorn,2017-04-11 08:31:00,5654,"Well, if you got hooked on redfish, wait till you try to fish for bull reds........you will have a serious problem then. Too many years ago, but I think one of my first trips with folks ,who became very good friends, showed me the ropes and I hooked a bull,over 40"" that evening. I was hooked and still am. I don't know how far offshore the rigs are out of Venice. The closest rigs we could get to out of Galveston were about 9 nm -ish which was where state waters transitioned to federal waters. Most of the time we would fish 22 - 40 nm and then after 40 it was for bigger fish in blue water. Depending on the distance to rigs, you would have a good chance at redfish, many different snapper species, cobia, kingfish, amberjack, barracuda and a few other critters if you drop all the way to the bottom. I hear ya on the costs. Back in the days when I went a lot and we fished long range....I would leave my buddy $200 just for fuel on a one day trip. This was before Optimax technology and he was running twin 200 Mercs. As you said, you gotta live life when you can and I couldn't think of a better 3 day trip to try. Oh, I should have also said that maybe we could stir up a few old salts through Share A Seat to put a trip together that is affordable for everyone PjShorthorn"
5466418,Multispecies Guy,2017-04-11 08:57:00,447,"Folks in Venice like to claim they have the quickest access to blue water of anywhere on the Gulf Coast. Not sure if that's true but it could be. I believe the rigs I could see were 10 nm or less of shore. Of course it's a 25-30 minutes boat ride from the Venice marina to open water. Yes, all those species plus sharks and a few more. Blue water means tuna down there although there is at least a limited fishery for sails and marlin. Tuna would be on my bucket list if it wasn't so darn expensive. I like your Share a Seat idea. I would definitely be interested in another go around with reds. Not sure if we should continue this thread in a Canada forum. Seems well off topic. Feel free to PM me. Thanks"
5466434,mjayn,2017-04-11 09:19:00,1188,"I've been down there 4 times, once was just a redfish day in the middle of partying in the french quarter. the other 3 it was too rough to go beyond the pass. We did well enough to be happy but it sure would have been nice to get out to the rigs."
5466546,jambi,2017-04-11 10:02:00,504,"There are some shallow platforms in 30' that Jeff will take us to if the weather is calm. When he goes out here he'll net some pogies. We've caught bulls, cobia, sharks and jack crevalle out there."
5466562,Multispecies Guy,2017-04-11 10:12:00,447,"Man, some beautiful reds in your thumbnails. Gotta admit, I'm a little green with envy. Cobia are another fish on my bucket list. Never caught one when I lived in Ft Walton Beach but saw a few caught on the Okaloosa Island pier and, of course, the charter boats frequently caught them. OK, have to get my mind back on walleye and smallies here at home."
5466594,jambi,2017-04-11 10:30:00,504,The sunrise picture was not at the 30' rig actually. We fished an outer weedline - outer meaning like open gulf at our backs. Big reds were shallow and crashing bait up against the shore. That was my best day ever - fun to watch them school up the bait. The entire shoreline was stacked with mullet....we'd wait for a red to show himself then cast on top of him. The popping cork would call them in. Usually there were 3 to 5 reds together so one of them would find us. They were all big too...that lasted for about 2 hours that morning. Here is one of the smaller cobia from the platform -
5466650,Multispecies Guy,2017-04-11 10:55:00,447,"We saw one big bull, probably in the 25# range, doing just what you mentioned, crashing into bait. I was too slow to react so I missed an opportunity. Will regret that for a long time. We started the day fishing a spot that Jeff was going to bypass but we saw a flock of gulls diving on bait so we detoured over and fished it. We drifted through the area while gulls dived all around us. Never had a hit nor did we see what the gulls were feeding on. I guess it's the nature of fishermen that, no matter how good a day we had on the water, we still lament the lost opportunities."
5344297,Multispecies Guy,2017-02-20 10:54:00,447,This is WAY off for a Canada forum but there are so many experienced fishermen here who have fished extensively in other places I figured I would ask anyway. (Plus I can't find a good forum elsewhere that covers this) I ask your forebearance. Looking to do a one day fishing for redfish near New Orleans during the last week of March. Anyone know a good guide in that area? Or a good forum where I can pose the question. Thanks
5344329,wallydave,2017-02-20 11:04:00,2151,"Look up pjshorthorn, he has done some Gulf fishing !"
5344361,Camoclad,2017-02-20 11:35:00,628,http://www.fishunterguideservice.com/Nash Roberts and his son are top notch and very responsive via email or telephone. It is about an hour south of New Orleans to his camp.
5344561,jambi,2017-02-20 13:23:00,504,"I've done about 10 trips with Capt Jeff Fuscia out of Venice. I can highly recommend him - he will work hard to make your trip worth it. He also has a clean fishing camp there north of the marina about a mile if you need to spend the night. We always stay with him when we go down. Jeff's cell number is 504-382-5488.I will say that late March could be tough conditions - dirty water and fronts coming through. But Jeff would be the one to call. NOTE - whoever you use, make sure to tell them you want Redfish. Alot of people go down and fish for specks, which are great for a meat haul, but can get a little boring IMO. NOTENOTE - if you want a real rod bender of a trip, ask to fish for bull reds. Not all the guides like to do it, but man its a blast. You can get into the bulls without going out to many real deep rigs. If they will take you to SW Pass it can be non stop 15-25# reds.PM me for my number for more details if I can help out."
5344697,Multispecies Guy,2017-02-20 14:30:00,447,"Jambi, yes, I definitely want reds. I lived in the FL panhandle for 5 years and caught plenty of specks and other species but never got into bull reds. I'm locked into the last week of March; vacation with wife and can only do a one day fish. Thanks for your input."
5344705,Multispecies Guy,2017-02-20 14:31:00,447,"Camoclad, thanks. I'll give him a call."
5344985,fldoc1,2017-02-20 16:33:00,69,We stayed at Bobby Lynn's Marina in Leeville. He also guided us and we were able to focus on Redfish and specs. Lots of great water. West of Venice. Another option. We caught reds on Poppers and shrimp. Randy from Duluth
5345881,pjshorthorn,2017-02-20 22:01:00,5654,"Well, I wish I could be of some help but I never have hired a redfish guide nor fished out of the southern LA area. I had the best of all worlds when it came to fishing for any saltwater species. I had a small group of friends that lived right on San Luis Pass, which is on the west end of Galveston Island, and spent many many days fishing bay systems and offshore with them. We would drop the boat out of the lift and be fishing in three minutes from the beach house. Can't get much better than that. I liked what the Nash outfitter website had to say about how they fish. Skinny water and sight casting is a blast. I was going to suggest either Venice or the Houma areas, but it sounds like Camoclad's suggestion would be worth looking into. I second the fact that fishing for bull reds is quite the experience. I have been able to catch a few that put an Ambaasaduer 6500 to the test. Catching one at night in 2-3 ft of water is like chaos on steroids.......unfourtunately, the bull reds tend to be offshore in March. In any event, I'm jealous. I need to get back to doing a little saltwater fishing and scratch that old itch. Have a great day fishing for those reds and post a few pictures when you get a chance. PjShorthorn"
5463578,Multispecies Guy,2017-04-10 10:07:00,447,"Thanks to all who gave input to my request for a Louisiana redfish guide. I did a 6 hour charter with Capt Jeff Fuscia out of Venice, LA on the morning of Mar 29. It was part of a week in NOLA with the wife so I was pleased to squeeze in some fishing. We fished live shrimp with popping corks with what I would call decent success. I asked to concentrate on reds but we did get into a good school of speckled trout that had us reeling in specks at a rapid rate. Biggest red was one that I caught which tickled the 30"" mark. Jeff had one that went 28"". Nothing huge but hard pulling fish that were welcome after a long winter of no fishing. ALso boated a black drum and we each caught a stingray. His rates are $650 for 6 hours for 1-2 fishermen but he will take up to 4. IIRC he charges $750 for 3 people and $900 for 4. He fishes a 24' Champion bay boat with a 300HP Yamaha. I give Jeff a solid thumbs up and would be happy to provide more info to anyone interested. As an aside, NOLA is a great place to visit. National WWII museum, Audobon has an aquarium and insectarium, St Louis cathedral, plantation homes, French Quarter, riverboat cruises, etc. And of course, some of the best food anywhere. Great getaway."
5463826,jambi,2017-04-10 12:17:00,504,"Awesome, glad you caught some decent fish! Late March is a shaky time to go. Jeff is a great guide and friend. Scott."
