5471386,Riverkeg,2017-04-13 14:44:00,134,"When my 2 buddies and I started our annual fishing trips back in 2005, we went the opposite direction. Each day, the person with the least amount of fish caught that day had to wear a special shirt the entire next day. This all happened prior to us going to Canada for our trips so we were at midwest lakes with lots of traffic, visits to bait shops, convenient stores, etc. It was a nice, white tank top undershirt, with sequins around the collar, a picture of a beer mug on the back and ""BEER *****"" in big, bright pink letters on the front. The wearer also had to fetch beer for the others at camp that night. We had to retire the shirt in 2009 (we held a nice cremation ceremony) but man did it create some great stories."
5472226,wiwalleyefreak,2017-04-14 04:40:00,25,"All,(Like everything I have read and thought I would share our competition. My group travels to Canada about every other year. A few trips back we decided we needed some sort of competition. We purchased a small flag (I forget what is on it, but I know there is a skull and cross bones). Then as the week starts, largest Walleye gets to proudly fly the flag from their boat. So every night there is the anticipation of does the flag owner get to retain the flag or do they have to forfeit it. The guy holding the flag at the end of the week keep the flag until the next trip. It is amazing how competitive it gets and how much fun we have with it. This is our year to travel and the flag is already a part of our discussions. All in fun and keeps us working hard all week to catch the big one. Take care and enjoy your trips!"
5466402,Mojo-NC,2017-04-11 08:49:00,1929,"Our group is looking for some kind of a trophy to be awarded to the winner each year for our annual Canada fishing trip. This trophy would be passed around from year to year and might have a name plate that could be updated indicating the recipient of the trophy from that year. Do any of your groups do something similar or do you have any suggestions? It's all for bragging rights only and meant to be fun, not something serious."
5466410,pjshorthorn,2017-04-11 08:56:00,5654,"We came up with the ""Golden Plunger "" award a few years ago to recognize the member of the group that caused the most toilet failures during the week, but that may not be what you are looking for So far my son has yet to relinquish the trophy. We may need to cut his cheese intake. PjShorthorn"
5466706,Pooch,2017-04-11 11:19:00,4618,"One of the original group I started fishing LS with found a golf trophy on a garage sale for probably a dime or quarter. Took it home and made it look like the golfer depicted was holding a fishing rod. Ugliest darned thing, but it acquired cult status within the group. The builder of the trophy has now passed and it was retired. A new (store bought) plaque in his memory is now the big walleye of the trip award. Given out the last night of the trip.I like the old home made trophy (using the term loosely) better as it was special because Ray made it out of junk and his penny pinching ways. You can't buy that kind of special meaning.Pooch"
5466882,Wedge,2017-04-11 12:13:00,270,You and a couple of the guys should have a few beers and go out to garage sales. I am sure you will find something funny and creative. Something to start your own tradition!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro
5467434,mickr,2017-04-11 16:09:00,74,"my group has a trophy. Something one of the boys found at a thrift store. It is an actual fishing trophy in so far as it has a fish on top. And it is attached to this box with a sliding door. The winner gets the trophy, gets his name on a plaque attached (one of our guys does the work so it costs nothing) and he gets to keep the bottle that's in the sliding door. Next trip, the winner has to put a new bottle in the sliding door. All the boys love it....you get to relish sipping a bottle of scotch that you won or whatever is in there. We used to just run a big fish derby for 20 bucks and all that amounted to was one guy with a cheaper trip. It seemed to have less meaning than winning a bottle...which is really like winning nothing cause you have to replace it anyway"
5467522,srk-low,2017-04-11 16:50:00,78,"My father began going to Sioux Narrows in the 50's when his uncle bought a cottage on Annie Island in Whitefish Bay. Dad bought a place on mainland in 1980. His last trip was in August of 2006 when I took him up with a group of my friends. He passed three months later. I have continued taking my friends every year. My cousin made a trophy named the ""Bob Kincaid Memorial Big Fish Award. Each year we add the name of whoever caught the largest fish. Bottom of the trophy can be removed to reveal a hollow area where some of Dads ashes reside. Very sentimental to all who knew him."
5467698,That Minnesota guy,2017-04-11 17:42:00,8293,Very nice Takes a pretty good fish with your group to get on that trophy also!!
5467826,srk-low,2017-04-11 18:40:00,78,"Thanks. The trophy is only for the one week trip with my friends. The names wrap around and the largest is a 46"" ski. Of course my sister is not on these trips but gives us a hard time as she has several bigger ski with the largest being 54 1/2""."
5468074,Pooch,2017-04-11 20:16:00,4618,That is pretty neat and your dad still making the trip. That is an interesting thought.Pooch
