I have been to Rice lake, Lady Evelyn, the nip & pigeon lake. It's my job to find a new place for 2018. I like the nip but looking for a change. Any camp suggestions that are comparable to glen echo? Thanks. Kevin"

I'm sure you'll get plenty of suggestions for Eastern Ontario fishing destinations. Are there any travel restrictions (like how many hours you'll travel north of Toronto) for your trip ? You may want to give more detail on what you're looking for in a new camp and location, as many here may not be familiar with the Glen Echo camp. Good luck, Rich B"

Of the places you mentioned, Lady Evelyn is familiar to me and we have had some great days on that lake. Our group has gravitated to Quebec to find exceptional walleye fishing and more relaxed regulations. We could actually take a beer legally to have with our island cookouts. This year were going to Land o Lakes Lodge on Crotch Lake, about two hours over the Thousand Island Bridge. I can't recommend the Lodge because it's our first time there. We're going to fish the walleye opener, thank goodness it's a warm Spring. My research tells me there's a chance at some good walleye fishing. The American plan is an exceptional value, we bring our own boats. I will be reporting on the trip. Good Luck Ron"

Can fish for Walleye, Smalmouth and Lake Trout. Downside, the Walleye fishing can be tough - but it can be great too.I've been to Evelyn twice (one of my favorites in Eastern Ontario) and went to Kipawa last year. We did struggle with finding fish, but when we did, we did fairly well. Lake Trout fishing was pretty good though. Definitely a great lake if you like to troll and slip bobber fish. Also, the walleye fishing on Kipawa seemed to be the typical morning/evening bite pattern. I probably would have went back to Evelyn if the prices weren't so high.Lots of info from residents and regulars on the Kipawa fishing forum: http://www.kipawafishingforum.net/Another option is Horwood Lake. Another place we stuggled a bit, but I know people can do well here. There are some back lake options as well. I believe there are three outfitters operating on this lake - two drive to and one boat in. It's fairly remote and a nice lake as well - not too many cottages or busy etc...Brennan Harbour Resort is another that gets recommended often. I've never been though."
