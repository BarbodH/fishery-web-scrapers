5451930,IAWally,2017-04-05 01:20:00,38,"I keep 6 rods in the boat with me 10 rod locker and the rest in the cabin as back ups or to switch out as we change our targeted fish.

5463610,Riverkeg,2017-04-10 10:24:00,134,I used to take a bunch of different combos up but now it's just: 1 UL spinning - crappie 2 ML spinning - pitching/jigging walleye 1 M bait caster - BB walleye or casting for smallies the rod storage in my boat is terrible so I keep it to a minimum. Plus we fish 3 out of my boat so I usually only go out with 2 rods at a time. We just plan ahead what we're going to fish for that morning and then after lunch and pack accordingly.
5444522,Larry S,2017-04-02 13:11:00,665,My sister and I are flying from Las Vegas to Thunder Bay on June 28th taking 5 - 2 piece spinning rods & 2 - 2 piece casting rods I divide then in half and rap them with bubble wrap securing them with straps These go in a duffle bag cushioned with various clothes. Have never had any breakage flying like this in 10 plus years
5444570,Tonyo,2017-04-02 13:25:00,212,"I take what I can. I broke 2 rods in one trip and an additional the following year. So, I understand the need for spare equipment. TonyO"
5445354,muskyman73,2017-04-02 18:52:00,401,I make it easy and just bring 37 rods/ reels. I need another boat to tow behind mine for all my gear.
5445626,Guest,2017-04-02 21:37:00,0,14 baitcasters 5 spinning Used every one but 1 the last few years
5445818,Bill Krejca,2017-04-03 05:43:00,6107,"Last trip last year, I had total of 5 people for my boat and counted 27 rods. We managed to get by for the week without having to have anyone double up! Bill"
5446138,Guest,2017-04-03 08:07:00,0,"My son and I each have our primary walleye rod, and each have our primary pike/lake trout rod. One backup for each, plus one panfish rod just in case we feel like perch. Seven rods total has been our normal stash. With more storage in the boat this year, I speculate that we'll have a couple of extra general purpose rods along. Of our seven trips, we've needed to deploy a spare rod on two occasions (broke my Eyecon day one of year one--but boy oh boy did I get a good hookset into that rock--broke his Rage in year 4 when the line got caught on my PFD while I was trying to sit down). -42"
5446186,jambi,2017-04-03 08:19:00,504,We average about 5 to 6 rods per person as well.
5446226,pjshorthorn,2017-04-03 08:24:00,5654,Now that is what I call a very busy guide service. Do ya got room for a sixth ? PjShorthorn
5446946,Bill Krejca,2017-04-03 12:12:00,6107,"Always, always room for more than one fifth, but I donno about a sixth! Cheers. Bill"
5448970,Joek3,2017-04-04 05:21:00,244,Rod Man Are you a bass fisherman? Is that why so many baitcasters?
5443650,Joek3,2017-04-02 07:49:00,244,"When you go to Canada, how many rods do you take? Spinning? Baitcasters? I find it very difficult to leave some arsenal behind when I pack so consequently I always have overkill when it comes to rods."
5443722,That Minnesota guy,2017-04-02 08:03:00,8293,"1- spinning 1- baitcaster 1- trolling 1- backup rod, usually one i've had for awhile."
5443762,fishinnut 3446,2017-04-02 08:13:00,638,"Have alot of storage in the boat and take 8-10 spinning combos 3-4 baitcasters 4 trolling combos and 4-6 musky rods, alot but most is out of site. (for a family of 4)Side note for you musky guys as we all check and double check and then check again 1 yr. forgot both musky boxes at home and had to buy stuff at Canadian tire and Bobbies(won't do that again )"
5443778,Pooch,2017-04-02 08:15:00,4618,"I do drive in or trail in fishing anymore so this is my current way. I fish out of my own 16.5' tiller or a camp boat so space is a premium.I take five rods on the trip. In the boat I carry one bait caster for BB or casting, one med-light spinning for light (up to 1/4 oz.) jigging and one medium spinning for heavier jigs and plastics or pitching. Adjust baitcasters vs spinning count to fit how you like to fish. I used to carry two baitcasters and one spinning. Now it's the opposite as I fish plastics more and more each year.In the cabin is one each spare, bait caster and spinning rod along with a reel for each. On occasion myself or others have had to go to a backup rig from breakage or lost.If we (as a group) were still doing fly ins then everyone does not need to carry spares. As a group decide who will bring a couple spares with them to share if needed. Don't forget a couple extra reels.Can see no reason to carry any more than that. Ontario only allows one rod in the water per person so why a boat full of of rods in the way and patiently waiting to get broken?Everyone's different, but for me logic overrides my desire to take with me half of the entire stack of rods setting in the basement. Every trip I pain over ""who"" gets left behind, but now have favorites that always make the trip. Some rods will never again see the water, but I can't seem to part with them.Long answer to a simple question.Pooch"
5443786,Joek3,2017-04-02 08:15:00,244,Wow. Now I don't feel so bad taking 8-9 rods!
5443842,pjshorthorn,2017-04-02 08:31:00,5654,"I fly to some ""jump off"" city each year to start our trips up to Canada so carrying a ton of rods is not an option ( not easy and cheap ) very often. I bring two UL/ ML spinning rods that are two piece. The son does the same . Two M action spinning rods that are two piece as well. I can get all six rods into a cardboard tube , with some rod wrangling, and carry it on our flights. On occasion I would check a second rod tube with 2-3 MH one piece rods. Now I have a very accommodating fishing partner that allows us to use (abuse ) some of his bait casting rigs since he pulls his boat and has the room.So I guess, for two guys I typically carry no more than 6 rods and borrow a bait caster if I need it for some reason.PjShorthorn"
5443994,Mojo-NC,2017-04-02 09:40:00,1929,"We have to fly to MN and drive the rest of the way up to NW Ontario from there, so we're limited on the amount of tackle we can bring. I bring 2 spinning rods and 2 baitcasters. One spinning rod is intended to be hooked up with a jig and the other with a spinner rig / bait harness. One baitcaster is hooked up with a crank bait and the other with a spinner bait for walleye and pike. I choose the line weight and rod power/action accordingly. The airlines allow us to tie 3 of our rod carriers together and only charge us as a single piece of luggage. The 4 of us can usually get all 16 of our rods into 3 rod carriers."
5444018,pjshorthorn,2017-04-02 09:48:00,5654,Yup. This is exactly what I do when bringing rod cases. Never an issue.......so far that is.PjShorthorn
5444082,Multispecies Guy,2017-04-02 10:19:00,447,I could outfit a small bait shop with the rods/reels and lures I carry in my boat.
5444098,packpro,2017-04-02 10:26:00,695,"2- 6'6"" Spinning rods (medium)1-6'6"" baitcaster (medium)Covers all species, pike, walleye, perch, lake trout, small mouth. Muskie are not in season when we go, but a mid 30's musky is usually caught during the week.Rods cover all types of fishing. Trolling and deep water jigging for lake trout. Jigging and casting soft plastics for walleye. Casting swimbaits and hard baits for smallies. Casting swimbaits and spoons for pike. Dropping small jigs into weed pockets for perch. It is rare for us to have to find fish. We have taken this set up to 6 different camps. Never felt that we needed anything else."
