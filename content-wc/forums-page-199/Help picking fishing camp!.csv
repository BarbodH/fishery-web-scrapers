5469962,Rich B,2017-04-12 20:15:00,1081,Here's a website that will locate Canadian lodges and camps that fits one's criteria and budget for a Canadian fishing trip:http://www.mycanadafishingtrip.com/ I have no financial interest or ownership in this website (though I did write a few of their blog articles). Good luck with your search. Rich B
5460082,mtnulton,2017-04-08 07:10:00,1,"My wife and I are trying to plan our first walleye/pike trip to Canada and the number of choices is overwhelming. We are experienced walleye fishermen and that is our primary focus. We are looking for a clean, but reasonably priced location, with dining facilities. Small cabins would be ideal as it will just be the two of us. A good balance of quantity and quality of fishing as well. Thanks for any help you can provide."
5460122,Bstar,2017-04-08 07:28:00,564,"Welcome to Walleye Central. Please give us a little more info like whether you are bringing your own boat, size of lake you prefer, any particular area, price range,fly-in or drive to, etc. That being said, it sounds like your looking for an American plan lodge. Give us more info and we'll be able to give you better suggestions."
5460146,camp chef,2017-04-08 07:33:00,915,"Check out www.bignorthlodge.com . We've been there 5 or 6 times. Great people,facilites and fishing"
5460178,BornToFish,2017-04-08 07:40:00,1224,"Greetings,I will offer some thoughts for you and your wife to ponder. First of all, you are getting into the game rather late. The sport shows are very close to over if not already done. This means that many lodges have sold their available cabins/weeks. You will be looking for whatever is still remaining (e.g. cancellations) - the pickings may be slim at some lodges.Lodges are categorized as follows: drive-to, boat-to and fly-in. Seclusion and price generally go up as you progress from drive to boat to fly. Fishing may or may not go up with price and seclusion. Within these categories, there are Housekeeping Plans (you bring food and cook in your cabin) and American Plans (meals are served to you). It sounds as though you might want American Plan or maybe an evening meal plan (hybrid of American and Housekeeping).Another consideration is the size of the lake for your vacation. Do you prefer to boat for one hour to find a place to fish, or do you prefer to be across the lake in twenty minutes? Lakes in NW Ontario can be huge!You might be able to narrow your search by deciding where you prefer to cross the border. Ontario is huge!Many couples seem to prefer mid-July through August due to more favorable weather patterns and decreasing bugs. Please understand that fishing in NW Ontario might be quite a bit different than you are accustomed to in your home waters. Lakes on the Canadian Shield differ from most lakes in the USA. I strongly encourage you to understand the seasonal movements of walleyes/pike in the lake that you pick for your vacation. The seasonal movements strongly dictate how/where you will be fishing.As a place to start, consider Stormer Lake Lodge. They have an advertisement banner at the bottom of the Walleye Central home page. the walleye fishing (quality and quantity) is outstanding.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5460186,Ruddiger,2017-04-08 07:41:00,649,"Howdy, If you're willing to go to northwest Ontario, Witch Bay Camp on Lake of The Woods is hard to beat. It is a bit more than you may spend elsewhere depending upon what your budget is but it is, by far, the best camp I have been to for the combination of accommodations, food, and fishing. Take care, Ruddiger"
5460202,pjshorthorn,2017-04-08 07:51:00,5654,"MT, There are a few places that I would personally consider taking my wife to for a trip if she was so inclined. The fist two have an American plan and the third is strictly housekeeping where you prepare your own meals. Each one has outstanding offerings to make your trip enjoyable. (1) Lost Island Lodge - Lac Seul. Boat in lodge (2) Obabikon - Lake of The Woods. Boat in Lodge (3) Vermilion Bay Lodge - Eagle Lake. Drive to lodge I already visit V-Bay Lodge and throughly enjoy the atmosphere. Lost Island and Obabikon are on my list to try in the future. Enjoy the search for your vacation and wherever you end up, hopefully it will be one of the best experiences you will have together on a fishing trip. PjShorthorn"
5460266,Golden Eagle,2017-04-08 08:22:00,2642,"Do you have husband and wife friends who have been successful fishing NW Ontario for pike and walleyes? A foursome might be a possibility.or....................... provide the date of your trip and maybe someone on WC would be in a camp the same week to exchange information with you. Don't expect them to guide you, but maybe count on them to offer advice.Best not to bust into their fishing spots unless invited.You'll find lots of good people on this forum and they know how to catch fish."
5460994,Bill Krejca,2017-04-08 19:16:00,6107,"Excellent suggestions. After booking, post a query as to time and place, perhaps use the name of the lodge in the heading to get the attention of readers who already go there. Bill"
5461394,Wedge,2017-04-09 04:37:00,270,"I frequently go to www.pakwashlakecamp.com This place is VERY reasonable for pricing, cabins with full kitchens, nice facilities, and you can drive right to the boat dock. Red Lake and Ear Falls are both 30 min or less away and have some good restaurant options if your looking to dine out too. It is 275 per person per week for fishing, 175 to launch your boat & dock with electric for the week, or rent a boat for 475-675 depending on model. The fishing here is outstanding. If you bring your own boat you can trailer to Lac Seul, Red Lake, & Gullrock Lake in 30 minutes or less as well, however, Pakwash is not overfished. On a side note, these guys never promote. They arent at the shows with a booth and usually mostly have people camping there that live in Red Lake. They also have a bear hunt there that is unbelievably cheap. It is $1000 for a bear hunt (and this replaces the 275 that you pay for the week)"
5463250,prov1800,2017-04-10 07:16:00,5010,"I would suggest having a look at cedar point resort on cedar lake.They do have the American plan,pretty reasonable prices and a well kept camp.Lake is 17 miles long and has very good fishing for a number of species.easy to navigate on and has many places to get out of wind on bad days.If you don't mind larger water take a look at northshore lodge on eagle lake.also has the American plan and great fishing.Both lakes will provide you quality and quantity. I guide at both of these lodges and you cant go wrong."
