5460658,f1shw1s,2017-04-08 13:19:00,1,I'm looking for a map chip that covers SE Lac Seul. I have a Humminbird 999 HD SI. I can't find any details online so am wondering if there is anything decent worth dropping $200 or more?
5460850,JDP,2017-04-08 17:46:00,1457,"Navionics North (check to confirm Lac Seul is indeed on the chip. I have Lac Seul on mine, but others have told me it is not on theirs).Navionics Canada.Both have basic depth contours same as paper maps that readily available."
