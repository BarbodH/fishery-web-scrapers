6749165,wdkott,2023-07-09 12:59:00,26,"Agree on the Hot n Tot. They are great for trolling as the lip of this lure making contact with the bottom causes a nice bounce that the fish seem to pounce on. Caught my largest pike, 44”, on the small size hot n tot on Lount Lake. As mentioned previously, it is great at locating walleyes, so you can go back and jig them up because when there is one there is usually a school. Usually best in water 10-15 feet deep.My best early Spring trolling lure is a floating Rapala. This is because the fish are shallower and it only runs 3-4 feet deep. For pike, in addition to trolling spoons, a Rat L Trap calls them in. Something about the vibration and noise they make really attracts the pike. Try some of the larger sizes in deeper water."
6749205,troutwater,2023-07-09 20:23:00,299,"Heck ya. I moved to Arkansas last year and rented a little jon boat to fish Ouachita one day. Not knowing the lake and not having a depth finder the girlfriend and I did the ""Canadian thing."" We tied on crankbaits and trolled the breaks(I think) and whatever looked good. 15 minutes into our trolling we hooked up with a hybrid striper. We proceeded to just cast the area and knocked the crap out of them. It works!"
6749239,last chance,2023-07-10 08:00:00,3262,i trolled the western basin of Erie for yrs. before moving to the central basin. we flatlined 6 cranks at a time. our go to cranks were the small hot n tots and the small wiggle warts. but if things were slow we would try anything from the very small wee warts to the deep diving mudbug trying to find active fish. but most days we ran mostly the hot n tots and wiggle warts. back then we used spinning gear and just let out lots of line. we didn't have bandits or husky jerks back then and had never heard about clip on weights. i had 2 surf 16' rods i made outriggers out of. then had 2 9' med/lt rods i put out to the side then 2 6' light rods off each corner going straight back for our 6 flat lines. then we used 2 downriggers to get our 8 lines for 4 fishermen.
6748445,Jorge1074,2023-07-05 00:43:00,5,"I've never used crankbaits before, and am wondering how to fish them trolling. If your using a bottom bouncer, do you use a leader with it and if so how long of a leader?"
6748455,Luckydawg13,2023-07-05 04:45:00,363,I pull crankbaits just long line them Usually just let around 65 yd out.put I fish a shallow river
6748457,Ltrain,2023-07-05 04:59:00,4145,"A great asset to have is the Precision Trolling app, it gives you a ton of depth info for most major lures. It is not free though, you can pay by the lure or a one time fee that gives you anything. That being said you can long line cranks behind the boat or a very popular method to run multiple lines off each side is to use inline planer boards with line counter reels. There's a ton of info here on that if you do a search. No using bottom bouncers with deep diving cranks, if you need to get down below the max you can add snap weights.....again do a search here, lots of info."
6748513,MrSimon,2023-07-05 10:56:00,922,There are two ways to troll crankbaits in Canada for pike and walleye. 1) Chuck it out behind the boat and drag it around fishy looking areas 2) I don't know the second way cause the first one always works great for us
6748541,Mojo-NC,2023-07-05 12:21:00,1929,"I agree with MrSimon. In Canada you can only pull one crankbait at a time (per person that is), so we start by running the boat at the approximate depth where we have found walleyes and vary the speed, maybe zig zag a bit, and run across points. I like to use the larger Doctor spoons, and deeper diving crankbaits like the Rapala Deep Runner, Flicker Shads, and Storm Hot 'N Tots. I'm sure there are many others that work well too, but those are my main baits for pulling behind the boat. We've caught a lot of fish while doing it and some of our largest fish have come by using that method. Another lesser used way to ""troll"" is using a 3-way swivel, enough weight to keep it down to or near the bottom, and tie a floating Rapala on a 3-4' leader behind the weight. It's a good way to catch walleyes and the method is similar to spinner rigging. Having said that, we don't really troll a lot in Canada. We do it for a change of pace, we will troll between jigging spots, and maybe on our way to and from camp. If there is not a good walleye bite, we will troll along unfamiliar shorelines while exploring depth and structure where the water tends to look fishy."
6748561,valley366,2023-07-05 13:51:00,193,We don't troll much but it can be an effective method to catch fish. Some years in Canada we have thrown them on in a method to find the active fish. Throw on a Shad-Rap and hit the 12-15 foot contour and cover a bunch of water. Then mark the spots that you catch them and go back and jig them up.In MN we do it when the fish are scattered along the weedbed. In this case they are not concentrated on one spot as much and at times can get runs in of 1/2 mile or so.I have heard of people doing the 3 way rig with a weight. Last year at camp there were guys doing this with large floating Rapala's pursuing northerns that were hanging around submerged humps.Whatever you choose to do read up on the lures and determine what depth they work at. Most are calculated with 100 feet of line out. So if the lure says 9-12 foot this is based on 100 feet of line. Speed does not determine max depth. There are also books and apps that will show you the calculations for each lure and different quantity of line out.A couple of good reads on the topic: https://www.lurenet.com/blog/catch-m...nkbait-depths/https://www.berkley-fishing.com/berk...he-right-depthGood luck.
6748563,Spurgery,2023-07-05 14:18:00,79,"Depends on the time of year for us. In June we don’t pull cranks that much, do more jigging and drifting. But in august we pull cranks along deep water edges and points probably 85% of the time. I actually prefer it to jigging and drifting. Nothing like the feel of a big walleye or pike smashing into your deep diving bandit or other various other crankbaits……."
6748579,pjshorthorn,2023-07-05 15:33:00,5654,"THIS !!!!! When covering unknown waters of areas I'm not familiar with in a particular lake system I have followed the above for many years to start. I never thought about slowing my speed ( in or out of gear ) while changing directions in a zig zag pattern as well. Over the years it taught me that doing so can trigger that bite in a certain area. This was back in the day, but now it is much easier with a bow mounted trolling motor if you have one. If you don't, just your main motor. More speed into the wind, less with the wind .the fish will always tell you what they want. Most of the fun is just trying to figure out the differences on whatever lake you go to. They will all be different. PjShorthorn"

6748629,fishron,2023-07-06 06:52:00,317,"My go to bait for trolling has been the hot'n'tot. Something about the metal lip in the smaller size turns the fish on. The lure runs at eleven ft deep and I try to troll fourteen to fifteen ft depths. Always ready to raise the rod to compensate for humps. The blue firetiger color was absolutely a sure producer when we fished Cabonga Reservoir years ago. Unfortunately not in production any more but I still have some. Some lakes are better for trolling than others. Herbert in Quebec is a jigging lake ten to one. Casting, jigging, trolling, I enjoy fishing them all. Trolling takes the least attention but it's great when that rod takes a deep bend and the fight is on."
