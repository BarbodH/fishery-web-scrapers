6747027,Yellowfin123,2023-06-27 11:26:00,2182,Is the parking area good where you would leave a truck and trailer?? no worries??
6747037,7 Mag,2023-06-27 12:15:00,1887,"Great question, i was going to ask it as well."
6747069,Thunder man,2023-06-27 15:22:00,27,"As far as parking goes, I was met at the dock in Hudson. Unloaded etc.Then we were escorted to a private parking lot a mile or so away.I believe it was a government site for road maintenance???But it was secure and no issues.Contact the new owner and ask!"
6747309,Yellowfin123,2023-06-28 21:10:00,2182,"ok thanks for posting that, looks like the owners have their bases covered..."
6747385,NLpike,2023-06-29 07:36:00,28,"We parked at the Hudson city dock. There is room for about 30 trucks/trailers. Bob will give you a parking pass so you don't have to worry about the cost. You are up in CA, security is a very relative thing. I'm not aware of a ""secure"" parking lot anywhere in Kenora district. Nobody will mess with your stuff, but it's a good idea to take everything in your car with you, just in case."
6747397,Yellowfin123,2023-06-29 08:20:00,2182,"yea your right, most of the time I'm always parked on resort grounds but have left everything at government dock on LOTW before for a week after reading your original post I got on the phone with my fishing crew. I'm sold...."
6747999,Carnhzkr,2023-07-02 10:57:00,964,"Sorry, Steve. I didn't mean to ignore your post, but I just returned from a trip to the NW side of Lac Seul. Yes, every lodge is a long way from Taylor Island. There are only 3, that I'm aware of; Lost Island, Lac Seul Resort (I think it's called) which is just a couple miles from LI, and Lac Seul Outposts, which is at Chamberlain Narrows. I'd see a lot of boats that put in at either Hudson or Deception that would make the journey to that area and beyond too. I don't think a person necessarily needs to make the 20 mile trip to that area, if staying at LI. As I mentioned, you certainly drive over a lot of walleye along the way. It's just the area I'd always heard people talking about, so wanted to give it a try. When I had talked with Basil, the guide at LI, he pointed out areas around Taylor, and that's where he takes his clients. The previous owner had once told me that you'd typically catch the larger fish around the main basin, i.e., Taylor area during the summer months. I think we made the trip to that area 3 times the week we were there, and for us, those were our 3 best days while at the lodge. Of course, that was my only time I stayed at LI, so I'm certainly no expert on the area."
6748703,orchard frank,2023-07-06 13:27:00,1900,"Our first trip was in 1993, went for at least 2-3 weeks every year until 2005 or so. Hayes family owned it during those years. Wife, son and I mostly, a few trips with friends. Unless there has been some major changes, there was always some excellent fishing for size and numbers close to the lodge. but, always fun to run up the lake to Grassy, Taylor, Vaughn, etc. Living in Florida now, but have so many wonderful memories of Jim, Marlene, Basel, Vivian, Shane, and all the rest. Have heard nothing but great about the new owners."
6744043,NLpike,2023-06-12 15:29:00,28,"I have been fishing with my brother, father, and cousin on Lac Seul since 2010. The amazing fish, both quantity and size, keep us coming back every spring. The biggest problem has been the lodges. At least on the east side of the Lac, they pretty much suck. We have arrived to find our toilet and water heater sitting in front of the cabin. One year we stopped where we had reservations, and just kept driving.This was our first year at Lost Island Lodge (LIL). It was just fantastic. It is not on the main basin. It is located on Lost Lake, near Pelican Falls, and has just as much opportunity for huge Pike and Walleye. There is also a chance for Musky, and we even saw our first one this year follow a Small Mouth we were reeling in.I could make this post about the insane amount of fish we caught, a week full of 100+ fish days. I could make it about the day we had 3 25"" and 2 27"" Walleye days. The real star of this post is the lodge. The owners Bob and John just recently bought and renovated the place. They replaced the communal outhouse system with toilets in each cabin. They are 100% dedicated to your happiness and comfort. There was not one thing we asked for where the answer wasn't, we will get that for you.We were met at the Hudson public boat launch by Bob. He reminded me so much of Radar O'Reilly. He was always smiling, always funny and always there with exactly what you needed. He loaded half our gear onto his boat, and we followed him the 5 minutes to LIL. His brother-in-law, John, was on the dock to welcome us. John is another soft spoken, dry humored host that doesn't know the meaning of the word NO. They unloaded our stuff and drove it to our cabin and did everything but unpack our clothes for us. From launching our boat until we were completely unpacked, we may have spent 30 minutes. Every morning, noon and night, these guys were on the dock to see us off and greet us when we came back. It is so much easier to dock your boat in the wind when Bob is standing there to catch your line and pull you in. They asked if we needed more minnows or gas. They had gas grills and deep fryers free to use. They had a huge deck overlooking the boats to relax on. They had a guide, Basel, with 30 years experience that would take you to Canoe or Chamberlain, or anywhere you wanted withing range. They had WiFi and TV and a dining room that served more amazing food than you could possibly eat. We ran out of cigarettes one day and they went to town to get some for us. The whole experience was surreal in the best way possible. Every year we had to decide what horrible dump we would stay in so we could experience the wonder of Lac Seul spring fishing, not anymore. Every year from now on, we know where we are going."
6744061,7 Mag,2023-06-12 17:20:00,1887,"Thanks for the report, sounds like a great experience!"
6744071,Carnhzkr,2023-06-12 17:33:00,964,"My son and I stayed at LIL last September. I completely agree with everything you said about Bob and Jon. They're both extremely accommodating and will do everything they can to ensure you have a great experience. My only issue with LIL is that it's a good 20 mile ride to the Taylor Island area. Of course, you drive over a lot of walleyes getting to Taylor, but if that's where you want to fish, it's a haul. They put together a hybrid plan for us. We did our own breakfasts & lunches, and cooked fish in our cabin four nights then ate dinner in the lodge the other three nights. That's what I mean by accommodating. Dinners were excellent."
6744081,kona77,2023-06-12 18:39:00,236,Great Report.. Always great to hear about owner's/lodges who actually do provide outstanding service. Glad you found your permanent Lac Seul home !!!
6746047,Steve Comerford,2023-06-23 07:50:00,28,"Carnhzkr - isn't every lodge a long haul to Taylor Island? I had always thought that the Taylor Island area was fished by the houseboat/floating lodge guys? Am I correct that in mid-summer, the main basin areas provide better fishing than the lodges close to highway 105."
6746135,Megatron,2023-06-23 14:06:00,13,"I catch them allOver the place, but I would agree that the fishing around Taylor’s is consistently better year round Been going up for 30 plus years now"
6746149,Thunder man,2023-06-23 15:38:00,27,"I’ve stayed there twice in the past, fished 15-20 miles up the lake as well.I can say the fishing within a few miles of the lodge was as good if not better than driving the long distances in my boat."
6746175,prov1800,2023-06-23 18:28:00,5010,I agree.on Westend where I fish I don't have to go far.But all the camp boats I see travell 20+ miles.I see boats coming from earfalls that's and extra 20 mi.???
6747007,NLpike,2023-06-27 10:41:00,28,"Taylor is way up there. It's not as far as Chamberlain, and there were guys running up there for opener. I would be interested to hear the pros about fishing Taylor. I caught two 27"" mammoths in 30 minutes at Pelican Falls the first day. Is there something more interesting than that? Is Taylor where the 32"" behemoths hide out?"
6747011,Yellowfin123,2023-06-27 10:54:00,2182,"thanks for posting this, great report..."
