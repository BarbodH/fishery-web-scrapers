6749281,valley366,2023-07-10 09:49:00,193,"Have taken both my sons for about 6 years now. Last couple years has just been the younger one and we cross about 3 times a year. I would say approximately 30% of the time they ask for the letter. Would say as he has gotten older (currently 14) the question has been less. Have done the trip with friends with their kids and similar experiences.I am guessing the more variables you have, divorce, adoption, difference in names the higher the probability of additional questions.I have had agents that ask that the kids answer some of the questions at the crossing. Like where are you going? How long you going? How often do you go? Does your mother know about the trip?Each time has been a good experience. We do prepare the kids to expect the questions so they know what is coming."
6749305,Lineman8,2023-07-10 11:08:00,3,"Went through int falls with my 4 year old son end of june.Passport card and letter from my wife. (Notary recommended) not required** BUT the border agent was adamant I should’ve had the note notarized.. got through very little questions asked but she wasn’t thrilled without it, just my experience this year. Safe travels yall&#x1f91f;"
6749311,Kman67rsss,2023-07-10 11:57:00,30,It seems it all boils down to the crossing guard. My FIL was a commercial pilot. Flew all over the Middle East one year. Younger guard was questioning all his visas. Older guard came over and they stepped away from the truck. A min later the older guard hands us the passports and says enjoy your trip. The younger guy didn’t look happy. This will be my 1st time with a kid. Just trying to make it smooth as possible.
6749325,CI_Guy,2023-07-10 13:14:00,2118,"I crossed once with a minor in our group. His dad had a permission letter signed by the mom and notarized. The border agent told us that the note didn't need to be notarized but he needed mom's contact info. He got the address and phone#, asked the boy a few questions then told us to have a nice trip."
6749117,Kman67rsss,2023-07-09 10:26:00,30,Our group is heading to the Gouin reservoir next week. I am bringing my 8yr old son. Do I need anything special paperwork/ID wise for him. He has a passport. My wife/his mom is not coming with us. Do I need/should i have any type of consent from her just in case? If so what? I’m probably over thinking it but don’t want to be held up at the border over something like that. Thanks.
6749121,ILScott,2023-07-09 10:32:00,139,"I always take a consent letter for my son that is notarized at a bank. It makes it easier to cross in my opinion. One time crossing with a friend of mine and his 2 sons and my son, I had my consent letter and he didn't. They questioned him multiple times about not having the letter but still let him go into Canada. It is simple and they have a pdf online you can just fill out and print. Scott"
6749125,Spurgery,2023-07-09 10:45:00,79,"I’ve crossed with 8 year old and 12 year old recently. You need a note from the mother stating it’s ok for you to take them but it doesn’t have to be notarized, just signed. Also, for what it’s worth minors below the age of 16 don’t even need a passport to cross, just a copy of birth certificate plus the note from the mother. https://www.us-passport-service-guid...to-the-us.html"
6749135,Wallychowder,2023-07-09 11:17:00,1567,I'm surprised they would even issue him a passport ?
6749137,kettyspanky,2023-07-09 11:25:00,271,I got a passport for my son last year when he was 9. They will issue anyone a passport if they pass the background check. It's only good for 5 yrs. I had a written note from wife with her contact info but they never asked for it. I'll have my wife write and sign another one for our trip in 2 weeks. Just in case. I'd rather be safe than sorry. Good luck on your trip.
6749149,Wallychowder,2023-07-09 11:53:00,1567,"A 8 and 9 year old shouldn't have any trouble passing a background check , but if they don't need it why get it ? I've even heard that Adults don't even need one .......lol."
6749155,KC Walleye,2023-07-09 12:03:00,274,"I crossed at International Falls/Fort Frances this June with my 10 year old without issue. Handed the agent our passports, asked a few questions, and we were on our way. He never asked for a consent letter from my wife, although I had a notarized copy in my hand that I had not passed him yet. Was just as easy as any previous years. But it can never hurt to cover all the bases in case you get the stickler of an agent. https://travel.gc.ca/docs/child/cons...tement-eng.pdf I used this one. Good luck! Enjoy your trip."
6749179,Kman67rsss,2023-07-09 16:47:00,30,Thank you everyone. My kids both have passports as we needed them for other trips we have taken. I thought I had seen something about a letter previously but couldnt find anything when I was looking this morning.
6749191,Ohio fisherman,2023-07-09 19:23:00,988,"Before passports were required, took a 7 year old who I adopted after we got married. We prepared him for possible questions. Took: Certified copy of his birth certificate. Certified copy of wife's divorce decree. Our marriage decree. Certified copy of adoption decree. Notarized letter of consent from wife with specific dates and locations. Certified copy of my birth certificate. My driver's license. They questioned him in the vehicle. Then they said pull aside and come inside. I asked that for his peace of mind that they not take him where he could not see me. They took him into the next room for questioning. He could see me through a small window. They asked me to turn my back - I said no. Five minutes of questions and they brought him out. Told us to have a nice trip. About a mile away he had a meltdown because he was scared."
6749203,btyreprich,2023-07-09 20:18:00,1067,Several years ago I took my two adopted kids with me on a fishing trip. They had US Passports at that time and a letter my wife signed. Told the kids that if they are questioned by the border guard to not cry and answer questions honestly. The border guard never aske to see the letter my wife signed.
