6748361,Big Swede,2023-07-04 11:57:00,7,"Uneventful ride up spent the night in Virginia, had some really good pizza and beer at Snickers. Hit the road again early and made the border by 8:00 am. Thru in 5 minutes, no issues (no smiles either, as always!!!)Made the beer stop, Walmart and McDs in Dryden. Total chaos everywhere, couldn’t wait to get out of town. Lots of traffic police, one of our group got to have a personal chat. Finally made it to Lac Seul Resort about 1:00 pm, well ahead of the rest of our group. Resort was fine, typical fish camp, loved the drive to location, nice protected docks and right in the middle of the action. Our group of 14 took 6 bass boats and had 1 rental. Walleye were plentiful, eaters, slots and overs, everything caught fish. My boat chased bass and pike, still picked up several wallies. Fished Lac Seul first 3.5 days and caught plenty of bass and several pike. Pike were not very active but we were not specifically targeting them. Day 4 we ventured to Big V. Bass were on fire, caught well over 150 fish in 7 hours of fishing. Repeat on day 5 and throw in a 35.5” Muskie my partner caught, his second trip, I’ve been 40 + times and still have never caught one. 10 minutes left in the trip and 2 gents from the Ontario Conservation Office show up, first time to be checked in all my trips, we were legal except for a few empty beer cans, did get a minor warning about that. Also, they advised, if you only have inflatable life vests in the boat, they must be worn at all times. As usual, I took well over $5k in tackle. Caught 99% of my fish on an 88 cent Beetle Spin. I do replace the jig with a 1/4 ounce jig and a 3 inch Keitech paddle tail swim bait. Could have brought 4 beetle spins and a few bags of plastic and been good. Menu for the week, roast beef with the trimmings (pre-prepared at home), pulled pork, fish, fried chicken nuggets, ribeyes and fish. And no, we did not eat the Muskie!!!! Full breakfast every morning, sandwiches for lunch. Ride home was uneventful as well. Border crossing was easier than entry."

6748399,fishron,2023-07-04 18:00:00,317,Enjoyed your report. Totally agreed on ending up using one or two lures on a trip. We really tried to cut back on our last trip. Ron
6748407,a_hershy,2023-07-04 18:26:00,36,Sounds like a memory maker!Thanks for the report
6748417,Yellowfin123,2023-07-04 19:15:00,2182,"isn't it funny how that works, lug the whole garage to canada and end up using about 5% of what ya take, everybody's guilty of this.. switching things up and going over to big V sounds like a winner...."
6748453,Eckohlt,2023-07-05 03:46:00,3685,I'm innocent on that until proven guilty.lol
6748495,Steve Comerford,2023-07-05 09:59:00,28,"But it can work the other way also. This year, as I was packing for my annual smallmouth trip to Michigan, I vowed to go lighter. I had the box of hard jerk baits in my hand, and put it back on the garage shelf. My buddy in the next boat was CRUSHING them. All I could do was watch......"
6748509,Eckohlt,2023-07-05 10:50:00,3685,"A good buddy would give you one,unless he wanted to torture you,haha"
6748543,Mojo-NC,2023-07-05 12:31:00,1929,"That story is all too common. I always bring up way too much stuff. Whenever I have the hot bait of the day, I always tell my fishing partner that it's my last one (even if I have a dozen of 'em). Then I find one more and use it to barter for liquor, beer, or chores around camp. I just messing with them of course, I want everyone to catch fish and am more than happy to help them do it. It's more for my amusement really..."
6748655,Lac Seul John,2023-07-06 08:43:00,31,Great report - a fun read! I've tried for bass on LS with not alot of luck. The Big V trip you took sounds like it needs to be added to my future itinerary!
