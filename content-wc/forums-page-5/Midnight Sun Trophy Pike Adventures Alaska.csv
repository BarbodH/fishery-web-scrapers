6749259,adempsey2.0,2023-07-10 09:01:00,611,"Yes, they are not photoshopped. Just a wide-angle lens and the fish are held out in some photos. I am sure the measurements/numbers are correct as well."
6749425,pikeandtina,2023-07-10 22:05:00,145,"I never said the measurements were not legit. And yes, you are correct...I've never caught a 50"" pike, guilty as charged!"
6747225,jimwalleye,2023-06-28 11:09:00,30,"I recently returned from Alaska where we fished the Innoko River with Midnight Sun Trophy Pike Adventures. We were the first group that fished this system this year and the water levels were at a 50 year high. When we flew into Holy Cross Alaska from Anchorage, everwhere you looked you could see that the Yukon and Innoko had left their banks and a major flood was underway. This did not set up the desired scenario for a week on the river fishing for pike but we made the most of it. The weather was the real factor with most of the week seeing us layering everything we had in our duffels on our body and wishing for more clothes. The high was 48 degrees and the sustained 30 mile an hour winds and pelting rain made the conditions brutal. Besides that we had to park the houseboat an hour and a half from our fishing grounds so we had that ride each way coming and going daily. Apparently the area we were fishing was in a wildlife refuge and the houseboat couldn't be tied up in those areas without the proper permits. There were a total of four of us on the boat, and two guides, one being the owner Scott Rowekamp. For the week the totals were considered slow, I think I only caught 35 pike myself for the entire week. Actually it was so cold we quit early two days and never even had a bite those days. The houseboat didn't have heat other than the oven so at night I bundled up in many of my clothes and wore a stocking cap to bed and even slept with a stocking cap on with the two sleeping bags open and pulled over my head. It finally warmed up the last two days and the fishing improved. For the week the boat had I believe 14 pike over 40 inches which is sub par but it could have been a lot worse, at least the boat boasted a 46, 48, 49, 49.5 and a 51 inch pike. Here is a picture of my 51 inch pike. I think I can write this off my bucket list now. My friend Keith and I head to Tazin Lake Lodge in July, hopefully the big lake trout are biting. All the big pike were caught on a 2 3/4 inch Johnson Silver Minnow with a white twister tail"
6747237,1shooter,2023-06-28 12:55:00,1493,"Beautiful area and nice fish. I have fished just north of their on the Anvik. We targeted salmon, greyling and to my surprise caught some pike."
6747271,adempsey2.0,2023-06-28 16:32:00,611,"Anything over 48"" is probably worth the trip. Congrats on those. Those are some real trophies! Is this the type of guide service that doesn't let you hold your own fish for pictures? I know some do that. I did get a laugh how they say on their website that 65lb braid is the minimum. I have never caught a pike over 48"", so maybe my 20lb braid isn't enough for that extra couple of inches."
6747275,Eckohlt,2023-06-28 16:48:00,3685,"If you have a good reel you can land them on 8lb test,with 20lb you can turn them south when there heading north."
6747301,kona77,2023-06-28 19:43:00,236,"Thanks for the trip report. Bummer on the high water conditions and crappy weather you had. Congrats on that 51"" monster. That is truly a fish of a lifetime."
6747335,Luckydawg13,2023-06-29 04:44:00,363,I just got back on Monday we flew into Anchorage Train ride to Seward. Then point's south. Yes a cruise. Weather was great no rain temperatures in 50 and 60 absolutely beautiful
6747599,jambi,2023-06-30 09:23:00,504,"Wow Jim what a bummer on the double hit of bad weather and high water. That makes two years in a row with insane water levels. After floods in 2022, by the time we went in July 22 the water level had dropped quite a bit. Our weather was bad too but not quite as bad as yours. There was one afternoon where it was raining sideways and temps in high 40s..but we smoked many over 40 that day with 45, 47, and 49. Our motto was ""Big Pike love Shi55ty weather!"" FYI He'll let you hold them; if you really have to...He's had too many dumb asses drop big fish (and probably killed those monsters I had a replica made of my trophy Much more memorable than a photo.I'm booked in 2024 and 2025"
6749169,wdkott,2023-07-09 13:30:00,26,Please let us know how you do at Tazin. Looking at a possible trip there next summer.
6749207,pikeandtina,2023-07-09 20:32:00,145,"I went directly to their website: Not to say that there is not good fishing there, I'm sure there is, but these photos are horrifically photoshopped. Look at the outlines of the fish...do you see it? Check out the one where you can see the hand indent under and behind the gills...but no hand??? Look at the size of the person's hands holding the fish compared to the size of their head... Again, sure this is a spectacular trip, but ""Buyer beware!"" No disrespect meant to the OP either. Many of us have held HUGE fish in our hands, only to be disappointed when we saw how they looked smaller in the actual photo!"
6749209,pikeandtina,2023-07-09 20:37:00,145,"For sure on that! Subtle, Andrew!"
