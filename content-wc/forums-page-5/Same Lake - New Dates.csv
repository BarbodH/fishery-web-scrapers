We went to another lake on the same system in the Fall of ‘21 and caught tons of fish anywhere from 5-30’. That was 9/4-9/13Assuming you Will experience something similar. If the wind is going pretty good seems the will still stack up on shallower points, humps etc. Good luck 55!!!!"

The walleye were still migrating into the main lake and were concentrated at typical spring locations instead of main lake structure. Of course, maybe that is normal for that lake as it was my first time there, but assume not. I think ice-out was a bit later than normal that year. I doubt you would find those conditions year-after-year, but I suppose it could happen. If you are already fishing main lake structure and current areas, I am sure they will still be there in August."
