6749159,wdkott,2023-07-09 12:40:00,26,We go the Adams Road shortcut as well. Itâ€™s a nice scenic route and in decent condition when I drove it last May.
6749163,prov1800,2023-07-09 12:50:00,5010,Try the ojibway Dr through the rez.when you get to end of Eagle River you can go left there and go down backroad to whaldhooff and then to 17 good drive.different
6748379,ackermannsacre,2023-07-04 14:49:00,196,Is Ojibway Dr between 502 and 594 paved or gravel? Or is it bestr to go up 594 to go west to Vermillion Bay?
6748389,prov1800,2023-07-04 17:33:00,5010,It's paved but rough.then you can either turn right in Eagle River and go to hwy 17 or turn left and take backroad which is smooth to whaldhoff and then get back to hwy 17.
6748393,Deer Lake 1,2023-07-04 17:42:00,12,It's paved and a very nice short cut to Eagle River. Mileage and time saver. Respect the speed zones and the bumps aren't bad at all.
6748403,7 Mag,2023-07-04 18:10:00,1887,I agree I think it's a little rough especially pulling a boat.
6748665,HeHooksHimself,2023-07-06 09:31:00,725,"It is mentioned above but speed bumps for the first time this year on the Ojibway bypass. Then after the village going north the speed limit is 80 km/hr, which is way reckless! When we went in the day Canada opened during covid, there were booths set up where a person would stop you and ask you for your name, address and phone number. I asked him why he wanted to know he said it was his job....I found out later the purpose was to track Covid travels if you succumb to it. I found that rather interesting. I am sure glad those days are over, strange days indeed! Fish On! Hooks"
6748767,Invader21,2023-07-06 19:21:00,105,It's great if you can drive down the middle! LOL. When oncoming traffic arrives at the wrong points (and there are many) you are at risk of trailing off onto a broken down shoulder area.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk
6748773,mswope13,2023-07-06 20:15:00,73,"We typically take 502, left at dead end on 594, and take a right on Adams that I believe takes us out at Oxdrift? If there's a faster way to hit Vermillion Bay before heading up to Ear Falls, I'd like to know! We've been going that way for many years, but would welcome a faster route."
6748793,Web,2023-07-07 07:00:00,7,"We have taken Ojibway Drive as a shortcut for many years.. Yes edges are a bit spicy in areas.. but it is also rare to have oncoming traffic, so going down more towards the center is generally what happens there.. where the edges are broken down is pretty solid gravel and if you keep your speed within reason, taking a trailer over some of that is really no big deal. It definitely is a time saver. Web"
6748803,Ricky Spanish,2023-07-07 08:03:00,1298,We always take Ojibway to Temple Bay and haul our own boat. I've seen much worse roads in WI.
6748805,prov1800,2023-07-07 08:11:00,5010,If you take it easy it's a nice little drive.Going through the rez is interesting and they have a great little store there also.Can fill up with gas also much cheaper than in town and there's some tasty curly fries in there freezer.They also sell minnows also.Speed bumps are in through the rez now.
