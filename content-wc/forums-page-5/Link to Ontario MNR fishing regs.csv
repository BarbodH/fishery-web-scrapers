Not to scare you that rarely happens just a FWI they have a lot of power. Fines are fairly steep also."

The bait store at Sioux Lookout was out of the regulations and out party had no regulations to refer to.:-("

2458474,jimmie,2014-02-17 02:05:00,123,A booklet will be available at the Ft Frances Depot (info center) and Ojibwa Bait just south or Sioux Lookout and Andersons' Lodge on 72 about 3 miles south of town and at the corner of Husdson road and 72 at the gas station and Frog Rapids Resort along the highway if you cannot find the online site useful. Also the info center in Sioux Lookout as you head into town. You can also order 2014 regs online from MNR site. Just do not say I didn't know . . . will not work and cost your $$$$$$$$$ if cought and if they confiscate your license you may have to wait more than a year to fish there again! The worst (most often ) offense seems to be keeping live fish in the live well and then out of slot size. It's not that hard. Ask your resort owner then ask someone at the bait shop then read the signs at the landing!! It's just not that hard to follow the rules. I wanot checked for almost 40 years then I've been checke every years since 2006. Once three times in one day near opening date!!Don't forget your passport or your license!! Make certain your outdoor card id up to date as well. Good luck Jim

You'll find that dealing with any Ontario Government website is like peeling an onion - it takes time and tears. The site listed will link you to the regs for your zone of interest. But first you have to know which zone your destination is in. You can find that here:http://www.fishinontario.com/regs.html However, do not use the zone links on this page Â— they lead you into a confusing maze. If I can help with other local knowledge, within reason, I may be able to help."
