Jeff the lodge manager was talking to them and posted it on their FB page that they were at 1196 walleye by 6/22. Not sure what they ended up with. They fish with a guide all week, always Miah. I'm sure they were down towards or in Nivens every day. I heard they used soft plastics quite a bit this year. The norm was always 10+ dozen minnows per day in years past."
