6748817,Kman67rsss,2023-07-07 09:16:00,30,We rent a house boat from rivière Galette. My family has been using them for 30ish years. They bring a house boat up north and leave it for the season and Air Tamarac transports us. We are just to the east of obedjiwan typically. We were able to get rooms at the hotel mile 22 on the dirt road as of yesterday. As you know there were a lot of unknowns until this past week. Looks like I’ll get my 8yr old his first Canadian fishing trip this year. Not sure who’s more excited.
6748935,Hewhocookstomuch,2023-07-08 06:49:00,66,The Ontario Fire Map has not been updated in weeks. I would like an update on fire SLO44 . It was a huge fire on Pembina River and Bay on Lake Saint Joseph. That area was one of our prime fishing areas on Saint Joseph. Any who has just left Winoga on Saint Joe and report would be appreciated.
6748985,joeflip,2023-07-08 10:29:00,75,"I have noticed the same thing, the fire map in the location of shabuskwia lake has been listed as being observed and not updated in weeks, hopefully something changes, scheduled for a flyout in 2 weeks,"
6749491,Hewhocookstomuch,2023-07-11 08:48:00,66,"I talked with Dick Mansfield yesterday. He said when he did his drop-off at his Saint Joseph cabin this weekend the fires on the Pembina River were out and the smoke was gone. If any guest has pictures of the fire area, please post on W.C. thanks."
6747643,LittleBait,2023-06-30 12:08:00,37,Is there a map website page showing where the fires are? Thanks!
6747649,stjoeguy,2023-06-30 12:42:00,979,This is the Ontario Forest Fire Info website:https://www.lioapplications.lrc.gov....ewer=FFIM.FFIM The site takes a while to load. Then you have to scroll down the page and accept the disclaimer. When the map appears it's easier to view if you unclick the Restricted Fire Zones and the Forest Fire Danger Ratings. Then zoom in to your area using the plus sign.

6748321,farmnfish,2023-07-04 08:15:00,130,"here's one that will show you were the fires are and also you can add layers that will show you how bad the smoke is. https://[email protected],39.9,7zanyone having their trips canceled because of smoke?"
6748323,Mr Ranger,2023-07-04 08:38:00,272,We were in Aroland area last week. Some haze but nothing crazy
6748353,Kman67rsss,2023-07-04 11:13:00,30,I’ve been following the sopfeu sight closely lately. It looks like they just opened access to almost all of the Gouin as of yesterday. Hope it continues to improve up there as we are headed north on the 20th.
6748641,Peterpikes,2023-07-06 07:37:00,33,"Same here. Headed to the Gouin 21st thru 28th. My outfitter posted on Facebook yesterday that the worst is behind them and they look forward to seeing everyone. Sounds like they opened back up, but I’m going to call up there tonight to confirm."
6748729,Peterpikes,2023-07-06 14:40:00,33,"Not sure where on the Gouin you’re going, but I spoke to my outfitter (ceasars north camps) and he’s opening for business. The dirt road into clova, where he flys us from is going to be opened on Monday. Where are you headed? What outfitter?"
