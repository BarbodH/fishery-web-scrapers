6749307,pete kraft,2023-07-10 11:29:00,28,"Not this year, but last August. Stayed in the outbuilding next to the bar on a Friday night. Had a good meal at the restaurant, no issues with bar noise or patrons. It was actually pretty quiet. Room was a little ""tired"" is all. If we go back that way we would stay there again"
