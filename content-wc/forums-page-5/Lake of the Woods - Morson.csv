6746921,birddogger,2023-06-27 05:14:00,43,"Up here now. Leaving in 2 hours. Fished 5 days.Air quality changes with wind direction daily basis. Beautiful yesterday. Three days ago very hazy and could smell smoke . water 72 to 75 at surface. walleye fishing slower than normal but still caught decent fish, biggest 24 inch.. Reefs not as productive for me as some have said.I backtrolled spinners mainly, had some once a year anglers with me. seemed like slower speed put more in the boat for me on one day. depths anywhere from 15 to 24. I tried 10 to 12 but no luck after awhile and gave up"

We didn't really find a magic depth. 15-20' worked in some spots. Other spots we'd find them in 26-28'. Lots of 16-18"" fish for take homes with a couple 19""s and a 22"" mixed in for overs. Big walleye was 29"". Tons of mayflies on the surface in a lot of areas and some still hatching, but the fish were cacking up crayfish in the livewell too. Hoping to make it back in September."
