6748957,Mojo-NC,2023-07-08 08:16:00,1929,"^^^This pretty much covers it. ^^^ It can sometimes it's difficult to tie the double-uni knot, especially in the wind with no spot lock. By the time you get the new knot tied, you can either have drifted out into the middle of the lake or end up on shore about to crash into rocks. That would be a good reason to tie your next jig directly to braid. However, another thing to consider when tying directly to braid, when you get a snag (and at some point you will) you'd better have a glove with you. The ultra thin braided line can can cut right into your skin and sometimes when it finally breaks off it can be like a rifle going off. The stuff is really difficult to break. If you have a fluoro leader, it will always break either at one of the knots or somewhere else on the leader."
6748959,Donscs,2023-07-08 08:23:00,379,"When braid first came out I saw a knot that I've been using for years. I can't find it anywhere on the internet and I believe it may have been illustrated on some literature that came with Fireline. Bill explained it very well and it's a combination of the Trilene Knot and an Improved Clinch Knot. Following the diagram for the Trilene Knot through step 3 but don't cut the line, then following the diagram for the Improved Clinch Knot in step 2 and pass the line through the loop. Used it for years with Fireline and for the last five years with Power Pro and have never had the knot fail. I've been using the improved Clinch Knot for many years and this little modification wasn't hard for me to get used to."
6748961,prov1800,2023-07-08 08:31:00,5010,When I do get a snag and iam tied on to my braid which is 15# stuff I never grab the braid I tighten it up and then grab the spool on my reel so it can't turn and keep rod tip pointed at snag and just pull it will pull loose fast.
6748983,Eckohlt,2023-07-08 10:24:00,3685,"You learn fast what not to do when you get a snag with braid,line can slice through skin like butter."
6749287,emma17,2023-07-10 10:16:00,436,"All in our boat tie direct to jig. We use PowerPro 8 lb. braid. We do fish stained water, maybe that's why we haven't felt a need to tie a leader."
6749303,N_of_Quibell,2023-07-10 11:05:00,151,"I think you're looking for the ""improved trilene knot"". With my geezer eyesight and lack of dexterity, I rely on 60 years of improved clinch knot tying muscle memory to tie knots now, but the improved trilene seems similar enough that I think I might be able to handle it;-)"
6749475,Bill Krejca,2023-07-11 07:48:00,6107,"Re: line cutting. I have several short wooden dowels which I strategically locate in the boat/on my chain of assorted fish tools. When snagged, I wrap the line around the dowel, being careful not to overlap the line, as I feel this could result in the line cutting into itself. I let out enough line so I can sit the rod down, therefore avoiding potential rod damage. It is then fairly easy to just pull on the line until the snag lets loose. Before going to all this effort, I normally try to just pull carefully on the line, sometimes it takes just a small amount of tugging to break free. If this doesn't work, then the dowel will. Pulling by use of the reel drag kinda makes me feel like something bad is gonna happen with the reel/line. Bill"
6749483,prov1800,2023-07-11 08:04:00,5010,Just keep spool from turning Bill.Nothing bad will happen.it will come loose in a hurry or you will be relying.lol.
6749499,Franco,2023-07-11 09:32:00,107,"I do, when Iâ€™m lazy. Typically only with Power Pro moss green or Spiderwire camo."
6748727,jambi,2023-07-06 14:35:00,504,"I do this with no complaints. Few bite offs, Which most have been when I knew I should have retied."
6748731,Huntindave,2023-07-06 14:47:00,2194,Most of the time.
6748739,dstemp,2023-07-06 15:26:00,16,Thanks for all the info and ideas all very good . On last question is there a big difference between Suffix 832 and suffice Premix.
6748753,Bill Krejca,2023-07-06 18:46:00,6107,Whoops! I meant to say improved clinch knot. Had a geezer moment! Bill
6748755,Luckydawg13,2023-07-06 18:59:00,363,I do also use 832
6748771,dstemp,2023-07-06 20:10:00,16,I really appreciate all the great feedback ! Im heading up go LOTW next week be in the Nester Falls area. I will have to put these ideas to use. I think I will try some Suffix 832 I have some Pro Mix but sounds like 832 is betetr I will try it along with my power pro
6748809,eyecatcher1,2023-07-07 08:51:00,323,I do also and don't see any difference.
6748883,Catcrazy3,2023-07-07 17:58:00,146,"I use a clinch knot most of the time, but normally double the line, whether it be through a jig, fas-snap, swivel to mono, or a leader. After I cinch it down, I make one more loop and cinch it at the bottom of the clinch knot, by the eye. I have never had this knot fail or slip."
6748933,Bill Krejca,2023-07-08 06:20:00,6107,"Please give us a report when you get back, I used to spend a lot of time in that area. Thanks Bill"
6748941,prov1800,2023-07-08 07:23:00,5010,I do to at times.if my floura leader breaks at the uni not to main line and I get to lazy to retire a piece of floura back in.If your fishing stained water it doesn't matter much and if the bite is on.Clear water like let's say Cliff Lake and and the west arm of Eagle makes a big difference.So always tie on at least 6 ft of floura.Why take a chance on fussy fish.On lac suel last week we had good bite and broke off leader line and went the lazy way.Did still catch fish but slowed a bit Then tied on my leader line and bite did improve.i make up 4-6 ft lindy rigs and they work great but have tried just braid and that just doesn't do it.So basically for all the time it takes I go through the motions and do it right.
6748603,dstemp,2023-07-05 19:38:00,16,"I have a couple braided line and knot questions. I do hope Im not opening a can of worms. On the subject. I was looking for opinions with Power pro , or other brand's I have used it and pretty happy. But I have had a couple guides recommend Suffix . Second questions is knots what is the most popular knot I have used the Palomar knot but had difficulty with it on braid but ok on Mono . Im just looking for what others use or had good luck with Hopefully some new comers will get some tried and true advise from the seasoned folks on here"
6748621,epiepenburg,2023-07-06 05:43:00,365,"Both Sufix 832 and Power Pro are good. I personally use Sufix 832. On my walleye jigging rods, I run 6lb down to a barrel swivel, then either flourocarbon or monofilament for a leader. This setup has worked well for me for years, and has held up just fine on trips to Canada. I just go with a simple uni knot and haven't had any issues. Prior to using the inline swivel, I would uni to uni knot for tying a leader, but as time goes on, those knots becoming harder and harder to tie while out in the boat."
6748623,terrapin,2023-07-06 06:39:00,353,"I went down the barrel swivel route for a while I got tired of knocking the ceramic out of the first eyelet. Sooner or later someone gets excited and over-reels. I use a double uni to 8# flouro or mono. There are some special knots to tie braid directly to terminal tackle, but I use them so rarely I usually need to look them up.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6748627,10lbeye,2023-07-06 06:44:00,61,"I use an Alberto knot on my jigging rod w/ about 15-20 ft 8 lb mono leader and it recently survived 2 40 inch muskies and a 37 inch pike on a recent Canada trip. I use a long mono leader because, as others have pointed out, any braid to mono knot can be hard to tie in the boat due to wind. Lots of different knots--you just have to find the one you're most comfortable with."
6748637,Mojo-NC,2023-07-06 07:18:00,1929,"You can't go wrong with either PowerPro or Sufix 832. Both are excellent braids and I use them both. I don't think I've ever heard a serious complaint about either, only preferences. I prefer to use a double-uni knot to tie the braid and leader together as opposed to using a small barrel swivel for the reasons indicated. However, if you are experiencing a lot of line twist you might have to use the swivel. I run into line twist when I'm drop-shotting sometimes. You just have to be careful about reeling the swivel through the rod eyelets. If I'm tying braid directly to a steal leader or to a terminal bait, I use the improved clinch knot. Braid doesn't slip with that knot like you might have experienced when using fluorocarbon line. With fluorocarbon line I always tie a Palomar knot."
6748643,Bill Krejca,2023-07-06 07:41:00,6107,"After some failures with various ""new"" suggested knots recommended for braid when it first fit the scene, I found that the old clinch knot can slip on braid, but works like I want it to, simply by doing a double wrap around the swivel/hook/whatever, and then tying the normal way. 'Jis sayin'. Bill"
6748653,eyecatcher1,2023-07-06 08:32:00,323,"I use Suffix 832, a palomar knot or uni to uni and have never had a problem."
6748683,reconssd,2023-07-06 10:50:00,147,I use PowerPro with a trilene knot. Don't forget to get the line wet while you are cinching up the knot.
6748707,55walleyes,2023-07-06 13:30:00,131,Does anyone else tie braid directly to the jig? I do and have no complaints.
6748719,Steve Comerford,2023-07-06 14:12:00,28,"I've tried them all, and for a spinning reel I have gone back to the original FireLine. PowerPro and 832 gave me a higher occurrence of wind knots. As for knots, don't use anything else but a Palomar knot when tying to a jig or snap swivel. Keep practicing, you'll get it. When tying braid onto a fluoro leader (as others discussed) give yourself a long (25 feet) fluoro leader - enough hopefully to last the entire day so that you won't have to retie that double uni knot in the boat. I've grown accustomed to the 'braid to fluoro leader' presentation - drank that Kool Aid a long time ago - but I'd be willing to bet that simply tying 8 pound braid directly to your jighead would have NO impact on your catch rate."
