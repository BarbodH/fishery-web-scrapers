The owner was awesome and the worker was great. The boat was an upgrade and was great. Cabin was very nice. all the essentials. Kitchen, bathroom and a bed is all i need. Border was easy. did everything we were suppose to. Was worried about my expired passport....was no worry. 5 minutes and we were through. Bough groceries on the way up. just the basics. Had fish every night. Easy food so we can fish as much as possible. Now for the fishing: it was amazing. I cant put a number on how many walleye. we tried for a couple days but was ridiculous. I would honeslty say...400 plus walleyes maybe. If we didnt have a fish every 5 minutes we were like...WTF is wrong. ha. We fished Burnt island alot...pats island, fisher point, ethel...really any place i found a point and drop off we caught fish...18-22 foot was the norm. Just a jighead and minnow did the trick for us. range was 14-18 inches mostly. Big fish was a 26 and 24 walleye...nothing huge but was fun. One night it was really windy so I stayed by the camp....i picked a wind blown shoreline...put the boat on drift in about 12-14 feet of water...caught like 25-30 walleye in about 1.5 hours. nothing huge but was alot of fun....even got into some really nice perch. the weather was perfect. It was an amazing week and so grateful i decided to go at the last second. Put this trip together on a tuesday night...called the camp owner..she said..come on up...called my buddy and we left friday morning. my best week up there in 40 years for sure. my only issue...my fillet knife was really dull. ha."
