6748831,Megatron,2023-07-07 10:39:00,13,"Yep, the island circled is Taylor’s. Better be careful in that area of the lake. Lots of hazards if you don’t know what you’re doing . . ."
6748849,bishyfishy,2023-07-07 13:39:00,5,Thanks all for the info. I'll have to check out that area next year when we make our trek up to Lac Seul.
6748851,Megatron,2023-07-07 13:49:00,13,Where do you usually launch from and typically spend your time fishing?
6748859,kayakmatt,2023-07-07 14:15:00,105,"Just got back from Lac Seul. Spent a day with a guide that took wife and I all the way from Hudson to past Taylor Island. Long run. surprisingly, more boats there that I expected. Many fishing boats from the parked houseboats in the area, and some boats from Lac Seul Outposts. Crazy big, seemingly endless, and creepy remote with whitecaps and no sun on the water. If I were navigating, even with my Navionics map, I would not want to get too far off the motor routes for fear of the numerous shallow shoals not marked either on the map or floating buoys. But then, I'm a rookie to this lake.Anyway, our guide pulled us on a single spot, and we caught over a hundred walleye. Biggest was only about 22"". I would think these are hundreds, if not thousands of similar spots in the mid eastern section of LS."
6748863,kayakmatt,2023-07-07 14:22:00,105,Taylor Island is mentioned on the navigation maps where the markers change from Red Right to Green Right as you exit the English River and into the Root River. Confusing.
6748931,cuamb,2023-07-08 06:17:00,203,"When you go from Hudson to Taylor Island you are going down stream. Once you go past Taylor and head towards Bear Narrows you are going up stream, thus the change. If you go left at Taylor Island and head towards Windy Narrows you will still be going down stream and the markers do not change. Be careful and make sure you know where you are. A good map (electronic or paper) that shows routes will be extremely helpful."
6748947,pjshorthorn,2023-07-08 07:48:00,5654,That is it. Lots of Houseboats from Hudson beach there nowadays. Back in 1980's we were allowed to tent camp there through OJibway outfitter's via permits. Been cruising past that Island for 40 years now. PjShorthorn
6748953,prov1800,2023-07-08 08:09:00,5010,Iam no expert when it comes to the east end and up to Chamberlain.Have some railroad buddies that have taken me up there.Great place to fish but have launched my boat a few times at Deception and have fished that area and must say the fishing is good to great and basically have that part of the lake to myself as it seems most boats like to travell far.I personally don't like seeing many boats on my fishing days.Find the long boat ride to long and way to many boats up there plus house boats.But everyone talking about these areas is what brings attention to them.Those areas were much quieter in the old days when boats were smaller and slower.Its the same on our west end.The farther you go the more traffic.But again I don't go far there either and basically get certain parts to myself.
6748989,stjoeguy,2023-07-08 11:22:00,979,Being a St Joe guy I also prefer a lake with little or no other boats. Where would you say is the quietest part of Lac Seul? I've been to Onaway and Lac Seul Outposts and once out of the Deception landing.
6748991,prov1800,2023-07-08 11:26:00,5010,I would say the stretch from bay of islands toward Steamboat narrows.Youll see boats coming from earfalls to fish the Mckenzie bay area but not many stop between steamboat and mckenzie
6664968,Big Louie,2022-06-15 13:16:00,22,Anyone have a fishing report from the Taylor Island area of Lac Seul?
6665014,prov1800,2022-06-15 14:51:00,5010,"Would take a wild guess and say ""AMAZING.basically a no brainer. It's Lac Suel"
6665228,mwh624,2022-06-16 08:37:00,183,They'll be stacked somewhere between Bear Narrows and Perch Ripple....
6665272,pjshorthorn,2022-06-16 13:17:00,5654,I've made that run from Taylor to where you speak of long way unless you have a big motor and one doesn't mind paying the fuel bill. PjShorthorn
6665384,Big Louie,2022-06-17 05:50:00,22,"We generally fish about 2-4 miles NW of Taylor and do very well, but we have never fished the area in June and we were wondering what the bite has been like recently. i have made the run from Taylor to past Chamberlain and honestly, the fishing wasn't as good as what we had closer to Taylor. Now, we didn't give it that much time so it's probably not a fair omparison."
6748737,bishyfishy,2023-07-06 15:20:00,5,Where is the Taylor Island are of Lac Seul? I see it referenced many times but haven't been able to locate it on any maps i've googled.
6748777,Lmbkiller,2023-07-06 21:36:00,639,"Then don't worry about it cuz it's so easy to find on a map, google, navionics etc if u havnt found it just move on"
6748807,prov1800,2023-07-07 08:21:00,5010,Walleyes are stacked up everywhere on Lac Suel wether your fishing the east or west side.I basically fish the west side and never have to travell far to get get to good fishing.If I use my own boat why tavell so far and burn a bunch of gas for the same result within 3 Mike's of where I launch.Part I like fishing close is every other boat is going long range and I have some great fishing spots to myself.If I yse camp boats and go farther then you get into more traffic and could have a couple of hours running time.
6748819,bishyfishy,2023-07-07 09:19:00,5,Are there any other landmarks on the maps i can reference to find Taylor Island? Fishing must be good in that area.
6748829,stjoeguy,2023-07-07 10:33:00,979,"Hopefully a Lac Seul expert like prov1800 can jump in, but this is what I found. These are screenshots of a map of the SE section of Lac Seul. The Taylor Island that I found is circled in the zoomed-in picture."
