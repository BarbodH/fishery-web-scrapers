The dirt road leading to his plane base is scheduled to be opened on Monday and things are getting back to normal. These outfitters have been hit hard the last few years with Covid and now the fires. It’s good to see they will be able to salvage the remainder of the season. I’m headed up in 2 weeks and was wondering if anyone had any insight on the water levels or fishing reports? I know it’s very wind dependent, but what has the air quality been like on the Gouin? Most of the people who I keep in touch with that fish there have rescheduled their trips to later in the summer so I have not gotten a single report yet for this year."

6749119,Kman67rsss,2023-07-09 10:29:00,30,I just looked up clova as I’ve heard of it but never been there. It’s quite a bit further west from the route we take. We go in from La tuque on the east side.
