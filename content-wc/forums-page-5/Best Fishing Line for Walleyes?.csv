6749407,Clairebear,2023-07-10 19:30:00,937,"I'm still addicted to Stren Flourescent, mainly because I can easily see where it exits the water when netting."
6749497,Franco,2023-07-11 09:28:00,107,"You’re thinking flouro leaders. I understand that, but Invizix is not a flouro leader line like Gold or Blue label. It is specially marketed as a main line flouro…and as a main line it sucks."
6749509,stumcfar,2023-07-11 10:07:00,451,I am an #8 Trilene guy. I like to set the hook and mono allows me to do that.
6749553,last chance,2023-07-11 11:40:00,3262,"you are DA MAN. 8# Trilene XL has been my go to line for 60 years for most of my fishing. now I do use braid in heavy cover or trolling divers on Erie and heavy mono for larger fish. but for casting or jigging for walleye, bass, or panfish, the 8# XL just hasn't been beaten as far as my fishing goes."
6749561,Walleye2242,2023-07-11 12:10:00,263,Just the ole Trilene XL 6lb. Works great for me i guess.
6749007,rpbadger,2023-07-08 15:58:00,22,"All right fellas. Been fishing in Canada many years and have never settled on a favorite line. Have had some weird experiences with flourocarbon, don't want to spend time tying leaders on braid, and have used a lot of mono. My buddy swears by 7 lb. Sunline Assassin. I fish mostly jigging, backtrolling, and use Jiggin' Raps as well. Prefer 8 lb. line. What's your favorite?"
6749011,Wallychowder,2023-07-08 16:27:00,1567,Absolutely the best I've ever used !
6749013,last chance,2023-07-08 16:34:00,3262,"for eye fishing in open water I have settled on Trilene XL 8# now for most all my fishing. it doesn't curl up like other lines. the only time i use braid for eyes is at night when i need the extra sensitivity. and now i am going to do some experimenting with some high visibility 10# for pond fishing for bass when I'm fishing plastic worms. if you do have trouble detecting bites then you should try invis-x seaguar Fluro 8# line. but you can just put enough of it on top to save a few cents or fill your reel with it. the other option is to use 15# braid with a short fluro leader, and i like seaguar premium Fluro for leaders."
6749017,johnboat,2023-07-08 17:08:00,2014,Vanish Transition in the Gold Box. 6 lb. The entire reel. Spool it on right and 0 line twist.
6749021,7 Mag,2023-07-08 17:32:00,1887,I prefer the sensitivity of braid but I do have a couple of reels spooled with 10 lb Suffix Elite mono for jigging raps.
6749067,cuamb,2023-07-09 06:55:00,203,There a lot of options and you just need to find the one that you have confidence in. That means lots of fishing to see what you like. Below is a short youtube video on the subject with Al Lindner.https://youtu.be/0CwNI7MDY1s
6749085,Mojo-NC,2023-07-09 07:59:00,1929,"I really like P-Line Floroclear. According to the manufacturer: With Floroclear's fluorocarbon coating the line is virtually invisible once it enters the water. This gives anglers the advantage of a more stealthy presentation, which will guarantee more strikes and hookups. With a special silicone treatment, Floroclear has reduced memory and increased castability. I've been using it for years and can attest to the reduced memory, especially when compared with pure fluorocarbon line. It's reasonably priced and is a nice blend of mono and fluoro."
6749343,Steve Comerford,2023-07-10 14:33:00,28,"rpbadger - I'd recommend you rethink this whole approach. Fluorocarbon can be difficult if it's the only line spooled on your reel, but as a leader it works wonderfully. As to 'don't want to spend time tying leaders on braid,' I would persuade you to take the time - it's time well spent. At home, simply learn to tie a good uni-to-uni knot from mainline braid to the fluorocarbon leader. Then give yourself a good 25 feet of fluorocarbon leader. This will (hopefully) ensure that you have enough leader for the next day's fishing, and don't have to tie the uni-to-uni knot in the boat, which is a pain. The result is you have braid's sensitivity and ease of casting, and fluorocarbon's invisibility. I use Berkley ORIGINAL Fireline mainline and Seaguar fluoro leader."
6749383,Franco,2023-07-10 17:08:00,107,"Power pro (original or superslick) in moss green or Spiderwire stealth camo braid, both in 8 lb test. No leader required, at least not for the low-pressure, tea-coloured lakes of northern Ontario, where I usually fish. I just tried Seaguar invizix again, just to make sure I hate it…yep, I do. Jumps off the spool and is waaaay too stretchy for me."
6749391,prov1800,2023-07-10 17:47:00,5010,As Steve said.You can't put floura on your reel as a main line.I have a lot of guests I guide and they instantly have problems with the floura that gets put on in fishing stores when they purchase a new reels.apparantly some of the workers in these stores know nothing.
