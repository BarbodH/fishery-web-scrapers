My question is.......how is the July-August smallmouth bass fishing? I know the guides at Silver Water Wheel Lodge find smallmouth shallow and active until late June, then the fish disappear; the guides COMPLETELY STOP fishing smallmouth. I'm planning a mid-late July Lac Seul trip - west end, probably Goose Bay Lodge. Can anyone comment as to what the fishing is like?"

We still throw cranks at some rock piles and catch them, too.I do not catch as many smallies in the western end. They seem to be more predominant in the mid sections starting at about McKenzie Bay and getting better the further east you go. We fish out of Mahkwa in late August and always catch some lard butt SMB fishing for walleye. Jigging, but mostly trolling spinners. Last year we caught very few accidental SMB. Most years we always tally numerous 20"" and above accidentally.They are there and still have to feed. They are a blast to catch.Pooch"
6749345,prov1800,2023-07-10 14:38:00,5010,Here's what's probably happening Early walleye season when there shallow guys are catching bass walleye fishing.Dont think many are targeting bass.Once walleyes start moving out a bit deeper bass stay were they are a while longer.So walleyes guys move out of the shallows and very few bass hence don't here much more about the bass.Bass will move deeper in the season toward fall but you can still catch most of summer in 5-10 ft.
6749347,Steve Comerford,2023-07-10 14:42:00,28,"Pooch, I really like the location of that Mahkwa Lodge. Is it well run? Can you bring your own boat?"
6749359,prov1800,2023-07-10 15:21:00,5010,Plenty of bass throughout the entire basin from east to west.Western area has tons.
6749399,TMF89,2023-07-10 18:36:00,77,"We'll be heading up there the first week of September, and while it'll be our first time, I've heard nothing but good things about the fishing, and nothing but good things about the new ownership and how things have apparently changed up there over the last few years. I do know you can bring your own boat, that's what we'll be doing."
6749515,JDP,2023-07-11 10:17:00,1457,https://mahkwa.com/ I have been going to Mahkwa Lodge since 2005. They have American Plan and Housekeeping Plan. You can bring your own boat. They have rental boats available.
6749597,Mojo-NC,2023-07-11 14:46:00,1929,We fished the Chamberlain Narrows area of Lac Seul last July and only caught a handful of smallies all week. We did not intentionally fish for them and every one we caught was while trolling crankbaits. I had expected to catch more while pulling spinner rigs and jigging.
