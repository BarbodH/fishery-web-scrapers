6748911,Spurgery,2023-07-07 21:31:00,79,Is the mayfly hatch done? We were up north of Red Lake about a week ago and the first couple days saw a lot of dead mayflies in the bays. Later in the week didn’t see nearly as many. I was surprised considering how warm the water was that we were catching fish in as shallow as 5 foot at times. Using a Carolina rig with floating jig head the fish had to be barely 1-2 foot below the surface when taking the bait. Maybe thought they were up that shallow because they were looking for the mayflies they had been feeding on. But in another spot we caught fish in 25 foot deep so &#x1f937;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;….
6748927,prov1800,2023-07-08 05:34:00,5010,"Pretty much done but still see bodies here and there.some spots still hold walleyes shallow and weeklies still good to, others are going deeper."
