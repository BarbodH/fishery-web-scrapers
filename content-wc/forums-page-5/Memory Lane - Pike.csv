He moved down to AL and When I turned 16 (17 years ago) my dad took me. It was amazing. We fished Armit Lake with Hidden Bay Lodge and was able to catch a fish of a lifetime, for me at least. Over Father’s Day, we went down memory lane and relived our trip. I told him I always wanted to get a replica made and we both decided I should after all of these years. I never met my grandad so this in someway is in honor of him since he started the fishing trip tradition with my dad. Not a monster but wanted to share!"

One of my treasures is a picture of him holding two nice pike , like your's, on the dock at his friend's cabin on Wapesi Lake. He has been going fishing with me every year even though he passed away 28 years ago .I bring his picture with me every trip no matter what. PjShorthorn"

Made my first trip in 1991, and have been going annually since. Finally was able to afford an rv spot and now keep a pop up camper up there. Gpas last year was 2013. Had my oldest son with me for his first year. Four generations of us fishing together on a trip started 60 years ago. Thanks for all the memories gpa . . ."

In my case it was my grandmother- her sister and brother in law owned a resort in Northern Minnesota. Every year my grandmother would take us for a couple weeks, riding in the Greyhound bus. Eventually I took my sons to the same resort (long since sold) on their first fishing trip, which led to our annual Canada trips. Thank God. I hope the replica turns out great."
