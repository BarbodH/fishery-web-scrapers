Can anyone confirm this, and if so, is this a common forage for walleyes that time of year? I don't recall seeing that in four previous trips. Thanks."

Here on the west end it was fresh water shrimp carcasses; looks like mayfly larvae but more granular. Mayfly stuff is more dark and messy; expect to see it in the next couple weeks. Water also too cold for mayfly larvae this early this year. Fresh water shrimp are a very important forage base for many northern walleye lakes, especially for the younger year classes. In some areas on Lac Seul, like Vaugne(sp) Bay, they are the primary food source."
