540476,Guest,2004-06-09 11:21:00,0,"Just got back from Halleys Camp at Caribou Fals on the English River. Fishing was excellent! We did not catch huge numbers but we caught good numbers of larger fish. One morning my boat had a 27, 2@24 and 2@20. We never had a tough time catching our two fish under 18"" to eat. We had 14 guys in 5 boats and all had good fishing. What did we use? White twister (PowerBait, Gulp, Standard) with a pink/orange/red head Crank Bait (Rat-l-trap, Frenzy, Rapala) rattling with Blue/Silver Bottom Bouncers / Spinners (I used Northland gum drops with stinger) Live Bait on spinners were crawlers or minnows Most fish were caught casting to shore or in the stumps. We also had good luck Bottom Bouncing in Tourist Lake and on the flat by Bear Point. BTW We caught some 12"" + perch while bottom bouncing... made for good snack. We also had quite a few bears in camp this year. Erik"
