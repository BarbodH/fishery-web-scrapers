540493,Guest,2004-06-09 19:33:00,0,Going to LOTW last week in June and need advice on spinner rigs. Has anyone used the Cabela's spinner rigs. If so were they successful the blades seems awful small compared to what I have used on Lac Seul. Any other advise you could give would be appreciated. We plan to take some crawlers with us and get minnows in Morson.

I start with pre tied snells, I get the 3 hook snells from Cabela's, you can but a 10 pack for around $4.50. Then I bought a multi pack of beads, and some blades. Finally I have some of theose quick change clips for the blades. The advantages are they are cheaper, you can build any color combination and with the quick change blades, you keep changing color and size top find what is working best. Another thing I like is the plastic sliders for the weights. This way the line can slide through the weight giving you the most feel. All these things can be found at Cabela's"

Just do a few searches on snell tying and it will be easy to learn. Buy some components from Staminainc.com and you're on your way. I'd be happy to answer any questions on snelling or acquiring components that I can."

I much prefer the snells with the quick change clevis the first post mentioned, that way you can change blade sizes, shapes and colors without re-tying. If you are buying them now, I would definitely get the 3 hook snells for LOTW, as I would expect to use worms up there almost exclusively whether jigging or bottom bouncing the end of June through the rest of the summer. Minnows and leaches can be a hassle to keep alive, and do not seem to up the odds much if at all."

You can build lots of rigs, with as many combinations as you can think of in your spare time. It is a good thing to do when you want to ""unwind"" after work in the evenings. Good luck! Go_Fish"
