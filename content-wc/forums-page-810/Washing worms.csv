540466,PigBoy,2004-06-09 07:16:00,120,Anyone have a trick for cleaning crawlers out of the soil to put them in bedding for the trip across the border? I usually get a five gallon bucket of water and grab a handful of crawlers and dip them in to rinse off the soil. Any other tricks would be appreciated. We are taking a flat from the states as a backup in case there is a problem with the two flats on order in Kenora. Magic or Buss' bedding??
