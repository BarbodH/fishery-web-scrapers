If any of you guys have fished there I would like your oppinion on a good lake (most remote, good waleye & big northern). I was interested in Crossland. Their wesite talked about the unusual coloration of the pike there and suggested that they might be apart musky.? If anyone has caught one, I would love to see a pic."

I've fished with L&M Fly In, excellent lakes, service, & accommodations. You should check them out. If you really want BIG PIKE you should try to get into Dobie or Wright Lake. Those two lakes are great for Big Pike. Every year they have some 45-49"". The biggest I've ever boated is 47"", they promote catch & release and it really is paying off. We catch quite a few 35""-40"" pike each trip. You'll catch more walleyes than you know what to do wiyh to. You should really look them up on the web and get in contact w/ them soon if want to try and get in in May or June next year because they really fill up fast. Hope this helps you."

Uwsed only jigs. Size is somewhat small 1-2 lbs. Largest northern was 24 lbs at mouth of river. Cabins are great! All beer and soft drinks at lake use on honor system and pay for them when you leave. They check on you twice a week and will bring anything you need by leaving them a note on a chalkboard. I would go there again anytime. Ron"
