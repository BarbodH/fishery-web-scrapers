540423,FIB,2004-06-08 10:45:00,23,"Call me flashy. 1/8 oz white, with 2"" powerbait white tail. At least until before Labor Day."
540426,Guest,2004-06-08 12:07:00,0,"Orange and Chartreuse. 1/8, 1/4 and 3/8. No other jigs needed."
540431,Guest,2004-06-08 12:56:00,0,"I believe that is called ""bubble gum"". I like that and chartreuse/orange, too."
540434,Guest,2004-06-08 14:26:00,0,"Chartreuse and orange in 1/8 oz., 1/4 oz. or 3/8 oz. all the way. Like Link said, no need for anything else. I use a 3"" power bait grub in the color which I believe they call chartreuse, but which is really a brownish/motor oil/pumpkin seed color body with a chartreuse tail. I rarely switch to any other colors. My fishing buddies seem to switch a lot and end up coming back to my old standby. I did try the new Gulp this spring on Erie, and went back to the standard powerbait grug because my buddy started out fishing me. By the way, I use the same jig and grub combo with worms, minnows and leaches, and it is also deadly on smallmouth."
540445,Guest,2004-06-08 16:53:00,0,"Depending on the wind, and at what depth you're fishing, anywhere from 1/4-3/8 oz. with a 1 1/2 to 2"" tube bait or 3"" power grub. Doesn't matter what color you use, as long as it's chartreuse."

Seriously though, a few 1/16, a bunch of 1/8, a bigger bunch of 1/4 and a few 3/8 is all I ever take to Canada. I do take a number of colors. My favorite is one I make myself and have never seen commercially-bright orange with the top of the jig green chartreuse. Best combo. hands down for the last 5 years. Tip it with a 4"" silk chartreuse or 3"" yellow powerbait tail. I firmly believe that color makes a difference. I have seen a lot of instances where two guys in the same boat, fishing the same way, with the same line, and the same skill level catch different amounts of fish based on color. Switch to the ""hot"" color and the catch rate goes up. Chartreuse is a good first choice, but always have some back ups. Pink/white, Orange/Green Chartreuse, Yellow Chartreuse/Orange, Black/green chartreuse, glow green chartreuse, and glow yellow chartreuse make up 90% of my jigs."
540490,Guest,2004-06-09 15:31:00,0,1/4-3/8 white jig red eye tipped with a minnow can't keep them off. Were I fish the water is clear lake is is long and not classified as very deep. I find using twin rubber tail in white or green works great with a white jig head. I use this to attract them to the boat then by casting then after a fw minutes i drop the white jig tipped with minnow.
