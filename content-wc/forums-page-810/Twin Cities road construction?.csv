540480,Guest,2004-06-09 12:11:00,0,Any advice on which branch of I-35 to take through the Twin Cities?
540481,Guest,2004-06-09 12:31:00,0,35e thru St. Paul. South there is construction and creates bottlenecks
540487,Guest,2004-06-09 14:52:00,0,Best option 34W What time a day will you be passing through? 6:30 - 9:00 am and 2:30 to 6:30 pm = a bad time to visit our lovely area. Unless were talking Saturday or Sunday
540491,Guest,2004-06-09 16:39:00,0,We should hit the south end of the metro area around 2:00 on Friday afternoon.
540492,Guest,2004-06-09 19:02:00,0,Best to hit 35E through St Paul.
