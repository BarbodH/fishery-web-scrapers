540413,Guest,2004-06-07 19:05:00,0,We start a small dump site about 50 yards back from where we camp. We've been going back for years and some of our first stuff is starting to rust. In a few years it will be all gone. Whats the big deal. It's only unpopulated bush.
540421,Guest,2004-06-08 09:30:00,0,That's disgusting. Take your garbage out and dispose of it the way your suppose to. That's the big deal.

If you were at a boat in cabin, how would you legally get your cans and bottles in for the deposit? Don't tell me that if you don't smell of alcohol, it would be OK. We have all known cops that enforce laws to the extreme."

540355,Guest,2004-06-05 15:27:00,0,"Come on guys, some of you seem to know all about Canadian Law. I'd really like to know. If I load the empty beer bottles into my boat-at the cabin- to go back to my truck, which is parked at a boat ramp across the lake, I am violating Canadian law. If I forget the deposit and pitch them in the weeds or sink them in the lake, I'm probably violating another statute, not to mention creating an eyesore. I doubt that Sgt. Preston of the Yukon, and his faithful companion King, would just happen by and take them back to the truck for me."
540356,TECK,2004-06-05 20:02:00,151,Burn the cans pick them up after the fire is out and take them back. That what a frend was told to do so he would not get a ticket.
540358,Matches,2004-06-05 21:53:00,236,"What do you mean at a boat in a cabin? If you mean you are transporting from land to an island, you are fine. The law reads if you are transporting from land to to your resort or cabin, that is legal. Fishing and having the empties in the boat is not legal. I would never do that!"
540361,Guest,2004-06-05 23:34:00,0,"Matches, At one time I had use of a cabin that you had to boat into. We would stop at the beer store in Sioux Lookout before heading to the cabin. There was a deposit on the beer cans or bottles-I imagine there still is. My question is: If, as many have stated, an empty liquor container is considered evidence that you are drinking in the boat-which is illegal, how would I get my empties back to the truck so I could get my deposit back? According to statements on this site, if I had an empty liquor bottle in a bag of trash, I could be fined. (Don't tell me it wouldn't be enforced. I've run into a few wardens and cops that enforce things to the letter.) If this is the law, I'd have to leave all empty liquor containers at the cabin, which would not make the cabin owner very happy. The other alternatives are 1) toss them in the woods behind the cabin, 2) sink them in the lake, 3) dig a hole and bury them, or 4) wait for a RCMP officer, such a Sgt. Preston, and ask him to transport the empties for me. Options 1 & 2 would be an eyesore, strain my relationship with the owner and probably be considered littering and water pollution. Option 4 is highly unlikely. Option 3-probably the most viable-but you lose your deposit and you end up with a lot of holes full of garbage all around the cabin."
540367,Guest,2004-06-06 08:25:00,0,The whole rule against drinking in the boat/transporting empties seems like an overdone law. I think we all agree you need to drink responsibly. Wouldn't a better rule simply be the common sense rule that it is illegel to be intoxicated while driving the boat. The by the book rule that you can't drink a beer at your shore lunch and transport the empties back to camp is silly. This rule treats adults like children. What is the logic?
540369,bigfish1965,2004-06-06 08:31:00,3210,"Unfortunately too many people cannot act like adults when given such hefty responsibilites. Yes you can transport the empties back across the water. It is illegal to CONSUME alcohol in a boat, not illegal to have it for transportation."
540370,Matches,2004-06-06 10:45:00,236,"Also, you would be safer by transporting the empties in a closed container. According to this link, you can have it in the boat if the seal is not broken or is being stored in a closed container/compartment?http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/DBLaws/S...htm#P565_52066"
540390,Guest,2004-06-07 05:24:00,0,"riverrat... first of all when u went to camp did u not transport your beer in the boat... unopened case(s)?? Yes u did Well u do the same going back...put empties in a garbage bag...tie it up ,put in front of boat away from u. do not drink the day u r leaving n there should not be a problem....if u r stopped by mnr just explain to them u r returning your empties in sealed bag for return deposit....the mnr r not that bad...they realize that garbage has to come back across the lake...and also remember to put empties in back of truck also... hope this helps"
