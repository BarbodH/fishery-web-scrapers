I have an assortment of blades already but want to make sure I have the style that would work best. Most of my bottom bouncing has been done on LOTW in recent years."

540495,Mark R,2004-06-09 19:51:00,1538,Sliver and Gold work real well a large blade with a deep cup provides lots of thump. I never used crawlers ussually minnow did the trick. Lst us know how crawlers work out
540506,Guest,2004-06-10 06:01:00,0,"We used spinner rigs religiously when we were on Lac Seul last year, baited with nightcrawlers (never used minnows). We had no problems catching fish, we couldn't keep them off the hook. Bring a flat of them (500) in worm bedding, you'll be set for the week. A flat usually costs about $40.00"

We stuck with minnows last year, however I think we are going to bring some worms with us this year and give them a try. After a week of fishing on LS anyone feels like a pro walleye fisherman!"
