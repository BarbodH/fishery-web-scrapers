The past few years we have been going through Nester Falls since they actual sell large and jumbo leeches. But I want to go 502 this trip to save some time and would like to buy leeches in Ft Frances. Over the years I have seen the leeches people pick up in Ft Frances and they are pathetic (they call them large or jumbo, but they are not even close). I am really picky when it comes to my leeches and was wondering if anyone has found good leeches this year in Ft. Frances? Thanks in advance for the help."
