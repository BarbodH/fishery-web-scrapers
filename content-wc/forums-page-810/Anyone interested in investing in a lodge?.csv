We will be buying a world class fly in lodge this week and we really need a little more capital. The fishery is world class for walleyes and trophy pike. It is located in Manitoba. This is a great opportunity for someone who goes to Manitoba often on fly in fishing trips. Without giving all of the detalis, if you invest with us in 6 years you will fish for free on one of four world class trophy pike and walleye lakes for the rest of your life. Please e-mail me at [email protected] if you would like more details. Thanks!!"

540397,Guest,2004-06-07 10:04:00,0,I looked at this opportunity and it is a great investment and fishing opportunity for the right person. It is very well thought through and organized. Dont hesitate too at look at it if you are interested. The only reason we didnt become involved in this Lodge is my wife and I just opened a new business and felt we needed to focus our time and funds on it.

540452,pike nut,2004-06-08 19:38:00,23,"Drift sock, One should not pass judgement on anything he knows nothing about. You have no idea what our plans are nor will you ever. Mike Kansas has looked into this in depth and others have as well from thsi board and i would hope that anybody who reads this post will take the word of somebody who looked into it vs. somebody who knows nothing at all about it. We have done our due dilgence and we have covered our bases and for you to accuse me of trying to find a ""sucker"" is very ignorant on your part. By the way, we don't need the capital to move forward. We are NOT under capitalized."
