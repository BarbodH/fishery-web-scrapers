There's regular provincial liscences, plus liscences to fish the many Zec's, plus liscences and permits to fish the many wildlife preserves. In addition to that many excellent fishing opportunities are available only by entering a lottery. Much, much more involved than fishing in Ontario."
540465,retire55,2004-06-09 07:16:00,1029,"For what its worth, use of artificial lights is illegal with a few exceptions. Perhaps a review of Ontario's Fishing Regulations would help. ""It is illegal to use artificial lights to attract fish except: - to fish for smelt, or to fish for lake whitefish or lake herring with a dip net; - if the light is part of a lure attached to a line used in angling;""http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/fi...nfo_fr2004.pdf"
540468,retire55,2004-06-09 07:52:00,1029,"Wag: Most Ontario residents don't take too kindly to anyone disrespecting our fishing regulations, even when its done sometimes in jest. Why? Reports about non-resident fishermen getting busted because they didn't respect our laws. Case in point. It was reported that 3 US residents got busted 25 May 04 with 41 frozen and partially frozen walleye fillets and 12 northerns over their legal limit. Reference is: http://www.thefishingnews.com/cgi-bin/news_wire.pl"
540488,Brax,2004-06-09 15:14:00,52,"Non-residents aren't the only violators. I would bet many locals disregard the possession limit. They may only take their daily bag limit, but a check of their freezer would undoubtedly turn up some that were over their limit. Two years ago a large lodge in LOTW was caught doing this very thing. Don't get me wrong, I do not condone anyone violating the game laws, but for you to single out the non-residents in not fair either. The people that violate are not fishermen or sportsmen, just scum that rape the resource."
540427,cptnding,2004-06-08 12:22:00,30,"Does anyone know if fishing at night with the aid of bait attracting lights is legal in Canada (NW Ontario)? I have never heard otherwise but don't want to get busted either! Thanks, David"
540429,Guest,2004-06-08 12:52:00,0,"The bugs look forward every year, to the crazy Americans coming with their lights. :) It is legal in Sask. I don't know about Ontario."
540435,Guest,2004-06-08 14:27:00,0,"I have been doing it for years, so I sure hope it is. A couple of lodges I have stayed at indicated it was no problem, except as pointed out for the mosquitos, the submerged rocks, etc., etc."
540436,Guest,2004-06-08 14:38:00,0,"Nope, not legal at least in Ontario, no doubt about it."
540439,Guest,2004-06-08 14:46:00,0,It is Illegal clearly spelled out in the regulationshttp://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/fishing/fishRegs/2004/Info_fr2004.pdf.....
540443,cptnding,2004-06-08 16:11:00,30,HHmmmmm..... I wonder how much the fine is? :) Just kidding!! I heard next year they are going to require rubber hooks.
540444,Guest,2004-06-08 16:45:00,0,"Bio-degradable, barbless, rubber hooks. The limit will be 2 walleyes under 16"" and any walleyes eaten will count on your posession limit. Shore lunches will be outlawed as the number of fish consumed cannot be disproven. Empty alcohol containers found at remote campsites will constitute a violation. Illegal because this constitures having an open container in posession while being at an illegal location for consumption. Yep, next year, just mail the money you would have spent there, to Canada. It is the only legal thing to do. :)"
540447,Guest,2004-06-08 17:30:00,0,"Personally I don't think the fishing regulations are excessive in my province. Just try navigating the quagmire that exists in Quebec in comparison and I'm sure you'll agree. As far as using lights to attract fish go, it's certainly not necessary to catch fish and in my opinion not very sporting anyways. It's in the same vein as baiting for bear. Personally I prefer stalking the animal as opposed to sitting on my butt and waiting with baited (no pun intended) breath while an unsuspecting bruin ambles my way for his daily feed of honey crullers. In conclusion, when I visit the States for a fishing trip I respect your laws unflinchingly. I expect the same from Americans who visit my country."
540450,Guest,2004-06-08 18:14:00,0,It's illegal and the fine is a lot up to the discretion of the Officer. Usually they take all your gear and may give it back to you if the Judge is having a good day. If you've got a real southern drawl or call him boy you'll surely put a smile on his face. The fines are also going up..to reflect the real cost of doing business.$1000 is more the fines I'm seeing now. It's always a good idea to be polite in a Foreign country even Canada. Being impaired in the boat and getting caught by the OPP will get you charged and then deported after a weekend or more in jail. Attitude willmost likely get you a bunk mate name Biff or Tiger.
540457,Alces,2004-06-09 05:02:00,35,"What do you mean ""quagmire that exists in Quebec"" it is legal to fish at night in Québec as long as you have an anchor light turned on at all time. It is legal to have open cans of beer in a boat as long as the person in charge of operating it is not drinking It is legal to have an open case of beer in your boat, in your car etc...as long as you are not impaired. It is legal to drink beer while you are on a beach fishing, swimming, having lunch, as a matter of fact it is legal to live a normal life as long as you are not drunk. It is also legal to carry empty cans of beer from your boat to your camp without beeing harrassed by anyone thinking you've been drinking while operating a boat. Think about it, it is not illegal to drink while boating in all the provinces, but it is sure stupid to do so in all of them....including Québec"
