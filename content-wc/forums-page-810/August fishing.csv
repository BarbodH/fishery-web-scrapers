I have never fished that late in the year in canada and was wondering if the fishing is good that time of year and how are the bug at that time? Thanks for any help. Tim"
540463,Andyeye,2004-06-09 06:46:00,179,I have fished during August several times in Canada. I like that time of year for a couple of reasons. First the fish are usually around the reefs and if you have stable weather they are cooperative. The bugs can still be there but I think they are less numerous than the times I have fished in June. I have had some days that the temperature was hot and it made it a little uncomfortable on the water but that can happen anytime. Nightcrawlers in August has always been good for our group. Good Luck!
