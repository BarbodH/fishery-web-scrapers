1491473,scar,2012-09-30 08:13:00,196,Wow! Did not know that! Thanks Ben. Hope to run into you sometime. We have a cabin on Neepawa Island and are starting to get familiar with the area. Love your web pages!
1493706,milfish,2012-10-08 10:21:00,249,"Well, well. Just got back from a week at Lac Seul Outposts. Fishing was unbelievable! Best year yet. 3 guys, 1541 ""eyes"". Totally unbelievable. Most fish were 22' to 30' deep. Surface temp was pretty steady around 53 degrees. 3/8 oz silver and gold ""Strobe"" jigs, Chartreuse and glow pink were all we used. Extra large minnows are prefered but as long as there was meat on the jig they would hit. 25% of our fish were in the slot. 20% over the slot. You do the math. Largest was 27"". More pike than in past years with the biggest at 37"". Fished mostly North of Chamberlain, only one morning south by three sisters. So-So South at my favorite spots.All the other fisherman I spoke to also had very good fishing. Fishing pressure, if you can call it pressure, has been considerably lower the past couple of years due to the economy and the fishing gets better and better. Ken and Brenda are terrific hosts and share info when asked. Weather was beautiful Saturday thru Wednesday sunny and no wind to speak of. Thursday was windy, cold and rainy, and Friday was windy with heavy wet snow.Can't wait till next year!!!!!!!!"

1487761,milfish,2012-09-18 11:51:00,249,hasn't anyone fished the NE end recently?
1488026,Mudpuippy,2012-09-19 06:28:00,23,"I was up there the last week of Aug., Saw lots of big fish right around the Narrows. Chris of course is the man when it comes to Muskies up there, he will put you on fish.I tried to go back and would like to, but my musky partner can't make it. There is still one monster I would like to tangle with just south of camp.Sept. is a great time to fish the big girls. Have a great trip. Wish I was there."
1488897,milfish,2012-09-21 15:34:00,249,"Thanks Mudpuppy!Heard of a big Musky about three years or so ago caught and released off Merit Point. 62 inches long with a 29 in girth. Wow! Supposedly the ministry netted, measured and released the same fish two weeks prior so maybe not just a fish story. Chris at camp is always helpful and so is Danny. 8 days and counting! FISH ON!Milfish"
1489366,Skiball,2012-09-23 16:39:00,82,Good luck up there.........just got back but I was south. Walleye fishing was outstanding. Water temps last saturday were at 65 surface 62-63 down deeper. I would like to know how you did with the big grils. We always talked about fishing up in the narrows. We've been going to Lac Seul for 20 yrs.Have a nice safe trip. Roads are great as well.Skiball
1489505,milfish,2012-09-24 08:55:00,249,You got it Ski Ball. I will post my report upon my return. Hoping for water temps in the mid to low 50's. Usually get more and bigger fish when it gets below 55. Been going to Chamberlain for 20 + too.Milfish
1489907,Hunts1,2012-09-25 09:02:00,123,"Returned Saturday after 4 days of fishing, predominately Muskie. We arrived after a cold front moved through and had pretty lousy weather overall. Water temps 56-58. Couple days of rain and wind 5-15 with no consistent direction. We raised a 50+ incher off pecker point but otherwise did not see another fish. Costed shoreline and humps as well as trolled. Walleye fishing was good but we really only spent a short amount of time fishing them. Largest 26"". Caught 40"" NP and a couple 36-38""'ers. Walleye on jigs and minnows. Chris provided good information but the fish were not cooperating. Past couple weeks he reports that several big fish seen or caught. Good luck to those still going up."
1490070,milfish,2012-09-25 15:13:00,249,"Thanks! I always spend some time at Pecker Point, Birch Narrows and Wapisi Bay on the far end. Good to hear the temps are in the mid 50's. Hoping for low50's. Will post upon my return.Milfish"
1491201,scar,2012-09-28 17:43:00,196,"Hey milfish, small world! I believe I talked to you on phone the night before you left, Hard to believe 2 guys from our little town visit this site and read a post about this area............ hope you have a great trip. I fish as far north as bear narrows, ski doo point etc. but someday hope to go the extra hour to chaimberlin area. Hope i'm looking at a house when you get back!"
