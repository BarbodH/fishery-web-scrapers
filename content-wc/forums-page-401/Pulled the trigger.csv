1492224,Blackmacs,2012-10-02 14:03:00,2121,Oveson's is decent. They have a restaurant and bar right there so you don't need to drive. I've stayed at the North Country Inn on the south side of town on a snowmobile trip. It decent also. As Lunker said the Dam Supper club is just on the south side of town. If you want some real night life stop in the Orr Muni.
1492225,camp chef,2012-10-02 14:06:00,915,orr muni ?
1492231,camp chef,2012-10-02 14:18:00,915,"I agree......I used to stay at a duck camp in Trempleau, Wis. on the Mississippi and at night the Tugs would wind up their big diesels as the moved the barges into and out of the locks. A wonderful, powerful ambient noise. That I miss"
1492232,tv4fish,2012-10-02 14:19:00,2694,I believe the poster is refering to the City of Orr Municipal Liquor Store.....
1492234,camp chef,2012-10-02 14:27:00,915,"Hey I'll hang out anywhere if the night life warrants it.......No wait, that was 30 years ago.......I forget sometimes....."
1492246,tlars,2012-10-02 15:05:00,137,"North Country Inn, Orr. Clean, with great Wifi if you're interested. Close to the Dam Bar."
1492346,tackleman,2012-10-02 20:16:00,444,"go to fortune bay casino on lake vermillion, great spot, lots of parking. good food reasonable room rates and a fun casino to boot.they got a great golf course too, according to guys i know who have played it."
1492449,camp chef,2012-10-03 08:32:00,915,Thanks for all the input
1492120,camp chef,2012-10-02 09:02:00,915,"Well, We pulled the trigger and are booked into Stokes Bay Resort for the spring. More exploring. Now I am looking for a recommendation for a place to spend the night between Virginia,Mn and Cook,Mn. Maybe a resort or off the path motel/ bar. All we need is a place to Drink alittle, eat a nice meal and get a night's sleep and shower. It woul be great if we could park the boat and not have to drive until the next day. Thanks for any help"
1492128,Guest,2012-10-02 09:17:00,0,American Inn in Virginia MN would be a good choice since you are right next door to the sawmill saloon. You could park at the motel and walk to the bar.
1492136,camp chef,2012-10-02 09:41:00,915,"Thanks, that was my initial thought ,but my partner would like to get a few more miles up the road and out of the ( commercial/populated area) if possible. It is always fun to find a small local place where you can make friends and be relatively sure that they will be there ""next time"""
1492140,Guest,2012-10-02 09:55:00,0,"You could try Orr, MN. Not sure the name of the place but it is on the north end of town and has a lighted parking lot."
1492142,@Lunker,2012-10-02 09:58:00,835,"Norman's Motel in Orr is serviceable and economical and The Dam just back down the road a bit has decent food and a nice bar. They have a ~small~ soup and salad bar that comes with dinners. They consider their great $10 steak sandwich a ""dinner"" so you get the salad bar with it. If you've traveled that route, you know both have been there for years, although Norman's used to be known as Anderson's Motel."
1492143,LOW1,2012-10-02 10:03:00,2828,We have stayed at the Orr place which I think Bingo is referring tohttp://hstrial-ovesonpelicanlak.homestead.com/It was very nice when we were there.Not much mileage difference between Virginia and Cook (20-25 miles?)so you would not be losing too much time/distance if you stayed in Virginia. Orr is probably 30-45 minutes north of Cook.
1492164,IaDave,2012-10-02 11:16:00,476,I would be concerned with the trains going thru all night. They are pretty close and they haul a** when going thru.
1492173,camp chef,2012-10-02 11:58:00,915,Thanks... I do know where they are. That is more what we are looking for. Not everybody has a web site yet.
1492178,camp chef,2012-10-02 12:03:00,915,"Thanks, yes more than the miles we just want to get out into ""the country"""
1492186,Pikeslayer8,2012-10-02 12:46:00,1460,We have been staying in the Super 8 in Eveleth and find it really nice. It's at least 30$ cheaper than the others. Great parking for your boat. http://travel.hotels-and-discounts.c...on=2&cid=59562
