1490346,northerneyes,2012-09-26 10:54:00,72,Our group use to go on a yearly moose hunt in Ontario and combine that with fishing. Haven't done that for awhile. Any one got any good lakes/outfitters to recommend for this combo. In the past we gave the fishing quality about as much importance as the moose hunting quality when picking a lke to visit. Also does any one know of a good message board for Ontario hunting.

The fishing is awesome and as for a guide...JIm Booi himself is considered a bit of a local legend. If he cant get you a moose might as well start mastadon huntin
