1492501,TIGHTLINER,2012-10-03 10:49:00,223,Was at Eddies Aug of 2011. I used chrome/black Hot N Tots most of the time trolled about 15 yds behind the boat caught lots of Walleyes and large trophy size Pike on them. I would say if you take your standard NP lures of Daredevils and Johnson silver minnow along with some large floaters of Rapala's you should be covered pretty good. You probably won't hear much from Eddie until he gets back to his home in PI the moose hunt is going on right now and right after that he will be ready to close up camp.
1492523,pikeandtina,2012-10-03 12:04:00,145,"TL,Thanks for the input. Yeah, didn't want to bother Eddie right now due to the reasons you mentioned...am supposed to call him in November. Just wanted to see what others had been successful with...ready to start ordering/shopping to help pass the time til June, LOL!"
1492559,Mike Borger,2012-10-03 14:14:00,1554,"There are a couple of different methods I use at Eddies for large pike.Fishing the back bays a 3/4oz or 11/8oz Johnson Silver Minnow in both gold and black work great. Always tip with an oversized grub or even better a long pork trailer. A silicone skirt pushed on the hook then trimmed adds to the effectiveness as well, adding bulk and color.Larger non weedless Doctor spoons are also lethal. Fluorescent orange/copper and chatreuse/silver both work very well. You'll find many open pockets even in the back bays where non weedless spoons shine.I'm also very partial to inline bucktails in the 1oz range in a variety of colors and oversized bass spinnerbaits in the 3/4oz range.They're excellent search tools when you're drifting across the expansive deep weed flats you'll find up there.I always have a heavy spinning rod rigged with a more subtle follow up bait as well. A large 8"" Reaper in either white or black is lethal rigged on an appropriate sized head. As are oversized tubes in the same size range.Many times a big pike will come in hot and not commit to your spoon. A quick flip with the plastic usually sees a hook up.I also troll for pike in the deeper river channels adjacent to the shallow bays, and in the well defined channel that runs through Beteau itself.Any deeper diving plug in the 5-6"" range will work. Musky sized baits are not required up there."

1492731,Pymbet,2012-10-04 06:47:00,42,"We fished Beteau back in 1996 when the camp was run by Carl Salling out of Mesick, Michigan. His guide, Pat, favored black and gold Bomber Long A's. He was a gruff, but fun guy, who always said ""One cast length behind the boat"" and if you snuck out a little more line, he'd let you know it. We caught most walleye and the largest pike on that lure. FYI, for any who fished Beteau back in those days through Carl, he passed away this summer."
1492860,pikeandtina,2012-10-04 12:48:00,145,Thanks Pymbet!
1491491,pikeandtina,2012-09-30 09:35:00,145,"Our group will be making our first trip to Eddie North's Beteau camp the last week of June 2013. Since so many members here have fished this lake/river system I thought maybe you could give us a heads-up on specific lures/colors that worked for you for pike and walleye. We have one guy who is a fly fisherman, so if anyone has any recommendations he would appreciate that as well ( he has never fished for pike or walleye before, only trout ) Thanks in advance, John"
1491499,tooski,2012-09-30 10:40:00,393,"Pike, You could total the knowledge of the members here re: Beteau and it still wouldn't match Eddie's. I'm positive he would be very helpful with the answers to your question...."
1491507,pikeandtina,2012-09-30 11:38:00,145,"Tooski,I am sure you are correct, just haven't had the chance to speak with him yet. Plan to speak with him later after his season is over though. In the meantime I'm itching to go to Cabela's! : )Thanks,John"
1491536,wallydave,2012-09-30 16:06:00,2151,Email Eddie he responds pretty quickly. Check the pics. on the website too!
1491601,lassh,2012-09-30 19:59:00,553,"We were there at end of July, first part of August. Most of the pike we caught were in the weeds. Weedless spoons in silver, gold and orange were all hot at one time or another. Cranks were good in current breaks- shad rap type cranks- color didn't seem to matter if they were in the current breaks for both pike and walleyes. Fish in the current were hitting spoons like dardeveles silver or fiveodiamonds. We caught most walleyes on jigs with white or black twister tails. When we were there the pike were way up in the weeds so it would be hard to fly fish for them. But maybe in June if there are emerging weed near breaks that are a couple feet below the surface, some big streamers or dahlberg diver types would be dynamite. I'd try red and white, black or white. You'll like like Beteau, there are plenty of big pike and some big walleyes as well."
1491650,GOBIG,2012-10-01 03:38:00,126,"We use Hot-n-Tots. All colors, but chrome and black seems to work the best. Grab a few of the larger ones also. There are a few good spots at Eddies to troll the bigger Hot-n-Tots, where the water goes from 4-5 to 10-15ft. The Smithwicks work well also.(RED and Black). You will get a lot of info. The Hot's work well because you get both Walley and Pike. I caught two over 40 on a 3 in lure. Lost several more."
1491953,pikeandtina,2012-10-01 18:30:00,145,"Thanks guys, appreciate all of you who have chimed in on this! John"
1491988,pike50plus,2012-10-01 19:56:00,584,"more older posts here and reports including lures Silver minnon spoons 3/4, 1 1/8 silver was best. jigs and tails tipped with a piece of worm, trolling rapalas and small hot-tots"
1492379,pikeandtina,2012-10-03 03:05:00,145,Thanks Pike.
1492478,tight line,2012-10-03 09:39:00,37,3/4 oz northernland spinnerbaits chartuse was a good color. Baits with silver or copper blades seemed to work better than colored blades.
