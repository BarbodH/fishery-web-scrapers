The good news is the amount of bait in the river is incredible. Fishing in both the bay and the river has been very good to above average for this time of year. The wind has been blowing from the north, north west, and south for almost a week now with some breaks... the water temp is 58. Having said that, the fish are in and most reports from fishermen are really good. Just a note Craig Stapon has taken over the second tournament from me and you can reach him at Winnipeg Sport and Leisure to register. This has taken alot off my plate and I'm looking forward to fishing both tournaments in Pine Falls this year.."

1491390,Guest,2012-09-29 17:23:00,0,Reports coming in on the local site that fishing sucked today Guys were having a tough time everywhere Is the run over all ready...LOL PS Guys were starting to catch on the red at the cut Its a weird system
1491912,Guest,2012-10-01 16:04:00,0,"Bite slowed down over the weekend and was still slow today. Fish are being caught but nothing like last week, hoping that the wind continues to blow from the north and nights get cool. Water temp last week was 56 today it was pushing 58 mid afternoon. Didn't fish the river today just the bay."
1491974,LeeMB,2012-10-01 19:22:00,83,"The fishing has been spotty on both the Red and Pine Falls. If your coming up from the US I would be prepared to fish either system, depending on the weather and the bite."
