1491995,zeebee,2012-10-01 20:02:00,1144,"Perhaps it sounds like a subtle difference but are you looking for a lake with a chance for a trophy or a lake known as a pike trophy lake. If it's the latter then I would suggest another day on the road to reach northern Manitoba where the opportunity for several trophies (+42"") is the norm rather than the chance. If you are looking for a chance for a trophy then the previous recommendations are fine.http://www.dunlopfishing.com/index.php?page=fishing"
