1490216,fishingfever,2012-09-26 05:36:00,85,Received a 50% refund of HST about 6 weeks after I filed for it. We had a housekeeping cabin and the service that qualified the refund was guiding. My local bank deducted 0 fees. The CDN$ is worth more than the US$ after all.
1490543,Skiball,2012-09-26 18:30:00,82,Thanks
1491456,Guest,2012-09-30 06:01:00,0,Hey tv4fish Minneapolis Hilton 13% tax (hospitality)
1491790,tv4fish,2012-10-01 11:46:00,2694,"WELLLLLLLLL - YOU guys have to pay for ALL of your ""amenities"" somehow."
1492737,Guest,2012-10-04 07:06:00,0,"Fish Sorry, I was mistaken. I went to my receipt and it wasn't hospitality. It was 6% state tax and almost 7% city tax. It is now 7% state and 7.28% city. Still had a great time in a terrific city. I just saying we shouldn't cast stones. Have a nice day."

1485682,phishfearme,2012-09-12 08:23:00,1242,or - do like we did last year and ask your outfitter if he'd take the endorsed check as part of the deposit. this avoids getting any cash (Canadian or US) which is what causes all the fees and charges. phish
1485688,JayM5209,2012-09-12 08:42:00,1050,"Last week I deposited into my account our HST rebate check of $225.88. This morning the bank notified me of the total charges for exchange rate and foreign transaction fees. The total was $1.49, less than 2/3 of 1%.For me, it sure isn't worth holding the check for a year, stopping at a Canadian bank on the way to next year's fishing, or driving across town to fuss about it. In fact, the charges are probably less than a telephone call to our outfitter to ask him to do something with it.One more thing I don't have to fret about as I anticipate next year's trip!"
1485710,Guest,2012-09-12 09:48:00,0,i see you say you got 225.88 back i'm wondering on how many ways is that money is split among your group Do you guys get to claim back every bit of the hst you were charged as a canuck do we get the same deal if i come and spend money in the US?
1485727,tv4fish,2012-09-12 10:54:00,2694,Hi Bill:
1485746,JayM5209,2012-09-12 12:29:00,1050,Not that I know of.
1485805,phishfearme,2012-09-12 15:20:00,1242,"seems like your bank would soon go bankrupt with these negligible fees?? did you pay in US$, then get the check in Canadian $, then cash the check to get back to US$? there has to be an exchange cost somewhere along the line - nobody works for free. did the exchange rates vary over the time frame such that you only lost $1.49? this just doesn't sound right. banks here in PA not only charge an exchange rate fee (the ""spread"") but also a service fee - these are MUCH more than $1.49. phish"
1489387,Skiball,2012-09-23 18:21:00,82,"Are there any ways to get rebates on HST/GST if you do American Plan?I was under the impression that you need at least two services provided such as guide, transportation, etc. Meals are not included. Anybody up on this subject?Thanks"
1489409,v-bay gord,2012-09-23 19:01:00,3168,"You need a package that includes accomodation and one eligable service. Fish cleaning is an eligable service, so I would think an american package would qualify."
1489474,tv4fish,2012-09-24 07:31:00,2694,"It really ""boils down"" to how the resort/lodge owner prepares your bill - We do the American plan and I have been able to get a 50% refund every year."

1479073,Larry Mac,2012-08-24 19:01:00,530,"Hello WC Friends, we submitted our request for rebate Thursday 6/28, received our notification letter Wednesday 8/22 and received our check today Friday 8/24. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
1479172,hoppy63,2012-08-25 06:46:00,367,"Thanks larry. Sent mine in a few weeks ago. I called the number gordy posted and the lady was very nice, and told me she had my paperwork, and it would probably be a couple more weeks for return. Did you get all back you expected?"
1479318,Larry Mac,2012-08-25 14:03:00,530,"Hi Hoppy63, yes we recieved our request in full. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
1482782,JayM5209,2012-09-04 11:32:00,1050,"Group of five did a late June fly-in. On July 20th I downloaded the HST rebate form, filled it out, and mailed with appropriate receipt and cover letter. Today I received a check for 50% of the HST paid.Less than six weeks from filing to receipt of check. Took an investment of about 15 minutes, max. Quick, easy, simple, just like previous years."
1484711,NP4ME,2012-09-09 15:50:00,378,"Gord, Thanks for posting the link; however, it will not work for me. Has anyone else had problems with the link or does anyone have another link they can post? Thanks!"
1484716,JayM5209,2012-09-09 16:01:00,1050,"Start here. http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tp.../menu-eng.htmlYou want the form ""Rebate Application for Tour Package"". It's a PDF file that you'll have to print then complete with pen/ink. It appears as though the form you can fill out on your computer has been removed for updating. That may be why Gord's link isn't working."
1484737,55walleyes,2012-09-09 17:08:00,131,Any suggestions on cashing the rebate check? LAst year lost about 1/3 of check on processing fees and exchange rate using local bank.
1484753,TIGHTLINER,2012-09-09 18:21:00,223,If you plan on going back to canada next year hold on to it and cash it at a bank up there. You will need two kinds of proof but it is written on the goverment and is good until you cash it. You will not loose anything this way. If it is made out for 400 bucks that is what you will get from the bank. I did it this year and it worked out great. If you are not going back you will loose a lot i know from last dealings.
1477314,hoppy63,2012-08-21 06:27:00,367,Sent in paperwork few weeks ago along with original receipts. Was wondering if there is a site or phone number to check the status of refunds......if any. Ive heard mixed stories on getting tax returns back. Thanks for any info.
1477377,v-bay gord,2012-08-21 08:43:00,3168,"It takes awhile. You'll either get a cheque in the mail, or a letter explaining why your form was rejected."
1477405,tv4fish,2012-08-21 09:44:00,2694,"Gord: Maybe you should talk to your government and give them some ""money-saving"" ideas This is what they do - First you will get a check in the mail (IF they approve your request) ---- then a few days after that - they send you a separate mailing that has your original receipt --- I'm just wondering why they don't/can't combine all of it in ONE envelope???"
1477433,v-bay gord,2012-08-21 10:41:00,3168,"I didn't realize that is what they did........does seem like a waste. In my next batch of forms I send in I will include a note with your remarks. If I get an answer I will post it. Maybe you'll get a prize for saving the government some money....ha! Update: There is a phone number on the form so I gave them a call and asked your question. According to Russell (a friendly chap) the cheques are issued from a different branch located in Halifax. The receipt is returned to you from the application office located in Summerside, Prince Edward Island. So until the time comes when they amalgamate the two offices that is the reason for the double mailing."
1477439,hoppy63,2012-08-21 11:01:00,367,Hey gord.......any chance of tracking return through that number? I believe you have 1 year to claim it. I waited almost 11 months! Maybe they will figure we didnt want it! Ha
1477471,v-bay gord,2012-08-21 12:10:00,3168,Here's the number for outside of Canada.... 1-800-565-9353
1477493,hoppy63,2012-08-21 12:57:00,367,Thank you
1477510,port1042,2012-08-21 13:26:00,509,"There is a reason for the two envelopes. I was in the mailing business for an insurance company and recently retired. We had to send multiple envelopes alot -- and not only made us look stupid but it also cost a lot of money.However, when you have an automated process (like the HST Checks) and a manual process (like the original receipt) there is no easy way to get them into a single envelope until a fully designed system is ready to do it. That programming and system developement take a lot of I/S time and resources. The bottom line is that it's more efficient (and probably less costly) to send two envelopes. But, it sure makes you look dumb.Tight lines!Port"
1477535,tv4fish,2012-08-21 14:45:00,2694,"Port -- not meaning to ""beat a dead horse"" - But, If I ran the gov't I would give the same office that handles (manually) the incoming refund requests the capability to issue the checks and THEN they could send everything back together at the same time. Yeah, I know - that's ""trusting"" too many people and also too efficient -- I understand."
1477585,deputy dog,2012-08-21 16:10:00,305,tried search on here and this link: http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/ but i am still having issues finding the exact form to download and submit for my refund. any help?!?!?!
