It was raining, which then turned to snow, which did not stick. Expectations of more snow did not develop during the week which we spent at Young's Wilderness Camp in Stevens Bay near Nestor Falls. Although several mornings were frosty, with the lowest temperature being 26 degrees, the days became warm, 60's to maybe 75 degrees. The water temperature actually warmed up during the week - 54 degrees at the beginning of the week, 56 at the end. I had expected the crappies to have begun congregating in the deeper holes around Hay Island, but very few pods were seen on the depth finder. Fishing vertically in this area with jigs and or plastic, we managed to pick up only a few each day, the biggest being 13"". We were able, however, to catch each day a goodly number of walleyes and some nice sized perch, and a smattering of smallmouth. Largest walleye was 22"", perch about 11"". Wind was not a limiting factor on location to fish, usually had just enough to provide some drift movement, I-Pilot performed admirably, with anchor lock being employed with almost every fish caught, if it was not already on. The fish were tight to the bottom, and I soon learned that the slightest irregularity shown on the screen would yield a fish or more, usually more. It seemed that almost every spot we tried almost swarmed with fish, although not always large ones. The place is a fertile fish factory, with more fish, it seems, than in past years While sitting near the south end of Hay Island one day, We saw a boat modify it's lower unit on a reef, coming to a quick stop, after shooting several propeller turns of water high into the air. Surprisingly, the motor was able to still function, a not usual end result. Several days later, same place, a native netter hit the same rock. He was towed back about 2 miles to his landing by the fellows from our neighboring cabin. His in-place gill nets did provide some degree of frustration for those of us fishing. Only one end of the nets were marked with a very small float, and there was no way to tell which way they were laid out. People were continuingly getting snagged on them or getting their anchor fouled. Normally I would have taken a one day crappie trip to Obabikon Lake, but an email report from a friend who was there indicated that the large ones had not shown up there either. To me this seemed to be an unusual year, as in the past I have had very good crappie fishing in mid- September. He said they did start the last day or so in the week. Most of the folks were using minnows and either a double crappie rig or a jig and minnow. I stopped using minnows some years ago, and we did very well with artificials accompanied by a shot of Berkely scent. The water was clearer than it usually is, perhaps as a result of less rain. Most of the summer algea was gone. I was a bit disappointed in the leaf coloring this year, it seemed that many of the birches, which are prone to locate near the water, had already lost their leaves. The aspen, however, were quite beautiful, there being more to God's Country than just the fishing. Our fish were checked at the border in Baudette, a seemingly almost-to-be-expected event. The border folks were pleasant, and we were on our way in no time. Gas at Baudette was $3.99/gal. All in all, it was a good trip, and I am booked for next year. Bill Krejca"

1492209,Bill Krejca,2012-10-02 13:41:00,6107,"J- Yeah, re: Class count low. I believe crappies cycle with a peak quantity around every 7 years. I figured this year was the low end of the cycle, can't go anywhere but up in the next few years. Re: Perch - It wasn't that many years ago up there that the perch were small and wormy, nobody kept them. They have really increased in size, and we haven't found any that were wormy. So it goes! Bill"
1492420,steve.a,2012-10-03 07:31:00,274,"I was at Nestor Falls Sept. 14th - 21st and it was the same, few crappies but nice walleyes and big perch. I caught one perch by Hay that was 13"" and no worms. Biggest walleye was 25"" (released)."
