I got off to a late start and missed the Labor Day long weekend due to other commitments but did manage to get out a few times after that. There were many very windy days and I avoided those. Fighting the wind makes my trolling motor battery run out of juice very quickly. I took videos of a lot of the fish I was catching and below is a compilation including walleye, bass, northern pike and muskie with a couple of rock bass and perch thrown in as well. Trying to turn on cameras while fighting a fish often results in losing the fish and for some reason those lost fish always feel like they are a lot bigger than the ones that stay on the line and make it into the videohttp://youtu.be/iiDgrEkvO5Q"
