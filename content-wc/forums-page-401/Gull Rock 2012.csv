1488512,Guest,2012-09-20 16:02:00,0,Which resort is open that late on Gullrock?? Might just make another trip to Gullrock.
1488522,jkwildhunting,2012-09-20 16:33:00,361,I know 5 Lakes is going to try to have a cabin open year round. We head up tomorrow and I know we are the only guys in camp next week but if you gave them a call or email and asked them they may work ya in...Ian is trying to get me talked into doing some ice fishing up there with him this winter which I really really want to but not sure I need to round up a sled or 2!!!!
1488602,Guest,2012-09-20 20:15:00,0,Wright's Camp is still open and has open cabins next week. They were packed this week and the fishing was fantastic. Cooler weather has brought the water temps down and the big fish are putting on their feed bags. Good Luck on wherever you decide.
1489214,fish bookie,2012-09-22 19:35:00,53,We just got back and the fishing was great had a day that we couldn't get them to bite but like normal we ate a pile of fish and brought our limit back to Iowa we did catch more 20+ inch walleyes this year then we have in the past few yrs. and some dandy 40+ inch northerns I personally caught a 41 inch 24.4 lber it was a blast and my brother in laws caught several 36+ and the biggest was 42.75 inchs 26 lbs just fat as **** awesome fish this week biggest walleye was 25 inch caught by father in law I aslo caught 2- 23 inchers and several 20 -21 inch fish. if you thinking about going up take plenty of layers and good rain gear
1491381,jkwildhunting,2012-09-29 16:53:00,361,"Another awesome year in the books!We arrived to camp week ago today, We were the only/last ""group"" in camp for the year. Course he had to show me pictures of the 26-29.5"" fish caught last week. I was ready to hit the water before we pulled into camp but now I was a kid on the xmas eve ready to roll.Got out around 3ish Saturday afternoon. Hit some new spots havent fish much n had 2 freezer fish in the box and 2 for eating plus thru back a 23"" fish. I was thinking wow this will be a fantasic week.Karma turned around to get me fishing was great thru Monday and by tuesday the switch was turned off n it was rough going. Search deep to shallow had them loaded on the screen is the 25-35fow but everything we thru at em they refused. Ended the week with multiple 18-22"" fish, 3-23"" n one at 24"" The smaller fish were AWESOME. A BUNCH in the 16-18"" and smaller ones so the next few years should be in for GOOD fishing!Nice to talk to see ya on the lake again tackleman! Hopefully we will run into each other in June!"
1493033,dynamite,2012-10-05 07:54:00,20,"Just got back last night from Golden Hook. Got chased out by falling temperatures and snow storm. Got in last friday and had a good week. Caught numerous walleyes over the slot. Biggest one was a couple of 24 inchers. Brought our limit home of eaters. Caught a 48, 37,36, and 33 inch northern jigging for the walleyes. Now I need to get a replica of the 48 incher. We also caught a fenwick rod with a pfluger reel attached and returned to the owner. The fishing gods were watching over him. Bill has an offer for the resort and said he will stil be around. Will be back next year."
1484781,Chars guide,2012-09-09 19:32:00,39,"TACKLEMAN When your talking about the water level, is that on Gull Rock or Red? I was of the opinion that you had such a large amount of rain this summer that Gull Rock was near normal. Joe"
1484816,tackleman,2012-09-09 20:53:00,444,the mnr has been letting water out of the entire system for quite a while now and it is reached the point where both lakes are below the level they like to have going into the winter months. they have been getting lots of calls about the levels and finally decided they better correct the situation.
1485568,fish bookie,2012-09-11 19:23:00,53,Am I wasting my time bringing plastics up to Gull Rock? Should I just stick with jigs and minnows and do you think smaller or bigger is better we normally use 3/8 oz but I'm thinking abut getting some 1/4 oz as well good idea or not to me it seams that the drifts are normally pretty quick this time of year. Can't wait 3 more days and our group will be fishing
1485621,tackleman,2012-09-11 21:55:00,444,"i havent' used plastics on gull rock but i still carry gulp as a last resort if i run out of minnows. i'm sure some will tell you they work but to me live bait is the way to go, be that minnows, leeches or worms."
1485654,Pezman38,2012-09-12 06:50:00,3196,"We do the same as tackleman and use artificial bait when we have to. We also will try it out if the walleyes are hitting pretty hard. 90% of the time I use a 3/8, the other 10% is 1/2 because of waves and wind."
1485988,jkwildhunting,2012-09-13 07:00:00,361,"Like the others stated plastics can be good, or it can be bad. IMO, if you do not have confident in using plastics leave it at home. I use it alot and really like it but I aslo have confident in using it. Will it replace live bait no. There are days we have fished up there were all we use is gulp and just kill the fish. Last few years bait seems to be the ticket.I use 1/4-3/4oz jigs depending on day and wind. Dead calm you are fine with a 1/4 slight breeze I put on 3/8 which seems to be I use this size the most, if the winds are strong put out 1/2oz or heavier.Good luckWeek from Tomorrow we head!"
1486249,fish bookie,2012-09-13 18:51:00,53,were do you stay JK
1486258,jkwildhunting,2012-09-13 19:06:00,361,"We stay at 5 Lakes, I think I talked to you few years ago on the lake maybe not. Do you stay at Wrights and get a upgrade boat with like 75hp on it?Sounds like this is the last week/weekend everyone is going this coming sat thru next saturday. No one is booked last week at our camp. Which will be nice having a uncrowded lake like the summer months are.PS, if you are around tackleman stop over, We have Red Lund full windshield now.Good Luck!"
1488169,dynamite,2012-09-19 18:43:00,20,"We are headed up to fish starting the 29th-6 Oct. We now the weather is unpredictable, but the fishing can be the best of the yeaar. We also should have most of the lake to ourselves. It is like the lake is reserved just for us!"
1488222,Guest,2012-09-19 20:47:00,0,Golden Hook Camp on Gullrock Lake updates their web site often. http://www.goldenhookcamp.com/reports-fishing.html
1481732,fish bookie,2012-08-31 19:12:00,53,"Hey fellas it fish bookie just wondering if theres any new news on gull rock we head up on Sept. 14 -21st to Prockys on Two Island. Thats a nice wally pic there man I'd love to catch a few like that if at all possible.Hey tackleman thanks for the reports they are nice to read what color have you been catching them on and does anyone have any suggestions on some new spots we seem to always go to the same ones like round, the boot, dog pecker point (i think most people call it Iowa point) I have heard there are some good sunken islands and a few big rock piles out there any help on where to look for them? I'd also like some suggestions on how to cut back on stuff. does anyone use much other then jig and minnow. I always have plastics on me but don't have very good luck with them. I could some help to take less crap but better crap if you know what I mean thanks Fish Bookie"
1483281,pattmit,2012-09-05 11:06:00,36,Any recent updates of lake? Water temp? Weather? Walleye bite? Headed there in a week can't wait
1483285,Pezman38,2012-09-05 11:10:00,3196,Wrights Camp has a blog on Gull Rock.http://wrightscamp.blogspot.com/
1483311,pattmit,2012-09-05 11:46:00,36,I check the blog daily. Didn't know if anything has changed or weather changes/pattern. I saw results of red lake tourny but I don't think many people fish gull rock as its mostly red lake and keg lake.
1483401,Pezman38,2012-09-05 14:47:00,3196,I didn't see anything about the Red Lake Classic on his blog. August 31 was the last post I saw and the classic was on September 1-2.
1483463,pattmit,2012-09-05 17:30:00,36,Results posted on a different thread on WC
1483862,jkwildhunting,2012-09-06 17:56:00,361,"Looks like wrights just updated there page, Alot of bigger fish being caught this week, deep water, jigs, lindy riggin, or small spinners.Hey Patt, do you perhaps go with a guy from Waukee Area? We are headed up the 21 hoping its cold by then and the big ones are chowing!!!!Good Luck!"
1483942,pattmit,2012-09-06 21:18:00,36,Most of us are from NW Iowa but a few of us from des Moines but no Waukegan. Headed in 7 days!!!!!!!!!!
1484196,tackleman,2012-09-07 14:08:00,444,i talked to the mnr today and asked why the water is still being released from the lake when it's so low already. they told me the lake level was being drawn down to get ready for the spring run off but the logs weren't stopping the water since they weren't sitting on each other leaving a gap between the logs for the water flow. they told me that the fellow who has the equipment to jack the logs down is in Dryden and should be at the snowshoe dam on monday to force the logs together and stop or greatly reduced the water outflow.hopefully this will work since the water level is the lowest it has been in years.
1484450,NWwalleye,2012-09-08 10:34:00,223,"tackleman... How low is the water now ? It was dropping fast, when I was up here for the Fall Classic .Thanks fro your help last week on the Tournament results .."
1467938,Fishin Fun,2012-07-30 05:57:00,218,I noticed that weather system on the news last night and wondered how that was going to shake things up. Hope you didn't get any real bad weather. I'm heading up to Gullrock on Saturday so I hope that fish are biting by then. Looks like the weather is wetting and cooler this week. So far next week looks nicer.
1467949,Pezman38,2012-07-30 06:36:00,3196,Headed up on Saturday staying at Wrights. Hoping for another good year and safe travels.
1478081,jkwildhunting,2012-08-22 15:51:00,361,Pezman how did your trip go a few weeks back?We are headin up in bout a month. Cant wait to get back on the lake up there then come home to some good fall fishing around home!
1478312,Pezman38,2012-08-23 07:25:00,3196,"It was good man, lots of fish again. You could catch fish 16-14 all day if you wanted. We tried to find bigger fish most the week and my biggest was a 25"", 24"", 20"" and a 19. So big fish for us was a better year than last. We ran through a bit more gas than last year looking for bigger fish. We caught fish from 13' all the way to 32'. Jig any color, and we pulled several including a 24.5"" on a spinner."
1478328,jkwildhunting,2012-08-23 08:03:00,361,"I hear ya on the gas thing! We were filling up around every other day if not sooner finally we just said enough of the top speed and started running around 30mph amazing how much a tank of gas will last you at that speed.Hoping the weather turns up there soon and starts getting cold for fall, I dont mind going up in late september and having to wear some winter clothes, sick of the summer heat"
1478356,Chars guide,2012-08-23 09:17:00,39,"JKWild We are going to Wright's 15th through the 22nd. Cabin #4, with a blue skeeter, stop in and say hi. Joe"
1478454,pattmit,2012-08-23 13:45:00,36,Any current reports right now? We are also headed up the 15-22nd staying at wrights. Big cabin #12. I read wrights website blog daily hoping for more updates but haven't heard much else. 3 weeks can't come fast enough.
1478511,jkwildhunting,2012-08-23 15:58:00,361,"We go up the week after you guys, Last year or two we went the around 10-12 of september but this year we wanted to try later. Hoping for some nasty cold weather before now n then I would love to be fishing in 30-40 degree air temp cloudy and good walleye chop oh and some big mommas going on the fall prowl....guess I can only wish Good Luck guysJoe"
1478595,tackleman,2012-08-23 19:08:00,444,"not many boats on the lake this week. (at least this is what it seems)went to Iowa point today and got a couple in 22 feet. then went to the gullrock area there were 4 boats there fishing in 20 to 25 feet, and they said they were getting some, I went down a little further from them and tried different depths, had the best luck in the 17 to 19 feet area. only spent about 3/4 hour and got 7 or 8 , kept my 4 for dinner tonight, they were delicious.water temp is still mid 60 degree range and it appears the fish are scattered. you will get a few then they quit and it's time to go somewhere else and get another few then move again.everyone i've talked to said they haven't found any big fish but are getting the odd one in the 21,22 inch range"
1478743,Pezman38,2012-08-24 06:55:00,3196,Nice colored 25 here in the picture. Caught on a glitter blue jig of course.
1432576,Pezman38,2012-05-08 13:06:00,3196,"Good luck Farmer, tell Lee hello for me, and welcome to Walleye Central!"
1433309,Guest,2012-05-09 19:23:00,0,At Wright's camp right now and the northern fishing has been very very very GOOD!
1433315,Fishin Fun,2012-05-09 19:47:00,218,I'm so jealous right now!
1434553,Jigmatt,2012-05-12 19:12:00,9,"Be at Wright's camp June 2nd, and again last week of Sept. 'eye fishing should be great this year...just hope it doesn't get too warm, to drive the big pike out of the bays. Good luck to all....Jigmatt"
1438620,tight_line,2012-05-21 20:15:00,6,"Heading to Poplar June 2nd. Haven't been to gullrock for about 10 years... Back when Wright's was still Weaver's. Can't wait, eh!"
1466250,jkwildhunting,2012-07-25 17:33:00,361,Just curious on the latest n greatest from Gull Rock?Anyone been up there lately. We had back up in September can not wait.Had some buddies from town up there last week sound like they struggled a lil....Good Luck to all going up in next few weeks
1466389,Fishin Fun,2012-07-26 05:44:00,218,I'm curious too how the bite has been. I leave for Gullrock in about a week. Any reports?
1467286,Guest,2012-07-28 07:21:00,0,"We were at Gull Rock from July 14 thru the 20th. Have been going every year for probably 25 years. We were dissapointed this year that week. Seemed like walleyes were small and had days where bite was slow. Still caught alot, ate alot,and brought back our limits of 17-18"" fish. Just seems like something is going on with the lake. Last year was similar in our eyes. Our biggest walleye in group was only 22"" and one person didnt get an over. Seemed like we always got at least a couple of 25-26 inchers"
1467373,jkwildhunting,2012-07-28 11:23:00,361,I want to think the warm/hot weather is causing a rough year. Last year they had the dam shut down and no water is flowing in river chain so that is what we said for an excuse on slower fishing.Targetting deep water drop offs was key for our trip in June. We were pulling fish out of 30-40fow.Good Luck
1467830,tackleman,2012-07-29 19:12:00,444,"my neighbour told me he had some luck on the back side of burnt island so thats where i headed. within the first 15 minutes i had boated 4 walleye and released them , because i still had 2 dozen minnows and lots of time to fish, 20 minutes later, the sky was so dark you almost needed to turn your lights on and almost every boat was tearing to home. it was really dirty looking and i made it almost home before the first shot of lightning came. so there i was at the dock with 2 dozen minnows and a wife who wanted me to do chores. so much for the fishing in the morning.around 2 pm i managed to get out again, the bad weather had passed and it was hot and sunny. so i went to marker island and spent 45 minutes there, got 1 little guy, so off i went to round island but there were 6 boats off the point of the island so i went to a little hump not far from round and picked up 4 for dinner and then i went to Iowa point and got another couple. so i decided i would troll over and mark the reef opposite that point on my gps, as i was going along marking the reef, another boat comes past and said to me "" can you fish somewhere else, i'm using this area"" I couldn't believe it, then the guy laughed. turns out it was a guy i know from red lake and he was just making sure i would notice him in his brand new 21 foot ranger 621 with the 300hp merc and the 2 giagantic humminbird depth finders. After i finished drooling over the boat, we had a nice chat and i left him my left over minnows since i'm going to be away for the next 5 days .tonight they are calling for severe thunderstorms with winds to 90 km/hr , large hail and torrential rain with possible tornadoes. so i don't know what it will do to the fishing for the week."
1431507,jkwildhunting,2012-05-06 15:06:00,361,So who is heading to Gull Rock this season?We are headed up June 22 to Five Lakes. Also will be planning another trip in the fall September probably. Can't wait to get back up there and relax and catch some fish!
1431604,Fishin Fun,2012-05-06 18:59:00,218,"I am heading up to South Bay, but not until August 4th. My 2 boys are so busy with baseball during the months of May-July that August is the only time I can go now. Seem like forever before it will be here. Leave some walleyes for me!"
1431726,GWC,2012-05-07 05:56:00,1021,We'll be headed back in a few weeks. It's a long trip (20+ hours) but a lot of fun. Looking forward to the fishing & seeing our camp owners. We stay at Poplar Point every year. Great place to stay & good equipment.
1431750,Pezman38,2012-05-07 07:07:00,3196,August 4-10 for me!
1431797,Guest,2012-05-07 08:25:00,0,Heading to wright's sept. 12-20. Long wait but worth the great fall trip and fishing. Wright's is an amazing camp and the perfect location on that lake system.
