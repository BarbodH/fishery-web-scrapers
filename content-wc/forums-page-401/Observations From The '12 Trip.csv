Depending on the bay or cut, trees can be anywhere from just turning to ablaze with color. My best fishing partner is my son, Jeff. He's excited no matter what species hits and really cares for the resource. He was at the bow the whole week and getting good at boat control. Sun, rain, wind or sleet, he's ready to fish. I really enjoyed our chats about nothing in particular in the evening sitting around the pellet stove. It finally struck me the only time I get to fish for walleye are on these Canada trips. I need to remember to keep it simple: ¼ oz or 3/8 oz jig with a minnow for vertical presentations and a lindy or spinner rig for drifting presentations around flat areas. We've found a weather radio is indispensable for planning the fishing or adjusting fishing locations for the day and week. Calmer days we made our longer runs to reefs on open areas; windy days we stayed a bit closer and worked around the wind shadows. Fish don't jump into your boat no matter what lake your on. Our best fish story for the week: My son jigging up a 10-12 walleye in 20' of water clamped in the jaws of a 32 northern. The pike was not letting go so I was able to net both fish and get them in the boat. Nimstug"

1492407,bigdaddyguns,2012-10-03 06:46:00,608,"Glad to hear you had a great trip. I have fond memories of such fishing trips with my dad and now I am carrying on the tradition with my boys. By the way, what part of Canada and what were the water temps?"
1492437,@Lunker,2012-10-03 08:08:00,835,"Absolutely agree with you about the time of year. So much quieter then....no houseboats, jet skis, fewer fishing boats....almost as if you have the lake to yourself. Birds are flocking up, getting ready to head south. It's almost as if you can ~feel~ mother nature marshaling her resources in preparation for the winter."
1492439,Nimstug,2012-10-03 08:10:00,2605,Northwest Bay and Alexandria Bay areas of Rainy Lake. We were out 9/15-9/22. Water started about 66 when we arrived and 59-60 the last full day.

Just think how high you would have jumped your last day had the horn in Chicago Stadium sounded like it does for a Blackhawk goal!! Glad you had a good trip. Now..............get on the phone to Bettman and get that thing settled."
1492639,Radnine,2012-10-03 18:55:00,141,Trips like that will pay dividends later that we can't even imagine now.Thanks for posting.Jim
