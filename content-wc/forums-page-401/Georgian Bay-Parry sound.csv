There are more non-natives drinking themselves to death and overfishing thank you very much. I do believe it is racists like you that spoil the lakes with your ignorant poison."

I don't mean to put the binders on your plans but you asked. The area is fished out and not by netters but by anglers for the most part.In order - The French/Pickerel Rivers, Mouth of the French/Pickerel Rivers (in the Bay), Pointe au Baril and Parry Sound; years 6-4 (the rivers), 3, 2 and 1 ago. Caught VERY FEW WALLEYE and not much else. When the Walleye just won't cooperate, we fish for Bass (gag!) and Pike - no difference. Fish were undersized and few and far between and we fished it HARD! As a matter-of-fact, the Bay was SO BAD we ran out to the Main Georgian Bay waters a couple of days, outside of the islands, and still got skunked! And that's a long run from Pointe Au Baril.This area and the French/Pickerel River had almost no regulations until approximately 7 years ago. Canada put a slot system in and it, apparently, has arrested the decline BUT it has a long way to go before the fisherie will be even half as good as it was 25 years ago. This is first hand knowledge because we experienced it. I hope your visit isn't dismal. I would appreciate an update on your return.The area is absolutely GORGIOUS, though!RANGER""KEEP YOUR LINES WET, YOUR POWDER DRY and THE BEER COLD""!"

514579,RANGER,2001-08-22 05:12:00,4341,"[font size=""1"" color=""#FF0000""]LAST EDITED ON Aug-22-01 AT 07:20AM (CST)[/font][p]Rembrandt,If you look at a map of the area (eastern shore of Georgian Bay, ""10,000 islands"") I am refering to the coastal area of: 1) The lower French/Pickerel rivers from Bigwood (at route 69) down to the outlets. 2) French/Pickerel Rivers (Western outlet, Eastern outlet, Main outlet) in the Bay; 2) Bying Inlet south of the French; 3) Pointe au Baril - Main and Station; 4) Parry Sound. These are all in and among the islands and, as I said, in the open waters of Georgian Bay outside of the islands. I have fished this area, off and on, for nearly 30 years. A good friend of mine has fished it for a longer period and he and his crew gave up so totally that they are driving clean over to LOTW and Rainy to do their annual trip instead of Eastern Ontario, and this is from Pennsylvania! It will be a LONG time before I'll try the Georgian Bay area again!I would be thrilled to hear that I am wrong, upon your return. We are HARD fisher people. Once on the lake in the morning we're out until dinner and then go back out after dinner. That's a lot of hours on the water, so it isn't for the lack of trying.RANGER""KEEP YOUR LINES WET, YOUR POWDER DRY and THE BEER COLD""!"
514580,Hunter,2001-08-22 07:25:00,346,"A friend has a trailer in the area you mention. He says the same as Ranger, fishing isnt what it used to be. He is there probably 40 days a year fishing. The fall bear hunt should be fabulous though, has 8 different ones working 3 baits in a 2 mile radius."
514581,szopster,2001-08-22 20:22:00,48,"Been fishing the Pointe Au Baril area for the last 20 years. The walleye fishing has been improving steadily for the last 10 years. The problem with the Pointe area is too much food & forage, increasing weed growth everywhere (leaking septic tanks I suspect).In the last couple of years the wife and I have had a number of 20 walleye days. All on jigs. Quite a few have come on weed edges where there were no weeds just a couple of years ago. The fish are as fat as footballs and full of little rock bass.Everyone there seems to anchor (ugh!) and bottom fish or troll. For whatever reason trolling my favorite #13 Husky Rapalas and #9 Shap Raps doesn't seem to work as good as it used to. I seem to pick up weeds just about everywhere now.The fish at the Pointe have always been finikey with weather, moon phase (tidal effect) all causing fish to move constantly. Now that the zebra mussels have invaded who know what's next.The area is changing, some spots that have we have worked for walleyes for years are full of little rock bass, perch and smallmouths. Other spots are turning up fish when I'm casting the weeds for largemouth.Things are a changing!"
514582,Guest,2001-08-23 15:54:00,0,"Heard a scary story when we were up in the area this past june. On Point Grondine Indian Reserve just to the West of this area, the Indians were netting walleyes in huge amounts. They were throwing every thing else back dead. Pike, Bass Perch, what ever. They were catching the walleyes as they were trying to spawn. The smell of dead fish was overpowering I am told. I do not know how far the walleye travel but this unregulated slaughter of fish is bound to affect the whole area. The government of Canada must not realize how much this will damage their tourist dollars. At one time we took 10 to 20 people with us on an annual fishing trip. We are looking into the fishing in the States as a better place to catch fish. Yes, Canada is beautiful but we are going on a fishing trip, not a sight seeing trip. Hope they realize the damage being done. Our fish catching in the Georgian Bay area is increasingly sad."
514583,Guest,2001-08-23 20:12:00,0,This is a problem all over Canada. Same thing happens near our cottage near North Bay. One time the native was so drunk he fell out of his boat and got tangled in his net and died. The natives are getting away with murder in this country.
