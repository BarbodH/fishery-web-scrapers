For our American friends, please join in.....crack open a ""two-four"", kick back and imagine a perfect world....beer in one hand (illegal) and a walleye on the line in the other (legal if you have a licence and it falls within legal size limits.....and if you are only using one line...and are not camping illegally in the green zone). Sometimes the simple pleasures are the best!"

We were not into much about legal and illegal, but paid a lot of attention to nature's law. She rules. It's a pretty good way to live. Keep dry, warm and fed. I was prepared to stay another week, but weather isn't encouraging for fishing. Thanksgiving is being ruined for a lot of moose. Happy Thanksgiving for all you guys up there."
