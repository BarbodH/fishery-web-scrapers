1493536,Caleb,2012-10-07 17:38:00,36,We have been going to Minaki for the last 30 years. We have stayed at Carol's Cabins since she took the cabins over from her mom. They are very nice people and will help you in any way they can. The fishing is very good and getting better all the time. Alot of big Muskies and Northers are being caught lately. The Walleye fishing is getting better with alot of 27 and 28 inchers being caught. Better check on a bigger motor before you get there.
