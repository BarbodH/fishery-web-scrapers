1492134,Golden Eagle,2012-10-02 09:33:00,2642,"I arrived in Red Lake Thursday night and hitch hiked a ride on a Cessna 185 Friday morning. Bow hunters left 2 days ago and I'm the only guest until rifle hunters arrive Saturday. I have lots of water, all to myself.LV holds lots of huge pike and tons of small to medium walleyes. So far I've concentrated on walleyes, with limited success the first 3 days. I worked hard for my fish and they weren't huge.Yesterday's wind switched from S to NNW, provided a temperature drop and a hefty chop on the surface. Catching was so-so until around 1:00 p.m. when I got into an October hot bite of a decade or 2 or 3. I had 4+ hours of borderline feeding frenzy, walleye fishing. They did everyting for me except to hit at the surface. I was into constant action and most of my fish were much larger than the usual Little Vermilion walleyes.Might try pike fishing today, but would settle for another walleye day like yesterday.A really good fishing trip went great on me."
