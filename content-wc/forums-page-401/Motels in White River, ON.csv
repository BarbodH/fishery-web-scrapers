1490710,adempsey,2012-09-27 08:49:00,963,"I am fairly certain there are only two - Continental Motel and White River Motel. Stayed at both and they were both just fine. The Continental has a restaurant, but the White River is right across the street anyway. There is also Uncle's Cabins if you're heading up to Hornepayne.Continental MotelChristine Bazzoni, ProprietorHwy 17 P.O.
