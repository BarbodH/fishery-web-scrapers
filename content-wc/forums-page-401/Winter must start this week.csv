1493337,jkwildhunting,2012-10-06 16:02:00,361,Tackleman- Hope all is well buddy. I saw the pictures from across the bay looked like a pretty but very messy mess LOLHopefully you survived the power outages and cleared a safe path out if you needed to!Hopefully this is not a hint of a bad winter for you guys but I am sure the Lakes are happy getting a lil water put into them!
1493462,Moondog,2012-10-07 09:44:00,362,What happened up there? Mary said she just lived thru the worst snow storm ever. Has the lake level come up any????
1493484,tackleman,2012-10-07 11:59:00,444,"thursday it started a rain snow mixture then it changed to snow, then the snow eventually took over, combined with 50 to 60 kilometer an hour winds made the day and night pretty miserable, during the day (3pm) the power went out, hydro expected it to be on until 8pm but it never went back on until 6 pm the following day. the neigbours and i went out and plowed the road so we can make it out and had to cut a number of trees back that covered the road.the only reason mary said it was the worst one , she spends her winters in Florida, (lucky soul) so she doesn't see the big ones. LOLoh yea, the water level is up a couple inches so far, gotta get the boat out when the road to the boat lift melts down."

That's Northern Ontario, the only place where you can have your furnace on in the morning and air conditioner in the afternoon."
1492716,Tonyo,2012-10-04 05:18:00,212,"I was just looking at the weather for Red Lake and it seems winter is starting today. 12"" of snow by tomorrow. Wow."
1492767,SinOrSwim,2012-10-04 07:51:00,1528,Crazy how fast it turns. We were just south of Ear Falls only 3 to 4 weeks ago and only wore long sleeves once. The rest of the week we were in shorts and short sleeves. I see it's light snow up there right now.
1492788,gregk9,2012-10-04 08:54:00,625,Holy cripe! Snow storm the fist week of October!!!????Looks like a long winter ahead!!
1492801,tackleman,2012-10-04 09:22:00,444,just put the snow plow on the quad and got it all gassed up and ready to go.
1492838,Golden Eagle,2012-10-04 11:05:00,2642,From inside my cabin. Burning lots of wood.
1492847,ManitouBass,2012-10-04 11:57:00,201,"Oh gawsh it's only -3! lol Thats still sweater weather, even with 40km/h winds! Looks like most of Northwestern Ontario is getting hit throughout this week(end). I'm just west of Emo right now and its rainy and windy, but above zero at least until tonight. I love this weather though! It signals the change when all the big walleye/smallies start hitting."
1492873,wallydave,2012-10-04 13:21:00,2151,"I got an e-mail from Andrea, snow, wind and rain welcoming the Moose Hunters at Goose Bay!"
1492890,NathanH,2012-10-04 14:08:00,697,Sounds like a great way to spend a day to me.
1492992,pegasis0066,2012-10-05 00:22:00,64,In TN? It's probably still in the 90s there.
1492999,Juls,2012-10-05 03:51:00,13414,Can't we at least have a Fall first?? I'm not ready for winter yet. That's almost as bad as the stores stocking Christmas displays before Halloween! (That's happening here already...sigh)Juls
