I am mostly looking for big pike and numbers for walleye. Has anyone been to either one of these places and could they give me input on the fishing? thanks in advance."
525670,redlaker,2002-12-02 13:36:00,0,Birch Lake is a great lake.
525671,River_eye,2002-12-02 19:23:00,1486,Did you already rule out Viking outposts in Red Lake? Never heard anything but good things about them.
525672,Guest,2002-12-02 19:25:00,0,I looked into viking but i want an american plan lodge and viking I think is outpost only
525673,Dave,2002-12-02 19:30:00,258,They offer both options
525674,Guest,2002-12-04 07:31:00,0,I've been to Viking Is. the fishing wasn't what I expected it to be walleye were hard to get. and the camp was pretty old.
525675,phishfearme,2002-12-05 10:30:00,1242,"micah - have been to way north and would definitly recommend them. although i was there when kevin geary owned it, i've heard nothing but praise about the new owner. two things i'd check with before i booked: 1 - ask him where's the generator? how loud is it? how much do you keep it on? (we had a cabin right next to it and it was miserable - i hear it's been moved and is new.). 2 - can i have a boat anytime i want to fish south trout (where the lodge is)? we could never seen to get a boat to just fish the excellent lake where the camp is. if you go, make sure you do at least one day trip to setting net lake.i've also been to springpole lake from which we could portage to birch. we didn't do very good but it also wasn't a very good test. the birch river flowage was, however, excellent. lota and lots of walleye and good trophy pike fishing. never been to the lodge though. good luck,phish"
