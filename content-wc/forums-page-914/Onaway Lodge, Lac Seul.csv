She wants to go back next year. The latest owners, Kathy & Blair, are absolutely super people. They both are working real hard at getting this resort in top condition. Many new improvements over the last three years. I'll be there the second week in June (6-13) again next year. The fishing has been fantastic every year. Lots of 24"" to 26""+ eyes. Even got a couple 29"" two years ago. The boat ride does get a bit long at times, but the fishing is worth it. We only fish walleyes, no northerns. The only problem the last few years has been the weather. It's rained most days the last couple years. Normally we've had great weather on this week. Last year was when all the roads washed out, had to go thru Thunder Bay just to get back to Minneapolis. Hopefully this year will be nicer. I'd recommend this resort very highly. Have you check to see if they have any openings for June next year? I need to call them and reserve my second week with my wife. Let me know if you do go up in June. We'll be in cabin #3 again."
525682,Walleye Wacker,2002-12-04 15:34:00,6,Be careful going to lac Seul for two weeks that time of year. You will want to make sure you have plenty of Ben-Gay and ice packs. Your little arms will get very tired pulling in all the Walleyes you can catch in two weeks. I would suggest you start a physical fitness program right now and build up those biceps....the walleye on Lac Seul have ruined many a man who thought he could handle their vicious and frquent bite for two weeks in June...GOOD LUCK
