525536,retire55,2002-11-23 09:35:00,1029,"Hi Mike:Absolutely not.Although Lake Kipawa is 50 miles long, there are only a few areas where it is wide (potentially dangerous in small boats). There is a multitude of areas to fish regardless the weather due to the number of small islands, bays, etc. You just need to do your homework before you pick a spot (outfitter) to try and fish Kipawa. Ensure you have easy access to the kind of water (and structure) you're looking for to have some success (whether it be for walleyes, lake trout or northern pike).Topographical maps are a start but I would recommend you get copies of the bathymetric (depth) maps for Lake Kipawa. These maps afford selection of potential fishing areas without ever seeing the lake. Jay"
525537,Guest,2002-12-02 06:36:00,0,Where can I get a map of lake Kipawa?
525538,retire55,2002-12-02 07:28:00,1029,"Hello again Mike:There are three topographical maps required if you want to view the complete Lake Kipawa. There is 31M/3, 31L/14 and 31L/15.You can obtain the bathymetric maps for Lake Kipawa from: Ministère de l'Environnement Centre d'expertise hydrique du Québec 675, boul. René Lévesque Est, Aile René-Lévesques 1er étage, boîte 20 Québec (Qc) G1R 5V7 Téléphone : 418-521-3876 Madame Diane Morin, poste téléphonique : 7317 Email: [email protected]Remember, if you are telephoning, it's Quebec City (you should be comfortable in the French language as it is by law their language of work). I emailed Madame Morin and she did respond in English that the maps could be obtained there. The copy of the bathymetric maps (5 maps) that I received originally were on 8.5 X 11.5 paper and they were difficult to read/interpret. Consequently, I enlarged the specific areas I was interested in with a photocopier. These bathymetric maps have been invaluable with respect to selecting areas to fish before ever reaching the lake.
