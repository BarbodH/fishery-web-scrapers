525597,Thumper,2002-11-25 19:36:00,133,You know you are in trouble with your currency when.....A Canadian was mugged in Michigan this past week and had $35 Canadian in his wallet. The American mugger sent him on his way saying the money is no ##### good. This is a true story and published in our Thunder bay paper this morning.

525599,Guest,2002-11-26 13:48:00,0,I love Canadian cash.....we use it to play poker when we are on our fishing trip...that way I can bet big and just really lose a little.....TRUE STORY
525600,Guest,2002-11-30 17:59:00,0,Scoop up our Canadian Dollar Boys...... Get a huge mitt full for gambling.......... Thats perfect!We need more US people like you to buy it up and send the value higher! Thanks!!
525601,bigfish1965,2002-12-01 23:27:00,3210,"No actually, we want the value lower! A higher rate of exchange does keep the Americans flooding in and spending their hard earned bucks. It also makes Canadian products more attractive and our exports skyrocket. A weaker dollar also keeps Canadians home ( why would ya wanna go anywhere else anyway.) See..the dollar is peachy!"
525602,Guest,2002-12-02 09:16:00,0,"While I do agree with some of what your saying bigfish1965, My job does not depend on tourists as yours does and no doubt you get paid in US funds so that sits well with you but not me.Consider the late 80's early 90's when the Can Buck was close to 95. cents..... The economy was going very well in fact so I don't buy into the low dollar is our only means of survival crap.I have to purchase imported consumer US goods like everyone else in Canada and I don't like to see the price's keep increasing because of or low dollar value and BS goverment policys.I also don't like to see rates posted in US Funds in Canada to me that should be illegal."
