525594,Guest,2002-11-28 06:58:00,0,"Just north of Lac Seul is Lake Wenasaga, about 8 miles long and fed by the Wenasaga River. I understand that Lake Wenasaga empties into Lac Seul. Anyway I believe there is a boat launch ramp on the lake and that the housekeeping rates for Camp Wenasaga, the resort, are reasonable. If you don't have your own boat, the camp boats are equiped with 15 hp Johnson outboards (nice for those of us who cann't pull the rope as hard as we used too). I have not fished the lake but my brother took his wife and daughters there a few years back. Good Walleye fishing. For further information try the website: http://www.wenasaga.com"

The camp is about 5mins from the public launch on Lac Seul which you can trailer to no sweat and you can cover all the basis. Rates are really good, cabins are nice and clean and the owner Rick is a great guy.Can't beat the price and service at Deer Path thats for sure.GL."

Cabin on lake was $695 US / week for family rate (4 people) and included 16' boat, 25 hp motor, 20 gallon of gas, and 20 dozen minnows. Each extra person over 4 add $50. Paved road to the camp and good boat ramp. My sons and I caught and released on average 100 - 150 walleye a day along with approximately 50 pike a day average(fishing from two boats).
