The host country will supply boats and motors ( Donkeys ). You need only supply fishing equipment i.e. rods, reel, tackle etc.A couple rules to be concerned with:1. All Walleye must not exceed slot limit. The slot limit will be explained to all Western anglers after the final weigh in. All participans violating said limit will be stoned.2. All anglers must bring their own fuel ( feed ). Any angler that loses and engine ( Donkey ) will be forced to sleep with the Wife of an Iraqi angler. After which the wife will be stoned. After the stoning, any acts of kindness by said Iraq angler would be purely coincidental3. And lastly, drinking alcohol is forbiden. Violators will be stoned, shot and then stoned again.1st prize gets a Scud Missle. ( In need of only a few parts )2nd prize gets a barrel of Botulism3rd Prize gets a T-shirt that Says "" I survived the 1st Annual Iraqi Fishing Tournament"".4th --- last place. all will be stoned.Uh oh it's a monster. Dad put down that beer and get the net! And watch out for those people throwing stones!!Ivy"
