Next fall I will be driving to Alaska from Minnesota (crossing ar North Dakota) to hunt. I will have long guns, 22, 12 guage, 30:06 and 300 magnum. Will I be charged for each of these guns, even though they will not be used in Canada? If so, will I be charged again when I come back from Alaska into the Yukon? In the past I drove the ALCAN Highway 3 times, and I know times have changed."

You need to contact your customs to be sure your not going to have any problems on your end when you return.Lucky you are, I can't even come close to bringing a firearm in the US from here just to drive thru.......What a pant load!!"
