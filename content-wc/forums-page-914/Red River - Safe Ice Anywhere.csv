525578,Guest,2002-12-03 11:00:00,0,RedriverfisherWere you fishing near Sugar Island? Is the six inches of ice pretty consistent all over? What color jig do you prefer? I'll check with you about the ice conditions on Friday. Good luck fishing. Are salties still the best bait? Also what is the current like? Dou you need heavy jigs?

On average theres's about eight inches of ice. Some guys are actually driving on it, but I think that I'll wait for a little more ice before I venture out with my vehecle.Regards,Stu"

I talked to ""Cork'n Sucks Bredeson"" today and he sounds kinda interested in a trip North on the ice. He went and bought himself a new monster crew cab Ford truck with a super turbo-deisel powerplant under the hood, he wants to stretch its legs. His old new truck must have been shot or something? HA! ;)Maybe I can find a dance partner over in East Selkirk too Eh?:DEd ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson...><sUMo>Backwater Guiding"

525556,Stu,2002-11-26 07:21:00,472,"Hey Dave,I just want to thank you for the update regarding this very sad tragedy. My heart and prayers goes out to those little brothers and also too the loved ones they left behind. Please let there be no negative comments regarding these events. Leave it in the hands of the lord as only the lord can ease the painin this families heart."
525557,Guest,2002-11-27 09:33:00,0,"Has anyone ever tried tipups on the Red? Also, are you allowed to use two lines in the winter. I am planning to come up Dec. 7. Do you think the ice will be safe by than? Can a person go on by that airport that is close to Sugar Island, cause I think I'll be fishing by Sugar Island. Are the greenbacks basically in the same areas that they are in late October?"
525574,Guest,2002-11-27 19:18:00,0,"Lake Dauphin is where its at. 10 inches of ice and the eyes are going nuts. Lots of large eyes between 20 and 24 inches, and about 1 out of 4 are keepers, under 18 inches. Guys are driving trucks out last weekend, but I would recommend ATV'S or sleds. Don Lamont was out last week and again is impressed with our fishery, that is if you know how to handle a 6lb. eye in 2 feet of water. There is nowhere to go but sideways, hang on and have fun! If you ever do break through, just stand up, it'only up to your waist. Just opened a Bait and Tackle shop here at Sticky's, so stop in and say hi. I will point you in the right direction.

525576,Guest,2002-12-03 07:14:00,0,"Does anybody have any fishing reports on the Red? If its as cold up there as it is in Minnesota it should be making lots of ice this week.I might try it this weekend. Are they driving four wheelers or snowmobiles out there. I will probably be fishing the Sugar Island area. Anything biting, and if so what is the best depth to be in?"

525577,Guest,2002-12-03 10:44:00,0,there is about 5 to 6 inches of ice i was out twice last week on wednesday we pulled out 5 walleyes and 12 saugers on sunday we pulled out 3 saugers and saw 4 or 5 26 + inchers pulled out.

525546,gms,2002-11-23 16:33:00,91,"Looking to see if there is any ""safe"" ice on the Red River near Lockport/Selkirk. Is there anybody venturing out. Would appreciate some sound advice on where people are going. Imagine closer to Netley would be the first area to freeze up?"
525547,Guest,2002-11-23 17:23:00,0,river ice is always scary
525548,Guest,2002-11-23 20:17:00,0,"As frustrating as it may seem, there just isn't any safe ""river"" ice too be had on the Red.Obviously we need some cold days & nights to condition the for safe travel. I've seen a few guys out on the ice this past week by the island and my only comment is,that they had to be fishing for the pot! Why else would they display such stupidity!?!Risking ones well being for the simple pleasure of catching some fish?My advise is too stay off the Red until she's safe. In other words, show her a little respect because she not going too show you any!!Besides there are other alternatives that you can take advantage of."
525549,Guest,2002-11-24 02:22:00,0,"I have to agree with you ""Cat""illac man. I've heard that the ice on the Red is only about 4 inches thick. That may be thick enough for foot travel on a lake but you wouldn't catch me out on the river with only 4 inches. With the current there is bound to be thinner spots. I hear the ice on Lake Manitoba and Lake Dauphin is about 8 inches thick and people are driving their cars on Lake Dauphin. I could see going out with a snowmobile or ATV but I thought you needed at least 12 inches of ice for a vehicle? Let's hope nobody gets killed."
525550,Backwater Eddy,2002-11-24 08:30:00,3871,"Please be safe folks and talk to your kids about staying off the ice yet.Tragically 2 youths drown yesterday and another in in critical condition.Do not assume kids know to stay off the ice, PLEASE remind them!As we now river ice is especially dangerous due to moving water, so be very carefully and do not Rush anything.Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson...><sUMo>Backwater Guiding"
525551,Guest,2002-11-24 12:05:00,0,"Right on northern blue! Lake Dauphin is one alternative that I was referring too. They are absolutely hammering them on Dauphin. We'replaning a trip up there sometime this upcoming week. Hey Ed, what a tragic bit of news. E-mail me the details of where thistook place."
525552,Backwater Eddy,2002-11-24 12:54:00,3871,"It was not on the Red Stu but it was in my Central Red River region on a pond, sad deal. It actually happened on the 22nd I think, I caught it in the news today?We see accidents like this every year near the Holidays, so I like to remind folks to be sure and discuss the dangers with those adventurous kids. Like you said Stu, no fish is worth pushing your luck. Early ice with no snow looks darn inviting to kids looking to have some fun so we all need to be vigilant to the dangers.My heart does out to the families of those unfortunate children.Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson...><sUMo>Backwater Guiding"
525553,Dave in Walker,2002-11-24 21:57:00,1294,"Stu, this actually happened on a pond near Anoka Minnesota, just NW of the cities, a 2, 5, and 6 year old broke thru thin ice on a pond, by the time the mom discovered them she pulled out the 2 year old and it took the fire dept another 10 minutes to recover the other 2. My prayers our with the family, the 5 and 6 year old did not make it, just maybe the 2 year old will, but reports are not good. I have seen this happen all to many times with my career on the Minneapolis Fire Department, simply tragic"
525554,Dave in Walker,2002-11-25 16:47:00,1294,"Update, the miracle did not happen, the 2 year old died today, 3 boys from the same family. a tragedy."
