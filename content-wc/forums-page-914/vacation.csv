525466,WillieB,2002-11-16 20:48:00,292,What area are you wanting to go to??
525467,Guest,2002-11-17 15:31:00,0,Forget the fish and hunt ontario place. The owner looks like a dick and they only accept cash as payment.I see no rate listed that just includes a cabin when you want to bring your own boat so forget those loosers.What area do you want to go to? I have been everywhere in Ontario so maybe I can help you out on your area of choice.
525468,Guest,2002-11-18 01:09:00,0,check out Minaki area. www.paradisecoveminaki.comWRD
525469,Karl,2002-11-21 23:11:00,63,http://www.pickerelarm.com/Best place in nw ontario. Hardest to get into though. 99% repeat custermers (like me).
525470,Guest,2002-11-22 14:52:00,0,Ontario is a big province. Can you be a little more specific as to what area you like to travel to? A trip to Lac Suel is always worthwhile. TGG
525471,Guest,2002-11-22 21:10:00,0,Take a look at the ENGLISH RIVER.Lots of water many places to go to.Look at the lodges around KENORA.
