525540,Guest,2002-11-23 15:52:00,0,"MY wife and four children can't wait to get up to crawfords from year to year. Nice cabins and a beach for kids to play with other children and mothers sit there watching and gabbing. Fishing on crow is mostly for lake trout, bass, muskie. Never been to lake of the woods dock, Yet! We go in august mostly. Larry"
525541,Guest,2002-11-24 08:25:00,0,"You could go to Crawford's if you want. There are much better places to go if you want the beach and LOTW. Try Hanson's Wilderness Lodges they have a lodge on both lake and nicer cabins with better guest services. The road LOTW from Crawford's is long and in bad shape and once you get there you have to drive so far before you get to good fishing in the spring and summer. At Hanson's you can stay at both resorts and both have beaches, Canoes and Kayaks are provided for no extra charge check it out http://www.hansonslodges.com/"

I'm not trying to start an argument, I'm just commenting."

Our group of eight use the Stevens Bay ramp all week long and its only fifteen minutes from the cabins. Most of the road is gravel but its not bad at all! I have not fished Crow lake but it is an awsome lake! If you choose to stay there you will not be sorry! Email me if you need any more info [email protected]"

525544,bellbuoy,2002-12-02 06:00:00,490,"Retire55,I agree! For me, my wife and 6 year old (too much energy to be on an island for 2 weeks so their LOTW location is out) at their Crow Lake Facility it would be $1540 US vs Crawford's $1210, for a housekeeping trip.Bellbuoy"
