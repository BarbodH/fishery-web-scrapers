Our assumption ( I never did a cost analysis ) is that it would be far more cost beneficial to drive further and Fly less to eventually get to our outpost. It takes us about 12 hours to get to International Falls. And then 3 to 5 hours more North of the border. It only takes 5 hours to get to Minneapolis. ( Yikes, this is starting to sound like an Algebra question! )However, as more and more time constraints come into play, I am wondering if it would be better to Fly out of Fort Francis or even Minneapolis if someone had reasonable rates. Assuming you are getting to a good lake, good outfittter, etc.If you only have 7 days of vacation to work with, 2 days are for travel and you are driving all night or all day which takes atoll on you as well.Ivy"

I think you could go to the other board http://www.northwesternontario.com and check our outfitters from Fort Frances, etc., and see how much a 200 mile flyin or distance comparable to the lake you now flyin from further north. It would help to have a good map of Canada that identified the lakes.One map that may be of interest to you is Vacation Package Guide and Map. Try 1-800-665-7567 or http://www.ontariossunsetcountry.ca It has resorts numbered and a spreadsheet showing facilities, addresses, phone, etc. The email address is [email protected]Map information is from my 1999 version."
525717,Guest,2002-12-04 12:53:00,0,The website with flyin information by town or city is http://www.justfishontario.comI had incorrectly listed as http://www.northwesternontario.comAnyway my idea is to look at an outfitter such as Rusty Meyer who flys out of Fort Frances and find a destination that is comparable to one you currently go go. Compare dollar cost of driving to flying and time saved by flying instead of driving.

525720,phishfearme,2002-12-05 10:20:00,1242,ivy - i think in general your assumption is correct but there's also competitive pressure. red lake and ear falls have lots of fly-in outfitters and they keep each others price in check. we've used viking outposts in the past - they have a number of lakes within a 20-30 mike flight that are reasonable - and this year we're going out of pickle lake with albany river outfitters to a 25 mile flight lake. albany river seem to have very reasonable prices and i did a pretty good search for references at this site.we drive from the pittsburgh area and the drive sucks but we do have the time.phish
