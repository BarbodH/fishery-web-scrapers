He always caught a lot of fish and he caught some real wallhangers if anyone in his right mind would hang a Pike on the wall. I would beg him to go walleye fishing and he would only laugh and say"" who would want to catch those loaves of bread"". Well finally the last few years he realized the thrill all real fisherman get when catching a nice Walleye on ultra light rod and reel with 6lb test line. He now will fish Pike about one hour a week and the rest of the time enjoy the thrill of ""Walleye Fishing"". I was wondering if any of you other Walleye Fisherman have ever had the same problem educating a lowley Pike Fisherman into becoming a real man and stepping up to catch the elusive Walleye? This particular gentleman is now much easier to get along with...I think its because of the inner peace we all derive from the Walleye as opposed to cleaning Pike slime out of your dipnet all day."

Pike are fun, but it does hurt when guests insist on leaving what your sure is going to be a cosmic walleye bite to go catch pike ;). Walleyes are tempermental, and you have to get'em while they're going, but some people want pike. <shrug>What can you do?Guess if your an occaisional angler the learning curve for walleye catching is a little longer. Plus pike is mostly casting, which some anglers lovge to do,and that's not always the best way to get walleye."

As much as I love to catch them, (the thrill is still in the catching) I would honestly be bored to tears, if I spent my entire angling effort pursuing only walleye.There are simply too many tremendous fisheries out there to pass up!Battling twenty pound catfish always gets my mojo going. The same applies when it comes to tangling with the extremely powerful lake sturgeon. There's something about watching a big fish that you've just hooked, come leaping completely out of the water! How about a smallmouth session on the fly rod, especially when they're busting surface poppers. If that don't bring a smile to your face!It doesn't matter too me weather it's a double figure walleye or a little crappie, I find them all challenging and exciting. I guess at the end of the day, you and only you can decide how too best spend those special hours out on the water. If your thing is to pursue walleye only, all the power to you brother!"
