2372673,Mike Borger,2014-01-21 20:47:00,1554,I answered the question myself LOL!https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...hlight=Windsor
2372761,Snood,2014-01-21 21:39:00,2,"There are some nice pike and eyes in Windsor. The biggest pike that we boated was 19 1/2 lbs. Others in the 10 - 17 lb. range. Plenty of walleyes in the 2-3 lb. range. There is a lot of water to fish. We always fish the third week of June. At that time of year the weed beds are just starting in the shallows. The water level on this system can change a lot from spring to fall. Sometimes as much as 5 feet. There are two other cabins on the lake, however, we have never seen anyone use them. Keep your hooks sharp, Jerry"
1502857,new hips,2012-11-09 09:56:00,498,"Let me say this...........I know that these posts are due to enthusiasm. I also do as much research before booking a trip. If your spending $1500 for a week of fishing, you better know whats in store. I've been on over 25 Canadian trips, believe me not all outfitters are great guys. I went to Beteau this year and had a PB Northern in less than 4 hours, that might generate some enthusiasm. Are you suggesting keeping the posts to just trip reports?I usually PM people with specific information when inquiring. Solo and many others have been invaluable for information, sending marked maps for free, lures that worked the best........they will answer anything you throw at them.Phish............share the love, list some of Your lakes where you can catch 5-20 Trophy Norhern in a week. While your at it use the Search function for Lac Seul...........there might be ""Numerous Posts""...........better put a stop on some of those while Your at it. Save Yourself some Meltdown.......Don't read the ""Numerous Posts"" stick to General Discussion.My Thanks.......to everyone that has helped me make informed decisions no matter what body of water I'm interested in. Don't let a few negatives spoil what is a great bunch of informed, knowledgeable fisherman."
1502878,Pymbet,2012-11-09 10:58:00,42,"I agree that this is good post-election entertainment. I too think Eddie's gets a few too many taglines here. But I read them all having been on Beteau long before Eddie in the old Carl Salling days (1990s). It was a great fishing trip even in the rather run down buildings there then, so I like to hear what people are saying today. It is kind of interesting, however, that the next camp downstream on the Attawapiskat (I'll avoid the advertising plug, but from my tag you may guess which one I am talking about) doesn't get one-tenth the chatter of Eddie's. But anyone who has been to both would tell you that fishing there, is great and arguably better, especially for walleye, than Beteau. And the camp is topnotch with running water, electricity ...."
1502971,Walleye Wanderer,2012-11-09 16:07:00,101,"Hey Paul, just wanted to say I agree 100% on your post and further on Mikes comments as well. Maybe it is time to quit talking about Eddies here and form the ""secret society"" c/w our own web site, forum, secret handshake, etc. so not to offend the delicate sensibilities of other fishermen, some of which fish alone. It is truly unfortunate with the multitudes of posts on this forum that certain individuals feel compelled to keep reading and negatively commenting on posts that they obviously have no interest in thereby ruining enthusiastic discussion by those that are genuinely interested in sharing stories, information and experiences. I personally have read a few posts that didn't particularly interest me but I have never felt compelled to interrupt a discussion only to suggest that the topic was out of order, too commercialized, etc. If the ""secret society"" is out of the question then I simply suggest ignoring the haters, continuing with the sharing of information, which tackle to use, experiences, etc and perhaps the ""negatives"" will go away..."
1503137,wallydave,2012-11-10 09:32:00,2151,"Every now and then good fishing trip reports seem to stir up some bad feelings. I have no connection with Goose Bay Camp, where I have many good fishing trips. My posts are simply trying help others to have good trips too! I have never been fishing out of Eddies, Hidden Bay or Ghost River but because of good reports here and from people I have talked to these places and a few other fellow WC members my ""bucket list"" is getting longer!! Isn't the reason this site and other sites like this operate is to help us find places that offer the best trips possible? We have the option to read these posts or not. Lets try to keep some perspective on these ""glowing reports ""."
1503181,deputy dog,2012-11-10 13:37:00,305,"This site as well as solo's initial report is how I became aware of eddie's. after my trip I simply wanted pass along my experience for other fisherman that may be looking for a new outfitter. This site is invaluable for honest opinions and experiences with many different outfitters. One can get a honest and accurate opinion about a lake and outfitter without solely relying on what the outfitter ""sells"" them. I truly believe the guys who have been to eddie's are simply happy with what he offers and the type of person as well as businessman he is. I also believe probably 75% or more of his clientele have learned of him from this site which is why there is sooo much traffic regarding his operation. There is no conspiracy just satisfied clients who many of which happen to be members of his site.....my .02"

We don't need extar ""board police"" telling us it's too many or too little, I think we are all grown up enough to sort through the data, if not dpon't even look anywhere!"

1503771,JTB,2012-11-12 20:31:00,3,I like to hear the different reports about the lakes and camps. Hate to see that go away.
1503856,turtle chain,2012-11-13 08:18:00,1398,When lake shopping you must be very specific as to what you want.One group will be extremely happy catching 50 eater walleye and some 28 inch northern and some 16 inch smalleye's.Another group want's big fish most fly ins I have been on the walleye range 16-21 and a 24 or maybe a 26. Lodging is another matter some guy's want fancy cabins and other guy's dont care it is really tough finding a camp that fits everyone's needs price is another big deal.a good honest opinion from a non resort related source is most valuable in your serch

If satan himself was reopening Windsor I'd probably be interested LOL!Been eyeing that water for several years now.Just trying to do some due diligence on the lake and yet another Eddienorth scandal breaks out."

1502321,GOBIG,2012-11-07 10:51:00,126,"I got the same email. Why would a owner not send out ""MASS EMAIL"" to let any present, past or future guests know about it. I have known for 2 years that it was coming, I was just waiting for some info on here. Eddie has a great operation, does a great job while in camp, and most of all makes sure you have a SPECTACULAR time while in camp. And NO not every owner is great, trust me. Why bash someone on a open forum, if you or anyone else does not like to here about Eddie's or another camp stay off the forum. People like this should not be on here."
1502376,Larry S,2012-11-07 14:56:00,665,"Solopaddler I went to Windsor June 16 to 24th 2006 when Northern outposts had the lake. Had an excellent trip for walleye ,despite a day and a half of a monsoon rain storm We mainly fished for walleye and caught many nice eyes in the 20 thru 25 inch range The biggest eye was 27 1/2 .Also caught some nice pike in the 30 to 37 range.Lots of narrow neckdown areas with strong current to fish for eyes I'm sure if you concentrated on pike you would get many nice sized fish I have a posting from 07/02/2006 on this website with a report on Windsor,the cabin when we were there was ok. I would go back to this lake if I had a chance .Message me if you have any questions Larry S"

1502405,Weby13,2012-11-07 16:33:00,57,I too received the mass email that Eddie sent about Windsor. I agree with others that every owner you deal with is not great!!! I have also had some bad experiences! I went to Beateau in August with my family. I did as much research as I could before I booked our trip. Our group especially my 7 year old son had a great trip and we would book again with Eddie. I wish more owners would take the time to call and email you back ASAP! Tooski I just have 2 questions for you. If you wanted to be secluded and didnt want the owner around why did you book with Eddie when you know he stays at the camp with you? Also if Richter lake wasnt comfortable for you why did you book a 2nd trip in the same year back to Richter? I have no affiliation with Eddie other than a pleased first time customer who had a great family experience!!!
1502453,pike50plus,2012-11-07 18:40:00,584,"Solo has been a greta resource to a lot of people here ans has even been a guide , he does proper reasearch just as I would, we discussed windsor on the phone before he even posted his inquiry. I was going to do the same, seems a reasonable request. Do you have anything to contribute on the fishing at windsor or not?"
1502632,Mike Borger,2012-11-08 12:29:00,1554,"Thanks Larry, appreciate it."
1502807,phishfearme,2012-11-09 06:49:00,1242,"after re-reading tooski's post, i would say it's much more of a concern for the integrety of this site rather than bad-mouthing eddie. after the ""enough already"" thread from some time ago, i am convinced that the steady run of postings for eddie - that continue to this day - are due to enthusiasm rather than an advertising effort. BUT, i can certainly see tooski's main point. for example: - some one has to cancel his week with eddie and he posts the opening here - wtf? - eddie buys an old LUP and a posting occurs with people lining up to book - wtf? - a posting for what baits to use on beteau - wtf? - fishin canada broadcasts a show on eddie and up comes the post these are only a few more recent examples - but on any given day you can find an eddie post on the front page. i am certain that eddie is a fine outfitter - however, there are also LOTS of other excellent outfitters out there who provide at least as good fishing and certainly better accomodations with much shorter flights but they only get a very small fraction of the posts that eddie receives - if they receive any posts at all. there's a fine line between enthusiasm and advertising. phish"
1502854,IaDave,2012-11-09 09:45:00,476,there's a fine line between enthusiasm and advertising. phish[/QUOTE] Phish- I'm with you on this one and your entire post. I also question all the posts that were popping up about Hidden Bay in Sioux Lookout.
1501819,Mike Borger,2012-11-05 14:53:00,1554,"Was just speaking with Eddienorth and it seems he's recently aquired this camp from the natives in Lansdowne House. From what I've gathered it was formerly operated by Northern Outposts in Armstrong.It's a no brainer for him as it's on the north channel of the Attawapiskat located directly north of his current camp.The amount of water to fish is almost intimidating looking at the map.In any case he'll be working on improving the camp next year and is going to open it for 2014.I'm tempted to book something right now for 2014, but would LOVE to hear from any WC members who've fished this lake in years past. I'd especially love to know if the trophy pike fishing is comparable to his main camp on Beteau.In this situation asking Eddie won't help because his guess is as good as mine LOL!Cheers, Mike"
1501849,TIGHTLINER,2012-11-05 16:40:00,223,Mike I am going to be watching this post very close a year ago when I was at Edddie's main camp on the river he had talked with us about opening another camp about 10 miles from his main camp. He did mention the cabin was there it just needed lots of work to bring it up to what he wanted it to be. I think once again this is a widening of the Attawapiskat river and this has been named Windsor. I am sure someone has fished out of this camp years ago and will be posting something on it. With Eddie I am sure he will do what he can to make it as comfortable as possible for the fisherman. He is a class act and has put a lot of work into his main camp.
1501866,RickOnt,2012-11-05 17:37:00,217,"Hey MikeLooking at the maps Windsor looks amazing. Lots of shoreline and many many islands, twice as much as Beteau!Almost looks like there is an upper and lower Lake system.Rick"
1501931,wallydave,2012-11-05 21:16:00,2151,"Eddie and I had some emails going back and forth about 2014 trips. Windsor came up, Eddie noted that it looked like Windsor would be a fantastic walleye destination, some big pike too! He wasn't sure if the cabin would be ready by ""14. It would be extremely cool to be one of the first group to fish this part of the system!"
1501946,Mike Borger,2012-11-06 01:08:00,1554,Well you wouldn't be the first. There's been an outpost camp there for some time now.It does look like a lot of water though. I'm really just curious about the pike fishing...
1501994,wallydave,2012-11-06 07:56:00,2151,"Your right about the camp being there in the past, to be in a fresh cabin with Eddie as the owner would still be very cool!!"
1502111,tooski,2012-11-06 13:13:00,393,Why would that be cool?
1502130,adempsey,2012-11-06 14:24:00,963,"Have you talked to the previous owners at Northern Outposts? Perhaps they might be willing to share some information on the lake.

1502153,Pikeslayer8,2012-11-06 16:02:00,1460,Nobody has fished in this lake for years and from what I understand Eddie puts together comfortable accommodations for a fishcamp. Sounds pretty dang cool to me. Both Wallydave and myself were looking at this camp for a 2014 fall trip together. It would be spectacular if not for the price tag.
1502159,tooski,2012-11-06 16:58:00,393,"I guess cool has many definitions as does comfortable. I stayed at Eddies Richter Lake twice in one year. Comfortable would not be a word I would use. And if spectacular is what you are seeking,I doubt Windsor fits the bill. There are 24 posts on Windsor in the search function. I read them all. Not once did I see spectacular or huge northerns listed. When I do a fly-in, I want seclusion. I certainly don't want the owner living with us, and I don't care if he feeds the groundhogs or mountain lions. Honestly I find this fascination with Eddies services right at the point of commercialization on this board and that is wrong. I've met Eddie and he is a great guy. Most every resort owner I meet is great. If you want to debate my posting I am all for it. In private, [email protected]. Want to do it on this board, all the better. Think it is a coincidence that Solo posted his interest in Windsor the same day I got a group e-mail from Eddie re: Windsor?"
