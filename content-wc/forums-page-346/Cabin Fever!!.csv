2371185,NathanH,2014-01-21 13:48:00,697,"Yep your not the only one. I startED going through and sorting my tackle. I also have about 40 used lures I purchased that need to be cleaned and get new split rings and hooks. Once I am done with the lures I plan to start tying some bucktail jigs, maybe tie up a few spinners and make some florocarbon leaders for the first time."

2369401,btmbncr,2014-01-20 21:21:00,492,"It's only Jan 20th and I'm getting it bad.I have been over my Lac Seul maps,started going through my tackle,putting new line on my rods,getting lined up to tie leaders,got jigs out to powder coat.None of this has helped with the cabin fever.I talked with a fishing buddy on the phone tonight and that helped a little.Drinking or pestering my wife doesn't seem to help.I think I need self help meetings.Maybe V Bay Gord would let me split firewood just to get this out of my system.Ice fishing does nothing for me.I was thinking about pitching jigs tipped with little Friskies to my wifes cat but she's shut down due the recent cold front.It's going to be a long time until open water.Bill"
2369777,fishguide1800,2014-01-21 05:40:00,84,I hear you.iam polishing my rods.ice fishing will do it for me but its to cold here.were back in the deep freeze for another week and a half from the looks.not going on any holidays this winter.blew our holidays last fall in British Columbia.ill just have to wait till the weather gets better.then I'll make up for lost time.
2369849,v-bay gord,2014-01-21 06:19:00,3168,"I hear you also. Drinking a cup of coffee in the dark. Outside it's minus 30 Celsius (with a nice minus 40 wind chill). Lady on the radio was interviewing someone talking about the upcoming forest tent caterpillar infestation for 2014-15. If you remember the last one, then suddenly this weather ain't too, too bad. Will take the dogs on the snowshoe trail today and contemplate some ice fishing this week (need the pop up and heater for sure). Good day to answer the phone and field summer fishing questions. Always something going on at WC, and seems Eagle Lake always generates some topic as of late. Btmbncr I would enjoy watching you split some firewood for me.....better yet haul a bit into the house will ya, !"
2369857,catchingkman,2014-01-21 06:19:00,104,"keep looking at the boat and checking the over head door to see if there is dents in it , boat kicking to get out and go. also working on rods , tackle, jigs, hhhmmm your right starting to think I need help, I do ice fish but not the same, I want my soft water. well back to the boat and tackle house turn up the heat and wait. spring is coming hang in there. kman"
2369889,zeebee,2014-01-21 06:37:00,1144,"The bitter/sweet of having a passion in life that is at the same time within our grasp but then has this waiting thingy attached to it. The tormenting fact is that it will come but never soon enough and then....boof its gone and, the cycle starts again.Im gettin close to retirement and thinking I may relocate to NW Ont. Wife is game so it may just happen. Heaven on earth. Had a physician in my store the other day from Sioux Lookout. He has a cabin on Minnitaki and just bought property on Lac Suel where he will build another cabin this summer. Will cost half a million to get a decent lake front near Sioux Lookout these days but our kids are within a 4 hr drive. Would be a good life and cabin fever would be limited to bad storms and palm warmed cognac. 'scuse me gotta go listen to some Roy Orbison.... 'somthin 'bout a dream."
2370065,Skywagon,2014-01-21 07:44:00,1106,"Make sure to get a good ice shack when you move there zeebee, for years like this when many of the days the temps have not been fit to be out on the ice without one. With that said, when you are retired you can pick your days, no pressure to have to be out and many fishing options are nearby when you want to go."
2370329,LOW1,2014-01-21 09:10:00,2828,"Although nothing compared to NW Ontario we are not having an easy winter down here either. Only sixteen weeks (if lucky) to ice out. I am hoping to go to the Progressive boat/vacation show in MPLS to try and get a break, but that too is a long way off.I hope to spend summers in NW Ontario when I retire, but I think living there in the winters would be too tough."
2370537,Mike Kansas,2014-01-21 10:10:00,1463,Cabin fever puts me in the basement working on lures and filling customer orders. Also lucky enough to get to talk to a lot of the fisherman who buy from me and hear some fish stories or just exchange lies. Great life being involved with the nicest people in the world FISHERMAN. Mike Kansas
2370593,Gregking,2014-01-21 10:28:00,2658,"I got it also. I have restrung reels that didn't need it, tied spinner rigs to more than I could possibly use, reorganized tackle and labeled with label maker. Just last Sunday I went and purchased a 6 pole holder to mount on the wall of one of the guest rooms and installed my high dollar poles on it.All I got left to do is make some bottom bouncers out of some stainless rod I got.I guess I could install the sonar I sold my brother when his shop opens up.Maybe I will catch up with a buddy and make a drill bit case for my larger bits."
2371137,fishguide1800,2014-01-21 13:27:00,84,"Couple of my buddies fished out of a ice shack on minitaki yesterday, Harvey narrows.did well on walleys and a 32"" lake trout to boot.only 2 shacks out thete this year.iam headed there for a week mid February. Hope the weather perks up so I can fish out of the shack"
