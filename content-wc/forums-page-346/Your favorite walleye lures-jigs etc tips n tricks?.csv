I just really always fish a river, but not to change the subject, does anybody use those River rockers (lindy) anymore? I rarely hear them talked about.. good to hear somebody else uses Whistler jigs, tooSent from my HTC-PG762 using Tapatalk 2"
2246577,Guest,2013-11-30 07:18:00,0,"All time favorite lure for trolling; smaller size hot n tot, especially the moon glow colors. There's something about the metal lip that draws more strikes. The whistler jig has always been a favorite. Sometimes sweeping the rod tip, thus creating an increased whirring of the prop blade will result in an immediate strike."
2246673,KurtG,2013-11-30 08:18:00,259,"Small and slow, usually use a 1/32 jig with 1/3- 1/2 crawler. jig it bottom to 1-6 inches. Ideally if jig falls and head stops 1/2"" off bottom it is perfect. However it is rare to find conditions where this is possible. You dont want jig dragging the bottom but it must be close to it. Use 4 - 6 pound Tatsu or Fluorocarbon. Nice sensitive 8 - 10 foot rod really sensitive tip with a good strong backbone. Just a quick sweep to set hook. that long rod packs a lot of punch and it you really jerk, you will pull it out of the fish. Heavier jigs up to 1/8oz are sometimes needed due to wind and lake traffic. Next favorite is Hopkins spoons 3/8 - 1/2 ounce. Again fish as close to bottom as possible. I do not troll so cannot help on that front. Occasionally will cast cranks is 3-6 FOW along weed beds over stumps and trees. Follow up is Vibrating blades, both the swimming style and the jigging style. I do know a guy that fishes creek chubs exclusively from mid may thru december, He does catch a lot of walleye. But not many folks have a creek full of chubs 100' from their backdoor."
2246753,kzoofisher,2013-11-30 08:40:00,5144,"Early in the year I'm a big fan of blade baits. They work great on smallies and walleye and most of my closest water has good populations of both. Usually gold gets the 'eyes and silver gets the smallies, 1/2 oz, but sometimes you get a real mixed bag on a single color. They also pick up pike and whitefish. Summer is all about jigs. Twister tails, paddle tails and fluke tails, 3""-5"" in chartreuse, orange, white, yellow, silver, olive and combinations of those colors all depending on water clarity and dominant bait fish. 1/6 to 3/8 darter and round heads are the most common with 1/8 ounce being the go to start weight. Night time is stick baits, original rapalas and rebels with shad bodies a close second. Colors are mostly naturals. Fall will move me back to blades with cranks getting used a lot, too. I really like fatter bodied thumpers in the fall like hot-n-tots."
2379017,ma1819,2014-01-23 19:32:00,13,"Fished Gouin the past several years - including last June - the week we were there, walleye were not hitting jigs with consistancy. I am the troller in our group, others are pure vertical jiggers. Small rat-l-trap was the ticket - the walleye hammered them - 75-100 fish a day - I only had 3 of these and we ended up losing them all to pike - but blue/silver was the color they liked best. In the past on Gouin, blue/silver thin fin was the trolling plug of choice but not the week we were there last year. Small hot-n-tot also produced, but no where near the rat-l-trap. Last year, the Gouin was warmer than normal so most of the walleye had moved out in the big water (10-20 feet) and were not back in the bays - tough fishing when the wind comes up!good luck this spring -"
2195370,clegg,2013-10-31 12:18:00,38,"We're headed to the Gouin Reservoir on the first week of June. The three of us usually fish for Pike and Bass using top water lures (when we're closer to Montreal, where we're from). We have minimal experience with Walleye fishing. There seems to be vast amount of different techniques when it comes to Walleye fishing. Can anyone share their experiences in what works for them during that time? We're headed to Tamarac if that helps. I've seen some trolling rigs, people using 1 ounce jigs they bounce off the bottom, people using 1/8-1/4 ounce jigs they cast and retrieve while slowly trolling, etc. We're hoping to cover all our bases. Thanks in advance"
2195690,BornToFish,2013-10-31 15:15:00,1224,"I spend a LOT of time throughout the open water season in NW Ontario jigging for walleyes. Several things change throughout the open water season, but one thing always remains the same for me. That is, I always use the lightest jig that allows me to feel bottom. This concept keeps my lure/bait in the strike zone at all times. I always use six pound monofilament tied to a small swivel. I run about eighteen inches of six pound fluorocarbon from the swivel to the jig. I routinely use 1/16 ounce jigs to as deep as about 15-20 feet of water. I usually switch over to 1/8 ounce jigs when fishing deeper than about 20 feet of water or if the waves are problematic. I haven't used a 1/4 ounce or heavier jig in at least ten years. I almost always use a light power graphite fishing rod when fishing walleyes. This combiantion allows me to feel the bottom and the bite. It's more than enough of a combination for me to handle even the biggest of walleyes.My comments above are directed to fishing for walleyes associated with structure of some sort (e.g. shore lines, rock humps and the like). It's a different game chasing suspended walleyes.I believe that two things are important to my walleye success: keeping it LIGHT and keeping it SLOW! Good luck and tight lines!!"
2195706,ftfarms,2013-10-31 15:19:00,444,In the spring in Canada we use two methods the most. I love to cast 1/8 whistler jigs for walleye and the other goes back to good old fashioned fishing split shot and a gold hook. Most people make the mistake of fishing to fast early in the season use the lightest jigs and slow down. That's what works for us.
2197914,octanehi5,2013-11-02 06:38:00,1104,"To find the bite ,troll bottom bouncers with worm harness in from 8' to 20 ' of water once you locate,mr walleye,start to jig and drift fish that area, My favorite jigs are knuckelball jigs,1/8oz though 3/8, being able to feel the bottom and and lite rods are key to catching walleye ,a slow fishing method will work best,Crank baits as well as stick baits, paddletails,work well when casting.you will always catch more fish jigging,but bigger fish will be caught casting.Yo will find on the gouin that the water is contantly moveing due to the power generation plant, fish necked down areas were water moves faster, walleye always near by,if your catching walleye Mr Pike is not far away,The gouin holds some real monsters 35lb class. Worms and salted minnows are prime baits for walleye.Air Tam can tell you some of the hot spots.I use 6-8lb test 832 braid for my walleye fishing no leader needed, with a small very light jigging rod,The kind if a knat lands on it you will feel it.For the nonbeliever in this method I caughyt my personal best this last july of over 900 walleye in 7 days on Lac Hebert, jig fishing. You will find the Gouin to be a great fishery,Jean and Eliene run a great outfit,Tell them when you see them you spoke to me on WC Ron PS don't forget the beer batter and peanut oil"

2210882,TD 4,2013-11-08 14:12:00,5,"Second week in June last 27 years . Plain hook with glowbead, as light of weight as it takes to get to the bottom. Snell is about four feet . Same set up but Phelps floaters or Gum Drop jig which ever you call them. Tip with crawler or leech. Goes as slow as we can go."
2225330,Tylumps,2013-11-18 14:41:00,73,"Nobody is mentioning slip bobbers!! If the fish are in the mud, this happens during and anytime after a mayfly hatch, slip bobbers are deadly. So anytime after 1st week of June the walleyes will start hanging around large area's of flat non rocky area's that match the thermocline. If the wind is blowing good with a bit of a chop, just set your bobber to 1 foot off the bottom with a plain hook and crawler and throw into the wind a bit. Let the bobber just work the flat as the wind takes it and you will catch fish. It is best to use this method from the back of the boat because you can let the bobber work way behind the transom covering the most area. Remember most times later in the year from June through August the fish will be off shore. If you have your bobber set to 1 ft above bottom, the bait may very well be 12-25 feet down. When the bobber goes down. point your rod tip at the spot and reel in every bit of slack. When the slack is in you will have to set the hook with a long stroke so the tip of your rod will go from just off the surface of the water straight up as high as you can go...without falling of course. Keep the tip straight up as you reel in to ensure a good hook set.Slip bobbers on these flats will out work any jig if the chop on the water is good. If the fishing slows down, just throw a jig off the side of the boat. Most of the fish you put back stay right under you. Give it a try!!!!!Lumps"
2232530,Hillbiehle,2013-11-22 08:34:00,66,"I've always hovered and slip drifted (and still do) over reefs and keeping the line vertical as possible to pound the walleyes. Dick from Winoga got me back into anchoring, which is something that I got away from. I continue slipping/backtrolling but as soon as we get a double the anchor goes out. I've caught more fish by remaining on top of the fish than hovering with the motor on. No more drifting off the spot while rebaiting, netting fish, etc I've stayed on top of fish and just pounded them with the motor off (no gas smell is also nice) and just taking in the quiet scenery.The other trick that I think has helped me when jig fishing and incorporating ice fishing methods, particularly when my line is vertical and I can see my jig and fish on the electronics. When a fish doesn't seem to want to hit, I simply raise my jig up 2 or 3' off the bottom, shake it for about 5 seconds and then let it drop. It drives the fish nuts when they might be sluggish and they seem to hit every time."
2235370,adempsey,2013-11-23 13:34:00,963,"I primarily use vertical jigging with jig+grub or jig+meat(minnow or worm). I also enjoy other techniques like bottom bouncing with harnesses, trolling cranks, slip bobbers, and Lindy/slip weight rigs.On one of my recent trips I used several ""ice fishing"" jigs for Walleye fishing. Worked well for me. Blade baits and slab grabbers were fun to use."
2246274,wallydave,2013-11-29 20:24:00,2151,"My go to jigs are Captn Redbeard and Sirmanski jigs. On Lac Seul pink has been a good color, using the Capt. jigs when fishing in the current from the Wenasaga River. Mike Kansas, Mr. Sirmanski lures and jigs, on Red Lake the yellow chartuse was the go to color! Take several different colors and styles, if one is working, stay with it. If not keep trying different colors and styles! Thats half the fun!"
