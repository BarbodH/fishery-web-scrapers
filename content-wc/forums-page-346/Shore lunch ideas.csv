2379481,roscoe33,2014-01-24 00:46:00,653,"I have never felt the need or desire to keep more than my limit, and have not done so. Heck, we rarely even bring our limit back home, as our trip isn't about fish, but rather about family time and getting out into the wild. On our fall trip, we spend more time picking blueberries than fishing. But I have witnessed others get the tickets and fines, after blurting out that they had walleyes for lunch, and have their limits in the cooler. It really is something that slips people's minds. That's also why the MNR asks the question. And for you guys that like to take a cold fish sandwich in the boat with you, that could also put you over your possession limit. Remember, you have to be able to identify the size and species of all fish in your boat. FWIW, last year we had whitefish and northern for shore lunch. The year before that, we had some delicious perch."
2359994,revitup,2014-01-17 10:01:00,140,It's my guess that particular shore lunch was enjoyed on a Thursday or Friday--assuming a Saturday to Saturday trip.

2369593,roscoe33,2014-01-21 00:46:00,653,"We usually pick one day of the trip to go fish the far side of the lake, so we may be 2 hours from camp. We do shore lunch that day. Its good to break up a 10 or 12 hour day, get your feet back on land for a while, feed the eagles, and take a poop if needed. We keep it simple and relatively fast. Single burner propane, large fry pan, a chunk of butter and the potatoes already in it. A can of beans or corn in a ziplock bag. Salt, pepper, fork, paper plate. Someone cooks the taters while I filet the fish. Then I cook the fish. Eat the veggies cold, or throw them in the pan after the fish are done. Just remember, if the MNR asks about your shore lunch, you had perch for lunch."

2370785,SinOrSwim,2014-01-21 11:12:00,1528,I believe that is hsi way to keep more fish than allowed.

Oh, finally, I really like Spam, it's not just for emergencies."

Fun and entertaining things always seem to happen when you take an island break. Just for fun, here are some pictures of one of our favorite shore lunch spots."
2356386,new hips,2014-01-16 07:50:00,498,"Most years we always did 1-2 shore lunches. Unfortunately with some of the larger groups we had, there were always plenty that didn't know how to fillet. There were 3-4 of us that always were the guys doing the fillet work. Call me lazy, but I use a electric knife in the fish house, not filleting on a paddle or a little board swatting mosquitoes. So that ended.......my partner & I would get up a little earlier, get our 3-4 walleye in about 20min. go back and fillet them in the fish house, put them in a small cooler on ice. Meet for lunch.......here's our fish, I'll cut potatoes !!!!!! Most of the time we pull onto a nice point and have a sandwich, if fishing near camp we will go back and have our big meal for the day. Then fish until dark. I'll agree that everyone should experience the true shore lunch once. It's like going to Hawaii and not going to a Luau."
2356418,LOW1,2014-01-16 08:04:00,2828,"For a day or two each year I like to hire a guide who knows how to cook. It's the best way to do a shore lunch.I am usually up at first light and will take a kayak out before anyone else wakes up. My kids start waking up at 8. We then eat a big breakfast around 9 or 10, clean up and then go out for four or five hours and come back for happy hour with dinner around 7. Another evening kayak session, usually with an ultralight spinning outfit, is very common. Four or five hours of fishing is all what I want per day and some days it's not even that much.For me cooking a walleye dinner in the evening over a campfire with the kids swimming off the dock and no pressure to return to fishing is more fun."

My wife can't eat fish so if we do stop and start a fire it has to be hot dogs or smokies."
2353538,revitup,2014-01-15 09:14:00,140,"For us it's on the water by 6 at the latest. In for a nice breakfast. Then out again until our fish meal back at the cabin at 4 pm. Then right back out until dark. Light dinner and then play cards or go to bed. Fish meal is easier and faster by going short boat ride back to cabin, using propane. Most of us find we need a day or two to catch up on sleep after we get back. A relaxing trip, but not restful with that schedule. But I wouldn't do it any other way! Our fish meal is usually the same; fried fish, home made tartar sauce, potatoes, and dill pickles. That was the meal the group I started with over 30 years ago had and we haven't found the need to change it. Of course a few beers are had by most."
2354266,MrSimon,2014-01-15 12:41:00,922,"This is exactly what we do. We have instant oatmeal and pop tarts for breakfast and head out early. Fish till around 11 and head back to camp. We cook a big meal, sit around a fire, hike around, gather firewood, nap, re-spool, etc etc etc. Then we head back out around 2 or 3 and fish till dark ..... come back, plop down around the fire for an hour or two, drink a little, have a cigar ... then go to bed."
2354290,orchard frank,2014-01-15 13:06:00,1900,"To each their own. I went the last 13 years of our Canada trips, often 2 trips/year, with a full-blown shore lunch every day, unless it was raining and howling. I converted a hot 1 burner to run on 1# cylinders, easy to pack/unpack in the boat. Roll-up table, and a couple folding chairs, unless we were going to a picnic table somewhere on Lac Seul. We found that a break and re-charge never detracted from our fishing. Lost Island Lodge supplied a cooler with everything needed, breading, grease, etc., just add fish. After a few practice runs, start to finish may be 1- 1 1/2 hours at the most, less if in a hurry, but we were never in a hurry. Occasional short nap in a comfortable chair was not out of the question, or a few casts from shore. Can't imagine doing it any other way now, but was not always the case."
2354522,tv4fish,2014-01-15 14:35:00,2694,"AWWW - I gotta do it - my story about shore lunch(es). My group of 3 guys have been going to Lac Seul since 1985. Started out with a 1985 Bass Tracker V-17 Guide Special with a Merc Classic 50 (tiller). This boat had a LOT of open floor space so the big black garbage bag that held the Coleman stove, the Coleman fuel, the cast iron frying pan, the cooking oil, the flour, the salt, the pepper, the tongs, the plates, the silverware, the cutting board (I probably left out something), anyway - THAT bag was on the floor of the boat with us EVERY day. At around noon (EVERY day) we would find a nice island on which to do our shore lunch --YUM. We also would do walleye for dinner (or supper) whatever you want to call the evening meal ---- 'CAUSE we were in Canada and that's what you do.WELLL - we did that routine for quite a few years. One year, one of my buddies and I did a ""bonus"" trip - just the 2 of us. Same routine --- UNTIL, one day, probably the Friday of our week's stay -right after shore lunch - my buddy says ""I'm sick of eating all this walleye"" and proceeds to throw the frying pan, the salt, the pepper, and the flour....... right into the lake. No more shore lunch --- and we haven't done shore lunch since.And - NOOO, I'm NOT going to say where in Lac Seul............."
2354578,Downrigger,2014-01-15 14:49:00,60,"Yes to shore lunch with a twist. Have an on-board portable fish cleaning station. Have a Terrova trolling motor with GPS anchor capability. Boat is 19 ft. walk thru with room for collapsible(?) table and coleman stove and cooler. Catch fish, pull in to quite cove, anchor, clean fish, cook fish, enjoy, without leaving the boat. This year first time to try."

2355098,Downrigger,2014-01-15 17:09:00,60,"Hey, I agree. I have spent many days on the water, breaking for a sandwich then to keep fishing. Bacon is good. But I have also experienced a great fresh air shore lunch of bacon fired walleye, fried potatoes and onions, beans, followed by a desert of the day. It really is more than just the lunch. Really hard to beat if you have the time. I think everyone should experience once. Great memory."

2352234,Mich_Fisherman,2014-01-14 19:59:00,292,"IF you don't want to mess with the breading, potatoes, onions.....etc take Aluminum foil, lay the filets in the foil and cover with Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup. Cooks in about 15 minutes. Can cook on an open fire or a coleman stove. Sounds like sacrilege to do that to Walleye filets but it is very tasty. Had it with a guide at Pine Portage a while ago."

2352274,Pikeslayer8,2014-01-14 20:09:00,1460,"I agree, to each their own and I don't mean to disparage what your routine is. My apologies. I guess I am also very sensitive on this subject. On Wabakimi, we have just 1 main shore lunch rock spot where we have gone for close to 40 years. A lot has happened on that ole rock. Memories that I sure wouldn't trade for anything including a few extra minutes on the lake. I've caught my personal best pike off that ole rock. I've seen my Dad spread his best friends ashes on that ole rock. I've seen my boys strip down and retrieve snagged spoons and I've been checked by the MNR on that ole rock. Finally I've had my Dad's Memorial service on that ole rock. All I'm tryin to say is it's not a contest to see how much time on the lake itself. Slow down, have a beer or whatever and enjoy some of the best tasting fare on this side of heaven."
2352346,Pikeslayer8,2014-01-14 20:32:00,1460,"That's about what we do as well, once/trip, but we have walleye in some form every lunch. When I was younger, I had a hard time understanding this whole shore lunch thing. I would just fish off the rock while the the others did the work. I was only around 9-15 yrs old then and was just getting my first experiences with Canadian fishing. I would fish till I was hung up or fish was ready. then afterward everyone would just lay down and take a 15 minute catnap right there on the rock. Man, was I ever impatient with that. Took me a few years, but I get it now."

We always cook our fish back in camp.Too much time out of our day to do shorelunch anymore.Besides it's more relaxing back in camp frying fish with an ice cold Kokanee in hand.Bill"
2353226,Lovetofish,2014-01-15 07:34:00,458,Fry extra fish the night before. After it cools put it in a zip bag and put it in the fridge. But don't zip the bag closed. Take the fish and some bread and a jar of salsa with you fishing. Then make the sadwich and top with salsa when your ready for lunch. Another quick one is to boil brats in beer the night before and roast them over a fire on the beach.

Lunch is my main meal and I prefer to head back to the cabin for a hearty meal and relax/nap/attend to gear for a few hours before heading out for the balance of daylight. Lunch is the ""feast meal"" of the day. Breakfast is coffee, supper a sandwich and beer. Needless to say, I fish solo a lot or with my kids who were brought up on that schedule."

2351194,Carnhzkr,2014-01-14 15:38:00,964,"One of my favorite shore lunch meals is also one of the simplest. I heat up a can of Campbell's Chunky Chicken Noodle and pair it with a cheese sandwich. What could be easier? You might scoff, but I'll tell you what, heated over a Coleman burner on the granite banks of South Boundary Falls along the English River, you'd swear it was food for the gods prepared by a five-star chef. I'm always looking for new shore lunch ideas. I've never done the traditional Canadian shore lunch. It always sounds fun, and each trip I tell myself I'll give it a try, but I manage to talk myself out of it when I begin to realize how much effort, time, and planning it's going to take. So the walleye shore lunch plan turns into a walleye dinner plan. Typically, I'll do stuff like hotdogs, frozen pot of chili, soup/cheese sandwich, chili dogs, canned beef, that type of thing. Anyone else have a favorite hot lunch that's easy to heat up on a Coleman burner?"
2351298,phishfearme,2014-01-14 16:08:00,1242,we do almost exactly what you do for the same reasons. why waste valuable fishing time? eat a hearty breakfast and a good happy hour before dinner then head out for some evening fishing. now THAT'S a great day on the lake. phish

Walleye, bread, canned sliced potatoes and a few onions is all it takes. As for the time it takes to cook and clean up it really is all a matter of perspective. We enjoy margarita's, a few beers or whatever we have brought with us to pass the time and enjoy the down time and story telling that ensues. TonyO"
