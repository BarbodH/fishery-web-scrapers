2367681,Mike Borger,2014-01-20 12:34:00,1554,"My personal opinion is on a really good productive body of water the fish will always bite. Cold fronts, pressure change, moon phases, wind direction....it's all moot, those are just tag words for excuses. If the fish are there in abundance you'll always find plenty of willing biters.However on hard hit cottage lakes, it's a much different story. My lake in QC is a prime example. It's always a super tough bite for 2-3 days after a cold front. Only way I catch them is by fishing deeper and slower with ultra finesse live bait rigs."
2352762,btmbncr,2014-01-14 23:39:00,492,"Last summer during the month we were on Lac Seul we had several cold fronts come through.I found that if there wasn't any lightning with the rain or storm the fish just slid off a little deeper on the structures.If there was lightning it seemed to scatter the fish.Without the lightning we just had to fish more ""spots"" and seemed to do OK. I was curious about others experience with cold fronts.Bill"
2355314,new hips,2014-01-15 18:47:00,498,"I've been on fly in lakes........once in early June. It was a drastic 70deg. to 40 deg....temp. change, we had trouble scraping out a meal fishing most of the day. One year a minor front moved tru with very little rain (sprinkles).....shut em down for a couple of hours. I agree with lightning, they tend to scatter. I think one of the biggest factors is wind."
2355362,wallydave,2014-01-15 19:11:00,2151,"After fishing early June on the NW end of Lac Seul, I can say we have seen plenty of fronts moving thru Ontario! Last June one morning while anchored at the Wenassga Rapids, the wind moved the boat almost a complete 360! Needles to say I headed back to Goose Bay Camp, we went to Ear Falls for lunch. By the time we sat down, the front moved thru and wind and rain pounded the area! The bite slowed down until the wind changed again! The lesson, watch the weather, it will change!"
2355818,btmbncr,2014-01-15 22:44:00,492,"On our trip to Lac Seul last year if the weather was stable the fish seemed to be in 20 to 24 feet of water.Post frontal conditions the fish were in 26 to 32 feet of water on the same structures.We did find fish that were suspended in 26 to 32 feet of water that were off the structure.These fish were shutdown until they drifted/swam back to structure.At first the bite was slow but as conditions stabilized it was again on like ""Donkey Kong""!!! The Lindners, Al and James,years ago said most fisherman fish""spots"" not fish.They said learn to use your electronics,if you don't see fish,don't fish.With side imaging/down imaging and the recent upgrades in electronics I have learned,for me,that is true.Especially in mid July and August(that's why I go then) Bill AkA Backtroller Billy"
2355890,Pooch,2014-01-16 03:53:00,4619,"It seems to me that there is always a ""front"" coming or going in Canada. I think it effects the fish less than it does us fishermen. Could be our mindset or conditioned response to a change in weather / barometric pressure.There have been so many overnight storms while we were in camp that I would be certain that fishing was going to be tough, but once on the water fishing was fine. The fish had moved, but with some effort and change on our part fishing was still decent.Last falls LS trip was a good example. Nasty storm overnight. Wind, lightning and very cold when we got up. Cold and windy enough that we never left the cabin till late morning. Seemed like a ""classic cold front"" situation. When we finally steeled ourselves enough to get out of the cabin we found the fishing to be fantastic. We were bundled up like the middle of winter, but the walleye were on a terror bite. By far the best day of the trip.Then again, there's been days after a sudden change of weather when we had hotdogs for supper.Pooch"
2356274,phishfearme,2014-01-16 07:26:00,1242,"I think pooch is right on the money - cold fronts impact people much more than fish. just like wallydave said - a cold front came thru and ""they headed back to camp"" - well fishing sucks in the cabin - no matter what the weather. wind/chop and light penetration all affect fish but these are associated with ANY type of front or even stable weather. just how can a large air temperature change (or air pressure change) affect fish? especially deeper fish. when your hands and body get cold you just don't fish as well - so fishing gets worse. if that's what everyone means by a cold front impacting fishing then I agree - but it's not from air temperature change. phish"
2356906,Mike Kansas,2014-01-16 10:22:00,1463,During a cold front I normally spend my time jig fishing very slow. If that fails a couple sticks of dynamite over the side works well too.
2356954,Tylumps,2014-01-16 10:37:00,73,"Hello, Been fishing Canada for more than 30 years and I can tell you with some certainty that cold fronts effect fishing in late May and early June. Once the water warms and the lakes stratify, the walleye in particular are less effected by the cold fronts. When the thermocline starts to settle around 20 to 25 feet, the fish are less impacted by the outside elements but more by the location of the feed. Since the feed, shad for example, are attracted to the food found in the thermocline, then the walleye's will be there most of the day. I would take it a bit further to say that the ""feed"" is impacted by the elements rather than the walleye in the early part of the season. What happens, in my opinion, is that the cold front removes the warmth of the water that attracts the feed. Once the cold front passes, the sun and the waves condense warmer water to the shoreline making the windblown points active walleye locations due to the ""feed"" congregating in the concentration of warmer water. My two cents anyway."
2360314,tv4fish,2014-01-17 12:13:00,2694,"Mike: I have to use ""that line"" often myself -- if my 2 buddies go more then 10 minutes without catching a walleye -they always start complaining -- ""We're not catching anything in this spot"" -- it's at that point I say ""Are you just going to complain or FISH"" .......(that's when I hand them a stick of dynamite)................."
