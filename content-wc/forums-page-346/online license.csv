2370489,BreezyPoint,2014-01-21 09:51:00,1581,"Yes, it is required. I keep mine in my wallet."
2370737,polaris-pete,2014-01-21 11:01:00,343,"I called the MNR and they said it is NOT required to carry it on person, but you can if wanted. The Outdoors card Number is printed on the License if you get it online. Guess its your choice."
2370761,phishfearme,2014-01-21 11:03:00,1242,"do you know this for sure? since you can't get a license without having the card, it seems redundant to carry the card. phish ok - I see pete provided the correct answer while I was typing in my question - thanks pete!"
2370777,JDP,2014-01-21 11:09:00,1457,"This is not what I experienced.I had a OMNR Officier check my boat a couple years ago.My buddy did not have his license.The OMNR Officer gave him a ""break"", he said to fax a copy later that day.As ""luck"" would have it, the same Officer was in our resort later that day checking everybody for licenses and fish. My buddy showed him his license...problem solved.From the 2014 Ontario Regulations:You must carry your Outdoors Card/Temporary Outdoors Card and fishing licence tag with you whenever you are fishing. If a Conservation Officer asks to see your Outdoors Card, the law states you must show it. See Page 5 near the top of right hand column:http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodcons...ent/198219.pdfI plan to carry my Ontario Fishing License and Outdoors Card, and ask that all in my boat do so as well."
2370793,Bill Krejca,2014-01-21 11:12:00,6107,"Speaking of redundant, it makes more sense to just add the cost of the card to the license and do away with the card. Another case of the government at work. Bill"
2370977,wallydave,2014-01-21 12:28:00,2151,"I carry mine with me and my online license. After all when I showed my wife, she shook her head and said"" now your a card carry hoser!"""
2371281,polaris-pete,2014-01-21 14:04:00,343,JDP- Thank you for the Clarification of this in writng right out of the MNR Booklet.I will carry mine now and guess I should have saved my time calling to ask them anything else again. I guess its whom ever answers the phone and their interpretation of your question. Something else to carry around now!
2360026,bluegussler,2014-01-17 10:15:00,124,"Last year I bought Ontario fishing license online and printed out on my 8x10 paper.It printed the whole page which is very clumsy to carry around. I asked a local warden if I could shrink it to a smaller paper, and his reply was that any alterations to the doc would be a violation. He also told me I could not laminate it. Any ideas to get a smaller copy?"
2360042,camp chef,2014-01-17 10:30:00,915,fold it in half.
2360930,Obabikon,2014-01-17 15:54:00,2370,Get it from an issuer on your way up.
2361026,SinOrSwim,2014-01-17 16:22:00,1528,And then in half again. I put mine in my tackle box so I know it's always with me in the boat.
2361186,NWwalleye,2014-01-17 17:07:00,223,Simple but effective ..
2368937,DJA,2014-01-20 18:34:00,150,"This is what I do I buy some nice looking specialty paper and print 4-5 copies put one in the tackle box, one in the wallet, one in the glove compartment one on file and maybe one in the boat. It is hard to lose them all and easy to find one"
2370073,camp chef,2014-01-21 07:51:00,915,X2 except for the nice looking specialty paper.

2370417,polaris-pete,2014-01-21 09:27:00,343,"I just got my 2014 Ontario License online last night. Had a little problem printing it out but my Wife saved me! What I do with mine is like others, I made 4 copies and folded them down to each seperately fit into a zippered sandwich bag.They stay dry and put one copy in different places when on a trip or home. The Original I did the same but put it into one of my Hunting Backtag holders with the large pin on it. I can attach it then to anywheres."
2370481,LOW1,2014-01-21 09:48:00,2828,"Is it required to have an outdoor card (that credit card sized plastic card) in your possession in addition to the license? I had thought that it was. If so, those who make multiple copies of the license may want to also have an arrangement where they keep their outdoor card in their possession.I could be very wrong on this so if anyone knows the answer please chime in."
