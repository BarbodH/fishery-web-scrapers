The food is great and you pick off the menu every night no set menu. I seem to gain weight every year I go there. It is about as good as it can get as far as I am concerned. The owner is top notch, the fellow fishermen I have met have been great and the cabins are clean and comfortable, they even built a new cabin over the winter."
