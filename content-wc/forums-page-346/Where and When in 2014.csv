Good luck to all my fellow fishermen & enjoy your time in the wilderness."
2303129,Tylumps,2013-12-28 12:57:00,73,"Mid July. Had a great time last year and looking forward to 2014. 2013 was supposed to be our last blast on a fly in due to the cost. Many of the old timers skipped 2013 because of the cost. When we reported back how much fun we had, the old timers made us book 2014. No problem for me, a week in the bush is as good as it gets. Even my electronic addict 10 and 11 year old boys can't wait to go back. They learned Euchre, Michigan Rummy, Solitaire and Poker along with some days just driving the boat for no other reason but to explore. Happy New Year"
