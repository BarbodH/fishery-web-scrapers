We ended up going to Camp Narrows, but I sure liked how Stokes sounded remote. From what I could tell by their website, the cabins looked a bit rustic, so figured they wouldn't be up to my wife's standards."

They do have a shower shed that can be used once the water is pumped in and heated.Dan said they have some women that come year after year,but I think most of the guests are guys looking for a rustic experience. Feel free to pm me if you have any other questions."
