2350666,Mike Kansas,2014-01-14 13:12:00,1463,A friend of mine emailed me and asked about what lake maps I like. Thought I might pass it on to all. Check out Trak Maps. I like the chart section because it has good detail. Any other suggestions? Mike Kansas
2351098,fishguide1800,2014-01-14 15:02:00,84,Is that detail on our Canadian lakes or just some of the us ones.I have using a canada chip for 6 years and find it alright.could be better and maybe there's newer ones.don't even really need anymore on the lakes I fish on.

2353266,Mike Kansas,2014-01-15 07:44:00,1463,They have maps on a lot ofCanadian lakes and I'm not sure but I bet a lot of US lakes too.
2353282,Mike Kansas,2014-01-15 07:46:00,1463,You won't be sorry Bill. Heck I bet you even catch a few more fish because of them. Mike Kansas
