2350394,cowboyd,2014-01-14 11:24:00,33,Hi I am looking for any current information on the general camp and over all fishing for this lodge. I met them at the All Canada show and they seemed not only like nice guys but ones that had a clue how to run a fishing camp.My two biggest concerns are the size of the camp/number of guests to deal with early June and secondly how much fishing pressure this are gets. I understand the size of the fishery but I should also explain for twenty plus years we have done mostly fly ins spring and fall. Yes I am spoiled but I am also getting older darn it!.T.I.A. for any inputCowboyd

It is 10 miles to Minnitaki from either camp. The Arm is well protected unless the winds are due west or east. I thought the fishing was good.
2351386,zeebee,2014-01-14 16:31:00,1144,"Firstly, dont expect it to compare with a quality fly-in.....few drive to's can. In June all the camps in the area are full but its a big body of water and I doubt you will feel crowded. The fishing is good for a drive to and you will likely have some exceptional days. The Minnitaki system offers lakers and good NP and smallie fishing. Perch too if you are into that. I do primarily fly-ins as well but every few years find myself in the area of Minnitaki, adjust my expectations accordingly and have a good time.Lac Seul which is in the general area is a better overall fishery for sheer #'s.By the way, never too old for a fly-in... I know some fly-in lakes where ashes are scattered...that's too old."
2352626,btmbncr,2014-01-14 22:21:00,492,I can't speak for the fishing but I met the Donnelly's last year and they were the real deal.Super nice people.Bill
2353946,Guest,2014-01-15 11:06:00,0,I also have stayed next door at PAC. This will be my 28th year fishing the arm and Minnitaki . Have heard nothing but good things about Donnelly's and the people . The arm is so so for fishing. Largest Walleye from the arm last year was 29 in. and smallie was 21 in. nice fish anywhere. You can find fish on the arm but not always in great numbers. We catch nice fish right off our dock. We bring our own boats so we travel 20 to 45 min. to fish. I have never fished Lac suel but from what I read I might be missing something . We love it on the arm and traveling is not a problem. We seem to have two Fantastic days two good days and two average days for numbers every year. Remember every day in Canada fishing is Fantastic !

We really like the staff and the other guests we meet. The camp will most likely be full in June but that's only 10 cabins and a handful of trailer sites. The lake is very large and even on the most popular spots, there's lots of room. I've never felt crowded while I was fishing and never not been able to troll or drift a location if I've felt like it. Plus, there's always another location within a couple minutes where there will not be anyone else. There's lots of spots to fish within sight of the camp if the wind or weather is a concern, or you can drive for as long as you want to (literally, it's indirectly connected to Lac Seul) if you are feeling adventurous. It's not a ""Fly-In"" but it's still great fishing."
