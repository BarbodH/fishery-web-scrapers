2378649,gordy28,2014-01-23 17:54:00,437,"We are relative newbies with fishing trips to lodges To date we have done 2 very ery different trips boat in and a drive in. The only constant was American plan meals (with a remote paddle camping trip last summer for good measure ) This year we are doing our first remote fly in trip. We hope to keep the trend going for a while - different styles, locations but at somepoint I could see us saying ""this is the place"" but I think we are quite a few trips away from that. Funny thing though I'd go back and do the first ones again if pressed"
2369241,Glenman12,2014-01-20 20:32:00,762,Same lake and camp for 31 years but about 20 years ago we decided to go somewhere else..it was a disaster...
2369321,Basser,2014-01-20 20:59:00,31,"Great Thread - but come on guys, is anyone willing to share the great camp/lake you have decided to be your every year trip? Tylump,, Glenman, Zeebee, Blades, Mud are you wiiling to share? Please post or PM me - we are always looking for new places to try, even though we do have a few favorites we have been to multiple times, and of course are willing to share. Steve"
2369329,phishfearme,2014-01-20 20:59:00,1242,"there's an old adage in biology - 90% of the fish live in 10% of the lake/ocean. one of these key places in Canadian lakes are where rivers or flowage comes into the lake - also the exit. the key is flowage. well, our first trip to a fly in lodge found most of the dozen or so boats from the lodge fishing right next to us fishing the flowage. from then on we've been going to private, single cabin ""rent a lake"" flyins. these are typically smaller lakes and you get to know it REAL well after one of our 10 day ""weeks"". as a result, we tend to go to different lakes each year, repeating every so often when we find a huge lake or one with many portage options (we did Bow Lake 4 trips with North of 51). so, to me, if the lake is big enough to keep you happy and your ""privacy"" desires are met then there's not a lot of reason to change. but for us, we swap to a different lake almost every year. phisih"
2369441,MrSimon,2014-01-20 21:31:00,922,Two years ago we found the perfect spot. Boat-in outpost cabin on huge lake filled with walleye .... plus two portage lakes teaming with huge smallies and pike. The outpost was situated on a beautiful point with a million dollar view. Heaven on earth. We booked somewhere else for the next trip. We just like to try new things.
2369521,oger,2014-01-20 22:29:00,46,"I have a unique privilege. When my grandfather was to old to make Canadian trips I received his membership to a club that has 6 cabins on 4 lakes north if Ignace. Good fishing. Variety of fish, eyes, pike, smallies, trout. I made my first trip when I was around 8. Many great memories. Very reasonable cost per person. Under $600 per person for 7 days all costs included. But use our own motors on club boats. Some lakes are more secluded than others. Some drive in. Some boat in. One fly in. Makes great variety. The fly in camp is obviously more. But feel very privileged each year pulling into camp. Just frosting on the cake when I get to stay in one of the 2 cabins grandpa built back in the day."
2373209,515,2014-01-22 07:34:00,254,Like the adventure of new water each year so something new for us all the time
2373665,Bigstorm,2014-01-22 10:56:00,799,"We've been going to the same place for 10yrs now. Its on the English River system so we can go 20mi crossing 7 or more lakes so we can move anywhere at anytime on that system. One thing we started doing was making it a point to find 1 new productive spot eac trip we make. There is so much water that is uncharted, who knows how many spots we drive over or pass along side without knowing."
2376241,Jigger1,2014-01-23 07:59:00,234,"My folks tried different places when I was younger, as an adult when I decided to go back to Canada I did my homework, selected a lodge and have been back since. This will be my 15th year and don't see this changing any time soon. When you find the right home away from home for your fishing trip, it's hard to leave. Very seldom do I find myself bored fishing the same water, conversely I usually get jacked up because I now know the potential of the spots we fish and each year I keep learning more. My anticipation for each trip has also not diminished, each trip (now twice a year) is still like the first."
2377681,drlee,2014-01-23 14:05:00,409,"Tough but interesting question! I have fished Canada for about 25 years and have fished about that many different lakes. A few years back, I narrowed my trips to two lakes. One lake is 10,000 acres, the other is 20,000 acres. There are no private cabins on either system. There is one small camp on the smaller lake and there are two small camps on the larger lake. Both are drive in but very remote. There are no towns within a 2 hour drive from either camp. The camps are well run, have comfortable cabins, and the owners are very nice people. I have my own boat. At this point, I will likely continue to fish the two lakes I have become familiar with. Both are excellent walleye/northern lakes. I really enjoy seeing some of the same people year after year during our weeks. I seem to find some new to me spots on these lakes each year. All that being said, who knows...maybe I will get the itch and try a new lake in addition to the 4 weeks I spend on the two mentioned above."
2377841,MrSimon,2014-01-23 14:32:00,922,"Although I like fishing new waters ..... there is something appealing about learning all the ins and outs of one particular body of water. I definitely catch more fish on repeat visits to a lake. In a perfect world, I'd have a go-to place that I visit for a week every year, and then take a second trip each year to a new destination. New place in the Spring, and old standby in the Fall would be my dream."
2367769,packpro,2014-01-20 13:00:00,695,"We have a large group, but camp selection becomes a big issue every year. We usually stay at a great camp with a great owner and catch all the fish we need too. Still seems like every year we get a split vote with half wanting to return to same location while others want the adventure of a new camp. We have even split up. When you compare notes everyone has a good trip and loves their choice. Everyone caught fish. Everyone had a good experience, but everyone had one thing they would like to change. More fish, bigger fish, better boats, better owner, etc. Again, in spite of the small stuff a great trip for each group. Funny thing is the guys who vote for same camp one year opt for new camp the next. Tough to figure the psychology on this. So a little informal poll. Do you go to the same camp every year, or do you try to hit different ones in search of that over the top, or just new experience....... and why?"
2367825,revitup,2014-01-20 13:18:00,140,We try to figure out a place that we will be happy with year after year. We do not like to have to search for a new camp with proper accommodations for a somewhat difficult size group (8-14). Therefore we make a commitment for the same cabin the same week by the time our week is finished and then get our deposit in when due.
2367929,zeebee,2014-01-20 14:00:00,1144,"In my ""younger"" days I would seek a new fly-in just about every year. Finally found what for me is an ideal lake and I am returning year after year with little desire to seek out a new camp. Contributing to me decision (in no specific order) to do repeat visits are the following: 1) the lake is large and offers plenty of new opportunities to fish new areas. It would take me 25+ years to hit every bay/point; 2) multi species fishing....can fish for trophy 'eyes, NP's or lakers; 3) outstanding fishing; 4) great accommodations. Many of my initial fly-ins were to smaller one cabin lakes and after the first couple days you kinda have em figured out. Too routine after that. The big lakes offer far more variety.Since I do the trips solo or, pay for my sons, I rarely need to concede a loss of argument. In any event, maybe your group needs to try a large lake, assuming you haven't already, that offers a bit of something for everyone. A good large lake is a bit like bunching together a lot of small lakes only better."
2368057,Blades-n-Beads,2014-01-20 14:52:00,484,"Same group goes to same place each year, kinda the same deal as yours. One thing we did years back was for the adventurous guys that wanted a taste of differant was planned a remote drive to with no accommodations , rough it for 3-6 days, by chance we found a walleye candy store. We still return every year with the same adven guys that wanted the change, we still do the big group trip with all the same guys, seems there's a lot less people suggesting a change of scenery now. The ones that wanted the change have there belly full on the remote trip witch is the 1st one of the year. It's all good, everyone happy now."
2368185,Mike Borger,2014-01-20 15:10:00,1554,I love fishing new water. Too many places to try and not enough time...
2368345,jdoaks,2014-01-20 15:57:00,89,we go same place every year the lake has so much area well never fish it all.we take a day every year just to check new areas. makes it fun.
2368729,Pikeslayer8,2014-01-20 17:30:00,1460,"I started on Wapikimanski July of 1971, 3 years, then on to Glitter for a couple years, next, we went to Birch, (Dan Gable trip). The following year we went to Wabakimi where we have been since. We knew right away that this lake shall become home away from home. Back then, the camp was very rustic. The cabin is built from the logs where it was cleared. back in the sixty's by legendary figure Ted Davis. Over the years, we have seen the cabin expanded and a new deck and boardwalk (which is probably 25 years old now) then came running water and solar lights and shower. The lake itself is big enough that each trip you leave feeling like you woulda liked to have more opportunity to explore or fish such and such. The lake is small enough that developing the fish patterns is done easily enough and you don't waste much time getting on the walleye. There are no plans to change, ever!"
2368793,btmbncr,2014-01-20 17:42:00,492,Find a quality fishery and learn it.That has been our plan.It has worked out good for us.Bill
2368801,Tylumps,2014-01-20 17:51:00,73,"I'm 47 and I have been going to Canada since I was 8. I have always been the youngest when we go and my Uncles and Father have always wanted to stay at the same place. The lake we go to has changed hands a few times, and the current outfitter is by far the best of the bunch. When the costs for fly-in's got to be over $900 for the week the older crowd let me pick a boat-in. We had a good time and caught fish, but after 3 years the elders wanted to make fly-ins again. The bottom line is the group wanted to go back to the same lake as before. If you got the outfitter, the fish and the wildlife...why change."
2369201,mudpusher,2014-01-20 20:15:00,248,"Same lake, same outfitter. This will be 19 years for me. The lake is big enough to try new things and places. Not crowded is an understatement. Nice cabins."
