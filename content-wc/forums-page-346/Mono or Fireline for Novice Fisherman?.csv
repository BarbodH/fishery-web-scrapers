2376601,Larry S,2014-01-23 08:59:00,665,"Thanks everyone for your input. Will spool up with 8lb Trilene XL for my sister. I still will use fireline myself as I have been using it for a long time and love its no-stretch, smaller diameter qualities for my my fishing needs"
2376745,97roughneck,2014-01-23 09:30:00,899,"I was taught to fish using fireline, it's all I know and all I use. Tie palomar knots, no problem. I guess I don't know what I'm missing? Ignorance is bliss."
2377929,MrSimon,2014-01-23 14:53:00,922,"I use two rods in Canada. First rod spooled with 14lb good quality braid and a snap swivel on the end. I use this for casting, trolling, or dragging bottom bouncers. The snap swivel allows for fast and easy lure changes. I re-tie the swivel and remove 24"" of line once per day - braid tends to fray and break if you are dragging it through rocks. Second rod has 8lb flouro on it for jigging. I find this covers all of my fishing scenarios and cuts way down on the amount of knots I have to tie during the day. Heck, some days I don't tie a single knot. If I could only have one rod, well, I wouldn't. There is no reason to only take one rod in a boat. Especially with a new person who might not be too good at tying knots. Being able to just pick up the other rod is soooo much better. I've seen a lot of new guy just sitting in the boat doing nothing because they don't feel like switching lures."
2378145,fishguide1800,2014-01-23 15:45:00,84,"Theres nothing like braid.dont understand why you guts find it hard to tie.doublevitvup, put it through the jig and bring the loop over and pull tight.cant get any simpler.braid doesn't twist like mono either.I double uni knot my flouracarbon to my braid eliminating a swivel.do the same with my muskie lines.its newer technology just get on it right away and there wont be any problems.with the proper rod you wont pull any hooks from the fish."
2379473,roscoe33,2014-01-24 00:22:00,653,"Sorry, but I think Trilene XL may be the wrong choice. XL ( extra limp) is a tangling nightmare. But IF she pays attention, it might be ok. Use Stren original, or Stren Micro-thin if you must go with a mono. Personally, I would use Fireline, or the new Berkeley Nanofil, which is like a refined, smooth, fire line."
2379665,Skywagon,2014-01-24 05:44:00,1106,"I am with fishguide, braid is my line of choice, easy enough to tie, with none of the usual mono line problems."
2380537,Jack77,2014-01-24 09:47:00,168,The palomar knot is one of the easiest knots that I have ever used and is the recommended knots for braid. There might many pros and cons to braid but knot tying shouldn't be one of them.
2381665,Larry S,2014-01-24 15:36:00,665,"Have never had any trouble with Trielene XL, used it all the time before switching to fireline. Had trouble with Stren in past, prefer Trielene."
2381705,ricorth07,2014-01-24 15:46:00,1143,"I've never broke a line or knot resulting in fish or lure loss with braid, a bent hook or two, nor have had birds nests like with mono... on the other hand, fish catch ratio seems higher with mono... quite a quandary, but I'd still go braid for a novice.Sent from my HTC-PG762 using Tapatalk 2"
2382049,123chadder,2014-01-24 17:16:00,429,"i doubkle uni knot my leaders as well...but dont you have trouble twisting the braid?its a ***** to me,even the polomar knot you have to kink the braid to fit in the eye,thats a ***** too."
2315497,Larry S,2014-01-02 15:16:00,665,"After hearing all my reports about fly-in fishing trips my sister is finally going on one with me in late June. She went to Canada in the early 80's on drive in trips, but hasn't fished much in the last 15 yrs. I'm bringing all the tackle for her. What type of line, Mono or Fireline should I spool on her spinning rods? We will do the vast majority of fishing jigging,and a little trolling with spinners and plugs. What are the opinions of all my Friends on Walleye Central . Larry S"
2315513,epiepenburg,2014-01-02 15:19:00,365,"I would go mono, little more forgiving."
2315521,billy weaver,2014-01-02 15:26:00,470,I've used fresh 8 lb. test mono for years with good results. No knock on the other stuff.
2316465,1jigfish2,2014-01-02 21:39:00,110,"I agree totally with the others. Mono is much more forgiving. Lots of people pull the hooks right out of the fishes mouth, when using fire line or a similar product. I still use 8lb. Mono, with a 6 lb. leader. The two are connected with a swivel, to prevent line twist. It works well."
2316498,btmbncr,2014-01-03 00:03:00,492,Personally the mono would be a better choice ie twist and tangles.Braids are a pain to deal with when tangled.Bill
2316665,wallydave,2014-01-03 06:58:00,2151,"Mono is easier to tie, plus fireline can cut your fingers, not a good thing for a first time experiance. If you have to break off a jig, you don't loose as much line."
2316785,BornToFish,2014-01-03 07:43:00,1224,"I fish for six or so weeks in NW Ontario each season. Much of this time is devoted to fishing walleyes. A fair amount of my fishing is in August and September, when vertical jigging is a particularly effective approach. I tried Fireline many years ago, shortly after it was introduced, thinking it might offer me an advantage over monofilament. I couldn't get it off my reel fast enough. I found that the jig would ""hang up"" on its way to the bottom of the lake, after I opened the reel's bail. The jig would proceed downwards in the water column and then stop, causing me to think that it reached the bottom of the lake. I would jig for a short while and realize the jig was still in the middle of the water column. I admit that I do use fairly lightweight jigs - mostly 1/16 and sometimes 1/8 ounce. Maybe this ""hanging up"" problem wouldn't be a problem with heavier jigs which I very rarely use. I have listened to folks state the supreme sensitivity of Fireline type fishing lines offers them supreme sensitivity. They can more easily feel the bite. I note that at the same time, the fish can more easily detect the presence of the angler. I believe that it works both ways. I now use six pound monofilament - mostly Trilene and sometimes Stren. I use a small Spro swivel at the end of the fishing line, with a six pound fluorocarbon leader (ca. eighteen inches in length) from the swivel to the jig. This eliminates line twist. This setup is all that I need or want. It simply works. Good luck in your fishing - make some great memories!"
2316857,Guest,2014-01-03 08:25:00,0,"I use fireline or braid almost exclusively. Usually 10 pound test with a fluorocarbon leader. I rarely have a problem with windknots or tangling. I do a lot of trolling, and when a fish hits, he's on. Very little stretch. To compensate, I use a quality 7 foot rod with a medium-light action. I jig with the same fireline or braid and this is another reason I like braid. As many will state, braid is supersensitive. I've had times that I don't like to admit to with mono, when a large aggressive walleye will clamp down on a jig and because of the stretch of mono he's gone on the first good head shake. It's my fault but I feel braid lessens the chance of the hook not penetrating. My two cents."
2316905,Larry Mac,2014-01-03 08:34:00,530,"Hi Larry S, for your sister, I will agree with mono for all the above reasons given. I have brought new guys and girls up many times and always recommend Mono. Like stated it is very forgiving (especially for snags), easy to tie, and works great. Have a great tripThank you,Larry Mac"
2375081,123chadder,2014-01-22 18:51:00,429,"key is the stretch...especially for ice fishing deeper water.and braid is a ***** to tie,i use 6 pound fireline with an 8 pound flouro leader,but once the leader breaks im using another rod cause it just takes too long to tie jigs on..."
