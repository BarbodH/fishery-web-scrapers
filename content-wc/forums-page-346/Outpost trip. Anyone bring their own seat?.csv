2373305,polaris-pete,2014-01-22 08:05:00,343,Mike- How about RIBES? Seats or NO?
2373337,515,2014-01-22 08:14:00,254,I figure if my crew of 6 is dropping over $6000 for a fly in they better well have seats. If not we can always find another that does.
2373593,Mike Borger,2014-01-22 10:31:00,1554,Yep!
2372025,gordy28,2014-01-21 17:38:00,437,"Like most our group is pumped about our first outpost trip Boats in camps do not have seats with a back. Thinking a week of hard fishing will be hard on the back outfitter recommended we bring chairs with us Has anyone done this? If so. Is there a type, brand u would recommend? Cheers Gordy"
2372105,Mike Borger,2014-01-21 17:51:00,1554,"Pretty surprised WRA doesn't have swivel seats on their boats especially at one of their deluxe camps Gordy, wow!Wouldn't dream of putting an actual chair in an aluminum boat. (if that is indeed what you meant). Last spring on the Attawapiskat was the first time ever I've ever done that, but we were in 20' wide, flat bottomed freighter canoes and the deck chairs worked perfectly in them. Even the legs fit perfectly in between the ribs in the bottom of the boat so they didn't slide around.I'd buy some cheapie plastic clamp-on boat seats for your trip if you're positive the boats don't have them."
2372489,gordy28,2014-01-21 19:30:00,437,"Hey Mike, The boats do have them but the outfitter said they have a hard time keeping them in shape I think the outfitter meant if u really want one then safer to bring your own in case I meant your second option re a canoe seat? A cheap boat seat without mounting"
2372497,Mike Borger,2014-01-21 19:41:00,1554,"I think you'll be okay, don't overthink things. The boats will have seats.If you're really worried I use one of these in my canoe at times. Attaches with straps and buckles, works great.http://www.mec.ca/product/5008-742/s...q=canoe%2BseatIf we have the chance to meet up before you go you can borrow mine."
2372617,retire55,2014-01-21 20:34:00,1029,"I'm unaware of whether your requirement is for a fly-in. For a drive-in or boat-in, I've used a seat similar to Cabela's item number IK-022185. I added a swivel base to mine and I've used my boat seat for over 10 years."
2372649,wallydave,2014-01-21 20:41:00,2151,"If your flying in the weight of the seat will be something to consider. Otherwise a boat or drive in the only thing you have to worry about is space. Check with your outfitter, they will be able to tell you about the boats, seats and cabin."
2372921,Pooch,2014-01-22 03:12:00,4619,"I've seen guys who do flyins take a seat and leave it in camp for next year. Appears that only works out well if you go back again!I've also seen others ""borrow"" one of the ""left in camp for my use seats"" and the owner returns to find it is in lesser condition than when he left.I think it is the camp owners job to provide at least the minimum of a plastic seat and swivel base. And... Just as important, it's the guests responsibility to not destroy them! I wonder how many camp owners are nodding their heads at that statement.Pooch"
2372953,btmbncr,2014-01-22 03:28:00,492,"If you can take one in and it doesn't make you over the weight limit I would do it in a heartbeat.I'd fly it back out again with me.I wouldn't want some else's ""Northern Ju Ju"" to mess up my trip.Bill aka Backtroller Billy"

2373265,gordy28,2014-01-22 08:02:00,437,Hey everyoneThank for the tips!Mike is correct we are flying in w WRA - and the boats should have seats - outfitter just wasnt confident of the shape they will be inWe are probably guilty of oever planning at this point - based on enthusiam! Anyway - few guys are looking at canoe seats anyway - so may just have as back up - and outfitter has been great - if we do bring seats - no impact on our weight limitsA
