Stayed there a few years ago and the guy who was running it, was wanting to sell because of his age, and none of his kids wanted to take over. Nice cabins but camp was starting to get run down. Any one know who is now running the camp, or what happened to the previous owner? Thanks, Dean"

1492183,v-bay gord,2012-10-02 12:43:00,3168,That's news to me. Most fishing guides I know wouldn't have the $$ to consider such a move. Both those camps would be a big investment. I would consider it a rumour until proven otherwise.
1492349,tackleman,2012-10-02 20:20:00,444,i heard it from a buddy of mine from calgary (vbay gord knows who) and he told me that what is circulating in the west arm area is a fellow from the oil patch in Alberta has bought it and he was going to target his fellow oil patch workers as his cliental

Camp is looking good and the NEW equipment was a great. Looking forward to many more years on Eagle and enjoying eagle west resort. Thanks Trevor!"

2367345,NWwalleye,2014-01-20 10:30:00,223,I confirm... His brother Tony told me this a couple of weeks ago ....Great news Scott ... All the best in your NEW adventure ...You are a great guy and will be an awesome Lodge owner ..
2367353,v-bay gord,2014-01-20 10:31:00,3168,"Kwags, it's been a busy year and a half. Julian, formerly at North Shore Lodge, purchasing Andy Meyers, and Scott Jaeger, formerly at AML, purchasing North Shore Lodge. Like I said, it's a rumor until proven otherwise. Scott is a great guy, and I have many fond memories of working my early years at North Shore Lodge. Scott and NSL is a good combination, I wish him well."
