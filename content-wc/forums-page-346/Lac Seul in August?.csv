This year because of some scheduling issues we will be going up the east side of the lake in August, actually the week of August 18th. In the 2nd week of July we have no problem finding walleyes from 10 to 15 ft on windy shorelines or in 21 feet off the end of points or sides of reefs. My question to the guys and gals that fish the lake in August is, what depth do you usually find the fish on the middle of August? Are they a lot deeper than 21 feet or are they still in those depths? Thanks in advance for any thoughts. Roger"

In this area and at that time of the year, e find the fish in 20 feet of water or less. When we used to fish the eastern portion of lac Seul out of the Sioux Lookout area - and at the same time of the year - we would fish as deep as 40 to 45 feet!"
2383897,Jigger1,2014-01-25 13:04:00,234,"We fish late June/early July for our 1st trip and most of our time is spent in water less than 20' with the occasional search in deeper water as walleyes are transitioning to summer haunts and the big girls are usually the first to show up. Our second trip is in late August/early September and most of our time is spent in water over 20' with much of it closer to 30'. We rarely go deeper so as not to stress the eyes and make sure the big girls safely make it back. Last year we spent a lot of time in 16-24' and caught both volume and size, but both of my 29's came from 30."
