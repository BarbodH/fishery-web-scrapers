2364522,wallydave,2014-01-19 09:59:00,2151,"This is a good place for your research, try the search function. Google Ontario outpost fishing too. Now for the details, what kind of fishing are you looking for, do you have a price range? Are you looking for rustic, or all or some bells and whistles? Good luck!"

2364762,pale ryder,2014-01-19 12:01:00,1937,I've been staying at Clarke's on the Indian chain and Cedar for many years.And I highly recommend them.
2364858,pjshorthorn,2014-01-19 12:22:00,5654,"I contacted ""The Patricia Region - Canada's Heartland"" office in Dryden years ago to get some info. on NW Ontario lakes and outfitters. They sent me a great map with all the lodges and outfitters on it from Red Lake south to Vermillion Bay, east to Ignace and north from there to Pickle Lake. There has to be at least 100-150 camps located on the map with their contact information, fly-in vs. drive in camps, airports noted, major roadways noted and plenty of lakes to reference. My map is from 1999 and have worn it out looking at the next spot for the bucket list or just thinking about the next trip already planned. By far one of the best tourism maps I've found on NW Ontario. Back in the day they were free. The website address from my old map is ;www.heartland.on.ca Note to self.....get a new map, the creases have seen a better day. The search engine on here will also be a huge resource. Good Luck and Tight Lines, PjShorthorn"
