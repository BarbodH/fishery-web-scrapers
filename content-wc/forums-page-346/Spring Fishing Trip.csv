2386689,Guest,2014-01-26 13:54:00,0,Hi Guys I am looking for any input on two lodges Horwood Lake Lodge - Timmins Ontario and Auld Reekie Lodge on Lake Gowganda in Gowganda. Most interested in quality of service at the lodge and the walleye fishing. Thanks for any and all reply's. Craneman

We went housekeeping, so I cannot comment on the American Plan. Joe, the owner at that time, is a decent no-nonsense guy. We never had any issues with anything while we were there and the staff was quite hospitable. However I noticed the lodge was listed as sold on a realtor website recently, but I have no idea if that was a recent sale or from years ago and just not removed from the website. So, it may be under new ownership.The cottages were nice and the boats were fantastic. It's a very nice lodge. The price for what you get was a fairly reasonable deal (it was something like $500 pp HK and $800 pp AP).The fishing for us was a slow. We spent a while trying to figure out this lake because the camp is located at the end of long narrows on the lake. The narrows are quite steep and deep, not something we were accustomed to fishing for walleye. We still caught a reasonable amount of fish, but I think we would have done better if we traveled further into the lake.I am confident this lake can produce and it's somewhat remote for a drive-to lake. I'd go back, but focus my fishing in the more central part of the lake.The one unique thing about this lake are the logs. It's quite the site. Every morning you will see 100's of logs floating around the lake. Presumably from an old logging mill or something. You have to be careful and dodge around them. Some days it was just insane! Definitely a unique experience for me.There's another camp that's a boat in located in the more central part of the lake as well called Horwood Outpost.If you're looking at drive-ins in that area there is also Ivanhoe Lake. I've always wanted to head down to their boat-in outposts one year. Boath Air Ivanhoe and Red Pine Lodge have them.I have not been to Auld Reekie."
