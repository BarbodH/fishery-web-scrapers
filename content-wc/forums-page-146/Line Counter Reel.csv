6232328,justaguy2454,2018-08-11 19:21:00,220,Daiwa Sealine. I own 3 of them and they work fine and are reasonably priced. Watched the show the next bite and they recommenced that reel on their show. I tried one and i liked it enough i got 2 more
6232330,Farmerj,2018-08-11 19:22:00,375,Mills fleet farm has some okuma deadeye planer board combos for about $90. Nice heavy rod and a line counter reel
6232334,That Minnesota guy,2018-08-11 19:38:00,8293,"Make sure whatever you get the drag is good. The rod can be crap, the line-counter inaccurate, but if the drag is junk you have problems. I'm also a Daiwa fan but there are other good ones out there. Also, if you like to use rod holders get a reel with a clicker."
6232336,WallyWarrior,2018-08-11 20:04:00,2488,"I like a rod with a light tip when trolling walleyes. This gives me the ability to see that action of my crainkbait and know if there are issues. I started out with cabelas depthmaster combos that were 69 dollars for reel and rod, they worked just fine for the 5 years I had them. Only issue I ever had was the style of line counter would cause the counter to get stuck at times. I recently switched to diawa sealines and am also happy with them. I'm not sure they are worth the money for the upgrade over what I had, but the counters do work better. I just happened to have the money and thought I just as well upgrade.

6232374,last chance,2018-08-12 05:29:00,3262,I think daiwa sealine is the best you can get for the money. but a good solid reel for not as much money is the daiwa accudepth plus. I used the accudepth plus for maybe 10 or 12 yrs and never touched them. I sold them still working because I got a great deal on some sealine sg17lc3b reels. yhou will be content with the accudepth plus reels. the adp reels are 61.00 on ebay where the sealine runs from 80.00 to 100.00 depending on what size you want. I use all 17 size reels on erie.
