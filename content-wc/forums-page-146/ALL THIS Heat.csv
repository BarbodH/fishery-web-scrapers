6232732,Obabikon,2018-08-13 09:03:00,2370,"August 1-7 was horrible walleye fishing, but amazing musky and crappie. August 8-13 has been lights out walleye, with a difficult musky/crappie bite. Walleye at the moment are running around 20' deep, which is pretty normal. Sides of humps and rock points have worked best. I fished yesterday morning, and we could have limited out on 17"" walleyes 5 times."
6232750,DaBirdman,2018-08-13 10:04:00,164,"Water temps last week on Armit, which is east/northeast of Sioux Lookout and south of Lake St. Joe were in the 72-73 degree range. We found walleyes from 5ft down to 20ft, but most all the pike were in the 16-20 foot depth range, especially the larger ones."
6232760,martinbns,2018-08-13 10:32:00,1520,"We were out all last week in Andrews Bay, Bigstone Bay and south of the Barrier Islands last week, found most walleye in 25-30 feet, more small than eater size. Heat seemed to affect the Smallmouth bite, they were deeper than usual off points and boulders. My wife was recovering from a lumpectomy surgery so we didn't fish particularly hard but had no difficulty catching double or triple good 15-17 "" eater limits."
6232762,martinbns,2018-08-13 10:33:00,1520,"Also worth noting, while we didn't really fish them we marked huge schools of large fish in 50+ feet of water slightly suspended 5-10 feet off bottom over and over again.Lake trout maybe?"
6232820,Bill Krejca,2018-08-13 13:24:00,6107,Maybe. Maybe whitefish. Bill
6232832,neldog257,2018-08-13 13:53:00,16,"We fished Aug.2-8. Walleyes were 15-30 ft. Pike were 30-35 ft. Had a few warmer days but also had one day with rain and a strong cold wind out of the north. Overall, I think we missed the major heat of this past week."
6232868,phishfearme,2018-08-13 16:17:00,1242,"""probably"" whitefish. phish"
6232896,Eyetimes,2018-08-13 18:10:00,193,Iâ€™ve found that bite has been pretty good. That is if you nail the time right. The walleyes only want to bite for about a half hour in the evening sometime between 6 and 9.
