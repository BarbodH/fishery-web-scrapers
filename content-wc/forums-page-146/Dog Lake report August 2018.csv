Wonderful time! 12 yr old caught two 4lb smallmouths, his brouther caught his first fish, a sm slightly smaller. They caught 2 of them off the dock! Dog is a hard lake to learn and fish. It's rocky, deep, not many weeds, depth goes up and down making it hard to troll. Everyone pretty well knows where the fish are. The trick is to find them when they're there. Use meat..nightcrawlers or minnows and jig. The wind blows so try and fish when it isn't. Northern Wilderness is run by the Sheshequins, Charles, Wilferd, and Alice. Really nice folks. Cabins well maintained, private, and a good value. You use all your fishing skills on Dog Lake. It isn't like a fly in lake where guys in LL Bean outfits can catch fish. It's a lake for guys that read Walleye Central fish. I""m going back again next year."

The time I fished it we did ok and I caught my PB (until the next spring ) but the style of fishing didn't do it for me. Beautiful area and easy to get to for me plus the prices were good. I've been going to Windermere east of there for a few years now where the fish are smaller but we can jig them up all the time. Also a lake that takes a bit to learn."
