6231162,wmd,2018-08-08 09:42:00,388,Does anyone have a report from Ghost River this year? I know that quite a few people fish there but rarely see reports. We leave in 29 days and am more curious about water levels than the fishing. Thanks wmd

6231262,maddogg,2018-08-08 18:26:00,178,We fished GRL the second week of July water is down about 2 to 3 feet.You have to pull yourself through the tunnel at clamshell. Fishing was fair at best.
