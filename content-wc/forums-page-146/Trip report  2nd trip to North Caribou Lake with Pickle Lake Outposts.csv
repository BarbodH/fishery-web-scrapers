6230986,phishfearme,2018-08-07 20:13:00,1242,the cabins are for rent thru PLO - not well advertised at all. 4 of the cabins are sleeping cabins and one is cooking. they call it Runk's Camp. the boats are indeed great - you can see them in the first minute of this vid:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwk9...ature=youtu.be phish
6219376,phishfearme,2018-07-10 05:51:00,1242,"We just returned from N Caribou Lake after our second trip there with Pickle Lake Outposts - this year LarryS's sister was replaced by my old buddy Vito. From a fishing perspective, this trip was quite similar to last year's trip (which you can see at: https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...=north+caribou ) with a few modifications. - the weather was not all that good - best example: when we arrived the water surface temp was 72degF and when we left it was 62degF - trophy sized pike were again non-existent (and we tried a good bit) and even the larger pike were quite rare - our largest were two 35 inchers and very few over 30inches. the cabin log book shows this is the case for all the other groups who made entries - one pike oriented group posted that they ""caught 47 over 10 pounds"" and listed the largest which was 36inches. I just do not consider this a trophy pike lake - or more accurately, the section of the lake accessible from the PLO cabin. - for walleye, my boat partner Vito and I had what I consider to be the best 2 hours ever - at least for me. We trolled up to a saddle between an island and a rock pile and immediately had a double - both at 20 inches. to make a long story short, over the next two hours we had 14 doubles and about 15 single catches - excellent but what made this special is that all fish were between 19 and 21 inches except Vito's 23 incher. incredible! - again this trip the trophy walleye eluded us and, like pike, I would not consider this section of this huge lake to be a place to hunt for trophy walleye. our largest was 25inches (3 of em) with a few 24inchers but that was it - just lots and lots of 19-21 inchers, each of which are somewhere north of 15-20 years old this far north. - for the strangest event of the week - Vito caught a sculpin while trolling for pike. this is no BS - see photos. We rebooked again for next year but are considering going to PLO's other cabin which is in a totally different region of this lake. phish"
6219612,stjoeguy,2018-07-10 11:11:00,979,I'd never heard of sculpin before! Thanks for the report.
6219614,HeHooksHimself,2018-07-10 11:21:00,725,I had to sculpin up.It seems that are mainly in Minnesota. No mention of them in Canada. Interesting.
6219640,Carnhzkr,2018-07-10 11:57:00,964,"Sculpin cheeks are delicious, but you need a really sharp knife."

6230562,phishfearme,2018-08-06 17:54:00,1242,"he made us an offer we couldn't refuse - but it was strictly business, not personal"
6230644,adempsey2.0,2018-08-06 21:47:00,611,I never ventured up into that section of the lake. Is it shallow? Weather is always the biggest unknown. That is a massive temp drop....definitely a big challenge to make that work.Did you manage to catch any Sauger?Where is PLO's other cabin? I was under the impression they only had one camp on North Caribou.
6230710,phishfearme,2018-08-07 06:56:00,1242,"the northwest corner of the lake is indeed more shallow than the center or southern section - but not shallow by any means - you can easily find 20-30 ft depths but in the southern portion the depths approach 100 ft. I attach two depth maps. this may be a contributing factor in the lack of trophy sized fish in the NW. however, we chatted with the most recent group that was in the southern section and their results were quite similar to ours - max walleye 25, max pike 36. we did catch a few sauger - they are clearly different than walleye and usually smaller. PLO has only one cabin but manages a private cabin in the southern portion for the owner. it is a full hour boat ride in flat water from the PLO cabin - and the river inlets in the southern portion and stewarts bay are another hour past that. with rough water it would be an all day slog one way - just not worth it. distances are a tad shorter to these spots from the NC cabins but not that much. I find it incredible that anyone would do this much traveling and risk not being able to get back home. phish"
6230940,adempsey2.0,2018-08-07 16:40:00,611,"Are you referring to that Cabin on Picnic Island?We traveled from NCC to both Stewarts Bay and Thurston Bay with no problems. It was not so bad. HOWEVER, the boats at NCC are 16' Lund Rebels with 25HP E-TECS. So, that helps a lot.If I was in a 14' with 9.9HP I would be making sure the weather was going to be good for a long trip that day."
6230954,phishfearme,2018-08-07 17:11:00,1242,sorry but I don't know what/where picnic island is. the private cabins (there's 5 of them) that Pete manages are on that island to the north - and very slightly to the west - of terry island. the PLO boats are also 17/18 footers with 25hp e-tecs - it took us almost an hour to get to just north of terry island from the PLO cabin with a flat lake and stewards bay is about the same distance further. I can't imagine how long it would take in rough water. phish
