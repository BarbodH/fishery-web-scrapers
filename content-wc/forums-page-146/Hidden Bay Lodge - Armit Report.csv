As luck would have it, the camp was open a day early so we got an extra day in which was awesome. The drive there was great. The 502 is in very good shape. The construction at Fort Frances was a bit of a lengthy wait, and there's a couple more spots on the way from Dryden to Sioux Lookout, but those were minor interruptions. Got up there Thursday early evening, checked in, then went and ate at the Forest Inn. Excellent food, but a small adult beverage list to choose from. Nonetheless, we enjoyed our dinner very much. The next morning we loaded up the plane and had a perfect smooth flight into Armit. After unpacking and getting acquainted with camp we headed out and was fishing by 10:00am. I had spent many hours looking at maps and researching spots to fish and the first half of the day my first few spots only gave up a handful of fish. The afternoon run proved to be quite different though. Found a nice saddle area with boulders that topped out at 10ft and dropped into 25ft and the fish were thick. With that knowledge in mind, I had a pretty good idea of how to go at this lake the rest of the week. For the next 7 days we caught more fish than any of us had before. So many triples and doubles were had and the blue/green color on many of them was just beautiful to see. Each morning I went out early and scouted out new areas to fish, or eliminated areas to fish. One theme rang true for all our most productive areas... find points, saddle areas and rock outcroppings that had boulders and were adjacent to deep water, and you were going to find loads of fish. We found fish from 5ft out to 20ft. As for presentations, whatever and however you like to fish, it worked. Jigs with bait or plastics, spinner rigs, cranks casted or trolled, corking.... they all worked. Had I known how good the fishing would be, I would've saved some cash on bait. Plastics caught just as many and at times more. As for Hidden Bay....I mean... what more can you say? Wilma is so nice and pleasant to talk to. She makes sure you are taken care of, top notch! Mike our first pilot was funny as heck. Mark our second pilot is one hard worker. And although I didn't have the privilege of meeting Shaggy, he was the most instrumental person to help us prepare and enjoy our stay through all the emails he responded to so quickly and willingly! The all inclusive meal plan is the way to go. All the food like hamburger, chops, chicken, steaks, eggs, bacon, sausages, and homemade cookies and pies!!! Way, way more than we could eat in 8 days!Wish I could do this every year, but unfortunately that's not in the cards. I WILL be going back in a couple years though. This is something i gotta do again!"

6232666,Bstar,2018-08-13 05:52:00,564,Nice Report! What were your biggest fish?
6232684,DaBirdman,2018-08-13 06:28:00,164,"Nothing too big unfortunately. Biggest walleye was 22"" and we got 1 of those. The rest were 14"" to 19"" with a few 19.5's. Biggest pike was 35"" and we got 2 of those, although we had one around the 40"" mark leap out of the water just 3ft behind the motor trying to get a 15"" walleye I was about to lift into the boat! Went vertical some 2-3 feet in the air and splashed both me and my daughter! My uncle's boat heard us yelling from over a 1/2 mile away. HahaAlso learned not to leave your jig hang just under the water while helping take a fish off! I caught one on a jig/twister, threw it back, set my rod down resting over the motor arm with the jig hanging down by the prop. My daughter has one on and I grab it to take the jig out and suddenly my rod is about to go into the lake! Grab it and there's a 17""er on there! Luckily my reel got caught on the tiller arm of the motor!And we didn't always keep track of how many fish we caught, but it was somewhere between 900-1000 fish total. The best day in our boat was 170 fish in 7 hrs of fishing."
