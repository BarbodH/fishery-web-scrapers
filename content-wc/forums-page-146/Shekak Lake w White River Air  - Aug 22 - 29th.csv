5114657,Crackback,2016-09-17 01:55:00,257,"I fished Shekak back in 1994 and Pickle in 1993, Gourlay in 1973, 1987. Gourlay was fantastic in 1973 and average in 1987, but the lumber loggers opened a road directly to Gourlay and now it is available pretty easy by 4X4s and the fishing went downhill big time. I had Lowrance 350 A at Shekak in 1994 and I know how to use it. I have found the fish in Pickle and Shekak all run small and quantity is problematic as do the Pike. Shekak and Pickle have been hammered to death for years and it isn't getting any better. I quit my group with their going to WRA lakes in 1994. That group quit WRA in 1999 for the lack of quality and quantity of fish. I believe the lakes in the Algoma area between White River, WaWA and Timmins are fished hard and too often, if you know what I mean. Both I and my former group are now driving to Ontario's Northwest where we find much better lakes WITHOUT flying in at the same costs including Lac Seul and Rainey, Eagle, Wabigoon with much more productive fish in size and in quantity. We regularly catch 50-70 walleye in a day without much effort with 20% over 25 inches with 50% of the Pike over 35 inches with the biggest at 44. We never experienced that at any of WRA lakes in the 20 plus years we went there. In today's world, you have to drive much further west and North in Ontario to get quality fishing. I just won't tolerate the fishing quality the Algoma area offers anymore. Go west Young Man, Go West. You won't regret it one single bit. My hard headed group resisted for 5 years leaving WRA, but once I convinced them to go West.....they reluctantly regret staying in the ALgoma area for longer than they should have. One guy who has been with the group for every season since 1974 had never caught a walleye much over 25 and in 1 day on the Northwest Arm of Rainey Lake caught 5 fish between 27 to 29 with one bumping 31 and that doesn't include all the smallmouth bass they caught. Talk about getting excited, but then fishing success is really contagious isn't it? I now go to a full service drive-in Lodge on the North west Arm of Lac Seul and I catch more nice walleye fishing off the dock sitting in a lawn chair than I do when I'm fishing in my boat. My wife went crazy when I found a huge pod of walleyes stacked up against a rock wall in 30 FOW with my side scanning Humminbird 1199SI and she landed two nice 28 inch twins running custom painted 3/8 Rattle tot in chrome with a orange back with red dots . That lure alone popped well over 40 walleyes and I only had one of them out of the 100+ rattle tots I normally keep on the boat......but that is fishing. Good Luck in your choice."
