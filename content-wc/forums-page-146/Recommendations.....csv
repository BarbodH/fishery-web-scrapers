Come from Ohio, area not a big deal as whole group (with exception of me) is retired. We currently alternate between red lake and nakina. Quebec would be fine as well. Prefer our own cabin/lake if possible,but are somewhat flexible. We are fine doing our own cooking etc....other than the fishing, we are just looking for clean, comfortable cabins and boats, with a good outfitter. Thanks for any info....."

Resort-http://www.mccollumsresort.com/index-1.html World Record - https://www.brooktrout.ca/world-record-brook-trout.htm I have a friend who lives in Thunder Bay and he always mentions how the Brook Trout, Lake Trout and Walleye fishing is. Never fished it myself but have fished some stocked inland lakes in the Kenora area with good results when I lived there."

6230920,hoppy63,2018-08-07 15:58:00,367,"Yes....I'm sure he would be big help. I did subscribe to his site, and PM'd him here but have not heard from him. I would guess he is busy. I believe he is pretty good about getting back with people. I do not face book so that is not an option. Thank you for response."
