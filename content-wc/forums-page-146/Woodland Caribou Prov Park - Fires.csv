6231808,Bill Krejca,2018-08-10 11:51:00,6107,"Was camped on LOW in 1980. Fires were rather plentiful in the general area, watched a plane(s) picking up water for a fairly nearby fire. For days before, the sky had been red, sun red all day long. Air smelled of smoke. We did notice an abundance of ash on the tents, etc. Friday evening, we were approached by a boat with several guys, told we had to evacuate the area. We said we were leaving in the morning, they said OK, we were camped on a very small island in Whitefish Bay (when Americans were still allowed to camp in that area). Only after getting back to the mainland did we find out that besides the ash from the fires, Mt. St. Helens had erupted, and that had contributed to the hazy atmosphere and ash. Fishing had been absolutely terrific! Bill"
6233170,LoDo,2018-08-14 10:03:00,721,"We flew into Donald Lake 7/28 with minimal smoke, however several active fires to the Northwest and southwest. We fished in light smoke 7/28, temps in the lower 70s for two days. Heavy rain hit our lake two straight days and we were smoke free on the lake the rest of the trip. Excellent fishing!! We left camp 8/3 and didnt see smoke from Donald to Winnipeg. The group that came into camp 8/3 had to evacuate yesterday due to smoke and fires on and very close to Donald lake."
6224838,LoDo,2018-07-22 20:53:00,721,"I know Donald lake cabins were immediate evacuation two days ago. Donald is ~40 miles due straight west of Red Lake, between with Carroll and Hammerhead. A few miles from Manitoba border. Caretakers and crew are out due to heavy smoke. Ive seen photos and reports from those that were in camp few days prior to evacuation. Fires within 3-5 miles, serious smoke coming from all wind directions other than west. As we know lightning is the primary issue. Need rain!"
6224870,Lake Of The Woods,2018-07-23 00:08:00,124,"Yup,... it is what is known as the ol' 'Fire Flap' forest fire season in firefighter circles. Used to fight forest fires during the 1980's out of the Kenora area. Last time I saw it this busy would be in 1988 due to thousands of lighting strikes. That year it would not be unusual for a crew to be dispatched by helicopter to a fire and by the end of the day you could have easily stopped at 2 to 3 more small fires before returning back to base 10-12 hours later,... ching-ching!,the money was good!That same year we had Big Red 07 which measured in at 350,000 Ha (864868.835 acres) and the bloody thing burned in the sub-surface all winter and into the next spring in some areas. Was on that fire for 8 weeks straight,... it was like a war zone without the gunfire. Still have the ""I Survived Red 7"" tee-shirt we had made up laying around somewhere. Have lots of pictures of that one I need to get scanned and put to digital storage.Talked to some people I know who work for the Kenora MNR Forest Fire team and they said most fires are small lighting strikes and 'Being Observed' with the exception of Red 038 which is currently 28,000 Ha (69,000 acres) and Kenora 071 which stands at 9,500 Ha (23,500 acres).Remember being on a fire near Werner Lake which is just south of Woodland Caribou Provincial Park and it was a bit of a beast too,... caused by a logging operation in the area at that time.A buddy working out of Kenora told me that all of last year there was 188 fires inside Ontario's fire region and that this year there has already been 788 fires. Of course the severity in fire activity is cyclical in nature and everyone who has been a Forest Fire Fighter has witnessed these patterns over the years.However, when the fires are threatening communities it doesn't make the situation any easier to accept and that's where the majority of man and machine power will be concentrated. I've been on fires where we set up sprinkler systems to protect camps and communities,... sometimes things worked out and were saved but other times the fire was just to overbearing and we had no choice but to retreat and helplessly watch peoples camps and homes be devoured by flame,... not a good feeling for anyone. The one thing that Ontario has to make the task easier when fighting fires is the plentiful water sources available throughout the province and arguably the best trained people to get the job done.Usually the Provinces pull together and help each other out when things get a little crazy like this year. There was also an occasion in the 1980's where we had American fire fighters show up and help. Every one learned something from each other that year in terms of strategy and technique. Ahhh,... fun times indeed. Did I mention that the money was really good too for the 5 or 6 months,... not quite as good as the guys & gals get on the 'Deadliest Catch' boats,... but much frick'n of a lot safer! lol."
6224882,Stringbean,2018-07-23 04:34:00,279,"Years ago,I can recall fishing on the east end of Lac Seul. There was a fire burning somewhere around Wapesi Lake. We just jigged for walleyes all day long and watched the water bombers come and go. I think the engines on those planes have a little more power than my outboard."
6225126,Lake Of The Woods,2018-07-23 14:23:00,124,"Yeah, save place to be during a fire,... in a boat fishing and watching the show! Of course unless the CL-215 or CL-415 decides to scoop up some water on the small lake you are fishing on! lol. Yes, it has happened. The CL-215 is powered by two radial Pratt & Whitney R-2800-CA3 Double Wasp engines generating 2,100 hp each. The older CL-215 is able to carry 5455 liters (1440 US-gal) water. The newer CL-415 is powered by two Turboprop Pratt & Whitney Canada PW123AF engines each generating 2,380 shp (shaft Horsepower) and is able to carry 6137 liters (1621 US-gal) water. It sounds like and is a large amount of water but on a large fire it seems like a raindrop falling into the fiery beast!"
6225144,Stringbean,2018-07-23 14:50:00,279,"I have seen these planes sitting on the tarmac at Red Lake. The only problem is that it's hard to tell the difference when you're driving by. 1) You need to be familiar with the planes and 2) You need to watch where you're driving. Just before you get to the airport there is a sharp turn. Even though its well marked, I believe there have been many drivers who missed the turn."
6225336,pjshorthorn,2018-07-24 06:57:00,5654,"I've had a couple of close encounters with the water flyboys. These pictures are from Eagle Lake last year when the fellas were doing some maneuvers in Vermilion Bay. Very impressive to see how agile this big plane is after it drops the water from the hold. We were about 1/2 mile away from the spot where they were practicing.4 years ago my son and I got to watch the same type of maneuvers while fishing the west end of Red Lake. After multiple passes the pilots must have noticed me taking a lot of pictures as they flew by because on their last pass, they came in on a closer line to us than on previous passes. We got pretty wet from just the mist that the water drop created. My son thought it was pretty cool that he got bombed that day.Much respect for those pilots . They sure know what they are doing to operate that type of aircraft in hazardous conditions.PjShorthorn"
6225574,Lake Of The Woods,2018-07-24 20:06:00,124,"Great pictures. Yes, when things are slow the pilots like to get out and practice their water pick-ups and drops. Years ago when fighting a fire north of Kenora ten of us got caught in the drop zone. We scurried like rabbits to find the base of a tree to lie down behind, point our heads in the direction of the oncoming drop and hang on. Four of us including me had been hit by the load and we had welts on some parts of our backs down to the calfs. Luckily no one was hit by flying tree branches or worse yet a 20 foot top section of a pine or spruce. Poor radio contact was the culprit due to a dead battery on the Crew Leaders handheld. Pilot had no idea we were in the vicinity of the drop zone. Needless to say,... that never happened twice."
6225578,valley366,2018-07-24 20:29:00,193,I follow Woman River Camp on Facebook. They had a good video of the bombers on there today scooping water in the lake near someones cabin. Don't know if it was taken on Woman River but good close up video of it. Looking at the tail numbers was at least 4 bombers in what appears to be synchronized loading/dumping.Maybe the link will work. https://www.facebook.com/kim.hancock...2NTE0MTAxODE0/
6226310,LoDo,2018-07-26 16:25:00,721,"Gents, I'm going in tomorrow!! There are three camps on Donald Lake in WCPP and one camp currently has a few fisherman. They were able to go in 7/23 and still there. No masks or flashlights needed at this time. We'll be the first group in since last week. Super excited. I heard the rains yesterday really helped with current fires and soaking the lands which is really what is needed. http://firesmoke.ca/forecasts/viewer...CA-01/current/ Excellent link ^^^ project smoke throughout the continent and you simply zoom in to your area of interest. WCPP has toned down quite a bit in the last 24hrs. We usually have internet at camp and if so, i'll post a report or two while I'm in there."
6230918,Rock Lobstar1,2018-08-07 15:43:00,134,So? How’d it go?
6206598,LoDo,2018-06-09 11:52:00,721,"I've heard a few comments on fires in Woodland Caribou. Does anyone have more info on this? I'm most interested in the Carroll Lake, Donald and Hammerhead lake area. These lakes are directly west of Red Lake 40-60 miles."
6206678,Rock Lobstar1,2018-06-09 15:28:00,134,As far as I know there are no active fires in the park right now. The big one that burnt a lot of the park was in 2016. There was a good fire further north that was just north of Moar Lake but it’s pretty much out now.
6223226,LoDo,2018-07-19 07:08:00,721,"Theres active fires in Woodland Caribou Prov Park going right now. Easily 4-5 different fires. A few shots from our camp on Donald Lake. If you've ever used Showalters Outfitters, these fires could affect your travel. Especially if Carrol or Hammerhead lakes are your destination."
6223536,Skywagon,2018-07-19 17:11:00,1106,"Have a friend from the States at Hammerhead this week, will be interested in hearing how it went when he gets back in.Was flying North-East of Sioux Lookout yesterday afternoon, saw smoke from a small fire north of town, a helicopter was working it. Still very dry in this part of the world."
6223766,neldog257,2018-07-20 08:00:00,16,"While fishing Miniss July 7-12, we watched a tree go up in flames after a lightning strike. Thankfully it was on an island away from our outpost cabin, but within a day there were guys on the ground and multiple planes dropping water on the flames. The firefighters (land/air) had the flames extinguished very quickly. Very impressive!"
6223842,LoDo,2018-07-20 09:56:00,721,"Woodland Caribou Prov Park is a flipping tinder box right now. MNR just released a statement saying ""you're on your own"" if in the park. Folks on canoe's in the park are to evacuate through outfitters and camp owners within the park are on their own. Skywagon - hope your buddy at hammerhead is alright. Red 096 is burning there now."
6224148,Rock Lobstar1,2018-07-20 19:31:00,134,**** I forgot about this thread. I swear there was nothing when I posted earlier in June haha. I’m up there now working on the fires.theres lots of them. We found 3 new ones today. Sabourn Lake Lodge was evacuated the other day but that fire is across the lake and died down considerably from the rain last night. Here’s a pic of a camp that was saved by the fire crews setting up sprinklers on and around all of the buildings.
6224210,johnboat,2018-07-20 21:24:00,2014,Dang! Nicely done. That's looks like a very close call.
6224248,greenie,2018-07-21 05:44:00,87,"RockLobstar1-Fished at Sabourin Lake Lodge back in the 70s. We had smoke from fires in Ontario, in northern MN yesterday. Was just thinking about Sabourin Lake Lodge yesterday. Funny you mentioned it."
6224412,Woody Walleye,2018-07-21 14:35:00,1,Any update today on fires and weather? I had seen an update at 10 PM yesterday showing no new closures. I saw the forecast showing some rain earlier next week projected but the next few days some increased chances of fires.
