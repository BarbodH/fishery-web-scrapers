6230434,Red legs,2018-08-06 13:52:00,27,Fished the north-east side with SLFL. 8 - of us fished the week. Saturday through Tuesday were normal good numbers and size. Then Tuesday night a 40 degree cold front moved in with NE winds followed by a blue sky high pressure front. For the rest of the week fish were not to be found in the usual locales. Wednesday yielded one of the hardest most difficult bites I’ve ever seen on Lac Seul. Fish were in classic lock jaw. I felt lucky to have caught just a few in the ten hours I put on the water. Thursday was a little better with a few more caught but the 17 inch take home fish were difficult to find. We did manage to find some big fish that liked a leech drug slowly in front of their nose. Friday things started to get back to normal with a southwest wind and a forty degree warm up with partial clouds accompanied by favorable walleye chop. We had one of the best big fish days we’ve ever had in my thirty years fishing this area. Fish over 23 inches were too numerous to count. Fish in the 25-27 inch range were common to each of our three boats. One 29 inch fish succumbed to my leech rig and was the largest of the week for our party. Overall the weather put a serous crimp in numbers and had us all scrambling for take home fish under the slot. Big fish were not difficult and lots of pictures were taken. Water was about two feet low. We used the Short Cut on the way out but could not on the way back in. One very experienced and knowledgeable member of our party lost a prop and part of his skeg to a “new”obstacle in found an “old” formerly safe place. For the week we boated about 1000 fish in my boat. In normal years twice that are boated. The fish were found primarily on rock to sand transition areas adjoining forty foot water with the fish holding at 25/28 feet or slightly deeper. No shallow bite of any consistent nature was encountered after Tuesday. Weeds ( cabbage) were not in the usual locations but those found were mature and flowering. We did not cast for musky or pike. Overall the trip was a success although fishing was subpar compared to prior years. That made the results all the more rewarding given the rough hand Mother Nature dealt us weather wise. Leeches were more productive than crawlers and Rigs were more productive than jigs and you had to fish very slow and deliberately to coax the bite. We don’t fish minnows.

6230538,Red legs,2018-08-06 17:16:00,27,"Yes, but not much luck.Lots of new rock / stump hazards - be careful if going and especially if you have not seen hazards in a very low water year. I’ve seen it so low we had to off load gear to the roof of houseboats at Hudson dock. Some hazards are “walk on water” depth only an inch or two submerged barely disturbing wave patterns. There was a lot of boat traffic . That was downright disappointing. Most I’ve seen in thirty years. Most exercised good etiquette but not all. Luckily the poor etiquette was at a point where we were ready to move on to another point on our milk run. So no confrontation resulted."
6230662,pjshorthorn,2018-08-07 05:28:00,5654,"What were the general areas of the NE section did you fish? I've spent a lot of hours Fishing from Bear Narrows all the way to Scaler Lake, up to the Wapesi River and then as far NE as Jackfish Narrows and Pickeral Narrows. I have been there during years where it was 6 ft. low and we saw hazards that we never knew existed as well. We made a lot of notes on our maps ( before GPS) when we found new hazards/ reefs. Future trips when water levels were up, we would fish those hazards/reefs. Thanks for the report. Always nice to read one on an area that you've personally fished a lot of hours on. PjShorthorn"
6230776,Red legs,2018-08-07 09:18:00,27,"PJ, we fished Chamberlain, Brechin, Tuk, kakabeka , Three sisters, primarily. We did not venture north of Chamberlain. The reefs in Brechin were particularly dangerous at the walk on water level with satellite rocks just under the water level far enough away so as to be invisible and far enough away to make one think they were safe. The channels to Scaler and China were passable but particularly dangerous with a lot of stumps at skeg level if you strayed even a few feet out of the creek channel. The one member who hit one of those had a brain cramp and forgot about them being there. It seemed to us and our pilot confirmed the observation that the pattern of fish migration was ahead of schedule getting ready to go into a fall pattern possibly early due to the low water year. The land vegetation does not support that observation though. The weather on the other hand does support that observation with the last three weeks each containing major cold fronts with big blows followed by clear crisp high pressure.even before the cold front we noted fish absent in numbers from the usual shallow water haunts. 41- degrees on August 1st was a shocker for us when compared to the 95 at home. We wore every layer we brought and then some on that day. Face masks and gloves were broke ought for the milk run. Nice to see the jack pines growing to shade height - maybe the woods will actually get back to clear understory in our lifetime after that fire 2002. Some of our favorite shore lunch areas are so brushy that they are basically useless. This area was once one of the more beautiful areas with old growth forest and clear understory but now is reduced to impassable scrub understory."
6231094,pjshorthorn,2018-08-08 07:47:00,5654,"You fish in my wheelhouse!!!!!! Over the years we never had to go much past any of the areas you mentioned because the fish are always there. Kekabeka Narrows is one of my favorite spots along with a nice sand flat that would be on the eastern shore after you pass the Anderson outpost cabin and make the hard left turn to head north. So many spots to fish in just that small area of Lac Seul.If you would like, PM me your email address and I'll send you a lengthy email thread with a lot of information that I sent others who were going to fish these same areas for the first time. I have some marked up maps too with fishing spots and houseboat parking spots noted that I can send to you.If you have any marked up maps, I would love to see how those spots you fish correlate to the ones I'm used to fishing.PjShorthorn"
