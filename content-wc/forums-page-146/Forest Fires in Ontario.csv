There was also a fire to our Southeast. I ran across this site that was interesting, lot's of haze here in Minneapolis although the south wind cleared it up today. Anyway, http://www.gisapplication.lrc.gov.on...r=AFFES_ONLINE"
6232926,dakota eye,2018-08-13 19:17:00,69,We also saw those fires in South Inlet. How was the fishing with this heat?
6232942,Pooch,2018-08-13 19:55:00,4618,"We just fished both those areas a few weeks ago. Lightning, but no appreciable rain?Ran in to that on a fly-in on Birch lake years ago. Lots of small lightning fires all over the place, but no rain. Sometimes the fires burn unnoticed for days in the thick damp undergrowth then make themselves known weeks later.Pooch"
6233108,bigtimeelectric,2018-08-14 08:41:00,174,I assume the Lac Seul area is under a burning ban then?heading up in a couple weeks hope to be able to have a camp fire ugh but not looking good
6233144,dakota eye,2018-08-14 09:31:00,69,Fished Lac Seul couple of days ago and the smoke was thick enough that it resembled fog.
