I felt like I got to know those areas fairly well, and we always had good success.In 2017 and 2018, we booked our trip in the first week of June, and we fished mostly in the Yellow Girl Bay area. This year the action was very slow. The very cool spring may have had something to do with it, but the weather this year was mostly stable.I would like to book a trip in the Wiley Point / Crow Rock area for June 2019. I am wondering if the early part of June might be a harder time to locate fish. Perhaps they are transitioning from shallow spawning areas to the summer locations?I know there are no absolutes, but I would appreciate any comments on what time of June to target. Thanks."

That said, any year, any month, any week, any day... has the potential of being not as good of fishing. However, if you're looking for a suggestion on the ""average""... you'll be very hard pressed to find a better walleye week than early June."
6231492,MN_Moose,2018-08-09 13:54:00,964,We always go the second week of June. If I had the opportunity I would go later. Maybe third or fourth week of June. I'm looking for water temp in mid 60's. If your looking in that area you described I'd also throw out Big Narrows Lodge. Never stayed there but I know they're in that neighborhood.
6231612,martinbns,2018-08-09 21:29:00,1520,"I would probably go either the 1st or 2nd week. They have calmed down, the spawn is well over and we have had very good results."
6231674,eyeman_1,2018-08-10 06:30:00,690,"BG, I have fished out of Wiley Point at least a dozen times and I have fished the 2, 3, 4 weeks of June and 1st week of July. I can't say that I ever had a trip with poor success, however, the earlier you go there are chances for less stable weather and fish may not be transitioned to their summer patterns or may be in transition. The earlier part of the month the walleyes may still be shallow along spawning areas, or on shorelines or points, and may not have moved mostly to the deeper reefs. You'd just have to figure that out. It is safe to say the later in June and into the first week of July the water usually will have warmed and the fish will have mostly transitioned to summer patterns. The area you are looking into has so much to offer that finding fish shouldn't be difficult, it will just be a matter of figuring what / where they are. That being said, I prefer the last week of June or later, because the walleyes mostly have transitioned to reefs, there will still be some in the weeds where you can find them. The bass will be shallow and fun to catch on a variety of baits, the bigger pike will likely have moved out of the shallow weedy bays and be in the first transition to deeper water, or off the points adjacent to the weedy bays or I've found them off midlake humps trolling. The muskie's could still be in the developing cabbage or be transitioning to the rock... but it's all water temp related and fun to figure out. Good luck and enjoy that area... looking forward to going back next summer myself."
6231716,BaitGone,2018-08-10 08:03:00,3,I appreciate everyone's comments. Now it is a matter of trying to coordinate everyone's availability in our group. I guess that is part of being the trip organizer.The really hard part is going to be waiting for next June!
