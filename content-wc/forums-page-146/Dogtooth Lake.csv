6233026,brown1317,2018-08-14 06:42:00,74,Generally it's much slower in Aug-Sept vs May-June. We have caught nice fish in Sept but usually have trouble getting eaters. Just our experience.
6111346,prov1800,2018-04-05 07:26:00,5010,If you want a explanation look up different lake types. Medtronic Euttrophic Oligotrophic Basically all these types of lakes have different habitat.dogtooth and hawk lake are probably not natural walleye lakes.i fish lakes lime them in my area and have huge walleyes also.but find as more people fish these lakes the walleye populations slow down.hawk lake is not accessible to the public and has only a few private cottages on it.where dogtooth is open to the public.
6197268,KC Walleye,2018-05-20 12:17:00,274,Any reports? Anyone have a current water temp? Just looking for any info as we leave in less than a week. Can't wait. PM me if you wish. Anything helps. Thanks in advance. Hope everyone is too busy on the water to post reports to the forum
6197302,Fisherman Ted,2018-05-20 14:17:00,461,We fished Hawk last night for maybe an hour and half. Deep basin part of lake is in the low 40s. Bays are low 50s. Walleye are still in spawn mode. We caught 4 27s and 1 30 and some smaller fish. This next week should be excellent fishing for sure. -FT
6197322,bthomas3333,2018-05-20 14:59:00,465,Sounds great!See you tomorrow Ted!Brett
6197324,KC Walleye,2018-05-20 15:05:00,274,Thank you Ted. Appreciate the info. How are the water levels there? Sounded like a lot of lakes were a few feet low.
6199670,KC Walleye,2018-05-24 16:41:00,274,"Any updates from anyone? Water levels, temps, etc? Just wanna make sure we can get big boats in to kilvert. Leave tomorrow, can't wait. Anyone feel free to PM me if you wanna share any secrets!!! Tight lines y'all."
6199722,bthomas3333,2018-05-24 19:17:00,465,Hey - Just returned from Hawk at 4p tonight. Fished Mon-Wed. The water level was normal. I didn't see noticeable differences over the last 4 years. The walleyes are very shallow. Water temps were 48-54 Monday am. By Wed pm they were 52-57. In general after three very warm days they were up about 4 degrees at the surface.The big girls are always tricky but they are being caught. My boat netted a 28 and 30.5 one night. The next night we had one 28. During the day the smallies were a blast. Got a 19.Hope this helps. PM me if you need any other details. I'll probably write up a larger report when things calm down. Brett

6203346,KC Walleye,2018-06-02 12:10:00,274,"Well the trip to Dogtooth is over and we are driving back to KC. That’s always a sad day. We had a great trip, minus a few dings and dents on the boats and motors. Kyle and Patty were great hosts and the cabin met the needs of our group perfectly. We primarily fished Kilvert Lake as we found more fish there it seemed that were receptive to our approaches. We had a few guys who fished leeches on slip bobbers and they did well. Many others were primarily jig fisherman with minnows or plastics. Some days plastics outfished live bait. The warm temps at the beginning of the week seemed to push fish out of the shallow bays quickly and out to the deeper breaks but not quite to the mainlake structure. Our first few days found them possibly still in a post spawn funk also. But, by the middle of the week the fishing was very good. Then the last 2 days the cold front moved in with rain and winds and really changed the water conditions and changed the fishing some. The water temps were 66-71 mainlake/bays by midweek and by Friday after the cold front temps were down to 60-63. Water levels are normal we were told. The river/creek to get to kilvert was an interesting adventure. Make sure you have your paddle ready to keep your boat off the rocks by the old bridge area, and find the perfect motor angle and speed, as we have a few small dents and a broken skeg to show for our travels through that stretch. We have a 2075 Tyee with 250 verado, but the smaller boats/motors didn’t seem to struggle nearly as much in the narrow, shallow rocky area as we did. But the trip to kilvert seemed worth it (until skeg repair bill comes). Many fish over 27” were caught with the largest being 29.25”. We caught a lot of 23-25” fish each day, and found enough fish to have for 3 dinners and bring some eaters home. The system definitely has a very healthy population of fish as our average fish probably was 22-23” with multiple 75-100 fish days. All in all it was a great trip. Thank you to many of the nice people from this forum as they shortened the learning curve immensely. If I can help anyone out in the future, please feel free to PM me. Tight lines ya’ll,KC"
6232988,dhilgers,2018-08-13 22:59:00,3,"I've never fished Dogtooth and am thinking of going Sep 6-10 this year. I love trophy walleyes and don't need to catch lots of small ones, but my other boat partners prefer more action even if it means fewer big fish. How hard is Dogtooth to fish during the first weeks of Sep?"
5962762,KC Walleye,2018-01-23 13:42:00,274,"Hello y'all, Just want to see if anyone on here would be willing to share any information with me on Dogtooth Lake. We are making a change this year from Lac Seul to Dogtooth and any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. We are going the week of Memorial Day. The lodge owner has been very helpful and I am sure will have good intel for us, but I always want to be the most prepared one in camp. We will mainly target walleyes but I am sure a few times will target other species. We will concentrate on big fish also more than numbers. I have read pretty much all of the info available online about Dogtooth, so now I am just looking for some personal insight, experiences, tips, etc from all of you great WC members If you don't want to post here, feel free to PM me. Thanks in advance! KC Walleye"
5962954,Wall-i-Lama,2018-01-23 15:25:00,1524,"KC, It's a great place to go for trophy fish. Wayne is a great owner and will send you in the right direction. My first piece of advice is be prepared to adjust to a big change in quantity of fish (especially compared to Lac Seul) There are not a lot of walleye in that system. There are some huge fish there, but it is a different type of fishing. We had a lot better luck in Kilvert lake with size and quantity of fish. Hopefully, the creek that connects to Dogtooth is high enough to get you through. We usually went thru with trolling motor. Lastley, there are a LOT of shallow reefs in the lake. Wayne will give you a map and will mark the major ones, just take your time and keep an eye out as they can reach up and get you on dogtooth. Good luck!"

5964786,buckeye1,2018-01-24 16:47:00,269,X2 on the quantity vs quality and the reefs. Floating jugs mark many of them.
6108490,KC Walleye,2018-04-03 22:24:00,274,"Anyone have any background knowledge of when the ice usually goes out on Dogtooth? Just looking for an estimate as far as earlier than most lakes, later than most lakes or just the same. We arrive over the last week in May and just want to plan accordingly. Any thoughts on how a late ice out would effect fishing on Dogtooth? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks"
6108514,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2018-04-03 22:35:00,240,"Hi--one thing I would do is go view all the videos on youtube about fishing Hawk Lake Lodge and the Rushing River system, which flows from Hawk Lake Lodge to Little Dogtooth and into Dogtooth itself. You will get a sense of which presentations are most effective, and at which time of the year. Angling Edge and Fishing Edge, as well as the Ontario Experience (all shows featuring the Lindner family) all have extremely well-put-together shows on these lakes. Good luck and have a great time!"
6109370,bthomas3333,2018-04-04 09:31:00,465,"Hi KC, I have fished Hawk several times and always at the opener or early June. I have posted several reviews about fishing hawk at the opener that might help you. In general the fishing is a different game on the Rushing River system. The numbers are much lower. You are fishing for Quality not Quantity. There are evenings where I get a handful of bites in 3-4 hours. The good news is the size of fish can make each one of those bites special. If I get one 28+ per day I am happy with a few smaller fish a day. I tend to fish really slow but some of the other guys fish / cast faster. For me a shot and minnow hook casted or a jig trolled at .5-1.2 mph is best. Keep the profile of the bait smaller helps too. Again for me. Linder was casting jigs and plastic and popping it back and it worked for them. I lost an opener 4 years ago to ice. I think that system trails LOTW by a few days in terms of ice out. I think the first week is a risk this year. Feel free to PM me with questions. Brett"
6109802,stumcfar,2018-04-04 12:12:00,451,"Why does Dogtooth have big walleyes, but few walleyes?? I have seen more reports of people catching close to nothing on their trips to that lake, but if they do happen across a fish it is really big. Just curious the reason the fish don't populate more?"
6111234,brown1317,2018-04-05 07:03:00,74,"We've been fishing Dogtooth for 35 years and the number of eaters we get has declined steadily. I personally think the lake is getting fished out. We go the first week of June and again the first week of Sept and except for the past 3-4 years, the resort has been full each time."
