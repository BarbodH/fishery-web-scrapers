Likely be coming alone would like a decent cabin. I can cook myself, don't really need a guide. Will be bringing my own boat. Will cross at International Falls Mn. In a perfect world no gravel roads. Open for idea's. Any camp owners can shoot me a PM if you have a opening. Again, I'm after Pike. Thank you."

Very impressive clear to understand web site. It seems like a million years since I was last on Eagle. Are there a lot of rock hazards and are they well marked? I understand going slow but was curious what you can tell me."

Gord has his infamous Musky Madness week going on 9/22-9/29 which may fit into your schedule. There will be a lot of folks in camp specifically fishing for big fish.I can suggest some spots we have fished ( more summer pattern), but there are some monsters in the lake. Of course, Gord has guided on this lake for many many years so he knows better than anyone where the big fish might be in September.The lake is very easy to navigate , in my opinion, with hazards marked fairly well. HotSpots map has pretty good detail on the hazards as well.PjShorthorn"

To be honest, it seems like the pike numbers and size are down in recent years but I never actually target them. It could be a 40+ every time I get bit off while jigging."
