Just under three weeks we will arrive at trappers point on sturgeon lake. No doubt, we will spend a great deal of time on the big lake but plan to fish some out lakes as well. I was wondering if any of the area lakes have good smallie or crappie fishing. As i mentioned in another thread our out lakes are couture , wirtheim and squaw and harris.. would anyone know if these lakes hold crappie and smallies? My son and i really hope to get just a taste of all the species ontario has to offer. Any info is greatly appreciated. Thanks again., Scott stay safe and good fishin!!!!"

I hate to burst your bubble but there are neither of those species in that area, to my knowledge, further down 599 you will start running into some small mouth lakes, small mouth are an invasive species , i like to catch them, but they have been known to ruin a few walleye lakes, there are crappie in Lake of the Woods, not really sure how far north crappie have made it. The savant area is known for good walleye, pike, and sturgeon lake is a better lake trout lake than walleye lake ., although , by now small mouth may have made there way into the south end of Sturgeon, which is a very big lake"
