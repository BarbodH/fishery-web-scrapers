6230934,stjoeguy,2018-08-07 16:32:00,979,"As my name implies, I think the walleye fishing on Lake St. Joseph is great! I've been to Camp Lake St. Joseph, the Winoga Lodge outpost cabin, and Slate Falls Eagle Island cabin...but never to Old Post, so I can't help you there. I'm sure they do an excellent job. I'm not sure if guests can search or if you have to be registered. If you can search, just search Joseph in this Canada section. There are a lot of reports. Or go to youtube and look for Lake St. Joseph."

Lake St Joe is a long drive from where we live in suburban Chicago -almost 980miles one way. The Wallleye fishing is very good - faster action than say Lac Seul to be sure. Likely due to the lake getting far less pressure than what Lac Seul gets. Will say that Lac Seul seems to grow larger fish though. I remember the boats and motors being good and reliable. Cabins were spacious and comfortable. First few trips we did the American plan and then went to housekeeping to save money. The food served was good and plentiful. No live bait is allowed on the lake - jogs and twister tails are all I used and these produced lots of fish. Owner John Grace and wife Wendy are very nice people and gracious hosts. The lake is FULL of reefs so I urge you to hire a guide or follow a person with experience on what areas to avoid. I hope to get back up to fish this lake after I retire in a few years time. Miss the lake that much.

The camp owners and staff have been terrific - always very welcoming and attentive, and fun. The camp facilities and equipment have been good to great. Meals consistently very good. The walleye fishing on Lake St. Joseph is really amazing, and likewise the northern fishing. For us, this is a very special place in every way."

But as another poster said, they are not huge. Average is about 16"" - 22""--nice and fat, though. Live bait is permitted but not needed till later in the year when the fish get a little picky. The pike fishing is amazing, too. Lots of them and very good size. Like the walleye, you can catch just about as many as you want. We usually get several at, or over, 40"". My grandson got a 40 incher this year. He can't wait to get back My biggest was 39"". You may already know about the size limits. No walleyes over 18"". Pike have a slot limit. I'm sure details are on one of the web sites (we stay at Camp Lake St. Joseph) Good luck!!"
