6231724,Obabikon,2018-08-10 08:23:00,2370,$30 for 4 dozen leeches? WOW...
6231748,walleyecheek,2018-08-10 08:51:00,2231,WOW !!! Is right
6231802,Pooch,2018-08-10 11:40:00,4618,"Makes crawlers look pretty darned good!!! Plastics even more so.The thing that grates on me is driving through Wisconsin and Minnesota and passing bait shop after bait shop with leeches available for about half of what we pay in Ontario. I DO NOT mind paying more for bait north of the border, but when there is none available and it is available south of the border.............. The leech ban went into effect when the USDA stopped imports of beef from Canada during the ""mad Cow"" outbreak ten or fifteen years ago. Pretty typical of cross border trade tiffs.If there is no biological reason to ban cross border leech imports then let the folks from USA bring leeches over, but pay a duty on them.In reality, it is of little consequence whether I fish with leeches or worms. Both catch fish, but I just like fishing leeches for some reason. Might be the same genetic defect that makes me a cranky old duffer.Pooch"
6231810,38bill,2018-08-10 11:52:00,331,We were fishing in Canada the last full week of July. Leeches were already very hard to find then but our host buys direct from the bait collector and he had a few left that were saved for us. I also stopped at Mills Fleet Farm on the way up and purchased crawlers just to make sure we had bait. I prefer fishing with leeches as they are cleaner but we tried the crawlers to see what would happen and they seemed to work just as well. They sure are messy though.
6229032,jackpotjohnny48,2018-08-02 18:21:00,153,"Hi guys,I'm going to be fishing Pipestone / Slender lakes (Emo, ON) from Aug 11-18, and I just heard that leeches are getting a bit more difficult to find.I'm heading up next Wednesday (the 8th), to do some crankbait trolling in the Nestor Falls / Kenora area, so I wouldn't need the leeches until Saturday the 11th.I would prefer to buy the leeches in either Kenora, Sioux Narrows, or Nestor falls, so that I don't have to drag them around for 3 days before I need them.But based on the sounds of things, I may have to take whatever I can get (even if I have to buy them in Fort Frances 3 days before I need them).Any suggestions for places where I have a good chance to buy leeches, preferably somewhere between Nestor Falls and Kenora?Also looking for suggestions on where I can buy frozen ciscoes?I just called Rainy Lake Sports in Fort Frances, and they are completely out of both leeches and ciscoes (They said they have been out of leeches for at least 2 weeks, and don't plan to get anymore anytime soon).Thanks in advance for any info you can provide!""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
6229116,Pooch,2018-08-03 04:53:00,4618,"Last I heard was that leeches are done for the year and minnows can be periodically in short supply. Finding leeches in August is always pretty ""ify"". About one out of five years do we find them available.We leave for our second trip in a couple weeks and are taking salted minnows with us for backup. Also, crawlers are always a great option if not sometimes better than minnows. We also are getting more comfortable with plastics.Pooch"
6229126,Bill Krejca,2018-08-03 06:25:00,6107,"I've had good luck using black Berkely Power Leaches. I like a heavy 5/8 oz jig head, short shank, no collar, fished vertically, leech hooked through the wide end. I try to only move the bait very slightly - take a look at the action just below the surface to see what moving the bait an inch or so up and down looks like. The baits are maybe a little hard to find; in my experience, they work better than the Gulp version. Bill"
6229156,The tank,2018-08-03 07:12:00,340,Get some preserved magic leeches. If your just dragging them around on a jig or spinner rig they work really well.
6229174,The tank,2018-08-03 07:36:00,340,Ive also used impulse leeches from northland tackle with good results.
6229182,tiz,2018-08-03 07:44:00,18,"It's a official, we're done on the leech's as my last order leave the store this weekend but my good buddy Jess has them at the Swenson marine in Sioux Narrows at only $70.00 pound and that in Canadian money. We have plenty of minnows and night crawlers and plenty of new stock so call in for a look around and a friendly chat. Hope this helps and good luck on the water."
6229588,GNO,2018-08-04 09:41:00,153,Nestor Falls Bait and Tackle has leeches. They are not cheap. $50+tax for 1/2#.
6229776,Capt Morgan,2018-08-04 18:02:00,77,"This is not correct, as of 7/28 leeches are not available. We. Stopped at the bait shop in Nester Falls and they are done for the year."
6231590,GNO,2018-08-09 20:32:00,153,Sorry but you are mistaken. I picked up a bag of them for a friend.
6231672,walleyecheek,2018-08-10 06:28:00,2231,Nestor falls bait & tackle is still getting leeches (not many) selling them in a 4 dozen container ( not by the pound) 29.95 Canadian !
