6551256,Bergy,2021-04-16 14:05:00,83,Looking for 2 Lodge/Camp recommendations for Spring/Summer of 2022. First Place - looking for a drive to place in Manitoba or Ontario that would have on the nicer side for accommodations. Family trip. Would like to possibly hire a guide for a day. Would be open to American Plan or Housekeeping with good cooking facilities/kitchens. Mainly want to target Walleye and Smallmouth Bass. Will probably bring our bogat so want good docks which are protected. Second Place - looking for something in Ontario within a hour or two of the border for a guys trip. Decent accommodations with bathrooms and kitchen so we can cook on our own. Mainly target Walleye. Want something with decent docks and protected since we like to keep our boats nice. Thanks in advance for any recommendations.

6551282,prov1800,2021-04-16 15:12:00,5010,Clarkes northern lights resort on cedar lake great for a guys trip and family also but not quite as fancy as Onaway Lodge.Thats the nicest camp i have been to.Both camps have good docking but again Onaways dock system again the best ive ever seen the whole thing coraagated metal thats rubber coated.Both lakes are great fishing for what you asked for.I do guide at both places so if you need more info just message me.

6551398,pjshorthorn,2021-04-17 04:15:00,5654,"#1 Trip......Vermilion Bay Lodge.......great place for a family trip and day trips to Kenora or Dryden are an easy drive if the kids and wife want a break from fishing. #2 Trip.....Since you are looking for it to be a short drive after crossing the border I would seriously consider LOTW. Easy to cross at Baudette and then you have plenty of places to choose from on LOTW. On my very short list is Obabikon, but that is an American plan lodge. PjShorthorn"

6551444,NARDA 1,2021-04-17 09:00:00,636,Take a look at www.birchdalelodge.com 807-227-5262. Would work well for both of your trips.
6552020,Ricky Spanish,2021-04-19 10:26:00,1298,"Temple Bay Lodge ticks all those boxes. Been there a couple dozen times. Always did the American Plan and their guides are great but after so many years, we go it alone now. I'm already paid up for a week in a housekeeping cabin whenever we can get back. I'd also 2nd Obabikon, which I plan to stay at as soon as I can."

6552630,Bergy,2021-04-20 18:47:00,83,Walleye Chowder or anyone else with experience Can you tell me more about Vic & Dots?Docks protected from the wind?How are the cabins?What can we expect for fishing? Walleyes? Crappies? Perch?How far to good Walleye spots?What else can you tell me from your experience?Thanks.
6552720,Wallychowder,2021-04-21 06:05:00,1567,"Yes protected docks. Cabins are decent. You definitely wont catch 100 walleye a day, but the walleye you do catch are very nice ! Smallmouth over on whitefish are phenomenal ! I've seen guys bring crappie in ? I personally haven't. The camp is about right in between Sioux narrows and Nestorfalls. Stuff to do each town."
