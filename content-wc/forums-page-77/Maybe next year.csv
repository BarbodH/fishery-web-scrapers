My deposit will be rolled over to 2022. July is doubtful as the rest of the year. Got a friend that has a cabin near Virginia Minn. he has invited me up for some fishing in the area. The cabin is not on a lake but many within a hour. Will have to do some research on fishing in the area."

6553394,BCNeal,2021-04-22 19:15:00,19,"Iâ€™ve fishing Rainy in June, July and September. The trips in early June were easily the best."
6553472,Hookhunter135,2021-04-23 05:46:00,129,Plan B for fishing this year as well. Just had my June trip cancelled to Quebec. Holding out a slim bit of hope for Sep hunting.

6553604,camp chef,2021-04-23 10:30:00,915,"We cant fish the Canadian side of Rainy like we normally do, so we are going to try the Minnesota side and operate out of Houseboat."
6554766,nitroman,2021-04-26 11:49:00,368,Rainy lake houseboats? We stay at the thunderbird right in the same bay.
6554768,camp chef,2021-04-26 12:02:00,915,No...We are using Northernaire Houseboats a little further East than the Thunderbird.
