6551982,LoDo,2021-04-19 09:20:00,721,Didnt take gov long to walk back their OPP random spot check policy. My Red Lake contact says the local OPP wouldnt enforce the policy anyway.
6552000,prov1800,2021-04-19 09:34:00,5010,"That's what i was thinking.There is a OPP road block on the Mb/not border right now stopping non essential travell into Ont.People from Mb cant access there cabins,can guests from Mb wont bè allowed to go to any camps tgey had booked for opener and i lost a week guiding already to."
6552346,Camoclad,2021-04-20 06:27:00,628,"Definitely not making light of the situation but it seems that you all are encountering what some of us did about 6 months or so ago with lockdowns and stay at home orders in various places throughout the US. It was similar here in that local law enforcement had a hard time enforcing the orders when folks didn't comply. Not a criticism on anyone and their choices, just noticing the similarities in what you are dealing with now. Hopefully, sooner than later, you will be past these restrictions like we are. For the most part we can move about freely with the exception of the border crossing. I cannot fathom the dread and devastation some business owners are feeling, I really do pray for them to be able to make it to the other side of this mess. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6552366,Eckohlt,2021-04-20 06:48:00,3685,"There will be way more devastation towards businesses,owners,famly's,workers,than COVID will cause,they just realize how many people's lively hood there putting 6ft under"
6552510,rosh1,2021-04-20 13:44:00,275,"Pro I bet you are getting fed up with all of it. When I went home for lunch my wife was on a roll about it also. She was going on about the taxes we pay and other bills and we haven't been able to get to our camp. I think we all are tired and it needs to get over. I have said this before ,we are only missing fishing really feel for all the it effects up there. Stay safe and hope the border opens soon."
6551796,prov1800,2021-04-18 15:49:00,5010,After doing my legal ESSENTIAL dump run yesterday I of course took maybe a illegal detour to the dock.Always cheers me up there.2 trucks and trailers parked in parking lot so couple lucky guys got there boats in.Good sign.Iam sure you have all heard or read that our lock down now also has a stay at home order.They also not only have the US/.CA border closed the Ont/MB and Que borders are also closed.This virus deal is getting worse not better.Good news is they are allowing you to go out and excercise and go shopping for food.So I figure fishing is some form of excercise and fishing gets me food so i figure Wednesday is a good day to go.Crazy times.Any camps that had guests coming from Mb are out of luck and i had a guide week with people from Mb also.These new rules go till May 20.We all now everything will be extended again.What a s**t show.

6547384,prov1800,2021-04-06 17:51:00,5010,Still waiting for right conditions. Few more days till I have enough open water.
6551006,Skywagon,2021-04-16 04:51:00,1106,"Yesterday the plane made it out of the hangar for the first time since October, with the latest rains the lake had risen enough it could get it off the rail system platform and into the water. There was no particular place to go and all afternoon to do it, so after entering Dryden airspace I told flight control that I was heading west and would take a tour of Eagle lake. Along the route I noted that Thunder lake (a deep trout lake) was still mostly covered with ice, Wabigoon was mostly ice-free as were the small lakes west of Dryden, even Eagle had little ice on the majority of the lake. Flying over Vermillion Bay I snapped a shot of the town and boat landing (on the right side of the picture). The other picture shows one of the spots on Eagle where the ice is still holding on. Along the way I saw some scattered pairs of swans in the pothole lakes, several gulls and a couple of eagles, but was disappointed to have not seen even one of the famous Eagle Lake flamingos, apparently they have not migrated yet."
6551036,prov1800,2021-04-16 05:54:00,5010,Looks like a great day Sky.Decent day to get out.. still somewhat to cool and early for the flamingos
6551060,rosh1,2021-04-16 07:04:00,275,My wife was face timing her friend on eagle yesterday when I got home. Next thing I heard was her friend saying too grandsons 3and 5 boys keep your pants on. We were laughing hard as they are already swimming in Eagle. Wow I cant wait to get up there!
6551068,prov1800,2021-04-16 07:12:00,5010,Those 2 are some tough dudes.Water cant be more than just above freezing
6551082,v-bay gord,2021-04-16 07:45:00,3168,If you would have looked a bit west of your first photo you would have seen a lone flamingo on my beach.
6551120,Eckohlt,2021-04-16 08:54:00,3685,Looks like a go unlock the frickin gates

6545206,prov1800,2021-04-01 06:24:00,5010,Took a drive yesterday and had a look at the public landing on the east end of Eagle.Pretty bad scene.Not going to be launching any time soon there

6545244,rosh1,2021-04-01 07:20:00,275,I am hoping for a wet spring! Can't believe how low it looks.
6545334,prov1800,2021-04-01 08:41:00,5010,Pretty bad.Saw it like that many years ago.Makes boating that east end more dangerous than ever.Stuff guys missed will be thete now.
6545374,rosh1,2021-04-01 09:20:00,275,Friends have been sending us pictures also. Have heard stories of it being lower hope it doesn't happen again. I know I wont be able to get my boat on my lift unless it comes up. Have fingers crossed for open borders and rain.
