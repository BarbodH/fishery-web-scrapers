Jeff has been very gracious with me over the years and providing lots of great intel about lakes, locations and outfitters I had the pleasure of chatting with Jeff to pull this together and it was enjoyable and informative Without further adieu here is a link to the interviewhttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/t...rom-south-bend Hooks - thanks again for doing this - really appreciate it Andrew"
6554742,pnnylfr,2021-04-26 11:03:00,114,Another enjoyable interview. Always interesting to hear how trips progress through the years. Keep it up.
6554754,v-bay gord,2021-04-26 11:26:00,3168,"Good story, and interesting to hear the perspective of why our guests love fishing in NW Ontario. I was shocked and amazed to hear PJ Shorthorn referred to as a ""legend"". If I would have known he was famous I wouldn't have treated him so shabbily....."
6554770,That Minnesota guy,2021-04-26 12:08:00,8293,"""Legend"" is pretty strong. I have read some interesting stories about the guy. Seems to be a professional instigator of some sort. Rumor has it he has been asked to leave the Atlanta area and is heading North."
6554800,HeHooksHimself,2021-04-26 13:26:00,725,"Well he is a legend to me, and so are you Gord. I am easily impressed."
6554842,gordy28,2021-04-26 15:57:00,437,"Thanks all for the kind words - was great to get to chat with Jeff and yes part of what I have loved about doing the interviews and writing up the articles is understanding peoples ""journey"" My group went from fishing weekends that included little catching, driving to places close to home in southern Ontario, then to White River, to Nakina and to Sioux Lookout and I am sure at some point Vermillion Bay, Kenora, Winnipeg, Armstrong and maybe even Northwest Territories will be visited Even though I live in Ontario I am always amazed by the sheer number of lakes that exist Andrew"
6554892,ILScott,2021-04-26 18:18:00,139,"Good read Hooks. Interesting my first year to WLC was also in 2000 and I stayed in the outpost in Dynamite Bay. Like he said it was a little more rustic back then with the white gas lanterns for lights, now solar lights. I will have to say Hooks gave me a tip on a lure for lakers and spot I have never tried for lakers. It produced a nice 30"" for my 13 year old son's first one in 15 minutes. This is why this site is so nice, most people are helpful and offer good information."
