6551856,Lazy Fisherman,2021-04-18 18:29:00,276,"Thank you for posting, John. I guess the only way we can get our NWO ""fix"" is through your posts and pictures."
6551858,prov1800,2021-04-18 18:32:00,5010,I'll keep trying.There trying to keep us from leaving our houses now.
6551870,Eckohlt,2021-04-18 18:51:00,3685,"Sneak out the back door they won't see you and wear camo and also a Halloween mask,they won't recognize you,good luck and may the force be with you"
6551918,prov1800,2021-04-19 06:00:00,5010,I would most likely be the only person on the lake. The police seem they don't want to get involved in the Gestapo act the government is imposing on us.
6551948,Eckohlt,2021-04-19 07:42:00,3685,"Well if the gestapo chase you on the lake run them up on a rock reef john,just like in the movies,nickname you,john bond 00-1800"
6551950,prov1800,2021-04-19 07:55:00,5010,They won't be on the lake.Theyll wait by my truck.At least I would get some undisturbed fish√¨ng in for the day.-8 here this morning.As week goes on it will be getting warmer.No rush to get out.Thurs 14c and sunny looks like the day to go.
