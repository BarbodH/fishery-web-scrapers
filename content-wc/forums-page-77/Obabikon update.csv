6556158,Billswest,2021-04-30 10:03:00,32,for the update. Hard to believe the border will be closed for a second season but it's sure looking that way. Best to you and all who have suffered through this unfortunate pandemic and the actions (or not) our respective governments have taken to address it.....
6553512,Obabikon,2021-04-23 07:45:00,2370,"Some of you might follow me on facebook, but I just posted an update. This is nothing that anyone doesn't already know, but I thought I would share. Let's not make this political... just an update. I'm just posting another update with zero new information. While many people have contacted me in the past few weeks to check in, I know that others are waiting for some type of news. I am certainly with you there. There are small grumblings on the US side that we need to start relaxing border restrictions. However, on the other side, things are not going very well. Canada is behind in vaccinations, and they are in the middle of a 4th wave. They have actually made restrictions heavier in the past few weeks. I want to reiterate that I have very little information that the average person can't look up using google. I do spend time each and every day trying to look for new indicators. Here is what I believe will happen. Best and worst case scenarios... Best case: the US agrees to share vaccines once the US has been inoculated. Then in turn, Canada agrees to open the border to all those who have been vaccinated. This is a logical plan, this is a good plan, but I do not believe it is highly likely. This would require negotiations/planning/communication from the two Governments. This does not appear to be happening. Also, I think they could feasibly have this plan in place by early July. Worst case: Canada has to go at it on their own with vaccinations. They will then keep the border closed until at least September. They lack the infrastructure and production capabilities that the US has. Take into account all of the extremely rural/hard to get to areas... September is probably optimistic. Then on top of that, they have to decide that it is safe to open, then formulate a plan to actually open. This is not a slam on Canada. This is simply trying to explain that Canada is much larger than the US, but 1/10th of the population. So... things aren't as simple. At the moment, Obabikon is operating under the ASSUMPTION that June and July will be a normal months. This is NOT going to be possible, but without communication from either Government, we can't do anything except wait. Given my research and general feel for the situation, I am giving the odds of June at less than 1%. Technically, it could still happen, but all indicators are that there is no chance. I am giving July less than 50% at this point. As always, Erin and I are committed to the long term operation of Amason's Obabikon. We will be honoring or refunding all deposits/timeshares/pay in advances. We understand the importance of vacations and time spent with friends/family. It is with sadness that we encourage you all to make June/early July reservations that do not require an open US/Canada border. We truly appreciate all of the love and concern that you have shown us throughout this incredibly challenging time. We love you all! Stay safe! #TeamObabikon"
6553522,bus33,2021-04-23 08:08:00,289,Thanks for your thoughts.....my heart goes out to you and all of the camp owners that are most likely struggling to survive.

6553902,pjshorthorn,2021-04-24 05:53:00,5654,"Hang in there Jared. Things will get better......albeit slower than all of us would like. Count your blessings as you have many , regardless of how tough this has been for you and your family. I think you have a lot of people that will support you and the business as soon as we can do so. Best wishes, PjShorthorn"
6553918,Obabikon,2021-04-24 06:37:00,2370,"Thanks everyone. My wife and I are making ends meet. There are a ton of incredibly kind people out there, and I know that pj's right.... as soon as it opens, Obabikon (and all the other resorts out there) will be full from our loyal guests. Let's just get that border open so we can get back to having fun!"
6553922,pjshorthorn,2021-04-24 07:09:00,5654,How do you feel about the potential of flamingos showing up on the island ? VBay Gord has been able to start a pretty good migration of them to his place and they tend to follow me ala the Pied Piper. PjShorthorn
