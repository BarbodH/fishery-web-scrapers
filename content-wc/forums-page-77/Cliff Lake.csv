6553780,prov1800,2021-04-23 17:32:00,5010,It's down a bit Bill.The rains and snow last week brought it up some.The launch on the hwy was actually pretty normal. I only had a mile of open water.So I fished just around and south of launch in Muskie Bay.It is a beautifull body of water and not fished much.
6553312,prov1800,2021-04-22 15:44:00,5010,Got out on Cliff around 8 this morning.Couldnt go more than a mile before I hit ice.Oh well back toward launch and into a smaller bay.Got lucky in there and got a decent trout that threw back and bloated 2 muskies and list 2 others so pretty happy with that.water temp at 40 F.
6553314,pjshorthorn,2021-04-22 15:55:00,5654,That looks like a beauty of a day with nice results. PjShorthorn
6553316,prov1800,2021-04-22 15:59:00,5010,Glad it was open
6553320,pjshorthorn,2021-04-22 16:03:00,5654,The picture of ice reminded me of an opening week trip in 1996........we got to Duluth on the way up and Lake Superior was still iced in. We knew were screwed at that point. Our 7 day trip on Lac Seul turned into a 4 day trip....LOL. PjShorthorn
