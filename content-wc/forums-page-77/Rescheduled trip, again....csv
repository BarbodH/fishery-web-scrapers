6551372,LoDo,2021-04-16 21:46:00,721,"My group of 8 owners of a cabin in NW Ontario are late 30s, early 40s. All of our kids are under 8 yrs old and none have been to our cabin. They'll all be going in the coming years. It'll be apart of our annual trips for decades to come. IMO, if you grow up doing this trip, which us owners did, you'll love it and will count the days to the next trip. If you get introduced to this trip later in life, it'll really depends on your love for outdoors and fishing. I'll take this trip 100x over Cancun, Disney, etc... Its not close."
6551386,muskyman73,2021-04-17 01:05:00,401,I just went out to the garage and had a conversation with my fillet knife and knife sharpener. I told them that there will be no slice-n-dice this summer and to just not get too rusty till next time. I told them that All Knives Matter and that this was nothing personal. I think we will be ok.
6551408,Wallychowder,2021-04-17 05:22:00,1567,I clean fish year round. There are other lakes and rivers around you know !
6551432,Slim03,2021-04-17 07:23:00,159,I agree completely. I started taking my son at 9 and took him on a couple trips with me and my dad He likes his video games and I make him shut the phone off at the border and put it away for the entire trip. He never complains or asks about it the entire time. At the lodge I’ll frequently find him just sitting in the boat watching wildlife or fishing off the dock when he’s not helping out. He’s been on the big trip once one of the guys have me a hard time about it and I just said don’t worry about him. He fit right in gave him a few jobs to do like fire building and minnows so he felt like a big deal. Others were so intrigued they started to bring their older sons and one guy is just wishing his older sons would join him. Starting them young is important. My son is upset because this is probably the second year we will miss Canada and have 2 trips planned this year so just making the most of it fishing state side.
6551440,RichA$1970,2021-04-17 07:56:00,1159,"Sons love Canada until they hit the beaches with cerveza y chicas, then it’s game over."
6551452,Wallychowder,2021-04-17 09:51:00,1567,Do they take their own Corona or buy it up there ?
6551458,LoDo,2021-04-17 10:20:00,721,"My youth was Grand Forks, ND. Dad and I fished Devils Lake, Leach, Cass, etc.... all throughout my youth. We'd do Ontario 1-2x annually. I started going on the big boy trips at 8-9yrs old. There was always another son from the guys. We managed the small jobs like dishes, minnows, building fires, etc.... Us 8 owners have kids, but again, they 2-7 yrs old. I have two boys that can't wait to see this cabin. I think my 6yr old will go up this year or next as long as there are other kid(s) or adults to help supervise. The biggest thing for me was making sure my boys know how to swim. I've spent some good coin on swim lessons last 24 months. Dudes a little shark."
6551546,prov1900,2021-04-17 15:26:00,544,"I've been bringing my two boys since they were in 4th grade and now one is a senior and the other will be an 11th grader next year. My daughter, a 6th grader started going last year (Leech because of border shut down) and she loved it. This was going to be the year she went to Ontario with us, but alas, we know the rest of that story. My kids have all been to Disney several times but Canada is the only trip they ever talk about and can't wait to get back there. They will definitely continue the tradition once they get on their own and with their own kids once I am dead and gone (otherwise I will be there with them). I do love Minnesota, but there is just no comparison as we all know."
6551554,Eyecatcher23,2021-04-17 15:34:00,383,"My father had a pole in my hand as soon as I could hold one. Him and my Uncles would come back from their annual Quebec trip with these mystical fish named walleyes that had to be fished for differently, and it killed five year old me that I couldn’t go. He was like a drug pusher, and I didn’t have any choice in my addiction. There’s a lot more expensive, and less delicious things to be addicted to though. Now he gets to fish out of my boat and raid my tacklebox... smart man!"
6550924,RichA$1970,2021-04-15 18:48:00,1159,That’s positive thinking. The sad thing is there’s 3 in my party who are 77 and I know people are living longer but they are kind of saying F it due to the journey & 2 of them their wives are in crap condition. I feel for some of the people that Father Time might put a halt on it when the border does open.
6550934,Eckohlt,2021-04-15 19:02:00,3685,"Your right Father Time is going to cut short plenty of peoples trips,due to health and just plain ole sick n tired of being sick n tired.I haven't seen to many float planes with wheel chair ramps.At least they could do is open the dam border so some folks could go on there last trip this year if that's all that's left in them"
6550940,Hookhunter135,2021-04-15 19:11:00,129,See you all next year! Only way we are getting in to Canada this year is if the US coughs up a huge wad of vaccines. Canada is like an old prostitute if you want the doors to open up you gotta pay to play. The only way the United States is dunking a worm in Canada is if we front some Pfizer.
6550974,LoDo,2021-04-15 21:47:00,721,"Due to COVID-19covid 19, recreational camping is prohibited on public land (also known as Crown land) until further notice. NO camping! LOL"
6550990,Pooch,2021-04-16 01:09:00,4618,"This is a very real situation for a lot of groups. I've noticed for years the aging of the people in fishing camps and the average age is definitely getting older. There are always a cabin or two occupied by thirty to forty somethings, but overall most cabins are retired guys and older. Groups I fish with are losing members to aging out every year. Seems every season brings one less person from failing health or passing away. The thought every year that this could be one's last trip is very real. Sooner or later we all will make ""that last trip"". Sometimes we know it at the time, sometimes we don't know it at the time. I'd rather not know. Gotta wonder how many folks who have not been able to go north because of the border situation last year and probably this year will never return? Will there be younger folks to replace them? I pain for folks who own camps right now. Two years ago farmers (me included) had a prevent plant situation when the rains never stopped and we could not get crops planted. Had it not been for crop insurance that would have been a loss that many would not have survived. The equivalent of having to go to work at your job for a year, incurring all the expenses involved, but not getting paid for that one year. I doubt fishing camps have the equivalent insurance available or affordable. Hoping for the best, but no longer actually expecting it. ""Not to be Debbi Downer, but..."" AKA Pooch"

6551294,RichA$1970,2021-04-16 15:44:00,1159,"Well stated and just from my view, the teenagers and 20-30 year olds are not interested as much when I was younger to backfill the senior members. A lot of times it’s a grandpa or uncle who brings a young kid along to fill a spot. Nowadays if there’s not WiFi and other pampered items they lose interest. My 2 sons loved to fish and would go to Canada if it was a 3 hour drive and a 2 day trip, but the last fly in I took them on as we were waiting on the plane they looked liked sailors with a 3 day pass waiting to hit port call. Supply and Demand in which the market is closed and the customer base is shrinking."

6550774,Flip Silverlake,2021-04-15 12:58:00,645,Just saw on CBC that they are planning on shutting down interprovincial travel without an end date. My bet is all the rescheduling will be into 2023. Hope I'm wrong because my place up there will be completely trashed. Was nice while it lasted. Good luck to all those fish camps.
6550264,Esoxfeign1313,2021-04-14 08:48:00,79,"We rescheduled our June trip with Air Tamarac for September, which is the third time we’ve had to reschedule it. Luckily, AT has been great about letting us rollover our deposits. We didn’t want to wait any longer and potentially miss out on a chance to go if the border should open up before the end of the season. I have to imagine we’ll get up there by next year if this year doesn’t work out. Has anyone else reschedule their early trip for a later date?"
6550272,RichA$1970,2021-04-14 09:05:00,1159,"I think what you did is a smart move as I just don’t see an open border for at least 4 more months if that is even realistic. I look at the daily rates by both countries and one is progressing and the other well, no comment as it’s moving about as fast as a Lund with a dead outboard and one oar paddling into a headwind. Also, the latest 1 clot out of a million will slow the rates down. I’d say 2022 is realistic and the fall of 2021 is a hope."
6550280,Eckohlt,2021-04-14 09:19:00,3685,"Rich if they don't open sometime this year there won't be a n.w Ontario to go in 2022, there on there last breath,they can't breathe anymore"
6550290,kettyspanky,2021-04-14 09:29:00,271,I'm on the fence about rescheduling also. I was thinking the last week of August. That's as lates I can go. I talked to our resort owner the other day and he has no idea what will happen. Good luck to all and think positive.
6550300,RichA$1970,2021-04-14 09:41:00,1159,"Eck, some will go under and that just plain sucks as I would hope the government would support them with grants, tax forgiveness and other incentives as this was totally out of their control and it brings revenue and tourism. I’m prepared to go old school and camp & portage as needed as it’s cheaper, less windbags to deal with there is a sense of accomplishment being on your own, although there will be setbacks. Hopefully things work out and like everyone on this board, none of us has any control on this mess."
