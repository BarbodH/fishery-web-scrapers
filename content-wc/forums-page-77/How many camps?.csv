6553040,Timmer92,2021-04-21 20:36:00,451,"Ok, what is a ""camp?"" Fly in cabin? Campground? Resort? Why have I lived 50 years in a state bordering Canada and have never heard this term?"
6553060,Eckohlt,2021-04-22 03:23:00,3685,"It took me 51 years to know what a camp is,you have one year to go"
6553064,Bigtaproot,2021-04-22 04:12:00,900,"I think of a camp as a campground with resort amenities. Whatever the term, I sure hope they stay around for us to enjoy"
6553076,Skywagon,2021-04-22 05:40:00,1106,"Here in N/W Ontario a privately owned cabin is (more times than not) called a ""camp"" by the locals, it may, or may not be a fly-in cabin and does not even have to be located on a lake. A tourist camp, or resort, is a for-pay business that provides lodging/(usually fishing opportunities) and caters to tourists, a camping ground could be associated, but not necessarily. The term ""outpost cabin"" also has different meanings to different people, but you didn't ask about that."
6553102,Obabikon,2021-04-22 06:48:00,2370,"For 70 years, our resort name was Obabikon Bay Camp... we dropped that a few years ago, and now go by Obabikon Bay or Amason's Obabikon. It seems to have a ""roughing it"" connotation. When I tell the kids let's go camp... we're pitching a tent. HAHA"
6553104,AMPHIB206,2021-04-22 06:50:00,191,"Ash Rapids Lodge on LOTW Rainbow Point at Perrault Falls Timerlane Lodge in Ear Falls .........are a few of the popular sunset country ""camps"" that are for sale"
6552766,prov1800,2021-04-21 07:34:00,5010,This about sums it up.
6552788,LoDo,2021-04-21 08:25:00,721,"Hilarious^^. You have to wonder how much more the people can take of the close, open, close, 25% open, close, 50% open, cases cases cases, complete lockdown government playbook."
6552790,rosh1,2021-04-21 08:27:00,275,Pro you got that right.

6552982,sheepman,2021-04-21 17:04:00,98,Good one John!!
6552526,Walleye2242,2021-04-20 14:39:00,263,How many camps go under if border stays closed and another summer of not much income from the folks south of the Canadian border? Very sad to think about. My camp can keep my deposit this year if it helps. I will send up another deposit for next year if they are still around. My trip is in august so still holding on to hope. Best to all.
6552538,Obabikon,2021-04-20 15:18:00,2370,The season is looking bad. I do know a couple resorts that have been listed for sale recently.
6552542,Obabikon,2021-04-20 15:20:00,2370,I will add that many resort owners have taken second jobs and are working incredibly hard to prevent losing their resort. Time will tell...
6552628,7 Mag,2021-04-20 18:45:00,1887,"Sorry to hear that, It's definitely trying times."
6552682,LoDo,2021-04-20 21:34:00,721,"Southern camps have a better shot as they have Canadian population to help. NW Ontario camps in big trouble. I don't see how camps can stay alive with 2 yrs of zero revenue. If you have loans on these camps, good luck. Now, if you inherited your camp, paid camp off several times over, etc.... you'll survive and may prosper if you have heavy capital and have interest in buying more camps."
6552692,Eckohlt,2021-04-21 03:23:00,3685,"You can survive COVID,but with over 2 years no income thats the real killer"
6552722,prov1800,2021-04-21 06:14:00,5010,8Winnipeg is 2 hours from Kenora so there is a good population to draw from and Manitobans do go there pkus most have cottages there.Any bookings they had are down the drain as the Ont/Mb border is closed.
6552734,Wrktfsh,2021-04-21 06:35:00,492,Is the Canadian government/provincial governments doing anything to help or is it just too bad for the owner/operators.......your on your own
6552748,Obabikon,2021-04-21 06:51:00,2370,"They are helping enough to pay the property tax and insurance, but nothing for life expenses. If you choose to employ any of your staff... they cover about half (with a 75% wage subsidy... but it doesn't cover tax/insurance/social insurance) If you have a mortgage through a bank, they are helping, but most lodges are privately funded. It isn't good, and it certainly has not been anywhere close to enough. Most of us are hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt at this point, and have other jobs trying to make ends meet on the home front. I am not whining or crying about our situation. I do not mind work.... since covid I have been a carpenter, roofer, electrician, plumber, boat mechanic, carpet/tile/vinyl layer, landlord, gardener, driver, painter and chef.... probably more things that I am forgetting about. Most resort owners have a wide variety of skills, and those are in high demand right now. While I believe that there will be some resorts that will go belly up because of this... I think most resorts will simply be set back 5-10 years financially. Once this is all over, I will basically have enough debt that I'm repurchasing the business."
6552762,Pooch,2021-04-21 07:26:00,4618,I noticed a few familiar names on some reality sights the other day. Hopefully they are retirement and not forced sales. Thoughts go to them either way. Pooch
