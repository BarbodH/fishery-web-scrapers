My crew has always enjoyed the Sweet 16's for shore lunch each day, nice to hear we are on the right track eating those 16 inch fish. I didn't realize how old the bigger fish were so it was an eye opener."
6555080,stumcfar,2021-04-27 11:59:00,451,http://collections.mnhs.org/mnhistor...06p272-277.pdf This link is a great read about early commercial fishing on the MN side of LOW. It makes one wonder if walleye were as plentiful when the lake was crawling with sturgeon and how if any impact the resurgence of the sturgeon will eventually have on the body of water.
6555128,Bill Krejca,2021-04-27 14:53:00,6107,"Yeah re: Reasons why ""OK"" - Exact same reminder of the past various WC threads to which I related while watching the video. It ""ain't OK"". Also, I believe the video referred to the Minnesota end of LOW, which is a completely different portion of the lake than the Canadian side. So population and many other variables could both be correct, just in separate sections. It is not difficult for me to believe numerous nets can remove a gigantic amount of fish, even more than the numerous fish poles farther south. Or at least enough to create a negative situation.

6554208,Skywagon,2021-04-25 06:18:00,1106,Some interesting walleye information in this video interview with a MN-DNR biologist that relates directly with what we see in Canada https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBSsJdB10_Y . This clears up some of the speculation we see on this site from time to time.
6554246,pnnylfr,2021-04-25 07:48:00,114,Very interesting. Thanks for sharing.
6554248,bus33,2021-04-25 08:02:00,289,Thank you for sharing this....good stuff.
6554254,Bill Krejca,2021-04-25 08:30:00,6107,"Very informative video. Should be especially valuable for those who haven't maybe followed the fishing scene over the years. New to me was the part about the larger walleyes creating a larger egg sack, the developing fry thus being able to better sustain themselves against negative weather, etc. factors in their early development. Again, well done, with significant questions asked. Bill"
6554286,KC Walleye,2021-04-25 09:30:00,274,Thanks Skywagon. Good video
6554338,yoopertrout,2021-04-25 11:25:00,1172,Very interesting! Thanks for posting. Here's some interesting information on the situation in Wisconsin:https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/e...f11168445.html
6554402,rockpt,2021-04-25 16:23:00,589,"That was really good, thanks for posting. I had no idea that walleye traveled such long distances. Interesting he said the LOTW fishery is in good shape, but the Ontario Ministry says its unsustainable at current pressure and regs. Which is it?"
6554472,v-bay gord,2021-04-25 19:40:00,3168,"I just remember all the discussions on this forum with the many anglers trying to justifying why it's o.k. to kill the bigger walleye. This video makes the point why it isn't....but those who want to will just find some other source of the ""truth"". Hopefully future regulations will remove that option entirely. Good video by the way."

Good video by the way. v-bay gord"" Both Bill and Gord hit it on the head. One of the more important take-aways from the first part of this video was how critical a role that big fish play in the spawn, the bigger the fish the more viable their spawn. Return all the big fish back in the water, there will be more walleye in the end, the rules on that should be more stringent."
6554552,kswalleyer,2021-04-26 05:51:00,1651,"great video. I really like those 14/15""ers if Im eating. always throw the bigger ones back anyway....thanks for posting. glad to see maybe LOTW isnt about to die...I also dont fish over about 25' deep unless Im eating it. Used to think I wanted to run real deep cranks in heat of summer. I dont."
