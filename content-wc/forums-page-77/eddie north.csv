6551838,yoopertrout,2021-04-18 17:06:00,1172,Thank you. I will. It may be a year or two. Life has gotten complicated on several fronts. I sure want to get back up there though. I really love Ontario.

6551592,yoopertrout,2021-04-17 17:07:00,1172,I have a couple questions if anyone knows: 1. I know this place is known for big pike. Would it be a worthwhile place if one in the group really wants to target walleyes? 2. Are the cabins clean and not musty smelling? One in the group has asthma. 3. Is it past the logging roads?

6551638,adempsey2.0,2021-04-17 20:47:00,611,"It is about as remote as you can get in Ontario.https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=ca86a...=2&form=S00027 I have not been, but it looks like there plenty of walleye. No clue on the cleanliness of the cabins. Spring is probably the best time to go for trophy pike. The one consideration is that this is a river system. So, things will change depending on the water levels."
6551660,Eckohlt,2021-04-18 03:42:00,3685,"Rich I'd rather take 3 or 4 trips a year than blow the whole wadd on 1 trip,if your talking Bud's guinnisao lodge I think you have to be guided and I'm not a guide guy,never had one in my life,by the time we get back to fishing might not remember how to do sht,Canadians are all prisoners in there own country now and they didn't do anything wrong,time for a new prison warden"
6551678,Eckohlt,2021-04-18 06:30:00,3685,"The farthest north I've been was to Wapikopa lake it is north of Eddie north's camps,it was with moccasin trails.I'm not even sure if there in business anymore,from the native run fly in camps I have been to they only last a few years it seems,wapikopa lake was some wild country that far north"
