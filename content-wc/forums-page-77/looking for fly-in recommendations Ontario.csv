Ryan (owner) was awesome to work with, very responsive and since he loves to fish really helpful on that front. Their camps, boats and gear are in tip top shape and very functional They have a bunch of Lakes with Lake St Joe and Miniss being the bigger bodies of water Other lodges that may fit your bill that our group is very interested in trying: Shab Lake South with Thunderhook Outfitters https://www.thunderhook.com/ontario-...ts/shab-south/ Larus Lake with Nestor Falls https://www.nestorfalls.com/outposts/larus-lake/ Cheers Andrew"

It was super well run. Good, clean cabins, and the fishing was really good. We could always get walleyes under 18"" to eat, but they were in the minority. Most were 19""-23"", with plenty to 25"" and some to 27"". We didn't fish for pike, but caught a few to 40"". Our biggest number day (IIRC) was 75 walleyes between two people. We were on Dead Dog Lake. I was a little put off by the logging roads, but I now understand that isn't uncommon. On old threads I see repeated mention of some on this on this thread, such as Slate Falls. I'm just curious why Kabeelo doesn't get the mentions? Is it just that people on this page haven't been there, or is there something that puts the others a cut above? Thanks again for the ideas. I look forward to Covid being over so we can go."

6550748,phishfearme,2021-04-15 11:46:00,1242,REALLY - especially that a 2 pounder is about 18 inches and a 3 pounder is about 20 inches. that's a very high average for any lake in NW Ontario. then again there's the guys who say the walleye they caught averaged 23 inches - I asked them if they caught any smaller ones in this average - they said they caught lots of smaller ones - the 23 inch average is the average of the ones we measured. phish

Some guys are on the hunt for a giant and will spend all week looking for that one special bite. Some guys just want to get drunk in the most beautiful place on earth. There is something for everybody. PS - It's not unreasonable to get all three of those things in one trip. I've seen it happen many times.

I agreed with your post ! I have flown with other outfitters...NOBODY comes close to Dave and Michelle Beaushene at Nestor Falls Fly In Outposts! Wish we could go in June...doubtful due to the Border situation. I am still holding out hope for my August trip. Your post was on point...great fishing and even accidental Northern fishing rocks!!"

I am thinking ...less gizmos the better (fewer problem potential?)..so leaning toward the manually deploying Ultrex with Down imaging...but maybe not the side imaging.I am not a bass guy...just mostly Walleyes...some crappie fishing too.
6551038,prov1800,2021-04-16 06:00:00,5010,I run a Terrova.Like you said dont need problems.In 2019 my last guide year i get to use the big camp boats and the have the interests on them and had problems with them on the lake where they woukdnt come back up.Not good.Have to take the side panel off to pull a spring off so you can manually do that.
6550042,RichA$1970,2021-04-13 17:12:00,1159,Go to the All Canada Show website to sort and filter. Tons of choices and I’d do your own research reading reviews and take them for what they are worth.

6549888,Skywagon,2021-04-13 09:07:00,1106,"The problem with looking at Google Earth is that a lot of the information for remotes locations that I routinely look at (within a 100 miles of home) is up to 8 years old, many roads and much logging has occurred since then. If the goal is to find a lake, even a few miles from where any logging has happened, it will be difficult, it might be better to lower expectations on that one. John, out of curiosity, which Clark lake do you thing would come closest to fitting yooper trout's criteria (their nice cabins are a given)?"

6549684,yoopertrout,2021-04-12 18:42:00,1172,"Hello, It's been several years since I've done a fly-in. The last place was top notch, except for one thing - We flew over logging roads until we were within a half mile of the camp. It was still great trip, and the roads aren't used in the summer, but it didn't quite feel like going into the wilderness. I'm looking for recommendations. What I'm looking for: 1. A place that will take 2-4 people. 2. A place with a likelihood of some 25""+ walleyes. 3. A place with decent numbers of walleyes. It would be nice to have steady action and a shot at 50 in a day per person. I'm not so interested in a place where 100 a day is possible, but they are all 2-3 lbs. 4. A shot at a few big northern, with a chance of a 40"" would be nice. 5. No logging roads. 6. Clean cabins - allergies can't handle musty. Thank you."
6549724,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2021-04-12 19:58:00,240,"Hi--your criteria can be met by hundreds of outfitters in NW Ontario, so you will have a lot of fun sorting through the myriad of info. available. When I say NW Ontario, we are talking crossing the border at International Falls, traveling to, for example, Nestor Falls or Sioux Falls, staying overnight, and flying out in the a.m. Another route to NW Ontario fly-ins involves traveling up the North Shore of Minnesota, crossing the border and, for example, traveling to Armstrong, and flying out from there. And that's just a few! As I said, there are dozens, if not hundreds, of excellent outfitters in Sunset Country. My favorite outfitter: Nestor Falls Fly-In Outposts: Top of the line fishing, excellent cabins. Have lost track of the honest 100 fish days I have had at Larus Lake or Onepine. They do have an outpost at Keeper Lake that only requires a group size of 4, but there are a few other outfitters on the lake--you will seldom see them. I have caught pike up to 42"" fishing for walleye. Full disclosure, I seldom fish for the big pike. I catch enough 30-35"" pike on jig and plastics to consider them pests. Dave and Michelle are the best. Their customer service is top of the line. Their outpost cabins are very, very clean. Go to their site, you will see what I mean. http://www.nestorfalls.com I have also flown with Mattice Lake Outfitters, Showalter's, and Brace Lake Outfitters. IMO, the time of year you visit will affect your success more than the lake/outfitter you choose. And your budget, of course, will narrow things down, as well. Good luck, and have fun with the process!"
6549738,adempsey2.0,2021-04-12 20:39:00,611,"You didn't mention if you were looking for a lodge or outpost. There are a lot of logging roads and trails to native communities throughout Ontario. It will be hard to avoid this. Some areas definitely have far more active logging though and the regulations are limited where they can log within 1 kilometer (I believe) of the lake. Certainly fewer roads as you go further west and north. Many outfitters will not take only 2 people (unless you pay for 4), but some do. However, it is always worth contacting the outfitters because they may be able to fit you in between flights etc.. I think if you want to increase your chances at bigger fish (25""+ Walleye and 40""+ Pike) you should try to find larger bodies of water with varied structure and plan your trip in the spring or fall. For numbers, I would recommend a lake with some good inflowing rapids/falls. Although, that may violate your 2-3lb rule. Off the top of my head, Slate Falls Outposts and North Caribou Camps are worth checking out. The outfitters mentioned by Michigan Walleye Guy are also top notch."
6549786,Eckohlt,2021-04-13 03:36:00,3685,Your price range will pretty much determine where you go?
6549804,Skywagon,2021-04-13 05:23:00,1106,"To fish in an area that has no old, or new logging roads/cuts within miles of the lake will be a tough one, it will require (as a rule of thumb) going pretty far north, draw an imaginary line between Pickle Lake and Red Lake and beyond, think north of there. The rules for logging have gotten lax, they can now log within hundreds of feet of a lake with an outpost camp, compared to the time that it was generally accepted that logging would be out of line of site from the lake. The new catch name the logging companies and politicians use is the ""Commercial Forest"", the forester for the local mill told me a few years ago that they plan on eventually logging it all, very sad for us all. I have no specific outfitters to suggest contacting, but suspect (as suggested) North Caribou might possibly be an option, Slate Falls is a class act from what I have seen, but it is doubtful they have anything that fits your logging perimeter."

6549834,prov1800,2021-04-13 07:10:00,5010,As skywagon mentioned its tough not to fly over a logging road.Being very good friends with Wayne and Karla Clark from Clarks outposts.My wife and i have been very fortunate to experience a few remote outposts.They have some that are far away from any logging roads but best way is to find one that suits your needs is to do a Google earth search.Find a outpost and just see if there are any logging roads near it or not.The fishing would be fantastic at any lake you decide to go to.Definatly you would not see anyone while your there except one if there planes checking on you every couple of days.Some roads you might see are not logging but winter roads the natives use in winter only These roads are impassable in summer.
6549846,BarnDog,2021-04-13 07:28:00,14,"30 years of fly in fishing trips..but the last 23 years with one outfitter. I will be brief. Nestor Falls Fly In Outposts are AWESOME.

6549860,phishfearme,2021-04-13 08:02:00,1242,a group of 2-4 limits things a bit - especially on the bigger waters - outfitters usually require 6 people groups - but you could get into Kearns lake with thousand lakes outfitters (a lake that fits all your requirements) via their stonehouse lake cabin - a short portage to kearns. stonehouse is for 4 and the kearns cabin is for 6 - 10 people. see:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...ghlight=kearns phish
