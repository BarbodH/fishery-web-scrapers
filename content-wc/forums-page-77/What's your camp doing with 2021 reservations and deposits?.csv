6552062,bigwalleye1,2021-04-19 12:33:00,2632,"I hate to reprise an old thread on this, so since we're faced with another similar year, and possibly new circumstances/decisions, and since I did see someone indicate they got the official word from their outfitter, it is with great sadness I ask: So what is your camp/lodge/outfitter doing with reservations for 2021 and deposits that were either new for 2021 or carried over from 2020?"
6552064,hoppy63,2021-04-19 12:37:00,367,"Kept deposit, we are reserved for same week next year."
6552196,Eckohlt,2021-04-19 17:39:00,3685,I'll go up this fall and use my deposit
6552212,Obabikon,2021-04-19 18:24:00,2370,Rolling all deposits until we are finally opened.

6552296,Eckohlt,2021-04-20 03:32:00,3685,"[QUOTE=RichA$1970;6552270]Sounds good,I talked to the outfitter told him I'll book when and if they allow big money back in the country to help people out that need it in the worse way"
6554410,bigwalleye1,2021-04-25 17:09:00,2632,"Just got the word from Frog Rapids Camp. While the website isn’t yet updated, Adele assured me the policy is the same as last year. If the border opens, and you’re comfortable going, your reservation is there. If you choose to roll over instead or if the border is closed, she will be rolling over deposits to next year. As a reminder, the opener is later next year so resultant rollover weeks will be a week later than they are this year."

6554628,tparker,2021-04-26 07:46:00,100,"Ian at Five Lakes Lodge moved our May week into September. If that doesn't happen, it rolls back over to May 2022."
6554638,Fisherman Ted,2021-04-26 07:58:00,461,Hawk Lake Lodge (me) is rolling everything forward** just like last year. Also existing reservations are locked in at the rate when booking (if the rates change in the future). And finally if you booked in 2019 or 2020 and had a child rate we will honor that rate even if they have crossed into a different category (e.g. booked in 2019 with a 14 year old at half price and they are now 16/17 and would be at a higher rate under normal years). Cheers -FT ** Note that the customer has to move the reservation to next year. As we don't have set check-in dates or length of stay its on them to determine the date of a future trip.
