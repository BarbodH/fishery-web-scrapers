6549854,prov1800,2021-04-13 07:49:00,5010,Have seen those there and a few on the lake.lol.
6547190,v-bay gord,2021-04-06 07:51:00,3168,Based on the fish I've cleaned over the years I see a lot more evidence of crayfish in the diet of walleye and pike.... I'm sure the bass are going to town over them as well. I know the otters love them too (based on the poop they leave on my docks!)
6547192,Bill Krejca,2021-04-06 07:57:00,6107,"Small mouth and crappie were stocked in LOW in the 1920's, whether they hurt the native populated fish is hard to say, unless some kind of study was done(how?). I remember in the late 1940's catching a/many small mouth was not quite as common as today. Crappies were well established at that time. My uneducated opinion is that the introduction did not cause another species to significantly suffer. Nor did the unannounced entrance of large mouth during the late 1970's/early 1980's seemingly cause the detriment of other species. Detriment of the find? of small mouth causing portions of walleyes to become infertile has not gotten recent publicity of which I am aware. Bill"
6547202,prov1800,2021-04-06 08:21:00,5010,As far as grayfish go there seem to be plentyof natural ones as well as the rusty grayfish which seems to be spread all over Eagle as well.We seem to catch more of those down by the east end of the lake and as you can see a couple of pike we had for a shorelunch really seem to enjoy them as well.The rusties being invasive in that system.

6547450,prov1800,2021-04-06 20:47:00,5010,The rusties are good eating and larger
6549800,JSev1,2021-04-13 05:04:00,57,"This is really interesting to me. I haven't been Eagle in a couple years due to the pandemic but I was told by a couple guides a few years back that the Rusties were on the west side and ""eating their way"" east, ie, the cabbage. I know one of my favorite cabbage beds on the north shore of Strawberry Island hadn't cabbage on the rocky spot in years, but there was still good uneaten cabbage further east, like around the eastern shore of Big Eagle Bay. I am hopeful that the walleyes and smallies are putting a dent in the population. Eventually either the rusties run out of food (cabbage stalks) or the fish win. That typically happens in cycles in many smaller lakes in Northern Wisconsin for example. I've heard that the smallie population in Eagle is taking advantage of all the crayfish but i've never fished for them."
6549822,prov1800,2021-04-13 06:37:00,5010,All the species in Eagle Lake are taking advantage of the rusty smorgasbord.I doubt they are putting a dent in the population as they are so well established lake wide which happens to be around 65 mi long.Rusties mainly target weed beds that grow in sand conditions leaving the mud weeds alone.The weed beds they eat do grow bad.Ive seen what they can do being a muskie fisherman.They can completely wipe out some really good muskie spots.Every fish I've caught in tgexway of table fare has had them in their bellies.Iam sure muskies will be feeding on them to.
6549832,v-bay gord,2021-04-13 07:07:00,3168,"A few years back the MNR came out with a map of Eagle showing the distribution of rusty crayfish based on some sampling studies they had done. The biggest hotspot was Vermilion Bay, with a smaller pocket in Temple Bay. I find that once you get out of Vermilion Bay the weed beds seem pretty normal heading east. The last couple years I have been seeing some weeds coming back in Vermilion Bay...not to their original extent but a partial recovery. This seems especially the case in spots where there is a lot of otter activity. I don't see a difference in sand or muck bottoms, but sand could be a poorer growing environment and hence the first habitat to be denuded. I will say the removal of weed beds seemed to coincide with a noticeable reduction in the pike population...or at least the ability to catch them. The last couple years I've seen a bit of an explosion in the population of small pike which perhaps indicates some adaptation going on...or a gradual reduction of the crayfish population to a more stable level. On some rainy days I've seen rusty crawfish moving across the lawn, so likely they can get into other water bodies on their own."
6549838,prov1800,2021-04-13 07:14:00,5010,Interesting you seen them on your lawn.
6549852,v-bay gord,2021-04-13 07:47:00,3168,I also see pink flamingos on my lawn...
6546908,runuts2,2021-04-05 11:39:00,25,Is there verification of crappie making their way into Eagle? Seen some photos from lodges on the lake with beautiful fish but they could be from trips to surrounding lakes.
6546948,v-bay gord,2021-04-05 13:24:00,3168,I can verify one being caught two summers ago.
6546982,prov1800,2021-04-05 15:33:00,5010,I guide quite a bit on the east end of Eagle and personally have not caught one.I have heard some rumors of some getting caùght but rùmors are rumors.Some one iam sure will try to introduce them or have.There are other lakes now that have started seeing some.The most northern lake i get them in for the last 10 years seems to do quite well and dont see any decline of the orher species
6546996,v-bay gord,2021-04-05 16:30:00,3168,This is an Eagle Lake crappie....
6547130,prov1800,2021-04-06 05:22:00,5010,That's interesting.
6547160,runuts2,2021-04-06 06:44:00,25,"If there's one, then there has to be more right?"
6547162,Mojo-NC,2021-04-06 06:44:00,1929,"When fish such as crappie begin to establish a population within a lake that ""normally"" doesn't have any, are they considered an invasive species and do they have a negative effect on the lake's ecosystem? The lake where we normally fish in NW Ontario does not typically have smallmouth bass. However, we caught one on our last trip up there and the lodge owners requested that we keep any we catch rather than releasing them. I can only assume that the introduction of smallies would have a negative impact on the walleye population of the lake."
6547170,Obabikon,2021-04-06 07:03:00,2370,"Smallmouth bass are not native to most of NW Ontario. They are thick in Lake of the Woods, but were stocked there when the trains started going through. I would say they are ""invasive"", but that word has a negative connotation. I view invasive as: not originally from the area. Small mouth have a very nice balance in most of the lakes they are in."
6547178,v-bay gord,2021-04-06 07:35:00,3168,"I'm not a biologist but I'm thinking a crappie would make a nice light snack for the muskies in Eagle Lake. I think the term invasive species is used more often when eradication is the goal. ""Non native species"" is probably a better term...it recognizes that while they are not native, there may be a neutral or positive benefit which counterbalances whatever damage they may do. That said, people should not be transferring species into new water bodies."
6547180,runuts2,2021-04-06 07:38:00,25,It'd be nice if they ate rusty crayfish. &#x1f31d;
