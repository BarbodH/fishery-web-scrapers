6550720,FishinFreaks,2021-04-15 10:20:00,386,"Where do you find that info? This may hijack the thread a little, but if an American wants to take a mortgage on a Canadian cottage, what's the process?"
6550788,Skywagon,2021-04-15 13:16:00,1106,"A 1.5% interest rate sounds attractive, but you have to realize that Gord was not telling the whole story, Government rates and what the average consumer pays are entirely two different things. You will find after everything is factored in, that long term mortgage rates in Canada are currently not much different than the US (Google can answer all your questions about rates). My guess (and only a guess) is that most Canadian lending institutions would only finance a small % at best, unless you have other assets in Canada that the lending institution can hold the paper on. Another thing to consider is the cost of converting US currency to Canadian, the published exchange rates do not include the cost of the transaction, it is a crazy amount percentage-wise for what amounts to be no more than a click of the mouse in a millisecond."
6550794,v-bay gord,2021-04-15 13:24:00,3168,"I never tell the whole story, but I had nothing to do with that one....."
6551010,Skywagon,2021-04-16 05:01:00,1106,"Gord, I apologize for attributing that to you, with all this isolation going on I am starting to hallucinate."
6551088,v-bay gord,2021-04-16 07:49:00,3168,I was just disappointed it wasn't a more controversial comment....
6551266,Larry S,2021-04-16 14:23:00,665,As of Today One US Dollar = 1.33 Canadian!
6551268,Wallychowder,2021-04-16 14:29:00,1567,I come up with 1.25..........not that its going to matter .......&#x1f602;
6551310,Skywagon,2021-04-16 16:45:00,1106,Here is a site to use https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/ you can convert either way. Don't forget the conversion fee you will be charged.
6551314,RichA$1970,2021-04-16 16:55:00,1159,Since the ice out contest is really a non factor this year maybe it should be guess the exchange rate when the border opens. The way we print money in the states Iâ€™d hate to guess what it will be.
6551326,Wallychowder,2021-04-16 17:34:00,1567,That might be a tough one ! Thats going to be probably a year from now !
3386418,Downrigger,2014-12-22 16:10:00,60,"I wish I was not over 60, but that is another post.For you kids I still think the advantages are there. While I can't swear to it, My guess is that you may have a maintenance fee on the account, but that and the check cost should be it. You would still get immediate credit on deposits, a good exchange rate, no fee for the exchange, the use of a debit card (no fee) thus limiting the use of checks. I would suggest you contact the bank, get cost information, and compare that to gains of exchange rate, if any, and convenience of use and see if it may be worth it to you. PM me if you would like a contact name.Phil"
3386618,LOW1,2014-12-22 17:18:00,2828,"We have had a an account with a Canadian credit union for years for the reasons suggested by Downrigger. No fees if $1000 ($850 US) kept in it - they pay the same minisscule interest on the balance as does a US bank.If you are in northwest Ontario, check out or Google Copperfin Credit Union. I am sure there are others as well, although there are not many Canadian banks and they tend to have offices in only the larger towns. You may want to figure out who is closest to the area you travel to."
6542050,Obabikon,2021-03-23 08:57:00,2370,For the record... and those who see this old thread that popped back up... I would not put any type of wager that the Canadian economy will bounce back faster/stronger than the US in the next 36 months. Just stating my opinion.
6542976,Aspencreek,2021-03-25 13:14:00,2911,well said!
6544038,Guest,2021-03-28 17:39:00,0,Sept 18 2002 the US buying exchange rate was 1.63CAD to get 1 USD
6544148,Larry S,2021-03-29 07:04:00,665,As of today exchange rate is 1.26 Canadian to US dollar
6544210,Wallychowder,2021-03-29 08:46:00,1567,Not to good !
6544350,Obabikon,2021-03-29 14:48:00,2370,"I would say the exchange rate is pretty darn close to where it should be, and pretty darn close to the 40 year average.1980 - 1.201985 - 1.40 1990 - 1.20 1995 - 1.402000 - 1.452005 - 1.252010 - 1.02015 - 1.252020 - 1.35Historically... I would say 1.25 is pretty close to the average."
6544360,Wallychowder,2021-03-29 15:20:00,1567,"yeah i guess thats not terrible, hopefully when and if the border opens it will be hovering around 1.40"
6546852,LoDo,2021-04-05 10:00:00,721,I didn't realize home loans in CND were hovering around 1.5%.
3356458,Andre (wallyandre),2014-12-10 03:56:00,2274,I do remember very well. Was going to the US every week-end and was buying US $ and it was $1.60Can. To buy 1$ us. If the gaz stay at the actual price and metals continue to fail the american money will be stronger and our (Can) will continue to go down.
3357346,55walleyes,2014-12-10 12:42:00,131,All funds are quoted in American Dollars.

3358450,Manitou,2014-12-10 19:50:00,125,"Here's a little foreign exchange tip. Buy Canadian traveller's cheques at your AAA or at CAA here in Canada.If you belong to AAA check out their exchange rate because they don't charge a fee like the bank does for the exchange, and they have the best rate.At least that's what we found at our local CAA.We researched this up here in Winnipeg because my wife gets paid in US money from a US based employer."
3358826,Skywagon,2014-12-11 05:52:00,1106,"Manitou, you have a PM."
3363106,Aspencreek,2014-12-12 16:48:00,2911,"I sure do. I bought all my groceries, bait, etc in CA, except for my tackle and clothes. I even bought some sweatshirts and a couple polar fleece that were on sale at the bait shop. That extra 40% discount was a bonus when I got my credit card bill. I'm still wearing those too."
3366442,zeebee,2014-12-14 15:44:00,1144,"As long as oil prices keep falling, the CDN$ will weaken"
3366746,vteye,2014-12-14 18:04:00,812,I live near the Canadian border and in 2000 built a modular colonial.A cousin is a builder and walked me through all the details. Exchange was 1.45 to 1.48 the summer I built.
3366890,rockrunner,2014-12-14 18:48:00,205,"They say the price of oil has effected our Canadian Loonie. We're definitely paying more for U.S currency and it wasn't that long ago we were close to par but I live in Northern Ontario and own a Suburban. This past summer and previous few years I have paid at times as much as $180.00 dollars to fill it with fuel. $160-$170.00 was quite common on payday Friday. Then I would pull ahead and top up the Lund Pro V and drop another $90.00-$110.00 weekly. We'll leave the rest of the expenses out of the equation. Any how, currently we can get our gas as cheap as $0.98 a litre and I think we're buying U.S currency at $0.17 on the dollar. It could be $0.18 on the dollar. Point being, the lower gas prices has been a nice financial break. I'm thankful I bought my boat when I did. It cost me $20.00 to exchange $25,000.00 in January 2013. Today it would be somewhere in the neighbourhood of $4,000.00 or more for the same $25,000.00. I wonder how many boats will be coming North across the border from the U.S. In 2015 and I wonder if the Gas prices will stay where they are by the Walleye Opener in May when they traditionally go up for no apparent reason other than it being the opener of Walleye and a long weekend."
3386322,Guest,2014-12-22 15:04:00,0,I really like this idea but I am not over 60
3352834,bigwalleye1,2014-12-08 11:57:00,2632,"Seems like in the past there's been a pretty even split between exchanging USD for CDN and paying in CDN vs just paying is USD, or using the charge card to run the exchange. For the ""cash option"" folks, now that the CDN buck is $0.86 against the USD, how many folks have thought about buying up CDN now in advance of trips next summer? Yah, I know there's the opportunity cost thing, but I've gotta say, $1140 CDN for a US $1000 (yah, there's the fee associated too, I know) seems pretty attractive right now. What say you??"
3352890,LOW1,2014-12-08 12:14:00,2828,"The difference between the buy rate and the sell rate may cut your gain somewhat If you think that the loonie has hit bottom, consider prepaying your outfitter in full. This may be cheaper than paying the buy rate and hoarding Canadian dollars. If gas/oil continues to fall you have to think that the loonie will fall with it, no?"
3352922,bigwalleye1,2014-12-08 12:28:00,2632,"Agreed re: buy rate vs sell rate, and advance payment or upping the downpayment is a great idea and avoids the handling fee at the bank as well. As gas/oil prices fall, history shows that the USD becomes stronger against foreign currencies. I'm watching, because we have other purchases like bait and boat gas daily that we make in CDN so I do like to carry some. Just wondered if others have thoughts/are considering."
3352962,Downrigger,2014-12-08 12:54:00,60,"I have a checking account with Bank of Montreal. Last year sent deposits (checks) to the bank prior to the trip. At time of deposits, bank did exchange and for most received $1.06 for each $US deposited. Staggered deposits to allow for possible fluctuations in rate. Will do the same for 2015. Also have a bank debit card so do not need Canadian currency on me. As a senior citizen, account is free to me except for the purchase of checks, which I needed to use few, due to the debit card. There is no maintenance fee on the account and I leave just a couple dollars over the winter months to keep it open. I also received immediate credit on the deposits even though it took 5 to 7 days to clear my bank in Arkansas."
3354466,roscoe33,2014-12-09 00:16:00,653,"Yeah, for the last 4 years or so. Before that, the USD has bad been worth substantially more. 1.20 1.30 1.40 12 years ago it was 1.56http://fxtop.com/en/historical-excha...DD2=09&LANG=en"
3354898,tv4fish,2014-12-09 07:43:00,2694,WOW - We've been going up since 1985 - I sure don't remember that 1.6173 difference back in 2002??????
3355586,55walleyes,2014-12-09 13:44:00,131,My outfitters 2015 rate is lower than 2014 rate. Is this because of the exchange rate or lower fuel costs or both?
3355722,Fisherman Ted,2014-12-09 14:44:00,461,The USD should only get stronger compared to the Loonie.
3356362,Phil T,2014-12-09 22:28:00,4820,The Canadian $ should be strong as long as we in the US buy so much of your tar sand oil.
3356402,roscoe33,2014-12-09 23:32:00,653,"Hmmm, maybe they were quoting in CA $, and have now switched to price quotes in US $."
