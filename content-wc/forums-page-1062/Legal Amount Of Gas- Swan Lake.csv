508902,Guest,2000-07-03 06:49:00,0,I will be heading up to the Minaki area July 21st.I can't remember how much gas I can legally bring across the border with me. Is it so much per man? Two of us our going up with my boat I want to take as much as I legally can 10 to 20 gallons. Our camp has gas but they ran out before and I just want to have a little insurance. Anybody fished Swan Lake west of Minaki? Is it real low this year? Whats working? Thanks in advance.

As far asgas, I crossed the boarder at International Falls and they did not even ask me about it. I have been to Canada many times with several gallons of gas and have never had to pay duty on it. FYI- the fishing was great!!!!!!"
508904,Guest,2000-07-03 17:49:00,0,"The amswer to your question is as follows...You can legally have what ever your boat gas tank will hold (internal or external) and what your vehicle gas tank can hold. Therefore any extra/spare gas in ""jerry cans"" is not acceptable. In the 15+ trips up there I have only been questioned twice concerning ""extra gas"". This year with gas so expensive I took 20 extra gallons across the border without being questioned. Shoot, should of filled the 2 other cans!"
