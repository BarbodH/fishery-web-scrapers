508753,Homer,2000-06-26 07:55:00,1127,"Went a week and a half ago targeting walleyes, but only hooked a couple of steelhead and a bunch of sheephead. Lots of commercial nets out.I don't know anything about salmon out of Erieau. We've caught the occasional king, but only by accident.W.r.t charters, Captain Steve, who was king of hill at Erieau moved this year to Lake Ontario. I don't know if the move was prompted by the recent downturn in walleye fishing there or not."
508754,Guest,2000-06-29 02:54:00,0,"Thanks for the reply Homer. We bagged 6 steelies last year, no walleye or salmon. Was hoping to do better this year. Maybe we'll go to Ludington."
508755,Guest,2000-06-29 05:19:00,0,"We've done out last annual trip from Western Michigan to Erieau last September. The days seem to be gone where you can bag a lot of big 'eyes with reasonable effort. We ended up targeting Steelies about 10 miles East of Erieau...and did great, took 9 Steelies and 1 4# 'eye. (The charters were calling walleyes ""exotic species"".)Great steelheading though, but not as big as lake Michigan!Good luck!"
