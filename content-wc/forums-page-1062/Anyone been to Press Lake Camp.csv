508892,Iowa Eye,2000-07-02 07:56:00,104,Thinking about a late sept trip and was wondering if anyone has been to Press Lake camp near Ignace ON? #####://www.presslake.on.ca/accomm.html.Comments on the fishing and accomidations would be appreciated.Thanks
508893,BD,2000-07-02 22:39:00,739,I was there last Oct. We encountered terrible weather. Even so the fishing was good. The camp is well kept. A couple of the guys I was there with last fall are up there now. They took their wives so it has to be a nice place (or else!). The last 13 miles in is via an old logging road so take it easy. Plan on having several fish-fries; but there is also the chance that the weather will be really bad so don't go without some ham or steaks for backup. The in camp store is limited to a few items and you don't want to make that 13 mile drive to the main road more that you need to. Have fun!
