508077,Guest,2000-07-05 08:47:00,0,"Email me for more info.Red Pine Narrows is good area, but if you aren't staying near there (this in near the Laniel side of the lake) you won't want to run that far. This is a very big lake. We fish the Laniel side of the lake.There are no bass in the lake that we know of. There are rumors of a couple being caught in the Kipawa side but nothing confirmed.Pike can be difficult. The lake's level is fiddled with right when the pike are normally spawning which makes for inconsistent pike year classes. The numbers aren't huge, but there is quality if you fish deeper rocky areas. We have been catching some smaller (<30"") pike in better numbers in recent years in/near the typical pike-looking bays.If I don't respond to your email right away it's becasue I'll be leaving for the lake 7/6 and won't get back 'til 7/17."
