I've got 1,000 worms on order and don't want to lose them to customs. Lake of the Woods in less than 5 days, literally praying that the weather stabilizes."
508849,fishinnut,2000-06-29 10:49:00,642,Should be OK; as long as it's not dirt you shouldn't be bothered. I'm going up to Whitefish Bay tomorrow and bringing 500 myself.
508850,Robert,2000-06-29 12:10:00,19,"Jim,I asked about this earlier, and was told you can only bring worms in in ""SOIL"", e.g., not bedding. I'm going to LOW in 2 days too. By the way, I keep losing my worms in bedding because it's too wet, or warms up too much from the bio-mass, while in a cool room. How do ou keep em alive?Good luck fishing."

508853,Guest,2000-06-29 13:37:00,0,I have used magic worm bedding to take crawlers to Canada for years. I have been checked several times at the border and never any problems other than the delay in time. I use the refreezable cold packs for travel and to keep the crawlers in good shape for the week I'm in Canada. I usually have crawlers left out of the flat I take up there. Good Luck!

508854,Guest,2000-06-29 20:12:00,0,"I just was just in Canada from 6/17 thru 6/24.I had my worms in Buss bedding. Told the border guard that we had them in Buss bedding, and they never looked at them.I keep my crawlers in an old coleman cooler on my basement floor. I keep 2 half gallon jugs frozen with water on them at all times. While in Canada, I kept them in the shade."
508855,Guest,2000-07-03 00:51:00,0,I keep mine in a plastic ziploc bags in my boat. They last a long time too. No problems and I even use some the next year.
508856,Guest,2000-07-04 09:17:00,0,"Hi Guys,I'm from Ontario and keep worms for months using the best mother has to offer, Moss that is found in almost anywoods in north america and a refrigerator will keep your crawlers alive and healthy for years, and yes ziplock bags with a bit of moss in it and kept in a cooler on ice, but be careful when you reach in for one to bait your hook, moss fed worms are ""aggresive"". Best of luck fishing, Big Al."
