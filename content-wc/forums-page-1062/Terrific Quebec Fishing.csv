508733,Guest,2000-06-29 03:23:00,0,"Bruce We were in cabin #2. You were the ones who brought the boats? How'd you fare coming out of the bush? Rough ride. I broke down once coming out. I was with the guide Ernie, giving him a lift home. My fuel pump gave up at the long bridge coming out. Had to get towed out. Got to spend three nights in beautiful downtown Maniwaki watching TV (nothing but educational shows about flowers and cheese.) $600 later (US), I literally kissed the ground when I crossed the border at Ogdensburg. Considering the fishing and accommodations at O'Sullivan...it was worth it. I suppose we shouldn't be building this place up too much or we'll have trouble making reservations next year."
508726,Guest,2000-06-29 08:12:00,0,"I'll second all of Pete's comments. Brad and Ginny are top notch hosts, the lake is maybe a notch down from them. Give it your best, then judge for yourself. There are better lakes in the area, but all can be influenced by timing and weather to some degree."
508734,Guest,2000-06-29 08:20:00,0,"Yes, that was us with our two boats. Sorry to hear about your travel troubles. I bet it was good to have ernie there to lend a hand. Maybe we'll see you next year. Until then, have good fishing!!"
508735,Guest,2000-07-01 21:10:00,0,"Since you went fishing in Quebec, could you please tell me how that fish (Walleye) is called in French, PLEASE? I need that name for a translation, and I got all kinds of information, including a picture of that fish, but I have no idea how it is called in French."
508736,Guest,2000-07-01 22:25:00,0,DORE--------That's what walleye are called in French Quebec....I think!!!
508737,Guest,2000-07-02 02:14:00,0,Dore...pronounced door-RAY.
508738,Guest,2000-07-03 10:45:00,0,"Quebec fisherman, Read your article and had to respond. Many times I have fished the area south of Val D' Or in the area known as Rapide VII in Cadilac, Quebec. Is this anywhere near where you fished. The proper name of the Lake was Reservoire Decelles, or Decelles Lake. My last trip, of which there were approx. 8 or 9 was in 1986. Fishing was always excellent Walleye and Northern. Please respond, am interested about the fishing camps in the area of Rapide VII as they have probably changed hands since last visit. Jim Puracchio, Mentor, Ohio"
508739,Guest,2000-07-03 18:19:00,0,"I'm requesting infomation on Fishing camps in the area mentioned in this post. Names, addresses, phone numbers. I've fished the Belleterre, Moffett, and Remingy areas. Still looking for that special lake and camp. Also, Canadian prices. Stayed this year at a camp that charged American dollars. This camp was no different than many others that I've stayed in, but due to the American prices I paid more for the same accomodations."
508740,Guest,2000-07-04 04:26:00,0,"O'Sullivan Lake Lodge offers American and Canadian rates. Without getting into details, I can tell you that counting cabin, license, beer, food, gas, tolls, bait and miscellaneous expenses, the entire week (travelling from Western New York) cost three of us less than $600 (US) per person. Because of the exchange rate (I suppose) the basic rates have remained stable for the past half dozen, or more years. You may contact O'Sullivan's web site: www.travel-net.com/~gagnon Good luck."
508741,Guest,2000-07-04 12:16:00,0,"fyi, if you do go to the O'Sullivan Lake Lodge website, the listed prices are in US$. I just wrote to them to confirm."
508722,Guest,2000-06-25 04:04:00,0,"Just got back from a Quebec trip (La Verendrye Park region) and the fishing was terrific. Average walleye was in the 19"" range and they were plentiful. Jigging and trolling worked well at various times. Of the 200, or so walleye we hooked, all but 15 were released. The pike fishing was pretty good, as well. Caught about 120, all of which were released, including two 10+ lbs. and one monster of 44"" that weighed 25lbs. and still swims today! Thanks, Quebec, for yet another outstanding vacation! Anyone interested in lodge info, post your request on this site and I'll get you the details. Wow!"
508723,Jim,2000-06-25 07:33:00,238,Ever fish a lake called Ogascanan north of Kipawa? Am going there in 2 weeks. Could use some tips...
508724,Guest,2000-06-25 12:00:00,0,"Sorry...never fished that particular lake...however, there are many similarities to all these lakes...I've fished west of where you describe as well as east...the water is dark and lends itself to gold/yellow color lures. Blue also seems to be effective. Generally we troll to locate active fish, then work jigs & crawlers. Curly tail white or yellow in the smallest size you can get away with is very effective. Since the water is dark, heavier line is ok and acts as a bit of insurance against bite-offs from pike. Good lures for trolling seem to be Rapala (#5 to #11) and Thundersticks. Tried Reef Runner Ripsticks and never got a touch. Bring some weedless spoons (Johnson Silver Minnow, silver and gold, 1/2 oz. is my favorite) and cast for pike in the weeds and dead wood. I like to add yellow Uncle Josh Bass Strips and use an irregular retrieve. Killer!!! Tons of hits, follows and hook-ups. The black flies were murder last week but should be pretty much burned off if the weather warms. (Here come the mosquitoes!) Good luck. Let us know how you did and fill us in on your accommodations."
508727,Guest,2000-06-26 07:59:00,0,"Wall-nut- What lake did you fish and where did you stay? I just got back from Quebec on sat. the 24th. We fished the Gouin Res. Did ok. Drove all the way through La Verendrye on Rt 117. Saw lots of bodies of water,but I never knew which ones to fish. Thanks in advance for your response! Scoot"
508728,Guest,2000-06-26 18:50:00,0,"We fished O'Sullivan Lake which is located just northeast of LaVerendrye, about 90 miles up the Clova Rd off Rt. 117. We've been going there since 1980. It has rarely disappointed. The fishing is great for walleye, northern and lake trout. It also offers bear hunt and moose hunt packages. The main camp offers outstanding accommodations, including cabins with full indoor facilities and electricity. A guided day trip to a catch and release trophy lake is available in which northern of over 30 lbs. have been hooked. You may also opt for one of the two outpost camps which offer outstanding fishing for pike and walleye. I speak from personal experience. They do have a website which can be accessed at: www.travel-net.com/~gagnon The Gouin is ""big water"" as the natives tell us. O'Sullivan is quite manageable. It's about 20 miles long with the typical Laurentide structure elements (islands, bays, sandbars, rocks and weedbeds) It has earned a very good reputation. I recommend it with confidence. There are plenty of other outfitters in the park and the park perimeter as well. Good luck."
508725,Guest,2000-06-26 19:33:00,0,"Jim- we were up to this lake last september for a week and to be perfectly honest-we did not fare to well. 2 of us ended up with 53 wallies for the week!!! None were any size but released about all except a few for a couple dinners. The lodge owners Brad and Ginny are great people and I would like to give it another try next year. Some others I know have been going up there in July every year for a long time and do real well but they have been up there many many times.Its a beautiful lake. We took our own boat up but don!t think we would again-the road is the PITS!!! To say the least.Where are you from? I am from western NY. Any mor info I can help you with,let me know. Pete"
508729,sweg,2000-06-28 11:12:00,7,"Fished ZEC Restigo lakes during the first week of June and we had a fantastic time. Lots of good fish including my 26"" 7 Lb. eye. a few in the 24 -23 inch range and pleanty in the 19 inch range. caught a lot of pike too. Mostly trolling Crankbaits over shallow humps and ledges leading to deep water We also found them in the weeds."
508730,Guest,2000-06-28 12:42:00,0,"Sweg,I have to pass by the Restigo ZEC check point on my way to Ogascanan on a bush road out of Temiscaming. Is this the same place? Ogascanan is 60 miles down the bush road from the convenience store/gas station at the start of the road. I know that Red Pine Chute is also close. Any tips as to what to use for walleye, pike or lake trout for this area? Depths? Colors? Rocks..weeds etc? Let me know. Thanks"
508731,Guest,2000-06-28 14:08:00,0,"Wall Nut,We were up at O'sullivan with you (Cabin #1)and i agree as to the wonderful fishing and accomodations. I didn't know you caught so many (and large) pike last week,in addition to the eyes. If you are who i think you are, thx again to you and your brother for the tips and general comraderie. Already looking forward to next year, or maybe even later this year when Ron is back up for an extended stay??!! Bruce"
508732,Guest,2000-06-28 14:33:00,0,I write to praise the obvious and not so obvious merits of an O'Sullivan Lake fishing trip. We all caught (five of us) plenty of Wally and scattered pike (not our desired quarry) and one of us nailed a couple nice Lakers. Would go back in a heartbeat and will next year. Lodge owners Russell and Stanley Gagnon run a first class operation and the Staff is unbelievably accomodating! Check it out.
