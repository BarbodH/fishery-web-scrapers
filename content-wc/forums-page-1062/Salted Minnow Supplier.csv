Go to your local bait shop & buy 1/2 gallon of large fathead minnows and visit the grocery store and buy about 15# of pickling salt. In a five gallon bucket put down a layer of salt about 1/2"" deep. Put in a layer of minnows, cover with salt, and continue layering till all minnows are covered. Do this a week to 10 days before leaving. The night before you leave strain the minnows from the salt & package 3 dozen or so per zip loc bag. Keep refrigerated and catch plenty of fish. Last year on a fly in I did this and at first some of the guys wanted nothing to do with this salted bait but at the end nearly fought over the last bags."
