The people and food were great but the fishing was dissapointing!The water level was a foot and a half high and it stormed everyday. Our group was the only one to pull in walleyes, and it happened on the last 3 days. I would like to know how other people did on other lakes in Ontario during the same time period. Thanks"

Water level was highest it's been in a decade, and was still rising a couple inches a day with all the rain. Same weather, heavy rain and thunderstorms every day. Five-eigth inch hail during one storm. Fortunatly, was off the lake for that one. Fishing was excellent. Most over-slot walleyes caught in eight years. Biggest northerns. Old techniques didn't work. A jig and minnow fished SLOWLY on the bottom was the key last week."
