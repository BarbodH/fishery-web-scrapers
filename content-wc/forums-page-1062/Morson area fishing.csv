508889,Guest,2000-07-01 04:39:00,0,"For walleye look for humps off main points and on the numerious humps in the main lake. A fish finder will most helpful. Jig or troll theses areas with minnows. For whatever reason minnows seem to work the best in this part of the lake. Walleys ahve a light bite like a crappie, so light tackle will help. For smallies look along the shore lines for small boulders the size of a soft ball or larger. I have had the most luck with a crawfish style or crawfish color lure. Shad raps work extremly well. The northerns will be in the weeds especially around sandy beach areas. Overcast days with a sight breeze should get you some good results. For muskie you must make 10,000 casts so you better start early in the day. Smile!! Good luck!!!"
