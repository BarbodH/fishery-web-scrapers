Will we encounter long lines at these times. What personal id is required if any. Drivers Liscense? Passport? Anything? Also heard that anyone with a prior DUI on their record had to get special permission from Canadian Customs to enter. This doesn't sound right. Has anyone else heard anything like this?

Falls, but I crossed backand forth last weekend at baudette and they did'nteven ask many questions, they just wanted to know where I was going and when I would be back thru-thats It- comming back, the U.S. agent Just askedhow fishing was an if I had anything to declare."
508840,KnottyBuoy,2000-06-29 06:11:00,110,I have crossed at Baudette and I-Falls this year and it has been almost pleasant.....they say Hi and everything....When you cross you should have at least a drivers license.......never been asked for any other ID.....( birth certificate or passport) Never heard anything about DUI's......they check every license number as you pull up......may be a cross reference there somewhere......
508841,DRP,2000-06-29 13:19:00,83,"A DUI is considered a felony in Canada. If anyone in your group admits to having one on their record, they will likely not be allowed to enter. This will most likely only happen if they perform a thorough search at customs. Good luck.."

Also, if both parents are not present, I have been told that it doesn't hurt to have a letter from the non present parent stating that they know the whereabouts of their child.I also was told to make sure you have copies of titles, which I did.When we went in on the 17th at I-falls, they never asked to see anything.Have a good trip."
508843,Guest,2000-06-30 06:37:00,0,It's also a good idea to have a letter from your insurance agent stating that you are insured while driving in Canada. Just about every insurance agent has a letter already made up. He'll just insert your name where needed.
508844,Guest,2000-06-30 21:34:00,0,"Good point. My insurance agent told me about it, since I wasn't driving I told my buddy who was and his agent gave him a Canadian card. My agent said if you have an accident, they will hold you in jail until proof of insurance arrives."
508845,Guest,2000-07-01 01:05:00,0,"Hey Fritz,I don't think you'll go to jail for not having proof of insurance but you can expect a fine.Something else you might want to look into is travel insurance,for medical reasons(accidents,heartattacks,sickness,allthat sort of stuff)It cost us Canucks about $2.00 a day/per person when we travel south of the border.If you are perpared,you will enjoy your trip all the more.Good luck man and have fun."
