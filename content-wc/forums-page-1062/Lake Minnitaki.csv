I've been going to Minnitaki for 20+ years and the fishing seems to be better with the slot limits and the lower limits.My hats off to Canada for keeping the fishing laws the way they are. Too bad the States can't do as well.Good Luck Fishing!!!!!!!! C.J."

Still not as high as four years ago.Talked with one of the guides the evening before we flew to our outpost and he had fished Minnitaki that day and did really good trolling a spinner rig with minnow. Fairly large wally's. I casually went down to the dock where is boat was tied up and seen a number of gumdrop jigs on about three foot snell. He also told me he used three ways, all with minnows.Keep the bobber bobbing and the hook in the water."
