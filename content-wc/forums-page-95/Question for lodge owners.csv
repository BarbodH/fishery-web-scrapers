This is a tough situation for camp owners to have to deal with and with no fault of their own. There are going to be some lifelong dreams and plans destroyed. I pray everyday this thing comes to a quick end."
6431554,BornToFish,2020-04-30 07:28:00,1224,"Greetings, I have been thinking about the upcoming season quite a bit of late. There are so many variables in Canada and the US that may impact the date that the US and Canada border crossings open. One thing that is certain is that the borders will eventually open - hopefully sooner rather than later. I understand that many owners of fishing lodges are residents of the USA, while other lodge owners are residents of Canada. Some of these lodge owners chime in from time to time on Walleye Central. I have a question for these lodge owners. How long does it typically take from when you start opening your lodge to being ready to receive guests? I'm assuming that the lodge owners/staff are not fighting the weather the entire time of opening the lodge. The reason that I ask is that some anglers might think that their lodge will be ""open for business"" on day one of the border being open, when in reality it might take a while for lodge owners (especially American lodge owners starting up from ""scratch"") to have their lodge ready to open. I thought it might be helpful for anglers to not have false expectations of their lodge and its owners. Your thoughts? Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6431568,Obabikon,2020-04-30 08:01:00,2370,"Obviously, every camp and every ownership situation is going to be different. The fastest I have gotten our camp going is 6 days. Theoretically, it should take 3 days. However, things break and must be repaired. The average time is probably closer to 10 days. Boats take a lot of time, water can be fast or take days (depending on if there's under ground frozen spots or broken pipes). If you're an outpost camp, that has an entire different set of challenges in getting started. As far as being ready to go day 1... I would guess that most resorts can. Even if they are US citizens, and can't cross. They usually have staff that can get the camp ready. Also, I would expect some exemptions to start happening before the border goes wide open. (like if you own a business). All that being said, personally, I am a dual citizen, and I am allowed to cross the border today if I wished. However, my wife and kids would have to stay home. While it is tempting to go up, and I certainly have the itch... I enjoy being married. If I left her at home, by herself during quarentine... bachelor life isn't the life for me."
6431594,Fisherman Ted,2020-04-30 08:49:00,461,"48 hours after I cross the border I can have a boat in the water, cabin ready to go, steak on the grill and beer on tap. But that is REALLY pushing it. This year staffing is going to become an issue with timing. If we don't open until August some may not be available and its not like they can all show like turning on a light switch. The timing will be tricky here for everything. But the border opening is not the only issue. There are likely going to be strict social distancing rules and other protocols in place. This will require new training, procurement of tools/disinfectants, installation at or modifications to the lodges/planes you name it. For example, if you have a sold out camp and do full American plan I imagine your dining is going to have to be modified, significantly. Same goes for housekeeping. All areas of the business where there are common touch points. It could be a logistical nightmare. -FT"
6431622,BornToFish,2020-04-30 09:30:00,1224,"Greetings, Obabikon and Ted: Thanks for your prompt replies! I had already thought of a few of the potential concerns that you mentioned. You guys mentioned several potential concerns that I hadn't considered. I guess Murphy's law is always in play for owners of fishing lodges: if it can go wrong, sooner or later it will. Let's hope that we are all fishing soon. Kindest regards...."
6431800,3M TA3,2020-04-30 18:51:00,2846,"I think that lodge owners would be communicating any hurdles directly with a client that has already made reservations. Perhaps many owners are waiting and doing a ""wait see"" but once they've decided I'm positive the good ones will be contacting those affected. And if you feel that you just can't wait for the word then give them a call. I'm thinking they will have a few minutes to talk with you. The good ones, that is."
6431828,RichA$1970,2020-04-30 20:36:00,1159,"When it does open I hope everyone going up totally understand that there will be some issues and may have to deal with it. I think when I first started with a canvas tent, 12â€™ boat and 5 hp Elgin and those memories where awesome even though it had some challenges. Enjoy the lake, fishing and nature and if you have a roof over your head, a shower and wood stove that is more than enough for me."
6432424,v-bay gord,2020-05-01 07:09:00,3168,"I've generally brought back whatever staff I might have at the beginning of May....so two or three weeks getting things done. I don't think I've ever had an opening where it didn't involve finishing some major projects or reno's, unexpected repairs and annual maintenance. Getting water on is dependent on weather. Opening has gone smoother the longer we've owned, since ""problems"" get corrected over time and new construction is more reliable and easier to maintain. I suppose if you didn't have the luxury of that much lead time then you would adjust the operation accordingly."

6433230,martinbns,2020-05-03 21:04:00,1520,Ontario and most other Canadian provinces still have a 14 day isolation requirement even if you are coming from another province. Here in Manitoba no one can't go north of the 53rd parrallel. The border isn't close to being open and likely won't be any time soon. I can't even put my boat in the marina yet in Kenora. I suspect the first month plus of the season will be effectively closed to non-residents of Ontario or Manitoba.
6436630,ProFishingGuide,2020-05-10 22:31:00,6,"About 5-10 years ago my parents(American camp owners) opened to 30 people after a late ice-out in 8 days at fly in with an all-star repeat staff. The real question you should ask is that if camps can afford to open after losing out on the busiest month of the year, June."
