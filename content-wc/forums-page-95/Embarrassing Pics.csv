One of our guys took a big chug of undiluted moonshine after dinner one evening in Canada. I'm not going to say who provided it. A few minutes later, he tried to put his foot up on a bench to tie his shoes, and fell right down. We claim he was struck by lightning, ""white lightning"" that is..."
6433404,pjshorthorn,2020-05-04 11:29:00,5654,At least your trip member had the sense to wait until after dinner. Guys I have gone on trips with would take a shine to a breakfast swig or two or three to get the day started.... PjShorthorn
6434078,Matcaz,2020-05-05 09:54:00,22,"Not embarrassing for me, but perhaps it will be for my son one day. He caught his first northern pike, in the rain. We didn't want to buy him rain gear he would grow out of in a year so he wore an oversized poncho and a trash bag for pants. After showing him the pike's teeth, he wasn't about to hold the fish either LOL"
6433030,rockpt,2020-05-03 00:47:00,589,"Here's another pic of the cedar strip boat. I had a broken shoulder in this pic, but I didn't know it. That's another story.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...ictureid=52558"
6433054,RichA$1970,2020-05-03 06:52:00,1159,A buddy of ours used a bag from his wife for one trip and as we were unpacking he felt something in a side pocket of the bag and low and behold pulled this out in front of us......as we were dying of laughter he was horrified on what she had in there.
6433200,muskyman73,2020-05-03 17:59:00,401,Was it on ?
6433206,RichA$1970,2020-05-03 18:23:00,1159,". The batteries were dead. That poor old guy had the 1,000 yard stare all week."
6433218,Indywest1,2020-05-03 19:20:00,7,My best practical joke ever - slapped the magnetic sticker on the back of my buddy's truck as another one of our group was distracting him. He was headed from Ontario down to TN.
6433220,Whopper,2020-05-03 19:55:00,340,A good chance that cedar strip is a Giesler. Pretty popular boat in that area and were built by three generations of the Giesler's
6433232,RichA$1970,2020-05-03 21:27:00,1159,That was awesome!!!!!
6433240,rockpt,2020-05-03 23:24:00,589,"Yep, it was a Giesler out of Powassan, Ontario.http://www.gieslerboats.ca/index.htm"
6433260,pjshorthorn,2020-05-04 04:50:00,5654,"I'm guessing he felt a bit inadequate the rest of the week. Man, they teach you in Husband 101 classes to never look in your wife's stuff......it never goes well. I hope no one asked him if he needed a cocktail after that discovery. ðŸ˜³ PjShorthorn"

6432792,rockpt,2020-05-02 01:35:00,589,"We all have them...those pics from Canada trips we wouldn't show our wives or friends. Here's one of me from sometime in the 1990s (memory gets fuzzy with age) standing on the dock of Tall Pines Camp on Lake Nipissing holding two very average sized fish. Note my tshirt tucked into my oversized shorts, my heavy wool socks (it's summertime) tucked into my Nike high tops, and give me extra credit for the 90s stache. Happy as a frog. Any takers?"
6432826,Wrktfsh,2020-05-02 06:28:00,492,More pics of the boat please. ðŸ¤£
6432848,Pooch,2020-05-02 07:50:00,4618,"That's about the same outfit (W/O the high tops and tall socks) that I wear all summer. Working, fishing and just going about life. At some point in life you do not give a rats azz what others think. Well...maybe other than my wife.You should have seen the lecture I received from Mrs. Pooch the first (and about last) time I sported a set of suspenders. Won't make that error again.Pooch"
6432878,NARDA 1,2020-05-02 09:14:00,636,"Me with my BIG catch, several years ago. One of my buddies got a hold of the picture and enlarged it and posted it in the lodge!"
6432888,That Minnesota guy,2020-05-02 10:05:00,8293,"Ditto, if that photo is from the 90's thats a very clean wood boat. More info please."

6432998,5 of Diamonds,2020-05-02 19:13:00,151,Our group often talks about that picture and how it should be on the front of some sort of greeting card...
6433006,muskyman73,2020-05-02 20:01:00,401,"You know how the beavers up there do a wonder on the logs/trees ? Well we found this one in the water, and gave it a "" tug "" and gave my cousin a wake up call"
6433028,rockpt,2020-05-03 00:39:00,589,"LMFAO muskyman! And the others, too. As for the boat, it's a cedar strip boat on Nipissing. I think they're only around that part of Ontario. They swell up and are pretty tight and very stable. But heavy as ****."
