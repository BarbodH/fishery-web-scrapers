While so close we took a side trip to the mouth of Route Bay, where the river flows in. The river is unusually low for this time of year, but still has plenty of water gushing out to open up the bay, the Bay was wide open with just a trace of ice along the far shore, the water appears to be about 4' lower than normal. The picture was taken from the mouth of the river facing north."
