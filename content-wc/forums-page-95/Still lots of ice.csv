There is still plenty of ice and I dont think guys will be able to get out with their boats. It was looking promising in march as the weather was beautiful but then april went to crap and may so far has really sucked. I've been on my days off for almost two weeks now and only had one real nice day at the very beginning and I go back to work for two weeks on Wednesday. Still dont have any of my boats ready at all.
