6433492,Skywagon,2020-05-04 17:31:00,1106,"Today I brought the boat and plane out of hibernation. Though most of the lake is still covered with ice, there is open water from my house on north for over 3/4 of a mile, plenty of room to run the boat around and enough distance to take off with the plane. After giving the dog a ride in the boat, there was time to take the bird out for a shakedown flight . The plane was almost full of gas, so on a whim I decided to run up to the cabin to check out the ice situation. The cabin is located between Sioux Lookout and Pickle lake, near the Miniss water system, 120 miles by road from home, or a little over 70 air miles, I can fly it in 50 minutes. When I flew over the cabin, most of the lake was still ice covered, but because of the water flowing out the end near the cabin, it was partially open, but not nearly enough room to land, so I took a picture and headed back home. The first picture is of the lake the cabin is on showing the water flow. The second picture is going over Lac Seul. Minitaki and most of the lakes of any size in that area are still ice covered with ice."

6433862,rockpt,2020-05-05 00:41:00,589,Great shots! Nice excursion for you. Thanks for posting.
6433946,Clairebear,2020-05-05 05:46:00,937,Thanks for the pictures and update. What a difference viewing from above. I fly a good quality drone and view from the sky completely changes what you're seeing. Wish I was in the cockpit with you.
6433952,Skywagon,2020-05-05 05:49:00,1106,"There was not a lot of wind when I left and it was blowing toward the ice, unlikely that ice floating in would be a problem, worst case I could find a small open lake with road access, land and use the sat phone to call for a lift. This morning (the next day) it would have been a different story, the wind shifted and the exit path is blocked."
6433982,AMPHIB206,2020-05-05 06:53:00,191,Or you can be like Hugh Carlson. Depart from the ice with floats to land on the water. He does it every year in Red Lake ON.

6434042,bigwalleye1,2020-05-05 08:49:00,2632,"Or, you could be like the guy local to me on Coon Lake, west of Soderville/Ham Lake MN, took off on land with wheels on the floats. Attempted a ""touch and go"" on Coon Lake....you guessed it.. Forgot to bring up the wheels. Caught and flipped. He was rescued by a lakeshore resident. Plane is upside down in the water, but going to be salvaged. Can you say ""operator error""?"
