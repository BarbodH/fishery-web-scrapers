6436750,eyecatcher1,2020-05-11 06:37:00,323,I've been going to that area for 28 years. We even stayed at Abram Lake Park from 97-14. You can catch walleyes from the dock there. What kind of info are you looking for?
6436894,sauvain,2020-05-11 10:43:00,63,"The chain of lakes that are available to fish on. Looking to do mostly walleye fishing, my wife and I really enjoy smallmouth fishing. Just any key spots or places to catch fish any information would be greatly appreciated. I've been doing flying trips to Birch lake out of ear falls for years, but now that the wife likes to go we're trying something new this year."
6436908,eyecatcher1,2020-05-11 10:59:00,323,"There always seems to be walleyes at the Abram Chute and Frog Rapids. Both are a short ride from the resort. You probably won't catch 100 a day there, but you'll have lunch or dinner fish. Minnitaki, Abram and Pelican all have decent walleye fishing. That time of the year I'd be looking for mid-lake structure. Just look for the rock piles on your map or GPS. Rocky points will hold fish too. I'd have to say that Minnitaki is probably the best of the three lakes I mentioned. You can get to Botsford Lake from Abram too, but I hear the it slows down in the summer. I've only fished it early in the season. If you want an amazing day head over to Lac Seul. The walleyes seem to be everywhere there. Not the same spot every day, but figure out the pattern and if you see fish on your sonar they are probably biting. On Lac Seul if you don't mind a boat ride the Bear Narrows area is really good as is Sen Bay. I hope this helps, feel free to ask for more info. Good Luck! My trip is June 13-27, so it doesn't look good for me right now."
