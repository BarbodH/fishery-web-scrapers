6435206,JSev1,2020-05-08 06:01:00,57,"Boy does that launch give make my stomach turn in knots. Along the lines of the post ""proof that you're human"".... Last summer, I was pulling my 1 month old 2025 Lund Impact out after a great week long stay at Andy Myers. I backed the trailer in while my buddy , finagled that ""L"" turn of the dock to try and line up the boat. Meanwhile, me being new to boat ownership, I took a poor angle backing in the trailer so that it was not perfectly parallel to the dock. We get the boat on the trailer a little after sunset, and I start to pull out and the **** right side wheels fall off the horizontal concrete ramp pilings and drop about 12 inches, bottoming out the axle on the launch. I then inch a bit forward and the ends of one of the u-bolts on the axle slide in BETWEEN two of the concrete pilings and it drops even further. OMG, I've never sweated so profusely and swore so much in my life. We tried jacking it up, that didn't work. Finally, we started gathering good size rocks and laying them in front of the tires and close to the height of the concrete. After some extremely nerve wracking acceleration of the gas pedal, the trailer popped onto the rocks, somehow the u-bolt popped out of the gap without shearing off, and we got it back onto the ramp and out. So...HUGE lesson learned and hopefully anyone launching at that ramp takes extra caution not to do what I did! Although, I see that it is now even tighter since they built that dock extension, which I don't remember. Be safe! Especially at the Vermilion Bay Government Launch!"
