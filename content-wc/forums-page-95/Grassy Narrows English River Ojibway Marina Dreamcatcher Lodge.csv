6431024,Hawk8792,2020-04-28 19:46:00,6,I had gone to this area for about 12 years straight but it has been a few since I have been back up(life got in the way). I will be back up some day!! Does anyone know if the old marina with campgrounds off of 671 is still in operation? It used to be run by Rodney back in the day and last time I went about 5 years ago was called the Ojibway Aking Marina run by a nice guy from the reservation(I believe his name was Brian). Also curious what happened to the old Dreamcatcher Lodge on Grassy Narrows which is in eye view of the Last Resort? Is it still not in operation? How about Ball Lake Lodge? Are there any others in operation now on that system of water? Thanks for the help.
6431120,Guest,2020-04-29 06:01:00,0,"I believe the marina is still in operation although not sure who runs it (Rodney is not there anymore). The Dreamcatchers Lodge (Grassy Narrows Lodge before that) has not been open in the last 5+ years, same with Ball Lake Lodge. The people that run the Last Resort used to run the old lodge across the lake. We have been staying at the Last Resort since they opened in 2010"
6431136,Hawk8792,2020-04-29 06:23:00,6,"Thanks for the information! I assume you do not use the Ojibway marina to launch for Last Resort? Gas was always an issue when we stayed at Dreamcatcher/Grassy Narrows Lodge even in it's prime and we always relied on the Ojibway marina for gas. What does Last Resort do for gas? Also last time I was up there, there was another launch up the river in a little bay off to the right. Is that where Last Resort launches their guests?"
6431192,Guest,2020-04-29 09:17:00,0,"There are 2 launches further up, 1 in a small back bay behind the Last Resort, then another just to the north were it opens up to the main lake, this launch is larger and people are able to leave trucks/trailers there (might be a fee for it, not sure). Regarding gas, we bring gas with us at the Last resort, but if we need any for the last day, they have been able to get it for us, we also have them bring a bag of ice per boat per day as well"
6431222,Hawk8792,2020-04-29 10:38:00,6,Excellent. My groups always used the Ojibway marina to launch but the road back was usually an issue(not so if you liked mudding it) and the big rock to launch off of was always fun! The other bigger launch you mentioned looked much easier but never tried it or really knew how to get there...assumed it was farther down good ol 671 into the reservation. Not sure when the border will open up but if you go this season good luck it truly is an awesome area to fish. Thanks again.
6431240,Guest,2020-04-29 11:23:00,0,"Ya, you drive thru the reservation to get to the other launches. We were supposed to be going in late June, that looks doubtful so we may see about August. We have been going up there since 2004"

6436256,Hawk8792,2020-05-10 07:30:00,6,Do you mean the Ojibway marina or all places up there? I assume safety reasons is for COVID 19 or something else?
