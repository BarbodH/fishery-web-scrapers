6433356,jambi,2020-05-04 09:29:00,504,So are locals allowed to go out and fish? I thought this wasn't allowed?
6433398,prov1800,2020-05-04 11:20:00,5010,As i wrote earlier we are governed by southern ontario.Around 2500 km from my place to toronto.So some launches have been closed there and none here so far as i know.Ontario started opening up stores and stuff today so iam thinking as long as we fish with people from our own house its all right.I normally dont use pubk5ic launches to begin with.
