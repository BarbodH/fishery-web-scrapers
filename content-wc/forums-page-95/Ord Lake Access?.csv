I'd like to try Ord Lake, and looking for details on the road and landing access to the West end landing, that is coming in from Hwy 105. Anyone been to this access the last few years? How is the road? What is the road name marked with out at HWY 105? What is the landing like? Anyone happen to have a picture of the landing? Is there enough room to turn around a 18-19ft boat/rig at the lake? I have an 1875 Lund Impact walk-thru, with roller trailer, and 4x4 truck. Is the road and access going in to Ord OK for this rig? or is this a lake better attempted with a smaller 14-16 footer? Also, any basic lake/fishing info you feel free to pass along is welcome as well. We'll be up the week that the sanctuaries open up mid-June."

We used to stay on a resort on Thaddeus (connected to Ord) and we would see resort boats from Andy Myers on a regular basis. They would come up that route. I think a couple resorts on Cedar Lake have boat caches there too. So between them they probably ensure the road is passable. I saw like a 20' fiberglass boat out there once, nice big Ranger or something. That was like 5 years ago.Have fished Ord and Moose a bunch over the 9 years we went up there. A lot of eater size walleyes in those waters with some larger. Hit me up in an IM if you like more information."
