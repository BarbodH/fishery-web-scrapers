6435802,kzoofisher,2020-05-09 11:07:00,5144,"Almost no one ever gives a number of fish per rod, they give a total and don't tell you how many people are in the boat or how long they fished or the average size. We've had this discussion a few times and when you can pry the numbers out of people it works out like skimottaret said, 20-30 fish per rod is typical and some days you hit it just right and get up towards 50. Then there's the exceptional days when every fish in the lake is starving and typical goes out the window. Atypical days are a hoot. 100 fish per rod per day is pretty common on the Detroit river at the right time, if you want to fish all day. Just toss a jig out there and it will as often as not get bit on the way down. Those are white bass and the walleye guys curse them. Too easy. There's a lesson there somewhere."

We fish two to a boat, We fish about 9 hours per day with about a half hour on shoar eating lunch. We consistently boat 100 to 150 walleye per day, that does not include northerns. The fishing truly is phenomenal."
6435034,fishron,2020-05-07 15:36:00,317,"Our group had a different first experience with fly-ins. Back in the day, I had read a sports magazine article on a lodge that flew you to a different lake each day. It wasn't hard to get a group together and off we went with no thoughts about weight limits or food for the trip because it was a full service lodge. Great meals. It was a one of a kind experience to fly each day and see a new lake each day and return for dinner. Not much time to become familiar with each body of water and that was a challenge. We did use a guide a couple of days and what a character. He never used a sentence that was adorned with at least one f**k word. He did put us on fish. We've had better drive-ins, boat ins and fly-ins since but this one was memorable. Caught lots of fish and my first decent walleye which I had mounted. Don't do that anymore. There was a lake one day that was a 100 pike a day lake. Never saw that since."

6435162,skimottaret,2020-05-08 02:43:00,40,"Great blog and I too had a lot of the same questions before our first Canadian trips years ago.. every website seems to indicate ""100 fish plus days and walleyes up to 32"" Funny though that the photos on the website all show 16""ers.. Unusual to hear how many caught per person, what typical sizes they boat or what time of year they are fishing. My brother and I are pretty geeky with counting all our fish (engineer and an accountant) to put a reality check on all the lakes we have fished over the years and to steer us for future trips. Its too easy to remember the one hot day on a lake but forget the tough bite... On completely unpressured remote lakes, portages etc 30-50 each is a great day for us and 20-30 typical. pulling in 50 14"" ers gets dull and plenty of lakes you can achieve that. When we find spots with eyes over 18-20"" that is the real fun and we will take a hit on numbers to try to find spots with more quality fish.. Also love to mix it up and pike fish or try for lakers. We both like the planning side as well as it keeps us thinking about next year and on the way home we nerd out on jot down whatever changes, baits, gear etc that would make next year better and it has over the years greatly improved the fishing and made for a more relaxed week on the water..."

6435326,IAranger,2020-05-08 09:12:00,352,"First off your blog was a great read. I too have been weight police and head meal planner cook guide and everything else. Sometimes we count fish and have had some incredible good days or even weeks and others the fishing has not been the hilight of the trip!! For me the most important part of the trip is the group, if everyone gets along and pitches in you can deal with anything.... but if you have a bad slacker or a really annoying person they can drain much of the fun. A good outfitter makes a huge difference also. I love the story of the guy that redid the mesh at the whole camp!!!!! I have NEVER been to a camp that had a decent screen door and kept the bugs out. We always end up MacGyverizing something to get us by tho !"

6435414,Rondogpike,2020-05-08 12:15:00,24,I have added my 2 cents to gordy28's blog here: https://www.northernjacks.com/post/e...n-fishing-trip
6435470,Rondogpike,2020-05-08 15:15:00,24,"Andrew, thank you for this post. I have been traveling and fishing Ontario for 30 years. We have done everything from pulling boats to drive-in camps, renting equipment from drive-in camps, hauled in by boat with the full American plan and numerous fly-ins with a variety of outfitters. When we first started flying in we flew with Bob and Jack Green out of Red Lake. While sadly they have both passed away some of my best memories were made at a few of their outposts. This my buddy Jeff holding a 46.25"" pike caught on Nungesser Lake (https://www.jackgreensflyincamps.com/) in 2005. Beren's River and Shabu were also favorites with Greens. We have kept track of # of fish for years now. There is $ on the line for most fish, biggest walleye and biggest pike. An 'average' year each guy catches 250 fish. An exceptional year we average 330 fish per guy. We normally fish 6 days and most years have 6 guys. One year I boated 374 fish. If I catch 35 fish in a day it's a good day. One of our best years was on St Joe's (2007 - 2,298 fish). We have seen every kind of weather from drop dead perfect to downright dangerous. We had a fly-in trip one year where we boated 640 fish with 6 guys fishing 6 days. Tried everything we could think of but struggled to have anything consistent. Pull into a spot and catch one or none. One year I had 90 walleyes by lunch time. We have caught walleye to 31"" and the pike on Green's website is the largest boated. We have shared our trips with bear, moose, caribou, beaver, martins, loons, eagles, (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAmdK57KFQ0). Loved every trip and can't wait till the next one."
6434414,gordy28,2020-05-06 08:10:00,437,"Hey BSstar - end of August, week before labour day"
6434478,Bstar,2020-05-06 10:44:00,564,"Gordy, We will be in the west cabin Aug. 15-22. I believe that's the week before your group flies in. If the border opens up by then. Anyway, if it happens we'll load you up with some intel at the dock."
6434522,MrSimon,2020-05-06 12:50:00,922,"First off - love your blog. Great job and keep it up! Expectations are so incredibly important, yet they get overlooked. We all have them, but we usually don't spend the time to think about them and keep them in check with reality. The internet doesn't help with that either. I've been on lakes where 15 fish per day is good, and I've been on lakes where 150 fish in the boat could happen fairly easily. I've had fun on both types of lake. Weight restrictions varies big time on outfitter. Outfitters who fly their own planes tend to be more flexible. Outfitters who charter out their flights are at the mercy of the charter service, and they are often strict to the pound. We make a moderate effort to hit our weight, but don't stress when we go over."
6434666,drlee,2020-05-06 17:25:00,409,"I have not, for years, counted the number of fish I have landed, with the exception of when I hit a really good reef, I may do a quick and dirty count for an hour or so. Would not bet my social security check on my accuracy.I have maybe had some 100 fish days in Canada during my 32 years there. But I have also been around a lot of guys who seem to get 100 every day. Maybe they do. I am not in their boat with them.But, I know this. If I were to catch 100 walleyes in one day, and I fished for 9 hours that day (around my average), that would mean 11 walleyes every hour for 9 hours, on average. 11 walleyes per hour means on average 1 walleye every 5.45 minutes. That would include time to move around, eat a sandwich, drink a soda, unhook fish, re-bait, pee, lose some jigs and re-tie, etc. I did keep a journal several years ago on my first ever two week stay on a drive in lake I had never fished before. I fished alone every day. I averaged 30 walleyes per day during my stay. I was pretty impressed with myself! 14 years later, I still spend two weeks at Press Lake Camp every year, but I don't count fish anymore. Don't care.Thoughts on 100 fish days? Would be curious..."
6434682,Pooch,2020-05-06 17:57:00,4618,"Over the years I've been in groups that one or two boats always really do have over one hundred fish days. Those boats tend to park on a couple of their favorite spots and jig all day. It works for them and they do it consistently. That's what they like and they are really good jig fishermen. Two guys per boat have to work to make over a hundred. Three guys or even four makes it a cake walk. Everyone has an occasional hundred fish day, but in my boat it is about a once or twice a year. My boat moves a lot, burns a lot of fuel and see's a lot of new scenery every day. Staying parked for more than an hour or so makes me crazy(er). On many of the larger lakes there is just too much water that has never seen a fisherman or very seldom. Those are the spots I want to fish. Keeping track of how many fish per day per man in the boat seems to paint a clearer picture. Counting is OK, but it means nothing as long as you are enjoying what you are doing. I learned to count fish when invited many years ago to join a group of engineers on their annual trip. They kept track of everything and were (still are) a source of great entertainment for me. This group is a hoot to be with. Pooch"
6434836,rockape,2020-05-07 06:44:00,215,"I'm in for the total experience of the Canadian Shield when I go. I've caught enough small fish in my life. Now I'm after the big ones. I also enjoy just kicking back, and taking the fresh air, wildlife, and scenery in. Now I must admit, when we first get on the water on day 1, I do want to catch a bunch of fish, and keep a few for dinner. We do have one spot where the fishing is usually sick for numbers of walleye. One day, my partner and I wanted to see how many we could catch in 1 hour. It was the only time we ever counted. Two guys, one hour, 56 walleyes! Live bait too, so we had to rebait many times. Then I put my jigging rod down, and casted for big pike!"
6434868,RichA$1970,2020-05-07 07:50:00,1159,"It’s fun to jig in a honey hole for awhile but then it’s time to move on. I prefer quality over quantity and do troll large baits and cast spoons for pike. I do get a kick on the excitement others have when they report 100s of fish for the day and as long as they are having fun, so be it."
6434874,gordy28,2020-05-07 07:58:00,437,Very cool - fingers crossed our paths cross on the dock! Will be very cool to meet a fellow WC member
6434876,gordy28,2020-05-07 08:04:00,437,"Again some great replies here: Mr Simon - thanks for the feedback - I have really enjoyed working on the blog - I am always surprised by how much enjoyment I get out of the writing part - I would never consider myself creative or a writer but it really seems to be a great outlet and I love ""revisiting"" old memories or thinking about new ones to be made In terms of targeting numbers - I am not really worried on the number. There are so many things I enjoy about the trip that aren't fishing related. I had never seen a bald eagle or a moose in my life prior to doing these trips, campfire time, just being Andrew for a week (not Dad, husband or work colleague) and so forth Cheers and thanks for all of the comments and feedback - keep it coming"
6434970,stumcfar,2020-05-07 12:46:00,451,"We have ""clickers"" in our boats and typically count fish. Always fun to hear someone holler ""click it!"" We typically will have contests for bragging rights each day by numbers for each boat. The goal for 3 people is 150 fish. It certainly doesn't happen everyday, but we do have a fair share of days where 3 people in a boat make the 150 or better mark. For the most part we go on our trips to catch fish. If the quality is decent, we will sit on spot for hours if they are biting. After awhile all the islands look about the same, so if you are sitting by a beautiful one and the fish are biting, why move. We see our share of eagles, moose and bear. The experience is different for all people, but for us a fishing trip is for catching fish, frying fish in the evening and some good card games into the night. The experience of being the only people on a lake is a feeling everyone should have some day. Nothing better!"

6433522,tandm,2020-05-04 18:32:00,679,"I, too, was worried about overweight charges on my first few fly-in trips. I have learned that as long as it is not a large amount, they will bend the rules. Most of the outfitters understand that 100# does not leave much leeway. If you are a group of 6 and want 15 cases of beer flown in (true story), expect a surcharge. Other than that, 50- 100 pounds of extra weight in a group's payload , should not be a major issue. As a pilot myself, I understand the need to set weight limits for the safety of all involved, and to offset the cost of supplying a larger plane or making an additional trip on your behalf. I have not had any 150 day trips either, but I have enjoyed solitude beyond belief, wildlife sightings to die for, and tranquility I will never forget."
6433696,prov1900,2020-05-04 23:32:00,544,"Good read and interesting observation on the 150 fish days. I've been to Canada yearly for a long time and some years we hammer the fish and others we really, really struggle just to assemble a fish fry for supper."
6433976,vteye3,2020-05-05 06:40:00,496,"Our group would rather pay extra freight costs and have plenty of food, beverages, gear etc. Its our vacation and being well equipped is important. Fishing can be hit or miss, weather, bugs etc. One guy in our group is bug phobic. He owns a hardware store and second trip took a morning off an re-screened the entire camp, fine mesh screen. No more bugs inside the camp. Some aspects of a trip are beyond ones control, chill enjoy being outdoors an don't fret the little stuff."

One day, we boated up stream some distance, and met up with some folks fishing, stopped to chat with them. One fellow was very upset, as his party had flown in and here a boat arrives which obviously hadn't. Outfitter had told them the water was not accessible from a road! Bill"
6434006,Skywagon,2020-05-05 07:34:00,1106,"A few outfitters will call the the lake their outpost cabin is on a ""private"" lake, but in fact the majority of lakes at least have fly-in boat caches on them, if not some sort of trail access."
6434144,gordy28,2020-05-05 12:33:00,437,"Some great comments - in regards to 150 fish days - my group have struggled to adapt, build confidence in jigging - it will be a focus (fingers crossed its a go) on Miniss Lake this year. I feel like improved jigging may get us closer to 100 fish days (baby steps) Agree re weight - we decided ahead of our last trip to try to get some stuff in ahead of time but that if we ended up with another $50 per guy in overage we were fine with that - we only do these trips every two years and have already spent a lot of $$ and time - we want what we want in camp - nothing extravagant but I like having a case of diet coke to go w rye or just as is on a sunny day at a shore lunch and so forth"

6434400,Mojo-NC,2020-05-06 07:40:00,1929,"We did our first fly-in last fall. Our group has been going to Canada for nearly 20 years now, but we weren't sure how to prepare for the details of a fly-in. We knew the devil is always in the details. Our main concerns were overall weight, fresh water, and battery charging. We knew we were prepared for the rest. A huge advantage was that we brought quality electronics with GPS. We had our outfitter put us in contact with two groups of guys who had fished the lake before and they gave us a lot of really good information about the logistics of the trip. The information they provided really helped put our minds at ease. One of the guys also gave us GPS coordinates of a good fishing location. We had our outfitter fly in our fresh water and beer in advance. We were informed that the camp had a small generator that could be used to charge our fishfinder batteries each evening while we were preparing and eating dinner. Weight turned out not to be an issue at all because we only had 4 guys on the trip and the plane could handle 6 or more guys. We had already packed as little as possible, and we had planned our menu based on 2 meals per day and we had purchased only the necessary ingredients to make those meals. I don't know if we had 150 fish days, but we caught so many fish that we got bored catching and decided to experiment with a bunch of new colors, styles, techniques, locations, etc. just to see if we could get them to work, because we knew we could always go back to the standard stuff to catch them if we so desired. I would love to do it all again."
