1405420,Bill Fisherman,2012-03-10 22:53:00,1,"I am looking for info on Entwine Lake located about 40 Miles north east of Fort Frances, Ont.It looks like a pretty good sized fly in outpost lake. If anyone has done any recent trips (with in the past 5 years), please let me know the condition of the cabins, boats, and motors.Most importantly how is the fishing? You can fish for walleye, northern pike, lake trout, and smallmouth bass. What types of numbers did you catch, was it hard or easy fishing?Any info would be great.Thanks,Bill Fisherman"
