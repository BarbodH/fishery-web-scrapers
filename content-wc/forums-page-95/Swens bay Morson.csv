6434248,Mattymo,2020-05-05 18:39:00,16,There are a few places for sale in swens bay. Would love to own a place up there someday but I'm not real familiar with that area. I've fished nw of Morson and east quite a bit but not much around it. What's the fishing like in general?
6434302,rockpt,2020-05-05 20:47:00,589,"It sucks, don't bother. Just kidding...I'm looking at one of those places and don't need the competition Most of the guys I know who fish out of Morson fish west to Dawson, up Painted Rock Channel to Rubber Island, Firebag and out to McPherson, back to Miles Bay, Obabikon, Rabbit Island and Burrow Bay, and all points between. That's a lot of water and great fishing."
6434384,LOWrider,2020-05-06 07:01:00,40,"X2 what rockpt said. I'd add a couple thoughts: - Wide variety of structures & depths depending on where you are fishing. This is a good thing but does mean that you tend to have to explore at times as active fish are constantly changing their patterns with the time of year, water temp etc. (Walleye fishing 101 I know but worth saying as this can mean at times you have some longer boat rides to get to deeper water) - The main track exiting Swens into the main lake is some serious water around Pork Pt. Make sure you are comfortable with the big water. It only took us a year to upgrade from a 17' to a 20' boat after buying our place a couple miles from there. Good luck."

6434584,Mattymo,2020-05-06 14:47:00,16,Thanks guys. I like the idea of fishing new areas but its hard to not go to proven spots. Everything I'm familiar with is 45 minutes either direction.
6435166,rockpt,2020-05-08 03:18:00,589,"LOWrider, Can you explain about coming out of Pork Pt. for those of us who haven't had the experience? Exactly where it's located (I just checked the Canadian chart and don't see Pork Pt. marked). I've always fished out of Miles Bay, but my buddies in Morson have told me about coming out of Morson when there's a strong NW wind. Big fetch across the water to the west and northwest. One October day back in about 2007 or 2008, the camp boat from New Moon Lodge radioed that he had just went over ""a legitimate 8 footer."" I don't know about that, but I remember the water was so bad that day that we stayed in the cabin all day. And the safe route is up thru Rabbit Point and Comegan, right? More protected. Rockpt"
6435242,LOWrider,2020-05-08 07:19:00,40,"Swens bay is just north of the Big Grassy Reserve. Pork Pt. is essentially the very tip of the where the Big Grassy exits into the main lake. Go to lakeofthewoodsmn.com and use their lake map. Very clearly marked. Pork Pt. is very exposed to the north and west. Good thing is that it is only about a mile run across to Harbor and Burnt I. which gives you good lee shore to work with in a Southwest wind - which in our area comes from the Big Traverse. Quickest way to Miles Bay is as you said - follow the south track which goes past Brule I. up through Rabbit Pt. In wind there are other more round about ways to go, including trailering up to the Govt. Dock and just skipping that part of the big water. Wind is everything. I check them every morning and when I can get cell reception during the day. https://weather.gc.ca/marine/forecas...9&siteID=08100 is the Canadian Marine forecast."
