6304328,Lake Of The Woods,2019-03-25 22:25:00,124,"I lived in this area for many years and traveled the road to Grassy Narrows known as 671 countless times when fishing the many lakes along the road. English River Indian Reserve NO.21 is at the end of the paved road before it branches off to several logging roads that also give access to many lakes with great fishing. The Reserve and Native people who reside there are top notch and very friendly. They run a dry Reserve and there will be nothing to be concerned about during your stay in the area. The camp is well maintained and the local guides will with out a doubt expose you to a fantastic experience. Lake types range from eutrophic, mesotrophic and oligotrophic so many species such as Walleye, Pike, Muskie, Smallmouth Bass, Perch, Cappie, Lake Trout, Brook Trout(stocked), Rainbow Trout(stocked), Whitefish can be fish for. Most lakes are relatively small making them safe for small vessels and easy to cover in a short period of time. Take it slow if it is your first time travelling down 671 as it has many twists and sharp turns and some locals tend to drive at a fast rate of speed.Then there is the Deer and Moose to keep an eye out for. There is also a very scenic spot where Silver Lake meets up along the road. It is a high elevation area that may be worth a few pictures especially if you climb the hill on the opposite side of the road. Keys Lake is also another lake that is accessible just off the road and it has a great beach. I have fished it many times and caught some very impressive Lake Trout and Muskie. Enjoy your trip."
6326322,bbheli,2019-05-29 19:40:00,1387,Looking for information on boating from the launch in Morison to the lodge. Is the waterway safe of are there hazards. thinking of bringng a 20' fiberglass up. I normally operate on wide open inlamd lakes in the midwest so don't know what to expect. The google maps seem sewn together but looks like a ton of stuff to deal with if you don't know the waters.
6326424,Guest,2019-05-30 06:14:00,0,I believe you are looking for info about a different Grassy Narrows lodge that is on Lake of the Woods. This thread is about the Last Resort on Grassy Narrows Lake which is part of the English River system
6429308,Hawk8792,2020-04-25 10:37:00,6,I had gone to this area for about 12 years straight but it has been a few since I have been back up(life got in the way). I will be back up some day!! Does anyone know if the old marina with campgrounds off of 671 is still in operation? It used to be run by Rodney back in the day and last time I went about 5 years ago was called the Ojibway Aking Marina run by a nice guy from the reservation(I believe his name was Brian). Also curious what happened to the old Dreamcatcher Lodge on Grassy Narrows which is in eye view of the Last Resort? Is it still not in operation? How about Ball Lake Lodge? Are there any others in operation now on that system of water? Thanks for the help.
6436254,Flag Island,2020-05-10 07:22:00,32,Yesterday I was told that Grassy is closed and will not open this year for safety reasons. Maynard lake lodge is the next one up from Ball Lake
6436258,Hawk8792,2020-05-10 07:32:00,6,Do you mean the Ojibway Marina or everything up there? And I assume safety reasons is for COVID 19?
6006905,Iowa_Vike,2018-02-16 07:14:00,3,"Hi all - I've been invited with a group of guys to go to the Last Resort on Grassy Narrows Lake this year. Looking forward to going and enjoying the outdoors. Anybody have any reviews of this place? Any experiences with this place, Any pictures of the Cabins? Can't really find a whole lot on the websites and online searches. Any information will be much appreciated. Thanks"
6007441,Guest,2018-02-16 10:54:00,0,"I have been going there since they opened (prior to that, our group went to the old lodge within eyesight). This is the only place we have gone to in Canada with cabins so I cant compare it to some of the other more well known places but I expect those places are nicer but also cost more. The cabins work just fine for our needs as our primary purpose there is fishing. As they were building the cabins, the bathroom was an outhouse but there would be an indoor shower that worked good enough to get the combo of sunscreen and bugspray scrubbed off. the floors are painted plywood and walls are unpainted plywood (although I think 1 or 2 of the cabins may have some type of flooring over the plywood now). Overall, we will continue to go there for many years going forward. Do a search for English River Ontario on youtube and there are a few videos out there from a group that goes up every year for opening weekend"
6007865,eyegator,2018-02-16 14:44:00,29,Is the fishing good up there all year? I've seen vids of the group that goes up opening weekend- they do well. How about July or August?
6008617,Iowa_Vike,2018-02-17 04:43:00,3,Thanks for the info! This is an all week fishing trip for us as well so a roof over head is about all we need. You have any tips on what I should bring for the stay and what types of tackle work the best?. There will be 6 of us going in September.
6011529,Guest,2018-02-19 06:24:00,0,"The earliest I have fished there was mid June and the latest was early September. I cant say any time is better than any other time, the only thing we notice is that the water level makes a little difference on where the fish are. We fish a lot of areas with current and we go all the way up to Maynard Falls and the fish are normally in the same general areas but could slide up or downstream a little based on the water level and flow. As far as tackle, we really only target walleyes so we use jigs with either plastics or crawlers/minnows/leaches most of the time. There are a few spots that we will cast Shad Raps or crankbaits for walleyes too. There are always a few northerns mixed in while walleye fishing and a couple spots hold smallmouths where we cast too As far as other stuff to bring, we just pack like we are going camping really. The biggest thing we tell anyone new coming with us is to make sure you have decent rain gear. We have been up there when its hot and 90F and other times we have been snowed on so plan for all types of weather."
6013241,Iowa_Vike,2018-02-19 16:47:00,3,Thanks for tips. Looking forward to a great week.
6299478,Guest,2019-03-13 15:54:00,0,We are very familiar with fishing on Grassy Narrows but have not been to this lodge. How are the cabins equipped? Do they have stove and refrigerator? What about access to a bbq grill?
6299512,ONEMORE,2019-03-13 17:02:00,4,"always went in june and september fishing is always good, you will like it good luck."
6299612,Guest,2019-03-14 06:11:00,0,"The cabins do have a stove/oven, refrigerator and charcoal grills (we bring our own charcoal and lighter fluid just to ensure its there on the night we decide to grill out)."
