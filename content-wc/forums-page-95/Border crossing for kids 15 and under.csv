6437392,valley366,2020-05-12 10:03:00,193,Here is a link to samples of the form: https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/children/consent-letterHere is a link to the documentation requirements: https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpce...um=1022&top=16Of note there is a line in the one of the pages to verify with the province you are entering. I just listed general Canada pages.

We have a notorized letter from his mom and birth certificate and a copy of her divorce decree granting her sole custody. I hand this packet to the border guard with our passports and have him in the back seat on the drivers side so they can ask him whatever they want and have never been there more than 2-3 minutes. He was so scared the first time they almost stumped him asking him his birth date!!! Later, Jay"
6437638,valley366,2020-05-12 19:32:00,193,"Funny story. First year taking my boys up there. Would have been 5 years ago and my youngest would have been 7 at the time. Same as above we get to the border have the package of information and hand it to the agent. This was the conversation between her and my son:Agent: Where are you heading today?Son: CanadaAgent: Well you are here, do you know where in Canada you are going?Son: A resortAgent: Do you know the name of the resort?Son: YesThis conversation goes on for several minutes while my dad and I are chuckling in the front seat. She was nice and had a good time with it. He was nervous and it showed. He is a smart one and remembers things. The next years he was studying the questions in the car when we got close to the border."
6437934,lmoore,2020-05-13 12:35:00,40,"That's funny On that note, there should be a thread on funny occurrences at the border (maybe there has been one). I've read a lot of the bad times, but I know there are funny ones out there too."
6437938,Woollybob,2020-05-13 12:52:00,158,I agree - have always had the notarized letter along. Others in my group that did not have one got a good hassling.
6437948,valley366,2020-05-13 13:21:00,193,I have never had it notarized but have all the requisite information with a copy of the passport and never had any questions or hassles. For me has been more asked for on the Canada side but my brother in law was asked for it on the MN side one trip.
6436764,IowaWalleye1978,2020-05-11 07:06:00,96,Have a trip planned to spruce island on June 13th and 2 of the kids in our groups passports have expired. Reading where kids accompanied by a parent just need a birth certificate and a photo ID. Anyone ever had trouble crossing the border with kids with just those 2 forms of identification? Thanks
6436774,RichA$1970,2020-05-11 07:20:00,1159,Not sure especially nowadays but might be a mute point as going in mid June the borders could still be closed. A lot of BS imo but you might want to move it to August
6436782,reddemon2,2020-05-11 07:32:00,255,"Border won't be open in June, August at the earliest"
6436786,lmoore,2020-05-11 07:33:00,40,"Unfortunately, I don't think you'll have to worry about it. We've got a trip about that same time every year and it doesn't look like it will happen. I'm not sure how it has changed now, but last time we went with an under 18 (10ish years ago), you needed a birth certificate or photo ID of some sort (16-18), and a letter from the other parent stating it was ok for the child to go along. Back even further to when I was 17 or so, we didn't have a letter for me one year and got hung up at the border for a while until they determined that I wasn't being kidnapped."
6436788,reddemon2,2020-05-11 07:33:00,255,"Kids Don't Need Passports to Get Into Canada A valid U.S. passport, passport card or NEXUS card satisfies these requirements. But children under the age of 16 years must prove U.S. citizenship only. You can complete this requirement by having a certified copy of each child's birth certificate."
6436820,IowaWalleye1978,2020-05-11 08:03:00,96,Im hopeful it will be open on June 13th but it does sound like the closure will be extended to May 31. Also hopeful that kids only need a birth certificate and a photo ID.

6436870,IowaWalleye1978,2020-05-11 09:17:00,96,Googled it...gonna be all good!
6437026,valley366,2020-05-11 15:35:00,193,No passport is required but makes it easier. I missed the expiration dates on my kids passports last year. Had their expired passports and birth certificates and had no issues. I have been asked on several occasions for the letter from the other parent when she is not along. They have asked my kids if mom knows where we are going. No issues as have produced the letter but they have asked the questions nicely.
6437186,prov1900,2020-05-11 23:50:00,544,"I always bring a notarized letter from ""mom"" and have been asked to produce it on numerous occasions. Not a requirement but it shows that you got your stuff in order. Speeds up the process."
