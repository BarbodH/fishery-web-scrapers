Caught my biggest Canada smallmouth on one while casting for pike /musky. Probably 5# or better. A gold/pink hot n tot was my favorite crank up there, bass, pike walleye all liked that thing."
6433538,That Minnesota guy,2020-05-04 18:58:00,8293,If a person wanted to switch out the trebles for a single hook whats recommended for the Super Shad Raps?

6434054,rockape,2020-05-05 09:15:00,215,"5.5 inch bait is too short if you want big fish. 8-10 inch baits get the big ones, and smaller ones down to 30 inches."
6434106,elkman99,2020-05-05 11:06:00,180,"I have musky fished all over Canada, and I will tell you that I have experience lots of times where color made a HUGE difference. I find that many of these lake are color specific, perhaps to the food forage, but for sure, some colors outshine others by a wide margain. As for the Super Shad Raps being so dangerous to fish due to the 2 trebles, is interesting. When catching as many pike/musky as we have over the years, this just simply isn't the case. If you 100% don't want to hurt the fish, then don't be driving steel hooks into their face. barbless or not."
6429250,phishfearme,2020-04-25 08:44:00,1242,"my point is that ALL lures with treble hooks damage fish and are dangerous - and ones with two trebles are even more so. in my box all trebles are either cut to one hook or replaced with single hooks. and for those of you who think color matters - recognize that this is a marketing ploy - more colors = more purchases. two key points: - below a few feet of water (especially stained water like in northern Ontario) colors disappear - it's basic physics - for fish looking up from below the lure, all the fish sees is the outline and action against the sky - color doesn't matter there's an old fishing adage: hundreds of new lures and colors are available and a million fisherman will bite. phish"
6429272,bthomas3333,2020-04-25 09:13:00,465,In shallow water (less than 20 ft) color does matter maybe not a lot. As you go deeper you are 100% correct. For pike and walleye they can see color in most fishing situations. I do agree profile and vibration are more important but they can see color in very stained water when shallow.https://www.liveoutdoors.com/fishing...e-lures-depth/B-
6429288,phishfearme,2020-04-25 09:30:00,1242,"the link you provide is very misleading - it is for clear saltwater not freshwater and certainly not the bog tannic stained waters of most of the northland. (they do however present tannic stained situation and clearly state dark colors work best - any other color is gone. i used to do a lot of underwater photography and even in the clearest water you need a flash at 20 ft - the reds and oranges are gone. but for the situation of fishing in the northland, 20 ft is the same as 4-5 ft - colors are gone. phish"
6429350,gordy28,2020-04-25 12:36:00,437,"I have never fished the shad rap for pike but for muskie I always did well on the silver black with the orange belly - believe it is called ""original pearl shad"" The one I have still bears some good musky scars on it"

6429462,WallyWarrior,2020-04-25 17:54:00,2488,"I will say first hand knowledge tells me otherwise. I would say depth, then speed, then color are the lost important factors. Maybe you fish lakes where numbers are crazy, I fish lakes where they are not. I can look back on many times that one color outshines another. Switch all baits to that color and all baits work. It's happened many times and on multiple lakes. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6429484,RichA$1970,2020-04-25 18:49:00,1159,Awesome and I’m picking up the walleye n either fire tiger or redhead for my Sept trip.
6430350,fldoc1,2020-04-27 07:40:00,69,In the red lake area of Ontario I have had good luck casting for northerns with red / white color combinations. Some fisherman I talk with prefer (at least) some white on their lures. The old faithful red / white Dardevle has done just fine. Using single barbless hooks while early season northern fishing with spoons in Manitoba works. I switch my lures to single barbless hooks as often as possible no matter where I fish and I do not feel I lose many more fish that way. I strongly believe it is much easier on the fish and me. I will go barbless on trebles and sometimes remove a treble. The issue with some lures is balance. Randy from Duluth
6430708,stumcfar,2020-04-28 06:12:00,451,"I often fish Buffalo Bay in Manitoba and do a lot of ""Shad Rapping"". Manitoba is barbless, so I still use the trebles with all the barbs pinched. You do run the risk of losing a fish if you don't keep a tight line or if the fish surfaces and you get some slack. The nice thing is as you net the fish, the lure usually comes out in the net. It is also nice to have the barbless when you get the occasional northern and if you would happen to get a hook buried in your hand, they come right out!"
6433002,5 of Diamonds,2020-05-02 19:39:00,151,"Strongly agree with going barbless. ALWAYS barbless with our groups when flying into the bush...ALWAYS! If you find you're losing fish with barbless hooks, then get away from braided line if that's what you're using. If you can't get away from your favorite braid, then consider a slightly 'slower' (softer) rod action. I'm not even going to attempt the color topic though lol... Hope everyone is able to get on the water soon! Stay safe."
6426192,RichA$1970,2020-04-18 20:08:00,1159,Looking to add a Rapala Super Shad Rap for fishing Northerns in a tea stained lake. Curious on everyone’s favorite color.
6426196,That Minnesota guy,2020-04-18 20:16:00,8293,We have found Red & White and Perch work well. Also I personally like a dark color. This is on the Kabetogama chain in Minnesota which is much like Canadian waters. Main thing is run them 3.5 mph or better.
6426204,bthomas3333,2020-04-18 20:42:00,465,I also like the Red-head White-body. It did well in N MB last June. Used it casting and trolling.B-
6427156,stumcfar,2020-04-21 07:48:00,451,"I have had great luck with the Crawdad color in stained lakes. I tend to travel a little slower than the above comment, 2.5-3 is my go to speed normally."
6428976,phishfearme,2020-04-24 15:22:00,1242,these lures are dangerous and seriously injure fish. cut off some of the hooks and pinch down the barbs (or replace with single hooks) - your hands and the fish will appreciate it. phish
6429046,That Minnesota guy,2020-04-24 17:44:00,8293,You would need to educate me on how these are any worse for the fish than any other treble hook.

6429074,bthomas3333,2020-04-24 18:56:00,465,Not speaking for Phish but in my experience any double treble lure is tough on the fish. I would not say these are any worse. I always go barbless and when the situation calls for a certain lure I fish it.In a perfect world I would catch all my fish on single hook spoons and jigs. It just doesn't always work that way.B-
6429080,That Minnesota guy,2020-04-24 19:02:00,8293,"I won't argue that point, I just don't see Super Shads being any worse then any other crank bait. For what it's worth I have been connected by a treble to a flopping Pike. Pike, treble hook, finger. Not a fun few minutes."
6429086,RichA$1970,2020-04-24 19:20:00,1159,So what were the colors you chose?
