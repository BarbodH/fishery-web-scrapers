Bay Fishing Camp near the bustard islands/ mouth of the French and am not familiar w/ this camp or the fishing in this part of the bay. Can anyone advise about the walleye/pike fishing there, the fishing/boating traffic, or this camp? thanks alot."

507206,Jim,2000-02-27 18:10:00,238,"I am thinking of going to Georgian Bay Lodge near Bustard Islands in late September. I know this doesn't answer your question, but since you said you fished Georgian Bay Lodge I was wondering if you could answer some of mine. Is late September a good time to go to Georgian Bay Lodge? If so how deep do you fish at that time? Do you jig or troll live bait? Do you use minnows or crawlers?Do you fish toward the Bustards or do you fish theFrench River mouth?Any info would be appreciated."
507205,Guest,2000-03-01 19:08:00,0,"thanks for the reply. my buddy is ordering the coorect chart from the Hydrographic service. as soon as he receives it, i'd like to send you a copy to highlight some good spots. where can i locate tour email address? thanks again for your help"
507207,Guest,2000-03-01 19:19:00,0,"Are you speaking of Georgian Bay Fishing Camp when you say GBF lodge? I've been going there for years in June but never in late Sept. In June, we get most of our eyes trolling w/ harnesses in 5-20 ft of water around the thousands of points and shoals-- what I call ""brown water""--- water that looks brown due to all the submerged shoals when you wear polarized lenses. Fish location is driven by h20 temp; the walleyes seem to emanate from the rivers/creeks into the bay post spawn and head out to deep/open water once it nears the high 60's/low 70's. e-mail me and let me know if you've never fished this area before. I can give you quite a few tips about fishing this area but don't want to give you useless info if you're a vet to these waters."
507208,Jim,2000-03-07 18:10:00,238,I tried to email hope you got it. I would be interested in info on this area. Yes i am speaking of Georgion Bay Fishing lodge.Do you fish toward the Bustards or more toward the shore French River mouths?My email is [email protected]We are going late September and hope Walleyes are moving back to shoals as water cools down.

1247709,dlormand,2010-11-08 14:52:00,2,Just reading your posts. I'm heading up to fish this weekend and we're launching at Snug Harbour. A little south of Pointe au Baril. Any ideas for around Franklin Island area. Hoping to catch any species that's open and we're never fished this area this time of year. Ideally some Walleye though.

1354362,adempsey,2011-10-01 13:35:00,963,"I've stayed south of Bayfield Inlet, closer to Pointe au Baril Station a few years ago in the summer. Boat traffic was very high. Too high for me and would probably not go back in the summer. Always wanted to head back in the fall though.Looks like there are several marinas in Bayfield Inlet. So, I'd imagine the traffic will be high along the main channels. However, you might be OK since school isn't out until the end of June."
