If the current ""exchange"" rate is 1.04 and you have a bank that gives you 1.035... that's a 0.48% difference... I rounded up to .5%. That's basically half of a penny per dollar, which is WAAAYYYYY better than any rate I've ever seen."
1354194,Obabikon,2011-09-30 15:33:00,2370,"Do you live in Michigan? I'm not against traveling to a local bank somewhere that doesn't charge exchange fees. Look at it this way... if you get a good exchange rate of 3% and your company grosses between $250,000 and $500,000 (and exchanges all of it)... getting an exchange rate of .5% saves you $6,250-$12,500 per year. Definately worth a couple trips to a bank somewhere. If you're paying 5%, it would save the company between $11,250 and $22,500."

1354064,J-Man,2011-09-30 07:42:00,191,"When I tried to ""convert"" $1 US dollar to a CDN dollar, it only offered $0.99.Just another example of how the ""quoted"" rates confuse the heck out of so many people.Here is a link to RBC exchange rates:http://www.rbcroyalbank.com/RBC:S5AS...cashrates.htmlAt the same time, RBC rate shows it is buying $1 US for $1.01 CDN, 2 cents better than the above rate. If we wanted to purchase a US Dollar FROM the bank, it would cost almost $1.07 CDN.Be careful when using quoted rates, as they are very unlikely what you will actually receive from a financial institution."
1354084,micropterus,2011-09-30 08:58:00,450,"I changed banks. The current exchange rate is 1.04 this AM. My bank will give 1.035 for a US $. Some banks will change a fee, say 5% for the exchange and call the exchange rate CAN .99."
1354096,Obabikon,2011-09-30 09:28:00,2370,"You've gotta let me know what bank charges a .5% rate! What kind of account is that deal on? (personal/business) Is that the ""cash"" exchange rate or personal check exchange rate?"
1354097,TIGHTLINER,2011-09-30 09:30:00,223,ON OUR TRIPS NORTH WE ALWAYS WOULD STOP AT THE SOO TO GET THE MONEY EXCHANGED AT A INFORMATION BOOTH NEVER GOT WHAT THEY SAID ON THE WEB SITES. BANKS WERE THE SAME. SOMEONE TOLD ME TO STOP AT THE CASINO BECAUSE THEY GAVE A BETTER RATE OF EXCHANGE THEY MUST FIGURE YOU ARE GOING TO BLOW IT THERE ANYWAY. THE CASINO WAS JUST ABOUT WHAT YOU THE WEB SITE WAS FROM THE DAY BEFORE WE LEFT. I USE WWW.XE.COM I THINK THIS SITE IS UPDATED EVERY 20 TO 30 MIN. JUST FOOD FOR THOUGHT.

1354159,micropterus,2011-09-30 13:07:00,450,My bank in effect does not charge a fee. That's why I changed banks!This is a local bank. I called around.
1354168,tv4fish,2011-09-30 13:35:00,2694,You need to read his post again -- not 0.5% ---- 5%
1354175,Guest,2011-09-30 14:06:00,0,I checked out XE.com. It had the Can$ at 1.047. My bank gave me 1.013 an hour ago. Too bad XE isn't a bank
1354185,micropterus,2011-09-30 14:50:00,450,"He is referring to the 1.4- 1.035 = .05, that was what my bank quoted me this AM, this will vary with when their computer is updated.5% is the exchange fee typically charged in this area."
