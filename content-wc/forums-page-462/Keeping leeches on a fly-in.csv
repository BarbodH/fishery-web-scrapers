1352433,DavKin,2011-09-24 05:51:00,104,"Just wondering how/where others keep leeches at a fly-in outpost? In the past we used a leech tamer tied off at the dock. However, this year we lost most of them from the leech tamer at the dock. Should the leech tamer be totally submerged?"
1352448,rdbalmer,2011-09-24 07:17:00,279,"I would recommend keeping them in a cooler and changing the water as needed. Keep the water cold. I have always used a frozen water bottle in mine to help keep the water cool and have had excellent luck. Don't try to feed them, it only contaminates the water. Hopefully you will use them up fast enough they won't get hungry! Rob"
1352482,GNO,2011-09-24 09:15:00,153,Keeping them cold and changing the water when a couple times on the trip will do. The fridge works great.
1352499,Larry Mac,2011-09-24 10:54:00,530,"Hi DavKin, we keep ours in the refridgerator changing the water daily. This has worked great for us on many trips. On behalf of myself and our group we would like to thank you greatly for all of your time, effort, help and information which made our trip a huge success. You are truly a class act.Sincerely,Larry Mac"

To accomplish this, I take a plastic juice pitcher (2-3 qt.) and put all of the leeches in the pitcher and fill with water until you have about 2-3 inches of water over the top of the leeches. Then, keep refrigerated or in a cooler. Careful that the propane refrigerators that are often used on fly-ins aren't too cold to freeze them.Each morning, I take some out and put them in small containers for each boat. The rest of the leeches are rinsed with lots of water and the water in the pitcher is changed. I rinse the leeches by putting them in a ""pasta"" strainer and flush with water. Once they are cleaned up, put back in the pitcher and recover with fresh water. You can by a collapsible, plastic pasta strainer, very light weight and takes very little room.Very important to do this procedure every day. You'll get by if you skip a day or so, but after that they'll get bad quickly. I might have a dozen die each year (max). Word of caution, be careful no one mistakes the pitcher for something edible. One of my brothers once woke up in the middle of the night and he was thirsty. Poured himself a glass of ""water"" from the pitcher in the dark. Didn't realize until the next morning what he drank!Pat"
1352535,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-09-24 13:59:00,235,"If you get the large clear plastic bags from the bait shop, be VERY careful handling the bag indoors. Trust me from experience that you don't want to spill that in the cabin. And if you have minnows, get those things in the lake water ASAP. Just this year, we were getting picked up from an outpost cabin and a new group was arriving, a bunch of old timers. The weather was windy and rainy, so we quickly hauled all their gear up to the cabin. They let us wait with them inside til the weather cleared and the second plane could arrive. During this time, they had left their minnows out on the dock (in a sealed plastic container for the flight). By the time the next plane came in an hour later, all the minnows they bought were dead. It was over $200 worth of bait, dead before any of them even got a line in the water. These old timers were PISSED at their buddy and it was hard for us to hold in our laughter while they cussed the poor guy out."
1353069,Mohleye,2011-09-26 15:06:00,368,"All good info....I'll just add that the propane fridges generally are coldest toward the top, so if you keep the leeches on the bottom, there's less chance they will freeze. Also, when you change the water, change it with water that is also cool, not the water off the end of the dock especially mid-summer. You can easily kill every leech from the shock of a big temperature change. I know both these things from first hand experience..... If you have a leech tamer along, an easy way to change the water is to empty the water and leeches into the half of the leech tamer with the perforations. That's also an easy way to get them out of the plastic bag without spilling them everywhere. I store them in a gallon ice container in the fridge."
1353223,Chad,2011-09-27 07:07:00,3523,They died? Or did somone not seal them?
