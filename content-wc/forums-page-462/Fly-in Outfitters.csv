1353485,adempsey,2011-09-27 19:30:00,963,"What is your primary target for fishing? Walleye and pike, or also trout?Numbers or trophies? How rustic can the outpost be (i.e., do you need running water, shower etc.)??Price range?You have a lot of choices with 6 members going."
1353486,Mich_Fisherman,2011-09-27 19:31:00,292,"Fly in out of Hornepayne.....there are 3 outfitters on Lake Nagagami. We use Expeditions North ( www.expeditions-north.com ) They are housekeeping only. One of the best fishing lakes in central Ontario. Reasonable, relatively close. I don't know the other camp names but I'm sure if you Google the lake you will find the other outfitters. I know one of them is American Plan only. Check out my picture gallery for pictures from Expeditions on Nagagami. Feel free to PM me if you have questions....Good Luck with your search!"

1353547,onetimedave,2011-09-28 06:33:00,502,"A little farther drive but well worth the trip, NAKINA ONTARIO. Look at Arctic Watershed Outposts (AWO) in Nakina. We have used them 15+- times with another coming this June. These people will take good care of you. Enter Ontario at the ""SOO"". Good roads to Nakina with lots of wildlife to see. Can help with maps etc."
