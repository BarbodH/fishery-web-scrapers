1350360,GarryB,2011-09-17 06:57:00,365,Are there any top rated lodges/resorts on Lac Suel that allows pets? My wife and I would prefer one that offers the American plan. We have a 9 year old Gordon Setter that's a part of our family.

1350858,GarryB,2011-09-19 09:32:00,365,I called Fisherman's Cove and was told they do not allow pets.Any other suggestions on quality resorts on Lac Suel besides Evergreen's?
