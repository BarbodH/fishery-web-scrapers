Looking for some walleye fishing, northern fishing, some smallmouth fishing and some jumbo perch. Which of these lakes would provide the best action for all these species? Thinking about last week in July, first week in August next year. I have read about all three, just wondering about the the other species that i'm after besides the walleye which i can tell is fabulous on Lac Seul? I see Rainbow Point on Perrault seems to be good for all of them jumbo perch, the eyes notherns and bass. Any help would be greatly appreciated would be first time heading to any of these lakes.Thanks,Mike"

I can give you two spots where there are always a couple......though its nothing like you will find in the perrault/cedar/cliff area. IMHO, Lac Seul is way way better for pike and walleyes. Just want to pick what's most important I suppose. Matt Matt"

1351528,Hump,2011-09-21 07:22:00,578,"We stay at Evergreen. first off: The camp is great, the boats are outstanding, Pat and Gary are helpful and friendly. Moose ( I've heard) is a great guide and super around the docks. we go normally the last week of July and normally don't go far to find fish. This year was different, but you are going to have those every once in awhile. Fish the windblown points."

1353927,digjig,2011-09-29 15:23:00,146,"You don't even have to leave camp to catch smallmouth at Rainbow Point. Just go to the back of cabin #4 in the evening and throw some top waters (jointed jitter bugs work great). I have always been able to catch a few nice ones. We have had good luck on Perrault for Perch too. Found a new strategy: -Setup and the end of a bay with some obvious weed beds. -Tie a small jig (1/16 oz) with a piece of nightcrawler on it. -Have one person cast a large spoon into the weeds and retrieve at a moderatley slow speed. -Perch of all sizes will follow the spoon back to the boat and attack your jig. You can actually sight fish the Perch along the boat. We had the best luck in bays on the south side of the lake near the entrance to Cedar Lake. We had decent walleye fishing on the ""Wall"" on Perrault as well. However, Lac Seul is the Walleye Factory and is hard to beat when you are on fish. -DJ"
