BUT, someone puulease explain the Forest Service ""rationale"" (IF anyone can really call it that?)--- of WHY ""we"" let this fire burn - to start with 'cause it's ""natural"" -- and NOW ""we"" have decided it's time to put it out ?? Just a SLIGHT difference in the cost to do it now ??"

There has been talk in some Canadian circles, about limiting US fishing visitors to using cane poles only. Still waiting to see if the legislation passes about the non-drinking rule for Amercan visitors."
1353470,joeman79,2011-09-27 18:30:00,417,That would be a great reason for me to DEFECT!!! Another year of Obama and things are still worse than they were. I will start studying for my Citizenship test EH! LOL I love this forum
1353473,HeHooksHimself,2011-09-27 18:46:00,725,"Yes, limiting us to cane poles and we will have to get 6-pointed stars to sew on our Carharts while we are in Canada, just like the Nazis did to the ghetto Jews in the holocaust and WE DID IT! Blueberries, Canadian beer Cane poles and the holocaust, all in one thread. Congrats!"

Along with explaining the cane poles and stars on our sleeves, that should take plenty of time crossing the borders eh!? Had to throw in the ""eh"" , I'm sure its part of the dual citizens test, do you think the spelling part of the test would be to spell boat with a ""u"" or just spell it booaat? As dual citizens would you be able to take Canadian blueberries and worms across the border? Would you be able to drink Candain beer in the US and in Canada? I hope those questions aren't on the test!"

Skillet, Bacon, precut bag of potatoes, can of beans and beer. The only fish we keep are the shore lunch fish all trip. Its a nice break from 12+ hrs of fishing we do daily and its gives you the feel of camping minus sleeping on the ground."

1351953,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-09-22 11:54:00,235,"Shore lunch - I can take it or leave it. Have done it once in 9 trips up to Canada, and never felt I was missing out the years we didn't do it. We just head back to the cabin and cook them there. Eat outside on the deck and you've got the wilderness right there to admire.It's quite a production to bring all the stuff, clean it up, bring it back, etc. Tables/countertops and running water are just too convenient to pass up when cleaning and cooking fish. But if someone else is doing all the work, it's a nice excuse to kick back, have a beverage and enjoy the surroundings."
1351965,Mike Borger,2011-09-22 12:12:00,1554,"After preparing countless elaborate shore lunches while working as a guide, yeah I can take them or leave them. I once had these two gents in their 80's from New Jersey in my boat. The 2 most hardcore guys I ever had the privelage of guiding. No shore lunch for them, it cut into fishing time. Every day they'd bring sandwiches in the boat and ONLY eat them when we were enroute to another spot. Same thing with pee breaks too. Those guys could really fish too. Good times."
1352031,orchard frank,2011-09-22 15:24:00,1900,"Usually 2 weeks or more per summer, 13 yrs straight at Lac Seul, shore lunch every single day after the first year or a downpour hit. Had a roll-up table, chairs, the whole works, did not take much time, just get good at it. Teamwork. Then relax a little. If you need 12 hours of fishing at Lac Seul to catch enough, might want to brush up on that too. We had people drive by, see our set-up, and stop by for a visit, all part of the fun for us. Plead guilty to fattening up the gulls, used a gas grill, so we hardly ever started a forest fire, cleaned fresh fish, never had to just eat beans and spuds. Lost Island Lodge will supply with a nice box with everything you need for fixins. Eat sandwiches??? C'Mon Man."

1353257,wallydave,2011-09-27 08:12:00,2151,"Oh boy here we go another international dispute! I hope Congress and the UN can stay out of this debate! Must not have seen the John Candy movie! Insulting Canadian beer, almost brought the world to the brink of war! Seriously, like the search for the perfect Canadian fishing trip, the quest for the perfect beer for the trip has to just one more part of why we keep heading North! For me my beer choice has a great deal to do with the season and the temps. The warmer it is the lighter the beer, the cooler, the heavier the beer. As long as you find the beer for you, what else matters! I will take a case with me, and I will buy a case of Canadian beer when I am there. But hey thats just me! My boat cabin buddy likes his Canadian beer, so he hardly ever takes beer with him. Relax allready! Have a beer of your choice, and let the next guy do the same."
1353271,LOW1,2011-09-27 08:56:00,2828,"If we are going to have an international dispute, let's make it worthwhile. I say that we ban, worldwide, the ""sport"" (if you can call it that) of curling, and all curling equipment. If ever there as an activity that served no useful purpose, curling is it."

1330259,new hips,2011-07-15 14:48:00,498,"I agree, it's a lot of work to put on a shore lunch, I'ts one of those traditional things to do (like going to a Luau) One thing that makes life easier, wake up early get your walleye-go back to camp filet them with your electric knife and put them on ice and have breakfast. Then at noon pull up to your rock or beach and have your shore lunch (Hey my fish are clean I'll cut potatoes) I was always the 1-2 guys cleaning fish on a paddle with mosquitoes buzzing around my ears, that gets old, as the other 6 guys can't filet a walleye!!!!!!!!!! And yes my 2 walleye always count as my possession limit, because I respect the resources for future generations."
1330264,LOW1,2011-07-15 15:02:00,2828,"I like shore lunches. Especially long, leisurely ones which include at least a one hour nap.

I thought this would be a good time to bring up this view, since we are trying to stir the pot. . ."

1351762,HeHooksHimself,2011-09-21 19:38:00,725,This comment is just to get this thread on the front page. This was the reaction to the thread in which Mushmouth ranted about the MNR resurrecting the holocaust. It is only for fun.
1351789,btmbncr,2011-09-21 21:40:00,492,Hey shore lunch isn't a big deal.I enjoy it a couple of times on the trip.The food seems to tastes better when it's shore lunch.It's nice to have a break from fishing. I can't tie this to the Holocaust but Seal Team 6 had shore lunch when they whacked Bin Laden.
1351808,Mike Borger,2011-09-22 04:41:00,1554,I get it now. In this context your comment on the other thread is even funnier.Cheers (Can't believe I googled mushmouth HAHAHA!)
1351836,HeHooksHimself,2011-09-22 06:27:00,725,"This isn't the first time i have tried to be funny but then I had to explain it. These days my work performance review indicates that i reach too far for humor and my wife just shakes her head in despair- but she lets me go to Canada twice a year just to get me out of the house....which, with some danger, reminds me of a joke.Three fishermen are in a boat.Fisherman 1: ""Man, I can't believe what I have to do to be fishing today. My wife made me promise to build a new deck.""Fisherman 2; ""That's nothing, I have to remodel the kitchen!""After a moment of silence the two fishermen looked at fisherman 3 who hasn't said anything. ""Didn't you have to promise something to get to go fishing today?"" they asked.""No,"" he said, ""I just set the alarm for 4 am and when it went off I asked her if she wanted to mess around or should I just go fishing? She told me to be sure to take a jacket."""
1329994,HeHooksHimself,2011-07-14 18:48:00,725,"In deference to Mushmouth, I suggest we have a Mush of the Day thread in which someone asks a simple question and then we blow it out of proportion. Here's something I have always wondered about.What's the big deal about shore lunches? You have to carry a bunch of crap with you and then waste over an hour of fishing time slapping mosquitoes and basically preparing the same meal you are going to eat later. Why not just go back to camp if convenient and have your big meal about 2 or 3 o'clock and then fish until dark? Or just take a sandwich with you. Of course if you use a guide or American plan this may not apply, but I never understood the big deal of shore lunches. Now, if someone connects this to the holocaust, my hat will be off to you."
1329999,stevensinks,2011-07-14 19:09:00,330,HHH Im with you. I like to go in and have lunch be the big meal of the day. Maybe even take a nap.Then just a sandwich or somthing easy at night. So I guess Im no help in stiring somthing up.
1330000,joeman79,2011-07-14 19:14:00,417,"What You don't do a Shore lunch?? We try to do a couple each trip and sandwiches other days. Usually we start fishing by 6 or 7 and by noon an hour break is kinda nice. Everyone gathers and helps out with the fiesta. And there is nothing better than a fresh walleye fillet and an Ice Cold Canadian Beer for Lunch. Last year on Lac Seul the first week of August it was HOT and we found an Island near Bear Paw with a sandy Beach and enjoyed a great shore lunch and a wonderful swim that felt absolutely amazing. Its those kinds of things I really remember and it always puts a smile on my face knowing that every summer I get a chance to be with good friends and eat some GREAT FOOD and drink some cold beer in Canada. Now if your being guided, after last year I think I will stick to sandwiches because it does take an hour or 2 out your 8 hr fishing trip versus an hour or so in your own boat on a 12-15 hr fishing day. I will refrain from my Mush comment I wanted to put at the end!"
1330003,Glenman12,2011-07-14 19:15:00,762,I guess it all depends...if you are bringing out already caught fillets then I guess its no big deal..but if you are depending on your fishing ability to catch your lunch then IMO its a little more special
1330005,joeman79,2011-07-14 19:18:00,417,Thats cause Your OLD!!!!!!!!!! No the noon meals at Bow Narrows hit the spot thats for sure and that way you don't have to do the dishes.
1330009,Guest,2011-07-14 19:30:00,0,"Shore lunches should be outlawed. People who do that catch their daily limit in the morning, eat them at lunch, leave their fire burning ... and then go back out and catch another day's limit while watching the forest burn on the horizon. Good enough?"
1330010,unclepaully,2011-07-14 19:35:00,112,"All I know is that I love shore lunch. For some reason it tastes so much better than back at camp. My dad went on his first Canada trip last year and every time we talk about it, it always comes back to how fun and great shore lunches were."
1330015,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-14 19:44:00,1460,shore lunch is awesome as long as you don't have to cook or fillet
