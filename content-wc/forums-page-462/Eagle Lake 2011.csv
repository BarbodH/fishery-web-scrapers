Fishing was good considering the weather, was in the 90's when we got there, then got snowed on in the middle of the week, then back in the 60's and sunny. One of the best parts of the trip was actually meeting some other Walleye Central members; Danbear, boynurse77, fishinnut3446, lund03 and v-bay gord. Thanks guys, it made for a very memorable part of the trip. We will have to see if we can get together again. Terry"
1353673,Rich B,2011-09-28 17:58:00,1081,So how was the fishing ? Bet the pesky black flies disappeared once it started snowing (ha) ! I think one of the reasons I enjoy fall fishing so well is that there are no (or very few bugs). Have heard Eagle lake is an excellent fishery.....what all did you get into ? Rich B
1353712,Danbear,2011-09-28 20:20:00,72,"As NARDA 1 said the weather was hot and cold, we still had pretty good fishing we caught more slot walleyes this year than any other year, but no real pigs this year 23"" walleyes were the biggest, also caught a 37"" pike and saw boynurse77 have a few exciting musky follows but could never get the hooks in one. It was great to meet the other guys from WC and I hope I get to see them all again. Already planning for next year."

I was planning on getting together with your gang over at Birchdale but it was not to be. Weather that week was challenging......as was the next....glad you were still able to have a good time. Things are coming to a close for me on Eagle for the season......it was an excellent year. I will be posting some MNR info on the latest fishery survey on the blog soon, I think you will find it interesting! I really find it amazing the groups and the traditions that are established over time...the Narda gang is one example. I'm sure there are many others that find the annual treck to the Canadian destination special. Here is a toast to all those that take the time to establish traditions, friendships and good times up here in this part of Ontario. We appreciate your loyalties, and friendships more than you might realize. All the best on your future trips to Canada!!! V-Bay Gord"
