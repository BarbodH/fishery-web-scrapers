Spring and early summer work the points. Start shallow and slowly move to deeper water until you find them. Mid summer work the mid bay humps. This is were a GPS with a lake chip really helps because there are a lot of smaller humps that produce very well but can be a challange finding with out a lake chip. Late summer early fall they move back to the points. late fall early winter work the channels. I know this is very general but it's the standard way to fish walleye. We have caught just about everything there is in that lake working this pattern. One caution Bigstone can be interesting if your running of the marked routes. There are a lot of rocks that can cause major problems in the north eastern area of the Bay. One thing of interest is early spring Route Bay can be a ton of fun becasue that's where Blindfold Lake drains into LOTW and the action can be really fun. I have causght a ton of fish off Heenan Point and off a couple of areas off Copper Island. This last summer it was so good that I only put about 425 miles on the boat and we ate fish every day for 9 weeks. My wife caught a 28 that pushed 11 pounds. The walleye were very fat this year. Hope this helps. I prefer the 15 to 17 inch for eating and we had a load of those. I jig fish with leeches. I do know a couple of guys that pull plugs but catch bigger fish that I won't knife for eating. We release most fish over 18 inches, and all over 20."
