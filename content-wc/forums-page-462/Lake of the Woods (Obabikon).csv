All the keepers were 17.5""-19"" and we threw back three over 23"". Just an awesome walleye day. Threw in 15 jumbo perch... no crappie on the big lake. Must've been 25-30 boats heading up to the elbow."
1352627,Moondog,2011-09-24 21:25:00,362,Sweet!!! Did the lake flip yet???
1352658,steve.a,2011-09-25 07:41:00,274,Were you fishing Obabikon Bay or Lake? At what size do no longer keep them ( catch & release )? We were at Nestor Falls last week and did very well and sorry to hear that you had an accident there a couple of weeks ago.
1352751,Obabikon,2011-09-25 12:16:00,2370,"Personally, I throw them all back. I keep 14-15"" fish for lunches. It's up to a guest. I encourage them to release anything over 21"". But, by no means is that mandatory for someone to do. We were catching them in the bay for the most part. Thanks for the condolences Steve."
1352756,Muddy Waters,2011-09-25 12:46:00,45,"Sounds wierd - resident limit is 4 so not sure how you arrived at 10 fish? Also, only one can be over 18 inches!"
1352782,Obabikon,2011-09-25 14:24:00,2370,"""had two residents fishing with me"" 4+4+2=10 And it's 18.1 inches Muddy... three of them were above that. I wouldn't break the law and then post it on here. Everyone knows who I am, so why would I do that?"
