1354809,steve.a,2011-10-03 11:42:00,274,Other than at the crappie holes a good stereo with some Metallica or Guns & Roses cranked up works well for those that get too close.
1354945,Mike Borger,2011-10-03 19:26:00,1554,"I wouldn't dream of fishing near anyone else, no matter what the situation.If someone's on my intended spot when I arrive I'll find another spot. If someone greases me out of my spot I'll leave them to it and look for another spot.What I really can't stand is when guys start following me around the lake to see where I'm fishing.I suppose that's a compliment though.In any case each to their own, none of that stuff really bothers me. To me it's simply a sign of inexperience, not necessarily rudeness.Getting mad and confronting said offenders is a waste of energy and frankly makes you look pretty small."
1354265,Slowboat,2011-09-30 22:38:00,18,I fish LOTW at Sioux Narrows and have had similiar problems with the Blue fiberglass guide boats(Totem) ---usually won't pull in on us but will pass fairly close to going nearly wide open when we are fishing----they usually have plenty of room to go around or at least slow down ---that agravates me to no end as I would never think of doing that to them---YET
1354280,HeHooksHimself,2011-10-01 05:27:00,725,"OOOO, that strikes another chord. I hate that when boats buzz you when you are fishing a narrows or curve. for crying out loud, slow the boat down so you don' blast them out of the boat. Simple ettiquette and common sense."
1354291,Guest,2011-10-01 06:09:00,0,"I agree with the blue boats on LOTW. When fishing in the spring where the fishing spots are plenty I have had there boats move in very close. Something must have changed but if I was paying for a day of fishing with a guide the last thing I would want them to do is pull up to another boat that is catching fish. In my mind if I was a guide I would have an unlimited amount of spots. I am not a guide and I have enough spots that I do not pull up on other boats. I am sure most of the poeple who visit Canada do it for the same reasons, good fishing, and lack of people!"
1354295,steve.a,2011-10-01 06:27:00,274,About the going too fast when passing a boat fishing does it matter if they are in a marked route? I have rode with a guide that said if people want to fish in these spots they have to put up with the traffic. I had to stop this year at split rock narrows for a boat that was fishing the area between the red marker and the island. When a 20' boat like mine takes off it leaves a much larger wake than when on plane as they found out. Mine also leaves a bigger wake at 15 mph than 30 mph.
1354311,SeulAreaWalleye,2011-10-01 07:38:00,100,"I have never pulled right up to another boat on the lake and started fishing. It is just plain rude and ridiculous. As a guide, I prefer to spend my trips in areas with the least amount of boat traffic.On waters as huge as we have in the Lac Seul East end, there is no reason. STILL, many, many times a boat has pulled up to where I am fishing(usually to just watch us catch the fish then leave...lol). Boats troll around me, and constantly slow down(which creates a bigger wave), to see if any one had a fish on. I simply ask my guest to turn their back and fight the fish low, to try an keep the onlookers from pulling in. Other guides(with next to no experience) that I don't know will often try this too, this just looks bad on them. Here is what you'll experience if you decide to fish right beside my guided trip....1. LOTS of LOUD laughter and cursing, as most of my crews know how to speak the correct lingo at the right moment.2. Big Jigs and other lures flying in your direction......3. The embarrassment of watching me run around netting, baiting, tying, and taking pics while you may catch a fish or two or maybe nothing at all, as many times the fish are schooled tight, and the correct technique is the only thing producing.Please everyone out there, have some angler etiquette, and find your own spots, or try it when I am done. It is also not reccommended following me, as I may just take all of the shortcuts through areas that I can just clear the motor, while fully trimmed up......If you are not paying for a guide, please don't try to use their knowledge for free, especially on someone else's dime!If you are a new guide on the water, spend some time teaching yourself your own waters and techniques and STOP guiding your trips right beside me, as those crews will call me for their next trip.......To everyone else that fishes up here, does their own thing, respects other boats, and leaves them alone to have their own solitude in fishing....I hope they all keep coming back and enjoying that incredible fishing that we have every day.*The only exception to this is in May, when few areas are holding large quantities of walleye, and many trophies...but still, everyone should stay a casts length away!"
1354327,AllenW,2011-10-01 09:01:00,11482,"Out of all of this the only problem I have is the boats in a congested narrows/whatever where the main flow of boat traffic is routed.I slow down, but my slow wake can be more than if I'm up on plane, so I mostly slow because of safety reasons.On the other hand, fishing something like the Can line on Pool 4 can have a row of boats strung out a half mile long or longer, in a case like that I just slow a bit and run though them as best I can safelyIf I see a boat fishing in a spot, I figure myself and anybody else doesn't have the right to interfere with their fishing, pro, guide, or otherwise.No exceptions.Al"
1354328,Obabikon,2011-10-01 09:06:00,2370,"Personally, slowing down is much worse than going through at full speed. The best option is not going too close, but that's not always an option. I don't typically want someone boating by me at a trolling speed, and 1/4 throttle is much worse than just going through up on plain. Just tip your hat and give a small wave saying excuse me. I got the middle finger this year for boating by someone fishing the narrows into Obabikon Lake. If you don't want people boating by you, don't fish high traffic areas. I just put my hands in the air and gestured that I was going to Obabikon Lake. How else am I supposed to get there?"
1354551,btmbncr,2011-10-02 14:26:00,492,"ObabI have fished in Obabakan Lake in the fall.Six other boats showed up so we left,no big deal.We went and caught walleyes in some other spots and found another crappie spot elsewhere.Fished out of Black Island Lodge,bad lodge experience,great fishing though.Don't fish LOW anymore."
1354558,Obabikon,2011-10-02 14:40:00,2370,"btm, Sorry to hear you had a bad experience with Black Island. I haven't gotten to know them at all, even though they're not far from me. I'm glad you found crappies in additional spots. There aren't a lot of them out there this time of year."
1354564,btmbncr,2011-10-02 14:58:00,492,"SeulAreaWalleyeI've had 2 guide boats move in on a spot I was fishing,right on top of me,on Lac Seul before.The shiners were spawning and I had found an inside bend on a weedline the fish were just stack in.I had been up there the 3 days previous with no other boats on the spot.It happens,no big deal.With all the information available,electronics,maps and 50 plus years of walleye fishing experience it isn't too hard for me to find ""spots"" to catch fish.Sometimes other people have found the same ""spots"" I have and show up there to fish.That's just fishing.I have told friends that guide about spots I had been doing good so they could put their parties on fish when things were tough.I enjoy going on a guided fishing trip.It is a great way to find out where to navigate to avoid the hazards.You catch fish and learn what the lake is doing at the time your there.Cuts the learning curve down.I always learn something new on a guide trip.Went out one evening with my 87 year old father and Gary from Evergreen Lodge.One of the best experiences of my fishing career.It wasn't super hot action but we caught quality fish and had a great time.His ""guide"" stories and our banter between fish was great.Bill"
1354173,wallydave,2011-09-30 13:59:00,2151,"Every trip up North I have ever been on has had some fishing spot issues. The one fly-in we went on found us sitting on one of the guides favorite spots, we were there first, we had never been on this lake before, so its not like we knew the lake, but we were catching lakers one after another, the guides boat was not having any luck, so they gave us a few dirty looks and left.The rest of my trips have been to the NW end of Lac Seul, when you could fish the Sanctuary June 1. So the Rapids and the Mouth of the River were always ""packed"" with boats. We would be in our Camp boats, bringing walleye after walleye, a guide or guest with a ""fancy"" boat would crowd us, an we would still be bringing em in, while they just looked like we had taken thier spot.As mentioned before some times of the season the fish and those trying to catch em will be in close quarters. The best way to make the folks that crowd you mad is to keep hitting the fish, while they can only watch!"
1354187,steve.a,2011-09-30 14:59:00,274,I agree with Obabikon about the schooling season for crappies as this sometimes gets to be almost a social thing on the lake. It is a good time to check out some boats and fishing styles. Always remember to bring a pee can as there are families there during this time.
1354188,wallydave,2011-09-30 15:05:00,2151,"I did not mention that we have had some good boat to boat conversations while fishing LS! I have met good folks from both the US and Canada while waiting for the next bite! As long as the conversation is friendly and no one gets all worked up and we show some respect to our fellow anglers, there is no real harm in sharing!"
1354195,Obabikon,2011-09-30 15:50:00,2370,"tv, I never said that a guide has more rights to specific water. Everyone has the same rights. All I said about the guides is this... etiquette be ****ed, you MUST catch fish for the guests. I can't tell you the number of times on Wednesday I was catching fish with guests... a couple boats slowly boated by, saw us catching fish. The next day we go back to the same spot, and those boats are sitting on it. Do I have a right to fish the spot? I typically don't, unless the fishing is slow everywhere else. In the fall, fish school. The area you're fishing might go from having 100 spots that are actively fishable to... 5 spots. The fishing condenses, and that means people need to show more patience with others. As someone who does quite a bit of guiding, I have had a TON of people move in on me. In the fall, I let it roll off my back. In the spring and summer, it's different. Spread out."
1354201,ManitouBass,2011-09-30 16:06:00,201,"This topic always comes up a few times per year, and the discussion is usually identical to the times prior. Fishing etiquette should be practised by all anglers. I've had boats move in on us, and I have no problem with it as long as your not completely rude about it. I've had some good convos and shared tactics with these people, no bid deal. If your guiding and someone is on your spot, well make a decision. Approach the area and be decent with fellow anglers. If their half decent humans, they'll have no problem with this. Again, don't be rude about it and most of the time it should be fine. On certain lakes, like LOTW and Rainy Lake, it doesn't matter if fish are schooling up, there are still spots, if you can't get within striking distance. There always is on these MASSIVE fisheries. Both sides of the argument are def. worth bringing up, soemtimes people just needd to ease up and be polite. It's not the end of your fishing days. Just my two cents"
1354203,btmbncr,2011-09-30 16:16:00,492,"I really miss the logic of moving in on schooling fish being different than when they're spread out.I find it a little hard to believe that the crappies in LOW all school on a couple of spots in the fall.I didn't see this when I fished there in the fall.The logic that the guide has his day planned out is a stretch for me also.Most guys have some idea of what or where they are going to look for fish.Good manners are good manners,period.The whole lake is open to everybody.Along time ago I got over being upset about having other boats show up when I was catching fish.Just my opinion.Bill"
1354204,ManitouBass,2011-09-30 16:19:00,201,That about sums it up for me as well.
1354205,steve.a,2011-09-30 16:19:00,274,I will say that I have been guilty of seeing someone fish a spot that I have not fished but try it the next day. Every year I will try to find new spots and wonder how many good spots are out there unknown. Also have been guilty of having lunch with a marker out in the middle of nowhere and have the net out when a boat goes bye. A version of the Ali rope-a-dope.
1354208,Obabikon,2011-09-30 16:45:00,2370,"btm, have you fished Obabikon Lake? It's a very shallow lake. There's one area in the entire lake that gets to 20 feet deep (with a couple of small holes). That's called the elbow. All the crappies in the lake go to the same spot. In the summer, I know a TON of spots to fish crappies in Obabikon. Sunken trees, old beaver huts, weed beds... not in the fall. It's one spot. I've spent my entire life on this lake, and all I can say is that it's true. On the ""big"" lake... there's more spots, but not a bunch. Mud Portage, a few deep beeches, bottle bay area, a reef on the southern side of Myles, thompson, and hay island area (but that's further from here). It's still VERY limited. My point again wasn't against etiquette, but just pointing out that earning a living is important. Guides do have to battle GPS units, people moving in on them, a bad economy, and other issues... the biggest deal is to make sure the guest catches fish and hires them again. I don't rely on guiding days to make a living, however, I know people who do. Typically, I feel a little more compassion/understanding for them. Most guides though, have enough self pride to want to do it ""alone"". I would put money that most offenses in etiquette come from guests/visitors."
1354259,FrankLeigh,2011-09-30 21:28:00,80,"No matter where you go, there is always the chance of meeting up with some jerks. This year, while fishing a new lake (for our party), we found a reef and caught a couple of nice walleye. We located the edges and put out a couple of markers and started to work a pattern, Within half an hour we had three other boats join us !!! This is a 20 square mile lake !!!Another time, on Lake Huron, I had a guide run over my line, while I was playing a heavy fish. (I think that I could have made a good case for justifiable homicide.)Most people that you meet, on the water, or in camp, or elsewhere, are decent folks, but there is always that 1 %. Usually, if someone parks beside me on the water, I like to say something, like ""oh, I'm sorry, I didn""t know that I was in your spot"".More good memories than bad, is what matters. Don't let some jerk spoil an otherwise great trip."
1354048,steve.a,2011-09-30 06:21:00,274,When I go to a spot that I want to fish and get there sometimes a boat might be on it so I just go to another. I have seen guide boats fishing on LOTW and would never horn in on them but several times over the years will have them stop right next to me. This happened again last week when we were on a walleye hole and had him come within about 20' from me. If we did the same I am sure there would be some words. I do know this is common when the crappie are in but this was not the case. There was not a lot of boats on the water so there was plenty of spots as LOTW is a pretty big pond. I know this might be better for the fishing forum but I have only had this happen when fishing in Canada.
1354060,Obabikon,2011-09-30 07:27:00,2370,"Steve, I'm a believer that there's lots of spots. However, this time of year, the walleyes and crappie are schooled in specific areas. Those spots become ""community"" spots. In the summer, when they're spread out over humps, points, and shore lines... that's a different story. Also, not sure where you were fishing, but you're much more likely to have people ""move in on you"" if you're fishing close to a resort. Or, close to a ""high taffic"" zone."
1354065,Bill Krejca,2011-09-30 07:44:00,6107,"I have to agree with Jared - in the fall there are sometimes a limited number of spots in which the fish are gathered. At this time, there are few""secret"" spots, so boats are likely to congregate in those areas. The fact that a boat was already there, in most cases, probably had little to do with ""horning in"", as folks may go from spot to spot, not necessarily looking for new ""hotspots"", but already planning on visiting their select spots. Doing such, of course, does not justify parking within boarding range of another fellow angler, or other highly space sensitive unsportsman-like actions. During other times of the year, moving in on another boat would normally be considered in bad taste. Bill Krejca"
1354078,steve.a,2011-09-30 08:42:00,274,We were in the area of where Stevens and Stony come together. I know that if your fishing some spots like the mouth of Turtle there is probably going to have more boats. I was just wondering how the guides would react if you came right on them. I know some that will try to follow a guide around to find his spots but I would think that pretty rude. I am sure that there is as much difference in guides as there are in fisherman. I have fished with people that when they see a guide boat they will want to go in on him but that is not my style. Something about going 1000 miles to get in the LOTW and fishing next to someone does not seem right. But if I had a choice between sitting here typing or being on LOTW fishing next to someone hmmm..........
1354087,tv4fish,2011-09-30 09:07:00,2694,"Just my opinion here -- ""moving in"" or starting to fish within 20 feet of another boat is ALWAYS in bad taste. That's when the big ""jerk"" baits just might start flying."
1354093,Obabikon,2011-09-30 09:22:00,2370,"Ever fish the elbow on lake of the woods when the crappie are going nuts? I've seen 40+ boats up there before... in an area that's not much bigger than a football field. If you casted a ""jerk"" bait, you'd cross half a dozen boats. I'm a HUGE believer in fishing etiquette. However, when you're a guide, you have your day planned out for the most part. The guests are the most important thing. So, if you know fish are in a specific spot... it's difficult to pass by and look for a spot that might not be producing. Basically, the rules completely change once the schooling process starts. Guides understand this too, and unless they're just jerks... accept it. That said... following a boat around is an unacceptable practice. Especially following a guide around... as he is reliant on making a living from his fishing knowledge. If you would like a guide's knowledge, paying for it is the correct way to handle that. Many of the guys up here don't live lavish lives, and could actually use the work."
1354101,HeHooksHimself,2011-09-30 09:43:00,725,"I find it in poor taste to pull your boat within casting range of another boat, no matter when and where. Another pet peeve of mine is when you are drifting a shoreline and someone comes and anchors in the middle of your drift. If the other boat is not part of our group, we always move on when we realize someone is in the spot we were shooting for as we would expect others do for us. But, that's just me."
1354115,cast_and_blast,2011-09-30 10:07:00,1098,"I've got to disagree. Don't care if the guide has his day planned out or not, if they show up to a spot that is already ""taken"", they should move on. I'm betting the clients aren't too pleased either, sitting in the guide boat and getting the dirty looks and/or comments as the guide is maneuvering 20' from another boat. I've had guide boats on Rainy zoom right in on me on Rainy Lake - even when I'm out in the middle of nowhere! Had one hook my bright orange marker buoy - twice - as I was no less than 40' from it actively fishing the reef. The folks in the boat looked a bit sheepish as I moved in and rolled up my marker buoy. So - as much as guides expect folks to ""back off"", I expect the same from them. It's a 220,000 acre lake (Rainy) - find another spot! Scott"
1354116,Guest,2011-09-30 10:09:00,0,I'm going to chime in on this one. I have been going to LOTW Morson for about 40 Years. I will agree that when crappie fishing you will be fishing close to a few boats at times. Key fall spots maybe a boat or two. Spring thru Late summer- unacceptable in my eyes. Guide or not. I had an experience this summer out by Pony island fishing a specific hump on a very large reef system. We had just come over this spot no bigger than a 100x100 hump pulling bouncers . We catch and net a fish when a boat is coming past and sure enough they pull in and throw a marker right off the back of my boat as I pass back over the hump again. I was not a happy camper. Even it was their favorite spot on the whole lake it is unacceptable on a body of water this size. I said a few words to my guests and got the H--- out of there. That type of conduct is plain rude. I would say that 98 % of the Fisherman around the Morson area feel the same and respect other boaters as I do. It's a big play ground with room for everyone to find a place to fish by themselves. Now if we could just get rid of the GPS some of these people would not even leave the dock. I would have to say it has definately opened up the lake to farther travels. Ten years ago you would hardly see a boat out in that area. BVR & New Moon guides and a few old timers. You would never have to share a spot with them. Sorry if I seemed to vent too much.... just got under my skin this summer and wanted say my peace. JT
1354137,tv4fish,2011-09-30 11:21:00,2694,"Say What !!! Last I checked --we're talking about fishing ""Public water"" here - What rules change ?? In my opinion - guides have NO more of a right than ""Joe Q. Public"".Here's a quote that may apply:Quote: We have many ""rights"" in this great country of ours but just because we have a right to do something doesn't mean it's right to do. Quote: Sorry if I seemed to vent too much.... just got under my skin this summer and wanted say my peace.JT JT: I don't think you have anything at all to apologize for --- this issue is one of the things that also irritates me the most."
