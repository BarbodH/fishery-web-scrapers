1352428,btmbncr,2011-09-24 05:17:00,492,Has anyone pulled cranks deep at this time of the year on the Ear Falls end of Lac Seul.If the walleyes are deep and keying on smelt it would seem to be a good method for catching hawg eye's.Fireline and Bomber 25A's or Reef Runners?Leadcore and minnow baits or Shad Raps/Flicker Shads/Wally Divers?Is there any of the deep sand structure(like the sandbanks in McKenzie Bay) on the NW end of the lake? Thanks Bill

We have best luck by trolling/drifing with jigs and spinners with minnows working the best. Tried some crawlers too this past summer/but the minnow bite was the best.....never had much luck with reef runners/shads. This past summer the walleyes were a little deeper in 15-35 feet of water due to hot weather and low water level. Previous years we fished same areas 5-15 FOW. We caught a lot of very fat walleyes 23-25"" and also caught a 26"", 27 1/2"", 28 1/4"" and a 32"" catch of a lifetime!!! All were caught on minnows/jigs! 10 months to go and counting down the days to our trip back to Lac Seul! RBF"
1353507,Riceburner,2011-09-27 21:22:00,436,We have tried pulling the deep Reefrunners etc around the breaks and flats around Windigo Point the first week of August--and mainly caught Northerns--few walleyes.
