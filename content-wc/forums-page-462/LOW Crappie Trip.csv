A great guy with many stories to tell. Fished LOW, Stevens Bay and west, with 5 other friends, fishing mainly for crappies. Crappie bite was not as good as normal, weather conditions/temp was probably 2 weeks late, leaves hardly colored. Water temp on arrival was 62 degrees, about 58 a week later when we came home. As a result of the water temp, I believe, the crappies were not congregated in the deep waters. Got 1-2, then had to move to a new spot, school clouds were either nonexistent, or else they would barely bite, if we did find them. We did probably get more walleyes than usual, while fishing crappies. There should be some excellent walleye fishing in a few years, as I don't remember ever getting so many small ones, of various years' hatches. Deferred the 22 mile trip to Obabikon Lake after chatting with fellow author Duane Lund near Hay Island. He said he got in OK, but a larger boat got stuck in the entrance and had to be pulled out. The water is really down this year. Weather was agreeable most of the time. On Tuesday, we had a windy rain, which would have been a raincoat tester's delight, heavy driving wet pellets. After enjoying it as much as we could stand, we finally boated back to the cabin, conditions being reminiscent of a leisurely stroll through a car wash! It didn't matter whether we were wearing Guidewear, Gortex, or Rainex, we all received an ample soaking into the multiple layers of clothing. The inside of the cabin looked like Mrs. O'Leary's wash day, with wet garments drying everywhere. Water in Sabaskong was clearer than I have seen it for quite some time, I suppose due to the dry summer. There was not as much boat activity this year, actually the last several years. We got all fish on tube jigs or bucktail jigs, didn't use any live bait, as is usual for the fall trip, most fish were taken in 25-40 ft of water. Got the usual amount of smallmouth, pike, and bite offs that always accompany crappie fishing. We also did boat a number of very large perch., which were tasty. Still had a great time in God's Country, and heading back next year for sure! Bill Krejca"

We did well on the crappie until that rain and wind hit then had a hard time finding them. It was hard to fish in that wind for me on the front of my boat but my two buddies seemed to like the top and windshield. One day I was west of Hay when the waves were bigger than I can remember and also decided not to go to the Obabikon because of low water. The perch are tasty and getting bigger every year."

Great bunch of people.Sorry to hear about the tough conditions, but thats what makes trips memorable, and makes the really good trips thats MUCH MORE memorable, lol. Too be honest with you, I think the extreme weather we've had from spring till now has changed some patterns. I've been seeing bluegill, crappie and pumpkin seeds in rainy for the first time ever. It's funny what water highs and lows will do to the patterns. We caught walleye this weekend in 4ft of water, crystal clear at noon hour, makes alot of sense, hey? lolHopefully next year we can get out for some walleye and crappies on northwest bay."

Later in the week we began catching fish in current areas. All sizes of fish. Did very well on crappies. Fished Miles Bay exclusively and limited out (2) on really good sized crappies. Crappie rigs with minnows. 30 FOW. Weather sent us home early. Heading back in a week."
