1350927,J-Man,2011-09-19 13:12:00,191,Several groups of anglers did quite well in Obabikon Lake over the weekend. Not much going on in Miles Bay yet accoring to the reports we have received. No word from anyone of our regulars that has tried Hay Island.Water temps ranged from 60-61 near Morson and 62-63 in some deeper water basins last night while I was out casting. The fall fishing season is officially kicking into high gear.
1350971,Hntnfsh4evr,2011-09-19 15:38:00,5,"Good to hear. Heading up Saturday for a full week. Staying in Nestor Falls so Obabikon/Miles Bay might be a touch far, hopefully around Hay Island. Plan to fish for whatever is biting including crappie, walleye, perch and smallmouth. Any advice for locations of the other species given existing water temps?"
1351009,J-Man,2011-09-19 17:40:00,191,"Current is often key for walleyes in the fall. There are some good (and obvious) current ears coming towards the Hay Island area from Nestor. Those would be good bets to start. Bass are often relating to humps/reefs in the fall the way walleyes do in the summer. jigging with minnows can be dynamite. I've never been able to figure out a ""perch hole"" but there seems to be a few places people pick them up. Usually near deep water. Good luck."
1351020,Obabikon,2011-09-19 18:31:00,2370,"Justin, When you're picking up walleyes... slide out another 5 feet deeper. That's typically where you'll pick up the perch. They've been getting very popular the past few years."
1351140,Hntnfsh4evr,2011-09-20 06:15:00,5,"Thanks for the help gentlemen, I will post a report when I get back. I suppose I am one of the few who would rather get into the walleye, 10-12"" perch and 12""+ crappie on LOTW than musky!"
1351160,J-Man,2011-09-20 07:16:00,191,"Jared: Good to know. I can pass the info along to people that ask, but it sure won't be me out there catching walleyes and sliding off another 5 feet deeper to pick up perch. HAHA Yes, the perch that we've been seeing the last few years have been quite impressive! It seems to be lake wide, with walleyes, northerns and muskies being quite well fed as well. Assuming you guys are find the same out there. Hntnfsh4evr: Still way more walleye anglers out there than muskie hunters. Especially this time of year with the crappies being a major player as well....the numbers of muskie fisherman are way less..which makes it even better to be out there casting right now."
1351230,J-Man,2011-09-20 10:48:00,191,"Reliable report from a couple of seasonal guests that they did quite well in the Thompson Creek area yesterday..(9/19,)Will be nice to have both areas going good this weekend. Gonna be a pile of boats out there unless the weather turns totally horse poop."
1355048,J-Man,2011-10-04 08:05:00,191,"Spoke to a group of guys that spent the weekend fishing in Miles Bay for crappies that said they had excellent action. Heard the same story from another boat that came off the lake from the Miles Bay area over the weekend.Big walleyes have been running hot in the 30 foot of water range as well. Mulitple 25s, plus 26, 27 and 28 inchers the last couple days for another group of 3 boats fishing with spinners, 1.5 ounce sinkers and minnows. Even the muskie action was hot over the weekend. Fish in the 43-47 range caught by 4 different boats with multiple big fish follows and boatside strikes resulting in near misses. What a great time of the year!"
