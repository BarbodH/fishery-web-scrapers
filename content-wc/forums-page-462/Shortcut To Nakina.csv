1352993,tooski,2011-09-26 10:53:00,393,I know they are not the same. i have taken Cribb four times in the last 2 years. Just relaying what the locals told me about the fish moving out of the main lake. You are more than welcome to hit it hard with the jigging spoons in 32 feet though.
1353177,pike50plus,2011-09-26 21:31:00,584,No traffic either
1353178,pike50plus,2011-09-26 21:33:00,584,"Good road!, just dusty gravel but pretty smooth."
1353197,Mike Borger,2011-09-27 02:22:00,1554,Thanks Sam. I'm just walking out the door right now HAHA!
1352461,Mike Borger,2011-09-24 08:17:00,1554,"I've never been a fan of the gravel road but so many people are telling me it's a major time saver. Just east of Longlac there's a road called the blueberry road that goes straight to Nakina. Have any of you guys travelled it this year? What's it like, is it a decent road? Heading up there early next week and I'm wavering on whether or not to try it."
1352480,Curryale,2011-09-24 09:00:00,50,Was on it the first week of August this year in a mini van. The road was in good shape. There are a few areas where you have to pay attention because of a speed bumps but they are marked with red flagging tape. Big time saver.
1352549,Mike Borger,2011-09-24 16:32:00,1554,"Thanks for the feedback, appreciate it."
1352651,GOBIG,2011-09-25 07:02:00,126,"Our group also looked for it. We asked at the gas station and were told if we were not familiar with it then do not try it. I would be willing to do it, if we could find it for sure. Some of the roads up in ontario are not marked very good... A map may help if it is on the map..."
1352708,Mike Borger,2011-09-25 09:59:00,1554,"Just checked quickly and the Blueberry Rd. is clearly marked as such on google maps. I took the road once years ago and it was a shortcut but very rough. I've subsequently always stuck to the pavement. Seems it's the way to go these days, so it's worth a shot. I'll let you guys know how it went. Cheers"
1352729,deputy dog,2011-09-25 10:50:00,305,"I thought I remember reading in another thread that it only cuts off around 30 mins...not sure that would be worth it, unless your up for the adventure"
1352780,TIGHTLINER,2011-09-25 14:12:00,223,Solo.. Where are you headed to fish this time out of Nakina???
1352784,Mike Borger,2011-09-25 14:39:00,1554,"Lower Twin Lakes, a drive to resort. A bit of fishing, and my buddy's going to do a bit of hunting. Headed up there with no expectations other than having a good time. We'll hit 'er hard though, and I'll definitely let you guys know how it went. Cheers"
1352976,tooski,2011-09-26 10:17:00,393,"Just back from Abamasagi. Cribb road is the shortcut, not Blueberry. Cribb is about 200 yards west of the cemetery in Longlac. Nice road for gravel. i did around fifty most of the time ( no trailer).The fish have moved into the river up there Solo. We only caught a handful of walleye in the main lake, the rest (and it was very good) were at the river mouth"
1352986,Mike Borger,2011-09-26 10:35:00,1554,"Glad to hear your trip went well bud, but nothing on jigging spoons in deeper water? I'm seriously shocked LOL!There's always hordes of smaller walleye hanging around the rivers.The crib road and the blueberry road aren't the same roads.Crib road runs N/W off hwy 11 and hits 584 south of Nakina.The blueberry road runs straight north and hits Nakina just east of town."
