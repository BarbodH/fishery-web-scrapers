We're experiencing the worst bite ever for me on this lake, but it's turned into one of my favorite trips ever. We're the only two fishermen on the lake, along with two bow hunters and the camp owner. Weather has been great. Scenery is outstanding and we've managed several nice pike and plenty of action on walleyes. We've had to work harder than usual to find fish, but that's part of the package. We expected to fly out last Saturday morning, but the moose hunters wanted to extend two days, trying to catch a minor cold snap. It worked for them. They got a big bull yesterday morning, but had to track until sunset last night before locating him. So, they need to spend today dragging their kill out of the bush. It will take a while. Today we'll be turning a 7 day trip into a 10 day stay, with nothing to do except: sleep about 7 hours tonight, fish all day in 70+ degree weather, enjoy ever improving scenery and eat 4 little walleyes for dinner.We're in camp with super nice people.We'll be heading back to Tennessee though Thunder Bay so we can catch leaves at their fall peak along the north shore of Lake Superior.Don't ever pass up a fall trip to Northwest Ontario. It's about more than just catching fish."

We also stopped in the quilt shop in Grand Marais. My wife loved all the fabrics with northern motif. Great give and take. Wife shared my passion by going with me fishing(I did have to lug up her sewing machine) and I stopped at every quilt store I could find on way back to Colorado. A trade off I will take anyday.Have a great time on the rest of your trip."
