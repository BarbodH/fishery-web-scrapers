The fishing on the Ivanhoe River was great. Raney Lake and Denyes Lake were not as productive. The 7 of us caught over 400 Walleye, 50 Pike and many Small Mouth Bass. Biggest Walleye was 26.5 inches and 5.3 Lbs, the biggest Northern Pike was 33.5 inches and 8.1 Lbs. The lodge is like a Holiday Inn in the bush. Peter is an exceptional fish cleaner, fish cooker and host. I will go back because the price is right."
