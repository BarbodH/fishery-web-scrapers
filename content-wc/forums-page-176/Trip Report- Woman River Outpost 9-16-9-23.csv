Since we are getting older and our wives were worried about our health, we promised to stop on the way, which we did in Virginia at the AmericInn. Adequate provisions for a confiscatory price, but we knew immediately why they provided ear plugs as a ""courtesy."" It seems like the train whistles are right outside your window and intended solely for you. We got a laugh out of it and left Saturday to complete our journey. Now, Woman River Camp is pretty far up there and we finally arrived after a lupper in Ear Falls at about 4:00. The weather was wet and we put all of our stuff in plastic bags and Bruce, the dockman, was chucking stuff in the boat. I felt I was losing track of my ""stuff,"" but most of it ended up at the outpost camp. The first thing we encountered upon arrival was a 45 degree ramp from the floating dock to the stationary dock due to the low water. We got used to it after a few days, but I am sure Bruce, our escort, thought we were going to have a rough week when he saw us crawling up on hands and knees. At least he did most of the unloading. Our first impression of the outpost is that it was pretty rustic. It has an interesting history since it was originally built as a stop for early traders to take part in the ""world's oldest profession."" You could see how what is now storage buildings were little ""pleasure cabins."" My initial thought was that Lundyrig, whose group was the week before us, left a little of a mess, but after a while, I realized that it is what it is! The worst part though, Eric, was the rotten worms left in the refrigerator. Removing the dead worms seemed to take care of the stench. Additionally, Lundyrig was going to leave us his hot spots, but all he did was left his brag chart. Congrats on the 27 1/2 inch walleye. The weather was pretty wet most of the week- our rain gear got a workout. We struggled a little with the fishing. We befriended Dave and Wayne who would come all the way up from the main camp every day. We heard a lot of ""we were tearing them up over there a few days ago!"" We were catching 10 -15 fish a day, enough to eat and we enjoyed ourselves, but we were hoping to find a ""hole."" It was a good opportunity for catching up, conversing and solving world problems, but Doc's hearing is getting so bad that I had to carry on both ends of the conversation, or maybe he was just ignoring me- that's a possibility. The week wore on and we were enjoying the solitude, eating well and drinking plenty, but hoping for better fishing action. Finally on late Friday afternoon, we caught a walleye in a spot we had seen Wayne and Dave fish. We drifted that hole the rest of the day until darkness forced our hand and pulled 23 fish out of there in 2 hours. We had a double of 23's and lost as many as we caught since the would not swallow our goliath minnows on the first hit. Oh if we only had a couple more days! I will say that the fishing is usually better on these waters and I think we just hit a tough week. I can't say enough about how much I appreciate how Moss runs his camp. It is the little things- every boat has a Lowrance depth finder and a good quality rubber net. The motors run well and the boats don't leak and are relatively clean. Printed weather reports provided for the week and frequent checks on the outpost. Classy job, Paul! We didn't target pike, so out biggest pike was below the slot. Biggest walleye was 25"" and biggest smallmouth was 18"" We only caught 3 smallies. Now we have to endure the winter until our June trip! Fish On! Hooks"
