5748201,Shane Denotter,2017-08-31 16:24:00,39,We caught a few northerns but nothing over 30 inches. Didn't fish at all for lake trout so I couldn't give you any idea on if they were biting or not. Best fishing was just before dark of course.
5755649,reidcb,2017-09-06 18:05:00,24,"I fished all around this area last week. Fishing was average. We caught several pike in the protected zone. We could not find the lake trout on Sturgeon Lake. We fished 60+ feet down with dodger and fly and gang trolls. Yes, old school. Walleye bite was good on the little lakes. Orange beads and gold blades off bottom bouncers. Everyone recommends getting rid of bouncers in favor of in-line weights. You might give it a shot. Moose Creek bait was a good place for bait. We wore rain suits twice. A flannel shirt and light jacket was all that we needed. No bugs this time of year. We crossed at International Falls and had no issues. You might want to stock up at the grocery store in Fort Frances rather than Ignace. We took the Turtle River Rd. Anyone else take this 100 mile gravel logging road? It does cut off serious miles. However, I wouldn't take a fancy truck/boat/trailer up the road."
5756393,sgeisz,2017-09-07 07:59:00,15,Thanks to both of you for the info. We leave next Friday up through Thunder Bay. Will report when we get back. Thanks again.

5782825,sgeisz,2017-09-25 11:19:00,15,"Were back Shane! Pretty good trip for the most part. Fished Graystone and two local lakes(10 mile and Penassi). Pretty hard to get to both with low water and limited access but the camp provided a quad for this. Fishing was off and on with our best day of 100 plus walleye with a couple 23"". Northern fishing on Penassi was outstanding on numbers but nothing over 27"". eyes were deep for the most part 25 FOW."
5789409,Shane Denotter,2017-09-28 19:20:00,39,Sounds like a good time was had by all then.
5607689,sgeisz,2017-06-13 14:50:00,15,Any information on this resort and the fishing opportunities would be helpful. My buddy won a free week there and we are looking at going the 16 - 23 of September this year. Thank you
5607937,Further North,2017-06-13 17:27:00,2008,"Haven't stayed at this camp but I have fished the area from another resort (Harris Bay Camp). Don't ignore Sturgeon Lake, particularly for pike. I've fished several other lakes in the area, had good luck at most of them.Looking at the map, the camp is more than an hour north of Ignace."
5610625,Shane Denotter,2017-06-14 18:04:00,39,I also won a trip there. Headin up last week of august.
5657074,sgeisz,2017-07-10 16:11:00,15,Shane let me know how you do? We are heading up in september
5657298,Shane Denotter,2017-07-10 18:40:00,39,"Ok, will do. I fish mainly for pike but gonna try the eyes too this time."
5742217,sgeisz,2017-08-28 14:19:00,15,Good luck this week Shane. Looking forward to hearing your results.
5746945,Shane Denotter,2017-08-30 19:50:00,39,Had a good but short weekend fishing at graystone camp. Ended up having to work late friday so we got a late start. Travel both ways was good we went 61 north out of Duluth to Thunder Bay then across to Ignace. Fishing was okay for us but my wife is a fair weather fisherman so we didnt stay in one spot on the lake very long to try and figure things out. Water levels are low in the area so be careful. Cabins were clean and hosts were very accomidating. Would like to go back again and stay a little longer and learn the area better I think there is good potential there. Caught walleyes anywhere from 5 ft to 25 ft with blaze orange jigheads and gold silver minnows caught a few walleye on. Good luck and have fun and give us a report when you get back.
5747889,sgeisz,2017-08-31 13:24:00,15,"Thank you shane. Any crossing issues? I have never crossed at Grand Portage, always at I-falls. Any northern or lake trout? We will keep you posted thanks again. steve"

5748193,Shane Denotter,2017-08-31 16:17:00,39,No issues either way in or out of Canada. I think we were like third in line both ways when we pulled up.
