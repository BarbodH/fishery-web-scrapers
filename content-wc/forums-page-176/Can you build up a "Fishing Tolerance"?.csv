5792961,Baseline,2017-10-02 07:38:00,3207,"I never like it when the catch is tough, but those hard days make the good days even better. As long as the line is tight I'm happy. I try to keep my territory fresh and fish new lakes and oceans every year. Alaska and Gulf of Mexico salt and skinny water fishing is great. I live in an area where decent and great fishing for many species is nearby. I carry rods and tackle in my truck and often stop at lakes and rivers just to try my luck. I have my old favorite lakes and trips, but every trip is still good for me."
5796001,Sportdog,2017-10-03 21:28:00,6735,"At my advanced age it's all about those I take fishing, whether it's Canada or a local pond. It's about making memories for them and myself. I still want to catch fish but the experience for them is what I strive to accomplish and that doesn't ever get old....... I hope!!!"
5796169,MrSimon,2017-10-04 06:34:00,922,"Agreed!!! I have an old boat that I really should sell, but I can't. It's the boat three of my kids caught their first fish out of, and it's the last boat that my grandfather ever fished out of. It's not about the fish, it's about the people. Well, it's not ALL about the fish."
5796985,Mojo-NC,2017-10-04 14:42:00,1929,"So true! I'm not a tournament guy for many reasons, but I decided to fish one this past spring and invited my son to be my partner. He had never fished any tournament before yet a fairly large one. I figured the cost to enter the tournament was about the same as a weekend round of golf for the two of us, so why not? I told him that our goal for the day was to have fun and if we caught a some fish that would be icing on the cake. We ended up catching a limit, and he was able to contribute with a really nice one. We had a blast! It wasn't until weigh-in that we realized we were just one kicker fish away from winning the darn thing and ended up finishing a respectable 7th. Now he is hooked and is going to join our group in Canada next year! I just ordered his rain suit."
5797985,gordy28,2017-10-05 07:18:00,437,"Lol - for sure. My tune is choice is Breathe but Escape, Shine on Your Crazy Diamond and Have a Cigar have been know to make an appearance"
5801489,yoopertrout,2017-10-08 10:47:00,1172,"I've had friends say that too many trips out west for big trout, have spoiled them for brookie fishing in Wisconsin and Michigan. I can understand that, but, luckily, I've been able to avoid it. Part of it is that I haven't taken very many trips of a life time, but I have taken a few. I was able to go to trophy tarpon lodge, I've had some great do-it-yourself trout fishing in the west, and I've had two great Ontario walleye and northern fly-ins. I think that two things that have helped me avoid getting a tolerance have been the joy of exploration, and the satisfaction of do-it-yourself. For years, I wanted to go to one of the famous trophy brookie lodges in Labrador, but the ever rising prices have always been out of my reach. At the same time, I had the goal of catching a 15"" or better brook trout around here (n. Wisc and the U.P.) I've achieved that goal several times, with the biggest being 16 3/4. It occurred to me that, money aside, that fish was harder to come by that a 5 pounder would be at a labrador lodge. Also, I catch browns nearly as big as a the labrador brookies, so I sort of reset my thinking to be ""I can catch trout of several pounds, but they will be browns, and I have caught a brookie that is more rare than a labrador 5 pounder, and this has helped my perspective. Also, the fun of exploration, especially of the do-it-yourself type never seems to leave me. This year I fished my 174th body of water in the U.P. It was a trout stream with no big fish, but it was beautiful. For me, being in beautiful places is part of it. Now, I think this is all easier for me to say because I live in a place where there is some great, if not world class fishing. If I lived somewhere in which the only options were stunted panfish and bass in muddy urban ponds, I might not be able to sustain the thrill. So far, though, the 90 pound tarpon haven't diminished the thrill of 8"" bluegills on the fly from a float tube."
5801585,fishmanric,2017-10-08 11:51:00,219,"After reading yoopertrout's post and thinking about how much fun it is for me to catch Golden Shiners. They shake off pretty easy, especially the bigger ones and the relief I get, when one goes in the minnow tank. The many times they shook off, landed on the dock and back into the water. The big bass that could have been. I'm still a kid when it comes to fishing."
5802809,Moosebunk,2017-10-08 23:03:00,211,"Do believe you can build up a tolerance for sure but the best remedies for this I find are, setting new goals and expectations and trying new things. Be it, taking a different trip than usual, chasing after new species or, chasing familiar species during different times, trying new techniques, aiming to better personal bests, etc. It's kinda like say... being a Scotch drinker but getting bored of it and looking to Moonshine instead. After awhile with the shiner, you'll veer off into Vodka and Meth for your kicks but, when you do eventually come back to Scotch again you'll be happy to be reunited and have plenty new stories to tell as well. Although, like sugar and nicotine, fishing too really hits on the same D2 receptors. Once hooked you're physically addicted, and the dopamine rush needs more and more for the same pleasure to be achieved. So if you look at it that way, your gonna build up a tolerance no matter what ya do, and you're gonna need to feed the addiction with more and more. Now, crack is likely cheaper than fishing if you want something to switch to, but trust that whetting a line is healthier in the long run. Stick with fishing."
5807441,MrSimon,2017-10-11 12:30:00,922,That was the weirdest response I've read on here in a while
5790729,BornToFish,2017-09-29 20:05:00,1224,"Greetings,I can remember many of the fish that I have caught in years past. Remembering them is often my ""happy place"" when falling asleep at night. That said, it seems that I am always dreaming of my next bite. No matter how many fish that I have caught over the years, it seems that I am always waiting for that next bite.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5790777,Boondock,2017-09-29 21:06:00,1056,I'm with ya as are several of my fishing buddies Plus the population explosion in Colorado with the lack of water. Things aren't getting any better Add two kids under 5 years old on top of work/house etc...
5790921,wallydave,2017-09-30 05:04:00,2151,Nostalgia is a good drug! Those memories of the early trips are hard to beat! I love each trip! Making new memories and stories is all part of the trip experience.
5790945,fishmanric,2017-09-30 06:25:00,219,"I'm just plain out addicted to the thump. Already working on next years trips. Just as excited to go now, as ever. This year we did a houseboat trip (what a ride up the lake that was) a total blast and everyone is coming back to do it again next year. Haven't found anyone yet, that doesn't like catching walleyes."
5791033,gordy28,2017-09-30 07:25:00,437,"I certainly haven't been on enough trips to be bored. However I do think I have learned that a huge part of the enjoyment is the experience rather than the action. For example I love hanging w the group at the fire. Or sitting down at the dock at midnight listening to some Pink Floyd and checking out the stars. It's become a trip ritual. I do know that we all tend to relax more though when the fishing is good or at least we have been having some success especially for the after dinner fish. Fishing ""my spot"" with a good cigar and a coffee and Baileys is as good as it gets but better when you've got a solid drift or troll figured out lolCheersGordy"
5791505,DaBirdman,2017-09-30 17:30:00,164,"Good topic. I look at it in a couple different lights. I remember the best days and the best trips very vividly. And I remember the tougher ones just as well. The fun part is trying to duplicate those great days, or great trips. Sometimes I get close, but more times than not, I don't. And that's what drives me and keeps everything ""fresh"" so to speak. I also take each outing as a singular day. High hopes of doing well. Ready to carry out the game plan. Often times trying new presentations, new techniques, new ideas. This also keeps it ""fresh"". I can find new ways to challenge myself, and to think and work outside the box because you just never know when the fish will surprise you. Lastly, having a daughter crazy about fishing and a son who likes to reel them in makes each day fun, new and most certainly challenging!"
5791865,Smoke_N_Finn,2017-10-01 06:46:00,437,"Started fishing Lake Superior and Michigan for Salmon / Trout in last 5 years. Every trip, I'm like a kid at Christmas. Got over 20 trips to Superior, alone this year. Santa has been good......Sent from my XT1254 using Tapatalk"
5792009,Pooch,2017-10-01 08:22:00,4618,"The ""new"" can wear off of everything. Fishing in Canada used to be a year around thought process for me. Now after over sixty trips the novelty has faded to some extent. I no longer think about it ""all the time"", but I do ""slip away"" about once a day I think back to something about any one of the trips with kind remembrances.With that said, the day we pack up and leave camp for home my mind wanders to the next trip.Pooch"
5792193,fishmanric,2017-10-01 09:36:00,219,"Canadian fishing trips for me are like a kid in the candy store. They energize me, are my big dog bone and the carrot in front of the cart. Now that I'm retiring, a whole summer up there could be in the books. My dream of fishing almost every day is within reach. I'm ready for it."
5792441,phishfearme,2017-10-01 12:36:00,1242,everything under the sun is in tune!!
5789801,MrSimon,2017-09-29 07:15:00,922,"With drugs or alcohol, the more you take, the more you need to get the same rush. Is it the same with fishing? These days it seems like me and my group need fly-in trophy level fishing to scratch the itch. It's almost like we aren't satisfied unless the trip is ""the trip of a lifetime"". Sometimes I think back and miss the excitement level and anticipation I had on the earliest trips. It feels like some of the wonderment has faded over the years. I still love it though!"
5789833,U D,2017-09-29 07:23:00,249,Some people will never be satisfied. Maybe it's the thrill of the unknown??
5789889,Mojo-NC,2017-09-29 08:05:00,1929,"Mix it up a little. Try deep sea fishing for tuna, dolphin, or sailfish/marlin. Or you could try some inshore ocean fishing an go after striper, tarpon, or red drum instead of doing the same thing every year."
5789993,bigwalleye1,2017-09-29 09:09:00,2632,"It's a mindset thing. I've been doing two trips a year to the same Canadian lodge, fishing the same, and some new spots, on the same lake for years, and every trip is the trip of a lifetime. My Dad was 78 this year and still able to go. We only get so many trips around the sun....EVERY trip is the trip of a lifetime. So is EVERY fish. My lodge owner told me this year about a guest who, after a day a day of some incredible fishing, proclaimed the day to have been the best of his lifetime. It was. He passed away in the cabin that night. Great to go out happy, doing what you love, but I've been more cautious of proclaiming ""the best of my life"" since, whether it is or isn't. Yup, I'm afraid of the jinx."
5790001,camp chef,2017-09-29 09:21:00,915,"I look forward to each trip with more anticipation than previous years,whether it is to a new location or one we have been to in the past. No two trips have ever been the same and each one has it's own wonders and surprises."
5790041,skindzier,2017-09-29 09:38:00,137,"I certainly have a hard time getting excited about going fishing back home in Colorado after my Canada trips. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy fishing here, but it isn't anywhere near the adrenaline rush as I get when my trip approaches. There's several reservoirs here that have walleyes - I can't even fish for them here. I just can't spend all day catching 4 walleyes, when I can do that up there in less than an hour."
5790081,Mike Borger,2017-09-29 09:50:00,1554,"Amazingly enough I haven't reached that point, and I'm guessing never will.You sound as though you're jaded."
5790313,MrSimon,2017-09-29 12:34:00,922,"Haha, no not jaded .... just older I think. Don't get me wrong, I still LOVE my trips and wouldn't ever give them up for any other type of fishing. I think maybe it's that the memories from the earliest trips are the strongest .... reminiscing about times gone past I suppose."
5790489,Mike Borger,2017-09-29 14:56:00,1554,"My uncle was my angling mentor, I miss him every single day.These days I still get fired up for any fishing trip, but the real fun comes from feeding off the excitement of my son who's experiencing a lot of this for the first time."
5790625,Shortline,2017-09-29 17:54:00,234,"Mike hit on a note that affects me as well, my boy. I find I am now getting pumped for silly little trips.....spring sucker fishing from the bank, crappies in June, bass fishing local lakes after work, etc..... But at the same time, I still find the pure enjoyment of heading out solo for a couple hours locally just to fish.....for anything.....like when I was a kid. Maybe that's a good definition of succeeding in life? I get excited to just go fishing. I have fun catching a stupid sucker in may....after work but before dinner. And watching a tipup go off still gets me to jump....."
