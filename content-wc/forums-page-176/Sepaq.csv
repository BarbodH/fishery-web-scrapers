5788905,eight4,2017-09-28 13:25:00,11,Thanks for some reason I thought that was the Sepaq number and that they were not doing booking for 2018.
5788929,Andre (wallyandre),2017-09-28 14:01:00,2274,"They are booking for 2018: Please note that Réserve faunique des Lacs-Albanel-Mistassini-et-Waconichi is no longer operated by Sépaq. This wildlife reserve is now operated by Niniischii Corporation, a corporation incorporated by the Cree Nation of Mistissini. To make a reservation, please call 1‑844‑522‑2777. Réserve faunique des Lacs-Albanel-Mistassini-et-Waconichi has choice sites for trophy-seeking anglers and lovers of the great outdoors. On this sprawling territory is Québec's largest natural freshwater lake, Lac Mistassini, 176 km long. Breathe in the fresh lake air and enjoy a memorable stay in a wildlife reserve that the word space' cannot begin to describe."
5586073,psherbo,2017-06-02 12:25:00,13,"Does anyone know anything about the change in management of some of the Reserves in Quebec from the provincial government to the Cree Indian nation. Specifically Reserve Faunique Assinica (Comencho, Opitaca and Cashisca) and the Reserve Misstassini-Albanel and Waconichi. The Sepaq website says: ""Please note that the Assinica Wildlife Reserve is no longer operated by Sépaq. For reservations, please call 1 844 522-2777."" The phone number does not connect. I also I see that it says the management is now by Corporation Nibiischii of the Cree Nation. Any input or contact info appreciated. Thanks"
5591225,Kartman35,2017-06-05 12:35:00,245,"The number connects but if you press 9 to speak english it drops you. Try not pressing 9 and working through it in french. Option 1 is for chalets, and option 2 is for all other inquiries (camping fishing etc.). Hopefully the person who answers will speak a little english..."
5591321,Andre (wallyandre),2017-06-05 13:04:00,2274,"I just spoke with somebody at the SEPAQ and they were not aware of the problem; they will look at it. As for this year they will be no change for those reserves but starting next year it's going to be the Cree that will take care of the reservations, camp, campng etc... SEPAQ will have nothing to do in regard of those reserve."
5591377,Guest,2017-06-05 13:21:00,0,"I'm leaving for chibigamau tomorrow ill let you know if I find anything out.also I wanted to fish those lakes you mentioned,any info would be appreciated.i did fish albanel and some others.thanks"
5591745,Andre (wallyandre),2017-06-05 15:03:00,2274,If you want to speak directly to somebody from the Cree organisation the # is: 418-748-7331
5592129,Kartman35,2017-06-05 17:18:00,245,"There's already a change as last year I was able to see the camping availabilities and reserve online at sepaq.com for my stay at Baie Penicouane. As soon as you select Albanel, Mistassini, Waikonichi it immediately tells you to call the Cree services phone number the OP listed. Also these camping sites no longer appear on the interactive map on the SEPAQ website. It seems they are no longer managing these campsites."
5592185,Andre (wallyandre),2017-06-05 17:53:00,2274,I got the confirmation this afternoon about the fact that the SEPAQ are no longer responsible for those reserves.
5599345,psherbo,2017-06-09 12:38:00,13,Thank you for your responses. I was told that the new Cree administration will honor existing reservations for this year. Brochett: I have fished Albanel and Comencho and would be happy to talk. I came across this article which sheds some light. Alarmingly there is mention of commercial fishing on Lake Mistassini. http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/...i-et-waconichi
5786897,eight4,2017-09-27 12:06:00,11,Does anybody know what is going to happen in 2018? I have been trying to get some imformation on Albanel and have not had much luck.
5787993,Kartman35,2017-09-28 00:08:00,245,http://www.reservefauniqueamw.com/en/information.html have you called 1-844-522-2777? That's the number...
