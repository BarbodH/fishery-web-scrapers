5742673,ace,2017-08-28 18:12:00,10,Thanks everyone for the updates. I'll give the car a wax tomorrow to help with any tar and the boats freshly waxed already and black so should be good to go. Looks like it's gonna be mighty chilly after next weekend up in Ear Falls. should be fun.
5742817,btyreprich,2017-08-28 19:13:00,1067,Chilly nights & mornings just make for an even better shore lunch! Have a great trip. So looking forward to my retirement when I can make 2 trips a year.
5753177,fishingMN4eyes,2017-09-05 07:35:00,108,"Drove up Tuesday of last week and Came home Saturday. Seemed like horrible conditions driving up and seemed like they made some decent progress by Saturday. The delays were tough on Tuesday as we were driving up during the middle of the work day. Driving home Saturday early we missed the stop signs because they were just starting get get set up for the day. For those going to NW Lac Seul, 105 is pretty torn up as well.Overall we mostly just took on dust and dirt, no tar. We were able to wipe the boat down with lake water and a towel as we were putting it in the water."
5753585,Habitual Eyer,2017-09-05 12:03:00,144,"Took both routes to Hudson in mid August. 71 is even more out of the way if going East from Dryden. No real construction on 71. 502 is one of my favorite routes....but until gravel is gone, clean up from 502 when you get home will take you far longer than the extra miles 71 takes you out of the way. Clay slop sticks like concrete."
5757825,turkeyriver,2017-09-07 19:19:00,80,"Came down 502 yesterday. They have made great progress since we went up on the 30th. Not much gravel/slop anymore, just a couple short delays."
5771305,kevinvjacobs,2017-09-18 07:02:00,48,"Went up on the 9th and back on the 15th. One short delay, maybe 5-10 minutes. Maybe a couple miles gravel that was not terrible."
5779729,David Anderson,2017-09-23 19:43:00,2073,"Just got back from Lac Seul today, only construction was the bridge near Dryden. Everything else is paved and smooth as silk! No gravel or stops."
5785145,J Arendt,2017-09-26 12:52:00,45,"Returned September 22 from Red Lake and used the 502. Work was being done on the shoulders of the road in two spots, all paving complete. Will be my route until it goes to **** again."
5788377,HeHooksHimself,2017-09-28 08:31:00,725,"The road is almost back to normal. Just a couple sections where they are completing paving, but no messy tar or anything. Feel free to use it. Same thing on the 105. Hooks"
5788977,law57,2017-09-28 14:32:00,1147,Agreed - road is good. I just got home and came down 502 between 10 and noon today. Very good work by their highway department. I drove about 60 - no traffic to 'join' with so I didn't go any faster. I'm only 7 hours from where I go fishing in Canada - so there's really no hurry.
5728193,Cardsfan10,2017-08-20 12:52:00,1,"Fished from the ear falls area. Took 502 up on a Friday, many delays and nasty watered areas. 45 minutes sitting still in construction areas. Took 71 on way back. Some construction but not as bad but was very early on Friday morning. Flaggers not in place yet. Will probably use 71 for future trips. Both routes under construction, it's a crap shoot right now. Trip dates were 8/11/17 to 8/18/17"
5728361,Bstar,2017-08-20 16:01:00,564,Drove back on 502 on Saturday and they were still working on the repaving project. The south end of the work was wrapping up but it is a moving project and they have about 2-3 kilometers tore up now and as others have said they keep it wet to keep the dust down and there is some large gravel that gets kicked up. We were held up for about 20 minutes. Your vehicle will get dirty and if you are towing a boat you might want to protect it. I would also keep a good distance between you and the vehicle in front of you due to rocks being kicked up from the tires. You definitely need to slow down when you see an ORANGE bump sign. All in all not too bad. The finished product is very nice.
5729921,NARDA 1,2017-08-21 10:59:00,636,Here is some more info on the 502.http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/tra...tract2016-6002
5738657,ace,2017-08-26 07:39:00,10,Thanks for the link Narda. Anyone run 502 this weekend? I'm heading up next Friday and would appreciate the report. We have a room in Dryden for the night and I really don't feel like going the long way and backtracking unless it's really bad. TIA
5739457,Pooch,2017-08-26 17:03:00,4618,"I just spent three hours getting the tar off of my truck from 502. My truck is white so it shows up. If your trucks are darker so you may not be aware of it. I washed the truck with Dawn soap to get the dirt off then dried it. Then used WD40 to remove stains and fine tar. Then washed it twice more with clean water and Dawn each time to get the WD40 off. PITA, but the fishing was good.Pooch"
5740257,BornToFish,2017-08-27 09:35:00,1224,"Greetings,Pooch: how far along has the work progressed on Hwy. 502? Also, did you travel on Hwy. 105? If so, how was the work progressing on Hwy. 105?I feel your pain trying to get the tar off the sides of your truck. We encountered the same problem during our trip in early July. The friend that I traveled with had a white pickup truck. Because of this, I applied a coat of wax to my truck before our trip in August. It helped overcome the problem of removing the tar, but it was still a pain to wax the truck. Pay me now or pay me later!My truck cleaned up nicely where there was wax. Did you come up with any ideas in terms of removing asphalt from the wheel wells and undercarriage?Kindest regards...."
5740801,Stringbean,2017-08-27 17:11:00,279,"Next time it happens that you drive through the mud, try washing down the vehicle with Simple Green straight out of the spray bottle. The detergent seems to dissolve the oil that holds the dirt to the vehicle. It worked for me when I ran through the mud on Hwy 17"
5741089,BrianinVA,2017-08-27 20:21:00,160,"Traveled 502 and 105 on Friday and didn't find any huge pot holes but there were longer stretches of gravel where work was being done, especially on 502. We actually encountered more delay on 105 as there were 5 separate stoppage for one-way traffic (versus 2 or 3 on 502) but only one lasted longer than 5 mins. There was fresh asphalt but I was driving a rental car so I didn't really notice if it stuck to the car."
5741297,Pooch,2017-08-28 06:46:00,4618,"I have a large hot water pressure washer that we use on the farm. It's a peach of a machine for removing oil, but it will also strip paint if you are not careful. I turned it down to 120 degrees and it seemed to clean up the wheel wells ""good enough"". Not overly concerned about wheel wells.A big hot water pressure washer is an excellent piece of equipment if used with sound judgement. I used it two years ago to strip the paint off of my grandparents steel porch rockers that I restored. They are +- seventy years old. Worked great.The tar thing also happened several years ago on that same stretch of highway. No one's fault, but have never ran across that here in the states. Must be something to do with their asphalt mix or part of the dust control water mix they spray.My new boat tarp is permanently blemished, but it's a tarp and still does it's job so not that big of a deal.I've not tried Simple green for tar. WD40 works well and does not appear to hurt the finish, but then it takes two washings with soap to remove it. Key is to wash all of the dirt and grit off the vehicle before going after the tar or you will scratch the begeebers out of your finish. Vehicle must be dry after the first wash before using WD40. I learned this from taking tar off tractors years ago.Pooch"
5741521,Bstar,2017-08-28 08:54:00,564,"We drove 502 on the 12th and the 19th but we stopped in Dryden and washed the vehicles at one of those do it yourself spray washes and then we washed them again in Rice Lake, WI on the way home. I hand washed my van when we got home and I didn't see any tar on it. Just the reddish dirt/clay that they use on 502. Mostly in the wheel wells. Maybe it's because I clay barred and waxed it before we left?"
5715634,Pat,2017-08-12 20:26:00,203,"Bstar is right on, we drove it today too, I clocked it and it was 3 miles of gravel. Not bad as far as roughness but a muddy mess as they were watering it. 105 was worse, had 4 flagman areas and they are tearing up more area to repave. Some real nasty bumps on 105 too."
5716010,x4flatfish,2017-08-13 08:52:00,319,Also came home via 502 on Saturday 8/12. Better now than last Sat. and am sure it will be done in the next week. Just pay attention to signs. We came from Hudson/Sioux Lookout so for those recommending other routes it might be useful to say where you are going to/coming from. 502 is still the best option from the Midwest to the Sioux Lookout area unless you like the scenic route along Lake Superior.
5724658,wallydave,2017-08-18 07:11:00,2151,"Any updates on the 105? I have always liked the drive for the scenery, but with the road conditions, and trying a new lake, it looks the time to try a new road too! Three weeks from today we head North!"
5725082,Blue Lk,2017-08-18 10:36:00,269,"http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/tra...tract2016-6006 If you are headed to Cedar Lk,105 is the only way to go."
5725138,wallydave,2017-08-18 11:11:00,2151,"You are right! I was confusing the 502 and the 105, its been a while since I was going your way! I must be suffering from a lack of fresh walleye!"
5727153,pjshorthorn,2017-08-19 19:16:00,5654,"If I were in your shoes, this is what I would do. Buy a big bean bag, two cases of Kokanee and some bird food. Bring those with you as part of your trip to Cedar Lake. Call Gord and let him know you need to park your vehicle at his place so you don't have to worry about any road rash on the wife's vehicle going up 105. Leave the two cases of Kokanee with Gord as payment for a ride up to Cedar Lake and then back to his place at the end of your trip. Put the bird food and the bean bag in the back of his truck along with the rest of your gear. Your wife can ride in the cab of the truck and you can sit in the bed of the truck on the bean bag. Make sure to wear your rain gear and feed the birds along the way so they don't peck your eyes out or harm other sensitive areas. You are welcome for the suggestions and trip solutions to the dilemma you would have been facing. PjShorthorn"
5727337,wallydave,2017-08-19 21:44:00,2151,"Yea I be sure to look into your plan! I estimate at least 12 seconds! Now if you had posted your trip report by now, I even give your plan a second look!"
5727353,Pat,2017-08-19 22:16:00,203,"Came down 105 and 502 today returning from Cedar Lake. 105 had 6 miles of gravel, not rough, but slow as you passed construction workers. 502 still had 3 miles of gravel, looks like they are tearing up ~3 mile sections up at a time and repaving. Looks like that might go all season. They are watering the gravel stretch and it is a constant puddle, your vehicle will get very muddy. There was a couple of flagman stops on 502, not real long delays. The longest delay we had was in Virginia on 53. The new construction there caused backup through town, stop and go for probably 45 minutes. Your boat will likely look something like this attached photo after traveling 502."
5727521,pjshorthorn,2017-08-20 05:44:00,5654,"Well, since you had a tough time figuring out what road to take to Cedar Lake I figured you needed a travel plan. Just a bit of help to make sure you keep the wife happy on the trip. You have obviously missed my trip report to date........it continues being posted one picture at a time PjShorthorn"
5728145,v-bay gord,2017-08-20 11:50:00,3168,Not sure what the actual road conditions are but I do know that all vehicles and boats that arrived in camp yesterday (that drove 502) arrived with a nice coating of mud. Apparently they are keeping the gravel portions nicely wetted down to prevent dust.
5701170,bus33,2017-08-04 07:06:00,289,"Well just got back from Lac Seul last night. We took 502 up last Friday and needless to say we took 17 on the return trip. On the way up I noticed these truck pulling boats south through Virginia that were covered in mud and wondered if they were fishing in more remote gravel areas but I soon found out it was from 502. As was said above, the first 50ish miles were normal then the construction hit. It was one lane, which wasn't bad. The issue was it was dirt stretches and the crews were watering the crap out of the dust which made it mud. The bumps were tolerable if you payed attention and slowed way down. The issue there was the people that were in a hurry and riding my a$$. This was the first time I had taken 17 and that was a nice stretch of road. Bottom line is if I wasn't pulling a boat, 502 would have been ok. It's not horrible, but 17 was much better. As for the fishing, the weather was very unstable so the first few days the fish were harder to find. We did ok....the ticket ended up being pulling spinners in 17 fow. We hammered them the last two days. Good luck!"
5703594,Remi,2017-08-05 21:05:00,41,"We came back home today, I didn't think Hwy 502 was that bad, when you see rough road signs or construction, slow down. We traveled it from 5:30 AM from Dryden to Fort Francis area. Less traffic early in the morning probably helps as well. There was 1 stretch of gravel, the road is ripped up, probably will be laying new road in a few weeks."
5703890,Habitual Eyer,2017-08-06 07:46:00,144,"I'm picking up a new boat on drive up. Heading to Hudson. If going West from Dryden to Vermillion bay I would no doubt take 17...but going East from Dryden 17 becomes further out of the way. Any idea how many miles of gravel ? have Rock-Tamers on truck, but if too many miles of gravel then we may just take the 17 route and accept the hour extra travel."
5703994,fishmanric,2017-08-06 09:01:00,219,Drove 502 on the way back yesterday morning. The work is getting done and the worst bumps have been repaired along with stretches being repaved. There are some where you still need to slow down but aren't trailer busters anymore. By the end of the year it should be back in good shape.
5704018,Habitual Eyer,2017-08-06 09:07:00,144,"Any idea how much gravel? mile, five miles, ??"
5704042,fishmanric,2017-08-06 09:18:00,219,"There was one stretch of compacted gravel that will likely be paved this week. It was in perfect shape and driving on it was smooth. There are still numerous marked areas for repair, so driving will be impacted. On the way up we had to stop twice and the waits were about 20 minutes each time. I would expect this to continue as they replace other sections of the road. They are making good progress."
5704274,ToxicAngler,2017-08-06 10:29:00,30,71 is the way to go. Have taken 502 home 1 time and is not as nice of a drive.
5704370,fishmanric,2017-08-06 11:10:00,219,I would be backtracking to the tune of an hour and a half to almost two hours going that route. I'm better off going the hwy 61 route to 11 to 17 but that also adds about the same amount of time. 12 hours is enough.
5715418,Bstar,2017-08-12 14:47:00,564,Drove up 502 today and there is only about 3-4 miles left to pave and I'm sure they will have that done by next Saturday when we head back. You definitely want to slow down for the orange bump signs.
5715474,SinOrSwim,2017-08-12 15:19:00,1528,"I got back Thursday. Took 71 up and 502 back. 502 is still a little quicker. Only one area with construction but, yes it's a few miles. They need to different ""levels"" to their bump signs. LOL one you go over and it's fine and the next you about lose a wheel. I actually had more delays north of Vbay than anywhere else. If you are pulling a boat, 71 is probably the way to go. Or if you want to stop places. If you want the quickest way 502. It's not horrible. and only the area that is actually under construction is delayed"
5684458,Slim03,2017-07-25 22:02:00,159,Just traveled it today and all I can say is a major improvement from months prior. They fixed a lot of the bad spots although still have to be careful. Also a long stretch of road that was rough is currently torn up for resurfacing. All together was still a slow process but better than 3 weeks ago. There is a lot of spray paint on the road with section numbers so I think they are going to make the entire stretch a lot better
5686634,mwh624,2017-07-27 07:19:00,183,"As of yesterday, the road wasn't in too bad of shape but there were a few sections where the tar has been removed and it's just gravel. Be prepared to slow down."
5686826,bus33,2017-07-27 08:38:00,289,Thanks for all the info. We are taking off early tomorrow.
5686970,wallydave,2017-07-27 09:40:00,2151,"Have a safe trip, post your fishing and travel report on your return! I will be heading North in Sept! Taking my wifes SUV, I want to steer clear of any bad roads!"
5687010,x4flatfish,2017-07-27 09:52:00,319,Please keep the updates coming. Our group will be heading that way a week from tomorrow. Thanks
5687882,DaBirdman,2017-07-27 17:15:00,164,"I'm not real knowledgeable about the highways in that area, but does it make any sense to take 11 over to Atikoken, then north on 622 instead of taking 502?"
5693066,Guest,2017-07-31 05:53:00,0,"We just came home via 71 on Friday, and that now has quite a bit of construction as well. There were at least 5 areas down to single lane with flaggers. However, after taking 71 on the way up, I will now be going that way on future trips. It was an easier drive than 502."
5693170,troutwater,2017-07-31 07:22:00,299,"Came home on the 29th on 502. It was much better than a week before that with some of it being repaved, but a good section of say 20-25 miles or so still has large pot holes and rough patches from them tearing it up. The first and last 3rd of the road is ok, just that middle part that's a pain."
5693850,Guest,2017-07-31 10:36:00,0,"Also came home on the 29th. The first 42 miles heading north are pretty much standard 502, but there are a few 20-yard stretches where it's grave. Then next 12 miles are very third-world country. Gravel/mud. There was a water truck spraying that stretch, ostensibly to keep the dust down. It may have kept the dust down, but it sure made for a muddy, semi-rutted stretch. My advice in general: when you see the yellow signs warning of a bump, you can get a pretty good read on the bump and shouldn't have issues. When you see the orange signs warning of a bump, take those seriously. Usually a pretty good thump, along with an extended stretch of gravel. Overall, the construction on 502 cost me a total of 13 minutes extra time on the way back on the 29th, and 9 minutes on the way up on the 22nd. This includes flaggers. -42"
5695098,Slim03,2017-07-31 21:47:00,159,Returned last night from Lac Seul and traveled 502. I can say that the road is a MAJOR improvement from 3 weeks earlier and they are currently repaving the road. There is still construction but a lot of the really bad area has been repaved. There was also a decent travel maybe 5-10 miles of hard pack gravel but it was in good shape for the most part. Watch for the orange bump signs and be cautious and you will be fine.
5679802,bus33,2017-07-23 07:20:00,289,We are leaving Friday for Ear Falls (Pulling Boat). Are there any updates on 502 being any better or worse as far as construction and torn up roads? Contemplating taking 71 up if 502 is bad. Thanks for any updates you might have.
5679826,Slim03,2017-07-23 07:31:00,159,We will be headed up on Tuesday to Hudson and will report back. Hope it was better than it was a month ago when I was on it.
5679914,Plotman,2017-07-23 09:13:00,394,"I just drove it home last night. Its not that bad if you just slow down for the ""bump"" areas which are marked with orange/black signs. The problem is the people that want to ride your A$% that dont realize the danger and nearly rear end you which is why I used the ""pulp check areas"" on the way back to let them go around. It actually makes it easier if you follow as you can see how bad or not the bump is by watching their vehicle go over the bumps. We actually got behind one Ranger boat that still had part of the motor mount bolted to the transom and rest of the motor gone and can only speculate he got rear ended or hit something REALLY hard as you can see that the mount casting was clearly broken off. Figured out real quick why some guys were attaching those orange safety vests to their props to keep folks back. I would suggest sucking up any construction delays by going via driving as we got the bright idea to take 594 to avoid on the way back and that was a mistake as they must have just replaced all the culverts under the road and put gravel over to which some were pretty bad. Allow some extra time and you should be fine."
5680034,bus33,2017-07-23 10:22:00,289,Thanks for the update. We always take 594 to cut out some time too..dang.
5680346,mswope13,2017-07-23 14:12:00,73,"Traveled 502 going up last week, took Ojibway Drive to 17 and was smooth sailing. We took 71 coming back, timed both ways and found 71 was 2 minutes faster. Take it for what it's worth, but neither was too bad. As said prior, slow down on the bump signs clearly marked (orange/black) and exercise patience on the area's that are one way stops. We did not pull a boat, but another of our group members did. Good Luck."
5680378,The tank,2017-07-23 14:27:00,340,After taking 71 I would never go 502 unless im going east out of Dryden. 71 is so much better and safer than 502. But That's Just Me. Not as hard on my truck; boat or nerves. Have a safe trip.
5680426,btyreprich,2017-07-23 15:33:00,1067,No more 502 for us. We prefer Highway 71. Much safer and places to stop if necessary
5680842,Guest,2017-07-23 21:42:00,0,"Just went up the 502 a couple hours ago and it wasn't bad. A couple of The ""bump"" parts were rough but as long as you take notice you should be fine. I guess it's also a Sunday so there weren't any construction workers"
5681010,Guest,2017-07-24 06:09:00,0,"We just got home Saturday from Sioux Lookout. The middle of the 502 stretch has some tough bumps. If you see one of the bump signs, slow down especially is you are pulling a boat."
5681378,Rich B,2017-07-24 09:54:00,1081,"Just returned a week ago....the 502 was very rough in some of the construction areas. We drove back on HWY 71. For the small amount of extra time, a far better road and drive. Better (as stated earlier) for my rig, the truck and all our nerves. I wouldn't drive the 502 anytime soon. FWIW. Rich B"
