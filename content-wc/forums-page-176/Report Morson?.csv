5783273,Obabikon,2017-09-25 14:02:00,2370,"Aaron,Were you able to find any of the trees I marked up?"
5783665,FishinFreaks,2017-09-25 17:39:00,386,"We came back and found the ones just SW of the resort, but we didn't make the trek back up by the Elbow, as we didn't catch any in those couple trees, and you had said that they were probably out by now. But I can guarantee I'll be checking them next year! Are they in the trees all summer? Or is that just a September thing?I really enjoyed meeting you and hope I get to run into you again down the road. I hope your last week goes great up there. Enjoy the season home with your family."
5784169,Obabikon,2017-09-26 04:41:00,2370,They are a late August/early September thing. They are typically in trees on the bank in June after the spawn.
5795257,fishingMN4eyes,2017-10-03 13:08:00,108,"Got home yesterday afternoon. Tough weekend for us. Made it up late morning Saturday. Got unpacked into the cabin, ate a sandwich, and headed out for the afternoon. Saturday was windy but not unmanageable. We were able to make a decent run and we caught fish just about everywhere we went. We were able to eat walleye for dinner and put three in the freezer as well. Sunday was crazy windy and rainy on and off all day. It didn't look that bad when we woke up but by the time we got out on the bigger water we realized how rough it really was. We still caught fish but we had to work pretty hard to get them. We tried to fish in the wind a bit but it wears on us after while. We were able to catch some fish on the protected sides of islands it was just nice to be out of the wind even momentarily. Still made our daily limits but it was a lot of work.We were going to try to go fish yesterday in the morning for a couple hours before heading home but it was raining pretty steadily again so we just pulled the boat and decided to head home. Especially after being pretty well soaked all day Sunday we just called it a trip.We caught decent numbers Saturday and I thought we did ok Sunday given the conditions. We just didn't see very much size at all. Biggest fish was 19""(caught on a jigging rap). We saw tons of 8""-12"" fish. Caught one lonely crappie(13"") and one lonely perch(I had one get off at the side of the boat that looked like a keeper as well). Best depth was probably 18-24', but we caught fish in a variety of depths. Minnows and crawlers seemed to fish pretty even to me."
5795449,LyleK,2017-10-03 14:16:00,248,"Were the fish still deep on the reefs or were they beginning to move into the current areas? We had similar results on Saturday. Lots of 15 - 17"" fish, nothing big. wondering where the larger fish are at."
5796145,Obabikon,2017-10-04 05:58:00,2370,The fish have been in the current areas for 3 weeks. Bigger ones were on rock points in 20'... but it was slow.
5797993,fishingMN4eyes,2017-10-05 07:22:00,108,We fished shoreline structure primarily.
5770577,LyleK,2017-09-17 14:18:00,248,Anyone know the general area where the trees are? I know specifics are hard but general area would be much appreciated. Thanks
5770721,Obabikon,2017-09-17 18:27:00,2370,"There are at least 6 within 300 yards of the elbow's deep point. Is that too general? I can't/won't give GPS coordinates, but with some side imaging... you can probably find most of them."
5770777,LyleK,2017-09-17 19:34:00,248,That is perfect. I was hoping you were going to say there were trees dropped in Miles Bay. This is helpful enough. Thank you for the reply. Lyle
5771505,Obabikon,2017-09-18 08:20:00,2370,"There are trees dropped in Miles Bay, but I only know of a handful.That isn't typically where we catch the crappies in early September though..."
5771513,LyleK,2017-09-18 08:23:00,248,great ! thank you Lyle
5773105,muskyman73,2017-09-18 20:23:00,401,"Oh do tell where I may come across these trees. Heck, I can even pull a crankbait out of my hand to find them"
5774305,Obabikon,2017-09-19 14:57:00,2370,"They aren't typically good in July, but I'll mark them up for you."
5776737,Guest,2017-09-21 08:03:00,0,"Was up in the Sabaskong area the past two weeks fishing walleye, bass, and crappie. Fishing was pretty steady, considering the massive cold front that came through late in our trip. Biggest walleye was 25"". On two separate occasions, we had the shady roost boat from Nestor falls come and stop a few feet from our boat. Absolutely unbelievable."
5782585,fishingMN4eyes,2017-09-25 09:40:00,108,Leaving Saturday morning for a quick weekend. Any more reports?
5782601,FishinFreaks,2017-09-25 09:43:00,386,"Got home from Morson last night. Was up Wednesday to Sunday (9/20-9/24). Caught them decent, but they're not quite on the chew yet. Managed 65-80 per day for 2 of us, but those were long days, and we had to work pretty hard. Water temps were 61 when we got there, and they were 63 when we left. I would expect to see the water temps dropping this week, as the weather is cooling off quite a bit. From there, I think the bite will be on. Fish were moving into typical fall spots, but we were only able to find a couple active schools. I think you'll do well this week. Crappies were hit and miss...mostly miss. Our buddy found a school one day and gone the next. We never found a school but were able to knock out a one man limit of 13 inchers."
5766481,1700SS,2017-09-14 08:21:00,104,"Jared/Obabikon or anybody,Coming up tomorrow for a week. Do we have any recent reports? Eyes in neck down/ current? Water temp? Crappies starting to school up? Thanks for all responses.Brett"
5766801,Obabikon,2017-09-14 11:21:00,2370,"Standard fall patterns are starting to show across the board. It has been warm, but we're about to have a big cold front. That will change the bite. It has been good/great for the past 10 days. Crappie on trees and walleyes in mud flats at 20'. Water temps were 67 in the bay yesterday, but by Saturday... I would expect low 60's."
5767337,FishinFreaks,2017-09-14 18:12:00,386,I've seen people talk about trees for crappies in the past. I've never seen trees though. Where do you find trees around there? Headed up on Wednesday!
5767385,Obabikon,2017-09-14 18:50:00,2370,Hire a local guide that knows crappie fishing.
5767401,FishinFreaks,2017-09-14 18:51:00,386,I'd definitely consider that. Do you guide up there? Or have any recommendations?
5767833,Bill Krejca,2017-09-15 06:16:00,6107,"The trees specified are those which have been sunk by various locals. Without hiring a guide, maybe best way to find is by trolling a very expensive crank bait through mud flat areas which do not look like a likely hangout for crappies. Bill"
5768545,Obabikon,2017-09-15 18:59:00,2370,"Where do you stay? I really guide very little anymore. The resort is too busy for me to be gone. However, any resort over here will have access to guides that know some of the trees."
5768593,FishinFreaks,2017-09-15 19:41:00,386,We stay at my buddy's place off the west end of Blueberry. I only know Justin at Mylie's. Hasn't had any guides available when I've asked in the past.
5768617,Obabikon,2017-09-15 20:10:00,2370,"Gotcha. I don't have any guides available right now, but if you swing by the camp this week, I'll mark some of them on a map for you. If you have side imaging, it'll be pretty easy to find them."
5768681,FishinFreaks,2017-09-15 20:36:00,386,That's awesome. I'll send you a PM.
