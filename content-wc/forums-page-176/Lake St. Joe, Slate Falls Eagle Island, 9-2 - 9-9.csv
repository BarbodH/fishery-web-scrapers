Well, that's because I've been lazy and haven't posted anything yet. That and the Twins have been fun to watch, the Vikings are at least entertaining, and keeping up with who's kneeling or not takes time, not to mention all the time on W/C watching people respond to it. So, if they don't mind, I'm going to basically copy my email responses and repost it here. The flight was fun, weather was cold and windy some days, dead calm on others, the cabin was excellent, boats were excellent, fishing was OK. When we flew in on Saturday the weather was damp with a very low ceiling. I don't think we were ever more than 300-500' in the air. Several times the pilot had to make 360 circles looking for ways around hills or through openings in the overcast. We were too dumb and excited to be afraid, so it was fun. The flight up took an hour but the return flight in clear skies and higher altitude took 45 minutes. I asked in an earlier post about the likelihood of 6 guys weighing less than 2,400 pounds. We came in at 2,300. Some guys worked hard to keep weight down and others not so much, but we only had two cases of water and maybe three 12 packs of pop. I can see where it would be a lot harder to stay under 2,400 if there were any beer drinkers in the group. The weather was cold with fires in the wood stove most evenings. 40s and low 50s I'm guessing. We fished behind islands and where the wind let us for the first 3 days. The cabin and facilities were very good. Solar electricity ran the refrigerator, freezer and lights but there were no outlets anywhere. There was an inverter next to the freezer to charge radios, phones, cameras, etc. No wifi or phone service. Very well equipped and comfortable, however. We stayed in the west cabin. Nobody was in the east or central cabins so we had the lake to ourselves and never saw another boat. No moose, bear or caribou sightings on this trip, but a couple otters hung around the dock area and were entertaining. We had one gull that flew in and hovered about 10' from the end of Pat's rod tip for quite a while. It was fun for me to watch from the front of the boat but kind of Alfred Hitchcock ""Birds""like for Pat. Boats were very good, 20hp with electric start. On the first day the boat I had would die if throttled down too far, which was very frustrating. Thank goodness for electric start. Jeremy, the caretaker on the island, adjusted the idle the next day and it ran great after that. We made alligator clip connections to run fish finders off the boat battery so we didn't have to mess with recharging fish finder batteries. Fishing was OK, not great. Nowhere near June numbers (but this June was phenomenal). We had one sandbar we could drift over and consistently get fish that became our go-to spot for dinner and take home fish. Every other place we tried was one or two fish but nothing fast. My boat's best day was 40 fish. Being a new part of the lake for us we spent a lot of time exploring. I'm sure our numbers could have been better if we stuck to the sand bar. Biggest were 24.75 walleye and 35 northern. Much as I was tempted by Mike Borger's large northern videos we really didn't target northerns. We got a few small walleyes but overall most were good sized. None of the September trips have come close to June in numbers, so from now on I'm going to try to forget about numbers and search deeper water for bigger fish. Of course, I say that every year. Mike would say I'm part of the group that is easily sidetracked by walleye. After the first walleye or two I forget about northerns or big fish and can't wait to set the hook again. We tried to look mainly in the 20-25' range but got fish anywhere from 35' to 10'. We brought in 1/2 flat of crawlers and went through them, but that was really only one guy that used a whole crawler every time. I fished with him a couple of days and again am not convinced live bait makes any difference on St. Joe. The Eagle Island area seemed to be a lot more solid rock islands with rock faces dropping into deeper water than the Winoga cabin area in the middle part of St. Joe. There was a lot more 20' deep 20' off shore and less sand and rubble. It might just be because of what I'm used to, but I prefer the lake conditions in the Winoga area of St. Joe. Overall this part of the lake was a lot deeper, with 95' the deepest but 50-60' was common. All in all it was a very good trip. Weather could have been better and fishing wasn't June-like but still pretty good. The fly-in was fun. Slate Falls does an excellent job and I'd like to try them again in the future. Maybe Miniss or Root Bay or ...."

They must be new because it was 15hp pull starts when we were there. Minor idle issues aside that's music to my ears, it's a lot of water to cover with a slower boat!Glad to hear overall it was a good trip! I was in the Central cabin when I was there and it was great, but the west cabin you stayed in is a beauty."

5789537,stjoeguy,2017-09-28 22:54:00,979,"Hey Jeff, the cuff links were along and we tried South Hole-in-the Wall for you. I think I needed your Clown count-down rap."
5789689,pjshorthorn,2017-09-29 05:53:00,5654,"Although the fishing may have been a little slower than your June trip, it still sounds like a fun week. I miss those fall trips where it is so nice to come back and get warmed up by the stove. It must have been quite peaceful with no one else on the lake PjShorthorn"
