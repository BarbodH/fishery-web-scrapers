Friday morning we will head north for our fall excursion. 6 of us going this year. 3 newbies so I love watching these guys learn how to fish the river. I am stocked up on 3/8 to 3/4oz jigs with big plastics in every color known to man. Deep crankbaits, shallow crankbaits, blade baits, ripping raps, jigging raps, and I have some SK Custom lures that I am dying to try. The last couple of years I haven't been able to break the 30"" mark so I'm hoping this year I will get another. I am really hoping that the newbies can all catch personal bests as well. Pictures to come."

5776625,Baseline,2017-09-21 07:17:00,3207,I'm headed for the English River on Monday 9-25. I'll be further down the river at Separation Lake. In the fall season the walleyes are always on the bite. We also spend a couple days on a pike hunt. We frequently catch large pike throwing spin baits and top water buzz baits over the weeds in the deeper bays. I haven't fished Lac Suel since I discovered the the English River 15 years ago.

5793137,SteveZ,2017-10-02 09:15:00,271,"We had a good trip although the weather was all over the place. We had rain, wind, clouds, and sun. The water temp was 62 when we arrived. We like to see it in the mid 50's. We hit our usual points and reefs on the way to the dam and although we did catch fish the numbers weren't there. The size of the fish was crazy good though. I would say the average eye was 19-20"". Lots of 22-24"". We fished for a week and stayed at JR's Portage Bay Camp. We were the only ones in camp other than a group of moose hunters. Friday was our best day as we caught all of our biggest fish. The largest walleye was 29 1/2"" but there was a 26 1/2"", 25"", and 30-40 between 22"" and 24"". Our biggest northern was a fat 42""er. We had many that were between 33-36"". Our biggest smallie was 20"" and had a few that were 16-18"". Very few perch and for the first time I can remember, no one in our group caught a whitefish."
