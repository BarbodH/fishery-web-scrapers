The air temperature was in the high eighties and the water registered at 76. The warmest by far that we ever encountered at this time of the year. On Wednesday night a front came through and the temperature dropped to the forties in the morning. I'm glad I took a heavy bag of summer to late fall clothing. There wasn't any wind the first four days and we only fished mornings and evenings. After the front it was white caps and sweat shirts. I can't complain too much because we did manage a fair amount of walleye, pike, and later in the week smallmouth. The hot lure was a purple hair jig, quarter ounce, with a piece of nightcrawler. Good luck to all as the season comes to a close."
