I am referring to a spinner rig made with the following components: a snelled hook at one end of the harness, a second snelled hook, some colorful plastic beads, a blade on a clevis, and either a swivel or loop tied in the monofilament fishing line at the other end of the harness.I looked at the following language in the Regulations Summary: ""A fishing line must not have more than four hooks attached"". Thus, I am inclined to believe that a two hook crawler harness (as described above) would be legal to use when fishing in Ontario. But, I don't know what is meant in the regulations by the term ""snagger hook"".Kindest regards....."

Unless there are exceptions indicated for the particular lake you're on. I don't recall ever seeing an exception to this particular regulation though.I would assume a snagger hook would be any hook that is used to snag the fish instead of catching them lawfully. It's nothing to do with a trailer hook if that is what has you concerned. They really need to better define the terms in the regulations.

I know guys who use the three hook spinners me I some time get the 2-3 hook ones cheaper so I cut them off to make them single hooked spinner. The 2-3 hooked ones just get caught in the net or bit off by pike. But that's just my opinion. I have guys I fish with still use them and love them.

5784737,Bstar,2017-09-26 09:26:00,564,We had 2 hook harnesses on our trip to Miniss and we ended up cutting the second hook off. They were a pita and I didn't see any appreciable decline in hookups. Even with the second hook most of the fish were caught on the front hook. If we had a light bite I'm sure we would have left them on.
