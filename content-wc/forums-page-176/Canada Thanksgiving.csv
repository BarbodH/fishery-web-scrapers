This is my 5th such occasion to join them for Thanksgiving. I'm the only fisherman in camp, along with 3 moose hunters and many of the Geary extended family. Several family members hopped onto the Skywagon for a flight back to Red Lake, where they'll be back at work tomorrow.My best fish, so far, was foul hooked. I've kept no fish as Judy is keeping me well fed. Don't be fooled by weather forecasts for today. High is right at 35F with more wind than I'd like.Non resident moose season for guns opened today. Earlier opener, up north, was a success with large bulls being harvested and much larger bulls sighted after tags were filled. Same hunters will return to location in 2018. Hunters are pleased with their kills, but more excited about what they saw later.Last week's bow hunters passed up several good opportunities , holding out for a larger rack. Didn't happen, but they went home happy, expecting medium size bulls to become large bulls during next year or two.We're having a Happy Thanksgiving here, above the 51st."

Aside from the great fishing memories was the experience the lodge provided in celebration of the holiday. Because of the good food provided and the limited dining options in Westport, Canada, Canadians would come in droves to dine at the lodge and for good reason. The food was great. We would come in from a days fishing in our fishy clothes and our table was always waiting for us, usually 10 or 12 in our numbers. The dinner guests must have wondered how we got by the door. The lodge is gone but the memories are here forever. We still fish the lake every fall and share dinner presentations per man. The guys do a good job with the food but we can never duplicate the experience."
