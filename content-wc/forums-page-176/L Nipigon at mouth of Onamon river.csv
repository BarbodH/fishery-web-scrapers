Wondering if you can share your experience fishing at the mouth in mid -late June? Pike, walleye fishing how is it? Can one fish for brook trout on Nipigon via camp boat? Thanks Charlie PS How many days in your week were you restricted to fishing the river due to wind on the big lake? Researching, thank you."

Walleye season wasn't open yet for us so I can't help you there. Whenever we go up there its for 5 days and we are happy to have somewhat calm or calm 2 of those days. We've also been up there when we couldn't get on at all. Somedays the wind just isn't your friend."

Tonnes of pike throughout there as well. Also, Northwind, Onaman, Frank and some other lakes have good to great walleye fishing. Some lakes you can trailer to, some you can rent a cached boat. Expect that in early to mid June, anywhere from zero to seven days in a week you can be met with winds and weather on the main lake that might test your nerve."
