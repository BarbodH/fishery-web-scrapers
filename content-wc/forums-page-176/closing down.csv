5799489,That Minnesota guy,2017-10-06 17:40:00,8293,When do most of you Canadian lodge owners start closing the resorts down?

I recall that they mentioned two principle factors in their decision as to when to close for the season.One factor was that number of potential guests declines in mid-September. Anglers simply have other choices to pursue, such as their kids returning to school and being in fall sports, archery season for deer, upland birds, and waterfowl hunting. The costs for the lodges to operate remains fairly constant, but with fewer guests at the lodge it just doesn't make financial sense to stay open.The other factor was keeping the water lines to cabins from freezing. Many lodges have water lines that are fairly near the surface of the soil. Water lines, fitting and valves freeze overnight. The lodge owner has to get water lines thawed several days each week. Staying open much past mid-September can be a major hassle, again with relatively few guests in camp.I hope the above perspectives are helpful. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
