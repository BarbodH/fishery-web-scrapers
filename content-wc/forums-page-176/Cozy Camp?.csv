Smallmouth are present and can be good in a few area. Lots of northerns, many over 36. But also a lot of smaller northerns. Walleye were mainly in size of 15-18. Very few above 24. We have fished in July, August and September. Best fishing for us was August. Hope this helps, not really sure what info you were looking for."

We liked the website, and just wanted to get some reports on the experience! How is the drive, and any good non-fishing places distractions are there?"
5810153,northerneyes,2017-10-13 04:22:00,72,"By far the best route from central Illinois would be go north on 39 out from Bloomington. That changes into 94(I think) that's the number. Get off at Eau Claire and then take 53 to Superior/Duluth. Once you cross the bridge into Duluth take 61 north to the border crossing at Pigeon River. This is a scenic drive as 61 follows there you ca shoreline of Lake Superior. We always stop at Ryder's store and service station before crossing the border. It is about a mile before you get to the border and it is a good idea to fill up with fuel. They have both gasoline and diesel., and will be a lot cheaper than same in Canada. Once you cross the border continue on towards Thunder Bay. Once in Thunder Bay take 17 to Ignace then 599 to Cozy Camp. About 20 miles from Thunder Bay there is small town of Kakabeka Falls. As soon as you get through town there is Kakabeka Falls Park. Very scenic waterfall that is second largest in Ontario next to Niagara Falls. If you want to save a few miles and about 30-45 minute drive time, there is a shortcut that bypasses Thunder Bay. We take it and roads are good. About half way between border and Thunder Bay make a left on 130. Follow that until you come to Barrie Rooad. Turn left on Barrie go a few miles and turn right on River Road. Go a short distance and turn right on 588. This will take you to 17 just east of Kakabeka Falls. If you go to Cozy Camp try to spend some time going to Barrel Lake. There are a couple of nice islands for shore lunch or just to take a break. One has sand beach and a picnic table. It will be to the left as you enter Barrel Lake. Let me know if you need more info or PM me."
