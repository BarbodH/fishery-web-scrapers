5541041,camp chef,2017-05-13 09:15:00,915,We have lidocaine and syringes as well as a suture kit in our first aid bag.........Never had to use them but nice to know we can fix minor boo boos with out having to head to town.
5541049,pjshorthorn,2017-05-13 09:20:00,5654,"I've been doing it wrong all this time. I thought band aids, superglue , duct tape and beer could get a fella through almost any boo boo...... PjShorthorn"
5541097,tandm,2017-05-13 09:34:00,679,"I carry an 8"" mini-bolt cutter in my first aid kit. I found it at Menard's for $4.99.Cuts any size hook and can be operated with one hand. Used it one time ,so far, to cut the barb off a hook and pull the shank back. Worked great. I use it for nothing else, to avoid contamination !"
5541233,Bill Krejca,2017-05-13 10:57:00,6107,"Out of the 4 hook removals which I accomplished, I had two guys pass out, the boy and the guy nurse were the exceptions. Bill"
5541449,WallyWarrior,2017-05-13 13:21:00,2488,"I got one in my eyelid once. Daughter had a crappie on and I reached down to grab it. Small rap came loose and it slid against my eye, up under eyelid and through. I found that you bleed a lot from your eyelid. I thought I was blind, as I could only see red. I pulled the hook out and asked my 5 year old how it looked. She just said ""I think you better go to the doctor"" ha. As I got it all figured out it turned out pretty minor and we fished the rest of the day. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
5546906,Further North,2017-05-15 21:15:00,2008,"I admire your restraint...I would likely have turned the air blue for a considerable radius...I managed to stick myself like that once...Rapala Clackin' Rap...Picture at the bottom...Similar deal, fish flopped and I zigged when I shoulda zagged...got that big hook from the front buried all the way to the bend of the hook right at the joint of my thumb.Problem was the bass was still stuck on the other hook.Adrenaline kicked in, I got the bass unhooked...shoved the point through, clipped it off, slid it out...then I got a little dizzy...Sat down, drank some water, contemplated my naval lint, the state of world affairs and crimping down the barbs on fishing hooks for about 5 minutes...then went back to fishing.I've crimped my barbs ever since...haven't stuck myself either."
5538001,Limeyangler,2017-05-11 20:14:00,563,"Hi all, Went out for bass for a couple hours this afternoon, managed to get a jig in my hand trying to lip hold a fish, jig went all the way in up to the lead head almost, no way I was going on the local hospitals 'Wall of Shame'....basically a picture/cabinet with all the hooks removed from local fishermen......if yer squeamish don't watch....lol.VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/VRc-Dw5IjJA PS...whole video on the way, great little smallmouth sesh."
5538057,Pooch,2017-05-11 20:54:00,4618,"That looks familiar! Last time I did that my first thought was to not linger over it and pull it back out before I had time to think about it. Fortunately I was fishing barbless, but even then I was amazed at how hard it was to back the hook out of the meat of my hand. A barb would suck, as you know!!I'm now 95% barbless.Thanks for the pre-season ""reminder""!Pooch"
5538553,Bill Krejca,2017-05-12 06:40:00,6107,"Several years ago, I spent some time in the Dryden ER, waiting for an exam on a companion. Across from me was a family with a young fellow who walked in with, I believe it was a Wally Diver, hanging from his forehead. It seemed like several hours before he was called in for removal. Gotta look in back of you when casting, folks! Bill"
5538865,pjshorthorn,2017-05-12 07:42:00,5654,"Yeah, I flinched a bit watching you try to yank it out....I would have done the same thing though. Excellent fish though !!!!The worst injury I've had on a fishing trip is when I destroyed my right thumb closing a sliding door on a houseboat. It was pouring rain on opening week and I was soaked going into the houseboat. My hand slipped off the handle and I smashed my thumb to the point where it was huge immediately. We were 60 miles by boat from Sioux Lookout so I fished with my right hand in the water the rest of the week to keep the pain down..... The rest of the guys wanted to poke a hole in my fingernail to relieve the pressure, but I said $&@: no....too much chance of an infection. I still shiver thinking about that incident.PjShorthorn"
5539121,wmd,2017-05-12 09:14:00,388,"If you push down on the eye of the hook or jig until you feel very little resistance you have the hook positioned at the angle it went in the hand and comes reasonably easy. There is a hook remover kit that helps in removal. Still going to hurt but it does help to do this , had a veterinarian tell and show me this on a guys hand, he had removed a lot of fish hooks from dogs over the years. wmd"
5539321,Wedge,2017-05-12 10:24:00,270,"I had a hook buried in my calf bass fishing in Florida. It wasnt as long as a jig hook. It was a treble hook on the back of a floating rapala. One of the 3 hooks was buried to the junction point where the other two were. I ended up going to the E.R. They gave it a shot to numb it and pushed the hook further thru and punctured out a different spot, cut the barb, and slid it out. I was trying to do this myself before going in, but the skin was just stretching and the hook wouldnt puncture again. Oh well! Not as bad as when I hit the back of my ear/head with a 1oz daredevil. We were portaged 5 lakes into the boundary waters and I was 15."
5539889,GWC,2017-05-12 15:54:00,1021,I've had to push a few through & cut the barb off to get them out. Not fun at all.

5540177,Live to jig,2017-05-12 19:38:00,159,"My brother said he will pull it on 3....more like, 1 and yank!!!! It was like the 3rd fish of the trip.."
