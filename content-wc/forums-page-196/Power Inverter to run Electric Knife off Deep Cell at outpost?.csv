5542521,bushead11,2017-05-14 08:26:00,151,Was thinking about hauling an extra battery to camp this year so that we can run an electric rapala filet knife in our fish house. We have a generator at outpost but having it on kills the serenity of being up in Canada. My question is : would one 12v battery be enough power to clean 10 walleyes for 7 days? I would buy an inverter and already have the cigarette adapter with alligator clips. Any experience doing this or insight would be great! Thanks in advance... 4 days till we hit the road!

Depends on the pull from the electric knife, the amount of time you use it (some guys are faster than others on 10 walleye), and some batteries hold a better charge. Let me say, I have used small inverters on deep cycles for c-pap machines. They probably pull less than an electric knife, but not much less. A good battery can get 4-5 nights on most machines. (somewhere in the range of 30 hours). I would venture with a new deep cycle battery and a full charge, you'll be good to go for the week. Safest option is to throw a small trickle charger in too. When you go out fishing, start the generator to charge the battery."

I plan on bringing a trickle charger to be able to alternate trolling motor batteries. Like you said, throw one on the generator when we leave camp so we don't have to listen to it...!"
5542777,outdoorsron,2017-05-14 09:29:00,843,Hello: What about a small solar panel to run the trickle charger ? Never used one so I don't know if it is feasible or not. Good Luck. O - R

Granted, its not being used for 10 days, but it takes a lot more of a toll on the battery to clean a batch of salmon and trout than it does 10 walleye and I've never had an issue or noticed reduced battery performance from using it. I'd think you'd be fine... I love the idea of using a solar trickle charger to help keep the batteries full."
5544257,bushead11,2017-05-14 20:14:00,151,"Understood Ron. We are lazy, on vacation and drawing the short straw to clean all the fish with a headlamp isn't great. The addition of an electric knife has really cut down the time I spend cleaning panfish at home and I've gotten pretty efficient with it. I have gotten spoiled and want to have more time for beer drinking and cigar smoking in Canada and less time in the fish house...!"
5544762,Bill Krejca,2017-05-15 06:50:00,6107,"Just a thought - while in some waters it may be lawful to clean fish while out on the water, it may be not lawful on other waters. It is a good idea to be aware of the differences. Generally guessing, on other than the huge waters, it is probably not legal (due to size restrictions). Bill"
5544930,Eldojb,2017-05-15 07:27:00,41,"Id guess you are correct. I just know I always saw the Charter boats all do it on Lake Michigan so I assumed it is ok. I should double check though too, just to be safe."
