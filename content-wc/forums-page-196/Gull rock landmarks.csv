5535945,Rock Hound,2017-05-10 19:58:00,51,"I have been to Gullrock on about 16 trips. I do know some of the locations you are talking about. 1. Sisters Island must be ""Three Sisters"" - That is located on the NE part of your map just left of the finger pointing west of the river coming in from the east shoreline. 2. Round Rock Island . . . no clue - I either don't know where that is, or we call it by a different name. *My guess is that it might be the island under the C of ""Gullrock Lake"" on the map, but that is only a guess. 3. Franks Island . . . again, no clue - I either don't know where that is, or we call it by a different name. 4. Burnt Island . . . On your map, it is located right above the ""O"" on ""Gullrock Lake"" on the map. The entire island burned at the same time from a fire, thus the name ""Burnt Island"" - You cannot miss it, all of the trees are the exact same height. 5. Iowa Point . . . no clue - I have never seen that name on a detailed map, maybe we call it something different - most islands on the lake are not named, even on the detailed maps. 6. Clay Banks - That is located directly south of the ""Gullrock Lake"" on the map below the G and the U where the big point is cupped like a ""C"" - You cannot miss it - It is a clay bank wall coming down to the lake surface. There is a huge underwater flat coming out a half mile from the clay bank to the east toward the center of the lake. Sorry I could only help on a few spots - those other names I have never heard of. I am interested where they might be - I find new spots with fish everywhere, I am sure there are a lot more!"
5536561,AMPHIB206,2017-05-11 07:34:00,191,"Hey thanks. That helps a lot. I am planning an early trip to gullrock, pakwash, lac seul and Lake of the Woods in early June over 5 days."
5536569,outdoorsron,2017-05-11 07:45:00,843,"WOW: Gull Rock , Packwash , Lac Suel and Lake of the Woods in 5 days ? You won't have much time on any lake because you will either be driving or sleeping most of the time. Unless you are just trying to decide which lake to go to. Good Luck. O - R"
5536897,jamesherbst,2017-05-11 09:54:00,12,"I'm pretty sure that Frank's island is the island located just to the north and a bit east of the ""E"" in Gullrock Lake. Good walleye fishing on the north side of it!"
5537017,Wedge,2017-05-11 11:19:00,270,"I dont know names of spots, but I do know some spots on Pakwash if your interested. We will be there June 10-17"
5538073,AMPHIB206,2017-05-11 21:04:00,191,Thanks for the offer for Pakwash. I'm familiar with that lake. The best spot is sometimes right off the beach at the Park. Some of those Gull Rock names I pulled from WC archives. They may be not be that well known; or named by locals It's the one lake I've never fished. Side imaging should help find some spots too. Launching at Gold Pines on Lac Seul. There's lots of spots between there and lunker point.
5540233,Rock Hound,2017-05-12 20:02:00,51,"Like most lakes in the area, wind will be a huge factor in finding the stacked up walleyes on Gullrock. In June, if you get a consistent south wind, you will find them stacked up near Ranger Bay. Know where the fish refuge line is and when the area is closed / open (June 15?). The north end of the lake gets shallower and shallower, and when the wind blows into it the walleyes are stacked like cord wood (and they put on a feed bag when they are up there). It is a long boat ride up there, but if the wind is blowing consistently for a couple days it is an incredible bite. There are good spots throughout the lake, but fishing where the wind is blowing into will work on all locations. If you don't get consistent winds, fish will be a little deeper (like a traditional lake), but steady wind will find fish pretty shallow on this lake in June. If you get calm weather fish structure more and bottle neck areas. FYI, if you get a May Fly hatch try a half pink / half white jig with half of a night crawler - you will be amazed! Otherwise chartreuse green, light blue, and yellow gold are my favorite colors on this lake. Good luck, it is a very good (excellent) walleye lake, and it is pretty safe to navigate with most dangerous areas marked. Keg Lake has a lot more hazards. One of the most dangerous spots on Gullrock is""The Gullrock"", which is an underwater rock pile about 2 inches under water. It is about the size of a wrestling mat and has taken plenty a lower unit out. It is usually marked with a white jug, but not always. There are usually Seagulls standing on it (it is about half way between what has been described as Frank's Island and Three Sisters Island on this post). We have taken some cool pictures of guys standing on the Gullrock (looks like you are walking on water), but it really sneaks up on you and there is deeper water all around it. If you are running down to Three Sisters or to Ranger Bay stay to the west side of the lake and you will be fine. Good luck!"
