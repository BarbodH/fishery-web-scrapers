5544473,Brentrust,2017-05-14 21:41:00,3,"I booked May 27-June 3, 2017 several weeks ago at Northumbrian Resort at Sioux Lookout to fish Minitaki. Have not had response to e-mails or phone messages in several weeks. Does anybody have any information on that camp? Getting worried. If these folks do surface and we make it to Minitaki, any advice on fishing walleyes on that lake during that week? We were there last year but two week later and, with that early spring, finding Walleyes was a challenge. Brentrust"
