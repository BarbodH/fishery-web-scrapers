To be honest, I might opt to get them delivered a few days before I leave so I have the peace of mind that comes with having them in hand....so I can then concentrate my efforts on getting my posse there intact as my father may insist on listening to Neil Diamond continuously for his mandatory stretch of driving....or maybe that's his ploy to get out of driving....clever fella my Dad is."
5547322,txk4,2017-05-16 06:37:00,31,"We do 3 trips a summer, and always take night crawlers across the border with out any troubles- yet. For storage, I pick them up at a local bait shop the day we are leaving -just have to order ahead- and put them in a plastic cat litter bucket that fits into one of our coolers. I make sure there is ice in the cooler each day, the bucket keeps them from getting wet and they always last the week. Have a great trip and enjoy the Neil Diamond songs."
5547362,Aspencreek,2017-05-16 06:47:00,2911,"That is a good idea, the containers (or bags) the crawlers come in never stand up to the travel or week long handling. I just looked at the empty cat littler bucket and the wide mouth is perfect and the plastic jug will easily hold up, great idea. I was ready to use an old cooler with freezer packs, but I'm re-thinking that now."
5547442,That Minnesota guy,2017-05-16 07:05:00,8293,You can call Cold Spring Bait 218-757-3191 tell them what you need and where you are going. They are located on Hwy 53 in Minnesota about 40 miles south of International Falls. They supply all the bait to all the resorts in the area. Be sure they will be open the hours you are traveling through.
5547522,Bstar,2017-05-16 07:34:00,564,The OP said they are going to O'Sullivan Lake near Nakina so I doubt they will be going in at IFalls. They'll probably take 61 out of Duluth and cross at Grand Portage/Pidgeon River on their way to Thunder Bay and then northeast on 17/11.
5547538,That Minnesota guy,2017-05-16 07:39:00,8293,My bad.
5541281,andreindy,2017-05-13 11:39:00,308,"Maiden trip to Canada in July, 4 of us, admittedly amateurs who will most likely set the hook when a fish passes gas in the vicinity of our jigs. Walleye Central wisdom says to have nightcrawlers with us. We are driving from Wisconsin to O'Sullivan's Lake (Nakina, Ontario)...and I presume going through Superior Wisconsin, up through Minnesota, etc. Would anyone recommend purchasing a flat or 1/2 flat on-line in advance and transport with us (in Canada approved bedding) or is there some place in route that anyone can recommend I purchase them from? Worm maintenance isn't rocket science, (been reading the threads on WC) but they are also not maintenance free and my goal is to arrive to camp with worms that are as eager (and alive) as we are. Thank you all."
5541521,tadler,2017-05-13 14:31:00,43,We took them in last year instead of purchasing in Canada. That cost us 2 hours at the border while they went thru the entire truck and our luggage looking for more than we told them we had. I heard that was the MO last year - check everyone bringing in crawlers. This year we are buying them once we get across the border.
5541561,Bstar,2017-05-13 14:54:00,564,We used to haul crawlers up with us from Indiana until we got smart and pre-ordered them and picked them up in Fort Frances at Rainy Lake Sports. Obviously your not going that way so try to find a bait shop on your way in Canada. Check out Silver Minnow Bait northeast of Thunder Bay and not too far off of the highway. I don't have any personal experience with them but I seem to remember somebody on here mentioning them. Here's their website and you can pre-order. http://silverminnowbait.com/ The prices with the exchange are reasonable. Also check with your outfitter. They might be able to get them for you and have them there when you get there. Good luck on your trip. I hear nothing but good things about the fishing on O'Sullivan Lake.First time to Canada? You'll be hooked.BstarI see your from Waukesha. I have relatives there. It's a nice town.
5541585,tandm,2017-05-13 15:20:00,679,"Took crawlers into Canada three times last year .Never had an issue. When asked, we told them we had nightcrawlers packed in paper bedding . That was the extent of it . I bet they were looking for the rest of your booze. Just joking ,sometimes they can be difficult."
5541617,adempsey2.0,2017-05-13 15:39:00,612,"I live in Canada, so it's not the same situation, but I just pre-order a flat from a shop along my route. Your outfitter will have recommendations I am sure if you decide to purchase them in Canada. Cost for me has ranged from $50 to $100 Canadian for a flat (~$35 to $75 USD). Quality was bad once. Always check the flat before you leave the shop if you can. The night before we fly in, I transfer the flat to my own container with worm bedding. I remove any dead ones I find. It's not the most fun thing to do after driving 14 hours, lol, but what can ya do.I'd be surprised if you can't just order them straight from O'Sullivans. Even if it's more $ it's probably worth it."
5541737,pan-man,2017-05-13 19:03:00,299,"I have been going to Canada for 15 years, close to 40 trips. I brought crawlers everytime in bedding. I have not once been stopped and searched. I just declared crawlers in bedding, frozen shiners, and any booze. I would suggest ordering from reputable online bait store (you should pay about $50/flat) for the week before you leave."
5541745,Bill Krejca,2017-05-13 19:03:00,6107,O'S Rainbow generally doesn't have them. Sometimes guests will leave their left overs. Bill
5541945,The tank,2017-05-13 20:35:00,340,We have taken worms across every year never a problem. But we did get pulled over and checked on the way back in the states. US customs wanted to see our worms that we was bring back. Only had a few dozen left I wanted to dump them but others wanted to bring them home. From than on they get left at camp.
5542457,LoDo,2017-05-14 07:39:00,721,"We have always purchased in US, transferred in proper bedding and never had an issue. Be honest crossing the border with all your gear and you'll be fine. Booze, smokes, bait, etc...."
5544321,Aspencreek,2017-05-14 20:26:00,2911,"We always just order a 1/2 flat or full flat from Rainy Lake Sports in Ft Francis, and leave what we don't use with the Lodge owner for the next group(s). He is appreciative although I assume they are going to the groups that follow us. Why Rainy Lake, because that is where we get our licenses and leeches too. Transfer the leeches into a 1/2 gallon milk jug and into the cooler for the rest of the trip up to LS. Easy, simple and no problems at the border."
