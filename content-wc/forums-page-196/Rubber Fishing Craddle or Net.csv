5544786,bthomas3333,2017-05-15 06:55:00,465,I really like my Frabil nets. The work great. Nothing gets tangled. Never had a hook pierce the rubber. SUPER strong we had a ~20lb pike in it and no give in the pole or connection to the net ring.Downside is weight. They are relatively heavy. Sort of pricey.If you can get past the weight and price. They are great. Available all over I bought at Cabelas.Brett
