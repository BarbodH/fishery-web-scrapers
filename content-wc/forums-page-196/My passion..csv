5542841,Limeyangler,2017-05-14 09:50:00,563,"Hi all, Learning to fly my new Mavic Pro drone, steep learning curve but I am so thrilled with the initial results. Finally I feel like I can capture on film what I can only describe as my passion, and hopefully share what makes me feel ALIVE! Hope this gets the juices flowing for everyone who is coming up this year!DRONE FOOTAGE VIDEO OF LAKE WABIGOONhttps://youtu.be/Ptp23sjI60M"

5542889,Limeyangler,2017-05-14 09:59:00,563,I hate that show....it makes me too jealous....lol.
5542985,v-bay gord,2017-05-14 11:17:00,3168,Nice!! A few years ago you would have needed a camera crew and helicopter to get footage like that.

5543489,Obabikon,2017-05-14 14:38:00,2370,Great video! Can't wait to be out there on a day like that!

5544465,packpro,2017-05-14 21:37:00,695,Would love to get started with this technology. What type of gear are you using? Standing on the ground can you see what the drone sees? Battery life? How much footage can be stored on the drone? Thanks
