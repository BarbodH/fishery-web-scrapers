5173809,luckwis,2016-10-28 19:23:00,3,Our group is thinking about making a move to a new lake from Birch Lake. Trying to decide between the two Lodges for the first or second week of July. Lots of good info on here on Trout Lake not much on Roderick. Most of the group likes numbers of walleye. I want some bigger fish and better lake trout fishing. Been going to Birch Lake for years and the fishing has been great for numbers of walleye and pike but not so great for trout. Get tons of 15 to 22 inch walleye but rarely get any over 25 inch. 2 or 3 pike over 40 inch in a week. Anyone able to give me a comparison on the fishing between these lakes? Thanks

5173897,luckwis,2016-10-28 20:56:00,3,Could be better trout fishing on far end from the camp we stayed at. Camp managers could only recall a few caught incidentally in the spring last few years. Marked fish but could only pull up northern when trolling 40 to 60 ft down over 50 to 100 foot of water. Wouldn't want to discourage you from trying Birch. Tremendous walleye and pike numbers. Some silver colored pike. I'm sure a better fisherman could figure out the trout but I should have caught one by accident with the effort put in.Sent from my Z932L using Tapatalk

5537001,Pink Unicorn,2017-05-11 11:16:00,83,"I have been fishing Roderick (or other Chimo outposts) for 24 years. Lately we have been going to an outpost in spring, Roderick in August.Caught a 40"" pike on Roderick, another at Marvin and another at Culverson. Looking for a 45"" this year! Our group just started getting into Laker fishing using a 3 way swivel, 1oz egg and a 4"" lighter spoon. We don't put a ton of effort into it but usually catch at least one. From what I have heard (and seen), you will have a hard time finding one under 28"". There is a guy who goes the week after us in Aug and regularly catches 40""+ pike. Like 3 or 4 a day. We're more walleye fisherman, usually catching loads of 18-23"", a dozen or so 23-25"" and a few 25""-28"". Never caught one bigger than 28.5"".Roderick is a great camp if your looking for bigger shield tea stained water, portages and simple accommodations. If your looking for American Plan type stuff your best to go elsewhere. Heading up in 13 days to Shultz for the first time, will report back!Neil"
