I asked the Border Services Officer if there would be any points of emphasis this summer (e.g. poultry, eggs, potatoes, minnows, etc.). He said there were no points of emphasis in place at this time, but that it could change at any time.I traveled north on Hwy. 502 to Dryden. It was clear that there would be road work this season on this highway, as there were several stretches of roadway with orange markings and sticks. It looked as though isolated stretches of roadway would be resurfaced.There was some minor roadwork in progress between Dryden and Vermillion Bay. It looked as though the crews were restoring proper drainage in the ditches.The Canadian bush seems extremely dry to me. I wouldn't be surprised if fire bans are put in place before too long. You might want to pay attention to signs and ask your camp's manager about fire bans if you plan to do shore lunches.The water level in the lakes that I have been past appear very low to me. I am visiting friends on a lake that is normally not susceptible to big fluctuations in water level. This lake is down almost two feet from last autumn's water level. The water level in Lac Seul is about the same level as last autumn, down around four feet or so. Boat operators will want to be aware of navigational hazards that may be in play due to the low water level that are not normally in play in the opening weeks of the season.I met with a friend a few days ago that guides in the Dryden area. He said the walleyes were still spawning at that time. I suspect that some walleyes are finished with their spawn, while others may be spawning right now.The ice went out on many lakes several weeks ago. During the last week, the weather has been cloudy and very cool. The water temperatures haven't increased very much from ice out.Good fishing this season and tight lines!!"

The bush is really dry, I played golf yesterday here in Winnipeg and the fairways and greens were very hard and it was crazy dusty. It's been cool and windy lately. I would not be starting a fire on shore right now in most areas. Last weekend the surface temp were in the high 40's. Obviously we weren't fishing walleye, but the pike were not aggressive. We caught one small one but has multiple larger fish either following out jerk baits in or rolling them without hitting them."

The water level on Lake of the Woods is within 3-4 inches of where it was at this time last year. Scroll towards the bottom... look for ""elevation"" charts. Lac Seul and Lake of the Woods are both nearly identical to this point last year.The bush is very dry. We need rain, and without it, there will be a fire ban. Supposed to get storms Tuesday so that will be helpful. Water's still cold, but I'm going to guess all the Walleye on LOTW's should be done by now. Water temps around 50 at the dock."
