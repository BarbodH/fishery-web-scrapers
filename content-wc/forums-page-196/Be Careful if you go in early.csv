5541441,orchard frank,2017-05-13 13:12:00,1900,"Years ago, my wife and I were on a remote part of Lac Seul, when a plane circled a couple times then landed. Idled up to us, short chat, never checked our licenses, or for beer, or fish when we told them we had none on board. Asked us to give them room for take-off and left. Should mention that my wife was enjoying the early season sunshine with her shirt off, and had to hurry to put it back on when it became apparent they were landing. She made the officers grin when she said ""You guys sure circled around a lot before landing"""
5541465,LoDo,2017-05-13 13:33:00,721,"Still seems odd to me they land the plane and idle to your boat to say hello and not check for booze, stats of fish, etc.... BIG waste of money IMO. Dock the f'ing plane, jump in a OPP boat and check 10x the boaters. Write tickets, pay for the day. Seems like the OPP is a more of a concierge than anything."
5539441,pjshorthorn,2017-05-12 11:36:00,5654,"If you want to take the chance, that is your prerogative. If you want to lose your gear and boat, that is also your prerogative . If you want to have a trip where you are fined, thrown in jail, escorted to the border, etc.. that is your prerogative .....You most likely will have a difficult time clearing customs into Canada on the next trip or many subsequent years. Best of luck on your trip this year. PjShorthorn"
5539505,HeHooksHimself,2017-05-12 11:50:00,725,"We may or may not like to take a few beers on the boat, but we never get drunk. At least on the water. But the fact is, there is a law against drinking beer on the boat just like there is drinking beer in a moving car. I have heard that it really depends on the officer, but they can fine you for it or probably arrest you for DUI if you fail the breathalyzer. It is a calculated risk that each person can consider individually. PJ Shorthorn doesn't need to drink on the boat because he always acts like he is impaired on something. It could have something to do with pink yoga pants, I'm not sure. If he hasn't, he should be arrested for his wardrobe. I think Gord sells him the yoga pants at the commissary. Fish On! Hooks"
5539529,CI_Guy,2017-05-12 12:04:00,2118,"We've been checked by COs and the OPP on Lac Suel and Minitaki. They were polite & professional but looked in all coolers and compartments for alcohol or fish. They were friendly after we past their search.I've heard several parties at camps tell stories of receiving a warning because they had one can of beer along to use for shore lunch batter. The couple of people who I have heard tell stories about being ticketed had paid fines that started around $150. and could go a lot higher. They thought they had been fined per can or bottle.Years ago the resort owner in Sioux Lookout warned us that if you tested below the legal limit on the water you could still be ticketed for a lesser offense, but if you blew over the legal limit you were spending a few nights in jail, paying huge fines and legal fees and most likely would never be able to return to Ontario."
5539625,pjshorthorn,2017-05-12 12:30:00,5654,"Hooks, you are correct. I have pushed the limits of yoga wardrobe etiquette in Canada. Pink, orange, Chartruese ,indigo blue and the old standby....white. White should only be worn on the way home at the end of the week...for obvious reasons. Breezy Point has a visual deficiency in being able to identify boats on the lake that are in his fishing group........so I have had to make it a little easier on him by wearing bright colored clothing while out on the water. To your point, in order to avoid a possible awkward conversation with the MNR if they were to land this year, I'll be switching over to wearing bib overalls to cover up the yoga pants. I'm pretty sure the MNR knows who I am by now..... but it is a time for a change. It gets a little worrisome when they buzz you all the time thinking they have found some cute chick out fishing; and then they just fly away. PjShorthorn"
5539761,BreezyPoint,2017-05-12 14:27:00,1581,"Just as long as they bib overalls are bright pink, yellow, orange or red, it will be OK for you to change out the yoga pants. If they are not, my visual impairments may make it impossible for me to see you and avoid running in to you.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"

5540313,Guest,2017-05-12 20:40:00,0,"Just a heads up that they do not escort to the border. If it's bad enough they throw you in jail and confiscate everything you brought with. Then you will be kicked out of the country and not just the province. - I've been through some of the legal stuff with Canada and all is good for me now, but you should tread lightly as I do. I cross about 60-80 times a year and treat customs, MNR, and the OPP teams with respect. I deal with those guys a lot outside of their professions and they are normal like you and I, but they take their jobs extremely serious. Don't be the joker that trys to sneak stuff in, because you hold up the line and make everyone's day miserable including customs agents. The classic last year were gas tanks filled with minnows, lol bunch of clowns. I got pulled into immigrations so watched them get kicked out of Ontario and received mega fines. Once they catch one thing they keep digging to get as much as possible, you broke the law once so what's to stop you from having done more????!!!!! Be safe"
5540681,pjshorthorn,2017-05-13 06:08:00,5654,"Ok , blue it is. PjShorthorn"
5540705,pjshorthorn,2017-05-13 06:21:00,5654,"I agree. Years ago we were pulled over at a fish check station on the side of 502 immediately after turning onto it on our way home. I happened to get the senior officer who was really there to answer questions from junior officers in training. He checked our licenses and asked how many fish I had, but didn't make us take them out of the coolers. Since we had three vehicles traveling together it took a bit of time for the junior officers to pull fish and measure them, etc, etc... I asked our officer about how they approach serious violations and he said there wasn't much wiggle room if it was obvious that individuals were blatantly breaking the law. He mentioned alcohol and specifically said they can take all our stuff if they wanted to when the violation was serious.A few years back I was at Lac Seul Outposts in the fall on a solo trip. One evening I was taking in the sunset on the cabin porch and could hear boats running wide open. It turned out to be the group that came into camp that afternoon. As they turned into the narrows towards camp, you could hear them hooting and hollering. The owner and camp hand met them at the beach and all you saw was the camp hand scrambling to pick up all the beer cans from the bottom of every boat as quick as he could. It probably took him 5 minutes to clean out the three boats. I suspect they would have all gone to jail or had big fines if they had been caught.PjShorthorn"
5540817,Shellback,2017-05-13 07:05:00,8083,"I've been advised to not even be a ""nice guy"", by picking up empties other folks have left behind. It would be a sorry day to get fined for picking up trash someone else left behind. Off subject, but another quirk I don't understand. No porta potties in boats, only regular marine pump out toilets."
5510730,yoopertrout,2017-04-30 09:06:00,1172,"I've never had an issue, because we follow the law. Why spend a vacation in God's country drinking all day anyway?"
5510986,bowtech840,2017-04-30 11:21:00,111,I don't see what the big deal is about having a few beers in the boat? Obviously the ppl that want to drink and get hammered are going to do it anyway. Pretty easy to hide a bottle of hard alcohol on the boat. What I don't get is when we drive into town to get more supplies during the week - half the ppl you talk to are hammered drunk and its 8am (this is drive in not fly in)? Would think they would focus more on cleaning up the community than the tourist out on a remote lake but obviously that's not the case.
5513322,U D,2017-05-01 08:28:00,249,Just don't break the law and you won't have anything to worry about!!
5513914,walleye22,2017-05-01 10:48:00,59,Agreed...follow the rules and laws and you have NO worries. Pretty simple to me.
5516138,Baseline,2017-05-02 07:25:00,3207,"I do some ice fishing in Canada. We use snowmobiles to get to some fairly remote lakes and my group has been checked by the OPP and MNR several times. We've been checked on LOW, Manitou, Rowan, and a lake way north of the Ignace area. They zoom in on snowmobiles. We are always legal and don't bring adult beverages out with us. They check our trout and licenses and move on. I've never been checked by the MNR on open water, but have been through their roadside game checks several times. The best way to avoid problems it to stay legal and know the game laws."
5516282,maddogg,2017-05-02 07:54:00,178,Some people must enjoy fishing with a hangover.
5516402,Ricky Spanish,2017-05-02 08:23:00,1298,"We seasoned drinkers don't really get hangovers. I actually do not drink in the boat, or during the day on fishing trips, so I don't really worry about getting checked. When I am on vacation in the most beautiful place I have seen, fishing my tail off 12hrs a day, I must celebrate each day by closing the lodge's bar down. I want to talk and hear about everyone else's day on the lake. Up at 5 for coffee and a greasy breakfast, and do it all over again. It makes me tingle just thinking about it. Truly my Happy Place."
5516554,Golden Eagle,2017-05-02 08:47:00,2642,"We fished a week prior to the opener in May 2016 and didn't see a fish cop.Second week, opening week, was a different story. My partner and I were casting a large bay for pike when we noticed a boat sitting about 1/3 mile from us. I glassed it when it moved and recognized the boat as one belonging to a retired officer and it was usually docked at his cabin which is downstream from the lake we were fishing. We had no alcohol and neither of us is skilled enough to fish with 2 rods, so no contact was made. We were watched for about 40 minutes.Leaving the bay we boated close enough to observe that the boat operator did not have fishing gear and that his partner was lying on the floor of the boat. We waved. That night in camp we found out that 6 fishermen had been fined for fishing with 2 rods. Nobody was over on fish. Four guys were warned about alcohol consumption and asked to hold it down. They were lucky.All fishermen were flown to the lake. MNR guys got there by truck, walking a trail and borrowing a boat from a friend."
5539361,bowtech840,2017-05-12 10:48:00,111,"So I'm still curious with all the talk about ""no alcohol""........ What's the punishment? Thrown in jail, ticket, escort to the border, ect......? Seems the majority think it's a big problem but I haven't heard a story of ppl who have been caught? I know where we go the camp owner warns about it but seems odd you don't ever hear of anyone being caught and the consequences?Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
5539417,Whopper,2017-05-12 11:21:00,340,"Over 15years ago I was issued a ticket that cost me $140.00 for three unopened cans of beer in my boat on Lake Nipissing. My rider at the time was taking a nap and the fine CO thought he was drunk/passed out and made him take the breathalyzer, he didn't even register. I was told at the time if would have registered they would have taken him to jail. There were two CO's and one OPP officer in the boat and pulled up to me to do a ""safety check"" and found the beer in my cooler."
5509642,HeHooksHimself,2017-04-29 18:04:00,725,"This year, as we did last year and plan to do in the coming years, we are arriving on Friday morning setting up and getting on the water for Friday afternoon. Now, we are aware that walleye season won't be starting until the next day, but we usually go trout hunting or bass hunting, knowing that we would never keep a walleye. Last year was the earliest we got on the water with three boats. As you can imagine, we were just ready to blow civilization out of our heads with a line in the water. Some of us decided it was a good day for beer drinking and had a few beverages with us. We should have realized that the boys in the yellow planes might be scouting for poachers and sure enough, the landed next to one of our boats. Those boys had two little smallies that the officers measured and determined were legal. Fortunately, only one of the guys in that boat was a beer drinker and he only had one that he had already consumed with the crushed can in his pocket. They didn't pat him down so they never found the can and all was good. Fortunately, our other two boats were not checked. One's captain was convinced that we should eat fish that night and had a couple bass right at what he thought was the limit, 14"". When we proved to him later that the regulation was 13 3/4"" he was quite relieved that he was not checked. The other boat, which may or may not have included me, had an afternoon's worth of adult beverages for two. Those boys were also glad they were not checked. Needless to say, we are going to be very legal this year. We leave in 19 days! Fish On! Hooks"

5509730,LoDo,2017-04-29 19:07:00,721,Ive done fly-in trips for 25yrs throughout much of NW Ontario and have never one time seen a plane land on the water near a boat to search for folks drinking. Thats crazy!! Be careful out there folks!

I saw them checking a few boats on the water when they first landed as well.I understand OPP hanging out at docks/camps waiting for boaters to come into camp to check booze, fish stats, etc....., but are you saying OPP flies their floatplane up to a boat in the middle of the lake? If so, this seems dangerous for both parties and a bit expensive for OPP. Why not land the plane, dock, jump in an OPP boat and drive boat to boat checking fish stats and drunk boaters."
5510066,adempsey2.0,2017-04-29 22:31:00,612,"Yes, they did. The plane landed and went up to a couple of boats. The OPP and MNR were on the same MNR plane. I have no idea if this is typical or not.The lodge I was at isn't very far from the plane base. It's about a 10-15 minute plane ride. So, that might have something to do with it."
5510274,HeHooksHimself,2017-04-30 05:56:00,725,"That is exactly what they did. I think it is obvious that they were looking for illegal walleye since it was the day before opener. In fairness, they didn't even ask about the beer, but there has been a lot of chatter on WC about what happens when they find it. And if they would have checked the boat on the south end, the one that may or may not have included me, and fined us at say $200/beer, that might have been pretty painful. Like I said, beer will remain in the cabin this year, especially on Friday. Fish On! Hooks"
5510658,LoDo,2017-04-30 08:34:00,721,"Thats incredible!! I'll keep the lake we fish to myself. I'm fishing Lac Seul for the first time in over 12 yrs this June. I'm not worried about the walleye stats with our group. On nights we eat fish each fisherman keeps one under 18"". IMO, thats all you need. Years ago we used to buy the 4 fish limit, but now we just buy the 2 fish limit. We don't take fish home as its a bit of a hassle w/ coolers, dry ice, drive to MSP, flight to Denver, etc..... Might be different this year with the drive in camp. I guess we'll have to keep an eye on our line, eye in the air and ears perked."
