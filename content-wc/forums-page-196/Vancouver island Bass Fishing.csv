He had been inviting me to come out for the last couple of years since I moved to Canada and the stars finally aligned and we were able to connect on an AMAZING day to get out and fish the early spring pre-spawn bite. The fish had really transitioned from the week prior and had now moved up in shallower water waiting to move up and start making nests. We found most of the fish by fishing docks on the sunny shorelines where the water temperature was the highest. The fish were slow though as a high pressure system had them a little tight lipped. The finesse drop shot with a green and white shad shaped worm was the ticket and it was FISH ON once Matt got things worked out. The rest is history. What an absolute blast we had out there. Check out the video and I'm sure you'll agree.http://img.photobucket.com/albums/09...50769776_n.jpghttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/09...70787572_n.jpghttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/09...49218776_n.jpghttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/09...43641239_n.jpghttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/09...86351092_n.jpghttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/09...42369548_n.jpghttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/09...97460229_o.jpghttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/09...58063826_o.jpg"
