Of course from his many long winded posts and off the wall points of view, I had formed an image in my mind of who this person might be. Let's say I was surprised that my mental image was way off the mark. Anybody care to guess who's who in this picture?"

5535857,v-bay gord,2017-05-10 19:32:00,3168,"I was expecting Ted to be much taller, possibly wearing a tie, and sprouting $100 bills (US of course because of the convenience factor). As it was I had to chase him away from sneaking half empty wine glasses off the table. I finally just bought him drinks for the rest of the night so he wouldn't embarrass himself further....... He did say caviar prices for the camp were way up this year.....By the way all winning guesses are eligible for a free cold one in the fish house at VBL. I'm also planning on taking Ted up on his offer to stop by his lodge for happy hour. I'm sure when he said this he was referring to all his WC friends and acquaintances."
5536177,pjshorthorn,2017-05-11 00:26:00,5654,"Uuuummmm, Gord ? I don't know how to break it to you, but Ted has offered me a full week's stay at his place since I was the first to guess his identity correctly. How about you just bring the beer to the happy hour at Ted's place ? Since you will more than likely not want to drive home after the social, you can bunk in my cabin. The washrooms have large clawfoot tubs ,from what I understand , so you should be able to get at least two thirds of your Sasquatch size body into the tub. PjShorthorn"
