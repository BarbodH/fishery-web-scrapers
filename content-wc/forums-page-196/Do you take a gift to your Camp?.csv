5542249,Skywagon,2017-05-14 05:14:00,1106,"Thank you for the offer Bstar, but we will be receiving our annual sweet corn and tomato delivery from Central Illinois just prior to that. Enjoy your fishing trip."
5535705,Obabikon,2017-05-10 17:27:00,2370,By mid July I'm always putting in requests (that are almost always filled) for garden grown tomatoes. 2 bacon and tomato sandwiches really is a fantastic way to start my day!
5536089,Aspencreek,2017-05-10 21:45:00,2911,"Our group always brings a WI care package: Cheese, Brats (Hoff's in Brownsville), Summer sausage, Hot sticks, and for the lady of the house a case of REAL Mt Dew."
5536601,Skywagon,2017-05-11 07:52:00,1106,"If it is in season, take them some Super Sweet corn, the sweet corn we buy in the store up here tastes like field corn. That is always #1 on my request list if someone from down south is coming to our place in July/August."
5540049,Walleye Wanderer,2017-05-12 18:22:00,101,I usually take a nice single malt scotch...and help them dispense of it
5540289,Pooch,2017-05-12 20:23:00,4618,"Wife's sweet corn is up and can be ""rowed"". Too bad her husbands replant hasn't even germinated yet. I would trade her jobs, but she doesn't like auto steer. Silly girl....Pooch"
5540617,Skywagon,2017-05-13 05:09:00,1106,"Pooch, you need to trade that John Deere off for a new Lund, life would be simpler!Ellen tilled the garden yesterday, would guess soil temperatures are in the low 40's, don't think it's time to plant corn yet. Perfect wood splitting weather, need to get her going on that instead..."
5540625,onetimedave,2017-05-13 05:38:00,502,"We always bring our outfitter a gift. Wine for the lady and brownies from a local bakery along with ""HOLY"" cheese (swiss) for the man. Been doing this for years."
5541153,Camoclad,2017-05-13 10:07:00,628,"My brother is usually in charge of the gift for the outfitter. He makes pottery so he usually brings a piece or two for the owner and our pilot. For us we know it is not required or expected, just a token of appreciation for all the extras and behind the scenes work that make all those trips so amazing!"
5541529,5 of Diamonds,2017-05-13 14:40:00,151,This is the Gospel...
5541593,Bstar,2017-05-13 15:20:00,564,"Skywagon, that's a great idea! We have some of the sweetest sweet corn on earth down here in Indiana. If your in the Dryden- Sioux Lookout area we can drop some off on our way up. We'll be traveling on Aug. 12 to Sioux Lookout."
5534705,pjshorthorn,2017-05-10 09:37:00,5654,"Chuck,What ? What ? WHAT ? Whaaddaya mean that you are not sure you need to know what kind of "" Gord gifts "" are brought each year ? Although I have never partaken in such shenanigans, personally, last year apparently was a banner year for those special gifts at V-Bay Lodge. PjShorthorn"
5534713,Lovetofish,2017-05-10 09:39:00,458,"If it's the right time of the summer we bring fresh sweet corn, cabbage, and tomatoes from Southern Minnesota."
5534729,Ricky Spanish,2017-05-10 09:43:00,1298,"Well, ya gotta have something in the boat to wipe your hands on. Just kidding..."
5534737,pjshorthorn,2017-05-10 09:44:00,5654,Of course there are always a couple of extras that folks apparently sneak in at some point during the week in camp.
5535489,btyreprich,2017-05-10 15:28:00,1067,"I sell professional beauty products and always bring up some of my salesmen samples for our lodge owner Pat. She really enjoys the assorted combs, brushes, lotions, and such that I bring her. I should ask email her before we head up to see if there is anything she needs before we cross the border - good idea. Might be an item or two that is just too hard to get in Ontario."
5535553,Jeler,2017-05-10 15:59:00,92,A large jar of Hot and spicey Dill Pickles and a jar of Lime Pickles! Home made of course and sometimes 1 lb. chubs of sausage!
5535585,Golden Eagle,2017-05-10 16:07:00,2642,I provide them with the best guest they've ever had or ever will have during their years of owning and operating their camp.
5535641,wallydave,2017-05-10 16:44:00,2151,Mike Kansas brought some fresh strawberries to Jim and Jillian at Black Bear Lodge! They loved that! Pooch sent me a link for a Goose Bay Lodge pamphlet from the early Sixties! I bought it and gave it to Andrea at Goose Bay! She loved that too!
5535665,"6'3""",2017-05-10 16:55:00,47,The last couple of years I brought a couple gallons of goats milk as a gift
5535681,Multispecies Guy,2017-05-10 16:58:00,447,"The thought had never crossed my mind. I rarely go to the same place twice so I haven't established the long term relationships with camp owners that other folks have. Might have to think of something for this year's trips. Good ideas that others have had, other than a $200 bottle of Scotch (that I might share some of but won't be giving the whole bottle away)"
5533970,bearfvr13,2017-05-10 05:52:00,174,"Just wondering if anyone takes a gift to their Camp? I usually bring them something,.....it's not that it's wrong if you don't bring them anything,...I just prefer too. Maybe some of you from the north can give us ideas that would be appreciated if we (south of the border) brought as a gift for our camps? I'm not sure I need to know some of the things that y'all bring Gord!!!!!! Some of those things may not be considered ""gifts""!!! Chuck Bearfvr13"
5534010,Wedge,2017-05-10 06:01:00,270,"I always bring Dennis at Pakwash a bottle of his favorite flavor whiskey at the time. I also always call on the way up and ask if they want me to pick up anything at Walmart, The Grocery Store, or anywhere else. A bag of fresh tomatoes has been requested a couple times."
5534145,johnboat,2017-05-10 06:47:00,2014,Yes. A smoked pork loin or a smoker beef brisket. Unless you are undercover border patrol.........then the answer is no. :/
5534177,jveri,2017-05-10 06:50:00,70,We bring up a nice bottle of scotch ($150-200) value for the guy who organizes our trip for all of the leg work he does. We also buy some sweaters/hat/mugs that we give out for biggest pike/walleye for the week. Our group everyone pitches in $10 for biggest walleye and $10 for biggest pike for the week. Winner takes all
5534185,camp chef,2017-05-10 06:51:00,915,We bring 10 year old aged cheddar for all the friends we meet in camp and along the way in.
5534273,SterlingArcher,2017-05-10 07:30:00,92,"We know it's hard to get decent beer in Canada, so our group always brings the camp some good American beer"
5534281,Ricky Spanish,2017-05-10 07:32:00,1298,"We always bring gifts for our friends at the lodge. Last year, my father in law had us bring at least a dozen Bulldawgs for his favorite guide, Miah. He was really blown away, considering how much they can go for in some places. I like to buy a few bulk boxes of 1/8 and 1/4oz jigs and put them in a bunch of smaller jig boxes to hand out. We always bring a bunch of venison sausage and jerky to share. Fred loves a few packs of American cigarettes and everyone loves straight up cash tips. I am never shy about inviting wait staff, housekeeping, cooks, dockhands and other guests to ride along on my bar tab at night. The more the merrier."
5534457,grizzley,2017-05-10 08:42:00,2518,"Little different, but at hunting camp in Maine I used to give the owner of the place we stayed some excellent smoked ring bologna from a local butcher and a wet bottom shoo fly pie. Awhile back they found him laying at the launch having suffered a massive heart attack, hope the ring bologna didn't contribute to that, he sure loved that stuff. RIP Doug RIP; really good guy!"
5534513,mjayn,2017-05-10 08:55:00,1188,"10lbs of Southside(Chicago) fennel sausage for George of Clearwater Lodge(pipestone chain). I don't think he is around any more. Last time i went the portage was raised from $1 to $2, so its been a while."
5534697,Herkyhawk00,2017-05-10 09:37:00,33,Nothing like a black and gold Iowa T-shirt.
