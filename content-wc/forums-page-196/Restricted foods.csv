The funniest experience we had on food items was where we had bought bell peppers at Costco in MN and took them into Canada with no problem. We had a couple left at the end of the trip so decided to take them back with us. At the border in Baudette, we were asked if we had any fruits or vegetables with us. Of course we told them we had some bell peppers left over and that we bought them in the US. We had to throw them out. The peppers were originally grown in Canada, imported to the US for sale, we bought them in the US and took them into Canada without a problem, but had to throw them out coming back into the US.......
