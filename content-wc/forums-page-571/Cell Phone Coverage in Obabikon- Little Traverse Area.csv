1114225,rockpt,2009-06-16 21:04:00,589,"Sprint must have added coverage b/c last year I couldn't even get service at Morson marina. We've had the cell/no cell discussion, LoDo. To each his own. Mine gets left in the truck, don't even bring it into camp. Use the VHF for communication on the water. Alarm clock 1shooter??? I don't use one of those either."
1114322,alanb,2009-06-17 08:16:00,56,"We have found excellent Verizon and Alltel coverage (I believe they share the same network) at the south entrance to Miles Bay (just up from Obabikon Bay) and good coverage at the south end of Smokehouse Island in Miles Bay. We can pick up bars in Bottle Bay and up by Thompson Creek, but cannot connect. We're kind of remote (no electricity) and have rented a sat phone from Outfitters Satellite in the past for our trip for emergency purposes and such. Turn it on once a day for 15 minutes to check for any messages. But next year we will rely on cell phone coverage for the emergency purposes. Just remember to shut it off when your not using it to save the battery life. If you call your cell phone provider, they can add Canada coverage. When you get back, cancel the extra coverage and they will pro-rate the charge accordingly. And if you still have an old school bag phone you will get killer cell phone coverage anywhere. The old analog sets had a lot more power than the modern digital stuff. My wife's uncle-in-law still has his for going to Canada. Alanb"

1114559,bob888,2009-06-18 05:33:00,244,"Thanks everyone for their responses on cell phone coverage. I did check with my provider (verizon) for the international call rate for Canada and my recall was that it around four dollars a month plus 69 cents a minute. I'm primarily interested in coverage in Little Traverse as often during the day will not see a boat in that area. Concerned if I have a boat breakdown.Yes, I do have a Marine Radio with a 6' antenna and also have signal devices including orange flags and flares ( not sure flares are legal in Canada--did not think about it until writing this paragraph).There is a ""Marina"" on the lower end of Alexandria Island in Little Traverse and I would assume that they would monitor Marine Radio--will check with them and what channel they monitor.Since originating this post a friend who was in the middle portion of Little Traverse recently said he got no bars on his verizon cell."
1114991,Obabikon,2009-06-19 13:52:00,2370,I believe the North America plan costs an extra $10 bucks a month. I have that. If you don't have it... Verizon charges .69 per minute.
1113620,bob888,2009-06-15 07:34:00,244,I'm a Verizon wireless customer.Does anyone know if it is possible get a signal in the above listed bays in order to make a cell phone call?Thanks in advance.Bob
1113875,BB3,2009-06-15 20:36:00,48,"Too bad you didn't ask this last Weds or I would have checked for you.I was up in Miles Bay, Obabikon etc.I would think you could, at my cabin in Hanson Bay I have 4-5 bars of signal and obabikon is what-6 or 7 miles? good luck"
1113879,muskyman73,2009-06-15 20:41:00,402,"We stayed at Amasons last year and will be for the next 10 years ! Wahoooo !! Anyways, I work for AT&T and the gsm partnership coverage up there is bad, real bad. No service for AT&T customers, but sprint has coverage in certain areas. Since sprint and verizon are cdma networks, you may have coverage. The best spot was up in the dining area on jareds island of course, because it is higher up and less trees too. Good luck getting service up there. Post a report if you do and how the fishing is. We leave June 26 and I am counting the days. With our Iphone launch coming up, I am gonna need the vacation !"
1113890,aggie kolisnik,2009-06-15 21:19:00,39,We had guests last week that were verizon customers and they got signal fishing right at the mouth of little traverse. they were just out from the camp(Bell Island Outpost) by Mcpherson Island.A.K.
1113943,Obabikon,2009-06-16 06:33:00,2370,"I'm a verizon customer, and I get 3-4 bars almost anywhere I go in the area."
1113944,Obabikon,2009-06-16 06:33:00,2370,"oh, and I own a G'zOne phone... it does seem to make a difference."
1113970,birddogger,2009-06-16 08:06:00,43,"Obabikon Are you picking up a US tower ? If it's a Canadian tower ,the bill will be huge."
1114177,BB3,2009-06-16 18:30:00,48,pretty sure he's getting signal from the Morson tower-
1114197,LoDo,2009-06-16 19:34:00,721,"Not sure about you all, but I go to Canada to get away from the cell phone, as well as the traffic, computers, etc....."
1114222,1shooter,2009-06-16 20:52:00,1493,Just got back from the Miles bay area. I have a BlackBerry with Sprint service and I use it for my alarm clock. I just assumed I did not have coverage but to my suprise one of my kids called and the call came through.
