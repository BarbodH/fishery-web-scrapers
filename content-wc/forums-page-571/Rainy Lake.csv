1115248,rdunk,2009-06-21 07:46:00,20,We always go on north to fish. Always thought it would be nice to fish Rainey Lake. Can someone give some info and names of camps on Rainey lake.
1115267,Guest,2009-06-21 09:38:00,0,"Call me I can get you set up on Rainy Lake, I can save you money. I can set you up with ppl I know and would give a deal, because if you call a lodge or camp out of the blue. They know you want and need a place so they will charge you the most they can but with me, I already have the deals. 807.482.9966"

1112384,Guest,2009-06-09 17:55:00,0,"Does anyone have any info on Rainy Lake, mainly the Red Gut area? Thanks"
1112441,cast_and_blast,2009-06-09 21:26:00,1098,Yep - what kind of info are you looking for? Been there at least once a year for the past 5 years and will be there again the end of June.Scott
1112445,Guest,2009-06-09 21:43:00,0,I have never been north of the scott island complex. I have my wife and kids for a week at the end of June as well. We are staying at the fisheries resort. I fished cormorant and moose a few times each of the last few years and have had success with smallies on rocky points and boulders and pike near cabbage. I assume that Redgut will be similar. I would interested in your suggestions. I would just love to get my three year old son on some simple jigging walleyes.
1112866,Guest,2009-06-11 08:37:00,0,"I should have been more specific on Rainy Lake (Red Gut) conditions. I meant does anyone have any ""current"" condition info. My party has been going to this area (stay at the Fisheries) for the last 10 years. We fish mainly for Pike and Smallies, but appreciate incidental Eyes, some 5 lbs. and larger (largest was 10 lbs. couple of years ago. We will be there the end of June thru July 4. Thanks, Pathfinder"
1112897,Guest,2009-06-11 10:28:00,0,"Red Gut should be very hot next week on bass. The weather has been very cool, but should start to warm by the weekend. The bass are just waiting for the first warm days. You should do well on bass. Our guests are just starting to see the bite and predict it should get much better in the next week or so."
1113235,Guest,2009-06-12 19:22:00,0,Is the water level normal? Where are you located? Pathfinder
1113910,Guest,2009-06-15 22:37:00,0,"Pathfiner....my family and I will be up at the fisheries that same weekend. Just curious as to what to expect out of Redgut? We have come up the past three years but stayed at Island View on the U.S. side. We drifted through the scott island complex one day and then fished cormorant and moose the next two. The Canada side seemed to be more ""fishy"" , more boulders, near cabbage. Would you recomend we fished in Redgut or go south into Seine? What about Swell? I would love to buy you a cold one and pick your a little......"
1114666,Guest,2009-06-18 11:28:00,0,"RL has highwater like last year. All the humps in Red Gut should be hitting by the time you get up here, RG has alot of eater fish. NWB has bigger fish, take a packed lunch there cause you will hardly catch anything smaller the 22inches. Most of the fish are in spots that you wouldn't normally think of, last year we were pulling spinner baits for bass and catching big walleye. Go to this site to see what we were catching and watch episode 3, www.gettinghooked.net"
1115214,Guest,2009-06-20 20:24:00,0,"There are a couple of bays just North of the railroad bridge going into Red Gut that have cabbage/weeds and hold Pike, some eyes and smallies. We also like the West end of Swell bay for good numbers of Pike and smallies (around the islands). We will be in cabin # 5. Come by for additional info. Pathfinder"
1115225,Guest,2009-06-20 21:40:00,0,Thanks Harvey for the info on Rainy. That's a cool website you furnished too. Pathfinder
