1113553,the Sandman,2009-06-14 20:55:00,13,"Just returned this morning. Walleye slow and deeper than I expected. But had one really good night in 20-23 feet of water. Northern were almost non existent. What walleye were caught were on either plain jig head with large minnow or a leech. Been fishing Red Lake for several years, and walleye were below average for this time of year, but still some really nice fish taken. Surface temp was around 50 most places, but this week should see some improvement."

1113647,the Sandman,2009-06-15 08:25:00,13,Which end of the lake are you fishing?
1113691,stevensinks,2009-06-15 10:26:00,330,"We will be fishing the west end, staying at Bow Narrows camp. How about you? We went up there last year. We didnt catch lots of fish but we caught big fish. My wife is going with me this year so we are going later for the warmer weather."
