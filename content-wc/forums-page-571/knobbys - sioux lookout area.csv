Both times we were just upstream from roundhouse on bamaji. On bamaji we mostly jigged for walleyes,trolled for northerns, color didn't matter much so long as it was green. Good points, daily check flights with the consant new groups coming and old going out. however i like a smaller camp slightly more secluded from other groups. Fishing was excellent, however the large body of water made me glad i was with people who had been there before."

Once at Kezik Lake and another time at Fry Lake.On Kezik we found great numbers of Walleye,not huge fish but loads of 16"" - 20"" with a few larger.Northern fishing was pretty good as well with plenty up to about 34"". Fry lake had larger average walleye but lower numbers. Northern fishing was great on Fry when we were there. Lots of 30""- 36"" C+R.Largest was 40"".They have great accomodations and boats & motors. I believe the lake you're talking about is called ""Roadhouse"". Good Luck."

1110572,walleyecetcher,2009-06-03 09:47:00,6,"Fish the windward side of the many small islands where it drops off. Jig and a minnow or slow troll it w/ a crawler harness and get bigger fish. The inlet right by the cabin has some huge pike in it if you can tempt them to bite. Had luck with large swimbaits casting into the rapids and letting is fall back. Caught a 48"" there a few years back."

You'll like the cabin. Caught a ton of walleye, biggest was probably 26 inches. Pike, there are some lunkers in there. Broke off numerous while fishing for walleye. Biggest landed and released was 36 inches. Falls by the cabin are your stanby when you want to just go in and catch a bunch of walleyes in a hurry. First fish we boated was a 28 inch pike, 3 minutes in."
