This is a catch and release Walleye tournament held in Minaki, Ontario, Canada. Last year was a huge success with 48 teams fishing for $30,000 in cash and prizes! This year is shaping up to be even better. With over 50 teams already registered, this tournament is bucking the downward trend of entries that most tournaments appear to be suffering as a result of our economy. In fact we are nearing record entries for this event as the record was 62 teams in 2001. It is with the great support of our sponsors and word of mouth from our participants that continues to drive the success of this event! I am proud to announce that we are now a part of the North West Walleye Trail along with events in Souix Lookout and Dryden, Ontario. The North West Walleye Trail is part of the AIM Sanctioned Series of tournaments that give the best overall angling team from the Trail a chance to compete in the AIM International Championship in Winnibigoshish, Deer River, MN. Much more info can be found at our website: http://www.fishminaki.com There are more spaces available as the team cap for this event is 70 teams. Thank you and have a great fishing season!

Cell phones from carriers such as MTS, Bell and Telus will now have cellular service on the majority of the Winnipeg River System from the Norman Dam in Kenora to the Whitedog Dam.Of course, the use of cell phones during the Minaki Walleye Classic is prohibited unless in the case of an emergency.JP KennedyTournament DirectorMinaki Walleye Classic"
