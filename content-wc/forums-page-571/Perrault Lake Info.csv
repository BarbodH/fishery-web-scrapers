1107103,Kevin R,2009-05-22 06:38:00,305,"Lots of interesting things talked about. Bottom line if you fish the lake any lake odds are better if fish are in the area. 90% of the fish in just about any lake are in 10% of the water. Perrault lake has gone through many changes over the 40 years I have fished it. The lake was crystal clear in the early 70's with large areas of deep weeds 20ft or deeper. You could see your bait 12-20ft down in many areas, now days you are lucky to see your bait 5ft down in the clear areas of the lake. Cedar is the reason it has a bloom in July that flows into Perrault. The changes have changed how the fish feed & where they are in the lake. I have a friend that stopped fishing Cliff Lake in 1969 because fishing declined so much. We went with him to this great flyin lake in 1997 that was just opened, his plane was delayed we arrived early & started fishing thinking we could catch fish by just casting anything anywhere after a couple of hours with little action his plane arrived. We then fished the lake the way we would Perrault Falls area lakes & did about the same as we would on walleye & Pike. The difference was guys that were used to catching very few fish were catching many. One lodge on a 25,000 acre lake makes for easy fishing but you still have to find the fish."
1113062,mpschweiger,2009-06-11 21:22:00,3,"We fished Perrault Lake from 29 May thru the following Friday first week in June. There were still a lot of eyes in the Ord River. We had decent luck each day. Weather was pretty brutal. Coldest I've experienced. We had our limit in three days. The issue was (not that it's bad) was we kept catching 20 plus inchers. My brother in law caught a really nice 28"" near Cedar Lake by the burned out bridge. My brother couldn't seem to catch anything small enough to keep. My group never keeps anything considered trophy size. We also caught a bunch of 12 to 14 inchers. The lake even when we left was still 49 degrees. We also had some really nice eyes on the main lake, and east bay. Buddy caught a 22 incher while bobber fishing for northern in East bay by Spadina. We caught more small mouths last week than the other 4 years combined. Some real toads. All while fishing for eyes. I'm sure there all out of the rivers now and in the main lake on their normal post spawn places. Good luck we had a great time. Mike and Chris at Rocky Shore Lodge are great, and I couldn't recommend them any higher. Northern bite was great as usual also. Biggest ones caught right off the dock at the lodge. Hope this helps. I hear some locals call Perrault the dead sea I hope they don't realize their wrong. This place is getting better and better every year. Let's hope Global warming continues (hahahaha)!!!"
1115107,Kevin R,2009-06-20 06:56:00,305,I think most lakes in Canada have great fishing & keep getting better each year becuase they have changed the limits & other rules( Eagle lake does not allow night fishing) when things were declining. Most camps had a rule in by sunset. But the last 15 years I see more & more people start fishing at sunset on other area lakes. From a safety standpoint it should not be allowed on most lakes. Lakes with launches along the road get more fishing pressure & boats sometimes you can count more than a 100 boats on the water on wabby or perrault that should tell you there must be something to fish for.
1115221,Guest,2009-06-20 21:10:00,0,"Just got back from Rainbow Point Lodge. First time their, but it won't be the last. The lake is about 2 weeks behind ""normal"". Walleyes in the Ord river. However, a weeks worth of perfect vacation weather will be pushing them into the lake. First and Second bay should be tuning up shortly. The week started out rough. New lake, off schedule due to cold weather, no wind, etc. The end of the week saw a distinct turn around. If you are at Rainbow, Bob and George will be happy to put you on fish. There are some big ol' pike in Grassy too. DJ"
565968,bamawallie,2007-06-05 10:07:00,54,Thanks for a most outstanding reply. You are 100% on the money. Would I have liked to do a fly-in to a remote lake as I have done many times in the past....of course but tghis is a family trip. Wife has never done anything like this and it will also be a first for my seven-year old son who we adopted from Russia three years ago. This trip is about being together and enjoying everything Canada has to offer. We'll get plenty of tugs on the fishing line...whatever they are. It doesn't matter.
565974,Guest,2007-06-05 11:46:00,0,Thank you all for the great information. It is tough to hear the negative side of some places. But....as a fisherman I can think of a negative of every place I have ever fished if I so choose to. One more question....Check in at our lodge is actually 3:00 we will be up in that area much earlier. Is there a place to launch our boat at a near by lake to fish awhile or maybe even on that lake? If not we plan on enjoying the area. Thanks again Polareyez
565983,AMPHIB206,2007-06-05 14:41:00,191,"Hi; I used to work at Rainbow Camp in the early 80's. Right across the bay from Rainbow Camp, there is a Boat Launch right on Highway 105. You will see the beach and docks of Rainbow Camp. I used to fish in the evenings from the rocks outside of Cabin #6 (as it was known then), caught bass pike, and walleye; but there were some snags on the rocky bottom. Fish for small perch right off the dock. Perrault is a beautiful lake, no where near as intimidating as Lac Seul. Lots of cedar trees to smell, a camp store within walking distance, a scenic set of falls under Highway 105 that goes into Wabaskang Lake. From a family standpoint you will have fun. A very quiet camp. I can still smell the cedar trees and the campfires that we used to have in the evenings. Other camp guests will be more than happy to put you on fish so your wife and child can enjoy. You will have fun."
565995,Trailerguy,2007-06-05 18:58:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]The public launch for Perrault is on the opposite side of the road from Dutchies store. The public launch for Wabby is in the small park on the left side,follow the road straight in, just after the falls and before Rainbow's driveway. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
566419,Guest,2007-06-19 09:05:00,0,"As a camp owner on Perrault Lake I have seen good and bad days as with any lake. Most of the time the reason people struggle is that they do not listen to the advice we give them. Simple fishing gear is the best ,light line and no leaders or snapswivels. The MNR did a study on a few area lakes and found 14 year classes of walleyes in Perrault,the best in any area lake. As for muskies,try it for your self.We take high 40s and low 50s every year.If you want numbers of muskies go to Fluke Lake,known for numbers but no size. If anybody wants to see current pictures from daily catches stop at any camp. We do not just book new guests,there is a great reason for 65% repeat guests.The only way to find out is to come and learn for your self."

Is there a place to >launch our boat at a near by lake to fish awhile or maybe even >on that lake? If not we plan on enjoying the area. Indeed, Bob and Gayle would most likely be amenable to an early check-in if notification was make. We did so with no problems. It is just hard for them to turn the place over from one week's guests to another without some 'down' time with no guests. We found that if we did not ask for any special attention that they were okay with us being early. That being said, we usually did a bit of exploring around the area so that we could avoid bothering them. There are many side roads with other camp to explore. We went into Ear Falls to look around and give the local businesses a bit of our U.S. money. The tackle shops there are good for some local fishing information, not just for Perrault. This actually helped us later in the week when we knew where to go and what to look for in town. Besides, it was fun to learn more about Canada than just the inside of our boat. If my earlier post seemed like a slam towards Perrault, I am sorry, as I have nothing negative to say. But sometimes the truth is that we Americans go to Canada thinking that fishing means catching whatever we want whenever we want. Disappointment and dissatisfaction with the lake, the lodge, and the entire experience can result. That should not happen if one knows what to expect. I think that it is a great lake to fish, demonstrated by the fact that I enjoyed many repeat trips there. Is it possible that my fishing skills could have been better? Absolutely. Is the lake the best that Canada has to offer? No. But the week fishing on Perrault with Rainbow Point could be the best week of the year. Enjoy your trip. Roy"
574305,Guest,2008-05-25 21:40:00,0,"I've fished Perrault before and will be heading there again this year. Last year we pounded the walleye, caught some nice northern and the bass were downright easy. Keep in mind that this is a fairly Clearwater lake, so light line for the walleye is important and you'll have to work low light conditions for the musky or try a bit deeper than typical. The first year we were there we spent a lot of time, at least half, doing our own survey of likely spots and learning the lake. At this point we have a few spots that are fairly regular producers of walleye and northern, have nabbed a few musky and we've limited out during mayfly hatches. Talk to the people, pay attention to the structure, take some time to learn the water or hire a guide for a day or two and you will catch fish.."
574308,Guest,2008-05-26 06:41:00,0,"Not a slam but I use to fish Perrault years ago when King Johnson use to own Manotak Lodge as well as the Getchen's. In fact one of our guides drown on that lake many years ago as well, his name was Herman. We stopped going to Perrault because the fishing has become slower and there are more camps on the lake then before and the pressure increased beyond our liking. Walleyes can be had if you work for them. We always did well in East Bay and nailed the bass in the shallows or rocky points. We never kept fish but saw that the pressure was getting too much when people were taking limits of northerns that were only 20"" in length and too much pressure hurt the resources. It is a good lake if you like average fishing or are willing to work."
574417,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-05-29 10:32:00,116,"We have fished Perrault a few times, coming from Cedar. On the southeast end there's a spot, it's called whale back or hump back rock. We had very good walleye fishing there. Position yourself between the rock face and the pennisila. Go through the center and watch your depths. If I remember correctly, there's a sucken reef. Also, as someone else stated, try Cedar for a day. It's very easy to get in to. That lake I have fished with my husband for 10 years. Check the map and hit Gull Island at about 7:00 p.m., it was the most consistant spot for us. There is also a public access to Cliff. It is a piece of cake to launch there and is well marked. Good luck fishing and enjoy!"
1106298,team walleye,2009-05-19 16:00:00,336,"I've been fishing Perrault since 2003. We have had very good luck with Walleye and Pike on the lake. Just keep it simple, don't try to get too fancy."
565942,bamawallie,2007-06-04 16:33:00,54,"P.S. So, all of the lodges on the so-called Dead Sea book only new, dumb guests who stupidly read what the lodges say about the fishing and believe it!"
565945,bamawallie,2007-06-04 17:07:00,54,"Why would a ""Dead Sea"" get a lot of fishing pressure?"
565947,Guest,2007-06-04 18:02:00,0,maybe the guys who fish enjoy the nice camps and the friendly people and are happy with average to below average fishing. I have been to perrault and numerous other lakes many many times and perrault ranks up there with hte slowest fishing. you can catch fish but you will have to work and some days you might not get walleys just smallmouth. drive to gullrock-10 times the lake!! The camp we did stay on perrault was very nice though.
565948,bamawallie,2007-06-04 18:23:00,54,"Thanks for your input. Myself, wife, and 7 yeaqr old son will be going to Manotak on June 30. I have no problem working for my fish. I've yet to find a lake yet where I just had to open the tackle box and they jumped into the livewell."
565950,Trailerguy,2007-06-04 19:08:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I wouldn't go so far as to call Perrault a dead sea. No,I've not fished it personally, but I know plenty of folks that do. Why would I take the time to learn to fish Perrault when Wabby is right at the end of my dock? I also think Rainbow Point and Perrault Lake Camp which I'm also familiar with have a good % of return customers. I've seen the ""braging board"" posted at Perrault Lake Camp, (I buy my minnows there), and occasionally seen guests returning with both large fish and nice stringers of fish. I've also noticed that later in the summer thier business appears to slow down, compared to other camps I know locally. But by then they are gearing up for hunting seasons. In my opinion Perrault Lake has less structure that is favorable to walleyes than Wabaskang and some other lakes in the area. Yes, I think looking for Muskies in Perrault or Wabaskang is like looking for ""Nessy"". While technically they exist throughout the Cedar River watershed, they are primarilly found in lakes like Cedar and Cliff. I'm guessing conditions in those lakes are more faverable.

565957,AB,2007-06-04 22:17:00,61,"Bamawallie, This is what the original post asked for: ""I am looking for any and all information on this lake and/or lodge that you might be able to give us. Also if you can give us any pointers on fishing this area and/or this lake that would be great."" I was trying to be helpful and pass along what I know. I gave him the info that I knew of since I've been fishing that area for over 30 years. ""Spotty"" can equal tough to find, hard to find, difficult to find, etc. On any given week on the majority of the lakes in that region according to the pressure, weather, mayfly hatch, etc. the walleye bite can be tough. Sometimes you have to work really hard and travel far for them - like into adjoining lakes. That's not earthshattering news to most but I wanted to pass it along. Good luck to you on your trip. It is a beautiful area that I hope to enjoy for many more years."
565959,jigman 2003,2007-06-05 06:00:00,981,"I didn't see any ""snotty"" or derisive answers to the original question. I can understand being frustrated to hear that the lake you are booked to go on isn't a top notch fishery, I've been there. Good luck and I hope your trip is enjoyable."
565964,v-bay gord,2007-06-05 08:14:00,3168,"So many experts......so many opinions. The majority of lakes in the region have the potential for some great fishing....Perrault lake is one of them. Putting a little effort into learning new waters and honing techniques is difficult for a lot of people....hence the various outcomes and opinions. Have a good trip....you'll meet some great people, catch fish and have fun."
565966,Knutsy,2007-06-05 09:11:00,9,"I have fished Perrault about twenty years, although I have been unable to get there for a few years due to circimstances beyond my control. I have had good years and bad years. It seems like in a four year period I will have two trips with good fishing,one with very good fishing,and one with poor fishing.Even in the good years, most of my walleye were not cought on Perrault, but on the connecting waters i.e. Church,Spidina,Jackfish, and the Ord River. Those areas are a short boat trip. Cedar Lake is also just a little longer boat trip away. In the years when the walleye fishing is tough, the pike and smallmouth fishing have been very good.Take a trip down the Ord River and fish lost lake if you get a chance, if you can get in there with your boat. I have had very good days fishing pike in there, numbers not size. If you can get into Turtle lake a little further down the Ord River, you can catch a lot of perch. I have also done one day fly-ins and they have always been awesome. I will always return to Perrault for a couple of reasons.1) That is where my father took me there and it holds a lot of memories. 2) Bob and Gail at Rainbow Point do an excellent job and yes, they get a lot of repeat business. I have never judged a trip to ontario by the number of fish that I have cought. I go to Ontario to recharge my batteries, which are extremely low right now. Perrault Lake does the trick for me."
565886,Guest,2007-06-03 18:22:00,0,"This will be my/our first time to fish in Canada. I have fished Minn lakes and Devils Lake, ND for many years but have never fished Canada. Let me start by saying I am very excited. When we started to look for a place to go we started looking at Lac Seul but couldn't find what we wanted for the dates we wanted. We ended up booking a place called Rainbow Point lodge on Perrault Lake (close to Lac Seul) and looks pretty nice. I am looking for any and all information on this lake and/or lodge that you might be able to give us. Also if you can give us any pointers on fishing this area and/or this lake that would be great. We are going up there the week of June 16-23 and taking our own 20' boat. Thank you in advance for any and all info. Polareyez"

I've never fished Perault, I have a cottage on Wabaskang, which is downstream of the falls. There are times later in the summer when fishing can get tough on Perrault, it doesn't have the diversity that Wabby has. With a large boat he will probably be sending you to the SE section of the lake. There are plenty of other lakes in the immediate area, and a launch into Lac Suel is just a few miles up the road.

Years ago before cell phones we used to go there and use the public phone. Seem like great folks and a clean neat camp. They have a good swimming area. Lake has been known for spotty Walleye fishing (most lakes are) but offers good smallmouth, perch, pike and muskie from what I know. You should be going at a good time. I'm sure you'll have a great time. Good Luck and give a report when you return."

Opinions are like you know what....everybody has one. Go fish and enjoy."
565910,Guest,2007-06-04 08:52:00,0,Us locals up here call that lake the dead sea! you may catch some walleyes but the lake has alot of access in is fished alot. there much better lakes to fish than perrault that is for sure.
565919,jigman 2003,2007-06-04 10:48:00,981,"I'd interpret spotty walleye fishing as just that. Any drive in lake (with the possible exception of Lac Seul-I don't know) with good access points gets pounded. The fish are there, but you'll have to work for them. You may need to fish low light conditions, or have a good ""walleye chop"" on the water to get them to go. In other words, you will catch fish, but you may need to put in a good amount of time to find the pattern."
565925,Oldschool,2007-06-04 11:49:00,163,"I have fished Perrault many times. I stayed at Rainbow Point for several years running with Bob and Gail. They have a nice operation, and they attempt to make the stay pleasurable. I am sure that you will have a nice week. The fishing can be tough. If you work hard walleyes can be caught, but they are indeed spotty. Last year the smallmouth fishing saw us through the week. It was late summer and the walleyes are scattered be then. I think the muskie fishing in Perrault is pretty a 'Loch Ness' type of fishing. I am sure some are in there as reports have surfaced, but any attempts to find them are fruitless. Northerns are there and can be great fun in the summer; not big numbers, but decent sized and enough to keep it fun. A very nice deep water connection with Cedar lake is only 4-5 miles from the camp and that lake is often better fishing than Perrault. So try it. Look up links to Cedar lake and be prepared to go there. It is a pretty trip as well so that adds to the fun. Go up the Ord river to Lost Lake. It is a smaller lake than Perrault, but has limited access thus better fishing. It is worth the trip if the river has enough water flowing (I know the lakes are down this year, but by the time you go it may be back to normal), Perrault is a very safe lake, easy to navigate, and the far end is no more than 7 miles from Rainbow. The whole lake can be accessed for fishing, so try it all. I am willing to bet that a bite can be found somewhere. Just don't expect full catches every day. Every year we would do a daily fly-in or two to experience 100 fish days. That let us enjoy the tougher Perrault fishing without frustration. And besides, the flying is great fun by itself. Good luck, and I hope you have fun. Roy"
