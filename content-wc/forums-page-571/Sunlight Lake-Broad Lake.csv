Make sure that you hug the east side of the river during that ""S"" turn and trim your motor up. When you get into broad lake there are lots of reeds and cabbage to the right about 500 yards in. We did really well along those reeds once we found the edge. There is an awesome drop off from 6 ft down to about 16. I could keep the bow in 7ft and the stern was in 12' . Jig and a crawler bit or jig and minnow. We only fished broad three days. Every day we averaged over 60 eyes per man and our big fish ALL came out of broad. We also threw some firetiger Husky Jerks when I marked long arches while jigging and caught some dandy pike. Now I am sure that you will have to look around the lake to find fish, but start in semi shallow in the cabbage jigging and then start moving to the deep outside edge. Use your graph and keep moving until you mark fish. Once you find them you will be very impressed. We never went up to Sunshine and never felt like we missed anything."
