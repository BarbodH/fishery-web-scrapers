Water is high, water was 49 degrees at start of week (June 6) and climbed to 56 at end of week (June 12). Very cold spring. Walleye bit was tricky, would gum the leaches at times but caught several large fish in select areas. Northerns were inactive, smallies were big but spotty. You should rip them, eh?Oh ... and how can I forget the great Gulp Leach test? I got onto a good bite down near the English river mouth, then switched to the monsterous sized Gulp leach (4"") and got a couple of pecks, but they would not hold on. I think in an aggressive bite, they would do okay, but they were finicky, those over-grown perch. LOL.P.S. We saw the boats pouring onto the lake for a tournament on Saturday, June 13th. I have a hard time believing that was a great weekend for fishing. Our last two days were very slow. We actually ran down to Red Pine just to catch fish.Good luck. You're hitting it just right, I believe."
1114620,midwest,2009-06-18 09:21:00,25,How does a tournament work there when you can only keep 1 fish over the slot?
1114834,[email protected],2009-06-18 23:31:00,2,"I am just guessing but I saw tournament officials everywhere, so maybe you just flag one and they confirm your fish?I have no idea ...Never fished a walleye tournament, just bass."
1114890,Tony Shirley,2009-06-19 07:21:00,211,"Yes one fish over the slot 3 under catch and kill, over 200 fish a day"
1115328,csnez,2009-06-21 17:54:00,9,"Just returned from 4 days of fishing on Minnitaki. Walleyes were a bit slower than usual this year. Had to work for them. Rice River and English River sanctuaries had just opened on the 15th. Few fish in the Rice this year must have moved out already. Best results were just below the chutes in Abrams. All 7 got to bring home nice limits though and plenty to eat each day. Last night trolling around the Island 3 of the group caught about 25 northerns and 6 walleyes on cranks. 20 of the Northerns brought home for pickeling. Moose and bear tracks on the Island and saw the moose swimming on Wednesday. English Falls area had lots of fish but a small as usual. One in group got a 29 inch walleye at the chutes. Nice traveling fish at the chutes. Tried Lyons Bay for Trout and had a couple of bites in 42 and 65 feet of water. One small walleye taken at Lyons out of 40 feet. Not much happening at the Mineshaft either. Warm calm days for all 4 days we were there. Great trip, good food, good friends and enough fish to keep all happy."
1113657,Guest,2009-06-15 08:45:00,0,"Dear Friends, Going to Minnitaki next week starting 20 June. Was wondering what the lake has been like. Heard from the folks who run our camp that it has been cold and wet. Heard the same from some friends who went to Lac Seul from Hudson in early June. Guess we'll take our cold weather rain gear. We stray at Timber Edge Camp on Butterfly Lake, off of Lyons Bay. Thanks. RSH8"
1113747,Tony Shirley,2009-06-15 13:22:00,211,Awsome fishing lots of numbers .Just got back from a tournament last weekend
1113802,Red Pine J,2009-06-15 17:03:00,44,Love to hear that kind of news. I take it that the water level is quite high..correct???? According to weatherdotcom..........starting this sat. ...till wed. of next week....... tmps should be somewhere about normal I suppose...........highs...upper 60's to mid 70's.....and lows....lower 50's Some more showers predicted.......but I've sure caught lots of fish before ...during.. & after showers on Minnitaki... Hope to seeya on the water RSH8!!!!!!
1113972,Tony Shirley,2009-06-16 08:10:00,211,water is pretty high.It was the first time i fished minnitaki so couldnt really compare but the water comin thru the chute is real fast.
1113985,Guest,2009-06-16 08:44:00,0,"Thanks for the tips. High water means we can get thru the channel from Butterfly into Minnitaki easily. Was wondering how folks fish there in June. We have been going in July and early August, normally fish for walleyes 20 ft deep or more. I presume the walleyes would be shallower and would want slow, shallow-water methods like pitching jigs. Last year was also a very cold wet spring, and the fish required very slow presentations even in mid-July. Caught only two fish bottom bouncing with spinners the first two days, finally quit that and went to jigs. I am also wondering if we can catch shallow fish up there right under or close behind the boat. Around here in Iowa we don't get much if the fish are shallow unless we fish out away from the boat. It's as if the movement of the boat scares the fish. One exception: we can anchor on a known spot and wait a while, eventually the fish will come back, or we attract them in by tossing out and they follow the bait/lure back in. This is a very slow way to cover water. Since we'll have to find new spots, being able to move the boat and still catch fish will be useful."
1113998,Red Pine J,2009-06-16 09:18:00,44,"I'd say you presume right that about the fish being shallow ( less than your 20' in July deal )...l especially this year...given this spings weather conditions so far........only time will tell for sure I suppose. And that time draws near.....so I'd better continue gathering my gear!!!!!!!!!!!..........lol Yes you can & will catch fish right under the boat. My second favorite presentation is drift/vertical jig!!! One of the best tips I received from a guide when first learning Minnitaki was to use a heavy enough jig/bouncer to get bait to bottom with the LEAST amount of line. I'm convinced that boats don't scawre walleyeys on Minnitaki in June!!!!!!!!!!........again....lol Time for some new line on a couple of reels.""catch"" ya next time!!!!!!!! Hope this finds you well!!!!!!!!! R P J"
1114323,Guest,2009-06-17 08:19:00,0,"RSH8 responds, Good to know. Come to think of it, one year we were there in late May, very cold spring, they got 10 inches of snow the week before we were there, and we caught fish in 10 to 15 ft of water near or under the boat. I guess the water is so dark the boat does not disturb them, and the fish see many fewer boats there than they do here in central Iowa. I appreciate the advice. Will let everyone know how we did when we get back next week."
1114337,IaDave,2009-06-17 09:06:00,476,"We stayed at Timber Edge late last August for the first time. Older camp but updates going on,very clean and the folks who run it are very nice even near the end of the season when we were there. I have been to 3 other camps in the area and for what it costs Timber Edge is a great deal. Anyways I see you have been there end of July and early August. We are considering moving our date up to around that time, any tips on finding the fish that time of year. Later we just look for 30' of water and have no problem. Thanks in advance."
1114439,Guest,2009-06-17 15:25:00,0,"dear IAdave, You probably know the lake better than us. Two years when we were there in July we found fish where you are saying - humps on the main lake, 20 ft of water, narrows and passages between various large islands, places where the wind has been blowing onto a shoreline or into/thru a narrows for a day or more. Last year they were not on the main lake humps yet in mid-July. It was hard to move around and find them as they would not hit trolled spinners, even going as slow as possible 0.8 mph. We would go right thru the buggers and no hits. We did get some by vertical jigging very slowly, even then they hit very lightly as it was still early season. Last year was a very cold and wet spring there, they said mid-July was the first sunshine they'd had yet. So i think mornally the fish should be where you say they are in mid-July, maybe not as deep as 30 ft. I agree Timber Edge is a great place. Have not tried other camps, we are very happy there. RSH8"
1114444,IaDave,2009-06-17 15:49:00,476,"The weather this year sounds alot like last year. It sounds like now we are going the last week of August which is fine,less people and I think great fishing for the big ones. That's when we went last year and had great weather along with having bear hunters in camp- They got their bears within 3 days. The owner takes alot of pride in his bear hunts. Post a report when you get back and good fishing."
