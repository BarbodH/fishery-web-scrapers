1111936,Guest,2009-06-08 10:50:00,0,"Was at Gullrock with Tony. Same report. Deffinately a bare jig tipped with a minnow. Our 10 men 2 kid group went through 105 doz minnows. Crawlers did not work----at all. Leaches ok, but not like minnows. There were no leaves on the trees for the first 2-3 days but popped out in a matter of 24 hours. No big ole green reed beds anywhere but I'm sure there will be in the next week or so assuming it warms up. The cold weather was good for one thing. This is the first year I can say I did not get bit by one skeeter-----Not one. I'll go with most of the aforementioned spots for the fast and furious action, but ain't tellin of my best spot without a Texas fifth of Evan Williams showing up at my door. There was a group at camp that has always ran into Red Lake to fish every year, for the last 20 plus years. I visited with them about it and they said the bite was bad on Red Lake so they spent the reminder of the week on Gullrock with much more success. At night and during the ""weather"" the kids (and a few dads) were slammin 18 to 25 inchers right off the docks. The camp where we have always stayed at Five Lakes Lodge looks a great as it ever has. And the hospitality from Everett and Helen is as good as it gets!!! Suggesting Five Lakes Lodge to a friend or family will certinaly make you their friend for life. Keep'er on the bottom John B.O.A.T."
1112549,Guest,2009-06-10 08:16:00,0,"Thank you for the report. Our group has a lot of leeches and crawlers ordered, so I hope the bit changes a bit in that favor, or we will be shelling out more money for the minnows. Did anyone has success with Gulp or with crank baits?"
1112569,Moondog,2009-06-10 09:15:00,362,"It is a great bait when the fish are actively feeding.......3 in. smelt, 3 in. pearl minnow. If the fish are finicky all they want is live bait. I would give you a Gull Rock Report but it has been raining for 2 solid days. Quack Quack. 3 days ago the fish wanted minnows and leeches. In the shallows worms worked great. I caught a 26 on a worm."
1114675,tackleman,2009-06-18 12:13:00,444,"I went out this morning for an hour to the bay where the sanctuary starts.The entire armada was there. when i left after there were 35 boats and passed another 6 heading that way.The water temp was 68 - 70 degrees and the fish were in 6 to 7 feet in the weeds.I got 12 (largest 22"") the rest were 13-18 inches and 1 perch. all released but I talked to a guy on the dock at 5 lakes lodge and he said one of the boats in camp had 3 guys in it and they got 300 yesterday,(that's pretty good fishing).I only saw 1 boat off burnt island and no one anywhere else.with the water warming up they should be on the move to the summer spots soon"
1115142,Guest,2009-06-20 10:16:00,0,"First a report. We just returned and had pretty good fishing at times. Keg and Stone Bay did not produce for us like in the past. Ranger Lake was the best and where there was weeds and wind the fish turned on. Biggest walleye was 25"" and northern was 45"". Now my soap box. There were a few boats fishing northern with frozen shiners on single hook rigs. I hauled in a 43.5"" nothern with a bobber attached to it with the leader going into the stomach and no hook visible. All I could do was cut the leader and hope it lived. There have been many mortality studies done on musky caught on single hooked bait with about only ten percent of the fish living past a year. Please look into quick strike rigs if you plan to fish for northen with live or dead bait and give them a chance to live longer and others have a chance at a trophy. If you do not know what a quick strike rig is, do a search on a musky site or ask and I could also help. KEC."
1109250,Guest,2009-05-29 19:58:00,0,"Was checking out web sites and seen Golden Hook Camp has a photo of a fellow with a 51"" Northern Pike that was released, sure would like to land one like that."
1109567,Fishin Fun,2009-05-31 14:01:00,218,Going to South Bay camp in July. I can't wait. It's been 6 years since I've been there. I have a group of 6 guys and more that want want to go. But I don't have room in the boat!
1109704,Tonyo,2009-06-01 06:14:00,212,"For those of you on your way to Gullrock in the next few weeks, I thought I would give you a little mid week report. We have been here since Saturday afternoon. Weather has been very cool and rainy yesterday. Fishing has been good. Most fish, in our group, have either been caught on a jig and a minnow or a simple Lindy. Weather has been crappy enough we really have not been out too far. Farthest from Camp, Five Lakes, that I have been is to Starrett Straight. Fishing was good with several fish over 20"". Biggest of the week 26"" walleye and 30"" northern. If I have time I will give another update later in the week. TonyO."
1110771,the_bronco,2009-06-03 20:45:00,86,Thanks Tonyo hope your last few days brings better weather and have a safe trip home! I will be up there on the 13th. Jim
1111157,Guest,2009-06-05 09:52:00,0,"It looks really cold in the Gullrock / Red Lake area today. What are the current water temperatures? I am guessing the fish are relatively shallow, but who knows?"
1111159,tackleman,2009-06-05 09:57:00,444,"Ok you asked for it. We got SNOW this morning and right now it is +3 celsius. for june that is really cold.I was out there yesterday for an hour and the water temps were from 49 to 51 degrees depending on the currents. Ie: at the river mouth, where fresh water was coming in it was 49 but near the bays it was 51.I got 2 eaters in 17 feet at the boot and an over size in 11 feet in the river cominginto gullrock.my neighbours brother in law has been getting good numbers of fish in 5 to 8 feet. but one thing for sure is they haven't moved into the summer locations yet ."
1111178,Moondog,2009-06-05 10:38:00,362,"I concur with Tackleman......a very tough week on Gull Rock. The fish are scattered, one day you catch them someplace and the next they are gone. Yesterday we caught very small fish, one nice 18 and a 24 with milk still so???? From my vantage point there are no boats on the Lake today. UGLY. I feel really sorry for the guys that are only here for one week. Weather is supposed to turn tomorrow. What we need is some warm temps to get the water temp up."
1111663,walleyeduran,2009-06-07 11:13:00,286,"Fished Gull Rock last week, and the reports are acurate. Water temp. started out at 46 deg. and warmed to a wopping 49 deg. on the main lake at weeks end. Some of the bays warmed to 54 deg. on a couple of days when the sun came out. Caught a lot of male walleyes in 12-24 feet of water, and some still milking. Had a pretty good day of walley fishing on friday, but getting snowed on the the boat sucks. (My fishing partner commented to me that the last time he was fishing when the temp was 37 deg. that he was ice fishing. I commented back that the last time I was ice fishing the air temp was 45 deg.) Duran"
1111770,Tonyo,2009-06-07 19:30:00,212,"I will confirm everything that has been posted. I am finally back in Missouri and it is currently 82 degrees and very nice. Last week was the coldest week I have had fishing in 12 years of going to Gullrock. But, the fishing was still very good with good numbers of fish and plenty of fish over 20"". We had good luck at Fisherman's Point, The Boot and Starrett Straight (where the river dumps into Gullrock). We also had good luck right at Five Lakes Lodges dock late in the even. Helen and Everett were gracious hosts as always. For those of you still going have a great trip and the count down starts today for next year."
1111895,Blue Fin,2009-06-08 09:08:00,47,"I will also agree with all of the previous posts. It was a really cold week and tough on the hands. But it was worth it. We have never had such a good trip, weather aside. This was our first visit to Gull Rock and we caught almost 200 walleyes over 20 inches in our 8 man group. (I know this because we have a tourney during the week and you get 2 points for every walleye over 20"" and 1 for every pike over 32""). We typically don't use a lot of live bait. In the past, we have used leeches and minnows, but we seem to start the week off on plastics and find that we have about the same luck. But last week, that was not the case. Minnows were outfishing the plastics 5 to 1. Bare jig with no tail tipped with a minnow was the way to go. We had most of our success on the south end of the lake on points. A little luck up at 3 sisters and the boot. Almost all of the fish early in the week were milky and about 25% of them were at the end of the week. Those up there this week and next are going to hit it just right. We mainly walleye fish and the biggest for the week was 27.25 with a 26.25, a 26, and another handfull in the 25's. The only pike over 32 we got was one that grabbed a 13"" walleye being reeled in and we netted both of them. He was a little over 33"". Thanks to all for your responses to some of my previous posts. Hopefully the length of this helps to show my appreciation."
1107126,Guest,2009-05-22 07:46:00,0,"Our group will be at Gullrock beginning June 13th. I was wondering if anyone could report on the water levels and if there were any fishing reports to date. I realize water levels, fishing bite, etc. can change a lot in a couple of weeks, but I am curious. What is going on at Gullrock?"
1107414,the_bronco,2009-05-23 07:02:00,86,They must be all out catching monster walleye Bill
1107422,Moondog,2009-05-23 07:47:00,362,EXACTLY!!! Fish are just starting to come off the spawn and moving around. Don't have time to chat now........bub bye
1107518,Tonyo,2009-05-23 18:24:00,212,I guess I will have to find them myself. We are leaving next thursday for our week. Will start to pack at a blinding pace starting on Monday. TonyO
1107613,Moondog,2009-05-24 07:51:00,362,"Tony O, Yes, you probably will have to find them yourself. Right now the hot bite is in the Chukuni with the armada set up there......lots of boats.....big fish. We have also caught them down by the 3 sisters. They are definitely not on points on the south end of the lake....yet. The water temp is only 44 so some may be spawing still. Things change fast this time of year so I was hesitant to post what we found because that may not be true today."
1107629,the_bronco,2009-05-24 08:52:00,86,Thanks Moondog!
1107691,Tonyo,2009-05-24 14:51:00,212,"Moondog, thanks for the info. The Chukuni is always a good bet this time of year. We usually start their since it is about half way up the lake from Five Lakes Lodge. Glad to hear you are picking some up. I was hoping the water temps would have been a little warmer but maybe they will be up a few more degrees before next weekend. Not really a problem on this lake. It is a great fishery. TonyO"
1107703,the_bronco,2009-05-24 15:46:00,86,"Tonyo, if it isn't to much trouble could you let us know how you did, and any details you would wish to share when you get back? A lot of the fun is finding the fish on your own- but it is always great to hear news about Gullrock! Thanks, Jim"
1107706,the_bronco,2009-05-24 15:47:00,86,I forgot to add that we (pickle and I) will be up there on the 13th
1107809,Tonyo,2009-05-25 06:34:00,212,"Bronco, Not a problem. I will try and give a report mid week while up too. If you are anything like me, you are looking for anything to pass the time before you can leave. I will be on the road on Thursday this week. TonyO"
