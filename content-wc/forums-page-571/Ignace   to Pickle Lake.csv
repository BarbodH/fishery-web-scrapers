1114488,lenray,2009-06-17 18:41:00,467,Was up in that region near the last of May. Never passed a vehicle on the entire trip up to Pickle Lake. Just a few miles from Pickle we came upon about a dozen vehicles all traveling quite slow. I was driving my buds truck pulling three boats on the trailer. Came up behind these folks and would gas it and shoot around a couple then a curve etc. Did this about 4 different times. Kinda tailgating to be able to gas and shoot around them. After passing the last car we came around a curve and an OPP was stopping the traffic and directing the traffic to make a left turn. I asked him if the road was closed as we wanted to continue on straight ahead. He said no you can go ahead---- I am directing traffic for this Funeral procession. Man I sure felt like a small american AZZ. Very sorry to you folks we passed. They didn't have their lights on and they didn't have flags on the cars and not a hearse--as I know one. Never ever would have done that to those folks--if I had known. If any of you reading this---Please know that I am very sorry for the disrespect.

That's life and everyone has been there at one time or another. Even those folks you passed have made errors in their own lives. We are human and prone to learn from experience. Funerals down our way are, like you said, well marked and we all respect that. Most of us probably would have eventually passed thinking there was nothing out of the ordinary going on. Don't beat yourself up over it. Your guilt is your penance. Now, go outside and play! Pooch"
