That morning i caught what for me will most likley be a fish of a lifetime, a 47 1/2 inch Pike. I didnt have a camera but I did have a tape so I took length and gurth measurments and let the fish go. I thought about getting a repo done until I found out that it would cost about the same as another trip to Canada so I didnt do it. This year My sons and my wife gave me a repo of my fish for Fathers day. Life is good."

In your case you were concerned about your families well being and took the initiative to sink your money into them. Now they have returned the favor in kind. See nice guys really do finish first."
