1110249,Weby13,2009-06-02 13:02:00,57,I am heading up to Lac Seul 6-18 thru 6-25-09. We stay at Onaway Lodge near Perrault Falls. We usually go up a week to two weeks earlier! Normally we go to Broad Lk. or Mckenzie Bay for the Walleye. Does anyone think the Walleye will be there that late? If not does anyone have any other areas they would reccomend for walleye? Thanks!!!
1110253,teddi,2009-06-02 13:12:00,349,"the clay banks in mckenzie bay,ghost narrows, sunlight lake,manitoba point,stony point should all be good at that time. maybe south inlet?"
1110267,Guest,2009-06-02 13:34:00,0,"Weby13: Try Windigo point, west and south sides. Look for cabbage weeds starting, you'll find walleyes. Also try the two islands directly south of Manitoba point, south side, this can be a good spot. Straight west from there you'll see a big rock hump with weeds around it, try there too. Good luck! I will be following you the 27th, could you let me know how you do and share some info?"

I will not be up until July 17, already packed and ready to go.If you can hire a guide for a day, a good idea. They will put you on fish and show you the travel routes.Send me a private message, I'll hook you up with one of my maps with spots marked along with travel routes. We Onaway guys need to stick together. LOL"
