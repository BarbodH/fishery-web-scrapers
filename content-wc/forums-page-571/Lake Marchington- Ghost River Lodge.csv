Anyone have a report on how the fishing experience has been this time of year or how it is currently? I hear Walleye, Pike, Lakers, and Small Mouth. No trophy Walleye or Pike though.Any insight would be appreciated."
1112547,Mohleye,2009-06-10 08:08:00,368,"I was there twice many years ago. I don't recall anyone ever mentioning lake trout fishing, although I see their website mentions they have lakers in portage lakes. They may have opened additional lakes they didn't have then. No smallies when we were there either, although smallies seem to be slowly spreading into new areas so I can't comment on that. I like to fish for lakers, so I'm sure I would have tried for them if they'd been available when we were there. We had one incredibly bad week of weather, and fishing to match. The other year we had good numbers and size on walleye."
1112593,Larry Mac,2009-06-10 10:17:00,530,"Hi Mohleye, We have been to Ghost River Lodges many times and it is by far our favorite camp. We have fished there May, June, July, August and September with great success. We are going to be there in August and September of this year. Ghost River with its many lakes has Walleye, Northern, Perch and some Smallmouth. Lake Trout is limited to a portage Lake called Zarn. The owners of the camp will work hard to put you on fish and make your stay a pleasant one. I highly recommend this camp. If you have any questions just send me a PM and I will be happy to help. Have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1112651,Mohleye,2009-06-10 13:51:00,368,"Thanks, Larry. My group is pretty well set, but if we ever decide to make a change, I'd consider Ghost River again. Zarn does ring a bell, although I know I never fished it. Thesenuts, sounds like Larry Mac is your man for the scoop on Ghost river."
1112680,Guest,2009-06-10 15:37:00,0,"I am leaving tomorrow to go to Ghost River Lodges for a week. I've heard that someone caught a 41"" Northern and someone else caught a 30"" Walleye. I'll let you know how it was when I get back on the 22nd."

1112881,Guest,2009-06-11 09:24:00,0,I was at Ghost River Lodge last year in August. The staff and place were excellent and the fishing was good. If you enjoy catching lots of fish take the tunnel into Clamshell lake the Walleye fishing in that lake is great.
1112940,dmw47,2009-06-11 12:34:00,4,"I was in Ghost River for the opening week again this year for the 12th straight year.We had a group of 8 this year< usually we average 6 to 8 in our groups year in and year out.>We stayed in Freds this year, one of our preferred out post cabins. We have stayed in every area there and they all have their pluses and minuses.As far as the camp itself, Darrel and Tena are excellent people and run a pretty tight ship. There is not a lot of hand holding for us as we have been there and pretty much know what is what, although they will always pass along any pertinent info on hotspots< Get Tena to tell ya, Darrel likes to hold back LOL>, and you can get Donny as a guide if you choose< he runs the Sturgeon camp which is part of the ghost River Lodges.>This year and last the water and air temps for the opener were COLD. Fishing at this time of the year is never the same and we LIKE that. We don't like the COLD and North WInd driven rain, sleet and snow,but as Tena says, Ya Gotta be tough , eh?I have personally patched 5 times in 12 years...that means catching Walleye over 27.5 inches/ Northern Pike over 38 inches and Smallmouth over 19 inches. This year the largest Walleye I caught was 26.5 inches and the largest Northern was 38 inches. Several others in our group caught similar Walleyes and the largest fish on the trip was a 41 inch Northern.In the past I have caught a 30 inch Walleye, a 29.5 inch Walleye and several 28's, as well as 44 inch Northern. Others in our group have done similarly. I saw one person I was fishing with at the mouth of the tunnel catch a 29.5 inch Walleye on one cast< with a HUGE Green Bucktail casted into a shallow bay towards the tracks> and than on the very next cast catch a 40 inch Northern by casting straight up the gut into the current from the tunnel on the same lure. Fishing that day was otherwise miserable as the weather was 34 F and sleeting, snowing with a stagnant cold front.As the water temps rise action at the Twin falls will heat up ,as well as at the falls in Singapore. I have actually had times I have caught so many fish that I had to stop and have that illegal beverage in the boat and relax and listen to the sound of nothing while balancing a rod with a jig and NO minnow on it so I would not be disturbed. Man is that a cool feeling, and it does not happen all the time. These past 2 years are a perfect example of tougher fishing and working for your fish. We still had some days of over a 100 fish < our boat w/ 2 men> but we also had days of 25 fish.There are over a dozen different lakes to fish on and some should not be missed. The passage up the north river to Stanzukimi<not correct spelling> is very cool, as well as the tunnel thru to Clamshell. And the portage over to Singapore is not bad and the fishing is usually excellent there.If you want Lake Trout you will have to make a long journey over to Zarn, which entails going thru the tunnel to Clamshell, portaging twice onto Rock lake and than another portage over to Zarn.It takes a Good long while but it is worth doing at least once if you never have. No Walleye on Zarn, strictly Lake Trout and Northern. I see a lot of reports from many of the other areas < Lac Seul, LOTW etc...> but not much on this particular location so that is why I am giving some examples of the type of fish that can be caught here and my expierences...I have also hooked into a Monster Pike here, only to lose it just before my partner could get into the net. As is typical, I was jigging for Walleye's with a ML Rod on 8 lb mono and it did not take much for this fish to snap the line. I had him for over 5 minutes and if I had to guess at its size when it was up to the side of the boat I would say it was plus 50 inches. Certainly the largest fish I have ever hooked. There are some BIG fish to be had on these waters. And no, I don't work for Ghost River--LOL.PM me if you have any more questions.All the best,DMW"
