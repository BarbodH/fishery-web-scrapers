570960,joeman79,2008-01-22 19:30:00,417,"Northern Wilderness Outfitters; Went Last Year to Richardson Lake with Outfitter. Walleye fishing was UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! Northern fishing stunk. Outfitter never did say much. Awesome Aircraft, Food Package very average to below, but I am picky about food, was definetely adequate. Cabin nice. Boats old 14ft but were dry, Motors were good except had for one that the pull start kept hanging up. Our McGyver fixed it. Heard lots of good things about outfitter, but when we got there all they seemed they wanted to do was get us on the plane and when we got back get us off the plane. No help as far as tips, reccomendations, complained about how much stuff we had which was WAY TO MUCH. Never said have a great trip never said Thank You, never asked how we did. Guess they did not like me. Pilots were great and helpful and those Turbo Otters are UNREAL!! I will say when I was setting everything up and calling and bothering them with stupid questions Doug and Mitzie were GREAT help. And Mitzie was sweet when we checked in. Maybe the guys were having a bad day, and I would go back with the outfitter. Have a friend who has been to Wabakimi, Lil Shab, Glitter and Carrilon. All but Carrilon were Awesome, and weather was funky when they were there."

571583,Guest,2008-02-22 10:58:00,0,Please tell me out of all the lakes you have been to....which one had the best walleye and large northern?? I have been to Birch Lake and it was so-so.
571611,Guest,2008-02-23 11:54:00,0,Talked to my buddy and he said that Lil Shab and wabakimi had bigger Walleyes and Northerns but was fishing late July and August.
1114604,boostnut,2009-06-18 08:22:00,9,"Went to Lil Shab last August with NWO. Fishing was good considering the time of year we were there. Walleye were just about non stop. NWO was great, looking into another trip with them for next year. Nice cabin, boats, and excellent plane & pilots. Had a great trip and would head back to the same place if our group size was still 6 people. FYI, no comment on the food package as we took our own in."
1114975,J.Iverson,2009-06-19 12:43:00,64,"My initial reaction 14 years ago was the same as yours with NWO. You caught them on a bad day. Those guys put in 2000 hours in 120 days, I can only imagine how they feel by August. We go every year with them and have got to know Vic, Doug, Mitzie, little Vic, and all the pilots over the years and have found them to be extremely accomodating and friendly. Doug's job is to keep the load down, they are regulated on how much weight they can fly up which is typically 1500lb of fuel and 2000lb of passenger and cargo. I just flew out of Holly Lake yesterday with my wife and daughters and another family, and can tell you I got my butt chewed on the dock again for too much stuff (he was right)-it happens every year. They scramble to get you in the air early to avoid bumpy flights and sickness. I have fished Birch, Wabakimi, Mink,Lil Shab, Tew, Tessup, and now Holly Lake with them. Every couple years we try a different lake, next year we might try Bishop, but after boating 200 walleye a day for 5 days straight on Holly I'd love to return but I am only 1/8 of the vote in our party! I've never had a bad trip, the weather is the only unknown. Vic has been doing this for 40 years and is the type of guy that would give you the shirt off his back. PM me if you have a specific question and I'll do my best to help.JOHN"
1114986,joeman79,2009-06-19 13:22:00,417,"Yeah Doug ripped me a little also when we wheeled our stuff up to the scale. We had way to much gear food and everything else. The next time I go with NWO I will scale back considerably. So far with NWO whats your favorite Lake? I wanna try Granite and Mink for some reason, Holly sounds great too. Glad u had a great trip."
1115024,J.Iverson,2009-06-19 15:31:00,64,"Lil Shab was definately my favorite. I would say now that we bring our 6 and 8 year old daughters I might favor Holly only because it is on a sandy shallow beach and we never had to go farther than a mile from the cabin to catch fish. (A family of 4 with gear in a 6 horse power boat doesn't move too quick). We fished Mink twice and did really well, definately worth a visit."
