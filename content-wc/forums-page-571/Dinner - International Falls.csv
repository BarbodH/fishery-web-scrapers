1112978,dutchboy,2009-06-11 14:36:00,5717,"I'm pretty sure the ""Spot"" has changed hands. Three years ago we ate there and the old owner stopped out and talked to us. Asked all the right questions. Nice guy, completely loaded but it was almost 8:30 at night when we got there! Spot or Chocolate Moose is all I could recommend although I'm sure there are more good restaurants we haven't tried yet."

We ate there and just enjoyed the food and the other patrons!!! Its about a half hour south of International Falls. There's another place down there too call the Bait-n-Bite also had very good food. But as for in International Falls, ate at the Chocolate Moose,, Nice place and food, also ate at Shorelunch cafe a few times it was good when in a hurry.Dad-n-lad"

1112411,JayM5209,2009-06-09 19:15:00,1050,"Shorelunch Cafe, on 53, southside of town. A must stop on our return trip every year. Good food, good service, cheap. I've never done dinner there, but if it's as good as their lunch and breakfast, you'll be satisfied."
1112428,GNO,2009-06-09 20:26:00,153,Barney's beside the movie theater is pretty good. The Chocolate Moose is probably still the best.
1112432,Glenman12,2009-06-09 20:45:00,762,"Shorelunch Cafe, on 53, southside of town."" Breakfast is as good as the Moose?...good eats but on a Friday morning its very crowded..will have to try it out"
1112438,happy,2009-06-09 21:11:00,34,Two years ago we eat supper at Shorelunch Cafe and I had a Hot Beef Sandwich that was as good as I ever eat. But I think they close at 8 PM. 17 more days
1112620,dmw47,2009-06-10 11:32:00,4,"We eat at the Holiday Inn in IH and the food is decent...It is open till 9:00 for dinner and you can get food at the bar.better than the Moose IMO.Best,DMW"
1112681,IaDave,2009-06-10 15:44:00,476,We use to get there Sat. Nite and always ate at the place that had all the Fire Dept stuff-Can't remember the name but they had the best prime rib. I think it got sold or closed up not sure.
1112740,Weby13,2009-06-10 19:08:00,57,The place with all the fire stuff was called The Spot. Everytime we were there the prime rib was excellent! Im not sure if its still open. Last year we ate at the Chocholate Moose and it was good.
1112766,Rayburn36,2009-06-10 21:35:00,17,Guys if you take hwy 11 east past ranier there are several resorts that have great dining. island view and sha sha's are just a few to mention. I live on the canadian side and always dine on the US side. 19th hole has good food also.
1112946,dmw47,2009-06-11 12:52:00,4,"We also used to go to the Spot. The food was good and the beers weer cold. It was sold and the owners who took over tried to break the union pay scale there.It was boycotted by the locals and picketed as well. I H is an ALL union town, which is something I did not know until that happened a few years ago.We learned this from one of the Bartenders at the Holiday Inn where they recommended either the Chocolate Moose or their own dining facilities.This year they got a new Chef at the Holiday Inn and the food was 1st rate.All the best,DMW"
