They recommend 10# or less for open faced spinning and the main deal is that when tying knots the line must be THOROUGHLY wetted and rewetted when retying. They recommend the trilene with 5 wraps. Also, since there is no stretch it is more sensitive but can shap on a sharp hook set. In particular they recommend 6 or 8 # line. Of course your gear should be in good condition. Transition was released for public sale last summer.:cheers:"
547237,Guest,2005-04-24 17:48:00,0,"I used Transition Gold for the 1st time last week and loved the way it came off my spinning reel. Very little memory and no problems whatsoever. My only reservation is that it wasn't particularly strong. I was using 8 lb test and easily broke off a jig in shallow water. I use a palomar knot and was suprised how quickly the line broke(never had that problem w/ P-Line). But I liked it enough to use it more, and I'll be able to tell down the road if it was me and the knot or the line. Overall, I was impressed."
547042,oltim,2005-04-15 20:00:00,10,Has anybody tried this new line on an open face spinning reel/rod? It sounds great from the advertisements but flourocarbon has a bad rap with spinning reels. Also this new product is pricey. I would appreciate feedback from anybody who has used it. Thanx:cheers:
547060,Guest,2005-04-17 06:06:00,0,I haven't been fishing with if yet but I spooled up 8 lb. on one of my spinning reels. The line went on the spool almost as nice as XL and Al Lindner was advertising this line using it on his spinning reels. 34 days to opener!!!!!
547066,robwillfish,2005-04-17 11:21:00,13,I use this line as a leader attached to Power Pro on all of my spinning reels. I have had ZERO problems with line management on my spinning reels since I started using this setup...cold or hot weather. Attach 24 to 36 inches of the Vanish to the Power Pro using a Surgeon's Knot. I have had a spool of Power Pro on my spinning reels for well over a year and a half and it is still holding up great...the leader set up also isn't as expensive as spooling an entire spool with the Vanish...

547077,Guest,2005-04-17 18:50:00,0,"I tried it two summers ago on my trip to Ontario. Brand new when I started the trip. Three days into the trip, my entire spool was frayed!. I re-spooled with Vanish again, same thing two days later. I have switched back to Trilene XL (green), and have often wondered why I tried something else. Even though they are both made by Berkley, they are VERY different. If anything, I would try what the one reponse suggested in tipping with the vanish. I like Al Lindner, but I didn't like the Vanish (unless they have made vast improvements on that line in the last two years). My experience then turned me off so bad, I cannot even try it again."
547078,oltim,2005-04-17 19:01:00,10,Thanx for the response. I presume you have read what the other guys said. Happy beer time. Trout opened here yesterday.
547080,oltim,2005-04-17 19:03:00,10,Thanx for the response. We never run out of beer.
547081,oltim,2005-04-17 19:07:00,10,"I have heard similiar stories but was your line the transition version, ie yellow to clear, out and in water respectively? I am not certain as to how long transition has been on the market but will find out from Berkley. More info later. Have a beer."
547125,Guest,2005-04-19 06:41:00,0,"Hey Pickle, it sounds like your line guides might have some nicks and grooves in them."
547171,Guest,2005-04-20 17:57:00,0,"I thought I maybe had a guide problem too, but I have never had a problem except that particular spool of Vanish. Maybe the new stuff is better. The stuff I used was shredded, and came off in slivers. It was the weirest thing. I have had no problems since switching back to Trilene XL. Have you had good luck with the Vanish?"
547172,Guest,2005-04-20 18:00:00,0,"The stuff I used was clear out of the water as well as in. Perhaps they have improved what they have now. I know when I bought it (two years ago), it was supposed to be the next hot thing on the horizon (it wasn't). But they have a product out by the same name (and same package again), and are advertising the snot out of it. The problem I had must be fixed."
