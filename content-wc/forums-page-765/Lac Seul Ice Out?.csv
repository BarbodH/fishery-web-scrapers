547241,Walleyefisher,2005-04-24 20:50:00,159,Does anyone know if the ice is out on Lac Seul? I'm wondering if it will screw up the spawn and the fishing will suffer. I'll be there May 28th anybody else worried?
547245,Alces,2005-04-25 05:49:00,35,"ice doesn't have anything to do with spawning. Walleye start spawning when the temperature reach beetween 6 and 10 degree Celcius (beetween 48 and 55 fahrenheit I think) . As long as there is ice little doubt that spawning will proceed, water temperture is the main factor with walleye, don't worry"

Perrault Lake, which is as slow as any in the area, was clear by the 22nd. Lac Suel has a lot of different shaped bays and ect. but it should be clear by now too. I was out in the bush Saturday, and saw suckers running up a creek out of a lake and spawning. The walleyes generally spawn right after the sucker run, both are triggered by water temperature."
547247,gus,2005-04-25 07:06:00,17,what is normal ice out for lac seul I thought it was later than this. if the ice is out early would'nt the spawn be early I will also be there on may 28 at whitewing Resort gus
547250,Guest,2005-04-25 07:25:00,0,Ice went out in our cove last evening; it ususlly means ice will be out on main lake as they have always iced out at the same time. This is almost a record for early ice out; usually we ice out about the 8th to 10th of May. Water levels are on the slightly high side of average for this time of year and are rising slowly according to my marker on the beach. Water inflow is strong and will usually increase as the bush thaws and lets water trapped in pockets go. Don't know water temps but we had some warm weather the past couple weeks to speed ice out but rest of week will see cool/cold nights that may form some skim ice. An early spawn would be nice so the big girls can get some relief from fishing pressure and damage as they disperse. Some may not like to see this but that makes it fishing not just catching. I'll try to keep conditions posted best I can as spring progresses.
547287,Guest,2005-04-25 21:00:00,0,we will be there at evergreen on may 28th we are from west virginia.we was wondering if there was anyway that you or patty could set a few of our group up with a 30 min or so plane ride .and if so what will the cost be....looking so forward to getting there ...my email is [email protected] far is your camp from mckenzie bay...thanks in advance tim.
547293,Guest,2005-04-26 05:43:00,0,MacKenzie is far. Probably 25 miles.
547297,Guest,2005-04-26 07:33:00,0,"We run 50 hp motors as std equipment and Mac bay is an easy half hour ride from camp, Early season oppertunities are very plentiful much nearer to camp, but a day or two in Mackenzie can be a great time. Will keep you personally informed on the plane."
