For me and most I know, the lake is primarily an ""eater"" walleye lake. Lots of them, but not too many big ones. The lake is relatively shallow throughout, with deeper areas in the main basin.....but not 100' deep or anything. This is a late meso lake....stained and rocky and shallow. As far as pike fishing, you've got me! I have no idea.....I've only seen some smaller ones hooked.....no monsters. If you and a buddy of yours are game, there is a walleye tournament in June. Pretty low-key, but a good, well run event and lots of fun to be had. One of those events that anyone can win. Here's a link with more info.http://www.geraldtonwalleyeclassic.ca/"
