The lake had a small open spot in the middle, but was mostly ice covered. The wind came up in the AM, around noon we noticed the ice had start to move, by night it was all piled up and the lake had white caps, :). The water level looked higher than last spring, but it's still a month until opener, so who knows how much rain they'll get by then."
