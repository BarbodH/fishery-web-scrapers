Call Larry and Mary Adams...world class service and an excellent value. l-mflyinoutposts.com. We'll be there in 5 weeks. IM if you want some more info. Rob"

Thanks. >Capt. Bob I missed the Grant Trip three years ago. However, the usual crew I go with have been there three times. Here are some fishing reports from Grant from last year...www.l-mflyinoutpost.com is their site. maybe we'll cross paths with you...we're flying out May 21st to Shabumeni Lake. Rob Lake: Grant Dates: 5/14-5/19/04 Group Name: Schinbeckler Guest Comments: Great cabin. Good fishing for bass and northern, lake trout alittle slower but good sized. Appreciate the on time flights. Wonderful trip. Lake: Grant Dates: 5/22-5/30/04 Group Name: Berryman Guest Comments: Great cabin and support from Larry and Mary and rest of the staff. Fishing was spotty based on changing weather. 38 inch pike and 4 3/4 pound small mouth were the biggest. Lake: Grant Dates: 6/4-6/11/04 Group Name: Vuckson Guest Comments: Great cabin, bass are starting up to the beds. Lots of 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 pound smallies, several nice northerns over 36 inches. Saw 1 bear and a moose, lots of eagles. Great trip. L & M are great, be sure to fly with Rosie!!!"

We have caught some really nice lakers in the summer there, but they were deep and more challenging. We had really good success for everything we fished for and top notch service. Hope this helps."
