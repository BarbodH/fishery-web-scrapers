547144,Ohio fisherman,2005-04-19 20:13:00,989,"First summer after marrying my wife, i took her 6 year old son (my stepson) to Canada. Before leaving, wife and I gently primed the boy about the ""milk carton kids"" and explained that there may be some questions but not to worry. He was great and primed for the issue. I took with me: his certified birth certificate, our marriage license, copy of wife's driver's license, certified copy of wife's divorce decree showing that she had custody, wife's certified birth certificate, my driver's license, my certified birth certificate, and a notarized letter from wife authorizing me to take the boy fishing and have a great time at lake xyz from date to date. The customs guys still questioned me extensively. My brother was along and they questioned him too. Then, they extensively questioned my son (i adopted him the next year) and made him very upset. Then, they asked us to pull over for further questioning. They took us inside and asked to take my son away for private questioning. At that point, I became very worried and told them that they could ask him anything they want so long as they do not take him out of my sight. They took him down a long hallway and questioned him at the other end. After a few minutes, they brought him back and said have a nice time on your fishing trip! My son was ok, until we got into the bronco and drove away when he burst into tears. The poor boy was so warped by the incident that he became a fishing guide in alaska and is now 26 years old. Granted, this may save a few stolen children, however, it is very upsetting. BE PREPARED AND BE CAREFUL!!!!"
547151,Gary_IA,2005-04-20 09:04:00,144,"Ohio Fisherman sure came prepared. After my first response I looked up what Iowa requires for a photo id for someone under and over age 18. Look at the link following for particuliars. http://www.dot.state.ia.us/mvd/ods/identity.htm Notice you need a primary identification (certified birth certificate with raised seal for example); proof of social security number, a secondary form of identification (social security card) andparental consent if under age 18. Eight forms of primary identification are listed and over 20 forms of secondary identification. I have read in past posts of hassles when traveling to Canada without a photo id (passport will have photo). I'm just making this comment for those who want to cover all possible travel problems."
547093,Guest,2005-04-18 09:47:00,0,A friend's son is going to Canada with a friend of his and their family. What type of documentation will they need at the border? Passport or just a birth certificate? Letter from both parents? Does anybody have the web address or phone number for Canadian Customs? What documentation is required for the return trip? Thanks! Fritz
547095,Guest,2005-04-18 11:22:00,0,"You need to have the child's birth certificate and a permission/authorization letter signed and dated by both parents. When you go through customs just answer the questions they ask and you will be fine. I wouldn't make it a point to bring up the facts about the child, but still have the proper documentation regardless."
547096,Guest,2005-04-18 11:25:00,0,"Sorry, I misread your post...I thought you were talking about taking someone elses kid across the boarder without their parents being there. All I have ever needed was a valid driver's liscense....just to be safe I would have birth certificates with you though. At this time a passport is not required to enter Canada or the US coming back."
547099,Frankm,2005-04-18 11:35:00,154,"Birth Certificate, permission slip from parent (notarized). You may also want a note, not for the border but for any medical needs the child may need if there is an accident etc. I brought my stepson and had no problems and they did ask to see the paperwork. Even if its your own kid you need the permission slip from the other parent. My stepson went with his buddies dad. We gave all the proper paperwork. He had a harder time getting his own sons into Canada without any paperwork from his wife. They want to make sure a deadbeat parent is not trying to skip town with there kid."
547121,Gary_IA,2005-04-19 05:30:00,144,"A photo identification of the child might be helpful. Passport is best, if not passport the child's school may have a card with photo or go to state driver's license bureau for a photo and identification. I agree with signed notarized permission from parent(s) or guardian(s) who are not traveling with you. The parent or guardian may also wish to grant authority to allow emergency health care."

547124,515,2005-04-19 06:39:00,254,I'm not sure of the cost in the States but a friend of mine in Canada recently had a letter made up by a Lawyer and the cost was only 25 dollars. A small price to pay to avoid any problems and make the crossing simple. Good Luck Mike
