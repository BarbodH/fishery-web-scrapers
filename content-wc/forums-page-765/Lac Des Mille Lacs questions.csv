I've read on the internet that cisco, shiners, whitefish, and perch are the forage species? Are any predominant over the others, especially in June/July? The lake appears to have an immense amount of habitat for walleyes. Is it safe to say walleyes can be found throughout the lake, or do they tend to strongly concentrate in certain sections of the lake? How much weed growth is present? It looks like the water clarity can vary widely? Any advice for catching perch? Looks like a lot of pike are caught in the lake as well. What would be a reasonable approach to finding decent pike in June/July typically? Any thoughts/comments on the above greatly appreciated, especially anything specific to the southwest area of the lake. Thanks to all of you who've answered my previous questions as well, it's been a great help."

The main forage is whitefish and ciscos,but we have the best luck pulling perch colored cranks.A silver shad color frenzy rattler also works well. The water is always a dingy brown so rattles seem to help. Most people use live bait with jigs or spinners,but I usually pull crank baits. They put a slot limit on the lake a few years ago that really helped the size of the fish. Not too many weeds,mostly rock bottom.I have never fished for perch or never seen too many brought to the cleaning house. You can catch the pike while fishing for walleye.The fishing is not like other lakes like farther north,but you usually can catch your limit. I take my wife and kids and it would get pretty expensive at some of the other resorts on a better lake. There are hiden rocks throughout the lake so make sure the resort owner point them out to you on a map before you take off. The lake can turn rough in a hurry so pay attention to the weather and if you see a storm coming,better get of the lake. Good luck and give us a report when you get back."

547236,north_alabama,2005-04-24 16:58:00,172,"Thanks Illinois. We'll be doing our Lake Trout fishing in Baril Lake, just west of Baril Bay. Thanks for the info. What time of year do you usually go up? Despite my handle I'm an Illinois native (Rockford) and we'll be leaving for Canada from my dad's house. I'm thinking we can make it to Thunder Bay in a little under 12 hours, does that sound about right to you? I'll certainly post a report when we get back, but unfortunately it won't be for a couple months."

We take our time and take two days going and coming home. Once we went the middle of Sept.,and it was really nice. The days were alot shorter and you didn't get so wore out. Nothing bets going fishing with friends and family. Have a good time and leave some for me."
547312,Guest,2005-04-26 11:57:00,0,"Thanks again Illinois Trust me, I'll leave plently behind for you. I probably won't catch all that many to begin with, and will likely eat only one or two walleye. Would like to have a nice big perch fry though... I'll be sure and let you know what, when, and how we do."
