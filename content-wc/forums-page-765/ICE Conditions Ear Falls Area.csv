547034,Guest,2005-04-15 09:42:00,0,Fishing Pakwash Lake by Ear Falls 1st week of June. Wondering if anyone knows the ice conditions on area lakes. Live in northern WI and the ice went out about 1 1/2 weeks early here and we had about 40 iches of ice here. Heard Ear Falls area had lots of snow and not much ice this year so it should go out early????? Any predictions?? Last year some posted a link to a web cam in Kenora and Lake of the Woods. Any info appreciated.
547039,Guest,2005-04-15 14:39:00,0,Ice is going out quick in NW ontario...I'd say by Monday (18th) there won't be much left anywhere up there.
547041,Guest,2005-04-15 19:34:00,0,"Pakwash will go out early if this weather keeps up. The rivers are out and the bays are pretty black. Still white in the main part.Ice has melted away from the shore lines. My prediction is at least a week before it goes out. Snow is all but gone, still a few spots in the heavy shade areas in the bush."

547190,Guest,2005-04-21 20:49:00,0,A stong north wind is blowing the ice around in my bay(Goose Bay on Lac Suel) at dusk this evening. It is +5C and I expect it will be gone by tomorrow. I just talked to Tom at the north end of Woman lake he said the ice left his dock this afternoon he expects to make it to down the system to his landing on Saturday.
