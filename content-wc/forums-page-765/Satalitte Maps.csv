547006,Guest,2005-04-14 08:41:00,0,"Google started a new map feature. http://maps.google.com/ You can get good maps, even up in the small towns in Canada. One of the great new features is the Satallite picture option. You can zoom in and see the lakes you fish. I spotted my favorite shore lunch spot on Lac Seul. Unlike mapquest, you can keep your pointer on the map, hold the button, and move the map around. Great feature. I was looking at Lac Seul, and was amazed at how many logging roads that are on the north side of the lake, and how much timber is gone."

Satellite imagery is incredibly useful for giving the reader a visual with more 'context' than traditional paper maps. Until very recently, imagery was very expensive and inaccessible to everyday people, but that is changing. Several places now offer free downloadable imagery. If you have the appropriate software and expertise, there is lots of use for this stuff. With regard to spectral information, imagery collected in the appropriate wavelengths can be used to get an idea of water temperature, turbidity, etc. To maximize use however, you need the imagery to be spatially referenced (i.e., has real-world coordinates attached). When on Lac Seul or wherever, I use GIS software to link the imagery to a GPS system, so you can see an arrow moving around on the imagery. Right now, this is done on a laptop, mounted alongside the depth finder. I have already sent messages to Lowrance urging them to allow their top-end units to display such imagery as the backdrop to the GPS portion of their depth finders (rather than the vector backdrop with black lines marking shorelines as is currently the case with the X-15 or X-19). Whether anyone is paying attention I don't know, but I guarantee you satellite image backdrops are the next step in technology for fishing electronics. As well, I actually have shapefiles (georeferenced lines) for walleye, pike and bass locations which can be loaded on top of the imagery. In the case of Lac Seul these files are based on years of being part of a guide staff, and NO they are not for sale. They are an incredible reference though for discussion amongst guides, training new guides, and providing a more realistic visual of the lake and surrounding landscape. Under forest management guidelines in Ontario, for many lakes including Lac Seul, you can't cut timber from any area that can be seen from any place on the water. Thus, in essence, where the upward slope from the water's edge stops is where the cut will end. Again, this is completed with GIS software and 'viewshed analysis' techniques. In many places, if you look up from the shoreline, you will in fact notice the last trees at the top of the slope have sky behind them. This is because there is no more trees but rather a cut beyond that line. Yes indeed, satellite imagery can show you many things you didn't realize and/or put a new perspective on things."
547031,Guest,2005-04-14 23:30:00,0,I downloaded the trial version. Its cool but most areas are a blur. Especially areas outside the major US cities including all of NW Ontario. Not sure if its worth subscribing to if you cant focus on the areas you want to. Kevin
547102,grt1,2005-04-18 13:55:00,259,"I looked up the lake I live on and was kind of disappointed by the resolution and the clarity of the image, of course I was kind of hoping that the reefs and shallow water would be more visable from the satellite height. It did however give a good overall view and a better understanding of the Island sizes vs a map drawing."
547153,Guest,2005-04-20 10:18:00,0,Is there any way a person could use GPS co-ordinates with this image? Any type of software?
547165,Guest,2005-04-20 14:39:00,0,"If you can state what you want to do, I can probably tell you how to make it possible."
547180,Box,2005-04-21 09:19:00,3219,"NWO Bum, Do you have any recommendations of other, possibly better sites for images? I am thinking right now just for Central MN, where I have a little place. The DNR sat maps is ok. I would also like to try placing GPS coords on it. Do you have links for any sites that might walk me through the steps, or is so kind, provide some basic steps for me to learn how? Thanks! -Boxhttps://www.walleyecentral.com/photop...&ppuser=103808"
547226,Guest,2005-04-24 06:26:00,0,"NWO Fishing Bum, What I wan't to do is move the mouse over a certain spot on the satelitte image and get the GPS co-ordinates. Thanks"
547235,robwillfish,2005-04-24 16:47:00,13,"Go to terraserver.com. I was playing with this site today and as you move the mouse, the lat and long coordinates change. You might check it with your gps before you get in the middle of nowwhere though. Rob"
