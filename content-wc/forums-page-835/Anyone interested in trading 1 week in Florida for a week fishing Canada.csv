536399,Guest,2004-01-08 18:08:00,0,"Tripper, I don't know the last time you tried to book a trip for Lac Seul in June. I tried this year and was told NO WAY. So the idea of trading Peak for Non-peak is a joke! Almost every guy on here is willing to work with people on a trade, but not take it up the @#$. If you can't see that June fishing on Lac Seul is like asking to trade a Vette for a Yugo.....then my friend you are a TRIP!! No where in Kingsway's offer did I see that he was willing to trade peak for peak.....he simply wanted to make a trade that was ""THE BEST DEAL FOR HIM"" this is selfish!! Most guys on WC that make trades, would not have the balls to make a Lopsided trade!! Canadian Lover"
536400,Guest,2004-01-08 18:20:00,0,"Good post Canadian Lover. I make lopsided deals all the time with my brother in law who is unemployed. My wife has a soft spot in her heart for her little brother. I consider it the price of doing business. I usually trade my beer, minnows, gas for his company. The stress of looking for work is great and he needs to unwind. Another two or three years and things might come together."
536401,BanditFisher,2004-01-08 19:00:00,12,One time I traded a used VCR for a Car Battery...... I'm not sure if that was lopsided or not.
536402,Guest,2004-01-08 19:37:00,0,"Hey Canadian Lover. Really detest getting into any kind of flame war, but I have to respond. First of all the guy said he would PREFER Lac Seul. There's probably tons of guys out there who own there own cottage on good walleye lakes who might be interested in trading with the guy. For all we know his place could be a palace. If I were you I'd keep an open mind and don't be so quick to jump down peoples throat."
536443,haybaylarry,2004-01-10 05:24:00,55,"Guys lighten up! Must you always get something ofequal value in return?? Maybe there are people who don't fish constantly who would consider swapping the time frames previously noted. Rich was just looking for different accomodations, a different fishing experience and willing to offer his home in return...Larry"

536452,Guest,2004-01-10 10:26:00,0,Don`t judge all americans by one.Where you not proud of those AMERICANS that pulled sadam`s carcass out of that hole? Be a good neighbor and enjoy a good life.
536488,Guest,2004-01-11 23:37:00,0,Us Canadians are sure gettin a bad rap lol...Tell you what..Any Americans want to come up and ice fish the Red River in the very near future ? Ill guide for free for a couple of days . Its been slow but have managed a few greenbacks in the last few days ..First ones to make it up here .. Contact me for more info thx [email protected]
536340,River_eye,2004-01-06 14:54:00,1486,That's me. Cabin is just above the Pointe du Bois dam.
536341,Guest,2004-01-06 14:58:00,0,"Well, I was offering a nice heated shack for trophy walleye. Next time, post elsewhere. Not all us canadiens are dumb enough to offer prime fishing for a pretty view."
536342,River_eye,2004-01-06 15:07:00,1486,"Kingsway, there is nothing wrong with making an offer of that sort, same way there is nothing wrong with people asking top dollar and then some for an item they placed in the classifieds. The idea is, classified and message board sales and swaps are frequented by people looking for fair trades or bargain deals. So......... although it's perfectly fine to ask top dollar in trade for your place, the unwritten rule is that, you must be prepared to get laughed at until the taker comes along, because most likely there is one out there somwhere."
536344,Guest,2004-01-06 15:26:00,0,"I have reconsidered and I have decided to cancel my original offer to trade vacations. I will spend my money on a charter in Lake Erie with my son and grandson. Then we will catch some nice eyes I won't have to worry about how we will be treated and I won't have to worry about some canuck trashing my home and tossing their empty bottle bass cans on the floor. I guess I'll take the boat out this afternoon and catch some fish. Adious from sunny Florida, temp 85 degrees"
536345,Ivy,2004-01-06 16:06:00,556,A mute point now. But Florida in late April is post Spring Break and isn't as crowded. Ivy
536348,Guest,2004-01-06 17:05:00,0,"A guy can't make an honest attempt at shafting/trading someone for a trip to sunny Florida. Come on what's wrong with you guys, please keep all your ""opinions"" inside. Again Kingsway would not want any ""dirty canuck"" to destroy his beautiful trailer in Florida. So again, what have we learned, 1) Try and make a deal that is ""GOOD FOR ME"" 2) Get ticked off when people start telling you, the deal is un-fair! 3) Insult Canadians by calling them canucks that toss beer bottles! 4) Now go and cry and take a trip to Lake Erie, I hope the ERIE GODS blow you off the lake you bum!! HOW DARE YOU INSULT CANADIANS!! I love the Canadians! PS Kingsway, there is NOTHING LIKE FISHING IN CANADA!!! Canadian Lover"
536349,Guest,2004-01-06 18:10:00,0,"Why didn't you just do this in the first place, instead of making such a silly offer ? Have fun catching walleye WrD"
536359,BanditFisher,2004-01-07 14:38:00,12,"Speaking of Trades, I have a have a Rusty Hook tied to a Stick and a String I'd be willing to trade for a BassPro Champion Rod and Reel. Prefer to send it to a Good Home in Florida. Any Time-Frame available."
536360,Guest,2004-01-07 14:55:00,0,"The Walleye fishing in NW Ontario is prime right now. It will get even better just before ice out. You should have offered to trade your place for a week of icefishing at Prime Time. A lot of the ""shacks"" are beautiful with washrooms and TV. Your little dig on Canadians is humourous. Its good the true you came out before a deal was done. You sound like the typical American that Locals in NW Ontario loathe. Arrogant, cheap and above us."
536391,Guest,2004-01-08 15:36:00,0,"I've been reading this forum for a long time, never posted before but feel compelled to do so now. I saw absolutely NOTHING wrong with the offer made by Kingsway2. Some of you guys are totally juvenile. I'd like to make it clear that I'm Canadian, for what it's worth. The offer was made by the gentleman in good faith, nothing in his posts justified berating him at all. If I was in the position to offer a trade I would. Yes, June is prime fishing time, but then so is May, July, August, Sept., Oct., and November (I think you get the point). I know for a fact my wife wouldn't mind a trip to Florida in June."
536288,Guest,2004-01-03 16:17:00,0,"I would like to trade a week stay in my winter home at Pine Island Florida, (a gulf Coast island near Ft. Myers, Florida)for a great week of fishing in Canada for my son (age 37) and myself (age 60). We would prefer Lac Seul but are open to other possibilities. We have excellent references and would expect the same for someone staying at my home. The time of stay for us would be late June 2004 and the time we have available in Florida would be either mid to late April 2004 or October 2004. Please reply to [email protected] if interested and if you have a web site please include it. Regards, Rich"
536289,Guest,2004-01-03 16:27:00,0,"hi rich ,would not be interested in trade but do have openings on a fly in outpost trip out of armstrong,ontario.20 miles of lake system with no one else there.fished this lake last june and it was awesome.this years trip is june 4-11.myself and long time partner have been doing these trips for 40 years and this is some of the best fishing we have seen.lost some of our group due to job loss.contact [email protected]"
536290,Guest,2004-01-04 00:23:00,0,"You might have some takers if you offered prime time in Florida, like December, January or February to equal the prime time you're requesting on the Canada side."
536293,River_eye,2004-01-04 16:50:00,1486,"I agree, not too many people would be willing to give up their cabin for a week in prime season if they can't go down to florida for the prime season, ie. December to February. And, as a matter of fact, my family does own a nice 4 bedroom cottage on a remote stretch of the winnipeg river with prime fishing."
536296,Guest,2004-01-04 21:04:00,0,"I'd like to trade 1 week in January, ice fishing the red river. In return, 1 week in January fishing bottle bass in Florida. I'll supply the wood for the shack. WrD Hey River_Eye, what part of the Wpg ? You the same guy who workind in Minaki this past summer ?"
536298,Guest,2004-01-05 07:47:00,0,"I made this post with the thought in mind that I would give someone an oppertunity to share our home here in south Florida. I made the offer based on my time frame. If it would be a good fit with someone else that might like to visit Florida, that would be great. My intent was not to take advantage of anyone, nor was it my desire to be ridiculed and put down for an offer to share my home. If it doesn't work for you that is fine it might work for someone else. Thanks, Rich"
536306,Guest,2004-01-05 18:25:00,0,"One of the dangers of posting on this site is people will usually tell it like it is, or how it appears, very little b.s. I have a place on Lac Seul and the week you're requesting is primetime! I wouldn't consider trading nor do I know of anyone who would. You have to realize there's only about 90 days of good weather up there so each day is precious. Remember, you came on a walleye fishing site so the views could be a little slanted."
536333,Guest,2004-01-06 13:29:00,0,Yes my offer to trade is absurd.But so is yours. You are seeking prime for virtually nothing. Trade prime for prime only fair thing to do. WrD

I didn't want to be put down, ridiculed, or debate the merits of the exchange here on this board. If I wanted a public opinion I would have asked for that, but I didn't. So keep your opioions to yourself. Obivously this message wasn't meant for you. As for your coment about me wanting to trade ""virtually nothing"". I would say a home on an island off the Gulf coast of south west Florida isn't exactly, to quote you, ""virtually nothing"". You have no idea what I'm offering. Rich"
