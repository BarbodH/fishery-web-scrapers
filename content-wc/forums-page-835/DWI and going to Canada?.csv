536625,Guest,2004-01-15 11:43:00,0,That's the point. The DUI on the States isn't a felony. Maybe it isn't in Canada either. But maybe it is. Canada is a foreign country with it's own laws. Their laws may be different than US laws. So be it. The nation of Canada does not exist simply to be a neat convenient place for Americans to go visit.

536633,Guest,2004-01-15 16:03:00,0,Ivy...add in the part about the pee wee Hockey fans booing the US National Anthem last year. That will get it fired up real good again. LOL!
536634,Ivy,2004-01-15 16:30:00,556,To some folks Hockey isn't a life and death issue. It's more important than that. I got the fever. Ivy
536635,Atlanta Dave,2004-01-15 16:49:00,323,Jigging Jimmy About your post where one in the group had DUI it sounds like there were a total of at least 6 people maybe more and between all of them I find it hard to believe they couldnt come up with 200 canadian to get the one guy in . Just a thought. Atlanta Dave
536646,PJM,2004-01-15 22:39:00,3516,Canadian Guy I am wonder were phidelt157 was for this discussion. Last years post was a long one
536653,Guest,2004-01-16 07:54:00,0,sometime after you pay the 200 they still won't let you in. we mailed in our paperwork and the 200 and we were refused entry.
536608,Guest,2004-01-15 06:10:00,0,I've been going to Canada for 10 years now and have not been asked once if I have had a DUI. We've been torn down twice as well. The guys in the group I go with have never had a DUI including myself but I guess I don't understand. Do they ask you?
536610,Ivy,2004-01-15 06:46:00,556,It is hit or miss. The same thing happened last year to us. My brother had a D.U.I. 3 years ago and they did not say a thing about it. I had the extra $200 just in case though. Ivy
536611,bigfish1965,2004-01-15 06:54:00,3210,"However, D.A.M.M., DUI is always a felony here. Sometimes crossing the border into the US we get 'Where ya goin'..Okay see ya'..other times we get the Spanish Inquisition."
536612,MK,2004-01-15 06:57:00,322,"In the past few years I think the Canadian customs computers have become much more linked with US databases; thats where they'll catch you. The customs inspections seem to have 3 levels: 1. While you are in your car, they ask you questions about country of origin, length of stay in Canada, destination, alcohol, tobacco and then send you on your way. 2. They ask you questions and either don't like what they hear or maybe they have time for a random search and send you over to the curb for a more thorough inspection. You go inside while they look in your car. Inside they take everybodys ID and check it in the computer. Thats when they'll catch the DUI if you have one. Then there's #3, also known as the rectal exam. They search you top to bottom along with your car. They empty everything out, search everything and leave it a mess on the curb for you to put back together and repack. Sleeping bags were unrolled, bags emptied, rods taken out of the cases, etc. That happened to our group about 10 years ago. They must not have liked something and kept us for two hours. They had to justify the time they spent so they confiscated a Penthouse magazine saying it was pornography and couldn't be brought in to Canada. One guy in the group is now in their computer as a porn smuggler and had his magazine forfeited to the Crown. We still laugh about that one. Last year, we stayed in the van and they looked at everybodys ID but didn't run them on the computer. Sent us on our way in about 30 seconds. The same group of guys."
536616,MTJ,2004-01-15 08:24:00,106,"I'll side with Mr. Peepers and Bigfish1965. The laws in Canada are their laws. We (American Citizens) must obey their laws while visiting their country. We don't have to agree with the laws but must respect them. As for the $200 rehab fee, I don't agree with it and don't believe that if a person is a threat in Canada due to a felony they comitted in USA $200 won't take that threat away. Specifically speaking of the DUI entrance law, I fell it hurts the economy in the tourism areas that US citizens frequent. I understand that US money is not the sole income of businesses in tourism areas, but a dollar is a dollar and each business is trying to make it in thier own way. My point is that for each person turned away either prior to going to Canada or at the border, businesses have to look somewhere else for the possible income they may have made from that person. I feel it keeps good, honest, sportsman from visiting the area and supporting the businesses I also do my business with, which may result in a slightly higer price of services and goods. I do not know where the $200 goes, and really don't care, but I would like to see a portion of it go to the businesses that rely on tourists to make a living. Last but not least; I don't believe that bashing each other on this forum is going to solve anything. To those who feel they must insult someone who has posted their OPINION: if it makes you feel better than all the more power to you. Each of us act and react differently in certain situations and I can respect that, but their is not need to become rude and disrespectful. Go ahead and give it to me, I can take it."
536617,Guest,2004-01-15 08:57:00,0,One of my friends went with a group last year and they were not aware of the DUI problem. When they got to the Border one of the group was not allowed entrance to Canada. This caused a problem for the two guys with him so the three of them stayed in Minnesota and fished. The rest of the group proceeded to their destination in canada. The sad part is that the oputfitter lost around $1500 in revenue from the the three who stayed in Minnesota. When a outfitter has 15 weeks to make it in every year he cant afford to lose guests. Im aware that the DUI boys should have known but the bottom line is the outfitter suffered.
536618,Guest,2004-01-15 09:49:00,0,"To Ivy: I am correcting you, because you are wrong. If you will note, the statement was I enjoy a beer or a drink as much as the next guy. A beer or a drink denotes singular or perhaps I should make it even easier for you to understand. One, (1). The extent of my enjoyment can be the same with one or several. If you want to label me a lush based on that, so be it. I enjoy fishing as much as the next guy, what kind of label do I get for that. Evidently, at some point in time someone laughed at something you said so now you think you're funny. One day when you're not doing your comedy routine, check with the families who've lost someone due to a drunk driver and see if they're laughing. Making light of something as serious as drinking and driving (car or boat)certainly says alot for your credibility."
536620,Guest,2004-01-15 10:35:00,0,"See what you started ""moreyes"". LOL. This is becoming an annual ritual. Sure did start early THIS year!"
536621,Guest,2004-01-15 11:09:00,0,"I'm seen and heard some funny (stupid)things but I was just informed that Ministry of Tourisum just spent 1 million $ to have Conan O'brien come to Toronto to film his show, to promote tourisum and at the border millions in dollars are getting turn back every year. Where is the logic in this? I'd like to know how non residents get charged for impaired (DUI) while they are in Canada?"

536593,Ivy,2004-01-14 15:48:00,556,"> Before you jump all over me it's a well known fact that I enjoy a beer or drink as much as the next guy. > What if the next guy is Otis from Mayberry? Otis was a lush!!! Pardon me for being a smart butt. And I hate to point out the obvious but, if your drinking habits are "" a well known fact"". Aren't you well known for your drinking? And if you are well known for your drinking, aren't you called a lush?? Kind of takes the credibility out of your thread does it not? Correct me if I'm wrong. Cheers, Ivy"
536595,Matches,2004-01-14 16:45:00,236,Otis was a lush?
536597,Guest,2004-01-14 19:21:00,0,"Well there you go Mr. Peepee, you said it yourself, you don't think the the $200.00 is going to stop anyone. Guess what? Your right. If it was for the safety of Bob and Doug McKenzie, they wouldn't let anyone with a record in. Period. I'd be less offended with a law like, that than the present extortion system in place. I don't condone the behavior(DWI), I made my mistake, paid for it and definately learned my lesson. And the not being able to enter a soverign country is a very minute problem in my daily existence. The problem I have is with all the blowhards that either have not been caught yet, casting their stones, or the ones that claim this law is for your safety concerns. I really have no problem with the law, it's a foreign country, just call it what it is. Don't try to paint it up all touchy-feely."
536601,Guest,2004-01-14 21:09:00,0,"Drunks Against Mad Mothers, Thank you so much for sharing your tale of woe. Canada is undoubtedly heartbroken at your decision to boycott their country. Since it was the good ol' U. S. of A. that burdened you with the D.U.I, have you considered boycotting here, too?"
536602,Guest,2004-01-14 21:21:00,0,"Damm....well actually if you have a felony offence on your record, which can be something other than a DUI, then the same hoops and restrictions may apply. Likely though if it is something a little more serious than a DUI they will not even give you the chance at paying the fee to be re-habilitated. Don't look for any deep, meaningful theories on why DUI's are being targeted...they are just easy to find. A money grab....I doubt it....job security...maybe. At least your not being fingerprinted at the border (yet) or being deported to Cuba (a bonus). Don't take it personnally, you're just check mark in the computer."
536603,bigfish1965,2004-01-14 22:29:00,3210,"Holy crap... I know that 99.9% of Americans can understand this, so for the 0.1% who can't, and can somehow still read, here it goes. If you have a felony conviction, you can't come here. If I have a felony conviction, I can't go there. DUI is a felony in Canada. DUI kills more people than guns, BSE, SARS and PMS put together. Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. It is not a right to enter a foreign country, it is a privilege. You expect me to know and obey your laws while I'm in the US, I expect you to know and obey ours while here.It's called courtesy, if you don't have any stay home.IF you find a Canadian in the US breaking the law and being a general doofus, by all means prosecute him. AS a Canadian I don't behave abroad the way I would at home, I behave better."
536606,Ivy,2004-01-15 05:22:00,556,"There I go throwing a label on a guy. And not being very P.C. to boot! I'm bad. Otis was sobriety challenged. Ivy ""If I love to fish. If love is blind. Are fish blind? """
536607,Guest,2004-01-15 05:37:00,0,"whaaaaambulence, way to go using good logical thought and thinking for yourself :) gord-oh, I don't take it personal, infact I don't even lose sleep over it. And finally Bigfish, what you fail to realize is that the majority of americans that have a DUI on their records are convicted of a misdemeanor. There is no felony on my record that I'm aware of. The fact of the matter is that even a couple of years ago, this whole debate was non-existant. I don't think the law is new is it? Maybe I'm wrong? Never heard of it until recently though. Hmmmmmmmmmmm?? Like I said before, I don't have a problem with the rule. I'm sitting here laughing at the thought of becoming ""rehabilitated"" for the paultry fee of $200.00 though. LMAO. Is it spring yet:P????????"
536539,Guest,2004-01-13 14:00:00,0,Why should you need a pardon you didn't do any thing wrong in canada. All a guy from the states wants to do is come up to fish and spend money paid taxes and support thier system.I think in this big p$ssing contest the states got the bigger bladder and laughing all the way to the bank. Lets face it every time a guy gets turned back he just stays at a camp in the states and so does a 100 of his buddies who hear he got turned back the border.
536546,Guest,2004-01-13 15:42:00,0,"Like if a foreign citizen committed a felonious act in his home country, you think it should have no bearing on him entering the US, just because he plans to spend money in the US?"
536548,Guest,2004-01-13 16:46:00,0,Canada takes a tough stance with DUIs as do a lot of other countries. If you don't like our rules or our laws stay home. Our game wardens are also very hard nosed with protecting our fishery. Ignorance of the law is no excuse. You are visiting a foreign country. Show a little respect.
536559,Guest,2004-01-13 19:34:00,0,"boysss! don't get me started on this one I loss a lot of $ because these so called felon were not allowed into Canada and so will the merchants and the people in the town I live in. Because now I don't need to buy any boats and motors and I won't need as much gas and why should I hire more staff there will not be as many people in camp this year.Whoops maybe they don't need as many customs officers or COs (lay Offs)better dig deep in your pocket boys the taxes might go up.By the way I am Canadian and have talked to customs about this matter and all they say is the Americans started it first, well for myself or any of my friends we have never been ask if we had a impaired. How about you? this will be my last post on this subject so stone me good"
536562,Guest,2004-01-13 20:57:00,0,"Tiredofit makes a good point in his (her) inflamitory way. I'm all for protecting citizens from ""undesirables"" crossing the border but really does someone with a dui constitute a threat to Canada. I believe the dui just happens to fall in with a big pile of other more serious infractions that may or may not need to be screened. For the average fisherman just wanting to dip a line it seems like a bit of a screw-ball welcome......just my two cents. From the other side of the border I have heard of people being questioned on whether they had any felonies in their record....they (the US)just haven't been on as big a rampage as the Fort Francis customs people have been in the past. I think their manners have improved over the past year due to some direct heat from tourism people who finally got the ear of the elected officials. In the end the law is the law so I guess we just live with it."
536563,Guest,2004-01-13 21:05:00,0,I heard that if you smoke they wont let you into Canada next year. I guess they think we are a fire hazard. Come to think about it one forest fire caused by a careless smoker would probably cause more damage than all the guys with DUI who like to fish.
536577,Guest,2004-01-14 06:35:00,0,"I can never quite understand this discussion (and it sure does come up often) because, unless I'm mistaken, the same situation applies to Canadians entering the US. Guess it's different if it happens to inconvenience an American who may have screwed up at some point."
536568,Guest,2004-01-14 06:35:00,0,"I can never quite understand this discussion (and it sure does come up often) because, unless I'm mistaken, the same situation applies to Canadians entering the US.

536586,Guest,2004-01-14 11:08:00,0,"Last DUI I got, was still not a felony in the U.S. I would be surprised if the border people turn Canadians away with a DUI. But I maybe wrong, I was once before :=) In all seriousness though, I used to go up there every year. Screwed up, made a mistake that I assure you won't happen again, and am banned from entering the country. The ""official pardon"" thing aside, I won't be coming back until there is a regime change up there and the silly law is repealed or done away with. Face it, it's got nothing to do with safety, soverignty or Canadian national security. It's a profit generator and a rub against foreigners for whatever reasons. NAFTA, whatever. This isn't a poke at the common Canadian citizen, all of em I've met have been great people. Just calling it as I see it. I'm sure we've got our on silly regs too."
536589,Guest,2004-01-14 14:16:00,0,"What am I missing here? Canada is another country and they have their own particular laws, if we want to visit their country we must fall under their scrutiny as to whether they will allow us within their borders. I've followed this subject the last several years and would beg to differ with some who feel that it is not a ""safety"" issue. Ask family members of all those killed or injured by a drunk driver whether it involves safety or not! Obviously, Canada doesn't want people who have shown they will drink and drive, traveling their highways. I don't know how paying a $200 fee is going to change someone's driving habits. There's another thread that goes on every year about ""no alcohol in the boat"" How dare they deprive me of my beer! Once again, that's their law and I'm sure it's for safety reasons. There are areas here in the states with similar laws so that isn't unique to Canada. As the numbers of cars traveling the highways goes up so do the numbers of boats on a lake and increases the odds of accidents happening. Taking the alcohol factor out of it as much as possible, helps keeping the odds to a minimum. I guess what it amounts to is if we won't police ourselves they will. Before you jump all over me, it's a well known fact that I enjoy a beer or drink as much as the next guy, I've just learned there is enough time in the day to do it at home or at the cabin. If you want to drink yourself silly, I could care less. I just don't want to share the highway or lake with you when you're doing it. So I for one don't think these Canadian laws are all bad."
536403,Guest,2004-01-08 19:48:00,0,I am going to Canada next summer and one of the guys thatwants to go has DWI on his record. What does he need to do to get in? Thanks moreyes
536404,bigfish1965,2004-01-08 19:59:00,3210,"Do a search here. It has been discussed many, many times."
536407,PJM,2004-01-08 21:33:00,3516,moreyes What they will do depending on how old it is they will make you buy a permit for like $200.00 at the border to get in. It happened to a friend of mine last year crossing from Minnesota. I think the permit is good for the whole year.......
536454,Guest,2004-01-10 11:46:00,0,LMAO! This usually starts up a little later in the year.

536460,River_eye,2004-01-10 17:05:00,1486,"I think if you apply ahead of time, the same amount of money gives you a permanent pardon, whereas if you just show up at the border and pay, it only pardons you for the year or somthing. A much much better place to find info regarding this would be Canada Customs."

536489,Guest,2004-01-12 05:10:00,0,I also heard that people with DUIs have to take a course prior to coming over. Something like three evenings at a couple of hours per evening on the drinking thing. Thats the only way you get a permenant pardon if you're an average Joe. Our PM can also issue permenant pardons ..these are given to people like your President and most visiting Russian diplomats.
536515,Guest,2004-01-12 18:52:00,0,just helped one of my friends with this last week. go to the closest canadian embassy and ask for a pardon and is usually quite fast at it too.
