Like the Cubs fans say ""Wait till next year"". Joke#2) I'm a Bear fan married to a cheesehead. Talk about mixed marriages. :D"

536455,Guest,2004-01-10 13:21:00,0,Apparently Canada has imposed an importation ban on all Packer clothing. Officials have confirmed that anyone sporting the banned items will be turned back at the border. Some border stores have already offerred to incinerate the offending materials if required. When will the insanity end?

536564,BD,2004-01-13 23:25:00,739,Canada is banning Packer stuff! Not because they have anything against Packer fans but because Minnesota isn't allowing Packer fans back into the States. I here that Michigan will be following Minnesota's lead. Canada is afraid that they will become overrun with cheeseheads. How's that for a fate worse than death? ;)

If at some point they become good teams, I'll be happy for you. Enjoy it while it lasts. For now, suck it up and support what you have. Green Bay is good partly because of our loyal fans. The seats are filled no matter what there record is. Players like that and the organization grows from that. Try it sometime. Untill you do, suck it up and consider yourselves losers as well."

This isn't new, it has been in place for a loooong time. Fa, you know, I am really happy you like your team. I guess just because my team is other than yours I don't see the compelling reason to have to tell everyone else their team sucks. Humble yourself and lose with dignity."
