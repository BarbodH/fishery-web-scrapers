If so, I have fished that lake several times and have done very well on Wallyes with the largest around 8 lbs. Caught plenty of fish and a few Northern Pike. I understand that there are some good large Northerns in the lake. We only fished one end by an access and did not go far from there to find fish."

I think North Star Lodge is the camp on the lake. The locals said bad things about the camp, but good things about the lake. Rented a boat from there and found it to be subpar."

536420,Guest,2004-01-09 08:16:00,0,Is this more of a Walleye factory or Pike House?

536472,Guest,2004-01-11 11:37:00,0,I had heard the same thing also about the fish- dont eat them its a polluted lake. I dont know how long it takes for the clean itself up.
