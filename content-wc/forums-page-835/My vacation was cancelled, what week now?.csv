When does Walleye season open? Is it the 22nd of May of the 29th? Question #2: If you have the choice, what week would you go? May 22nd (assuming walleye is open) or June 5th. NOTE: I actually fish more for pike than walleye. I really like catching the pike (yes I know, they are slimey and kind of stink...but I like catching them none the less). Thanks for you help."
536514,rebelrn2001,2004-01-12 18:46:00,1563,I just got off the phone with Terry at Merkels Camp. He says walleye starts the week before the 22nd (I assume the 15th) so he already had us penciled in for the 22nd. They really are great people there if anyone wants to check them out. http://www.merkelscamp.com/
