The only possible rational is the ""homers"" need to be as big as possible so as to maximize the amount of ""meat"" in the freezer. Just keep the ones you like to eat and in amounts that are reasonable...may not be the limit if you just throw out the freezer burned fillets at the end of the winter anyways. Better yet just eat them when fresh and forget being a fish hog!"
