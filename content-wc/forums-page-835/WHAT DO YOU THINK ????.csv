535922,Guest,2003-12-10 08:54:00,0,Our group has discussed the deposit arrangements and we have decided that we will give the outfitter a deposit when we pay our bill at check out. In reality when we check out and pay our bill in total the initial deposit will still be in effect for next year. Dont think it will bother any of us if the outfitter always has our money in his pocket. Its well worth it to know that our fishing hole is protected every year.
535928,Guest,2003-12-10 12:55:00,0,Its good to hear that you guys got your problem straightened out. I agree with you that the resort owners have more problems with inconsiderate fisherman than we have with resort owners. Several years ago we went to a outpost that when you left you are expected to clean the cabin for the next guys...just like you found it. When we got there the cabin was a total mess. It even had broken windows and some garbage on the floor. They had put garbage bags outside the cabin during the week and the Bears had a nice party. The lodge owner went to the camp with us and he stayed all day cleaning up the mess. We tried to help him but he wouldnt allow it...he said he would get his lb of flesh from the ######## that were there last week. He finally let us help him and he thanked us for our assistance.....Bet those other boys didnt get in next year. When we left it took 6 of us about 1 hour to make the place look like Mom cleaned it....the group before must have been pigs not fisherman.
536301,Guest,2004-01-05 10:53:00,0,"i wouldnt tolerate that at all. i once got in a snit with an owner because he didnt advise us of regulation changes before we booked. then 10 days before our trip he says there was this sudden regulation change. we get up there and lo and behold he's got new size stickers and everything. we'd been up 5 times to his place. true the new regs were needed but when an owner doesnt tell you the truth it's time to move on. what this guy's doing to you is even worse in my opinion. unless you're really stuck on this place look around. i can give you a lodge with some of the greatest walleye around. true, it's in quebec but it's worth the effort. good luck with your group and this lodge owner."
536302,Guest,2004-01-05 10:55:00,0,if quebec is ok let me know.
536493,Guest,2004-01-12 06:12:00,0,Mattice Lake Outfitters run the best operation I have ever seen. They are out of Armstrong. I have been on numerous drive in trips and fly-ins over the last 12 years. Nobody comes close to MLO
535858,Guest,2003-12-06 12:43:00,0,Dont think we will take your suggestion Smoke. Two wrongs have never made a right. Looks like we are in the market for a new outfitter unless we can work something out with the old outfitter. This guy has always been great to us in the past. I hope this was just a mistake in his judgement and he will recognize it and make amends. Like everbody we have a great group of guys and this once a year trip is the only time we all see each other every year. I hope it doesent come down to a situation where we cant keep the group together for this trip.
535877,River_eye,2003-12-07 14:52:00,1486,"I'd say that the first thing to do is to let him know how you feel about it. I have come to learn that resort business is a bit strange in that many things go without being said, and business relationships turn into friendships over time, and there can be misunderstandings where both business and friendship are concerned. If he were to come on here, and explain the situation, no doubt it would sound very different. If he knew that this discussion existed and that you were taking suggestions for other outfitters he would probably change his tune. Let him know that the week that you always reserve is the week that works for your group, and you plan to go on that week whether it is with him or sombody else. If you are worried about your friendly relationship turning sour from you guys going elsewhere, just ask him how to go about making a solid reservation for that week with him in 2005. Depending on how he reacts to that, you will know whether to switch lodges alltogether or just for 2004."
535881,Guest,2003-12-07 20:19:00,0,"Same thing happened to the group I go with. Last year we got bumped from our regular week. Our group had been going to the same place for 28 years. One guy in the group left and started his own group. We got bumped in replace of him. Making a long story short, we left. We went to a different lodge on the same lake. It was the best thing that ever happened to us. Everything from boats to bathrooms were better. We wouldn't go back to the old resort if they gave it to us for free. It was a bad situation that really turned into a great one. Sometimes change is good."
535883,Guest,2003-12-07 21:17:00,0,"I skimmed the posts above so may have missed it. You say you went there for 15 of the last 19 yrs. Did you tell him you werent coming up the years you missed? Did you tell him you were coming up the years you were? Did you do anything different this time around that would have given him reason to think you weren't coming up this next year? If not, then find a different spot. If you only assumed he knew you were coming up, I would side on the resort owners side. Business is business...a bird in the hand...etc."
535889,Guest,2003-12-08 07:58:00,0,"walleye gang, please let us know who this outfitter is so the rest of us also don't get burned. besides, this is one way he might see the light and stop trying to screw the people who put bread on his table."
535893,Guest,2003-12-08 09:02:00,0,***UPDATE*** We have talked to the outfitter and we have agreed with his offer to give us a week that is acceptable to us and he assures us that it will be our week as long as we want it. The week is still in prime fishing time and our entire group is pleased with it. In order to solve the problem we reviewed with him our past loyalty and the $$$$ we have spent with him. It turned out great for everbody. Thanks for all the input from the WC gang.
535907,Guest,2003-12-09 08:44:00,0,"I am not ""the"" resort owner, but I have read all the post. He probably should of been able to work something out with the group. Although, you did not send in a deposit. Every year I have the ""regulars"", they have been coming for years, and have spent lots of money, but they never send the deposit. Most of the time, as an operator you give them ample opportunity to send the deposits. I have groups that send a $100.00 for a cabin, for a week in June. They think it is alright, they have been coming for years. Every year a couple of these groups do not show, mostly for good reasons, but still. As the operator, most of the time you try to be reasonable, and polite. You do not demand deposits, you just hope they will finally send them. All operators are waiting for them as soon as possible, even if they do not tell you that. For example, I have a 40 bed resort and it is near impossible to get a cabin in June or begining of July. Right now I am full for those times, but wait till it comes around. Last year, the third week of June, I had 12 people in camp. Every group that was supposed to be there, has been coming for at least 10 years. Most operator's are working on a 5 month season. We can not afford to lose any cabin, for a week. I am in the same situation now. I have people calling everyday. I have cabins that are ""booked"" but not deposited. What should I do. Many people are hard to get a hold of. But as an operator, of course I will wait, and turn down groups, and wait for my regulars, who I do have friendships with, and lose weeks in the summer. Life as a camp owner, you gotta love it. P.S. you do gotta love it. And to the person that started this post, I am glad it worked out for you, most of the time it always does, and I think it shows that you have alot of class not sharing the name of the resort with us. It is always great to have discussions about issues, but alot people come on here to vent, and trash operators. There is always two sides to every story"
535910,Guest,2003-12-09 09:19:00,0,"Resort Owner, Thanks for your comments. You make a very valid point about deposits. Our Resort Owner has not required a deposit from us for years and in fact when offered he has said not to give him one. After hearing your side of it Im going to review with our group and strongly suggest that we send a deposit in order to demonstrate our good faith and protect both the Resort Owner and us. I have been fishing Canada since 1955 and have only had one bad experience with a Resort Owner and he is out of business now because of his lack of service screw the fisherman attitude. Every other Resort Owner I have used has been super and Im sure that Resort Owners have a lot more trouble with fisherman than we do with the Owners. Thanks again for your comments Walleye Gang"
535911,2 DOGS,2003-12-09 12:13:00,361,"To the resort owner: I agree it is very easy to build friendships with camp owners and I think that is alot of the problem regarding deposits. Because of the friendship the resort owner hesitates to ask for a deposit for next year, not wanting to offend the guest. Many of the guests don't want to be committed (at least monetarily) to next year's vacation that is now 51 weeks away. As you said, you are running a business and as such it would certainly be appropriate for you to go over the rules of reservations and deposits with the guests. Perhaps a thank you note at the end of the season and state your timeframe of say December 1st, reservations cannot be honored without a deposit. I think most guests would understand that if you're going to be doing shows you need to know what dates are available. If you need the deposits to help make improvements for the coming season. Give them a good reason why they should whip out that checkbook right now!"
535918,Guest,2003-12-09 17:09:00,0,"My wife and I have been going to the same place for the last 6 years or so around the end of May/early June. I CONTACT THEM late summer so I don't miss out on my spot. I ASK THEM how much I need to send to get our week, and I send it to them RIGHT AWAY. I have already booked our 'pit stop' in Fort Frances the Friday night before and the 'casino' stop on the Friday night at the end of our week. I think it is great to have a spot to stay that is only about 2 1/2 hrs from camp. We get there at 11 am (check in time) and within 2 hours I am on the water fishing--my wife finishes unpacking. I would think the deposits (minimal cost really) are important to the resort owners. They have to eat and bills to pay too."
535833,2 DOGS,2003-12-04 12:27:00,361,Camp owners have told me it is more difficult to book around holidays for the very reason some of your group can't go during that time frame. How many in the group? Any particular lake or lakes you wish to fish? What general area? Is an outpost absolutely necessary? With a little more information there are probably many on this site who could give you some real good suggestions.
535834,Guest,2003-12-04 12:37:00,0,"You reserved it for next year, before you left? *IF that is the case, the owner made a bad business decision. You are regulars, you had it reserved, the other guys are the ones making the change...IF that is the scenario, they need to be the ones flexible. The resort owner can do this, but if his only reason is to appease this other group, it is a very poor decision on his behalf. He is telling you he likes those other guys better and they are more important to him. What is in it for you? IF, you made firm reservations and guaranteed them with money...then...I'd look and book elsewhere and get my deposit back, because it is apparent you are being treated second in the owner's mind. BUT...if you made no firm reservation, with no deposit, although you have been good customers, you were only dancing, and the other guys whom are apparently good customers also, must have stepped up and made a firm monetary committment. However....... Even if the resort owner had no deposit from you., but did have a reservation for your group... the resort owner should have checked with you to get a monetary confirmation, before giving your time slot to another group. ""IF"" is a key word here. There is no deal until money exchanges hands."
535835,Guest,2003-12-04 12:46:00,0,"Please don't take my response wrong. Your initial post was a little vague on exactly what was said, exchanged, etc....Now, I have read more responses by you: You did make a reservation. He should not cancel you. He should have contacted you and asked if there was a possibility to appease these guys with your kind help. You'd no doubt have given him a deposit to secure your spot. I was in the resort and lodging business for 32 years. You just do NOT do things as your resort owner has done. He basically told you these other guys have more meaning to him. Go elsewhere."
535836,Guest,2003-12-04 13:14:00,0,I agree with TMac...you guys are not being treated with respect in this situation. The Lodge Owner should have contacted you and had your permission to move your date. He showed very poor judgement or NO RESPECT for your business. Find a new outfitter.
535837,Guest,2003-12-04 13:48:00,0,There is 8 in our group and we prefer a outpost camp. We also want to fish Walleye and Ontario or Manitoba would be great. Any suggestions will be considered.
535838,2 DOGS,2003-12-04 17:41:00,361,"Walleye Gang: Here are a couple of websites, one is all the lodges and outposts around Ear Falls, Ont. Which is fairly close to Manitoba. http://ontariossunsetcountry.ca/regi...tbid=7&code=19 this one you can click on the names in green and get directly to their website. The other one is www.justfishontario.com both will allow you to find other places to find some walleye. Good luck!"
535845,Guest,2003-12-04 21:18:00,0,"2 Dogs, Thanks for the info. It will help us find another Walleye Hole."
535848,lobo1,2003-12-04 23:24:00,734,Sorry to hear of your troubles. I've been with a guy for three trips (had a 4th planned and got cancelled due to ice) and it is outstanding. The fishing is unreal both for trophies and numbers and the cabins are all built in the last few years because they are all new camps on lakes that never had camps on them before. You will have the only camp on the lake (we always liked that). We dont go any more because I cant keep a group of 6 (his minimum) together that can book a year ahead of time and come up with the money.http://www.moccasintrailsfishing.com/ Go to the website for the number and call Jack Rezny. If you are going to judge the place on his website dont even bother. Just get the number and call him. IT's not cheap - 1000$ or so per guy but WOW - it's awesome. IF you need more leave me your email. lobo1
535849,Guest,2003-12-05 14:59:00,0,"I think that the guy who runs this outpost is an idiot for moving you without asking. Did you guys tell him you did not want to change your week? If you did and he told you tuff sh----, I would be gone in less than 60 seconds. There are way to many great resorts to visit. Judging by the $$$$ you guys are spending, it is a really inexpensive place, so you may not be able to get a similar remote spot for the same or near the same price. So if cost is a factor, you might be stuck with a very inconsiderate host. TGG"
535852,Guest,2003-12-05 19:02:00,0,"Make him believe you are coming, but find another place, and let him have an open week. cruel, Yes, but it should get your point across!"
535821,Guest,2003-12-04 07:02:00,0,"Our group has been going to a outpost camp for 15 of the last 19 years. This year the owner informed us that he was making us switch our week with another group that has been going longer than our group. The switch puts us on the week of a Holiday which causes several fellows in our group to not be able to attend. This does not seem fair to me that we had no choice in this matter. Our group has spent over $45,000 with this outfitter since we started fishing with him. I realize that the camp is his and he has the right to do what he wants but I would like to hear from the WC gang what their thoughts are in this matter."

535822,2 DOGS,2003-12-04 07:32:00,361,"Did you make a reservation, along with a deposit, for next year ahead of the other group? If you did, I'd try to hold the owner's feet to the fire and make him honor that commitment. Or was it, we've always gone that particular time and just assumed we'd have that week again? You do have a choice, find another outfitter, which quite possibly means going to another lake but sometimes that isn't all bad. The only way to get this guy's attention is to lose the business first before he appreciates the business he had."

535826,Guest,2003-12-04 08:18:00,0,I believe it would be improper for the Outfitter to exchange your dates without your permission. We have a group that go to Canada every year and each one of us make other plans with our families on dates around our fishing trip. Moving you to a Holiday makes it even more difficult. I would make my displeasure loud and clear to the outfitter and if you really want to fish there see if he wont reconsider or try to work a compromise for the future with the group he gave your week.
535827,Guest,2003-12-04 09:38:00,0,I agree with 2 Dogs...did you have a reservation and a deposit put down to hold that week ?? Did you just take it for granted that you would have the same week you always do ?? He is running a business and the first one with cash in hand wins. Anywhere you go there is a chance that another group or someone new will show up on the dates you wanted...reserve and deposit !!! If you did reserve I would call him back and cancel the trip...how much fun is it going to be anyway if the whole group can't go ?? It is still early enough that you could make alternate arragements. Lots of good places to fish with lots of good outfitters.
535828,Guest,2003-12-04 10:19:00,0,"We made our Reservation when we left last year and the Outfitter has NOT required a deposit from us for years. I figure that since we have paid him over $45,000 in the last 17 years that both his and our verbal commitment and annual handshake and hug as we leave should reserve our spot. Most of us on our trip are independent business men and SERVICE is the core of each of our commitments to our customers. That may be the big lump in our throats about this. If you know of a Quality Fishing Outpost please let me know."
535829,Trailerguy,2003-12-04 10:24:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]Seems like the outfitter has forgotten that he is in the accommodation business! I'd find someone who was accommodating. :)
535830,Guest,2003-12-04 11:45:00,0,"I'm curious... What about the group that ""usually"" goes the week he's moving you to??"
535832,Guest,2003-12-04 12:14:00,0,He gave them our week. They have been going longer than we have...but to me its still BS without our permission.
