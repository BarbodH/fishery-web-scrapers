Would like to hear from WC gang about what type of bait or lures and what presentations will be most effective that time of year for Smallmouth and or Walleye. Taking my Grandsons (10-12) with me and need all the help I can get to put them on some fish. Could also use local address of Prozac supply after fishing with grandkids for a week. Thanks, Glenn"

Fishing drops with jigs just heavy enough to get down. I like to use various shades of plastics from black,brown,green color combos 2 to 4 inch length. Have best luck on rocky points or cliffs with good drops. Fish the areas that the wind is blowing into and shaded areas can be good. Check with your outfitter he should have a good supply of maps for you and they are always happy to help put you on fish and tell you the hot bait."
536615,Guest,2004-01-15 07:42:00,0,I fish Rainy every year with two of my friends. We also go in June. One of our favorite baits is crawlers on a 1/8 or 1/4 oz jig. We also fish drops and rocky spots. Some of our best fishing happens on rock piles that are close to shore but still in main lake. We do use plastics in darker colors and once in a while will bounce some crank baits through the rocks and get those Smallies excited. A depth fider is a must and if this is your first time a GPS can save you a lot of time finding yesterdays hotspot.
