536467,Guest,2004-01-11 06:08:00,0,I know some of you that have been around WC for awhile will remember Karl. He was always here to help anyone having questions about the Sioux Lookout area and Lake Minnitaki. He loved fishing Canada more than life itself. He was a well versed and a avid Walleye fisherman always willing to give a tip here and there on technics and hot spots. Karl passed yesterday on Jan.-10th-2004 at 2:13 p.m. I have known and fished with Karl for the passed 10 years at Pickerel Arm Camp. He will be sorely missed. He will live on forever at Lake Minnitaki. Walleye Central has lost a great fisherman and I have lost a great friend. Bo

I have been fortunate enough to fish Minnitaki on a couple of different vacations (all the way from Ohio) and fell in love with the area. My wife caught a 22-1/2"" smallie there a few years back that I am looking at as I type. Once again, my sympathies to you. Willie"
