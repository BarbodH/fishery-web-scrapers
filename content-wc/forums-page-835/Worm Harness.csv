MTJ: Thank you for the response, We will be staying in the Nestor Falls area. I have fished in Indiana all my life(bass/bluegills mostly)but when I went ""up north"",we have been to Ely,MN. 2-3 times I have never been able to figure out how to catch fish up north. I am not sure if it is the species,water,patterns but I always struggled. The techniques mentioned are totally foreign to me so that is why I was asking for a few more details. This is our 1st trip to Canada/LOTW so any advice is very much appreciated. Thanks,hoosier"
536414,Guest,2004-01-09 06:54:00,0,"Hoosier -- I picked up on your thread, and thought I would respond. I have been going to LOTW for a week each summer for the last 4, and will be going again in 2004. I fish out of Witch Bay Camp which is up between Sioux Narrows and Kenora, so up quite a bit past Nestor Falls. However, here is my take on late June Walleye on LOTW. Everything depends upon whether there is an early spring or not. All things be ""usual"", I would expect about half of the walleye population to be out on the main lake structures -- reefs, points, islands, etc. in 15-25' of water, and the other half still associated with more shallow water areas (ie, less than 15'). For the main lake structures, bottom bouncing with worm harnesses and 1 1/2 oz to 2 oz bouncers is a great way to cover large structures to find the active fish. If you have found the active fish, I prefer to slow down and jig them with 1/4 oz to 3/8 oz jigs with 3"" Berkley Powerbait grubs (chartreuse color which is really kind of a brownish color body with a yellow/chartreuse tail)tipped with half a worm. For the shallow fish, we target them when were are smallmouth fishing casting rocky shorelines. Shad raps (SR-5s or SR-7s) in silver w/black back or any color pattern with orange (lots of crawfish on LOTW and the smallies and northern target them) are hard to beat. However, the same jig used for jigging for walleyes is good too. Just cast it up shallow and swim it through the shallow boulders and when you get to the drop off, let the jig drop down out of sight. Often, the walleye will be hanging just off those drops. Good luck."

Good luck. Dave B. Thank you for the response.I have found that people are FAR more willing to share information than at home. I have a couple more questions. Should the bottom bouncer weights(you mentioned 1.5-2oz.)be just enough so you can feel the weight and stay in contact or does the heavier weight help you feel the bite? Do you normally use 1 hook on the bouncer or 2-3 hooks(and why would you choose more than 1) and with the worm harness could you also substitute minnows or leeches on the same rig. My last question is the bouncer rig line(does line color make much difference)lighter or heavier than the main line. I know for example on a carolina rig that we bass fish with the carolina rig line size is smaller than the main line so if you break off you can save part of the rig. Thanks again for the help. hoosier"
536437,Jigger1,2004-01-09 13:03:00,234,"Hoosier - I caught my big eye last year in 27 feet of water using a 1oz bouncer. I spool my reel with 12lb test and don’t think the line color makes a bit of difference. I use a heavier line on the snell as it takes the abuse of hitting bottom, snags and the like. I check the snell after almost every fish to make sure it’s in great shape and will go through six or more a day without thinking. You never know when it time for the fish of a lifetime so why take a chance with a nicked up snell. In some 60 hours of fishing LacSeul last year, I lost one bouncer so that shouldn’t be a problem. You only want the bottom tip of the bouncer touching the bottom so I’m constantly checking to see if I’m in touch with the bottom. If you’re snagging a lot you’re probably dragging and not bouncing. This speaks to the weight question, use whatever weight you need to stay on the bottom for the speed and depth you’re fishing. I prefer to stay as light as possible because those 1.5-2oz bouncers will wear your wrist out in no time. I use 2 hooks for nightcrawlers, 90% of your fish will be hooked on the front hooks, but the back hook has saved me more than once with some nice sized eyes. Whether I’ve been too slow on the trigger or the eyes are hitting light, hook number two has been a eye saver. Single hooks are used often for minnows and would assume leeches as well. Jigger1"
536444,Hawker,2004-01-10 07:11:00,3967,"When you say your going to LOTW in the Nestor Falls area, may I ask what camp you are going to? We have been going to that area for the past eleven years at the end of May and the Walleye bite is usually just starting to get good at that time. We stay at a camp called Young's Wilderness Camp in Stevens Bay about five miles north of Nestor Falls. It's a great fishery, you'll get spoiled with the great fishing and the great people in that area. Have truly enjoyed each and every trip up there and look foreword to making many more in following years. Just curious as to what camp your going to though. Hawker"
536465,Hawker,2004-01-11 04:36:00,3967,"I've seen the signs for Canadain Haven but when I get close to our destination there the blinders go on I guess and havn't really checked out too much in the way of other lodges etc. We bounce over to Crow lake from time to time to play with the lake trout but other than that spend all our time fishing LOYW. Last years low water seemed to change things a tad, but as far as having to venture further out very far to get on fish did not come into play. It just re-located the fish in different spots within the same areas we normaly fish. It seemed to actually make the fishing even better for my part, but then again, I've never found the fishing to be bad there. As far as safety and getting around, most of the lodges will have the known submerged rocks, saddles, ridges and humps marked in one manner or the other for both your safety and to keep their boats from getting torn up. Get with your camp owner or manager on the day you arrive and ask them to actually take you out and show you any and all of the known danger areas and to show you the lay of the land so to speak. The one thing I might suggest you take along is a good handheld GPS cause it sure makes it easier to find your way back to the lodge for meals and bed time. Lots of small islands that look all the same the first time you are there and as you venture out and about, it also makes for a great tool when you find you a honey hole amidst those look alike islands etc. Hope you have a great first trip much like ours was which will get you hooked for life and bring you back time and time again. Watch your speeds as your driving in from the border, treat the local people there with honesty and respect, and be sure to check out the star filled sky at night, it's one you won't see at home. Have fun, catch lots! Hawker"
536469,Guest,2004-01-11 10:23:00,0,"To save time I buy pre tied snells from Cabela's. You can buy them in single, two or three hook styles. I just cut them to the length I want add a few beads and a plastic quick change clevis for the blade. For the weights Cabela's also sells a plasic clevis for the bottom bouncer. Then I use straight wire weights. This hepls the line to slide through the weigh for a better feel and makes it easier to change if you want to go heavier or lighter. Good luck, Brax"
536497,Guest,2004-01-12 11:46:00,0,Hawker: Thank you and good luck to yourself. We are very much looking forward to our first trip. hoosier.
536446,McQ,2004-01-10 07:54:00,615,"Fishing with harnesses and rigs is one of my more favored methods now-a-days. For many years I trolled cranks and jigged for my favorite fish but since the late eighties I can safely say that bouncing has become my go-to method for locating fish. There are many variables when it comes to each of our individual techniques, boat speed and control, rods - reels, line, design of harness, type of bait, etc. I've tried to cover off most of these variables and have set up a group site that contains a library of how-tos on most of the elements. You can get my take on things at http://groups.msn.com/McQonFishing Going to the home page here on WC can also help you discover the pros opinions and advice about how they get things done. Check out the stories written by the guys who have really been there-done that. The wealth of information that exists here on Walleye Central is only a mouse click away. Most of us use the forums extensively and forget that there is so much more to this site."

536353,Guest,2004-01-07 08:57:00,0,Have never fished Walleye with worms. see that a lot of you guys do and would love to hear from you about how to fish them.....What kind of rigs....what kind of water....what time of year....what speed to fish them Thanks in advance
536354,Guest,2004-01-07 09:03:00,0,I fish walleye with a bottom bouncer and a tandem hook worm harness. I have experimented with live worms and plastic. I strickly use plastic now as it does not seem to make a difference because it is a reaction bite at most times. Spring seems to be the best time to use this set up although it is effective all year long. It is the best way ( pulling crankbaits a close second ) to cover water and find the active fish. I fish the Northern Canadian waters.
536356,Gary_IA,2004-01-07 11:29:00,144,"I suggest you go to www.justfishontario.com and click on the link ""Bottom Bouncing A to Z"" Phil really lays the technique out for you. A bottom bouncer is a weight with a wire in it and the snell is typically 36 inches with a worm harness. Bottom bouncing is often used to explore areas of lake more quickly than can be done with a jig. It can be quite productive."
536364,Jigger1,2004-01-07 16:06:00,234,"We fish Lac Seul the last few days of June into the first few days of July and have been doing so for the past four years. I used to exclusively jig, i.e. my handle, and moved almost exclusively to bottom bouncing pulling crawlers on 30-36” tandem hook snells. I make the snells out of 14 or 15lb test and play around with combinations of colors/sizes of beads and blades. 2003 may just have been a good year for volume or may have been the technique, but being the stat geek that I am, I know my productivity went up over 110% and resulted in my largest walleye to date at 29.25 inches. My plan for 2004 is to continue bottom bouncing the majority of the time while fishing Lac Seul. I’ve used crawlers and power worms and both work. As a “not as often as I’d like” fisherman, I prefer live crawlers as it gives you a split second more to set the hook. If you get into a hot bite don’t even bat an eye, switch to power worms and go for it. Good luck – I’ve become a beliver."
536366,nitroman,2004-01-07 21:41:00,368,"i first soak the crawlers in ice water for about 20 min to get them plumped up and wigglin then i tie a bronze #10 aberdeen hook on the line and hook the crawler right thru the tip of his nose and shoot a puff of air in his rear with a worm blower. put a small split shot on just enough to get the crawler to sink slowly to the bottom about 10-15 inches up from the hook. i used this on several points and underwater bridges last year on cedar lake and absoulutly knocked them dead. just cast out and let it sink, give um a second or two when you feel um tapping to get the crawler in their mouth then set the hook"

I don't know anything about Walleyes. Can you give me some details on how to make my own bottom bouncers for LOTW. I would like to try making them myself during the winter if it's not too difficult. Thank from a 1st timer. Hoosier."
536371,Jigger1,2004-01-08 11:13:00,234,"Hoosier - As Gary mentioned above, check out www.justfishontario.com and click on the link ""Bottom Bouncing A to Z"" Phil really lays the technique out for you. You can tie your own snells, and good knot tie book will show you exactly how to do it, or you can cheat. Cabelas has snelled bait leaders pre-made that you can buy. Just go to their site and type in “snell” into the search. You can buy single, double, or triple hook snells. Then: 1. Slide about 5-6 small beads (play around with colors) in front of the hooks 2. Pick your color/size blade with a clevis (I like the quick change variety so you can flip blade colors/sizes if one is hotter than the next) 3. Shorten the snell down to your desired length (I believe theirs come in 72” lengths) 4. Tie a loop into your snell or tie a ball-bearing swivel with solid rings with the fishing knot of your choice and your good to go. 5. Snap it on to a bottom bouncer and go fishing. Good luck!"
