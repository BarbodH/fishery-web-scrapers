It is worth the trip to go up there, lots of lakes to fish, BIG JACKS, lots of walleye, other lakes with lake trout, hope I live long enough, and stay healthy enough to explore the area like i want. You're lucky to be living in an area that has some of the best fishing in all of Canada."
536272,pike nut,2004-01-02 07:30:00,23,I should mention that we are looking for only two investors.

536238,pike nut,2003-12-30 18:35:00,23,"All, I am putting together a group of investors to buy a fly in lodge in Northern manitoba that has world class walleye and trophy pike fishing. I have done a whole lot of due dilligence and found it to be a very good business opportunity. If you are interested please e-mail me @ [email protected]. minimum invetment is $25,000 us dollars. Thanks."
536239,Guest,2003-12-30 18:54:00,0,I always thought that Manitoba had residency requirements for this sort of thing....
536240,pike nut,2003-12-30 19:19:00,23,There are no limits to residency that I know of and I have spoken to Manitoba government already many times about the lease.
536241,Mahumba,2003-12-30 20:37:00,345,You are buying the business but leasing the land? Roger Mayer.
536251,pike nut,2003-12-31 07:24:00,23,There is no deeded land. 99% of the lodges don't own any land. They are given a license to operate and lease from the government for the lakes/land they are operate on.
536257,fishmaster,2003-12-31 14:13:00,209,I hope you look into this all the way. This idea can be a LOT OF WORK and no play for some. I know of people who have run camps here in Wisconsin and they had no time for them selves to fish. Waiting hand and foot for your guests is top priority. Then if you go into with others everyone will have there own idea. Good Luck hope it works
536261,Guest,2003-12-31 18:41:00,0,"I have been fairly successful over a life time. Long ago I coined a name for people I called ""ya-buts"". These were people that when when someone had an idea only came up with reasons we shouldn't or couldn't do it. when my children came into the business it didnt take me long to make the rule that we first find all the reasons we could and should do it, then discuss why we shouldn't do it. I am no way refering to any ones input on this site. Thats why we are on this site. I love hearing everyones input,we learn a lot. You almost got talked into taking night crawlers back to canada after 27 years."
536262,pike nut,2003-12-31 22:25:00,23,"Roger, That is correct. The lodge is on crown land therefore it is not for sale."
536264,hoosiercanadian,2004-01-01 12:17:00,104,"There are probably as many Americans that own tourist camps in Canada as Canadians, pikenut, what area of Northern Manitoba are you looking at, I have a cottage up in the Lynn Lake area of northwestern Manitoba , fabulous area, the fishing up there blows away anything in Ontario, bold statement, but there is drive to fishing in northern Manitoba that exceeds alot of fly in fishing in Ontario, where there are roads of course., i'm sure a fly in in Manitoba would be absolutely incredible."
536265,Northern Manitoban,2004-01-01 13:00:00,195,I too am interested in what Lake you are doing this on?i live in Northern Manitoba and i do allot of fishing all year plus doing some guiding.Hoosier is correct about the fishing in this part of the province.But i have yet to fish the Lynn lake area.
