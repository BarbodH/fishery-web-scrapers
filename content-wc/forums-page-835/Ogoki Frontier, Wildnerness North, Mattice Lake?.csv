536395,Guest,2004-01-08 17:32:00,0,"I have fished Ogoki Reservoir with Mattice Lake Outfitters in the past and it was excellent, unfortunately I can't get my first choice of dates so I'm looking at some others. Anyone have any input on Wilderness North- particularly Whitewater Lodge? Or how about Ogoki Frontier, Mojikit Channel. Ogoki Reservoir with Mattice puts us at the north east end, a fair distance from Mojikit Channel so I'm not sure about the fishing on Mojikit Channel. Any comments. Whitewater Lake scares me a bit because everytime I've been in the area we have had a couple of days of real wind and Ogoki has plenty of sheltered places to fish- even on the windiest of days. What about Whitewater- can you get blown off this lake (so to speak)? Anybody that has been with Wilderness North to Whitewater Lodge what can you tell me about this place and the fishing- and how difficult is it to find fish? Has wind ever been a problem? Thanks for your input."
536409,AL,2004-01-09 05:10:00,89,I also fish Ogoki Reservoir with Mattice Lake Outfitters. Two years ago we went to the channel to fish. The wind was extremely strong that particular day and I wouldn't have wanted to spend more than that day there. I have met Alan and his wife from Wilderness North at a show and have stopped by their outfitter store and spoken with them. Seems like a quality bunch. If I couldn't get my date with Mattice Lake I would opt for these guys myself. What dates are you looking for?

536492,Guest,2004-01-12 06:09:00,0,"I have fished with MLO for 4 years now, and am totally impressed with their operation. Good fishing, quality people, quality accomodations. Wish everyone would run this well. I have a good friend who has fished with Wilderness North for several years now, he is very happy. He has not fished at any of your questioned lakes, however."

I've fished Whitewater several times although not with an outfitter. Paddled the Ogoki river starting the trip in Armstrong and ending at the village of Ogoki. There's a great spot for big pike on the Ogoki river inbetween Whitewater and Whiteclay. It's hard to get to though, there's rapids both above and below that restricts access to boaters (I guess that's why it's good!)"
536545,lobo1,2004-01-13 15:11:00,734,"Looking, I have been to Whitewater with Mattice and as far as their organization, camp, facilities, transportation etc - all top notch. The lake has been fished quite a bit more than I am used to. There are a variety of camps on the lake and a fair amount of boat traffic. I would say ""yes"" you could get blown off the lake. The reason I say this is that we had to travel quite a distance to get on our school of biting fish and struggled a few times to make it back. We had small boats for that lake in my opinion. I saw some boats from another camp (not sure which) that had high HP Honda 4 stk motors and were set up like tourny boats - wouldn't have any fear in these boats. If you fish close to any one of the numerous islands near camp - I suppose you could fish for dinner in just about any weather. The camp attendant is an awesome guy !! I could go on. If you need any more info email me or post again. lobo1"
