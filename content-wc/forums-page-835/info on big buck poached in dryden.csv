535970,Guest,2003-12-15 08:32:00,0,"Bud- Do you have any idea if it was scored?? Also, is the guy in the picture the clown that shot it? If so, they must have confiscated everything (including camaras)."
535978,Guest,2003-12-15 16:54:00,0,Jerk Bait I don't know all the info yet. But I'm trying to get the low down when I find out I'll let you know (the MNR don't let out to much Info)I do know the buck is in dryden at the MNR office I know people that saw it.
535985,Guest,2003-12-16 05:23:00,0,The guy in the picture is a Conservation Officer.
535994,Guest,2003-12-16 09:07:00,0,Here is a picture of the CO with it and the score sheet. http://www.iowawhitetail.com/ubbthre...b=5&o=&fpart=1
536001,Guest,2003-12-16 22:54:00,0,There is a better pic on huntingnet.com
536008,Guest,2003-12-17 08:34:00,0,Hey Powderburn which forum did you find the picture in I checked out the site but couldn't find it.
536032,Guest,2003-12-18 09:57:00,0,"According to the email I received, it scored 199 something. It would have been close to a world record if wasn't missing a matching tine on one of the beams."
536038,Guest,2003-12-18 16:24:00,0,The newspaper clipping I saw said the illegality pertained to legal shooting hours. I think they said it was shot approximately one half hour after legal shooting hours. (Don't know if a spotlight was involved....?) Massive rack!! I saw the picture. Had huge mass at the bases - about like a dang good Bull Elk would have.
536039,Guest,2003-12-18 16:28:00,0,OOOPs... I should have read all the replies...somebody has already posted a link to the photo. SORRY. Uffdah... that is a dandy!
536057,Guest,2003-12-19 11:42:00,0,"In this weeks MN Outdoor News there is an article on this deer by the Ontario columnist, Gord Ellis (I checked ODN website and they don't have it posted). Not a whole lot of info since the CO's are still working on the case, but bascially the deer was shot one hour after shooting time by two men from the states. The two men never recovered the deer and fled for the border. It sounds like the deer was found by local residents. The picture out in the field (at night) is a local guy, not the poacher. The other one is with one of the CO's working on the case. The guy who scored it said it was around 8 years old. No one in the area had ever seen this buck so it makes one wonder what it may have been in it's prime!"
535952,cbprov,2003-12-13 11:54:00,1010,"looking for info on huge buck poached around dryden ont ,it was in paper i missed it"
535953,Trailerguy,2003-12-13 12:15:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]Do you know what paper? There might be something in their archives?
535954,cbprov,2003-12-13 14:18:00,1010,"i found info on it,bow site.com web site go to forums it is in there monster buck but it was poached"
535956,Guest,2003-12-13 16:28:00,0,i think i saw that i think the buck had a bright red nose
535960,Guest,2003-12-14 06:21:00,0,"Saw a couple issues back in the Dryden Observer newspaper a picture of a large moose that had been poached. Looked like a nice one but no record animal. I would also be interested if there is information or a picture of a record whitetail from that area, have heard there are some nice ones but have not seen one to date."
535962,Atlanta Dave,2003-12-14 10:09:00,323,I have a picture of the deer on my email but I dont know how to post it to this board. If you will email me at [email protected] I will forward it to you. Atlanta DAve

535967,Guest,2003-12-14 21:13:00,0,I hunt near where the buck was shot and saw a lot of nice bucks this year but nothing like that buck. tomarrow is the last day of deer season up here and I wish I had another tag I know there's another one like that out there.
535968,Guest,2003-12-15 04:51:00,0,"Bud, Just curious if you hunt from a tree stand, still hunt or otherwise in your area? Also which direction from Dryden was that deer taken? It was a dandy."
535969,Guest,2003-12-15 07:27:00,0,Skylane I hunt from a treestand or ladder stand.I've been told the deer was shot west of Dryden.Being a camp owner up here I deal with the MNR alot and was told by a CO that the deer was poached and shot on land that is owned by a person that works for the MNR
