536439,michric,2004-01-09 17:54:00,46,"Agree with 2 dogs about the flavor. Prefer fresh pike fillet over walleye. A horizontal cut from the dorsal to tail and then a ""fillet"" type cut on the last third of the body each side gets the cleanest cut. I know that there are ways to get more meat from the rib section but on smaller pike it did not seem worth it. On a trip to Ontario last year we enjoyed eating several smaller (18-20 inch) pike per day, especially the ones that were rough hooked. Wish Michigan would have a slot limit on pike."
536441,Esox Warrior,2004-01-09 20:18:00,64,"Not sure if I can explain how to do this (it's easier to watch it done). We fillet the sides off the pike (just like a walleye), remove the ribs and belly meat, and remove the remaining skin. You can feel the y-bones in this piece of meat. ""ROLL"" the knife under to remove these. Cut these boneless pieces about 3/4"" thick (they will be 2 - 4"" long) Deep fry using Cajun Shore Lunch and serve with cocktail sauce. ""Northwoods Shrimp-ies""!!! Just had some the other night, and going out in the morning to catch some more. ""TIP UP""!!!"
536491,Guest,2004-01-12 06:06:00,0,"I bought a video several years ago called ""unzipping your fish"" The guy that did appeared on ""Outdoor Wisconsin"" a few years ago. It is unlike any method I have ever seen. It takes quite a bit of practice, but once you master it you will never fillet another pike the old way. Do a search on Yahoo or Google for ""unzipping your fish"", then ignore all of the porno hits. You'll find the website."
536496,Guest,2004-01-12 09:58:00,0,I think the ND game and fish website has info....pics too. Check it out. Clarkie
536507,Guest,2004-01-12 17:08:00,0,"Several years ago I guided at a large fly-in lodge in Northern Ontario. I can't tell you how many times I served my clients pike side by side with walleye for shore lunch. Not once could anyone tell them apart (other than by the shape of the fillet). Pike are great eating, especially the small ones (2-4lb's)."

536385,bigbo85,2004-01-08 14:10:00,2,does anyone have the pitures and text on how to get boneless filets out of pike? I think it was in the ontario outdoor mag a few years ago ty.
536390,Guest,2004-01-08 14:50:00,0,Why would you want to clean a Pike????
536416,Guest,2004-01-09 07:28:00,0,I dont know if you have ever tried pike from a cold lake(nippising) but if you use that sheet with diagram on how to clean pike (with no bones) Y taken out you would say it tastes just like pikerel. tight lines
536417,Guest,2004-01-09 07:58:00,0,"I have found that if pike are caught and fried up for shore lunch or shortly thereafter, no one can tell the difference between the walleye and the pike. We fish cold deep water in Quebec and I have done this many times to prove a point. I bought a fish cleaning video from Dick's Sporting Goods that shows how to get perfect boneless filets from pike. I'll see if I can find it and give you the info."
536418,Guest,2004-01-09 08:00:00,0,The only way that Pike tastes like Walleye is after a case and a half of Bud topped of with three fingers of Canadian Mist.
536425,2 DOGS,2004-01-09 10:10:00,361,"I've seen several published articles on the ""how to"" of boneless pike fillets and it is quite easy. I almost hesitate to say this but, pike about 4 lbs, taken out of cold water and NOT been laying up in a warm water weed bed, taste better to me than walleye. When we do a ""fry"" and have both species prepared, the pike will disappear first! Honestly, I don't like to mess with the ""slimers"" either in the boat or cleaning them. They sure make for a tasty shore lunch."
536426,Guest,2004-01-09 10:15:00,0,I don't know about anybody else but a Walleye filet sounds good about now. Since it's January and I'm freezing my Butt off here in Chicago anticipating the All-Canada show this evening. Got major cabin fever.
536433,woods,2004-01-09 11:30:00,646,"I have deep fried walleye and northern pike fillets at the same time, and some of the boys actually prefer the pike. Myself, I like them about equally."
536434,Guest,2004-01-09 11:35:00,0,"OK, Maybe the question is not why would you want to eat a Pike but instead why would you want to put one of them in the boat....its like having an Elephant blow his nose in your Lund. If you cant catch enough Walleye to eat than buy some canned Sardines.....Sardines go good with Bud."
536436,Guest,2004-01-09 12:24:00,0,"lol drinking bud, ice fishing in a boat, (we use a thing called an ice huts)try that ... and if you like that then try filleting a pike and get no bones and eat it with your bud.Remember both have to come from COLD.."
