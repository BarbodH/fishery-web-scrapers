536466,Guest,2004-01-11 05:48:00,0,friend e-mailed from Dryden area and said last Saturday they got about 6 inches and the ice was about 14 inches thick. I don't think they had a lot on the ground before that as most had melted off. That is my take but would be interested in more current info. Hope to get up there this winter and poke a hole or two in the ice.

536647,Guest,2004-01-15 23:14:00,0,"Mike Kansas.. I've fished the NW end of Lac Seul near Ear Falls and down river past Seperation Lake. Many good fishing areas. Far fewer boats at Seperation to contend with. The entire English River system is good fishing for walleyes and northern. Just pick an area and try it......we are always going to new areas, but always on that river system. My question about snow depths related to spring melt and runoff that would bring the water level back to normal. Good luck."

We get a bit of snow each day the past week as the cold moved in, this weekend will see a moderation with more snow in the upcoming forecast. Lake level may be similar to last year according to reports; looks as though the construction at thr Ear Falls Generation station may take place; one of the reasons for last years drawdown before construction was cancelled. Lets hope for more snow and rain later this winter and early spring, rain in April is much appreciated as I don't have to shovel and plow it."
