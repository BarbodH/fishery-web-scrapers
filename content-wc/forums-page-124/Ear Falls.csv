6325714,Jwendt15,2019-05-28 05:44:00,72,"Prov, in your experience, has it ever been worth making the added trip to sunlight? Always curious to see what's back there, but not sure if it's worth it."
6325746,prov1800,2019-05-28 07:22:00,5010,Been in sunlight a number of times over the years.it has real good fishing also.be well worth it.just when I get to broad we normally get on fish and don't need to go any further.
6325754,SteveZ,2019-05-28 07:41:00,271,So how do you guys fish below Manitou Falls? Do you use live bait? Just curious.
6325760,ia bhtr,2019-05-28 08:02:00,212,"Primarily just spinner rigs and crawlers , have done a little casting with cranks , a little bit of jiggling plastics and some jigging raps , nothing fancy"
6325766,SteveZ,2019-05-28 08:08:00,271,I think that is pretty common. We haven't used live bait for about 20 years now. Jig and a plastic is a great way to find active fish and they just hammer them. Do you self a favor and grab some B fish N ringworms in purple/chartreuse and electric blue/pearl. Walleyes love them.
6325870,ia bhtr,2019-05-28 12:07:00,212,"Actually already have some of the ring worms , may try them more than I was expecting to >>====>"
6324998,jiggster,2019-05-25 15:01:00,183,The water temperature is about 53 degrees. Water level is about 4 ft higher this year but still below normal. Fish are active.
6325142,blewslb,2019-05-26 07:52:00,53,"Fished the opener ice out was 16th, caught slot and trophy fish, weather was cold, wind, one day of sun on the 20th. U will enjoy, we fished Chamberlain Narrows, Birch Point was not good!"
6325174,ia bhtr,2019-05-26 09:36:00,212,"Jiggster , 4 ft better than last year , are you talking this same time frame last vs this yr ?? I know it got quite a bit lower as the season progressed last year , at any rate that is putting a smile on my face !!"
6325314,jiggster,2019-05-26 19:13:00,183,A friend of mine was on his way to Knotty Pines yesterday. He had just heard from Norm at Knotty pine. Water level was compared to same time from last year.
6325326,ia bhtr,2019-05-26 19:37:00,212,"Thanks for that bit of info , we should easily( sort of ) get everywhere we want to !!"
6325392,prov1800,2019-05-27 05:47:00,5010,"Got out sat/sun and took 6 guys out of Onaway Lodge.water seems 3 ft low according to water line.many rocks poking out from there hiding places.fished main lake sat and although we did fish main lake we caught some but hard time locating schools.45 f most places and bays 55 f.travelled to broad lake on Sunday,glad I put extra shirt on at 3c with a me wind. have to be carefull going up the creek.very low and be extra carefull at the mouth to broad it's a foot deep tgere.we had a good day of fishing but it was still slow but not bad for conditions.55 f in there.managed some good fish up to 28"" in there.lots of slot fish and kept some 15-17"" eaters.rougher trip going in but wind layed down on way back so very enjoyable trip."
6325530,Lmbkiller,2019-05-27 13:04:00,639,"U guys asking about water level...the water will ALWAYS be low in lac seul, in the spring until Ontario changes how they regulate drawdowns. It's hydro first and everything else 2nd in Ontario. So instead of comparing levels throughout the open water period, compare to âsame time last yrâ."
6325554,brett13,2019-05-27 14:34:00,51,thank you for the feed back. we're leaving NW iowa friday and arriving at camp saturday mid day for the entire week.
6325558,Wall-i-Lama,2019-05-27 14:44:00,1524,"Here is the water level chart. The water is currently in the ""normal"" range, for this time of year. Meaning that it is the the middle 50 percentile. The water is about 2 to 3 foot lower than water level is normally in June and July. The graph shows current level of about 1166 at Goldpines, which is about the same level it has been at the end of May for the past three years.https://www.lwcb.ca/pdf/LacSeulGraph2019.05.27.pdf You can't necessarily use May levels to forecast summer levels. As you can see by this chart the levels were within normal ranges in May last year, yet fell well below them in the summer. I guess it depends on how much rain comes and the amount of released from the dam. But for now, the current level is almost in the middle of the normal historic levels for May.https://www.lwcb.ca/permpdf/LS/5-Yr_LS-2016-2020.pdf"
6325592,Jwendt15,2019-05-27 16:04:00,72,"Thanks for the report prov1800. When you were fishing broad, was anyone able to make it back to sunlight lake?"
6308426,brett13,2019-04-06 16:51:00,51,"Greetings all, I'm starting to get that itch! Looking forward to my yearly trip to NW Lac Seul the first week of June. Just checking to see how the ice is coming along up there? Does anybody else fish this part of Lac Seul in early june? I absolutely love it up there, and look forward to it every year, it never gets old. Good luck this season, and be safe."
6308476,bushead11,2019-04-06 18:55:00,151,I'm curious as well. I know there were contests last year and live webcams to guess the ice out. Always a crap shoot if we will be dodging iceburgs on the way to our outpost for the opener...
