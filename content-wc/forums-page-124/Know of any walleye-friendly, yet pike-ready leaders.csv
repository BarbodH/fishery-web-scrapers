6322488,Limeyangler,2019-05-17 21:09:00,563,"I would second the above, for pike I use Seaguar blue label flouro leader but if I was worried about big pike snapping me off while walleye fishing I would use 20lb too. If you are using 10-20lb braid you could use an FG knot to join the lines, very good knot that will pass through your guides no problem.If you don't know it already here is a video guide of how to tie it. Only works if the leader has a significantly larger diameter than the mainline and the mainline is braid.FG KNOT VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/0UhCbB80rCI"
6322494,martinbns,2019-05-17 21:52:00,1520,"Jigs and minnows are cheap, I would just accept the occasional bite-off. I regularly hook and land 30+"" pike on 10 pound flouro leaders tied to 10 or 15 pound braid while fishing for bass. Probably 75-80% of them."
6322532,lassh,2019-05-18 07:30:00,553,"I would use a 8"" to 10"" tieable multi-strand wire to attach to our jig. The stuff I use for pike/musky fly bite guard is the Rio Toothy Critter leader material. It costs more than $1 per foot. I think the smallest #test is 20# for the Rio. I have some worm harness spinner rigs tied with AFW Surflon Micro Supreme. Its is miniature 49 strand stainless steel wire and works very well. The AFW comes down to 13# test which may be a better for a jig tippet. Cortland also makes a table wire, I think its called SST that comes in lower # test. All of these tie with conventional knots. You can use a palomer knot with these materials. Some guys use a figure 8 knot. For the end you're connecting to your fishing line, you could tie a small swivel, or use a perfection loop or surgeons loop for connection. If your are using braid as main line, the Alberto knot works or use a double uni knot if you want a line to line connection with no loop or swivel. A big pike can cut right through 20# Fluoro, because I occasionally get bit off on my spinner rigs that I tie with 20# fluoro. Of course its much more durable than thin mono. They can bite through braided line as well. When we're getting some big pike bites when pulling spinners for walleyes, I'll put on a harness with a 10"" or foot or so tieable wire spinner snell tied to a piece of fluoro or mono which goes to my bottom bouncer or weight. The hooks snell just fine. I have tried the Knot 2 Kinky titanium wire, but I don't like it for this application because its a single strand wire and springy and the knots look like they are loose. Supposedly the knots are fine like that but I'm not confident in them and if your really pull hard enough to try to cinch everything up, I think you may weaken the connection. The advantage is that the Ti wire will stretch which might help a little if you're tying to braid. I do have a couple jigs tied to the stuff, but not my favorite."
6322796,Mojo-NC,2019-05-19 08:22:00,1929,"I make my own using Surflon nylon coated stainless steel wire. It's intended for the saltwater fishing guys. No knots are required - just twist it up and hit it with a flame for about 1 second. Put a snap swivel on one end and a barrel swivel on the other and you're off to the races. You can make your leader any length you want with this method. A 30' spool costs a little over $7 and you can make a bunch of 4"" to 6"" leaders with it.https://www.amazon.com/American-Fish...5EQ?th=1&psc=1"
6324746,jeffj69,2019-05-24 12:58:00,4,American Surflon makes a knottable wire leader that works really well for splicing onto your main line. It comes in 10lb - 50lb test.
6324754,Kartman35,2019-05-24 13:04:00,245,"That stuff is pricey, but great. I made a bunch of crawler harnesses with it...Simple snell and then pass very gently over a flame to barely melt the coating together works fantastic and super supple."
6325344,Hunts1,2019-05-26 20:00:00,123,Agree with that approach!

6322012,Maskinonge,2019-05-16 14:20:00,13,"Hi all, Did a handful of searches with the appropriate keywords and haven't found anything on this subject, plus this is probably almost strictly a Canada problem. Apologies if this has been covered before. I'm headed to Northern Manitoba to fish a system that's pretty much only pike and walleye. And it's one of those places where walleye and northern are likely to be hanging out in the same spots - mostly of 8-12' deep, current, no major deep lake basins (nearby at least). The lodge's website recommends using a leader even when jigging for walleyes since pike are so prevalent, and I'm inclined to sacrifice the purist Wisconsin/Minnesota jigging stylings for a more ham-fisted approach given that the fish aren't nearly as finicky as our upper midwest variety. However, I do have some pride. Are there any leaders on the market that would withstand an encounter with an upper 30""+ northern, or regular abuse from 4-6 pounders at least, but are still fairly negligible in the water? I remember using shorty (6""?) black-vinyl-coated wire leaders when I was a kid - one northern would kink it up, as would a spinner bait wrapped upon the cast. I'd probably have to go at least 12"" anyhow if a sizeable northern picks up an 1/8 oz. jig. Is a heavier fluoro leader an option? I could probably make my own with, say, 30# floro and a snap swivel, but I'd prefer just to buy a pack at a bait store or bass pro. Speaking of, an ideal middle-of-the-road leader would have a solid, but unobtrusive swivel. Hate it when the snaps collect weeds or worse, algae/moss. Is there any magical middle ground you guys have found?"
6322026,lazermule,2019-05-16 14:54:00,86,"I rigged up a rod last year with 20lb Power Pro braid (It's like a 6 or 8 lb mono diameter) and tied jigs right to it and did well on Walleyes and was able to stand my ground landing the pike (30""+) that would hit it as well without being bit off. Got a snag? Wrap it around the cleat on the boat and pull it free. Didn't always get the jig back but did more often than not. I will also tip it with a mono or flouro 4-6 foot leader for walleyes if Pike bite offs aren't posing a problem. Works well for me anyway.. LM"
6322048,adempsey2.0,2019-05-16 15:52:00,611,"6"" titanium wire is what I use. Works for me."
6322070,Rustynail,2019-05-16 16:57:00,2,Hi guys fly fish for trophy northern 40 to 51 inches every year up at Great Slave Lake. The best leader we have found is nylon coated Sevalon. It’s flexible and is tied line to line. Guys don’t use swivels on the business end of the line. The northern’s will destroy it.
6322082,Bill Krejca,2019-05-16 18:07:00,6107,"When pike are just as likely as walleye to bite, I use a thin stainless wire leader, which I make myself. 3-4 inches is sufficient for those waters, a small snap and a swivel on opp. ends. This size of leader does not seem to affect the action of neither a jig nor a crank bait in most cases. It is a bit difficult to determine whether more walleyes would have been taken if tied directly to the bait without the wire, if the fishing is good enough, it doesn't matter that much to me. Pike will tend to bend up the wire after a while, when this happens, I use my pliers to straighten the wire out as best I can, then eventually put on another leader. The bent job goes into my ""fix"" pile, to recycle the snap and swivel. Bill"
6322100,Kevin23,2019-05-16 18:35:00,2205,"Berkley makes a 15lb steel leader that I use on my ice fishing tipups when walleye/perch fishing areas with pike. Havent had a pike snip it yet, including a 12.5lber."
6322240,camp chef,2019-05-17 08:06:00,915,We use a good quality snap swivel to attach the jig....It does not bother the Walleyes and we have a less than 10% saw off rate on Northerns and Muskies
6322288,sbe2,2019-05-17 09:20:00,63,What knot do you use to tie the steel leaders?
6322328,1K1MOA,2019-05-17 11:13:00,90,"Like Bill, I also on occasion use thin stainless wire, my choice is High E strings for guitars. .008 to .010 are my favorite. I can get three leaders per string. You can find off-brand strings really cheap, I paid $2 for a 12 pack of .008's. To answer your question on tying...pass through eye of hook or swivel, grab both wires at the eye with a pliers, and wrap the short wire around the main wire four or five times with your finger and trim as close as possible. If you have a little nub, a Dremel stone will get rid of it if making at home, or use pliers to crush down in boat. If you don't, you will poke yourself with the nub at some point."
6322432,WallyWarrior,2019-05-17 15:36:00,2488,I would use 20 or 30 lbflouro for what you are doing. You are targeting walleyes with pike being the secondary catch? That heavy flouro is very abrasion resistant. You'll be happy with result. Personally 20lb flouro is the way I would go. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
