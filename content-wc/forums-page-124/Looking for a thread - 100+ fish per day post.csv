6324596,MrSimon,2019-05-24 08:44:00,922,"There are so many variables .... is it early or late in the trip, is the lake big or small, are you catching the RIGHT kind of fish in big numbers etc etc etc Sometimes I like to just set the hook over and over again for hours. Other times I want to be on the move hunting for new fish."
6324598,Shortline,2019-05-24 08:46:00,234,"Since this is already derailed, here's my $.02 .....Personally, I struggle plenty enough throughout the year to find fish and put a pattern together that on the occasional day when we can land on a pile of them and really rack up some serious numbers, I make the most of it. Those days are not frequent enough for me to get bored and toss em away."

6324750,jambi,2019-05-24 13:02:00,504,"We don't leave a ""Walleye Pound Town"" - catching a fish every 3 minutes or less. But will leave a spot that is slower than 8 to 10 minutes a fish. They are biting better somewhere else; or I will have fun trying to find them. But not a fan of the slow spots - THIS IS CANADA Regarding numbers - my Dad had control of the antiquated golf clicker and loved to count. We fished primarily pike and had trips to LOTW w/ over 1,000 fish weeks. In 10 years I bet our average was around the 700 fish for the week. Thankful for my trips with him; and I miss him dearly."
6324852,tv4fish,2019-05-25 05:29:00,2694,"I'm reasonably sure that you are not looking for my post - but -- for years we have been using ""clickers"" (lap counters) to track our fishing success. We fish Lac Seul and for years I have had a set of 3 clickers that are labeled on the side of my boat - one is for ""under slot"" - one is for ""in slot"" - and one is for ""over slot"". Every time one of us catches a fish - it is recorded by a simple ""tap"" on the lap counter. At the end of the day we then record the numbers in a ""log"" book along with weather conditions and the most productive fishing spot for the day. It has provided ""interesting reading"" over the years, for sure. And, yes - we also have had many days of over 100 fish in the boat (3 guys). The lap counters don't lie.............."
6324882,kzoofisher,2019-05-25 06:48:00,5144,"If I'm remembering the thread the OP was talking about it was about 100 fish per rod per day. That's a fish over the rail every 2.4 minutes for 8 hour for two guys 1.6 minutes for three guys or an average of every 5 minutes per guy. No stopping to eat or moving to a new spot. Assuming some fish come unbuttoned, it takes a minute to reel in/unhook/re bait and get back to the bottom (pretty fast), netting some of your partners fish, clicking the counter and sometimes you have to re tie that means your jig gets hit within a few seconds of entering the water. That would be fun for a few minutes, then it would be like fishing a trout pond. Not my cup of tea. I want to work the jig a bit (casting and working it is best) take a few breaks and look around, have lunch etc. 30-50 fish per day is a nice pace. That means I set up on some spots and pound them at a fast pace, other spots are more of a challenge. I'm also not frantically dropping back in the water to get another one as fast as I can. I'm on vacation, catching fish when I want, not catching fish when I want. I would like to see a video of guys fishing without breaks and bringing in fish every couple minutes for eight hours. Their stamina is impressive."
6325342,Hunts1,2019-05-26 19:58:00,123,"We've found in Lac Seul that when you find a good spot the larger fish are caught early and then you end up with the smaller ones after that. The bigger ones move out and on. Fun to catch the smaller ones but let's face it, big fish are more fun. We will work spots when ""good ones"" are still around but leave when we are only catching smaller ones. In the end we can lie about the numbers!Experimenting and learning new spots outweighs catching another 20 fish in an old spot and provides opportunities for other days when the ""hammer holes"" aren't producing. In earlier years we would count fish. Any more, it's not the number of fish but the experience. I remain amazed at folks who simply anchor for hours waiting for the next run of fish to come by. I'm sure they are successful but they also miss out on the exploratory part of fishing, which can be very important to developing skills and knowledge of the body of water they are fishing. But that's just me. To each his own!My two cents...."
6324250,wooglin,2019-05-23 09:00:00,371,Anyone have the link to the thread where a guy fully detailed out his walleye/pike catches for his trip? I'm talking thousands of walleyes and he had it detailed out to how many fish per guy and per boat? I could not find it in search.... TIA!!
6324256,Pooch,2019-05-23 09:29:00,4618,"Bi-annual Lac Seul trip. One morning, once a year one of our boats counts and measures every fish for that morning. Counting walleye only. By lunch (last summers trip) time three guys had 93 walleyes and the overall average was between 16 and 17 inches. Many fourteen to sixteen inch fish with some slots and some over slot. They park in one spot on a reef in mid August. Two guys fished live minnows on a jig while the third guy only fished artificial baits on a jig. This boat always catches more numbers, but smaller size than our other boats who tend to move off a spot if they catch nothing but small fish. The boat that does this counting each year has two engineers in it. Imagine that... When we fish Lac Seul our boats average fifty to sometimes over a hundred walleye per day fishing two guys in a boat. Outside of the guys mentioned above our other boats jig, troll and drift jigs, spinners, cranks and plastic. Overall, our boats that move a lot catch fewer, but larger fish.When we fish Lake Savant out total numbers are much less than on Lac Seul, but the average size is probably and inch or even two larger. Don't get me wrong, there are days when we struggle to catch twenty or thirty walleye per two man boat. And too... there have been days when we had cold cuts for dinner instead of the much anticipated walleye dinner.Not the answer to your question, but an honest fish count from me. Pooch"

6324326,kzoofisher,2019-05-23 12:54:00,5144,"Octanehi5 posted a lot in that thread and he doesn't post a lot so search him or Lac Hebert. My feeling is that if you get a fish every 3-6 minutes for 8-10 hours it would be boring. I like to find em, catch Â‘em and go find more. When I pick a spot and pound them for a bit I'm happy as a clam. It means I figured it out, or at least that's what I tell myself. Maybe I'm strange but if it's too easy I don't like it."
6324434,drew59,2019-05-23 18:58:00,87,"I agree. Plus, don't you think at some point you're catching the same fish several times? Finding them is more rewarding than catching imo."
6324456,Lmbkiller,2019-05-23 21:09:00,639,Clip them and u will know. Likely not catching same fish
6324494,wooglin,2019-05-24 05:32:00,371,"Thanks, I did see that thread and it is not what I was looking for. There was literally a post where a guy had it nailed down to exactly how many fish his boats caught for the week and it an incredibly detailed post... Hope to find it yet"
6324560,stumcfar,2019-05-24 07:41:00,451,"We have a guy in our group who likes to move around all the time. I go to Ontario to catch fish. It may sound boring to some, but when I get on fish I stay until it wears out. There are some days we hardly ever move. Our goal is 120-150 fish for 3 guys a day. Most days that is possible, even more, but there are the days that it is much tougher. Enjoy the day, they go by fast!"
6324582,johnboat,2019-05-24 08:22:00,2014,Me too! I never break my Golden Rule #1. NEVER leave fish to find fish!
