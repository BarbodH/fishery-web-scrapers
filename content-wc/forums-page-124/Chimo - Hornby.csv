6326550,Hillbiehle,2019-05-30 10:43:00,66,Heading there this August. I've been there several times and found a few areas that tend to be productive. However I'd be interested in hearing (and sharing) with others about other areas that are worth checking out....that I might not have discovered. Please PM if you'd like to discuss.

I made several laminated maps and was super excited but just never made it. I look forward to the reports as I hope to still one day make it there. Would also like to get into Bearberry someday (Warwick Lake). That year we were flown into Wagin Lake which was at best average. Might have been weather but I don’t plan to return there!Good LuckWe leave for Beteau Lake 6/14 and can’t hardly wait to get there!!!!"
