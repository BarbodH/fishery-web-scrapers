This would be for ride home potentially and depending on how early the outfitter gets us flown out of our lake. Thanks"

6324552,Pooch,2019-05-24 07:28:00,4618,"Depends on what roads you are traveling through Duluth. There are many along Rt. 53 north, beginning at the Days Inn on 53 (NO BOAT parking there, though) across from the mall. There is very little to the NE along Rt. 61 to Thunder Bay. There are hotels along 61 at Two Harbors and some of the touristy towns, but they are probably booked early.Mostly depends on your travel route. Look here.https://hotelguides.com/minnesota/ma...mn-hotels.htmlPooch"
6324564,Golden Eagle,2019-05-24 07:46:00,2642,"Best Western in Superior, just before crossing bridge has been treating me well. Close to 53, but not very visiable. Usually has vacancies."
6324572,Twodogs,2019-05-24 08:00:00,115,Stayed at Barkers island Resort in past...clean ..plenty of parking and restaurant on premises.
6324766,NARDA 1,2019-05-24 13:36:00,636,"Super 8 in Superior, Holiday Gas right next door, Gronk's Bar and Grill (great food) right in front of it. Plenty of parking. Choo Choo Bar and Grille across the street for breakfast."
6324808,Bill Krejca,2019-05-24 18:35:00,6107,"Up the road a ways, so maybe not applicable for you, but we stayed at the Grand Portage casino right on the border. Rooms have been redone, large lot for boats which is patrolled during nighttime. Bill"
6324820,drlee,2019-05-24 19:40:00,409,Yup. Great idea. Have stayed there a couple of times and used Gronk's. Good beer. No driving to the motel.
6324832,reddemon2,2019-05-24 20:17:00,255,"Black Bear Casino in Carlton, right of 35, that way you can gamble your sorrows away from a bad week of fishing"
6325138,Jeler,2019-05-26 07:37:00,92,"Have spent the night here before, no complaints. Large Parking lot!Clean and great staff.https://www.staycobblestone.com/wi/superior/"
