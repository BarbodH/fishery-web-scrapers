6326372,Mrxlh,2019-05-29 21:06:00,210,"Regular Carbide sharpeners work very well for a quick touch up. The only knife that I really keep super sharp is my Y bone knife, all I use it for is removing Y bones from Pike. I do have a cheap Bass Pro 4"" for hack a shacking through the scales, that seems to help greatly in keeping everything else sharp."
6326560,Ricky Spanish,2019-05-30 11:29:00,1298,"I have to agree on the quality of knife being most important. I don't eat enough fish to justify anything more than a Rapala knife, but a quality steel will hold an edge much longer. I usually only shapen my Wusthof or Henkel's knives with the WorkSharp maybe once a year but give them a few swipes on a steel almost every time I pick one up. Incidentally, the ceramic honing stick that came with my WorkSharp is what I use for my Rapala fillet knife."
6324922,Jwendt15,2019-05-25 09:17:00,72,"Just curious, how often are you guys going through the full process of sharpening your fillet knives? I typically have a honing rod that I run along the knife after each use. Wondering if I should purchase a sharpening kit for our trip. I'm getting them sharpened at cabelas before we leave and we'll probably clean 70 to 80 walleye over the week. Should a freshly sharpened fillet knife last through that along with a fine tune sharpen with the honing rod along the way?"
6324960,andreindy,2019-05-25 12:12:00,308,"I too have had fillet knife paranoia. I do sharpen my knives before I go up, and then have a small diamond hone that I bring up to maintain my edge. One thing I am doing this year is bringing a small, serrated edge knife up to cut the heads off with before cleaning. I have never filleted with that technique, but I am going to try and the serrated knife will take most of the cuts into the scales that often did a great deal of dulling for me. Going to try variations of the technique in this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtRA...&feature=share"
6325032,FishWi,2019-05-25 17:43:00,2,Electric knife to get the fillet off the fish then use it to skin it. Use a regular fillet knife to take the bones out. It's faster.
6325082,hoppy63,2019-05-26 05:09:00,367,"I don't have high dollar knives. I use Rapalas. Once sharp, (when new or after a good sharpening on a stone) I just use a steel, maybe a half dozen licks on each side of knife after every 3-4 fish. I think the key is keeping a good edge before it gets dull enough to be able to ride to Texas on it without cutting your arse. I'll be trying my method out again in about 37 days!"
6325358,Baseline,2019-05-26 21:51:00,3207,"I use a Work Sharp. Keeps all my knives, household and sports, razor sharp. I have a collection of high quality knives, but I've reverted back to using my cheap Rapala knives. andreindy - What is the purpose for cutting the head of a fish you are going to fillet?"
6325426,andreindy,2019-05-27 08:04:00,308,"Hi Baseline, I have never cut the heads off before. Watch the link in my post above...it is intriguing and I am going to give the technique a try. I'm always open to trying something new."
6325552,Lmbkiller,2019-05-27 14:32:00,639,"Electric then a skinzit, once proficient should be 15 seconds per fish if 1 guy on each tool"
6325642,halfmoon007,2019-05-27 18:18:00,121,"That theory of not using your good edge to cut thru the scales works pretty good. Seems like its metallurgy is pretty good as it holds a edge pretty good.

6326286,Obabikon,2019-05-29 17:48:00,2370,"Much of the original question reverts back to what brand of knife you're using. I use a wusthof... and it holds a blade much longer than my previous knives. My guides all have leech lake knives, but I just didn't like the sharp back edge. Those also are high quality steel, and hold an edge. One of the guides will go more than a month without sharpening."
