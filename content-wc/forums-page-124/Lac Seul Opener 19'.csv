Pat sold Evergreen to new owner Brent and Kathie last year but I didn't make it up to meet them. After meeting them I can say they're absolutely great people and are running the lodge very well. We also have a lot of Iowa connections with Kathie, weird how that seems to happen up in Ear Falls! My uncle and I stayed in the camping cabins which are perfect for 2 guys. They did upgrade all the boats chairs as the depthfinders to Lowrance Hook 5's. Both of these upgrades greatly improve the times spent on the water. The fishing- The wind was the biggest factor, it was very windy and cold on a couple of days. Wednesday we had the trifecta, wind/rain/cold, which was brutal. Needless to say we cut that day a little short. We had a great year and caught lots of slot and over the slot walleyes. On the first day my Uncle caught his PB walleye at 27.5"", 6.8lbs. I hooked into a 40"" northern on my jigging rod, it was quite the battle! It was too large for the net and flopped out 2 times until I remembered I brought boga style grips and we landed with that. It weighed 14.10lbs, my new PB Northern. We broke 2 PB on the first day and we've been coming for 23 years, amazing. My uncle caught a 4lb smallie also which was his biggest to date from Lac Seul also. The water temp on the main was 52, we found bays that would be as warm as 60. We caught most of the fish in 4-10FOW, most of the time anchored in 10fow and casting shallow would produce. The eyes were biting very soft, I would pick up my jig and it would feel like I was on a rock. Weren't getting the big hits or taps. We had best luck on 1/8 jig with minnow. Only caught a handful on leeches. When the bite would turn on I would throw powerbait or gulp and do well snap jigging. Week stats 297 Walleyes 81 Slot 20 Over slot 114 Pike 15 Smallies 426 Total Pretty awesome for 2 guys from Iowa How was your opener?"

6325666,Lmbkiller,2019-05-27 19:12:00,639,Interesting that the water temp is same too warmer than 500mi south. I would've expected different. Ice out was the 16th
