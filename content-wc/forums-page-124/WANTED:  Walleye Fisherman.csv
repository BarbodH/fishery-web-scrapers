We will be there from June 9 - 16th, 7 days of trophy walleye and pike fishing. We need at least 1 person to even out the boats and get the reduced rate, but have room for 3 additional people. We fly with Amik outposts, been doing this for too many years to count. We are out of Wisconsin, and carpool the drive up to Red lake on the 8th of June. If you love fishing, having fun, and been wanting to go to Canada, here is your opportunity to try it out with an excellent outfitter and a group of experienced guys. Thanks, BOB"

We have a trip planned 6/15-6/22 so just wouldnâ€™t work out........if it were a little more spread our would love to get on that river system. Have heard good things about it for years.Good luck with your search! Gotta be somebody out there looking for a quality fishing trip!"

6325242,bthomas3333,2019-05-26 14:49:00,465,I wish you had been able to post this sooner. I love jumping on last minute need a guy trips. This even lines up to me being on my way home from a fly-in out of Winnipeg but I need a little more than 3 weeks notice to adjust stuff on the home/work front.Just for grins which camp on the river are you stay at?Brett
