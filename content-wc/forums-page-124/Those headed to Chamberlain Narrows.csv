Even though I was right of that buoy by a good 40 feet I should have been 50 feet to the right. Oh well, never a day without excitement."
6325240,pjshorthorn,2019-05-26 13:57:00,5654,Are you referring to the first green bouy coming out of Bear Narrows and then heading towards Three Sisters reef ? Just the prop or the lower unit too ? PjShorthorn
6325364,David Anderson,2019-05-26 22:08:00,2073,"Yes, the green buoy before the 3 sisters. Apparently if I was about 5 feet more to the right I would not have put a 4 inch hole in the front of my gear case. Looked like the Exxon Valdez for a while! Sure got some looks from the house boat guys as I came roaring by with my 9.8 kicker! Actually did pretty well fishing the Narrows and just around the corner. They said there are 2 kinds or boaters on Lac Seul, those who have found a rock and those who will. Ken arranged to have me pulled back to the landing with the barge that had twin 150's. Getting pulled behind a boat at 32 MPH had it's own set of issues. When we first took off my he told me to put both motors up then I proceeded to swing back and forth, almost got thrown from the boat. My 620FS got perpendicular to the barge and I was desperately trying to get my life vest on (BTW I never get into the boat without it on, but this time to preoccupied with getting the boat hooked up). Finally the tow rope snapped which was a blessing in disguise. Finally got the right length and it was much more enjoyable but thank God I had black underwear on!"
6325384,stjoeguy,2019-05-27 04:54:00,979,"Wow, your story brings back a bad memory! I got towed by twin 125s with similar results, swinging wildly back and forth. The guys in the barge thought the next swing was going to flip me. Thank goodness the rope broke in my case, also."
6325386,tv4fish,2019-05-27 05:20:00,2694,"David: Very sorry to hear this -- glad it turned out ""safely"" (but still going to be expensive). ??? --- How is the water level - would you say it is ""low"" on that part of Lac Seul ??"
6325398,pjshorthorn,2019-05-27 06:03:00,5654,"Man o man !!!! I'm really sorry to hear about the mishap, but so glad to hear you are OK through both adventurous aspects of going up the lake and down the lake !!!!! I would have definitely had an embarrassing moment in my drawers if I went through what you did with the boat being towed. I have watched Ken blow up and down the lake with a full load of fuel or a big tractor or backhoe loaded on the barge......it can move pretty dang quick !!!!!Besides my wife, I can honestly say that this Grand Lady called Lac Seul is the love of my life. I met both them in 1982 and have been married to them both since that time...... I'm guessing that I have made that run from Deception landing/ Hudson landing to the Chamberlain area around 50ish times.......many of which were navigating a 75' houseboat on that route. In all those trips, I've only had three occasions where I felt like myself or another person may be in a bit of trouble navigating the lake.On one occasion I was fishing with my Dad at the very eastern end of Kekabeka Narrows. We had a really great sand point all to ourselves for jigging walleyes with a great view all the way down the Narrows towards Ski Doo Point and Bear Narrows. At one point I noticed a houseboat in the Narrows heading our way. Although a bit unusual to see a HB coming through Kekabeka Narrows, it was not hard to do for an experienced pilot when taking a group into a small parking place at Foreman Lake. In any event, I didn't pay much attention to the HB until about 30 minutes later when it hadn't gotten any closer to us and I thought to myself, those boys are in trouble. I watched for a few more minutes intently and pretty soon a boat came towards us and raced right by heading towards Chamberlain. A few minutes later the boat came racing back and then slowed about a 100 yards from us. I told Dad that we were being visited by the MNR and that I would talk with them and to not say anything unless asked. Turns out the boater was one of the fellas on the HB and wanted to know if we owned the HB about a mile north of us. I said nope, it belonged to the outfitter. I said are you with that HB...pointing to it down the Narrows? He said yes and we need some help. Are you stuck on a reef ? Yes and we don't know what to do. Call your outfitter to come pull you off. We really don't want to do that. Can you take your HB and pull us off? No, I won't assume that liability ,but after a few more questions I told him....here is some free advice. Get all of your hineys and as much gear as possible off the HB into your fishing boats....except for the pilot. Next, lash two boats to the rear deck of the HB. In conjunction together, put the HB in reverse while turning the wheel back and forth as quickly as possible and pull her off the reef and hope she will come loose without damaging your pontoons. It will be risky,but if you want to take that chance it is your only hope of helping yourself. We watched in earnest as they worked and eventually they got free. They blew by us honking their horn and waving. Turns out they tried to navigate at 1 am in complete darkness. I told my Dad he had permission to either ban me from running a boat for life or shoot me dead if I ever did something so dumb.The second occasion was when we were heading south down the lake on the way back to Deception landing. I had spent a great week at Lac Seul Outposts and was being shuttled back to the landing in one of their big boats. We had some other customer's following in their own boats as well and when we came out of Bear Narrows heading south, one fella decided to come up on our right and start to go a bit ahead. He got over too far to the right and we all started trying to get his attention to stop. He was too far ahead of us and we couldn't catch up with all the gear and people in the boat. We all thought that he was done for and going to hit a known ( to some of us) sleeper reef that he was oblivious to at the time. Somehow he made it past that reef without incident....except for the discussion that ensued afterwards. We slowed down almost to a stop and he finally noticed us lagging behind. We crept up to him and when close enough he got a full frontal assault by the guide running the camp shuttle that would make a sailor blush. I literally felt like we were going to witness a terrible accident with really bad consequences. Thank goodness I was younger at that time as I probably would have had a heart attack watching the whole thing unfold.The last occasion was when we were heading back to the HB landing in Hudson. We had spent a great week fishing all of our favorite spots in the NE section and endured a week of some pretty good storms mixed in with heavy rain. The water level was high when we started our trip a week before,but with all the rain during the week we didn't realize how much the lake level had come up until we got further south on the way back. There are two areas that have significant current on a normal day. On this particular day, I didn't anticipate how much the current may have increased during the week and when we started to enter the beginning of Manitou Rapids, the current grabbed that 75' HB and wouldn't allow me to make the hard right turn into the narrows properly. With the wheel cranked all the way to the right, we headed straight to the shoreline in front of us with no movement to our right at all. Mind you, we were pulling 4 more tins cans behind us like a Happliy Married couple right after their nuptials. Some way , somehow, the HB 250 HP Mercruiser finally grabbed hold and turned us at the last moment. It looked like the bow was 10 ft from the shoreline before she turned. We made it through with all the tins cans still floating and a lot of big sighs from everyone. After getting through the narrows I told my uncle he had the wheel for a bit. He is like.... Where the heck are you going? Going to get SOME AIR !!! I don't know what time of the morning it was,but I didn't care....I had two beers and some time to calm down on the rear deck by myself. If I had still smoked at that time, I would have fired up about 5 cigs in rapid fire succession. Upon reflection, if we had hit the shoreline I'm pretty sure the current could have swung the stern of the HB around enough to have us heading down river backwards with the fishing boats crashing into the side of the HB and opposite shoreline. Trying to recover and get that long of a vessel heading north again would have been a cluster X10. Not sure I would have been able to. If another boat, let alone another HB, had been coming through the Narrows at the same time......we would have been in one heck of a mess that still gives me shivers when thinking about it.Ahhhhhh....the memories and adventures over the years with my girlfriend named Lac Seul. She is a beauty that can rival any goddess mortal men have dreamed about knowing. You have so much experience on this lake and obiviously know the same thing as I do....... She just commands a lot of respect on any given day. I guess when it comes down to it, we all "" pays our monies and take our chances"".I'm seriously considering a return trip to the old stomping grounds in 2020 after a 6 year hiatus. I could use a good hug from Brenda and I wouldn't even mind Ken telling me one or two more times that I shouldn't wait till so late in the evening when returning to camp......LOL.Hope you have a great fishing season the rest of this year.PjShorthorn"
6325400,jimirjr,2019-05-27 06:05:00,1149,Holy Cripes.... What a (bad) adventure... That was REALLY nice of Ken to help !
6326060,Slim03,2019-05-28 21:37:00,159,Sorry for your bad luck and that seems like a wild ride back. I have seen that boat out before pulling others and always wondered what may have happened. Thank you for letting others know about the hazard. I’m always cautious but just wondered if and when my lower unit falls to the beauty of Lac Seul.
6326074,David Anderson,2019-05-28 22:44:00,2073,"Well, great stories, I guess it wasn't the worst thing to be stranded at LSO. We discussed using Flex tape to seal up the hole then if it worked see if they would have run our story. It's amazing the things one can think about after a few. A couple of things learned. 1. Don't pull a boat without the main motor down to keep it running straight. 2. May consider purchasing 2, 20 feet tow straps rated for 15,000#. About 40 feet seemed like the perfect length and it probably is a good idea to have in the boat. 3. Run the GPS Heading Up. I put a lot of reliance on my existing trails however with North up it can be easier to get off course before you realize it simply because one is trying to look at too much and interpret. I was to the left of my ""standard"" trails but still right of the buoy, this is where I messed up. While being towed it gave me a good opportunity to experiment with the GPS/trails and see the best way to view your intended route. 4. Count my blessings on good insurance. Went to the agency today and they were right on it. Also my dealer let me drop it off on the way back to the Cities after I emailed them on Tuesday afternoon. Claims they have a lower unit in stock. 5. My friends were pleasantly surprised that I wasn't totally bummed out. My story leads back to when my Grandmother was alive, back then everyone had a print of the Serenity Prayer framed, God Grant me the ability to accept those things I can't change, Change those I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Admittedly a good drink after the day was done did help, didn't change much but sometimes any excuse....."
6326300,MikeMcC,2019-05-29 18:39:00,72,I felt your pain once heading into Shanty Narrows from the SE and clearly inside of the markers I lost my lower unit. The conditions were rough and I believe the marker was blown off to one side coupled with a deep trough contributed to a long journey back to Ear Falls. You sure don't forget lesson taught by the Grand Lady!
