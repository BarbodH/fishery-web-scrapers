What I wasn't expecting was to get to the Grayling area of Michigan and no leaves on the trees. There were still some snow piles along 17 that had yet melted.Ice came off a week prior to our arrival. As expected there were no weed beds to fish. Surface Water temps were 50 to 56. The highest I saw was 58 in a dark bottom bay. Fish had spawned under the ice and everything was in a funk. Water levels were extremely high but dropped almost a foot in the 3 days we were there. Even the locals were having a hard time finding fish......Anyone heading 17 north out of the Soo keep your eyes peeled for moose! We saw 9 between the trip up and back.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
