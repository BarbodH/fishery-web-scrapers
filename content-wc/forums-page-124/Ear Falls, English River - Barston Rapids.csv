6326722,Bakefish,2019-05-30 19:11:00,1077,"PL123, I've run those rapids hundreds of times. When approaching the rapids you'll see what looks like a ""V"", where two currents come together. Keep your boat just to the left of the ""V"". To your left you will see a point with mergansers on it, they are always there. Keep your boat about two boat lengths to the right of the point. Keep going straight toward the approaching shoreline, don't drift into the middle of the rapids. Turn a hard right about 3 or 4 boat lengths from the shoreline and head west. When you get near the end of the island on your right angle your boat to the right and point it at the gap across Wegg. The water is low now so you'll see the rocks on your right and your left that won't come into play. It sounds dangerous and complicated, but it's not that bad. Just don't be a wuss with your throttle. Don't be crazy fast, but don't let the current own you. if you get there early in the day just hang around by the sign (you'll know it when you see it) and fish for walleye. Sooner or later a boat from Anderson's will come by and you can follow them. That's what I did the first time on the lake. Good luck my friend."
6326232,PostLake123,2019-05-29 13:51:00,6,"Staying not far from Ear Falls and wanting to take a couple day trips down river from Manitou Falls on the English River. Never been in this area, and I'm looking for information and tips on navigating through Barnston rapids to Wegg lake and below? I've only been able to look at Google earth, and haven't found any pictures or video of the rapids. How do you best navigate? I have a 17 foot with a 115hp. I assume your run the middle, where there is least white water? Do you go right or left of the small island below the rapids? How rough is it? Any Big rocks or obstacles to look out for? Or should I wait, and watch and follow someone who has navigated it? I've run the rapids at Abrams lake, going up into Minnitaki (Sioux Lookout). If anyone has done both rapids, are they similar? Also, any fishing tips or general areas to focus on the fishing aspects are for a beginner in this stretch is also greatly appreciated. I'll be there the week of June 15th."
6326244,BreezyPoint,2019-05-29 14:43:00,1581,"These rapids are very navigable, but also can be quite dangerous, especially if the water is low and they are spilling full tilt out of the dam. That creates big standing waves down the center, so be on the lookout for that.Generally they are pretty safe to navigate under most conditions. You can go either side of the island but probably easier on the left.You can follow these instructions at your own risk...go right down the center of the rapids towards the middle of the island... as the channel opens on the left there is at least one rock...go a few feet past that and take a hard left and then take a gentle arc down to to bottom of the rapids staying closer to the center of the channel. There will be rocks on your right coming out the bottom.I know other walleye central people go there and may be able to give it a better description or call me out on any errors (please do so - I have been down them so many times it is almost automatic and I may have missed something).A lot of boats fish the rapids, so be on the lookout as you go down.Here is a photo of the rapids in a very navigable state...https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...b093abc97a.jpgFrank"
6326248,BreezyPoint,2019-05-29 14:54:00,1581,"A couple more pictures of the rapids...note the rapids will form a vee pointing towards the island. As you start down, you want to stay in that vee and out of the white water on either side.Last year there were no rapids when I was there, the water was very low and they were not spilling any water out of the dam.https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...33341db386.jpghttps://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...7eb04c2839.jpgFrank"
6326274,ia bhtr,2019-05-29 16:02:00,212,"I agree on staying to the left of the island , lodge owner where we stay says the right side likes to eat props / lower units , we took him at his word and stay away from it"
6326276,JAY221,2019-05-29 16:06:00,877,"I have not been through them in many years but I remember it as Breezy Point says. In years past I stayed @ the old Naughty Pines and when Steve picked us up he would take us around either side of the island depending on the water level.It can be done and if you stay at Manitou Falls you would be running it every day. Later, Jay"

6326444,PostLake123,2019-05-30 07:28:00,6,"Thanks for the responses, and details. Sounds once you go thru once or twice becomes a no brainer so long as you pay attention to the route.Any beginner points or fishing tips or general locations to focus on in this stretch of the river? Like I said will be up there week of June 15th. Walleye of course, but we like casting for northerns as well if we can find some decent sized fish."
6326486,ChuckD,2019-05-30 08:43:00,1581,This is the route I have always taken. I go on plane and bust through the rapids/waves. I've driven from the dam to the falls that lead to Oak Lake several times. Luckily I have friends that know the entire stretch and I've driven it several times.
