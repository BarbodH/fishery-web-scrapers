Fishing was just so so. 3 of us caught around 400 walleyes with 26"" the biggest but it weighed almost 8lbs. Never seen one that thick and fat at that length. Caught some nice smallies and a few crappies. The walleyes were at a variety of depths from 19' to 28' most around 22-26. Water temps ranged from 47-55degrees for the week. I'll be back up in August. Good luck to everyone and God bless"
