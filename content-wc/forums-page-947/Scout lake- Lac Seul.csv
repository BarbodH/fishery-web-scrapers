521372,Voyager,2002-06-15 08:54:00,1,"I know the Camp (clean cabins, well-maintained facilities, good equipment) & fished Scout Lake, Badger. Sarah sets out a good meal, and Roland will put you on fish. I've been there in early June & late July. Make sure you confirm lake level, and take a good chart(s) and GPS (with compass backup) especially if you're adventuresome. Watch the daily weather, and watch for boating hazards Â– rocks and stumps. Scout Lake is divided into three bays -- W (Camp), 2nd, and E. All have produced nice eyes and gators, plus so does the channel out to the main lake. The channel offers good spots: coves, bays and points. I save Scout Lake mostly for foul-weather days (more wind protected) and shorter evening trips. On fair days, I like to explore other locations, depending on weather and wind direction: Farwell Bay, Bay of Islands, South Bay and Inlet, and across the main lake to McKenzie Bay & Broad and Sunlight Lakes, or even S. to Manitoba and Windigo Points. The searchin' is almost as much fun as the catchin', followed by close thirds: the eatin', the scenery & wildlife, and the escape to the boondocks. Scout Lake, around grass island in 2nd bay, produced both northern and eyes. Likewise weeds along E shoreline. Farther out at entrance to E bay, past channel entrance, is E bay point with a drop off along shore (look for stretch of boulders along shoreline), also fish around larger island: eyes. Back-troll or drift with spinner tipped with minnow, leech, or twister tail, or jig with same (8 to 15 ft) red & white, chartreuse, silver or gold blades. By August, plenty of weed beds around the lake; fish the edges and pockets for northern anywhere in bays (5 to 10 ft.). Standard assortment of spinners (Mepps giant killer & Abu bangtail, light colors, or silver or gold, worked for us). We've also had good luck with spoons (weedless is much less hassle) with, Dardevle (red/white), 5 of diamonds (yellow), red eye, & Johnson's minnow (silver or gold).Did I mention charts, compass, and GPS, and caution: stumps, but especially rocks. Drop me an email; for a few more specifics.Ray[email protected] Ray"

Most of the action was up in Broad, Sunlight and South Bay. The fishing was outstanding in Sunlight. Lots of ""slot"" and ""over slot"" fish. This was my second trip to Lac Suel this spring and fishing was great both trips. I just wish the weather was nicer, the rain and wind really got old after a few days."
521374,NateW,2002-06-19 09:07:00,96,"We'll be checking into Scout Lake Resort on July 6. We usually do okay on Scout Lake. It's a good lake to fish when the big lake gets realy rough or you only have a little daylight left. As mentioned the small island in the middle prtion of the lake is good for walleye and larger pike. Our best success was with spinner tipped with minnows. Chart., and char/orange were the best colors for us. We also did well drifting with chart. marabou jigs--yes, I still use them!For pike we used large in-line spinners, mostly buchertaiils and also the largest Johnson Silver minnows we could find tipped with yellow twister tails. For some reason ordinary twister tails worked much better than Powerbait twister tails.SLR is a nice place. The cabins are liveable, the boats get us where we want to go and Liz, Roland and Sarah are excellent hosts. Don't know about the food since we do our own cooking, but if it tastest anything like it smells is probabaly awesome!Good luck, I'll try and post a report when I get back!"
