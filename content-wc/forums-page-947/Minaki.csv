521497,minnow,2002-06-17 10:42:00,26,We are leaving for Minaki this weekend. Is there a place to get leaches between Kenora and Minaki? I think there is but was wondering if it was still open. Thanks for any information anyone has.
521498,Chad,2002-06-17 11:10:00,3523,Last year we pulled into Kenora and got leeches at a bait shop on the East end of town when you come in. It is on the South side of the road. The leeches were very nice and fairly reasonable.
521499,Reels,2002-06-17 11:24:00,2876,I would just get them in Minaki. jacks had them for $32/lb Canadian when I was there a few weeks ago.<{{}}><
521500,Keith,2002-06-18 06:42:00,48,I was up there last week and we got bait at the gas station on the west side of Sioux Narrows. True jumbo leeches for about the same price. By far the best bait we have ever purchased in canada. The telephone number is 1-888-229-0405. Call ahead and reserve them. Our reserved leeches were much better then the leeches he was selling to people just walking in. How was fishing Reels? We had some really good fishing before and after the storm.
