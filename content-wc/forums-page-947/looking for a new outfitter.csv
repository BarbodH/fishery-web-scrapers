Would prefer to fly out of Thunder Bay or the area of Fort Frances/Int Falls.I have found Northern Wilderness outfitters and L & M Sioux Lookout Flyins.Anybody use these two and have comments or have any other suggestions ?We like to catch plenty of eyes for the pan and have a better than average shot at a few trophy size northerns for (C&R).Thanks in advance,lobo"
