Let us know how you make out.Did I mention that in 2 days 5 hours I'll be dunkin' my boat into Lake Kipawa Quebec? You guys have longer waits than I do, but when I'm back at work and all glum you guys will be sittin/ pretty on your lakes."

521577,Guest,2002-06-19 06:20:00,0,"JohnH, sounds like we will be fishing Lac Seul the same week, 7-6 thru 7-12. I come out of an outpost on Williams Lake that accesses Lac Seul via Williams Creek. Come out into Williams Bay and head out toward main lake. Be 4th year there, tremendous fishing. I enjoy our spot, very secluded, lots of wildlife, occasional bear comes calling and ususally moose in the creek. God I can smell the cedar now!"
