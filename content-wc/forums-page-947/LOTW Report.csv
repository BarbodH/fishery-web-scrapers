The storms just kept rolling in one after the other and the severity was something to behold especially on a House Boat!An unusual week of fishing to say the least but by making some changes we caught a respectable number of fish. First we began in Moroson and found the water on Sunday the 9th in that section of LOTW turbid and visibility down to less than a foot. We motored northwest toward the SandBay Firebag Island & the Poplar Island areas.Smallmouth fishing was less than what we expected with average water temps. of 59-62. We still caught fish off boulders and ledges in 4-8' of water with spinner baits, tubes, and crawfish crank baits. We caught 1 or 2 fish in areas where we have boated 10-20 over the years. Later in the week the water temps. started to creep up and more Smallies became active but no real numbers yet.Walleye fishing was the shining star for us. Most of our fish came bottom bouncing using spinner rigs with Hammered cooper blades, (Colorado, Chopper & Smiley styles) 12-28' of water and these fish were buried in the transitions zone between the rocks and the mud. One member of our party caught a 27"" walleye with eggs coming out of her in 28' of water on the June 15th! We also used green crawlers that were well conditioned and leeches. We had no problem for the most part catching plenty of fish but you had to move constantly and not get caught up in old habits that worked in the past.Muskies & Northerns were caught throughout the week most on tandem spinner baits on flats adjacent to deeper water and in deeper reed beds. The next few weeks with warming temps should set LOTW on fire but the rain is still continuing on an almost daily basis.Call ahead and make sure the roads are open if you are going in the near future.Good Luck,JP"
