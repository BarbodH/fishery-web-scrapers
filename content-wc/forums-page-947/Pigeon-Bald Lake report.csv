521264,Trophymuskie,2002-06-10 20:30:00,254,"Just got back from Pigeon lake and the muskies are moving now, got 3 this morning in the north end (+ 4 follows and a missed strike in 5 hrs) but the 50 incher I caught on Saturday came from the south end. I won the Muskies Canada opener with that fish and many others were caught on Saturday from the 75+ anglers.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com"
521265,Guest,2002-06-11 05:02:00,0,"Nice going. I guess the musky fishing will be tough this weekend, considering they probably released the musky at the weight in station, and they will be a bit spooked.Did you catch that 50"" casting or trolling?What lures did you have luck with?Thanks, and congrats!pooch"
521266,Trophymuskie,2002-06-11 08:08:00,254,"Fish are all fine this is a Muskies Canada event and all fish are water released like every other day as the club runs events on an honor system. People were also fishing buckhorn, chemong and sturgeon so the 75+ anglers were scatered around pretty good.The hot bites were all different from crank to jerks but for me it was dark spinnerbaits and inlines.My big one came trolling as well as my smaller one, we did catch the other 5 casting for 29 to 40 inches.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com"
521267,Guest,2002-06-12 07:54:00,0,"Hey Trophymusky,I don't have any experience in tournaments; maybe you can help me understand. 1. What is the honor system? I can make a guess. Do the fishermen release the musky where they caught them, after measurements are taken? If 75 fishermen catch a couple musky each and release them at the weigh-in station you'd think in the short term the musky fishing in other parts of the lake/s will be adversely effected.2. Does the tournament pressure ruin fishing for the rest of the year on the smaller lakes. I know that in some bass tournaments they release the fish in various sections of the lakes, which probably helps. I fish the bald lakes intensely, and after tournaments, I can really notice a difference in the fishing action. Either the fish are spooked, or are caught and released in other lakes. Really sucks for the small lakes. pooch"
521268,Trophymuskie,2002-06-12 10:50:00,254,"The tournaments I fish are instant release, you measure the fish and let it go. All we are fishing for is fun and a trophy. Many muskie tournaments are now using judge boats to save on transporting the muskies, they are keeped boatside in a net and a judge boat is called to come and measure the fish that is released right away. I know as a matter of fact the PMTT gives out bonus points for a good release.I can tell you that an instant release tournament like the ones from Muskies Canada have no effect on the fishing any more then a busy weekend.Honor means they are taking your word for it, if you lie you are the one who has to deal with it. Most guys have cameras on board so pictures are available most times. I actualy have a digital camera and was showing off the fish pictures that same afternoon.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com"
521269,Guest,2002-06-16 08:36:00,0,"Richard was fishing a DERBY not a tournament.There is a huge difference.There are no tournaments in Canada other than a small one on the St.Lawerence,the St.Clair one is based out of the states.In his rush to tell you of his alledged 50 incher Richard should have made himself more clear.MC opposes tournaments as far as I know.Heard the 46 incher was as skinny as a rake...."
521270,Trophymuskie,2002-06-18 18:33:00,254,"COWARDIf you are going to make some false accusations of anyone please have the guts to sign your name. For your information you are acusing my fishing partner of stretching the measurement as I was at the start of the tape.BTW you have never seen a 50 even less a skinny one and I boat way more fish over 50 every year then you ever will in your lifetime.Get a life, and for your information fishing has been a blast the last 5 days, we contacted over 10 fish today alone but botched two and only landed one.Forgot to thank you for all the extra attention your jealousy will bring me. :-)Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com"
521271,Guest,2002-06-19 08:47:00,0,"To OgoPogoTo the person who is contesting the size of Richard's 50"" fish from Pigeon. I measured it, twice, and can tell you that it was indeed 50"".What is the purpose of your posting? It seems to me that someone is looking for advice on fishing in Pigeon and I don't see how your posting helps at all. Do you have any advice to give? Do you have any good stories you would like to relay about fishing on Pigeon?I have gone to Pigeon and fished with Richard 3 times. Once for the Toronto chapter outing (tournament, outing, derby..... they are all contests between anglers with quantifiable results), and twice for the Can/Am. We caught 15 fish on our first trip, 20 on our second, and less on this one. I don't believe that anyone at either of the Can/Ams registered anything close to the number of fish that we caught. This past outing, we did not do well for numbers, but did catch the biggest fish.Ogopogo - Why don't you sign your name? Children who smear clean walls with ugly graffiti don't sign their name. Honest grown ups do.If you put your photo album from last year up against Richards I believe we would sort out who has the expertise and who is just a name caller. Richard posts the pics of his guests fish on his site. It is there for all to see. Good luck"
