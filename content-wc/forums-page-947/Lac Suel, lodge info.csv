We have a group of 12 guys looking for a place to go and trying to narrow it down to the north end or south end and any lodging that you have stayed at. Any info would help us out Thank-you and hoping to hear from anyone, we where looking at evergreen lodge, but open to any good suggestions."
521450,the badger,2002-06-16 09:15:00,0,I recommend Goose Bay Camp just south of Ear Falls. Andrea Langford is the owner and a very nice person to work with. Good comfy cabins not luxury.Camp has been in her family for many years so she knows the area and the lake very well.Prices resonable and competetive with the area.I love the smell of fish guts in the morning.

521451,Stillwater,2002-06-16 12:54:00,87,"You didn't mention which end of the lake you were staying at and evergreen lodge didn't give me a clue. But, I have been up to Lac Suel 3 times, 2 of those times were at Anderson's Lodge in Sioux Lookout, excellent place. We stayed in their rooms overnight and then went out to their outpost cabins. I don't think their outpost cabins can hold 12 guys, but their main lodge can, it's all fairly new, very nice place. I have 2 phone numbers here if your interested.Anderson's Lodge -- 1-807-737-1279Anderson's Lodge Reservations -- (Toll Free) -- 1-800-465-1098"

The walleye migrate down the lake and during July-Sept the quanity of eyes are that way. Meaning long boat rides to really get onto the fish. July-Sept would recommend camps further down the lake. Scout bay resort, Lac Suel Lodge and Fishermans Cove to name a few. Those camps are closer to some of the better action."

Call Dan at the lodge to see if they have any openings. can't put my hand on the phone, try LacSeul Lodge on Due north's web page or Email me & I'll dig out the #"
521454,Guest,2002-06-17 03:52:00,0,Have tried Evergreen and found the folks very helpfull. Evergreen is located on the nw corner of lacseul and is the place we go for the summer. Found July to be the most consistant month and fishing is close to camp. Not far to go even with my 200 opti. We aren't traveling all the way down the lake and easy to navigate. Give pat and Gary a call 1 888 522 7385. Excellant cabins and quality fishing all year. My wife and I are here all year and find the fishing great throughout the summer.

521456,Guest,2002-06-17 07:54:00,0,"Just got back from Lac Seul Lodge. We caught tons of fish and two Walleyes over 30"". The accomadations are great and the service is the best. Dan can put you on fish and if you want he has guides avaliable."
521457,Guest,2002-06-17 10:05:00,0,"We just returned from Lac Seul. Stayed at Anderson's Lodge. Great accomodations, service and fishing. Would highly recommend and return there myself. Good Luck."
521458,lunker99,2002-06-18 18:56:00,236,"We have been going to Golden Fawn lodge in the Ear Falls (NW) region of Lac Suel. This area is pretty productive in late may/early june. Fished up there last week and caught several nice fish up to 28"". 12 people can easily fit into two cabins and the total cost for trip is about $500/person."
