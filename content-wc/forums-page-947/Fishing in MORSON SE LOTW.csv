521525,Fuzz,2002-06-18 08:08:00,85,"DRO-We were on Alexandria Island just North of Big Island, about 10 miles West of Painted Rock Channel last week, June 9-13. We were there during the bad weather. Considering the wild weather, we did real well. Prior to our arrival, they were biting in 8-12' of water on the sandy bays and along shoreline. Our weather drove them deeper. We caught our fish on deep reefs- 25'deep, more of a summer pattern. We caught nice size fish, but not big numbers. Biggest fish in our group was 28""-7.5# and it looked thin like it had just spawned out. We released her. In fact some of our fish still had eggs. We still marked fish in the shallow water on our electronics but they wouldn't bite due to the wild and crazy weather probably. If its a warm stable week this week, my guess is the fish will begin to bite again in the shallow bays. The roads are open, but one lane and rough in several places. Plan on some extra time getting to Morson.Have a good trip."
