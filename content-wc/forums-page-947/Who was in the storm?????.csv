521487,Guest,2002-06-17 08:30:00,0,I was on the english river system during this torrential rain and hurricane force winds with vivid lighting it was a real treat!! There was trees down everywhere people lost there cabins and boats i even seen a few islands close to us that lost almost all there tree's! Its scary when your on an island with no communcation and severe weather hits like this! I saw the bark being peeled off the trees just infront of me. Needless to say the fishing suffered as well... The lake was so turned up that it was all mud the next day.. We were on a 5 day fishing trip and maybe had 2 1/2 days of fishing. Well at least i can say i was in the storm of the century...Thats what the locals in nestor falls are calling it anyway and i beleive them!!
521488,Guest,2002-06-17 10:15:00,0,That was the longest lasting storm...being that intense i have ever been through!!!!!
521489,Guest,2002-06-17 11:30:00,0,"I have never had to bail out my boat as much as i did last weekend that was crazy. We also had a lighting strike a tree about 40 yards away from the cabin while i was on the deck ,talk about your hair standing on end and hitting the ground!!"
521490,czy42strokes,2002-06-17 15:03:00,419,I was up north in Ear Falls area and saw the aftermath of the storm Friday when we headed out. Unbelievable...Luckily the road crews had enough of the roads repaired when we headed south. Only had a small detour at Nestor Falls. We had mist and rain most of the week. Must have been on the edge of storm where we were at.

521492,Terry,2002-06-18 05:36:00,63,Was in the center of the storm. All five of us had never been in a storm that was so intense. Luckily our cabin was stout and high enough above normal lake level not to be affected (water level rose at least five feet). Our dock washed away but we had already pulled our boats up on shore and secured them to trees. Didnt get to fish until the last three days and it was slow.

521495,duffy,2002-06-18 08:59:00,49,I was north of red lake that week and although it was pouring in red lake we had good weather and great fishing 135 miles north of red lake. We must have been on the very northern edge of it. We had overcast skies and one day it drizzled for half the day but nothing like you guys are describing. Thank god. Better luck with weather next time guys sorry to hear about this mess. Thank god you all seem to be safe.Duffy
