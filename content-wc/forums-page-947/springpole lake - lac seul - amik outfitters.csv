520944,Fuzz,2002-06-17 13:03:00,85,"Have not been to Springpole, but have been to Findley and Lorrie with Amik out of Ear Falls. Both these lakes had large numbers of fish, with a few large ones but mostly 1-2 pounders.........but huge numbers of fish. Fun, fun, fun! We did best on both lakes fishing the river currents where small lakes connect. Best where the river dumps into the lake or below rapids. If Springpole has this situation, I'd head to the rivers between the lakes and start there. Good luck."
520945,phishfearme,2002-06-18 07:40:00,1242,"fuzz - thanks for the feedback. loree and findlay are on our list for future trips they're a tad pricey though. how were they on weight limits?thanks,phish"
520946,Fuzz,2002-06-18 07:55:00,85,"I don't recall what the weight limits were. I was fortunate in that my trips there were on company outings. I know that they flew the ""beverages"" in separately. The owner of the company just got back from Lorrie last week and had another great trip.....caught boat loads of walleyes. The key for you will be to look for current....find where the rivers are and fish current and you'll do well. We even caught a bunch at a river inlet to a lake on slip bobbers, so if you want some REAL fun take along some slip bobber gear. I don't know about you, but I still get a blast out of seeing that bobber go under. And it's not like a crappie biting.......that slip bobber looks like it gets sucked into a black hole when those 3 pounders take it. Wish I was going with you. Find and fish the CURRENT, hold on, and Have fun!Fuzz"
520947,Fuzz,2002-06-18 08:01:00,85,"Forgot to mention that if you find the current and if it's the same situation as Lorrie and Findley, the walleye were basically stacked up in the current waiting for bait to come by, so we fished them almost vertical, floating downstream slightly with jigs/twister tails and/or spinner rigs with salted minnows. When slip bobbering we used a small jig with a leach and casted up stream and let the bait move through the area where we knew fish were stacked. Keep the bait a foot or two off bottom.You can also slow troll in the rivers with Husky Jerks, or other shallow running plugs. At least the rivers where we fished were less than 10' deep so the shallow plugs worked better. Caught Northern this way too.We had several incidents where while reeling in a 1-2# walleye a 10-15# Northern ate the walleye and we caught the Northern. FUN!Fuzz"
520948,phishfearme,2002-06-19 07:49:00,1242,"fuzz - i hear you loud and clear about moving water - especially where it enters a lake. the birch river flows from birch lake to satterly lake to cromarty lake then into springpole and all of these are accessible. furthermore - bertha lake and seagraves lake flows into cromarty. this is one of the main reasons we chose springpole - that along with it's one basin being a deep ""top-end"" (no flow) lake with lakers over 20 pounds.i'll post a results when we return.phish"
