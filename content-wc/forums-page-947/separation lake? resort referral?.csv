Since no one else responded, I will try to answer your question. I went up there last summer in August and am going back again this August.If you are looking for a remote drive-in resort, this is the one.They have a resort on Separation Lake and also a small campground that is the loading site for the boat trip to the resort. I stay at the campground and have not stayed at the resort, but I can tell you that the fishing is great, whether you fish the lake or drop down into the river to fish. They have very new equipment and really bust their tails trying to take care on each customer. I used the guide at the campground one day and he was great.If I can be of further help, please e-mail me.Dave"
