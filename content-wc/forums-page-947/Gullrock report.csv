521482,Guest,2002-06-18 15:21:00,0,"we were there from june 8-14. The fishing was pretty slow because of the weather. We dont fish for walleye that much, the guys with the live bait were doing OK late in the week, the water was too cold, the fish were all deep. Crowds were gathered on the first point southwest of Ranger Bay. Ranger lake was ""closed"" to those of us with dignity. The MNR asked the resort owners to have people stay out and not bother the walleyes still on their beds, but there were those who went in anyway. Few Northerns but I personally did ok on larger ones, a 31"", 33"", 36"", and a 44""!"
521484,Guest,2002-06-19 08:38:00,0,"Jeff- I am heading up Friday. Talked to Mike Weaver on Sunday. Tons of walleyes are still in Ranger, their spawning grounds. Water temp 54. I see that this week is warming up, so hopefully we will hit it well. I will let you know when we get back"
521483,jeff,2002-06-19 11:27:00,99,Where did you get the nice northerns?Jeff
521485,Guest,2002-06-19 13:44:00,0,"I like to fish the shallows on the far end of 2 island, theres a small narrow,shallow channel that goes in a couple hundred yards, there is deeper water with weeds further out from shore that held the northerns also. Another good place is right when you enter 2 island, Theres a big green Buoy on the first point as you enter, the shallows just to the right of that buoy as you enter is great also, weeds are in 6-8 feet of water about 100-300 yards from shore. Hope that helps, lemme know if they work for you"
521486,Guest,2002-06-20 05:44:00,0,"Thank You for your reply, I am going to try two island this year for northerns hopefully some picture fish and then release. I also am going to try this lake for walleye, never have fished it before.ThanksJeff"
