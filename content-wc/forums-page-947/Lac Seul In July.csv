A couple of years ago we fished Lac Seul in early June and had real good luck. Is the fishing in July as good, better or worse than in June? I imagine that the weather must be alot nicer that time of the year. Does the water get as rough? Any input would be of great help to me. Thanks W.H"

Also, flats in the evening will produce nicely.The weather is usually hotter and the bugs can be really bad. I believe the weather is more stable with less strong winds, etc. All depends.Hope you have a great trip but expect the fishing to be a bit different that in the spring. Walleye's should be on reefs and humps also, and a little deeper than usual.Good Luck...eye_snatcher"

I think the key to mid-summer unless it is cloudy is to get out early, take a break between noon and 4 pm, then head back out. Walleyes will be easily found around Cox'x Island and surrounding structrue. The islands and main channel points in Steamboat Bay hold lots of W's. Agressively troll spinners and minnows. I personally have stopped going to Lac Suel in the spring and now visit either in late July and August. There are less total fish, (about 20% less) but the quality of the trip is so much better.TGG"

You will be amazed at what you can find in there. Good luck and have a safe trip."
521147,Guest,2002-06-14 20:02:00,0,Agree with the other 2 posts. Have fished LS for about 20 years and much prefer the Jul Aug time. Much better weather which for us means a lot.Usually catch walleyes in 12-14 feet trolling spinner. Use only worms and leeches now. They catch just as many and last times longer with a fraction of the expense.Gold and copper spinner seem to work the best. Have had the best luck trolling outside of weed beds
521148,Guest,2002-06-19 20:01:00,0,"I have fished the lake for 16 years also. For the last 12 years made sure I fished the same week each time,1st or 2nd week In july.I now catch as many fish per day as when I went 1st week of june.The weather for the most part is more stable howevever there has been many days that the rain gear doesn't come off and it takes a piece of canvas over the fire for shore lunch!"
