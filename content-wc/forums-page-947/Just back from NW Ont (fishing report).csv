I'd like to thank those who posted helpful hints on this site which I was able to really use especially the slip bobber idea.Excellent number of 3-5 lb walleyes. About evenly divided between slip bobbers and jigs(orange buck w/ orange tail & Chart buck with Chart tail) with minnows. Most fish were still shallow 6-9 feet. We picked up a couple of Lakers in ~8 feet of water which was fun. Might want to go a week earlier next year to see if the Lakers might be shallow in greater numbers. Found Northerns spread between 6 feet and even caught a couple of 12+ lbers in 40+ while fishing Lakers.Great Trip. Personally 50+ 3lb-5 lb Walleyes in 4 1/2 days dozens of smaller/northerns/lakers. Crumby Weather... Tuesday night was something else fully expected to see a couple of the docked boat sunk by morning winds had to be over 45 mph.Fish in shallows with tentative bite = great fun with slip bobbers.Brett"
