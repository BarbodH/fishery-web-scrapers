521474,Guest,2002-06-16 09:25:00,0,best advise I can give you is leave them home and go with the guys!}>
521475,lobo1,2002-06-16 15:30:00,734,Just hope for the best and don't expect the trip to go as you have planned it in your mind. Inevitabley something will go wrong and won't work out as you have planned. Take whatever fishing time you expect and cut it in half.Besides just going with the guys your next best option is to set your expectations low (for fishing anyhow) and that way you won't be disappointed when you spend most of your time on the beach or in town. Quality time any way you slice it.good luck - you'll have a great time and will make some bonds that are lacking in todays world.lobo

You just need patience and you will have great times together. You will have more lasting memories with them than ALWAYS with the guys........For the post from Bob, you sound like a very unhappy person. Family is really the most important thing."
521477,Guest,2002-06-18 14:19:00,0,I agree!I go every year with my wife and kids. Great times. Wouldn't have it any other way. I go in august when the tempts. are warmer. Larry.

But you are coming to another country, even tho, we are much alike. You'll have to give them a ""mall"" or ""shopping"" fix somehow. As for TV, sometimes sitting around a camp fire at night watching the embers sear away (throwing an aluminum beer can in and watch it melt is equivelant to a channel change)underneath a blanket of stars could be just as entertaining.If your trip is an outdoor/camping exersion, ensure that your family has the right clothes, bring something for when you go to town for the ""mall"" fix. Mother nature doesn't care about fashion.Points of intersts breaks up the boredom of a trip, exposes your family to ""foreign"" people.As for fishing, don't concentrate on a certain species, make sure they catch something! Anything! Get them interested, whether it be perch, bullhead or walleye, get them to catch anything!And if you're by the campfire with just your wife.......make sure she remembers that night with a smile!"
521479,Guest,2002-06-18 14:42:00,0,Leave them with the nearly maxed out credit card! Take the good credit card and head up with the boys. The only crying you will here with the boys is if you run out of the cold stuff. You have the rest of the year with the family 360 days!!
