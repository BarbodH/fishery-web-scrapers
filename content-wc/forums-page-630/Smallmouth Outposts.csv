Otherwise, there are lots of flyout lakes in NW Ontario, north of the Rainy River and east of Nestor Falls that hold lots of bass in some crystal clear lakes. The typical bass lake in this area is also a pike and lake trout lake. there are lakes with a billion small bass, and some with fewer big bass, make sure which type you're getting into. I would reccomend Tinkers Places out of Nestor Falls."

This is what started the whole thread - the intent to find lakes you can catch good numbers of QUALITY, 16"" + bass. I've been to a number - I'm willing to share in return for the same. Two I'd highly recommend-Rex Lake and Wingiskis Lake. Email me direct for details - thanks."

569584,crawdad1974,2007-10-19 10:57:00,3,Hi!! I have booked a trip to Minnitaki for the last week in June. Was wondering what to expect up there (never been to Canada) in terms of smallmouth this time of yr. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
569611,Guest,2007-10-22 15:02:00,0,"Bass.....if your looking for big bass with good numbers than REX is definately the lake you want. That lake is pretty well booked all summer but you never know, someone might have cancelled. There is only one cabin on the lake."

Don't care if there are walleye available (although we love to fish, and eat, walleye too). Seems like many outfitters list smallmouth at their outposts, but few and far between are the true smallmouth lakes. Any recommendations? We are looking for an 08 trip. Please post or email me directly - [email protected] - if you know of any outposts. Truly enjoy this site and the sharing. Basser"
