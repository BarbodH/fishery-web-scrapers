569721,Guest,2007-11-05 12:46:00,0,"Actually the inquiry ""Best Bait on Lac Seul in June"" is a topic that is proper at any time regardless of the year. It would be rational to assume that anyone reading this thread would be interested in others opinons on the subject. FOR EXAMPLE: Last year in June we caught the majority of our Walleye on Crawlers/Jig and Crawlers/Lindy Rig. While years past it has been Minnow/Jig. Good Luck"

538665,Guest,2004-04-06 20:34:00,0,"Was lucky enough too fish Lac Seul last year 2nd week of June. Caught more walleye the first 3 days then we had caught the previous last 2 years at other lakes in Ontario, including a fly out. Caught most on bottom bouncers with crawlers or minnows. Bought the crawlers in the US at Cabelas, first year that we ran out of 500. Between the 6 of us we caught well over 1000 walleye. Was an incredible week, bought my first boat today and will be bringing it up there in June. Can't wait. More on the bait, leeches were working also. SO were artificials. Fishing is amazing up there, still searching for that trophy. If any one has any hotspots out of Ear Falls area would love the info or coordinances(that may be spelled wrong) we fished outside of the resorvoir on the flats most of the week. Several 5 pounders, nothing bigger. 2 months left, money saved, bring on the walleye!"
538666,Guest,2004-04-06 23:03:00,0,dont forget below the dam. great fishing there too.
538669,Big Tim,2004-04-07 08:50:00,63,Below the dam is great for those days the wind makes it iffy to go out on the main lake. Saved our shore lunch plans last year!
538674,Guest,2004-04-07 14:52:00,0,Work the islands around Ghost this time of year if you can make the run from the ear falls area. Just work the windy side of the islands real slow with bottom bouncers and choice of live bait. I prefer minnows.

538745,Guest,2004-04-10 18:05:00,0,"When the fishing is ""reel"" good in June I go right to the power baits and do just as well as the rest of our party. I prefer a white 1/4 oz glow jig and white 3"" twister tail. Last year 3 of us in the boat for a morning caught 104 eyes in about 4 hours. I caught more with the powerbait than the other 2 guys using leeches. Most of these fish were the 15-26"" variety too. The trick is to try to wipe the smile off your face from all the fun. We're gettin antsy for our June 16-20 trip this year. Guide07"

569641,Guest,2007-10-25 03:30:00,0,If you can believe what you read on this site about the lake.....just stand on shore any where with a bare hook and you will be busy throwing back hundreds of walleye.....5 to 20 pounders.
569643,Guest,2007-10-25 08:30:00,0,"While Lac Seul is not a good enough fishing lake to just stand on the bank with a bare hook and catch 5-20lb Walleye it is good enough to build some awesome fishing memories. I know those of you who haven't been there have heard about its bounty of fish and I will tell you that it is what people say it is. We have two groups who go every year and a average week (5 days) for us with both groups (6 fisherman)produces 1200 to 1800 Walleye per week. As a bonus we will catch Smallies in the 16"" to 19"" range and each of the last four years we have landed Pike over 40"" with the biggest being 44"". These bonus Smallie and Pike are caught while Walleye fishing. Lac Seul is also blessed with some great Resorts and wonderful hosts. If there is a problem with Lac Seul it is the fact that the Resorts have a large repeat business and it can be tough to get into the Resorts. If you want to go to Lac Seul in 2008 you need to get your name in the hat ASAP."

538165,Guest,2004-03-15 08:00:00,0,"Going to Lac Seul for the first time this year (second week June). Would like to hear what your opinion is as to what is the best June bait for Walleye on Lac Seul and what technique works best....Thanks, Alex"
538166,Guest,2004-03-15 08:20:00,0,"Hey, good choice on lakes. We brought a flat of night-crawlers and some salted minnows. We trolled the night-crawlers on lindy rigs 90% of the time, with huge success. Trolled cranks the rest of the time, with great success as well. We never jigged, we never used live minnows. The salted minnows were tossed after two days, when we realized the night-crawlers were a blessing from god."
538167,Guest,2004-03-15 09:20:00,0,Hi. where did you get the flat of crawlers up there and what part of the lake were you in.? thanks
538171,Guest,2004-03-15 10:41:00,0,"I am not sure where you are coming from, but we picked ours up on the way up: Sportsmans HQ's in Minong, WI."
538173,Guest,2004-03-15 13:00:00,0,We fish Lac Seul the first week in June. Most of our fish come on jig/minnow combo with the best colors being char/white/pink/orange. Best luck with the jigs comes in 3 to 10 ft of water focusing on windy points and island sides close to deep water. We also drag cranks on flats in 10 to 15 ft of water. The crank presentation helps locate fish so we can jig fish. In early June you will be catching fish that are in transition from spawning areas to main lake. Fish the area closest to likely spawning spots and work your way out to main lake area. Most of our luck that time of year comes on spots within 500 yds of main shore close to deeper water.The wind is your best fishing buddy on Lac Seul find his spots and fish SSLLLOOOOWWWWW.. If you see Barney on the Lake ...he will be glad to help you...he is the best.
538190,Guest,2004-03-16 14:33:00,0,"Every year I go to Canada I bring my own crawlers. If you want to cross the border with them they have to be in paper bedding. They will not allow crawlers in dirt. I buy my worms 1-2 weeks ahead of my trip and transfer them to Buss bedding. After a week in that stuff, they get big and fat. Better that anything you will buy. I get them from Minnesota Leech, they ship live bait so you can call them and order a flat. Minnesota Leeches 3157 South Howell Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53207 (414) 744-2077"
538215,Guest,2004-03-17 15:37:00,0,Cabelas has flats of night crawlers. Has anyone tried those and is the bedding they are in sufficient to cross the border? Thanks..eyesnatcher
538219,Guest,2004-03-17 17:47:00,0,"Good call! I forgot to mention that as well, the flat we picked up on the way up there had the nightcrawlers already in worm bedding - and they were big fat suckers too. Off subject questions; If we take more than the alloted booze along with us (2 guys), and they ask us how much we have, and we tell them how much (say one bottle per person extra), where do they make us pay the tax? Is it at the actual crossing station?"
