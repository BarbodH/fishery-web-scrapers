Only couple rainy days and wind stayed down. Caught about 150 walleye in the regular fall spots, fishing for them a couple hours each day. Average size was 14-15"", and many up around 17-18"". Got 3 muskies trolling the rocky shoreline breaks in 12-20' with 10"" Jakes. We got a 38, 42 and 46. Pics are uploaded in the Members Gallery under rockpt. Beautiful fall colors on the trees, saw many bald eagles, lots of ducks and geese moving south on the migration, and a constant fire in the wood stove. Classic fall trip to NW Ontario. Trips like this get me through the long winter."

569650,Guest,2007-10-25 14:03:00,0,rockpt Did you go after any of those slab crappies? Were they still getting them up in thompson creek and the elbow? Sounds like you had a good trip and maybe we will run into each other sometime up there. Brett
569651,rockpt,2007-10-25 14:35:00,589,"Brett, I heard the crappie were biting well in the usual fall areas, but we never went after them on this trip. I'm a little embarrassed to say that I hate cleaning crappie (and ain't that great at it) and our camp had sent the dockboy home for the week since my wife and I were the only guests in camp. So, we kept busy catching walleye and hunting muskie. I run a Crestliner 192 DC with a 200 EFI and Pro Kicker. Stop by if you see us on the lake."
569668,Guest,2007-10-28 12:47:00,0,"we just got back from a week in miles bay. stayed with the tolton's at miles bay camp. we were primarily hunting ducks, but there were no bluebills anywhere. we looked all up and down the basil channel, north of big island area and north of that to mac phearson's island area and boggy bay. no bills. fishing in miles bay was ok for walleyes and a few big perch. caught a 7# walleye. no crappies though. we heard they had been netted pretty heavily in miles by the indians this fall. didn't try the elbow area. we trolled some for musky but no takers. can't beat lotw in the fall. weather was very nice. warm and sunny. last year same time we had snow every night and water was froze in camp. i'd be interested to hear if anyone sees any bills later this fall anywhere up there. cheers, br"
569676,Guest,2007-10-30 07:57:00,0,"I fished crappies 3rd week of sept. up at thompson creek area, did very well. Did not see any nets, maybe I was looking in the wrong spot for nets. Brett"
