My brother and I are taking our dad and uncles for their first real fishing trip anywhere, and that is to Minnitaki. We are all very avid fiherman but most of it has been done here in Iowa for my dad and uncles, anyway. It is very important for us to see them catch fish. The problem is that these guys are mainly bass and northern fisherman and really have no idea about walleye fishing. Ya know, the cast to the structure types. I would love to dee these guys succeed at this and was wondering what to expect as far as shallow water casting type of fishing for smallmouth, northern, walleye, etc at this time of yr? Is it too early for bass?? I have investigated alot and plan on getting some guide help as far as walleye go, but would also like to enjoy just ""fishing on our own"" for some smallies and pike, any insight or help would be greatly appreciayed. Not only for Minnitaki but early Canada fishing in general. I have no idea what to expect the last week of May. Water temp, air temp, spawning info, etc??? Thanks alot in advance."

And, we have caught some excellent size Pike incidental to walleye fishing. I will tell you in the first few years we did some casting for smallmouth and caught them so infrequently we stopped trying. We have seen them, the smallies are there, it is just not an easy bite. (maybe it is us). Walleye, jigs, spinners, trolling of drifting over flats/humps has always worked well. It is not the lake I would go for smallmouth. But it does offer a lot of options, walleye, pike, smalls and lake trout."
