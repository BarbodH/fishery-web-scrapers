Unfortunately that day we didnt catch anything over 10, but you're right, as soon as it got dark we definitely got into more fish. Glad to hear you had a good time at Nipawin. I live an hour away, which is likley a good thing. If I lived in Nipawin, I'm sure my wife would be looking for those divorce papers! Haha....."

569757,Guest,2007-11-06 18:34:00,0,"Had really good fishing this past weekend on the river. Between the two of us we caught just under 90 walleye. About half of them were between 5 and 9 pounds. We had a couple just over 10 pounds and the biggest was 12.5 pounds. The rest of the fish we caught we mostly are 3 pounds, just beautifull slot fish 50 to 55 cm. Then we had a some smaller ones around that 1 to 2 pound range. But it was really an awesome weekend. The weather was around +5 on Saturday and 0 on Sunday. Might go again this weekend if the weather is half decent."
569759,Topwater,2007-11-06 19:59:00,484,Luke I have a question for you. can you email me thanx Steve[email protected]
569616,Johnnie Candle,2007-10-22 19:58:00,1037,Any reports from the weekend? I am heading that way on the 28th and would like to keep up with the latest information. Thanks.
569618,Guest,2007-10-23 08:39:00,0,Johnnie I was there Oct 14-20. Wife and I did OK.....6 fish over 10lbs...a lot of 6-8 lbers. Most came on long lindys with leeches. Only 1 big fish on a crank but it was the biggest of the trip 12.5lbs. Cranking was slow.....I think we only caught 1 fish after dark too which is kinda strange. Hope you have leeches lined up up there....they are hard to come by in Nipawin. Good luck. Clarkie
569619,Dave Q,2007-10-23 09:18:00,1003,"thanks for the update ""clarkie"" I have been unable to get up....still dreaming i might get up but.... good to hear you did o.k. how would you compare it to other years on average?"
569620,Guest,2007-10-23 14:40:00,0,I would say pretty similar.....some days were better than others. I personally caught a lot more big fish on bait this year....the crankbait bite wasn't on like other years IMO. We weren't there during full moon like other years either...maybe that had something to do with it. I did better this year...usually I get outfished by the wife....but not this year!! :) Weather was sure better this year than last!! Clarkie
569628,Dave Q,2007-10-24 08:32:00,1003,Thanks for the report.
569655,Johnnie Candle,2007-10-25 21:54:00,1037,"Yes, Thanks for the report. I have a few friends up here right now and there very brief report sounds good. It costs a ton to talk on a US cell phone up there. The crank bite has picked up a bit but I do not know if it is during the day or at night. I'll let everyone know how it goes for us."
569675,Guest,2007-10-29 20:32:00,0,"Going to tobin for a couple days, not on the river i dont think but we are fishing pike. Where is a good area for pike this time of year. Thanks so much."
569680,uzzi,2007-10-30 16:24:00,349,"Johnnie, I was just curious if you were fishing at Tobin on Monday Oct 29th? Do you have the Crestliner with all the Scheels graphics, etc on it? Just curious, was out that day as well, 2 of us in the red Lund 1950 Tyee. Did you have a good trip? We had a pretty good day, lots in the slot, 4-5 right at the slot (53-54.5 cm), lots under, but no overs. Fished till about 645pm and headed for home. Spoke to the guys in the white Lund (from Minot), they had a good day too, lots in and under the slot, no overs either. They said they got a 12# right at dark, which is a nice slot fish. I live close to Tobin so I get to fish it all the time, hoping you had a good trip and got treated well at Nipawin. What was the biggest of the trip?"
569702,Johnnie Candle,2007-11-02 08:25:00,1037,"We did well for the trip. Fished Mon, Tues, and Wed. I saw you gus were fishing bait. We did nothing but troll. Our best bait by far was the Purpledescent Deep Tail Dancer #11. Close second was a Blueberry muffin Reef Runner. We fished the same water as you. During the day it was slower with a lot of smaller fish. Once the sun set it was like a switched turned on and teh big fish went nuts. In three days we boated 8 fish over 10 pound but 5 0f those were over 12. The biggest went 12.9. All of them were weighed on a digital scale. If I lived there, I would never be able to have a real life. All of my time would be spent on the river. The locals in Nipawin are first class. We spent what was left of Halloween at Thirsty's and had a blast. You have a gem of a fishery there and I will be back."

569461,Guest,2007-10-12 14:32:00,0,Going to Tobin 10-25 thru 10-31 could i please get some tips before i get there? Thanks
569463,KidWalleye,2007-10-12 19:07:00,557,"I just got back from tobin thursday. fishing was pretty slow while we were up there. we stayed at the green grove in nipawin ($70 a night for a 2 bed room) and used the twin marina ramps. drifting leaches in 18-25 feet of water worked the best for us. If i was you i would look for good sized leaches in some of the towns on our way up as the ones you get in nipawin are pretty small. we had some luck pulling crank baits early in the morn like before sun came up and late at night like 7pm to 10 pm all in the same depth range as drifting. my fav crank was a red headed bomber but reef runners seemed to produce more fish-- yellow & red wonder bread, orange crush, texas red, and spotted sun. but the people running the marina said that the fishing some of the worst that they could remember. but long days paid off for us as we got 1. 31"" 2. 29"" and five or six between 25"" and 27"" and enuf out of the slot limit to eat fish every night.. a few other reminders we did not know 1. must use barbless hooks you can just pinch your barb over 2. 3 fish a day per person on tobin lake or river 3. slot limit is 21.5 inches to 33.5 "" everthing between must go back and can only have one over 33.5"" thats all i can think of right now any more questions just ask and ill try to answer if i can Gary"
569465,Guest,2007-10-12 21:38:00,0,Gary Glad to hear you had a decent trip...we are headed up in the AM. Clarkie
569472,Guest,2007-10-13 19:27:00,0,Got back yesterday after 5 days of fishing. Been going for 17 years and nobody could ever remember it being that tough there. The previous posts' advice is as good as any.. I wish I knew what triggered the lockjaw.....

569510,Guest,2007-10-16 18:06:00,0,Hey guys did you find that the morning or evening bite was better? I'm going tomorrow and want to try for both pike and walleye and trying to decide if i should go after eyes in the morning or evening... Thanks!

569512,KidWalleye,2007-10-16 20:26:00,557,Its been over a week sence ive been there but all most all the fish we cought on cranks was early morn like from dark to probly an hour after sun up then we switched to live bait all afternoon. then from about 4-6 we started catchng walleye again. we didnt pull cranks in the evening tell almost dark tell about 10. but like i said that could have changed by now. I will say for catching the pike you will want to fish the lake. the closer we got to the lake the more pike we started catching. we caught all our pike pulling cranks. Good luck Gary

569573,Pikeman,2007-10-18 12:48:00,93,"I gave Tobin a shot yesterday. Dead slow, no one else was catching anything ether, saw one big one caught in the morning. Couldn't even get any pike to go in the lake. Not sure why it's so slow."
