569717,Pikeman,2007-11-04 12:50:00,93,"Hey Kidwalleye, It all depends on where you live in the province. If you are near Saskatoon, Blackstrap actually has a lot of great ice fishing oppurtunities. Not any outfitters there, but if you park your vehicle in Shields townsite you can easily walk out onn the ice nd have some great fishing, pike, perch and eyes. You generally won't find a lot of size, but decent numbers. If you'd like some bigger fish, Last Mountain is probably your best bet. Lot's of walleye over 10 and pike over 20 every winter. Regina beach is often a good area to start, especially late in the ice season (March). G&S Marina outfitters is a good bet for info, look them up on google. If you're farther North, Tobin is unbelievable for big pike. Most fish close to the resort, and you'll be able to see a good number of shacks to get an indication of where to fish. If you need anymore help you can email me: [email protected]. Hope this helps a bit! Travis"

569748,Waxy,2007-11-05 13:44:00,2938,"I think the fishing lakes around Ft. Qu'Appelle (Pasqua, Mission, Echo, Katepwa) are your best bet for ice fishing, I know that's where I've had the most success through the ice. They're decent in the summer months, generally more fish, but smaller. Last Mountain is the same story year round - big fish, but generally slow fishing. June can be really good, and there's lots of 10# plus walleye to be caught in Sept/Oct. I've never had much luck through the ice. Diefenbaker has good fishing with plenty of big fish, especially in the spring around Sask. Landing, but it's BIG lake and can get pretty hairy, you'll want a decent size boat. Of course, if you're going to northern Sask, the sky's the limit. Waxy"
