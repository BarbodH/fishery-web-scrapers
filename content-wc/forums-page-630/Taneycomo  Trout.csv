569648,Guest,2007-10-25 12:17:00,0,Couple of my buds want to make a trip to Taneycomo at Branson Missouri to do some Trout fishing. Can anybody tell me if it is worthwhile and if we can expect to catch some trout. Want to go in early November. Thanks

When they are generating water you have to drift fish, when no water is running find a deep hole and use corn...never fails to produce! Good luck."
