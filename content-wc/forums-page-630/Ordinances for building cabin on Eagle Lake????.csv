Here is the history, 4 of us fishing buddies are buying a parcel on an island on Eagle Lk. Does anyone know of any ordinances that restrict you from doing anything on a small parcel. Any help would be greatly appreciated. What about docks or septics, what is the norm in Ontario??"
569623,Trailerguy,2007-10-23 17:25:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Both docks and septic systems are subject to regulation by the Ministry. A dock actually covers a strech of the lake bottum, which is Crown Property, so you may need a work permit as well. The regulation on docks allows you to put in small one without a permit,around 3'X20' as I recall. Septics and even outhouses require a permit from the Ministry and rules are quite complex. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
569625,Guest,2007-10-23 21:51:00,0,"If the island is within the municipality of Machin then you should be contacting them as far as requirements regarding building permits, septic systems, etc. They have a website....google it. Any work on shorelines or in the water require MNR permits. Septic systems require approval from the NW Health Unit.......there is one in Dryden, also Kenora. You may want to research some of this before you commit yourself. An island also requires shore access and parking....public launches are few and not particularly secure."
569626,Guest,2007-10-23 22:03:00,0,"Also, some of Eagle Lake is in a designated park area and new development may be restricted. If you are refurbishing an older cabin it may be allowed. If you are building new, it may not."
569638,Guest,2007-10-24 18:42:00,0,Building permits are under Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing. Contact them with your queries.
569652,Guest,2007-10-25 16:30:00,0,"If your property is in the unorganized area, you will have to deal with the Ministry of Natural Resources and building permits are not needed. However, if you are planning to put in a septic field, the Northwestern Health unit must approve the septic field."
569669,Sutsgold,2007-10-28 18:30:00,219,Where on Eagle? I believe you need to go through the Municipality of Machin for all building permits. You can find there site by googling the town of vermillon bay.
569671,Guest,2007-10-29 05:15:00,0,There is also something called the Ontario Living Legacy which I understand includes part if not all of Eagle Lake. Best check into that as well. Do lots of homework.
569674,Guest,2007-10-29 15:56:00,0,The Living Legacy is the park I refered to in the earlier post. I have checked into this and there are severe restrictions if you want to develop anything in that area.
569684,Guest,2007-10-31 07:13:00,0,I'll sell you and your buddy a cabin on Red Lake! The fishing is always better at the end of the road.
