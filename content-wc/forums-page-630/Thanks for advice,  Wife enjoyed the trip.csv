569622,Guest,2007-10-23 16:38:00,0,Nice to hear your story. Lived in Menominee for 7 years but never got to do the Bay de noc fishing experience. I hear it is great this time of year. Any recommendations for fishing the big eyes this time of year?
569434,Guest,2007-10-10 09:55:00,0,"Earlier this summer I submitted a post on tips for helping wives feel comfortable on a first fishing trip. A number of you responded with helpful tips. My wife really enjoyed the trip so much that after 2 days of fishing she making statements like, ""Next year when we come ...."" Plus, she has even hinted about going for two weeks. Thank you all for your responses."
569437,Guest,2007-10-10 11:46:00,0,GREAT!!!! Where and when did you two go and did you catch some nice fish?
569438,Guest,2007-10-10 14:00:00,0,"We went to a lake near Dryden, Brown Bay Camp. The fishing was good, but I have had better. She chaught a nice small mouth, 17 in. and some nice pike and walleye. the facilities are nice (really improved in recent years) and the staff is great, friendly and run a good program. They dont put up with crazies. Now a nice camp for families."
569446,Guest,2007-10-11 09:50:00,0,This proves my point..... I've always said I'd hesitate to take my wife along on a Canadien fishing trip because I'd be afraid she'd like it and want to go again !!!!
569449,Mike Kansas,2007-10-11 10:59:00,1463,Started taking my wife to Canada 5 years ago after I had been going since 1955. She has a awesome time and would rather go to Canada than anyplace else. The only problem is that she out fishs me almost every day. This only makes her think I'm the greatest Walleye Guide in the world....which has great benifits all year long.
569513,Guest,2007-10-16 21:04:00,0,"I have to second the gentleman. I have asked several times if my wife would like to go along with me, just the 2 of us, no other guys, and she politely declines. At this point.....this is great...I ask, she declines and I get to go with the guys without any repercussions. I realize at some point she will say ""yes"" but until that day arrives ""all is right with my world"". And when that fatefull day comes, I know that it will be TWO trips a year for fishing in Canada! Is this a great world or what!!!"

569570,orchard frank,2007-10-17 21:55:00,1900,"My wife and I have been fishing together for 35 years now. We had one stretch where we went to Lac Seul for 2 weeks at a time for 13 years straight. Some of the best memories of our lives. Now we're retired and live 20 minutes from Little Bay de Noc, still hauling them in. Life is short, fish hard. Frank & Esther"
569590,Guest,2007-10-19 15:35:00,0,"I always asked my wife to go along with me but she refused. Claimed she'd have to do the cooking, cleaning, and all that other fun stuff. After assuring her that she would not have to she reluctantly agreed to go. Now she HAS to go every year and I have to make a second trip if I want to go with the boys. She loves it up there. Picking blue berries, reading, knitting, go for walks, jogging and just site seeing. Got to admit, It's more enjoyable with her than with a bunch of sloppy guys."
569601,trapper_john,2007-10-20 20:07:00,83,"My wife enjoys it up there. She is usually sitting in the boat waiting for me to get going. She has a fine touch with a jug rod. The down sid is that I keep hearing her ""oh net boy."" She's a good fishing partner."
