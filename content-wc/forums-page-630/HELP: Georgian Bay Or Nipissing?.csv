568853,Ruddiger,2007-09-09 15:04:00,649,"Howdy: I am thinking about planning my trips for next season and was thinking about one of these two bodies of water. Obviously these are huge areas (particularly the Bay) and have a lot of options as far as species are concerned. Ideally I am looking to spend about 4 weeks spread out between the May opener and Late September. Peak times would be ideal. Specifically, I am looking for a little bit of everything, with pike and walleye in the earlier part of the season and muskie and smallies in the later part. Numbers are important, with decent size fish and the potential for a trophy a plus. Initially I liked the idea of the Bay due to its size, and potential for big fish, but after reading some posts I am a bit leary of the fact that it may be a declining fishery. Nipissing also has had mixed reviews in the past as well. If you have any sugestions or experiences you can share with me it would be greatly appreciated. FYI: I live in Cleveland and am fishing out of a 620 T. Obviously rocks and boating hazzards are also a concern I would like some info on as well. Due to time and distance concerns I have tried to limit the drive to 10-12 hours from home, hence the desire to stay in central to eastern Ontario. Thanks in advance for your assistance. Ruddiger"

Walleye are usually hit or miss on Nipissing and there has been a slot in place that seems to be helping the population. Smallies can be outstanding at times. Not on par with St. Clair or Erie, but the scenery is much better."
568856,phishfearme,2007-09-09 17:56:00,1242,"rudd - i think you're about to encounter what i encountered in my search for world class fishing in eastern ontario. i live in pittsburgh (34 - 7??) and for years back in the 70's and 80's traveled to just north of sudbury to fish ramsey and bisco lakes - we stopped going there more than 15 years ago when we saw water skiers on a once very limited access lake (ramsey - portage or fly-in only) and the next year we paid for a fly-in lake with an outfitter out of chapleau only to run into 6 people who drove 3 vehicles into the lake. what i've found is that essentially all lakes in eastern ontario are accessible by car/truck and if someone tells you otherwise they just don't know the way. it seems like eastern ontario WANTS to have all of it's lakes accessable by vehicle (just like the US!!) and the associated fishing pressure. it's VERY easy for these northern lakes - and their very short growing season - to become seriously depleted after just a few years. as a result, we've been commiting to the long drive to NW ontario where you can definitly find true wilderness lakes where fish are not constantly pressured. i guess it ultimately get down to what you want - we're willing to drive the extra distance to NW ontario to get isolated, world class fishing - i sure would rather not do this drive - so if you can find something private and world class in eastern ontario, please let me know - i've given up. good luck in your search. phish"
568862,10lbeye,2007-09-10 08:45:00,61,"I have been going to Georgian bay since 1976. I can tell you that reports of its demise and declining fishery have been premature. It can be tough fishing at times(what place can't be), but this yr in June we caught almost 200 lbs of walleyes in 5 days, and we had 3 kids and a novice fisherman to boot. They instituted a slot of 16-22 inches a few yrs back and it has helped tremendously in my opinion. Last year we ran into lots of numbers of small walleyes(a very good sign) but this yr we hit both the numbers and size equation just right, including 4 10 pounders. we also caught smallies ranging from 3-5 lbs and 4 pike in the 15-20 lb class. Numbers aside, this area produces big fish. Like anywhere, you have to know where to go and eliminate bad water. We go go Georgian Bay Fish Camp, a boat in camp 18 mi out in the Bay and 5-10 minutes from the mouth of the French River. Very secluded."

568868,A Canuck,2007-09-10 13:56:00,86,"Want a chance to catch a trophy? Consider the Bay of Quinte! it is a HUGE pickeral factory.. But bring Planer Boards and all the regular trolling gear.. I have fished Nipissing all my life, and the slot certainly helped fish stocks... it is such a success infact they brought the slot to the west arm as well.. I spent two weeks on Nipissing already this summer and have 2 more booked. I mainly fish the west arm as weather conditions dont generally keep you off the water as it can on the main lake (especially on the south shores!! Look at picking up some Nipissing jigs (flat head) and add a trailer (2"" or so) fresh worms and your set.. I have easily boated 400+ this year so far (most in the slot) but I kept a couple smaller ones for the table. Cant wait to hunt the bigguns come the end of this month! A Canuck."

569754,Guest,2007-11-06 12:35:00,0,"West arm of Nipissing- last year within spitting distance of two west arm lodges we had our best year on walleyes in 30 years. Between 2 boats we caught and released almost 400 walleyes including some really big fish. We also hooked up with 2 big muskies. The fish are there. It's been my experience many of the fishermen on these waters just aren't very savy. They expect the fish to be where they were last year, etc,etc. We shared our secrets with anyone who asked as most were returning to the docks empty handed or with only a few. Only a few listened and I think many thought we were full of bs until we showed them our pictures. We caught fish after fish as boats drove right by and never stopped to inquire. Go figure. Anyhow, the west arm has plenty of eyes. There was a time when that certainly wasn't the case."
569006,Guest,2007-09-15 08:43:00,0,"Gentlemen: Thanks for the reply. I have some followup questions. Georgian Bay first. I have looked at staying at the Georgian Bay Fishing Camp before. I was particularly interested in it due to its location as it seemed to be remotely located and hopefuly had less fishing pressure. Is this a fair assumption? When are the best times to go there? Are there other regions of the bay I should consider or avoid? I was planning on trying to go on trips around the opener in May, July 4th, mid August, and late September (this is true for both waters in fact). Are these good times or should I consider other dates? The plan would be pike/walleye only in May, muskie/pike/smallies/walleye later in the season. The main focus, however, would be for muskies and big northerns. If there are better times to go to either of these bodies of water please advise. On nipissing, I was planning on staying on the northwest side of the lake. Ideally I thought it would give me access to the west arm while also having access to the bigger and hopefully less pressured waters of the main lake. Is this a good/bad approach? Boating question. Am I out of my mind to coinsider taking my boat up there, particularly to georgian bay? I have heard that the rocks are crazy but have never witnessed it first hand. Please advise. Thanks again for the help. Ruddiger"
