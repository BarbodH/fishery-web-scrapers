569631,KidWalleye,2007-10-24 10:35:00,557,Has anyone been fishing at Last Mountain? I want to make one more run north before ice up... Tobin is just a little far for me to go again this year. I will be there for sum ice fishing. But I wanted to give Last Mountain a shot... so if anyone could give me any info or tips on where to fish what to use I would be grateful... Gary Cayko

569657,T Mac,2007-10-26 09:18:00,10084,"Yup... Sorry. 307 is ,like ...Wyoming...or something. LOL"
569664,Sven,2007-10-27 11:44:00,53,A friend of mine was on Last Mountain on Tuesday Oct 23. He got a couple and missed a bunch. We are local to Last Mountain so It was just a 1/2 day trip. Hey T-Mac do you fish up here much?
569673,T Mac,2007-10-29 10:57:00,10084,"Used to hit on the way back from Tobin now and then. Haven't fished it for 6-7 years now, I'd guess."
569749,Waxy,2007-11-05 13:53:00,2938,"Based on past experience, the fishing would be pretty slow this time of year. The fall bite usually peaks around the last week of Sept through to the second week of Oct. I was there during the second week of Oct., and it had already really slowed down. The only upside is, when you hook one, chances are it's a trophy. If you do stop in, I'd also recommend G&S in Rowan's Ravine as your starting point. Concentrate on the waters between the ""white rock"" to the north and about Glen Harbour to the south, both sides of the lake. I'd focus on the points along the eastern shore between Rowan's and Glen Harbour, anywhere from 15-25' or so is generally best, but try deeper as well. Live bait Lindy rigs presented slowly and jigs presented vertically, with leeches or minnows, are most effective. The bite is VERY subtle. Bottom bouncers and spinners will also produce at times. There's some monsters to be had, so good luck. Dress warm... Waxy"
