569229,Guest,2007-09-29 10:30:00,0,Recent info on WC has stated that there are less fisherman and higher prices and less fisherman willing to go to canada...is the industry in trouble? I personally think a lot of the resorts that are on below average fishing lakes and resorts that suffer from lack of equity are going to be in trouble. I also have concern about the fact that a lot of Canada customers work in the Amercian auto industry and with the way it has crippled its employees it will hurt canada fishing even more. With the Bears playing so bad that will hurt NOBODY....GO COLTS
569230,Guest,2007-09-29 15:15:00,0,marginal camps on marginal lakes will probably be in trouble. i've been told that some already are. had an interesting conversation with an ear falls businessman last month and he was crying the blues about this past year.

Alot of places went heavily after the Canadian market and did quite well. I've seen a few places hitching themselves onto popular websites and magazines and it resulting in overcoming the losses from the dollar drop. Those who can adapt will survive, those who cannot will become extinct. It is no longer enough to simply open the doors. The internet has become likely the strongest source of referrals and those that have taken advantage of this can still do well."

569677,Guest,2007-10-30 08:35:00,0,Seems there are more a than normal amount of camps for sale.

If that is anywhere near the truth, turnover rates will account for many of the camps being on the market. I think we have a tendency to try to afix a root cause to this normal turnover. The former poster has it correct when he states that those camp owners who can adapt to the changing environment will survive..even prosper. Those who cannot will fail. This is true in all businesses, not just camps."

When fuel is $.30-.40 per gallon cheaper in Vermillion Bay and groceries are 20 - 30% cheaper in Dryden, I won't even talk hardware/lumber prices, plus the choice is much better. The people can afford to travel a distance on the savings. One item you're all familiar with, a can of Seafoam at a Red Lake and Ear Falls business was $14. I can see a little difference for shipping and at that time exchange rate (10%). Then they wonder why business is down? With the economy as it is people are pretty aware of prices. I agree the season is short but they can't expect people to pay those exhorbitant prices on anything but the necessities. They aren't as remote as they once were."
569696,Guest,2007-11-01 17:09:00,0,"Hey ""not surprising"" just wondering where you get your info. from. Groceries 20 to 30% cheaper in Dryden. What a crock. Have lived in the Red Lake/Ear Falls area for many years and know for a fact that prices are very competitive. As far as lumber and hardware go, again very little difference. If you think you can save money by running all the way to Dryden for that stuff your nuts. I have done the math on this many times and proved to many people you save next to nothing, if not costing you more...especially now with gas prices as they are. Yes if you go to that wonderfull dept. store on the East side of Dryden you can get some cheap stuff..... but remember you are getting ""cheap stuff"""
569753,Guest,2007-11-06 09:10:00,0,"Ya right. I'm not buying what you are selling. I believe in shopping local, but put a price on items that I am willing to pay over and above what that same product is being sold for in Dryden, Kenora and or Winnipeg. I don't mind paying a little more to support the local economy but don't appreciate getting ripped off. Example: This past summer I purchased a cooler and a 't' rope (for the boat) from a local merchant. It cost me 49.99 for the cooler and 18.99 for the 't' rope. The exact same products in Kenora were 29.99 and 9.99 which I discovered at a later date. Your talking a difference overall of $29.00. This is more common than uncommon. I will always make every effort to buy local but will eventually disconnect with local businesses that continue to take advantage of the local customers and then turnaround and cry the blues because people aren't shopping local. We know its costs more to transport goods to Ear Falls/Red Lake and most merchants don't have the purchasing power, but come on, don't take us for idiots....slap us in the face and then expect us to continue shopping at your store."
