569765,Guest,2007-11-07 21:36:00,0,"Yes , This year it may stay open to December? I have fished up to Nov 23 & Some of my friends have gone well into December. One friend was there yesterday & caught close to 70 fish , the best one topping 27"""
569767,Guest,2007-11-08 07:54:00,0,Yes the lake is still open and should remain that way until we see colder weather. Heading out on Lake Winnipeg this morning. The plans are to mark a few waypoints for the fast appproaching hard water season and of coarse to see if we can locate and catch a few 'eyes during the process. Good-Luck on the weekend.
