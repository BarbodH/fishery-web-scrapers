569706,Guest,2007-11-02 11:47:00,0,Have taken salted Minnows to canada many times. i would check with the lodge you are staying at to see if Salted Minnows are effective on their lake. We have used them on some lakes where they work good but the lake we now fish on you are better off with the real thing.
