Say you're in Fort Frances and you need to make that phone call that tells a loved one at home ""we made it and we're fine"" but all the stores are closed and you can't get that phone card. Not to worry. Go to the pay phone next to the gas station / bait shop on the east side of town and make a collect call. In a few weeks you will get a bill from MCI (proudly noting they are a Verizon Company) in Jacksonville, Florida. I got my bill yesterday for a 3 minute call to the northwest Chicago suburbs of $21.01, tax included. You don't have to worry about some Canadian phone company sending you a bill because MCI (a Verizon Company) clearly notes on the bill these charges will not appear on another phone company's bill. *All* your money, even the tax, will go back stateside. If we all did this, don't you think the Canadian dollar would shrink? Always happy to help. Nimstug"

But, they aren't the only phone thing that is a shocker. I have good friends in Saskatchewan whom I call a fair amount...and sometimes I forget .....and use my cell to to it.... (It's roaming). BAD IDEA!!! My wife gets the cell bill and freaks!!!"
569645,Guest,2007-10-25 10:24:00,0,"May of 2005 one of my favorite Canadians called me from a motel room phone in Red Lake. The call was collect to my office in the U.S. We talked for 19 minutes and my charge was $55. I tried to have the amount reduced by calling the motel and then, you guessed it, MCI. MCI offered to accept around $5 for the call if I agreed to use MCI for my business long distance service. I turned down the offer and got about $55 worth of rant out of my system while on the phone to the person at MCI and her supervisor. I'm looking forward to the day an MCI representative visits my office to solicit our long distance business."
569653,Guest,2007-10-25 19:35:00,0,"I suggest to our guests that they use 'time and charges'. You call 0 and your number and when asked how you want it billed, say time and charges. Call goes through and when you hang up the operator calls and lets us know the cost of the call. It is usually around 4 bucks for a 3 - 5 minute call. My concern is that I do not know if this is cheaper than collect or calling card calls and our guests think it is but.......... Any know what the cheapest way to call really is?"
569654,Nimstug,2007-10-25 20:53:00,2605,"Well, maybe to button this up, I think the phone cards are a good deal. We bought a $10 card at the F.F. Safeway and my son and I called our wifes each evening, maybe a total of a half hour a nightfor 6 nights. We had about a half hour of talk time left. I left the card with our tip for the cab cleaning crew. Close enough for being the cheapest for my purposes. Nimstug"
569656,Matches,2007-10-26 08:47:00,236,"I can relate. I've been getting ripped off by the AT&T calling card for years. I posted this in August. AT&T was charging my card 12 minutes for every minute I used. End result was they were charging me 72 cents a minute plus the 45 cents for using a pay phone. I called CiCi and was assured they don't charge bogus minutes and fees. I used it in September, and all was true what they told me. CiCi card. They email you the PIN and info. Go to this linkhttp://www.ontariophonecards.ca/ Then look for the CiCi multiple calls one. The only thing to remember, is the PIN is only good for 6 months from when you start using it. So don't over buy minutes. Best to buy right before you go to Canada."
569658,AllenW,2007-10-26 14:33:00,11482,"Ya got to be careful and read the fine print, one of the first cell phones I had said roaming was same price as regular local calls, not a bad deal so off to Red Lake Ont I went, 9 days of telling the wife how wonderful the trip and cheap calls were. Least till we got back and got our first bill...seems same price roaming was for US only and not to Canada. I think the phone bill was more than the trip...:) Al"
569659,Guest,2007-10-26 14:45:00,0,"Phone calls from the wilderness are no longer a problem. I use Onesuite and the call cost about 5 cents a minute and 55 cents for the use of the phone booth at camp. I dial an 800 number and enter my pin and then dial my home phone number. We have called relatives in Europe for a number of years. Way back when AT&T was the only thing in town, we paid 57-60 cents a minute. Now with Onesuite, we pay either 2.9 cents or 3.5 cents per minute. You can sign up online at Onesuite.com"
569760,Guest,2007-11-06 20:15:00,0,Just get an AcculinQ calling card for domestic/International calls. You can reach them at 1-800-909-7995 very inexpensive for calls home from Canada.
