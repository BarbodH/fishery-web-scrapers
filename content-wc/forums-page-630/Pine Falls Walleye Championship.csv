569708,Hawgeye,2007-11-02 12:45:00,1355,"Just to comment, it seems there is a real strong class of the 20-23"" fish in the system. This should start to produce some really nice trophy fish in around 4-5 years, maybe sooner. We were up in early October and just hammered the 21"" fish. We hope these fish make it strong past the slot so they can grow big!! The 21"" fish we were catching were footballs fat as can be!"

They should of sent a committee boat to boost the one team? ) Rumor #2 ( Rules had prefishing time to 3.00 pm Thurday & many teams fished after that ?? ) Rumor #3 ( One of the top fishing teams was dip netting shinners well after the Prefishing time ? ) Again these are only Rumors , that's why I am protecting the names of those teams?? Oh Canada"
