569756,Guest,2007-11-06 17:37:00,0,Colder weather has chased the boats off the Red. Only a few die hard shore line anglers right now.
569761,big brother,2007-11-07 05:10:00,9,Still a few of us diehards...............Mostly just waiting for the first ice to form
569762,Guest,2007-11-07 08:05:00,0,"The boys nailed it on the head....the weather is getting to nasty out there and besides it won't be long before the hard water season gets underway and by all accounts it should be incredible! For those who have never ice fished the Red but have been comptemplating a trip, this would be a great year to do so. Early ice through December is always highly productive although the river produces throughout the entire hard water season. Trophy walleye action during the month of March on Lake Winnipeg can be unrivaled."
