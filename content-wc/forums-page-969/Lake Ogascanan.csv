I pulled my own boat in to the lake. The last half of the dirt road was terible. I have been told that most of this road has been redone, but be prepared. The lake is not huge, but big enough to get rough. My opinion is that the boats they rent are undersized as in the hight of bow and sides. There were no problems with the motors that I was aware of. As far as the fishing, they imposed diferent size restrictions to let the fish grow up. We caught some small eyes with none meeting the length requirement. Again this was a few years ago. The pike fishing was not that great. Nothing big ever chased a bait and had to work hard for fish. Lakers are there. Take dipsys or keel sinkers. It is worth a day fishing for them.The weather the week we were there was down right nasty for the most part and it was a few years ago. They seemed to be concerned about improving their fishery and I hope they have. I would concidder fishing with them again because they are great hosts but would want to hear of better pike and eye action first. Have a great trip and be sure to post how you did."

I agree that the lake can get very rough at times.Brad and Ginny and the 2 boys are some of the nicest lodge owners I have ever done business with. Thats 30 years worth!!! They are very concerned about their fishery and also about their guests. We took a 16 ft. boat last time and the road wasn!t as bad as some others I have travelled but if you take it easy, you will be fine. This time we are hauling a 20ft. center console into camp.I talked to a few of last years repeat customers at the Hamburg NY show and everyone told me that the fishing was very good or they wouldn!t be going back.My wifes cousin has been going up for some 20 years in July and they slay the wallies and have taken some big pike.He wouldn!t travel that far for so many years not to catch fish!!! Like every other body of water, it takes awhile to find the hotspots. Let me know how you do in May. Good fishing! PS- I just got a full scale ( no depths though) map of the lake and its alot better than the little one they give you.It cost I think around $15 can."
