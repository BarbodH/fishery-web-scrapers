They sit and talk,frolic a little, giggle a bit, drink a bit, and shesits on his lap. He whispers in her ear and she gaspsand runs away!Seeing this, the madam sends over a more experiencedlady to entertain the gentleman. They sit and talk,frolic a little, giggle a bit, drink a bit, and shesits on his lap. He whispers in her ear and shescreams, ""No!"" and walks quickly away!The madam is surprised that this ordinary-looking manhas asked for something so outrageous that her twogirls will have nothing to do with it.She decides that only her most experienced lady, Lola,will do. Lola looks a bit tired, but she has neversaid no and it doesn't seem likely that anything wouldsurprise her. So the madam sends her over to Bob.They sit and talk, frolic a little, giggle a bit,drink a bit, and she sits on his lap. He whispers inher ear and she screams, ""NO WAY, BUDDY!"" smacks himas hard as she can and literally runs away!Madam is by now absolutely intrigued, having seennothing like this in all her years of operating abrothel. She hasn't done the bedroom work herself fora long time, but she did it for many years before shegot into management. She's sure she has said yes atone time or another to everything a man could possiblyask for. The challenge is irresistible.She just has to find out what this man has wanted thathas made her girls so angry. And she sees a chance shecan't pass up to show off to her employees how goodshe was at what they do.So, she goes over to Bob and says that she's the bestin the house and she is available. She sits and talkswith him. They frolic a bit, giggle a bit, drink alittle, and she sits in his lap. And Bob leans forwardand whispers in her ear, ""Can I pay in Canadian dollars?"""
