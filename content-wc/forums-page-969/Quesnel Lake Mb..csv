This is one of the better drive to lakes in the province. Was there last year at the same time and the fishing was hot, as was the weather. This year...?Le Pic"
519199,Guest,2002-04-11 15:23:00,0,"Hey Le Pic,I'm heading up there the weekend of the 18th for the opener. Will submit a report on the 22nd (I'm there for four days). I intend on using basic shallow water tactics, maybe 3 to 5 feet deep - run some cranks and maybe some spinners tipped with worms - actually plastic worms (Berkeley) worked real well last year - again very shallow around any obvious on-shore humps. Typically the narrows are great at this time of year as well and especially the area just South of the narrows in the trees - the long bay on the left hand side as you move through the narrows - its full of old trees. We'll see."
