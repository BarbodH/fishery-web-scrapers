519042,bellbuoy,2002-04-08 04:29:00,490,"It's called Snake Bay because there's nothing in the bay other than ""snakes"" (small northerns). Or at least that's what we thought after our trip.We did not have a good experience at this lodge during our trip 11 years ago. If you need specifics or a recommendation of a first class lodge, e-mail meBellbuoy"
519043,darcyfish,2002-04-08 20:33:00,15,"Don Snakebay is not a big area and is attached to Whitefishbay(deep trout water)this area does hold some walleyes and usually bigger ones, you fish deep reefs with jigs tipped with a sucker minnow.You also may catch some good size northern using this techniques.Snakebay also holds some smallmouth and largemouth bass.Tell me what time of year your planning the trip and I can give you a better idea of what you should be doing.Good luckD'arcy Finlan[email protected]"
519044,DonC,2002-04-09 08:19:00,93,"D'arcy,We would be going around July 16th. The fishing I like to do is 1) smallmouth on light tackle, 2) walleye/crappie, 3 )muskie/big pike. Thanks for your response,Don"
519045,darcyfish,2002-04-09 16:03:00,15,"In mid july Walleyes I find on Shallow humps 8-15ft and usually a mix bag,catching both northern(bigger) and walleye on the humps.Smallies vary this time of year as to water temps.Muskies are usually on the rock piles also and some still weed related.Never be afraid to fish deep especially on sunny days Whitefish is a funny area some reefs I have found will only hold walleyes,some only northerns so get yourself a good hydrographic map.I your wiling to do a little travelling the east side of Bell Island has structure for all species and can spend days trying it out.If you have a specific questions feel free.D'arcy"
