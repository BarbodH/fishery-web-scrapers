518479,Jigger1,2002-04-08 07:27:00,234,"Eric & Guide  I couldn't agree more! In my mind, the $320 I spent on my G. Loomis rod and my Shimano Stradic reel last year was the best money I have ever invested in something I truly love. I believe it made a huge difference in my catch rate and was directly attributable to the 60% increase in catch rate of walleyes over 24 I experienced last year on my Canadian trip. On my trips to northern Wisconsin it pushed my catch rate through the roof. I have never had this type of control/touch/feel (whatever you would like to call it) with previous equipment.I'm hooked and convinced this will be the difference in my quest to land a 30+ inch walleye.It's a beautiful thing - everyone has an opinion!Jigger1"
518480,River_eye,2002-04-08 11:26:00,1486,"Even if you don't catch more fish with a loomis or st croix, it's still a more pleasurable rod to fish with."
518481,Jigger1,2002-04-08 11:55:00,234,Without a doubt!

518483,Jigger1,2002-04-08 13:26:00,234,"Guide,I hadn't but I tracked it down. 31-1/4 ... VERY NICE! I began my tradition (which will last for years to come) of fishing Lac Seul in 2000. Trip number three is on the horizon and nearing quickly! Thus far I've landed seven over 27"" with the largest topping out at 29. I can feel a 30+ coming this year! Best of luck and keep them swimming!Jigger"
518485,Walleye Wacker,2002-04-08 13:54:00,6,"Dont know if there is a perfect jigging rod. So much depends on water depth,jig weight,presentation and your ability to feel the pressure of a subtle bite (hanger). I personally think that the rod is less important then your touch. I always have three rods rigged for jigging....#1 6 footer..med with quick tip...IM8..1/4 oz jig..6lb Magnathin.....(use up to 15 ft water) #2 6/6 rod...med with quick tip....Im8....3/8 to 1/2 oz jig... 10lb Fireline (use deep water over 15 ft)......#3 6footer..med with solid tip...IM8...1/4oz swimming jig....8lb Magnathin (use for casting in moving water or rocky/weedy shallows.....I buy Harold Ensley Signature rods at Wal-Mart $30. These rods will catch as many fish as anybody if you learn the most important thing...TECHINIQUE....ALWAYS FEEL THE JIG,LEARN WHAT A SUBTLE BITE IS...FEEL THE GENTLE THUMP OF A HANGER....ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS FEEL THE JIG....Good Luck"
518486,DonC,2002-04-08 19:40:00,93,"I enjoy the Bass Pro Walleye Angler Series 5'9"" jigging rod by Gary Parsons and his partner Keith K. Incredibly sensitive with good backbone.Don"
518469,Guest,2002-03-22 12:05:00,0,"Relatively new to walleye fishing. What is the best rod for jigging -length, brand, stiffness, etc.Thanks for the help."
518470,Todd_NE,2002-03-22 13:46:00,1330,"Bob,You'll get a lot of opinions but...I like a 5'9"" or 6' rod that has an ""extra fast"" build in Medium or Medium Light for an all around round for water under 30' deep. In water over 30' deep, go to a 6'6"" for better hookset.I like rods that don't ""twist down"" onto the reel and have a relatively narrow or small diameter handle.St. Croix Premier's ($80) or Avids ($140) are hard to beat. I don't always recommend spending tons of $ on certain rods like slip bobber or trolling, but a jigging rod is something you should go ahead and spend a little more on if you can afford it.Other good brands include G. Loomis, Cabela's XML/IM6/IM7/FE II, Fenwick, Bass Pro P & K Walleye Anglers, and some ""house"" brands like Scheels, etc.Do yourself a favor and get a reel that has two spools. Fill one with 4 or 6# test Berkley Solar and the other about halfway full of mono and then top it off with Green/Yellow Fireline or Power Pro in 4# test. Try both as you learn to jig, I think you'll like the Fireline or PowerPro better. Attach your jig with a Palomar knot.Good luck and I wish you success.todd"
518471,Peanut,2002-03-22 15:05:00,929,"Good jigging rods require 2 characteristics:1. Sensitivity;2. Balance (I learned this from REW, for which I am eternally grateful).Sensitivity is to detect the subtlest of bites, and set the hook before it's spit. Generally speaking the lighter and stiffer the rod, the more sensitive it will be. Also, all else being equal, 1 piece will be more sensitive than 2.Balance, because it's hard to feel anything precise when you are exerting pressure just to keep the rod tip up. As well, over the course of a day, muscles will get tired and sore, and again, your ability to ""feel"" will decline. Many, if not all of the benefits of a high-end rod can be eliminated if it is not properly balanced.All that being said - there is no one brand or model that is hands down the best. Opinions vary widely - G.Loomis, Fenwick, St. Croix, or even Berkley Series One. Find one you like and can afford with the above characteristics, and you will be fine.derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"
518472,Guest,2002-03-22 15:53:00,0,"5'6"" med-heavy w/ extra fast tip and tons of backbone. You'll see the difference in your livewell. good luck"
518473,Jigger1,2002-03-23 17:13:00,234,"Depends on what you want to spend. I use a G-Loomis WJR742S. It's a 6'2"" fast action, medium weight rod. The sensitivity of the rod is like none other I've ever used. You can pick it up from Cabela's online with no shipping for $204."
518474,River_eye,2002-03-23 18:19:00,1486,"The previous posts are right on. Ex fast tip, good sensitivity. Usually a spinning rod.An extra fast tip will allow you a good bend in the rod, but it bends most right near the tip. You can actually find good jigging rods for cheap, you just have to know what kind of feel you're looking for.Shake it around in the air, if you get good precise movement like a stiff majic wand, without it whipping around a lot like a noodle, it will be good for jigging. Make sure you can move it around without getting a sore wrist. When you spend more money, you'll get a lighter, more sensitive rod. This is important when you're buying rods 6' medium and longer or heavier. But if you're looking at a med lite, under 6', then you will be able to get away with spending less.Take a look at some Quantum rods. They make decent cheaper rods. Some midrange rods to look at are the Shimano Compre and Berkley lightning rod, maybe even a Fenwick HMX, although it wouldn't be my first choice. I do a lot of jigging so I bought a St. Croix Avid, but that's not necessary if you don't do it that often."

518476,Guest,2002-04-07 08:54:00,0,"Geez, I think you should consider turning pro! I was going to answer the question, but most of the peole who responded were right on target."
518477,River_eye,2002-04-07 16:14:00,1486,"Chip from Canada. Why should anybody feel bad about buying a high-end rod? Same reason you shouldn't feel bad about using a broken rod that costs $15.Are you poor Chip? I'm guessing not, but have you not splurged on anything in your life? A nice car? Nice house? Nice Stereo? If you have, is it right for for other people to complain about you just because you value a high-quality item? It's all about priorities, and to think that everyone should have the same priorities as you is just sillyness.If you were truly happy with just using a cheap rod, then you wouldn't care what anybody else is using.There are lots of people who are just fine with using cheap equipment, but they don't come on here and complain about the people who use expensive stuff."
518478,HLLGuide,2002-04-07 17:25:00,10,"I agree with you River_eye! As a guide I depend on good quality equipment. Rods with lifetime warranties, fast action tips with solid backbone. I use a Fenwick Techna teamed with a Shimano Stella, it is a $600 combo, but I DON'T regret spending the money that I did for it. I've fished with Techna and Loomis rods for the last 8 years. My best advice for you Bob, is if you are serious about walleye fishing, don't be afraid to spend a little money for a good quality rod. Fenwick makes good quality rods for a reasonable price. Falcon and Berkley rods are good rods also. If you buy a $10 zebco, more power to you, as long as you are comfortable with it. Well I've said enough. Good Luck with your rod search Bob!Guide"
