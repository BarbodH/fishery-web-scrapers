518013,River_eye,2002-03-15 09:19:00,1486,"I must say that the Dime store fisherman is the worst fishing show that I've ever watched. They go to some nice locations, but the show is one big advertisement and I can't take those two goofs."
518026,River_eye,2002-03-15 09:25:00,1486,"The only shows I'll watch are Real fishing and the complete angler. I'm not crazy about Don Lamont, but he fishes my area lots so it's nice to see familiar places somtimes.Can't stand Fish-on, or fishing with shelly and courtneyDimestore fisherman isn't even worth a rating."
518027,Guest,2002-03-17 14:05:00,0,"Don't remember the name of the show, hope someone will help with that, but it had a woman named Debra Johansen or Debrajo Hansen and her husband and they usually fished out of the Red lake area. Any woman who will reach down and hand land a 20lb plus pike has my utmost respect and I want to meet a woman like that for myself, are all Canadian women this fearless and talented."
518014,tracker,2002-03-17 15:03:00,91,Real Fishing would get my vote for one of the better shows but up in Northwestern Ontario we have 4-5 months of hard water fishing. How about at least one show a month on ice fishing during the winter months.
518028,Guest,2002-03-18 02:40:00,0,"yes, and they have beards and armpit hair"
518029,Mahumba,2002-03-19 05:38:00,345,All are worth watching. Except for the Dimebag Fishermen. I actually forced myself to watch a whole show so I can give a fair opinion. They pump that portable stove way to much and scream to much. Like somebody mentioned it looked like they were right outta rehab and trying to hold their habit in the closet. Hence...........the Dimebag Fishermen!Roger.

518031,Melonbob_ON,2002-04-09 14:08:00,61,"My favorite is fish n' canada, they fish for alot of everything. Bob Izumi is pretty good too, but man, he fishes for bass more than Orlando. Canadian Sportfishing is kinda boring I find, but they fish for various species. Shelly and Courtney are out of B.C. and fish nothing but Salmon, so it does nothing for me. The Dimestore fisherman......please don't think Canadians are actually like that....:("
518016,Guest,2002-03-08 23:17:00,0,HEY I THINK OL' PETE BOWMAN IS PRETTY REAL ON HIS SHOW IT DOESN'T lOOK REHEARSED .SHELLY AND COURTNEY LOVE WANNABE ROCK GROUPIES....BRUTAL. BUT THE WORST HAS GOT TO BE OL' WHATS HIS NAME FROM THE DAKOTAS THAT WHATS TO PUT YOU TO SLEEP WITH THE SAME FISHING(OAHE) ....BUT ONLY AFTER YOU CHOWED DOWN A FEW PUGSLY SANDWICHS
518017,Kip1,2002-03-14 13:16:00,17,"Hey T-Bone, how ya' been? One of the episodes (well, at least one) of Canadian Sportfishing was filmed on Kipawa. My Dad helped show the guys where to find some lake trout, and they caught a beauty! I don't know which episode it is or anything, and with the guys splitting up I'm not sure they'll air it very often.Later!Mike"

518022,Guest,2002-03-14 16:55:00,0,Red Green at Possum Lodge on PBS is as good as it gets.
518023,Bobby,2002-03-15 00:22:00,211,"Terrible show - Dimestore Fisherman. They're always fishing for 11"" pike, yelling and screaming. That long haired guy, looks like he just finished pumping my gas. He's gotta go, the noisiest of the two.The only use I can find for those two guys is if I lose a couple balls on a downrigger, they'd make decent replacements - until I'd realize they'd scare the fish, whoopin and hollerin. They'd even scare a burbot...Be forewarned. Better off watching Complete Angler, Fishin Canada, or Reel Fishing."
518024,Guest,2002-03-15 06:17:00,0,Those guys look like and act like they are right out of drug rehab and did not pass the course.
518025,Guest,2002-03-15 07:57:00,0,"Here's the real poop.Real Fishing/Bob Izumi. Very good, natural, & Bob is entertaining.Complete Angler/Don Lamont. I think Izumi stole his show title. Don is great...fishes average lakes from what I can tell. He gets excited too sometimes! One of the best.Fishing with Shelly & Courtney. Downrigging for salmon. Is this REALLY fishing? How about for a show title, ""Shelly & Courtney get driven around in a boat you can't afford to charter and fish a technique that requires no skill whatsoever."" One of the worst shows on TV....period.Sportfishing B.C...not sure who the host is. BUT, boy, what an arse. The stereotypical soft spoken, granola-eating fly-fisherman. Again...this guy is being helicoptered in and guided on trips the average guys could never afford. If they fish for 'cutthroats' one more time I'll throw a brick at my TV. Can this guy fish at all without being guided? Terrible.Fishin' Canada. Hey, I like Pete Bowman. He's pretty natural, gets excited even while panfishing. My type of guy. Even Gino and Reno or whatever their names are, are ok. Highly watchable.Canadian Sportfishing/Italo Labignan. Italo. A little advice...calm down...shhhhh...don't describe every freakin' detail of everything you see, hear and smell. Leave Eddie Shack at home. Don't look surprised that what you are using is actually working. Not bad.Fishful Thinking. Hmmmm borderline show...but ease up on the blatent product endorsments on the show buddy. Nothing turns me, the viewer, off more than being lambasted with product-talk. TV shows and viewers have an unwritten rule, Mr.Host. We watch the show, you put on commercials, we watch them, and that's it. We don't have to be subjected to your constant sponsor garbage. Thumbs down.Fish On Hosts: Leo Stakos and Steve Jojos. These guys have some 'banter' problems. Do they talk to each other like that off camera? Next show please.Noted American fishing Bums: Bill Dance, Shaw Grigsby. Bums I tell ya. Roland Martin, where are you?Go to this link for another opinionhttp://www.outdoorcanada.ca/tvshows_intro.html"
518006,Guest,2002-03-15 09:03:00,0,We used to get this show in the late afternoon here in the Twin Cities. When does it air now? I can't even find it on the OLN website.Thanks.
518003,Guest,2002-03-08 08:10:00,0,"Now that I have Direct TV, I have the opportunity to watch several Canadian fishing TV shows here in the states. Which are the best so I don't waste my time setting up the VCR or watching the TV Guide for what time they're on?Complete Angler? Canadian Sportfishing? Fisn'N Canada? Other? If you have the time, why do you think it's the ""best"" of the group?Thanks."
518004,bigfish1965,2002-03-08 08:25:00,3210,"Henry and Italo from Canadian Sportfishing were busted for fishing season violations et al so they don't get much consideration anymore. Bob Izumi's Real Fishing is a decent show. Although he's a bit of an odd guy, he is clear in his descriptions and doesn't always fish the easy virgin lakes. His show isn't too heavily edited and they often show his mess ups, hence the 'Real Fishing"" moniker. Fish n' Canada seems to always be in the NWT fishin for Lake Trout for some odd reason."
518005,Guest,2002-03-08 10:16:00,0,"Shows like Fish'n Canada, Real Fishing and Complete Angler all have their good and weak points. When the shows are about something that's of interest to me (bass and walleye fishing) then I tend to watch.Real Fishing is a multi species type of show, sometimes exotic locales. Izumi is good to explain about bass fishing though.Complete Angler does a lot of walleye fishing in western Canada (Alberta and Manitoba. jigging and trolling.Fish'n Canada - not bad, some good stuff at times - but they're almost always way up north.I just set the VCR and tape 'em all and erase what I don't like.Hope this helps."
518007,Guest,2002-03-08 10:58:00,0,"I have Direct TV too but have never seen these shows listed anywhere. I always watch TNN, Fox Sports North and ESPN2 for fishing shows. What channel are the Canadian shows on?? Thanks! Brian"
518008,Guest,2002-03-08 11:14:00,0,"Outdoor Life Network...channel 608. It's awesome. Check out www.olntv.com for the programming schedule. I don't think it's included on the most ""basic"" set-up, but it's with all the packages starting with Total Choice. Check out www.directtv.com if you have further questions on whether you should have it..."
518009,stewart,2002-03-08 13:49:00,100,"Another vote for Izumi. It's just entertaining.Passion Plein Aire is translated to English now (Outdoor Passions?). In it's original french version it's ok. You get to see Quebec lakes. It seems to be indebted to sponsers quite a bit though. (""Another fish on the Dartee spoon!"" acompanied by a slow pan of the spoon ;) )"
518010,Guest,2002-03-08 14:39:00,0,"What about Canada's best ""Dime Store Fishermen""?Goose"
518011,Guest,2002-03-08 15:50:00,0,"In a short while, an exciting show called FULL CONTACT FISHING will be aired. This show has a lot of excitement and laughs. I saw some rough cuts. If you like NHL Hockey and fishing, this is the show for you.It features two either retired or current NHL players, along with Todd Million, who is a well known angler in eastern Canada. Some co-hosts are Kris King and Mike Ricci. Not sure when it will be aired."
518012,Northern Manitoban,2002-03-08 16:14:00,195,"Besides my own fishing videos,i enjoy Bob Izumi,Don Lamont is a good show.fishin Canada and yes it does seem they fish for lakers alot up North but hey! so do i.I don't even want to talk about the dimestoned fisherman.I still enjoy canadian sport fishing.There is another show outdoor Quest by a couple great guys from Alberta,but because they also have hunting on there shows that the canadian channels won't carry them.I believe it can be watched on an american channel on satelite.FISH ON."
518015,Guest,2002-03-08 18:22:00,0,"Bob Izumi's Real Fishing is good. Mostly Ontario based but ventures around the country and South America. www.realfishing.comThe Complete Angler is also good, laid back not ""busy"" of a show I find. Mostly prairie lakes. www.completeangler.netDimestore Fishermen, you'll want to shoot your TV once you hear them.Nice Fish is west coast based, salmon fishing mostly.Shelley and Courtney, west coast based, salmon fishing mostly, really don't learn much on that one. Be nice if they wore skimpy bikini's, might be worthwhile to watch. Do have good cooking ideas tho.There's another west coast fishing show from B.C., the name escapes me, the guy is soft spoken, but fishes for trout, salmon in the rivers and streams. Let's the guides explain things.Fish'n Canada is okay, I think they got rid of that yappy Bowman, but he did have some good pointers."
