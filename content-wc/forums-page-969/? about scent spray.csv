519150,Guest,2002-04-11 05:35:00,0,"These are a few of the comments posted last year regarding this subject. I have them posted on my web site at www.thecanadatrip.com. I believe you're heading up to Kipawa, right? What week? We're going up in late June to Corbeau Lodge. Only 71 days to go!!!Comments: There's been a lot written about adding scents to lures. Are these legit or are they a marketing ploy? Here are a few answers from Canadian anglers that have experimented with using scents, and conclusions of what they learned. * The only time I use scents for walleye is in cold water. I feel that is a definite advantage until the water warms. I have also used them while stream fishing for trout and am convinced that yes indeed, they do work. * They definitely up your odds in water temperatures below 50 degrees, spring and fall. The scents that seam to work best for me has been crawfish oil base scents', and the old reliable Dr. Juice walleye. Last season I tried more crawfish oils scents with a great deal of success on both plastics and crank baits. Both walleye & Small mouth bass seam eager to slurp up jigs dosed with the oils. I have noticed they also help during summer cold fronts when the bit is tough and the fish hang tight to cover, or when a in your face presentations is needed. * I suspect human scent plays a bigger role than we anticipate. Recently, the University of Berkeley, California performed a research study on the effect of fish behavior based on different types of scent. The study consisted of two elongated tunnels whereby a scent product was introduced at the end of one of the tunnels. Depending upon the scent, the fish continued in their direction of travel, or reversed their course. For example, when a bear scent was placed at the end, the fish behavior retracted their movements and shifted to the other tunnel. Many other types of scent were introduced with many having no impact. But the interesting results were found when a HUMAN hand was placed in the water. The fish reversed their course to the other tunnel! The conclusive results are obvious with one noticeable exception. The human scent varies between the sexes! Evidently, females do not emit a toxin that fish find irritating, or offensive. * We did a test of sorts on jigs tipped with minnows a few years back. We had a few beers in the boat....one tipped over and the jig and minnow got soaked. We threw this out and it got pounded. After that, we started scenting the minnow with beer and we limited out in a short time on some real nice fish. I have duplicated this many times over with many types and brands of beer as well. Works best in spring and cold water."

519152,Guest,2002-04-11 11:15:00,0,I have to agree with the beer thing.....I do that all the time and it does seem to work....not just on Walleyes either.
