518694,Wisconeye,2002-03-30 10:05:00,79,"Posted a couple of weeks ago about Mattice Lake Outfitters and have heard really good reports- so we booked with them. Thanks to everyone that wrote and replied!Now- the anticipation is starting. We will be on the Ogoki Reservoir and I've heard about some great fishing times from others. Is anyone familiar with this water? I know it is big but what about structure,depths, fish, etc?If you have been there please help this fisherman with his anxiety by posting some comments. Thanks-Wisconeye"

Until you get on to fishing there you will wish you were on another lake. Talked to a couple from Detroit there one year and the guy said his wife threw her pole down on the third day of there trip and read the rest of the week. Not saying this to discourage you but I know what can happen. What week are you going this summer?
518696,WillieB,2002-03-30 17:58:00,292,Ask Don and Annette about the hotspots. Most likely they'll provide you with lake maps and indicate the honeyholes for you.The folks with the most info are usually the owners...and these owners happen to be very friendly and helpful people.good luck and tight lines
518697,Wisconeye,2002-03-30 20:08:00,79,"Going the third week of June.We pour our own jigs since we have been places where hang-ups werethe case, but then we usually got a lot of fish there too.BTW- I have had outstanding info and response from Don and Annette.Thanks"
518698,Guest,2002-03-30 20:24:00,0,"We will be at Ogoki in July. Make sure to use the aberdeen jig hook since it will bend and you can pull it loose , bend it back and keep on fishing. They have a camp attendant there and he will put you on hotspots.Had a friend who wanted to catch a trophy pike so I recommended Whitewater Lake. He came back with a 45 inch 25lb fish. If Don Elliot and family can't please you for a first class fly-in trip then no one can!!!!!!!!!!"
518702,TR,2002-04-01 18:03:00,22,"What dates are you going to Mattice Lake? My party has booked with them this year. The Elliots and their daughter are hands down the best outfitters I have ever booked with, hunting or fishing. They are always quick to answer any messages and I'm sure they'll know the hot spots!TR"
518703,Wisconeye,2002-04-02 17:44:00,79,We are going June 16-23 on Ogoki Reservoir.Thanks for the input. I have heard nothing but great commentsabout our choice of Mattice Lake Outfitters.
518704,Boots,2002-04-02 17:57:00,19,Four of us flew in 1987 and stayed at the north end of Mojikit Lake.We sure went through the jigs. From the cabin we went east to the channel and found some fast dropoffs and caught a lot of walleys and snags. We did the best trolling straight out from the cabin especially in the morning near the many islands. I think I have some maps of Mojikit and if you want them I will send them to you providing you pay whatever the postage is. We dont fly anymore but drive to a camp near Upsula [email protected]
518699,Wisconeye,2002-04-11 16:58:00,79,WWCan you tell me what kind of depth this water has. I realize itis quite large but what can I expect as far as lake structure?If the wind kicks up are there some easy to get to sheltered areas?Thanks
