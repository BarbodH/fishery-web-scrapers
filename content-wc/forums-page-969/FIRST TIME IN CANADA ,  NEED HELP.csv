The fishing up on that part of the lake is awesome for smallies, northern's and walleyes. They have very nice housekeeping accomodations and boats. They also have a campground. Going back for my 5th year this June!Good luck!"
519027,Guest,2002-04-07 20:55:00,0,"We are planning on making a trip to Canada, fishing for Walleye, Norther, and Lake troute. Hope to keep the driving to around 8 to 10 hours north of the twin cities.We would like to stay away from the huge lakes and are open for house keeping plans or tent camping. Can anyone give us some referances on some nice but economy type places. Thanks Al"

519029,bphunger,2002-04-08 07:10:00,28,Check www.whitefishbaycamp.com Do not let the fact that this is Lake of the Woods stop you because Whitefish Bay has lots of protected water but everything you want and on 75 miles from Int. Falls. Check them out.

519031,Guest,2002-04-08 07:29:00,0,"There are lots of places and lots of opinions out here. I own a lodge 10 hours N of Minneapolis at the end of the road 42 miles NE of Ear Falls, South Bay Lodge <http://www.southbaylodge.com> . We don't have camp grounds but we do offer housekeeping cabins and since we are the only lodge fishing on Confederation Lake our fishing is very good for Northern, Lake Trout and we have great Walleye fishing in our small portage lakes (like a fly-in for a day). good luck,"
