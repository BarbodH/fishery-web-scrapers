I've looked at Angler's Retreat in Keene on their website and it looks good. I'm bringing my wife, son (10) and daughter (14) and our boat. I always have reservations booking into somewhere I know nothing about however, so I'm looking for help. Has anyone stayed there ? Know anything about it ? Reviews, comments, opinions, warnings welcome !Thank you. Chet"

My wife's relatives have been going there for at least 25 yrs. The owners are very pleasant and do anything to make your visit feel like home. After the first time and you go back next year, they remember your face. I haven't been there for the last 3 yr do to when the whole gang goes up. bass fishing starts last sat. in june and the wife has to take vacation when her boss does, soit doesen,t happen to often. we go to do walleye fishing and bass fishing both. both are excellent fishing. their rates are resonable,they just built new cabins or refurbished some of the older ones. they come with stove,fridg,micro,gasBBQ,heaand 3 piece bathroom. some have bath tubs,1 or 2 person jacuzzi's,gas fireplace and air conditioning. There is also a cottage ot the island. there's 4-5 islands in view. you can rent the following - boats, color T.V. - baby crib & high chair, a roll away plus the recreational things such as heated pool,wading pool, swings/slides, basketball hoops,kayaks,paddleboats,walking trails, lending library,fishing piers. also you can rent mountain bikes. it's a great place for the family.within 30 mins. or less there's a golf course,harness racing,festival of lights show,pioneer village, restaurants, antique shopping,live theatre,cinema,festivals. also a play ground,jungle-gym. The name of the place is Southview Cottages.you can do the following if you wish. hope this helps thanks - bob spittle ph# 705-939-6761 [email protected] fax 705-939-6104 E-mail: [email protected] web site: www.southviewcottages."
