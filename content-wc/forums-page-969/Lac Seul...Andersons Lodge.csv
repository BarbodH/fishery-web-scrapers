519093,Guest,2002-04-10 06:25:00,0,"late June should be even better than normal this year with the anticipated late spring up there, ice fishermen still almost need extensions on their augers. Have you an idea which part of Lac Seul you will be fishing? I am most familiar with the Bear Narrows, Taylor Island, Chamberlain Narrows area. I was not aware that Anderson's had outposts up the lake but has been a few years since I lived up there.... by that time of the year the 'eyes will probably have moved away from the fast water areas and be in ~16-20 feet of water. Can't usually go too far wrong fishing with jigs'n'minnows or leaches or trolling with spinners'n'minnows bouncing them off bottom."

We will be fishing primarily Pickerle Narrows. Thanks for the info, the Lac Seul area is amazing...the highlight of the year for me!"

There is a rock formation ""alternate-chute"" which yields some good logs. It is ~ 20 minutes from the base camp. Good luck Fist!"
