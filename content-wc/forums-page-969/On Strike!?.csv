519096,Guest,2002-04-09 06:48:00,0,"Hey all Canadians. I have had plans for many months to take my future beautiful bride to the Canadian side of Niagara Falls for a nice wedding ceremony. Yesterday I get a call that I can't because the government is on strike? According to the source, you can't get a birth certificate, death certificate, driver's license or marriage license because these agencies are on strike. I was really hoping to spend a bunch of my American $$ up there. Now, thanks to the government being greedy, my $$ will go to New York. What gives with this??Signed,One disappointed American"
519097,Dave,2002-04-09 08:24:00,258,What does this have do with Walleye fishing? Just wondering. It seems like there is a bunch of garbage posted here that has nothing to do with Walleye fishing in Canada. Does anyone else feel the same way?
519099,bigfish1965,2002-04-09 08:36:00,3210,"It is the Provincial government employees that are on strike, not the feds. Why do you as an American need to get a Canadian drivers license or birth certificate? The border is open and operating as always. I do not know the reasons for the strike, nor am I overly concerned about it. Don't state employees ever go on strike? Or are they not 'greedy' like the Ontario employees? BTW, make sure you come into the casino that I work in and make a small wager here and there."
519098,Guest,2002-04-09 08:38:00,0,"That right Dave ! (Raise a cold Labatt Blue in toast)Sorry about your luck EC, but call the proper government agency if you're bummed or looking for an explanation. Now, if you were going to wet your line while in Canada for a few 'eyes, then I might care or be able to help you.Anyway, Niagara Falls? See posts regarding Walleye Honeymoon..."
519101,River_eye,2002-04-09 10:43:00,1486,Are you looking for help or you just looking for an argument?You won't find either here. Especially when you don't know enough to distinguish between federal and provincial politics.
519100,Guest,2002-04-09 10:47:00,0,Thanks for the hospitality guys! I LOVE NEW YORK!
519102,Wawajake,2002-04-09 12:06:00,413,hey BigfishWhich Ontario casino do you work at to support your walleye habit.Is it part of OLGC ?jake
519103,Melonbob_ON,2002-04-09 13:40:00,61,"In order to help, seeing as apparantly we don't.....Why do you need a birth certificate or drivers licence?Marriage Licences are Municipal Govt's job, if you plan on getting married here, it's not a problem, I picked up my marriage licence two weeks ago.....But please, don't be calling striking workers greedy unless you know the situation, and no, I do not work for the Ontario Govt."
519104,pfg1,2002-04-09 20:16:00,52,"Yes, the staff at OMNR is also out on strike, so I cannot get any 'eye info re maps, licenses, etc. So much for pre-planning my fishing trips. I'm unsure why you need Canadian certs to have a wedding there though. Somethin' smells.....fishy to me."
