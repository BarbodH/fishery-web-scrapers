It has it's share of tournaments too. It's close to many urban areas and is not on that dreaded northern route to cottage country, so fairly easy access makes it popular to those just going for a days fishing. I've fished it 4-5 times only several years ago. It's one of the ugliest lakes in Ontario. You will see many unorthadox fishermen there..I am not going to post exactly what I mean but if you think long enough you'll figure it out. As far a methods, virtually everyone is jigging all the time. If you are thinking of going there, read all the posts about Percy Reach. It's close by.Stay off the pipe...and don't forget to wipe.Red"
