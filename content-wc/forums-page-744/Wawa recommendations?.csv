550181,detroit tom,2005-07-07 17:55:00,22,"I would like to trailer my boat and go for a week to the Wawa area or somewhere else in Ontario within about 600-700 miles of Detroit/Windsor. Can anyone recommend a resort/lodge/cabins? I would like to go yet this year, or I could go next year. Walleyes are my main target species, but Perch, Pike, or Smallmouth would be a nice bonus. Any advice would be appreciated. Tom"
550186,jerry bark,2005-07-07 20:58:00,822,"i like happy day lodge near chapleau, within your driving distance but pushing 700 hard. bob and sondra are really nice and the lake is huge with plenty of places to avoid anyone else for the whole week if that's your goal. can be tough to get a cabin there depending on when you want to go, but if you can flex your schedule you should be able to get something. they also have campsites if you want to tent it or could set you up with an island camp site up the lake a ways perhaps. www.happydaylodge.com tell them i sent you, if you want to explore the chapleau area moose horn lodge is located in a central spot and is nice, also five mile lake lodge has an outpost on goldie lake which is loaded with northern and lake trout though no walleye that i know of. only camp on a six mile long lake. a friend has gone north of wawa to the white lake area and had good luck making day trips to various lakes and staying in a hotel in town. maybe someone who knows that are will chime in for you. cheers jerry barkley"
550216,Rich B,2005-07-08 18:12:00,1081,"I would recommend that you check out Camp Kuha.www.campkuha.com Good smallmouth, walleye & northern pike. It is a ""drive-in"" lake about 2 hours from the Soo. Camp is only about 5 years old (nice log cabins) and the owners are wonderful folks. Nice camp boats (I bring up my own) and very few other people on the lake in the week. The camp has it's own ramp, and nice dockage with electric available at the docks. A decent sized river feeds the lake so you can fish either the lake, or the river. I have gone up to this camp once or twice a year since it opened. Feel free to email me if you need any other info. I will be up at the Camp the week of 8/13-8/20. Rich B"
