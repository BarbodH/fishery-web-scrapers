549851,Guest,2005-06-28 12:10:00,0,"I will be heading up to Cedar Point Resort in Ontarion on July 23rd-July 30th. It will be my first tiem going fishing in Canada. When I fish my home lake, Lake Winnebago in Oshkosh Wisconsin, for walleyes, i use Rapala CD05 off the shores and 1/4 oz jigheads with Large-Jumbo leaches or crawlers. When i go to Canada we are buying 2 flats (1000) crawlers and mainly that is what we will be using in Canada with jigheads. I have also bought some mimic minnows and i am taking all my other tackle up to try also. If anybody has been to Cedar Lake or any of the surrounding lakes, what have you found that worked well?

549854,Trailerguy,2005-06-28 13:04:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Wabaskang is also part of the Cedar River System, downstream of Perrault Lake. It's been a few years since I fished Cedar Lake, but the same methods work. By late July the weather more than likely will be hot, which means the eyes will be deep. Likely in 15-30' of water, usually hanging around reefs and rocky points. Jigging should be a good method. You might pick some fish in shallower water in the evening using crankbaits as they move up to forage. I'm sure the resort will be able to put you on fish, the biggest mistake most people make is not following their advice to a ""t"". The blue berrys should be ripe by then, take a couple hours and pick some, they make pancakes you won't forget. 4 days until I'll be fish'in on Wabby"

550005,AB,2005-07-01 17:25:00,61,I haven't fished Cedar or Perrault but have fished some nearby lakes. Cedar is a multi species lake that from what I know is good fishing for most species but not great for any one species. I think there are some nice smallies and muskies in there. Eyes seem to me a little more finicky in Canada than in the states and I use live bait alot more up there. (mainly minnow/jig combo) We slow troll alot until we find them. Then we drift or cast raps or divers at them. Solicit info from camp owner/ other fishermen in camp on where to go and what they are using. Visit the fish cleaning house and the dock area when fishermen are coming in and politely ask them for advice without infringing on their spots. Move around alot and explore until you find the fish. You sound like a knowledgeable fisherman and if you fish hard you'll catch em'. Sometimes it takes a few years to learn a lake system and be succesful when the bite is slow. Hopefully you'll hit it right and have a great time. The scenery is breathtaking.
550037,Guest,2005-07-04 07:29:00,0,"Use to fish on Cedar Lake about 10 years ago staying at Keystone Lodge and also fished Perrault Lake before that staying at Manotak Lodge. Over the years the lakes have seen a number of lodges pop on on the lakes and seen increased fishing pressure. There are a couple of spots on Cedar Lake that you should ask your lodge owner about and also there are some spots on Perrault that you should check out as well. Here is a link to a map of Perrault and some of the areas to check are East Bay, Sucker Island, Grassy Bay(for smallies)and Whale Back Rock (brother caught a 11# walleye there. We used minnows and some leeches with backtrolling. If you hit it right(time wise) you can get some great smallmouth and perch action as well. If the water is high enough go into Rainey Lake and check out the walleye action in there, can be great at times and you are away from everyone. Going from Cedar to Perrault is not that long of a distance and the best thing to do is ask your lodge owner for a map of both cedar and perrault and where the best locations are this year. Please post your results when you get back.http://www.duenorth.net/manotak/location.html"

550220,nitroman,2005-07-08 20:20:00,368,"I'm sure the dynamic of the lake changes somewhat between my week and yours but I will give you a few of our semi-secret hot spots :) the bay where we have caught the biggest eye's (and some muskies as well) is straight across from the camp. Stand on the big rock on the shore right in front of cabin 5 looking out over the lake the bay is to your right just a few degrees between the island and the main land you can see the entrance. I've had good luck jiggin east side of the island between it and the smaller island to the east right on the saddle at dusk but make sure your back before dark if you are in a camp boat. Trolling the long narrows with spinning rigs is always a good time when you figure out what depth they are at. We like to troll musky bay also lots of weeds at the west end for northern.Try jiggin the cut-thru down near the sanctuary. If you are up for a ride head to the Ord river up in perrault lake for some great walleye action its a 20-25 min ride from camp but worth it most days, good place to drift and jig. If you get a chance go to east bay and take the boat right up the creek at the east end we see alot of musky hanging out there.My main bait this year was 1/4 ounce yellow jig heads with a yellow lindy munchy and tipped with a minnow or crawler and spinning rigs with firetiger xps blades. If you can afford it upgrade to the 25hp boats it will save you some travel time and give you more room to fish. Take a beer or 2 when you head down to clean fish the graffiti on the walls can be entertaining(i'm on the right side of the door above head level in a small circle that say's Abels.)Good luck hope you have fun and tell Ray and Kathi hi from the guy that made the big map hanging in their cabin behind the table"
