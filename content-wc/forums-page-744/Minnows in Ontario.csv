I feel that those boys should take lessons in Public Relations. I likes the ""Old Boys"" a lot better than the new generation. I see them getting batton training now and some have started to wear Police type bullet proof vests. I know they need to protect themselves but..... The time might come when they bear down and you like ""Cops"" and cuff you for your protection until they check the lines and boat for an extra line or a fish over. I liked the old days in Ontario where I live where the Officer was armed but the rifle was in the truck and only taken out when required. . That rifle is a lot handier in their trade than the 9mms they carry."

550155,Guest,2005-07-07 00:13:00,0,"Hi. when we bought leaches the lady at the store said the same thing. I thought live leaches were OK, not that we ever took any over. Oh well. although at the lodge , they never gave us a receipt for the minnows except at the end of the week."
549978,fishinnut,2005-07-01 08:03:00,642,"I just returned from a week on Rainy Lake (Canadian side). While there, the resort owner gave us a business card (receipt) that he had written on stating that we had purchased minnows at his resort. We were instructed to show this to the warden if we were stopped on the lake. I'm sorry, but I think this is a little extreme. I can understand not bringing minnows across the border but stopping people on the water to check where they bought their bait is too much. Any opinions?"
549980,Guest,2005-07-01 08:14:00,0,Sounds like you should be happy that the Resort Owner was smart enough to help you keep out of a situation that could have caused you some delays. The law is the law and the boys are just doing their job.
550015,Guest,2005-07-02 08:32:00,0,"i think reason for proof of purchase is something about fish disease being spread by the locally trapped minnows from specific areas to other areas, thus the control of commercially sold minnows. but i don't know this for sure, if you do get stopped and asked for the reciept, ask the warden the purpose and let us know."
550035,Guest,2005-07-03 18:57:00,0,"It's the way to prove you didn't bring live bait across the border with you. With all the nutjobs talking about bring in salted minnows that they try to revive when they get to the resort, it sounds like a resonable request to me. Most places I have been issue receipts everytime you gas up or get bait. It's just good business. It's like having yoru fishing license. No big deal, just another question to answer during an inspection. F N"
550050,Bx2(IL),2005-07-04 20:27:00,62,"In Canada, it takes a special license to commercially catch & sell minnows. There are a number of people doing this illegaly and the MNR is cracking down on it. By the way fishinut, how was the fishing? I'm still looking forward to being at The Fisheries. (I'll make sure I carry the receipts)."
550089,Guest,2005-07-05 13:29:00,0,Michigan perch fishermen on the Canadian side of Lake St. Clair have been ticketed in the last few seasons in Canada for not purchasing minnows in Canada. (Must show reciept of purchase.) We cannot transport minnows across the border apparently.
550093,IaCraig,2005-07-05 14:16:00,434,"OK, I'm how do you revive a salted minow? Do you mean rehydrate? I've never salted minows, but from what I've read about the salting process I'd say they are very dead. ?? IaCraig"
550095,Guest,2005-07-05 14:35:00,0,"Craig, You hold them in your mouth for a few minutes."
550121,fishinnut,2005-07-06 09:41:00,642,I hope you guys didn't think I had issues with the resort owner. My issue is with the MNR checking where minnows were purchased while on the water. I still think that's a little extreme.
550126,IaCraig,2005-07-06 10:54:00,434,"If I put the salted minnows in my mouth, then I won't have anywhere to store my leaches. ??? :o Duh back at you. ;-) IaCraig"
