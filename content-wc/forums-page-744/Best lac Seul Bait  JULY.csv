550087,515,2005-07-05 13:12:00,254,I'm a big fan of jigs. I use them pretty much all of the open water season and have success with them all the time. It's a bait that can be presented in many patterns and tipped with a bit of live biat works well all year long. My favorite colours are white or yellow. Mike
550105,Guest,2005-07-05 17:40:00,0,"Have used almost all colors fishing LS, to include gold, black, and day-glo white. A group of guys I know have fished LS for over 25 years and they use jigs exclusively, plain and multi-colored. Often times the color doesn't really matter, but sometimes a switch can change your success rate. We have used worms, leaches, and minnows over the years and have caught most of our bigger fish on worms and leeches. Last year at this time we had very good success with leeches and worms. It's always good to check with those who are just checking out of the lodge and the lodge owners for helpful hints. Good luck!"

550123,Guest,2005-07-06 10:06:00,0,Ditto on the crawlers. Rig up a 1/2 crawler on a spinner or jig. We also bring salted minnows. Fatheads are $2 a scoop.
550124,wooglin,2005-07-06 10:43:00,371,"We just got back (yeah, I know it was June, but I'd guess this will work for July too). We were on the fish pretty good, guys catching them on chartruese jig heads and white twister tails. Then they stopped hitting, I tossed in orange/black 1/8 oz. jig head tipped with leech, bite was back on. Later on when the other guys were tossing orange/black 1/8 oz. jig head tipped with leech, I through out a green floating treble with small white plastic blades (spins) tipped with crawler and lead by split shot sinker, I was nailing them right with them. So, don't be afraid to toss new baits, you might get on to something. I really never thought color and such mattered, but it was proven to me this last week that it does. If the hit goes off, just switch up your baits to see if you can get back on them. If not, toss your Northern lures, likely a big one came into your hole!"

It is more important to figure out the pattern, structure and depth that is most effective. I like the deeper water ledges 10 to 20 ft with wind on them. Jigging with any of these baits is effective and bottom bouncing is a good way to locate fish. When you find a few fish throw out a marker and jig them up. Good Luck"
