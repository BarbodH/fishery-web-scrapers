To locate a new spot, we bounced worm harnesses. Jig colors...white, black, chartreuse...tipped with crawlers, leeches or minnows. Worms and leeches seemed to work best. Many over the slot walleyes, and a good number of the 16.5 to 18"" fish. Largest eye for the trip was 28.5"" with a number of 25s, 26s and a 27.5"". Smallmouth were shallow up against the rock shores....caught 16""-18"" smallies on jigs, cranks, small spoons. Largest pike of the trip was 36"". Orange and flo green spoons worked well. Also caught fair share of pike while walleye fishing. Caught both walleyes and pike throwing suspending jerk baits over the developing cabbage beds. Mayfly hatch in this area happened the first weekend we were there. Did not seem to affect fishing much....did however catch walleyes with a mouth full of mayflies though. Best of luck to those still making the trip this summer/fall. Sad mine is over for the year."

550140,Guest,2005-07-06 16:08:00,0,Glad to hear you had a good trip. I'm assuming you stayed at Scout Lake Resort. Did you have any bears in camp the week you were there?
550165,Guest,2005-07-07 09:01:00,0,No bears at Scout Lake last week...at least none that we saw anyway. Have seen them on the road from the highway to camp in years past.
