550127,Guest,2005-07-06 11:37:00,0,Does anyone know the restrictions for camping on Crown land. Some tell me there are only a few places where you can camp and some tell me that you can go anywhere. From what I have found it looks like you can go anywhere except for a few places that our off limits like nature preserve areas. Can anyone clear this up?
