550154,Guest,2005-07-07 00:07:00,0,"Hi. we just came back from there monday. the first couple of days we did not have to venture far- Log bay to catch all we needed till the stormy weather hit in the middle of the week. then we had to venture 15 miles, just past yellow girl to find any fish. Talking with some other folks if you wanted to wear out your arm pulling them in WITH OUT NETTING THEM BY THE TON then you had to go another 5 to 10 miles west which is probably where you are going with a house boat anyway. one week is not enough. good luck. the caps are in reference to those people that can net without reproach. I guess as time goes on we will have to go 50 miles to find fish when they net them out of existance."

550184,Guest,2005-07-07 20:31:00,0,"Well today I caught them in 5ft of water and 25-35ft and good size at every depth, the heat will bring them up more onto the shallow humps and rocks, which may be happening already.We are suppose t have temps in the 90's for a few days and maybe more, break out the sun block."
