550173,verlund,2005-07-07 12:00:00,32,Heading up to LS in a couple of weeks. Never been to the Ear Falls area. Can anyone tell me what to expect. We are staying at Evergreen Lodge. Will we have to travel far to get on fish? I do have a guide scheduled for a day but not for a couple of days after we arrive. Are minnows the bait of choice or crawlers/leeches? Last year I fished around the same time down on the southern end of LS and minnows by far out performed crawlers/leeches. We plan to mainly use jigs and rigs. Haven't seen much feedback on the northern end of LS this year so any help would be greatly appreciated. I will post my results upon my return. Thanks Steve
550177,Guest,2005-07-07 13:17:00,0,"Steve, Pat and Gary at Evergreen will be very helpful in putting you on fish. They have minnows, leeches and I believe they also have crawlers. We have ALWAYS used minnows an this time of year used spinner rigs that Gary makes over the winter and sells last time we bought them a few years ago they were a buck each. We have used jigs the past few years though. 1/4 and 3/8 silver and gold and white. some glow in the dark. Cox Island is a good place to start and is the Sanctaury. We caught alot of nice slot fish trolling # 9 shad raps up in towards the rapids in about 12 ft. Watch out for the rock about 100 yard out from Cox took at a skagg a few years ago. Another good spot to try is Steamboat Narrows there will be plenty of of other folks fishing those areas. Sand Island is also a good spot. all within 20 minutes of camp Good Luck say hello to Pat and Gary for me"
