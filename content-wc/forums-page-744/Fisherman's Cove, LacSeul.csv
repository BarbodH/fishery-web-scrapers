550166,fish 4 fun,2005-07-07 09:04:00,101,I am going to fish LacSeul the week of July 18th out of Fisherman's Cove. As this will be my first time on LacSeul I was hoping the good folks on Walleye Central would set me up with some free advice. What would be you favorite techniques for this time of year? What types of structure and depths would you typically find fish at this time of year? I believe LacSeul is known for producing some big fish. Is there anything I can do to increase my chances of catching a Master Angler? Anything else you think may be helpful would be much appreciated. Thanks. Jason

Colors pink and white spinners or gold seem to work the best. Jigs I personally like the gold short shank jigs Northland or cabela's. Minnows should work great for ya. Heck it is Lac Suel you will have a blast and catch a ton of fish. This will be my first year missed in a while, as I have a new fishermen who is a month old. Ask them how broad and sunlight lakes are going? Also we seemed to pull bigger fish in shallow around Manitou Point."
