They were doing this in the middle of the summer during some of the hottest weather of the summer: flat calm, bluebird days with temps in the middle to upper 90's. I thought they were nuts, but finally decided to try it one day and caught the two biggest walleyes of my life (26"" and 26.5""). Someone else at the camp caught a 33"" fish doing this. The key was to find these rock piles that came out of deep water and came close to the surface, but did not actually come out of the water. They then threw the Shad Raps up on the rocks and pulled them until they hit rock, then paused and let them float and work their way free. The strikes usually came on the rise. I haven't been back since, but I'm heading to Rainy at the end of July and wondering if anyone has tried this method there, or on other lakes. It's not the type of thing I had ever seen anywhere else. Bill"

We catch a lot of Smallmouth doing it and this year one of the guys in our group caught a 43"" Pike on a glass shad rap doing it. We like to jig the area adjacent to it becuse when you catch them that close to shore there can be some others working a liitle deeper. My theory is that the baitfish are there or the Walleye and other predators wouldnt be."

550207,Guest,2005-07-08 10:20:00,0,"Shad Rap 3 1/2"" Color Code 06,11,25,70 Glass Shad Rap 2 3/4"" Color Code 65,72,76 There are many good crank baits that will work well for this. But these have been best for us. Good Luck"
550210,Guest,2005-07-08 11:59:00,0,"Yes, we had great luck with that on Lac Seul in June of this year. Only we were fishing over weedbeds and on the edges. The trick is a slower retrieve. I was using the standard silver/black shad rap and my buddy was using a perch colored and they both worked well. I actually had 19 - 23 inch walleyes hitting these things at the boat like northerns!"
