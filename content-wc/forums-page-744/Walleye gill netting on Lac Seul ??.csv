549754,Guest,2005-06-26 14:59:00,0,Starting to hear a few rumors and reports of netting walleyes in the winter or spring on Lac Seul. Anyone have info on this ? I know it's causing great concern on LOTW.

A few lodge owners make a big deal out of it. He does keep the white fish under control, which only a few fish for, great fun on a flat day in 60 to 100 feet of water. Good eating, smoke white fish. The Fisherman has been there for many years, he has 3 or 4 cabins on the lake one is near fishermans cove, williams bay, and by hudson. I have not heard reports of locals netting like lotw. If you ever see a big black boat tiller drive, with boxs , thats him. He might even make you a deal on white fish. He is a good guy and will share infomation."
549771,Guest,2005-06-26 22:13:00,0,I'm serious. Hope it's not true. Anyone in the Lac Seul area know anything about this ?
549774,Trailerguy,2005-06-27 05:43:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Ya, you're serious OK, you gut hooked one already! Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
549775,Guest,2005-06-27 07:14:00,0,Yes...there is commercial whitefish netting on Lac.
550107,Guest,2005-07-05 20:19:00,0,"What, you think it can happen? No gill netting on Lac Seul, not now. They are too busy with the Woods! But don't think for a moment, that it isn't on the list. How many lakes can you get big numbers like you can on the Woods and the Seul? Furthermore, this is about much more than netting fish. This is about taking back the land by making it an economic wasteland. It is just a matter of time and Lac Seul will have the same kind of pressure on it that the Woods now suffers. You think they are going to stop with one lake?"
550116,wooglin,2005-07-06 07:13:00,371,"The guy who ran my camp this year, Don, used to be a whitefish netter guy on Lac Seul. He sat with us one night and said he'd come in with 9,000 lbs. of whitefish in one haul....he said that maybe, on a high day, he'd have 900 lbs. of walleye in his haul...he didn't say if he could save the fish or if they died....but, I got him to say whether he did or did not see any enormous fish during his days - he said he's seen some 20lb walleye in his nets.....big trophies."
550157,Guest,2005-07-07 00:27:00,0,HI. Well its their land and they can screw it up any way they want!
