6708445,prov1800,2023-01-21 17:10:00,5010,Soon in Canadian terms means April/May.When we get through February everyone gets happier
6708455,Eckohlt,2023-01-21 17:46:00,3685,I was hoping when you said soon it was next week.I guess we will all have to wait it out.
6708465,Bill Krejca,2023-01-21 18:55:00,6107,"I'll be going to the sport show in Cedar Falls in March, no longer attend the All- Canada show in Milwaukee, maybe I'll see you out on the water next fall, John! Bill"
6708471,prov1800,2023-01-21 19:49:00,5010,I sure hope so Bill.Its about time
6708479,Eckohlt,2023-01-22 06:45:00,3685,I'll meet up with you sept 22 if your at the house.
6708565,jackpotjohnny48,2023-01-22 09:53:00,153,"A question I always ask when using the camp boat is:""Do you have a specific curfew which requires me to have the boat back at the dock by dusk, or can I stay out fishing until way past midnight if I choose to do so?""If they say, ""You have to have the boat back to the dock before dark,"" then this is usually an automatic deal breaker for me.So there's a few lodges that I won't go to (for example, one of the ones on Nungesser), because there's nothing worse than getting on a hot bite at 8:30 pm, when you know that you have to quit fishing for the night in order to get the boat back to the dock by 9.Especially when we fish ultra clear water lakes, we end up catching most of our fish between about 9 pm and midnight.So when I was checking out Snowbank Lake in Ely, MN this past summer, and we knew we were going to be renting a camp boat (due to the 25 horsepower limit in the Boundary Waters section of Snowbank), I made sure to ask if they would allow us to keep the boat out late at night.Adam, the resort owner, replied that as long as we understood that we were financially responsible for any damage that we might do to the boat (such as hitting a reef), he had no problems at all with us choosing to fish in a camp boat after dark.So we booked the trip and ended up doing quite well on the walleyes during that trip. We did end up catching a fairly good number of walleyes before dark, but BY FAR our most productive hours were between 9 pm and midnight.So the question about ""Am I allowed to fish after dark,"" is always one of the first questions I ask a lodge owner.There are many times (especially when fishing a clear water lake), that the ability to fish after dark makes all the difference.""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
6708569,nitroman,2023-01-22 10:38:00,368,"Bill, Jon and I will be back this year representing CPR. Stop by and say hi please. We will be more towards the center of the dome this year as opposed to our previous location. If any others on here are headed to the Eastern Iowa sports show this year please stop by and say hi. We enjoy talking fishing Cedar with y'all!"
6709003,prov1800,2023-01-23 19:09:00,5010,"See you then,Rod"
6709071,Bill Krejca,2023-01-24 07:51:00,6107,"Scott - Yeah, the main reason I'm coming to the show is just to bs a little with you; last fall Ray said you would be there. The March show, imho, is the best one in the Cedar Rapids/Waterloo area, less siding and window booths!!! Bill"
6708339,Eckohlt,2023-01-21 07:21:00,3685,"Did you sell rich a trip??,he might be a tough sell,he's a smart guy john,he knows every salesman trick in the book.hahaha."
6708345,prov1800,2023-01-21 07:54:00,5010,Who knows.???.lol.Met a few other WC members.Was fun chatting with them.was pretty good turn out for a Friday.Think today will be very busy.
6708351,Hook_settr,2023-01-21 08:18:00,127,I didn't see this in the earlier posts so I apologize if this has already been pointed out. Make sure Muskie and Smallmouth season are open for the week you book your trip. I don't think Muskie season opens until the third Saturday of June and my understanding is that you can't target them until then even if planning to catch and release. As far as lakes and lodges: Lake of the Woods around the Morson area has plenty of both species that you are looking for. I have stayed at Mylie's Place for a number of years now. Justin runs a great camp. Enjoy the show! I always enjoyed going to the All Canada Show when it came to Des Moines. Hook_settr
6708353,RichA$1970,2023-01-21 08:32:00,1159,"John,Likewise and great putting a face to a name. Enjoy the show along with all the lakes you get to frequent and next time I’m near VB I’ll give you a yell"
6708357,RichA$1970,2023-01-21 08:36:00,1159,"Eck, I was on good behavior and didn’t cash in but have a bag of brochures to go over. Hopefully after March 1 the labor contract is approved and then I can plan vacations and not assigned to the factory since I have 2 weeks of vacation slotted for fishing trips."
6708361,Eckohlt,2023-01-21 08:55:00,3685,"Let's hope you get to wet a line this year,if not you may be alittle rusty in 2024.hahaha"
6708369,coldtuna,2023-01-21 09:24:00,25,"I don't think this lodge is at the Milwaukee show, but my son and I fished North Shore Lodge on Eagle lake about 5 years ago. https://northshorelodge.ca. Not far from the lodge were a couple of bays that held nice smallmouth structure and we caught several 18-19"" class smallmouth there. We caught I think 39 smallmouth one day when we concentrated on them (we were guided, but you could do this without a guide). Several of the bigger smallmouth were scarred up from recent muskie encounters. Weather was not great during our trip. We did not fish muskies, but the owner (Scott) and his brother are big into that species and I know many are caught there every year. It was reasonably priced and not difficult to get to via car. It's an option for you if you want to focus on smallmouth and muskies."
6708385,Old Timer,2023-01-21 10:37:00,255,"I'm a different kind of cat. I fish Canada every year, but don't make reservations until shortly before I go. I've been doing that for many years and seldom have a problem finding a slot at a camp on my hit list. That said, June reservations are more difficult than for later months. But July and August provide very good fishing and the weather is more reliable. Call-and-go was easy when Canada had its Covid restrictions. IMO Canada will still see fewer fishermen than before the pandemic. Many have aged out of distant trips and long-standing traditions have been broken. It will be interesting to see if I'm wrong. That said, sports shows are a nice winter distraction."
6708387,Tristian5431,2023-01-21 11:02:00,37,Nice to meet you John! I met a few people from the WC forum as well! I appreciate those who gave me in person advice yesterday! The show was fun.. a bit overwhelming for a first timer hahah.. but I had so much fun I may ask my wife I can go to the Canada stop hahaha ! I had blast winter sux and I can't wait until the summer when I'm fishing in Ontario!
6708431,prov1800,2023-01-21 16:22:00,5010,Winter will be over soon
6707893,Tristian5431,2023-01-19 12:59:00,37,"Good Afternoon everyone, My plans changed. I was originally going to attend the All Canada show in Chicago, but I had a change in family commitment come up. This will be my first time attending the All Canada Show. I am bit nervous haha. What is your advice for a first timer? I printed out and highlighted the lodges that I want to chat with. I wrote down the following questions: Do you have my target species? (Musky&Smallmouth) Do you have guides available? What kind of boats do you have? Big water?Small Water? American plan? Accommodations? Any other questions that I should ask? How long do you talk to an outfitter for? PS I am scouting a lodge/experience for June 2023? I fished Lec Seul last summer and had a blast. I am looking to either go to the Vermillion Bay area or Lake of the Woods. I will be at the show on tomorrow Friday January 20th 2023! I attached a photo of myself and big smallmouth LOL ! If you see me at the show say hello. I will probably wearing a smallmouth bass tshirt!"
6707957,Da' Walleye Assassun,2023-01-19 19:06:00,358,June usually fills up first. Look for the first week in July. July 3rd is a full moon this year. Carry a full size calender with you for marking the available openings. When you see what you want be ready to jump on it. That is one beautiful smallie. Good luck on your search.
6707961,Eckohlt,2023-01-19 19:33:00,3685,"I would say get some dates that work for you and the outfitters n lake names,then come back to WC a post what you found and I'm sure plenty will chime in on it,if they have dealt with that outfitter and the fishing."
6707973,RichA$1970,2023-01-19 20:38:00,1159,"Wear some tall boots as every lodge there has Trophy Fishing and most attendees will have story after story to wow you. I’d ask “Do you own the resort? Will you be there when I’m there? How often do you fish or guide the lake(s)?” If they have pictures, I’d try to see if the person you are talking to are holding fish. Have fun and I’ll be there tomorrow early to enjoy what Canada has to offer along with some BS all in good spirits"
6707979,Tristian5431,2023-01-19 21:07:00,37,hahah I was thinking the same thing! everyone is going to say that they have trophy fishing ? lol how do I know who to believe.. I guess you don't really have a way.
6708019,nitroman,2023-01-20 05:59:00,368,"You have a group or go solo? Most camps as said before are full returning customers in June and have a hard time renting a cabin to a solo when they can fill it with 4-6-8 people. Cedar lake fits your bill and Cedar point resort has upgrade boats with 50hp motors, trolling motors, fish finders etc. Although not at the all canada show worth a look."
6708027,Bill Krejca,2023-01-20 06:21:00,6107,"I used to go to one of these shows, enjoyed talking with all the reps, etc. For a time, I collected the year spoons which were given away. Even if one has a camp picked out, it is still fun to attend one if it is close, just breaks up the winter. Bill"
6708033,Mojo-NC,2023-01-20 06:32:00,1929,"You may find it difficult to locate a ""really good place"" with availability for June 2023 this late in the game, because most of the June dates book up a year in advance. Guests have the opportunity to book the same week for the following year at their time of check out. Once they get a spot at a place they really like, they keep coming back year after year. Our group would narrow down our dates and then check lodges for availability immediately after the date passed in order to snag a cabin in the event someone did not rebook for the following year. Your best bet for now is to get recommendations for lodges that fit your main criteria from this website and call the places directly after you narrow down your search to just a few places. Use the show as an opportunity to meet the folks from the lodge or to help you choose between your finalists. Canada fishing is kinda like pizza, it's all good but some are definitely better than others. There is incredible smallie fishing on the Winnipeg River System around Minaki. Good luck!"
