6480764,BIGbmuskies,2020-09-05 11:59:00,9,Stayed at neilsons on rowan years ago. I was a rookie muskie guy at that point. Clear water lots and lots of muskie follows. Big fish in this lake. It was slow for us for bass and trout. Good news is there is a small portage lake above a water fall. Omg the walleye and bass fishing was off the charts. We first just walked to about 40 yards down a trail and decided to cast jigs and plastics from shore just above the waterfall. We had a walleye on almost every cast for an hour before sunset. Next morning we decided to fish that same lake in a boat. Did the trail and couldnt help but take a few casts above that same waterfall. No wallies... i stead we caught smallie after smallie with the odd largie mixed in. Rowan is a top mauskie lake but we had 33 degree celcious heat almost every day. Was 20 to 30 followers a day in that clear water.

6481194,Stu,2020-09-07 07:57:00,472,"I went there twice back when Don Pursch owned it. That was over 20 years ago and it's still the nicest place I've ever stayed. We caught a 52"" musky up in Miner's Bay and 2 others that were in the 40"" range. We caught some huge lake trout also. We stayed at the main lodge, so I can't comment on the outpost cabin. I looks like the new owners have kept it up really well. There is also another lodge to the northwest called Hook N' Horn. We found it by accident and it looks like a nice place. Good luck - Stu"
6481400,DD73,2020-09-07 20:40:00,131,"Yes, Pat and Cheryl do a great job. I’ve stayed at Nielsen’s (same lodge, different owners) and Rowan Lake Lodge and Alexander’s is fantastic. Hook n horn is now a corporate retreat type place. Alexander’s bought a cabin last year they’re turning into a second outpost place. Whether you stay at an outpost or at the lodge, a busy day on the water is seeing 3-4 boats in the distance. Great smallmouth, lake trout, and muskie fishing."
6481528,jambi,2020-09-08 09:27:00,504,This guy went to Rowan a few times. He did outposts for many years then switched to a lodge setting as he and his group were ready for the lodge vs outpost in their older years:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJfvurbvK_4 He has a few more Rowan videos also on Youtube
6485364,jackpotjohnny48,2020-09-20 10:57:00,153,"Yes, I've been to Rowan Lake 6 times. My dad and I went every year from 1991 to 1995, and then we went again in 2004. We fished some other famous Canadian musky lakes as well (LOTW, Eagle, Pipestone, Clearwater, Cedar, Canyon), but we always both agreed that of all the places we had gone, Rowan was by far the best musky water we had ever been on. I would guess that of the 200 largest muskies I've ever seen in my life, about 175 of them have been seen on Rowan Lake. There are days on Rowan where you can have 12 or 13 follows, and the smallest fish will be a 44 incher. Rowan is, BY FAR, the best lake I've been on in terms of overall average size of fish seen. Having said that, Rowan is extremely clear trout water, and during our daytime fishing hours we had a super high followers to eaters ratio. For every fish that actually hit a bait, we maybe had 40 to 50 follows. So, yes, those fish will follow (and they'll make your knees knock with how huge they are), but in terms of actually getting them to hit... I would suggest low light or after dark fishing. I would also suggest trolling. In the 16 years since I have last fished Rowan, I have fished some other oligotrophic / trout lakes, and have done well with trolling crankbaits after dark. I would imagine that if you were to troll crankbaits (Jakes, Grandmas, Triple Ds, Depth Raiders, etc) after dark on Rowan, you would most likely score heavily. In terms of Alexander's, I've heard good things about them. Back in the days when we fished Rowan, it was run by Don and Lynn Pursch, and was known as Nielsen's Fly-In. I do have a friend who's been taking a father / son trip there every year since 2013 and says it's really spectacular. (And the pics on the Alexander's Facebook page seem to suggest that they've done an excellent job of maintaining it, but I don't have any first hand experience with the new owners). In terms of the actual lake itself, I'm fairly convinced that Rowan is the absolute best musky lake on the planet. I personally consider Rowan Lake to be the ""Michael Jordan of musky lakes."" It's just a whole lot better than the rest, in my opinion, provided that you're targeting BIG fish. I hear it's quite good for lake trout as well, but when you're on a musky lake that's THAT good, we didn't want to waste any time fishing for lakers (we figured we could fish lakers elsewhere). Hope that helps, ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
6485372,adempsey2.0,2020-09-20 11:29:00,611,I believe they operate two outposts on the lake as well.

Ron Edmonds is the producer/author, and he is a veteran at this stuff. Hope it gives you a good idea of what to expect. Jim"
