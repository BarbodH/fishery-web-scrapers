6707871,5 of Diamonds,2023-01-19 11:46:00,151,Specifically looking for whatever fishing information (and any other info) I can find out about Lac Pletipi in Quebec - WNW of Manicouagan. Used the 'Search' function on this site and absolutely nothing came up for this Lac - sounds promising already! Anything any one can offer would be greatly appreciated. Thanks all!
6707875,Andre (wallyandre),2023-01-19 12:14:00,2274,Not much info on that outfitter. Do you target pikes and lake trouts?
6707951,5 of Diamonds,2023-01-19 18:43:00,151,"Yes, Northern Pike, Lake Trout & Brook Trout.Interesting that there's little to no information available about this lac...I'm certain that there's someone amongst us who knows more about this body of water than they're willing to share!"
6707953,Eckohlt,2023-01-19 18:58:00,3685,"There's a lot of people on here that don't know nothin about nothin,including me,and that body of water might be included about not knowing nothin."
6707959,phishfearme,2023-01-19 19:23:00,1242,"the issue here may be one of focus - the vast majority of the posts center around NW Ontario. nothing wrong with fishing in Quebec or Sask. or Manitoba or Yukon or Labrador or.... it's just that this board has evolved into a NW Ontario predominant board - the title ""NW Ontario, Eh?"" would be more appropriate than ""Canada Eh?"" . phish"
6707969,Andre (wallyandre),2023-01-19 20:35:00,2274,"@5 of diamonds, you live in Matagami and you are looking here for some infos and myself I couldn't not find a lot. What I found it's a lake with pikes and lake trouts and I didn't find anything for speckle trout"
6708011,Freytown,2023-01-20 05:22:00,770,Here's what I found.....hope it helps. FThttps://sortirauquebec.com/en/listin...oirie-pletipi/
6708081,Andre (wallyandre),2023-01-20 08:34:00,2274,"I've seen this. Not much informations. I saw a french tv show 7-8 years ago and they were focusing on lake trouts. There is some excellent outfitters in that area that offer: lake trouts, speckle trouts and landlock salmon"
6709187,Esoxmike,2023-01-24 18:32:00,114,"Bucky Adams was running a camp at pletipi,he had just started it I believe before the kung-flu shut everything down and after 2 years of no clients he shut it down,or so I’ve been told."
6709199,Esoxmike,2023-01-24 18:46:00,114,"I had spoke with bucky at length about this lake at a local outdoor show a few years ago.camp was previously owned by a bunch of rich individuals and used as a private fish camp for some amount of time,his plan was to run it as an outpost to public clients like us.Well this year I asked your buddy Jim how Bucky was doing(while chilling out at his north of matagami kilo 237 airbase)and it seems the shutdowns were more than he could handle with a new camp and the costs required while truddy kept the border shut."
