Yesterday morning three of us loaded out snowmobiles in my trailer for the first leg of the trip to one of our favorite trout lakes. We could have ridden the machines rather than haul them, but it saved us 45 minutes of riding in zero F temperatures, so we opted to ride in comfort and enjoy Canadian blended coffee on the first leg of the trip instead. Once we got to the point where the logging road was not plowed it was time to unload the machines and make the half hour ride to the lake. By the time we got there and drilled holes the temperature had risen nicely and best of all there was no wind. We had steady fishing action and caught one 10+ pound trout that was thrown back. It was one of those perfect winter days, the kind that make us appreciate what we have here in northwestern Ontario."
