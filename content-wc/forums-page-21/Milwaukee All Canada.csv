6710213,prov1800,2023-01-28 10:56:00,5010,It was very busy Jay.Id say pre covid shows.Not much of a chance for a break.Steady people streaming by and stopping to talk.
6710227,RichA$1970,2023-01-28 11:21:00,1159,I’ve been to all 3 and Milwaukee seems the smallest. The location was really good near a big mall & restaurants and the convention center was new & clean. I think there were around 65 camps there and I was there at the opening and there was a line of I bet 80 people waiting for the doors to open. I’m 52 and the majority of people I saw were in my age or older but I was there early. Hats off to Milwaukee for their show as I have not been to Kane County fairgrounds for a long time but it was a dump back then so I’ll see what it’s like next Thursday.
6710241,JAY221,2023-01-28 12:30:00,877,"Thanks for the response and I like what I hear! Sure would like to see these camps be back up to pre-covid groups. I'm sure many are like us and don't take much out of the resource so that it can continue to thrive. Later, Jay"
6710245,That Minnesota guy,2023-01-28 12:39:00,8293,Were there many camps that went out of business due to Covid or isn't anybody talking about that.
6710247,walleyecheek,2023-01-28 12:44:00,2231,Probably cheaper than a Fly-in no doubt ! And there's no Limit............lol.
6710275,7 Mag,2023-01-28 14:30:00,1887,"The camp I was at this past fall has been for sale for awhile, the camp owner has been selling sections of it and he's still trying sell more of it. Here's a few more: https://ontarioresortsforsale.net/"
6710281,prov1800,2023-01-28 14:52:00,5010,Our waters are thriving pretty good.With almost 2 complete summers of very little fish coming out of our waters there were a lot of huge schools of walleyes.Dont think the extra 2 years of covid fish was touched plus 2 spawns.Our size limits and possession limits seem to be doing very good.Also find some fisherman don't even want to take fish home.So another plus.There was only one camp that sold to covid.Young couple that didn't have years in like most camps.From what I hear most camps are already pretty much booked up for this coming season.So looking like another good season
6710295,Eckohlt,2023-01-28 15:29:00,3685,"If you buy enough fillets it's the same price as a flyin!they ain't near as fresh as,From the hook to the knife to the oil,don't get any better than that."
6710297,prov1800,2023-01-28 15:33:00,5010,Rather shop for fish from a boat on a secluded lake rather than walking through a boring store.
6710311,JAY221,2023-01-28 16:07:00,877,"The trips are priceless in MY opinion!! Later, Jay"
6709517,Bigtaproot,2023-01-26 06:28:00,900,Costco has good walleye that seems pretty fresh
6709527,Larry S,2023-01-26 07:10:00,665,"John, If I still lived in Chicago I would definitely drive up to the Milwaukee Show to meet you and your wife. Went every year to the All Canada Show in St Charles. Booked my first fly-in at the Show in 1980 My Dad started me going to sport shows by taking me in the 1950's to the Sport Show at Navy Pier in Chicago. Use to pick up all the brochures and Dad would let me fish for trout in trout pond Larry Schroeder, Henderson Nevada"
6709531,btyreprich,2023-01-26 07:22:00,1067,Sam's Club also has frozen Walleye fillets. Pretty tasty!

6710211,JAY221,2023-01-28 10:48:00,877,"Prov1800, Can you estimate attendance at the show? Is it getting back to pre covid or still at a standstill? Later, Jay"
6707511,Walleye2242,2023-01-18 07:55:00,263,as well have great memories of going to the show with dad and gramps as a kid. loved all the brochures. loved looking at the dream spots like Bud's gunisao fishing for 5 grand for 2 days. haha. would break out the brochures in the winter and look at the spots and where they were located. How much? how big was the lake? only spot on the lake? just things they would look for.
6707515,RichA$1970,2023-01-18 07:55:00,1159,"It’s a small bag but you’re right, it can go to the burn barrel this Spring Cleaning"
6707521,HeHooksHimself,2023-01-18 08:39:00,725,"Rich, we hope to catch you there, we will be browsing around Friday night and Saturday. John, also hope to catch you at the Latrelle booth. As usual we will touch base with Moss at Woman River and anyone else we might have run across in our many adventures in Canada. We are hoping to book an August trip with somebody this weekend. Also I didn't expect a spat on this thread from the kids that must have grabbed their dads I pad. Remember to keep them from your electronics! Hooks"
6707527,Eckohlt,2023-01-18 08:51:00,3685,Hooks it doesn't take much to get a spat going on here.See what these sports shows can do to people!
6707529,HeHooksHimself,2023-01-18 09:00:00,725,Right you are! And I didn't even mention the C word!
6707639,Stringbean,2023-01-18 13:49:00,279,"Is anyone going to the show in Green Bay? My wife and I are coming, but as soon as we enter the door, she goes over to the machines and I head for the show. I see my beer fund taking a real hit that weekend."

6707435,SweetD,2023-01-17 19:54:00,243,"Fond memories of going to the All Canada Show with my Dad who has since passed. That was when they used to come to Des Moines!!!!!Always made an evening of it and would collect bags full of brochures and rate sheets to review and assess for that next trip North! Always finished at a local Pizza joint for a combo pizza, pile of thick cut onion rings and a couple of beers served in those heavy frosted mugs!!!!Man do I miss those little one night adventures with my Pops!!!!"
6707445,prov1800,2023-01-17 20:34:00,5010,Sounds like a great time for sure
6707459,btyreprich,2023-01-17 21:14:00,1067,Our group used to do the same thing: collect brochures and then go out for pizza or burgers to decide where were going that year. I kept the brochures after we choose were to go as I just LOVED looking at all the lodges in Canada on a cold winter's evening.
6707461,RichA$1970,2023-01-17 21:58:00,1159,I still have 2 bags in my fishing closet- 1 bag of interested camps and the other bag of not interested. Usually on a cold winter night I’ll look through them just to stoke the fire until late May.
6707497,Eckohlt,2023-01-18 06:46:00,3685,Use the not so interested ones to get that fire going Rich.
