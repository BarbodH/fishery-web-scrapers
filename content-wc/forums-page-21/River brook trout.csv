I've done stupider things. Who knows maybe there is another fat stupid guy who likes to catch Brookies and would split it! LOL
6709385,Eckohlt,2023-01-25 14:06:00,3685,I know a lot of stupid skinny guys also lol.
6709417,yoopertrout,2023-01-25 16:25:00,1172,Thank you.

6709131,yoopertrout,2023-01-24 13:10:00,1172,Thank you. We are also interested in walleyes.

6709147,yoopertrout,2023-01-24 14:31:00,1172,"I'm not sure if we'll pull it off this year or next, but I'd be glad to share with you."
6709189,zenfish,2023-01-24 18:34:00,14,Thanks! I was actually wondering about the place you had gone previously and were disappointed.
6709195,yoopertrout,2023-01-24 18:43:00,1172,I'll pm you.
6709369,bthomas3333,2023-01-25 12:37:00,465,When I spend a day focused on Brookies I severely alter my catch expectation. These fish are not walleyes. I know experts who have fished for 4 days with two people in the boat on some of the best water in the world and have caught 40 fish with ~6 master anglers. That is 5-10 per person with 1-2 MA in a day. Sure you might have a day closer to 20 but you will also have days when you scratch out 1-2 and this is on great water.The only place that I have heard of 40-80 fish days is the Sutton. Gotta keep working on that diet!Brett
6709371,Eckohlt,2023-01-25 12:47:00,3685,"Fish n greens n exercise brett,you'll look like a fitness guru in no time!"
6708257,Moosebunk,2023-01-20 18:42:00,211,"I'd say 7 to 10 is probably the norm. I think we went in on the 10th and were scheduled out the morning of the 21st but instead were picked up on the 23rd. The initial 11 days (10 really for fishing) was enough. We held up two nights in one spot, twice. If doing it again, I'd go about 11 days again spending 6 days in the upper third, three through the middle and two from the Aquatuk down with a pick-up the morning of the 12th day. We were 100lbs even over the 100lb PP baggage limit. So 300lbs gear, me at 215lbs and Mike about 185lbs. 700lbs in the canoe was no issue. Again, if you can do it, do it while you're young, you'll never regret it and it will spoil you for river fishing brook trout."
6708269,bthomas3333,2023-01-20 19:33:00,465,The new limit is 320 per person including body weight and gear. If you are over it is 8000$ extra to fly overage in. So in your case 215+ 185=400 which would leave you 220. If you have 100 pp and an extra 100 you are over by 80. My buddy and I weigh 540. We'd have 80lbs total for gear and food. B-
6708405,Moosebunk,2023-01-21 12:07:00,211,"640 total minus our 400. Mike at the time may have even been closer to 165 and me maybe 210 so yeah, say 65lbs over we would have been. But luckily that day he and I had the Otter to ourselves for the trip up with some other cargo. We could have shaved 65lbs but really, I wouldn't have wanted to. Just for comfort and efficiency, we had what we had in that extra. And it's a long trip to really rough it. Friends of mine have made the weights though, even less than what's offered now."
6708513,lionfan19,2023-01-22 08:16:00,41,What about the outpost on Dusey Lake I think 7 Lakes outfitters operates out of Nakina. Its on the lake but the river both upstream and downstream is full of Brookies and from the photos Mike Borger has posted with his trip reports it looks like really good size and numbers. No doubt a notch below the Sutton but a lot less price and the logistics lot easier. Anyway worth looking into for a serious Brookie trip.
6708553,Eckohlt,2023-01-22 09:36:00,3685,"I flew in to fish brookies on the duesy a few years back,the ice went out early so my brother and I went in a week ahead of walleye opener,if the duesy is full of brookies well they took that week to go somewhere else n rest,we pounded the inlet n outlet everyday,got a total of 6 for the the week n lost a few others"
6708581,OldFootdoc,2023-01-22 11:16:00,393,"I can only speak to God's River Lodge. Prior to going there, I had never caught or sought to catch a Brookie. I went for the walleyes, northern and lakers. God's River Lodge did not disappoint. I have been fortunate enough to go maybe 5 or 6 times for a week at a time and the fishing has always been outstanding. We would go as early as possible and twice got there just as ice was coming off. I mean to the point where we would sometimes have to run along shoreline where the ice had melted because the center of the bay we needed to cross was still froze over. I know you are not interested in walleyes but one afternoon in the ""Graveyard"" my son caught and released 4 walleyes that exceeded 10 pounds throwing a crank bait. Another year, I took my son, nephew and a friend and also in the graveyard area, during shorelunch preperation, we were casting from shore and caught in excess of 50 walleyes and just guessing, none were under 3 pounds. Just throwing rattle traps, spoons, crank baits. As far as the brookies, it is mainly all river. The lodge is positioned at the start of the river as it drains God's lake so we even caught brookies by chance fishing from shore in the evening. By boat, you can stay close to the lodge in the river or you can travel as far as you are willing to go. Every trip had a master brookie and sometimes multiple brookies for each angler that went. The technique was interesting as an orange jointed rapala was always good just working the current but one technique that was fun was suggested by the camp cook. He gave me two pieces of bacon in a zip lock one morning and told me to tear off a small piece of bacon and put it on a small 1/16 oz jig. Cast it into the pools and slack water and let it drift with open bail for a while. He was absolutely right as brookies love bacon. I did not catch any large brookies with the bacon technique but fish probably up to 18"". Just great fun... My son and I hope to go back now that this covid situation is better understood."

Having never been there myself you may have saved myself and others from a good sales job. Thanks[/QUOTEDon't think that's a real fair representation of the dusey river. It's extremely difficult to target brook trout from an outpost camp. The best sections of river will require a lot of work to access, easily accessible doesn't always produce. Like the gentleman commented earlier about his coles lake trip, I took a lot of work to get rewarded. The original poster spoke of wilderness north as an option which it certainly is, once again you will need to go way downstream from makokibatan or way upstream from miminiska or fight your way upstream on the keezhik or troutfly but I wouldn't expect any action near the mouth. The Albany basin rivers are very good but not the Sutton which is mostly sea runs which explains the numbers and average size. The Sutton is unique because of this plus it's very easy to navigate."
6708733,Eckohlt,2023-01-22 18:42:00,3685,If you to no more just msg me.
6708799,zenfish,2023-01-23 04:55:00,14,"Yoopertrout: I'm doing the same research you are with the same goals. Labrador is all fly fishing which I don't do. I'm too **** fat for the Sutton. Right now God's River Lodge makes the most sense for me. A couple other ideas that Mike Borger shared with me: Osprey Lodge Quebec on Lk. Mistasinni and Mabec Outfitters Quebec. Of the 2, Mabec is more $$$ and Mike said probably a notch better but they do seem to kill a lot of fish there. Mistasinni is a great multi-species fishery which could save a day when the trout are off. Those two are lake fisheries and I know you are looking more at rivers but I thought I would throw them out there. Good luck in your search!"
6707695,yoopertrout,2023-01-18 17:24:00,1172,"I agree. I think there are a few lodges in Ontario that have great brook trout potential, but see them as just a side light to northern and walleye."

6707707,Eckohlt,2023-01-18 17:43:00,3685,"Many yeas ago I flew into Atwood lake and busted my way through the bush to a stream coming into Atwood lake,caught a few nice brookies,but took some abuse to get at them,wasn't really worth it.You got me excited talking about brookies,an adventure to great brookie fishing would be a blast."
6707727,3M TA3,2023-01-18 18:49:00,2846,"I'll agree the Nipigon River is pretty remarkable. Gord Ellis used to guide it, probably still does. He is top dog in the Thunder Bay area for so many other outdoor activities as well. Here is a photo of Richard Kraus on one of his outings with Gord fly fishing the Nipigon A tad over 7 lbs. We stayed at the Quebec Lodge in Red Rock and our host Ray Rivard took care of every need with outstanding food and accommodations too. Definitely should check it out. Pretty close to the UP too.PS The Nipigon produced the world record Brook Trout a very long time ago, but still remarkable. Over 14 Lbs. Oh yeah. Catch and Release"
6707765,yoopertrout,2023-01-18 20:21:00,1172,Thank you. What was the fishing like in terms of numbers of trout?
6707839,3M TA3,2023-01-19 09:54:00,2846,Well some days better than others. Certainly nothing like God's River/Lake however the cost and logistics is nothing like it either. A good day could produce a dozen nice fish and I'd say that would depend on the skills of the fly fisher as well. Gord definitely will put you on fish. So will a couple of the other guides as well. Of course time of year is key too.
6707853,Moosebunk,2023-01-19 10:45:00,211,"Fished Nipigon about two dozen times. Hard to beat the average size of fish for the price but, if wanting to pay what you're thinking you might, you could do it in other places like Labrador. Have met folks and have a friend who have fished Gods for brook trout. I hear it's great but those who have also fished or know others that have visited the Sutton would tell you that there is little comparison. The Sutton is the mecca, and why? River fishing, DIY, brook trout from Hawley Lake all the way down that 90 miles to the sea, trip length whatever you want to make it, HUGE adventure, wildlife ++, amazing paddle with no portaging and a daily speck average of about 75 fish per two people. Brookies that take ANYTHING you throw at them, including big surface baits like mice skirted across the river, right down to dry Griffiths Gnats drifting. Chuck hardware like spoons and there's so many fish I personally got bored of it. The fly was more fun. There might be days of 20-40 fish but those are usually poor weather, longer make-break-camp days, etc. You put in an honest full days fishing whether drifting in the canoe the entire time or getting out at the many, many, many fish looking spots to fly fish, you'll hammer 'em the entire trip. Our 12 days yielded 100's of fish. Official best average count may be found in the old write up here. https://bunksoutdoorangle.com/a-sutton-river-trout-fishing-specktacle/"
6707879,bthomas3333,2023-01-19 12:20:00,465,I agree the Sutton is the Mecca but the weight limit for two guys like me and my fishing partner who are 6'3 and 6'4 make it impossible. Also getting to God's River is very easy. Fly to Winnipeg. Pick a hotel. The Expediter meets you at customs exit and takes you to your hotel. In the morning they drive you to the small air strip and they fly you to God's River community which is only a 5 min drive to the River/Lodge after you land. B-
6707895,yoopertrout,2023-01-19 12:59:00,1172,Thank you. It sounds great.

6707567,yoopertrout,2023-01-18 11:09:00,1172,"Hello, A friend and I want to fish for trophy brook trout in rivers. We are willing to spend more than we usually have, and make this a once (or maybe twice in a lifetime trip.) We could spend 4-5k. We can't spend the 8k that most labrador lodges get. It seems like many of the Ontario camps promote catch and kill, which makes me concerned that their rivers get over-fished. My wife and I went to a place that promoted brook trout fishing a few years ago - lots of dead fish pictures and we had little luck (same with everyone in camp, even those that used a guide.) Some friends had the same experience at another place. Brook trout seem to be easily over-exploited. So, we are looking for a place that promotes catch and release. We'd like to catch brook trout that are bigger than we get down in Wisconsin/Michigan (up to 12"" with a few up to 14"" and a rare fish of 15""-17"". We'd like to fly fish. We are looking at Wilderness North Outfitters. Everything about them looks good. Has anyone been there? Any other recommendations? Thank you."

6707603,DeBo,2023-01-18 12:05:00,211,If you are doing a trip of a lifetime for brook trout I’d take a hard look at the Sutton River in Ontario. It’s a float/camp trip but looks incredible. Moosebunk on this site has a big write up on his site. BunksOutdoorAngle.Never been but that trip looked amazing.Gods river always comes up for Brookies too. I think the New Fly Fisher has an episode from there coming this weekend on their YouTube channel.
6707607,Bill Krejca,2023-01-18 12:25:00,6107,"Yeah, my first thought, Nipigon second thought. Haven't fished either. Bill"
6707609,Camoclad,2023-01-18 12:28:00,628,"I would look at Pipestone Fly-in Outposts (www.pfo.net) and inquire about Coles Lake. It is a fly-in camp and there is a section of the lake where the river flows in that you can catch native brook trout. It is a blast, though not for the faint of heart, it is a bit adventurous getting into the river and navigating the deadfall, rocks, current, etc. My brother and I spend two days trying to figure out how to access and catch trout and once we did it was game on, and the fishing was amazing! Huge trout, all caught and released, and PFO encourages Catch Photo Release all brookies. They have had a few clients over the years who visited Coles solely for flyfishing the creeks/river. Quality gear (waders, rod, tackle) are a must if you want to spend a week doing this. Doesn't hurt that the lake of full of walleyes either! It was fun but I confess, I much preferred the jigging in the boat to being in the creek."

6707631,Eckohlt,2023-01-18 13:37:00,3685,Nothing worse than seeing big discolored dead fish on a website in my opinion.
6707653,bthomas3333,2023-01-18 14:37:00,465,I'd take a look at God's River Lodge. You get a full service lodge and guides to run through the rapids of God's River which is Excellent Brook Trout water.. In my experience they are expert boat handlers in fast moving water and do a good job of holding in the pools below the rapids. Assuming normal water levels there are plenty of good spots where they can drop you off and you can fish from shore or from the rocks in the 40 miles of river they run.Many many Master angler brookies caught in June but price is reduced if you wait and fish July-sept. I'm headed back in Sept 23. A week for 2 after June is around 3000 guided / American plan per person.The Sutton River its an amazing choice too. Around $5000 serious weight restrictions. (How's that diet going?) McKenzie River Lodge in Labrador (5500 / plus air) is on my list.Take a look. Hope this helps!Brett
