6711363,Eckohlt,2023-02-02 17:19:00,3685,"I think you need a root canal,dispose of it!"
6711043,Bigtaproot,2023-02-01 12:41:00,900,It is the meat that attracts them I guess
6711049,RichA$1970,2023-02-01 12:54:00,1159,Like Sam the butcher bringing Alice the meat!
6711057,Eckohlt,2023-02-01 14:00:00,3685,"I better gain some weight,thanks the tip Bigtap!"
6711121,Bigtaproot,2023-02-01 19:03:00,900,I think there is a big difference in how one is perceived being the head meat man as opposed to just an ordinary butcher
6711159,pjshorthorn,2023-02-02 02:28:00,5654,Fancy titles like Head Meat Man don't mean doodley squat it is what you do with that fancy title that makes the difference. PjShorthorn
6711245,Eckohlt,2023-02-02 10:58:00,3685,It's probably the Root of all evil!
6711251,prov1800,2023-02-02 11:12:00,5010,Is this anything like being a master baiter
6711287,RichA$1970,2023-02-02 13:38:00,1159,Does that mean beating your meat?
6711297,prov1800,2023-02-02 14:04:00,5010,Maybe to tenderize
6711331,Bigtaproot,2023-02-02 15:16:00,900,"or to practice ""hand to gland combat"""
6710585,Eckohlt,2023-01-29 16:57:00,3685,"Now your talkin,save that funeral money n go on a fishing trip or two!"
6710587,Eckohlt,2023-01-29 17:00:00,3685,"Bigtap,did ladies use the light switch for you??"
6710595,Eckohlt,2023-01-29 18:07:00,3685,"Get one of those custom suits ready,your gonna need it in the near future."
6710633,RichA$1970,2023-01-29 22:39:00,1159,". Yep, my great uncle Bud we dropped his ashes on Leech Lake just on the west side of Goose Island in front of his old cabin and then we went fishing as that’s all he would have wanted for us."
6710635,RichA$1970,2023-01-29 22:42:00,1159,"It’s ready, just got to watch the fish fry’s or waistline as I have around 15 more months before I wear it."
6710667,Eckohlt,2023-01-30 06:52:00,3685,"Months fly by fast Rich,be here before ya know it,then the two most important words you need to remember (I DO ),then after that my favorite line,,,,,Let's go fish'n."
6710939,prov1800,2023-01-31 21:07:00,5010,Just switch to baking in parchment paper.Its actually very good.no breading only bit of olive oil.No mess either.Gallon of cooking oil up around 15 bucks a gallon.Headed out in the morning with my son and grandkid.Another -30 night.Will have the heater on high for a while.
6710951,Eckohlt,2023-02-01 05:12:00,3685,"KC eye tonight,killer krumbs.good luck fishing today."
6711001,Bigtaproot,2023-02-01 08:28:00,900,"I will admit that I am not the best looking man on the board so I am sure many women have been after my wallet rather than looks. I also think women are attracted the the power of saying, my man is the head meat man"
6711009,Eckohlt,2023-02-01 08:52:00,3685,"Well you said you lost a lot of cash,so the wallet theory is out the window!"
6710365,prov1800,2023-01-28 20:59:00,5010,19 footer.lol.
6710393,walleyecheek,2023-01-29 05:26:00,2231,Girl's all get prettier at close'n time ! (Micky Gilley)...LOL.
6710395,Eckohlt,2023-01-29 05:44:00,3685,"Seen some know matter what time the bar closes,they ain't gonna look pretty! LoL"
6710403,JAY221,2023-01-29 06:28:00,877,"That just means you didn't start drinking early enough!!!! Probably a slow starter. Later, Jay"
6710437,Eckohlt,2023-01-29 07:50:00,3685,"Plenty morning start at 8am when a few local bar opened,Most of the time didn't even make it till 5pm.lol,those days are long gone though."
6710529,Bigtaproot,2023-01-29 13:01:00,900,No that is true stallion talk
6710531,Bigtaproot,2023-01-29 13:02:00,900,Very true but remember those big city folks laugh at you when they see you at a wedding or funeral dressed like you just got out of Fleet Farm
6710533,Bigtaproot,2023-01-29 13:03:00,900,"Remember, beauty is just a light switch away"
6710547,JAY221,2023-01-29 13:38:00,877,"So very true! Later, Jay"
6710561,RichA$1970,2023-01-29 14:25:00,1159,"Haha, I haven’t been to a wedding or funeral in years and if needed, I still have 2 custom suits I got made in Thailand for less than those big city tackle boxes I see up there. Luckily all my close family have in their plans just ship the slab to crematorium and dump the ashes on the farm or the lake per their wishes and save the $$$ for a funeral, grave & tombstone."
6709905,RichA$1970,2023-01-27 08:29:00,1159,I was on a fly-in and an old man brought a lazy boy on the plane when we were leaving. Can’t blame him as Chimo Hornby Outpost hasn’t updated it since it was built. Good fishing but not a comfortable cabin.
6709949,Eckohlt,2023-01-27 11:33:00,3685,"I took a lazy boy on a flyin also,the kind with 2 legs,he couldn't sweep the floor once a day,he said he was on vacation,that's my lazy boy story.Rich is that chair still in the Hornby cabin??"
6709957,RichA$1970,2023-01-27 11:51:00,1159,"I’ve had plenty of those showing up on both hunting & fishing trips. At least Big Mike up front said he’s just loafing around camp, no chores but he paid for all the gas and meals on the way there. Funny thing is that old boy left it there but the next year it was gone so who knows what happened to it. When we left Hornby this June Tim in our group gave the owner a list of things to fix as we were the 1st group since Covid up there. He told the owner for the trophy Lake price of $1,400 for the 90 mile fly-in at least they could make sure the toilet worked, the outhouse wasn’t overflowing, the fish cleaning table was a rotted piece of D rating plywood outside, holes in the screens, just metal folding chairs and of course he drew the leaking boat. Tim’s 78 and said when he was younger he could Tolerate it but said he’s done with them as he also goes to Slate Falls which sets the standard for outposts. Hopefully the chair isn’t in the middle of lake as it looked comfortable."
6709961,Eckohlt,2023-01-27 12:03:00,3685,"Big mike can ride with Me,gas n meals would give him a free pass for the chores.The chair could have ended up being a fire starter for the fire pit,that's sad to hear about Hornby,I enjoyed every trip there."
6710047,Bigtaproot,2023-01-27 17:08:00,900,I want brought a futon with me. That is the Japanese word for uncomfortable
6710061,Eckohlt,2023-01-27 17:35:00,3685,If you drink enough nothing is uncomfortable!
6710063,prov1800,2023-01-27 17:49:00,5010,I have a group of guys that when they leave the camp they were at I take them for a day crappie fishing.One of there boats had a BBQ on the front deck and they made burgers and toasted the buns to at lunch for 7 off us while we were spotlocked in 40 km winds catching crappies.It was great
6710071,Eckohlt,2023-01-27 18:11:00,3685,I'm sure it wasn't a 14ft flyin type boat with a 9.9
6710093,JAY221,2023-01-27 19:12:00,877,"That also goes for women. They all look good if you drink enough! Later, Jay"
6710111,RichA$1970,2023-01-27 20:31:00,1159,Amen!
6709525,Bigtaproot,2023-01-26 07:09:00,900,Make sure you hit either Krolls East or Al's hamburger shop
6709543,Eckohlt,2023-01-26 07:58:00,3685,Bigtap where you headed fishing this year??
6709687,Bigtaproot,2023-01-26 13:40:00,900,Do not have any firm plans as of yet. I have lost so much money that I might actually be fishing farm ponds with a cane pole. I would like to give Lake Saint Joe a try
6709693,RichA$1970,2023-01-26 13:49:00,1159,"Camp Lake St Joe is for sale, $850k and that can be your investment you can manage."
6709703,Eckohlt,2023-01-26 14:02:00,3685,"Did you look for the money you lost,where do you think you lost it??"
6709715,RichA$1970,2023-01-26 14:35:00,1159,"This is no way directed at anyone specific but I always laugh when I see the big city fishermen at the float docks with tackle boxes as big as suitcases, rod tubes bigger than an AT-4 anti-tank missle and gear bags like they are deploying. I think their gear could pay for several trips when all you need are some jigs, spoons, bucktails and a couple of cranks."
6709727,prov1800,2023-01-26 14:45:00,5010,Glad you mentioned this.It is something I see quite often.I can handle a couple of walleye boxes but when I get muskies guys in my boat I have to draw the line.Those huge muskie lure boxes are huge.I tell them to take 5 lures out and leave the boxes on the dock or take them back to cabin.I usually suggest the lures they bring.Usually a bucktail is used most of the day.lol.
6709743,Eckohlt,2023-01-26 15:38:00,3685,"Years ago on a flyin on the ogoki reservoir short lake,a guy brought a smoker and he cooked a turkey in the boat all day,you knew where his boat was from a half mile away,turkey cooking signals."
6709887,Bigtaproot,2023-01-27 07:51:00,900,That is actually really cheap.
6709903,RichA$1970,2023-01-27 08:23:00,1159,I just wonder what the land lease terms & conditions are as it was built in the 80’s.
6708981,Obabikon,2023-01-23 16:49:00,2370,"I sat out on the Milwaukee show, but I might add it in 2024. So, Green Bay this weekend will be my first of the season. Pretty excited to talk fishing with everyone! Come on out and support the circuit if you can! After a few tough years, I'm sure they would love to see some amazing attendance numbers!"
6708983,RichA$1970,2023-01-23 16:55:00,1159,"Milwaukee had a great venue, location and crowd. Hope to meet you if you go to the Kane County show."
6709001,prov1800,2023-01-23 19:05:00,5010,Agreed Milwaukee was good.Great meeting with you Rich.Thx for the hat.In Virginia right now and will do the 5 hrs tomorrow to get home and then maybe fish a bit on Wednesday and chrisen that hat in the shack.
6709007,RichA$1970,2023-01-23 19:18:00,1159,"John, safe travels to you and your wife and keep living the dream for us. Hope to see you this summer or fall if I’m passing through VB."
6709009,Eckohlt,2023-01-23 19:20:00,3685,Did Rich give you a hat with his picture on it??
6709025,fishin779,2023-01-24 03:54:00,63,"When and where is the Kane County Show ? The show in my area is not very exciting, imo, and Kane County might be a nice weekend for me and Momma !"
6709027,Riding high,2023-01-24 04:28:00,69,Kane County fair grounds st Charles il. February 2-5. Should be a good one.
6709031,RichA$1970,2023-01-24 05:37:00,1159,Feb 2-5 in St Charles right off Rt 38 and Randall Rd so there’s a lot of shopping and restaurants nearby. I haven’t been to the Fairgrounds for years but the surrounding location is nice.
6709457,prov1800,2023-01-25 19:10:00,5010,No picture.Hopefully you will see the hat in some pics tomorrow as iam off to shack tomorrow.Need a fishing fix and shacks are open tomorrow.Going early.Been fished hard so hope those fish aren't shy.
6709461,Eckohlt,2023-01-25 19:28:00,3685,"What fish are down there need a break and a trip to the dentist,they take a pounding for sure,they might be waving a white flag john before you drop a jig to them."
