6710459,prov1800,2023-01-29 08:40:00,5010,Well I went out to load my stove up and really didn't feel any warmer.

6710467,prov1800,2023-01-29 08:42:00,5010,Same here.Got to love it.haha.
6710471,Spurgery,2023-01-29 08:52:00,79,Much less snow so far this year than last up there? Long way to go but wonder what water levels will be like by the time late May rolls aroundâ€¦.
6710473,prov1800,2023-01-29 09:01:00,5010,We do have quite a bit of snow really.My snow banks from plowing are pretty normal looking.Water levels were low in the fall as usuall and will get some spring melt to bring it up.Definately not going to be like last year.
