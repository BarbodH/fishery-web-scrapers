6709179,Stringbean,2023-01-24 18:06:00,279,Anyone know what the housekeeping cabin rates are? How am I supposed to make a decision on booking if they don't let me know upfront what the cost is going to be?

Actually, I was looking for rates at Wiley's Point Camp on LOW. I haven't fished LOW for so many years. I used to head for Lac Seul every summer. Now, we just settle for a smaller lake like Gullrock."

I also noticed several camps at the All Canada show who did not include their rate sheets in their brochures which is shady imo, but their business model to run. Plenty of choices out there and I prefer just making my list and calling 10 days in advance to see who has an opening which hasn’t been a problem for me."

Later I got a call back from a woman and I asked if Totem had posted rates. She said no, and asked the particulars of the trip I was interested in. I gave them to her and she said she'd get back to me in an email with the quote. She did so. I suspect that's their standard routine. I'm with Rich on the ten-day call-and go-program. So far it's always worked."
