6709205,drlee,2023-01-24 18:58:00,409,"North Albany Lodge near Pickle Lake, North of Ignace, ONT. Want to do true wilderness? Look at their website for a portage in lake that will blow you away. Off the grid, big time. Not expensive. Hassle free. You will be amazed. I have NO tie to this camp. In fact, have not done the portage personally. But, I have fished the Pashkokogan System and talked to many die hard fishermen about this opportunity. Just check it out."
6709223,RichA$1970,2023-01-24 19:57:00,1159,"Eck, any thoughts for 2024 there? Looks good to me along with Southshore Lodge on Eagle."
6709293,rockape,2023-01-25 07:22:00,215,"I've walleye and musky fished near the camp. It is great fishing for sure. We stay in Sioux Lookout and trailer to Deception Bay. Takes some time to do that, and then make the hour run up to Chamberlain Narrows. We fish all the spots on the way up. Sometimes never get past Bearpaw. I've always wanted to stay there. My friends don't want to spend that much though. Has to be about even with all the gas we burn! If you do a fly-in or a drive to north of Lac Seul, you might be hard pressed to find a lake up there with Musky in it if that is important to you. My biggest pike in NWO are totally from Minnitaki. Fished Minnitaki, Lac Seul, Eagle, Cedar, Big V, Pelican, Abram, and probably a few I don't remember now. Minnitaki is pretty much a guarantee for a big pike if you know the spots and target them. Maybe little to no Musky to compete with them is the reason there is a good population of fish over 36. Bottom line. Just fish Lac Seul! The crown jewel of North American freshwater fishing! I'm getting warmed up in 2 weeks casting for slob largemouth down on Okeechobee! Jonzin' to fish!!"
6709299,Eckohlt,2023-01-25 07:30:00,3685,"Fall of 2024 I'm open to most anything rich,it's a ways off but I'll have some thoughts by then,I'm always thinking n researching,maybe a few more here on WC want to join in on an adventure fall of 2024."
6707989,pjshorthorn,2023-01-20 01:56:00,5654,Pike and Muskie can be outstanding if you concentrate on those species. We have caught 40+ pike jiggin for walleye. PjShorthorn
6707991,pjshorthorn,2023-01-20 02:00:00,5654,You are correct about Bear Narrows ..always take a wide bearth around the red buoy heading into the narrows. If one goes inside the bouy it is going to be a bad day. PjShorthorn
6708045,Mojo-NC,2023-01-20 07:01:00,1929,"I can confirm that everything PJ stated about the area is correct, as I was one of those fellers fishing with him this past July. We were not at the lodge he mentioned, but were in a houseboat very close by. As far as navigation goes, I converted my Lowrance HDS unit to portable and have it loaded with the Navionics chip for Canada. The navigation route was spot on for the long boat ride up to the Narrows area. The pike and walleye fishing was excellent, even with the record high water levels of this past season. We didn't catch any muskies and only a few smallmouth bass, but we never targeted either species, so there is that. Even though the place is located on Lac Seul, it didn't really seem that busy, and we didn't have to experience the crowds that have been mentioned previously on the lake. There were obviously other boats in the area, but they didn't bother us and we didn't bother them. We're all up there for the same reasons, to fish a great area and enjoy the peace and quiet of the Northwest Ontario wilderness. Win win!"
6708075,Yellowfin123,2023-01-20 08:17:00,2182,"well thats that.... with the fish numbers and the location one could probably put lac seul outpost in the same classification as a ""fly in outpost"" lake"
6708129,Old Timer,2023-01-20 10:21:00,255,"There are many private cabins on the Canadian side of LOTW and Rainy Lake that are routinely rented out to fishing groups. However,, my fishing buddies wouldn't be happy if I gave up where we've stayed over the years. But that said, a simple internet search will disclose a bunch of available options. I like Canadian LOTW and Rainy because the fishing is always good and both lakes are close to the border. Some of the suggestions posted here are another three to four hour drive each way. No thanks."
6708131,7 Mag,2023-01-20 10:30:00,1887,"Here's a camp you might consider, they have a lot of repeats each year.http://www.peffleyscamp.com/"
6708133,Old Timer,2023-01-20 10:31:00,255,"Rather than being no help at all, take a look at rainylakecabinrental.com I haven't stayed there, but have fished the islands and the adjacent passage near this cabin. It's a well protected area with good fishing nearby. And if you have a remote border crossing permit you can buzz back and forth to the Kettle Falls Hotel for a meal or a few beers."
6708155,proguidedream,2023-01-20 11:13:00,345,there are some very very nice Island Air BNBs that suite your needs on lake of the woods posting this just as one example. https://www.airbnb.ca/rooms/17209283...Item=369241538
6708313,pjshorthorn,2023-01-21 03:18:00,5654,It was a great trip .I'm ready to do it again. I'm still not over knocking the son's 40+ pike off trying to land it just before your arrival in Hudson. I have to go back there and redeem myself. PjShorthorn
6708317,pjshorthorn,2023-01-21 03:28:00,5654,Anderson's will fly in folks to their Outposts camps . They have 3 camps close to where I fish and one more that is quite a run.I rarely have had an issue fishing close to anyone. It seems all the fly in clients tend to make long runs even though some of the best fishing is about 5-10 minutes from their cabin. PjShorthorn
6707645,RichA$1970,2023-01-18 14:10:00,1159,I prefer pike any day and just fish for walleyes to break up the day. I do like reading and hearing favorite pike lakes on this site.
6707649,Old Timer,2023-01-18 14:15:00,255,"Another option might be Totem's French Narrows outpost on LOTW. It's located in the center of the lake and on the main flowage. One of the better fishing areas on LOTW. Full disclosure I haven't stayed there, but have boated by several times. Looks like it might be what you're looking for. I've considered it myself."
6707655,RichA$1970,2023-01-18 14:43:00,1159,"I looked into them and unless I missed it, they don’t publish rates which really sucks imo. It’s a drop-down menu of tell us what you want and we’ll get back to you so leaves the customer guessing. They were featured on a Lindner show last year for pike that caught my interest but I’m sure there were 2 guide boats behind the cameras and the tab was $0 so of course the fishing is astounding."
6707683,Hunts1,2023-01-18 16:49:00,123,"Lac Seul Outposts is great! Very accommodating with equally great location. Ken and Brenda run a tight ship and the accommodations are as good as you can get in a remote setting. Fish cleaning house, gas available, minnows, charging station for batteries, outlets to run cords to your inboard charger (bring your own cord), small shop too. Fishing is outstanding, usually, There are lots of rocks to be mindful of so you can't buzz around on what looks to be open water. Just be careful and ask them about what to look out for. We have been there about 15 times and always have a great experience! As noted about 1 hr boat ride in. That is one of my favorite experiences. You can't go wrong with them! We have caught 30 walleye, 40+ pike, and 50+ Muskie. Smallies too. Always new water to explore even after all these trips. Can't wait to return in June!"
6707685,Hunts1,2023-01-18 16:53:00,123,"Pricey, YES. Worth it, ABSOLUTELY."
6707755,SweetD,2023-01-18 19:47:00,243,"Ghost River has an outpost’ish cabin called Sahlins Oupost but you are not alone on the system. They do have some pretty cool boat to portages including going through a rock tunnel and another through a super larger tube. They have many other portage lakes you can visit as well where you will be the only one on the lake. Be sure to hit Singapore lake if you go. Very scenic on the entire system with falls, rapids, rivers and of course alll lake structures. Cool place to visit and fish. They did have dock service but you had to boat to the main camp and they would fill your boat gas, get you bait etc.Good luck"
6707761,Bill Krejca,2023-01-18 20:14:00,6107,"Maybe not meeting all the noted criteria, but O'Sullivan's Rainbow has an outpost cabin which is right in the middle of some great fishing. It has an outhouse, and no shower, but the fishing is good for walleye, pike, and some trout. Very secluded, without a super long run to the main camp. Bill"
6707813,adempsey2.0,2023-01-19 08:49:00,611,"Here are a few that I know of. I only know they are boat-in outpost camps. Nothing else.

6707955,LoDo,2023-01-19 19:05:00,721,Thanks for all the recommendations.
6707987,pjshorthorn,2023-01-20 01:54:00,5654,"Pretty dang close. Just took a HB trip last July to this same area. The fellas with me had their GPS and I navigated the lake with a map. They were really really close to one another,. Having said that, there are sleepers all over the lake so one still has to be somewhat careful. If you don't know the lake really well, stick to GPS. I started learning this section of Lac Seul 40 years ago and still enjoy using a map Ala pre GPS days. PjShorthorn"
6707451,LoDo,2023-01-17 20:43:00,721,"Anyone have some outpost camps they've had success at in last decade? I'm looking for 3bed/1bath, sleeps 6 updated outpost. Walleye and northern fishery. $800 to $2k week per person. Cabin, fish house, growler, 3 piece bath, private dock / dock fee, etc.... NW Ontario, Kenora, Vermillion, Ear Falls or Red Lake area. Thank you,"
6707465,pjshorthorn,2023-01-18 01:04:00,5654,"Look into Lac Seul Outposts. They check off all your boxes. Long run from the launch, but they guide you in and out. Minimum HP on a personal boat used to be 40 hp. Takes about an hour to get to camp. Fairly remote fishing with a lot of options close to camp. The outpost sits right in the middle of Chamberlain Narrows. Probably my favorite place to fish in NWO. PjShorthorn"
6707477,jimirjr,2023-01-18 05:26:00,1149,THIS ^^^^ What Pat says....
6707525,HeHooksHimself,2023-01-18 08:51:00,725,We stayed at the outpost on the system several years ago. It is not that remote but you can save yourself a long trip from the main camp to the best fishing spots. It has a shower house and I can't remember if it had an inside toilet. Paul and Deb are great hosts and will set you up for a good week. Fish On! Hooks
6707599,kswalleyer,2023-01-18 12:03:00,1651,how accurate is the GPS mapping for that area?
6707613,Yellowfin123,2023-01-18 12:30:00,2182,"I haven't been there yet but for what the OP described , i'd put 1 more vote in for the lac seul outpost! Ive never seen alot of reports on how the pike fishing is though but thats where i'd be headed for a boat-in"
6707615,RichA$1970,2023-01-18 12:33:00,1159,Never been there but a great website with details and good information that helps. I don’t understand how some of these camps don’t update their websites as it’s a low investment for easy marketing.
6707629,Stringbean,2023-01-18 13:33:00,279,"I would suggest you get a very good map of Lac Seul. When you get up near Bear Narrows, there are plenty of rocks just under the water. You need to be very careful. Every year, you hear horror stories in the camps around Sioux Lookout"
6707635,Yellowfin123,2023-01-18 13:44:00,2182,"very true, just makes no sense why alot of these places don't update their websites and they probably lose business because of it.. all the guys on WC never talk much about the pike size and numbers, just mainly about the mega walleye numbers when you see the ""jacbobson fish"" ""64 inch musky"" it does make you want to bring the musky gear if you get bored with the walleye and want a change of pace one day"
6707643,Carnhzkr,2023-01-18 13:54:00,964,"I have been to LS Outposts once (PJShorthorn has been many there times). I just wanted to add that it isn't really an ""outpost"". At least not what I would call an outpost. It's a boat-in camp with 10 - 12 cabins. Not that that's a bad thing, but it isn't a single stand-alone outpost cabin like a fly-in outpost. As far as mapping, it's like the rest of Lac Seul. The maps are great for navigating to and from your fishing spots, but they don't mark the majority of reefs, so you'll need to use caution and lay down a track to follow. Also, it's a bit pricey for what it is. You could almost do a fly-in for what they charge. I get it, though, they have to boat in everything so they have to recover a lot of overhead. Neat area, though. I'd love to get back there."
