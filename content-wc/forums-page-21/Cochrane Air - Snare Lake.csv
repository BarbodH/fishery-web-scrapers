6709469,Da' Walleye Assassun,2023-01-25 19:53:00,358,Tell us about the service and charges issues. My last fly-in outfitter charged everyone for boat and motor insurance.
6709473,Moosebunk,2023-01-25 20:15:00,211,"Thanks for sharing Fooch! I remember we did 5 days and a high 30 pike was about the best caught too. Downriver on the Mikwam, to I think the next one is Magiskan, we met some dudes that came over from the next lake downriver still. They caught an over 40 in Magiskan. Our best walleye fishing was the weedline directly across from camp and if memory serves, a narrow spot and point over on Bateman. Enjoyed seeing the odd sturgeon jump in the lake. Honestly seems like a lifetime ago. 100 fish in 4 days for 4 guys isnt that bad for there but no, those lakes aren't all that great compared to some other places. Good luck next round."
6709477,fooch1199,2023-01-25 20:22:00,10,"Four guys in their beaver plane says 1540 lbs. We usually are always over weight and we don't care about it but figured we would never be over at that weight. Charged us 400 lbs overweight and flew a second plane in with our stuff. Which was ridiculous as our plane was almost empty. Opened the fridge door when we arrive and it fell off lol. Used a roll of tuck tape to secure it to the fridge. Asked pilot to take a photo when we were leaving at base and he was so mad as he wanted to leave. Just not a mom and pops organization. Felt like all they cared about was money. Sent a collection agency after me for minutes used on their sat phone, which I though was included and yes I paid them."
6709483,Da' Walleye Assassun,2023-01-25 20:42:00,358,"Sadly, it seems like SOME outfitters are trying to make up profit for the lost covid years. Sorry for your experience. Many decent outfitters are still in business and treat their customers right."
6709485,fooch1199,2023-01-25 21:10:00,10,"Hey Moosebunk, Its not for us always about the fishing. I do love to fish but just the feeling of the plane flying away and us on an adventure. Nothing beats that. Really is the best feeling."

6709735,Hillbiehle,2023-01-26 14:57:00,66,"Somewhat related but my very first fly in trip was with Lindbergs (out of Cochrane) and we went to Mikwam in 1992 or so. Terrible lake and terrible cabin. The positive outcome of this was the education we received by knowing what to watch out for and what better questions to ask for future outfitters/lakes. To be fair, the expectation of cabins back then vs todays standards are different."
6709739,Eckohlt,2023-01-26 15:24:00,3685,"For me north of nakina and west,no desire to fish east of nakina,always good fishing."
6709917,Hillbiehle,2023-01-27 08:54:00,66,"Excatly. That was one of our biggest takeaways from that area. Sioux Lookout to Red Lake area, has been our tradition for the past 30 years..."
6663180,fooch1199,2022-06-09 11:17:00,10,"Myself and three friends have booked with Cochrane Air August 14-19 and going to Snare Lake. Has anyone been there before? Any information will help. The past couple years we went to Kapikik Lake with Clark's. Would of gone again this year but with the rate increase for everything was hard to justify flights, rental car, hotels ect...., We live in Burlington, so an easy 7 hour drive up to Cochrane. We know the fishing won't be as good, but its also nice to get away.Dan"
6663392,phishfearme,2022-06-10 06:58:00,1242,"We've used Cochrane a number of times (Detour, Partridge and Kesagami Lakes) - they're a good operator and you should have no issues with their services. if you've not been to the region where their lakes are you need to recognize that the lakes are in the James Bay lowlands and not in the Canadian Schield (like Kapikik). These lowlands lakes are characterized by flat, shallow and featureless bottoms. The fish are there but ""they are wherever they are"" - there's just not much structure for them to associate with. as a result, your tactics need to be different than ""fish structure"" - but if you do find some structure - especially rock piles and weeds - then focus on them. otherwise, we've found the best bet is to troll around and find fish - and don't be surprised if you return to the same spot the next day to find there's no one home. best of luck and hope this helps. phsih"
6687620,Samsdad,2022-09-22 18:46:00,3,I'm curious to how your trip to Snare lake went. I flew with Air Cochrane into Two Peak twice and into Tomorrow lake this year. Incredible walleye fishing..
6708267,Moosebunk,2023-01-20 19:07:00,211,"Snare was the first fly-in I ever took. Curious how ya did? For us, it wasn't all that sh!t hot but I still had a good time."
6709397,fooch1199,2023-01-25 15:20:00,10,"Hey Moosebunk, Yeah Snare was not that great for us either. Between four of us we might of caught 100 fish in four days. We all like to fish but we like the experience of being away. So we didn't fish as much as others might, but still put in a fair amount of time. I did catch a 39"" pike on springer lake which for me was a PB. The Water levels were pretty low, not sure if that had anything to do with it. We did have enough to eat every day and still had a good time but had many issues with the outfitter's service and charges. Just was an easy trip for us to drive to. We were spoiled the previous two years being on Kapikik Lake with Clarks."
6709451,Larry S,2023-01-25 18:38:00,665,"fooch1199 As phishfearme said the lakes, Snare is one of them in the James bay Area are flat and mostly featureless. When you went the year before to Kapikik with Clarks you experienced the Canadian Shield .Don't mess around in the James Bay Area again. Talk to Clarks and re-book one of their lakes. I am returning in early June to Okanse lake with Clarks also in August to Una lake and Will catch Hundreds of Walleye & Northern pike Get Wayne a Call at Clarks and Book a lake for the Upcoming Year Larry Schroeder"
6709453,prov1800,2023-01-25 19:01:00,5010,Totally agree.100%.All there lakes are full off fish.Now they have Latreille Lake Lodge to offering the American plan and there 2 drive inns are no slouches either.
6709455,fooch1199,2023-01-25 19:08:00,10,"Hey Larry, Like I said was an easy trip for us to drive to Cochrane. We have been to a bunch of places close to us (southern Ontario). A place like Clark's would of never been available to us, but during covid they were very accommodating to Canadians as their clients are 98% Americans. We were one of the few that flew into there camps the previous two years. We were the first group to go to Kapikik in 2020 and that was first week of August. Prices for us to go there now is not unaffordable but hard to tell the wife what it costs for a week vacation."
6709463,Eckohlt,2023-01-25 19:33:00,3685,"I can tell her for ya,if it's hard for you to say,it's cheap entertainment."
6709465,Eckohlt,2023-01-25 19:35:00,3685,"Mattress Mack just lost 2 million dollars on a football game,now how would like to tell the wife that.lol"
