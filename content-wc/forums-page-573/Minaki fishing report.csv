1111715,DonC,2009-06-07 15:07:00,93,"We returned yesterday. The weather was not pleasant. Cold, windy and rainy much of the time. I caught 6 smallmouth 18+ inches and many 17 inchers. Total numbers were not there this year. No problem catching walleye. Largest I caught was 25 inches. Largest in the group was 27 inches. Not a good size year for trophy walleye, but many in the 16-21 inch size. Did not see many perch this year. Largest pike was 41 inches and largest muskie while fishing for pike was 47 inches. Hope everyone has better weather and has good fishing.

Don't get me wrong, as you know if you can catch the weather good this early the fishing can be outstanding. I know you like fishing for the smallies, the sweet spot for me has always been 40-50 days after ice-out on the big lake. Leaving June 26th for a week this year, can't wait. Are you going back up this year?"

1112105,DonC,2009-06-08 19:36:00,93,"Randy, Using sauger jigs we buy in TN, one was caught at the Dalles Rapids and the 41 inch pike at the Throat Rapids. Sauger jigs are 1-1/4 ounce jigs, that you can see in the pike's mouth. We hammer the walleye and sauger with them, fished with a minnow or soft plastic, letting the treble trailer hook trail free. I caught the 25 inch walleye and lost another about that size on one. The guides up there are incredulous that they work and out fish smaller jigs. Don"

He thinks we may live very close together but I don't know. I have been fishing Minaki for a number of years. Look forward to hearing from you.PCW"
