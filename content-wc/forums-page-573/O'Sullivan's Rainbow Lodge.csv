1112383,Mr Ranger,2009-06-09 17:52:00,272,"I talked to Bob last week. Has been cold, fishing is great but he grumbled that it was snowing for the past hour and a half. I would grumbel too. Our group is up the week of June 20 and look forward to another great year. You just never know what weather you are going to get on the great OS. Take care"
1112412,Burdman,2009-06-09 19:16:00,11,Will be there 11 July good luck and let me know how you do.
1112747,Mr Ranger,2009-06-10 19:44:00,272,"Will do Burdman, looks like OS is getting lots of rain this week. Sure every bug in Canada will be alive by June 20th. July 11, think that is about the time Big Fish Bill will be up with his bunch of rancheros from Cedar Rapids Iowa. If you run into him say hello. He actually has written a great book about his dad's travels to Canada back when it used to be an adventure. Not only can he catch fish he tells some darn good stories. Best part is most of them are true Enjoy the planning for your trip."
