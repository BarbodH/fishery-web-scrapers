1112134,2746,2009-06-08 21:08:00,3206,"We have stayed at Rendezvous La Place. It's clean with a nice returante and sits right on the lake. Not sure it fits your ""reasonable"" definition. Recall it being in the $100 range for 2 people."
1112161,joeman79,2009-06-08 23:26:00,417,"That's where we are staying too, on the referral of a good friend who has stayed there in the past. $105.00 for room for two."
1112179,Glenman12,2009-06-09 05:45:00,762,"In the past we have stayed at the Red Dog Inn (I believe its now called the Adventure Inn or something like that), the Super 8 next door and the Emo Inn..dont recall the prices exactly but they were reasonable..you cant get dinner at the Super 8 as you can at the others but it does have a nice continental breakfast..I would recommend any of the 3"
1112201,Jig Man,2009-06-09 07:25:00,95,This year we are staying at Rendezvous La Place $105/night. Rendezvous La Place has a nice restaurant and bar in house. Last year we stayed at Super 8. It is about $15 cheaper but the only Food within walking distance is Adventure Inn (the name speakes for itself). If sleep is your only concern: Super 8 If you want to relax in a more comortable enviroment: Rendezvous La Place
1112203,reelxtc,2009-06-09 07:31:00,173,"Hi, Last year we stayed at Rendezvous La Place. Great restaurant and a nice view. I would recommend it."
1112204,GNO,2009-06-09 07:31:00,153,"In Fort I would go with the Super 8. Pesronally I would make the 20 minute drive to Emo and stay at the Emo Inn. Rooms are reasonably priced, decent restraunt, and a sports bar in case you want a few drinks. Alot quiter than Fort Frances and if you have a boat, it would be safer as it right across from the OPP station."
1112212,Mohleye,2009-06-09 08:10:00,368,GNO is right on the money. There is an LCBO next door also. We've stayed there several times and been very satisfied. Also stayed at the Rendezvous and recommend it as well.
