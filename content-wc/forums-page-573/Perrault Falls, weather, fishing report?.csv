1112637,team walleye,2009-06-10 12:38:00,336,The weather looks like it might be pretty good. I hope the fishing is the same. Anyone been on Perrault yet this year?
1112673,JayM5209,2009-06-10 15:20:00,1050,"Not Perrault, but May 23-30 we fished Jackfish, Pickerel, Caribou, Cliff, and Aerobus. Had enough eyes for dinner each evening and a few to bring home, but it was hard work!! But then, we never saw surface water temps above 47 degrees F.!"
1112690,team walleye,2009-06-10 16:21:00,336,"Yeah, late may would be a little tougher since water temps are down so much still."
1113059,mpschweiger,2009-06-11 21:01:00,3,"We fished Perrault Lake from 29 May thru the following Friday first week in June. There were still a lot of eyes in the Ord River. We had decent luck each day. Weather was pretty brutal. Coldest I've experienced. We had our limit in three days. The issue was (not that it's bad) was we kept catching 20 plus inchers. My brother in law caught a really nice 28"" near Cedar Lake by the burned out bridge. My brother couldn't seem to catch anything small enough to keep. My group never keeps anything considered trophy size. We also caught a bunch of 12 to 14 inchers. The lake even when we left was still 49 degrees. We also had some really nice eyes on the main lake, and east bay. Buddy caught a 22 incher while bobber fishing for northern in East bay by Spadina. We caught more small mouths last week than the other 4 years combined. Some real toads. All while fishing for eyes. I'm sure there all out of the rivers now and in the main lake on their normal post spawn places. Good luck we had a great time. Mike and Chris at Rocky Shore Lodge are great, and I couldn't recommend them any higher. Northern bite was great as usual also. Biggest ones caught right off the dock at the lodge. Hope this helps. I hear some locals call Perrault the dead sea I hope they don't realize their wrong. This place is getting better and better every year. Let's hope Global warming continues (hahahaha)!!!"
