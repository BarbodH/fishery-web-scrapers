1112407,Steve of Madison,2009-06-09 19:05:00,230,"Crawlers, minnows, leeches on spinners, jigs/same, sometimes gulp, plain plastic grup tails, worms, and my personal favorite the Woolyhogtail."
1112409,BenBeattie,2009-06-09 19:12:00,232,"Crawlers only? Spinner behind a bouncer. Minnows - jig, spinner, rig - in that order. Late july you should be targeting the 20-40' depth range. PM me if you have any more specific questions. I'd be happy to help you out."
1112596,jswinter40,2009-06-10 10:30:00,127,"Half Crawler on a chartruese, chartruese/green, chartruese/orange jig works great for us. I have most experience in early July and we fish in 18-30 FOW mostly. otherwise jig and minnow. or pull spinners and crawler/minnow/leech."
