I would either get this cleared up or be prepared for him to be turned back at the border and have a ride back home so the rest of you can go on with your trip. From my understanding Canada is a no non-sense country and will not hesitate to turn him away without proper papers and documentation. Since you know about this a head of time be prepared so the trip isn't spoiled for everyone else."

Pick up the phone and start calling The other thing I'd do is to mail it with delivery confirmation. That way your friend can say that someone signed for it on a certain date."
