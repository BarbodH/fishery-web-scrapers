1111827,Skywagon,2009-06-08 06:02:00,1106,"Looks like you have already about exhausted your options. There is a motel south of town on the west side of the road that has food, it is OK, but nothing special. NW Ontario has great scenery, good fishing and few people (all good things), but the lack of people, cause the lack of eating places. One of the few sacrafices of living here. Buy some steaks and grill out."
1111860,rockape,2009-06-08 07:53:00,215,"Go eat at Moosehorn Lodge if you want really good food in Sioux Lookout. It is not cheap, but it is GREAT food. I think the chef's name is Greg. Really cool guy too. You don't have to be staying there to eat there."
1111873,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-06-08 08:24:00,138,I second Rockape. Moosehorn has the best food in Sioux Lookout. It is a limited buffet. I would call ahead to make sure they have room and let Greg know how much to cook.
1111977,jswinter40,2009-06-08 12:27:00,127,"Thanks for the Moosehorn recommendation, didn't know that. I will make sure to mention it to our party. The Forest INN as you come into SL is OK at best and I grew up on a farm in WI. The beer is the safest meal you'll get in SL if you ask me. The pizza at the ""airplane"" place (dick and nellies i think) is pretty good though. ANyone eat at the Subway there, it looks too Shady for me. A lawn mower and weed wacker would make the whole town look a lot better!"
1112046,Guest,2009-06-08 16:01:00,0,I like Foxy's at Anderson's Lodge. They have a great fixed price 4 course meal every evening.
1112205,muskiemamma,2009-06-09 07:32:00,6,"Thanks for the great comments on Moosehorn. We strive to have great meals at the lodge. The prices might seem alittle high but you get a fresh salada bar , a delioucious home made soup, an executive cut of meat, and to top it off a gourmet desert. Everything is included in one price.Hope to have you guys come and check us out if you are in Sioux Lookout."

1112527,rockape,2009-06-10 07:29:00,215,Hey muskiemamma (Linda!)! See you next week! Save some big fish in Lac Seul for me!
