The fishing was the worst for us in 15 years (even worse that last year).The Walleyes spawned late and the weather was miserable(snow sleet & high wind) just about every day. And the females were just starting to feed post spawn. We did catch fish.. just not in quantity, the size was great 21-26"" walleyes every day, but few 16-18"" eat or take home fish were hard to come by.The walleye were starting to become active in McKenzie Bay, Broad Lake and Sunshine Lake as the walleyes were coming out of the post spawnagressively on Thursday June 4. These two areas were the most commonly fished areas by the boats in our lodge. The small mouth basswere a aggressive and a bout from our lodge went down to BRay Lake and really did well there for small mouth's.SouthBay the walleye are about 5-7 day later in the spawn period that the lakes mentioned above, and the Main lake watere temp had jsut reach spawning temp early that week.. therefore these fish will be post spawn until about June17-19 For our group (some 20+ vets and many 15 yr vets) we thought it was poor year, we usually on average catch 30-50 fish per person a day.This year 12-15 walleyes a day per person was a good day.But, again like mentioned on Thurday june 4 , we did start catching more fish the boat I was part of (3 men) we did catch about 120+ walleyes.Water temps: small lakes 54-57 F South bay 48-52 F Main Lake 46-48 FFish were typically in 6-9' of water.If any one is head north fishing I hope this info helps.Good Luck!!!!I have read many of the border crossing letters, and we had a very easy time crossing... and we take a 43' bus across with 12 people on board.I suggest "" be prepared when you cross"" have your passports ready and ready to hand to the agent.... know your alcohol and tobacco amounts and don't try and lie ... be honest! The worst thing would be ruin your trip for a few beers or a box of worms or leeches."
