All we need is fishermen to fill our resorts so if you haven't made plans yet there are many openings everywhere. Last minute bookings are always appreciated - who knows, you may even get a deal! See you on the water!"

1112864,youngcanadianguide,2009-06-11 08:33:00,60,Hey campchick It's good to know that there are still some people Advertising for Canada in a whole not just for their indivual camp or lake. Keep the reports going for your area becuase I think the guys like this. I don't know why the monitors allow other people to advertise for there own camp for personal gain. I think it takes the integrity out of the report becuase you don't know if the report is given for the fun of it or for personal gain. Remember if you can't come this year make reservations for next year becuase the fish will be even bigger. -Youngcanadianguide Three forths of the Earths surface is water and one fourth is land so it is quite clear that the good lord intended us to spend triple the amount of time fishing as taking care of the lawn.-Chuck Clark

We can't read every post and your help is appreciated. Hit the alert button and an email goes to all of the moderators. We will take a look at it and discuss whether it is breaking the rules. If it is, then it goes. If it isn't, then it stays.There are rules that allow some links to stay, so just because there is a link to a resort or something in a post doesn't neccessarily mean they are breaking the rules.So, if something looks like clear as day advertising, like mentioning a resort website in a fishing report, then please let us know about it. That is considered advertising.Thanks,Juls"
