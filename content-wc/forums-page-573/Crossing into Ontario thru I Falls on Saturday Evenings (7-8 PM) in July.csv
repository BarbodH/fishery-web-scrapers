1109136,thesenuts,2009-05-29 11:33:00,6,Anyone have suggestions on how long the wait is for crossing into Ontario on a Saturday Evening in July? I have always driven up on Friday and crossed at 7-8 PM and never waiting longer than 20 minutes. Something tells me the wait could be a lot longer on Saturdays.
