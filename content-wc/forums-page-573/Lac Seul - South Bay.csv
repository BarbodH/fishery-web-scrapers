1112606,Steve of Madison,2009-06-10 10:55:00,230,"South islet is good during the entire year, it is much bigger and deeper than you might think, just looking at the map. I have found some spots to 50+ feet. The South Bay area also has some very nice fish holding areas, around the islands, mid basin humps, mud flats, rocky points, and sand bars."
1112610,WalleyeWally28,2009-06-10 11:03:00,298,"Thanks Steve,That's what I was wondering. Have you fished LS yet this year or have a trip planned for later."
1112772,Steve of Madison,2009-06-10 21:55:00,230,"Heading to Onaway on July 17, packed and ready to go. Earlier tonight I was playing around on Google Earth and you can get some terrific views of LS. There must have been some recent flyovers and the pictures are really neat. Check it out."
1112805,WalleyeWally28,2009-06-11 05:48:00,298,"Steve,Thanks for the info. I'll post a report on July 12th or 13th when I get back."
1111620,WalleyeWally28,2009-06-07 09:03:00,298,"Over the past 12 years we have covered a lot of the NW and SW areas of Lac Seul from Ear Falls down into the main basin, but have never explored South Bay or South Inlet. Is anyone willing to share information on these areas for Walleyes? Thanks"
1111650,LoDo,2009-06-07 10:23:00,721,"We are headed to Lac Seul June 20 - 27. We are staying at Fishermans Cove in Scout Bay and plan to fish in and around South Bay and South Bay Inlet. We tend to go E and fish at/around the Ghost Narrows, Cormorant Islands and Manitou Creek for walleyes. There are plenty of bays around this area for Northern too.What is the rule with the green and red markers? Left of green and right of red??Thanks,"
1111654,T-MacMN,2009-06-07 10:34:00,8,The rule for bouys is simple - just remember the 3 R's. Red on your Right when returning upstream....
1111671,WalleyeWally28,2009-06-07 11:32:00,298,"LoDo,We'll be fishing Lac Seul July 4-11. How about a South Bay report when you get back?"
1111717,LoDo,2009-06-07 15:17:00,721,"Thanks for the tip on the bouys! 3Rs is simple enough. Thanks!I'll be sure to post a report when I get back. I can hardly wait to get out of the city away from the office, phones, traffic, etc....LoDoDenver, CO"
1111742,Steve of Madison,2009-06-07 17:55:00,230,"South Inlet is one of my favorite spots, it is a place with lots of points, sharp drops, weeds and wonderful smaller spots that hold fish all year and you can get out of the wind. I have names for all of my spots but they wouldn't do you any good because I named them, they won't be on any map (Steve's island, Honey hole, grassy knoll, you get the idea) Early in the year the lake located up the river about a half mile south of the narrows on the west side can be good. It has very stained water, dark bottom, weeds, and current, water warms faster. We found them in there last year when the main lake was very slow. In fact we spent almost all week in there. When the rest of the Inlet warms, just look for points, weed lines, etc. The waterfall located all the way at the south end is something to see, then work your way back up. Because I stay at Onaway in Scout bay I have a couple of go-to spots close to camp that we like to slip bobber for the couple of hours just before dark. Look for weed lines and soft bottom points with weeds. Slip bobbering in 3-5' of water can be alot of fun.Have fun"
1111762,WalleyeWally28,2009-06-07 19:00:00,298,Thanks Steve. I really appreciate the info. We like to explore new areas so we will give it a shot. I have heard about the waterfall and always wondered exactly where it was. Thanks again.
1111773,LoDo,2009-06-07 19:44:00,721,"Thanks Steve,You are talking about the Hungry Narrows right? Is the lake you are talking about not named on the map? If so, it looks like the entry to the lake is awfully narrow. Is this the lake you speak of?How much further past the lake is the waterfall? Is it easy to find?Thanks again,LoDo"
1111909,Steve of Madison,2009-06-08 09:49:00,230,"The Lake is not named on any of my maps, and the opening is about 30' wide and the channel runs 10'-15' deep, not something you can blast up but a no wake run is easy with some easy turns around the corners. The river also has some wider spots that we fish.The waterfall is on the far south end of South Inlet (not the un-named lake) the river that feeds it comes out of Glider lake and another small lake."
1112551,WalleyeWally28,2009-06-10 08:16:00,298,"Steve,We'll be fishing LS July 4-11 and again Aug. 8-15. Would the South Inlet area be good during those times or would it be too late?"
