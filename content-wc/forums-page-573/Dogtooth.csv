1111067,Racedrvr,2009-06-05 06:20:00,12,I am headed up to Rushing River Provincial Park to camp and fish. I am not very familiar with Dogtooth Lake and I am looking for pointers as to where/how to fish this very clear lake. I will be there next week and expect the water to still be quite cold. Anyone have experience on this body of water that can lend some advice?

I would focus on kilvert lake connected to dogtooth for the big ones. You have to go thru a small creek to get there, but it is well worth the work if the water level is high enough. During low water times, it can be hazardous or nearly impossible to get thru. Northern in south part of dogtooth. Small mouth, where eles but around west side of ""bass"" island."

1113092,Bigfishhunter,2009-06-12 06:52:00,803,Wasn't there like a 4 page report on this lake earlier in the year? I think if you search it you will find a tonne of info that has been covered that might help you out. Is this your first time there? Are you specifically targeting eyes? Good luck
