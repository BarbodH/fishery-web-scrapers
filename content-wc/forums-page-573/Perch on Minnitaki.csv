1112433,wildnorthern,2009-06-09 20:49:00,205,Anyone willing to share perch fishing info with me? We are going up this friday and will be fishing this weekend into next week. Wondering where and how to fish for some perch? Feel free to pm if you do not want to post. Perch fishing will give us something to do besides just fishing for walleye. Thanks for any help you give.

1113001,Red Pine J,2009-06-11 16:05:00,44,.be to try & find some weeds near a shore line or in the back of some bays....& try there..... worms would be my bait of choice..... I'd also suggest you try for smallmouth......if you tire of walleye fishin

We caught a lot of nice trout while jigging for wallleye last week. (not on Minnitaki). I would try trout or smallies and forget about the perch."
