1111018,Guest,2009-06-04 19:08:00,0,"Just returned from a week's fishing on Lac Seul. For walleye, I discovered that 8# mono was outfishing 8# flourocarbon by a good measure when using 1/4 oz jigs and minnows. It is my theory that the lack of floatation in the flouro meant that the jigs stayed closer to the bottom and snagged up in the rocks more thn mono whereas mono provided for more attractive jigging when cast out and brought back to the boat using a subtle lift and fall pattern. Just my 2 cents for early season walleye on Lac Seul when casting shallows. Fishing was tough but many fish were slot or over slot as compared to fishing a week or two later in the season. We had 3-4 Masters and many over 25 ""."
1111120,eyefanatic,2009-06-05 08:42:00,25,newt what section of the lake did you fish? Anyone else have insight on the fishing last week?
1112603,micropterus,2009-06-10 10:44:00,450,10 or 20lb braid. Uni/Uni to fluorocarbon. Currently using Power Pro and PLine.
1112828,Guest,2009-06-11 07:08:00,0,Anyone have any suggestions for spooling a couple of kids reels (ages 8 and 11) for Canada fishing?
1112832,NemegosendaRiver,2009-06-11 07:12:00,66,Trilene XL - I am assuming UL reels so 4 lb test would be the biggest I would put on.
1107221,cast_and_blast,2009-05-22 11:28:00,1098,Spiderwire Stealth with flouro leaders as applicable. Many times the leader isn't even necessary. Scott
1107480,Big lake,2009-05-23 13:03:00,1,I tried power pro microfilamet line it is 30lb test but the diameter of 8lb test this year dont need a leader for walleye or pike. had no problems with it.
1107571,Guest,2009-05-24 04:05:00,0,Can braided fishing line be used on aftco hd roller guides? and whats the difference between a igfa rod and a non igfa rod?
1107590,elmo,2009-05-24 06:53:00,43,"I use 10# Fireline for my wife and I. The wife pulled in a 16# pike in with Fireline no leader. Easy to cast hard to break off in the rocks or logs if hung up, get a hefty to stick and put it in the bottom of the boat so you can wrap the line around it to break the line off. 10# line very strong. Using the same line in Canada and here in the states since 2000. 2 years ago I had to spool it from one reel to another reel. Now it is like I have new line with all the old line at the bottom of the spool. After this year I will need to re spool with new line due to the fact I have gone from about 125 yards to about 100 yards on my reels due to break offs and tying plugs on. So at this time I do not plan on a move back to mono. I'm sold on Fireline"
1107707,StCroixfishingMN7,2009-05-24 15:51:00,35,"elmo, i dont know why but i did not like the fireline and i used it for one year. i was using the crystal and it was super coily. and seemed like the fish could tell what line you had on and opted to not take the hook. what type of fireline are you using?"
1108201,Guest,2009-05-26 13:00:00,0,"I switched to Berkley flourocarbon a couple of years ago, and I really like it. It is very expensive, but fishes like mono, but it doesn't have the stretch of mono. It is very strong. A couple of weeks ago I caught a lake sturgeon on it that weighed at least 45 lbs. (using 8 lb. flourocarbon) . . . the fish jumped completely out of the water twice and the line didn't break. I like it for jigging and live bait rigging. It also handles abrasion much better than mono. I use fireline when trolling, but didn't like fireline jigging. I sometimes wonder if I should use something trolling with a little more stretch . . . but it lasts like iron. I used the colored Transition in the past, and when I re-spool, I am going to go back to that. The clear flourocarbon is very hard to see (good for fishing, but bad for the fisherman)."
1108830,elmo,2009-05-28 14:34:00,43,"I used the black line, and the color will fade after a lot of use. But I have not had any bad luck other than trying to brake off. It will cut your hands or fingers if you grab and try to break it with bare hands. I like the way it casts plugs they seem to run a little deeper due to line size. Good luck"
1108866,back357,2009-05-28 16:46:00,106,Berkely 6lb floro on a light rod and 8lb floro on a medium rod. Haven't had one issue with either. Just make sure to clip off a bit every now and then just in case it has been compromised.

XL.One baitcaster used for trolling with 10 lb. Quattro Pro.This combo has served all my needs for shield lake fishing, focusing on the 'eyes but including lakers and perch. The only time I use a leader (steel) is when intentionally targeting northerns - about once every 8-10 years.With apologies to the devotees of fluorocarbon, I don't understand the hype. Tried using it for leaders and the nuisance of tying on the leader, making sure the fluoro doesn't cut itself in the knot, etc., is not worth any perceived benefits. Again, in my experience, fluoro didn't increase my catch rate. As the years pass, my increasingly frequent mantra muttered to myself is....K.I.S.S."
1106349,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-05-19 19:12:00,138,I'm trying to decide which line to re-spool with. What does everyone use both spinning and casting? How about leaders?
1106404,Steve of Madison,2009-05-19 21:57:00,230,"I am a big fan of 10 to 14# XT. If I get hung up I want to roll that rock over. But have spooled 12# Suffix, and also some #10 Trilene Flouro just for fun."

1106458,rockape,2009-05-20 07:45:00,215,8lb Trilene Sensation for jigging and some casting. No leader. Used it for years and never failed unless a big pike nails it. I started using Fireline Crystal 14lb for casting small to medium cranks with an 80lb flouro leader. I catch both walleyes and pike (a 40 incher on it last year) on it. Glad I have the leader on there. Had to replace it after a few days with some pike hacking it up pretty good.
1106575,StCroixfishingMN7,2009-05-20 13:59:00,35,I really like to use Stren Superbraid. very durable and doesnt seem to break. normally 10-12 lb. test line with a medium light action pole. works very well for the walleyes. both with jigs and hooks.
1106643,new hips,2009-05-20 16:47:00,498,"I have been using Fireline for the past few years, it is the most sensitive line, with a good rod you can feel every little rock easily. 4-6 lb for walleye and 8-10 for Northern, usually no leader. This year trying Florocarbon leaders for Northern. Downside to Fireline is that it's hard to break if stuck. No line twist -little line resistence and no stretch to it. I also use Power Pro in various test. Lasts forever, no breakdown."

I have a wife and two kids in the boat and it sure helps me to see their lines when they snag in the rocks. It's expensive, but I won't go to Canada without it. I've used yellow power pro too. Also a good line."
