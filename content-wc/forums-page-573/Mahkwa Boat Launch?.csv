1110560,CH47,2009-06-03 09:06:00,29,Has anyone driven into Mahkwa over the new bridge and launched their boat from the camp yet? Just curious as to the ramp conditions. Thanks CH47
1110591,JDP,2009-06-03 10:47:00,1457,I drove in to Mahkwa on May 23 and out on May 30. The bridge over Vaughn Channel is solid and constructed in the same manner as other bridges on the route to Mahkwa. The boat ramp is extremely well built with a rock bed in the lake. The only possible difficulty you may incur with the launch is pushing your trailer into the water against the rock bed. JDP
1110598,J.Iverson,2009-06-03 11:07:00,64,Was there any parking issues? Were you able to park next to the cabins? This is going to be soo much nicer than doing Archies Landing.
1110611,CH47,2009-06-03 11:36:00,29,"JDP, Thanks for the info. We have one trailer in our group that is a little low but we should still be OK. How was the fishing on your trip? Thanks again, CH47"
1110622,JDP,2009-06-03 12:11:00,1457,We parked vehicles near cabin. The trailers in the trailer parking lot (it's huge).If you have a spare tire on your trailer I would advise watching for clearance. Mine was very close to hitting the ground when taking the boat out of the lake. (Shorelander trailer)Fishing was very good - walleyes to 29 inches.
1110661,fire105,2009-06-03 14:15:00,40,is the road going to mahkwa built the same as if you were going to Archies landing? How long of a trip is off the main paved road?
1110758,JDP,2009-06-03 19:53:00,1457,"Yes the new road to Mahkwa Lodge is built the same as the road to Archies Landing. In fact, I would say it is a tad rougher. The new road/turn off to Mahkwa Lodge is well marked with signs including a large Mahkwa Lodge sign. There is about 21 miles of gravel road to travel after the turn off west of Hudson. JDP"
1110869,happy,2009-06-04 09:01:00,34,Fire 105 when are you going to Mahkwa? We will be there June 26 - July 3. We will be in cabins 6 - 7 - 8.
1111278,fire105,2009-06-05 16:21:00,40,"our group has descided to break going to Mahkwa this year and try Moosehorn. our time in camp is labor day week.The only problem i have going to Mahkwa is the gravel road,it knocks the **** out of my boats paint job."
1113248,schick,2009-06-12 20:52:00,35,"We fished out of Mahkwa May 25th to May 30th. The road is need of additional grading, but it is a lot more convenient than Archie's Landing. They will eventually pour concrete over the rock boat ramp, but it works fine as is. We were allowed to park next to the cabins, but when they get busier you will have to park up on top of the hill, but not far away. They installed a rock levy from Archies Landing to the island and therefore closing off the ability to go around that side of the island. This summer they are supposed to take out a section of the levy and install a bridge, so next year hopefully we can around that side of the island again. NEPiker"
