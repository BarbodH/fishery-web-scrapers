Finally made it out with a 2 hour window of opportunity before work. I thought you had to fish them at night but a buddy said they hit during the day at this time of year. He was not wrong, could not get a line down fast enough for the whole time I was there. I wanted to leave after an hour but it was so fun i stayed for 2. Lots of ice left so i think I will have to do that again before they finish their spawn and go when I have more time so I can chase lakers too.VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/wFdtoh60FnA"
