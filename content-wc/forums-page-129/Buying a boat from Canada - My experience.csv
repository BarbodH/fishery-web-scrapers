Cross into Canada and drive the boat back yourself. The Seller will not be allowed to cross into the US for the purpose of selling the boat and you'll have a hard time registering it. This way is pretty straight forward and assumes the buyer is the one crossing into the US with the boat. There is some basic paperwork for this. Its really not complicated at all. *Bill of Sale. My was typed up by myself as Canadians don't have a title. Break out the cost of the trailer on here.*EPA Form 3520-21. Just states the outboards meet the US EPA standards. Most all do nowadays.*DOT HS-7 Form. This is for the trailer.Pull up through customs and tell them what your doing. In and out shortly. You can call the US port side and talk to the customs agents if your concerned. They are short with you but will tell you if anything else is needed.Make sure to get the 7051 form stamped from them. You'll need this to title the boat.2. Pay a customs broker to fill out forms for you. Probably about 10 pages. This allows anyone to bring the boat into the US for you including the seller or a transport company.*Allow this process a minimum of 3 days as they need to get a power of attorney form filled out for you.*You'll need to call the port you are crossing and tell them roughly the day and time your crossing. Confirm with them your ACE manifest code is correct and will be allowed. You can use the Commercial lane to save time as well, but your broker will tell you all of this.*After that, to register and title the boat you'll need the bill of sale and 7051 form that customs stamps for you. All said and done, it wasn't that bad. I couldn't cross into Canada, so I had to use option 2. There is no tax for either party to bring the board through, as long as its made in America or Canada.I used Bay Brokerage as the customs broker. The Fee was 1/8th the amount other companies will quote you. $264 and they took care of everything and even contacted the port when they were questioning the boat crossing in."
