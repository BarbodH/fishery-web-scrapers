We always like to prepare and freeze some of our meals to use as ""Ice trays"" to keep other perishable food cold on the drive up to our outfitter.. Always make a big gallon bag of spaghetti meatball/sauce to freeze for a good hearty meal.. You can also make and freeze scrambled eggs ahead of time and any type of stew or chile ( I do venison or wild turkey chile).. Fish taco's are another favorite for our group and you can also use soft shell taco's to make breakfast burrito's..The pork tenderloins or boneless pork chops are another easy meal to take and we do ours on the BBG.. Bacon wrapped walleye's are another favorite on the BBQ and a different way for us to eat walleye's on our trip"

6309162,port1042,2019-04-09 05:44:00,509,"Last year for change of pace I brought along a couple of Smithfield Pork Tenderloins. They are pre-marinated in the package and freeze nicely. Just put them in the oven -- no other prep is needed. Very good, easy to cook, easy to pack, easy to freeze. They are available almost everywhere. Hormel makes a similar product but I haven't tried theirs."
6309172,olderfart,2019-04-09 06:52:00,18,"The precooked vacuum packed BBQ ribs, made by a variety of companys, also freeze well, take out of the package, heat and you're ready to go...add some good baked beans and it's time to eat!!!!"

6309788,TitanD,2019-04-10 15:23:00,43,"We really only do an evening meal and breakfast. We have changed it up over the years but generally looks something like this:Dinner:1.

Fish/Frozen French fries/vegetable-salad7. Burgers/Dogs/Fish/vegetable-saladBreakfast:1. French Toast/Patty Sausage (don't forget the cinnamon & vanilla- use Texas Toast)2. Bacon/Eggs/Toast3. Scramble (ham, peppers, onions, mushrooms, cheese)/Toast4. Pancakes/Bacon/Sausage5. Bacon/Eggs/Toast6. French Toast/Patty Sausage7. Omelet's (everything in - whatever you have left)Varies from year to year but this is fairly common. We are a little all over the place at times with guys coming and going for the evening meals but breakfast we usually coordinate pretty well!Good luck.Beteau lake 6/15-6/22"
6310698,Aspencreek,2019-04-12 20:53:00,2911,"Some of the meals we will prepare are hearty, and filling. Spaghetti with meatsauce, we will make what we think is plenty and it usually is gone, texas toast and a salad. Beef Stew, I will prepare everything (cut up) throw it in the pot and heat, serve with some beer bread that I make up there. Beer Bread is 3 cups self rising flour, 1/2 cup sugar and 1 beer, mix and place dough in disposable bread tin and bake at 350 until top is golden brown and knife comes out clean. Slow cooker pot roast or stove top, cubed beef , browned on stove add can of french onion soup, cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 can of water, heat through and serve over flat noodles. Of course we will have fish but not every nite. We also pack a gas grill and do hamburgers, brats and chicken breasts on buns for lunch."

6310726,tweedrules,2019-04-13 05:36:00,107,Thanks for the suggestions. All good stuff. Eatin' well this year!
6310732,ILScott,2019-04-13 05:52:00,139,"My group sets a meal plan about a month ahead of our trip. We then cook the meal at home and vacuum seal them for easy transportation and cooking. Who wants to cook in Canada. I usually smoke some pork chops, ribs, jambalaya, white chicken chili. We will grill steaks and burgers at camp when frying fish. My camp doesn't have a stove or electricity so everything is pretty much grilled."
6310760,camp chef,2019-04-13 07:42:00,915,"For french toast... I make the soak at home and freeze it ,,Eggs,milk,cinnamon and vanilla. Just enough for what I need"
