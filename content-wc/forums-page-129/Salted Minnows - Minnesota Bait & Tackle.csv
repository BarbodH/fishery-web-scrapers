6311712,The tank,2019-04-16 03:59:00,340,Put them in the refrigerator. I've got mine for opening week. They're good for 2-3 months in the fridge. Don't freeze them.
6311732,olderfart,2019-04-16 05:26:00,18,"Never had problems freezing them...in fact, took a package leftover from the prior year, kept frozen with no problems."
6311754,CI_Guy,2019-04-16 06:08:00,2118,+1. In my experience freezing them only makes them mushy.
6311880,The tank,2019-04-16 12:11:00,340,Us also. Mushy and don't stay on very well. It says on there web site don't freeze them. But first time I didn't listen got mushy.
6311882,olderfart,2019-04-16 12:47:00,18,"Just looked at their website and it says that they are frozen after processing...also, they are always frozen when I get them...we keep them frozen until we use them and never had them get mushy."
6312114,maddogg,2019-04-17 08:45:00,178,A friend of mine told me they had preserved minnows in a sealed bag and they made them throw them away( on the U.S. side) at the border. Did the rules change regarding minnows?
6312142,Golden Eagle,2019-04-17 10:42:00,2642,Might they have been smelt?
6312250,yoopertrout,2019-04-17 16:44:00,1172,"I used them once and was very happy. They mailed them in a well insulated container, timed the mailing so we got them when we needed them, and they worked great."
6312370,The tank,2019-04-18 07:14:00,340,I think this thing has gone in two different directions. Some are talking best bait and some are Minnesota bait and tackle. I've used them both one comes frozen one comes not froze.
6306934,BornToFish,2019-04-02 10:56:00,1224,"Greetings, I have fished lakes north and south of Lac Seul, but I have never fished Lac Seul. Thus, I don't know what the forage base might be. Although, I suspect shiners will be present. I'm confident that there are plenty of guys on this forum with experience on Lac Seul, such that they could provide some helpful insights as to the forage base. You might want to start a thread on the topic, as plenty of guys should chime in with their observations. You might want to go with a blend of large and medium size minnows if you can go that route. Remember that anglers are entitled to bring 10 dozen salted minnows (per angler) into Canada. This was strictly enforced a few years ago. It's been more relaxed at the border the last two years with respect to salted minnows. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6307208,stumcfar,2019-04-03 07:47:00,451,"I brought some frozen shiners with a few years ago to Lac Seul for the first time. I have never had luck on Lac Seul with artificial bait, have had some luck with leeches and crawlers, but our experience, hands down is that Lac Seul is a minnow lake. We were on a great bite and ran out of live bait. We pulled out the frozen shiners, which are not the ticket compared to salted as they tend to fall apart. The walleyes hit them as well as the live bait. Tried several different plastics and caught nothing. I am thinking from now on bringing salted shiners to have in a jam."
6307232,fishmanric,2019-04-03 08:57:00,219,We saw large schools of Emerald Shiners around the houseboat on Lac Seul two years ago. Fleet Farm sells Magic brand Emerald Shiners that worked well. Last year we did best with crawler chunks and leeches.
6307360,SimonHockey04,2019-04-03 13:51:00,25,How many pounds are 250 shiners? What size bag did you by from BestBait.com?
6307362,Jwendt15,2019-04-03 14:09:00,72,"I haven't ordered any yet personally, but they told me over the phone that a 2 pound order of mediums would get you somewhere between 250 - 300 minnows."
6307442,SimonHockey04,2019-04-03 19:48:00,25,"Thanks, that's a pretty good amount for the cost"
6307528,BornToFish,2019-04-04 05:47:00,1224,"Greetings, My regular source of emerald shiner minnows dried up on me. I will be sourcing my shiners this season from Best Bait on the strong recommendation from a good friend. I recently spoke with the owner of Best Bait in Marblehead, Ohio. He said that most anglers traveling to Canada purchase their large size salted shiners. He also said that there are about 80-100 large salted shiners to the pound. He said that they trap the bulk of their minnows for the season during April, which is when the size of the minnows is at maximum. Thus, anglers wanting larger emerald shiners would do well to order during April/May. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6307536,BornToFish,2019-04-04 06:11:00,1224,"Greetings, The chatter on this thread has references to frozen and salted emerald shiners. Some anglers might be trying one or the other for the first time. I have fished with both frozen and salted shiners. Both types of shiners work well, but it seems that each has its advantages and disadvantages.Frozen Advantage = They work well for walleyes. Disadvantage = Anglers need to keep them chilled throughout the entire day. They turn to mush when they get warm, such that they become nearly impossible to keep on the hook.Salted Advantage = They work well for walleyes. They are fairly insensitive to temperature. Disadvantages = The salt will let you know if you have a cut on your fingers. The salt will eventually transfer to your fishing equipment and may cause pitting on metallic surfaces of your fishing reel (e.g. on your spool). I keep a bailing bucket with water near me, such that I can periodically rinse my fingers to remove salt. I noticed that the junction between the minnow's (frozen and especially salted) head and body becomes a weak point. I have frequently felt a bite, and then set the hook, only to get the head of the minnow back on my jig. The walleye swam away with a free meal. This happens when the walleyes are tentative with their bite - just holding onto the tail of the minnow. I address this situation by making my own jigs with a Live Bait Jig mold and long shank hooks. The jigs feature a compact lead head with no lead shank/collar. I insert the hook though the eye of the minnow and then thread the body of the minnow onto the shank of the hook. This technique places the hook as far back in the minnow as possible. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6311660,Tailfin,2019-04-15 19:31:00,9,So when you get them do you just leave them in the bag or freeze them? 48 days till can use them.
6311710,The tank,2019-04-16 03:56:00,340,When we fish lac seul we do as good with worms as minnows but if your getting salted minnows get the biggest you can get. The large shiners from best baits would be better than the medium but I'm sure both will work.
6306406,Jwendt15,2019-04-01 07:24:00,72,"Anyone have experience using their salted minnows? Thinking about ordering a batch for our trip to Onaway this June. Looking online, they seem reasonably priced in comparison to the brands you can get at the big stores. Fortunately the lodge supplies minnows, just always nice to have a backup if we find a hole. Nothing worse than running out of bait when the walleye are still slamming a spot."
6306538,WiRiver,2019-04-01 12:51:00,13,We have used Best Bait.com they sell salted Lake Erie emerald shiners and they work well everyplace we have used them. Good price for quality bait
6306558,Joek3,2019-04-01 13:18:00,244,I have used them. Reasonable prices and quick shipment.
6306582,stjoeguy,2019-04-01 13:42:00,979,"I'm not a big fan of salted minnows but have used them from Minnesota Bait & Tackle and they were fine. Their Fish Lake Bait shop is in Harris, MN right off I-35, which is handy if you're heading up that way through MN."
6306598,Jwendt15,2019-04-01 14:28:00,72,"Thanks. I am assuming ""medium' size is typically the best for Ontario walleye? They say average for medium is 2-3""."
6306642,andreindy,2019-04-01 17:14:00,308,"I preface this by saying I am not a veteran Canadian fisherman. However, I am a fisherman that went on a fly-in last year to a location that was a first time for all of us. I had nightcrawlers, but no other live bait options. But I did not want to leave anything to chance so I picked up large salted shiners online from best bait.com. For $31 shipped to my door, I had over 250 3""+ shiners at my disposal. In my mind, it was a smaller price to pay to have shiners as opposed to wishing I had shiners. I separated them out and put 2 dozen per bag...making it easy to grab a bag from the stash for that day's fishing."
6306774,DavKin,2019-04-02 06:25:00,104,"We fish an outpost camp in late August and would not leave home without them. Full disclosure, we also bring leeches and crawlers. I buy XL fatheads for $13/lb. which = approx. 12 dozen. I plan one pound per guy. Just add pickling salt and freeze."
6306782,Bstar,2019-04-02 06:46:00,564,I ordered from Minnesota Bait and Tackle last year. Lets just say it was a bad experience. I just received a small order of the large Lake Erie shiners from bestbait.com just to see what they look like. Hands down they are the better option. Just my opinion. The picture is of their 1.5 oz bag. You can buy in bulk also.
6306862,BornToFish,2019-04-02 09:22:00,1224,"Greetings,I have been using salted minnows with considerable success for the last several years. I will be getting salted emerald shiners (large size, 2.75+ inches) for this season from Best Bait in Marblehead, Ohio.I believe that it is important to ""match the hatch"" when selecting salted minnows. Several years ago, I fished a lake that did not have shiner minnows in it, but rather various species of small minnows. I was able to use salted fathead minnows with considerable success on this lake. I then switched to a lake that had shiner minnows as its forage base. Salted fatheads were a very tough sell on this lake. I switched the next season to salted emerald shiners and did very well.I believe that its also important to use a size of minnow that resembles what is naturally in the lake at the time of the season when you will be there. I try to use large emerald shiners in the spring and autumn, when most of the minnows are full-size adults. I switch to medium size minnows in the summer when the young-of-the-year minnows haven't reached full size.I observed over the years that the walleye bite often collapses to minnows in August and September, at least on the lakes that we fish. This is the time of the year when salted shiners can really shine.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6306922,Jwendt15,2019-04-02 10:34:00,72,"BornToFish, thanks for the info. Ever have experience fishing Lac Seul? If so, curious as to what you used then. We are heading out for the first week in June this year. I was thinking medium sized, but not sure if shiners would be considered ""natural"" for that lake. 57 days and counting...."
