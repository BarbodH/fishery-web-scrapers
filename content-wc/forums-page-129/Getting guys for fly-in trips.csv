6281878,Aspencreek,2019-01-23 06:53:00,2911,"That is exactly what we do. The 1/2 deposit is due around Sept, you are NOT IN until your deposit is IN. The next $250 is due 1 month before we leave, again if no deposit you are not in, and all deposits are non-refundable. And we accept no excuses, unless you are seriously ill or have a spouse or child that are ill. Child birth is not a good enough reason, first, bad timing on your part, and you should have known about the impending birth by then. All deposits are held in trust by the trip treasurer and goes toward 1. the grocery list 2. fuel for vehicles to and from 3. bait purchased for the trip 4. payment to the camp. The camper will always have some additional to pay to the camp, and are also responsible for anything extra they may want to buy. All booze is done individually. My group is primarily a core 4, but when looking for an additional 2 we will spread the word, and it doesn't take long to find 2-4 prospectives. The deposits weed them out quick. Deposits are NON-Refundable, they go toward everyone else's expenses. One year we had $750 extra, that was nice! But if you make a deposit and then not go, you go to the bottom of the list of invitee's for future trips. If the excuse is good enough, the deposit is carried over to a future trip, but not refunded. This is explained to everyone, no exceptions!!! The only person it was excused for was my father, made the first deposit, then passed away 3 months later. He had a good excuse, but didn't want the deposit back so my grandson took his place."
6297838,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2019-03-09 21:36:00,240,"Hi--a little late on the draw here, it's been a while since I've logged in. I have a few thoughts on this topic. My first fly-in trip ever was to Larus Lake in 2001, and the same group of guys went for the next 15 years, like clockwork. Only thing was, I just turned 40 on that first trip, and was pretty much the youngest guy in the group. Slowly, due to health and family issues, 4 or 5 of the group stopped going, till I had to give up our coveted Memorial Day week trip to Larus. Nestor Falls Outposts was adamant about a minimum group size of 6. I was very, very bummed, as this lake is an absolute gem in turns of both numbers and size. Luckily, around 2015 or so, many outfitters began taking groups as small as 2. So, my brother and I started booking trips with outfitters like Mattice Lake Outfiitters, and enjoyed a hugely successful trip to Auger Lake in late May, although we just about froze to death that year. Showalter's was another outfitter who work with smaller groups. My every-other-year group of friends from high school and I also go to Clear Lake with Nestor Falls, as this lake only requires a group of 4. This year, my brother and I are flying in with Brace Lake Outfitters for a week, and there are scores of other outfits that are willing to host a group of 2 guys. I am sick to think I might not ever get back to Larus, but there are tons of other lakes out there. Watching the Ontario Experience on YouTube has given us ideas for trips we never would have considered on our own. Same with Mike Borger's trip reports. That is what sold me on Brace Lake. Next year, we are already committed to a trip with Wilderness North, another outfitter who will work with a group size of 2."
6298882,reconssd,2019-03-12 05:56:00,147,"What a great thread and the replies have been both informative and entertaining. For years, we had a core group of 4. One of the guys had said after one of our trips, ""We have to keep this going and never break up the group."" Well, he moved from Wisconsin to North Carolina. He was the first to leave the group and has never been back to Canada. One guy got married/divorced and is now looking at getting married again. He hasn't been on a trip in a long time. Our group of 4 is now down to 2. For the newbies, I've never understood the backing out after committing to a trip. My experience has been the guys that back out usually have never been to Canada. They don't know what they're missing because they think its like fishing in the lower 48. I also think the newbies get intimidated especially if they're going on a trip with people who know Canada like the back of their hand. Although trip cost can be an issue, it's usually a smoke screen. When you break out the cost in your group, its really not that expensive. That being said, we are heading to a brand new lake this year. Can't wait to get on the water in Ontario. There's something about being in a boat, casting, seeing the bald eagles, and saying ""get the net."" Safe travels and tight lines."
6298956,vteye3,2019-03-12 08:33:00,496,We evolved from a father an sons group to invite everyone and hope we have at least 4. This year June 2019 thought we had the place booked group of ten. Now down to 85 days and have 6 deposits. Yes everyone who sent in deposits Nov is still going and those that committed but did not send deposits have backed out. We have 2 groups my group and brothers group from a neighboring state. I get it Ontario is 22 hour drive from bros place. Its not easy 4 out of 6 work full time and retirees take an extra night to and from. Working full time group drive straight through sleep at Nakina an then fly in after 12 hour break. The fathers have either passed or reached late 80's.
6299024,bthomas3333,2019-03-12 10:51:00,465,"Things change. As a grade school kid I used to do canoe trips to Quetico and fish local lakes. As a teen I used to do two fly-ins with a friends group and my dads group. As a young adult I had to go down to one fly-in trip as I had the kids to think about, but that one trip was with 6-8 great guys. After doing that trip for years we kept losing guys as they passed away or aged out until I was down to just me and one other buddy.I had to decide what to do and since I loved fishing Canada I tried a couple of different options. I did a few trips alone. That is cool but not having a boat partner to talk to sort of sucked! The best option was to start making new connections. I became the 4th guy on a trip here or there. I filled in an 8th slot for another trip. What I am doing is rebuilding my fishing network so I have options to keep fishing. Honestly it has been a great experience. I know some guys are reluctant to join a new group, but if you are fishing Canada with a new group how bad can it be?If you want to fish and you lose your group or go down to a number too small to fish a given location use this site and others and join a group. The option is to fish or not to fish. I know which side I am taking.Brett"
6299044,jambi,2019-03-12 11:37:00,504,"In 2007 I was looking to start Fly-in trips and did a couple years with just me and a buddy. About 2009 I saw a guy posting lots of pictures on Showalter's facebook page so I messaged him about a lake I was going to try; that evening he sent me maps and a great report of his past experiences at that lake. The next year we joined groups and have done so ever since. Never having met, we hooked up at International Falls and the rest is history. He and his crew are in NW Indiana and we are in Oklahoma. Each year we will each have two to four guys so combined we'll have six to eight. We both are pretty good screeners when it comes to selecting guys we have always had good luck. We've all become great friends and look forward to our combined groups getting together every year."
6299064,KSjim,2019-03-12 12:30:00,88,That sounds similar to our experience. Our group had been reduced from six to two. Through business contacts we happened to run across another group that had been reduced to two and combined forces. Started in 2011 and for 2019 we will have our largest group to date of eight.
6299620,MrSimon,2019-03-14 06:30:00,922,"We've had 5 solid guys for years and years. This year two of them can't make it. We found replacements, but it wasn't easy. It's going to be such a different trip with a new mix of guys. It will still be a great trip, but I'm gonna miss those two. New guys in a group is great and ads a freshness ..... but old comfortable friends are great too."
6300532,Twins_dad,2019-03-16 05:40:00,38,"Yep our group has those same challenges. There are 4 of us out of the group of about 12 that are pretty consistently available. Our inaugural trip was 14 years ago and the group dynamics have changed. Some still work, some are retired, some now want to bring kids and grand kids, some want to get away from kids and grandkids (ME!). Somehow we still manage to put together our trips with 4, 8, or 12 people. But the planning and herding the cats can be nerve wracking. Bourbon helps. Enjoy your trip!"
6300602,andreindy,2019-03-16 08:55:00,308,"Reading these posts is interesting. Who doesn't enjoy a good ""origin"" story? My own origin story is recent, beginning with the summer of 2017. For several years I worked with a hard fishing Minnesota boy and he would share his annual Canada trip stories upon his return over a Rocky Rococo pizza. I was always transfixed. My entire life I wanted to do what he was doing. I just never, ever did. Work. Work. Prioritization issues. Work. Finally, he literally slapped my face with a slice of pepperoni and said ""You gotta go yourself, man. This upcoming year. Do it"". I responded several times with ""but this"" or ""but that""....He finally said (caps for his intended emphasis) ""MAKE IT HAPPEN. You work hard, you can afford it, you aren't getting younger and you will never, ever regret going but you will regret not ever going. MAKE IT HAPPEN"". He was right, and I did. My return to Walleye Central occurred after a 12 year hiatus. In 2017, my first group consisted of my father, brother, myself and my son. Last year, we added a brother-in-law and a 15 year old nephew (my 17 year old son could not come). This year we are father, brother, myself, BIL, nephew and my son. None of the group were previous, significant fisherman. In fact the first year, other than the two rods my brother brought, no one owned really any gear/rods/tackle of their own and they all used mine..that first year, this was part of ""making it happen"". Since then, things have changed. And now, the other adults too have little packages arriving at their homes throughout the year and workbenches for sorting their ""stuff"". Our anticipation for our upcoming July trip is enormous. Like, enormous enough that you need to discuss it in moderation or risk the scorn and eye rolling of wives and girlfriends. My group is very inexperienced and we flounder around. But that's OK. It has every other ingredient for how I would measure success. Someday, when I try to go to Canada TWICE a year, I will likely search on Walleye Central for a group that might have room for one more. Proof of success right now? When my father picked up my nephew yesterday from school and the nephew spontaneously says ""That trip last year was the BEST time of my entire life."" That makes you smile."
6300716,kona77,2019-03-16 14:50:00,236,AndreIndy- Great story.. I bet you thank your friend all the time for giving you that push to do a Canadian trip.
6300724,andreindy,2019-03-16 15:35:00,308,"Luckily, I still work with him and I still sincerely thank him. The poor guy recently missed two years himself with his own group (new twin girls). I am very fortunate to have had someone light the fire for me and to provide the wake-up call. You know who else is eternally grateful? My father. He says he cannot measure how meaningful the time is with us at this stage of his life."
6301016,Larry S,2019-03-17 10:58:00,665,"Went to Canada to a friends fishing camp above Kenora for 4o years . At same time went on fly-ins with friends I worked with and their sons Moved to Nevada in 1998 My best friend /fishing partner started having health problems and stopped going on fly-ins. In 2003 hooked up with a couple of guys from Michigan and started going with them until 2008 when various problems made me stop going with them. hooked up the following year with fishfearme from Pittsburgh and have been going with him and his group since 2009 In 2013 went to Italy with wife, my sister and friends on this trip I kept talking about fly-ins to my sister. later in the year my sister deceided to go in 2014 on a fly-in with me . She had such a great time she has been going with me ever since that trip. She has caught large pike ,tons of walleyes and a Green Bay packer sweatshirt in her past trips. We are going to North Caribou Lake again at end of June and first week in July we go for 10 day trips Larry S"
6301602,Moosebunk,2019-03-19 06:44:00,211,"An enjoyable morning coffee read this one is. What's really cool is learning how many southern anglers love to plan and return to Canada each year for the fishing. Getting these kinds of trips together takes some solid commitment and understanding from all involved. For a number of years I planned fly-in trips but stopped bothering for awhile because of some headaches and heartaches. This year luckily a group of six came together for a fly-in to Arctic Circle Lodge on Great Bear Lake and I feel it's going to go amazingly. Everyone I know personally but most don't know each other so we'll see how that goes, but it's a great mix of sensible adults. The last group fly-in I had planned to go on a few springs back, the guy who organized the trip and recruited two other strangers and myself, well he selfishly bailed on us all in order to head into the place at an earlier date. After his return he let me know the fishing there wasn't great but that the three of us who are still paid up to go should continue on there as planned. He in turn won't be returning with us now because ""there are infinite pike fisheries that are better,"" but oddly, he later still promoted the place online to other anglers. Egocentric much? The point of this story is, to anyone planning the trip and recruiting for it, the one person who should be most committed to everyone is that guy who organizes it. Others coming into their plan are putting their time and money into the leaders confidence and connection with the operator and destination. So, in my experience of taking the lead in organizing a trip and joining into a group, if you're taking the lead, don't screw over the group. Some many great points and shared experiences with fly-in trip planning expressed here in this thread. We could all certainly share more."
6302138,andreindy,2019-03-20 17:47:00,308,"I appreciate you sharing your insight. While I know that adults need to take responsibility for the risk they are personally willing to assume in participating in a trip, I also know that I have people who are placing their trust in me with their time, money and companionship. Everyone knows I am not responsible ultimately for their happiness or however they choose to define success, they are, but I need to own the responsibilities I told them I would own. Trust is an amazing thing (not surprising) and trust that someone is considerate of others interests and wellbeing in addition to their own applies not only to marriages, but fishing groups."
6309796,TitanD,2019-04-10 15:49:00,43,"We have a core group of 4 that make the trip almost every year without fail. We typically end up with 6-8 guys in total so we generally have a rotating 2-4 guys that come periodically. Have been pretty luck to keep our ""core 4"" together as long as we have. All are always welcome and it is rare that we have less than 6.I attribute that to my fabulous planning, scheduling, menus and just overall fun-loving personality!!!!!"
6299120,Pooch,2019-03-12 15:18:00,4618,"Groups evolve or as said before, we all will age out eventually. Meeting other groups that are shrinking and joining forces (if compatible) keep the trips going and mixes it up. Some really good friends have came from a new group I was invited to join. Then that group evolved into two groups and book together for the same dates, but keep the trip logistics separate. Anything over six sometimes gets harder to manage and keep everyone smiling. Plus, the larger the group the odds of someone needing to bail out also gets larger.We are all the same. Look at the group shots on the albums page. You could interchange any of those guys with our guys and everyone would fit right in. I've had new guys jump in my boat whom I've never met and by the end of the day we're almost brothers. Plus, I get to hear some new stories and replay some of my worn out one's.Pooch"
6299472,fishmanric,2019-03-13 15:38:00,219,One year my friend had twenty two guys lined up for a trip. When it was all said and done only three made it. He said he will never plan another trip. I'm lucky to have a wife that loves to fish and so we spend a lot of quality time together. She is a shore lunch fanatic. I have planned a number of trips through the years with family and friends that never ended up with what we started with. All worked out awesomely in there own way. After two years of Lac Seul houseboat trips my crew fell apart by way of weddings but I'm certain we will be back again. These trips are never worth giving up on.
6299526,Wrktfsh,2019-03-13 17:51:00,492,"Our fly ins to cedros isl MX are always full. It's handled like this, put a deposit down by x date. Non refundable ( you get someone to fill your place) . Balance due by x date ( again non refundable). We have solid core group with a few fill in over the years. If your not ponying up money your not considered, talk is cheap. It sucks to be hard core like that but it necessary to weed out the bs ers and it's easier on the chartermaster"
6280512,lionfan19,2019-01-19 14:08:00,41,So what was that guys excuse for backing out on you guys the day before?
6280882,3M TA3,2019-01-20 15:49:00,2846,"Well try this. Let's say the trip is 1000 each and requires a $500 deposit. Suggest to these other 8 maybe wanna goes that a $250 non refundable deposit is required (instead of the $500). This should immediately weed out those not really interested (Is $250 really that much a year in advance?). It also helps pay for the committed (in your case 2) so if the others bail, you've got help paying the full cost of four, maybe all of the cost even if only 2 of you go. Perhaps a lame idea, but I surely think something like this would automatically weed out those not really interested."

One of the guys outfitters will take 3 n we should have a 4th, but all my planning went out the window due to my dad n his Fred all of sudden in which is great to have them. This is a great site as I got a lot of feedback on options."

Never had a person back out after instituting the nonrefundable deposit policy, Then again, I don't fish with that group anymore......got tired of a lot of other BS from the group.....LOL. Now I strictly go on blind dates.... Never have had a bad experience fishing with new folks. Ya get out of it what you put into it. PjShorthorn"
6281084,Ogoki,2019-01-21 06:16:00,291,"Use to get trips together ,usually would go 6 guys. Never really had a problem of them paying deposit or backing out. Just got tired of working all the details out. Seemed like someone always complaining, because they didn't like when we were leaving or coming back. Or they wanted to stay over and not drive straight thru or visa vera. Didn't like what we had for food and they were in on the grocery buying . One older wealthy farmer ,who could not have went unless he went with a group of younger guys to help him, even complained to me that $40 was too much for his part of the grocery bill. Always issues to deal with. Too much like work. The two older guys are deceased . Some go on canoe trips ,occasionally. Some quit because it was too expensive ,etc etc. For at least the last 15 years, just my wife and I go. SO MUCH BETTER. Did take another couple with us once . Never again . We like sleeping ,eating ,fishing when we want to . Prime fishing for us is in the evenings . Like to fish late ,back to cabin for a snack, sleep in . Their clocks were just the opposite. Wife is retiring from teaching this spring , so if we have any money left after buying health insurance, plan to visit Ontario fly in fishing trips and head hunting trip."

6281124,Mojo-NC,2019-01-21 08:10:00,1929,"I think our system has been working well so far because we coordinate the timing and discuss reservations before we book our hotels/flights/car rental. I do most of the logistical planning, another guy puts together a daily menu, and another guy develops a grocery list for that menu. We all review their work and add suggestions. Since we fly up every year, we always start at zero and share the costs evenly. One guy has an Excel program that allows us to submit all receipts to him and he enters the costs including who shares that particular expense. At the end of the week the program calculates who owes whom what. It's very cool. If we have a larger group, our core group makes the decisions and if the other guys want to join us they can, but if they make any changes it's on them to coordinate those changes themselves. We have on occasion flown into different airports, but we plan to meet up however it works out. It's a lot easier now that our phones have improved considerably over the years allowing better communication. Guys are a lot more committed and reliable once airline reservations are made and when they have submitted a non-refundable deposit in November."

6279226,Mojo-NC,2019-01-15 08:53:00,1929,"My brother and I used to go up to north-central WI every year for an annual walleye/musky fishing trip. Although the musky fishing was generally pretty good, the walleye fishing was always mediocre at best. We caught way more walleyes at home on the Mississippi River than we ever did in WI, but I enjoyed lake fishing so much more than river fishing. My dream was to go to Canada but back then my funds were extremely limited. Fast forward 30 years to 2004 - I finally talked a couple of my buddies into a trip to Canada. Before we left, neither of these guys had ever even heard of a walleye, musky, or pike, yet caught one. We had such a good time we've gone back regularly ever since then and our group has grown on several years to as many as 14. We have our core group, and the others join us on the years they can. We've only done drive-to or boat-to camps. This year will be our first fly-in trip, so 4 of us will evaluate whether it is something we want to repeat or consider doing again with a larger group. We haven't had that much trouble getting guys to go; they would hear us talk about our experiences and they would generally ask us if they could join us on our next trip. Once they experienced it, they got hooked too. Granted most of us are older (50's and 60's) and can afford it, and the only young guys have always been one of our sons where we pay for their trip. I can see where it might be difficult to get a younger guy with limited funds and vacation time to commit to a fly-in trip unless they are die hards like most of us on this site."
6279272,Golden Eagle,2019-01-15 09:42:00,2642,"Fourteen months ago I was expecting to have a party of 4, to fish the walleye opener. New guys got in touch about fishing the May 19 week with me at Little Vermilion Lake. I requested deposits by early January. To my surprise, I received all deposits by mid January and our party had grown to 16. Two of us flew to camp 2 days prior to the opener and fished for pike. I met 11 people I had never known before, when they arrived late on Friday, a day before the opener. Fishing was okay, but the worst ever opener for me, due to low water level. All others seemed to be satisfied. My streak of fishing openers on the same water began in 1984, missing only 2017 when my wife's health issues kept me in Tennessee. Size of party has been between 2 fishermen and 30. Length of stay has been 1 week a few times, 9 days a bunch of times and 3 weeks 1 time. Meatloaf thought 2 out of 3 was good. I think 34 out of 35 is great. Back around 2000 I didn't have plans for the opener. My outfitter had a cabin open for the 3rd Saturday in May and I asked at what time he would accept a party of only 2. Told me right now. I called my fishing friend in Chicago and the receptionist told me she didn't get an answer. She wanted me to leave a message, but I told her it's an important call, not about business, but about fishing. Told me to hold on. He answered from the break room where he was sipping a diet coke. Told him we could have a cabin for the opener. He said 2 words. ""I'll go"". We had a great week. Don't anybody give me crap about using too many words or I'll come after you. You won't be telling me anything I don't already know."
6280290,Pink Unicorn,2019-01-18 14:46:00,83,"I own a brewpub in Chicago and on Monday nights, the fishing crew gets together to throw a few back and play cards. When a new person expresses interest in going to Canada, I make them go to at least 2 Monday nights. I get a sense of who they are and if they're committed. If they can't commit to 2 Monday nights, they can't commit to Canada. I have 17 going up, flying out of Red Lake in late July. 3 backed out, all new people. I never take it personally when someone decides not to go... for me, the less people the less work it takes to plan something like that and the more quality time I get with my main core."

So he has some experience when its the grandson sitting up front and not the old man. Cant put into words what it means to fish Canada with your son. Other than it don't get any better than that. Always dreamed of sitting back there running the motor with the grandson up front. Most people will never ever know what the Canadian fishing trip means to this OLD MAN. Halfmoon

Even though Gramps could drive me insane quicker than my young son at the time, they are some of the best memories I'll ever have from Canada.

He often has friends that long to join us but can't seem to get it together by deposit time (Christmas). My son tells me frequently that he would not miss our trips since who knows how long his father and uncle will be able to go. We treasure our yearly week in paradise. FISH ON! Hooks"
6280474,turkeyriver,2019-01-19 10:22:00,80,My son is not going this year. His excuse is the only one I consider a good one. My grandson will be born sometime in June and he wants to be home for the first couple months. I'll be in a boat dreaming of the day I can take them BOTH up north. He'll be back next year! Couple years ago a guy backed out the day before we were leaving for Canada. Didn't have a good reason. He didn't get his money back and hasn't been asked again to go. He has been hinting he'd like to go again. Not sure how to handle it.
6280500,lionfan19,2019-01-19 13:03:00,41,"Hey Turkeyriver, I was the original poster. You say you had a guy back out the day before the trip. No way in **** I would ever consider that dude for a trip again. A guy like that could have screwed it up for everyone. The outfitter books a group with the assumption he is gonna get paid for that number of people. When a guy like that backs out you are essentially shortchainging him. It makes the you and your whole group look bad. I rate that right up there with having an affair with my wife."
6280508,turkeyriver,2019-01-19 13:45:00,80,"I hear you. I was lucky I still had my four guys to go. The outfitter was a little put out, but I've done a lot of trips with them and they understood. Bad thing is, he was and still is a good friend of mine. He knows he's on my sh@tlist about that trip. He will only ever be an extra and probably never one of my 4 solid guys."
6278342,lionfan19,2019-01-12 15:19:00,41,"Anyone else here struggle to fill out a roster when it comes to a fly in trip. It always amazes me that when I go to put together a four man crew that the ten guys who are always begging me to include them on my next adventure suddenly cannot commit. I swear its like pulling teeth every time. I try to plan these trips far enough in advance that no one should have plans yet and I get answers like ""Well that's a year and a half away I am not sure yet"". Or the every popular ""When do you gotta know by""? The whole point of planning far in advance is so that you put it on the calendar and then work around that. Just a source of stress I do not need every time I do this."
6278344,jbb1069,2019-01-12 15:28:00,33,"It's not just fly-ins. I had 10 guys at work who always say they are interested in a fishing trip. Managed to get 3 to go to Lac Seul twice and then 2 went once and then just one guy who became my steady fishing partner for the last 8 years. We try a new lake every year. My wife is my permanent fishing partner, we have fished together since we met. Wife and I spend two weeks at Gold Pines on Lac Seul for the last 13 years. Next year will be our 25th anniversary"
6278368,Esoxmike,2019-01-12 16:38:00,114,"Same here,that's why my son is my partner,just rougher to book the week u want because have to wait for outfitters book bigger parties then fill in empty slots with small party"
6278374,bthomas3333,2019-01-12 17:06:00,465,"Hey,A lot of guys are just not that into a trip into the woods to deal with weather, bugs, and fish for days on end. I used to try to convince or sell trips on guys who were just bad fits. Those things just don't result in long lasting groups. If someone is very interested and a good fit you won't struggle to get them / keep them interested. Just need to find the right guys / groups.My situation has progressed from camping/fishing Quetico twice a year with my dad and his buddies to doing fly-ins for 20+ years with a group of 7-8 guys. Now many of those guys have aged out. I am remaking my fishing groups now. To do that you need to take a chance. Take a chance and fish with some new guys.There are still a lot of hardcore fishing fanatics out there. Take a chance and join a new group of guys. Find a trip you want to take and ask for other guys to join you. I know I have had to rebuild my fishing network and it sounds like you need to also.Hope this helps.B"
6278426,LoDo,2019-01-12 20:56:00,721,"Ive been doing this trip for 25 yrs. During my youth it was always with my dad. Now that I'm late 30s its with buddies, fly-in NW Ontario. We have a solid 6-8 that go every year. In addition we have another 2-3 that are hit or miss. For me, this trip is something i've done far longer than my wife and I have been married. If you've been doing this trip before marriage I tend to think your wife is marrying into this trip. I could see where one might be able to do this trip annually if its something that was planned after marriage. Does this make sense? Similar to buying a motorcycle. You best buy one before marriage because the wife prob won't approve of a 'cycle after marriage."
6278454,Pooch,2019-01-13 02:22:00,4618,"Seems like all groups eventually morph as they mature into different groups over time. Guys come and go in the early years then it kind of settles into four or six hard cores that are pretty dependable and enjoy being together. That is when the group tends to solidify. It takes a few years to weed out the guys who tend to cancel at the last minute. They do not get invited back. Years ago I was invited to join a group from a totally different state. I was extremely uncomfortable, but after a week together I loved these guys. Eventually I put together a splinter group from my area and we now book the same week together as the original group with cabins next to each other. We have the original MN group and now the IL boys. It is a lot of fun and the logistics of a huge group are diminished.When you look at photos of groups here on WC, they all look about the same. You could take about any guy from any group and put him in with any other group and it would most likely work.In the early years it was like herding cats to hold a group together until the die hard, reliable fisherman rose to the top.Pooch"
6278520,WiRiver,2019-01-13 08:31:00,13,"I have tried to put fishing, fly-in fishing trips together 7 separate times only 3 times did the trip ever happen. It seems that some people just don't like the idea of crossing an international border. I myself love visiting different places in Canada and the more remote the better."
6278548,Mr. Sauger,2019-01-13 10:31:00,285,"Yep, same ol struggle each year. I would love to have a consistent four-man all-star lineup. Need guys who like fishing and have their ship together. That requires they have the money saved/allocated, vacation time from work granted, blessings from wife/family, guts to make a decision/commitment and in general are a person of reliable character. I've gone with guys who don't make a lot of money but are true to their word and make the trip. Also made a trip with newbie fisherman with a small family who made the trip because he had his act together. Others have made trips but had trouble committing. Getting an answer was hard enough; getting cash deposit was even harder. Eventually, we developed a process. The hardcore reliable regular guys make the decision of when & where to go and made deposits. Invites were extended to the wish-washy fisherman with the stipulation that acceptance didn't count until non-refundable cash deposits were received and for the next one or two invitees. You snooze, you lose. Since they were friends e might bend a rule, but the bluff was stated to get them off their duff."
6278556,BornToFish,2019-01-13 11:10:00,1224,"Greetings,I suspect that many of us has been in the position of the original poster for this thread. Pooch said it very well: ""In the early years it was like herding cats to hold a group together until the die hard, reliable fisherman rose to the top.""I am now fortunate to make several trips each season to fish in NW Ontario. The group for one of the trips is fairly large (around sixteen or so folks). They all know they need to commit and ante up their deposit for next year when they leave the lodge. Otherwise their spot will be gone and made available to someone else.I make two other trips each season with my wife. We stay in a two person cabin. We would not miss the chance to be with one another, enjoying each other's company, while catching a lot of nice fish.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6279132,Jeler,2019-01-15 05:19:00,92,"Can't imagine trying to get a group together to go for a fly-in. The scheduling months in advance and commitment each party member must make. Kudos to those of you that have a ""solid"" group formed.Borntofish-I'm like you and always have my wonderful and fun wife to join me on my fly-in trips!"
