Last October Garmin issued a press release with this headline:Garmin® redefines marine cartography with the introduction of BlueChart® g3 and LakeVü g3 with Navionics integration It was mentioned in a Walleye Central post and I responded to it enthusiastically because the lake I fish most in Canada (Lake St. Joseph) has a very good Navionics map (very little depth marking, but great shoreline & island detail) but a very poor, crude map on Garmin. I have both Lowrance and Garmin products and thought this would be the best possible solution. For some reason that thread is now gone from W/C. Who knows how it could have possibly gotten political or religious. I've attached photos of the same area of Lake St. Joseph maps from both Garmin and Navionics. Sorry about the icons in the way, but I don't know how to get them to not appear. The Garmin Canada LakeVu g3 map is now out, but I was disappointed to see that Lake St. Joseph is not on the list of maps detailed. I tried calling Garmin to see if any changes had been made to the map in the Lake St. Joseph area, not depth but just a better map, and basically got no answer. You can't see the map online and even the ""support"" person I talked to didn't have the map available to him. If you have the new Garmin Canada LakeVu g3 map, could you look at the Lake St. Joseph area and take a photo of it. The coordinates are 51 04.595 N, 90 40.387 W. Either post the picture or, better yet, get in touch with me via P/M and I'll get you my email address. Thank you."

6308660,stjoeguy,2019-04-07 13:59:00,979,"Thanks, Fishquest, but I've found the answer. I posted this question on the Electronics thread also and got a recommendation from azbohunter to try the Garmin thread on bbcboards and that produced an answer pretty quickly. The result is that even though Lake St. Joseph is not listed as one of the updated lakes the map is now much better. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=692462"
