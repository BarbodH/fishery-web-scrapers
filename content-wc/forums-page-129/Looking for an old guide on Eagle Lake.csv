6311650,Guest,2019-04-15 19:25:00,0,I had a guide out of Temple Bay a few years ago and I know he left Temple Bay but was wondering if he is still guiding on the lake. I think they called him Big John wore a cowboy hat and smoked big cigars. I may be in the Dryden area this summer and may want to fish with him if he still wets a line. Thanks
