My son and I fished North Caribou Lake last summer with North Caribou Camps. For me it was my 4th trip there and there's a reason I keep going back.Walleye were easy and predictable as expected. Pike, once I figured things out were great! We caught a good number of fish over 40 inches and endless numbers of fat mid sized fish that pulled like freight trains. All the the walleyes were caught on light heads and a variety of plastics - no bait required. Every decent pike was caught casting a variety of spoons and blades in 8-10' of water with deep cabbage. The cabin and boats were fantastic as usual, so overall no complaints at all besides a bit of unstable weather and evening thunderstorms.The only real downer of the entire trip was one of my Pelican cases with two of my cameras in it got swiped on the way home. Cameras can be replaced but the photos and video can't. Was a hard lesson learned!Looking forward to returning to North Caribou this spring in late May, I expect we'll do quite well.

6308536,Mike Borger,2019-04-07 06:10:00,1554,"Glad you like it! The walleye recipe isn't anything overly wild or original, but it is good. To be exact for everyone else's sake:Cut the fish into smaller pieces.Dust in Cajun Fish Crisp coating.Dip in milk and egg.Roll in Panko bread crumbs.Fry in hot oil.I prefer an oversized cast iron pan with an inch of oil in it over a deep fryer."

6309764,Mike Borger,2019-04-10 14:44:00,1554,Always measure. Nope none of these fish were close to 50. Biggest was 441/2 I believe.
