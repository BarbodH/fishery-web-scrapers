6309048,JDP,2019-04-08 14:34:00,1457,Just bring your Northern Pike fishing equipment on your trip.Buy walleye fillets at the grocery store on your way up to Canada.Then save 'incidental' walleyes caught for eating once the store purchased walleyes have been consumed.Saves your valuable time on the water and eliminates the boring task of fishing for walleyes.
6309060,bushead11,2019-04-08 15:42:00,151,"I figured this was going to come across the wrong way and my apologies. I am 100% - all for jigging walleyes. I just thought it was cool to see in Florida and thought it would be even cooler to see a bunch of walleyes in a net if it were legal. Which it is not. Again, not intending to stir the pot or get anyone excited. Tight lines and good luck to all this spring/summer! We're about 4 weeks away!"
6309098,v-bay gord,2019-04-08 18:46:00,3168,Hey thanks for getting a few of us excited. Not much lately has been triggering my inner-ashole.
6309130,Bill Krejca,2019-04-08 20:35:00,6107,"Sometimes it is just as stimulating to read some trolling funnies as it can be to get a cool tip on improving our angling abilities. It really is kind of neat for me to see the salt water folks making a haul after a fantastic cast with a circular net. I have the same admiration for a good ""caster"" as I do for anyone who can actually tie a back-to-back Uni-Knot! Bill"
6309152,pjshorthorn,2019-04-09 04:32:00,5654,"Now this response clears up an immense amount as to why you tend to be a larger arse then the masses. You have both an inney and an outey bunghole....Hmmmmm........I know you have socialized medicine and all, but have you thought about getting checked for excessive bungness? Since I'll have to endure a week of you being a larger than normal arse head on this year's trip, I'll be expecting an additional 30% discount on my trip.....in US dollars so I can understand the bill and know I'm not getting horked. PjShorthorn"
6309280,v-bay gord,2019-04-09 11:26:00,3168,Here's the technical explanation...
6309586,orchard frank,2019-04-10 07:18:00,1900,"Since moving to Florida and getting a boat, learning to throw a cast net has been one of the projects that I have taken on. You tube will show about 30 different ways, some involve using your mouth as part of the process, or a complex folding over the shoulder, turn your hand inside out, grab the left side with your right hand turned backwards, and on and on. Even when I settled on a method that worked ""okay"" for me, the challenge is getting it right the first throw, when the bait is there, hopefully. Add 70 yr old shoulders to the mix, and it is a real victory to get some bait. Then you see a 12 yr old girl walk out onto a pier and throw out a perfect pancake with a large 12' net, and drag it in loaded."
6308648,bushead11,2019-04-07 13:18:00,151,I was just in Florida on spring break and our guide used a casting net to catch bait. Got me thinking... I know that non-residents are not allowed to catch bait but I could not find any regulations regarding casting nets. I did find regulations for dip nets and Seine nets however. Wondering if anyone here has any insight? We head to Canada for the opener and the walleyes are usually pretty shallow and usually pretty stacked up once we find them - so I thought it might be a fun experiment...
6308764,chris.brock,2019-04-07 20:21:00,112,"just to clarify, do you mean throwing a casting net to try and catch walleye?"
6308770,bushead11,2019-04-07 21:29:00,151,Yep
6308840,chris.brock,2019-04-08 06:28:00,112,"yeah, not legal in Ontario. This is from the regs- it's illegal to-Take fish by any means other thanangling, spear, bow and arrow, dip orseine net or baitfish trap.there's some species like herring and smelt that can be netted in season, I don't know about a casting net, but definitely not walleye though"
6308904,Bill Krejca,2019-04-08 08:19:00,6107,"One of the concerns among those making a living from bait sales used to be tourists mining their own bait. Because of this, restrictions on types of nets/traps have been tightened and increasingly regulated over the past 50-60 years. There still is enough of a concern that it may not be considered unusual for a warden to ask for a bait receipt for the minnows in your bucket, especially if the bait is mostly nice juicy shiners. The days of legal minnow traps and increasingly smaller allowable nets and drop nets have come and gone, they were fun years. Bill"
6308920,bushead11,2019-04-08 08:56:00,151,"I totally understand the concern and I do not want to take dollars out of our outfitters pockets. My curiosity was more around the ability to throw a casting net on top of stacked up walleyes. Get the eaters in one shot and move on to the trophy pike spots... Wasn't sure if it was legal. If it were, if a casting net would be strong enough to hold 8-10 17 inch walleye in one shot...?"
6308938,Fisherman Ted,2019-04-08 09:26:00,461,"Dude, you're kidding right? This isn't the Keys. Grab a rod and reel and catch them like everyone else."
6308990,v-bay gord,2019-04-08 11:13:00,3168,"Let me finish your train of thought. ""...and move on to the trophy pike spots...where we will throw in a grenade and then skim off the 40 inchers with a large dip net..."" Duh..."
6309010,wmd,2019-04-08 11:54:00,388,Really???? You can't be serious! wmd
6309028,Wall-i-Lama,2019-04-08 13:08:00,1524,"You must be kidding or simply trolling? Perhaps you should contact the MNR once you get up there, to see if you can borrow their gill nets and shocking equipment. That way, you won't have to mess around with the actual sport of angling and get right to the slaughter and fish fry. I'm sure the MNR would be willing to help you! Sheesh!"
