I did check previous posts but only found a few and they were several years old. If you hit the same place every year and they've got the goods at a decent price, I'd love to hear from you. My Dad did call one bait shop in Thunder Bay that quoted him a price of $6/dozen and only available by the dozen (no flat/half-flat pricing). Maybe that is the going rate these days but I don't recall paying that much last fall. Thanks in advance!"

6310452,Wickguy1,2019-04-12 06:54:00,14,We have been stopping at Larry's Baits in Kakabeka Falls to pick up crawlers. I believe we paid around $65 for a flat last year. I usually send them a message through Facebook to make sure they save me a flat for pickup on my way through. They usually have several on hand so I probably don't need to even reserve any. They do like the foam container dropped off on your way back through which is no big deal so I do it as a courtesy.

Price was about equal buying them by the flat and there was no mess. Actually stated they were a product of Canada right on the package. The border guard really liked that.

I always call ahead, but I don't think it is typically necessary. The owner of the camp I fish west of there recommended that I use this supplier. Never disappointed."
