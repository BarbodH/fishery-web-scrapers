Looking for insights to the fishing, lodge, etc. Have done my due diligence on searching prior threads, but they are vague and somewhat dated. Sounds like the lodge is going to be pretty nice and have corresponded with the owner via email. So far so good. Any and all advice will be greatly appreciated. Bringing own boat and plan on fishing for any and all available species. Would really, really like to find some crappie."
