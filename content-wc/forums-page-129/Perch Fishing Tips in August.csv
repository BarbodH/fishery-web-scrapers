6308658,SimonHockey04,2019-04-07 13:40:00,25,My family would like to catch some perch on our upcoming fishing trip in early august on Red Lake. What are some techniques/tackle you use that we can implement on our trip?What size jigs do you like to use?What ## line is recommended?What should we use for bait?Feel free to PM me

A small chunk of nightcrawler, fishing in shallow water like 4-10ft. I'm sure someone that fishes red lake will chime in and have some locations for you to start out from. Good luck and have fun."
6308664,SimonHockey04,2019-04-07 14:18:00,25,Thanks for your help. Would 1/16 oz & 1/32 oz size jigs work?
6308666,kettyspanky,2019-04-07 14:22:00,271,I'm sure. Otherwise small hook with a split shot a foot above the hook. Real easy to fish. Let us know how the trip goes. I'm heading to some of the lakes up that way in a couple years.

I love the mini tubes used for crappie fishing. Work really well on all panfish. The Bass Pro shops squirmin' squirts are cheap and effective (top right in the attached image). Other micro plastics work well too.
