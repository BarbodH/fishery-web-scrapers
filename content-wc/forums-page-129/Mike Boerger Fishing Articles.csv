They provide a wealth of information on many of the lakes in the North and have provided me with a ""list"" of those I would certainly avoid and those I can't wait to try one day in the future. Additionally, the personal help he has provided me on our trip this year is invaluable! I'm going on close to 30 consecutive years of fishing in the North (20+ of those being flying into a remote lake) and can't wait to do it again this year. We have a crew of 6 flying in on 6/15. Can't get here quick enough. Good luck fishing all."

I have read just about everything Mike has posted, for both good reading/viewing and for shortening the learning curve on these lakes. My brother and I are flying with Brace Lake Outfitters this summer, and a big reason for that is what I have seen and learned from Mike's trip report on that lake. I subscribe to his site, and spend a lot of time viewing his trip reports."

6309704,MrSimon,2019-04-10 12:25:00,922,Mike is awesome. Subscribing to his content is totally worth it. It's informative and entertaining. Just remember that he's been doing this for a LONG time and is very good at it. Don't be discouraged if your results at a particular lake don't match his results.
